<div id="ygrps-yiv-368484876">Due positive tests for West Nile at Heckscher State Park the <br/>
campground is currently closed with no guarantee they will open for <br/>
our scheduled camping trip. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling Camping trip is now at Allaire State Park in Monmouth <br/>
County, NJ.<br/>

Information as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling Gathering - Camping on Jersey Shore<br/>
<br/>
Spread the word<br/>
<br/>
Several unschooling families will be camping at Allaire State Park&#39;s <br/>
camp ground in Monmouth County, NJ, from August 26th through <br/>
September 5th this summer and would welcome other unschoolers <br/>
joining the group for all or part of that time. There are still many <br/>
sites available. We&#39;ve done this in past years and it&#39;s always nice <br/>
to have other families coming and going throughout the week.<br/>
<br/>
The park is 15 minutes to Jersey Shore beaches (Blemar and Spring <br/>
Lake). Half hour to Island Beach State Park. 20 minutes to Point <br/>
Pleasant. 3 miles from small grocery store and 6 miles to all major <br/>
shopping amenities, restaurants and entertainment, etc. 10 minutes <br/>
to County Park with canoe and Kayak rental for reservoir boating. <br/>
<br/>
In the past, while camping with multiple families, we&#39;ve kept it <br/>
pretty flexible and loose not doing too much planning so that <br/>
families and individuals can follow their own needs while providing <br/>
a great group experience. This camping trip is organized in such a <br/>
fashion that being together doesn&#39;t mean anyone is obligated to <br/>
follow anyone else&#39;s agenda or schedule, however, there is always a <br/>
lot of overlap, shared meals, shared bike trips, beach trips, etc. <br/>
If we&#39;re a large group, we try not to complicate the trip by <br/>
expecting or planning an entire group to do the same thing each day <br/>
throughout the week - but hey - sometimes even that happens!<br/>
<br/>
The state park itself offers:<br/>
<br/>
Visitor Center/Museum<br/>
<br/>
Manasquan River for canoeing and fishing<br/>
<br/>
5 mile paved bike trail from park to Manasquan (ocean beach town)<br/>
<br/>
Nature Interpretive Center<br/>
<br/>
Dirt trails throughout the park for hikers, mountain bikes and <br/>
horseback riders<br/>

<br/>
Fees $20 per night for 2 tents, 6 people, 2 cars per site.<br/>
<br/>
Also has Yurts and Shelters (see link for descriptions) - though <br/>
none are available on the weekend at this time. There is a <br/>
playground right in the campground. Hot showers as well.<br/>
<br/>
To book campsite call (732) 938 2371. There are still sites <br/>
available. <br/>
<br/>
Try to be next too or near site #41 - but nothing is that far away.<br/>
<br/>
If you want more information or details contact me directly. Please <br/>
spread the word and post this on other unschooling lists. <br/>
