<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430510354">Alex has been asking to create his own web site, so I looked around and found <br/>
Kid&#39;s Universe.  I helped him out with the typing and explained each of the <br/>
six steps, but other than that, it&#39;s all done by him. If you go there, please <br/>
take a moment to sign his guestbook.  I know he would love that!<br/>
If you want to read the guestbook, type in alexander.<br/>

Alex&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link to the creator if you want to do this with your kids.  It&#39;s <br/>
really cool!<br/>
