<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993558635">The words below are from a woman who is on one of the lists I belong to. Her<br/>
husband died suddenly a little bit ago and these are some of the things she<br/>
has said about his passing and their situation. I pass this on because maybe<br/>
some of you out there can help. Whether it is to donate to the fund that has<br/>
been set up for this family or maybe just a bear to the program mentioned<br/>
below in this fellow&#39;s name or more prayers, they sound like they could use<br/>
plenty of those. I do hope no one feels this is spam, I have gotten to know<br/>
this lady on the list we are on and I really feel for her in her loss.<br/>
Blessings to you all.<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
    Thank you one and all for your concern and prayers.  Yes, things are<br/>
quite crazy around here.  The Memorial Service was so unbelievable.  There<br/>
were 2,200 people in attendance and 50 fire engines/ladder rigs/medic vans,<br/>
etc., in the procession.  Steve was a very well loved 20 year lieutenant<br/>
firefighter and received national acclaim for his inception of the teddy<br/>
bear<br/>
program, which is now worldwide in scope.  (Giving teddies to children in<br/>
fire/trauma/accident/health crises.)<br/>
    The three major Seattle news stations covered the service and procession<br/>
and there were articles in the Seattle, Tacoma, and Olympia newspapers as<br/>
well as news clips on the weekend news last week.<br/>
    The fire dept. bought Steve a Class A uniform in which to be buried and<br/>
all the pallbearers plus the one carrying his bunker gear through the<br/>
ceremonies all also purchased Class A uniforms for the event.  The fire<br/>
dept.<br/>
provided four 10-person limosines and four brand new vans just to haul<br/>
around<br/>
the immediate family!!! (Steve was one of 14 children and they all came with<br/>
their spouses and children and grandchildren!!)<br/>
    The procession was over five miles long from start to finish and we<br/>
drove<br/>
around ten miles to the cemetery from the service.  Police were stationed at<br/>
every intersection directing traffic.  All badges in the county- fire and<br/>
police - are all crossed in black and every fire dept. in the state has half<br/>
mast flags.<br/>
    The entire district fire service personnel attended the funeral and the<br/>
district were covered voluntarily by another district personnel and all<br/>
their<br/>
overtime has been donated to the Steve Henderson Memorial Fund at any<br/>
Heritage Bank in Washington.<br/>
    I&#39;ve heard from places all over the world from people donating teddy<br/>
bears to their local fire depts. in Steve&#39;s honor.<br/>
    Steve was a very loved, very honored firefighter.  His casket was<br/>
brought<br/>
to the cemetery on Engine 34 - his engine for 20 years - with his driver<br/>
driving him one last time.  The show of all the respect and admiration for<br/>
everyone&#39;s &quot;Hero&quot; was astounding.  He was a wonderful husband and father,<br/>
too.<br/>
    Our four teenaged daughters got up in front of 2,200 people and talked<br/>
about their Daddy.  His best friend and driver, Pat, the Chief, the Pastor,<br/>
and Fire Commissioner spoke.  They showed two videos - one of the family set<br/>
to &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; and one of the fire service set to &quot;He&#39;s Not<br/>
Heavy, He&#39;s My Brother.&quot;  There were five bagpipers (traditional at fire and<br/>
police funerals), they had Steve&#39;s Harley in front of the church along with<br/>
hundreds of donated teddy bears decorating the huge sanctuary.<br/>
    They talked about how Steve was named National Firefighter of the Year<br/>
in<br/>
1986 for the Teddy Bear Program and how Governor Booth Gardner proclaimed<br/>
Steve Henderson Day in the State of Washington April 10, 1987.  He was given<br/>
so many awards and honors during his life and everyone loved him.<br/>
    We miss him so much.  My daughters are lost without their Daddy.  He was<br/>
only 50 and this was so sudden.  The autopsy said heart attack.<br/>
    Anyway....before I go on more, thank you for asking.  I am looking for<br/>
work now - I&#39;m the breadwinner now!  Steve was on LEOFF2 which means he only<br/>
would get the big life insurance if he was killed on duty.  Since he wasn&#39;t,<br/>
we&#39;re getting $15,000 and $8,000 goes to the funeral expenses.  I&#39;m hoping<br/>
that Steve Henderson Memorial Fund helps us!  I heard there was $900 in it<br/>
so<br/>
far!!  Our mortgage is $1,800 a month and we have no savings, so we&#39;ll have<br/>
to sell the house and move.  Our car (Steve was working on it when he died)<br/>
is toast so we&#39;ll need another car, too.  Steve&#39;s brother is buying his<br/>
Harley so we&#39;ll get $5,000 for that so I can get another car for that.  I<br/>
have to have a reliable car!!<br/>
    So, keep praying - LOT-O-DECISIONS to be made.  I&#39;ve been home raising<br/>
and homeschooling kids for 21 years and I need to get a job to support my<br/>
family, so I think that&#39;s the main prayer request!!<br/>
    Thanks for asking and caring.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Lynnie<br/>

Thank you for your encouraging words.  This is such a weird time.  Each<br/>
morning I think he&#39;s still going to be coming in the door after his shift<br/>
(he<br/>
was gone for 24 hrs. every third day, you see).  The tears still slow pretty<br/>
freely around here.  My husband was such a wonderful man.  He loved his<br/>
family above all but God.  He really did.  My four daughters have lost the<br/>
most wonderful example of what a husband and father should be.  I&#39;m sorry<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
puddling again.<br/>
    As for the job part, I&#39;ve been substituting at a Christian high school<br/>
in<br/>
Tacoma (45 mins away) but need a full time job.  I can&#39;t be certified in WA<br/>
State until I take a &quot;student teaching course&quot; but I don&#39;t think I want to<br/>
teach a classroom, anyway.  Subbing and teaching (or should I say CROWD<br/>
CONTROL) is very stressful, even at a Christian school!!!  My field is more<br/>
counseling, but that doesn&#39;t pay enough.<br/>
    Just pray and God will guide, I know he will!!  Here&#39;s the bank address<br/>
for the Memorial Fund.  So far they tell me they have $900 in the account!!<br/>
Pretty cool - but it&#39;s HALF of ONE mortgage payment!!<br/>
    I&#39;ve got to sell this house and buy down, but I can&#39;t until I have a<br/>
job.<br/>
We are on such time constraints, I can&#39;t tell you.  I think we can only<br/>
survive one more month (November) on the money that was given to us by the<br/>
family and fire dept.  So...I&#39;ve GOT to get a job!!!<br/>
    Our medical benefits end Nov. 1st as well and I have to pay COBRA to<br/>
keep<br/>
on the policy - $300 a month.  I can&#39;t NOT have any medical coverage for us,<br/>
(and I have to continue the policy at the fire dept. because NO ONE else<br/>
will<br/>
take me - I&#39;ve had breast cancer twice and Stage IV bone cancer involvement<br/>
in 19 places, with a bone marrow transplant in 1991 - successful, praise the<br/>
Lord!!)  So you see, no one else will cover me - maybe even not a job - so I<br/>
have to keep that policy in effect.  Sorry, I&#39;m venting again....<br/>
    Thank you, dear friends, for your prayers and uplifting encouragement.<br/>
God WILL provide.  I have to remember that.  He will come through.  I don&#39;t<br/>
blame Him for wanting Steve to come home to Him.  It was His will.  None of<br/>
my daughters are bitter, either, thank the Lord.  They are just so sad.  We<br/>
all are.  We miss our Daddy.<br/>
