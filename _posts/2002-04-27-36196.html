<br/>
If your son wants a curriculum, then he should get one, irrespective of any <br/>
of our prejudices against same.<br/>
<br/>
Most likely, he will determine for himself that a curriculum is highly <br/>
overrated.<br/>
<br/>
If, however, he does not, then his decision to follow a curriculum is, in and <br/>
of itself, a child-directed decision and is not contrary to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing a child to shun curricula, however, in my opinion, when the child <br/>
wishes to self-impose such structure, IS contrary to unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well...except that this is a child who has never known any other way. He has <br/>
been told all his life that *this* (meaning schooly stuff) is how you learn. <br/>
In fact, it&#39;s the ONLY way you learn. And if you don&#39;t do it, and do it <br/>
&quot;right&quot;, you&#39;ll fail to learn anything. He&#39;s scared. That&#39;s not the best <br/>
point from which to make the best decisions.<br/>
<br/>
And this is not a criticism of his parents, or saying that his mom has told <br/>
him all this. This message is everywhere. He&#39;s probably truly afraid that <br/>
he&#39;ll amount to nothing and be ignorant his whole life. He needs to <br/>
experience another way in order to get comfortable with it. It&#39;s why we all <br/>
feel the need to find support. We&#39;re going against the accepted norm.<br/>
<br/>
So, even though he&#39;s asking for curriculum, and I wouldn&#39;t force him to shun <br/>
it exactly, I would do my best to point out and share all the other millions <br/>
of real-world opportunities for learning out there.<br/>
<br/>
My newest thought on the matter is to just keep telling him &quot;next week&quot;. <br/>
We&#39;ll get that curriculum next week. Spelling tests? Oh yeah, I&#39;ll have <br/>
great words for you next week. If he goes along with the game of never <br/>
getting to the curriculum then great. If he gets upset and wants next week <br/>
&quot;right now&quot;, then go to plan B and bring out the eclectic low-cost, no <br/>
pressure stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing!  &quot;Why don&#39;t we just take this week off <br/>
because Sarah has a lot of 4H stuff going on and we won&#39;t be home much <br/>
anyway?  We&#39;ll get back to your work next week.&quot; which he seems OK with as he <br/>
doesn&#39;t normally really enjoy schoolwork, except for our space unit.  And, I <br/>
know that he DOES realize learning can take place out of workbooks just from <br/>
some comments he makes, though I don&#39;t think he realizes that you can learn <br/>
everything you need to know out of them, if that makes any sense!  He likes <br/>
doing unit studies and going on fieldtrips and such and he knows that he <br/>
learns things outside of &quot;work time&quot;. Though, I don&#39;t think he understands <br/>
that he doesn&#39;t *need* all this &quot;stuff&quot; imposed on him to learn &quot;properly&quot;, <br/>
which is something that&#39;s hard to get through to anyone, let alone a stubborn <br/>
ten year old, especially when you still have some doubts yourself.  <br/>

&quot;must&quot; go to... Seattle, Boston, NYC, D.C. again (she went when she was 9 and <br/>
loved it), L.A. again (she&#39;s been a few times in her life, but not since she <br/>
was 10), Hawaii again (she went as a baby), Florida again (went at 3), <br/>
Colorado, Phoenix, plus all of Canada, Italy, France, England, Ireland, and <br/>
Australia - you get the picture!  We&#39;d have to be *extremely* wealthy for her <br/>
to go to all the places she wants to go to!  LOL<br/>

something &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I wasn&#39;t really thinking of &quot;curriculum&quot; the way some people mean it. <br/>
I was thinking that if he feels like he needs some sort of &quot;program&quot; that she <br/>
could take him to a teacher supply store and he could pick out some stuff <br/>
there.  Maybe &quot;Science Experiments You Can Eat,&quot; for example.<br/>
<br/>

Some of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>
harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>
uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never suggested that the mother find a cheaper curriculum.  <br/>
<br/>
I began participating in the discussion when someone on this list suggested <br/>
that it was inappropriate to even be seriously discussing a &quot;curriculum&quot; in <br/>
the light of the subject of this list.  <br/>
<br/>
I disagreed, and I continue to disagree, with that point.  <br/>
<br/>
MY point is that, in my opinion, an unschooled child should have the <br/>
opportunity to use a curriculum if the child wishes so to do (and if, of <br/>
course, a curriculum is affordable by the family).  <br/>
<br/>
I, personally, do not think that a curriculum -- if selected by and <br/>
implemented by the child -- is anti-unschooling.  I understand and agree with <br/>
the opinions expressed by list members that the child&#39;s desire for a <br/>
curriculum should be tested, whether such testing is by way of time, money, <br/>
intellect, or some other way.  <br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, and again in my opinion, it is hypocritical and prejudicial of us to <br/>
believe that it is unschooling when a child chooses to cook, play with sticks <br/>
in the dirt, or milk the cows, but that it is anti-unschooling for a child to <br/>
choose to self-impose a curriculum.  The distinction between subject matters, <br/>
in my opinion, is artificial.  As someone (I believe it was you, Sandra) <br/>
properly (I think) pointed out, unschooling is not about the subjects, it is <br/>
about the method.  Thus, if this child wishes to use a curriculum then I <br/>
would not squelch that desire merely because of some fear that the act of <br/>
studying a curriculum might somehow interfere with one&#39;s concept of <br/>
unschooling.  If the child chose it, then it is unschooling.  That&#39;s my <br/>
understanding of unschooling, anyway, even though it may not be yours or <br/>
anyone else&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, then, the presence or absence of a curriculum does not <br/>
correlate with the presence or absence of unschooling.  Whether the child <br/>
caused the presence or absence of a curriculum, however, does correlate with <br/>
the presence of absence of unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
That was in a discussion of whether unschooling was the same stuff as school.<br/>
<br/>
It is the same stuff as when school is dealing with the real world.<br/>
If school could, or tried to present the whole real world then a school <br/>
curriculum wouldn&#39;t be the finite set of information that it ends up being.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent lets a child believe that he will know all the math he&#39;ll ever <br/>
need to know by following a curriculum, that is not a stream that leads into <br/>
the greater ocean of discovery learning.  If a parent leads a child to think <br/>
(or lets him continue to think) that a bought unit study on ancient history <br/>
is going to be IT, no more to learn after that, I think neither the parent <br/>
nor the child will get to unschooling anytime soon, any more than if I get on <br/>
I-40 and drive East can I come to Denver without eventually turning around <br/>
and coming ALL that way back, or veering around in a big circle and getting <br/>

parents &quot;leading&quot; children to believe anything, but was about children <br/>
leading themselves.  I thought that that was what you believed, too.  Again, <br/>
that might be my mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that encouraging a child to follow the child&#39;s desire to <br/>
follow a curriculum is &quot;the most circuitous route to unschooling.&quot;  On the <br/>
contrary, I believe that encouraging a child to follow the child&#39;s desire to <br/>
follow a curriculum (or to follow the cows, the moon, or the poets) lies at <br/>
the heart of unschooling.<br/>

it at a much higher level with the ABeka.<br/>
