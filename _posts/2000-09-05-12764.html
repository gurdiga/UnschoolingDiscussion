I couldn&#39;t agree more.  We may never know the good that comes from<br/>
discussing such topics, it would be a shame to discourage people from asking<br/>
questions.  There is the idea that when one person in a group asks a<br/>
question they are speaking for others in the group too.  This discussion<br/>
does not have to be about changing minds, but instead it could be seen as an<br/>
opportunity to exchange ideas, to throw out our own stories that might aid<br/>
someone else.  It has been mentioned that some parents who were raised with<br/>
corporal punishment are looking for ideas to help them avoid repeating the<br/>
past.  Certainly I have never changed my mind or learned anything by being<br/>
reprimanded or scolded, so I don&#39;t think this is an effective way to get a<br/>
point across.<br/>
<br/>
I for one don&#39;t believe in &#39;punishment&#39; in any form as a device for teaching<br/>
children (or adults for that matter), but due to my history I have a nasty<br/>
temper, my parents rarely hit us but there was emotional violence, and lots<br/>
of throwing objects and such.  So even though I have come to terms with all<br/>
of this, and I have found a philosophy that I try to live by, I am not<br/>
perfect.  Heaven knows I can use reminders of helpful hints from time to<br/>
time.  The best idea I&#39;ve found is singing- it calms myself and my son.  But<br/>
it&#39;s helpful to be reminded when I&#39;m not thinking clear.  My husband on the<br/>
other hand grew up in a family where voices were never raised, emotions<br/>
never shown either, so when I forget and start to scream he gets quite<br/>
upset.  But it never helps if he  criticizes me at this point, if instead he<br/>
tries to understand, or if he would gently start to sing I could calm down,<br/>
this is what I want to do after all.<br/>
<br/>
So it seems that Corallyn wanted ideas that she could use to avoid a<br/>
situation she was uncomfortable with, and some people did answer with<br/>
compassion  for her intent, that can help.  Continuing to back her into a<br/>
corner can never accomplish anything.<br/>
<br/>
I am very new to this list, but this seemed very important to me- the idea<br/>
of approaching a situation in a loving helpful manner, rather than creating<br/>
ill feelings & defensiveness, so that everyone feels safe to seek help &<br/>
advice about any matters that may ultimately benefit their children.<br/>
