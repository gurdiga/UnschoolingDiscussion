 </span></blockquote>I guess for us we don&#39;t unschool subjects.  It is just life.  My boys have <br/>
seen animals mating on TV and here at the house.  They haven&#39;t asked any <br/>
questions specifically about sex but they are young (6 and 8).  I imagine, for us, it <br/>
will be like anything else.  If they have questions they will ask. Movies <br/>
etc. can be good jumping off points for conversations about sex, birth control, <br/>
STDs etc. Nothing is off limits to talk about.  My oldest (8 yo) asked what <br/>
tampons were for so we had a conversation about that. <br/>
<br/>
Like I said my boys are young so maybe someone with an older child could <br/>
offer more insight<br/>

Mary B&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
I think maybe it might depend on the child or family but for us its all <br/>
natural discussions. We watch movies and the topic comes up. Our young pup has <br/>
urges those get discussed. People we know have babies. We had one last year that <br/>
struck up lots of conversations. Our son wants to see Matrix Reloaded I am told <br/>
there may be a few graphic scenes we discussed that. <br/>
One time last year we went into the WIC office and my son picked up a condom <br/>
out of a bowl and said he wanted one.(thought it was candy) He knew what they <br/>
where but had never seen the packaging. He was sitting with me and the girl in <br/>
the office began to bring in a wooden display and he flipped out and ran out <br/>
of the office. I would not have explained it that way. He knew what they where <br/>
for and didn&#39;t need a wooden penis to be shown. I was uncomfortable myself. <br/>
He knows what and how but just didn&#39;t need a class on it then and not in that <br/>
way. <br/>
I for one am happy that he doesn&#39;t need to sit through a sex Ed class in <br/>
school. The environment in those classes where stressful for me in school I could <br/>
not understand why they needed to teach that in such a setting.<br/>

<br/>
Just like with other subjects, there can come a time when I think they didn&#39;t <br/>
know such things existed, and it gets worked into conversation.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are talkative and ask a lot of questions.  But even without that, as <br/>
life unfolded I made comments on things around us.  Divorce.  Miscarriage.  <br/>
Disease.  What the condoms were, at the drug store, when they&#39;re in the &quot;What&#39;s <br/>
that?&quot; stage.  Lots of their exposure to the ideas and topics came from comedy <br/>
routines and movie situations.  <br/>
<br/>
As the whole world is going by, sex is part of it.<br/>
<br/>
As my boys got into puberty I talked to them a little more specifically, <br/>
partly in commentary about slightly older friends and their relationships, and <br/>
what a shame it would be if one got pregnant, or if this other one compromised <br/>
her beliefs to keep a boyfriend, and what kind of guy he would be if he pressed <br/>
her to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Conversational, mostly.<br/>

<br/>
Yes I understand what you mean I just didn&#39;t know how else to put it. I&#39;m<br/>
just wondering that if the child doesn&#39;t ask but maybe for some real general<br/>
stuff, when does the time come when a parent thinks they should volunteer<br/>
info that they feel the child should have at that age? With puberty coming<br/>
and menstruation and wet dreams, should one know ahead of time or just wait<br/>
until things happen. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m comfortable with the second of the<br/>
two.<br/>

<br/>
I want to see the wooden penis. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was always amused at the idea of using the end of a broomstick to <br/>
demonstrate how to pull the condom down.  I guess that would make all the guys feel <br/>
REALLY BIG whereas a banana might not necessarily do the same for all boys. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did the sex ed one year for 7th graders.  The kids ended up being more <br/>
mature and more comfortable in mixed groups than in same-sex groups.  Two other <br/>
teachers were totally unable to do their part in this all-school sex ed blitz we <br/>
had, so I traded out for the kids of the 64 year old woman and the <br/>
all-girls&#39;-Catholic-through-college woman, and by the end of those three batches of kids <br/>
(theirs, five classes each, and my five classes) I was really enjoying it.  I <br/>
considered switching to being a travelling sex ed teacher.<br/>
<br/>
The way I handled it was kids wrote questions on matching pieces of paper and <br/>
passed them up and that way nobody had to stick a hand up and be embarrassed. <br/>
 Lots of their questions were of a biological and genetic nature.  We talked <br/>
about zygotes and twins and recessive traits.  I told them about having an <br/>
uncircumcised boyfriend whose first time hurt a little, and there was a bit of <br/>
blood, so they shouldn&#39;t freak if they were or were with an uncircumcised guy <br/>
the first time.   That&#39;s not anything I had ever read ANYwhere before that, <br/>
because all the boys my age I had ever known, and all my relatives, were <br/>
circumcised, if not as babies, as boys.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling&#39;s WAY easier than talking to a classroom of 12 year olds, though <br/>
I kinda liked that too.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in school all they told the girls about was menstruation and <br/>
dating.<br/>
I heard they told the boys about disease and pregnancy and wetdreams.   <br/>
<br/>
Kinda limited, as the vastness of the information goes.<br/>

For our family, this discussion began very early and has progressed naturally <br/>
as the children grow.  The first tidbit I remember handing out was when we <br/>
were looking at pictures of my life before children.  Hannah piped up, &quot;I wanna <br/>
go there too!&quot;  &quot;Oh, but you *have* been there ~ you were just an egg, waiting <br/>
in line&quot;  Not only did this begin the conversation about the creation of <br/>
babies, but it added a bit of responsibility for her unborn *potential* babies.  <br/>
In the course of family bathing, male and female genitalia has been discussed <br/>
and compared.  They know where men make their *baby seeds* (sperm) and they <br/>
know that Hayden doesn&#39;t make any yet.  <br/>
The framework has been set, it gets filled in little by little as we go <br/>
along.  No books, no curriculum, just real life talks [and a bit of help from <br/>
mommy&#39;s addiction to the always *irritaining* A Baby Story]<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663456667">Oh I replied too quickly :)  and found more to reply to :)  <br/>
<br/>
Monthly cycle:  My kids are very aware of my *moon time* and the supplies I <br/>
use to care for myself.  I&#39;ve also worked on my circadian rhythm so my cycle <br/>
matches the moon ~ they know my favorite excuse for weapons is *laying an egg* <br/>
and it comes right around the *no moon* time.  <br/>
<br/>
Condoms:  Kids were in the tub and I came in to check on them, discovering <br/>
they had found a stash of condoms.  I asked what they were doing with them, <br/>
Hayden replied (say this quickly with the sounds running together) &quot;makinglove&quot; As <br/>
my mind was racing to deal with this, Hannah piped up, &quot;Ya know, like the <br/>
doctor wears&quot;  makin&#39; GLOVES! OH! hee hee hee ~ whew!  I just gave them a <br/>
rudimentary explanation of catching the sperm so it doesn&#39;t get to the mommy&#39;s egg <br/>
and they were happy with that. (Those are definitely the moments when I wish for <br/>
a male partner to help ~ but since I made it thru foreskin retraction without <br/>
help, I&#39;m sure I can guide him to/thru anything!!) <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our kids have witnessed a LOT of mating around here (sheep, chickens, birds, <br/>
dogs, cats, cows) and it has been a wonderful way to start conversations about <br/>
sex.  I think talking about animals is a great approach...it&#39;s helped me to <br/>
explain an animal&#39;s need to keep breeding, how we have some of that &quot;drive&quot; as <br/>
humans, and how if they&#39;re not careful (boyfriend/girlfriend thing) it can go <br/>
too far before they&#39;re ready.  We&#39;ve talked a lot about not getting ourselves <br/>
in a situation that will be too tempting...and about safe sex.  <br/>
<br/>
Plus we don&#39;t make sex and naked bodies (in movies, etc) a deep, dark, nasty, <br/>
secret thing.  We explain how it&#39;s natural, just like with animals, and that <br/>
it&#39;s a good thing (when one is safe and responsible.)  To this date, they have <br/>
told me (and my kids are very honest with me) only my oldest is not a virgin <br/>
and she&#39;s 19 and living with someone.  The rest (10, 11, 12, 12, 15, 17) swear <br/>
they&#39;re virgins and get a little indignant when I worry about them.<br/>

 <br/>
As I am reading these Sex ed. posts my 6 and 3 yr. old boys are watching the movie &quot;Microcosmos&quot; in which amazing super close- up photography shows animals eating, carrying, metamorphosizing (caterpillar into butterfly)and mating!  At one point two snails were shown mating accompanied by opera (pretty incredible sight) and my son asked what they were doing.  I said I thought that they were either dancing or making babies.  I found myself holding my breath as I waited for the next question and there wasn&#39;t one.  But I do think they will probably learn through watching animals since they are so fascinated by anything animal.  You have to borow or rent this movie!  It&#39;s amazing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567324648">This has been a battle between my MIL and I .  She says that sex was painful with her ex husband because of his not being circumcized and wanted all of her children to start pulling back our boys&#39; foreskin from a few months old!   I had heard this could cause scar tissue and cause the skin to fuse together so I refused and insisted that she not do it to them if she bathed them.  However, even my almost 6 yr. old&#39;s foreskin has not loosened on its own (nor with his help) to go back very far and I know at our  6 yr old well ckeck-up with the Dr. in a month it will be advised that we let her do something to help it along.

prior to going to the doctor.  That way you are well informed.  And always ask the <br/>
doctor why.  It is unusual that a boy older than 5 or 6 has a foreskin that <br/>
is not retractable, just because they have done it themselves but unless it is <br/>
causing pain for him or recurrent infections that are painful, etc., etc. I <br/>
can&#39;t think of a good reason to have it surgically done.  And that would be <br/>
painful.  Read and listen to your doctor and then make an informed decision.  It <br/>
may surprise you, the doctor may say &quot;no big deal.&quot;<br/>

threads on penile care at mothering.com discussion boards ~ check  *The case <br/>
against circumcision* ~ there are lots of treatments available should he actually <br/>
have a problem with retraction, including steroid cream.  It&#39;s not unheard of <br/>
for foreskins to remain attached to the glans until puberty!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795225837">&lt;&lt;With puberty coming<br/>
and menstruation and wet dreams, should one know ahead of time or just wait<br/>
until things happen.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine that a child would hit puberty without sex, menstruation, <br/>
wet dreams, erections, and so forth *not* coming up in conversation.  I have <br/>
known people to avoid the subject like the plague, but I sincerely doubt an <br/>
unschooling family would do that.  My kids knew about periods and tampons <br/>
from a very young age.  As a part of life.  Mom bleeds and uses tampons.  <br/>
The kids asking about the tampons naturally led into a conversation about <br/>
periods and from that into pregnancy and birth.  Once the topic is brought <br/>
up initially, it is a lot easier to fit it into conversations naturally.<br/>
<br/>
One would be hard pressed to avoid discussing sex if their children ever <br/>
watch the Discovery Channel or PBS.  My children (and husband) and I have <br/>
had wonderful conversations as a result of watching documentaries.  The <br/>
topics aren&#39;t so personal, so it&#39;s easy to use other peope&#39;s experiences to <br/>
spring off of.<br/>
<br/>
So, to answer your question, YES!  Sex education in our home is treated just <br/>
like any other topic.  We  share and discuss things as a natural part of our <br/>
days.    I can&#39;t imagine calling my kids into the living room for &quot;The <br/>
Talk&quot;.  Ick!  I was never given any sort of &quot;talk&quot; as a child or teen, but I <br/>
can imagine that if I had been, it would have felt odd, uncomfortable and <br/>
fishy to me.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s first infatuation with a boy led to wonderful talks between <br/>
the two of us.  We discussed some things in depth that we had only touched <br/>
on briefly at earlier times, but nothing came out of left field.  It was a <br/>
teeny bit uncomfortable for her in that now there was a REAL boy and what we <br/>
were talking about was much more vivid to her.  I can imagine so! LOL<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m probably a bit late in the game but NEVER EVER retract your son&#39;s <br/>
foreskin!  And, by all means, protect him from anyone who suggest you <br/>
should, *including* and especially your/his doctor.  I can tell you from <br/>
horrid experience that pediatricians no nothing about uncirc&#39;ed boys.  Hell, <br/>
or circ&#39;ed boys for that matter.  Long story.  :::sigh:::<br/>
<br/>
The foreskin WILL retract on it&#39;s own and unless there is severe infection, <br/>
which is highly unlikely anyway, you should leave well enough alone.  Some <br/>
boys are as old as 9 or more before retraction happens.  Usually, they pull <br/>
around enough and just plain grow enough for it to happen sooner but it can <br/>
be late in some boys.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming you chose not to circ your son because you feel he was born <br/>
perfect, as indeed he was, and to avoid unnecessary mutilation of his <br/>
genitals, why would you want to force retraction or allow his doctor to?  In <br/>
essence, and in my opinion, it is simply one small step away from the <br/>
surgery itself.  Unnecessary, incredibly painful and just downright cruel.<br/>
<br/>
My advice would be to not worry about it forever.  Really.  So long as he is <br/>
healthy, no problem.  If he does present a problem, he&#39;ll let you know!<br/>
<br/>

She is an amazing healer and has changed my life with what she&#39;s taught me about health but she definately has some major blind spots.

<br/>
&lt;&lt;As I am reading these Sex ed. posts my 6 and 3 yr. old boys are watching<br/>
the movie &quot;Microcosmos&quot; in which amazing super close- up photography shows<br/>
animals eating, carrying, metamorphosizing (caterpillar into butterfly)and<br/>
mating!  At one point two snails were shown mating accompanied by opera<br/>
(pretty incredible sight) and my son asked what they were doing.  I said I<br/>
thought that they were either dancing or making babies.  I found myself<br/>
holding my breath as I waited for the next question and there wasn&#39;t one.<br/>
But I do think they will probably learn through watching animals since they<br/>
are so fascinated by anything animal.  You have to borow or rent this movie!<br/>
It&#39;s amazing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOL!!!! That is just too funny. Just now as I was tucking Sierra into bed<br/>
tonight, she was telling me about these two snails that her and Joseph saw<br/>
that were stuck together. She was asking me what they could be doing. I said<br/>
I wasn&#39;t sure but probably mating. Which led her to mention the FL lovebugs<br/>
we all had flying around us last month and then on cycles where animals have<br/>
certain times they mate. She kept asking about these snails and well, I&#39;m<br/>
not real up on snail sex!!<br/>
