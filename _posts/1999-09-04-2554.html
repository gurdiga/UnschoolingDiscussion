 </span></blockquote>It occurred to me that maybe your boys are in a processing mode.  <br/>
Sometimes,  when it seems that nothing much is happening,  what is <br/>
going on,  is internal processing of information already taken in.  <br/>
When this period passes, it can seem like they&#39;ve made a giant leap <br/>
ahead.  Just something to consider.......<br/>
<br/>
Also, do you ever journal their activities?  Sometimes this helps me <br/>
to see how much is actually going on.  I don&#39;t enjoy it and neither <br/>
does my son,  but we&#39;re trying to get better at it as we&#39;re faced <br/>
with the high school years and need to log in some way or another.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Ball Z phase passed here and I don&#39;t know if much was <br/>
learned from it.  I do know that he normally hates to write anything, <br/>
but he did a lot of writing for the role-playing game so I guess I <br/>
won&#39;t complain about that.  I wonder if the difference is that you <br/>
have two boys who enjoy playing with each other whereas with my <br/>
daughter in college, it&#39;s only my son and I unschooling.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
have anyone to play games like that with during the day, so he does <br/>
other things.  I&#39;ve always thought that homeschooling more than one <br/>
at a time had lots of advantages,  and I still think it does.  But <br/>
maybe this is one of the advantages of homeschooling one.<br/>
How wonderful though,  that your boys have each other, and that <br/>
because of homeschooling, they&#39;re more apt to remain close.<br/>

Thanks for your response.  The boys have always been homeschooled, at first <br/>
school at home, then, after 6 years, we have progressed to eclectic.  The <br/>
thing is, what they do, ie, DBZ doesn&#39;t&#39; progress a lot, what it did progress <br/>
to, is long ago, and we are not moving on that I can see.  They both play <br/>
keyboard and guitar, take weekly private lessons, and have at least 2 weekly <br/>
one hour bands, plus practice everyday.  I know that they are learning, and I <br/>

Now I&#39;m jealous.  How I wish ds would still draw.  I think he reached <br/>
the age where if he couldn&#39;t do it perfect, he didn&#39;t want to do it.<br/>
When he was drawing,  we found a really neat book.  There was a guy - <br/>
Mark Kistler, I think - who used to do a drawing show on PBS.  Maybe <br/>
he still does.  I think it was called something like Imagination <br/>
Station.  Anyway,  he has done a couple of books teaching 3-D drawing <br/>
- includes a lot of cartoon, castles, etc.  It might be right up you <br/>

&lt;&lt; Let&#39;s define progress. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Lisa,<br/>
regarding the progress with learning from Dragon Ball Z.  There is no role <br/>
play writing, there is only playing.  I have suggested writing a &quot;script&quot; no <br/>
go, They do play the characters, and can quote each program by heart.  My <br/>
youngest will draw for hours, his favorite characters from the show.  I was <br/>
excited, enrolled him in art class.  The teacher had a pear for them to draw <br/>
the first week.  He drew a 4inch pear, and then filled the page with dbz <br/>
characters.  It didn&#39;t get a lot better the rest of the course.  He only <br/>
wants to draw one thing.  So, I let him.  Pokemon, they have the gameboy, <br/>
game, guide and cards.  Again, the guide taught them map, maze reading, hand <br/>
eye co ordination, logic, reasoning.  This is all good, I see the benefit, <br/>
but, now what? That is what I am trying to figure out for myself, <br/>

Thanks for the info.  I have gotten them lots of books from the library, and <br/>
we were having a ball with cartooning site on line, It is really good.  He <br/>
just stopped after  we went to the art class, lost all interest for about 3 <br/>
months,  thank goodness he has recently picked it back up, but, it is still <br/>
dbz characters.  He is VERY creative, and I think something in the arts is <br/>
where he will be, I just keep checking things out of the library and looking <br/>
on the net.  Don&#39;t think I will try another art class for a LOOONG time! LOL<br/>

there was at least one other person with him.  He supplies all the sound <br/>
affects and dialogue.  He is really talented, maybe I should just put a tape <br/>
recorder in the room!  But I try to tell them that they need to learn to put <br/>
down on paper what they do, sot they can keep it, or share it, no go so far!  <br/>
I know they are smart, and are learning, but it just seems that we are stuck <br/>
here on play, and the same play everyday.  <br/>

Look in your phone book under gaming stores, or any B. Dalton should have <br/>
several different role playing systems. Depending on your children&#39;s age: <br/>
GURPS is a good system where anything is possible, but rather complex. I am a <br/>
die-hard Advanced Dungeons and Dragons person myself, and it is more <br/>
simplistic. All you should need is a players handbook and some creativity! <br/>

Have you heard of resistance?  It is what happens when people attempt to &quot;get&quot;<br/>
other people to do things that they might not want to do.  They resist.  It takes<br/>
many forms.  One of the finest ways to get into power struggles is to insist on<br/>
an &quot;educational &quot; angle on otherwise enjoyable activities. They&#39;ll put stuff down<br/>
on paper when it makes sense to them to put stuff down on paper.  Deep breath<br/>
in.  Long exhalation.  Again.  Relax.  Your kids are sharp as tacks and will do<br/>
fine give them room, lots of room and stay close very close.  I know it sounds<br/>
Zenish and it is rather. Have faith.<br/>

them have rather mature themes and like I mentioned before,  lots of <br/>

Role-playing games became a source of concern for a lot of families <br/>

separating reality from fanatasy.  Of course,  just as many adults <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No,  I know ds has been role-playing in one form or another since <br/>
then.  Especially - if you&#39;re willing to play,  you could help them <br/>
out with anything that was too difficult.  Once you see how they <br/>
work,  you might decide to just make up your own.  I&#39;ve known other <br/>
unschoolers that did this to cover certain historic periods, etc.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Also, do you ever journal their activities?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
Sorry it took me so long to reply to your post, I left all the posts that I <br/>
needed to respond to, for a time when I could think about what I wanted to <br/>
say, and then forgot which ones I had responded to !<br/>
<br/>
No, I haven&#39;t done this, but, just by posting what my boys do in general, I <br/>
see that they do a lot.  I will try the notebook and journal .  <br/>

It is true that the boys do have a great advantage of being together, they do <br/>
role play, but not write.  I have always thought that it would be great to <br/>
have 4 or 5 kids in the hs group.  You can do those huge Konos projects.  I <br/>
need to co-op with someone!  LOL.  <br/>
