<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067316782"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; What started this entire thread was a new person stating that they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>expected<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; criticism because they KNEW they weren&#39;t doing everything right yet and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>then<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; someone else added they don&#39;t feel this is a safe place to ask questions<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are VALID to them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When someone posts for the first time saying that they *expect* criticism,<br/>
they usually get it.  It&#39;s confrontational.  If you expect criticism, why<br/>
post?  Especially when you&#39;re not even asking a question.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe some of the exact same advice should to like well, if you don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; the fact that a new family isn&#39;t completely doing the unschooling your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>way,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be quiet and READ, wait for them to post, WAIT for them to ASK a question,<br/>
&gt; get to know what they NEED from you as a part of the group, THEN offer<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; advice on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would be fine, except that ignoring a post that says it&#39;s ok to<br/>
partially unschool gives that idea validity to some people reading the list<br/>
and might make that person&#39;s transition to unschooling take much longer than<br/>
it needs to.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The only thing I&#39;ve figured out is forget it, don&#39;t talk about it, ask a<br/>
&gt; specific question take the answer or don&#39;t.  Don&#39;t expect it the answer to<br/>
&gt; sound kind and loving because no one is owed kindness or loving or maybe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are just &quot;reading&quot; the words too hatefully your own self.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Like it or leave it, this is it.  There are mothers here who know the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>deal,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they&#39;ve lived it, they&#39;ve proved it works their way and there is only one<br/>
&gt; true way to unschool and they can show you that way but only if you are<br/>
&gt; willing to do what they say and forget all your preconceived notions about<br/>
&gt; what unschooling might mean to you.  It doesn&#39;t work any other way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;By George, I think she&#39;s got it.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  (My Fair Lady for those who don&#39;t<br/>
recognize it.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again for all the useful info and I think this thread was helpful<br/>
 </span></blockquote>too.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  It helped explore the dynamics and gave a glimpse into human nature and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it works.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good.  I just wish we didn&#39;t have to do it so often.  %^ (<br/>
