<div id="ygrps-yiv-740090577">My son also loves Soccer, and Rock cliaming.  Help your child find the<br/>
resourse for something like that is to be expected.  Your gradening problems<br/>
are bunnies, mine are deer, want to trade?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It is fun to observe birds and plants, but not that much fun. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s to bad your kids feel this way, my kids love it!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;He &quot;entertained&quot;us that evening with lots of information about  the<br/>
heavens, and I&#39;m soglad he did...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think your trying to take the point to an extreme!  maybe you should read<br/>
posts a little more carefully, this is the 2nd time you&#39;ve missed and<br/>
important point of a post in 2 days.  I did say it&#39;s fine to do stuff here<br/>
and there, just not provide entertainment all the time!  You don&#39;t need to<br/>
spend tons of money to unschool, you don&#39;t need to run to the musuem weekly,<br/>
you don&#39;t have to go go go, all you have to do it live.<br/>

responded to your exact words. <br/>

<br/>
And there&#39;s a lot of gray between &quot;here and there&quot; and &quot;all the time&quot;.<br/>
