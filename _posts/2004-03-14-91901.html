Your post could&#39;ve been mine!<br/>
<br/>
We live the same way.  I lifestyle of learning, that includes<br/>
a little bit of everything and anything that God so brings<br/>
into our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting.  I&#39;m in Florida too. S. Florida.<br/>

&gt; my kids, they see from &quot;how&quot; my husband and I live, and NOT from what<br/>
&gt; we &quot;teach&quot;.<br/>
&gt; So if you are new to unschooling, try not to exclude yourself from<br/>
&gt; others based on their or your religion.<br/>
&gt; Personally, we hang out w/ lots of different types of people that<br/>
&gt; have varying beliefs and religions. Of course living in FL helps w/<br/>
&gt; that as it&#39;s a very diverse state.<br/>

&gt; Hi Nancy,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We live in Central Fl. and we love it! Orlando on one side, Daytona <br/>
on the other, so we have lots to choose from.Bike Week just ended. <br/>
Unfortunately at this time, my dh and I are w/out a bike. Hoping to <br/>
change that soon! :)<br/>
When it&#39;s warmer (80 and up lOl) we can usually be found at the <br/>
beach! :)<br/>
What part of S. Fl are you in?<br/>
