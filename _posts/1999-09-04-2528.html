You know, I read this, and the rest of your response, and I think that is so <br/>
great.  But I don&#39;t understand it.  The bones of it.  Do you just get up in <br/>
the morning and say, &quot;what do you want to do today?&quot; Or do you just get up in <br/>
the morning?  All summer, I let the boys pretty much do what they wanted, I <br/>
asked them to practice their music everyday, and read 30 min. a day.  They <br/>
did that, and then played with their Dragon Ball Z action characters the rest <br/>
of the time.  Now, they don&#39;t even want to read, just play.  Do I guide by <br/>
saying, you  do music, reading and something that you choose, or what?  I <br/>
know I am dense at this, I have been reading the list, asking questions, <br/>
getting good answers, but it isn&#39;t really going well.  Given a choice, they <br/>
just want to play, and while I know that games teach some things, they have <br/>
learned what the games have to offer already, and are not moving on.  My 5th <br/>
grader is learning to enjoy reading, but only because I made him read this <br/>
summer.  I let him buy a book of his choice, on a subject he wanted, and we <br/>
went from there, also Harry Potter helped a lot!  But, If I hadn&#39;t made him, <br/>
and believe me, they have always been read to, and see me read all the time, <br/>
he still wouldn&#39;t be reading, cause that&#39;s boring.  Wait, he can read, he <br/>
just never said I am going to my room to read a book.  So,  to make a long <br/>
story even longer, I am reluctant to let go.  Guess I have the control streak <br/>
in me from my mom.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be so long, but geesh, I am kinda frustrated here<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Teresa, I am pretty new at this also, I had my oldes 13 home from Feb on<br/>
last year and right away adopted unschooling, and have become even more<br/>
relaxed about it since, we usually start our day with picking up then<br/>
discovery school that runs and hour or two on the discovery channel, they<br/>
usually like this because  they get tokick back and relax while they watch<br/>
it,  I am still trying to relax more, I do say things like  here is the<br/>
deal, as long as you are doing something to  expand your brain I will leave<br/>
you alone ( building with legos, reading, workpages if they like them ,<br/>
workbooks if they want, writing letters, using computer, geosafari,  play a<br/>
cooperative game, puzzles,  mind teaser puzzles , educational t.v. or<br/>
videos, ect..... )  If you are just laying around doing nothing or fighting<br/>
or claiming you are bored, I can fix that , you will do extra chores to help<br/>
out! (which is learning in itself!) they have found lots of creative ways to<br/>
keep them selves busy, lately it has been making envelopes out of old<br/>
calandars and pictures they find in magazines, (Mary Ellen of Ohio) taught<br/>
them to make them, so they have been going crazy writing letters to fill<br/>
them!<br/>
I hope this helps you out some the more you watch your kids and listen to<br/>
what they say  the more you will realize that there is learning in<br/>
everything that they do!<br/>
today my daughter is calling every music store in the area and asking about<br/>
violins!<br/>
 I have an online business, and the kids are talking about starting their<br/>
own page on the mall and splitting the cost of getting started and then<br/>
splitting the proffit from it, I think this would be a great math learning<br/>
for them!  we shall see,<br/>
<br/>
good luck to you and we would like to hear more about how you are doing!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Are things any better? &gt;&gt;<br/>
Lisa,<br/>
In all honesty, I don&#39;t know.  I am trying to just let things be, and let the <br/>
boys decide what they want to do.  They want to play. They want to play <br/>
dragon ball Z .  Same as before.  I am using scrabble, and Life, as well as <br/>
reading the book of their choice.  Some things seem to go better, youngest <br/>
asked to learn to type so he is doing that and oldest decided that if <br/>
youngest cold do it, he could too, so now he is going into chat rooms and <br/>
uses that to practice, cause I told him he had to type correctly to talk, no <br/>
hunt and peck.  So, as they are interested in that, they are learning.  And I <br/>
see the light there, however, I still worry about the math, and just remember <br/>
that on their last evaluation, the evaluator told me that he couldn&#39;t do this <br/>
year what he did last year, and I know he could, because we had worked on it <br/>
for the month before the evaluation.  In the past, he had always done Saxon, <br/>
and was way ahead of himself.  Last year, we were relaxed, I didn&#39;t force <br/>
times tables, he used the key series, and it was not a good math evaluation.  <br/>
So I know that is what is bothering me, not that he isn&#39;t where he would be <br/>
if in school, compared to other kids, just that he wasn&#39;t advancing and I am <br/>
concerned that there may be a problem with the next evaluation causing him <br/>
not to be able to homeschool.  I know he was advancing, she didn&#39;t even test <br/>
him on the fractions that he had been working on, but, he froze or something, <br/>
cause he couldn&#39;t borrow or carry, and he has been doing that for two years.  <br/>
We do things so haphazard, that I feel disorganized, and that bothers me, I <br/>
can&#39;t really &quot;see&quot; that they are learning.  <br/>
So, to answer the question, I don&#39;t know, I am still working and trying, but <br/>
I will probably have to go to some kind of outline or plan for the day, <br/>
giving them a freedom of choice of what they want to accomplish for the day <br/>
or the week or something.  <br/>
Hmmmmmmm, still sounds like the original post doesn&#39;t it?  <br/>

<br/>
    After 2 years of homeschooling with textbooks and worksheets, this summer <br/>
I was ready to throw in the towel. I took the kids to the public school to <br/>
take their placement tests. The tests were held in the library, which was <br/>
full of kids from summer school classes. I was sat in the corner, away from <br/>
the kids so I wouldn&#39;t influence them. My daughter, age 6, had never been to <br/>
public school before. After all the testing was done, the principal told me <br/>
that she had not passed the state requirements for moving on to the first <br/>
grade. When I looked at the material, I realized she certainly did know this <br/>
information, we had worked on it for a year! When I went over the same test <br/>
with her at home, she aced it. But the school would not consider giving her <br/>
the test again. So, to make a long story short, because of this and the <br/>
teacher threatening my son that she would, &quot;Whoop his ass&quot; on the first day <br/>
of summer school (corporal punishment is legal in TX) we have moved on to <br/>
unschooling this year. The whole point of my story is to reassure you that <br/>
when &quot;THEY&quot; say your child does not know it and you know they do, you are <br/>
right! You, as a parent, know best! Blessings, Lori in TX</div>

 </span></blockquote>This is very interesting. Did you see your daughter&#39;s test script?  I once <br/>
got into a panic and wondered whether to send my younger son to Junior High <br/>
school. He had always found math very easy, both at home and when he was in <br/>
school, so he went to take the placement test for the accelerated math group <br/>
(the other students had already taken it).  I did not hear from the school <br/>
afterwards and eventually, at the end of the semester, rang the counselor <br/>
(who, I might add, had been less than friendly in our initial contact). She <br/>
disappeared for ages, but eventually returned to the phone and said that he <br/>
had not passed the test. When I asked whether she knew why, she said somewhat <br/>
curtly that she didn&#39;t know - the math teacher had simply said he did not <br/>
pass.  She did not offer to let me speak to the math teacher herself. <br/>
<br/>
I knew that if he was not in the accelerated math group he would probably get <br/>
bored and lose interest in math.  And that tipped the balance for me, as far <br/>
as continuing to homeschool was concerned.  Homeschooling is definitely right <br/>
for him.  But I&#39;ve often wondered whether that counselor couldn&#39;t find the <br/>
math teacher, or didn&#39;t want homeschooling to have been successful and simply <br/>
made up the tale that he&#39;d failed.......<br/>

Actually, the Principal was very friendly and accomidating, at least until <br/>
the teacher threatened my son! They sent the actual test home with us and <br/>
were quite willing to work with us on acclimating the kids with the setup of <br/>
public school. The problem was that my daughter was in a library full of <br/>
kids, is quite shy and had never before taken a test. So, in this case <br/>
anyway, it was &quot;performance anxiety&quot; I believe. <br/>
