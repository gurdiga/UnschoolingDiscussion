<div id="ygrps-yiv-89558076">When I try to read a chapter book to my 7yo, the 3yo starts getting really <br/>
restless and agitated, to the point of yelling, &quot;I hate (name of book -- at <br/>
the moment it is, you guessed it, Harry Potter),&quot; throwing stuff around, <br/>
whining for food, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I find I get through about two sentences between the interruptions.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else deal with this, and how? I have resorted to sending the 3yo <br/>
to his room, but I kind of hate to punish him around books, for fear he&#39;ll <br/>
develop bad associations and so on.<br/>
<br/>
They have the same bedtime and the 3yo usually doesn&#39;t nap, so he&#39;s <br/>
basically around, and conscious, all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924073205">I have this problem sometimes with videos, I say, &#39; I know you <br/>
don&#39;t like it, this is what we&#39;re doing now, so you can choose, stay <br/>
and listen, or find something else, quiet, to do.&#39;  I think 3yo is old <br/>
enough to understand this, also if you&#39;re doing this you need to <br/>
make time with the little &#39;un too.  (Now if I can only remember <br/>
these wise words, when I&#39;m dealing with mine &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div><font color="#000080" size="2">I have two kids, age 10 and 6.&nbsp; Usually I 
read to them separately - my 10 year old daughter is into Harry Potter and 
living history types of books, while my 6 year old son likes non-fiction books 
(trains, cars, planes, ships, etc.).&nbsp; During the summer, we&#39;re at a camp 
where they share a room and I have to read to them together.&nbsp; I usually 
read the 6yo&#39;s story first - lately he&#39;s into Tintin, which is like an oversized 
comic book, so the pictures hold his attention.&nbsp; Then while I read to the 
10yo, he listens while either looking through another book or playing quietly 
with toys.&nbsp; He may not seem to be paying attention, but he&#39;ll often ask me 
questions relating to the story, so I know he&#39;s hearing it.</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-795084427">Thanks Cathie, Corallyn, Tracey and all others who had suggestions on how a <br/>
7- and 3-yo could occupy the same room while I&#39;m reading to the older one!<br/>
<br/>
The suggestion that worked best was to read the 3yo a story first, and then <br/>
let him play with play-doh or look at books while the 7yo and I delve into <br/>
chapter books. We&#39;re fairly happy with that arrangment, or at least as happy <br/>
as these inveterate rivals can be. (SIGH)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to try a version of this for when the 7yo and I play board games <br/>
-- a game with the little guy first, and then something for him to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Annette<br/>
