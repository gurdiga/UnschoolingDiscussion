<div id="ygrps-yiv-21986001">I, too, would love to know other homeschoolers who have been at it for<br/>
awhile.  This list is the closest I can get to that, though.  (And it&#39;s<br/>
pretty darned helpful!)  Still, I&#39;d love to go to the conference...sigh...<br/>

Aren&#39;t you in Oregon, Andrea? Eugene maybe? I don&#39;t always connect <br/>
names and posts, so forgive me if I got that wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are....I&#39;m in Corvallis and there are several <br/>
unschooling veterans here that you can spend some time with. Here&#39;s a <br/>
link to some of my writing. That will give you an idea of who I am <br/>
and where I&#39;ve been. I love sharing with new unschoolers.<br/>

Thanks Mary!  I was in Oregon--Portland.  But for the moment I&#39;m on the<br/>
Washington coast, just across the Columbia from Astoria.  Maybe sometime I<br/>
could make it down your way for a visit though.  I do have some friends I<br/>
like to see from time in Silverton.  Also, my husband and I have been<br/>
considering Corvallis as a place to try and buy some land.  I appreciate the<br/>
invitation to spend some time with some other Oregon Unschoolers.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know when I could do that, but think I could sometime in the next few weeks.<br/>
In the meantime, I&#39;ll check out the link you shared with me.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks again!<br/>
