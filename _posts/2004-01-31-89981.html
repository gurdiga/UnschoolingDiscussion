<div id="ygrps-yiv-177601837">LOL My house is ALIVE...with the sound of MUSIC! The deed is done...Sarah now has her guitar, and Logan has a drum. <br/>
 <br/>
I get to order my flute shortly! Can&#39;t wait! I&#39;ve found all of the recorders, and tomorrow we&#39;re going to go get a small bondo drum set and one of those band-in-a-box things with cymbals, clapper, triangle and rhythm sticks; and a set of jingle bells. <br/>
