Hi Julie!  DO you mind if i jump in and ask a question?  Not very mannerly of <br/>
me to pounce on you!  We are planning more children, but have one for now, a <br/>
three year old boy.  We may not have more children for a while, and i <br/>
wondered if you could share a little about HS/US with larger age ranges.  <br/>
Thank you so much, and welcome to the list!<br/>
