<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672420360">Kak only affects those using Outlook Express. It exploits a known security <br/>
loophole. And it doesn&#39;t work if you have active scripting turned off.  (If <br/>
you don&#39;t know what that means, don&#39;t panic - I didn&#39;t either. The web site I <br/>
give below will help.)<br/>
<br/>
Once you&#39;ve been infected, every email you send out has the worm attached. <br/>
But if you&#39;re a non-techie without a virus detector, you don&#39;t know that <br/>
until somebody tells you.  That&#39;s what happened to me, anyway.   Fortunately <br/>
some of the people who received emails from me had virus detectors that <br/>
picked it up. I still don&#39;t even know how I got it.  (Incidentally, this <br/>
message is from a different email account and not written using OE.  :-))<br/>
<br/>
Kak doesn&#39;t do devastating damage, but it is obviously something  you don&#39;t <br/>
want.  If you use Outlook Express, you&#39;d be well advised to do a search of <br/>
your directory, to see whether there are any Kak files in there. (Don&#39;t <br/>
delete them until you&#39;ve read up about it, because one is something else. See <br/>
below.)  There is a very informative page on the web, that explains all about <br/>
it, how to get rid of it, and how to get to the Microsoft patch to close the <br/>
loophole.  The address  was given by the listowner of the list to which I <br/>
sent an infected email.<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s an extract from the page:-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; The worm uses a known security vulnerability in Outlook Express. Once<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the user receives an infected email message, and opens or views the<br/>
message in the preview pane, the worm creates a file &quot;kak.hta&quot; to the<br/>
Windows Startup directory.<br/>
<br/>
Next time when the system is restarted, the worm activates. It replaces<br/>
&quot;c:&#92;autoexec.bat&quot; with a batch file that deletes the worm<br/>
from the Startup directory. The original &quot;autoexec.bat&quot; is copied to<br/>
&quot;C:&#92;AE.KAK&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It also modifies the message signature settings of Outlook Express<br/>
5.0 replacing the current signature with an infected file,<br/>
&quot;C:&#92;Windows&#92;kak.htm&quot;.<br/>
Therefore every message sent with Outlook Express after that will<br/>
contain the worm.&lt;&lt;<br/>
