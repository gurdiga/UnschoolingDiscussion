Boy, this was an eye-opener for me.  I realized that I wanted my kids to be<br/>
perfect, not make mistakes, be grumpy, be forgiving, be ideal.  It has sure<br/>
taken the pressure off now that we can just be us.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Why not start by trying to be the person you want them to be?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy, this was an eye-opener for me.  I realized that I wanted my kids to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; perfect, not make mistakes, be grumpy, be forgiving, be ideal.  It has<br/>
sure<br/>
&gt; taken the pressure off now that we can just be us.<br/>

Will this work on the hubby too???The more I nag the less he does. I think I<br/>
need to have  a more positive attitude and keep going . Maybe eventually he<br/>
come around. Starting to realize what I have been put him through. Good<br/>
thing he is forgiving!<br/>
