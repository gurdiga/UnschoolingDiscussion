<div id="ygrps-yiv-170046557">It&#39;s refreshing to hear &quot;christian&quot; homeschoolers on this list who have a<br/>
more liberal view on things.  Sometimes I feel like there is only one type<br/>
of christian...the fundamentalist type!  My stomach turns when I hear about<br/>
some of the practices of fundamentalists - smacking their infants to teach<br/>
them to stay on the blanket, etc.  There was an interesting article in the<br/>
lastest Homeschool Educator Magazine.  The article was about how christian<br/>
homeschoolers are being targeted as abusive parents.  I&#39;m not so sure this<br/>
isn&#39;t true.<br/>
