 </span></blockquote>Speaking of Pat Conroy, his &quot;The Water is Wide&quot; later made into the movie <br/>
&quot;Conrack&quot; is a great homeschooling movie, I would say.  Shows a teacher <br/>
trying to go in and change the system, teach kids using alternative methods, <br/>
then being thrown out because he doesn&#39;t fit in their mold.  Loved both of <br/>
them.  (BIG Pat Conroy Fan!!)<br/>

trails....stories within stories....feels like it will never end (and that&#39;s <br/>
a good thing with this book!!)<br/>
