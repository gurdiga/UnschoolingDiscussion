<br/>
Dogs have a different pH. Pert and Ivory are made for humans and our skins. <br/>
You are burning the top layer of skin off---especially on those tiny puppies. <br/>
Expect some itching and scratching in a day or two. <br/>
<br/>
Spend your $$ on GOOD dog shampoos. I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll all LOVE an oatmeal <br/>
shampoo when their skins start to flake off!<br/>

Then I&#39;ll say in the years of dog grooming I have done and years of grooming<br/>
my own dogs, I have never had a problem with using Ivory. It&#39;s just what I<br/>
have found in my own experience with my dogs and many many others.<br/>

on several dog groomer/breeder/trainer type web sites and also from a clerk <br/>
at Petsmart ( that does NOT sell Pert, but does sell $$$ dog shampoo)      <br/>
Worked like a charm on the fleas too.. OH OH, I just thought of something!!.. I <br/>
didnt use &quot;straight&quot; shampoo.  The clerk said to mix it with puppy shampoo... <br/>
About a 4 to 1 ratio.  So, maybe pure Pert might might them itch.<br/>

the fleas, but the fact that fleas can&#39;t swim and they drown? I <br/>
always thought flea killing shampoo wasn&#39;t necessary?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you take a flea and put it in a cup of water, and make sure it is <br/>
submerged, yeah, it will die.  But they can swim at the surface for a long time, and <br/>
if you are just washing them off into the grass, they will most likely survive <br/>
and jump back on the dog.  It&#39;s not the water that kills them, it&#39;s the flea <br/>
shampoo or dip.<br/>

<br/>
Francodex makes a good oatmeal shampoo. The best quality human shampoo is not <br/>
as good as (almost) the worst quality dog shampoo. I&#39;d shy away from *really* <br/>
cheap dog shampoos---but there are MANY reasonably priced ones that do a <br/>
great job--and don&#39;t burn the skin. I like the oatmeals for sensitive dogs and <br/>
puppies.<br/>

    I know how you feel. LOL! I&#39;m caught up until I collect again. &lt;BG&gt; Oh 6<br/>
digests! &gt;g&gt; I&#39;ll try to get to that personality thing in the morning.<br/>
    Thanks for the tip. No problems yet this year. I think I started the<br/>
Garlic/ Brewers Yeast early enough to avoid it all this year I hope. :-)<br/>
