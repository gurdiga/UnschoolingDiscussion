The bathing thing got to me, and he refused to wash his hair for awhile. I <br/>
recently found some foaming shampoo, which has made a huge difference. (I&#39;m <br/>
trying not to think about all the synthetic junk in it :)) And the little <br/>
mirror in the tub has helped too.<br/>

But now his teeth, since I&#39;ve let loose the reins, so to speak, he NEVER <br/>
wants to brush them. Once a day is lucky. Once every two or three is more <br/>
like it. I just can&#39;t stand this, and I really worry about his teeth <br/>
developing properly, esp since he&#39;s so young. Recently I&#39;ve gone back to <br/>
demanding. At least once a day I&#39;ll insists that he brush them, and it gets <br/>
really harry sometimes. I&#39;ve tried 3 different kinds of toothpaste, bought <br/>
really cool toothbrushes, doesn&#39;t seem to matter. <br/>

inherit our lousy teeth and had to have the top 4 front ones pulled just <br/>
before age 2.  Heather insisted on brushing for a long time, but it seemed <br/>
to be making Skye dig in more on the issue.  She finally let it <br/>
go.  Recently, as Skye is about to turn 7, she has been brushing her teeth <br/>
voluntarily.  I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s going to last, but we can <br/>
hope.  One thing that made it more appealing was buying and electric <br/>
toothbrush.  I&#39;m just glad Lars inherited his father&#39;s good teeth.  He just <br/>
had a checkup and still no cavities at age 14.  Whew!<br/>

to...<br/>
<br/>
Does he have to brush his teeth in the bathroom? Could<br/>
you bring hin his toothbrush and a bowl to spit in. A<br/>
minimum of toothpaste swallowing isn&#39;t going to hurt<br/>
him. That&#39;s what we do with out kids esp. my dd. She<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to stop what she is doing. When she is<br/>
brushing her teeth she is being read to or watching a<br/>
video so she brushes for a long time. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

root into the bloodstream.  Plus, I think she was in a lot of pain over <br/>
them.  They put her under anesthetic at the hospital to pull them, so it <br/>
wasn&#39;t as traumatic as it might have been.<br/>
<br/>
While her teeth are not great, and she&#39;s had a couple more small cavities, <br/>
those were the only really bad ones.  Heather believes that it could have <br/>
been caused either by a bad fever she had while pregnant (when the teeth <br/>
were developing) or when Skye was really sick around a year or 18 months old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573525923">Do you brush your own teeth in the same room and at the same time your<br/>
three-year-old does? It sometimes helps with our two-and-a-half-year-old <br/>
he will occasionally see me brushing and want to do it, too.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that I forget and do it in the morning when hes off playing<br/>
in the other room, and at night I like to stay up after him and have a<br/>
midnight snack, so he almost never sees me do it then. It occurs to me now<br/>
that theres no real reason he should ever have figured out that we grownups<br/>
brush our teeth twice a day. So its no wonder he doesnt see it as a<br/>
natural, inevitable part of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Our record on this is even worse than yours, but so far theres been no<br/>
decay the doctor has noticed (we havent been to the dentist yet). Our son<br/>
doesnt eat any dried fruit, and hardly ever any candy, though I know there<br/>
are lots of other things that stick just as badly (I would guess Cheerios<br/>
are pretty hard on the teeth, for example  we dont eat them anymore).<br/>
<br/>
Ive toyed with wiping off his teeth with a washcloth, but he doesnt like<br/>
that much, either.<br/>
<br/>
Im hoping its true that long-term breastfeeding helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is very important in our household. I bring out toothbrushes in the evening<br/>
and they brush wherever they are. Preschoolers don&#39;t usually spit anyway, so it<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter where they are. Now that I&#39;m remembering to come brush where the<br/>
kids are, they&#39;re getting a lot better about doing it or letting me. Last year I<br/>
got an electric toothbrush and recently I noticed the kids brushing by just<br/>
holding the toothbrushes in their mouths like you do with an electric. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t cut it. What I do now is brush with a manual toothbrush in the evening<br/>
before the kids go to bed, then with the electric when I head to bed.  I&#39;m still<br/>
working on getting a habit going in the morning, though.<br/>
<br/>

front teeth, so it&#39;s not a guarantee. It&#39;s certainly not the threat that<br/>
bottlefeeding is, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638171545">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to solve the whole problem, but the toothpaste does<br/>
have to be something they don&#39;t hate. Switching from kids&#39; to regular<br/>
toothpaste was part of what caused problems with my kids. They had gotten used<br/>
to the kids flavor from the dentist&#39;s office sample but I had the attitude<br/>
(handed down from my parents) that kids don&#39;t NEED special toothpaste, they can<br/>
use ours fine. Well, sure they CAN, but they don&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t want to use the same techniques to force them to brush that my<br/>
parents did, because I STILL hate to brush my teeth, and have a lot of problems<br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess I&#39;m emotional about this because of my teeth. My ds has great<br/>
teeth but my dd has problems already and she&#39;s not 2 yet. :-(<br/>

would let her pick a new toothbrush or new toothpaste practically every time <br/>
we went to the store, but after a day or two, she would say she didn&#39;t like <br/>
them.  Two things helped us:    We stopped using toothpaste, and would brush <br/>
with just water.  We felt it was better than nothing, and since it was the <br/>
toothpaste she objected to she went along.  Then one day I received a sample <br/>
sized adult toothpaste, mint flavored.  She seized upon this small tube and <br/>
used it all the time.  We had tried all the flavors before, even mint, but <br/>
now in the small size she loved it.  I started buying the sample and travel <br/>
sizes and she used them all.  As I said before, she is now 5, and she will <br/>
use any toothpaste.  Hope this helps.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4239942">I have probably been negligent about our son&#39;s toothbrushing because of my<br/>
childhood experiences - we will see how the great experiment of not forcing<br/>
him turns out. As I said in another post, he brushes very infrequently (and<br/>
since he swallows some of what he&#39;s supposed to spit out, I don&#39;t give him<br/>
toothpaste).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what my mother did when we were as small as my son is now<br/>
(2-1/2), but I remember that later in childhood she would send my brother<br/>
and me to brush in the bathroom while she stayed in the living room (it<br/>
seemed to me then that she always picked the best moment of my favorite TV<br/>
show to decide it couldn&#39;t wait).<br/>
<br/>
My brother and I would wet the brushes under the faucet, put them back, take<br/>
a small amount of toothpaste and smear it somewhere inside our mouths with<br/>
the tip of a finger, rinse out and go back to her. She would then sniff our<br/>
breaths and feel satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
We had a fair number of cavities as kids - don&#39;t know whether this is why<br/>
(genetics and nutrition are other factors, of course). I just remember<br/>

I don&#39;t know about my brother&#39;s adult brushing habits, but I have a<br/>
