 </span></blockquote>Ooh, ooh, ooh... *I&#39;d* pull a banner behind my plane if someone hired me to<br/>
fly it across the country to advertise the conference!<br/>

Who can fly, but can&#39;t afford the fuel to get there! Let&#39;s see, 12 gallons<br/>
an hour, 140 mph, 3,000+ miles, that&#39;s over $500 just in gas. Um, my bill<br/>
for banner-pulling is $500 :-)<br/>
Really wishing I could be there, obviously.</div>
