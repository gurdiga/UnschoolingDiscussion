&gt; some kids (for whatever mental or social reasons) might NEVER hang out at <br/>
&gt; home reading and playing and learning.  And in those families, unschooling <br/>
&gt; would not work.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, I know this isn&#39;t what the thread was about, but I&#39;ve been wanting to ask <br/>
this for awhile. I&#39;ve read so much about how lots and lots of things I <br/>
previously would have considered not learning, really are. And how setting <br/>
arbitrary guidelines and routines is actually better than worse, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So, to ease some of my own fears and insecurities, could someone please <br/>
explain how unschooling won&#39;t work?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303997626">Yes. When the parents are totally disengaged from the child and are either at<br/>
work or doing their mashed potato act. I had a friend who did this. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling, it was neglect. The boy was being raised by the TV and the dog. When<br/>
he got to go to school it was a great improvement for him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about if the parent had such a bad, sad school experience that they never<br/>
recovered any joy in learning?<br/>
<br/>
That would be a formidable block to happy and productive unschooling.<br/>
