<div id="ygrps-yiv-870839826">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Just a note to reconnect with the list. I have 3 kids, all who have been home<br/>
with me living and learning. We had a tough year last year, with my oldest<br/>
almost 8 year old being fussy and her brother bugging her. She asked and asked<br/>
to go to school. So I signed her up. Off she goes every day with her dad and<br/>
the neighborhood kids. She likes the structure her teacher provides. She is<br/>
observing everything. We pick her up at 2:30. Such a radical scedule change<br/>
for me. <br/>
<br/>
Today after school she decided to make a grid and chart all the kids in her<br/>
class. She made categories . Super nice, nice, kinda nice, kinda mean, really<br/>
mean. She wants to see how the kids in her class do for several days. She aked<br/>
for 50 copies of her chart.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting to understand what she needs from school. I see her as an<br/>
unschooled schoolgirl. Being a schoolgirl is her passion right now. She is<br/>
living, breathing school. She is finding out what she likes and does not like.<br/>
I still cringe when I hear some of the playground attitudes. She is expanding.<br/>
She is learning how to be alive and in the world without me and she enjoys the<br/>
challenge. Where she would whine with me for being hot, she now is hot,<br/>
uncomfortable, and gets through it. I&#39;m sad still she not with us, and glad<br/>
too she fledging a bit. I see her coming home so glad to be able to strip into<br/>
nothing, curl up in her bed and read, her style. She thinks it&#39;s funny that<br/>
people are asked to read at least 20 minutes each day. Her friends translate<br/>
that to only 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ll go now. I&#39;ve been expanding and growing and surrendering these<br/>
first few school weeks and now I get to panic a bit about 5.5 son and his<br/>
wilds and potty talk and throwing balls at people and grabbing his sisters<br/>
doll. O.K. I know why he does this, I&#39;m talking on the phone. I need to go<br/>
shoot baskets with him, again.<br/>
<br/>

Glad she&#39;s seemingly doing so well, Mary H. :) Let us know what that chart <br/>
shows, okay?<br/>

grows up.  She needs kids around her so she can study them! ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I  used to be that way with kids and teachers at school.<br/>
I was forever interviewing them and asking them why.  It&#39;s called &quot;nosey&quot; <br/>
when you&#39;re a kid, not &quot;clinical.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s that way with other families.  I guess if she were in school it would <br/>
transfer to teachers and classes, but because she&#39;s not, it&#39;s how parents are <br/>
with their kids, and how kids respond to different kinds of situations.<br/>
<br/>
Now I love to watch her watch other people! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
