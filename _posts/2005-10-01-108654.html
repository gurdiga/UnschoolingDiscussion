<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848519527">My oldest daughter, Roya (20), and I are doing a &quot;talk&quot; together, at  <br/>
the upcoming Live and Learn Conference, in St. Louis, MO.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re supposed to talk about what it has been like, living an  <br/>
unschooling life, together. What worked, what didn&#39;t, what we&#39;d  <br/>
change, what we learned, .....<br/>
<br/>
Although we&#39;ve got some good stuff ready, it would REALLY help us if  <br/>
we could get some input - what I need is for people to ask us  <br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;d like to know what your relationship with your mother and sisters was  <br/>
like at 14, compared to what Roya&#39;s relationship with her mother and sisters was  <br/>
like at 14.  Like maybe you could think of some universal conflict that  <br/>
teenagers face, and how it was handled/thought out by you and your mother, and  <br/>
then by Roya and you.<br/>
 <br/>
Does that make sense?  I know it&#39;s hard to find a &quot;universal&quot; conflict  in <br/>
unschooled kids&#39; lives, because what they would face as schooled kids is  vastly <br/>
different than what they face as unschooled kids....but there has to be  <br/>
something.<br/>

<br/>
That would be a good one, and kind of like one I was thinking, that people <br/>
ask sometimes, which is don&#39;t you get tired of each other?   Do you feel <br/>
crowded?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146669097">Hi Pam, I met you at the HSC conference in Sacramento this year and I<br/>
was in the audience at your Radical Unschooling Talk.  I am a friend of<br/>
Cindi&#39;s from SOCHS.  I was completely moved and changed by your talk.<br/>
Your explanation of what unschooling &quot;is&quot; and what it &quot;isn&#39;t&quot; clarified<br/>
so much for me.  Most importantly it made me realize that we are living<br/>
an unschooled life.  We had reached our goal and now we can get on with<br/>
living.  This was a huge moment for me as I sat listening to you with<br/>
tears in my eyes. <br/>
 <br/>
If you were to talk about some of the same things you did at that<br/>
conference and simply add Roya&#39;s point of view, I suspect that would<br/>
answer a lot of questions that people may have about your life as<br/>
unschoolers and your relationship with each other.  For example, does<br/>
Roya remember your attempt at unit studies and what did she think about<br/>
it?   Also, new unschoolers always love to hear about the personal<br/>
journey towards unschooling and the moment that you took that &quot;leap of<br/>
faith&quot;.  Does Roya remember this journey and what did it look like to<br/>
her?  Or was she too young?  <br/>
 <br/>
I have three children, my son Riley is 12, my son Casey is 10 and my<br/>
daughter Maggie is 5.  This is the first time I have posted.  I have<br/>
been on this list for a little under a year now and have learned so<br/>
much.  I think that it is a great idea to hear from Roya so she can<br/>
share her perspective.  I love to hear the parent&#39;s story, but it would<br/>
be fascinating to hear what your children have to say.<br/>

unschools. I also have 2 boys and one girl, although my daughter is <br/>

It does seem to be a rare name.  I am glad to meet you and I look<br/>
