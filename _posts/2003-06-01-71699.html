    Oh, I will. ;-) I still feel bad about not being able to meet you.<br/>
Migraines are the pits! I wish I got it before or _after_ you left.<br/>
Well...not at all really. LOL!<br/>
    We&#39;re coming in thursday evening. Kelly, can I help you and Brenda with<br/>
anything that night? I just *know* your nerves will be fried. &lt;BWWG&gt; Buy you<br/>
a drink?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Glad to hear they like them.  I&#39;ve been saving up for the conference; I have<br/>
&gt; lots of non-German euros now!  You&#39;ll have to come take a peek.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll see you in SC, with quarters.  Thanks much.  I&#39;m glad that I&#39;ll finally<br/>
&gt; get to meet you, since Columbus never happened!<br/>

&gt; We should be able to pretty easily split the coins up between anyone who&#39;s<br/>
&gt; interested.  There&#39;s a LOT of coins, and many, many of them are duplicates.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll sort you out some before I leave, if I have time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll be easy to find -- I&#39;ll be the one Kelly is running around like her<br/>
&gt; personal conference-slave!  (I&#39;m coming in early and hanging around in S.C.<br/>
&gt; for two weeks beforehand to see old friends, new friends, and hopefully be<br/>
&gt; reasonably useful to Kelly.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ll find each other.  Promise!<br/>
