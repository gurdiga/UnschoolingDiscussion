&lt;&lt; Don Aslett wrote several books about decluttering that are exactly about <br/>
this <br/>
stuff. About how to hang onto the memories of stuff (like sorority silver <br/>
bowls) without having to hang onto the stuff itself. About how the stuff eats <br/>
up <br/>
your energy just thinking about it and moving it around.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because of reading Don Aslett, I got good doormats inside and outside our <br/>
entry doors and that really helps.  But I didn&#39;t throw away the letter David <br/>
Bowie wrote me in 1967, nor the envelope it came in (though I long ago gave the <br/>
stamps away to someone who collected stamps).  I still have souvenirs of <br/>
everything in my whole life.   There are some things I&#39;m very sorry to have thrown <br/>
away, and so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever throw anything away again.  Bummer for me, <br/>
but there it is.  (I WILL throw things away, and give things to thrift stores, <br/>
but about 1/3 of the time someone is going to need that thing later, and I&#39;ll <br/>
have that pang of regret. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

When I was fourteen, I got a promo album from the pile my cousin didn&#39;t want, <br/>
after she picked out what she thought was good. The original pile came from a <br/>
radio station my uncle managed.  It was a country station. &lt;g&gt;  So anything <br/>
that looked like rock or pop they gave to their kids.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote to the American distributor to ask for his address.   It wasn&#39;t as <br/>
easy to get an address in those days.  They sent me his manager&#39;s address.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a fan letter (wish I had kept a copy, but ditto the problems of those <br/>
days).<br/>
<br/>
He sent a full-paged typed letter, several copies of publicity photos <br/>
(photostatic copies of glossies), a section of The Chelsea News with an article about <br/>
him on it (that&#39;s temporarily misplaced, but I know I have it safely <br/>
somewhere &lt;g&gt;), and that&#39;s that!  I still have the album.  I used to keep the <br/>
newspaper thumbtacked to the ceiling of my room.  I had acoustical tiles that took <br/>
thumbtacks well.  So it has thumbtack holes, wherever it is.    <br/>
<br/>
Friends asked &quot;Who is he?&quot; and I said &quot;He&#39;s great, he writes his own stuff.  <br/>
He&#39;ll be as famous as the Beatles.&quot;  And they would shake their heads as <br/>
though I were just delusional.<br/>
<br/>
People still think I&#39;m delusional sometimes. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
But I just keep being right!  <br/>
<br/>
Ta daa!<br/>

It was called David Bowie.<br/>
He looked about 18.  He was probably 25. or so.<br/>
<br/>
It had &quot;Rubber Band&quot; and I really liked that one.   And one about a <br/>
gravedigger.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75210477">In order to please my husband, who wanted less &quot;clutter&quot; in the <br/>
house, I went through some of my personal stuff and threw it out. <br/>
I&#39;ve since wished I still had some of those things. I think <br/>
decluttering is all find and dandy, but if you really want to keep <br/>
something, then keep it irregardless of someone else&#39;s ideas about it <br/>
being clutter or physical reminders of something not being important <br/>
to keeping the memory. <br/>
