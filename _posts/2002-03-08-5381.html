the talent show was really cool last year - Sandra even played a recorder <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We camped at the KAO in West Sacramento one year. It is across town - but not <br/>
too far and at least they have hot showers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d spring for a room if at all possible, though, because it is so great to <br/>
have a base of operations - someplace to hang wet swimsuits and a place to <br/>
keep a cooler full of food (the hotel food is expensive and the restaurant is <br/>
REALLY slow). The conference hotel room rate is only about $80 a night - this <br/>
is a pretty snazzy hotel and that is a really really good rate. The <br/>
conference registration is way cheaper, too, if you&#39;re an HSC member and if <br/>
you register really early. You might send a note to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:conference@...">conference@...</a> to be <br/>
on the mailing list.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Okay, I was specifically told that this was *not* okay.  It was probably<br/>
&gt; on the HSC list, but it may have been at a northern California HSC<br/>
&gt; get-together we went to. Nope (checking archives for June 11 and 12 of<br/>
&gt; 2001),  it was on the list, and all of the official HCS people who posted<br/>
&gt; agreed that each child needed to have a responsible adult with them at<br/>
&gt; each workshop they attended.  In support of this, an example was given of<br/>
&gt; two children who were dropped off and not picked up at the end of a<br/>
&gt; workshop. It was suggested that people (even people posting who had<br/>
&gt; responsible 9 and 11 year old kids) bring  a designated sitter to<br/>
&gt; accompany he kids to workshops. No one said anything about your<br/>
&gt; individual child being responsible enough to do anything independently,<br/>
&gt; unless they had hit the magic age of 13. So if things have changed,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s wonderful, but the message last year was different.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wrote that example on the HSC list. It was part of an explanation of why we <br/>
NO LONGER have parent drop-offs - with parents signing kids in and out. The <br/>
reason is that then the workshop presenters, who want to go on to see the <br/>
rest of the conference and who have kids of their own to take care of, end up <br/>
sitting with other people&#39;s kids when the other people forget to come get <br/>
them from a workshop. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do that anymore. Parents are responsible for their own kids. This is <br/>
the same message I gave last year when I was responsible for the conference. <br/>
No changes. The rules say: &quot;Children must be accompanied by a responsible <br/>
adult at all times.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In practice this means that YOU, the parent, are responsible for your child. <br/>
You cannot dump them at a workshop and leave and expect the workshop <br/>
presenter to babysit them until you decide to come back and get them. If they <br/>
need to go to the bathroom during a workshop, they&#39;ll just leave, and if they <br/>
don&#39;t come back, nobody is going to notice. If your child is disruptive or <br/>
destructive during the workshop, there will be nobody there to give <br/>
individual attention to your child and we&#39;ll ask you to be in the room with <br/>
him/her from then on. This applies to children of any age. If you have full <br/>
confidence that your child is okay to leave a workshop whenever, to not be <br/>
disruptive while there, to handle it if stung by a bee and there is no adult <br/>
to treat them, to go to the bathroom or get a drink without an adult keeping <br/>
track of them, to find their way around the hotel, to not be upset if they <br/>
have trouble finding you, to ask for help if needed, to stay out of the way <br/>
of automobiles, to stay out of the fountains and the lake, etc., then you <br/>
being on the premises might be enough. If conference staff has to come <br/>
looking for you because your child has a problem, then you&#39;ll be reminded <br/>
that children are supposed to be accompanied by a responsible adult. It is <br/>
not &quot;responsible&quot; if the child can&#39;t find you when they need you. I always <br/>
made sure my child was going to a workshop with a buddy - and that they were <br/>
clear that they were expected to stay together. I have their schedule and I <br/>
check on them regularly. Not a problem. When they were little, either myself <br/>
or another adult would take charge of a group of kids - taking turns watching <br/>
over them.<br/>
<br/>
I wish we could assume all parents & kids would act responsibly, and not need <br/>
to have this requirement as a backup, but they don&#39;t. <br/>

presenters had strong preferences about ages they wanted to work with  - I <br/>
said this on the HSC list last year and it was MY decision to put the age <br/>
guidelines into the program. <br/>
