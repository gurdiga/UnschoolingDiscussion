Thanks for your comments. My purpose was not to create unnecessary fear<br/>
among our troops, but to point out that the reason school employees treat<br/>
homeschoolers with disrespect, distrust, disdain and often contempt is that<br/>
they see us as their enemy...as people who, if our numbers grow<br/>
sufficiently, will take jobs away from their unions and cause spending on<br/>
tax-funded schools to diminish. We threaten their job security.<br/>
<br/>
The government education establishment, like every other bureaucratic<br/>
empire, wants one thing: To grow to the largest extent possible; to acquire<br/>
the greatest possible amount of money and power.<br/>
<br/>
I did not say it was evil. I do say, however, that its effort is directed at<br/>
controlling the lives of as many people as it can. Its employees see us as a<br/>
challenge to that goal. That&#39;s why they won&#39;t leave us alone, and they won&#39;t<br/>
until we break the chains (laws) that limit our freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps my words lack tact, but I do try to distinguish between the persons<br/>
(who might be decent human beings) and their actions (which, in regard to<br/>
homeschoolers, are often offensive). The government schools are filled with<br/>
&quot;good people&quot; who are doing terrible things, and it&#39;s because they work for<br/>
a diabolical self-serving system. I don&#39;t believe that when someone or some<br/>
group is working to eliminate my freedom, that it&#39;s time to be gracious<br/>
and/or tactful.<br/>
<br/>
We are making inroads already. Inroads are the logical, necessary results of<br/>
taking our children out of that system, and that reduces their budgets and<br/>
their payrolls and their influence -- eventually.<br/>
<br/>
If the public schools were doing a &quot;good&quot; job, homeschooling would not be<br/>
growing -- might not even exist, except for a few lonely individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, referring to my post:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;This makes for an effective rallying cry to gather the troops against the<br/>
&gt;&gt;enemy who seeks to control or destroy us. But it doesn&#39;t line up with<br/>
&gt;&gt;reality in every state.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned again: <br/>
As I read the education news, I get the distinct impression that the NEA,<br/>
NFT, and other unions of public school employees, are doing everything in<br/>
their power to eliminate homeschooling. That is going on nationally -- in<br/>
every state and at the education nerve centers in Washington. According to<br/>
published reports, the NEA has many well-paid operatives whose job it is to<br/>
create strategies that work against homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In CT (my current home -- on paper the absolute easiest state for<br/>
homeschooling) just last year, one superintendent got a legislator to<br/>
sponsor a bill that would have removed ALL the rights of homeschooers in our<br/>
state. It caused a huge hassle for us and a thousand of us had to go to the<br/>
capitol to fight for our freedom....again.<br/>
<br/>
CT homeschoolers didn&#39;t (as you imply) &gt;&gt; *want* to believe they&#39;re being<br/>
attacked&lt;&lt;  We were actually attacked, big time, and if we hadn&#39;t mobilized<br/>
quickly and effectively, we might have been thrown to the NEA lions without<br/>
having any say in the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Believing if we could get rid of evil government controlling us we&#39;d all be<br/>
&gt;&gt;happy&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned replies:<br/>
 I refer you to the Declaration of Independence which did just that.<br/>
<br/>
My purpose is only to say that, despite all the decent school people and<br/>
benevolent lawmakers, a constant threat exists, and homeschooling will not<br/>
live in ideal circumstances unless we are vigilant and, equally important,<br/>
working to remove ALL laws and regulations that limit our natural, sacred,<br/>
inalienable freedoms. Unless we do so, we will continue to be threatened and<br/>
put upon by those who stand to gain from the elimination of our practice.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that it can be alarming and disturbing for some people to realize<br/>
that homeschoolers are treated like the Jews, gays and gypsies of Nazi<br/>
Germany (your reference, not mine, but an apt one considering how we are<br/>
made to cower and beg by the school authorities in many places).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ned.<br/>
Please.<br/>
There are lots of homeschoolers in Albuquerque who are homeschooling on the <br/>
recommendation of their kids&#39; teachers in schools.  And it wasn&#39;t done in a <br/>
snarky way, but in a GREAT way--&quot;Your child is a great candidate for <br/>
homeschooling.  School is going to frustrate the heck out of him.  If you <br/>
don&#39;t know any homeschoolers I can get you some contacts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just talked on the phone for 45 minutes to a new homeschooler here locally. <br/>
 Her son is seven, and went to first grade last year.  Her mom teaches third <br/>
grade, and told her a bunch about intelligences, and told her NOT to try to <br/>
recreate school or use any of their methods, but to do things with her son on <br/>
an entirely individual and creative basis.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the government will take these teachers for jail now for not <br/>
being the government minions you&#39;re assuring us they are supposed to be?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The government education establishment, like every other bureaucratic<br/>
empire, wants one thing: To grow to the largest extent possible; to acquire<br/>
the greatest possible amount of money and power.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I did not say it was evil. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably nobody here would read the larger paragraph above as that being a <br/>
good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t read it as being a true thing.  &quot;Bureaucratic empire&quot; and the rest of <br/>
the rhetoric is not helpful to those here who are trying to learn more about <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s why they won&#39;t leave us alone,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Schools ARE leaving us alone.<br/>
I wish we could be left alone from a daily or hourly dose of how the the <br/>
persons<br/>
(who might be decent human beings) and their actions (which, in regard to<br/>
homeschoolers, are often offensive). The government schools are filled with<br/>
&quot;good people&quot; who are doing terrible things, and it&#39;s because they work for<br/>
a diabolical self-serving system.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Diabolical is probably right in the thesaurus under &quot;evil.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you just stop about the schools for one week maybe?   And if the list <br/>
does well without out it, consider another week?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t believe that when someone or some<br/>
group is working to eliminate my freedom, that it&#39;s time to be gracious<br/>
and/or tactful.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could send those tirades to school board members then, if you think <br/>
they&#39;re working to eliminate your freedom.<br/>
<br/>
This list was created for and is comprised chiefly  of people who want to <br/>
share information about unschooling, not about schools or politics or evil <br/>
empires.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I realize that it can be alarming and disturbing for some people to realize<br/>
that homeschoolers are treated like the Jews, gays and gypsies of Nazi<br/>
Germany (your reference, not mine, but an apt one considering how we are<br/>
made to cower and beg by the school authorities in many places).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Cower and beg&quot; is so overstated it&#39;s laughable.<br/>
More states than not require nothing of homeschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe what you are trying to say to me is, this list is not the place to<br/>
bring these topics up...if so, I&#39;ll honor that. Let us know.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is there a Luz without Ned?  Is there an option for dialog and not tirade?  I <br/>
like the posts about your house and your son.  I just don&#39;t like the <br/>

unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hurtful to anyone here with kids in public school. And hurtful<br/>
to anyone with good friends whose kids are in public school.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s offputting to anyone still in the system who&#39;s curious about<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think it creates an unnecessary adversarial attitude between homeschoolers<br/>
and teachers. (Accusing people of selfish motives won&#39;t open any dialogs. I<br/>
think we should build bridges of reason and results not walls of rhetoric<br/>
and mud slinging.)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a bunch of hooey. But that&#39;s nothing more than my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, I think this list is not the place. And I think Helen said that<br/>
too in the &quot;Bad rhetoric and unschooling&quot; thread. And being list owner I<br/>
think she gets at least two votes ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I agree with Sandra. It doesn&#39;t really serve our purposes on this<br/>
&gt; list to be so negative about schools and schooling. They&#39;re still a<br/>
&gt; fact of life for many unschooling families, as other children in the<br/>
&gt; family might be attending school for various reasons (not the least<br/>
&gt; of which is some kids LIKE school and get a lot out of it), relatives<br/>
&gt; (cousins etc.) will be almost certainly attending school, friends and<br/>
&gt; relatives might be schoolteachers, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At Home Education Magazine we&#39;ve always tried to take a generally<br/>
&gt; positive approach to homeschooling and unschooling, helping people<br/>
&gt; find alternatives when they&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to go seeking, but<br/>
&gt; not going out of our way to convince people that they&#39;re doing the<br/>
&gt; wrong thing and need to change (well, with one significant<br/>
&gt; politically-charged exception &lt;g&gt;). We quite regularly reject<br/>
&gt; articles badmouthing schools and teachers and the whole educational<br/>
&gt; bureaucracy, not because we want to promote the schooling experience<br/>
&gt; (*far* from it, trust me), but because it just doesn&#39;t make any sense<br/>
&gt; to us to try to build up what we believe in, what we trust and rely<br/>
&gt; on, by tearing down what other people might believe in and trust and<br/>
&gt; rely on. There are better ways to get along in the world.<br/>

How right you are, and Mao killed even more than Stalin. Chalk up our going <br/>
easy on those two guys to our weakness for humane rhetoric (&quot;the poor ...&quot;), <br/>
our being susceptive to easy anger at perceived injustice (&quot;workers ...&quot;), <br/>
and our natural inclination toward envy (&quot;the rich ...&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Hitler, Mao, and Stalin were all nationalists at heart.  One difference is <br/>
that Hitler spoke in nationalist terms, terms that involve race, blood, and <br/>
soil. Mao and Stalin spoke using the language of class, terms that involve <br/>
comparing ourselves with our neighbors, our teachers, and our bosses. <br/>
<br/>
That so many Americans have a sick love affair with Marxism and communism is <br/>
truly disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I think Hitler was the most revolutionary of the three, and thus needs <br/>
to be studied the most. Being the less mass murderer of the three is no <br/>
virtue!<br/>
