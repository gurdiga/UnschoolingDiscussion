Faith, this is so true.  Whatever we read or hear,we need to think about<br/>
how it aplies to our own circumstances and leave the rest behind.  I also<br/>
apreciate your willingness to discuss this issue. <br/>
<br/>
Punished By Rewards, by Alfie Kohn, addresses the issue of how to get<br/>
children to obey.  He questions that very assumption, that children<br/>
should &quot;obey&quot; their parents.  He suggests that a more useful long term<br/>
goal is to help children learn to make choices that lead to a moral <br/>
lifestyle.  A child who learns only to do what he is told will be lost<br/>
when no one is there to tell him what to do.  I recommend this book for<br/>
anyone who lives with children and has the long term goal of raising a<br/>
person who will someday take care of themselves and be a productive and<br/>
moral member of society.  It also has good advice for those who supervise<br/>
others in the workforce.  No, he does not recommend a chaotic household<br/>
where everyone does whatever they want -- he stresses cooperation and<br/>
considering a child&#39;s developmental level and most important, for the<br/>
parent to live a life of example.  No matter what we say, kids learn by<br/>
what we do.  And hitting a child is hitting, no matter what we call it.<br/>
