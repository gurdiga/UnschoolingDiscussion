THat&#39;s about what you want, not about the child.<br/>
<br/>
Kids that are exposed to loads of new experiences, tastes, sights and sounds <br/>
are not going to be afraid to try something new...trust me.<br/>
If you wouldn&#39;t force your dh to try something he didn&#39;t want to, then why <br/>
the kids?<br/>
<br/>
I am a vegetarian most of the time. What if someone thought I was limiting <br/>
myself and ought to be exposed to more meat dishes? It would go completely <br/>
against MY natural instinct to avoid meat to be forced to try it. Your children <br/>
have their own unique tastes and preferences, they will try new things when they <br/>
are ready. <br/>

I believe that you see it that way. But having been that way myself in former <br/>
times I KNOW it&#39;s about power. Because if it wasn&#39;t, you would never have to <br/>
encourage anyone to take a bite. You wouldn&#39;t have the power to make them do <br/>
it in a fair world.<br/>
Asking someone to try something is entirely different from MAKING them try a <br/>
bite.<br/>
It IS about power and it does lessen someone&#39;s joy, maybe not yours, but it <br/>
does lessen the joy of the person you are forcing to do the bite.<br/>

Medieval England, under the ocean to study sharks, into the kitchen <br/>
where they triple and quadruple recipes in their heads.<br/>
<br/>
Will I trust their God-given ability to learn new things, to take <br/>
them into the &quot;unknown&quot; of new foods?<br/>

<br/>
Maybe change your wish and trust that they be healthy and happy whether their <br/>
natural desires take them into a vast worl of unknown foods or it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If their satisfaction and joy are higher priorities than the range of foods <br/>
they enjoy, you can relax altogether about it.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Forcing seems a strong word. But I&#39;m going to observe myself next<br/>
time, and try to see if that is what I&#39;m doing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From what you said at the beginning of all this, I would have thought<br/>
forcing too. From what you have said since, I would still stay coercing. Not<br/>
exactly the same but still not necessary. I may change my mind!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t want them turning things down, just because they&#39;ve never <br/>
encountered them before. I want them to not be afraid of different <br/>
tastes and textures.<br/>
<br/>
Another person:<br/>
&lt;&lt;THat&#39;s about what you want, not about the child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I woke up this morning thinking that.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about all the things, ideas, knowledge that have converged to <br/>
make this attachment parenting kind of unschooling life possible in 2003, and <br/>
I thought that one contributing factor has been the concept of co-dependency, <br/>
and our knowledge of the harm it can do when people are not clear what is them <br/>
and their needs and their emotion, and what is someone else.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent is living codependently off a child, the child is living a subset <br/>
of the parent&#39;s life.  There needs to be a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, children have emotional needs and physical needs and <br/>
psychological/biochemical/spiritual needs.   But they need to need what THEY need, not what we <br/>
need to need them to need.  <br/>
<br/>
And anyone who has not the slightest clue what I&#39;m talking about, that&#39;s <br/>
okay.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Go to google.com and look up co-dependency, definition, and see if any of it <br/>
looks like you.  If not, good.  If so, not so good.<br/>
<br/>
Or even better, throw your questions out here.  <br/>
And if you get a chance, find a copy of <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Whole Child/Whole Parent <br/>
&quot;A Spiritual & Practical Guide to Parenthood&quot;<br/>
ISBN 0-06-090949-8<br/>
Wholeness, Spirit, Happiness, Freedom, Unity, Beauty, Truth, Love<br/>
<br/>
DARN.  The review my site used to link to is gone.  <br/>
Well, the book&#39;s out there somewhere. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

someone else&#39;s life flashes before your eyes. :)<br/>
