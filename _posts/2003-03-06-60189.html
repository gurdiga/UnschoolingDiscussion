<div id="ygrps-yiv-965463960">[I&#39;m sending this to a couple of lists, so if you see it twice, I&#39;m sorry, <br/>
and you can delete it unread; they match.]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Feburary 27, Thursday at noon my husband took me to the airport.  I was <br/>
really well prepared.  I had been ready to go for over 24 hours.  That has <br/>
never happened before.  It happened because I was afraid.   <br/>
<br/>
I left Albuquerque around 2:00, stayed a long time in Minneapolis, and ended <br/>
up in Saskatoon at 11:30 at night.<br/>
<br/>
Customs was only concerned about my jerkey.  It was sealed, and American, so <br/>
I could keep it.<br/>
<br/>
Ian and Barbie, who were the conference coordinators who had arranged for me <br/>
to be there, met me right away.  I had planned to get cash at the airport, <br/>
but spaced it, being tired and my foot hurting, and their car being RIGHT <br/>
there, right outside the door.<br/>
<br/>
The Saskatoon Inn was really  near the airport and GORGEOUS inside--kind of a <br/>
jungle in the middle, with walkways and places to sit, and a pool, and just a <br/>
maze of pretty little nooks and turns.  Restaurant and bar and hot tub and <br/>
little lounge areas all mixed in there in that open area with big tropical <br/>
plants.<br/>
<br/>
Up on the second floor, where there was a balcony/hallway overlooking all <br/>
that, I met Ian&#39;s #1 and #1 children, young adults, and a son-in-law.  Very <br/>
nice people.   <br/>
<br/>
When I got to my room, 627, with a view of snow-covered flatness and a few <br/>
businesses, but mostly bare prairie to the horizon, I realized I had not one <br/>
dollar of Canadian money, and my tapes were being delivered the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, I had half a sprite and half a bottle of orange juice in my pack, <br/>
and a bunch of nuts and jerkey, so I wasn&#39;t going to starve.<br/>
<br/>
Downstairs was an ATM but it didn&#39;t deal in VISA, only Master Card.<br/>
<br/>
Things eventually worked out, though.<br/>
<br/>
February 28, Friday I went to put my things near the conference rooms, and <br/>
went toward the restaurant.  Someone called me from up on the ramp, &quot;Mrs. <br/>
Dodd?&quot;   I almost didn&#39;t hear it because of the water and all.    I went back <br/>
and it was a TV reporter who wanted to interview me.  So I went all the way <br/>
back up to the ballroom.  She and the cameraman were especially friendly and <br/>
open, unlike what I was used to with dressed-up and officious and abrupt TV <br/>
people.  Very nice.  She asked me to summarize my opening talk, and asked me <br/>
a bit about homeschooling in general.  I asked when it would be on and she <br/>
said that it was a local station, and the news repeated every hour, so if I <br/>
turned it on at the top of any hour I&#39;d see it.  Except when the hockey game <br/>
was on.<br/>
<br/>
I was the first speaker, at 1:00.  The announcements and greetings were after <br/>
my talk.  I had just sent Ian a list of all the talks I&#39;d ever done and he <br/>
had chosen some, so I was doing &quot;What Teachers Know that You Don&#39;t Know.&quot;  <br/>
There being no alternative, everyone who was already there was at that <br/>
presentation, and I&#39;m not good with numbers, but I&#39;m thinking it was over 300 <br/>
people.  Very big group.  I&#39;ve never spoken to a larger group, I don&#39;t think. <br/>
   That particular talk is better suited to a smaller group, but it worked <br/>
out, and when I finished a bit early, I was really glad that there were a <br/>
couple of teachers in the audience who were willing to come to the audience <br/>
mike and back up my assertion that most of what teachers learn isn&#39;t useful <br/>
to homeschoolers anyway, being as it is mostly about group management, tests <br/>
and measures, school politics and record keeping, and so forth.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a break after that, and I set up a table in the hall to sell tapes <br/>
and Thinking Sticks.  I don&#39;t think I sold any that first session, but I did <br/>
talk to people without pause for the couple of hours between sessions, and I <br/>
spoke at 4:30 on Unschooling.   The group was smaller, but still over 100.  <br/>
Maybe 175 people?  (If anyone reading this was there and actually counted or <br/>
is better at estimation, feel VERY free to correct my numbers.)<br/>
<br/>
That talk went really well and everybody got a Certificate of Empowerment, <br/>
but the photos of the kids didn&#39;t make it all the way around.  I brought them <br/>
out again the next day, though, and also kept them out on the table for <br/>
people to see.<br/>
<br/>
After that I sat at the table some more, sold some tapes, and officers of the <br/>
group gave me a Subway sandwich which was homey (foodwise) and friendly <br/>
(because I didn&#39;t have to put my stuff away to go and eat).<br/>
<br/>
I had planned to go back to the room , put my foot up a while, and watch &quot;An <br/>
American in Canada,&quot; a sitcom which had been advertised the night before on <br/>
TV.  And then, I figured, the hour would turn and I&#39;d see myself on TV, and <br/>
then I&#39;d venture back out and socialize.<br/>
<br/>
The sitcom, turns out, was the premier episode.  It involved a guy moving <br/>
from Phoenix to Calgary to do the morning news show.  (I read later that it <br/>
was filmed in Toronto and that the actor playing the American was from <br/>
Toronto too, but that&#39;s okay.)  <br/>
<br/>
On the local channel 10, the hockey game was on.  Minor leagues, I think, <br/>
local team, Saskatoon Blades, happy to have a guy who had grown up there <br/>
having lately left some other team and come to play for them.  I&#39;d switch <br/>
channels, and read, and check back.  Next hour; game still on.<br/>
<br/>
I called home and talked to Kirby and Holly.  Keith and Marty had gone to see <br/>
Daredevil.  I asked Kirby to e-mail two unschooling lists to say I was having <br/>
a good time.<br/>
<br/>
Hour; hockey.<br/>
Hour; hockey commentary.  Discussion of the game, of other teams, of hockey, <br/>
of the fund raiser involving tie-dyed jerseys on tie-dyed night (or <br/>
something).<br/>
<br/>
It was 10:00 and I was getting sleepy, but forced myself to stay awake until <br/>
11:00.  <br/>
<br/>
Saw myself on TV.  Also the president of the provincial group hosting the <br/>
conference.  Her last name is Dodds.  She looked and sounded marvelous.  I <br/>
sounded great, looked like a person who should REALLY get a haircut, wear <br/>
makeup and maybe lose 50 pounds before ever being on TV ever.  <br/>
<br/>
Decided 11:15 was too late to hobble downstairs and socialize, and my foot <br/>
was fat.  Went merrily to sleep in a big bed in a dark room all by myself.<br/>
<br/>
March 1, Saturday, went to breakfast.  Ended up sitting and talking to a <br/>
couple who had heard me the day before.  Another couple of moms had also <br/>
asked if I wanted to sit with them, but they&#39;d already actually eaten, and <br/>
the young couple had a baby, so I told them getting to sit with a baby won <br/>
out, and they totally understood.<br/>
<br/>
I went and sat with my tapes and sticks.  Sold quite a few.  Talked to lots <br/>
of people.  Spoke twice in the afternoon,  Dwindling crowd, which was totally <br/>
understandable, because the alternative talks were interesting and some <br/>
people had heard me already.  <br/>
The first talk was Having Confidence in Yourself, and was (naturally) also <br/>
about unschooling, but was pretty much the same outline as the article <br/>
&quot;Disposable Checklists,&quot; because that&#39;s where that article came from.    Then <br/>
I did the game &quot;That&#39;s Not Educational,&quot; and gave a prize for baggie twist <br/>
ties.   Only one person in there had not already heard me speak, and after a <br/>
few items thrown out to be shown to be educational, it just turned into <br/>
questions and answers and that was fine.  <br/>
<br/>
I had moved my sales table inside the room and had been selling things <br/>
between talks, and sold some more after.  <br/>
<br/>
People had been wonderfully friendly and open and complimentary and <br/>
communicative.  I had a GREAT  time talking to people.  Even those who were <br/>
disagreeing with me were really nice about it.  (&quot;Of course, they&#39;re <br/>
Canadians,&quot; one person who wasn&#39;t born Canadian or American either one told <br/>
me when I said that.)  But both attendees and organizers were thanking me for <br/>
being so available between talks, and for being so down to earth and <br/>
friendly.  It made me feel really good.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I packed up and went back to the room, having fulfilled my obligation.<br/>
<br/>
But I wasn&#39;t through.  <br/>
<br/>
A largish group of unschoolers had chosen not to attend the conference for <br/>
socio-political reasons.  I was sympathetic, because the New Mexico state <br/>
organization totally broke down and dissolved when unschoolers ran the state <br/>
conference one year.  We couldn&#39;t survive unless we let the Christians run <br/>
everything, and they were unwilling to really share power and opportunity.  <br/>
So something at least vaguely similar was going on in Saskatoon.  Rather than <br/>
ask to be told the details I just said I would talk to the other faction as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that wasn&#39;t wholly right and good, but Saskatoon&#39;s a long way off, <br/>
and my personal motivation is to help people unschool more confidently and <br/>
peacefully.  Yes, it would have been easier for me if they&#39;d just gone to the <br/>
conference, but I do understand when groups split out over such philosophical <br/>
issues.  And I had no contract saying I couldn&#39;t speak anywhere else.  So <br/>
although it was unfair that the smaller group piggybacked (the word used by <br/>
someone in the larger group when complaining lightly about it) on the <br/>
conference, I didn&#39;t feel too guilty, because I had gone above and beyond <br/>
what I had been paid to do.  Except for the evening waiting to see the news <br/>
blurb, I had been fully available to anyone who wanted to talk to me, and had <br/>
done four presentations.<br/>
<br/>
I was fetched and taken to a Unitarian Church where there were desserts and <br/>
maybe 25 people.  Some had been at the conference as well.  That session just <br/>
turned into me telling stories, which seemed okay.  There were some questions <br/>
and answers about younger kids reading and writing, about older kids&#39; social <br/>
stuff, about parents&#39; fears and the world changing.  I enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
Then I was privileged to stay in a guest bedroom which was a Barbie museum!<br/>
<br/>
In the morning, March 2, a breakfast buffet at a different hotel was attended <br/>
by maybe (you&#39;d think I could count a group THIS small) fifteen people.   We <br/>
laughed and told stories and were philosophical and ate good food, and then I <br/>
was given a ride to the airport!<br/>
<br/>
Two or three hours with a stop in Regina without changing planes.  Very white <br/>
and cold.   Minneapolis for four hours of magazine reading.  I thought of <br/>
calling Susan Bundlie but I was afraid she&#39;d feel bad for not picking me up <br/>
and I didn&#39;t really want to eat and I was almost too exhausted to think.  So <br/>
I read about Ben Affleck and watched CNN news and kinda vegetated.<br/>
<br/>
I had been afraid customs would question me about the leftover tapes (though <br/>
I&#39;d sold more than half of the hundred I had had copied in Canada).  I had <br/>
traded my sack of cash to someone with an American account for a check.  <br/>
Canadians don&#39;t have $1 bills anymore.  $5 is the smallest, so selling things <br/>
for $8 and $15 nets a bunch of $2 and $1 coins.  But all customs cared about <br/>
was the egg decorating kit.  Juxtaposed with my necklace (a brass pierce-work <br/>
plaque) it came to look like a knife in the x-rays, so my backpack was <br/>
searched.  They didn&#39;t care anything about my carefully documented tapes with <br/>
the shrinkwrap and the Canadian receipt.  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I was met in Albuquerque by Keith and Holly, who had happy stories of the <br/>
weekend. Nobody had told Keith I had called on Friday.  I had only brought <br/>
gifts for Holly.  A Canada patch for her jean jacket which has lots of <br/>
patches (and she did go to Ontario a few years ago), a girls&#39; magazine, a <br/>
math workbook (because she finished her Animaniacs workbook a couple of weeks <br/>
ago, and this one looked like the kind of geometrical and fractions stuff she <br/>
likes), and I gave her the egg decorating kit I had been given as a gift from <br/>
the unschooling group Saturday night.   Carol Narigon made and gave us a <br/>
decorated Easter egg and Holly had said she thought she could do that, but I <br/>
said I didn&#39;t know how and special equipment was needed.  Tadaaa!  Special <br/>
equipment and instructions.<br/>
<br/>
I was just brain-tired for a couple of days after getting home.  I&#39;ve finally <br/>
done my laundry, but haven&#39;t yet put papers away.<br/>
<br/>
People in Saskatchewan were very friendly.  I had a way better time than I <br/>
thought i would have.  I was afraid I&#39;d be all alone surrounded by strangers, <br/>
but it never felt that way from the moment I saw Ian and Barbie at the <br/>
airport.</div>

<br/>
From the beginning it was rough.   The first inquiry was last May.  Then when <br/>
I asked whether they had already chosen, I was told the board was changing <br/>
and they&#39;d get back to me.  They got back in December.  Still it was not <br/>
definite.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m used to knowing six months before and telling all my friends and a bunch <br/>
of strangers, having it on the website, making a fair amount of noise and <br/>
planning.   This was very quiet and mysterious, relative to other <br/>
conferences.  <br/>
<br/>
But it did work out.<br/>
<br/>
And the conference itself, in person, seemed extremely well organized and all <br/>
the running of it and announcements and the program were sharp and together.  <br/>
Things started on time, people were friendly and calm.  I know there was a <br/>
stressful meeting of the organization that went over its scheduled time, but <br/>
to outsiders (and other speakers, and vendors and guests) things seemed <br/>
peaceful and happy and smooth.<br/>

What sort of disagreements did those people voice?  Did they disagree <br/>
on the philosophy of unschooling (which, I believe, encompasses far <br/>

&lt;&lt; What sort of disagreements did those people voice?  Did they disagree <br/>
on the philosophy of unschooling (which, I believe, encompasses far <br/>
more than an educational method) or specific educational concerns? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
TV freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Movies.<br/>
<br/>
The internet.<br/>
<br/>
Fears of kids seeing sex or hearing bad language.<br/>
<br/>
Those were all in conversations around the table, some of which were <br/>
WONDERFULLY deep and intense.<br/>
<br/>
One woman was saying her kids were older, 12ish, and she needed ways to <br/>
communicate with them and be with them.  I suggested movies, and she said <br/>
they don&#39;t let their kids watch movies.   No qualification given.  Just &quot;no <br/>
movies.&quot;  I sat quietly for a couple of beats waiting for her to limit her <br/>
forbidden field, but she didn&#39;t.  She looked at me, seeing that I was <br/>
unbelieving, and said &quot;They have sex and bad language.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if she won&#39;t watch movies with her kids, I was stumped.  I just said some <br/>
of my best times have been watching movies with my kids, and that the little <br/>
ones never cared about kissy parts anyway, or the relationships.   <br/>
<br/>
Another couple, older (my age, not a really young couple) was Catholic and <br/>
had a teenaged boy.  So we were talking teenagers.  They said I really would <br/>
protect my children from seeing porn, though, right?  I said they had seen <br/>
it, but I wasn&#39;t too worried.  The dad VERY nicely was saying that since some <br/>
people become addicted it was too dangerous to let a kid see any because he <br/>
might be one of the addicted.  I said if there is no hole or need in a child, <br/>
why would he become addicted to that?  I told him Marty (who was the subject <br/>
at that moment) was really busy with his friends and gaming and scheduled <br/>
activities and didn&#39;t have the time or the sadness needed to fall into a <br/>
habit like that.  He would never tell his friends, &quot;I can&#39;t go to the movies, <br/>
I have to look at internet porn,&quot; and that I didn&#39;t think ANY happy busy <br/>
person would want to live there.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say it was falling on deaf ears, but their fear of reported addiction <br/>
overrode any thought of WHY a person would prefer fantasy to his real life.<br/>
<br/>
And that had come up because a woman asked me for some sort of specific <br/>
information (I forget what) which is easily available on the internet.  Maybe <br/>
it was about college applications or SATs or some such.  I asked if she had <br/>
internet access and her eyes fired up and she said they DID but her son had <br/>
visited cheat code sites.<br/>
<br/>
Like for games?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
And those predators go there and put porn up.  (This was news to me.)<br/>
And one day they came in and no matter what key they touched, another porn <br/>
window popped up, and he had only gone to game code sites.<br/>
<br/>
So they cancelled their internet service that instant and that was the end of <br/>
the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Because of predators and cheatcode sites.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I figured happened, but I didn&#39;t argue with her except to say my kids go <br/>
to those sites a lot and that had never happened to us, was that her son <br/>
opened a crazy window-filled site, had no idea what to do, and went to bed.  <br/>
When she came in they were still there and SHE had no idea what to do so she <br/>
got angry, confronted him, he lied and said I swear I only looked at cheat <br/>
codes and she cancelled the access.<br/>
<br/>
But just because it&#39;s obvious to me doesn&#39;t mean she would have wanted to <br/>
hear it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids would lie too if I were unreasonably affrighted of the thought of one <br/>
glimpse of nastiness.  They would lie their butts off.   But because our <br/>
relationship is more important to me than the fear of them seeing something <br/>
&quot;bad,&quot; we have a relationship which is very unlikely to lead them to want <br/>
porn.<br/>
<br/>
With the older dad, I did suggest that forbidding porn was more likely to <br/>
lead to obsession than casual advice and discouragement.  I used the example <br/>
of &quot;Darwinism&quot; and evolution.  My kids will never read Darwin, I figure.  But <br/>
when some of those kids grow up whose parents based their whole lives on the <br/>
avoidance of input about evolution, they will wonder SO hard what the danger <br/>
is that they might actually read Darwin.<br/>

<br/>
Oh.  And the inadvertent insults I just let slide by.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of people said they would never really be unschoolers, but what I <br/>
had said had really inspired them and would change a lot of how they were <br/>
being with their children and thanks.  Then each of those two I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
said something like some things are to important not to teach, but the rest <br/>
they would loose up on.<br/>
<br/>
The insult is the suggestion (which they probably were unaware of making) <br/>
that I didn&#39;t think my kids were important, or that reading and math were <br/>
important, but THEY did, for their kids.  And the suggestion which they <br/>
weren&#39;t meaning to make that my kids probably couldn&#39;t read or write or do <br/>
math.<br/>
<br/>
So those I let go by like confused fish in busy water.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sandra,<br/>
Thanks for the explanation.  I&#39;m sorry it took me a while to <br/>
acknowledge your response, but Kevin became very sick yesterday <br/>
afternoon.  He was admitted to the children&#39;s hospital at 2:00 a.m.  <br/>
My dh and I switched places late this afternoon so I could come home <br/>
and be with the other kids for a while, and get some much needed <br/>
sleep.  (At my age, my back is not too forgiving of the pull-out <br/>
loungers that parents sleep on at the hospital!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I found it curious (but affirms my experience) that the <br/>
objections most people seem to have regarding unschooling are <br/>
targeted to issues other than basic *educational* issues.  The issues <br/>
you listed, &quot;TV freedom, movies, internet and fears of kids seeing <br/>
sex or hearing bad language,&quot; are core family/parenting issues.<br/>

afternoon.  He was admitted to the children&#39;s hospital at 2:00 a.m.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s Kevin?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyway, I found it curious (but affirms my experience) that the <br/>
objections most people seem to have regarding unschooling are <br/>
targeted to issues other than basic *educational* issues.  The issues <br/>
you listed, &quot;TV freedom, movies, internet and fears of kids seeing <br/>
sex or hearing bad language,&quot; are core family/parenting issues.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling launches the reconsideration of freedoms and learning.  Once <br/>
&quot;natural learning&quot; comes into the picture, the definition of what&#39;s &quot;natural&quot; <br/>
has to as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sandra,<br/>
I&#39;m writing this from one of the tempermental computers in the <br/>
hospital library.  Kevin is very sick, but he is stable.  He&#39;s <br/>
sleeping now while getting a blood transfusion, so I thought I&#39;d <br/>
distract myself from hovering and worrying.  &lt;g&gt;  Thanks for asking <br/>
about my little man.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From my experience and conversations with other homeschoolers about <br/>
unschooling, the value of child-directed education is not questioned <br/>
as much as the *letting go* of parental direction.  It&#39;s as if the <br/>
parent recognizes that her child learns best what he enjoys the most, <br/>
but the parent is afraid of letting go...simply because she *is* the <br/>
parent.  For some parents, perhaps because of how they were raised or <br/>
conditioned by society, the problem is more a parenting conflict.  <br/>
A &quot;good&quot; parent directs, guides, teaches, etc.  A &quot;good&quot; parent makes <br/>
sure her child is reading good literature, watching educational tv <br/>
and videos, playing educational games, etc.  I think that for some <br/>
people, they might see the naturalness of unschooling, but it&#39;s too <br/>
much of a leap from a parenting perspective.  It&#39;s the fear factor; <br/>
fear that if they *don&#39;t* direct, guide, teach, etc. (and I know <br/>
those are all forms of control) they won&#39;t be *good* parents.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably not explaining this well, so I&#39;ll stop and try to <br/>
reorganize my thoughts so I can explain what I&#39;m thinking.<br/>

Right.  But if they control literature and conversation and games and times <br/>
and places, where and how will unschooling/natural learning unfold?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it can fold out a little bit, but it can&#39;t really spread its wings and <br/>
fly, and then curl up in the corner and sleep until noon. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
