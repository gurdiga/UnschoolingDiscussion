<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808456905">&lt;&lt; They totally went around as if they could do what ever they wanted.  And I <br/>
think it was because I had been letting them do what they wanted. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly was talking about a family she knows.  The mom told the kids two weeks <br/>
ago &quot;We&#39;re unschooling starting right now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly, who is 11, said &quot;Why would she have said that?  Why didn&#39;t she just <br/>
not make them do their schoolwork that day and do something more interesting, <br/>
and just gradually change?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids can do what they want to, within the bounds of living with other <br/>
people nicely.  I&#39;m coming not to appreciate the stories of people who tell <br/>
us &quot;I just told my kids they never had a bedtime anymore&quot; and then a week <br/>
later they come and say &quot;I&#39;m so exhausted because my kids don&#39;t go to bed!&quot;   <br/>
Or &quot;I told them they could eat whatever they want from now on&quot; and now <br/>
they&#39;re eaten themselves sick.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking maybe if someone told her husband &quot;I&#39;ve decided you should have <br/>
sex with anyone you want now, and it really won&#39;t bother me a bit,&quot; he might <br/>
be gone for some part of the rest of that week.   Suddenly offering the whole <br/>
world is going to cause someone whose been regimented some serious excitement.<br/>
<br/>
But then if I were to describe it as &quot;ease into it gradually&quot; I&#39;m imagining <br/>
some people would &quot;ease&quot; into it over a period of a couple of years, so <br/>
slowly they don&#39;t see any differences either.<br/>
<br/>
If someone decided to water their yard less, &quot;don&#39;t water at all&quot; is too much <br/>
on the &quot;less&quot; side (if they live in the desert).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the answer, and probably it will be different for different <br/>
people.  Some seem really not to be able to process these ideas on their own, <br/>
but want a little set of directions.  I think they won&#39;t be able to unschool <br/>
very well, unless someone keeps giving them specific directions over the <br/>
years.<br/>

<br/>
When I was out one day a few weeks ago, I came back to find Casey <br/>
finishing up a book she had written. She uses the word homeschooling, <br/>
but I think unschooling works even better. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;How to be a Homeschooler in Six Easy Steps&quot; by Casey Gold<br/>
<br/>
Step 1: Get one of your parents to quit his or her job to stay home.<br/>
Step 2: Ask your Mom or Dad if he or she can try teaching you at home <br/>
for a day.<br/>
Step 3: If your Mom or Dad liked teaching you at home ask if he or <br/>
she can do it again, but this time only do the subjects you like.<br/>
Step 4: Ask to do it again. But this time ask to do it with no <br/>
subjects at all.<br/>
Step 5: Now find some homeschooler friends and have fun playing with <br/>
them.<br/>
Step 6: Great! Now you&#39;re a homeschooler. Go have fun playing with <br/>
your friends. Do what ever you want to.<br/>
<br/>
The End<br/>
<br/>
Please note that this 9 year old who ends her book &quot;Do what ever you <br/>
want to&quot; chose to spend her time writing a book. She used the <br/>
dictionary to look up spellings (a new idea for her) and even had <br/>
illustrations for each step. In an unschooling family, &quot;Do what ever <br/>
you want to&quot; does not mean run wild and never learn anything. It is a <br/>
very positive experience.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the <br/>
green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly <br/>
alive.&quot;<br/>

    &gt;&gt;Some seem really not to be able to process these ideas on their <br/>
    own, but want a little set of directions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    When I was out one day a few weeks ago, I came back to find Casey <br/>
    finishing up a book she had written. She uses the word homeschooling, <br/>
    but I think unschooling works even better. <br/>
<br/>
    &quot;How to be a Homeschooler in Six Easy Steps&quot; by Casey Gold<br/>
<br/>
    Step 1: Get one of your parents to quit his or her job to stay home.<br/>
    Step 2: Ask your Mom or Dad if he or she can try teaching you at home <br/>
    for a day.<br/>
    Step 3: If your Mom or Dad liked teaching you at home ask if he or <br/>
    she can do it again, but this time only do the subjects you like.<br/>
    Step 4: Ask to do it again. But this time ask to do it with no <br/>
    subjects at all.<br/>
    Step 5: Now find some homeschooler friends and have fun playing with <br/>
    them.<br/>
    Step 6: Great! Now you&#39;re a homeschooler. Go have fun playing with <br/>
    your friends. Do what ever you want to.<br/>
<br/>
    The End<br/>
<br/>
    Please note that this 9 year old who ends her book &quot;Do what ever you <br/>
    want to&quot; chose to spend her time writing a book. She used the <br/>
    dictionary to look up spellings (a new idea for her) and even had <br/>
    illustrations for each step. In an unschooling family, &quot;Do what ever <br/>
    you want to&quot; does not mean run wild and never learn anything. It is a <br/>
    very positive experience.<br/>
<br/>
    Life is good.<br/>
    ~Mary<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the <br/>
    green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly <br/>
    alive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
                          ~ Thich Nhat Hanh<br/>
