<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045370459">I learned the hard way that calling someone lazybones is hurtful... I used to call my son, now 18, lazybones. &quot;I&quot; thought it was cute. He did not :( Better to learn now then when they are older. Matt is not lazy, just has his own schedule, which does not happen to be my schedule. He does do what he is asked, just not the second I ask it. AND he would not learn the alphabet even with the bribe of $1 for every letter he learned... not for three years, not until HE was ready to learn his letters. He did not have time for them in his little boy world. And he was in public school almost all of his school years... thanks to an Ex who was horrid, and still refuses to let the older 4 homeschool... but that is another subject, LOL.<br/>
He also did not tie his own shoes until he was about 6.5 or so... but he has a huge heart, and a love for his family that all the academics in the world couldn&#39;t foster.<br/>
Please let your son be a little boy, they grow too fast in this world as it is...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248981964">My son does think it is cute, and loves it. He&#39;ll complain if I call him by his name too often. Another way all kids are different, I guess. I&#39;ve never tried to get him to learn his letters or tie his shoes (only his church shoes need to be tied, anyway). He learned his numbers all by himself, and I know he&#39;ll learn his letters the same way whenever he gets ready to. Hey, I&#39;d be happy for him to stay a little boy forever!!! I&#39;m not looking forward to him growing up and moving out! :-)<br/>
