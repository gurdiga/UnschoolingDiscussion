<div id="ygrps-yiv-298685865">I was reading a Christmas card to my son the other day.  I was reading it to<br/>
him because it was written in long hand, cursive, and my son doesn&#39;t know<br/>
how to read it or write it. Later when we were talking about the makeup of<br/>
his 1750 point Warhammer 40k army and I was looking at his draftsman like<br/>
printing of his list, I panicked. Those ugly fears that --I know how to do<br/>
something that he doesn&#39;t --grabbed me and I asked him if he was interested<br/>
in learning how to read or write cursive.  He said &quot;yeah that would be<br/>
interesting, but not now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I started thinking...<br/>
<br/>
Is cursive obsolete?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use it. My written communication with him [and everyone else] is<br/>
either typed on the computer or handwritten printing, the way I prefer to<br/>
write. The only place my son runs across cursive is in letters from his aunt<br/>
and uncle.  His reading is almost exclusively printed.<br/>
<br/>
Is a person considered illiterate if they can&#39;t read cursive?<br/>
<br/>
How would an unschooler ever get the desire to learn it if they never run<br/>
across it?<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t have much to do with his learning handwritten printing.  I now<br/>
marvel at how he forms letters, mostly starting at their bottoms. Nothing<br/>
like the uniform way the public school taught me. He prefers unlined paper.<br/>
I don&#39;t know what he would use as a model if he did have a desire.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here have experience with this?   It seems like something a<br/>
person could easily pick up if there was a need.  But what if that need<br/>
doesn&#39;t arrive until some vitally urgent bit of information needs to be<br/>
understood with no time for the learning?<br/>
<br/>
So is cursive obsolete?  Did any of your kids learn cursive?  How?  Why?<br/>
