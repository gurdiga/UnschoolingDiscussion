 </span></blockquote>Dear Rachel,<br/>
I am using Oak Meadow this year with my 11yo daughter. We used the <br/>
5th grade curriculum this year. She likes having the structure to <br/>
work with. We abandoned the English component early in the school <br/>
year but have kept using the US History and Environmental Science <br/>
lessons. We read through them to get the info and sometimes she picks <br/>
an activity to do. She&#39;s also been reading a lot of historical <br/>
novels. We&#39;ve gotten good at noticing the difference between accurate <br/>
info and dumb textbook writing. She is of course free to criticize <br/>
the text at any time, which can be half the fun sometimes. There&#39;s a <br/>
great book called &quot;Lies My Teacher Told me which explains the <br/>
problems with US History textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line for me with curriculum is that my kids asked for it <br/>
after spending most of their childhoods unschooling. The structure <br/>
must serve us, if we feel we are serving it then we have to regroup.<br/>

I agree with this. My 11yo daughter used the fifth grade curriculum <br/>
this year. We discarded the English portion after the  first month or <br/>
two. She continied to read the US Historyand Environmental Science <br/>
lessons for the rest of the school year. She likes the structure and <br/>
the content but gets annoyed with the somewhat condescending and <br/>
repetitive writing style. Of course she is free to criticize the <br/>
curriculum which is in itself a learning experience. She does lots of <br/>
extra reading on her own and occasionally does one of the projects <br/>
suggested in the curriculum. One of the really neat things that has <br/>
happened is that right when the science curricilum suggested planting <br/>
an organic garden, our friends invited her to help with theirs.The <br/>
bottom line is for the structure to serve the person rather then for <br/>
the person to serve the structure. -Amalia Darling-</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85172656">This made me think of Laurie starting college. She was taking 7 <br/>
classes (21 hours) and working 32-40 hours a week at the bookstore, <br/>
bringing in those A&#39;s and thrived on it. Whew! I was exhausted just <br/>
taking 12 hours.<br/>
