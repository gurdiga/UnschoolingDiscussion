<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072224213">My boys have a friend who used to be over here almost every night.  A few <br/>
times I got really impatient with it and said &quot;Joey, go home.&quot;   But when he was <br/>
15, he quit going to school and said he was homeschooling too.  He lives about <br/>
three blocks away, but he was not at home enough for them to ever talk to <br/>
him.  He would go home MAYBE once or twice a week, for a few hours.  Once he <br/>
walked over there to get an apple because we didn&#39;t have any.  It was a disruption <br/>
of my relationship with the boys for a while, because either I took Joey with <br/>
us somewhere, or we didn&#39;t go.   <br/>
<br/>
Two things bothered me most about the Joey era (which lasted about a year and <br/>
a half):<br/>
<br/>
I had never before that imagined WHY the state would require 180 days of <br/>
attendance for homeschoolers.  &quot;How stupid!&quot; I had thought, but Joey was NOT at <br/>
his house 180 days that year.   He was at our house for way over 250 of them.  <br/>
He was sleeping on the floor in Kirby&#39;s room, usually. <br/>
<br/>
Joey said, when I asked, that he was doing a correspondence school.  &quot;Like <br/>
American School?&quot; I asked.  He looked a little confused, and muttered something <br/>
in the very-vague affirmative.   I don&#39;t know when he would have had time to <br/>
do that, but he did start being at his house a day or two a week, so it&#39;s <br/>
possible.  I don&#39;t think it was happening, though.  I think this: <br/>
<br/>
I think his mom planned, if she got in trouble, to point at me and say he was <br/>
at our house and we were homeschoolers and he was doing whatever all MY boys <br/>
were doing.   <br/>
<br/>
Joey&#39;s mom died last year, of blood clots.  She had been prescribed Comoden <br/>
(I think that&#39;s the blood clot medication, and I probably spelled it wrong) and <br/>
special diet, but she apparently didn&#39;t keep up with that, and she died.  <br/>
Joey&#39;s not here nearly as much anymore, but he&#39;s here a time or two a week, and <br/>
that&#39;s fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Joey&#39;s okay.  He&#39;s intelligent and honest and very shy and could&#39;ve used <br/>
braces and way more attention from his family.  Things like driver&#39;s ed are just <br/>
passing him by.  I dont know what the situation is with his dad, who&#39;s a <br/>
plumbing contractor (I think) and seems not to work much.  He has a dangerous older <br/>
brother who was in mental lock-up for a while for having tried to kill the <br/>
younger brother with a shovel.   Because of that and the obvious lack of concern <br/>
for where Joey was and for how long, I didn&#39;t run him off altogether.  I <br/>
talked to his mom twice.  She was grateful Joey had a better place to go.  I guess <br/>
she was unable or unwilling to just make her own home a better place.  That <br/>
was neglect.  She neglected her own health, too, and neglected to live until her <br/>
children were grown.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re doing can be passed on through ideas and inspirations and example, <br/>
but it&#39;s not transferable and it&#39;s not shared.  Learning happens inside each <br/>
person.  Parenting happens inside each family, in the relationship between <br/>
each child and each parent.   There is optimal unschooling and there is <br/>
half-assed unschooling, and there&#39;s neglect, and generally others neither know nor can <br/>
prove one way or another what is what and who is how.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad for the internet and e-mail and message boards.  We can share more <br/>
information in a week nowadays than existed altogether on the planet about <br/>
unschooling/open-classroom/alternative education/natural learning thirty years <br/>
ago.  We have a HUGE advantage.  But we&#39;re still doing something touchy and <br/>
alternative and that&#39;s not as easy as it looks.<br/>
<br/>
I love these exchanges, but each unschooling mom eventually has to create <br/>
herself an unschooling mom and have her OWN knowledge and her OWN certainty and <br/>
confidence.   <br/>
