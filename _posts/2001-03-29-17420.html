You have just put into words the EXACT reasons I CAN NOT allow my 3 1/2 year <br/>
old to watch any television except childrens PBS shows like Sesame Street and <br/>
Barney.  I&#39;ve been attemtping to share my reasons for limiting TV for my <br/>
children but couldn&#39;t find the right words...thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769603989">Thanks to everyone who has been commenting on the TV question. I have a lot <br/>
to think about. I understand comments such as this--<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;I rather<br/>
appreciate that my kids *aren&#39;t* the ones glued to tv, insipid tv at that,<br/>
when we are out because they know they will get to see it at other times. &quot; <br/>
<br/>
But my kids aren&#39;t home when we aren&#39;t. They are 7mo, 3 yrs, 5 yrs. I guess <br/>
my question was really do you see a difference between children this age and <br/>
older children?  I can see the point that with unrestricted &quot;time&quot; for TV my <br/>
kids would probably not space all day. They are very productive and have <br/>
great imaginations and can spend hours playing with a couple of legos and a <br/>
piece of string :)<br/>
<br/>
I am more concerned about limiting the &quot;content&quot;.  TV is not the same as it <br/>
used to be. I am more concerned with all the advertising and the messages in <br/>
the shows themselves. Do any of you who do not limit &quot;TV time&quot; limit &quot;TV <br/>
Content&quot;?? I am babbling--hope this makes sense, I&#39;m tired:) Thanks so much!</div>

I don&#39;t limit content, exactly, but I tell my children why I think it&#39;s <br/>
not a good idea for them to be watching X-Files with us (it&#39;s going <br/>
to be gruesome, pretty much a given with X-Files!) or why i don&#39;t <br/>
like the program they&#39;re watching (The Tweenies!!  UGH!!  So <br/>
nsaty to each other, and the &#39;grown-up&#39; characters so ineffectual <br/>

make you think you want or ened something so that you go and <br/>
spend your money on it...  They&#39;re going to come into contact with <br/>
all kinds of adverts, billboards, stuff in magazines, etc, so i take the <br/>

her why I disagree :-)<br/>

I&#39;d rather have the opportunity to combat this now, while they&#39;re <br/>
developing their moral senses *grin*  I also don&#39;t believe in hiding <br/>

 </span></blockquote>that was i miscommunication.  i meant &quot;when we are out as a family and a<br/>
tv happens to be on.&quot;  I was reminded of this a month or so ago.  A group<br/>
of kids (mine included) were doing an activity at someone&#39;s house.  As the<br/>
activity was breaking up, the tv happened to be on w/a Blue&#39;s Clues video<br/>
in.  The &quot;tv free&quot; kids were glued to the tv, totally unable to interact<br/>
with others, totally unable to listen to the adults asking htem to get<br/>
ready for their pick up (shoes on, stuff gathered, coats, etc) totally<br/>
oblvivious to what was going on around them.  They were much older than<br/>
the intended audience of Blue&#39;s Clues, too.  And &#39;ive noticed they are the<br/>
same way whenever a tv is on.  I t hink mine used to be that way, too,<br/>
when we were &quot;tv-free&quot;.  My kids are never home when I&#39;m not (unless they<br/>
are with their father and i&#39;m at work).  I found by severly limiting tv, i<br/>
gave it power over them.  and they do go in cycles.  they watch more or<br/>
less depending on where they are in the cycle.  We really only limit<br/>
content as much as we know it will bother the kids, but we will let them<br/>
try anything if they don&#39;t take our word for it (and they usually do trust<br/>
us, although my 5 yo just *had* to try a goosebumps video this week....and<br/>
that lasted all of 3 minutes before he came to me demanding to take it<br/>
back to the library THAT MINUTE it was way too scary (Duh....he can&#39;t<br/>
stand the conflict and suspense in BARNEY).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216976827">LOL, that reminds me of my 5 ds. He used to be waaay<br/>
more senstive than he is now...and now his sis (3) is<br/>
like that now. He&#39;s determined to not be though, it&#39;s<br/>
this thing he&#39;s going thru, I guess. His cousin, too,<br/>
was sooo traumatized by any nature shows with wild<br/>
animals in them at all when he was 5, cuz one time he<br/>
was watching a lion video and the lion started<br/>
fighting with another animal. Not horribly chomping on<br/>
him (yet, anyway, I&#39;m sure that happened later after<br/>
the video was frantically turned off)....he was sooo<br/>
upset by any conflict at all. My son now has this<br/>
thing with thinking he&#39;s a grown-up and insists he can<br/>
handle anything. I say fine, and usually he does good.<br/>
(He&#39;s watched Jurrasic Park several times, and since<br/>
the first time I watched it with him and explained it<br/>
all and how it was not REAL and how they do it in the<br/>
movie making biz, he now explains things like that to<br/>
his sis...but everyone once and awhile he will wake up<br/>
with a scary dream about something he saw in a movie<br/>
and say to me &quot;Mom, don&#39;t ever let me watch that show<br/>
again. It was too scary.&quot; (It&#39;s funny but it&#39;s always<br/>
the more &quot;little kid&quot; movies that I think are fine for<br/>
him that he ends up having dreams about, instead of<br/>
the more &quot;grown up, scary&quot; ones. hm.)<br/>
I remember when i was little my parents letting me<br/>
watch Jaws...who knows why, I was so afraid of<br/>
everything when i was little..but I insisted I could<br/>
take it....and I stayed up BY MYSELF and watched it<br/>
when I was like 7 and was sooo proud of myself cuz I<br/>
got scared just to the &quot;fun&quot; point and I knew that it<br/>
wasn&#39;t real. and cuz they trusted me to make up my own<br/>
mind as to when I thought I couldn&#39;t handle it. <br/>
