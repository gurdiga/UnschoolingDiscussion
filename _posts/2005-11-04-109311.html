When  Simon was an infant there was an episode of Mad About You on that<br/>
I watched  in horror.  They&#39;ve just had their daughter and are<br/>
&quot;training&quot; her to  sleep through the night using the Ferber method. So,<br/>
she cries and they go  in at 5 minutes and then at 10 and whatever<br/>
until she stops. At the end she  finally stops crying and Paul turns to<br/>
Jamie and says something like &quot;we  did it&quot; and Jamie sighs and says<br/>
&quot;Yes, now she&#39;ll know we won&#39;t be there  for her&quot; or something.  It was<br/>
interesting because they were aching to  help their baby daughter, but<br/>
were bound by this desire to do what the  experts said was best.  They<br/>
didn&#39;t handle it lightly, which I  appreciated, but still...it was so<br/>
awful to listen to.  I think I was  letting down milk throughout much<br/>
of the show in  sympathy.<br/>

No, I remember exactly what Jamie said. It was, &quot;We broke her heart.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703734588">Many people come from families that relate(d) so detachedly, the adult <br/>
children now with children of their own can&#39;t remember a time when they<br/>
<br/>
accepted their own needs for attachment.  They lacked sympathy during <br/>
their childhood and have long forgotten when they experienced<br/>
detachment <br/>
from their parents.  A history like this means rejection is expected<br/>
and <br/>
simultaneously frequently goes unrecognized by all involved unless the <br/>
truth about what people need is understood.  To have what people need <br/>
clear in the mind it helps first to experience meeting or having those <br/>
needs met.  It&#39;s crappy that society views these needs as neediness<br/>
even <br/>
in infants let alone children or really all people.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to tell you, Ren, and this isn&#39;t directed at you or anyone<br/>
<br/>
in particular, we know histories like the above aren&#39;t rare.  I often <br/>
wish(ed) to be closer to my parents at 8 and even at 30 but I knew not <br/>
to necessarily expect it.  For me and those like me it&#39;s hard to feel <br/>
secure.  Somehow people are just supposed to make do with head<br/>
knowledge <br/>
when they are loved and cared for.  That just seems so sick to me now <br/>
but there was a time I felt weak for not being able to be happy with<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Our attachment parenting for ds has healed me a great deal.  The good <br/>
thing is it&#39;s not too late to enjoy family life and learn from mistakes<br/>
<br/>
one personally didn&#39;t make and those one makes by default until knowing<br/>
<br/>
better.<br/>
