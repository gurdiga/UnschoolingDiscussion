<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I get your point. I just wonder how can someone ask about homeopathy if they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what homeopathy can help with? Most people haven&#39;t even heard about<br/>
&gt; homeopathy, ever. Others think it&#39;s good for colds and flus, because that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what they were told at their health food store. Everybody knows what a violin<br/>
&gt; is...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking about what I wrote before I went to sleep last night, and it<br/>
occured to me that I should have said medical adivce, not homeopathic<br/>
advice.  I was too tierd to get up and fix it.  You are definitely right<br/>
that not everyone knows what it is, and hence couldn&#39;t ask directly about<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, I won&#39;t post anymore, ok?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve already said you wouldn&#39;t but you still are, so I&#39;m assuming you LIKE<br/>
being here and have things to say.  Joyce has made it clear that you are<br/>
welcome, and merely asked you to think about your style.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
insinuated that you shouldn&#39;t post, and it wouldn&#39;t be my place to do so<br/>
anyway.<br/>
