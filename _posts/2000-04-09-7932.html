<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090341178">Hello, my name is Amy and I am a beginning homeschooler with my 6 year<br/>
old son.  We live in New York state and the first few months of this year<br/>
I have followed a curriculum which I invented for Brandon, but we have<br/>
crossed over into more of an unschooling approach as the weeks go by.  <br/>
He seems to be more motivated this way, and my ultimate goal is to raise<br/>
an independent, self motivated learner.  My only question seems to be how<br/>
to get around the state laws that require testing in certain years in my<br/>
state, and how one would prepare for such tests using an unschooling<br/>
approach.  I am a former fifth grade teacher who is finding it difficult<br/>
to ignore schedules and educational guidelines, even though I know that<br/>
ultimately they are not relevant for the learner.  Is there anyone out<br/>
there who lives in New York who has had experience with this, or knows<br/>
someone who has?    Thank you!  Amy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-56023003">Amy,<br/>
<br/>
I cannot answer specifically for New York, but in OR, most <br/>
unschooling families that I know do not even register their kids with <br/>
the state.  As far as the state knows, they don&#39;t even exist (other <br/>
than a birth certificate).  In OR, if one registers as a homeschooler, <br/>
they must be tested every couple of years.  I have also noted that <br/>
the homeschool assessments in OR are so easy that all of our <br/>
unschoolers who have had to take them pass.  There are two <br/>
recommendations:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Pull your son out of the system completely (or as far as you <br/>
can).<br/>
2)  Check out the state laws requiring testing and see if they are <br/>
easy enough to get around.  I was recently informed that in OR <br/>
(and someone please correct me if I have been misinformed), <br/>
homeschoolers need to take a subject based test of their choice <br/>
and score in the 26th percentile.  Most unschoolers score at least <br/>
in the 75th when they can choose the test in their favourite subject.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this offers some help.<br/>

I think this is something that people tend to forget.  They hear &quot;test&quot; and <br/>
think their child has to do great on the test.  I would find out what the <br/>
passing grade is -- 26% or whatever -- and aim at that and teach the kids <br/>
that it&#39;s just paperwork for the bureaucrats if we had that requirement here. <br/>
 But we don&#39;t.  So what do I know.  :)   I just wouldn&#39;t stress about doing <br/>
terribly well on them or having the kids take them too seriously.<br/>

Dunno why it sarted doing that......or I perhaps mashed a function key (or someone else did) and don&#39;t which one to use to undo it. Irritating.  And I&#39;m sorry I cluttered up the list with all that hard to read stuff.  My language style is hard enough to interpret. It seems to be rlated to the space bar and and &quot;enter&quot;.  Anyway, I think I&#39;m the guilty party. And I don&#39;t know what I did.  Sorry.  I never did read the &quot;how to&quot; books or the manuals, or learn the appropriate jargon. Not a wierd question at all.......I&#39;m baffled. I even sent posts to myself with and without spell check to see what would happen or if &quot;forward&quot; was doing it or &quot;font&quot; or what.  Again, I&#39;m sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834099499">Hi Nancy,<br/>
&nbsp is a code used in writing webpages that forces spaces to appear.<br/>
When the actual words appear instead of a space it is often because of<br/>
some formatting problem either via the person writing the code, the computer<br/>
that generated it, or a browser now being able to view it. <br/>
<br/>
In the case of e-mail, it might be that your receiving e-mail that is delivered<br/>
in html but from an e-mail program that is only reading it as text. You can<br/>
try a couple of different functions under Edit My Membership to see if it<br/>
makes the e-mails appear differently. But for the most part as long as I<br/>
can figure out what a person is meaning I often don&#39;t worry about the formatting<br/>
unless someone asks (like you did).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425608649">I dont have any specific questions. I just would like everyone to comment on how they feel their children stay motivated. I have only been &quot;un&quot; schooling since December but I have been home schooling since October 2000. <br/>
With our &quot;unschooling&quot; now, I dont require them to do anything but occasionally write in their journals. I also read to them daily and they have a daily quiet time. But I guess what I am asking is what are your days like? And while I have seen some progress, I worry a little about wether or not they will progress overall.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717894941">Hi Vivian,<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of thoughts about motivation.<br/>
<br/>
The first and most important is that what looks like unmotivated <br/>
wasting of time, might not be so.  For years, I thought my girls <br/>
weren&#39;t learning anything.  I worried but for various reasons didn&#39;t <br/>
push them into more structure.  Looking back on it, that was just a <br/>
combination of luck and following my heart.  My head was worrying, but <br/>
in my heart I was sure they were fine.<br/>
<br/>
And now, I have an even better reason to be confident in the girls.  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen the other side and know that it is recognizable if you watch <br/>
the right signs.  My son was not so much unmotivated but incapable of <br/>
learning on his own.  He was becoming unhappier and unhealthy by the <br/>
day.  To say I was becoming concerned is an understatement.  <br/>
Fortunately, at just about the time I started really worrying, my mom <br/>
move into the other house on this property.  SHe is a retired school <br/>
teacher and was quite capable of figuring out exactly what he needed <br/>
to learn.  He goes to her house daily for &quot;school&quot; and is quite happy <br/>
about it.  His unhappiness was frustration at the fact that he needed <br/>
more than I could give him.  He needs structure.  In fact, his daily <br/>
schedule is being disrupted this week.  He goes back to grandma&#39;s in <br/>
the afternoon to watch his TV shows in the quiet house and she took a <br/>
tutoring job and won&#39;t be home so he&#39;ll have to watch here now.  I&#39;m <br/>
not looking forward to the adjustment period. <br/>
<br/>
But the difference was that while the girls were looking unmotivated, <br/>
they were never particularly unhappy.  And now, the amount of <br/>
knowledge they have crammed in their heads amazes even me.  Rachel <br/>
knows more about plants and gardening than I ever thought possible.  <br/>
They both know tons of science.  In fact the chem class they go to is <br/>
really not teaching them a lot that they didn&#39;t already know.  They <br/>
just go to play with the lab equipment.<br/>
<br/>
I really believe that if you are in touch with your children and truly <br/>
listen to their needs, you will know if they are getting what they <br/>
need.  Just make sure that you are listening to them and not to what <br/>
some outside cultural influence is telling you they should be doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858649134">If you are requiring them to write in their journals and have quiet time<br/>
then you are not unschooling. That&#39;s okay to do, it&#39;s just not unschooling.<br/>
So, if you want to really reap the benefits of unschooling, let them pick up<br/>
books for the joy of it. Let them write for fun. While you are doing this<br/>
for them, spend some time watching them , noticing what they ARE doing, not<br/>
just what you expect them to do. It takes a while for those of us who have<br/>
been through the system to shed the thinking. Real learning doesn&#39;t look<br/>
remotely like school.<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean sit back and stop teaching, eventually they will<br/>
pick up a math text and start doing problems. It means moving away from<br/>
school in all it&#39;s forms,  the expectations, the grade levels, the what your<br/>
Nth grader needs to know.<br/>
If your child has an interest in, say, Chimpanzees. eventually picture books<br/>
of primates won&#39;t be enough. They may want to know about what chimps eat, or<br/>
how they communicate, eventually this desire to know more will push them to<br/>
read, in order to gain more info. You will help along the way by continuing<br/>
to read out loud, scouring the papers and local web sites for cool things to<br/>
offer them, help them find answers to their questions but there will be<br/>
times when they want an answer and you are in the bathroom, or on the phone<br/>
or not home. It will push them to search the net, again reading. They will<br/>
start to do &quot;research&quot; which may involve looking in the library catalog<br/>
system for more books and videos. They may hear of Jane Goodall giving a<br/>
seminar on chimps and ask to go to that. Because they are interested, they<br/>
won&#39;t NEED to take notes (but they may want to - there&#39;s the writing) they<br/>
will remember because they are interested.<br/>
That&#39;s unschooling. Now replace chimps and all related words with whatever<br/>
your kids are interested in. Robotics, music, pokemon, nascar, wrestling,<br/>
astronomy, anything.<br/>
Kids learn best by example. If they see you interested in a subject (not<br/>
because you think it&#39;s something they ought to learn but becasue you are<br/>
really interested) They see you doing all that I said above, and you are<br/>
enjoying yourself. They will want to do that too.<br/>
You mentioned seeing progress. My children are progressing every day. So am<br/>
I. What type of progress are you looking for? Progress through the school<br/>
curriculums? That&#39;s not going to happen, they are learning naturally and<br/>
school learning is unnatural.<br/>
Are they interested in things? anything? even if it is TV, video games,<br/>
aggressive skating or other non-schooly things, that&#39;s ok. They need time to<br/>
deschool.  They were in PS for a while, then school-at-home, then relaxed<br/>
homeschooling until now. They themselves need to learn that they will learn<br/>
outside of school, but they won&#39;t until you truly truly believe it your<br/>
self. And by requiring reading & writing you are giving them the message<br/>
that you don&#39;t believe.<br/>
There are many experienced unschoolers here and on the unschooling.com<br/>
message boards. You will find alot of stories there that inspire to let go<br/>
of &quot;old thinking&quot; and unschool. Ask the parents of the unschooled teens if<br/>
it really works.<br/>
I does if you stop trying to work it.<br/>

  Hi Vivian,<br/>
<br/>
  I have a couple of thoughts about motivation.<br/>
<br/>
  The first and most important is that what looks like unmotivated <br/>
  wasting of time, might not be so.  For years, I thought my girls <br/>
  weren&#39;t learning anything.  I worried but for various reasons didn&#39;t <br/>
  push them into more structure.  Looking back on it, that was just a <br/>
  combination of luck and following my heart.  My head was worrying, but <br/>
  in my heart I was sure they were fine.<br/>
<br/>
  And now, I have an even better reason to be confident in the girls.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-176118938">First off - the journaling is for them. they have requested it and I just am a reminder that they do it. I dont read, or correct or ask them to write any thing specific. The second thing is that I read to them again because they request it. And as for quiet time, it is a time for them to rest or sleep (as my 18 month old needs too as does my 6 year old) and my 8 year old builds tracks for his cars and plays quietly in his room. I see nothing even remotely school like about any of these things.<br/>
I do require them to do their chores, but they live here and must contribute also! They also help me make grocery lists and clip coupons and cook and grocery shop etc etc.<br/>
As I said I am not really asking a question as much as I am curious what other unschoolers do all day? I am trying to stimulate some discussion I guess.Am I saying any of this correctly? haha- I feel as though I am rambling on and on. <br/>

You asked if there are consequences to not journaling. No there are none. Other than they may not remember what they were so anxious to write down. I try to let them enjoy just real life and all the situations that arise. As I stated, they must have quiet time in their rooms. I do notice with out it they are unbearable by dinner and so I am!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531601178">Hi Vivian,<br/>
<br/>
Completely off topic, but have you read The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood? One of the main characters is named Vivian (Vivi for short) and seeing your name reminded me of that book. If you haven&#39;t read it, consider it! I really enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just thought I&#39;d share how we are unschooling in our family.<br/>
I have 2 boys, 9 & 10 (soon to be 11) and we&#39;ve been unschooling since September. I homeschooled them for 5 years previously.<br/>
Since we started, we have changed almost every aspect of our lives. Unschooling applies to EVERYTHING around here. After learning as much as I could about unschooling and how it works best, I figured if I wanted unschooling to work like it was supposed to, I needed to go &quot;all the way&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Since unschooling I have dropped any and all expectations required of my boys. The only thing I expect from them is to treat others and themselves respectfully and not to hurt each other.<br/>
So, that means that I don&#39;t make them do any schoolwork anymore, like math, spelling, grammar, science, history, etc...<br/>
They have unlimited tv viewing access all day long. I have removed the rules of when they can or can&#39;t watch tv and how long.<br/>
They have unlimited computer and/or gameboy playing time all day long, as long as they want.<br/>
I used to require that they do chores around the house, but I stopped that too. They even had to take turn&#39;s doing dishes every night, but that too is stopped.<br/>
<br/>
What have all these changes done to our household? Brought chaos and confusion and spoiled kids you might wonder?<br/>
No, in fact, compared to before unschooling, we have much more peace and joy and most importantly, more love. I&#39;ve found that since I&#39;ve dropped all expectations of my boys, I no longer get dissapointed in them (for something they didn&#39;t complete or accomplish). They are simply allowed to &quot;be&quot;, to do whatever they want to do. I love them and appreciate them more now than every before. My whole perception of them has changed for the better.<br/>
<br/>
About chores, I have a lot of prior experiences with all different chore systems. It always ended up the same - me nagging at them to do their chores (even if they were getting paid for it) and me and them feeling terrible.<br/>
I&#39;ve gone back to doing all the sweeping, vacuuming, laundry, bathroom cleaning, cooking, etc. all by myself. But you know what I found out? That when I don&#39;t require them to do chores, after a while they will spontaneously do odd cleaning jobs around the house without me telling them to do so. They really do have their own desire to help out around the house, but don&#39;t appreciate being told to do so. Imagine how you would feel if your dh TOLD you it was time to clean the toilet, wash the windows, vacuum the floors, etc. I don&#39;t know about you, but I would get pretty upset! So that&#39;s why I felt it was best to change the way we handled chores around here.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m not telling ANYBODY to change their lives and live the way that we do. That would be CRAZY! :-) But I am so happy since unschooling and it has fit our family like a glove. Sorry this turned out to be so long, but I got on a roll! Just sharing.....<br/>

With our &quot;unschooling&quot; now, I dont require them to do anything but occasionally write in their journals. I also read to them daily and they have a daily quiet time. But I guess what I am asking is what are your days like? And while I have seen some progress, I worry a little about wether or not they will progress overall.<br/>

  Hi Vivian,<br/>
<br/>
  Completely off topic, but have you read The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood? One of the main characters is named Vivian (Vivi for short) and seeing your name reminded me of that book. If you haven&#39;t read it, consider it! I really enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, just thought I&#39;d share how we are unschooling in our family.<br/>
  I have 2 boys, 9 & 10 (soon to be 11) and we&#39;ve been unschooling since September. I homeschooled them for 5 years previously.<br/>
  Since we started, we have changed almost every aspect of our lives. Unschooling applies to EVERYTHING around here. After learning as much as I could about unschooling and how it works best, I figured if I wanted unschooling to work like it was supposed to, I needed to go &quot;all the way&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  Since unschooling I have dropped any and all expectations required of my boys. The only thing I expect from them is to treat others and themselves respectfully and not to hurt each other.<br/>
  So, that means that I don&#39;t make them do any schoolwork anymore, like math, spelling, grammar, science, history, etc...<br/>
  They have unlimited tv viewing access all day long. I have removed the rules of when they can or can&#39;t watch tv and how long.<br/>
  They have unlimited computer and/or gameboy playing time all day long, as long as they want.<br/>
  I used to require that they do chores around the house, but I stopped that too. They even had to take turn&#39;s doing dishes every night, but that too is stopped.<br/>
<br/>
  What have all these changes done to our household? Brought chaos and confusion and spoiled kids you might wonder?<br/>

<br/>
I have a 3 1/2 yr old and an 11 month old. TV seems to be an issue in my house. If I let Shawn watch all he wants and whatever he wants I find that his behavior deteriorates...so do you find that some things need to be controlled until a certain maturity occurs? or am I being too concerned over it?  I fully intend and consider myself unschooling. I don&#39;t expect Shawn to DO anything other than behave like any normal 3 yr old...and sometimes he truly surprises me and I think I have a 5 yr old in the house! He is very articulate and loves documentaries and movies about mummies. We&#39;ve had a number of conversations-which he initiated-on why people die and what happens etc, etc. He loves watching Nik jr and Disney and Noggin....and at night he always wants to watch Junkyard Wars on TLC  and of course on the weekend he cant get enough of Monster Jam on TNN :)  My boy loves monster trucks...well actually all form of motor vehicles. And my 11 month old girl seems to also enjoy playing cars and says vrrooom quite clearly.  She also kisses all the stuffed animals and dolls in the house...of her own initiative:)  I am continually amazed at the difference between them that seems to be solely due to gender differences as I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t parent her much differently than I did him at the same age. Have any of you come across this in your family???<br/>
<br/>
This was  a lot longer than I intended...guess I&#39;m no longer lurking:)<br/>
<br/>
Beth- busy mommy to Shawn and Shannon, my precious angels.<br/>
<br/>
oh...today we started intense potty training....I think I&#39;m not using the unschooling method here because I initiated it, but Shawn had NO accidents today and went to bathroom to pee a number of times without telling me! So I&#39;m pretty sure my gut instincts were right and he is ready, but was holding out for the attention due to little sister. What is your experience with this?<br/>
