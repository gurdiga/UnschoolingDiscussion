&quot;Children... do much of their learning in great bursts of passion and <br/>
enthusiasm. Except for those physical skills which can&#39;t be learned any other <br/>
way, children rarely learn on the slow, steady schedules that schools make <br/>
for them. They are more likely to be insatiably curious for a while about <br/>
some particular interest, and to read, write, talk, and ask questions about <br/>
it for hours a day and for days on end. Then suddenly they may drop that <br/>
interest and turn to something comepletely different, or even for a while <br/>
seem to have no interests at all. This usually means that for the time being <br/>
they have all the information on that subject that they can digest, and need <br/>
to explore the world in a different way, or perhaps simply get a firmer grip <br/>
on what they already know.&quot;<br/>

Collections<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re five and six high in egg cartons of rocks. &lt;g&gt;  Not painted rocks but <br/>
found crystals and minerals and we&#39;re going collecting again on Saturday.  We <br/>
have a lot of rocks on our table for easy viewing under the microscope but <br/>
they&#39;re spreading out now to the bookshelves and coffee table and my kitchen <br/>
window sill.   We just made a find at our little city park, of petrified wood <br/>
along the upper creek bank.  We didn&#39;t have anything to dig with but our <br/>
hands and came away with thirty or so good pieces, some with fossils.  We&#39;ll <br/>
have to go back with our shovel and see what else is there.<br/>

Aaron&#39;s Treasures<br/>
How to nurture your child&#39;s urge to collect (without letting it drive you <br/>
nuts) <br/>
by Eric D. Gyllenhaal   <br/>
<br/>
It started early last spring as the snow finally melted, revealing the sparse <br/>
grass of our neighbors&#39; yards. Aaron&#39;s sharp, 4-year-old eyes soon discovered <br/>
wonderful things littered on the sticky ground. He searched, selected and <br/>
collected the best of them--bottle caps, broken bits of toys, lost barrettes, <br/>
even a few coins--and stuffed them in the mesh pocket of his backpack. Then <br/>
he brought them home and joyfully displayed them to his family. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Treasures,&quot; he proclaimed, and so they were. Aaron&#39;s treasures became the <br/>
latest passion in our collection-packed home. <br/>
<br/>
Aaron accumulated a large cardboard box of treasures before the end of May. <br/>
Five-year-old Ethan joined in the adventure, collecting seeds, rocks and bugs <br/>
instead of human litter, but he&#39;d always been a naturalist at heart. <br/>
<br/>
I empathized. I understood their need to constantly scan the ground. I&#39;m also <br/>
a born naturalist and collector, having been raised in a nature center, <br/>
trained in geology, and often employed in museums. I carried zippered plastic <br/>
bags in my pockets and held them open so the boys could save their finds. My <br/>
wife sighed, stuffed a few plastic bags in her pockets, and played along. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d been through this before. We first learned what kind of family we&#39;d <br/>
become when Ethan, at the age of 1, developed a passion for turtles. We <br/>
visited live turtles at the zoo, searched for mounted turtles in natural <br/>
history museums, borrowed turtle books from the library, and scanned videos <br/>
and nature shows for brief glimpses of his favorite turtle, the &quot;great big <br/>
Alligator Snap.&quot; Soon there was a collection at the center of his passion. <br/>
Ethan collected plastic turtles by the dozen, begging us to buy him more. <br/>
Plastic turtles marched across Ethan&#39;s floor, ate whatever plastic worms he <br/>
had to offer, and sloshed about in his bath. <br/>
<br/>
Ethan has lived his way through many passions since then: dinosaurs, seeds, <br/>
trains, shells, insects, Pokémon, rocks--then dinosaurs, insects, trains and <br/>
Pokémon again. Each passion lasts four months or so, sometimes overlapping <br/>
with the previous one, and each involves a collection: plastic dinosaurs, <br/>
dried seeds, wooden trains, real shells, live and dead insects, Pokémon toys <br/>
and cards, and boxes full of rocks. Ethan&#39;s bedroom looks like a museum <br/>
storeroom because he never lets anything go.&quot; <br/>

Mr. Gyllenhaal includes suggestions for organizing and growing collections, <br/>
along with compelling arguments for assisting your child in his collecting <br/>
passion or at least not getting in the way.<br/>

Disposable Checklists for Unschoolers <br/>
<br/>
Beginning homeschoolers are often afraid. Sometimes they homeschool for a <br/>
while, and a curriculum keeps the fear to a manageable level. Sometimes a <br/>
curriculum is a workable alternative to school for a family. For some it is <br/>
not. Some of those give up and the kids go back to school. Some give up the <br/>
curriculum and move toward unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Beginning unschoolers are often afraid. Without the touchstone of a schedule <br/>
and a list, they don&#39;t know how they will see progress, or how they will <br/>
recognize &quot;sufficient effort&quot; on the part of children or parents. <br/>
<br/>
For some people, treating their first months of unschooling as summer <br/>
vacation, or a month or two of Saturdays is sufficient, but some people <br/>
schedule even their Saturdays and vacations. &quot;Just hang out with your kids&quot; <br/>
sounds torturous to them, and may be more frightening than abandoning public <br/>
school was. <br/>
<br/>
Here, then, are some possible replacement checklists and scheduling aids for <br/>
those who truly want to unschool but who can&#39;t breathe well or sleep soundly <br/>
without a plan. <br/>
<br/>
Sink-Like-a-Stone Method: Instead of skimming the surface of a subject or <br/>
interest, drop anchor there for a while. If someone is interested in chess, <br/>
mess with chess. Not just the game, but the structure and history of <br/>
tournaments. How do chess clocks work? What is the history of the names and <br/>
shapes of the playing pieces? What other board games are also traditional and <br/>
which are older than chess? If you&#39;re near a games shop or a fancy gift shop, <br/>
wander by and look at different chess sets on display. It will be like a <br/>
teeny chess museum. The interest will either increase or burn out - don&#39;t <br/>
push it past the child&#39;s interest. <br/>
<br/>
When someone understands the depth and breadth of one subject, he will know <br/>
that any other subject has breadth and depth. <br/>

Quo Vadis Magazine <br/>
<br/>
I recently received this announcement for Quo Vadis, described as a Magazine <br/>
by and for self-educating people of all varieties. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This magazine will contain articles, stories, poetry, announcements, <br/>
shameless self-promotion, etc., written by you, to fascinate, entertain, and <br/>
inspire. <br/>
<br/>
As a brief introduction, my name is Zack Shuman, and I live in Olympia WA?. <br/>
I&#39;ve home/unschooled my whole life and I&#39;ve been part of the Not Back To <br/>
School Camp (NBTSC) community since it began in 1996. My goal with this <br/>
magazine is to help foster a community of people who see self-education and <br/>
learning as a philosophy for a lifetime, not simply and alternative for 6-18 <br/>
year olds, to the mainstream American schooling systems. If you are a <br/>
home/unschooling parent, start thinking of yourself as an autodidact with <br/>
kids. If you are a home/unschooler, start thinking of yourself as a person <br/>
with a passion for life, and for learning, who happens to be young. And if <br/>
you have no prior connection to the home/unschooling movement, or the NBTSC <br/>
community, welcome, it&#39;s your love of life and learning that make you a part <br/>
of this community, not your educational history. <br/>
<br/>
Want to be a part of this? Good! ...cause I&#39;m not writing all the content <br/>
myself!&quot;<br/>

How to beat the heat<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It was hot in Montana today.  We get hot here but not humid so mostly folks <br/>
can stand it.  We stand it by playing in the pool.  *The pool* is a ten foot <br/>
inflatable rim, 36&quot; deep vinyl kids pool, but oh, is it lovely in the heat.<br/>
<br/>
However fun they are vinyl pools need to be cleaned sometimes and today it <br/>
just wasn&#39;t going to wait anymore.  So I drained it and floundered around in <br/>
there scrubbing and being hot and thinking almost anything would be better <br/>
than what I was doing.  It was an all day thing, draining, cleaning and <br/>
refilling and then mowing the lawn and what not.<br/>
  <br/>
But when I came in Dylan had made ice cream.  Not ice cream really, non dairy <br/>
frozen desert.  Last week or so we borrowed my moms old, (really old) ice <br/>
cream maker.  It&#39;s the &quot;Dolly Madison Home Ice Cream Freezer&quot;, and says <br/>
*HUSKY* on the label, and my mom got it  when my brother was little, about <br/>
fifty four years ago.  We made a batch the first day and it was fun, but we <br/>
hadn&#39;t tried it again.  While I was squishing around in the pool he was <br/>
secretly picking strawberries, and cracking ice and measuring soy milk and <br/>
sugar and vanilla and making me the happiest mom in Deer Lodge, Montana.  <br/>
Yessiree.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll remember forever how good it tasted and how pleased he looked and how <br/>
lucky I felt. How it felt to sit in our little kitchen and look out into the <br/>
back yard, with the grass freshly cut and the bright blue pool filling up <br/>
with water and see Dylan&#39;s happy face across the table.   And I won&#39;t be <br/>
grumpy next time I have to clean the pool either, because however yucky the <br/>
pool is, the kid who likes the pool is awesome. &quot;<br/>

Cool Comfort<br/>
<br/>
Recently my father said to me that he thought TV and video games are <br/>
unhealthy because they lure children inside during the summer. I told him I <br/>
think the blame lies with air conditioning. On pleasant days my children bang <br/>
outside at first light and don&#39;t return until hunger strikes. Hot days are <br/>
another matter, however. When even the big shade tree in our front yard <br/>
offers little relief from the heat, the neighborhood children all vanish into <br/>
their houses, with the blinds drawn against the glare and the air <br/>
conditioning pouring out liquid cool. When I was their age, neither our house <br/>
nor those of our neighbors was air conditioned. When heat waves struck we&#39;d <br/>
flee the stifling air inside to spend the day roaming in search of shade and <br/>
cooling breezes, begging for sprinklers and Popsicles. <br/>
<br/>
This month marks the 100th anniversary of air-conditioning (depending on <br/>
whose history you read). Celebrate by checking out a new book exploring &quot;how <br/>
the idea of &quot;cooling&quot; became firmly embedded in the social perceptions and <br/>
expectations of Americans, transforming our definition of comfort and the way <br/>
we live, work, and play.&quot;<br/>

Fundamentalist Unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;....people assume unschoolers are not going to be bound by some sort of <br/>
dogma or fundamentalism.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is &quot;something&quot; though - it isn&#39;t &quot;anything goes.&quot; It does <br/>
comprise beliefs about how people learn and it is a philosophy of education. <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are not bound by any dogma - there is no authority who lays it <br/>
out, not even John Holt really did that - his thought was always a work in <br/>
progress, his ideas and insights were always developing. <br/>
<br/>
But, there is something to the idea of &quot;fundamental&quot; that strikes me as <br/>
important. I realize that &quot;fundamentalism&quot; was probably meant as an insult, <br/>
but getting people to look at what is really &quot;fundamental&quot; does seem to me to <br/>
be very appropriate unschooling advice. <br/>
<br/>
Something is fundamental when it is one of the basic constituents without <br/>
which a thing or system would not be what it is. So, for example, we could <br/>
probably all agree that it is fundamental to unschooling that a parent gives <br/>
up preplanning a systematic progressive curriculum of study for their child. <br/>
Lots of what people ask about or seem to be confused or disagree about does <br/>
have to do with what is fundamental to unschooling.<br/>

Final Thought<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How did it come to pass that I was the one to develop the theory of <br/>
relativity? The reason, I think, is that a normal adult never stops to think <br/>
about problems of space and time. These are things which he has thought of as <br/>
a child. But my intellectual development was retarded, as a result of which I <br/>
began to wonder about space and time only when I had already grown up. <br/>
Naturally I could go deeper into the problem than a child with normal <br/>
abilities.&quot;<br/>
