<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451483998">I agree that the damage is different, but I think sometimes the words can do a worse damage than the physical abuse.

Now, granted, the physical damage was never severe enough to cause &quot;real&quot; damage that anyone would notice.  I was able to keep the feeling that I could &quot;fight back&quot;, which really meant &quot;get away&quot;, and never felt ultimately hopeless.<br/>

Maybe it depends on the child.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t want any child to be slapped but I think being told &quot;you&#39;re lazy&quot;<br/>
  &quot;you&#39;ll never amount to anything&quot; &quot;You never do anything right&quot; &quot;why do you<br/>
  always have to bug me&quot; can and does do just as much damage to a child.  ..<br/>

<br/>
  Less damage.  Different damage.   <br/>

I was smacked as a child. I don&#39;t feel bad when I remember those times-I<br/>
never have. I do remember most of the hurtful or careless comments that came<br/>
my way however. It has always been the things people have said to me that<br/>
have scarred me.<br/>
<br/>
I have smacked my kids. (Don&#39;t anymore and NEVER will again) But I have<br/>
always been very careful about what I say. Even when my husband and I were<br/>
having serious marital problems I would try so hard to be careful about what<br/>
I said  because I have found that words stick and I never wanted to say<br/>
anything I didn&#39;t mean or would regret saying.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because I have  tried  hard to be truthful and kind, I have assumed<br/>
that others are the same, and if so why wouldn&#39;t every nasty thing ever said<br/>
about me be true. Sorry,  I&#39;m thinking out loud here. I&#39;ll go and think<br/>
&#39;quietly&#39;.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this words versus hitting thing. I do believe the<br/>
damage being done is very different, but I&#39;m also not so sure the hitting is<br/>
sometimes worse. I can remember two separate (thank you Sandra!) occasions<br/>
as a child when I was struck by my mom. I remember them both well. Although<br/>
the first one I can&#39;t remember what I did to get spanked.  It was<br/>
humiliating for me. And although I can remember them, I&#39;m not so sure after<br/>
a while they were traumatic for me. I remember lots more of what has been<br/>
said to me. I had a much harder time dealing with those words, and some<br/>
still very much with me today, than the hitting. Maybe it was how I was as a<br/>
child, maybe it was that there were only two occasions and nothing on a<br/>
regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
But I also look into my adult life and know that I was in a very verbally<br/>
abusive relationship. He never laid a hand on me to hurt me, but the verbal<br/>
abuse was so bad that there were times when I would just think in my head<br/>
that I wished he would just hit me and get it over with. Then it would be<br/>
over instead of continuing for hours and even days. And just to clear up<br/>
that thought, I had been in a physically abusive relationship before that<br/>
one, and for me, it wasn&#39;t half as bad. Maybe I&#39;m just weird.<br/>
<br/>
And even though I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s always worse, I do not believe in hitting<br/>
of any kind to &quot;discipline.&quot;<br/>
