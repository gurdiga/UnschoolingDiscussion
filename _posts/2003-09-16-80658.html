<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280625019">It&#39;s funny, My youngest is 3 and still nursing.  That brings my total<br/>
nursing years to 10 so far &lt;sheepish grin&gt; In all these years of nursing I<br/>
can remember only a few times when I noticed someone become uncomfortable.<br/>
Most of those instances were when I had a very young infant and someone was<br/>
just *waiting* for the baby to want to nurse.  They knew it would happen and<br/>
were anticipating what should be their response.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that disgust and phrases like &quot;whip it out&quot; are often thinly<br/>
veiled hostility and while I&#39;m not all that interested in accomodating<br/>
people who would speak to me that way, I certainly don&#39;t want my children to<br/>
be exposed to this type of hostile response and I also recognize there  are<br/>
some people who are (sadly) genuinely uncomfortable with the thought of<br/>
bresastfeeding in general.  These might not say anything.<br/>
<br/>
I learned in LLL that lifting a shirt from the bottom is more discrete than<br/>
buttoning down from the top but you&#39;d be surprised how many new moms simply<br/>
don&#39;t think of this at first.  It is obvious if you live in a cold climate<br/>
but not here in SoCal.(Also, it&#39;s easy to make your own nursing shirt by<br/>
layering two light weight shirts of the same color.)<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it&#39;s much quicker and more dicrete than a big blanket over the<br/>
shoulder.  Some other ideas to try:  A sun hat, hankerchief, even a book or<br/>
newspaper to screen the &quot;contact point&quot; where you might becomeexposed. If<br/>
you do use a blanket it&#39;s better just over baby and a bit to cover his face<br/>
than over both of you whichjust screams&quot;look over here!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My 3yo likes to nurse standing up while I sit in a chair.  I have had entire<br/>
conversations with people who had no idea that she was nursing bc I obscured<br/>
the view with a jacket or something.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, with my friends and family, I make no special effort to hide our<br/>
breast feeding but occasionally, i know there are people with whom I&#39;d<br/>
rather not discuss it.  Discretion gives me more power to choose when and<br/>
with whom I wish to talk about these parenting issues.<br/>
<br/>
There was a time in each of my three kids nursing relationship that they<br/>
wanted mor of me - more exposure, posession of &quot;the other side&quot; or lifting,<br/>
unbuttoning etc.  With each child, all that was neccesary was consistent,<br/>
kind, explanation that &quot;mommy wants to be covered up.&quot;  It may take a few<br/>
weeks but by the time they&#39;re doing these things they were usually old<br/>
enough to understand this.<br/>
<br/>
If you got this far you&#39;re likely a nursing mom yourself.  Thanks for<br/>
putting up with my long ramblings.<br/>
<br/>
sincerely<br/>
