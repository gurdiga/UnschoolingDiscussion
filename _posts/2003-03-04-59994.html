<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278134631">Hi Nancy<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to try to send this again.  The first one got quarantined for some reason.  Pretty sure I&#39;m virus-free...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Try this folder and go through the archives.  I am reading through it also.<br/>
Some good stuff there.<br/>
