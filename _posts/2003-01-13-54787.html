<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109556655">Its not much, but it says a lot for kids learning on thier own, of thier own <br/>
curiousity.  I picked up 7 snack size candy bars at the store ( they are 7 <br/>
for $1.00)  I bought 3 kit kats, 3 Reeses and one Almond Joy( for me *g).   <br/>
JP was handing them out.  Anna said, how many do we get?  I said, well, I <br/>
bought 7.. JP said.. so, we each get two, and Moma, you just get one ( <br/>
apologetic look from him.. lol)  I said, yeah, thats right, I already ate my <br/>
candy bar.  JP said. we can each have one kit kat and one reeses, right?  I <br/>
said, well, thats what I bought, but you guys can trade if you want.  <br/>
Everybody wanted one of each.. JP handed out the Kit kats. .. but. OH NO.. <br/>
there were only 2 reeses left!.. He said. MOMMA, you only bought 6!.. you <br/>
bought one almond joy, 3 kit kats, and 2 reeses, thats 6, not 7.   I said.. <br/>
hmm, no, Im sure  I bought 7, they are 7 for $1, and thats why I got 7.  <br/>
Ethan said.. OH. I already ate one Reeses.. ( sheepish grin,lol)  OH, so <br/>
Ethan, you only get 1 more candy bar, the kit kat, JP said, and he gave him <br/>
his kit kat.   Then Anna says.. So, 7 for $1..thats more than $.10 each, <br/>
cause that would be  $ .70.  I said, yeah, thats right.. And then she says, <br/>
thats $.30 less than $1.00, .. and $.30 divided by 7 is a little bit more <br/>
than 4, becasue 7 X 4 is 28.. cause 4 weeks is 28 days ( she knows her sevens <br/>
becasue of calculating her period)  Yeah, thats right I said.. So, she says, <br/>
they are about $.14 each.. plus $.02.. Yeah, thats right.. about $.14 each.. <br/>
Then Ethan asks , &quot;how much are the big candy bars&quot;  I say.. uhhmmm, I think  <br/>
 $.55.  OH, he says, so its really cheaper to buy these little ones, because <br/>
there are 2 little ones in one big one.. Yeah, thats right.. 2 little ones <br/>
would be.. (pause  for a response).. $.28!  Anna say.. JP says.. $.28 is a <br/>
quarter and 3 pennies ( hes a quarter freak.. loves em. hey, what kid <br/>
doesnt?)  Yeah, thats right, Jon.  Its a quarter and a 3 pennies  Ethan <br/>
says.. a big one is two quarters and a nickel.  so its cost a quarter more to <br/>
buy the big one.than two little ones.   This was all just &quot;natural&quot; <br/>
conversation because they were caluclating how much the candy costs and how <br/>
much they would need to buy some.  I am sure the next time JP has a quarter <br/>
and 3 pennies.. he will want to go get two kit kat bars or two reeses or a <br/>
kit kat and a reeses.. LOL.. Heck, he will probably also figure out that if <br/>
he as a dime and a nickel he can go get one little candy bar.  Its funnny how <br/>
even  $.14 candy bar can teach so much<br/>
