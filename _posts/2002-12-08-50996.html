children.  We &quot;want&quot; someone to take over and make decisions for us.<br/>
<br/>
Those of us who have chosen to &quot;step out of line&quot; by <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling, those of us who chose to raise our children in a <br/>
different manner, those of us who have taken responsibility for our own lives <br/>
and our own children are considered nuts.  <br/>

Keith spent a long Holly-day yesterday.  Her fiddle teacher had organized <br/>
Christmas performances at four nursing homes.  Holly went to three of those <br/>
four, and during the second one she went to her acting classes.  Keith did <br/>
all that driving and was with her all day, took her lunch, etc.  (The kind of <br/>
thing I ordinarily do.)<br/>
<br/>
This morning he said she was the best behaved of any of them, and that she <br/>
seemed to be having a lot of fun and wasn&#39;t stressing.   She&#39;s one of the <br/>
older and tallest of them, and one of the beginners, too, but that didn&#39;t <br/>
seem to faze her a bit either.<br/>

Sometimes it&#39;s great to get the dad-perspective, especially in settings<br/>
the dad doesn&#39;t always see.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband wasn&#39;t working, he came to the park day and played a<br/>
baseball-like game with the kids.  (He was pitching and they were<br/>
batting and running the bases and there was no opposing team.)<br/>
<br/>
He was very favorably impressed with how patient and cooperative the<br/>
kids were.  They were great about waiting, even if the person in front<br/>
of them needed a lot of swings to hit the ball.<br/>
<br/>
Working with public school kids had led him to expect whining and<br/>
pushing to get ahead and other attention-seeking behaviors.  I think our<br/>
(homeschooled) kids haven&#39;t been deprived of fun and adult attention<br/>
(generalizing) as much as school kids have.  Those kids are starved of<br/>
some of the things they need.  It&#39;s not really surprising that our kids<br/>
can wait a little longer to get &quot;fed&quot;.<br/>

&gt;What ever happened to some common sense?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what happened was school. In the 20+ years we&#39;ve been <br/>
publishing Home Education Magazine we&#39;ve seen a subtle but important <br/>
shift from thinking of education as just something that goes along <br/>
with whatever else one does in life, to thinking of education as a <br/>
kind of one-way ticket to life itself. Let me rephrase that... I got <br/>
distracted and I&#39;m not sure the meaning will be clear.<br/>
<br/>
When I went to public school, in the &#39;50&#39;s and &#39;60&#39;s (yeah, I&#39;m an <br/>
old geezer, gramma five times now), there was a delicious sense that <br/>
what we were learning was more or less preparation for whatever we <br/>
decided to do with our lives after schooling ended. There was no <br/>
sense that if you failed a class you might be failing something <br/>
larger - you simply retook the class until you figured it out. A <br/>
niece of mine, a senior in high school this year, is practically <br/>
giving herself ulcers because she&#39;s struggling with an advanced math <br/>
class this year (trigonometry or something), and she&#39;s been told that <br/>
if she doesn&#39;t pass that class she can&#39;t take a certain college <br/>
course she needs to pursue her chosen career path. This one class is <br/>
jeopardizing the kid&#39;s entire future, so her math-whiz dad is <br/>
basically holding her hand all the way through the damn course. How <br/>
many kids like her face similar situations but don&#39;t have the backup <br/>
dad handy?<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere between the time I dropped out of school (actually, it was <br/>
more like kissed the nonsense goodbye) and what kids are faced with <br/>
these days there was a big slow change in what schools are about. <br/>
There&#39;s a strong sense that unless you get on the right educational <br/>
track early you&#39;re going to miss out, and I think a lot of it has <br/>
been driven by higher education - where the big bucks really hang <br/>
out. Public schooling might be free, but once you graduate it&#39;s a <br/>
whole different ballgame. There&#39;s money to be had, which is why <br/>
colleges and universities hire headhunters, cherrypickers, fellows <br/>
who scour the graduating classes for the best and the brightest, <br/>
whose brains will bring scholarship monies (and prestige, which <br/>
begets more money) to the school of higher education. It&#39;s Big <br/>
Business at its crassest, and it&#39;s all built on a tenuous belief that <br/>
without the degrees and certificates you won&#39;t be able to land a <br/>
well-paying job in a good company.<br/>
<br/>
Remember Michael J. Fox&#39;s old movie &quot;The Secret of My Success?&quot; The <br/>
kid makes it to the top not because of his hard-earned papers and <br/>
certificates, but because he&#39;s sharper at people skills, takes <br/>
advantage of some ticklish opportunities, isn&#39;t afraid to buck the <br/>
system and do things his own way, and of course his aunt owns the <br/>
outfit - all that stuff they *didn&#39;t* teach in college. But there&#39;s a <br/>
lot of truth in that silly little movie, too. Real life often works <br/>
that way - it&#39;s not what certificate you hold, but who you&#39;ve <br/>
impressed, what you&#39;ve accomplished, what kind of person you are that <br/>
paves the way. My kids have learned the truth of that many times over <br/>
- the older four who&#39;ve been out in the working world for many years <br/>
now have all referred to that movie and said &quot;Yep, just the attitude <br/>
you approach things with makes a big difference in what you&#39;ll be <br/>
able to do...&quot; And they&#39;ve learned that there isn&#39;t much - from <br/>
constructing commercial buildings (two sons have been foremen on <br/>
major commercial jobs) to long-haul trucking (one son&#39;s latest <br/>
interest - he been in 9 states in the last week) that can&#39;t be <br/>
learned on the job, just as I learned how to publish a magazine by <br/>
just deciding to do it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think I got lost again, and haven&#39;t really said what I wanted to <br/>
here about how educational interests are driving and shaping society <br/>
- entire books have been written on that topic - but I&#39;m leaving for <br/>
Alaska in the morning so I&#39;d better set this list to digest mode and <br/>
get back to packing my bags. I&#39;ll be downloading the digests and <br/>
catching up on reading this list as I can, and once I&#39;m settled in up <br/>
north I&#39;ll be back in the conversation again. This is still one of my <br/>
favorite lists to hang out on! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
That reminds me.<br/>
<br/>
Affirmative action at University of California law schools has been in<br/>
the news recently.  (I think because the Supreme Court is going to<br/>
review a case testing the constitutionality of using race as a factor in admissions.)<br/>
<br/>
I heard a long, thoughtful discussion of the topic a couple of years ago<br/>
on NPR.  One point really stuck with me after that discussion.<br/>
<br/>
They were talking about whether test scores and grades in law school<br/>
were any good at predicting who would be a good lawyer or who would be a<br/>
successful lawyer.  They looked at who made partner out of the<br/>
population of law students that had gone to work at large firms.  They<br/>
said the number one factor for predicting who would (and did) make<br/>
partner in the firm was not test scores or grades, but &quot;pizzazz&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My personal definition of &quot;pizzazz&quot; would be personality, energy and<br/>
smarts, with the smarts not being test-taking smarts, but rather<br/>
interpersonal and intrapersonal smarts, along with enough traditional<br/>
intelligence to keep up.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes our culture makes test scores too important, because numbers<br/>
seem scientific, objective and fair.  We ignore the things that can&#39;t be<br/>
easily measured and enumerated.<br/>

Enjoy those grandchildren Helen....I really hope I get to catch up with you <br/>
in AK one of these days.<br/>
Planning to be there in July, is there even a remote possibility? My sis is <br/>
in Wasilla, so I wouldn&#39;t be far up the road....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, c&#39;est la vie. &lt;g&gt; Mark and I decided a l-o-n-g time ago that <br/>
we&#39;re not in this to get rich, but to support homeschooling families, <br/>
and we don&#39;t want anyone to miss out on the best doggone <br/>
homeschooling - really unschooling - magazine out there just cuz they <br/>
might not think they can afford it. We remember what that&#39;s like.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of folks have had pretty good luck requesting that their local <br/>
libraries subscribe - HEM gets extremely high marks from library <br/>
resource editors, and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever had a library cancel a <br/>
subscription unless they were faced with a budget cut. In fact lots <br/>
of library systems enter subs for every one of their branches, and <br/>
many big-city libraries have multiple copies going to the same branch.<br/>
<br/>
And we work hard to make good offers to local support groups, too. <br/>
I&#39;ve lost track of how many support groups give away free copies at <br/>
their meetings...<br/>

And yeah, I&#39;m planning to still be there next July - that&#39;s the <br/>
height of salmon fishing season and we&#39;ve got a whole family of <br/>
fisherpeople! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; Somewhere between the time I dropped out of school (actually, it was<br/>
&gt; more like kissed the nonsense goodbye)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yet another way we&#39;re alike, Helen.  I left in the middle of grade 11.  We<br/>
went to school around the same time, but I only have 3 grandkids so far.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
and what kids are faced with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; these days there was a big slow change in what schools are about.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a strong sense that unless you get on the right educational<br/>
&gt; track early you&#39;re going to miss out, and I think a lot of it has<br/>
&gt; been driven by higher education - where the big bucks really hang<br/>
&gt; out. Public schooling might be free, but once you graduate it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; whole different ballgame. There&#39;s money to be had, which is why<br/>
&gt; colleges and universities hire headhunters, cherrypickers, fellows<br/>
&gt; who scour the graduating classes for the best and the brightest,<br/>
&gt; whose brains will bring scholarship monies (and prestige, which<br/>
&gt; begets more money) to the school of higher education. It&#39;s Big<br/>
&gt; Business at its crassest, and it&#39;s all built on a tenuous belief that<br/>
&gt; without the degrees and certificates you won&#39;t be able to land a<br/>
&gt; well-paying job in a good company.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the kids get brainwashed all through school to believe they&#39;ll be<br/>
nothing without finishing high school and getting a college degree.  They<br/>
buy it, and they&#39;ve even brainwashed my son with it, to some degree.  I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure that&#39;s where he picked up the idea that he&#39;s stupid.  His<br/>
friends all go to school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I think I got lost again, and haven&#39;t really said what I wanted to<br/>
&gt; here about how educational interests are driving and shaping society<br/>
&gt; - entire books have been written on that topic - but I&#39;m leaving for<br/>
&gt; Alaska in the morning so I&#39;d better set this list to digest mode and<br/>
&gt; get back to packing my bags. I&#39;ll be downloading the digests and<br/>
&gt; catching up on reading this list as I can, and once I&#39;m settled in up<br/>
&gt; north I&#39;ll be back in the conversation again. This is still one of my<br/>
&gt; favorite lists to hang out on! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sure hope you&#39;re going to pass through the Island one of these days on one<br/>
of your trips back and forth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518397476">abundance -- what a great way to put it. (and thanks for the reminder -- <br/>
I need to renew my subscription!! :-D<br/>
<br/>
my dd says one of the best parts of homeschooling is the ability to have <br/>
conversations with me.  That&#39;s abundance too - of time, and opportunity.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  I think our<br/>

&gt; some of the things they need.  It&#39;s not really surprising that our kids<br/>
&gt; can wait a little longer to get &quot;fed&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that&#39;s it.  They&#39;re not needy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My column in the upcoming issue of Home Education Magazine [everyone go <br/>
