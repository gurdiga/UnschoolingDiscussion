<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169386079">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I havent been around much lately. Things are just soooo busy. Anyhow, <br/>
I have been homeschooling since Dec. and only unschooling since Feb.<br/>
I was just wondering how long do I just sit back and let her <br/>
(Kearstin-81/2Yog) &quot;Deschool&quot;? She just wants to watch T.V., shes up <br/>
till all hours of the night. And I noticed a great increase in <br/>
appetite and gaining weight!! (getting nervous) We go to the library <br/>
once a week and she gets alot of videos on animals and stuff like that<br/>
mostly national geographic. And I thought she wasnt learning anything<br/>
but Im getting nervous about all the hanging around so I started a <br/>
game of 20 questions in the car and she picked animals as her cat. <br/>
she did really good on exotic animals but couldnt figure out what cat <br/>
was? (maybe too obvious?) We have not covered any other subjects and <br/>
when I bring anything up she gets aggravated with me. We havent even <br/>
thought about testing yet, and even though my state (NH) is pretty <br/>
easy to please, it is getting late in the season and now Im afraid to <br/>
test her. Has anyone heard of the PASS Test and do you know anything <br/>
about it? I have noticed a big difference in her attitude which to me <br/>
aught to be good enough I thought that was a great feat. She lapses <br/>
into that &quot;Cocky&quot; attitude every once in a while but just a look gets <br/>
rid of it. and we are a little more like partners now , I think we <br/>
need a little more practice but were getting there. Well Id like to <br/>
hear from anyone one who has a hard time to be patient. And the <br/>
waiting game is giving me a.....(I dont know, something though)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Everyone<br/>
