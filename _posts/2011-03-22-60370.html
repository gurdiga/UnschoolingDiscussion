<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577498483">Hello all,  I wanted to first say thank you to all the insightful advice that I received.  It helped me to see the issues within myself and help remember that my son was not trying to do harm.  As well as showing me lots of ideas to help him and me.<br/>
I have been quite offended, mostly by Sandra, and felt that even though I have tried to explain things and have learned a great deal about how to react in this situation should it happen again, I am being attacked.  It is not the first time.  I was looking for advice which many of you gave me and I appreciate that you are all looking out for my son and not my feelings.  But there should be some level of support between parents especially when they are admitting doing wrong and looking for advice.  I was nitpicked on wording and being called negative in a negative way, totally unacceptable, contradictory, and not the way I would speak to anyone.  <br/>
I know some will agree with me, see some of my points, and some will think I am flat out wrong.  That is OK because we all get choices and the right to our opinions.  But I do not think we have the right to be cruel to people which is what I feel is going on.  I am removing myself from this list and will not read any further correspondence.  Be well everyone and please try to be honest but slightly gentle to people seeking help.  It is how I would want my children to treat people.  Maybe some of you could remember that.<br/>

<br/>
There are some things I am unwilling to support.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently some people are unwilling to support this list, and that doesn&#39;t hurt my feelings.   &quot;This list&quot; is just a project.  It&#39;s a resource.  It helps people every day.  It can&#39;t help all the people all of the time, but it never set out to do that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a support list.  It&#39;s a discussion list.   Anyone who thought otherwise didn&#39;t read about the list before posting, as the main page clearly (VERY clearly) says to do.<br/>
<br/>
We support people coming to a clearer understanding of how to be good unschooling parents.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s the way my children DO treat people.<br/>
It&#39;s good advice for in-person interactions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not equally useful in the context of a discussion of a topic.<br/>
<br/>
No one has to post here.  No one has to defend an idea.  No one has to argue.  No one has to stay on the list.<br/>
The discussion will go on until it doesn&#39;t.  If everyone left the list, I would go work in the yard, or sew.<br/>
<br/>
No one needs to leave the list.  Reading only is fine. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339354339">Thank you Sandra. This list is not about sparing the feelings of people before contributing IMO. I really want to hear the truth un-sugar-coated.  <br/>

I am still a newbie here, (reading everything) and wanted to say that I find the discussions pertaining to the words we use, incredibly valuable. I have always personally been interested in the power of words to create meaning, to create the way we view ourselves, others and the world. And being prompted to do this on a daily basis, through reading people&#39;s posts is proving incredibly helpful for someone at the very beginning of their unschooling journey.<br/>
