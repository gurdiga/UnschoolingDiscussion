&gt;There hasn&#39;t yet been a president who wasn&#39;t Christian.  It&#39;s not required,<br/>
&gt;but it&#39;s not forbidden.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The church can&#39;t make binding policies (and which church would that be?  We<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t have one dominant Christian denomination, although I heard once most<br/>
&gt;Presidents have been Episcopalian or Presbyterian, but I don&#39;t know that <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;sure.  I think Carter and Clinton have been the only Baptists.  I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;LBJ was Baptist.  (I could be wrong).  Kennedy has been the only Catholic<br/>
&gt;president.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What was Ford?<br/>

Brethren (a denomination that was subsumed into United Methodists in the late <br/>
1960&#39;s, I think--they were called &quot;EUB&#39;s&quot; but theyr&#39;e not around anymore).<br/>

week, <br/>
 what aspects it&#39;s going to be making to Mars.  Which house is having the <br/>
