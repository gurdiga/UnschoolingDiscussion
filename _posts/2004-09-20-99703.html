<div id="ygrps-yiv-162388746">I have received a large number of requests for what y&#39;all can do to help  Ren <br/>
and others that got caught up in Ivan&#39;s path:<br/>
 <br/>
I spoke with Ren again this morning. She and her family are fine. Hardly  any <br/>
damage to their house and stuff---except for a massive amount of trash and  <br/>
debris in the yard. Phone works, but no power still---and maybe not for a <br/>
while.  They&#39;re making do and are happy to be safe and to have a house to come home <br/>
 to.<br/>
 <br/>
Her family is not in need, but they are busy helping others.<br/>
 <br/>
Downed trees are the biggest problem. There are no chainsaws available for  <br/>
sale (as would be expected! They&#39;re sold before they even get to the stores!).  <br/>
If anyone has a chainsaw you&#39;re willing to send down via UPS, Ren says that  <br/>
would be wonderful. She&#39;ll UPS it back as soon as things are cleaned up.<br/>
 <br/>
Although she was lucky, there are many others not-so-lucky. Another  <br/>
unschooling family is having a VERY rough go. Bankruptcy earlier this year. He  lost <br/>
his job. Their house was ruined---still has a huge tree splitting it in  half. <br/>
They couldn&#39;t afford to leave, so they had to stay in the house. The tree  <br/>
fell WHILE THEY WERE HOME during Ivan! They&#39;re physically fine, but everything&#39;s  <br/>
lost.<br/>
 <br/>
Ren&#39;s asking for monetary help for this family. If you are able to share  <br/>
with them, please send a check to Ren---she&#39;ll get it to this family. <br/>
 <br/>
Another family of homeschoolers was hit---but not as bad as the first  <br/>
family. Ren will do what she can for both.<br/>
 <br/>
She says thanks for all the good wishes and for whatever help you can  afford <br/>
to send. She&#39;s overwhelmed with your concern and generosity!<br/>
