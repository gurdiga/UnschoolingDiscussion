&lt;&lt; This happened to me recently, for the first time, my computer is almost 2<br/>
 years old.  When I asked my &quot;geek&quot; friends they said it&#39;s a &quot;Windows<br/>
 glitch&quot; and it&#39;s been cropping up for a lot of folks in the last few<br/>
 weeks.  I had to make all sorts of adjustments and ever since the window<br/>
 sizes have been too big.  I probably should format the hard drive and<br/>
 reinstall everything but it&#39;s a big job.<br/>

    YES! Our windows are either too small or too big. We have 5.0 b/c we were <br/>
afraid to move on to 6.0 after all we heard. So maybe it isn&#39;t the computers <br/>
fault?<br/>

&lt;&lt; On the plus side, having been married for 18 years, I can appreciate the<br/>
 unswerving devotion, AND the reluctance to change.  &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   Good point. It is a wonder my dh hasn&#39;t turned me in yet. Boy have I <br/>
changed since we started up.<br/>

The opinions seems to be the same with all of those I&#39;ve asked.  I&#39;ve<br/>
looked to see if Microsoft has offered a fix for the problem on their web<br/>
site but have found nothing so far.<br/>
