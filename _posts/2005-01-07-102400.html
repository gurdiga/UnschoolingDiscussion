<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145183015">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the great ideas. We have not watched the movie The Hulk, have seen a bit of the cartoons, so I think we will look into that. Riley handles very powerful movies well, it seems. He loves the Lord of the Rings series. I like the idea of looking at this theme within the Harry Potter series and we have not read book 5 to him. Started it, stopped, lost it under the bed for a few months. Next after Eragon. <br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you, I have a fresh approach to an idea Riley keeps bringing up. He told me the other day he wanted to open his brain and pinch out the mean part. <br/>
<br/>
