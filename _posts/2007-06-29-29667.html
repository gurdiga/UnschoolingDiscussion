<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892302018">From the Wikipedia bio of Elton John:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  His interest in early rock &#39;n&#39; roll piano annoyed his father who  <br/>
wanted him to concentrate on the classics and his fascination for  <br/>
music of Little Richard frightened his mother.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s extensive knowledge of rap and hip hop music used to scare  <br/>
me.  But then when we&#39;d play Encore, I&#39;d want him on my team so FULL  <br/>
of words...  And years have passed, and he hasn&#39;t stolen a car or  <br/>
been arrested.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Elton John never did turn black or poofty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH NO!!!!!  WAIT!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Darn...  I wonder if his mom blames Little Richard for her son  <br/>
Reginald being a little...  y&#39;know... flamboyant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else want to confess fears?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We-ell, since you asked... I suppose my fears concern Liam&#39;s tender <br/>
heart and his very different way of seeing the world, and given those <br/>
things, I get concerned about how will survive and thrive when I&#39;m <br/>
not close by.  I have fears of people more worldly than Liam making <br/>
fun of him or taking advantage of him.  And, don&#39;t get me started on <br/>
the girl thing!  We&#39;ve certainly talked about the raging hormones <br/>
he&#39;ll be dealing with and what the consequences can be of responding <br/>
purely to hormonal urges to the exclusion of his common sense.  And, <br/>
he&#39;s a fairly attractive guy who&#39;s already experienced girls being <br/>
interested in him, but he&#39;s completely not interested ... yet.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I realize (intellectually) that *because* of his tender <br/>
heart and his very different way of seeing the world he *will* <br/>
survive and thrive!  He believes so very much in himself!!  And, he <br/>
has never been one to go along with a crowd, preferring to think for <br/>
himself.  So, I treat my fears like the unfounded little annoyances <br/>
they are; I keep them to myself (except if anyone should specifically <br/>
ask), ;-) and I don&#39;t let them frighten me into interfering with who <br/>
Liam is.  (The few times I have attempted this interference, he&#39;s <br/>
caught me at it and called me on the carpet, and, like some corny <br/>
movie script, the issue turned out just as *he* thought it would, and <br/>
he would legitimately say, &quot;I told you so, Mom.&quot;  I would nod, and he <br/>
would smile tolerantly.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trusting the raging hormonal thing will go fairly that way, <br/>
too.  Liam has a very strong sense of self-preservation and has never <br/>
been one to take foolish chances.  And, he is *no* fool!  In fact, we <br/>
have a few real-life examples of folks in our extended family dealing <br/>
with those consequences, and he is loath to become a dad by the time <br/>
he&#39;s 17 or a three-time dad by 21.<br/>
<br/>
But, you asked, and those are the fears I&#39;m confessing to.  Sometimes <br/>
my knuckles go a little white on the steering wheel, as it were, but <br/>
I think that trust is the natural antidote for fear.  Ain&#39;t that right?<br/>

right?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I hope so. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have three who can drive cars, so I am not with them NEARLY as much  <br/>
as I once was.  And yet Marty invited me to go to a karaoke get- <br/>
together at Bennigan&#39;s the other night.  We took separate cars so I  <br/>
could go home early.  I was there when they threw us all out at 1:45  <br/>
so they could close the bar by 2:00 (state law).<br/>
<br/>
It helps a LOT that I know their friends and their friends know me.   <br/>
It probably won&#39;t hurt a bit that I sang karaoke.  (And because I  <br/>
know Marji&#39;s reading, here&#39;s what I sang:<br/>
Red Rubber Ball<br/>
Lover&#39;s Concerto (The Toys &quot;How gentle is the rain...&quot; thing to a  <br/>
Clementi tune)<br/>
Karma Chameleon (and told them I was about as much a man as Boy  <br/>
George, and they could all be my poofty English backup singers, and  <br/>
so I&#39;ve used that word twice in 24 hours) and they all sang and some  <br/>
danced.<br/>
<br/>
And I sang loud harmonies on Paradise by the Dashboard light, and  <br/>
grabbed Marty and the second mic to do harmonies when his friend Beth  <br/>
started doing &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My experience (with them and their friends) and visibility help with  <br/>
the fear-management.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I guess it&#39;s because where I come from in Australia, the word &quot;poofter&quot; (to <br/>
rhyme with &quot;woof&quot; not &quot;pooh&quot;) is a generally a derogatory slur for gay when <br/>
coming from a straight person, and the more correct descriptive expression <br/>
for an effeminate gay would be &quot;poofy&quot; (again to rhyme with &quot;woof&quot;) without <br/>
the &quot;T&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Where does the word &quot;poofty&quot; come from?<br/>

Sorry.  Didn&#39;t mean to make you uncomfortable. <br/>

<br/>
The differences in the English language between Australia and US have always <br/>
fascinated me, and I have had some humorous moments of misunderstandings <br/>
because of them. It&#39;s a bit similar to the local eating customs, or <br/>
accidental rude hand signs stuff - except I think that people assume that <br/>
because it&#39;s all English, that there aren&#39;t differences to take note of.<br/>

PS Don&#39;t say anyone is &quot;sitting on their fanny&quot; in Australia. Different <br/>

One of the hardest areas for me to find my trust is in Wyl&#39;s (8) future  <br/>
social abilities. On one hand, I admire his ability to do as he likes and truly  <br/>
not care-not even notice-other people&#39;s reactions. On the other hand, I worry  <br/>
that he never will be able to pick up on those social cues. There *are*  <br/>
extremely rare occasions when he ends up being in a group of other 8 year olds  who <br/>
are schooled, and when in that setting, he seems more mature for his age or  <br/>
equal to the other kids, but then I worry its just because the situation is so <br/>
 rare that he&#39;s observing and holding back because he&#39;s unsure. Hmmm... maybe <br/>
 that&#39;s a good clue that he&#39;s at least *looking* for social cues... ?<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
