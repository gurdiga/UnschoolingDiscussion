 </span></blockquote>Okay it is something like this...we have elementry school from 5<br/>
(kidergarten) to 5th or 6th grade (about 11 or so) depending on the <br/>
state you live.  Then middle school for another 2-3 years.  High <br/>
school is another 4 years from about 14-18 years old.  You earn <br/>
credits for each class and must take certain required courses plus a <br/>
number of elective classes to graduate with a high school diploma.  <br/>
Each class earns you a certain number of credits and you need so many <br/>
credits to graduate.  A high school diploma is not a specific program <br/>
of study, it is just a continuation on general information and is <br/>
supposed to be the preparation for college (university) which is <br/>
another 2-4 years or more if you want to study further.  Some kids <br/>
opt for a GED once they turn 16, school of some form is mandatroy <br/>
until then.  A GED is a test that gives you an equivilency diploma <br/>
and allows you to apply to university.  Whew.  Now, I have been out <br/>
of school for about 10 years so there are probably people currently <br/>
working in the frameworks of the system who might have any current <br/>
changes to the system.  I hope this helps and does not leave you more <br/>
confused then when you started. Oh..by the way...there are usually no <br/>
exit exams required to get your high school diploma, although some <br/>
states may be changing this now.<br/>

You can tell the woman you&#39;re not enrolled in a high school so there&#39;s <br/>
nowhere for that credit to go! &lt;g&gt;  She means if you WERE counting credits <br/>
for a high school graduation, you could count that project as one credit.<br/>
<br/>
Most states require 19 to 23 or so &quot;credits.&quot;  They only start counting in <br/>
9th grade (a.k.a. high school freshman year; kids are 15ish) and to graduate <br/>
in one state or another (they vary you might need something like this (for a <br/>
mostly made-up example):<br/>
<br/>
English 4 credits (means you took/passed it every year)<br/>
Science 2 credits<br/>
Math 2 credits (maybe three)<br/>
Geography 1<br/>
History 3<br/>
Physical Education 2<br/>
Health 1 (might be part of phys ed in some places)<br/>
and six or eight &quot;elective&quot; credits<br/>
which will be stuff maybe like driver&#39;s ed, theatre, music, art, home <br/>
economics/family life/called various things (required in some places, maybe <br/>
as the other half of &quot;health&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
So when you&#39;re a senior, and 17 or 18 years old, if you have enough of those <br/>
things, you &quot;graduate from high school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
College credits are called &quot;college  hours&quot; and a three hour class means, <br/>
generally, it met for three hours a week for a semester.  You get &quot;three <br/>
credit hours.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s totally irritating terminology.<br/>

I don&#39;t really understand. We take exams at 16. Then study 3 subjects from 16-18 and take 3 exams. Then we go to university and don&#39;t graduate till then.<br/>
<br/>
The credit thing is confusing me. DD is thinking of acting in a theatre company. The woman doing the auditions said she would get &#39;high school credit&#39; for this. Huh? She&#39;s not taking any exams or<br/>
anything, just being in a play. Plus, we&#39;re moving back to the UK. If DD chooses university, she&#39;ll have to pass 3 A levels same as anyone else.<br/>

are often exams in order to pass individual classes, but the only <br/>
thing that you have to do in order to graduate is to have enough <br/>

<br/>

for example, academic algebra I, you got 4 credits multiplied by your <br/>

A in algebra I would be worth 16 points. (4 X 4).  A C in albegra I <br/>
would be worth 8 points. (4 X 2).  <br/>
<br/>
However, if you took basic algebra instead of academic algebra I, you <br/>
get 2.5 times your grade.  So an A in basic algebra would be worth 10 <br/>
points. (4 X 2.5)  Much less points than if you got an A in academic <br/>
algebra I, so anyone who had any ambition struggled through the <br/>

<br/>
Same thing with Englishes, sciences, social studies...basic English <br/>
would be 2.5 X your grade, but American literature or composition II <br/>
would be worth 4 times your grade.  <br/>
<br/>
home ec and shop classes were worth 2.5 times grade, foreign <br/>
languages were worth 4 times grade.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Top&quot; kids competing for grade point averages would never, ever take <br/>
study halls, because they wouldn&#39;t get any points for them.  Kids who <br/>
could care less about grade point average took as many as they were <br/>
allowed.  Therefore it was always the &quot;bad&quot; kids in study halls.  <br/>
<br/>
My senior year I got away without taking physics and it didn&#39;t hurt <br/>
my grade point average because I discovered that human physiology was <br/>
much easier and was still worth 4 points.  <br/>

test to graduate.  Yes, ninth grade.  You take it in ninth grade, and <br/>
if you don&#39;t pass, you have to keep retaking it until you do.  I&#39;ve <br/>
known people who kept taking it again and again and again and barely <br/>

<br/>
Not in any school I&#39;m familiar with.  Not in high school.  Any year-long <br/>
course is 1 credit.  The only 1/2 credit would be a one semester (half year) <br/>
class.  <br/>
<br/>
You get as much credit for an A as for a D.  But GradePoint Average I forgot <br/>
to address (below).<br/>
<br/>
In college if you&#39;re to get four &quot;hours&quot; instead of three, the class is <br/>
either harder,  has a lab, or has a big final project.<br/>
<br/>
Grade point average is pretty much just a point average.  Traditional and <br/>
most common is 4 point system.  Some schools use a 5 so you can have more <br/>
than a 4.0 (four-point-oh, it&#39;s called) but that&#39;s fairly recent.<br/>
<br/>
A 4<br/>
B 3<br/>
C 2<br/>
D 1<br/>
F 0<br/>
<br/>
and you average that, so anything above a 3.0 (three point oh) is good, a 4.0 <br/>
is &quot;straight A&#39;s&quot; and below 2.0 nobody speaks aloud.<br/>

You get the credit(s) if you pass the *class*. (Though exams are given in <br/>
classes, and failing some of those could result in failing the class.)<br/>

No, if you pass the class, you get the credit. (There&#39;s an exception here I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I beleive I have posted about this before, but It&#39;s a very hot topic here. I <br/>
am part of an anti mcas group at my &quot; old&quot; school called SAFE students <br/>
advocating fair education. and we have been getting alot of press since the <br/>
MCAS became a requirement for this years graduating class. ( which was 3 <br/>
years ago) each year several people from our school have boycotted. there are <br/>
four seniors I beleive who will not graduate this year.I know that 2 of them <br/>
are going to Dartmouth and Middlebury. last year, when I still was in school <br/>
I got my chance to boycott. it was amazing, and while my actions did not end <br/>
up holding consiquence for me like the others( I was under the impression <br/>
they would at the time )I still would have stood by it. I support my &quot; <br/>
classmates&quot; and am still helping them fight for the cause.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Shop&quot; didn&#39;t exist. Neither did health, home ec or any other common <br/>
electives you see on tv shows! &lt;g&gt; Most of the kids &quot;elected&quot; to transfer the <br/>
art/music in 8th as a credit. The math wizzes took algebra I in 8th and <br/>
transfered that one. Days were filled with English, History, Math, and <br/>
Science.  College Prep!<br/>

I didn&#39;t actually learn any French though until I spent months back-packing round France. Much better than sitting in a dull language lab with headphones.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In South Dakota there isn&#39;t any graduation tests, but in order to work in the <br/>
school district in California, I had to take *their* test in order for my <br/>
diploma to be valid.  I was amazed at how simple a test it was. I remember <br/>
most the 200 word essay on my favorite food; the math portion was basic <br/>
arithmetic with no algebra ... I could have passed it way before I graduated! <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, too, when I went to school we did K-6 elementary, then 7-9 <br/>
junior high, and 10-12 high school.  Not long after I graduated, our state <br/>
changed to the Middle School system: K-5 elementary; 6-8 middle school; 9-12 <br/>
highschool.  This system has NOT been as effective as they thought <br/>
(overcrowding was the major concern, not social development), they are now <br/>
considering reverting to the original system as 6th and 9th graders are <br/>
having horrible adjustment issues.  Glad my kids aren&#39;t there :-D <br/>

&gt; Do you only get the &#39;credits&#39; if you pass the exam. Does getting a high or <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not in any school I&#39;m familiar with.  Not in high school.  Any year-long <br/>
&gt; course is 1 credit.  The only 1/2 credit would be a one semester (half <br/>
&gt; year) <br/>
&gt; class.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, you get credits just for doing the time, and getting a passing grade.  <br/>
(Sometimes you don&#39;t even have to get a passing grade.)<br/>
<br/>
When my eldest son wanted to go back to school after one year of <br/>
homeschooling, I went in armed with his previous standardized test scores, <br/>
and a transcript that they found lacking.  She wasn&#39;t going to give him <br/>
credit and put him in 10th grade based on test scores alone (all his scores <br/>
were 99th percentile.  woo-hoo!)  and they didn&#39;t like his transcript.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I asked the question, and I wanted her to be real clear about it:  <br/>
&quot;So what you&#39;re saying is, it&#39;s not what he KNOWS that counts, but how much <br/>
time he has served?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And she said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I made steady eye contact while I allowed that to sink into her <br/>
counselor-brain.  <br/>
<br/>
I told Jake all about that and it really ruined him for school.  It changed <br/>
his whole outlook; disillusioned him.  He did finish and earned lots of <br/>
scholarships, but he did it by working the system.  His cynicism was kind of <br/>
sad, really, but it all turned out okay in the end.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is no exam to pass in order to graduate from highschool.  There <br/>
&gt; are often exams in order to pass individual classes, but the only <br/>
&gt; thing that you have to do in order to graduate is to have enough <br/>
&gt; credits.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s how it worked in my school.  If you took an academic class, <br/>
&gt; for example, academic algebra I, you got 4 credits multiplied by your <br/>
&gt; grade.  A&#39;s were worth 4, B&#39;s were 3, c&#39;s were 2, d&#39;s were 1.  So an <br/>
&gt; A in algebra I would be worth 16 points. (4 X 4).  A C in albegra I <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>But in VA, where you are Shyrley, it&#39;s even different than the above example.<br/>
<br/>
There is no multiplier here.  If you get an A in English it&#39;s 4 points, an A <br/>
in Chemistry 4 points.  A D in Geometry, 1 point.<br/>
<br/>
There are such things as AP classes in 11th and 12th grades that can earn you <br/>
extra points on your GPA, like an A in an AP English class might be worth 5 <br/>
points because you did &quot;harder&quot; work.<br/>
<br/>
They are all added up and averaged.  So if you took 27 classes, you add up <br/>
the grades = numbers, divide by the number.  If you FAIL a class, it counts <br/>
as a zero, even if you repeat it and get an A, the zero still counts in your <br/>
GPA.<br/>
<br/>
So in reality you should have a GPA of somewhere between 5 and a possible <br/>
zero.<br/>
<br/>
You do have to take a VA Passport Literacy Test to prove you are ready for <br/>
High School, if you don&#39;t pass it after two or three or four times, then you <br/>
are asked to do remedial work.<br/>
<br/>
Of course in VA you have also heard about the dreaded SOL exams.  Tests that <br/>
you MUST pass in certain subjects in order to be given a diploma of <br/>
graduation.  Starting this year, if you don&#39;t pass these exams you do not get <br/>
a diploma of graduation.<br/>
<br/>
So State by State you are apt to get very different answers.<br/>
