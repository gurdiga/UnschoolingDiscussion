<div id="ygrps-yiv-227111702">My 7 year old dd seems to have self-esteem issues. I am not sure what I am<br/>
doing wrong or how to help her to feel better about herself. My first<br/>
instinct is to praise her a lot. I know that is the wrong response because I<br/>
don&#39;t want her to turn out like me-a people pleaser and a praise junkie (I&#39;m<br/>
getting better with that). We have been unschooling for about 2 years now<br/>
and I thought we were doing pretty well, much better than before, but<br/>
obviously I am missing something crucial here. <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any ideas anyone might have. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Dawn<br/>

Can you try to find more things that surprise her happily?<br/>
When she thinks something is fun all of a sudden, that feeling is  <br/>
closer to joy than if you build up to something slowly and she has  <br/>
time to picture it and then be somehow disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of families do that.  They plan a week ahead to play  <br/>
miniature golf, or save money methodically for a Barbie, but if you  <br/>
just pop it on them suddenly you get the &quot;tadaa!!&quot; factor.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe stop at a park you just happen to be passing, and run and play  <br/>
a while.<br/>
<br/>
Things that make her smile, and get her tired, and give her a sense  <br/>
of satisfaction are real.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas in her head that you try to combat with ideas from your head,  <br/>
that&#39;s all just construct and your imagination won&#39;t match hers.   <br/>
That can be like doing nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Mix it up.  Do new things.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t summarize and review the past in ways that compare it to now.   <br/>
Don&#39;t SAY to her &quot;we&#39;re doing better now than we used to.&quot;  Just do  <br/>
better in the next moment than you did in the last one.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an idea, anyway.<br/>

Sorry.   You&#39;re right.  It looks stupid.  I&#39;m trying to find a better  <br/>
way to say it.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s stuck, she&#39;s stuck in ways you can&#39;t see.  Talking to her  <br/>
about it just puts more words in her head.  It&#39;s already full of  <br/>
words.  Some of her words and ideas (guessing, from what you wrote)  <br/>
are about her not feeling confident and full and whole.<br/>
<br/>
If you talk to her (praise, or reason, or anything) you&#39;re<br/>
a) putting words in her head<br/>
b) telling her she&#39;s wrong and could be better<br/>
c) just being there, talking.<br/>

scram&quot; Like I said, she&#39;s had 2 meltdowns in the last month or so and these<br/>
are just an example of some of the things she said during those meltdowns.<br/>
Until she said these things I really had no idea she felt this way.<br/>
Obviously, she is not feeling this way because of one or two instances that<br/>
have happened. These are very heavy feelings that have been building up for<br/>
awhile. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-688095379">Hi everyone,<br/>
    My extended family is really getting me down about homeschooling my 7 year old daughter Courtney. My mom tnoight was on the phone with my aunt and I whispered to her to tell my aunt that I&#39;m going to be homeschooling. She waved her hand at me and said &quot;Not now. I dont want to get all into that tonight.&quot; So I felt a little bad about that. And everyone seems to treat me like this is some phase I&#39;m going thru. I&#39;ve gone thru phases before that made NO sense but I&#39;ve sent in my letter of intent. Hello? Why dont these people take me seriously and what on earth do I tell family members when they confront me?<br/>

would just<br/>
scram&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think going for a walk, asking her to help you let the dog out,  <br/>
going on a short errand (get gas in the car, buy a gallon of milk,  <br/>
something that gets you and her physically in a different place, with  <br/>
different air) would help better than talking.<br/>
<br/>
But if one of my kids said those things (I&#39;ve changed Dillon to  <br/>
Marty) I might say things like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t do anything right&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen you do lots of right stuff.<br/>
or<br/>
Do you think there&#39;s really anyone who can&#39;t do ANYthing right?<br/>
<br/>
(But I would also be moving to get her into a different physical  <br/>
location, if conveniently possible.)<br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Marty does stuff right but I can&#39;t&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s a lot like Keith.  There are lots of things Keith can do that  <br/>
I can&#39;t do.  But I can do some things he can&#39;t.  People are different.<br/>
or<br/>
Marty&#39;s not as good at drawing as you are.<br/>
<br/>
=====================================<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not good like everyone else&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people bloom earlier and some later.  Just like flowers.<br/>
The trees that grow the fastest aren&#39;t the strongest trees.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;d say something true and indirect that she could think about later.)<br/>
<br/>
=========================================<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not smart&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think macaroni and cheese would help?<br/>
or<br/>
I&#39;m not smart sometimes.  Sleeping helps me.<br/>
or<br/>
Who do you think is smart?  (and then use her answer as a springboard  <br/>
to other things)<br/>
<br/>
(There&#39;s a paper plate up in our kitchen with notes on Garder&#39;s  <br/>
Multiple Intelligences, from a conversation Holly and I had last week  <br/>
about the old theory of &quot;IQ&quot; and the new-improved ideas about  <br/>
multiple intelligences.  Maybe you could discuss that with her, and  <br/>
say the idea of &quot;smart&quot; isn&#39;t a very good one, and has caused a lot  <br/>
of harm over the years.  That way it&#39;s not about her, it&#39;s about  <br/>
people before she was ever born.)<br/>
<br/>
==========================================<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not strong&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are different ways to be strong.  Some people can open jars and  <br/>
lift heavy logs but wouldn&#39;t be able to have a baby.<br/>
<br/>
(or maybe ask a question)<br/>
Strong how, physically?  There are other ways to be strong.<br/>
<br/>
(or if it&#39;s about something specific, tell stories)<br/>
<br/>
===========================================<br/>
&quot;I bet you wish I would just scram&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would really miss you if you scrammed.<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could scram together.  You want to go for ice cream?<br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
<br/>
Frustration does it for Holly, so I try to get her up and away from  <br/>
the frustrating project for a little while.  Staying there has all  <br/>
the memories of the frustrated moment.<br/>
<br/>
There is the much-used tool of HALT:  Are you hungry?  Angry?   <br/>
Lonely?  Tired?   Those are all things moms can help a child recover  <br/>
from or dodge.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m big on distraction.  When I get frustrated I get up and walk into  <br/>
the yard or another part of the house, do a couple of little useful  <br/>
things, and come back feeling better.  The walking helps, the fresh  <br/>
air or different point of view helps, the moments to think help.<br/>

<br/>
To me &quot;don&#39;t worry about it&quot; means blow it off, ignore it, let it be  <br/>
as if it didn&#39;t happen.  Maybe you didn&#39;t mean that.<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;worry about it&quot; you meant that she might need therapy to avoid  <br/>
suicide, I think that would be too much worry.  But you could help  <br/>
her lie down and sleep, maybe.  Maybe offer to read her to sleep, or  <br/>
ask her to come and lie down with you.<br/>
<br/>
If she likes it, maybe brushing  her hair would be soothing and  <br/>
relaxing for her.  The other day Holly and I were away from home and  <br/>
she was a little powerless and antsy in the situation.  She put her  <br/>
head in my lap and I just scratched slowly through her hair, pulling  <br/>
it up toward the top of her head, just one hand and then the other,  <br/>
kind of massaging her head and playing with her hair and combing it  <br/>
with my fingers.  She got totally relaxed, and I did it the same slow  <br/>
way for a long time.  I was still talking with the adults.  She was  <br/>
spared the need to try to make eye contact, or to worry about looking  <br/>
bored, or leaving.  She was still there physically, but was in her  <br/>
own little space with me.  If we were home she could&#39;ve fallen asleep  <br/>
easily.<br/>

tonight.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
But why did you do that?  Let it go.  Tell your aunt yourself, later,  <br/>
maybe.<br/>
<br/>
If you know it&#39;s something that&#39;s going to make them uncomfortable,  <br/>
don&#39;t bring it up at casual times.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I felt a little bad about that. And everyone seems to treat me  <br/>
like this is some phase I&#39;m going thru. I&#39;ve gone thru phases before  <br/>
that made NO sense but I&#39;ve sent in my letter of intent. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sending in a letter of intent doesn&#39;t keep it from being a temporary  <br/>
situation.  Thousands of people have registered their kids for school  <br/>
this year, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll finish the school year.   <br/>
Thousands who pay big bucks for college tuition will drop out before  <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
You ARE going through a phase.  You&#39;re in a phase of heightened  <br/>
excitement about the newness of homeschooling, right?  It&#39;s cool when  <br/>
that happens!  You&#39;re excited, but you can&#39;t expect others to be  <br/>
excited.  In the case of your mom and your aunt, your declaration  <br/>
will stir up too much in them for them to be happy for you.  You&#39;re  <br/>
basically telling them they wasted time and energy, that they did  <br/>
something to you you now wish they hadn&#39;t, that you&#39;re a better mom  <br/>
than they were (maybe some or all of that, depending).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Hello? Why dont these people take me seriously and what on earth  <br/>
do I tell family members when they confront me?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you were telling your mom to tell your aunt you were going to be  <br/>
homeschooling, maybe they don&#39;t take you seriously because of things  <br/>
like that.  Maybe you&#39;re really young.  (Guessing; don&#39;t know.)<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t know what on earth you will tell family members, and if  <br/>
you&#39;re expecting to be  confronted, those are clues about why they  <br/>
might not take you seriously.<br/>
<br/>
An easy thing to tell people the first couple of years, and a true  <br/>
thing, is that you&#39;re going to try it and if it quits working out you  <br/>
can put her in school.   It&#39;s absolutely true, it will give them hope  <br/>
that you&#39;ll fail, and it will give you space to try it without  <br/>
pressure.  If you declare &quot;I&#39;m homeschooling no matter WHAT you say;  <br/>
she will never see the inside of a school,&quot; then you&#39;re not putting  <br/>
your daughter first, and  you&#39;re not being very realistic or calm.<br/>
<br/>
Take it a day at a time, and don&#39;t plan for confrontations that  <br/>
haven&#39;t happened.<br/>
<br/>
All the energy expressed up above might have been better spent with  <br/>
and on your daughter.  The more cool things you do with her, the more  <br/>
confident you will be and the more stories you&#39;ll have to tell  <br/>
relatives who ask you how your experiment is going.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661350376">My 8yo has said things like that. Pointing out her talents realistically has<br/>
helped, but, for my daughter, it was definitely a sign that I needed to give<br/>
her more focused attention.<br/>
<br/>
Some of her sadness was undoubtedly a reaction to the fact that my husband<br/>
and I and our 10yo son are all very interested in baseball and we spend a<br/>
lot of time talking about, reading about and watching baseball. She&#39;s not at<br/>
all interested in that. I think baseball was making her feel separated from<br/>
us and that her brother was somehow more &quot;loved&quot; because he shared his<br/>
parents&#39; interest in a way she doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
She liked it when we started spending a lot of time with her ice skating and<br/>
when we discovered and embraced other things she&#39;s interested in: Disney<br/>
Channel shows, &quot;How Do I Look?&quot; on the Style channel, different kind of<br/>
music. She has seemed a lot happier. I can spend a lot of time talking to my<br/>
son about baseball history, but I also make sure I&#39;m initiating<br/>
conversations with my daughter about Hannah Montana or clothes or music.<br/>
I&#39;ll dig up one of my CDs that has music that I think she might like or go<br/>
window-shopping and bargain-hunting with her. (Last week, we found a pair of<br/>
Converse All-Star high-tops for $4.95 -- they were lime green with large<br/>
polka dots and perfect for her.) I bought tickets for us for the Radio<br/>
Disney 10th Birthday Concert, which no one expected until we bought them,<br/>
which showed her we don&#39;t just spend money on baseball games.<br/>
<br/>
In at least my daughter&#39;s case, I didn&#39;t see those kinds of phrases as low<br/>
self-esteem as much as a call for more -- and a different kind of --<br/>
attention.<br/>

What Sandra said..Don&#39;t worry tons about it, but address the issue still.<br/>
Help her to understand that when she is tired and frustrated that she<br/>
doesn&#39;t respond to things in the same way that she does when she is well<br/>
rested and feeling good.  Help her to know it&#39;s a symptom of being over<br/>
tired and that she&#39;ll feel better after a good night&#39;s sleep.  I always<br/>
offer to go to bed early with her and she enjoys the cuddle time too, which<br/>

    I don&#39;t know about your dd, but mine gets that way when she is over <br/>
tired.<br/>
It isn&#39;t how she normally feels but when she&#39;s exhausted and frustrated <br/>
she<br/>
sometimes feels badly about herself like that. She realizes that it is a<br/>
symptom of being overtired and she makes plans to get some extra sleep <br/>
so<br/>
she won&#39;t feel so badly.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
---Both times this happened she was very tired-I would say exhausted. <br/>
So you<br/>
think I shouldn&#39;t worry about it? I think the whole thing just shocked <br/>
the<br/>
hell out of me. To hear my little girl say those things about herself <br/>
just<br/>
broke my heart.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s done this several times---HUGE meltdowns where he really seems <br/>
suicidal. To the point where I&#39;ve called my dad the psychiatrist to <br/>
find out what to do.<br/>
<br/>
One time, Daddy talked to him for three minutes and all&#39;s well. &lt;g&gt; At <br/>
least I knew then it wasn&#39;t a dangerous situation. Ugly and horrible <br/>
and serious, but not dangerous. I guess my dad knows what to say! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we keep &quot;Rescue Remedy&quot; handy. We&#39;ll both take a few drops. I try <br/>
to get him to take a few deep breaths with me. Sometimes, he&#39;s so wound <br/>
up, he won&#39;t. I think sometimes he&#39;s just *needing* to be able to <br/>
meltdown like this---he NEEDS to be able to cry and vent. I don&#39;t think <br/>
he *wants* to, but I think there&#39;s something hiding that he needs to <br/>
get OUT.<br/>
<br/>
He has a brother who is eight years older and into so many things. I&#39;m <br/>
sure that seems overwhelming when you&#39;re only eight or nine or ten. Mom <br/>
& Dad and big brother have *things* to do. We&#39;re all better at drawing <br/>
than he is (well, except Ben&lt;g&gt;)---and he wants to be a Manga artist. <br/>
So it&#39;s frustrating. I think some days he just has a BUNCH of <br/>
frustration build up over time, and he just needs to let it all out.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s usually HORRIBLE, but after the 30-40 minutes of hell, he bounces <br/>
back and is fine! While it&#39;s happening (and especially the first time), <br/>
I&#39;m ready to hospitalize him! We&#39;ve had 5-6 of them over 2-3 years. I <br/>
know what to do *now*! &lt;g&gt; Rescue Remedy, hugs, listening, validating, <br/>
brainstorming. Soft music and those slice & bake chocolate chip cookies <br/>
don&#39;t hurt! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, he&#39;s just as bright and fun as usual. No one would know how <br/>
terrifying the whole ordeal was---or that it even took place! And it&#39;s <br/>
often shortly followed by a growth spurt or increased ability in <br/>
whatever&#39;s been the issue (drawing or diving or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
BTDT. And I may have another 2-3 in my future! &lt;G&gt; I take them very <br/>
seriously when they&#39;re happening, but I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re just a <br/>
reaction to frustration and not a permanent condition.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-78189503">Oh my gosh Ren, you hit it right on the head. I actually live in a two family with my mom right below us. lol And I grew up in a household where my father constantly belittled my mom, my brothers and myself. She finally divorced him when I told her that my husband and I would buy a two family with her if she would just leave him already. She took us up on it so here we are. My brothers and I are constantly craving praise or attention from my father (even though not one of us can stand him) and he&#39;s always calling us. Since we dont get any kind of acknowledgement from him at all, we tend to seek it from other sources. I tend to need to be validated by other people that what I&#39;m doing is ok. I&#39;ve always been like that which is why starting to homeschool is very scary for me-not because I cant do IT, but I&#39;m afraid of what others will think: I&#39;m not qualified enough, good enough, stable enough emotionally to handle it, etc....<br/>

Really good, what Ren wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it as stepping lightly into the area, though, and not  <br/>
stomping in yelling &quot;I&#39;m HOMESCHOOLING!&quot;   You&#39;ll do better just  <br/>
living it matter of factly and not feeling the need to explain it.   <br/>
As time goes on you can explain it with real examples from your own  <br/>
child&#39;s learning, instead of theoretically or with stories from other  <br/>
people&#39;s kids.  That&#39;s when the balance shifts, when you KNOW it  <br/>
works because it&#39;s working.<br/>

Hi everyone,<br/>
    My extended family is really getting me down about homeschooling my 7<br/>
year old daughter Courtney. My mom tnoight was on the phone with my aunt and<br/>
I whispered to her to tell my aunt that I&#39;m going to be homeschooling. She<br/>
waved her hand at me and said &quot;Not now. I dont want to get all into that<br/>
tonight.&quot; So I felt a little bad about that. And everyone seems to treat me<br/>
like this is some phase I&#39;m going thru. I&#39;ve gone thru phases before that<br/>
made NO sense but I&#39;ve sent in my letter of intent. Hello? Why dont these<br/>
people take me seriously and what on earth do I tell family members when<br/>
they confront me?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215690560">-=-am also thinking that we need to look at our family dynamics<br/>
more closely. Do we treat her differently than her brother? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I hope so.  It&#39;s cool when each child feels she&#39;s being treated  <br/>
specially, and best.  If you try to &quot;treat them the same,&quot; you end up  <br/>
treating one like the other.  That&#39;s less &quot;fair&quot; and generous than if  <br/>
you treat each the way he or she would most like to be treated.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My husband and son and I do have some things in common (hockey and  <br/>
fishing)<br/>
that she doesn&#39;t particularly care for.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Long ago, before I had kids, a child psychologist or family counselor  <br/>
of some sort  was on Phil Donahue and he said a thing that I always  <br/>
remembered.  He said the worst combination for a family was when both  <br/>
parents were extroverts and they had an introverted child, or both  <br/>
introverts had an extrovert.  He said much family counseling was just  <br/>
that--the parents thought there was something wrong with the child  <br/>
because he wasn&#39;t like them.<br/>
<br/>
There have been lots of kids &quot;treated&quot; and labeled for being &quot;too  <br/>
shy,&quot; and we all know kids are drugged down if they&#39;re too outgoing,  <br/>
too talkative, too excited about the world around them.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a fundamental difference in the way she likes to interact  <br/>
with the world, maybe you could look for clubs or classes or  <br/>
something where she might meet people who are more like her, have her  <br/>
interests.   If she doesn&#39;t like hockey and fishing (they sound  <br/>
painful to me; I&#39;ve fished impatiently with my parents,and I&#39;ve  <br/>
watched Marty play hockey, wishing I were far away from cold and  <br/>
danger and noise), maybe she would like an American Girls club (those  <br/>
novels and dolls) or a quiet kind of dance class, or knitting or  <br/>
painting or piano.   Maybe you could find her some one-on-one  <br/>
teachers for some things she likes so she could try some things that  <br/>
aren&#39;t what the other family members are into.  Even if she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
keep any of them for a long time, even if it&#39;s just a few lessons,  <br/>
just one session, just one season, she will have other things in her  <br/>
head, other knowledge to hook new things onto.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe do some talking when she&#39;s not having a meltdown and in the<br/>
heat of the moment.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.  But if she recovers from the frustration and you bring it  <br/>
back up that might not be very fun.  Maybe you could offer to talk  <br/>
about it in such a way that she could really opt out or accept, and  <br/>
not feel obligated.  Maybe while you&#39;re in the car or working a  <br/>
puzzle, or doing something else in addition to talking.   http:// <br/>

Bummer she helped you stop breastfeeding.  Seriously, if you look at  <br/>

were younger (and aren&#39;t now) would be healing for you too, I think.   <br/>
You could see it&#39;s possible.<br/>
<br/>
Help her be the way you would like to be, and would like to have  <br/>
been.  That&#39;s part of what the &quot;healing the inner child&quot; work is.   <br/>
Comfort the insides of you by creating a safe, strong life for her.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is terrible, but I honestly care more about what my mom  <br/>
thinks about things than my own husband. Defenitly need to see  <br/>
someone huh?! lol -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone a thousand miles away.  If you can&#39;t figure out how to  <br/>
detach from your mom (politely but firmly, and your mom might not  <br/>
mind!) maybe you&#39;ll do better to move far away.  You moved your mom  <br/>
practically in with you and so you might feel obligated for a while.  <br/>
I hope you don&#39;t feel stuck or trapped.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of trying to change lots of things, just focus on your  <br/>
relationship with your daughter.  If you get more confident there,  <br/>
you can expand that slowly into other areas of your life.<br/>

She might FEEL obligated but it doesn&#39;t mean that she is.  <br/>

There are so many times when I would love to up and move far far away from<br/>
my mom... but running away usually doesn&#39;t help.  You can take this time to<br/>
start working on yourself... healing and growing and really having<br/>
confidence in the unique person that you are.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-477779329">I hope so. It&#39;s cool when each child feels she&#39;s being treated <br/>
specially, and best. If you try to &quot;treat them the same,&quot; you end up <br/>
treating one like the other. That&#39;s less &quot;fair&quot; and generous than if <br/>
you treat each the way he or she would most like to be treated.<br/>
<br/>
---See? There you go. That&#39;s something I never thought of. <br/>
<br/>
Long ago, before I had kids, a child psychologist or family counselor <br/>
of some sort was on Phil Donahue and he said a thing that I always <br/>
remembered. He said the worst combination for a family was when both <br/>
parents were extroverts and they had an introverted child, or both <br/>
introverts had an extrovert. He said much family counseling was just <br/>
that--the parents thought there was something wrong with the child <br/>
because he wasn&#39;t like them.<br/>
<br/>
---She is defiantly an extrovert-&quot;My little Fairy&quot;. Dh, ds, and I are all<br/>
introverts. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a fundamental difference in the way she likes to interact <br/>
with the world, maybe you could look for clubs or classes or <br/>
something where she might meet people who are more like her, have her <br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
We recently found a Homeschool group that we all like. It&#39;s a very new group<br/>
and the owner has some great ideas and seems very committed. We will be<br/>
meeting once a week to do various things starting next month. I think that<br/>
will help her a lot. I think the large range of different activities will<br/>
help her find some new interests.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe invite another kid over sometimes (doesn&#39;t have to be a girl,  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be her age) or take one or two of them with you on an  <br/>
outing (zoo, museum, lunch, whatever).   That will give her others to  <br/>
interact with, if you invite them over a few times they might invite  <br/>
her over, and she might develop a social life that involves you only  <br/>
as a driver. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might make a big, good difference to her.<br/>
<br/>
We were that other family for some only children, and for on middle- <br/>
of-many, quieter than the rest of his family, who squatted in Kirby&#39;s  <br/>
room like a ghost for most of two years.  I got grumpy and wanted to  <br/>
chase him off once, but Kirby defended him and said he LIKED having  <br/>
him there more than being alone.  So he was helping Kirby have  <br/>
someone outside the family too.  Things changed at his house and he  <br/>
want back, about the time he got a job, and we don&#39;t see him much  <br/>
anymore, but when he needed us we were  here.<br/>
<br/>
Someday, with stories to come home with to tell you she might feel a  <br/>
whole new relationship to the rest of you at home.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t tell her all that, though, because you can&#39;t guarantee it will  <br/>
happen.  The first steps, though, would be to get other people into  <br/>
your house for her to hang out with.<br/>

<br/>
She might FEEL obligated but it doesn&#39;t mean that she is. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If my mom divorced at my request and came to live next to me, I would  <br/>
BE obligated.  I could decide not to fulfill that obligation and  <br/>
suffer the resultant damage to my own reputation and realiability and  <br/>
sense of goodness, but the concept of obligation is an indebtedness.<br/>
<br/>
She owes her mom to fulfill whatever deal or offer was made before  <br/>
the divorce.  I hope it wasn&#39;t &quot;And we will live next to you for the  <br/>
rest of our lives and do whatever you say.&quot;  I doubt it.  But I also  <br/>
doubt it was &quot;Leave him and we&#39;ll help you for a year or so and then  <br/>
be gone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Am I obligated to stay with my husband?  He doesn&#39;t control my  <br/>
obligations, I do.  I did swear in front of a bunch of people that I  <br/>
would stay.  I can choose to remember that and honor it, or I can  <br/>
choose to picture them all and think... &quot;NAH.&quot;  None of them would  <br/>
wish me to stay in a dangerous or miserable situation, but it&#39;s not  <br/>
dangerous or miserable at all!<br/>
<br/>
The story as presented here was not &quot;My mom and aunt come and tell me  <br/>
what to do,&quot; it was &quot;I tell them, I ask them, and I care what they  <br/>
say.&quot;  (Quotes are voices of summary versions not the actual words  <br/>
posted.)<br/>
<br/>
I have an obligation to be good to my kids.  I&#39;ve told all of you  <br/>
people I intend to and I&#39;m trying to, and I believe I should,and so I  <br/>
am obliged to live up to what I&#39;ve stated in public to be my  <br/>
principles.  It&#39;s an obligation I chose.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, my granny&#39;s phrase for &quot;thank you&quot; was &quot;Much  <br/>
obliged.&quot;  It makes more sense than &quot;thank you&quot; which is short for  <br/>
longer phrases and sentiments most people have never thought about.   <br/>
&quot;Much obliged&quot; means &quot;I owe you one,&quot; only it doesn&#39;t limit to  <br/>
&quot;one.&quot;  It&#39;s like the pretty phrase &quot;I am in your debt&quot; which was  <br/>
used lots 500 years ago and means what &quot;Yours sincerely&quot; used to mean  <br/>
before it was shortened and forgotten (like &quot;thank you&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
There are legal obligations (like repaying loans one has signed for),  <br/>
but there are lighter social obligations that are easy to break.   <br/>
Just because it&#39;s possible and easy doesn&#39;t make it right or good,  <br/>
though.<br/>

<br/>
Yes it does.<br/>
I can tell you story after story of people that needed physical<br/>
distance from family and found GREAT healing in that. Physical space<br/>
is VERY important when one needs to heal childhood issues and find a<br/>
space to be an independent adult.<br/>
<br/>
I know that moving away from my family at 18 was hard, but when I<br/>
heard from my sisters about some of the issues they dealt with, I was<br/>
SO glad for that space. It changes your relationship with parents and<br/>
grandparents. If they&#39;ve been meddlesome or controlling, it gives you<br/>
a HUGELY different space that forces them to back off.<br/>
<br/>
It helps in a million ways. I can&#39;t advocate moving away enough...only<br/>
for those that are needing to heal past issues or force a change in<br/>
the relationship of course. If you have a healthy, close relationship,<br/>
then that&#39;s a different story.<br/>
<br/>
I turned a very tumultuous relationship with my mother into a very<br/>
close and loving relationship (we both did) and space between us at<br/>
the beginning was very useful. I never had a dysfunctional or<br/>
codependent relationship with her, yet the distance was still useful<br/>
in healing childhood crap. I think in a co-dependency situation it<br/>
could be the best thing you do for your marriage and relationship with<br/>
the children.<br/>
