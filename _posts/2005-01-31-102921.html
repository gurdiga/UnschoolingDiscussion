<br/>
She then asked what Duncan was into. Honestly, the only answer I had was &quot;Games.&quot; But then I elaborated: &quot;Video games, computer games, card games, board games, math games, word games, physical games.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was SOOO eye-opening for me: He gets to learn from games. How damned COOL!<br/>
