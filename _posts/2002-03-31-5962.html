&gt;Isn&#39;t he the same guy who wrote Blue Highways, about traveling<br/>
&gt;cross-country on the smaller roads (blue on most maps) and the people he<br/>
&gt;meets and the things he sees? I read that 15 or 20 years ago and still<br/>
&gt;remember it, and I&#39;ve always wanted to do that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s him.  I read that when I was just out of high school, and I&#39;ve <br/>
STILL never gotten around to it.  :)<br/>

That reminds me of a book I read called paddle to the Amazon. A Father and <br/>
son paddle all the way from Canada to South America....often with serious <br/>
risk to their lives. It&#39;s an amazing adventure story.<br/>
Can&#39;t remember the author though.<br/>
