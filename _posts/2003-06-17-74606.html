<br/>
From interpreting your words, I come to the conclusion that she didn&#39;t lie. <br/>
It seems as if she thought she already had permission to go to the pool and was <br/>
simply waiting for her friend. It does seem she neglected to say, &quot;Jan&#39;s here <br/>
with her Gdaughter, we&#39;re off!&quot; or something similar but if she was operating <br/>
on the assumption that you already knew she had plans, then you would know <br/>
where she was. Did you actually say to her, something to the affect of, &quot;come <br/>
inside and tell me that it&#39;s time for you to go before you leave.&quot;?<br/>
