Yes I am begining to see that you are correct about needing to <br/>
*deschool*.  We have been deschooling for the last 3months - I do <br/>
suggest things to do occasionally - then i leave it up to toni.  I <br/>
can see an improvment. She does have good days.  Today she spent <br/>
about 45mins answereing her emails. She has e pals in UK and <br/>
america.  She then did 2-3 pages of math from the work book.  THe <br/>
math work book is the only formal work we do and I ask for one page a <br/>
week.  So things are improving.<br/>
To the mum whos child still has PJ&#39;s on at lunch time - Toni usually <br/>
stays in her PJ&#39;s until almost lunch, unless we are going out.  She <br/>
is a night owl - not going to sleep untill 10.30pm-ish and getting up <br/>
about 9.30am and lying around until lunch - she does her best work <br/>
late afternoon early evening.  <br/>
At first I had problems with this as i am a morning person - up at <br/>
5.30am - but I have now accepted that our body clocks are different - <br/>
<br/>
We have had a good day today - we still have terible days  - but not <br/>
as often...<br/>
