Do you remember what she ate out in the field in the book? A potato? A <br/>
carrot? A turnip? <br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, it was never the same vegie. It was different in the book, the <br/>
screenplay, AND in the movie! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

her empty stomach. And Iwould have bet money it was a radish in both the book <br/>
and the theatre version -- though I first saw GWTW the film in a plush <br/>
Jacksonville FL theatre right after its big first re-release in Atlanta, and that&#39;s <br/>
been about 35 years ago. :)  JJ<br/>

whole family drove over from Gainesville for the day. It was the fanciest <br/>
theatre I had seen and the first film I ever saw with an intermission. What an <br/>
experience. <br/>

       So you&#39;re living in Jax, now? I&#39;m a couple of hours to your west, in <br/>
the currently-crowded-with-legislators city. :)  JJ<br/>

Chapter 25 / XXV<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Close to the back step of one cabin, she found a short row of radishes <br/>
and her hunger assulted her suddenly.  A spicy, sharp-tasting radish <br/>
was exactly what her stomach craved.  Hardly waiting to rub the dirt <br/>
off on her skirt, she bit off half and swallowed it hastily.  It was <br/>
old and course and so peppery that tears started in her eyes.&quot;<br/>
