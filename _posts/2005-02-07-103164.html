<div id="ygrps-yiv-407839286">I received this by e-mail and wrote and said I preferred to answer questions <br/>
for large groups rather than individuals.  Also, I think people benefit from a <br/>
variety of responses.  I asked the mom to join this group and so I hope she <br/>
will, and see the responses.  I&#39;ll forward the first few to her just in case it <br/>
takes a while for her to be established on the group.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll respond too, in another e-mail.<br/>

Hi Sandra,<br/>
  I&#39;m interested in unschooling and have read some of your posts on the<br/>
board.   If you&#39;re not too busy, could you help me with the transition. <br/>
This is what I&#39;m dealing with.  I&#39;ve tried just about every curriculum<br/>
that&#39;s out there.  I&#39;m fed up with curriculum.  Right now, I have my<br/>
12yodd reading A History of the US, any Science book from the library of<br/>
her choosing, Sonlight&#39;s Tom Sawyer and a literature guide for Reading,<br/>
Spelling Power, Key to Decimals and a grammar workbook.  She just doesn&#39;t<br/>
get grammar and never has.  She hates to read.  If I will leave her<br/>
alone, she will read other stuff, but not what I would like for her to<br/>
read.  When we go to the library, she picks out books on softball,<br/>
snakes, etc.  She will read those with no problems.  Should I just let<br/>
her read her own thing and still have her do spelling, grammar and math<br/>
or what?   I really need your advice.  My 8yodd is doing Explode the<br/>
Code, but gets very frustrated when she can&#39;t read the words.  I don&#39;t<br/>
press her to read, but she will on her own, maybe once every two weeks. <br/>
I don&#39;t push her to do math, but she likes to do a math program on the<br/>
computer, along with other games.  I do have her write a sentence every<br/>
day.  I&#39;m not really sure why I do this.  She seems to be a perfect<br/>
candidate for unschooling.  My 6yodd is not interested in learning to<br/>
read or anything else right now.  She likes to do worksheets though.  I<br/>
hate them.  I have a hard time finding the sheets, when she can&#39;t read. <br/>
She just doesn&#39;t get phonics, so I figured that she just wasn&#39;t ready. <br/>
She also likes to do computer games.  I like to do unit studies, but<br/>
there&#39;s so much work involved in these, that I just don&#39;t want to take<br/>
the time to do them.  I really want to do unschooling, but I&#39;m so afraid<br/>
that the girls won&#39;t be learning anything or will want to watch tv all<br/>
day.  Only the oldest one does that the most.  She is interested in<br/>
beauty school and can start this when she is 16, but what do I do in the<br/>
meantime?  I just need some help.  Please give me some advice.  Am I<br/>
doing something wrong?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-297935653">I&#39;m going to start at the bottom of the questions:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Am I doing something wrong?-=-<br/>
<br/>
This kind of question is unanswerable out of the context of &quot;if I want X <br/>
result...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing illegal about the kinds of teaching and management outlined <br/>
in the post.<br/>
There are millions of people who would say &quot;Exactly right!&quot; and that many <br/>
more who would say &quot;No, just put them in school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m going to assume the question meant &quot;If I want to move toward workable <br/>
unschooling, what should I change?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These things struck me as the most counterproductive:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Right now, I have my<br/>
12yodd reading A History of the US, any Science book from the library of<br/>
her choosing, Sonlight&#39;s Tom Sawyer and a literature guide for Reading,<br/>

<br/>
-=If I will leave her alone, she will read other stuff, but not what I would <br/>
like for her to<br/>
read. -=-<br/>
<br/>
-= My 8yodd is doing Explode the<br/>

<br/>
-=I do have her write a sentence every<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
-=-She just doesn&#39;t get phonics, so I figured that she just wasn&#39;t ready. -=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-I like to do unit studies, but<br/>

the time to do them.  I really want to do unschooling, . . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=I really want to do unschooling, but I&#39;m so afraid<br/>
that the girls won&#39;t be learning anything or will want to watch tv all<br/>
day. -=-<br/>
<br/>
And this could be a topic all on its own, but -=- I really need your advice. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I advise people who want to know about unschooling to stop doing any <br/>
schooling and start listening quietly for real natural learning.  It can&#39;t happen <br/>
along with the noise of assignments and programs and limitations on which books to <br/>
read and how much time not to watch TV.<br/>
<br/>
The first change has to come in the parent. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

12yodd reading A History of the US, any Science book from the library of<br/>

<br/>
This is parent directed.  It&#39;s school at home.  My only comment is &quot;don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
Or if you want to, do.  But don&#39;t expect ANY unschooling to take hold in your <br/>
mind or her life what that &quot;having&quot; is going on.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe read this:<br/>

<br/>
To say &quot;I have my 12 year old doing X&quot; is another step beyond even thinking <br/>
YOU have to do something.  Someone else is living under your &quot;have to.&quot;  Look <br/>
for choices.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=If I will leave her alone, she will read other stuff, but not what I would <br/>
like for her to<br/>
read. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If she reads what she wants to read and what she likes to read, that will be <br/>
reading.<br/>
If you want her to read what you wuold like for her to read, then unschooling <br/>
won&#39;t work for you, *UNLESS* you can be so persuasive and inspiring that you <br/>
make those readings seem so alluring and sparkly that she wants to read it <br/>
because it&#39;s wonderful and YOU like it and you can share the reading together and <br/>
have lovely bonding moments.  But that would still change the focus of your <br/>
desires and satisfactions from her doing what you would like, to the two of you <br/>
doing something together.<br/>
<br/>
-= My 8yodd is doing Explode the<br/>
Code, but gets very frustrated when she can&#39;t read the words.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Doing&quot; meaning going there and being frustrated?<br/>
Think about what &quot;doing&quot; means to you.  <br/>
And why is she &quot;doing&quot; what frustrates her?  And why aren&#39;t you reading the <br/>
words to her?  (Don&#39;t answer those questions here, just in your head.)<br/>
<br/>
-=I do have her write a sentence every<br/>
day.  I&#39;m not really sure why I do this. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t do things that don&#39;t make sense to you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My 6yodd is not interested in learning to<br/>
read or anything else right now.  She likes to do worksheets though. -=-<br/>
<br/>
How about puzzle books, mazes, pattern books, tricky math games with patterns?<br/>
<br/>
-=-She just doesn&#39;t get phonics, so I figured that she just wasn&#39;t ready. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Phonics hardly helps anyone read English anyway.  Talk about frustration...<br/>
Start with the word &quot;phonics&quot; itself.  Should be foniks, if phonics were <br/>
worth a damn.<br/>

<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t want to unschool ust to save yourself time and effort.  It <br/>
takes as much time and effort, and at first it takes LOTS of time and effort on <br/>
the part of the parent to learn how to see the whole world differently.<br/>

learning anything or will want to watch tv all day. -=-<br/>

  Should I just let<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; her read her own thing ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is a great place to start.  This is when the real learning <br/>
happens, when they pick out their own <br/>
interests and read about, watch on tv about, or pursue those however <br/>
they choose.  It&#39;s<br/>
what they choose to bring into their lives that they will remember.<br/>
In our experience, anyway.  If you let go and let it happen, you can <br/>
look for the &quot;learning&quot; if you need to...it will be there.  You may <br/>
have to shift your perception of what learning is though and how it <br/>
really happens, in the way that it will stay with them.  It comes in <br/>
many different forms :0)  If you need to look at it in <br/>
school subjects, then reading about snakes falls <br/>
under &quot;science&quot;...right?  Plain old speaking in full sentences can<br/>
fall under &quot;grammar&quot;, etc. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~and still have her do spelling, grammar and math<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or what? ~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, don&#39;t do that :0) Not for unschooling. <br/>
Welcome to the world of unschooling....it&#39;s a wild ride and <br/>
can take you to places you&#39;d never guess it would :0) krista</div>
