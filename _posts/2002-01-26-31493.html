There is an interactive geoboard here along with many other things.  My kids liked the mastermind type thingys.  I was sitting here playing wih it and pretty soon they were all here wanting to do it.  There went my computer time even though they all have their own. It&#39;s kinda like sleeping in my bed,  it&#39;s more fun on my computer.   Probably cause I have a laptop and they can run me off of the chair!  lol.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323340031">Today Janene (age five) and I went to the store.  Our usually thing is <br/>
that she helps shops, helps choose things, etc. but that she also gets <br/>
to choose one thing I might otherwise not buy, as her &quot;treat&quot;.  She <br/>
wanted Kiwi fruit.  OK that was fine, not her treat though cause it was <br/>
for the family.  I got captain crunchy berries, cause it was on sale, as <br/>
my treat, but I&#39;ll get one bowl probably cause the kids like it too.  <br/>
She wanted strawberries, or blueberries, but they were very expensive, <br/>
so we spent about five minutes &quot;pounding them&quot; and the Janene decided <br/>
she&#39;s wait for them to be in season so she could get more for her <br/>
money.  The pounding comment was cute.  As we were discussing the cost <br/>
of the various berries, she wanted to weigh them so she said &quot;I&#39;ll just <br/>
pound these so we can figure out how much money they cost.&quot;  At one <br/>
point she picked out cocoa puffs for her treat.  She didn&#39;t know whether <br/>
to get that one or another equally repulsive (in my eyes) cereal, and <br/>
asked for my opinion and I told her they were both repulsive and I would <br/>
not be sharing them with her so she needed to get what pleased herself.  <br/>
She did, she got Cocoa Puffs.  As we moved through the store she&#39;d see <br/>
something else she wanted but would debate the merits of the new item <br/>
and Cocoa Puffs and then stuck with Cocoa puffs--Until we got to the <br/>
cheese section.  There she found some cheese shaped in wild animal <br/>
shapes.  We couldn&#39;t find a price and she decided to wait until we had a <br/>
price before deciding upon the cheese or the cocoa puffs.  At the check <br/>
out counter she saw some ring suckers and seriously considered those as <br/>
her treat.  We got the price for the cheese and she wavered back and <br/>
forth until she decided to get--the cheese.  It&#39;s not the best cheese, <br/>
but it&#39;s cheese.  Everyone in line got a kick out of the child who <br/>
picked cheese over chocolate cereal, and didn&#39;t get when I explained <br/>
that in her mind all food is equal. <br/>
<br/>
THe &quot;Pound it&quot; comment really made me laugh though.  I had another ctts <br/>
from a student today similar to that.  He was writing a paragraph and <br/>
said that soccer was good because it was good excersize and you got to <br/>
&quot;do a lot of verbs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read it and read it.  What did he mean.  I finially figured it out. <br/>
Verbs are action words, and soccer is an active sport.  You get to be <br/>
active.  So I just suggested that instead of saying it like that, <br/>
instead he use specific verbs like run and kick. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget that though, never quite thought I&#39;d hear <br/>
the word verb used in quite that way.<br/>

Could he be familiar with that Verb.com commercial? &quot;Verb, it&#39;s what you do&quot; or something like that is the way it goes...shows shadow-figures running, skating, jumping, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah picked up on that right away when it first came out, and truly understands what a verb is now LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778599874">My very very top number one most recommended math book for <br/>
homeschooling parents!!!! Glad to hear others feel the same way.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with Pat Kenschaft, the author, about the possibility of a new <br/>
edition or at least a reprint. She is a university professor and busy <br/>
with other work and says she can&#39;t get a publisher because, even though <br/>
her book did very very well, it isn&#39;t marketed to an audience that is a <br/>
recognized target audience for publishers - it isn&#39;t really for <br/>
homeschoolers, but for parents, and publishers feel like few parents <br/>
care about educating their own children. I suggested some publishers <br/>
and that she  look at those publishers who put out homeschooling books <br/>
(Prima, for example). She was going to look into them - hope she does.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, it is out of print but still available here and there. <br/>
I bought it brand new in a bookstore just this past August.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be taking a lot of her ideas and slowly, but surely, putting them <br/>
on my math blog. There is not a whole lot there yet, but there is some, <br/>
and I&#39;m working on it pretty steadily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204494117">Sandra, I&#39;d say the Ravitch book is not school-bashing, more of an <br/>
expose of the children&#39;s publishing industry and how centralized and homogenized <br/>
it&#39;s become -- <br/>
<br/>
       It&#39;s probably wise for all us unschoolers to realize what&#39;s happening <br/>
and why. Then when confronted with the results, we can help our children see <br/>
and understand it, too. We ALL have to live in the society that&#39;s being created <br/>
by such artificial controls on divergent thinking.<br/>
<br/>
       Not to say we need a big discussion of it here, though. In the spring <br/>
I posted several news articles about the Language Police and also a link to <br/>
the National Public Radio interview with the author, about these issues and how <br/>
she came to write the book. Those interested can check out NHEN&#39;s forums in a <br/>

What Dick and Jane can&#39;t read <br/>
Chicago Sun-Times<br/>
BY HENRY KISOR, BOOK EDITOR <br/>
<br/>
&#39;Cancel the kitchen scraps for lepers and orphans, no more merciful <br/>
beheadings and call off Christmas!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll never read that delicious line from &quot;Robin Hood, Prince of <br/>
Thieves&quot;--or even its components &quot;lepers,&quot; &quot;orphans,&quot; &quot;beheadings&quot; and &quot;Christmas&quot;--in <br/>
America&#39;s textbooks and standardized school tests. The sensitivity police of <br/>
American educational publishing, as rigid and ill-tempered as the sheriff of <br/>
Nottingham, won&#39;t allow it. To them those words are just too controversial.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;hot dog,&quot; &quot;fireman,&quot; &quot;brotherhood,&quot; &quot;you and your wife,&quot; &quot;England ruled the <br/>

(in reference to a female dog), &quot;first baseman,&quot; &quot;Chief Sitting Bull&quot; and even <br/>

musicians. <br/>

<br/>
You can&#39;t mention George Washington Carver&#39;s work with peanuts or Mary McLeod <br/>
Bethune&#39;s National Association for Colored Women. You can&#39;t breathe a word <br/>
about magic, witchcraft, family conflict, sexuality, satanism, evolution, the <br/>
supernatural, Mount Rushmore, owls, God, or Harry Potter.<br/>
<br/>
Why? Somebody somewhere might be sorely wounded by references to what some <br/>
people consider possibly offensive words, stereotypes, subversive concepts or <br/>
foods they consider bad for you. (And you must call Sitting Bull by his Lakota <br/>
name, which, as everyone knows, is Totanka Iotanka.)<br/>

<br/>
Ravitch, an academic and assistant secretary of education in the first Bush <br/>
administration, is a conservative, but liberals will find her remarkably <br/>
even-handed. She spanks not only civil rights firebrands and extreme feminists but <br/>
also the Christian Right for smothering the American classroom with their <br/>
zealous demands for censorship. The Left wants schools to teach &quot;an idealized <br/>
vision of the future&quot;; the Right wants schools to teach &quot;an idealized vision of the <br/>
past.&quot; And nobody seems to want the world taught as it actually is--with <br/>
depth, complexity and subtlety.<br/>
<br/>
(JJ&#39;s note - well, nobody except all of us at NHEN. Maybe this could be our <br/>
new public frame, that only home education makes it possible to teach the world <br/>
with depth, complexity and subtlety! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025504966">Yes! I agree the primary sources and undigested exposure in <br/>
systematic schooling is much too late coming. Part of why we uschool, to avoid that <br/>
concern for my own children, so they will read and think voraciously without <br/>
interference or control.<br/>
<br/>
       But when you say &quot;every textbook manufacturer&quot; the point is realizing <br/>
how small a group that has become, and that any competition that remains <br/>
between them is not of the beneficial kind (if it ever was.)   I recall one of the <br/>
points her book means to make is that only four conglomerates now control the <br/>
entire textbook, curriculum AND (drum roll) testing market. It all spirals <br/>
together tighter and tighter, so only a few business decision-makers really do <br/>
control the content the whole population of American children are mandated to <br/>
master.  And if I remember right, three of those four aren&#39;t even American, but <br/>
foreign owned -- so the issue was whether it&#39;s really anything like the free <br/>
marketplace of ideas we might want, or believe we have.<br/>
<br/>
      Standardized tests do affect people beyond public school, when they <br/>
want college admission or other advanced study or to enter the military, etc, and <br/>
testing also seems to determine how the general public thinks about what <br/>
&quot;learning&quot; is and what it means to &quot;be educated.&quot; The folks that brought us the <br/>
SAT folks now are considering entering the curriculum market, for example, to <br/>
eke more profit out of proprietary work they&#39;ve already done and branding <br/>
they&#39;ve already paid for, I guess. And many homeschoolers rely on schoolish <br/>
curriculum materials and test their children regularly. In some states those test <br/>
scores actually decide whether home education (and/or unschooling) legally can <br/>
continue!<br/>
<br/>
       Personally I think knowing more about all this can indeed help move <br/>
people to unschooling, and can help us explain why unschooling is important and <br/>
valuable. Not just for our own children but for society, which NEEDS people <br/>
like us who don&#39;t buy into the centralization and control of words and ideas.<br/>

 <br/>
My problem with it, besides fully understanding the depths to which this censorship has pervaded government education, realizing I myself was victim of it (which alongside points made in JTGatto&#39;s Underground History of American Education only served to clarify exactly WHY I was so unhappy in school and bored out of my mind); is that when reading parts of it aloud to my best friend...she kept saying &quot;Yes, I know&quot; and &quot;Yes, I realize that&quot; and either she truly DIDN&#39;T understand and was patronizing me or she does truly know and yet CHOOSES to continue to subject her children to this drivel even when there are other options available, even if only temporary!!! But then expects her children to have high grades and be motivated and accomplished academically. <br/>

       It&#39;s probably wise for all us unschoolers to realize what&#39;s happening <br/>

worse now, but I doubt that textbooks were ever anything but bland, boring, <br/>
simplistic (don&#39;t know about unreadable), and purged of ideas and images <br/>
that might stir independent thought.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I would like to think that those here are not interested in their children <br/>
wasting the time with censored materials rather than the original texts of <br/>
all books, not simply textbooks. <br/>

&quot;Those here&quot; are unschoolers, pretty much, and textbooks aren&#39;t a part of <br/>
their lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-158385516">Well, there you go -- the very primary sources and un-predigested <br/>
literature we were bemoaning the absences of! <br/>
<br/>
       Seriously, I take your point and agree. Textbooks have been insipid <br/>
from the get-go, compared to &quot;real&quot; books. Ravitch just makes the case that they <br/>
have gotten  worse. <br/>
