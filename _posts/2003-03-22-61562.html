HA!! I just love the way you think Deb.....<br/>
<br/>
I am positively baffled by people who refuse to own a tv. I was raised <br/>
without one and I was so incredibly sheltered and naive in many ways because <br/>
of that.<br/>
Schools don&#39;t know how to get kids excited about geography/social studies <br/>
(yucky words) but seeing another country/culture on tv is absolutely AWESOME!!<br/>
My kids have such a bigger world view all because of tv...it&#39;s incredible.<br/>
I&#39;m so glad that my parents bias got nipped in the bud thanks to several <br/>
people here.<br/>
Our lives are bigger, fuller, richer due to the use of television.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the weather channel with Paul just to be watching!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of one of the parent testimonials in Plug-In Drug.  A family<br/>
was in a foreign country and the parent was appalled that his young son<br/>
wanted to watch the TV even though he didn&#39;t understand the language.  The<br/>
father (and the book&#39;s author) took this to mean that TV is so addictive<br/>
that people will watch it even if they don&#39;t understand what they are<br/>
viewing.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, they didn&#39;t stop to think that this little boy may have been<br/>
fascinated by hearing a foreign language or some other aspect of the show.<br/>

  The poor little girl of your friend is watching because she is restricted. She&#39;s dying to know what&#39;s going on with what she can&#39;t possibly have at home. You pretty much said that yourself. Isn&#39;t it possible that your children will also want to know why they can&#39;t see certain programs and then become that same little girl when they have the chance? There&#39;s an awful lot of allure to something you&#39;re not allowed to have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638871567">There isn&#39;t much that they aren&#39;t allowed, and they<br/>
are told the reasons why. Some things have been<br/>
allowed and discontinued because it was negatively<br/>
affecting their behavior (like public school was<br/>
LOL!). <br/>
<br/>
Will they seek out things that are &quot;forbidden&quot; yes,<br/>
and I expect that, it has happened and they are<br/>
reminded why something is not allowed at this point;<br/>
and not just in their television viewing habits but<br/>
other things; but I intend to give them an<br/>
understanding of the possible ramifications as well as<br/>
benefits of such actions be it watching a show that<br/>
may give them nightmares or wanting to smoke a<br/>
cigarette or have an alcoholic drink before they do<br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
Would I give my 7 y/o a beer? No. Might I let my teen<br/>
get drunk in the safety of our home when &quot;all my<br/>
friends&quot; are out partying and it seems the cool thing<br/>
to do? Quite possibly....but I&#39;m getting off topic. <br/>
<br/>
My problem with the neighbor&#39;s child coming over and<br/>
ONLY wanting to watch our TV, is that she will ignore<br/>
her friend, be disrespectful and whiny to me...and she<br/>
will be disrespectful to her mother when her mother<br/>
arrives..for example what happened the other day...she<br/>
refused to do as she was told and put on her shoes and<br/>
jacket because it was time to leave, throwing a fit to<br/>
stay and watch tv. I turned it off, same as I would<br/>
(and do) with my own children when their watching<br/>
something intereferes with their behavior...Nor do I<br/>
like facilitating a child&#39;s deception and/or disregard<br/>
of their parents wishes. When her mother asks me to<br/>
not let her watch anything at all even previously<br/>
agreed upon shows, I won&#39;t. It has caused some small<br/>
problems among the child and my daughter and for my<br/>
daughter and me as well. <br/>

&gt; why they can&#39;t see certain programs and then become<br/>

&lt;&lt; Would I give my 7 y/o a beer? No. Might I let my teen<br/>
get drunk in the safety of our home when &quot;all my<br/>
friends&quot; are out partying and it seems the cool thing<br/>
to do?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never told a kid they couldn&#39;t taste alcohol.  We&#39;ve offered it <br/>
directly.  &quot;You want a taste?&quot;  No.<br/>
<br/>
We very rarely drink, and few of our friends drink.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are 16, 14 and 11.  Kirby and Marty are often out with friends.  At <br/>
the moment they&#39;re both gone, both with older people with cars.  None of <br/>
their friends drink.  Even those who are 23, 25.  These boys COULD and choose <br/>
not to.  They have one friend who smokes cigarettes and they show him no <br/>
mercy.  They tell him not to do it so close to them, that they don&#39;t want to <br/>
smell like that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Nor do I like facilitating a child&#39;s deception and/or disregard<br/>
of their parents wishes. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The best thing about our life with our kids is they are never deceptive in <br/>
the least.<br/>
We wish for them to be considerate and responsible and they are.<br/>
We&#39;re considerate toward them.  <br/>
<br/>
I would never turn a TV program off that someone was watching.  <br/>
Certainly not an adult, and I treat my children with as much respect as I <br/>
treat adults.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Will they seek out things that are &quot;forbidden&quot; yes,<br/>
and I expect that, it has happened&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids will not and have not, because instead of having lists of forbidden <br/>
things, we live by principles of respect and kindness.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But then again I think South Park is really funny, we love The Simpsons, and <br/>
Kirby is the coordinator of the Yu-Gi-Oh tournament at the gaming shop where <br/>
he works, and I&#39;m certain it&#39;s not demonic or satanic or whatever you said it <br/>
was.  (Ah.  &quot;Promotes sorcery.&quot;  Kirby has no ensorcelling abilities <br/>
whatsoever, and he&#39;s been involved with Magic, D&D, Pokemona nd Yu-Gi-Oh all. <br/>
 He was a big Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles fan, though, and because of that <br/>
he&#39;s been at the same karate dojo for over seven years now.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Take Animaniacs...popular children&#39;s cartoon...the<br/>
characters are rude to each other, obnoxious,<br/>
foul-mouthed (they may not swear but that&#39;s beside the<br/>
point); the Simpsons, SouthPark and others are<br/>
marketed to kids when the content is adult...-=-<br/>
<br/>
South Park is not marketted to kids.  It&#39;s marketted to adults.   Too many <br/>
adults have an anti-cartoon prejudice, thinking cartoons are just for kids.  <br/>
Animaniacs is popular in perpetuity, being not produced anymore.  The <br/>
singalong videos are wonderful.  My sister&#39;s kids memorized the nations of <br/>
the world song.  My kids never quite mastered it, though they tried.  <br/>
Musically, some of that stuff was as sophisticated as any complicated <br/>
Broadway show tune.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes there are many great cartoons for kids,<br/>
DragonTales, Blue&#39;s Clues, Dora The Explorer; but I<br/>
also find alot of political correctness and whatnot<br/>
being taught that I object to. &gt;&gt;<br/>

It&#39;s possible that this list won&#39;t be the unschooling you&#39;re looking for.<br/>

YAKKO&#39;S UNIVERSE<br/>
Music and lyrics by Randy Rogel. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Yakko: Everybody lives on a street in a city<br/>
       Or a village or a town for what it&#39;s worth.<br/>
       And they&#39;re all inside a country which is part of a continent<br/>
       That sits upon a planet known as Earth.<br/>
       And the Earth is a ball full of oceans and some mountains<br/>
       Which is out there spinning silently in space.<br/>
       And living on that Earth are the plants and the animals<br/>
       And also the entire human race.<br/>
 <br/>
       It&#39;s a great big universe<br/>
       And we&#39;re all really puny<br/>
       We&#39;re just tiny little specks<br/>
       About the size of Mickey Rooney.<br/>
       It&#39;s big and black and inky<br/>
       And we are small and dinky<br/>
       It&#39;s a big universe and we&#39;re not.<br/>
 <br/>
       And we&#39;re part of a vast interplanetary system<br/>
       Stretching seven hundred billion miles long.<br/>
       With nine planets and a sun; we think the Earth&#39;s the only<br/>
one<br/>
       That has life on it, although we could be wrong.<br/>
       Across the interstellar voids are a billion asteroids<br/>
       Including meteors and Halley&#39;s Comet too.<br/>
       And there&#39;s over fifty moons floating out there like balloons<br/>
       In a panoramic trillion-mile view.<br/>
 <br/>
       And still it&#39;s all a speck amid a hundred billion stars<br/>
       In a galaxy we call the Milky Way.<br/>
       It&#39;s sixty thousand trillion miles from one end to the other<br/>
       And still that&#39;s just a fraction of the way.<br/>
       &#39;Cause there&#39;s a hundred billion galaxies that stretch across<br/>
the sky<br/>
       Filled with constellations, planets, moons and stars.<br/>
       And still the universe extends to a place that never ends<br/>
       Which is maybe just inside a little jar!<br/>
 <br/>
YW+D : It&#39;s a great big universe<br/>
       And we&#39;re all really puny<br/>
       We&#39;re just tiny little specks<br/>
       About the size of Mickey Rooney.<br/>
*      Though we don&#39;t know how it got here<br/>
*      We&#39;re an important part here<br/>
*      It&#39;s a big universe and it&#39;s ours!<br/>
 <br/>
* - In the original script, these lines were:<br/>
<br/>
YW+D : You might think that you&#39;re essential<br/>
       Try inconsequential<br/>
       It&#39;s a small world after all!<br/>

My 10 yo has just started watching The Daily Show (satirical news) and there will be lots of one -offs like Children of Dune. They never watch cartoons which I find a bit bizarre given that they are 10,<br/>
9 and 7.<br/>
We&#39;ve just joined Netflix so the other day they were trawling through that and picking out movies and ordering them. Dawd knows what will arrive over the next few weeks although I think I saw all the<br/>
Pink Panther movies ordered :-)<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;d better go wash my mind out with soap. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HA!! I just love the way you think Deb.....<br/>
<br/>
I am positively baffled by people who refuse to own a tv. I was raised <br/>
without one and I was so incredibly sheltered and naive in many ways because <br/>
of that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was groing up we had a tv, but the things that we could watch were severly restricted. Ex: the smurfs (anyone remember them?) my mom would stand next to the tv ang when Gargamel(sp) whould come on she would stand in front of the tv so we couldn&#39;t see what was happening. My brother and I begged for months to be allowed to watch He-Man and She-Ra, they finally relented when we told them there was a moral at the end of each episode, luckly they were at work when those cartoons were on, one look at Skelator and those would have been on the resticted list.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with my kids watching anything they want to. Jaiden has things that he likes and things that he doesn&#39;t, He knows what he can handle and chooses. Ex: Courage the Cowerdly Dog, it scared him, he had only seen it at night before he went to sleep, so he stoped watching it. Then there was a marathon or something and a bunch of shows were on during the day and he asked me to watch them with him. Now that he&#39;s seen them during the day, he says they don&#39;t scare him and Courage has been added to his nightly cartoons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-158098001">From: Elizabeth Roberts <br/>
  &lt;&lt;We watch WITH them and discuss things as they come up,<br/>
  however there are things that we don&#39;t allow even with<br/>
  our being there (at this time) becuase we don&#39;t feel<br/>
  it&#39;s appropriate for a child. What is appropriate for<br/>
  a 7 y/o old is obviously different from that of an<br/>
  older child or young adult.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  When given the opportunity to not have restrictions, children chose on their own things that are interesting and appropriate for them. My kids have free reign on cable tv. We have no restrictions on that. I have never gone out in the playroom and seen the children watching anything that would be considered inappropriate for their age by most standards. They just don&#39;t care for things that my husband and I would watch. It&#39;s NOT interesting to them because they can watch if they want to but they DON&#39;T want to. My children very frequently get up and leave the room when watching something that maybe we thought they would like that they don&#39;t. They have that choice and use it quite often. Can&#39;t say I ever saw them catching some movie like Scarface or something. Now if I wouldn&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; them access, then by all means they would want to know what they couldn&#39;t see and why.<br/>

&lt;&lt; If you want some help in understanding how differently we think you could <br/>
post a specific example.  That might be easier for you to see how I think.  <br/>
My boys are not restricted in any way regarding TV.  But I am not sure what <br/>
you think is not appropriate.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When people say things like this and say their kids just haven&#39;t asked to <br/>
smoke cigarettes, I&#39;m imagining that Elizabeth is thinking that means we show <br/>
our kids slasher films and buy them cigarettes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so foreign to the traditional &quot;childrearing&quot; methods that many &quot;reared&quot; <br/>
minds can&#39;t begin to wrap around it.<br/>
<br/>
This happens a few times a year, that someone shows up who is determined to <br/>
tell us that maybe WE don&#39;t care if our kids ever learn math but THEY *have* <br/>
to teach math.  Dozens of us see the irony, and that new writer/speaker <br/>
doesn&#39;t begin to.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t forbid very much.   I have not forbidden my children to sell their <br/>
bodies on Central Avenue.  They know about prostitution.  Holly and I once <br/>
had twenty minutes to kill waiting to do something in that neighborhood, and <br/>
I took her cruising to see prostitutes.  The only one we saw was a <br/>
transvestite, black male, NICE legs, pretty dress.  She had me go around the <br/>
corner and pass by again and tell her how I had first noticed it was a man.  <br/>
Wig is no proof.  Legs and posture.  Arm muscles.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean Holly will be out there next?   I didn&#39;t tell her she should <br/>
or shouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an extreme and true example.  Let&#39;s bypass all the little examples and <br/>
go straight to a wild and crazy one.  <br/>
<br/>
So this same family in which the kids know prostitution exists has ZERO kids <br/>
who have expressed an interest in making some extra money that way.  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve seen cigarettes.  Smelled them.  Not liked it.  <br/>
When they visit a home where there are cigarette smokers, they&#39;ll come home <br/>
and take their clothes off and say &quot;MOM, please wash this stuff, it stinks.&quot;  <br/>
When their grandmother used to sew for them and send clothes, the very first <br/>
thing when we opened the box, out came a cloud of cigarette stench because <br/>
she smokes while she sews and it gets all into the cloth.  The last couple of <br/>
packages, we just opened by the washing machine.<br/>
<br/>
Should I forbid them to smoke?<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be NEARLY as effective as their own freely made decision.<br/>
<br/>
Same with drinking.  <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to forbid things when you discuss principles and live a <br/>
principled life.<br/>
<br/>
But then that statement won&#39;t make sense to someone whose principles involve <br/>
raising and protecting children from worldly influences, political <br/>
correctness, and the influence of Satan.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s another reason I don&#39;t think unschooling can work for everyone.  If <br/>
their priorities involve control and discipline, this isn&#39;t a place they can <br/>
get to.  For people whose priorities are treating their children as thinking <br/>
beings, as seeing beings, it&#39;s perfect.<br/>

 <br/>
When I was five, my mom and dad realized that there was (gasp) magic on<br/>
the Smurfs.  So they took away my Smurf toys and explained to me that<br/>
magic was evil and I could no longer watch the show and that they needed<br/>
to throw away my toys.  I explained that there was an evil character,<br/>
but that Papa Smurf was a good character.  My parents said it didn&#39;t<br/>
matter; all magic was evil and it was forbidden.  I never forgot that.<br/>
Did it make me think magic was evil?  Absolutely not.  As soon as I was<br/>
out of my parent&#39;s home I spent two or three years reading everything I<br/>
possibly could about magic and witchcraft. I wanted to know what it had<br/>
that scared them so much.<br/>
