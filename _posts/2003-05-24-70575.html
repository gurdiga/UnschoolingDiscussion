<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how do you get the unschooling handbook? and one other question what happens<br/>
&gt; when you opt for the digest format? Can you still contribute to the<br/>
&gt; conversation and how often does it come? I really love being on the list but<br/>
&gt; it is so hard to keep up with three children, two babies:) thanks Kelli<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only issue with digest mode is that you can&#39;t immediately respond to<br/>
emails.  So you lose the chance to be part of the back-and-forth type<br/>
discussions that go on sometimes.  You can still post, just sometiems you&#39;re<br/>
late on the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t find that a big issue, personally, and I much prefer the digests.<br/>
But many people dislike not being able to sort by subject thread,<br/>
auto-delete someone they don&#39;t care to read, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you do switch to digest, remember to change the subject line every time<br/>
you hit reply; it always says Digest Number whatever if you don&#39;t.  Also,<br/>
highlight just what you are replying to before hitting reply, or you&#39;ll have<br/>
to do lots of deleting.<br/>
