<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975966166">Does anyone here have a child that has been or is interested in photography? <br/>
Christopher has decided that he would like to be a photographer of animals <br/>
only and not a vet but we don&#39;t know where to start. If anyone here can give us <br/>
some tips, or like for what kind of companies hire for this, we&#39;d really <br/>
appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sort of took us by surprise when he announced this today as he has always <br/>
groomed animals and rescued them. We currently have 4 dogs/cats he has helped <br/>
rescue with the newest one a baby Beagle. Though he still wants to do this, he <br/>
really wants to pursue a career where he would take pictures of animals. He&#39;s <br/>
thirteen, he&#39;ll be 14 in December. Do kids at this age change their mind about <br/>
their future career? He&#39;s so full of changes lately and while all of them have <br/>
been wonderful to see him grow through, I&#39;m having a hard time keeping up!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Sure.  Adults do too.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of saying you&#39;re helping him make a career of being an animal <br/>
photographer, live today.<br/>
<br/>
Help him take pictures of animals.<br/>
<br/>
THAT he can successfully do this week.  And if he likes it and he&#39;s good and <br/>
he practices he might someday later make a career.  But for starters, he need <br/>
to just take pictures of animals.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d start gathering animal photos.  Maybe you can find old calendars and <br/>
magazines at thrift stores, and he can start look at what&#39;s common and special and <br/>
uncommon and wonderful, so he builds on what&#39;s already been done and aims for <br/>
what really impressed him.<br/>
<br/>
Is he interested in just pets, or in wild animals?<br/>
<br/>
What about sports stuff like polo or rodeo?  That&#39;s HARD photography.<br/>
<br/>
Magazines or books would have lots of samples.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of videos of wild animals.  Those guys will hide in a blind in <br/>
a swamp and wait for days.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does anyone here have a child that has been or is interested in photography<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter (just turned 14)  has shown serious interest in <br/>
photography....borrowing good cameras, reading extensively and taking pictures the past 6 <br/>
months.  For her birthday, we contacted a friend who is a photographer and collects <br/>
and sells cameras. We got a old Nikon 35 millimeter in excellent condition <br/>
from him and he spent an afternoon with her showing her the basics.  He first <br/>
became interest in photography<br/>
when he was 14 and is a photographer now with the U.S. Customs.<br/>
<br/>
His advice......use 100 speed film....and take pictures extensively.  She may <br/>
or may not continue with it but is completely immersed in it right now.  <br/>
After numerous rolls , her last roll had some excellent pictures that she was very <br/>
happy.  She is having so much fun and I&#39;m taking her to places where she can <br/>
photograph to her heart&#39;s content.  <br/>
<br/>
Brenna would be happy to answer questions and correspond with him via e-mail <br/>
if he would like.  Maybe she could recommend some books that she has found <br/>
helpful.<br/>

Christopher came to us and said he wanted to look into making a career out of <br/>
it, who he could work for and how to get started. I apologize for not being <br/>
clear with my words when I asked how to get started, I meant researching the <br/>
topic not taking pictures. He&#39;s been taking photographs & videos of animals for <br/>
years, it&#39;s one of his hobbies and he has enormous amounts of animal pictures, <br/>
albums, magazines, books, etc. I think he is looking towards his future and <br/>
deciding on his own what he may or may not need for a career. He KNOWS the <br/>
people here have great resources &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is he interested in just pets, or in wild animals?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right now just pets. He&#39;s pretty good at it. Who knows tomorrow it could be <br/>
alligators. From vet to pet photographer shouldn&#39;t surprise me much as he <br/>
enjoys anything to do with animals. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There are lots of videos of wild animals.  Those guys will hide in a blind <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOL, Christopher said no swamps for him! He&#39;s done dogs, cats and farm <br/>
animals the last couple of years but now he is particularly into birds, chipmunks, <br/>
moose, deer and the black bear probably because that is all we&#39;ve been seeing <br/>
in our back yard. He wasn&#39;t too crazy about getting to close to some of them so <br/>
he said he&#39;s sticking with pets or birds, the more calmer. <br/>

Has he called local portrait photographers and ask who in town is best at <br/>
animal portraits?  Maybe he could at least go in and look at the albums of <br/>

<br/>
In addition to what others have mentioned, I would suggest a Digital<br/>
camera. Although there are certain art aspects to using film, you can<br/>
still get good stuff and practice framing and lighting with digital. It<br/>
is much cheaper than film and processing while learning. Always get a CD<br/>
of the photos with the developed film, so that he can futz with the<br/>
images in the computer much more easily. Jayn is 4 next week; she often<br/>
asks for the camera and runs around taking all kinds of photos - some<br/>
are even of people and not her own toes. We have kept a few of them<br/>
inside our computers. There is a magazine that my DH subscribes to<br/>
called PC Photo about digital photography.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do kids at this age change their mind about <br/>
their future career?&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I must have changed my mind about 1000 times. However when I was young I<br/>
was very confused. It is ironic that once moving in to the workforce for<br/>
the first time, I returned to the arena I had decided on &quot;definitely&quot;<br/>
when I was six.<br/>

Oh yes, this puts a whole different spin on it, although I still<br/>
recommend subscribing to photog&#39;y mags as a way to hear about job<br/>
vacancies and competitions. There are also online competitions.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if he could apprentice to a local photographer of weddings or<br/>
child portraits - as the pet portrait specialist? <br/>
<br/>
The other first step that I would recommend to any and all &quot;creatives&quot;<br/>
is to immediately begin putting together your portfolio. Presentation is<br/>
very important.  <br/>
<br/>
Off the top of my head starting from the place of &quot;People who do stuff<br/>
with animals&quot; rather than &quot;people who buy/publish photos&quot; might also be<br/>
a second path towards an income. I&#39;m thinking put up a flyer at the vets<br/>
or local kennels offering his services to members of the public.<br/>
Reputable animal breeders could receive a flyer or give advice, people<br/>
showing their animals at shows and county fairs, here comes my bias -<br/>
people who train animals for film or tv always need good photos, rescue<br/>
centers and pet adoption places, dog groomers (before and after???) <br/>
<br/>
I looked at my Humane Society calendar and all the photos of gorgeous<br/>
animals are credited to different photographers with agencies/firms or<br/>
their own name as the company. A partial list: Rural Images; FPG<br/>
International - Getty Images Inc.; Ron Kimball Photography. It may be<br/>
worth writing to people for advice. <br/>

<br/>
When photographing animals it helps to get on their level. Avoid the head on <br/>
shots, animals tend to reflect the red eye in photographs. It is easier to sit <br/>
or lay down and wait for the shot, it looks more natural than trying to pose <br/>
a pet or even a wild animal. In the spring, hunt out a nest and put up a <br/>
ladder or climb the tree to get slightly above and at a small angle from the nest. <br/>
Then you can shoot the eggs, if you are lucky a hatching, and later the babies <br/>
at various stages. Some of my best shots of our pets have been when they are <br/>
not aware of me. I took some great pictures of Maggie (our Boston) with Jack <br/>
while they were napping, and another good set when Maggie was waiting for her <br/>
Daddy (Darin) to come home. She waits by the door and if the door is open and <br/>
just the screen door is between her and outside she will stand, looking out. <br/>
Our geckos are much harder to shoot, but I have a great red light and shoot in <br/>
the middle of the night when they are more active. <br/>
Just my observations.<br/>

Sometimes magazines that are geared toward a particular state have <br/>

up at ball tournaments and such and offer photos to participants.  There&#39;s <br/>

That&#39;s cool. Christopher read this last night and today he went<br/>
spider hunting. It was easier than he thought it would be as it&#39;s <br/>
heavily wooded here and he found all types of spiders. He came back <br/>
and got his books and camera and was off again identifying them and <br/>
taking pictures. He bought some back with him but I told him that <br/>
seeing the pictures would be good enough! &lt;g&gt; <br/>

You know me, I have a way with words &lt;not really&gt;. I just wanted to <br/>
know if it was something typical for this age or if it has <br/>
something to do with the fact that we are unschooling and that our <br/>
family has changed. It&#39;s been sort of hard to keep up with him lately <br/>
although it has been very heart warming to see him grow like this.<br/>
I&#39;m having a feeling that he never really wanted to be a vet. I think<br/>
he&#39;s finally wanting to be who he wants to be instead of what WE <br/>
really hoped he be. I hope you know what I&#39;m trying to say.<br/>

<br/>
Good tip. Christopher was wondering how to get rid of the red eye.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some of my best shots of our pets have been when they are not aware<br/>
of me.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s hard for Christopher, he&#39;s not very quiet &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Our geckos are much harder to shoot, but I have a great red light <br/>
and shoot in the middle of the night when they are more active.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Christopher has some wonderful pictures of his geckos. He has one<br/>
that &quot;plays dead&quot; and the picture is so funny. He said he may submit <br/>
it to the most funniest animals or something like that.<br/>
<br/>

now and put in his portfolio right? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The portfolios that I have looked at are mostly for theater or film,<br/>
however here is what I do know.<br/>
<br/>
The presentation of the actual holder is important. If you go to a good<br/>
art store like Aaron Brothers, as against a craft supplier like<br/>
Michaels, you will probably find a selection of very beautiful leather<br/>
bound portfolios with acid free black paper, and often acid free acrylic<br/>
sleeves, possibly with a zip closure - that helps to keep dust out of<br/>
the portfolio. His photos ideally should be 8x10 one to a page. Start<br/>
with the best ones, because sometimes the interviewer will only glance<br/>
at the first few shots. Have a photo to leave with the interviewer, or a<br/>
photo postcard with all information. On the back of the photo include<br/>
contact information and resume info as it increases, or a list of<br/>
satisfied customers and references. It is ok to group photos by type<br/>
with a title page before the photos. Eg: Animal Portraits, Insects,<br/>
Environments, Humor - gosh I don&#39;t know. It is perfectly allowable, in<br/>
fact a good idea, to change the order of your photos depending on who<br/>
you are showing them to. For this reason look at clip ring binders as<br/>
the page fastening, or ease of sliding pages in and out. Sometimes<br/>
people have the kind of folio that converts to a little easel. I don&#39;t<br/>
know which is better. Personally I like getting closer to the image I am<br/>
looking at, but that is just me.<br/>

All these expenses are tax deductible as soon as he starts earning money<br/>
from it, or seeking to earn money from it, as jobsearch expenses. Also<br/>
any special clothing if he going out into the wild, printing expenses,<br/>
software used for creating photos or flyers, a portion of the cost of<br/>
computer hardware, mailing expenses, quite aside from his actual<br/>
photographic equipment. Also tax deductible: chemicals and paper. If he<br/>
ends up with a room set aside as a dark room, a commensurate portion of<br/>
his rent, mortgage, utility bills etc will be deductible.<br/>

We had a foggy morning her a few weeks ago and the spider WEBS were<br/>
absolutely gorgeous.  And you never knew how many there were until the fog<br/>
made them all so silvery!!!  We didn&#39;t realize it until we had already left<br/>
the house and we didn&#39;t have time to go back for the camera.  The kids have<br/>
been waiting for another misty morning so we can take some pictures.<br/>

Usually it is pretty foggy around here being at such high elevation in the <br/>
mountains and we never noticed that. Christopher is ready with camera in hand <br/>
now. Hope your kids get those cool pictures too!<br/>
