Our Winnie the Pooh party was a success.  We went to Wal-mart&#39;s lobby <br/>
to get him presents out of the bubble gum machines.  (Except that we <br/>
got junky toys, not bubble gum! lol)  Pooh liked his presents. :)<br/>
<br/>
Now they have a long list of stuffed animals who are going to be <br/>
having birthdays.  And they looked through old family fun magazines <br/>
that had ideas for cakes--pirate ship, volcano, animals, etc.  Each <br/>
of the stuffed animals has picked out a cake that he wants us to make <br/>
for him. <br/>
