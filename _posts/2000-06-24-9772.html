<div id="ygrps-yiv-443026153">Dia, gee, you put that well!  I wish I&#39;d said that!<br/>
<br/>
We all know of instances where children have been in daycare or other<br/>
second/third/fourth-best care and somehow still thrived.  But daycare is<br/>
a RISK.  (And so obviously is bad parenting...there may be the odd, one<br/>
in hundred, child who&#39;s safer or better off in daycare but that&#39;s<br/>
another issue...)  There are lots of people who drive drunk and don&#39;t<br/>
get in car accidents, but does that mean driving drunk is a good thing<br/>
or appropriate!  I&#39;m not meaning to insult anyone or suggest that<br/>
so-called &quot;working moms&quot; (Isn&#39;t EVERY mother a &quot;working mother&quot;?) are<br/>
equivalent to drunk drivers but I&#39;m trying to illustrate that there is a<br/>
RISK, in most non-parental care situations, and is it worth the gamble<br/>
when not ABSOLUTELY necessary?  Besides, when nothing but the breast<br/>
will console a fussy or pained baby, can any babysitter provide that? <br/>
My neighbour, who is a very pleasant and wonderful woman, runs her own<br/>
in-house daycare.  I see what goes on there in a supposedly &quot;good&quot;<br/>
situation, and she has her share of babies that basically spend the<br/>
whole day crying for their mothers.  It is beyond pitiful to see.  I<br/>
think society grossly underestimates the heroic role mothers play in the<br/>
development of their children.  There are far too many babies suffering<br/>
needlessly.<br/>
<br/>
When we deny mothers and our children, we deny womanhood.<br/>

&lt;&quot;I have a friend that is a single mom of 4 children.  The father of the<br/>
children was a bad choice but one she had made at that point - she has<br/>
also left him.  She is raising these kids alone, father is not even<br/>
involved(by his choice).  He doesn&#39;t pay child support on time, and we<br/>
are talking months at a time of seeing no money support.  She is trying<br/>
the best she can to just get by.<br/>
 <br/>
Would you say she is a bad mother to have to put her kids in a daycare<br/>
so she can work just to pay rent, electric bill, and put food on the<br/>
table, and a few clothes on their backs(at that from Salvation<br/>
Army)?&quot;&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the exception rather than the rule!!!  Of COURSE, situations<br/>
like these, might be handled a little differently and more sensitively! <br/>
I think few would argue that daycare has its place in these rare<br/>
circumstances.  By far though, the families opting for non-parental<br/>
care, are not of such dire circumstances.  <br/>
<br/>
Presently in Canada, the government is considering offering families a<br/>
child care tax credit.  And that is regardless of what choice a family<br/>
makes in terms of child care.  The same dollars that go into daycare<br/>
subsidies could also go to the families with a stay-at-home mom.  In<br/>
most situations those tax dollars could help make the difference for<br/>
having a mom (or dad) at home.  As many have already written, by the<br/>
time you pay for childcare, extra wardrobe, lunches, car, gas etc. to<br/>
hold down a job, you have little left over.  A tax credit, equal to the<br/>
minimal amount most have left over after expenses, would probably be a<br/>
more efficient use of public funds.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a self-perpetuating<br/>
process to trap kids in daycare. <br/>
<br/>
This is an unschooling issue in my mind.  Unschooling, &quot;un-daycare-ing&quot;,<br/>
it&#39;s the same thing.  It&#39;s all about the de-institutionalization of<br/>
children!<br/>

This is the point I was trying to make.... that it&#39;s a choice that&#39;s based on <br/>
the lifestyle parents have chosen prior to have children.  <br/>
<br/>
The whole &quot;sounding like Dr. Laura&quot; thing... Is that suppose to be a <br/>
negative?  It&#39;s interesting that when children&#39;s rights are put below the <br/>
wants and desires of the parents the Dr. Laura card is pulled as if that <br/>
indicates she is &quot;wrong&#39;&quot; in her belief that kids are important.  Now there&#39;s <br/>
judgement if ever I saw it.  (personally I don&#39;t think one way or another of <br/>
Dr. Laura)<br/>

<br/>
I disagree with most of what you say but heartily support your right to raise <br/>
your children whatever way you believe is best.<br/>
<br/>
I just think things are not always as black and white as they might appear <br/>
from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
I am a stay-at-home Mom.  We live from one stack of bills to the next.  <br/>
Pretty typical probably.<br/>
<br/>
But then there are the Moms who, trying to do the very best for their <br/>
children, feel that the family should travel.  It can be done differently <br/>
(these are not my choices, not yours maybe) but their way to do it is to get <br/>
a job that has 2 weeks paid vacation, enough of a salary to save a little, <br/>
health insurance (so hubby can work that job that makes the real $$ but has <br/>
no benefits), etc.  Build your own scenario.  Maybe it&#39;s not travel.  Maybe <br/>
it&#39;s some other long-term goal.  We cannot know what is in everyone&#39;s heart <br/>
when they make these decisions.<br/>
<br/>
This is not the choice I have made.  Not the choice I expect you would make.<br/>
<br/>
But -- are these bad parents?  Is this a bad Mom?  You think so?  I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
America&#39;s a great country!  And feminism is part of the mix that has given us <br/>
all these choices -- as difficult as they may be and as much as we may <br/>
disagree.<br/>

Having a person *choose* to stay at home is a totally different thing than<br/>

some of our cultural constructs that make people have fewer and fewer choices.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do not think that two weeks of travel time is worth 50 weeks of not seeing<br/>
your kids very much, and I don&#39;t think the kids would agree that it is worth<br/>
it either.<br/>
<br/>
Are these bad moms?  How about the dads who agree with the scenario?  I<br/>
guess I&#39;d say they are misguided, confused by what feminism has become, and<br/>
brainwashed by our &quot;me first&quot; society.  Most mothers who work outside the<br/>
home have convinced themselves that 15 minutes of quality time is sufficient<br/>
so that they can pursue their own desires.  And I do have to include the<br/>
dads in this diatribe!  They are just as much at blame for allowing their<br/>
kids to be raised by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
This is not simply *my belief*, my feelings are based on what research has<br/>
shown to be best for kids.  Children do best emotionally when they have a<br/>
secure home with both parents living with them and at least one parent there<br/>
for them full time.  Full time daycare is detrimental to young  children.<br/>
<br/>
And no, I am not on the outside looking in.  I worked full time in a<br/>
pre-school/daycare before I had kids.  It was a wonderful daycare, teachers<br/>
who had been there for years, ones who loved their jobs and the kids they<br/>
worked with.  I loved *my* kids, and have kept in touch with a number of<br/>
them over the years.  As a matter of fact I have two high school graduation<br/>
notices on my fridge right now from two of my former kids! :-)  I also have<br/>
a picture of a little girl from my first pre-school class....with her<br/>
husband and baby!  I must be getting old!  Anyway, I saw the parents and the<br/>
kids, and what the separation did to them.  By 5pm or so the kids were<br/>
tired, the parents were tired, and they still had to go home, fix supper,<br/>
bathe the kids, maybe help an older sibling with homework, do the dishes,<br/>
laundry...the list goes on.  The parents did not have the energy to become<br/>
excited about what went on at daycare that day, whether they wanted to be or<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
We all have choices to make in life, and many will have no impact on anyone<br/>
else, therefore we are free to make whatever choices we want.  Choosing to<br/>
work when there are children involved is not one of those choices.  We can<br/>
go to work at our dream job after the kids are grown, or do it first and<br/>
then have kids, but it is not fair to the children to attempt to do both at<br/>
the same time.  My husband and I chose to have kids first.  Yes, there are<br/>
other things in life I want to accomplish that have nothing to do with<br/>
mothering.  Maybe someday I will.  But, if I leave this earth before I have<br/>
the chance to do all of the other things I would like to do, I leave with<br/>
the assurance that I chose to do that which was most important first.<br/>
Everything else really doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>

fathers? Alot of you seem to be very adamant about mothers not working (and <br/>
I mostly agree with you on the daycare issue, I have always said I didn&#39;t <br/>
bear a child for someone else to raise) but you don&#39;t mention dads. Is it <br/>
any better when dad has to work 45-60 hrs a week and never has any time with <br/>
his children? Maybe daycare is a bad deal, but what about the woman whose <br/>
husband works a different shift so that he is with the kids when she is not? <br/>
Is dad&#39;s care somehow inferior or less important than moms? And I&#39;m sorry, <br/>
but yes some moms do have to work to pay for food and shelter, anyone who <br/>
has been to the grocery store or shopped for a home lately, knows that these <br/>
things aren&#39;t cheap. It&#39;s an awful big load for dad to bear on his own and <br/>
not every man can have a high paying job. Just my $.02.       Trisha<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn&#39;t agree more with this.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you mentioned your neighbor that runs the daycare, it made me think of some former neighbors of ours who ran a daycare. It was really sad, because there were a couple times that I saw her half dozen charges being watched by a very young teenager. Apparently she had to go to the doctor and just had her cousin take over! And they also had a couple dogs which ran around with the kids in the backyard. Well, she would have the kids scoop up all of the dog poop from time to time. I even saw the dogs peeing on the toys outside and never once saw her cleaning them. <br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078908711">i am very thankful that the earlier feminists worked so hard to make it so<br/>
that i could get several degrees before having children and that i can now<br/>
choose to woh *and* sah.  the world isn&#39;t perfect, but the discrimination<br/>
i face is much less than the discrimination my older colleagues faced, and<br/>
people with whom I work also appreciate my choices to work part time, hs,<br/>
put my family first, and bear children late in life.  they may not agree<br/>
with me, but they understand that these are choices i&#39;ve made and support<br/>
me in making them.<br/>
<br/>
Feminism has also given me the right to tell men who are uncomfortable<br/>
with the few square inches of skin that might show when I breastfeed to<br/>
get over it.  It has given me the autonomy to make reproductive decisions<br/>
for myself (hey, I could go get my tubes tied w/o my husband&#39;s consent).<br/>
I can have a credit card in my name and sign a lease or buy property as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
It has given back to me the right to make childbirth choices outside of<br/>
the male-dominated medical model.<br/>
<br/>
It has made it illegal for my husband to rape me.<br/>
<br/>
it has made it possible for gay women to be out and to parent.<br/>
<br/>
It has enabled my sons to play ball on co-ed teams.<br/>
<br/>
It has helped others see that my sons playing with dolls are honing<br/>
parenting skills.<br/>
<br/>
It hasn&#39;t taken away my femininity.  It hasn&#39;t taken away my choices.  It<br/>
can only make me feel like I am &quot;just a mother&quot; if I let *individuals*<br/>
make me feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
And it has given me the voice to say, &quot;Hell no, I&#39;m not a housewife.  I&#39;m<br/>
a mother, a parent, and the one who coordinates the home at this time.<br/>
I&#39;m married to my husband so I&#39;m his wife.  Go ahead, ask him...when he<br/>
gets back from the laundromat with this week&#39;s laundry and cloth diapers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No movement is perfect.  Not all individuals within any movement are<br/>
perfect.  But the feminist movement can only take away from women what<br/>
they relinquish.<br/>

I just wanted to speak up and say that if I said anything during this recent discussion on feminism and SAHM vs. WOHM that may have offended anyone, I apologize! I didn&#39;t realize this discussion would take such a nasty turn. &nbsp;I&#39;m on an ap list where we regularly discuss OT things and we have always managed to be very respectful and open to others. Right now I&#39;m about 200 messages behind, so I don&#39;t know where things stand.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another note, did anyone catch the segment on homeschooling on CBS Sunday Morning? It featured a family in New Hampshire and a group in Virginia. Of course one of the main arguments was that there wasn&#39;t enough interaction with people of different views. Hmm, so in ps every student is allowed to explore a different viewpoint other than what teachers are required to teach? Just curious what others thought.<br>

If you have to work to pay for food and shelter and that&#39;s the primary need <br/>
in the family, you are probably not going to be able to earn that much money, <br/>
which would indicate to me that paying for daycare is going to cut into that <br/>

&lt;&lt; There are some instances where a woman or man is forced to work full time<br/>
  and leave their kids in the care of others, but those instances are rare. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     I don&#39;t understand how this can be seen as rare when about half of all <br/>
marriages end in divorce in the U.S.  Furthermore, with the changes in our <br/>
laws regarding welfare, most people need to transition off welfare in 2 <br/>
years.  <br/>
     I have one aunt who had to leave her husband because he was dangerously <br/>
physically abusive.  She has two kids and has never received normal child <br/>
support from him.  Another aunt was a stay at home mom for all of her <br/>
marriage and has 4 kids.  Her husband got involved with a woman he worked <br/>
with and left her.  She has a very low standard of living now and he was able <br/>
to get custody of two of the kids because of his higher income.  My cousin, <br/>
also a stay at home mom of 4, experienced almost the same thing except that <br/>
her ex-husband pays child support, though not nearly enough to live on.  She <br/>
had to go to work full-time and it was sure as heck not to have a high <br/>
standard of living.<br/>
     I believe intensely in unschooling and being home with babies but not <br/>
everyone can.  I find it depressing and maddening to see a harsh, judgemental <br/>
attitude toward women who work and have kids.  Our society needs to work a <br/>
lot more at having understanding and compassion rather than always falling <br/>
into the us or them mentality.  I believe it&#39;s a form of self-righteousness, <br/>

There are great fathers out there who do support their kids,but there<br/>
are lots of so called fathers who bow out of the picture,and put a very<br/>
large burden on the moms and kids,and society in general...Deb<br/>

Surely the only reason to work for someone else is to get experience so you <br/>
can have your own business???  There will always be a cap on what you earn <br/>
when working for someone else and more importantly the way you structure your <br/>
family life.  When working for other people it&#39;s around their daily office <br/>
schedule, which is usually 8-5.  When you have your own business, it may be <br/>
24 hours a day, but can be done when kids are asleep or hubbie is home to <br/>
take care of them.  It&#39;s much harder than going to work for someone else, <br/>
because you are it, but in the long run my kids learn more about independence <br/>
and working at something you love rather than just to make money.  Just a <br/>
thought IMHO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401632534">So how about raising our daughters to not marry these bums.... This really <br/>
pisses me of because these men didn&#39;t just become this way overnight (well <br/>
the majority of them)... They always had signs of being bum like and we, as <br/>
women, tend to ignore the signs.  We say &quot;oh it&#39;s jus his way, or it will be <br/>
ok when we&#39;ve married&quot; Of course &quot;it&quot; never is and the men turn out to be <br/>
exactly what they showed themselves to be in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s not to say there are some men who appear to be one thing and show you <br/>
that they are wonderful up until you get married and then turn into the other <br/>
man.  However, where&#39;s our women&#39;s intution.  I absolutely believe we know <br/>
when something is wrong in a relationship and we just ignore it and hope it <br/>
will go away.  Then we make kids with this man and are surprised when they do <br/>
up and leave and act exactly the way they showed themselves to be in the <br/>
first place!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So I hope that any of you with girls are raising them with great intuitions <br/>
and to look out for these bums.  I&#39;m raising 2 boys and will teach them to <br/>
respect women and to honor their comittments.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Just another point of view --<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have a tile/marble installation business.  I do the admin <br/>
stuff; he sets the tile.  He also employs his brother and an occassional <br/>
additional setter or helper as needed.  <br/>
<br/>
We are constantly amazed that my husband&#39;s brother does not &quot;get it&quot; - that <br/>
he wants to show up and do X amount of work and go home.  That&#39;s all he <br/>
wants.  He doesn&#39;t want to assume any more of the responsibility and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t get any of the profits.  He gets a wage and that is all he wants. He <br/>
could get a license and start his own tile biz (he actually has much more <br/>
experience than my husband) but we see no sign that this will ever happen.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have both been employees in the course of our work lives and <br/>
we were pretty bad at it.  We are just not the employee type.  Some people <br/>
are just not the boss type.  I&#39;m sure it is very complicated, psychologically <br/>
speaking, but I cannot see that anyone could or should change one set of <br/>
these people to the other type.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are not cut out to be bosses.  You apparently are, but, like so <br/>
many things, this does not mean it will fit everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You also wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So how about raising our daughters to not marry these bums...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of us do try to instill the proper values in our daughters (and <br/>
our sons).  And yet . . . things happen which a mother cannot prevent or <br/>
predict.  Certainly we can try to do our best but that doesn&#39;t mean a perfect <br/>
husband is ready or willing or needed for every girl.<br/>
<br/>
Again, what is working in your life may not apply to others.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me to be very hard to address these issues successfully unless we <br/>
can embrace world views that include others&#39; points of view.  <br/>
<br/>
Actually, this is one of the issues that I find comes up periodically when I <br/>
am with my children.  We discuss many things and I always try to inject some <br/>
sort of perspective into the discussion.  I think it is very easy for them to <br/>
get lost in their own little worlds, and even tho I try not to introduce <br/>
things too early that might upset them, I try to point out that others might <br/>
feel different than they do and that the other person&#39;s pov is valuable too <br/>
and may make sense to them and so it is not kind or correct to criticize <br/>
others simply because they play ball differently or eat different food or <br/>
have a different sort of house or go to church or some such that is different <br/>
from our life.  Children seem to me to have a hard time not being <br/>
self-centered and certain that their way is the best way.  <br/>

&gt; &lt;&quot;I have a friend that is a single mom of 4 children.  The father of the<br/>
&gt; children was a bad choice but one she had made at that point - she has<br/>
&gt; also left him.  She is raising these kids alone, father is not even<br/>
&gt; involved(by his choice).  He doesn&#39;t pay child support on time, and we<br/>
&gt; are talking months at a time of seeing no money support.  She is trying<br/>
&gt; the best she can to just get by.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Would you say she is a bad mother to have to put her kids in a daycare<br/>
&gt; so she can work just to pay rent, electric bill, and put food on the<br/>
&gt; table, and a few clothes on their backs(at that from Salvation<br/>
&gt; Army)?&quot;&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is the exception rather than the rule!!!  Of COURSE, situations<br/>
&gt; like these, might be handled a little differently and more sensitively! <br/>
&gt; I think few would argue that daycare has its place in these rare<br/>
&gt; circumstances.  By far though, the families opting for non-parental<br/>
&gt; care, are not of such dire circumstances.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Presently in Canada, the government is considering offering families a<br/>
&gt; child care tax credit.  And that is regardless of what choice a family<br/>
&gt; makes in terms of child care.  The same dollars that go into daycare<br/>
&gt; subsidies could also go to the families with a stay-at-home mom.  In<br/>
&gt; most situations those tax dollars could help make the difference for<br/>
&gt; having a mom (or dad) at home.  As many have already written, by the<br/>
&gt; time you pay for childcare, extra wardrobe, lunches, car, gas etc. to<br/>
&gt; hold down a job, you have little left over.  A tax credit, equal to the<br/>
&gt; minimal amount most have left over after expenses, would probably be a<br/>
&gt; more efficient use of public funds.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a self-perpetuating<br/>
&gt; process to trap kids in daycare. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is an unschooling issue in my mind.  Unschooling, &quot;un-daycare-ing&quot;,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s the same thing.  It&#39;s all about the de-institutionalization of<br/>
&gt; children!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010289615">My step-mother runs a daycare.  She goes the extra mile and she does it<br/>
because she says it makes her sick to see where some of these babies end<br/>
up.  My dad converted the garage and then added on.  He built everything to<br/>
little people size and each of &quot;Anne&#39;s kids&quot; has their name on their little<br/>
cots and each have a Raggedy Ann or Andy she has made for them.  She only<br/>
hires mothers that bring their own children along with them and is really<br/>
choosey about who she hires and heaven help them if they don&#39;t treat her<br/>
&quot;kids&quot; like they were their own!  But, as I said, it makes her ill that she<br/>
is required to be in this business.  She hates the fact that there aren&#39;t<br/>
extended families to fill the need for parents that absolutely have to<br/>
work.<br/>

I just wish I could clone her so that all those poor babies whose mother<br/>

needs could have a second mother and be in a real home atmosphere!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My older sister does.  She works there, though.  She doesn&#39;t really have much <br/>
of a choice.  Her ex-fiance broke off the engagement and left town.  She <br/>
hasn&#39;t been able to find him since Jacob was born, he&#39;s almost 2.  Her ex&#39;s <br/>
parents are of no help...they think she&#39;s a tramp.  My parents are strapped, <br/>
financially, as is...but help out as much as possible.  Jacob goes to daycare <br/>
for 10 hours a day, 5 days a week...but she&#39;s there.  She&#39;s not in his little <br/>
age group...but she&#39;s there.  I know that&#39;s not the same as what you are <br/>
talking about, but some people just have no one that they can rely on.  As <br/>
sad as that is, our society has come to the point where people are so <br/>
hard-hearted that they won&#39;t even stop to help someone pick up something they <br/>
dropped, much less a single parent struggling to make ends meet.  I find it <br/>
heartbreaking.  When I worked for Dominoes Pizza (before being put on bedrest <br/>
with Briana)...we had this single mother who came in on Fridays.  She would <br/>
count her all her coins and then tell her 2 children that they could afford <br/>
breadsticks. After a week of robbing Peter to pay Paul, all she had was $1.99 <br/>
left over.  I ended up getting fired because I would send her home with 2 <br/>
extra large pizzas, free of charge, and the bread sticks that she insisted on <br/>
paying for.  I didn&#39;t care about losing the job...I know that I was helping.  <br/>
If more people were like that, children wouldn&#39;t be shoved in daycare for <br/>
their entire childhoods.<br/>
