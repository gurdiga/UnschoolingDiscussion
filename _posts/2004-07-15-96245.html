Yes, They actually use the word &quot;whip&quot; and &quot;whipping&quot; as you can see in the <br/>
examples below that are straight out of the book. <br/>

One quick question: Do the Pearls use the word &quot;whipping&quot; in their book? I&#39;ve <br/>
heard of the <br/>
&quot;spanking through&quot; technique of spanking until the child is &quot;broken.&quot; But I <br/>
hadn&#39;t known <br/>
that they actually used the term &quot;whipping.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Examples: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) The Pearls recommend whipping infants only a few months old on their <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; skin. They whip their own 4 month old (p.9). They recommend whipping the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bare <br/>

 </span></blockquote>for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;every transgression&quot; (p.1). Parents who don&#39;t whip their babies into <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) On p.60 they recommend whipping babies who cannot sleep and are crying, <br/>
&gt; and to never allow them &quot;to get up.&quot; On p.61 they recommend whipping a 12 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>month <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; old girl for crying. On p.79 they recommend whipping a 7 month old for <br/>
&gt; screaming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  3) On p.65 co-author Debi Pearl whips the bare leg of a 15 month old she <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; babysitting, 10 separate times, for not playing with something she tells <br/>
 </span></blockquote>him <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to play with. On p.56 Debi Pearl hits a 2 your old so hard &quot;a karate chop <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  4) On p.59 they recommend whipping a 3 year old until he is &quot;totally <br/>
&gt; broken.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5) On p.44 they say not to let the child&#39;s crying while being hit to &quot;cause <br/>
&gt; you to lighten up on the intensity or duration of the spanking.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6) On p.55 the Pearls say a mother should hit her child if he cries for her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  7) On p.80 they recommend giving a child having a tantrum &quot;a swift <br/>
&gt; *forceful* spanking.&quot; On the same page they say to whip small children on <br/>
 </span></blockquote>their bare <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; skin until they stop screaming. &quot;Don&#39;t be bullied. Give him more of the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>same.&quot; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They say to continue whipping until their crying turns into a &quot;wounded, <br/>
&gt; submissive whimper.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 8) On p.46 the Pearls say that if a child does obey before being whipped, <br/>
&gt; whip them anyway. And &quot;if you have to sit on him to spank him,then do not <br/>
&gt; hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bigger, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tougher.&quot; &quot;Defeat him totally.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 9) On p.47 they recommend their various whips, including &quot;a belt or larger <br/>
&gt; tree branch&quot; to hit children. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 10) The Pearls also recommend ignoring an infant&#39;s bumped head when he <br/>
 </span></blockquote>falls <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to the floor, and ignoring skinned knees (p.86). They also say &quot;if your <br/>
 </span></blockquote>child <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is roughed-up by peers, rejoice.&quot; (p.81)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  11) They recommend pulling a nursing infant&#39;s hair (p.7), tripping a <br/>
&gt; non-swimming toddler so she falls into deep water (p.67) and to make <br/>
 </span></blockquote>children go <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hungry if they don&#39;t &quot;like what is on the table&quot; (p.103). Also on p.103 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>they say <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that if children lose their shoes, &quot;let them go without until they (the <br/>
&gt; children) can make the money to buy more.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well... much as I hate this book and everything this author stands for, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m <br/>
pretty grateful that the laws of our country won&#39;t allow the state of <br/>
Tennessee <br/>
or any other government to &quot;have it removed from the hands of our society&quot;. <br/>
Free speech is only really free if it applies to everyone, especially to <br/>
speech <br/>
we hate.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
I thought long and hard about writing it for this reason, but felt that the <br/>
children on the other end of this abuse don&#39;t have a voice to defend their own <br/>
rights. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On the other hand, exposing hateful speech to the light of day as much as <br/>
 </span></blockquote>possible is a good thing, or at least we can hope so, and hope that if any <br/>
news <br/>
organization does decide to pick up on the story they leave homeschooling out <br/>
of it. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
I actually amended the letter after sending it to this group, and after <br/>
reading it a few more times. I added the following statement to the end: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Among these stories are parents who were arrested and had their children <br/>
removed from custody after following the advice from this book, but meanwhile <br/>
this same book is still being sold around the world, allowing advice on how to <br/>
torture innocent children and babies.<br/>
I have sent copies of this same letter to many news organizations including <br/>
20/20 and Primetime Live, and can only hope to shed as much light as possible <br/>
on this book and it&#39;s authors.<br/>
 I would also like to emphasize the fact that this is not a homeschooling <br/>
issue, and would hope that the spotlight would be focused on the abuse of <br/>
children, and not homeschooling. The majority of homeschooling parents is responsible <br/>
and loving, are outraged by this book and it&#39;s teachings, and would like <br/>
nothing more than to see it taken out of publication and recalled from any <br/>
retailer selling it.&quot;<br/>
