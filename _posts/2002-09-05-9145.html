Here is the link for anyone interested in learning the truth about the pledge.<br/>
 <br/>
And here is an excerpt from that site:<br/>
<br/>
In 1891, Upham had the idea of using the celebration of the 400th anniversary <br/>
of Christopher Columbus&#39; discovery of America to promote the use of the flag <br/>
in the public schools. The same year, the magazine hired Daniel Ford&#39;s <br/>
radical young friend, Baptist minister, Nationalist, and Christian Socialist <br/>
leader, Francis Bellamy, to help Upham in his public relations work. Bellamy <br/>
was the first cousin of the famous American socialist, Edward Bellamy. Edward <br/>
Bellamy&#39;s futuristic novel, &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, published in 1888, described <br/>
a utopian Boston in the year 2000. The book spawned an elitist socialist <br/>
movement in Boston known as &quot;Nationalism,&quot; whose members wanted the federal <br/>
government to national most of the American economy. Francis Bellamy was a <br/>
member of this movement and a vice president of its auxiliary group, the <br/>
Society of Christian Socialists 2. He was a baptist minister and he lectured <br/>
and preached on the virtues of socialism and the evils of capitalism. He gave <br/>
a speech on &quot;Jesus the Socialist&quot; and a series of sermons on &quot;The Socialism <br/>
of the Primitive Church.&quot; In 1891, he was forced to resign from his Boston <br/>
church, the Bethany Baptist church, because of his socialist activities. He <br/>
then joined the staff of the Youths&#39; Companion3.<br/>
<br/>
By February 1892, Francis Bellamy and Upham had lined up the National <br/>
Education Association to support the Youths&#39; Companion as a sponsor of the <br/>
national public schools&#39; observance of Columbus Day along with the use of the <br/>
American flag. By June 29, Bellamy and Upham had arranged for Congress and <br/>
President Benjamin Harrison to announce a national proclamation making the <br/>
public school flag ceremony the center of the national Columbus Day <br/>
celebrations for 18924.<br/>
<br/>
Bellamy, under the supervision of Upham, wrote the program for this <br/>
celebration, including its flag salute, the Pledge of Allegiance. His version <br/>
was, <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the Republic for which it stands -- <br/>
one nation indivisible -- with liberty and justice for all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This program and its pledge appeared in the September 8 issue of Youths&#39; <br/>
Companion5. He considered putting the words &quot;fraternity&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; in <br/>
the Pledge but decided they were too radical and controversial for public <br/>
schools6.<br/>
<br/>
The original Pledge was recited while giving a stiff, uplifted right hand <br/>
salute, criticized and discontinued during WWII. The words &quot;my flag&quot; were <br/>
changed to &quot;the flag of the United States of America&quot; because it was feared <br/>
that the children of immigrants might confuse &quot;my flag&quot; for the flag of their <br/>
homeland. The phrase, &quot;Under God,&quot; was added by Congress and President <br/>
Eisenhower in 1954 at the urging of the Knights of Columbus7.<br/>
<br/>
The American Legion&#39;s constitution includes the following goal: &quot;To foster <br/>
and perpetuate a one hundred percent Americanism.&quot; One of its major standing <br/>
committees was the &quot;Americanism Commission&quot; and its subsidiary, the &quot;Counter <br/>
Subversive Activities Committee.&quot; To the fear of immigrants, it added the <br/>
fear of communism8.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years the Legion has worked closely with the NEA and with the U.S. <br/>
Office of Education. The Legion insisted on &quot;one hundred percent&quot; Americanism <br/>
in public school courses in American history, civics, geography and English. <br/>
The Pledge was a part of this Americanism campaign9 and, in 1950, the Legion <br/>
adopted the Pledge as an official part of its own ritual10.<br/>
<br/>
In 1922, the Ku Klux Klan, which also had adopted the &quot;one hundred percent <br/>
Americanism&quot; theme along with the flag ceremonies and the Pledge, became a <br/>
political power in the state of Oregon and arranged for legislation to be <br/>
passes requiring all Catholic children to attend public schools. The U.S. <br/>
Supreme Court later overturned this legislation11.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a team of social scientists and historians could explain why over the <br/>
last century the Pledge of Allegiance has become a major centerpiece in <br/>
American patriotism programs. A pledge or loyalty oath for children was not <br/>
built around the Declaration of Independence -- &quot;We hold these truths to be <br/>
self-evident, that all men are created equal...&quot; Or the Gettysburg address -- <br/>
&quot;a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all <br/>
men are created equal...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, over the last century, Americans have been uncomfortable with the <br/>
word &quot;equality&quot; as a patriotic theme. In 1992 the nation will begin its <br/>
second century with the Pledge of Allegiance. Perhaps the time has come to <br/>
see that this allegiance should be to the U.S. constitution and not to a <br/>
piece of cloth.</div>

I don&#39;t remember the origins of this but we use this for our grace at<br/>
meals:      I pledge allegiance to<br/>
the world, to cherish every living thing, to care for earth and sea and<br/>
air, with peace and freedom<br/>
everywhere.<br/>

Namaste, crisGet<br/>

Ooh, I like that one too, I&#39;ll add it to our wall at home along with all<br/>
