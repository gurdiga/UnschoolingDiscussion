&gt;&gt;Let&#39;s say it&#39;s 4:17 p.m. and you&#39;re driving home, or<br/>
&gt;&gt;cruising....(alone of course) after an unusually hard day <br/>
&gt;&gt;on the job.<br/>
&gt;&gt;All of a sudden, you start experiencing severe pain in <br/>
&gt;&gt;your chest<br/>
&gt;&gt;that starts to radiate out into your arm and up into your <br/>
&gt;&gt;jaw.  You<br/>
&gt;&gt;are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your <br/>
&gt;&gt;home,<br/>
&gt;&gt;unfortunately you don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll be able to make it <br/>
&gt;&gt;that far.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;What can you do?<br/>
&gt;&gt;You&#39;ve been trained in CPR but the guy that taught the <br/>
&gt;&gt;course<br/>
&gt;&gt;neglected to tell you how to perform it on yourself.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE<br/>
&gt;&gt;Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart <br/>
&gt;&gt;attack, this<br/>
&gt;&gt;article seemed in order.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Without help - the person whose heart stops beating <br/>
&gt;&gt;properly and who<br/>
&gt;&gt;begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left <br/>
&gt;&gt;before<br/>
&gt;&gt;losing consciousness.   However, these victims can help <br/>
&gt;&gt;themselves<br/>
&gt;&gt;by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and <br/>
&gt;&gt;the cough<br/>
&gt;&gt;must be deep and prolonged, as when producing <br/>
&gt;&gt;sputum from deep<br/>
&gt;&gt;inside the chest.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;A breath and a cough must be repeated about every <br/>
&gt;&gt;two seconds<br/>
&gt;&gt;without let -up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to<br/>
&gt;&gt;be beating normally again.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing <br/>
&gt;&gt;movements<br/>
&gt;&gt;squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating.  The <br/>
&gt;&gt;squeezing<br/>
&gt;&gt;pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. <br/>
&gt;&gt; In this<br/>
&gt;&gt;way, heart attack victims can get to a phone and, <br/>
&gt;&gt;between breaths, call<br/>
&gt;&gt;for help.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Tell as many other people as possible about this, it <br/>
&gt;&gt;could save their<br/>
&gt;&gt;lives!<br/>
