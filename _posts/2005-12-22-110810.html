<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979703067">I&#39;ve read so many recommendations to eliminate food limits for kids so they can learn to monitor their own intake, but what do parents of children with health concerns do this?  <br/>
 <br/>
How do families who deal with diabetes and spiking blood sugar on a regular basis handle this?  Even 10 cookies is sometimes enough to cause problems, depending on the type of cookie/icing, etc., and the reaction is often fast and unexpected, so the child doesn&#39;t really feel &quot;sick&quot; until about 30 seconds before he falls out, so he doesn&#39;t associate feeling ill with the cookies.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;ELIMINATE LIMITS&quot; is so harsh, like &quot;NO BEDTIMES.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The recommendation is for the parents to really examine their  <br/>
limiting and their scheduling and to realize fully the problems  <br/>
arbitrary  (VERY IMPORTANT, that &quot;arbitrary&quot;) rules and schedules  <br/>
will cause.  Not might cause, but DO cause.<br/>
<br/>
Saying yes one more time, and then yes again, and &quot;okay&quot; and &quot;sure&quot;  <br/>
is way better than once declaring &quot;NO LIMITS,&quot; because that sounds  <br/>
like the parent doesn&#39;t care.  Instead of hundreds of smiling  <br/>
&quot;Okay!&quot;s you get one big &quot;whatever.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Even ten&quot;?<br/>
Not one of my children has ever eaten ten cookies in a row, or even  <br/>
ten on a day.<br/>
<br/>
Are you being hypothetical, or do you really have a child who has or  <br/>
would or longs to eat ten cookies?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t have cookies with icing, if that&#39;s going to be a problem.  We  <br/>
don&#39;t even frost cakes here, usually.  Just the cake might be made,  <br/>
and people will eat it with ice cream, or eat it as they might fruit  <br/>
bread.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to say yes.  If you&#39;re at a party and there are  <br/>
frosted Christmas cookies, you could say &quot;yes&quot; up to the limit that  <br/>
it seemed like more than the kid&#39;s share, or past courtesy, and then  <br/>
explain that taking too many isn&#39;t polite; or if there ARE lots,  <br/>
maybe say &quot;Let&#39;s take one home for later.&quot;  That&#39;s another &quot;yes&quot;:   <br/>
later.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m confident that the reason my children don&#39;t scarf cookies is that  <br/>
they&#39;re just available things, not big-deal things.  I made chocolate  <br/>
chip cookies a couple of days ago.  When they were hot, other teens  <br/>
came and ate some.  An adult visitor came by and was given some to  <br/>
take home.  There are two dozen in a clear plastic container, still  <br/>
there.   It&#39;s not that they&#39;re not good, either. &lt;g&gt;  I ground the  <br/>
pecans up because Marty and Holly have braces, but Holly doesn&#39;t like  <br/>
the cookies without pecans.<br/>
<br/>
If I counted and limited, they&#39;d probably all be gone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Related story from this past weekend. On Sunday, the preacher&#39;s wife <br/>
had her traditional basket o&#39; goodies there - she makes up little <br/>
packets of Hershey&#39;s kisses, maybe a candy cane, other holiday type <br/>
treats and sets them in a basket near the door for each person to <br/>
take a packet. Nice holiday thing. DS got his little packet, I had <br/>
one, DH had one, many other people had one. A friend went to get one <br/>
for herself and found two boys (similar ages to DS) contemplating <br/>
how to grab as many as would fit in their pockets. She came back <br/>
from that encounter and, casual jokingly (DS has known her since he <br/>
was about 18 months old) she asked DS for one of his candies. He <br/>
loked in his packet and pulled out a Kiss and handed it to her and <br/>
roamed off to munch the rest of his packet. No fuss no muss. She <br/>
commented on the contrast between the two who were trying to get as <br/>
much as they could carry and DS who handed over a piece of candy <br/>
without a whinge (and no requirement to either - he could have said <br/>
No if he chose). I said Well, he knows that if he wants more Kisses, <br/>
and we&#39;ve got the funds in the budget, he can have as many more as <br/>
he wants. No feeling of lack, giving out of a life of abundance <br/>
instead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Buy or make sugar-free/low carb cookies? My mom is diabetic, and so <br/>
we try to be careful about the amount of carbs and sugary stuff she <br/>
eats, but she still gets &quot;sweet&quot; stuff. We always have sugar-free <br/>
cookies on hand, which my son loves. You can bake your own with <br/>
Splenda too. How old is this child? If he is very young, and has a <br/>
medical problem, i wouldnt have loads of stuff he can&#39;t eat in the <br/>
house. If he is older, i would think communicating the issue with <br/>
him, explaining what is going on in his body, would help him make an <br/>
informed decision about what to eat. But still, in the end, it IS <br/>
his decision to make isnt it? You can&#39;t follow him his whole life <br/>
making sure he doesnt eat too many cookies.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my mom is diabetic (type 2 i think? She takes <br/>
pills)...she still eats things that arent so great for her <br/>
occasionally, because the happiness it brings to her (like eating <br/>
fruitcake during the holidays, or cake on someone&#39;s birthday)is more <br/>
important than if her blood sugar goes up a few points. <br/>
<br/>
But truly, if someone is a diabetic, there is low-sugar and low-carb <br/>
options with just about any food.<br/>
