<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314766944">I was listening to Soundprint on NPR (National Public Radio) over the<br/>
weekend.  They did a cool segment on a lego-based learning program for<br/>
students in jail.  They also segued into the next segment with a little<br/>
tidbit about Edison&#39;s mother taking him out of school.<br/>
<br/>
The promo indicates that next week they will be discussing homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the jail education segment and the brief bit about Edison both<br/>
sounded like the commentator was doing a good job thinking &quot;outside the<br/>
box&quot; about education.  Really, it was refreshing to hear someone who<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to be falling into the rut of thinking standards, seatwork<br/>
and testing are the way to promote learning.<br/>

station&#39;s website maybe?<br/>

Yeah, that is a problem.  The San Francisco station has it on Sunday<br/>
afternoons at 2, or 4 or something.  Unless you&#39;ve got a powerful<br/>
receiver, you&#39;ll be getting it on a different station, and some of them<br/>
may not even do it on the same day.<br/>

Sorry I don&#39;t know more, <br/>
