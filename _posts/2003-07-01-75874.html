&gt; &gt;around.  Hand-holding gets boring really fast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And that&#39;s why we have more lists now: Because some people still need <br/>
&gt; their hands held, and don&#39;t need people just impatiently telling them <br/>
&gt; to &quot;grow up.&quot; Something for everyone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sigh... I sent Helen an individual note, talking about what I believe was her <br/>
very inappropriate behavior regarding Sandra on this list. I sent it directly <br/>
because I wanted to model a perhaps more appropriate way to handle a conflict <br/>
than skewering someone on a large list, out of the blue. Helen, you obviously <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
I HAVE seen Sandra tell people to grow up. I have never seen her do that with <br/>
someone who was genuinely trying to learn and understand what unschooling and <br/>
trusting their children were all about, even if they were slow or making LOTS <br/>
of mistakes. It&#39;s always been in the context of someone so intent on proving <br/>
they&#39;re right that they disrupt the list. <br/>
<br/>
This is not to say that Sandra, or any of us, is perfect. <br/>
<br/>
And maybe there is a need for more lists. If so, they&#39;ll be successful. If <br/>
not, they&#39;ll disappear. No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
But, Helen, I think you have something else going on with Sandra, and you&#39;re <br/>
taking your stuff out on her (and frankly, the rest of us).  Your comments are <br/>
getting more and more nasty, cutting, and divisive. For the life of me, I <br/>
can&#39;t figure out why. I don&#39;t know if it matters. But I expected better from you.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn, who believes we should be kind to one another, gentle when we can <br/>
be, and deal directly with conflict when it arises<br/>
