<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683832943">This is my situation also.  My dh has many concerns about our<br/>
children&#39;s education, most of which we don&#39;t talk about much, without<br/>
distress on both our parts.  We are not the great communicators that<br/>
so many unschooling parents seem to be on these lists.  In fact, my dh<br/>
would move us to another state if his job necessitated it, so he says.<br/>
 He would buy a new or new-used car if he wanted to, and while he<br/>
might like for me to appreciate it, it is his deal, not mine. However<br/>
if I thought we needed one, he wouldn&#39;t buy one. (Both our cars are 15<br/>
years old, and running pretty well because of the endless amount of<br/>
maintenance he does on them)  I homeschooled the curriculum way for<br/>
ten years, with sorry results.  Coming back to unschooling has been<br/>
happening since January &#39;05...too soon for dh to see any great<br/>
results. (I&#39;m not sure if anything impresses him except for doing well<br/>
on standardized tests, ACT, SAT, etc. and so far the kids do well on<br/>
them until 6th grade, when they start falling behind, until the ACT<br/>
comes and then they are in the bottom 5%) He wasn&#39;t impressed with how<br/>
our kids have done in our old way of homeschooling, but since that was<br/>
closest to what he thought of as &quot;school&quot;, he accepted it. If this<br/>
sounds really depressing, sorry.  He is pretty hard on them, hard on<br/>
me, and hard on himself. I personally feel badly for my oldest, who is<br/>
now trying to get into the Coast Guard, and will soon be taking the<br/>
military&#39;s test that determines where one can be placed, or accepted<br/>
at all (the CG has the strictest admittance requirements for<br/>
enlistees)...he seems to have no idea how to study for it, or for<br/>
anything.  None or almost none of the math he struggled through in<br/>
home high school stuck, to his dismay, and his dad&#39;s almost dispair. I<br/>
put in my bits of &quot;It (algebra) doesn&#39;t matter as much as you think&quot;,<br/>
which he doesn&#39;t believe.  He (dh) believes you have to go along with<br/>
what &quot;they&quot; say is required, in order to get along in life.  I used to<br/>
believe that, but I don&#39;t anymore.  I think that doing what one loves<br/>
to do, and what brings one joy is what will make one happy &<br/>
successful, and one&#39;s corner of the world a better place. Dh thinks<br/>
that&#39;s unrealistic.  So, as you all in unschooling land can see, dh &<br/>
I have a lot to work on, and mean while, I want to let our children be<br/>
free to learn what they want, when they want.  I&#39;ve tried &quot;making&quot;<br/>
them learn stuff - it&#39;s what I did for years!  They, surprise, have<br/>
forgotten almost all of it! Sorry if I went on and on and all over the<br/>
place as well.</div>

Maybe hit his site for some answers. I was VERY impressed with his talk at the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference last weekend!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92847929">Amy, you have no idea how much your email helped me this morning.  <br/>
It&#39;s nice to know that I&#39;m not alone here.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is my situation also.  My dh has many concerns about our<br/>
children&#39;s education, most of which we don&#39;t talk about much, <br/>
without distress on both our parts.  We are not the great <br/>
communicators that so many unschooling parents seem to be on these <br/>
lists. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
My hubby read and said that he understands the benefits of <br/>
unschooling, however, I already see his problems.  He never reads <br/>
anything about it though, whereas I&#39;ve been studying philosophies of <br/>
HS for 3 years.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He is pretty hard on them, hard on<br/>
me, and hard on himself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mine is hard also in certain areas.  Like cleaning, tv/video games.  <br/>
Yesterday we went bowling and after one game ds asked if he could <br/>
play arcade games.  My husband about came unglued (sarcastic, loud <br/>
voice)..&quot;Why?  Why do you want to play video games?  It&#39;s all you do <br/>
at home and now you want to play video games here too?  No, I don&#39;t <br/>
get it, we&#39;re bowling.&quot;  DH was very stern and his anger was <br/>
apparent to the kids and I, ds and dd both got tear filled eyes.  <br/>
Yes, my husband overreacted.  I got things calmed down but the words <br/>
and attitude couldn&#39;t be taken back.  DS just sat out the next game <br/>
(he wanted to).  Things had eased back before we left.<br/>
<br/>
We play and laugh together and the kids have a ball with DH and most <br/>
of the time, it&#39;s a very peaceful and happy home.  However, there <br/>
are certain things that set DH off and my son with tv/video games <br/>
has been a huge issue in this house for years.  DS hardly ever plays <br/>
outdoors and when you take him somewhere, even a short walk damn <br/>
near does him in.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing Amy and I didn&#39;t find what you had to say <br/>
depressing either, not every family is the same...no matter what <br/>
their lifestyle is.<br/>

<br/>
reminded me of something else I had read recently. I know this group is <br/>
not really big on &quot;God&quot;, but I just read a column from a rabbi that <br/>
addresses much of this. He has reprinted a sermon he gave about doing <br/>
what you love; doing what God made you good at. He says some really wise <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
I know Amy is looking at compromising with her husband in a lot of <br/>
different areas surrounding unschooling, but I thought some of the words <br/>
in the article might make it more possible for her and her children to <br/>
have something else to hold on to while her husband makes his way.<br/>
<br/>
Like La Leche League, take what works for you and leave the rest behind. <br/>
He is not (and neither am I) trying to convert anyone to Judaism, just <br/>
talk about the importance of not betraying yourself by only looking at <br/>
your job or whatever as your life. Feel free to replace &quot;God&quot; with &quot;the <br/>
Universe&quot; or &quot;your inner child&quot; or whatever your personal theology is. I <br/>
suspect even atheists could glean much from this article. The last few <br/>
paragraphs get a little &quot;church-y&quot; (&quot;synagogue-y&quot;, I guess), but you can <br/>
skip those.<br/>
<br/>
The first paragraph reads, &quot;Oct. 12, 2005 - On Rosh Hashana, I preached <br/>
about the first secret of life which is also the most frequent <br/>
commandment in both the Hebrew Bible and New Testaments: “Be not <br/>
afraid.” This week, my Yom Kippur sermon is about another secret of <br/>
life: “Do what you love.” This is some of what I said. To know the rest <br/>
you had to be sleeping next to my congregants …&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, Rabbi Gellman has a sense of humor, and a sense of how <br/>
to make life worth living. If you are interested, you can read the rest <br/>
here:<br/>

Hope this helps, and does not offend.<br/>

<br/>
Jackie has not yet found much joy in taking walks.  Can&#39;t even get around the block without complaining that her legs hurt, too tired, etc.<br/>
<br/>
However, when we have gone on hikes she is usually the one leading the way and rarely says anything about being tired.  She just got a bigger bike and has been riding all over the neighborhood.  Can&#39;t seem to get enough.  She also enjoys scootering.<br/>
<br/>
It might be that your child hasn&#39;t found an outdoor activitiy that he enjoys, not that he is pathetically out of shape.<br/>
