<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I used to worry so much about too much tv, 
computer, etc.&nbsp;It was really an internal struggle for me.&nbsp; Then I just 
realised that my son is really advanced and he doesn&#39;t even watch that much tv, 
computer, etc.&nbsp; I just was afraid he would.&nbsp; So I gave it up.&nbsp; 
Now he rarely watches tv and as for the computer, I like to get him some more 
advanced CD-Roms so he&#39;ll play MORE.&nbsp; What you resist persists.&nbsp; Just 
don&#39;t worry about it.&nbsp; Our kids are gonna turn out great.&nbsp; BTW, if 
anyone knows of any really great CDs I&#39;d love to hear about them. -

 </span></blockquote>For the record, the Bible says &quot;Train up a child in the way he <br/>
should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The phrase &quot;in the way he should go&quot; literally means &quot;according to <br/>
his own way.&quot;  It refers to training the child according to his own <br/>
individual needs or design.  It does NOT mean we have to control <br/>
everything they do.  Children learn best, and the learning is most <br/>
permanent, when children come to conclusions on their own based <br/>
upon their own experience.  Sometimes that means we have to let <br/>
them do it wrong and make mistakes.  It doesn&#39;t mean we need to <br/>
control them either.  Jesus never controlled anybody.  He loved and <br/>
encouraged people, and allowed them to make their own choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018094953"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Also, I have this bias that sci-fi is trash. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We watch Star Trek Voyager nearly every day, and I have come to the<br/>
opposite conclusion.  Sci-fi is a very powerful dramatic device for<br/>
creating situations that illuminate ethical issues.  (This does not<br/>
necessarily apply to Star Wars spin-off books.)<br/>
<br/>
Most of the adults I know who read a lot read plenty of genre junk.  (Or<br/>
genre good stuff.)  I don&#39;t know any who only read classic literature.  My<br/>
brother reads a lot of sci-fi, my mom perpetually reads mysteries, and I<br/>
confess to sometimes reading steamy historical romance novels.)<br/>
<br/>
(For the record: I also eat potato chips.)<br/>

<br/>
P.S. (Anyone want to recommend some good sci-fi to me?  I&#39;ve finished<br/>
reading all of Lois McMasters Bujold&#39;s books, and I&#39;m going through<br/>
withdrawal.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651997251">Hello! My name&#39;s Juli and I&#39;m homeschooling my ds, 10<br/>

playing Smiloid, a silly game of splashing smiley<br/>
faces with paint. Now, I tell myself it&#39;s ok, they&#39;re<br/>
playing that together, it requires cooperation, etc.<br/>
But part of me feels like it&#39;s wasting time. I *know*<br/>
that unschooling is about everything being learning,<br/>
nothing is a waste of time. But the kids are on the<br/>

<div><font face="Pooh">You aren&#39;t being a control freak. Our job is to train up 
our children in the way that they should go..even in the small things. The bible 
is very clear on this. I don&#39;t know if you are a christian family or not, but in 
either case your concerns are valid because they are born of your love for your 
children. My daughter is indeed obsessive about the television. I am the same 
way about the computer. We made a deal to limit our television and computer 
times down to an hour each day with allowances for special times or special 
programs. You can sit down with the kids and make an agreement that they can do 
maybe an hour on pharoah and maybe half an hour on smileys or whatever that one 
is. Do the same thing with the books. Say he can read his Star Wars book for a 
couple hours if he also reads a nature book, or some other book for twice the 
amount of time he reads the star wars books. You can also have him build models 
of the ships, write his own sci-fi play, etc instead of just reading alone. I am 
having the same problem with the Harry Potter books. She can read it, provided 
she also reads some other books from the library as well. WE also add bible 
reading and prayer time to our day.</font></div>

You aren&#39;t being a control freak. Our job is to train up our children in the way<br/>
that they should go..even in the small things. The bible is very clear on this.<br/>
<br/>
*******<br/>
Actually,  she IS sliding into  the control freak range.   If you wish to argue<br/>
that being very controlling is a positive attribute or  a duty,  then do so.<br/>
But it is not honest to deny that  authoritarian control  (&quot;control freak&quot;)<br/>
status is being sought.<br/>
<br/>
In other words,  argue that being a control freak is a good thing; don&#39;t accept<br/>
that it is negative but deny that folks are experiencing it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944633851">Hi Julie!  Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hello! My name&#39;s Juli and I&#39;m homeschooling my ds, 10<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a wonderful journey. It sometimes takes a whole year to find<br/>
the rhythm and stride that will work for your family, and even then it<br/>
changes as the children grow and mature.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1. I&#39;m wondering if anyone limits computer time? My<br/>
&gt; kids love the computer, and are on it all the time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t limit them here.    We are a housefull of geeks and wannabe geeks<br/>
though. ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feel ok when I see them playing Pharoah (a game about<br/>
&gt; ancient Egypt) but they&#39;re also spending a lot of time<br/>

&gt; But part of me feels like it&#39;s wasting time. I *know*<br/>
&gt; that unschooling is about everything being learning,<br/>
&gt; nothing is a waste of time. But the kids are on the<br/>
&gt; computer for hours a day. So I wonder if anyone else<br/>
&gt; has encountered this situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As one who has her computer on from the time I wake up until the time I go<br/>
to bed, maybe I&#39;m not the one to ask.  :)  But we seem to go through spurts<br/>
here. Play a great deal, than outside beckons. We went through a board and<br/>
card game phase during the winter.  I became very tired of playing Payday<br/>
and Risk  Chess and Risk are still the games they play with Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Are they refusing to go outside? Are the games interferring with any other<br/>
part of their lives?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. My son is a very advanced reader, but since our<br/>
&gt; unschooling started, all he reads is Star Wars books.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re adult sci-fi, and I worry a little about there<br/>
&gt; being &quot;scary&quot; stuff in there, though he&#39;s VERY<br/>
&gt; sensitive and would stop reading if he did get<br/>
&gt; scared.Also, I have this bias that sci-fi is trash. :)<br/>
&gt; I have no intention of censoring his reading, because<br/>
&gt; I believe it&#39;s for him to find what he&#39;s comfortable<br/>
&gt; with.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you consider Sci-Fi trash?  Can you pinpoint why you came to believe<br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not understanding the worry over the scary parts, if you know he would<br/>
stop as soon as something began to bother him?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess my 2 questions are the same: I understand<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re guides and are to put interesting things in<br/>
&gt; their path, but what about taking things out of their<br/>
&gt; paths?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm....There are things that I have not brought to their attention at<br/>
certain times.  I don&#39;t feel the need to discuss certain topics with my<br/>
young ones yet. So, I guess I do agree that by the nature of parenthood I<br/>
keep some issues out of their path until later, or they find them on their<br/>
own.  If my child was spending 13 hours a day on the computer, or 13 hours a<br/>
day reading or 13 hours a day doing just any one thing I would feel the<br/>
desire to broaden their horizons.  I&#39;m not sure I would feel the same if<br/>
they were doing 13 hours of housework/yard work every day, but since that<br/>
isn&#39;t likely to happen I don&#39;t worry about that one either.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone LIMIT things like computers, sci-fi<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; books, videos? We don&#39;t have TV at all, never have, so<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s not a problem. But what about other stuff?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hmm, even writing this I feel like I have my answer.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m being a control freak. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what these lists and message boards are best at, showing ourselves to<br/>
ourselves. ;)  The next thing to do is examine why you want to control these<br/>
things.  Limits and control are not dirty words, but parents have to be very<br/>
careful and completely aware of why they are doing what they are doing.<br/>
Moving into the freak area is not good. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Welcome to the list.<br/>
<br/>
*I* think my dd spends too much time watching TV.  MY dd and dh think <br/>
I spend too much time on the computer.............  *I* am sure i <br/>
dont spend too much time on the computer!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am not a controll freak - just the opposite.  I have tried to bring <br/>
all my kids up to be independant and to think for themselves.  This <br/>
includes how much time they spend watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
This doesnt mean I dont freek out when my dd sits and watches Tv for <br/>
a whole week - I do, and I come here and complain about it.  However, <br/>
more than often, she finds some thing more constructive to do the <br/>
next week.<br/>
<br/>
As for reading. Does it really matter what a child reads (within <br/>
reason of course)as long as they read..... My 30yr old son, and my <br/>
husband, do not read.  I have never seen either read a novel.  Both <br/>
CAN read, but only read if they need to know something.  Both own <br/>
their own small businesses.<br/>
<br/>
We all have our own opinion on TV and Computer usage.  So I think you <br/>
have to do what you are comforable with.<br/>

&gt; limit our television and computer times down to an hour each day with<br/>
&gt; allowances for special times or special programs. You can sit down<br/>
&gt; with the kids and make an agreement that they can do maybe an hour on<br/>
&gt; pharoah and maybe half an hour on smileys or whatever that one is. Do<br/>
&gt; the same thing with the books. Say he can read his Star Wars book for<br/>
&gt; a couple hours if he also reads a nature book, or some other book for<br/>
&gt; twice the amount of time he reads the star wars books. You can also<br/>
&gt; have him build models of the ships, write his own sci-fi play, etc<br/>
&gt; instead of just reading alone. I am having the same problem with the<br/>
&gt; Harry Potter books. She can read it, provided she also reads some<br/>
&gt; other books from the library as well. WE also add bible reading and<br/>
&gt; prayer time to our day. Jessica<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, but this really isn&#39;t unschooling.  What&#39;s the point of <br/>
saying they can follow their interests and trusting them to know <br/>
what they want (which for me is the whole point, what they learn is <br/>
far less important than that they enjoy it, and know themselves <br/>
from it) if then you go about controlling their access to those things <br/>
they want to do?  Why mess about with someone&#39;s love of and joy <br/>
in reading by telling them they have to read something they don&#39;t <br/>
want to?  Not my idea of unschooling. <br/>

PS  Some Sci-fi books are trash, but that&#39;s the fun!  And some are <br/>
great literature, Lord of the Rings was voted the UK&#39;s no1 20thC <br/>
book last year, and thousands of people voted.  I got belittled in <br/>
school for reading fantasy novels (David Eddings and Anne <br/>
McCaffrey) cos the others thought they were rubbish.  I never found <br/>
Sweet Valley High all that challenging or appealing, but I didn&#39;t say <br/>
so...</div>

<br/>
This kind of mutual discussion is an amazing thing. This takes us out of the<br/>
realm of I know best and you have to do what I say, irrespective of what you<br/>
see me doing. I think it only works well though, we all parties agree there<br/>
is a problem in the first place.  Of my 4 children only one could be<br/>
considered having a problem with screens (TV, computer, video games) and for<br/>
him, the screens aren&#39;t a problem, they are what serve him best right now.<br/>
Now..... the children could legitmately say *I* have a computer problem,<br/>
since it appears my cooking is impaired by being here. What they do not<br/>
understand is my ability to cook is impared no matter what. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;. You can also have him build models of the ships, write his own sci-fi<br/>
play, etc instead of just reading alone.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have trouble with the phrase *you can have him* and it may just be a case<br/>
of semantics.  If I tried to have my chidlren build models of ships, they<br/>
would run far, far away. &lt;G&gt;  I help extend their interests though, both by<br/>
bringing all kinds of things home and taking them all kinds of places.<br/>
Sometimes these phases for things like Sci-Fi are just like those todder and<br/>
young child phases, you don&#39;t really know what they are leading up to until<br/>
they jump the chasm and tell you all about it. Then your jaw drops to the<br/>
floor and you wondered what you were worrying about.<br/>

MY dh was very much into sci fi books when he was a kid and I don&#39;t see
us limiting that when the kids are able to read and comprehend them.&nbsp;
It sounds like your son really enjoys them and the fact that he is enjoying

<br><tt>has encountered this situation.</tt>
<p><tt>2. My son is a very advanced reader, but since our</tt>
<br><tt>unschooling started, all he reads is Star Wars books.</tt>
<br><tt>They&#39;re adult sci-fi, and I worry a little about there</tt>
<br><tt>being &quot;scary&quot; stuff in there, though he&#39;s VERY</tt>
<br><tt>sensitive and would stop reading if he did get</tt>
<br><tt>scared.Also, I have this bias that sci-fi is trash. :)</tt>
<br><tt>I have no intention of censoring his reading, because</tt>
<br><tt>I believe it&#39;s for him to find what he&#39;s comfortable</tt>
<br><tt>with.</tt>
<p><tt>I guess my 2 questions are the same: I understand</tt>
<br><tt>we&#39;re guides and are to put interesting things in</tt>
<br><tt>their path, but what about taking things out of their</tt>
<br><tt>paths? Does anyone LIMIT things like computers, sci-fi</tt>
<br><tt>books, videos? We don&#39;t have TV at all, never have, so</tt>
<br><tt>that&#39;s not a problem. But what about other stuff?</tt>
<p><tt>Hmm, even writing this I feel like I have my answer.</tt>
<br><tt>I&#39;m being a control freak. :)</tt>

      they choose are age appropriate for them, perhaps that is too much control 
      on my part, but it makes us feel more comfortable about that.&nbsp; MY dh 
      was very much into sci fi books when he was a kid and I don&#39;t see us 
      limiting that when the kids are able to read and comprehend them.&nbsp; It 
      sounds like your son really enjoys them and the fact that he is enjoying 
      reading is wonderful, banning those particular books may make him lose his 
      joy in reading which would be much worse then him reading some trash

        and I&#39;m homeschooling my ds, 10</tt> <br><tt>and dd, 8. We&#39;ve been 
        homeschooling for a year and a</tt> <br><tt>half, since I took them out 
        of public school. We</tt> <br><tt>decided a couple weeks ago to try 
        unschooling, after</tt> <br><tt>reading a lot about it. I have a couple 
        questions:</tt> 
        <p><tt>1. I&#39;m wondering if anyone limits computer time? My</tt> 
        <br><tt>kids love the computer, and are on it all the time. I</tt> 
        <br><tt>feel ok when I see them playing Pharoah (a game about</tt> 
        <br><tt>ancient Egypt) but they&#39;re also spending a lot of time</tt> 
        <br><tt>playing Smiloid, a silly game of splashing smiley</tt> 
        <br><tt>faces with paint. Now, I tell myself it&#39;s ok, they&#39;re</tt> 
        <br><tt>playing that together, it requires cooperation, etc.</tt> 
        <br><tt>But part of me feels like it&#39;s wasting time. I *know*</tt> 
        <br><tt>that unschooling is about everything being learning,</tt> 
        <br><tt>nothing is a waste of time. But the kids are on the</tt> 
        <br><tt>computer for hours a day. So I wonder if anyone else</tt> 
        <br><tt>has encountered this situation.</tt> 
        <p><tt>2. My son is a very advanced reader, but since our</tt> 
        <br><tt>unschooling started, all he reads is Star Wars books.</tt> 
        <br><tt>They&#39;re adult sci-fi, and I worry a little about there</tt> 
        <br><tt>being &quot;scary&quot; stuff in there, though he&#39;s VERY</tt>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766131484">Hi Juli,<br/>
<br/>
And welcome!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not being a control freak if you can question your actions! You&#39;ll no <br/>
doubt have responses from both &#39;camps&#39; here about limit/no limit and what you <br/>
said yourself about all situations being opportunity for education is true.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember, whatever you and your children decide, if they&#39;re reading <br/>
they&#39;re reading, if they&#39;re operating equipment, they&#39;re operating equipment, <br/>
if they&#39;re playing, they&#39;re playing. They are learning from all these <br/>
scenarios whatever they are reading/operating/playing. You may decide you <br/>
don&#39;t want to limit time on certain activities, but content. Maybe you would <br/>
feel uncomfortable with your children reading porn for example. (Actually, as <br/>
an aside, does one &#39;read&#39; porn?!) <br/>
<br/>
Good luck anyway!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144205802">P.S. (Anyone want to recommend some good sci-fi to me? <br/>
I&#39;ve finished<br/>
reading all of Lois McMasters Bujold&#39;s books, and I&#39;m <br/>
going through<br/>
withdrawal.)<br/>
<br/>
Never read any of hers, but for &#39;froth&#39; I like the <br/>
David Eddings and Anne McCaffrey books I mentioned <br/>
earlier (The &#39;Garion&#39; ones are more &#39;frothy&#39; than the <br/>
&#39;Sparhawk&#39; ones) or for mind-blowingly complex and <br/>
wierd literature, Iain M Banks (he does &#39;straight&#39; work <br/>
as Iain Banks, which are supposedly more wierd than the <br/>
sci-fi...) is utterly amazing!  Oh, and if you want to <br/>
be clued-up before the first film is released in <br/>
December (possibly earlier over there...) then you <br/>
cuold always read the Lord of the Rings books, and The <br/>
Hobbit :-)<br/>
<br/>
I also read trashy spy novels :-)<br/>

    <div><br></div><tt>&gt; Juli,<br>&gt; You aren&#39;t being a control freak. Our 
    job is to train up our children<br>&gt; in the way that they should go..even 
    in the small things. The bible is<br>&gt; very clear on this. I don&#39;t know 
    if you are a christian family or not,<br>&gt; but in either case your 
    concerns are valid because they are born of<br>&gt; your love for your 
    children. My daughter is indeed obsessive about the<br>&gt; television. I am 
    the same way about the computer. We made a deal to<br>&gt; limit our 
    television and computer times down to an hour each day with<br>&gt; 
    allowances for special times or special programs. You can sit down<br>&gt; 
    with the kids and make an agreement that they can do maybe an hour 
    on<br>&gt; pharoah and maybe half an hour on smileys or whatever that one 
    is. Do<br>&gt; the same thing with the books. Say he can read his Star Wars 
    book for<br>&gt; a couple hours if he also reads a nature book, or some 
    other book for<br>&gt; twice the amount of time he reads the star wars 
    books. You can also<br>&gt; have him build models of the ships, write his 
    own sci-fi play, etc<br>&gt; instead of just reading alone. I am having the 
    same problem with the<br>&gt; Harry Potter books. She can read it, provided 
    she also reads some<br>&gt; other books from the library as well. WE also 
    add bible reading and<br>&gt; prayer time to our day. Jessica<br>&gt;

    <br><br>I&#39;m sorry, but this really isn&#39;t unschooling.&nbsp; What&#39;s the point 
    of <br>saying they can follow their interests and trusting them to know 
    <br>what they want (which for me is the whole point, what they learn is 
    <br>far less important than that they enjoy it, and know themselves <br>from 
    it) if then you go about controlling their access to those things <br>they 
    want to do?&nbsp; Why mess about with someone&#39;s love of and joy <br>in 
    reading by telling them they have to read something they don&#39;t <br>want 
    to?&nbsp; Not my idea of unschooling. <br><br>Tracy<br>PS&nbsp; Some Sci-fi 
    books are trash, but that&#39;s the fun!&nbsp; And some are <br>great 
    literature, Lord of the Rings was voted the UK&#39;s no1 20thC <br>book last 
    year, and thousands of people voted.&nbsp; I got belittled in <br>school for 
    reading fantasy novels (David Eddings and Anne <br>McCaffrey) cos the others 
    thought they were rubbish.&nbsp; I never found <br>Sweet Valley High all 
    that challenging or appealing, but I didn&#39;t say 
    <br>so...<br></tt><br><br><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a free

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Most of the games we have for computer are 
&quot;educational&quot; in one way or the other, but sometimes we all need down time. I, 
as an adult have been known to play solitare or other games when the task I am 
working on gets frustrating. After a while I can go back to the task and often 
see things differently. If you feel they are really in front of the computer too 
much, suggest someting else that might interest them. Sometimes we need 
ideas&nbsp;too. As for the science fiction, go easy on him. He is reading and 
that&nbsp;will only improve his reading ability. Science fiction books can also 
have deep thought built in. I remember reading Farenheit 451 when I was around 
twelve and saw the damage&nbsp;blind obedience and not questioning&nbsp;or 
standing up for what is right can do.&nbsp;Many science fiction books show 
different groups of people working together for a common goal. Good concepts 
both.  remember we all learn in different ways. Guide gently</font></div>

  list: Hi!</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>Hello! My name&#39;s Juli and I&#39;m homeschooling my ds, 
  10<br>and dd, 8. We&#39;ve been homeschooling for a year and a<br>half, since I 
  took them out of public school. We<br>decided a couple weeks ago to try 
  unschooling, after<br>reading a lot about it. I have a couple 
  questions:<br><br>1. I&#39;m wondering if anyone limits computer time? My<br>kids 
  love the computer, and are on it all the time. I<br>feel ok when I see them 
  playing Pharoah (a game about<br>ancient Egypt) but they&#39;re also spending a 
  lot of time<br>playing Smiloid, a silly game of splashing smiley<br>faces with 
  paint. Now, I tell myself it&#39;s ok, they&#39;re<br>playing that together, it 
  requires cooperation, etc.<br>But part of me feels like it&#39;s wasting time. I 
  *know*<br>that unschooling is about everything being learning,<br>nothing is a 
  waste of time. But the kids are on the<br>computer for hours a day. So I 
  wonder if anyone else<br>has encountered this situation.<br><br>2. My son is a 
  very advanced reader, but since our<br>unschooling started, all he reads is 
  Star Wars books.<br>They&#39;re adult sci-fi, and I worry a little about 
  there<br>being &quot;scary&quot; stuff in there, though he&#39;s VERY<br>sensitive and would 
  stop reading if he did get<br>scared.Also, I have this bias that sci-fi is 
  trash. :)<br>I have no intention of censoring his reading, because<br>I 
  believe it&#39;s for him to find what he&#39;s comfortable<br>with. <br><br>I guess my 
  2 questions are the same: I understand<br>we&#39;re guides and are to put 
  interesting things in<br>their path, but what about taking things out of 
  their<br>paths? Does anyone LIMIT things like computers, sci-fi<br>books, 
  videos? We don&#39;t have TV at all, never have, so<br>that&#39;s not a problem. But 
  what about other stuff?<br><br>Hmm, even writing this I feel like I have my 
  answer.<br>I&#39;m being a control freak.

  It does NOT mean we have to control <br>everything they do.&nbsp; Children 
  learn best, and the learning is most <br>permanent, when children come to 
  conclusions on their own based <br>upon their own experience.&nbsp; Sometimes 
  that means we have to let <br>them do it wrong and make mistakes.&nbsp; It 
  doesn&#39;t mean we need to <br>control them either.&nbsp; Jesus never controlled

    limiting but they seem to limit themselves pretty well.&nbsp; They will get 
    tired of it and will decide to go and colour or read or something.&nbsp; I 
    do limit tv time though, they also only watch pbs when they do watch

    yet.&nbsp; When we go to the library we do check that their books that they 
    choose are age appropriate for them, perhaps that is too much control on my 
    part, but it makes us feel more comfortable about that.&nbsp; MY dh was very 
    much into sci fi books when he was a kid and I don&#39;t see us limiting that 
    when the kids are able to read and comprehend them.&nbsp; It sounds like 
    your son really enjoys them and the fact that he is enjoying reading is

      [Unschooling-dotcom] new to this list: Hi!<br><br></font></div><tt>Hello! 
      My name&#39;s Juli and I&#39;m homeschooling my ds, 10<br>and dd, 8. We&#39;ve been 
      homeschooling for a year and a<br>half, since I took them out of public 
      school. We<br>decided a couple weeks ago to try unschooling, 
      after<br>reading a lot about it. I have a couple questions:<br><br>1. I&#39;m 
      wondering if anyone limits computer time? My<br>kids love the computer, 
      and are on it all the time. I<br>feel ok when I see them playing Pharoah 
      (a game about<br>ancient Egypt) but they&#39;re also spending a lot of 
      time<br>playing Smiloid, a silly game of splashing smiley<br>faces with 
      paint. Now, I tell myself it&#39;s ok, they&#39;re<br>playing that together, it 
      requires cooperation, etc.<br>But part of me feels like it&#39;s wasting time. 
      I *know*<br>that unschooling is about everything being 
      learning,<br>nothing is a waste of time. But the kids are on 
      the<br>computer for hours a day. So I wonder if anyone else<br>has 
      encountered this situation.<br><br>2. My son is a very advanced reader, 
      but since our<br>unschooling started, all he reads is Star Wars 
      books.<br>They&#39;re adult sci-fi, and I worry a little about there<br>being 
      &quot;scary&quot; stuff in there, though he&#39;s VERY<br>sensitive and would stop 
      reading if he did get<br>scared.Also, I have this bias that sci-fi is 
      trash. :)<br>I have no intention of censoring his reading, because<br>I 
      believe it&#39;s for him to find what he&#39;s comfortable<br>with. <br><br>I 
      guess my 2 questions are the same: I understand<br>we&#39;re guides and are to 
      put interesting things in<br>their path, but what about taking things out 
      of their<br>paths? Does anyone LIMIT things like computers, 
      sci-fi<br>books, videos? We don&#39;t have TV at all, never have, so<br>that&#39;s 
      not a problem. But what about other stuff?<br><br>Hmm, even writing this I 
      feel like I have my answer.<br>I&#39;m being a control freak. 
      :)<br><br>Juli<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do

  <div><br></div><tt>&gt; Juli,<br>&gt; You aren&#39;t being a control freak. Our 
  job is to train up our children<br>&gt; in the way that they should go..even 
  in the small things. The bible is<br>&gt; very clear on this. I don&#39;t know if 
  you are a christian family or not,<br>&gt; but in either case your concerns 
  are valid because they are born of<br>&gt; your love for your children. My 
  daughter is indeed obsessive about the<br>&gt; television. I am the same way 
  about the computer. We made a deal to<br>&gt; limit our television and 
  computer times down to an hour each day with<br>&gt; allowances for special 
  times or special programs. You can sit down<br>&gt; with the kids and make an 
  agreement that they can do maybe an hour on<br>&gt; pharoah and maybe half an 
  hour on smileys or whatever that one is. Do<br>&gt; the same thing with the 
  books. Say he can read his Star Wars book for<br>&gt; a couple hours if he 
  also reads a nature book, or some other book for<br>&gt; twice the amount of 
  time he reads the star wars books. You can also<br>&gt; have him build models 
  of the ships, write his own sci-fi play, etc<br>&gt; instead of just reading 
  alone. I am having the same problem with the<br>&gt; Harry Potter books. She 
  can read it, provided she also reads some<br>&gt; other books from the library 
  as well. WE also add bible reading and<br>&gt; prayer time to our day.

  <br><br>I&#39;m sorry, but this really isn&#39;t unschooling.&nbsp; What&#39;s the point 
  of <br>saying they can follow their interests and trusting them to know 
  <br>what they want (which for me is the whole point, what they learn is 
  <br>far less important than that they enjoy it, and know themselves <br>from 
  it) if then you go about controlling their access to those things <br>they 
  want to do?&nbsp; Why mess about with someone&#39;s love of and joy <br>in reading 
  by telling them they have to read something they don&#39;t <br>want to?&nbsp; Not 
  my idea of unschooling. <br><br>Tracy<br>PS&nbsp; Some Sci-fi books are trash, 
  but that&#39;s the fun!&nbsp; And some are <br>great literature, Lord of the Rings 
  was voted the UK&#39;s no1 20thC <br>book last year, and thousands of people 
  voted.&nbsp; I got belittled in <br>school for reading fantasy novels (David 
  Eddings and Anne <br>McCaffrey) cos the others thought they were 
  rubbish.&nbsp; I never found <br>Sweet Valley High all that challenging or 
  appealing, but I didn&#39;t say <br>so...<br></tt><br><br><tt>Message

&gt; I guess my 2 questions are the same: I understand<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re guides and are to put interesting things in<br/>
&gt; their path, but what about taking things out of their<br/>
&gt; paths? Does anyone LIMIT things like computers, sci-fi<br/>
&gt; books, videos? We don&#39;t have TV at all, never have, so<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s not a problem. But what about other stuff?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The questions I usually ask myself in these sorts of situations are - is<br/>
what my child is doing life-threatening, health-threatening, likely to hurt<br/>
themself or others, or morally dangerous?? If not, I try really hard not to<br/>
mess with it. So  in answer to your question, yes I do think that at some<br/>
point we might limit things, if I found they met the above criteria. So in<br/>
other words, we might limit computer time if my kid spent so much time in<br/>
front of the computer that they became a pale and flabby worm (health<br/>
threatening), or if they were conversing on the internet with potential<br/>
child molesters or some such outrageous thing that was dangerous (hard to<br/>
imagine, but still...). Or if they were reading books or magazines that we<br/>
felt were detrimental to their burgeoning psyches, sure we&#39;d limit it. I<br/>
think every parent has limits, whether they like to admit it or not, and I<br/>
don&#39;t necessarily think some limits are a bad thing. We all draw lines in<br/>
the sand, the difference being where those lines are drawn. Personally, I<br/>
think it&#39;s a good idea to draw your lines where they matter the most, and<br/>
where you can give maximum freedom to your kids to enjoy the experiences in<br/>
life that they are drawn to. I don&#39;t believe that unschooling means<br/>
free-for-all, to me it means that I follow my childrens&#39; lead and try to<br/>
gently guide them where I see them reaching boundaries that I think are<br/>
important. For instance, for us that meant getting rid of the TV this last<br/>
year. It was obviously negatively impacting our lives on a daily basis, so<br/>
it went down to the basement and has not really been missed.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that you&#39;re taking an important step in challenging your own<br/>
assumptions about what is &quot;worthwhile&quot; and what is a &quot;waste of time&quot;. In<br/>
unschooling our children, we sometimes have to put in a lot of work<br/>
deschooling ourselves. After all, most of us grow up with the assumptions<br/>
that our culture and schooling have indoctrinated us with. Things have to be<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; or &quot;useful&quot; (as defined by someone else&#39;s arbitrary standards)<br/>
in order to have value. Letting go of these assumptions can be really<br/>
difficult. For me, I&#39;ve found that always keeping a mind-opening book handy<br/>
for reading and inspiration helps to keep my own horizons ever expanding<br/>
(anything by John Holt, John Taylor Gatto, Grace Llewellyn, among others are<br/>
good places to start).<br/>
<br/>
I would bet Bill Gates doesn&#39;t feel that he blew off too much time by<br/>
playing on computers, that Matisse is glad he &quot;wasted&quot; time cutting up bits<br/>
of paper and pasting them into collages, that Edison trifled away his hours<br/>
tinkering with things most people saw no use for, that Asimov spent his<br/>
writing hours in the realm of &quot;trashy&quot; Sci Fi, etc. etc. :-)<br/>

telly program tie-in, very cool art stuff including cartoons) through <br/>
the FPS from Star-Trek (I kid you not, but I only set up the tutorial <br/>
levels for them) to Dungeon Keeper, which is educational in the use <br/>
of resources and personnel, if you don&#39;t have enough gold, your <br/>
creatures don&#39;t train and get angry when you can&#39;t pay them, and <br/>
strategy, planning and forward thinking.  Oh, and they like it :-)  I&#39;m <br/>
looking on the desk to see what&#39;s being used apart from that...  a <br/>
couple of DK &#39;explorer&#39; disks and Dinosaur Hunter, Rollercoaster <br/>
Tycoon (planning and physics, if your coaster track doesn&#39;t come <br/>
down before the car runs out of momentum, it crashes...)  and <br/>
Creatures 2...  oh, and a Chicken Run &#39;fun-pack&#39; CD, it came cheap <br/>
with a newspaper.  We have an &#39;educational&#39; DK CD, but it hasn&#39;t <br/>
been used for ages.  Hmm, maybe it&#39;s time for a return...<br/>
<br/>
My problem with the telly is that I don&#39;t like watching the tv for the <br/>
sake of it, so i tend not to watch when they&#39;re watching unless it&#39;s <br/>
something I really like, like Little Bear, or a vid I haven&#39;t seen for a <br/>
while.  But it&#39;s my problem more than theirs, apart from I don&#39;t get <br/>
into discussions about what they&#39;re watching...<br/>
