rangers*(fire that started over a letter I think) and hunters *(example <br/>
poachers or simply ones that dont care to continue keep our woods clean).  <br/>

<br/>
So are you saying you hung out with hunters who littered and were destructive?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure my parents always packed it all out.  They were from before the <br/>
depression, and some Americans seemed to take pride in disposable bottles and <br/>
other signs of decadent plenty.  Throwing trash out windows wasn&#39;t seen as <br/>
horrible.  And I didn&#39;t think they knew that a little pile of trash could still <br/>
be there fifty years later.  Piles of trash a hundred years before tended to <br/>
decompose better than modern trash does.  Leaving cold campfires with <br/>
half-melted glass and cans didn&#39;t bother some of my parents&#39; generation.  They never <br/>
left them hot, but leaving them instead of taking them apart seemed a courtesy to <br/>
the next campers.   When I was a kid I had girlscout &quot;leave it cleaner than <br/>
you found it&quot; training.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have to say I agree, sadly. I spend a lot of time backpacking and camping<br/>
and the areas are always the worst just after hunting season is over. I<br/>
can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve gone to a campground and found deer legs<br/>
and guts hanging out on the ground, trashcans not used or overflowing<br/>
everywhere, the pit toilets crammed with garbage, etc.  Even worse in the<br/>
wilderness, where at least most backpackers will take out what they brought<br/>
in. After awhile, we learned just not to go right after hunting season, give<br/>
the campgrounds a few weeks to get cleaned up.<br/>
One year while I was backpacking, we made camp after it got dark and had<br/>
severe bear problems during the night in our camp. Turns out that hunters<br/>
had used that same camping spot and had left deer legs and blood everywhere,<br/>
we didn&#39;t see it until morning. Now I&#39;m very careful to check out camping<br/>
spots before setting up my tent!<br/>
<br/>
I come from a hunting family, and my grandpa bagged an elk most years. But<br/>
he and his buddies also took a ton of beer and cans of food and I sincerely<br/>
doubt that they left their camping areas cleaner than they found them.<br/>
