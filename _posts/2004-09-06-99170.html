&lt;&lt; My sophomore daughter is face-to-face with kids who wish they could go <br/>
back in time to kill Shakespeare so that they wouldn&#39;t ahve to study him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WELL!<br/>
Having just watched Pride and Prejudice (again, the BBC mini-series which is <br/>
on DVD) with Colin Firth, the first thought that popped into my mind was to <br/>
recommend that everyone here immediately  rent or buy the DVD called Black <br/>
Adder:  Back and Forth.  It was the last (most recent, maybe not always last) <br/>
installment of the Black Adder series, involves time travel, and Colin Firth plays <br/>
Shakespeare.  See how Black Adder deals with him on behalf of all school <br/>
children thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
I like Black Adder, and Colin Firth, and Shakespeare.<br/>
<br/>
Of my kids, none fear Shakespeare.   When Marty stayed with Anne Ohman&#39;s <br/>
family, they saw a production of The Tempest, with an actor who&#39;s a friend of <br/>
Anne&#39;s and Marty had met him beforehand.  As soon as Marty got into the hotel room <br/>
at the conference, he told me lots about it, and showed me the program.   <br/>
When we were packing to leave, he couldn&#39;t find that program, and was as close to <br/>
grouchy as he had been all weekend when I didn&#39;t know where it was either.  <br/>
We searched, it was located (in my pile of papers) and he was happy again.     <br/>
He&#39;s talked to me a couple of times since then.  I have a Classic Comics or <br/>
some other kind of illustrated version of it, and I intend to locate that and <br/>
leave it on Marty&#39;s bed at some point soon.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;studying&quot; Shakespeare is quite different from enjoying and appreciating <br/>
Shakespeare if my kids are any indication.<br/>
<br/>
Another wonderful thing to get if you yourself are afraid of Shakespeare or <br/>
marred by previous &quot;exposure&quot; or you didn&#39;t have much exposure and would like <br/>
more is &quot;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare,&quot; also on DVD, by The <br/>
Reduced Shakespeare Company.  There are only two plays they do at length, but <br/>
they...  well, you&#39;ll see.  And you won&#39;t be sorry if you do.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for us all, we can see Shakespeare in our own homes, done by <br/>
professionals, and we can pause or rewind or fast forward, we can eat chocolate chip <br/>
ice cream or hamburgers (neither of which were known to anyone at The Globe <br/>
Theatre), sit on soft couches with kids in our laps, have subtitles playing...  I <br/>
love DVDs.  And I&#39;m grateful to anyone who has ever made a film of <br/>
Shakespeare.   Netflix has a DVD for rent (which means it&#39;s for sale too, but it might <br/>
not be so cheap) of some of the earliest silent movies of Shakespeare plays.  <br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s only one scene of a  play, and some were very experimental <br/>
things with interesting special effects.   <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote before any of the three recommendations above were <br/>
available, called &quot;Bringing Shakespeare Home&quot; (and I should probably add what I <br/>
wrote above to it, now that I think of it; I love the internet almost as much <br/>
as I love DVDs--does that make me &quot;media drenched&quot;? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Ah... It isn&#39;t where I can edit it or add to it.  ***sigh***<br/>
It will have a second address soon, and it will be<br/>
sandradodd.com/shakespeare<br/>
<br/>
Ah, I love the internet.<br/>
And I can&#39;t leave this without a curtsy to Kenneth Branagh, or  without <br/>
telling you that he is mentioned in the conversation between Black Adder and <br/>
Shakespeare in &quot;Back and Forth.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126942326">I believe I got this bit of wisdom from YOU Sandra, and though I may <br/>
be hazy on its source, its content stuck with me: The plays of <br/>
Shakespeare are meant to be SEEN -- not READ.<br/>
<br/>
(one day you MUST see the death scene rendition of Broomio and <br/>
Trumiette, played by my daughter Truemy and a housebroom.)<br/>

Oh churl! drunk all and left not a friendly drop for me! I&#39;ll kiss <br/>
thy lips! (draws broomstick to her mouth to kiss)<br/>
THOU HAST NO LIPS?!!?</div>
