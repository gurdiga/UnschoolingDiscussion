<div id="ygrps-yiv-159993706">Okay, one of the other things I&#39;ve been working on this morning is <br/>
changing the settings for the list archives so they&#39;re only available <br/>
to listmembers. I&#39;ve usually run lists as open to viewing by anyone, <br/>
whether they were on the list or not, figuring that people could read <br/>
the archives of a list to see if it was one they might want to join <br/>
or not, or people could refer others offlist to specific posts by <br/>
sending them the URL to the post, or just because it seemed <br/>
friendlier than keeping closed, member-only list archives.<br/>
<br/>
But a number of things came together recently (interesting how that <br/>
happens, isn&#39;t it?) to cause me to change my mind on this policy.<br/>
<br/>
First off, there&#39;s been an interesting discussion on one of the <br/>
politically oriented lists I belong to about whether or not it&#39;s <br/>
appropriate to forward a person&#39;s posts offlist without their <br/>
permission. FWIW, I said I didn&#39;t think so, but another person made <br/>
good point that they relied on that particular list to keep their <br/>
state list informed and needed to be able to share information, <br/>
perceptions, perspectives, etc., etc. Anyway, I&#39;ve suggested on that <br/>
list that we need to rely on common sense and courtesy for these <br/>
kinds of decisions...<br/>
<br/>
Then someone wrote to us about one of our lists, expressing dismay <br/>
that it had open archives, because she&#39;d done an internet search for <br/>
her own name and found that the list&#39;s messages came up in the <br/>
search! I wasn&#39;t even aware one could do that. Her concern was that <br/>
unfriendly relatives might gain access to what she&#39;d written on that <br/>
list - which seemed like a valid concern to me.<br/>
<br/>
Now of course it&#39;s easy to just join a list and gain access, and <br/>
we&#39;re all aware of the &quot;don&#39;t post it unless you want it bounced all <br/>
over the Internet&quot; syndrome. Still, it seems as though if we&#39;re to <br/>
err on the side of caution it would be wiser to make the list <br/>
archives closed instead of leaving them open to anyone doing an <br/>
internet search.<br/>
<br/>
So this list now has closed archives, available to list members only.<br/>
<br/>
Dead domains. I&#39;ll bet you wondered when I&#39;d get to that, huh? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it&#39;s no laughing matter. We learned a hard lesson this <br/>
morning when a good friend sent us a note advising us to check <br/>
something out, and when we checked, we were flabbergasted.<br/>
<br/>
We thought we were all paid up to keep our old home-ed-press domain <br/>
name (our first URL, from when we published books), and we had it <br/>
mirrored to our home-ed-magazine site because so many people still <br/>
had it linked through their sites (I think we found about 15,000+ <br/>
links to that URL). But somehow the registration on that domain name <br/>
expired (we&#39;re still trying to figure out how it expired without our <br/>
knowing it), and it was bought by a wholesale company, which leased <br/>
or rented it just two days ago to an overseas outfit that turned it <br/>
into a porno site.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING - please DON&#39;T check out that old home-ed-press site out of <br/>
idle curiosity, because it&#39;s one of those &quot;virulent&quot; porn sites that <br/>
will keep opening windows until you crash your browser or your whole <br/>
machine. Save everything before trying it if you&#39;re really *that* <br/>
curious to see what&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
And PLEASE - If you have a link to the old home-ed-press domain name <br/>
on your website (or your support group&#39;s site?) please change it to <br/>
home-ed-magazine.com as soon as possible. Thanks in advance for <br/>
helping us straighten out this serious problem.<br/>
