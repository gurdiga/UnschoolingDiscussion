<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487157001">My son Matt (7) is very particular about his clothing.  There are <br/>
only certain shirts he will wear.  It has to be &quot;soft&quot; enough, and it <br/>
has to &quot;look good&quot;.  He&#39;s low on long sleeved shirts, so in spite of <br/>
having lots of hand me downs that he&#39;s rejected, I took him to wal-<br/>
mart to see if there were any there that he liked. Of all the shirts <br/>
they had at wal-mart there were only 2 he liked, and they were both <br/>
sponge bob shirts.  One of them says, &quot;Go be stupid somewhere else&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, last night we were lying in his bed and he told me how much he <br/>
likes his new shirts.  And he said that he also knows which word on <br/>
his shirt says &quot;Go&quot;.  He said it&#39;s the word that has the G and the <br/>
o.  Cool!  He then pointed out that G and o are also in George, which <br/>
he knows because his favorite stuffed animal is a plush Curious <br/>
George. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also figured out the words yes and no on animal crossing (video <br/>
game) and he recognizes the word zoo from a Putt Putt computer game. <br/>
He knows Mom from writing me notes, and he knows his name and his <br/>
brother&#39;s and sister&#39;s names from just seeing them a lot from <br/>
labeling stuff, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s neat for me to see him slowly learning about reading through <br/>
unschooling!  I believed in the philosophy of unschooling before, but <br/>
I hadn&#39;t had the chance to see it work with reading first hand with <br/>
one of my kids yet, because I started unschooling my daughter after I <br/>
already had taught her how to read.  So this is exciting for me to <br/>
watch!  If I would have had to guess a week ago where I thought the <br/>
next thing he&#39;d learn about reading would come from, I wouldn&#39;t even <br/>
have guessed that it would come from a shirt.  <br/>

in a restaurant menu.  This morning he read &quot;to&quot; in his alphabet soup.  <br/>
And he found a &quot;z&quot; in there and asked me to spell &quot;zeppelin&quot; for him.  <br/>
He knows the word &quot;play&quot; from computer games and DVD&#39;s, also &quot;yes&quot; and <br/>
&quot;no&quot; from computer games (although he still doesn&#39;t get how to answer <br/>
the question &quot;are you sure?&quot;  Usually he says no when he means yes.)  He <br/>
can also read his name and his sister&#39;s name.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also doing a lot of asking what signs say, etc.  It&#39;s really neat.<br/>

<br/>
Here too!<br/>
<br/>
Watching Duncan&#39;s reading progress have been nothing less than amazing! He&#39;ll be nine March 1.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote months ago about his reading. Since then, he&#39;s progressed so much! He can read any note I leave for him (Ben&#39;s are harder to read &#39;cause Ben doesn&#39;t print! &lt;g&gt;). When I clean his room, I find books strewn from one end to the other---different kinds: &quot;baby&quot; books, nature books, _Scooby-Doo_, _Charlotte&#39;s Web_---a jumbled assortment. He&#39;s just picking them up and reading what he can. He asked Cam the other night to read a precious signed copy of &quot;Spawn&quot;---the comic book. Cam says Duncan knew almost every word. <br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago, he asked to go to the book store to buy _Faeries&#39; Landing_. He was through with it in a few days. We went right back to buy issues two and three. He insisted on paying for them with his own money. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron (the child who said he would never read again! &lt;G&gt;) has two new magazine subscriptions (Relix & Modern Drummer) and a mess of new books (mostly on music and musicians). I went looking for the dictionary to make sure how to spell sergeant (it just didn&#39;t look right! &lt;g&gt;): I found it in Cam&#39;s room! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Cameron said he was really enjoying watching Duncan as he learned to read and do math in his head. It makes it *real* for Cameron to see it happen in someone else---with no pressure and out of pure love and desire to know.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t tell me unschooling doesn&#39;t &#39;work&#39;!<br/>
<br/>
OH! And Cameron has just recently started playing video games with Duncan----and LIKES them! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s VERY exciting to watch!<br/>
