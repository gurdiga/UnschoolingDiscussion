<div id="ygrps-yiv-174782537">-=-=--mind you, I know they&#39;re not really free, and will maybe get in trouble if the teacher catches them, but when a person &quot;finds learning&quot; in whatever he&#39;s doing, even after school hours or in his daydreams during school hours...isn&#39;t that a sort of unschooling?-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Naw. That&#39;s learning. Learning outside of school. And yes, even schoolaholics do THAT! &lt;g&gt; (They may not think it COUNTS, however! &lt;BWG&gt;)<br/>
