<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067668198">Julie and Sheila: Fascinating discussion!<br/>
<br/>
Julie: are there any websites (in the absence of meeting you irl!) you could<br/>
direct me to about your beliefs? I&#39;ve sometimes wanted to get a red-letter<br/>
New Testament and then ignore everything in black and white! And I&#39;d really<br/>
like to challenge Paul&#39;s writings...<br/>
<br/>
Sheila: By &quot;controlling,&quot; I&#39;m sure people are thinking of many of the hsers<br/>
I know; strict discipline, not watching TV or movies, controlling how their<br/>
kids (and themselves) dress, act, talk, etc. They&#39;re conforming to a fairly<br/>
rigid set of external rules. It&#39;s not how I interpret the Bible, but it is<br/>
how I was raised. I&#39;m gradually recovering, but it&#39;s a long road. You sound<br/>
like you&#39;ve got it under control (no pun intended!) For various reasons, I&#39;m<br/>
not able to be out of the fundamentalist influence as much as you are and I<br/>
have to deal with both worlds. I try to let the kids experience the world<br/>
without the filters I was raised with, though.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an interesting article I found on the subject:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143954135">Hello list friends,<br/>
<br/>
We finally got the Jan/Feb issue out the door to the printer, and <br/>
it&#39;s another terrific one. It&#39;s a good feeling to have all these many <br/>
parts and pieces - articles, columns, photos, ads, letters, etc. come <br/>
together into a nice, cohesive whole. Still just amazes me how we <br/>
keep managing to pull it off after almost 20 years at this - and we <br/>
still get just as big a kick out of wrapping up an issue as we did <br/>
back in 1984! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nice to see this list didn&#39;t implode. &lt;eg&gt; Also nice to see Sandra&#39;s <br/>
new list become such a warm, friendly community so quickly. I did get <br/>
one serious off-list grumble from someone who asked how I could let <br/>
such an awful thing happen. Geez. I dunno. Didn&#39;t much seem like it <br/>
was any of my business...<br/>
<br/>
Had an interesting encounter yesterday while getting my brakes fixed <br/>
down at the local tire shop. Met a friend there waiting for his truck <br/>
to be fixed, we chatted a while, and then someone the friend knew <br/>
(but I didn&#39;t) stopped by to chat while her tires were being changed. <br/>
My friend introduced me as &quot;editor of that national homeschooling <br/>
magazine&quot; (most people in this small community know of us and HEM), <br/>
and then mentioned to me that his friend had homeschooled her kids <br/>
for a few years, but now they were back in the local alternative <br/>
school. The reaction from the poor lady was what was so interesting - <br/>
she started detailing why she *had* to put her kids in school <br/>
(because she needed to take a job), how much they were enjoying the <br/>
alternative school, but *of course* it would never be as wonderful as <br/>
homeschooling had been, etc., etc., etc. By the time she wound down <br/>
and my friend changed the subject I was beginning to wonder if I&#39;d <br/>
unconsciously frowned at the word &#39;school&#39; or something to invoke <br/>
such a defensive reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Not the first time this has happened, of course. Just the most <br/>
recent. I&#39;m sure many of you have run into this odd phenomenon of <br/>
people reacting as though homeschooling were something they felt <br/>
guilty about if they weren&#39;t doing it. I hadn&#39;t given the whole thing <br/>
much thought until yesterday, but this lady&#39;s intensity has been <br/>
making me wonder whether or not it&#39;s a good thing that homeschooling <br/>
is perceived as so... I dunno... wholesome? Unimpeachable? (Where&#39;s <br/>
that damn thesaurus when I need it? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand I think it&#39;s great that homeschooling has such a warm <br/>
fuzzy rep, but on the other hand I worry about this attitude <br/>
backfiring, people going overboard to justify their decision NOT to <br/>
homeschool, and weighing in even more heavily on the school - even <br/>
alternative school - side of the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Still rolling that whole idea over in my head, but wanted to share it <br/>
here for whatever it&#39;s worth - and for whatever feedback/additional <br/>
fodder it stimulates. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had similiar responses. I get the feeling that some people are angry with me/hsers and they have the impression that we believe we&#39;re holier than thou (not!)...  that&#39;s what I fear they think. So, rather than weighing in more heavily on school, my worry is that they&#39;ll continue to search for something negative about us until they succeed. Now, there&#39;s plenty of negative stuff in my household.. we&#39;re far from perfect. But what I find these people doing irritates me... &quot;oh, well, your dd is so good at gymnastics because she can practice it all day. If she had to go to school, she wouldn&#39;t be any better than my little Suzie-Q.&quot; @@<br/>

me.  I get lots of questions about how we do it and why we do it, but <br/>
I have never once had anyone feel the need to justify their decision <br/>
not to hs to me.  I guess I just don&#39;t make people feel defensive.  I <br/>
do often get whole life stories and info that I would just as soon <br/>
not know about people . . . there are days I feel like I must  <br/>
have &#39;Therapist&#39; tatooed on my head.  I&#39;m not one, but people sure do <br/>
open up to me in strange places!  <br/>

Point b: My experiences have included people who say they can&#39;t stand to be around their kids and how can I possibly stand to be around mine all the time. The responses have been as extreme as parents saying they hate holidays because it means the kids will be home. <br/>
Point c: A lot of people in my neck of the woods have only been around people homeschooling for religious reasons. Often, these homeschoolers have a unique way of living (I&#39;m really trying not to step on toes here) and others find this way of living ... unusual and *in some instances*, almost cult-like.  These are the times I was referring to when people just walk away.. they view these hsing families are freaky.<br/>

  &gt; I&#39;m not sure I would consider any of those responses &#39;defensive&#39;.<br/>
  &gt; Although I can see how our responses to them (at least the first two)<br/>
  &gt; could turn them defensive quite easily.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;&gt; a. I could never homeschool<br/>
  &gt; Answer to pull out defensiveness: &quot;Oh sure you could if you really<br/>
  &gt; cared about your kids&quot;<br/>
  &gt; My answer:  &quot;Everyone has to find their own way, but you should<br/>
  &gt; consider all the options.  Let me know if you ever want more info.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;&gt; b. My! How can you stand to be around your kids all the time? I&#39;d<br/>
  &gt; go crazy!<br/>
  &gt; Answer to pull out defensiveness: &quot;Why?  Don&#39;t you like them?&quot;<br/>
  &gt; My answers: &quot;You know, we went through a period of adjustment too.<br/>
  &gt; It was hard at first because we had gotten so used to being apart,<br/>
  &gt; but we wouldn&#39;t change it back now for anything!&quot;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;ve heard other hsers say actually use those first answers and<br/>
  &gt; elicit a defensive reaction.  And I think they really didn&#39;t realize<br/>
  &gt; the effect they had.<br/>

  &gt;&gt; I have this happen to me all the *time*! Parents seem to have this<br/>
  &gt; guilty look on their faces and say something to the effect of<br/>
  &gt;&gt; a. I could never homeschool<br/>
  &gt;&gt; b. My! How can you stand to be around your kids all the time? I&#39;d<br/>
  &gt; go crazy!<br/>
  &gt;&gt; c. oh. My neighbor does that. (and then abruptly walks away).<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;&gt; I believe this happens because, if you look at their responses, it<br/>
  &gt; shows<br/>
  &gt;&gt; a. they think I have some abilitiy that they don&#39;t<br/>
  &gt;&gt; b. they never should&#39;ve had kids???<br/>
  &gt;&gt; c. they live near somebody they don&#39;t especially like??? &lt;g&gt; (I<br/>
  &gt; won&#39;t expound on this one!)<br/>

<br/>
Sarah, I&#39;m sorry.  You misunderstood, I&#39;m not saying those were <br/>
things I thought YOU (singular specific) said, only that I have heard <br/>
others say thing like that and elicit very defensive responses.  <br/>
