I remember the feel of the wood, and the little scrap papers for writing the <br/>
call numbers down on.   I&#39;d use them for &quot;bookmarks&quot; in between cards I wanted <br/>
to look at again.   Sometimes I&#39;d find one someone else had left in as a <br/>
marker.<br/>
<br/>
I used to feel the sides and bottoms of the drawers sometime and think that <br/>
just about everyone in town for years had touched those.   At the university, I <br/>
would think that people who had REALLY KNOWN this subject matter had opened <br/>
the drawer the same way I had.     Wood can be that way.   Plastic keyboards <br/>
don&#39;t seem to hold that kind of warmth and ju-ju.    I have very rarely thought <br/>
that someone else I really admired had looked at the same website I had.<br/>

One thing I love about our library is that next to the computer, they have<br/>
the catalog cards(I don&#39;t know why they still have so many of them) with the<br/>
little pencils and you use the blank side to write your call numbers down.<br/>
I sort of feel like I am still searching in the card catalog.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I just joined the board.  I live in the bay area, California, and have<br/>
twin 9 year old sons.  My aspiration is to get to the comfort level that you<br/>
guys have with unschooling.  My head is coming along slowly after my<br/>
heart...<br/>
