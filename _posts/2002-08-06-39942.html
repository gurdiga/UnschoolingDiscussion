understanding that the patron is seeking information, and the purpose<br/>
of the employee is to help the patron find it. No questions asked. No<br/>
mention of the patron being too young or not being dressed properly;<br/>
no discussion about the appropriateness of the information or the<br/>
&quot;readiness&quot; of the patron to learn it; no mention of testing or<br/>
judging, no timetables, no hall passes, no arbitrary rules, no need to<br/>
ask permission to go pee. The library attitude is benevolence and service.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t always the case. I have one particularly<br/>
nightmarish memory involving the librarian in the small town where I<br/>
grew up. It happened when I was 7 years old. I had read C.S. Lewis&#39;<br/>
&quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,&quot; and wanted to read the other<br/>
books in the Chronicles of Narnia series. For some unfathomable<br/>
reason, those books happened to be behind the librarians desk. While<br/>
my mother was in the &quot;children&#39;s room&quot; helping my little brothers find<br/>
some books, I timidly approached the librarian and asked her if she<br/>
would hand me the book I wanted. She smiled indulgently and asked,<br/>
&quot;How old<br/>
are you?&quot; When I told her, she smiled again and said (in one of those<br/>
sickeningly sweet voices some adults use with children), &quot;Maybe you<br/>
should look for a book in there [pointing to the children&#39;s room]<br/>
instead.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I was so shy at the time that, even though I KNEW she was wrong, I<br/>
just went in and stood by my mother, miserable. I can&#39;t BELIEVE I<br/>
didn&#39;t tell my mother what happened. I know she would have had<br/>
something to say to that woman! I&#39;ve imagined many different scenarios<br/>
involving what I should have said and done, but the respect for<br/>
authority had been so ingrained in me that I wasn&#39;t confident enough<br/>
to act on my feelings. <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, although this memory is quite painful to me even today,<br/>
the experience didn&#39;t have any effect on my love or ability for<br/>
reading. (Interestingly, though, it wasn&#39;t until I was in my twenties<br/>
when I finally read the other books in the Narnia series!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I really hope this was a unique experience, and that no other<br/>
child has been treated in this way at a public library.  <br/>
