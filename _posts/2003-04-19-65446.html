<div id="ygrps-yiv-55462597">Hi again <br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter who is 12. She has motor skills that frustrate her as she is unable to keep up with others. Always has had this trouble. She seems to find socialising awkward. We have discussed it and she just does not know how to mingle and interact. She is awkward physically and is big for her age.Appears to have thyroid difficulties that we are just becoming aware of. She also has had anxiety attacks and generally has a low anxiety always.<br/>
The question is this. She is lonely. She wants a good friend. Had one but it fell apart as she handled some emotional differences inappropriately. I listen and support her and now we are in special Olympics rhythmic gymnastics.She appears to like this although claims she is not handicapped.In this group she is not the last or clumsiest for the first time. By being in this group are we telling her there is something wrong with her and is there any more I can do to help with the social frustration. We were at a movie and I saw her looking at two girls walking and chatting together. When I asked her what she thought when she saw this she said she wanted a friend to do that with. I quetioned whether she thought she might have more luck socially in school. She said maybe but she was not willing to go that route. She recognised that they would tease her for her size, red hair and slowness.<br/>
<br/>
I realise I cannot control or make her pain go away. This is hard to see and I wonder if I am depriving her socially somehow.<br/>

I hope you won&#39;t think I&#39;m goofy or missing the point, but until she can<br/>
develop some friendships with kids her age, how about a dog for<br/>
affection and companionship that doesn&#39;t waver.  (My friendships wavered<br/>
a lot and had very bumpy spots when I was 12 and in school.)<br/>

This was a great idea for my niece a few years back. She loved the dog, took it to the park all the time, etc. She got very interested in obedience training, making natural dog food and all sorts of stuff. She even did some breeding. Most of the people she met were adults, so it didn&#39;t really get her any friends her age, but it did help her be more sure of herself.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m new here, coming out of lurkdom after a couple of weeks of reading.<br/>

  No I don&#39;t think you are goofy. Thanks for your interest. We have a dog. I guess one of my concerns is that she can&#39;t do the social friendship thing. There is some speculation that she has aspergers autism so the social thing fits. I guess really I just feel sad for her. We present a large number of social opportunities and have offered lots of activity choice. Nothing seems to have clicked for her and she is lonely ad feeling very outcast.<br/>

<br/>
This would have described Conor while he was still in school. It was <br/>
becoming a big issue for him. Once he came out, he stopped trying so <br/>
hard to fit into the places that were so difficult for him and <br/>
instead focused more on where his own strengths lie.<br/>
<br/>
So instead of trying football, baseball, soccer, etc. he participates <br/>
in non-competitive physical activities. He rollerblades and bikes and <br/>
can usually keep up fine during those activities. He rarely goes in <br/>
for big group stuff, though and prefers one on one stuff better.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also focused on making friendships through the activities that <br/>
he is good at (or at least enjoys), like computer gaming, D&D, etc. <br/>
Right now he is also finding that he can connect with older (16/17) <br/>
girls. He&#39;s got a couple of friends who are girls right now. He&#39;s <br/>
also always been better at connecting with adults than kids his own <br/>
age.<br/>
<br/>

also has had anxiety attacks and generally has a low anxiety always.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Has she always been unschooled? Does she have any school induced <br/>
stuff to get over? I have found that Conor is really blossoming <br/>
socially this past year, from 13 to 14. He&#39;s just becoming able to <br/>
talk to people comfortably and make contacts a bit more easily. I <br/>
think it&#39;s a combo of a certain level of maturity and a big enough <br/>
distance from the painful memories of school socialization.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The question is this. She is lonely. She wants a good friend. Had <br/>
 </span></blockquote>one but it fell apart as she handled some emotional differences <br/>
inappropriately.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh dear sweet girl. {{{{hugs}}}}}} We&#39;ve all had relationships fall <br/>
apart because we handled something poorly. At least I have. She <br/>
shouldn&#39;t feel hopeless because of this, she can learn from it! <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re moving soon and Conor is worried about making friends again. <br/>
I&#39;ve been telling him that *he* has made the friendships he has thus <br/>
far. *He* has learned more skills than he had at age 9 and they&#39;re <br/>
just going to keep getting better. Your daughter was able to form one <br/>
good friendship. It&#39;s sad that it fell apart, but you can help her <br/>
use what she learned to try to find some new connections.<br/>
<br/>

the first time. By being in this group are we telling her there is <br/>
something wrong with her and is there any more I can do to help with <br/>
the social frustration.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What does she think? Does she like the class? Are there good social <br/>
contacts for her there? Does she like the physical aspect of it? I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t focus so much on improving her clumsiness as I would helping <br/>
her to find her own strengths. What makes her shine? Groups might not <br/>
be the best solution. There&#39;s a built in opportunity to compare <br/>
yourself with others. Maybe some individual opportunities to use her <br/>
body.<br/>
 <br/>

said maybe but she was not willing to go that route. She recognised <br/>
that they would tease her for her size, red hair and slowness.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, school was the WORST place for Conor to be. Any <br/>
differences are just magnified and highlighted in the school setting.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I realise I cannot control or make her pain go away. This is hard <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to see and I wonder if I am depriving her socially somehow.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By not sending her into obviously frustrating and potentially soul-<br/>
damaging situations? NO WAY!<br/>
<br/>
Help her find her strengths and don&#39;t focus too much attention on her <br/>
weaker points. Let her shine. That plus your support and love will <br/>
help her remain Whole.<br/>

<br/>
Have you been to the Special Needs folder on the mesage boards at <br/>
unschooling.com? Anne Ohman hangs out over there and your daughter <br/>
sounds a lot like her son Jacob. She has an amazing ability to see <br/>
the beauty in her child and help him see it too. I&#39;ve met Jacob. He <br/>
is the most well adjested child you&#39;ll ever know. And he has all of <br/>
the challenges you are describing. Maybe you can chat with Anne about <br/>
how she has helped Jake become the happy, content person that he is.<br/>

  Thank you for your kind words. Funny how I couldn&#39;t think of focusing on her strong points.Guess i was feeling a bit funky.Molly is still trying to find what she is good at. She has a sister (the hypersensitive one)who is mega quick and finds every activity easy and is noticed by others right away for her immediate skill. Hard on Molly.Her sister does not rub this in at all but molly notices it none the less. We have been focusing on accepting herself for where she is at.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Has she always been unschooled? Does she have any school induced <br/>

<br/>
  Molly has been home now for 5 years and really unschooled for 2-3 years. I&#39;m not sure if she has stuff still to get over. I guess being put in special reading and needing extra help always.<br/>
<br/>
  ! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   I like the idea of finding areas for her to use her body individually. She so far loves rythmic gymnastics as there is no focus on others ability. She has only been involved for about 1 month.She laughed with one girl over a move they made and was very excited. This alone was social contact enough for her. One girl is seeking her out .Molly is hesitant but we are working on trying one visit and seeing how it goes. I am helping her with wording to make the call.<br/>

It happens. :o) It can happen to them even more. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so <br/>
important for us to remind them and help them and encourage them <br/>
towards what *is* working for them. And every child has those <br/>
qualities that make them shine. Schools only appreciate one or two <br/>
qualities in a &quot;good&quot; student. We have the ability to open up the <br/>

And where she is, is exactly where she needs to be right now. She has <br/>
amazing gifts and her gifts will be unlike her sister&#39;s or anyone <br/>
