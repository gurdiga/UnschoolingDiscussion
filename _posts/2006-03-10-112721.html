scraps from our house.  Our yolks were always bright  orange.  If you feed<br/>
them a lot of tomato scraps (like after canning  tomatoes) the their shells<br/>
are rubbery.  Different things can make  them harder or more brittle.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s true.  Our chickens have always been able to roam where ever  (we <br/>
don&#39;t have any close neighbors) so the bulk of their food is probably what a  wild <br/>
bird would eat.  About once every 13 or 15 years (something like that)  here <br/>
in WV there is a mass hatching of Cicada&#39;s (everyone calls them  locusts)...I <br/>
mean gazillions of them...everywhere you step...they even get in  your hair.  <br/>
That year, we would put food out for the chickens and they  wouldn&#39;t even <br/>
touch it.  They were feasting on Cicadas!  It sure  helped keep the number of bugs <br/>
we had to deal with much lower.<br/>
