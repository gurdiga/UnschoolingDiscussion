&lt;&lt; I think the possibilities of a 4 yo seeing how attractive guns on video<br/>
games and movies are and picking up and using a real one are vanishingly<br/>
small. *But* again, that&#39;s where common sense comes in. If you live in the<br/>
middle of PA where every other person has a gun rack on the back of his or<br/>
her truck and you routinely allow your 4 yo child to play unsupervised at<br/>
other people&#39;s homes is it common sense *not* to think that there&#39;s a<br/>
possibility of him running into a gun just become someone you don&#39;t know<br/>
never suggested that possibility? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One lesson to be learned from Sleeping Beauty is that you cannot hide all the <br/>
spindles in the world.  Had the princess in that story been warned, and <br/>
taught to use a spindle safely, and maybe warned to just stay away from them <br/>
when she was sixteen, just in case, it would have been MUCH better than <br/>
attempting to destroy them all.  Because all it took was one, and her total <br/>
ignorance, fascination and curiosity did her and her whole family in.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in a state or city with NO gunracks, strict gun laws, kid never <br/>
likely to see one, that might be an even more dangerous scenario than one <br/>
like New Mexico where guns are common, and even toddlers know they&#39;re not <br/>
toys, not to play with.  But the same way we DID give our kids toy saws and <br/>
toy hammers and toy drills, they had toy guns and water guns (REAL water <br/>
guns, as they really shoot water), and none of them ever even had the urge <br/>
for a BB gun because they weren&#39;t exotic desireables.  They were just common <br/>
tools.<br/>
<br/>
We have one rifle here.  My dad had a gun collection and I turned down taking <br/>
one.  I wish now I had. And Marty said the other daday...<br/>
<br/>
About rarity and discussion, too...<br/>
When my friend Jerome Nelson was abused by a priest (long deceased) when he <br/>
was seven and eight years old (the youngest altar boy ever at Our Lady of <br/>
Fatima), he had no words whatsoever, no concepts, with which to even imagine <br/>
reporting this to his parents.  He had been told emphatically to do what the <br/>
priest told him.  He had been told repeatedly, at home and at school, to do <br/>
what grownups say, ESPECIALLY priests and nuns and your mom and dad.  <br/>
<br/>
When parents are unwilling to talk about issues as they come up, to prepare <br/>
kids (in kid terms, not gory detail and horrible warnings) to make decisions <br/>
and use their own judgment and to know where to go for help, the parents are <br/>
literally turning them over to abuse and danger.<br/>

We handled it all pretty much the same way. But Conor *has* asked for a BB <br/>
gun and a paintball gun and time at a shooting range to try out real target <br/>
shooting.<br/>
