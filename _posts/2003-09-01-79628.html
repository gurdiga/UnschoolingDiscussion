<div id="ygrps-yiv-285711206">This Unschooling Discussion list was founded in April, 1999 (then<br/>
named Unschooling-dotcom) and in the last four years it has grown into<br/>
one of the largest and most active discussion lists on the subject,<br/>
with over 1,200 members at this time. The publishers of Home Education<br/>
Magazine founded and have always sponsored the list as a feature of<br/>
their Unschooling.com website, but over the years this list has taken<br/>
on a life of its own and has developed far beyond the original purpose<br/>
and intent. For that reason we, the publishers of HEM, feel this list<br/>
needs to be given over to those who have nurtured and cared for it,<br/>
and who will continue to do so as the list continues to develop and grow.<br/>
<br/>
We will continue to support and encourage this list as the premier<br/>
unschooling list it has become, but we will no longer be the list<br/>
owners. We are transferring ownership when this message is sent, and<br/>
the new listowners will be posting their own message right after this<br/>
one. This list will remain associated with the Unschooling.com<br/>
website, and we will continue to advertise it in our magazine,<br/>
newsletters, resource listings and other resources, but it will be an<br/>
independent list, no longer owned by the magazine, nor officially<br/>
representing the Unschooling.com website.<br/>
<br/>
One important note: The list name will change from<br/>
Unschooling-Discussion to UnschoolingDiscussion; note that the dash<br/>
separating the two words will be deleted. You&#39;ll want to make note of<br/>
the change in your address books, email filters, etc. to avoid<br/>
problems down the road. The list archives will remain available<br/>
without change, as will the files, photos, links and other features<br/>
provided by Yahoo Groups (the new owners may elect to make changes).<br/>
<br/>
The new Unschooling- lists created in June will remain features of the<br/>
Unschooling.com website, owned and managed by the publishers of Home<br/>
Education Magazine. Those lists include: Unschooling-Cafe,<br/>
Unschooling-Politics, Unschooling-Resources, Unschooling-Days, and<br/>
Unschooling-Creatively. Other Unschooling-related lists will be<br/>
created from time to time as interests dictate.<br/>
<br/>
And for our old friends who might be wondering: Yes, we&#39;ll remain list<br/>
members, and will join the discussion from time to time. This has<br/>
always been a favorite list of ours - and we&#39;re excited to see where<br/>
this newfound freedom takes it!<br/>
<br/>
Our warmest best wishes to everyone on this list as the new adventure<br/>
begins!<br/>
<br/>
Kind Regards,<br/>
Mark and Helen Hegener, Publishers<br/>
Home Education Magazine, Unschooling.com<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640346790">We, Joyce Fetteroll, Pam Sorooshian and Sandra Dodd, thank Helen and <br/>
Mark Hegener and Home Education Magazine for providing us this <br/>
opportunity to help the UnschoolingDiscussion list spread its wings. <br/>
<br/>
To contact us, please send email to:<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com</a>, but we&#39;ll <br/>
post to the list from our own personal addresses for all but official <br/>
announcements. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to the three list owners, we have several moderators who <br/>
have helped in the changeover and will continue to help with the <br/>
list: <br/>
<br/>
Deborah Lewis &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ddzimlew@...">ddzimlew@...</a>&gt; <br/>
Pam Hartley &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pamhartley@...">pamhartley@...</a>&gt; <br/>
Ren &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starsuncloud@...">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; <br/>
Tia Leschke &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:leschke@...">leschke@...</a>&gt; <br/>
Mary B &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mummy124@...">mummy124@...</a>&gt; <br/>
KathrynJB &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:KathrynJB@...">KathrynJB@...</a>&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Their e-mail addresses are there so you&#39;ll recognize them, but please <br/>
don&#39;t burden moderators with private e-mail about the list. <br/>
<br/>
We expect that our handling of the list will adjust in response to <br/>
the needs of the list, but our vision will always be to provide a <br/>
place for great unschooling discussion. As our new list description <br/>
says, we are here to support those who are actively pushing <br/>
themselves beyond their comfort zones. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget to remove the dash from &quot;Unschooling-Discussion,&quot; making <br/>
it &quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>,&quot; from now on.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, Pam and Sandra</div>
