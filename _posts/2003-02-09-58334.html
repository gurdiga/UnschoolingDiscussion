asking, and if they&#39;re both unhelpful, you&#39;ll have to try asking again!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Attempt #1:<br/>
If you&#39;re playing a score of music, there are multiple lines (parts), and a<br/>
transposing instrument might be only one of them.  So you could have a<br/>
number of &quot;C&quot; parts (strings, flutes, oboe?), a couple of &quot;B flat&quot; parts<br/>
(clarintes) and four &quot;F&quot; parts (french horns) in an orchestra.  Obviously it<br/>
would make sense to the the bflat clarinetist play only clarinet parts.<br/>
<br/>
Attempt #2:<br/>
I think it works to play the part just as though it were written for you,<br/>
although an odd note here or there might be wrong.  I seem to remember doing<br/>
this with recorder music long, long ago.  Some helpful person wrote all the<br/>
parts to read with &quot;c&quot; fingerings, rather than actual pitch.  I just<br/>
remember being terribly confused.<br/>
<br/>
But then you can only play alone.  How fun is that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741939572">I think your second attempt explained it, though I&#39;m not really sure LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I meant was, if a score is written with an orchestra in mind, and there is a player of a transposing instrument, the musical notation will either be adjusted for them, or they will just adjust it in their heads as they go, since they are used to playing that particular instrument and are accustomed to the transposition problem.<br/>

<br/>
Orchestra parts are usually written as the player needs them.  So if the<br/>
clarinetist needs a b flat part, that&#39;s what he/she&#39;ll get.  Conductor, too.<br/>
So the conductor has to transpose easily.  A good player should be able to<br/>
transpose in their head from a &quot;c&quot; part, but in reality, not everybody is<br/>
necessarily good at that.<br/>

written in some screwy key or the piece has double sharps or double flats <br/>

They don&#39;t do the transposing.  They just get their B-flat clarinet music and <br/>
play it straight across.  ALL music written for clarinets is written that way.<br/>

What I don&#39;t know is what jazz musicians who never read music do.  If anyone <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from a sort of jazz background, I have to tell you I really don&#39;t <br/>
know ANY nonreading jazz players!  Even the old joke, &quot;How do you get a <br/>
guitar player to turn his amp down?&quot;  (put a lead sheet in front of him), <br/>
doesn&#39;t really apply.  The jazz players I know (lots here in the NYC and <br/>
surrounding area) have heavy theory backgrounds and are great readers.  A <br/>
good friend of mine who played the tenor sax was from the old school (a <br/>
player from the 50s).  He played well into his 90s.  He never went to <br/>
college or anything like that, but he could read, too.  Although you can <br/>
find fake books for E-flat and B-flat instruments, most of the time you&#39;d <br/>
always see the sax player looking over the guitar player&#39;s or piano <br/>
player&#39;s or bass player&#39;s shoulder at a fake book that was written for C <br/>
instruments, and you just know that guy is transposing not only the melody <br/>
of the tune but then when it comes to soloing, he&#39;s transposing the cords <br/>
and transposing the harmony and modes.  Yikes!  It&#39;s hard for me to imagine <br/>
doing, but these folks do it all the time and it&#39;s just second nature.<br/>

we get parts in almost every other key as well.  You learn to do it at<br/>
sight.  A piece we played last night and today had 4 movements, each in a<br/>
different key.  I finally wrote out the transpositions for that one.  I had<br/>
enough to worry about with the rest of the concert that I didn&#39;t need that<br/>
extra difficulty.<br/>

Except that symphony musicians generally have both a Bb and an A clarinet.<br/>
(I think the other one is A, might be C but I don&#39;t think so.)  When they<br/>
get music in the other key, they switch their mouthpiece onto that clarinet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure, but I think they just know that if the music is in C (not<br/>
likely but it&#39;s an easier example),  the Eb alto sax player is going to have<br/>
to play in the key of Ab.  The Bb tenor sax player will have to play in D,<br/>
and so will the clarinet and trumpet.<br/>
