<div id="ygrps-yiv-140575197">We had dinner with my sister tonight, who later sent our parents and me <br/>
the following comment about Lexie.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lexie was very cute in her dress and shoes tonight.  She was even <br/>
walking with some grace, like a young lady.  Then it was too funny when <br/>
I asked her if she liked wearing dresses in the summer for comfort, she <br/>
commented that they were also easier to get in and out of in order to <br/>
play in the mud!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I thought this was not only relevant to our previous conversation <br/>
regarding boys/girls but also pretty darn cute.  <br/>
