<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328026677">As I have been reading the posts of the last week debating unschooling, I <br/>
have to come realize that I really DIDN&quot;T understand what unschooling is.  <br/>
Now I think I have a better idea but I still dont know how to do it - or not <br/>
do it.  You see, my son is this year in 6th grade and this is our first year <br/>
homeschooling.  But I have been trying to research for the past year or so <br/>
and really felt that unschooling is the way I want to go.  Well, so far, we <br/>
havent done anything and he is so bored.  He basically watches TV the entire <br/>
day and occasionally  takes apart a model car and reworks it. And he asks me <br/>
a lot when am I going to start &quot;teaching him anything&quot;. Through the debates <br/>
of the past week or so, I would start to catch a glimpse of what unschooling <br/>
is but then I dont seem to know how to &quot;start&quot;.  Part of the problem is my <br/>
own entrenched thoughts about school. Also, our local homeschool group is SO <br/>
school-at-home oriented and when I go around them, I find myself tending to <br/>
be really anxious and look for<br/>
a curriculum.  What am I missing?  Is unschooling so simple that I am <br/>
stumbling over it? Help!<br/>
Thanks<br/>

It probably took me a good 2 years before I really &quot;got&quot; it.  Even <br/>
though I &quot;got&quot; it, in concept immediately.(did that make sense?)<br/>
anyway, maybe you&#39;re like me, and bits and pieces will flow through <br/>
you, while reading on unschooling.com, or John Holt books, or <br/>
articles about unschooling.... and one day you get that &quot;ah ha&quot; <br/>
moment that was discussed earlier.  I did have a boost in my <br/>
unschooling progress when I started actually posting my thoughts and <br/>
getting responses. <br/>
For now, just appreciate the freedom you have with your son, and talk <br/>
to him openly about his feelings and yours, and you can&#39;t go wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219167940">I don&#39;t often post here, I tend to enjoy my &quot;lurker&quot; status. But what Julie <br/>
has written really hit close to home with me.  <br/>

As I have been reading the posts of the last week debating unschooling, I <br/>
have to come realize that I really DIDN&quot;T understand what unschooling is.  <br/>
Now I think I have a better idea but I still dont know how to do it - or not <br/>
do it.  <br/>
<br/>
We have been homeschooling for a year and a half. I too researched and <br/>
thought everything through. I read all the Homeschooling Handbook type books, <br/>
I read the Unschooling books. I *thought* I had a good grasp on what <br/>
everything was going to be like. MY kids were going to build amazing things <br/>
out of all  I would have available to them. They would read, NO they would <br/>
Devour books with heart and soul! They would use the TV as a tool to <br/>
facilitate their desire to know more about the Inuit or the Amazon Rain <br/>
Forest. I would have little seekers of knowledge, children who would be <br/>
constantly amazing me and showing their Dad how cool this concept really is! <br/>
Instead here is how things truly are; My son decided this summer he wanted to <br/>
go to school! CAN YOU IMAGINE??? what? he wants to go to school? all this <br/>
tumbling around in my mind. But since I wanted my theory of choice in <br/>
education to work, I knew I couldn&#39;t be a hypocrite, I had to allow him that <br/>
choice! Now off he goes with his little backpack to the neighborhood <br/>
kindergarten, every morning at 8:10 returning at 3:45. Well! I say to myself, <br/>
this gives me hours everyday to spend with my daughter, who I just know will <br/>
love all the wonderful boxes of *stuff she can dig through, she will spend <br/>
hours with her nose in a book, we will have discussions galore, trips around <br/>
town.... Ahhh blessed reality! My wonderfully talented daughter, she started <br/>
talking at 9 months, she walked at 10 months, she read at 3, tied her shoes <br/>
at 3 1/2.... She wants to know when she can go outside to swing, how much <br/>
longer she has to read this book, and &quot;MOOMMMMmm, what am *I supposed to do <br/>
with all this junk?&quot; Goodness! I say, read as much of that book as you <br/>
like... do what ever you want with all that... AND ITS NOT JUNK! and you can <br/>
play outside all you want! She just stares at me, and asks &quot;when are you <br/>
going to teach me something?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Also, our local homeschool group is SO <br/>
school-at-home oriented and when I go around them, I find myself tending to <br/>
be really anxious and look for<br/>
a curriculum.  What am I missing?  Is unschooling so simple that I am <br/>
stumbling over it? Help!<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Julie<br/>
<br/>
I feel exactly the same about my husband as you do about your homeschooling <br/>
group! I too feel I must be missing something, how could anything so simple <br/>
be so darn complicated? Julie, you struck a chord with me, I know where you <br/>
are coming from. I think to myself, have I failed, did I not understand the <br/>
concept? How come it works for everyone else? <br/>
Thanks for putting up with my ramble!<br/>

what do I do?  He has checked out books from the library but has gone no <br/>

does? I hope I dont sound like a moron but I am not used to thinking out of <br/>

things if I have too -- even helped replace an engine once -- but to actually <br/>
build something from scratch . . .  hmmmm ....<br/>
<br/>
I think, if it were me and I wanted to follow up, I would try to find <br/>
somebody to show me how to do these things -- the right tools, etc.  Is there <br/>
a hobby shop nearby?  A car club of some sort?  Don&#39;t they have those things? <br/>
 I dunno.  But if you kept looking, you might find someone who could show <br/>
your son the ropes or at least let him hang out.  Hey, maybe the local auto <br/>
repair place is friendly??<br/>
<br/>
Maybe others here can suggest community outlets they have used??<br/>

that I have that schooled mentality as well. I also have an older daughter <br/>
who is a junior in high school but  will not even consider unschooling.  I <br/>
also have a 2 year old and I hope I unlearn a lot as well as learn a lot more <br/>
so that his road will be different.  Anyway, thanks for the input - it will <br/>
definitely help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763393381">Julie and Nancy I felt the same last year so I put him back in <br/>
Kindergarten.  I think I was being too hard on myself and not letting <br/>
go and seeing what happened on a day to day basis.  I also only knew <br/>
of one unschooling person and her kids were much older than mine, so <br/>
I did think I was very much alone.  This time I really made a <br/>
concerted effort to join the local homeschooling group and seek out <br/>
other unschoolers.  I also joined a Moms group and found an <br/>
unschooling mother there with 2 kids the same age as mine.  Now I <br/>
have to slow down and not try and do everything in one day.  I think <br/>
that&#39;s the hardest thing for me, just letting go of the outcome.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go to a woodworker&#39;s supply place (or look online or order a catalog or all <br/>
of those) and just look at what&#39;s there.  Help him find patterns online for <br/>
benches and suchlike, or planters/flower-boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Find some pine scraps (or buy some 1x10 or something, and cut some pieces he <br/>
can work on, and some chisels and a malet.  He could goof around with carving <br/>
even inside the house.  And the pieces he carves could be worked into boxes <br/>
and used, soon.<br/>
<br/>
There are library books galore on woodworking projects, and don&#39;t forget to <br/>
look at historical pieces---maybe a trip to an antique shop or 2nd hand <br/>
furniture store, just to look at dovetail joints in old chests of drawers, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a book to go with your car?  Do you have more than one car, maybe <br/>
one that could use having its spark plugs changed or something actually truly <br/>
useful he could do?  But a repair manual for your car would be great--he <br/>
could read and look at the real thing, and hear the real thing.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have friends who fix cars?  Insurance won&#39;t let him hang out in a big <br/>
repair shop (not a chain, anyway--maybe a filling station one, or private <br/>
shop), but maybe he could start hearing stories.<br/>
<br/>
There are online car-repair sites and discussions and question/answer places. <br/>
  Using google.com or some other websearch engine would find you lots of <br/>
things he could start looking at.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you decided today where you wanted your child to live in 25 years, like <br/>
you picked a town and a neighborhood and getting him there was your goal, <br/>
that would be kind of like what some homeschoolers want.  They want to see <br/>
their child in a master&#39;s degree program (sometimes they know which college) <br/>
or medical or law school, they have a scholarship in mind that had gotten <br/>
them through undergraduate school, they want him married to a blonde woman, <br/>
oh at least 5&#39; 7&quot; and going to church regularly.<br/>
<br/>
That leave a HECK of a margin for error!!  Change by one degree anywhere <br/>
along there and he ends in the &quot;failure&quot; zone.<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, you say &quot;I don&#39;t know what he will be doing, but I <br/>
hope he is confident, unharmed by pressures and un-shamed by his parents, <br/>
that will give you clear goals to accomplish TODAY, which will lead toward <br/>
that goal of giving him a strong, loving, peaceful base from which he can <br/>
grow in any and all directions.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know what your child will need to know in 2012, but if he has a <br/>
peaceful week full of stimulating sights, sounds, smells, tastes, textures <br/>
and is surrounded by patient sweetness, he&#39;s a step closer to whatever it is.<br/>

Thank you so much for your post. I needed to hear that not everyone just took <br/>
to unschooling right off the bat. I mean, I do in theory but putting it in <br/>
practice.....though with all the ideas yall (sorry, from Texas) have come up <br/>
with, I am getting really excited. I think Justin will be too. : )<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, so far, we havent done anything and he is so bored.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So the answer is do something :-) Yes, you&#39;re probably checking off in your<br/>
mind, &quot;No, we can&#39;t do that, it&#39;s not educational,&quot; &quot;Yes, we should do that<br/>
but he&#39;d just say it&#39;s boring.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So do &quot;not-educational&quot; things that he enjoys even if it&#39;s monster truck<br/>
pulls ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And share things you enjoy (avoiding the things you think are more on the<br/>
order of things that would be good for him - at least until you can feel<br/>
confident that you&#39;re sharing as you would a friend and not because he&#39;s not<br/>
complete enough.) Maybe that&#39;s key. Treat him as a friend rather than a<br/>
project.<br/>
<br/>
And turn off the little voice in your head that says &quot;He&#39;s only got 6 more<br/>
years.&quot; Let that be an indefinite period. Give him the freedom to go to<br/>
college or work at 25. And he&#39;ll prepare himself when it&#39;s natural for *him*<br/>
to prepare himself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And he asks me a lot when am I going to start &quot;teaching him anything&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s been told for years that all he has to do is sit back and do what he&#39;s<br/>
told and the education system will take him where he needs to go. Pulling<br/>
that rug out from under him and telling him it&#39;s now his responsibility is<br/>

He needs to rediscover what he&#39;s interested in, to value those interests and<br/>
trust that exploring those things will allow him to go wherever he wants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246897043">Julie each day I learn to let go of something else.  I know that each <br/>
time I open my mouth to say something to either of my kids I start to <br/>
think about how much control I&#39;m trying to have over them.  It&#39;s such <br/>
a balancing act between getting my needs met and my kids needs met as <br/>
well.  I read with interest the whole thing about bedtimes here <br/>
recently and started to let Zak go to bed when he wanted which was <br/>
9:30pm.  What I noticed was: he woke up earlier the next day and was <br/>
a nightmare to deal with all day, jumping on furniture, pushing his <br/>
baby brother over, crying at the drop of a hat; appearing to be over-<br/>
stimulated; not listening to simple requests.  Plus I was exhausted <br/>
because I had no time on my own or with DH without Zak.  So the next <br/>
2 nights we put him to bed the time he would usually go, and he slept <br/>
longer and was in a much better mood the next day.  So DH and I <br/>
talked about how this unschooling thing is wonderful yet I don&#39;t have <br/>
to do everything that everyone suggests.  I can pick and choose what <br/>
I want.  Their education is completely unschooling based and child <br/>
led, but my parenting is not and I&#39;m ok with that.  I need to have <br/>
some sanity.  Maybe that will change in the years to come and as I <br/>
move forward more in this unschooling process.  For today it&#39;s what <br/>
it is.<br/>

here before as having helped others are... Get out. Go<br/>

good info and tips I was getting didn&#39;t out way the<br/>
doubts I had creeping in. It might be hard at first,<br/>
but you might want to consider not going to the<br/>

over to your place instead. We often &#39;import&#39; friends<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was a committed unschooler from before I started.  That didn&#39;t stop me <br/>
from getting freaked out  and making my 12 year old learn to read because <br/>
he had gone beyond my comfort zone.  It didn&#39;t stop me from insisting that <br/>
my 13 year old do some reading, writing, and math every day.  But it did <br/>
bring me back to my senses each time and get me back to trusting my kid to <br/>
learn what he needs when he needs it.  I won&#39;t say I&#39;ll never slip back <br/>
into fear again, but I&#39;m certainly  trying not to.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the TV discussion, for instance.  As a result of it, I&#39;m <br/>
working on turning my mind around on the idea that TV is just a big time <br/>
sink for my son, and I&#39;ve stopped trying to get him to watch less.  I&#39;m <br/>
planning to watch for programs and search the library video collection for <br/>
things that might interest him.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that&#39;s been a real problem for me with unschooling is my own low <br/>
self-esteem (much of which happened in ps).  After being turned down many <br/>
times when I&#39;ve offered projects, etc. that I thought might interest him, I <br/>
gradually stopped offering.  I think this probably contributed to my <br/>
frustrations over the years with a kid who didn&#39;t *seem* to be interested <br/>
in anything.  I would say to anyone contemplating unschooling to work on <br/>
your own self-esteem.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Julie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes you do need to get in there, try stuff and learn to *give it value.*<br/>
<br/>
You don¹t have to do or know it all though.  These are two great subjects.<br/>
Start at what ever level you are comfortable with.  Find a project that has<br/>
a real connection and value to both of your lives. It can (and probably<br/>
should) be as simple as ³building² a door stop (a single piece of wood cut<br/>
into a wedgie) that has real function in your home. This simple project is<br/>
ripe with understanding of: layout, manipulation of raw material,<br/>
physical/spatial interaction, how wood cutting tools function (where does<br/>
all that saw dust come from anyway?), and if you care to-wood finishes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Warning &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the rest of this post goes into a me me me post<br/>
the kind of which I often hate reading.  It has a point though &lt;g&gt; Skip to<br/>
the last paragraph if you can&#39;t bear it.<br/>
<br/>
I was blessed with a father who had only the most rudimentary understanding<br/>
of these two subjects.  Wood working started for me with projects no more<br/>
complicated than trimming the bottom of doors to fit over the new carpet.  I<br/>
went on to build simple boxes that my mom just loved (and which she still<br/>
does). And passing my parent¹s abilities, to build cabinetry in my teen<br/>
years. My auto mechanics abilities started by maintaining the fluid levels<br/>
in the cars and changing a radiator hose. And I slowly gained greater<br/>
understanding as starters, alternators and water pumps needed replacement<br/>
with the knowledge gained from neighbors and the guys at the auto parts<br/>
store.  I was lucky enough to have a mentor in the form of a neighbor with 3<br/>
kids and 5 cars that always needed repairs (the cars, not the kids) ­ my<br/>
head was always welcome under any of those hoods.  Don¹t underestimate<br/>
finding and developing a relationship with a good auto parts store either.<br/>
<br/>
35 years later a significant, enjoyable, part of my professional life<br/>
involves woodworking. And I shake my head when a friend pays $50 to have a<br/>
$5 thermostat replaced. It¹s hard to describe the pride and satisfaction<br/>
returning the engine I have repaired to my car and having it motor our<br/>
family about town, just as its designers intended. Or to visit my folks and<br/>
see the cabinets that I built still house the first dishwasher they ever<br/>
owned.  <br/>
<br/>
If you¹d mentioned electronics instead of woodworking and auto mechanics,<br/>
I¹d tell you about how my dad, who didn¹t know much about those new fangled<br/>
transistors, started buying me those little kits from Radio Shack when I was<br/>
10 years old.  And how that lead to my parents spending what was for them a<br/>
*huge* amount of money to buy a HeathKit Television set for me to assemble<br/>
when I was 15 years old (I was in heaven!)  The trust in my abilities and<br/>
the growth in my self esteem represented by that event stays with me to this<br/>
day.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep mind that it is possible to douse the fire of a budding interest by<br/>
dumping *too much* stuff, information etc. on it.  As a kid I was so thirsty<br/>
for these experiences and knowledge-I asked for and sought out these<br/>
activities. You want to open the possibilities and nurture, not smother.<br/>
This seems much easier to keep in check when you&#39;re learning and discovering<br/>
side by side. Today my son and I are learning about microprocessors because<br/>
of his continued interest in robotics. (again I am in heaven!)<br/>
<br/>
All of these abilities of mine grew out of some excellent parenting. Even<br/>
though I attended public school, my folks never let it interfere with my<br/>
learning by supplying the opportunity, resources, love and support, and<br/>
value for the things I wanted to do and know about.  They bristle when I<br/>
tell them that they were homeschoolers and didn¹t know it.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

coordination, spacial relationship, etc.) toys was a<br/>
distributor cap and spark plug wires.  My idea. <br/>
Cleaned &#39;em up first.<br/>
<br/>
Things he can really do: <br/>
<br/>
Does he have a bicycle?  It needs maintenance.<br/>
Mechanical, real, maintenance. <br/>
<br/>
He can top off the water in the radiator add<br/>
antifreeze. He should know that it is poison and how<br/>
to store and dispose of it and which critters are<br/>
likely to consume it and how. He can check the oil,<br/>
and add new....make sure he knows what kind to put in.<br/>
<br/>
he can check the tire air pressure and make sure it is<br/>
at an optimum level.  He can learn what all of the<br/>
dash board stuff is for.  He can make sure you have<br/>
speakers that work in the interior of the vehicle. he<br/>
can learn to change a tire and make sure that there<br/>
are the right tools and a good spare available in the<br/>
vehicle.......<br/>
<br/>
He can fix a lawn mower.  He can build a go cart.  He<br/>
can rebuild a small (3 or 5 hrs power) motor....and<br/>
attach it to something like a go-cart or ?<br/>
<br/>
Household<br/>
He can change the propane bottles when you show him<br/>
how.<br/>
He can plan and cook almost anything and clean up from<br/>
it. <br/>
He can help make sure you always have all that is<br/>
needed for disaster preparedness that is appropriate<br/>
to your area...<br/>
<br/>
He can build shelves and tables and benches and<br/>
picture frames and well, anything that his imagination<br/>
will encompass and he can get hold of the materials<br/>
for....or improvise...<br/>
<br/>
Tools  probably he already know swhat he wants, but<br/>
here are a few........hammer, nails, hand saw, pocket<br/>
knife, flat head and Phillip&#39;s head screw drivers,<br/>
utility scissors, wire cutter, wrenches, <br/>
c clamps,....from there you can get really elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
When the boys needed good tools we found some sets at<br/>
pawn shops. Good tools can be really expensive, but<br/>
best get good, real, ones so you don&#39;t have to replace<br/>
them so many times.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun...it is GREAT to have a DS who does things.<br/>
It is SO helpful. You are so lucky to have a DS who<br/>
wants to do that stuff. I was blessed with four such<br/>
sons.<br/>
<br/>
Sharon   oh, and there is lots more I forgot to<br/>
mention, birdhouses, bat houses, radios,..........<br/>

Maybe you could find an auto junk yard where you could find parts,<br/>
transmissions, fuel pumps, whatever, inexpensively,  find a repair manual<br/>
and let him go.  Maybe the man/woman at the junk yard could use someone<br/>
to pull parts off old cars when a customer needed them.  Or something,<br/>
maybe? <br/>
When my little boy wanted to build things out of wood we soon discovered<br/>
it was really hard for him to use the hand saw to cut through a 2 by 4. <br/>
We went to the local mill and found   &quot;stickers&quot;.  They are thin, about<br/>
1/4 in. boards about  4-5ft long and easy to saw with a hand saw.  They<br/>
are used between lumber when stacking.  The mills usually just burn or<br/>
chip them.  My son made tool boxes, bird feeders, bird houses, all kinds<br/>
of things.  They are rough and need sanding but are good for wood burning<br/>
projects too.  <br/>
They wouldn&#39;t work well for book shelves and the like but if you&#39;re<br/>
looking for a place to start, the mills usually don&#39;t charge for them. <br/>

My Mom (are you sick of hearing about her yet??) volunteers at the local elem <br/>

She strips, repaints, replaces screws and brackets, adds decorative touches, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
They love it!!!!!!!!  She volunteers for one 1st grade teacher and now the <br/>
other teachers are bringing her projects to do for them.<br/>
<br/>

would be someplace by you that could use a volunteer handyman or Mr. Fixit -- <br/>

Build something useful to your home. For me it would<br/>
be a step stool. For you it might be a bird house or a<br/>
shelf. <br/>
Find someone, a friend, a neighbor, and see if they<br/>
will let your son hangout. Stand outside on a Saturday<br/>
morning and listen for a saw. Then go knock on the<br/>
door. <br/>
One of the great things about unschooling for me has<br/>
been unschooling myself. It took a few years of<br/>
deschooling first, getting all that school mentality<br/>
out, and I still fall back into it every once in a<br/>
while. Then I noticed how many things I did for myself<br/>
because I enjoyed it that the kids joined in on. The<br/>
more I relaxed, the more the kids popped their heads<br/>
out of their turtle shells. I think they were at first<br/>
afraid to stretch themselves for fear I would return<br/>
to &quot;school at home mommy.&quot; <br/>
Oh my how we&#39;ve grown.<br/>

every second? Saturday of the month.  If you live near one of those.  The<br/>
classes are free, but you pay for materials.  It&#39;s not too expensive and<br/>
they build things like bat houses, etc.<br/>
Maybe other lumber yards or home improvement places do too?<br/>
<br/>
Also, you might want to call around to the universities and art galleries<br/>
and museums and get on their mailing list for kid&#39;s programs.  These are<br/>
usually just in the summer though.  If there is a hobby shop in your<br/>
town, maybe they have a bulletin board  where different clubs put up<br/>
info.  We found a great rock hounding club this way.  <br/>
I would look in the yellow pages and call cabinet makers, furniture<br/>
repair places, etc.  <br/>
It couldn&#39;t hurt.  <br/>

I went through this with flute making ( of all things ) and we finally<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I forgot all  about this during the TV discussion, but that&#39;s how my son<br/>
learned to tell time.<br/>
He had two or three shows he just had to see and I wasn&#39;t always faithful<br/>
about reminding him of the time.  He figured it out  entirely on his own<br/>
when he was eight. <br/>

 If, on the other hand, you say &quot;I don&#39;t know what he will be doing,  but<br/>
I <br/>
 hope he is confident, unharmed by pressures and un-shamed by his <br/>
parents, <br/>
 that will give you clear goals to accomplish TODAY, which will lead <br/>
toward <br/>
 that goal of giving him a strong, loving, peaceful base from which  he<br/>
can <br/>
 grow in any and all directions.<br/>

Lovely words, thank you Sandra.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132177918">Awwwww....do you have both parents? Does Papa stay in<br/>
the same (cage?) with the Mama and Babies? Do you have<br/>
a nesting box? How do you set that up?  Do the parents<br/>
have to grow up together? Or can a stranger bird be<br/>
introduced? We have one female cockatiel. I am<br/>
constantly surprised at how much personality she has.<br/>
She is a really sweet bird.<br/>
