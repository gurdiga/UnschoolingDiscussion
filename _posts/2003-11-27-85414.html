 </span></blockquote>I have 6, almost 5 and 3.5.  We like Monopoly, Jr., Chess, Uno (not really <br/>
a board game) and lots of games on the computer. I would really recommend <br/>
computer games in addition to the board games. We&#39;ve been getting more into <br/>
this, and the kids are really enjoying it. Zoombinis has been a HUGE hit <br/>
with ALL of them! Also Magic School Bus, Liberty&#39;s Kids and Carmen Sandiego.<br/>
<br/>
Bought 3 games for xmas: Cranium Cariboo, for the 3.5 yo, like a treasure <br/>
hunt game; S&#39;math for the almost 5; and Settlers of Cataan for the 6 <br/>
yo--geography, strategy, you name it, probably slightly over her head, but <br/>
I think she&#39;ll catch on pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Writing/ Creativity--have you tried Cranium Cadoo? It has all kinds of <br/>
creative aspects to it. Pretty cool, though it helps if they are readers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939377658">This is just what my kids have been and are into game wise.<br/>
<br/>
Chess, checkers, chinese checkers, triominoes, sorry, monopoly, scrabble,<br/>
trouble, yahtzee, connect four and uno.<br/>
<br/>
They also have but don&#39;t play as often, battle ship, chutes & ladders, guess<br/>
who, junior scrabble, air hockey, kerplunk and  memory.<br/>
<br/>
We also have games for younger kids like candy land, go fish, spot the dog,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I bought the kids cadoo for Christmas. They play it at a friends and really<br/>
like it. I&#39;m also thinking of backgammon for Joseph. He was asking about it<br/>
awhile ago. I&#39;m looking into some different board games too so I&#39;ll be<br/>
watching to see what everyone else suggests too. There are some games that I<br/>
never even played. Like Life and Stratego to name two that just came up with<br/>
friends of mine. Do they even still make stratego??<br/>

Many of these games are award-winning, and they have no winner -- instead, <br/>
the players have to work together to complete their objective.  A nice change of <br/>

I&#39;m glad someon recommended that.  It&#39;s a really good game.  Not cheap.  $40 <br/>
probably, but you&#39;ll forget that pretty quickly.  And if you have lots of <br/>
friends to play or other kids, you&#39;ll want the expansion set so more can play at <br/>
once.   Probably $20.  Suck it up.  It will be worth it.<br/>

I think this is ond of the problems with people having all those old-time <br/>
games, Monopoly, Parcheesi, Candyland, because they&#39;re cheap.  $10 or less, or <br/>
already at your house.<br/>
<br/>
If you want better quality games, you have to spend more money.   For cheap <br/>
you end up with noisy plastic crazy stuff like Hungry, Hungry Hippo.   And you <br/>
might want to get some of that too, but don&#39;t expect it to create nearly as <br/>
many learning moments as something like Settlers of Catan.<br/>

Actually, if you&#39;re not familiar with the whole Top Secret Adventures <br/>
series (they come in the mail every month with word puzzles and stuff <br/>
based on different countries), they might like that.  Not a board <br/>
game, but really fun.  Every page you do gives you a clue, and you <br/>
get to figure out who the mystery person is once you&#39;ve figured out <br/>
all the clues.  They might like a gift subscription to that.  <br/>

easy to keep track of, or at least there was a theme.  One year it was pouches <br/>
(purses--drawstring bags).  Some people got better purses than others, and some <br/>
were more personalized, and down near the end of the list there were lots the <br/>
same and not as fancy, but it was probably much easier to keep track of.<br/>
<br/>
(The reason I know that was that one day hanging out in the library at the <br/>
university waiting for a friend, I happened on a set of books that contained the <br/>
bookkeeping records of Elizabeth I, by year, with expenses and salaries of <br/>
staff, and I started looking through Christmases to see what kind of stuff she <br/>
gave.  Each year had a list of who got what and what it cost.<br/>
