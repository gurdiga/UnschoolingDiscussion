<div><font size="2">Teri, this is so reassuring!&nbsp; My 2 are 14 months apart, 
which might be alright but I suffered from PND with no1 (which in a roundabout 
way was why I got pg so fast) and I don&#39;t think she got the attention she 
deserved.&nbsp; I have a much more &#39;adaptive&#39; relationship with no2, although 
I&#39;ve been working hard to catch up with no1, it&#39;s really difficult with 2 
around.&nbsp; I&#39;m glad to hear that it will work out!!&nbsp; </font></div>
