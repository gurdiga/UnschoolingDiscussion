<div id="ygrps-yiv-428297911">Yes, Mary,  I also read your article,  very nice,  I will be checking out the book you spoke of it, sounds alot like my son.<br/>
 <br/>
Did you guys get to the winter Olympics at all?  Did your son get into them?   I see you live near there.  My cousin is Eric Bergoust, the freestyle ski-jumper, he lives out there too.  I wanted to go so bad, but didn&#39;t work out.  <br/>
Take Care,<br/>

Thanks, Rue. I&#39;ve turned off my list mail for awhile so I can get a <br/>
better handle on everything else in the whole wide world. ;-) Karin <br/>
mentioned to me that you commented on my article so I&#39;m popping in to <br/>
say hi. I&#39;m glad you liked it and I hope your friend sees the light <br/>
as far as unschooling her child.<br/>

<br/>
Confession time. We left town for the Olympics! I feel bad when I <br/>
hear how badly others wanted to go. We were pretty spooked by the <br/>
9/11 thing and intimidated by the huge crowds that were invading our <br/>
small town. We decided to lay low in the Florida sunshine instead. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I saw your cousin in a photo shoot right across the street from me. <br/>
My neighbor is Fuzz...(can&#39;t think of his last name right now) and he <br/>
too was an Olympian. He now works for the team and was running the <br/>
shoot that day. It was very cool to watch. Many of those cool aerial <br/>
shots of skiers and snowboarders taken against the blue sky are <br/>
actually taken during the summer on a trampoline! We learned lots <br/>
that day. <br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Glad you liked my article.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577860907">Have you checked to see if your library has a subscription?<br/>
That&#39;s how I read it, since I don&#39;t get HEM at the moment, either.<br/>
If the library doesn&#39;t have it, maybe a large bookstore like Borders or<br/>
Barnes and Noble carries it and you could either read the article there at<br/>
the bookstore or just buy a copy.<br/>

there yet.<br/>
 If Mary&#39;s isn&#39;t one of them, and if she wants to, I&#39;ll put in on a page and <br/>
link it to my website.  She let me do that with something she wrote on video <br/>
games.  That is here:<br/>
