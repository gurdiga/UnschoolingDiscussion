<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364520348">Need concrete suggestions about how to keep records while <br/>
unschooling, just in case I need them for legal reasons.<br/>
I (being public school taught) cannot figure out how to write down <br/>
the things my daughter is learning/doing at home each day in a way <br/>
that &quot;officials&quot; will consider in an equal catagory with what the <br/>
public school teaches. (My daughter is 10 and has Asperger&#39;s, BTW.)<br/>
Can anyone tell me what a record page/portfolio should look like or <br/>
how it should be set up?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

It might help us to answer if we knew a little more of your concerns. Can you <br/>
share with us?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870258118">Hi! Thanks for responding!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is very talkative and imaginative. She likes to tell <br/>
stories....all day long!! :) She likes to read, but she has <br/>
dysgraphia and cannot write well. She has Asperger&#39;s and often can&#39;t <br/>
understand directions (verbal or written). She doesn&#39;t do well in <br/>
math either. I am not concerned as to how fast she learns, but she <br/>
receives disability and periodic re-evaluations are necessary. Her <br/>
last evaluation was recently, and the psychologist says she <br/>
hasn&#39;t &quot;progressed&quot; in her academics and wants me to do all this <br/>
major &quot;school-at-home&quot; stuff that I don&#39;t really agree with. (I <br/>
think learning little by little is good for her and gives her self-<br/>
confidence.) But how do I justify days when she wants to listen to <br/>
Chinese music, wants to play video games, and wants to tell me <br/>
stories? How do I write that down in records? Do I have to say she <br/>
did such-n-such, beginning at such-n-such a time and ending at such-<br/>
n-such a time? How do you fit unschooling activities into public <br/>
school jargon and subject areas?<br/>
<br/>

averages make smooth curvew, in the hands of mathematician graph-makers.  <br/>
Individual progress has spurts and plateaus.<br/>

they want you to do to get the money.<br/>

Why are you taking money from the government?  Can you afford not to?<br/>

Here&#39;s how Carol Narigon described her homeschooling and maybe you can adapt <br/>
this for some of your reporting:<br/>
