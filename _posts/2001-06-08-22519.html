<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784376333">.) I was 16 at the time and old<br/>
enough to legally be left to babysit other families overnight or for more<br/>
than one day, so I think I was capable of taking care of myself and<br/>
siblings.<br/>
<br/>
depending on what state you are in, leaving children overnight with someone under 18 can be considered abandonment according to CPS, irregardless of the capability of the teenager. The laws vary so greatly from state to state, it can be difficult assessing what is &quot;acceptable&quot;<br/>
