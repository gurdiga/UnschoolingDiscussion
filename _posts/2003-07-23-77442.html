&quot;might&quot; get hurt. Personally, i don&#39;t tell them that, as I figure they <br/>
already know it, unless it&#39;s fairly serious or something.  Both my girls <br/>
love rollercoasters, climbing trees, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I have often told my children that we could hide in our house and do <br/>
nothing to help protect ourselves from getting hurt, but the reality <br/>
is--if we did that a plane my drop from the sky and kill us as we were <br/>
sitting on the couch.  I&#39;d rather get out in the world and do things, <br/>
fun things, and simply try to m inimize the risk.  For instance, we wear <br/>
seatbelts, make sure the rollercoaster safety bars, etc. are firmly <br/>
placed around us, and think about what else we can do to make an <br/>
activity safer.  But there is no completely safe so might as well have <br/>
fun!  <br/>
<br/>
I also often wonder how much of our own biases we are putting on our <br/>
children.  If we expect little girls to be sweet and gentle and afraid <br/>
of rough and tumble stuff, then maybe we treat them that way and IF <br/>
their personality matches or they are more moldable children then <br/>
comply.  If we expect boys to be rough and tumble children who like to <br/>
gather snails and bugs, then we treat them rough and tumble like, and <br/>
again, this is what they are.  Nature is powerful.  Maybe those with <br/>
children whose personalities go along with the sexual stereotypes of <br/>
their sex are getting a lot of help from their parents expectations and <br/>
treatment of them.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, you could be right but I think standing by and watching your child do <br/>
something they VERY likely are going to get hurt by isn&#39;t very good parenting <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
The son rode the big wheel down the slide, it skidded off the surface onto <br/>
the pavement, he had a huge skinned mark going all the way down his back on <br/>
every little backbone spot.  He got hurt.  It was a very clear possibility that <br/>
this would happen.  I guess I could have just taken him off the slide or yanked <br/>
him off the big wheel and taken that or tried harder to reason with him but <br/>
having experience with my child, the only real thing I experienced that worked <br/>
was to tell them when something might end up wrong and they could be hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Was I instilling fear in them of scary dangerous things?  Maybe but it was <br/>
never my intent.  I believe I was merely providing them with information that <br/>
they might not have thought of beforehand.  After all it didn&#39;t seem to affect <br/>
two of the children in anyway concerning physical stuff.  The girls never were <br/>
in a position of riding a big wheel down the slide, that situation was with my <br/>
son, who did it, did it only once. But he also tried riding it down a huge <br/>
flight of steep stairs, off dirt piles, anything with any height to it and it <br/>
was a huge adventure for him.  He got some scrapes and broken bones along the <br/>
way from all his adventures in life but they were all from choices he made.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the differences were not pointed out to any of the children and it&#39;s <br/>
only in hindsight that I really noticed there were differences and that the boys <br/>
seemed to have gotten a lot more injuries, broken bones and also had a lot <br/>
more adventures than the girls, or I should say PHYSICAL type adventures.  My <br/>
daughter likes to travel and has traveled over the summers since she was about 13 <br/>
or maybe 14, different Countries, different places, eats LOTS of different <br/>
foods, enjoys it greatly.  My sons, they don&#39;t like to venture far from home at <br/>
all and really don&#39;t enjoy exploring new places, culture and foods either.  <br/>
Maybe that&#39;s because I always asked my daughter is she were sure she really <br/>
wanted to be in ______ for _____ days or because the talk of all the differences <br/>
scared them away from that.  I don&#39;t think either way instilled a fear in my <br/>
boys or girls, I think it was simply their personalities that led them to <br/>
explore the adventures they&#39;ve encountered in life.<br/>
<br/>
So I think it&#39;s basically the personality of the person.  They were all four <br/>
raised with the same &quot;warnings&quot; and same surroundings and same abilities and <br/>
same opportunities, it was all based on ultimately their own choices and <br/>
desires.  Their personal differences and I guess it&#39;s the age old question as to <br/>
whether it has to do with their gender or just simply their personalities.  If <br/>
you judge by my family it would seem on the surface to be about gender because <br/>
it&#39;s evenly divided.  I do know lots of circumstances that would dispute that <br/>
though.  I can only give evidence of what I&#39;ve experienced in my family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, it was pretty clear when I said if you ride that big wheel down that <br/>
slide that he might get hurt.  I did point out that he could slide right out <br/>
into the parking lot and land on the rough hard asphalt.  Whether or not he had <br/>
thought of it being a potentially harmful situation, he now KNEW it could be <br/>
and the decision was left up to him whether it was a great enough adventure that <br/>
he would risk whatever injury he might encounter.  I think I WAS giving him <br/>
the information that he needed, so that he could decide.  Getting hurt isn&#39;t <br/>
pleasant, some mind it more than others.  Sometimes it&#39;s worth the risk for the <br/>
pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Now that being said, if he had wanted to do a swan dive off a platform 50 <br/>
feet in the air and couldn&#39;t swim, I think I would have to do more than have a <br/>
conversation about the possibility of injury.  Jumping off the side of the pool <br/>
to see what happens with me close by would be a choice they could make if they <br/>
really wanted to see what could happen.  Thankfully they could all swim but <br/>
any situation that might be similar in danger.<br/>

skinned knees - I always had them. It was just me.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter was the same way and at 18 STILL gets burned and <br/>
scraped and cut and bruised a lot - because she is a real risk taker. <br/>
Telling her something was dangerous would make her more likely to do it.<br/>
<br/>
My middle daughter has probably never had a skinned knee. More likely <br/>
to have carpal tunnel &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest is banged and bruised all the time - she rides horses and <br/>
plays soccer and dances  - but isn&#39;t a risk-taker, just an active <br/>
outdoorsey athletic kind of kid.<br/>

It doesn&#39;t have to be MOM who treats the boys and girls differently - <br/>
your older ones were in school and in all kinds of activities, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter says she was born a feminist - and partly that is <br/>
because her temperament was so much more like how boys were expected to <br/>
behave so she was aware early on that she was different. She gloried in <br/>
it (I&#39;m talking about even as 5 year old, by the way) and she was very <br/>
alert to situations where she was being expected to behave differently <br/>
&quot;as a girl.&quot;<br/>

Same here. My girl will definitely be MORE likely to do something if I warn her about it. Although several times my warnings have resulted in pain, so she&#39;s more likely to respect my advice now as important information, not me trying to be controlling!<br/>
I had skinned knees my entire childhood. I&#39;ve got a permanent scar on each knee too, one from pre-teen days and one from adulthood. I don&#39;t learn too fast, or I just don&#39;t have a very high fear factor. Oh well.<br/>

our daughter. He still isn&#39;t keen on slides, merry-go-rounds, swings, <br/>
etc. and meanwhile our daughter is begging me for rock climbing <br/>
lessons. These are their basic personalities though, the way they <br/>
came wired. At the age of 2, my son wouldn&#39;t go near a swimming pool <br/>
with a 10 foot pole. At the age of 12 months, my toddling daughter <br/>
was flinging herself into the deep end.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, and that&#39;s what we try to do as well. Life is risky, the <br/>
best we can do is make sure we do things as safely as possible, <br/>
within reason. I think it&#39;s important to have a healthy respect for <br/>
your own mortality. My greatest fear with my daughter is that she&#39;ll <br/>
be exactly like me (I was thinking I was bulletproof until I was <br/>
about 25). She just seems so fearless. Then again, maybe she&#39;ll lead <br/>
a charmed life like me and never get seriously injured or killed in <br/>
all of her escapades. Lord knows, I&#39;ve been just plain lucky on more <br/>
than a few occasions. I hope I can pass some of my accumulated wisdom <br/>
on as far as safety goes and maybe she won&#39;t be quite so foolhardy.<br/>

&gt; My oldest daughter says she was born a feminist - and partly that is<br/>
&gt; because her temperament was so much more like how boys were expected to<br/>
&gt; behave so she was aware early on that she was different. She gloried in<br/>
&gt; it (I&#39;m talking about even as 5 year old, by the way) and she was very<br/>
&gt; alert to situations where she was being expected to behave differently<br/>
&gt; &quot;as a girl.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lexie glorifies in being a girl!  She loves being a rough and tumble <br/>
girl.   I remember a month or so ago we were at a gym and Janene&#39;s shoes <br/>
fell between the slats in the bleachers.  I asked Lexie and Carissa to <br/>
get them out and Lexie and Carissa, who have not had a lot of <br/>
experiences with school bleachers looked at them for a minute perplexed, <br/>
trying to figure out how to do it.  Then Lexie exclaimed in a bright <br/>
confident voice--&quot;We can do it, Girls can do ANYTHING!&quot; and Carissa <br/>
confidently added &quot;Yep, Girls are POWERFUL!&quot; and off they went to get <br/>
the shoes.  I looked up at two young adult men (in their early 20&#39;s) who <br/>
had observed this, and both had this wonderful expression on their <br/>
faces, they had obviously so enjoyed this exchange.  I smiled at them <br/>
and said something like &quot;there&#39;s nothing like a good strong self <br/>
esteem!&quot; and they nodded and commented how great it was to hear the <br/>
girls so confident in themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
I think as homeschoolers we can raise our children in a more gender <br/>
nutural way.  At least that is my goal.  If nothing else comes of this <br/>
unschooling, my wish is for my children to be confident and sure of <br/>
their abilities to do anything, to learn anything, to become anything, <br/>
and so that&#39;s probably why I rarely tell them they might hurt <br/>
themselves.  That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t talk with them about risks that <br/>
might be involved in a venture, but I would never want to, even with my <br/>
body langauge, discourage them from trying something.<br/>
<br/>
Last month I was at park day when a ball was stuck on the roof of a <br/>
shelter.  I noticed one of the boys climb up to retrieve it, and that <br/>
the other parents there had noticed as well.  One of the dads made his <br/>
way over to the shelter and inquired quietly if the kids needed any <br/>
assistance, but they didn&#39;t so he just watched.  The other parents were <br/>
observing but none seemed remotely concerned.  I thought about how this <br/>
situation would have been different had this been a group of schooled <br/>
children, and I could picture the parents or teachers running to the <br/>
shelter in fear, yelling for the child to get down, he might hurt <br/>
himself.  Instead the adults were simply watching, ready to give a hand <br/>
if one was needed but marvalling at the ability of the boys.  Another <br/>
boy shimmied up the pole and climbed up, simply to prove he could, and <br/>
then slid down again.  It was wonderful to watch him do that, it made me <br/>
wish for about 20 years to come off me so Ic oudl do it too, it looked <br/>
so fun.  Finally the ball was retrieved and the play was over and the <br/>
kids all came down off the shelter, all perfectly safe and sound.  Not <br/>
one person said &quot;be careful&quot;--uh, I hate that phrase, like the child is <br/>
purposely going to NOT be careful?  I always want to say, when someone <br/>
says &quot;Drive carefully&quot;, &quot;thanks for reminding me, otherwise I might have <br/>
driven crazily, speeding and running stop signs and the like.&quot;  I think <br/>
this goes back to trusting the children, something I am so constantly <br/>
working on doing.  Of course the kids will be careful, why would they <br/>
not be.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not surprised.  Personally I always talked my way out of tickets.... <br/>
 I remember once I was going 85 in a 55 mph zone and I had been with a <br/>
friend the night before on his motor cycle so my license was in the back <br/>
pocket of my jeans I wore, which were in a laundry basket, at the <br/>
bottom, next to me (I was on the way to the mountains to camp.)  The <br/>
laundry basket was on the front seat, so Icouldn&#39;t get into the grove <br/>
compartment.  The cops pulled me over and asked for these two items. <br/>
 One was standing next to me, the other at the rear of the car, and I <br/>
realized he was laughing.  I realized that point that he was reading my <br/>
bumper stickers, one said &quot;Women are natural leaders, you&#39;re following <br/>
one now&quot; and the other said &quot;TGIF, Thank God I&#39;m Female.&quot;  He called the <br/>
other cop back to him and pointed these out to him and they bothed <br/>
laughed for a while.  Then they both came up to me and said thanks for <br/>
giving them a good laugh and could I please slow down at least until <br/>
they were no longer in site.  They never had me get out my <br/>
documentation, they just chuckled.  I still have my TGIF frame on my <br/>
car, and I still get chuckles over it.  <br/>
<br/>
However, my 94 year old grandmother got a ticket a few years ago for <br/>
going 55 or 60 in a 25 mph zone.  I am and was impressed with this and <br/>
still give her a hard time about her speeding.  She is so spry and <br/>
healthy and happy and alive, and I can tell you that I know she enjoyed <br/>
roller coasters when she was younger--just a few years ago.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Not <br/>
one person said &quot;be careful&quot;--uh, I hate that phrase, like the child is <br/>
purposely going to NOT be careful?  I always want to say, when someone <br/>
says &quot;Drive carefully&quot;, &quot;thanks for reminding me, otherwise I might have <br/>

<br/>
I try not to say those things to others too much, or maybe I still say them <br/>
but I hear myself.<br/>
<br/>
But when people say it to me, I don&#39;t mind.  When I&#39;m leaving on a car trip <br/>
out of town, Keith always checklists me at the end:  water?  caffein? snacks?  <br/>
be careful.<br/>
<br/>
And when friends of mine say &quot;drive carefully&quot; I see it more as a kind of <br/>
blessing on the trip, like I have my own carefulness and theirs added to it.  <br/>
Keith often says &quot;Be safe,&quot; and in that wording it really IS just a straight out <br/>
blessing.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel like if five people told me to be careful I WOULD be more careful, <br/>
because in my head their voices would be there, and I would remember that they <br/>
cared enough about me to be there when I was leaving and give me some special <br/>
energy for the trip.  They could&#39;ve been in watching TV and eating, but instead <br/>
they gave me a &quot;fare well&quot; (another blessing which means just about the same <br/>
as the others).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Pam, another post to throw me into childhood.;-) The above example IS my <br/>
mother. We lived on a culdusac and I wasn&#39;t allowed to get the ball if it went <br/>
into the street, without asking my mom to come out to the curb and watch. To <br/>
this day everyone still teases her about not letting little Rhonda (she&#39;s <br/>
Rhonda also, so hence that makes me little Rhonda even though I seriously outweigh <br/>
her, lol) cross the street until she was 12.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I am opposite with many things Kass and Kree do. When we joined our <br/>
first HS group, there is a large tree at the park where we met and the twins eyes <br/>
just sparkled when they saw that tree. You could almost see the wheels <br/>
turning as they were calculating their every step, before they ever reached the <br/>
tree. I was caught a little off guard when several people mentioned that the kids <br/>
weren&#39;t really supposed to climb it. They could get hurt. HUH? I smiled and <br/>
said, &quot;I guess that&#39;s why we have great insurance.&quot; I gave them the go ahead as <br/>
they stopped dashing for the tree when other mom&#39;s protested. The twins are <br/>
famous for their lack of fear. They have always been adrenaline junkies and are <br/>
dying to turn 12 (in 33 days, the countdown continues) so they can go <br/>
sky-diving with one of their Karate instructors. We aren&#39;t careless mind you, we <br/>
always make sure whatever they do, they have safety gear and know the best way to <br/>
fall and what not, but we don&#39;t caution them to the extent that my mom did. I <br/>
have often wondered why I don&#39;t freak when she did. Of course she freaks when <br/>
they tell her their newest quests, but they always respond with, &quot;Come on <br/>
Grandma, do you really think Mom and Dad would let us if they didn&#39;t know we could <br/>
handle it?&quot; She gives me the eye and the twins crack up. I don&#39;t know if it <br/>
will make a difference in how they live their lives when they are parents, but <br/>
it is odd that we are at opposite ends of the &quot;OMG it&#39;s not safe&quot; spectrum, my <br/>
mom and I.<br/>
