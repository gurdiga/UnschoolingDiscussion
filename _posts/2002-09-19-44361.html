children do need medication to function, even in an unschooled environment.<br/>

The problem is that children end up getting hung with the ADHD label if<br/>
their behavior falls outside of the accepted norm. The fact is that some<br/>
ADHD kids are actually suffering from other problems (juvenile bipolar<br/>
disorder, allergies to foods and environmental factors, allergies to<br/>
vaccines, early onset pschzo-affective disorder, Touretts, etc)  and the<br/>
teachers know that it will be easier to medicate and zombie these kids than<br/>
to try and convince someone to examine their behaviors and treat them<br/>
accurately.<br/>
<br/>
It is far easier for them to do their job, to push these kids into the<br/>
cookie cutter mold of the diploma factory, than to do the right thing,<br/>
mainly to get them proper medical care and real diagnosises that are based<br/>
upon a doctor&#39;s careful and caring examination, testing and observation.<br/>
<br/>
I am not anti medication when it is actually necessary. I am vehmently<br/>
opposed to anyone medicating a child who does not need it. Further I really<br/>
hate when it is assumed that any parent who chooses to medicate is harming<br/>
their child just because it is unpopular in the opinion of your peers to<br/>
medicate. Whether they were coerced or they actually chose to medicate the<br/>
child it is insensitive to insinuate that their decision is wrong because it<br/>
has been wrong for others.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like having to medicate my child. It&#39;s theraputic benefit is minimal<br/>
at best. But I conceed that there is a problem and I am on a mission to find<br/>
out what that problem is so that he may live the most normal, positive,<br/>
loving existance possible. I love my child. So I keep looking and I try new<br/>
medications because refusing to do so would be neglecting him, no matter how<br/>
DSS sees it. Now, I&#39;ll jump down and give someone else a chance on the soap<br/>

I think someone is feeding you a big huge line of bull here in SC. They cannot take him away from you for refusing to give him medications (especially once you have him at home), you do not have to have the school&#39;s permission to take him out and homeschool him. If you&#39;d like to e-mail me privately, I can tell you how to do it now without anyone being able to say a thing! This is ridiculous that they are treating you this way!<br/>

children do need medication to function, even in an unschooled environment. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;-=-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s too broad a statement for someone who&#39;s just new to unschooling to <br/>
make.<br/>
Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
The word in question is &quot;function.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, if a child needs medication to keep from being in tears or from tearing <br/>
the place up or from hurting himself or others, that&#39;s a &quot;function&quot; item.<br/>
<br/>
But as to &quot;plain&quot; ADD or ADHD, in the absence of the classroom, there is most <br/>
likely NO need and no sense in quieting his movements or zippiness or &quot;lack <br/>
of attention,&quot; because kids WILL pay attention to what&#39;s interesting to them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He hears and sees things<br/>
that we do not, talks to himself all the time, and has... to one degree or<br/>
another...many of the behavioral problems that the teachers claim. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How long was he in school (including pre-school/daycare)?<br/>
<br/>
How sure are you that the talking to himself and other mental input wasn&#39;t <br/>
part of a big screen to separate himself from the school environment?<br/>
<br/>
Again, the school might be the cause or the catalyst which brought about the <br/>
other &quot;behaviors&quot; or symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am not anti medication when it is actually necessary. I am vehmently<br/>
opposed to anyone medicating a child who does not need it. Further I really<br/>
hate when it is assumed that any parent who chooses to medicate is harming<br/>
their child just because it is unpopular in the opinion of your peers to<br/>
medicate. Whether they were coerced or they actually chose to medicate the<br/>
child it is insensitive to insinuate that their decision is wrong because it<br/>
has been wrong for others.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The other side of that is some parents (not you, by any indication from your <br/>
writings) wiwas why I objected to your simple quotable statement up top here <br/>
which I hope will not go around being quoted.<br/>
<br/>
Until school is really out of the equation, parents can&#39;t see what will be <br/>
needed for &quot;an unschooling environment.&quot;  When  a child has been in and part <br/>
of and swallowed up by school, he is sometimes lost to the parents in any <br/>
clear way, and they need to live together a while without school, and find <br/>
their place in the non-school world before they can begin to see what&#39;s <br/>
necessary or right.<br/>
