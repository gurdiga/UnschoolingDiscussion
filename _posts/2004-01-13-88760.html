<div id="ygrps-yiv-173429268">&quot;I&#39;m drinking raspberry leaf tea, trying to be active when all I want to do is <br/>
sleep, etc.  I&#39;ve gained more weight with this one than the others, but don&#39;t <br/>
have gestational diabetes this time around.  All I want to do is float in a <br/>
pool.  <br/>
<br/>
Any advice???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes...a couple of things. First, RELAX. This is the last few weeks your baby will live as part of you, this will never be again and just enjoy this little being that is working his/her way to separating from your body. Talk to the baby, make sure it knows it is welcome and you&#39;re so happy it&#39;s about to be born.<br/>
Drink nettle tea in addition to the raspberry tea...it has a lot of vitamin K and you won&#39;t need the vit. K for the baby after birth, plus if you bleed it will help you clot faster. Nettle tea probably saved my life after my last little guy was born. I hemmorraghed, but it clotted rather than gushing, due to all that nettle tea I drank.:)<br/>
<br/>
There are homeopathic remedies to induce labor, but it only works when the body is very ready. The day my midwife gave me the remedies, I went into labor with Jalen...very cool! It won&#39;t work unless it&#39;s close to time anyway though. You really don&#39;t want that baby being born before it&#39;s ready, and size has very little to do with whether or not you can successfully avoid a C-section. It has a lot more to do with the babies position, head size and your pelvis. So don&#39;t let size scare you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, having average sized babies, I look at anything over 8 pounds as <br/>
being like the richter scale.  A 5.3 earthquake is MUCH more damaging than a <br/>
5.0, right?  Maybe I need to get that thought out of my brain.<br/>
<br/>
We talk to the baby all the time.  Sing to him, take him swimming, etc.  He <br/>
spends great portions of the day with his head in my pelvis - ouch!  The bone <br/>
stretching is painful.  But then he&#39;ll pick his head out and be in an oblique <br/>
position for a while.  Because of my asthma, I have to do these non-stress <br/>
tests each week and his kicking is a bit slow.<br/>
<br/>
I know he&#39;s not ready.  I just am.  But I needed to hear that, it helped.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll pick up some nettle tea after my appointment tomorrow - I&#39;m out of <br/>
raspberry too. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter used castor oil (with the midwife&#39;s ok) with her second. It <br/>
worked really well because she and he were essentially ready. But she says <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t do it again. She felt like it was a trauma for him to be <br/>
separated even that little bit before he would have arrived on his own. The <br/>
third came on his own schedule, and he&#39;s the most mellow of the three. (He <br/>
was also born unassisted, just dad, the older two, and Grandma.)<br/>

This sounds so nice and -  well - mellow.  Are you the lucky Grandma?<br/>

helping with the olders for the other two. Wonderful!<br/>
