<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520776965">-=-Is this the right group?<br/>
<br/>
Hi ALL<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll listen for a day or two before I jump all over you all!<br/>
<br/>
Bridget-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bridget, you didn&#39;t wait for a day or two, so try to accept the response of a <br/>
large, established group of unschoolers to some of your suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yes, but I think it depends on the child too.  I have two that can walk<br/>
away and do other things but my third will sit in front of the TV or<br/>
computer ALL day if not told to do other things.  I&#39;m not exaggerating<br/>
either when I say ALL day.  He will watch one movie after another, the<br/>
same movie over and over or cooking show, cartoons and construction<br/>
shows.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This has been discussed at great length at www.unschooling.com (which I <br/>
highly recommend everyone on this list read), and watching movies over and <br/>
over, watching cooking shows, cartoons and construction shows could easily be <br/>
greater learning activity than those other children who found something else <br/>
to do. <br/>
<br/>
In the longrun, over a lifetime looking back, what you told him to do will <br/>
rarely prove to have been as good for him as what he chose to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-449149521">Ok I will admit that I have not been keeping up on the posts (buried <br/>
in work and am currently visiting my dad in Texas) but I had to <br/>
respond to what Sandra said about TV. (again I may be clueless as to <br/>
what started the conversation but...)<br/>
<br/>
WE don&#39;t have tv right now. We turned cable off for the summer <br/>
because we are too busy, but will be turning it back on in a month or <br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be totally against the tv because my oldest would spend <br/>
hours and hours watching anything and everything. But then one day I <br/>
started to tell him something about WW1. He spouted up and told me <br/>
reams of info on it. Where did you learn THAT? His answer TV. I <br/>
started letting him watch tv as much as he wanted. The result he <br/>
would watch for hours and then go out and play, ride his skateboard, <br/>
bike, whatever. Once I gave HIM the choice things changed. I have <br/>
also found that he learns best from TV and movies. He can watch a <br/>
documentary WHILE playing a computer game, or drawing or reading a <br/>
comic book and still have 100% recall and comprehension. I have, at <br/>
times, has to go look up info on whatever subject we wereviewing to <br/>
make sure he had his facts straight because I couldn&#39;t rememeber. He <br/>
is very dyslexic, reading the average novel takes him up to 3 months <br/>
(always with perfect comprehension) so I think his brain works <br/>
differently and that is fine.<br/>
<br/>
And a word to the cooking shows, after a year of staring blankly at <br/>
them he began to cook. He would talk about a recipe he saw on tv and <br/>
then go prepare it. He also started buying cooking magazines. From <br/>
the age of 13 to 14 he was in the kitchen for hours a day. He no <br/>
longer cooks but the skills are here to stay, maybe to pop up later. <br/>
I don&#39;t think he would have had any interest in this had it not been <br/>
for hours of cooking shows on discovery.<br/>
<br/>
Well gotta go to the pool.<br/>
Excuse typos, I am typing on a laptop in the HEAT. We Washintonians <br/>
can&#39;t take this TExas weather.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So, you are saying that you don&#39;t have a problem with a child who gets up<br/>
turns on the TV, eats, watches TV, eats, watches TV, eats, watches TV,<br/>
goes to bed?  Because I do.  I don&#39;t tell him he can&#39;t watch any but I<br/>
won&#39;t let him watch it to the exclusion of all else.  Unfortunately, he<br/>
suffers from a family addictive personality.  I had to limit MY OWN TV<br/>
too or I would do the same thing.  And it isn&#39;t healthy for either one of<br/>
us.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh and by the way, I don&#39;t tell him WHAT to do when he turns it off, just<br/>
to do something else.<br/>

 Well, that and because I am cheap.  We just watch what is available on<br/>
broadcast.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>See - now that is the big difference - when given the choice, Wyndham<br/>
will do nothing physical.  And I do mean NOTHING.  And yes, he has had a<br/>
LONG spell of his choice.  I was very ill for a long time and they were<br/>
all left to their own devices.  The girls did other things too but he<br/>
just got more and more addicted to the tube.<br/>
<br/>

from SOME of what he watches.  <br/>

stuff that is on when there is nothing good on.  It stems from an inside<br/>
joke here and is way to long to explain but it involves men and a lady<br/>
cooking scallops.<br/>

family...I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d see it here. And this is a very direct honest <br/>
list. If there&#39;s a topic you&#39;re not comfortable debating, I&#39;d not bring it <br/>
up. I think people here debate to further growth more than anything. (aside <br/>
from some occasional mudslinging :-)) When people are responding and <br/>
disagreeing, they&#39;re trying to open your eyes to something more than point <br/>
out your flaws. jmo.<br/>

definition of unschooling.  My hope is that eventually I&#39;ll have the <br/>
trust to let my kids determine everything for themselves when it <br/>

I unsubbed and deleted the instructions for how to do so.  Then I received a &quot;confirm unsub&quot; message, which I confirmed.  I&#39;m still here.  I&#39;m as confused by it as are the rest of you.  I figure that since I&#39;m still here, I might as well participate.<br/>

goes to bed?  Because I do.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you let go of the problem, it won&#39;t be a problem, in more ways than one.<br/>
And if I was providing nothing better to do (better meaning more interesting, <br/>
something outside the house which was stimulating thinking and conversation <br/>
and activity) then I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with one of my children watching <br/>
a lot of TV.<br/>

But NONE of them can or would do that every day for life unless the life <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is such a good point Sandra.  A child who has many options and<br/>
interested parents will not always choose TV.  A child may use TV as a<br/>
way to escape boredom, depression, unhappiness, insecurity, fear, etc:<br/>
and if this is the case, TV STILL isn&#39;t the problem.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who was very uptight about how much TV her kids watched. <br/>
She was  a neat freak and everything in her house always had to be put<br/>
away.   Her kids never had stuff laying around.  If they can never see<br/>
what&#39;s available to them how are they supposed to know if today would be<br/>
a good day for puppets or sewing or painting or whatever?  But the TV was<br/>
always right there in the living room.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; That type of unsubbing works when it wants to &lt;g&gt;  The only for sure way<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; unsub is to go to Yahoo to &quot;my groups&quot; and edit settings.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And even that takes some time - like a few hours!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t use computers to automate that process!!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or why they have it take so long some times!<br/>

are addicted to gambling.  It isn&#39;t that he has nothing else to do, it<br/>
isn&#39;t that he even likes what he watches.  I KNOW because I have the same<br/>
problem.  And yes, he would stay stuck to the tube endlessly even though<br/>
he has lots of other things he likes to do.<br/>

&gt;and if this is the case, TV STILL isn&#39;t the problem.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, TV is not the problem.  A genetic predisposition to addiction is. <br/>
I will have to watch this one closely as he grows.  The girls at home are<br/>
a little less addictive, but my oldest who was given up at birth and has<br/>
reconnected went through rehab at 15.  It&#39;s in the genes.<br/>
