&gt; Being new I was wondering if/what rules are instilled in your household.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; example-     No  food out of the dining area<br/>
&gt;                   bathing<br/>
&gt;                   ect<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is our first week and I do see some changes already, but trying to<br/>
&gt; change my out look on something&#39;s are very hard, like when my son just picks<br/>
&gt; and picks on  the other child I take care of during the day.  Will sit there<br/>
&gt; and repeat his name in a chant and when the child ask him to stop he keeps<br/>
&gt; doing it and will even follow him to do it.  I just want to tell him to knock<br/>
&gt; it off but don&#39;t feel that is the right approach.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d tell him to knock it off. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;d probably try to tell him that in<br/>
private, and it would come with explanation and help in creating space and<br/>
time and aloneness and you available even if the other child is in the<br/>
house, if your son is feeling irritated about a non-family member in his<br/>
space.<br/>
<br/>
And if he was really irritated by it, I&#39;d find another way including not<br/>
taking care of the other child (i.e, telling him parents you can&#39;t any more<br/>
and they&#39;ll have to find other arrangements, not setting Other Child out in<br/>
the snow :)<br/>
<br/>
The food and bathing and all are different issues -- your son is harming the<br/>
other child by intentionally being mean to him, the other stuff is &quot;just&quot;<br/>
mom&#39;s level of tolerance for mess and smell and you can, IMHO, do a lot more<br/>
relaxing there and see what alternatives you can all come up with.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Anybody who is concerned about the future bathing habits of their kids can<br/>
take heart.  Around puberty, most kids will start bathing regularly.  In<br/>
fact mine bathes a little too regularly, like often a couple of showers a<br/>
day.  &lt;g&gt;  This too shall pass.<br/>
