<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499573372">It seems as though I am in the minority when it comes to<br/>
putting the kids to bed at 9pm.  My 9yod reads until 10pm<br/>
but the younger two like going to bed.  Seem to crave it.  I<br/>
too am a night owl and I could easily stay up till 2am but<br/>
it is tough to get up with the littlest ones at 7 or 8am.  I<br/>
did not mean to imply that late bed times are bad just that<br/>
my husband would like one on one time with me before he goes<br/>
to bed at 11pm.  He is also an early bird!  I know friends<br/>
who home school and have late bedtimes who happen to love it<br/>
but there are quite a few who start their day earlier than I<br/>
do and love it as well.  I think it depends on individual<br/>
preference and what works for your family.<br/>
I have been reading a lot this past week about the Charlotte<br/>
Mason method and would like to know if there is anyone out<br/>
there doing it?  I like the Five in a row study and see an<br/>
abundance of materials to choose from.  Just starting out in<br/>
this adventure, I would be more comfortable with some<br/>
structured curriculum but want freedom to go explore and<br/>
discover the world at our pace.  Our state requires yearly<br/>
testing so I feel like a curriculum would help us to that<br/>
end but don&#39;t have much faith in testing in general.  It<br/>
seems to cause extreme pressure in school children in the<br/>
month of May around here because their results determine<br/>
teacher pay raises!  If anyone can help me with more<br/>
information, I would really appreciate it.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
officially started home schooling yet but it is already<br/>
part of our lives since I have been doing it to a degree<br/>
since they were toddlers.  I want to start this summer or in<br/>
the fall.  I have read about decompression time they will<br/>
need.  Does anyone have more info on this?  Thank you.<br/>
