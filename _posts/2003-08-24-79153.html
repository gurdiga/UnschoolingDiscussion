<div id="ygrps-yiv-205515687">Hi All,<br/>
  If you remember, my son Trevor is into monsters, vampires, werewolves, <br/>
etc...and is now requesting novels like The Phantom of the Opera, Mary Shelley&#39;s <br/>
Frankenstein, and Dracula. He is a fairly fluent reader but is very visual and <br/>
likes lots of illustrations (he will be 6 next month.) I think that DK makes a <br/>
few books called something like Young Classics that might have a few of <br/>
these. We&#39;ve been watching tons of classic horror movies and I&#39;m guessing that <br/>
Phantom of the Opera the musical is probably on video. I did find a great-looking <br/>
line of videos called Creatures Fantastic that features werewolves, etc...that <br/>
I&#39;m purchasing. Any other suggestions would be appreciated!<br/>
  We are having a Not-Back-to-School Picnic this week at a local park and I <br/>
have been notifying all the different local support groups and making fliers to <br/>
hang. I want my kids to feel like they also have things to celebrate in the <br/>
midst of all the back-to-school commercials and yellow buses.<br/>

We just found some fairly interesting monster movie titles at the Turner<br/>
Classic Movies web site. <br/>
You can purchase them at their on-line store.  They have quite a few Ray<br/>
Harryhausen titles, if those are of interest. <br/>
<br/>
Closer to Halloween there&#39;ll be more monsters on satellite and cable,<br/>
suitable for recording. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, I didn&#39;t think about that. I&#39;m keeping my eyes open for the Making <br/>
of Thriller video. He really liked American Werewolf in London and I think that <br/>
John Landis was involved in both. I also think he&#39;d like to see how all the <br/>
special effects were done.<br/>
