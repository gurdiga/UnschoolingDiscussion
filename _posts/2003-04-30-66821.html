&gt; I laughed at this as a friend was telling me about visiting her mom is Buffalo. My friend<br/>
&gt; was interested in going to a rubber stamping store but her mom said that it was &quot;too far&quot;<br/>
&gt; away. It was about 30 mins away! Down here, we regularly travel that far or longer<br/>
&gt; to visit friends etc...<br/>

Bacjk home I was reluctant to go see a friend who lived 11 miles away. It was a real chore and involved getting the mostly unused car out and cajoling it into going. (Her village didn&#39;t have a bus<br/>
service)<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get used to driving and traffic here.<br/>
Which is why I do most errands on my bike.<br/>
Which reminds me, I had to match testosterone with some lycra clad guy on one of them super-lightweight sissy-bikes at the weekend. I&#39;d just been to the supermarket (8 Miles from here) and was coming<br/>
back with 4 groaning panniers (bout 40 pounds of groceries) when he swore at me for being on the bike trail and went past. 10 minutes later I catch up with him at the foot of a hill and then proceed to<br/>
breeze past him going up-hill. In my mirror i could see him cursing me and turning red with effort. He nearly gave himself a hernia trying to pass me on my laden bike and normal everyday clothes. (and<br/>
the weekend lycra set loathe cyclists who don&#39;t dress up etc etc)<br/>
Hur hur hur<br/>
I rule<br/>
