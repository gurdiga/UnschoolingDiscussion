<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683019411">Several months ago, I had an article in Home Education Magazine called<br/>
&quot;Geese&quot; in which I detailed the efforts of my public school to teach<br/>
me Russian (I was a &quot;Sputnik&quot; baby). In it, I related a couple of<br/>
stories of the totally useless bits I still remember (a poem by a guy<br/>
I never heard of, and of which I don&#39;t know the meaning, but which I<br/>
can recite perfectly, and with feeling!) I&#39;ll be happy to send a copy<br/>
to anyone who e-mails me privately. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:shantinik@...">shantinik@...</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it seems to have hit a nerve, and I&#39;ve got some totally<br/>
hilarious e-mails back -- my favorite was another student of Russian,<br/>
whose only remaining bit is knowing how to sing &quot;It&#39;s a Long Road to<br/>
Tipperary&quot; (in Russian.) <br/>
<br/>
So, I thought a collection of these would make for a great future<br/>
article (and might be fun to share here as well, if you choose). (Now<br/>
I don&#39;t want to offend anyone -- if language teaching somehow worked<br/>
for you, more power to it!) But I&#39;d love to get a little collection --<br/>
what linguistic flotsam-and-jetsam do you have hiding in your<br/>
synapses, and which flossing doesn&#39;t reach?<br/>
<br/>
If you post it here, I&#39;ll assume I can use it (without attribution of<br/>
course), unless you say otherwise?  (or you can send it to me privately.)</div>
