<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207018585">Hi Carli,<br/>
            It&#39;s not so that unschooling would be more casual than what<br/>
you&#39;re doing. Unschooling does not mean doing nothing or letting your kids<br/>
do whatever they want, it means taking your childrens interests and creating<br/>
learning experiences from them. You are already doing that and you both<br/>
enjoy it so just keep up the good work.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi, my name is Carli and I just joined this list.  My oldest daughter is 4<br/>
&gt; 1/2 years old.  We (my hubby and I) know that we want to do homeschooling.<br/>
&gt; I am just not sure what avenue to take.  Unschooling philosophies are<br/>
&gt; appealing to me and make sense.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is, what do you do?  I got a pretty good idea of what<br/>
&gt; unschooling is not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Currently my daughter loves the time that her sister takes a nap and we do<br/>
&gt; &quot;homeschooling.&quot;  This is more a term than an actuality.  But a couple<br/>
&gt; times a week, we do practice writing letters and spelling her name.  On<br/>
&gt; occassion I have been teaching her the names of different coins and<br/>
&gt; teaching her how to classify fruits and vegetables.  These are both done<br/>
&gt; through game like activities.  I chose these 2 areas, because she seems to<br/>
&gt; have been picking up on it on her own and I wanted to strengthen her<br/>
&gt; knowledge.  Anyway, the time we do spend is usually focused time.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; easiest to do when her 2 year old sister is napping.  Oh, and we always do<br/>
&gt; some craft or cooking activity too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Like I said, she absolutely loves this time, and begs for it everyday.  I<br/>
&gt; get the feeling that unschooling would be much less casual than this<br/>
&gt; focused time I have been spending.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In your opinion, what are some things I should be doing.  And should I<br/>
&gt; continue what I am doing, since she enjoys it so much?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks a lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Carli<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m resending this because it seems to have got lost in cyberspace...sorry <br/>
if <br/>
 it&#39;s a repeat.  Thanks. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I sent you a response to this - hope you got it.  <br/>
Try visiting www.lupus.org.  There&#39;s lots of good info there about lupus, <br/>
other autoimmune disorders, and the meaning of ANA results.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; I went to the <br/>
 doctor last week with many many symptoms and he told me it was probably just <br/>
 mild fibromylgia (would hate to see severe) but ran some test anyway.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
Heather,  if you have a group of symptoms, it sounds like Chronic Fatigue <br/>
Syndrome, with fibromyalgia going with it.  My sister has this, and it is <br/>
very close to MS and I believe that my sister says that only way they can dx <br/>
MS is with a brain scan.  At any rate, if you want to email me privately, I <br/>
can get you in touch with her regarding her symptoms. <br/>
