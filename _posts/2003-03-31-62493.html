NCLB, Homeschooling, and You<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
Ann:<br/>
When &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; (NCLB) legislation passed, I was thrilled <br/>
to find that homeschoolers had been specifically &quot;written out&quot; of the <br/>
legislation.  Homeschoolers are not subject to any NCLB mandate, <br/>
including the excessive burden of high-stakes testing and the <br/>
negative impact of that testing on children&#39;s love of learning.  This <br/>
week, though, I read a press release that gave me pause.  It came <br/>
from the US Department of Education and announced guidance and <br/>
information on the ways that NCLB impacts charter schools and school <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
That press release got me to thinking.  There are thousands - or <br/>
hundreds of thousands? - of children learning at home under the <br/>
direction of public education institutions, including charter <br/>
schools, alternative schools, independent study programs, cyber <br/>
schools, and the like.  These children are NOT &quot;written out&quot; of NCLB.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, do families whose children are enrolled in public programs <br/>
REALIZE that they fall under all aspects of NCLB?  Do they understand <br/>
that their children will be subjected to more bouts of invasive <br/>
testing?  Do they mistakenly believe they are excused because the <br/>
children do not attend regular public school classes?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know these answers, but I do know that to make informed <br/>
choices, parents need relevant information.  To that end, here are <br/>
some resources to help families learn more about NCLB issues.<br/>
**<br/>

Headline: Resources to help you find out if a program falls under <br/>

Headline: Homeschooler to serve on state Board of Education<br/>
&quot;Montpelier -- Gov. James Douglas has appointed a homeschooler to <br/>
serve on the state Board of Education.  Susan Schill of Belvidere is <br/>
believed to be the first board member to educate her children at <br/>
home.&quot; &quot;An increasing number of Vermont families are choosing home <br/>
schooling,&quot; Douglas said Friday. &quot;I think it would be helpful to have <br/>
that perspective represented on the board. The board is responsible <br/>
for the education for all Vermonters.&quot;<br/>

win that focuses on his  family.  &quot;Elliot Krieger, a spokesman for <br/>
the state Education Department, says about homeschooling, &#39;The <br/>
downside I see is the lack of socialization, the lack of interaction, <br/>
the lack of other points of view which a student would get on the <br/>
same subjects in a group setting,&#39; he said.&quot;<br/>

&quot;NEW YORK   The Holiday Inn banquet hall was packed with teens clad <br/>
in tuxedos and taffeta. They danced the macarena, sipped lemonade, <br/>
and cast interested sidelong glances at one another.<br/>
The Orlando, Fla., event had all the trappings of a standard high <br/>
school prom, with one exception: There were no high schoolers <br/>
present.  All the teens at the Orlando prom were home schoolers.&quot;<br/>

Headline:  Home Schooling Bill Delayed After Protest<br/>
&quot;The sponsor for a bill putting more requirements on parents who <br/>
teach their children at home says he&#39;s not trying to attack home <br/>
schooling.  Parents and children packed a legislative meeting <br/>
Thursday to protest a plan for new regulations on home schooling.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Members of the House Education Committee opted to delay acting on <br/>
the bill [..] The plan would require the state&#39;s 12,474 home school <br/>
parents to submit a curriculum plan for their child, a proposed <br/>
teaching schedule, a list of the parent&#39;s qualifications as a teacher <br/>
and a written statement that they will provide their child a quality <br/>
education.&quot;<br/>
Ann: Wow.  The sponsor says he&#39;s &quot;not trying to attack home <br/>
schooling.&quot;  I&#39;m confused - if this is not an attack on <br/>
homeschooling, what would be?  This is a bill to fight tooth and <br/>
nail. We&#39;re pulling for you, Arkansas homeschoolers.<br/>

Headline: Bill would let home school students play<br/>
Subhead: Extracurricular activities part of school life, parents say<br/>
&quot;A new bid [House Bill 261] is under way to let students educated at <br/>
home join public school football teams, bands and other <br/>
extracurricular activities.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Rep. Rick Farrar, D-Pineville, says parents of children who learn at <br/>
home pay taxes just like those who attend public schools and are <br/>
entitled to similar privileges.<br/>
&quot;Farrar also says the change would help home-schooled children get <br/>
around one of the pitfalls of staying home -- social isolation.&quot;<br/>
Ann: I know this veers from the main topic here, but &quot;social <br/>
isolation?&quot;  I&#39;m thinking Rep. Farrar might be socially isolated - <br/>
from his homeschooling constituency.<br/>

<br/>
Ann: Ohio homeschoolers, some 120,000 strong, believe they are <br/>
targeted as a cash cow by the charter and cyber schools that <br/>
proliferate there.  Public programs designed to attract homeschoolers <br/>
are popping up in other states as well, including cash-strapped <br/>
Oregon and Washington.  Here is how some Ohio homeschoolers are <br/>
reacting.<br/>

&quot;Ohio homeschoolers were again bombarded with unsolicited mailings <br/>

homeschooling being integrated into government school in their homes. <br/>
Unless we work to preserve our independence, we may find that our <br/>

&quot;When Joe and Pam Roderick of Marshfield decided to homeschool their <br/>
two children, they wondered if they were doing the right thing. <br/>
Their concerns gradually diminished as their daughter Chantelle and <br/>
son Brett embraced homeschooling and thrived with it.  Now Chantelle, <br/>
29, plans to homeschool her two children.&quot; [..]Homeschooling, once <br/>
viewed as a curious novelty, has become an established alternative to <br/>
traditional schooling [..]&quot;&#39;&#39;I would say that generally speaking, <br/>
homeschooling has worked,&#39;&#39; state Education Commissioner David <br/>
Driscoll said. &#39;It is something that has become a natural part of the <br/>
landscape now.&#39;&quot;<br/>

Headline:  Family pupils are homing in on college<br/>
&quot;As home-schooling has moved from a fringe to a mainstream <br/>
educational option, increasing numbers of home-schoolers are <br/>
negotiating the college admissions process. More colleges today have <br/>
policies to make sense of home-schoolers&#39; academic experiences - a <br/>
January 2003 report by the National Association of College Admission <br/>
Counseling in Alexandria, Va., showed 74 percent of colleges surveyed <br/>
had formal policies to judge home-school credentials, up from 52 <br/>
percent in 2000.&quot;<br/>

news?  Do you have legal/legislative challenges or successes?  Are <br/>
homeschooling issues being represented accurately in the media and in <br/>
advertising?  Are there threats to homeschooling freedoms that <br/>
deserve a wider audience?  Is something happening today that will <br/>
help assure that we - and our children and grandchildren - can <br/>
homeschool with the greatest freedom possible? Please share so the <br/>
rest of us can learn!<br/>
