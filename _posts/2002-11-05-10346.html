&gt;  Possibly first week. We&#39;d stay in a motel and just breeze round,<br/>
&gt; eat all your food etc, dazzle you with our accents and then leave ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But going out to dinner would be good.<br/>
&gt; Does Pheonix have an airport?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! I really laughed when I read you question &quot;does Phoenix have an<br/>
airport?&quot;<br/>
Yes, it has a grand, big airport and you&#39;ll love the name. It&#39;s called Sky<br/>
Harbor International Airport. Well, I think it sounds cool!<br/>
<br/>
Going out to dinner, breezing around, being dazzled by accents, - sounds<br/>
like fun!<br/>
Keep me posted on your plans Shyrley - feel free to e-mail me personally if<br/>
you&#39;d like.<br/>
