&gt; &lt;&lt; I have also heard of kids who were philosophically opposed to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;when the <br/>
&gt;proctor said &quot;you may begin&quot; we got up from our seats put our tests down on<br/>
&gt;the desk and said &quot;I&#39;m not taking this&quot; to which we received wicked applause<br/>
&gt;from the others in the room. (The proctor knew in advance that we weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;going to take it.) we walked out<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ned applauds:  Congratulations to you. When more people see that it is<br/>
necessary to stand up for our rights, we will stop losing those rights to<br/>
those who want to use us for their purposes. If no one protests the loss of<br/>
rights, we will continue to lose them.<br/>
<br/>
The children seem to get it. Maybe some day, the parents will.<br/>
<br/>
Diplomas are worth less every day, anyway. Smart people don&#39;t need them for<br/>
anything.<br/>
