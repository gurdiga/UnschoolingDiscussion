<div id="ygrps-yiv-20076678"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;If they weren&#39;t littered, there was nothing to clean up.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i meant it sounded like the park you were visiting is more littered than<br/>
the one we visit.  we don&#39;t find much garbage there.  now, the street in<br/>
front of our house is atrocious. i don&#39;t know what people must be<br/>
thinking?  (maybe they&#39;re just not thinking.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;more serious stickers later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lol...my husband has a picture of this giant goat trash can thing that<br/>
was at a park where he hung out with friends a bunch while he lived in<br/>
washington state before we met.  it was a big brass sculpture that would<br/>
*eat* garbage like a real goat.  i wondered if maybe this was a more<br/>
widespread phenomenon. :)<br/>
