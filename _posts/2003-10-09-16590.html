<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116106075">Mom said &quot;She has other teeth&quot;<br/>
&quot;He didn&#39;t mean to break her tooth, he was just hitting her in the face.&quot;<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not a big thing - she isn&#39;t a model or anything like that.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve given him 5 minutes time out - it&#39;s over.&quot;<br/>
**ay yi yi.  I want to run screaming from the room!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad they moved.  That kid is a psychopath.**<br/>
<br/>
Probobably not yet, but likely to end up there because Mom will keep enabling <br/>
him and training him in abuser rationalizations, while not giving him any of <br/>
the kind of love kids truly need. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Same in the park day situation. The moms of the kids being attacked NEED to <br/>
not only protect their kids from the attacking kid, but also from the <br/>
attacker&#39;s mom. You may not be able to get her to stop giving her kid rationalizations, <br/>
but you can stop her from trying to make your kids believe they&#39;re <br/>
responsible for his abusing them. I wouldn&#39;t want my children, especially daughters, <br/>
being told over and over variations of &quot;he wouldn&#39;t hit you if you&#39;d only ____&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s horribly difficult being the parent of an explosive child, but she&#39;s not <br/>
not NOT doing him any favors by trying to train his playmates instead of <br/>
working with him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397133165">I wan&#39;t the original poster on this thread, but I have to thanks all <br/>
of you for your comments and suggestions on this matter. Prior to <br/>
this, I kept going back and forth in my head, wondering if I was <br/>
blowing this out of proportion. You&#39;ve given me the courage recognize <br/>
that it is truly a problem and to take the necessary action to <br/>
resolve this issue. We&#39;ll let you all know where this goes...we&#39;ll be <br/>
with them on Sunday at a birthday party. It will actually be <br/>
interesting to see how things go down with the different dynamic of <br/>
having a bunch of dads around...hmmmmmmmmm.<br/>
