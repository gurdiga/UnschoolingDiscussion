Subject: Looking for an activity<br/>
<br/>
My son is a new homeschooler.  We live in Summerville, SC.  He is <br/>
9yo and in the 4th grade.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in sharing activities or is a member of an <br/>
active support group, I would greatly appreciate hearing from you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks-Taunya<br/>

If you&#39;re interested in UNschooling (you&#39;ll have to abandon &quot;9th <br/>
grade&quot;----grades are for meat and eggs, not children!), check out <br/>
www.SchoolsOutSupport.org  for South Carolina&#39;s statewide unschoolers&#39; support group. There should be <br/>
a local group forming in the Greater Charleston/Low Country area soon, if it&#39;s <br/>
not already off the ground.<br/>
<br/>
You may also contact me by e-mail or by phone  803 776 4849  Just let me know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-583080864">You are absolutely correct.  Thanks for the new support group.  I&#39;ll <br/>
visit that site.  How old are your children?  How long ahave you <br/>
been &quot;homeschooling&quot;?  I have been reading about uinschooling but, I <br/>
have to confess I&#39;m a little nervous about what if my son wants to <br/>
go back to public/private school.  I&#39;m reading &quot;The Unschholers <br/>
Handbook&quot; and have been to John Holt&#39;s site as well as other related <br/>
sites.  My son has been so beaten down by traditional methods, I <br/>
just want him to be curious again and regain his self esteem.<br/>

<br/>
You want him to be someone who fits into school.<br/>
<br/>
You want him to be him.<br/>

Those two thoughts are going to fight against each other preventing either<br/>
from working. You&#39;re going to need to let go of one or the other. And you&#39;ve<br/>
already tried the first!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997556807">See Joyce, you hit it on the head.  Why is that people&lt;me&gt; have no <br/>
problem trusting a stranger with their children but not themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like peeling an onion.  Everytime I think I&#39;m letting <br/>
the &quot;schoolish&quot; thinking go.......<br/>
