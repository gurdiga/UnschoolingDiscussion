area.    Just Pam G and I.. and one other mother.. We&#39;ve met a few other<br/>

<br/>
My homeschooling community is very close despite the differences in method<br/>
between families. I was uneasy about possible reactions to my decision to<br/>
unschool as most of families are fundamental Christians. I have been so<br/>
amazed at the  positive response. We have had a couple of meetings (we all<br/>
go out to dinner) and everyone has been really interested and asked lots of<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
Since February, one family has begun unschooling and another has thrown out<br/>
her timetable and is trying really hard to give her kids more freedom. My<br/>
newsletter has much more of an unschooling feel to it (obviously) and<br/>
everyone has been enjoying that too.<br/>
<br/>
I guess just being positive and excited about what you&#39;re doing does have an<br/>
impact on people. It is interesting though, out of 15 or so families I can<br/>
only think of one that is a strict school at home type who can&#39;t do anything<br/>
till after 1pm. Maybe it&#39;s an Australian thing. The &#39;she&#39;ll be right mate&#39;<br/>
type attitude that makes for a pretty laid back life. Could also be<br/>
construed as laziness or apathy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818912759">Our local homeschool group met once a week for a Game Group.  It consisted of all types of homeschoolers because the requirement was that the kids came to play games, mainly board games or Magic cards, &quot;no schoolwork allowed&quot;.  We used a room in the library once a week for about 2 hours.  In the summer we moved it to the park.  <br/>
<br/>
Only once a mom brought her daughter&#39;s math because her daughter didn&#39;t finish it.  She screamed at her daughter in front of everyone about how she was playing dumb because she &quot;knew this stuff&quot;.  My opinion was that if the daughter knew that stuff, then why did she have to keep doing it?  I tried to figure out why the mom would bring math to a game group.  I decided the mom was showing off and that she wanted us to see the math that her daughter was doing.  This mom used to check her PDA all the time, too.  <br/>
<br/>
That was the only time something like that happened.<br/>

my kids have no one to play them with except each other. And, thier skill <br/>
levels are so different, it&#39;s not really fun for them.   I had not thought of using <br/>
the library for a game day.. THAT is a great idea!  Thanks<br/>

Sometimes the grown-ups play too. Last week there was singing and <br/>

We really mostly sit in the park - we often sit there until late into <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We usually have craft/cooking once a fortnight. Once we went to the art<br/>
gallery, they had a special Monet in Japan exhibition, we organized with the<br/>
gallery beforehand and we were able to do an art activity before we went<br/>
through the exhibit. That was fun.<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve done cultural things too. Last year we went to a Maori family&#39;s house<br/>
for the weekend and had a hangi. We watched a video of Maori singing and<br/>
dancing and made pois. That was fun too.<br/>
