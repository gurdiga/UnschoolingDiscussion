<div id="ygrps-yiv-177099062">&quot;I think to unschool effectively means that we parents have to have lives<br/>
and<br/>
interests. We have to have a passion for learning stuff, to like to do<br/>
stuff.<br/>
We CAN&#39;T just do it for the kids. Then it becomes a sacrifice, which IS<br/>
about<br/>
us. Kids don&#39;t want us to sacrifice ourselves...that&#39;s leads to guilt. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
The most I have time to do something of interest to myself is reading this<br/>
and one other list.  I usually feel guilty about the time spent doing that,<br/>
because while I&#39;m doing it the kids are feeling neglected or the house is<br/>
being trashed.  I often can&#39;t read all the posts and have to skip a whole<br/>
bunch of them  because I don&#39;t have time to both unschool my kids and read<br/>
about unschooling.  How in the world would I have time to pursue my own<br/>
interests?  Today I have to go to the grocery store, make sandwiches for my<br/>
9 year old daughter&#39;s tea party she&#39;s having with friends, help my 5 year<br/>
old son look for a set of blocks he wants to find, make supper, take dd to<br/>
soccer practice. There won&#39;t be much time leftover.   I have 10 more minutes<br/>
to read this list and then that&#39;s IT.  And even as I&#39;m writing this, my 3<br/>
year old just started saying, &quot;Mommy, come play Thomas with me&quot;.  There is<br/>
no time for interests of my own.  Unless you count watching my kids learn<br/>
and grow as my passion.  And it really is!  It&#39;s one of the most fascinating<br/>
things I can think to do.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes read interesting books and magazines (mostly about unschooling<br/>
or parenting).  Sometimes I&#39;ll research a little bit about traditions and<br/>
why people do the things they do.  That&#39;s about the extent of it.<br/>
<br/>
You said:<br/>
&quot;So, reading the above... I was a bit baffled. Sure, there&#39;s nothing wrong<br/>
with buying the brand of toilet paper your family likes -- but why are you<br/>
the only one who replaces the roll? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;s the only one who will?  Maybe the kids don&#39;t want to?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not that it isn&#39;t fine for you to have a couple of &quot;Lovey Nurturey&quot;<br/>
things you do for your family, but the impression I get is that these are<br/>
just the tip of the iceberg. I think the first thing you need to do is to<br/>
Get<br/>
a Life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is loving and nurturing one&#39;s family full time not a life?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What<br/>
have YOU always wanted to learn or do?  What are YOUR dreams? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wanted to be a mommy, ever since I&#39;ve been little.    I used to<br/>
have 14 dolls and each had a name.  I always told my mom that I would have<br/>
14 kids when I got big and that I would name them the same name as my dolls.<br/>
I dreamed about being a real mommy.  I met my husband when I was 15 and as<br/>
soon as I met him, I dreamed about becoming his wife.  He became my passion<br/>
and at 18 I married him.  So my passion is my husband and kids.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So, I think maybe you DO need to do stuff that&#39;s about YOU, but not having<br/>
to<br/>
do with your kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You must be talking to parents of older kids here.  It must be that older<br/>
kids require a whole lot less of your time.  Because I don&#39;t have time to do<br/>
stuff that&#39;s about me, except right now and what I&#39;m doing is talking about<br/>
my kids! lol   And I&#39;m not a keep the house spotless fanatic.  Far from it!<br/>
Just playing with my kids and keeping them fed requires me to busy with them<br/>
24/7.  If I pursued my own interests, I would be neglecting my kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-593578763">-=-Is loving and nurturing one&#39;s family full time not a life?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure. But part of the nurturing unschoolers need is intellectual nurturing.<br/>
An unschooling family in which the mom isn&#39;t interested in anything but <br/>
housework is at a disadvantage.  And if taking care of kids is seen in the <br/>
housework category (keep them clean and cleaned up after), things will bog <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were all little I went weeks without doing anything that wasn&#39;t <br/>
kid-related sometimes, but it was still colored toward things I enjoyed.  <br/>
Music.  Games.  Going out to parks and showing them things I thought were <br/>
cool.   Showing them movies I liked too, and learning to like Power Rangers <br/>
and Ninja Turtles  (modern equivalents abound, but I don&#39;t know much about <br/>
them &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
As they get older they want to know more about the width and breadth and <br/>
depth of the world and it&#39;s good when moms don&#39;t just say &quot;Would you like a <br/>
sandwich instead?&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some moms see being with their kids as drudgery or as sacrifice.  I saw it as <br/>
learning something new and fascinating, as trying to figure out how kids saw <br/>
the world as they were learning to talk, and how they figured out math and <br/>
geography (what direction things were from our house) and I loved their early <br/>
theories on how big the world is.   (&quot;There must be thousands of people in <br/>
the world!&quot;)  <br/>
<br/>
So lots of it&#39;s in how things are defined in our own heads, and that can be a <br/>
part of deschooling ourselves.   It was gradual (though speedily gradual, <br/>
compared to some, it seems) that I came to see non-academic stuff as just as <br/>
valuable, and eventually as just as &quot;academic&quot; as the obviously school-style <br/>
stuff.  But learning that was something I had chosen to do, because school <br/>
was just a few blocks away and I did have a choice.  So I chose to homeschool <br/>
and unschool.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little I chose to organize and maintain a weekly playgroup. <br/>
  It wasn&#39;t just for me, it was community service, and network-creation, and <br/>
something for the kids to look foward to and a place to use balls and <br/>
jumpropes that took more than two kids.<br/>
<br/>
When that&#39;s not enough, the mom needs to be at least mentally ready to widen <br/>
and branch out.<br/>
<br/>
It seems the only time anyone says a mom needs to have her own interests is <br/>
right after a mom says she can&#39;t see her kids getting interested in anything, <br/>
but then she herself isn&#39;t interested in anything, and so someone will say <br/>
&quot;Get interested in things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To talk about Power Rangers I shared some of what I knew about Japan and <br/>
movie making and costuming and traditions about folklore, storytelling and <br/>
space fantasy.  Monsters from space.  (Eddie Izzard talks about monsters from <br/>
space, how long we&#39;ve been ready for them, and that&#39;s a Power Rangers tie in. <br/>
 And I&#39;ve been reading to Holly from a series of books called The Children&#39;s <br/>
Hour, which I got when I was tiny, published in 1954, and we&#39;re on the <br/>
Science Fiction and Space Flight stuff.  VERY crude.  But monsters on Mars <br/>
features.)<br/>
<br/>
If all I wanted to do was travel to the north pole or sky dive, I could be <br/>
miserable, or I could just go do it and not care if my kids were miserable.  <br/>
But within my choice to be with my kids I can still choose what music to <br/>
listen to, what trips to go on when Keith says &quot;in-laws or camping?&quot; and I <br/>
can go out with friends and we choose each time from thousands of choices, <br/>
whether to go bowling or to an art flick or to a concert or shop or just go <br/>
park out on the mesa and watch the sun set and catch up with each other&#39;s <br/>
lives.  For a while  a friend and I was going to one of the pottery painting <br/>
places and doing home-stuff.  A teapot as a joint gift for a friend.  <br/>
Switchplates with indicators, for my house, of which thing they turned on.  <br/>
Weird combos.  And we talked.<br/>
<br/>
Moms can trade with other families, or leave kids with dads, and go.  An <br/>
hour, a half an hour, might be all it takes to reconnect with an interest the <br/>
kids don&#39;t share (yet).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090437787">Hi Sheila,<br/>
<br/>
I may, or may not!, be the perfect person to answer your question.  I have <br/>
seven children, 12, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, and 7 months.  It takes me about 3 hours, <br/>
off and on just to read all the mail from this list, not to mention the few <br/>
others I&#39;m on!  I also heavily pursue MY interests and I don&#39;t feel my <br/>
children are the slightest neglected!<br/>
<br/>
I think the first trick is having a childproof home.  Read that SAFE!<br/>
I make sure nothing is within reach that may harm my children or make my <br/>
life difficult.  I keep a safety lock on the fridge so my 2 yr old doesn&#39;t <br/>
empty it out on the floor.  My older children can all open it (4 and up) if <br/>
they need something.  Last night, I left it unlocked and Ethan (2) dumped 5 <br/>
little tubs of yogurt on the kitchen floor.  It took about 5 minutes to <br/>
clean it up, throw away the trash and spot mop the floor.  No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been up since about 7:30 this morning.  It&#39;s 10:45 now.  I nursed the <br/>
baby, had a potty break and sat all the kids down for breakfast.  While they <br/>
ate, I threw a load of laundry in the wash, put the wet ones in the dryer, <br/>
cleaned up Ethan&#39;s mess, checked a portion of my email and kissed hubby off <br/>
to work.<br/>
<br/>
Once the kids finished breaskfast, the little ones (1,2, and 4) went into <br/>
the bathtub while I cleaned the bathroom and got dressed.  The baby played <br/>
in the living room floor while her big sisters watched tv.  Once the little <br/>
ones got out of the tub, I got them dressed and they headed outside to play. <br/>
  Baby nursed again and I read for about 15 minutes (one of my passions.)  I <br/>
put her in the sling, pulled out dinner to thaw, set out the side dishes and <br/>
started a load of dishes in the dishwasher.  My 1 yr old came in and helped <br/>
me empty the dryer...HIS passion &lt;bg&gt;.  The girls came in to help me fold <br/>
and my oldest daughter threw the wet clothes into the dryer and started a <br/>
new load.  After folding laundry, we read a book together while baby nursed <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
The kids have come in and are playing in the playroom.  I&#39;m back checking <br/>
email again.  We have rehearsals for the talent show our local support group <br/>
is putting on at 1 this afternoon.  I guess after checking email, I&#39;ll get <br/>
the kids ready to go (all their clothes, shoes, socks, bows, etc. were laid <br/>
out last night after they went to bed) make any last minute wardrobe <br/>
changes...bound to happen with my 6 yr old!...and the kids will most likely <br/>
keep playing in or outside.  All this time, the baby is in the sling, <br/>
playing happily on the floor or following me around in her carseat since she <br/>
likes to sit up but hasn&#39;t yet mastered it completely on her own.  I think I <br/>
may use the remainder of that time to pack lunches for the park and convert <br/>
a regular bra I bought last night into a nursing bra.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is long, but I just wanted to give you a taste of my short <br/>
morning.  I&#39;ve had plenty of time to pursue my interests but I do it in <br/>
spurts.  I also clean and do just about everything else in spurts.  If I <br/>
didn&#39;t plan ahead it would take me 2 hours to get the kids dressed and ready <br/>
to go.  Instead,I spend about 15 minutes after they head to bed to find <br/>
everything we will need for the next day.  I HIGHLY recommend FlyLady to <br/>
help you get organized.  It&#39;s for your home, but somehow it clears up your <br/>
head, too!<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t spend all day hovering over my kids.  I&#39;m not saying you do, <br/>
but it sounds like you feel very taxed.  One thing that helps is to allow <br/>
the kids to be independant.  Kids love to do things for themselves.  <br/>
Sometimes, it&#39;s hard to let them make their own lunch, for example.  You <br/>
fear the mess, etc.  Really, it doesn&#39;t take long to clean up any messes <br/>
they might not be able to do themselves.  When my kids want to make <br/>
themselves lunch (usually a pb&j and fruit) I help them get what they need <br/>
and give them a wet wash cloth.  They are very good about wiping up any <br/>
spills and feel so proud when they *cook* all by themselves :)<br/>
<br/>
Just relax and let your kids take up a litle slack where they might enjoy <br/>
doing so.  It also helps to accept the fact that most home/unschoolers <br/>
*don&#39;t* have a clean house.  Strive for picked up and clean at night or on <br/>
the weekends.  Or in Spurts!  It is possible!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this blabber helped in some way! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-251270659">Well this was one recent post that caught my eye. <br/>
<br/>
If someone were to ask me what I do for myself I would have to answer take care of my family. That&#39;s really what I do.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing that my children have all their needs met, making sure all the pets have the same, my husband&#39;s needs and taking care of the house, I have no time or energy for anything else. And I can honestly say I have no desire to get out with friends or have an interest that is solely my own. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t go out with the girls. Our local homeschool group did a moms night out. I never went. I have no desire in the evening to be away from my children and my husband. Once in awhile I may take a trip to the grocery store or Target without any children but that&#39;s it. My husband and I do dinner or a movie alone maybe once or twice at the most in a month. It&#39;s actually been about 2 months though since we did that. Everything we pretty much do is with our children. Everything I pretty much do is with my children. I never do any kind of tupperware or such parties because that would take me away from my famliy to be with a bunch of women instead. Not my idea of fun. <br/>
<br/>
The only time I have been away from my children is when I had one and was in the hospital, spent the night out briefly 2 Valentines days ago and went to Chicago for Oprah with Tara. In 9 years, that&#39;s the extent of my away from the children time. I get my grown up talk when my children meet with others and I have their moms to talk with. I have this list that gets read when the kids are eating or like right now, totally into playing with their hermit crabs. I also stay up until 2 a.m. so I have plenty of time then to read the news and check out this list or anything else on the web I&#39;m searching for. I get an occasional magazine to read once in awhile but mostly the new issue is out before I&#39;ve read the old one. I do vedge with my husband and a tv show every so often but that&#39;s totally with the children either watching with us or coming back and forth to interact. Movies that we only want to watch alone are done after midnight on the weekends when the kids for the most part are alseep.<br/>
<br/>
I really am happy with the way things are. If our health holds up, my husband and I will have plenty of time when the children won&#39;t want to hang around us all the time. We&#39;ll have our alone time then. I see it already with Tara. And if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, I would have no regrets at all as to how I parent. <br/>

Well all in all you are very busy.<br/>
And doing everything you do during the day,<br/>
and spending hours past mid-night, to have time<br/>
to yourself, at least you are getting that.<br/>
<br/>
I often find myself, turing down invites when I should<br/>
just break out of my habits and do them. I have found out<br/>
that too much time devoted to the daily rituals, can turn<br/>
on me if I sometimes are not more outgoing. Cabin fever<br/>
in the fall and winter time, can really take its toll.<br/>
I am also very devoted to my family. Some others may have<br/>
their own description of what I am doing and think I am<br/>
just passing the buck, and too lazy to get a job. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, it will all pan out in the end. My Mom was<br/>
there for us, and those are my intentions.<br/>

<br/>
You just explained my life!<br/>
I even took my kids to our anniversary dinner at Bugaboo Creek! I too stay up <br/>

feel I spent too much time on this computer but my love for this has rubbed <br/>
off on my son. How sweet it is!<br/>

my entire life.  We coexist.  I am always there for them, when they have a <br/>
question or a suggestion of something fun I hadn&#39;t thought of I drop what I <br/>
am doing and we go, but I have time to quilt, read, play, bake, write etc.  <br/>
Sometimes they will come up and ask what I am doing and I explain and ask if <br/>
they want to help.  <br/>
<br/>
They play by themselves a lot.  And sometimes they don&#39;t want me there <br/>
playing with them.  They have something in mind and don&#39;t want my &quot;help.&quot;  My <br/>
youngest can be on the computer playing some sort of game and get frustrated <br/>
and I ask if he wants some help.  He often says no.  Just because we spend <br/>
all day together doesn&#39;t mean I am totally wrapped in what they are doing.  <br/>
They have their own lives.  <br/>
<br/>
That may have sounded like I was criticizing you or saying you are a &quot;bad <br/>
parent,&quot; that was not my intent at all.  I just wanted to say that just <br/>
because we are together all day doesn&#39;t mean that we do everything together <br/>
all day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319089212">I have a feeling that those mom&#39;s who do little for themselves here <br/>
have small kiddies at home still - (under 10?).  Please, those of you <br/>
who say you don&#39;t have time or &quot;desire&quot; to take time out for <br/>
yourselves - DO IT!  If nothing more than letting your hubby stay with <br/>
the kids while you go roam around the mall or take a walk outside or a <br/>
bubble bath with a good book or magazine.  I was like you when my <br/>
babies were littler (they are now 14, 12, and 10).  I was a SAHM and <br/>
went to college - carried a 4.0 with a full courseload, and basically <br/>
was raising them by myself because daddy worked about 80 hours a week.  <br/>
I did nothing &#39;for myself&#39; either - although the classes at college I <br/>
ADORED, it was still &quot;work&quot;.  We never got a sitter - ok, once, in 4 <br/>
years, on our anniversary when my MIL physically came and MADE us <br/>
leave the house without the kids...LOL<br/>
<br/>
At the time I thought I was doing the best for my kids - being there <br/>
for them 24/7/365 - always, forever, and no butts about it!  But, <br/>
looking back - I see that I probably hindered their growth (not to <br/>
mention my own) more than I&#39;ll ever know.  They are now pretty <br/>
independent and I have plenty of time to do things for &quot;me&quot; (reading, <br/>
walking, surfing the Net, etc) but I see sometimes how I &quot;smothered&quot; <br/>
them - for lack of a better term - and my constant catering to them <br/>
did them more harm than good.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, provide for your children - shower them with love and affection <br/>
and all their neccessities.  But take time for you too - you may not <br/>
&quot;think&quot; you want it, but you NEED it.  :)</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t tell you how much I disagree.  If you don&#39;t have your own <br/>
interests, you&#39;re robbing your children of an important part of <br/>
life.  <br/>
<br/>
Read The Continuum Concept.  Children are not biologically designed <br/>
to have their mothers sit there playing with them all day long.  <br/>
They&#39;re designed to follow us and learn what the world is about by <br/>
seeing what adults do.  That&#39;s why so many toys are miniatures of <br/>
adult items, like stoves.  Kids play because it&#39;s how they learn <br/>
about the world and practice their role in it.  Many, many kids&#39; toys <br/>
are farms and farm animals.  That goes back to a time in this country <br/>
when children would grow up actually working on a farm and taking <br/>
care of animals.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that when I try to do things specifically because I think <br/>
the children will like them, they start whining and throwing <br/>
tantrums, which is not how they usually act.  For example, we take <br/>
them camping or on picnics or to the Renaissance Festival or the <br/>
bookstore or whatever because my husband and I enjoy these things.  <br/>
My children have a great time and everyone&#39;s happy.  But if I take <br/>
them somewhere &quot;for kids&quot; that I don&#39;t personally enjoy, like Chuck <br/>
E. Cheese&#39;s, they start fighting, and yelling, and crying.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s healthy for children for everything to be about them <br/>
(unless it&#39;s their birthday).<br/>
<br/>
One way I spend time alongside my children while pursuing my own <br/>
interests is to have a sofa in their playroom where I can read, <br/>
write, or whatever I&#39;m doing.  I have a lap available for snuggles, <br/>
and they climb up and down, but I&#39;m not actually playing with their <br/>
toys with them.  <br/>
<br/>
My grandmother had six kids, and every one of her kids adored her and <br/>
considered her a wonderful mother.  I guarantee she didn&#39;t sit around <br/>
playing with them all day. It&#39;s not neglect for parents to have adult <br/>
lives.  It&#39;s natural.  <br/>
<br/>
Childhood is playing in the dirt while mother gardens, playing with <br/>
the suds while mother does dishes, lying on your back staring at <br/>
clouds while mother reads a book, playing with your own ball of yarn <br/>
while mother crochets.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying we only do adult things here.  Goodness knows, I&#39;m not <br/>
the one who watches television.  They must own a hundred or more <br/>
videos.  I can sing along with any kids&#39; song.  And we&#39;re looking <br/>
into attending a monster truck rally because the boys want to.  But <br/>
even a monster truck rally is something adults do that kids can come <br/>
along with.  It&#39;s not a &quot;kid thing&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I think designing everything around kids is a mistake, and it&#39;s one <br/>
reason so many kids are so unhappy.  Their job is to learn about the <br/>
adult world that they&#39;ll live in.  They can&#39;t do that if all they see <br/>
is &quot;especially for kids&quot; and the adults in their lives have no <br/>
interests other than children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279116530">And lest someone think my post about mothers following their own <br/>
interests means I leave my kids with babysitters, I have never once <br/>
hired a babysitter.  In fact, I haven&#39;t attended the local <br/>
unschoolers&#39; meetings because kids were not welcome.  I don&#39;t leave <br/>
my kids.  Someone suggested I should just leave them at home with <br/>
their father, but I didn&#39;t see the point of the mother alone <br/>
attending an unschooling meeting, when unschooling is a family <br/>
lifestyle.  I spend all my time with my family, but I pursue my own <br/>
interests and they pursue theirs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201502098">Before we came into unschooling, we were Waldorf-inspired homeschoolers.  I <br/>
HIGHLY recommend You Are Your Child&#39;s First Teacher by Rahima Baldwin.  It <br/>
is a fantastic book!  Some of the Waldorf concepts, such as media exclusion <br/>
may need to be passed up for some families, but it addresses this situation <br/>
beautifully!<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, you do your children a grave disservice by neglecting to be a woman <br/>
and all that it entails.  What do we teach our children who may decide they <br/>
don&#39;t want children or marriage??  They have no role model if our only <br/>
description of ourselves is wife and mother.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone happen to catch Oprah last week about sex wars???  This thread <br/>
reminds me of the mother who refused [a certain form of sex] because she was <br/>
a mom!  Her words went something like... Respectable mothers don&#39;t DO that!! <br/>
  It was a great laugh!<br/>

E. Cheese&#39;s, they start fighting, and yelling, and crying.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s healthy for children for everything to be about them<br/>
(unless it&#39;s their birthday).<br/>
<br/>
One way I spend time alongside my children while pursuing my own<br/>
interests is to have a sofa in their playroom where I can read,<br/>
write, or whatever I&#39;m doing.  I have a lap available for snuggles,<br/>
and they climb up and down, but I&#39;m not actually playing with their<br/>
toys with them.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother had six kids, and every one of her kids adored her and<br/>
considered her a wonderful mother.  I guarantee she didn&#39;t sit around<br/>
playing with them all day. It&#39;s not neglect for parents to have adult<br/>
lives.  It&#39;s natural.<br/>
<br/>
Childhood is playing in the dirt while mother gardens, playing with<br/>
the suds while mother does dishes, lying on your back staring at<br/>
clouds while mother reads a book, playing with your own ball of yarn<br/>
while mother crochets.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying we only do adult things here.  Goodness knows, I&#39;m not<br/>
the one who watches television.  They must own a hundred or more<br/>
videos.  I can sing along with any kids&#39; song.  And we&#39;re looking<br/>
into attending a monster truck rally because the boys want to.  But<br/>
even a monster truck rally is something adults do that kids can come<br/>
along with.  It&#39;s not a &quot;kid thing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think designing everything around kids is a mistake, and it&#39;s one<br/>
reason so many kids are so unhappy.  Their job is to learn about the<br/>
adult world that they&#39;ll live in.  They can&#39;t do that if all they see<br/>
is &quot;especially for kids&quot; and the adults in their lives have no<br/>
interests other than children.<br/>

  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] moms doing what they want<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Well this was one recent post that caught my eye. <br/>
<br/>
  If someone were to ask me what I do for myself I would have to answer take care of my family. That&#39;s really what I do.<br/>
<br/>
  After seeing that my children have all their needs met, making sure all the pets have the same, my husband&#39;s needs and taking care of the house, I have no time or energy for anything else. And I can honestly say I have no desire to get out with friends or have an interest that is solely my own. <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t go out with the girls. Our local homeschool group did a moms night out. I never went. I have no desire in the evening to be away from my children and my husband. Once in awhile I may take a trip to the grocery store or Target without any children but that&#39;s it. My husband and I do dinner or a movie alone maybe once or twice at the most in a month. It&#39;s actually been about 2 months though since we did that. Everything we pretty much do is with our children. Everything I pretty much do is with my children. I never do any kind of tupperware or such parties because that would take me away from my famliy to be with a bunch of women instead. Not my idea of fun. <br/>
<br/>
  The only time I have been away from my children is when I had one and was in the hospital, spent the night out briefly 2 Valentines days ago and went to Chicago for Oprah with Tara. In 9 years, that&#39;s the extent of my away from the children time. I get my grown up talk when my children meet with others and I have their moms to talk with. I have this list that gets read when the kids are eating or like right now, totally into playing with their hermit crabs. I also stay up until 2 a.m. so I have plenty of time then to read the news and check out this list or anything else on the web I&#39;m searching for. I get an occasional magazine to read once in awhile but mostly the new issue is out before I&#39;ve read the old one. I do vedge with my husband and a tv show every so often but that&#39;s totally with the children either watching with us or coming back and forth to interact. Movies that we only want to watch alone are done after midnight on the weekends when the kids for the most part are alseep.<br/>
<br/>
  I really am happy with the way things are. If our health holds up, my husband and I will have plenty of time when the children won&#39;t want to hang around us all the time. We&#39;ll have our alone time then. I see it already with Tara. And if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, I would have no regrets at all as to how I parent. <br/>

&lt;&lt; I think designing everything around kids is a mistake, and it&#39;s one <br/>
<br/>
reason so many kids are so unhappy.  Their job is to learn about the <br/>
<br/>
adult world that they&#39;ll live in.  They can&#39;t do that if all they see <br/>
<br/>
is &quot;especially for kids&quot; and the adults in their lives have no <br/>
<br/>
interests other than children. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with that whole post but wanted to say something about this one as <br/>
applied to videos.<br/>
<br/>
Our whole family really likes kid videos AND adult videos.  I read through <br/>
all the songs on a three-DVD Sesame Street thing yesterday and decided we <br/>
already have enough on tapes we made ourselves.  My husband has done analysis <br/>
on what rock&#39;n&#39;roll songs were being parodied on Sesame Street for kids, and <br/>
then right after that they kids will curl up with him to watch James Bond or <br/>
The Thirteenth Warrior or Lethal Weapon or something.  And the next day maybe <br/>
Disney&#39;s Jungle Book, or Aladdin.<br/>
<br/>
Again, not an all or none thing.  I love Lego and hadn&#39;t found much (except <br/>
bricklaying and sculpture) that Lego directly applied to, but just last week <br/>
Keith told us about reading about some portable bridge-making stuff being <br/>
used in Iraq by army engineers who said it was basically engineering and big <br/>
legos.  The figure out where the bridge needs to be, put it together, and <br/>
take it apart later (he thought).  So is Lego a kid-version of an adult thing <br/>
now?  Or were the adults just doing the grownup version of Lego? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that in our culture a rejection of all kid-stuff is possible or <br/>
healthy, but I do TOTALLY agree that kids need to be around adult stuff.  <br/>
They benefit hugely even from hearing and seeing things they don&#39;t fully <br/>
understand and trying to piece it together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135084336"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If I pursued my own interests, I would be neglecting my kids.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t tell you how much I disagree.  If you don&#39;t have your own <br/>
&gt; interests, you&#39;re robbing your children of an important part of <br/>
&gt; life.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would you say that reading these message boards is pursuing my own <br/>
interest?  Is it enough of an interest?  Right now my biggest <br/>
interest is being able to get enough sleep and have a little bit of <br/>
time to myself to read.  A little bit of alone time with dh and a <br/>
movie with him now and then.  When those things happen I&#39;m happy.  <br/>
Sometimes they don&#39;t and I start to get stressed--like if I get no <br/>
time to check the message boards for a couple of days.  But I know I <br/>
need *something* to myself and I try to always get it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Read The Continuum Concept.  Children are not biologically designed <br/>
&gt; to have their mothers sit there playing with them all day long.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what do you tell your kids when they ask you to play with them? <br/>
No, sorry, I have to do my own thing? Reading this book is more <br/>
important than playing with you?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read it.  It&#39;s a great book.  But it just feels wrong to me to <br/>
tell my kids no when they ask me to play with them.  And they ask a <br/>
lot. Also, we don&#39;t live in that kind of a society.  We just don&#39;t!  <br/>
  <br/>

&gt; My children have a great time and everyone&#39;s happy.  But if I take <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?  I&#39;ve found the opposite to be true.  When I take them <br/>
somewhere they don&#39;t care about, they fight and complain and whine. <br/>
AS a matter of fact, my son is a huge behavior problem when I take <br/>
him somewhere he doesn&#39;t want to go.  I often put off trips to the <br/>
grocery store or library until dh gets home from work so that my 5 <br/>
year old doesn&#39;t have to go along.  When I go somewhere for them, <br/>
they&#39;re happy.  So what I try to do is find things that I can do <br/>
while we&#39;re there that will make all of us happy.  I take a book <br/>
along to Mcdonalds and read for an hour while they&#39;re pretending the <br/>
ball pits are Freddi Fish&#39;s whirlpools.  Sometimes I take them to the <br/>
park and follow them around for hours with their dump trucks, sitting <br/>
in the sand box with them, pushing them in swings.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s impossible for kids to see only stuff that is especially <br/>
for kids.  My kids go shopping with me (when they want to or when <br/>
they have no other choice), to appointments, family gatherings, <br/>
restaurants, play video games with their dad that they wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
exposed to if they didn&#39;t see him playing them.  <br/>
<br/>
But they need me to do things with them.  If I only had one child I <br/>
could see where I&#39;d have oodles of time to myself.  Or if my children <br/>
were all older.  But my 3 kids are all under 10 and even if I only <br/>
just met their physical needs it would take a huge part of my day.  <br/>
<br/>
I think of the sheer pleasure I feel when I play a boardgame WITH my <br/>
daughter and see her figuring something out.  Or the enjoyment I get <br/>
when I watch a movie with them that I otherwise never would have <br/>
chosen.  Or helping them figure out a new way to build their train <br/>
track.  I can&#39;t imagine trading the joy in those kinds of things for <br/>
pursuing some other interest.  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;If nothing more than letting your hubby stay with<br/>
 the kids while you go roam around the mall or take a walk outside or a<br/>
 bubble bath with a good book or magazine&gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hate the mall and I hate shopping unless it&#39;s for someone else. In which<br/>
case at least one or all of the children would be with me. They love to<br/>
shop, go figure!<br/>
I also hate bubble baths because all I do is sit there and think of<br/>
everything else I could be doing. Wasted time for me.<br/>
If I would go for a walk, the kids would want to come also and how could I<br/>
possible go alone when I would see so many neat things the kids would be<br/>
missing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes, provide for your children - shower them with love and affection<br/>
 and all their neccessities.  But take time for you too - you may not<br/>
&quot;think&quot; you want it, but you NEED it.  :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I do provide and I actually do cater to my children. I don&#39;t see that<br/>
as a bad thing with the way it all works here. I enjoy doing that. It&#39;s<br/>
something I do very well. Taking care of others. I&#39;m sure a lot of people<br/>
would say I have issues but I&#39;m happy now and so is my family and that works<br/>
for me. Well for us actually. I don&#39;t expect everyone to feel and do the<br/>
same. Just as I couldn&#39;t imagine going on any kind of trip without my<br/>
husband. Or either one of us having a regular guy or girls night out every<br/>
week. I&#39;m just very fortunate that I found a soulmate. First time around I<br/>
wasn&#39;t so lucky.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Indeed, you do your children a grave disservice by neglecting to be a<br/>
woman<br/>
 and all that it entails.  What do we teach our children who may decide they<br/>
 don&#39;t want children or marriage??  They have no role model if our only<br/>
 description of ourselves is wife and mother.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see that being a wife and mother encompasses so much, why wouldn&#39;t I be a<br/>
great role model of understanding and love and doing whatever it is one<br/>
wants to do? Do I have to go out and get a paying job to be a good role<br/>
model? Can&#39;t I do that staying home with my family and having interests I<br/>
can talk about without actually leaving my family to go and do it? I do have<br/>
many things I have done in my life, and many things I look forward to doing.<br/>
Staying home with my children is a relatively small part of my life.<br/>
(meaning I live to be a ripe old age) It&#39;s important to me to give it all I<br/>
can while still being happy. For me, maybe it&#39;s giving it a bit differently<br/>
than someone else. Certainly doesn&#39;t make it less important for me or my<br/>
family.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I need things like that - things that I do totally w/ me and for me.<br/>

 But - obviously, this works for you.....<br/>
 That&#39;s great:)&gt;&gt;<br/>

There&#39;s that magic word there. &quot;I need things like that&quot; meaning you, not<br/>
me. I have more than enough me time alone from about midnight until 2 a.m.<br/>
every week night. Doesn&#39;t really matter that in that time I may not do what<br/>
some of you consider quality time for me. It&#39;s my time and I do enjoy it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902285990">***I&#39;m sure a lot of people would say I have issues but I&#39;m happy now and so <br/>
is my family and that worksfor me.****<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you have issues, I just wonder if it is possible that the <br/>
whole picture may not be represented?  Perhaps there are things you do for <br/>
yourself that haven&#39;t been mentioned??<br/>
<br/>
Not so long ago, my husband pointed out to me that I&#39;d better think of <br/>
something I enjoy other than children because one day they will all be grown <br/>
and out of the house and then what will I have left???  He doesn&#39;t *want* to <br/>
be my sole interest!<br/>
<br/>
I still agree with Sorcha (? - not sure now) that your children need to see <br/>
you living your own life.  Not separate from them, alongside them.  From <br/>
what you have written, it *sounds* like your children and your husband are <br/>
your entire life.  That sounds good in theory, but in practice it puts an <br/>
awful lot of pressure and responsibility onto them that may not be apparent <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like if you examine a bit more closely, you may find that you *do* <br/>
have interests of your own or have the desire for them to be there.  I only <br/>
say that because I have been exactly where you describe to be and only <br/>
*after* I pursued my own passions, did I realize what happiness truly is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796494074">Gee, I so appreciate the concern for my health and welfare concering this<br/>
issue. (and yes that was sarcastic) Let&#39;s see, I&#39;m not a good unschooling<br/>
example, I need outside help and it&#39;s not healthy the way I am. Judgements<br/>
all of them and not really necessary at all. I never wrote in with a problem<br/>
I wanted fixed. Of course the whole picture isn&#39;t represented here. I was<br/>
just stating how I am and what works for me. Some here can&#39;t seem to<br/>
understand that and it&#39;s fine. I really have no need for approval here. What<br/>
I don&#39;t like is the judgements that I can&#39;t really be happy and healthy this<br/>
way and neither are my children. I&#39;m not going to be sitting home rocking<br/>
myself when the children are grown. Really I won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I do live my life. I never said I didn&#39;t have any friends. I never said I<br/>
don&#39;t do anything for myself. I never said nothing ever interests me but<br/>
kids. Just because I don&#39;t go out with the girls and bike ride every day<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not living. The assumptions here abound.<br/>
<br/>
And I have found true happiness. I&#39;m just wondering how some of you can have<br/>
such a problem with me finding it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832047596">*********** It also helps to accept the fact that most home/unschoolers <br/>
*don&#39;t* have a clean house. Strive for picked up and clean at night or on <br/>
the weekends. Or in Spurts! It is possible!!!<br/>
 Hope this blabber helped in some way! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m glad to hear it because ours is usually what some would consider <br/>
trashed&quot;<br/>
I bought a sign on one of our vacations that reads <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This place cleaned every other day, sorry you missed it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For some reason It helps me remember that its OK.. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I had someone tell me once they liked my house better than theirs for visits<br/>
because it was so &quot;lived-in&quot;  .. I took it as a huge compliment but I don&#39;t<br/>
know they intended it that way!  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232208382">&quot;My kids constantly ask me to play *with* them.  What do you suggest I <br/>
tell them?  No?  I have my own interests to pursue?  You pursue <br/>
yours, I&#39;ll pursue mine?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned the hard way that kids need to learn to entertain themselves sometimes - it&#39;s part of learning.  The &quot;real world&quot; doesn&#39;t stop for anyone usually, and what will your kids do when they don&#39;t get their way *right away* when they are older?  I&#39;m battling this right now with my 10yo DD - she has honestly NEVER had to entertain herself, on her own, because I was always dropping everything whenever my kids wanted to play or whatever.  But (bad mommy moment here) - sometimes I need time to do things like catch up on work or what have you, without them underfoot.  (I know I might get beaten up for saying this here LOL)  Sure, I can let her help - I&#39;m sure my boss would LOVE that!  Maybe I have a different take on things because I am a single mom - I don&#39;t have the luxury of dropping everything to play with my kids every single time they ask - it&#39;s just part of our life and it&#39;s part of &quot;real life&quot; for alot of folks.  I *so* wish I could still be a SAHM and do just that, but I can&#39;t and my kids understand that now.  And I think it makes them stronger to have to do things for themselves sometimes (play quietly in their room, play the keyboard/guitar without an audience sometimes, etc) rather than knowing &quot;Oh boy! The world really DOES revolve around me!&quot;  I&#39;m afraid if it still did, they&#39;d get a very rude awakening later in life. :(<br/>
