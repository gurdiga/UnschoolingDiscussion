<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lots of people would probably say that encouraging her<br/>
&gt; to be with you doing the real things you&#39;re doing is better than you doing<br/>
&gt; the make-believe stuff with her.  But some of both.  Sorting laundry, putting<br/>
&gt; away groceries, working in the yard--that time spent together would be really<br/>
&gt; valuable too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, thank you, I totally needed to hear that today, Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been totally occupied in packing this week, and I think that&#39;s ALL Tim<br/>
has done all week, too.  He&#39;s been making boxes by himself, labelling stuff,<br/>
bringing things for me to pack, helping sort, and all that.  Honestly, he&#39;s<br/>
more obsessed with doing it all than I am!<br/>
<br/>
It helps to be reminded that *time spent together* is really valuable.  When<br/>
I&#39;m totally exhausted, it feels more like I&#39;m using him as a small (but<br/>
incredibly willing!) slave.<br/>
