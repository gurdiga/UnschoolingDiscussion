<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736275864">I had my dd with me at the grocery yesterday.  A clerk asked if it was<br/>
spring break.  I told her my kids don&#39;t go to school.  She sounded<br/>
surprised.  &quot;They don&#39;t?&quot;  I said they learn at home.  She said, oh, you<br/>
homeschool.  Then proceeded to tell me about some relative of hers who<br/>
homeschools.<br/>

The other day, she caught herself about to tell someone<br/>
her hair looked nice on the phone.</div>
