<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874386632">Contrary. That word probably sums my 10yo daughter up best. She has always <br/>
been this way. She doesn&#39;t like people telling her what to do, she questions <br/>
(argues) everything. We had a very difficult time while I subjected her to <br/>
public schooling from preschool through half of fourth grade, until she <br/>
stopped a year ago. She never listened to authority, didn&#39;t give much effort <br/>
at doing homework and paying attention, she would spend more energy getting <br/>
out of boring tasks. And I tried being drill sergeant with her all along. It <br/>
never worked well. I finally came to my senses and found out about <br/>
unschooling. I decided to be positive about my unique child. I use positive <br/>
adjectives to describe her &quot;difficult&quot; personality traits, and don&#39;t engage <br/>
in arguments as much anymore. I have curbed my perfectionistic attitudes. I <br/>
believe unschooling works, and it has helped me be a better parent. She is <br/>
rebelling from unschooling now. Is that even possible? She wants to return to <br/>
school. She wanted to at the beginning of this school year, and believing in <br/>
interest-led choices, I was going to let her, but she changed her mind. She <br/>
wants to go again(next fall). I am reading The Teenage Liberation Handbook, <br/>
trying to gain perspective, but she doesn&#39;t want to hear about any of it. She <br/>
wants to go to 6th grade, junior high. She wants a locker, to change classes, <br/>
play in the band, see her friends. I can relate, I was so excited about <br/>
starting junior high(7th grade). Now she wants me to play teacher with her. <br/>
She wants me to dole out tedious assignments so she can get used to being <br/>
ordered around. It is almost amusing the way she begs &quot;why can&#39;t you just <br/>
make me do something!&quot; But it&#39;s not funny. I have acquired such a distaste <br/>
for anything schoolish, and have explained my role as facilitator to her. I <br/>
try to help her brainstorm. I try to give her tools for self discovery. She <br/>
says she is lazy and wants me to tell her what to do. I am afraid the <br/>
progress I have seen over the past year was a mirage. I am afraid she still <br/>
thinks she will be stupid if she doesn&#39;t go to school and someone doesn&#39;t <br/>
tell her what she needs to know. I have deschooled myself more in the past <br/>
year than she has. I have waited patiently for her to get excited about <br/>
learning again, and it was finally happening. Now this. Most of all she wants <br/>
to just fight with me. She wants to do the extreme opposite of what I think, <br/>
and has always been this way. I am not sure what to do. I have been ignoring <br/>
the attitude and vicious words, but she just gets worse. Slamming doors, <br/>
rolling eyes. She acts like she hates me, because I DON&#39;T make her go to <br/>
school. I told her she can stay in her room until her meanness passes. I had <br/>
her at 19, so I am a pretty young mother that has gained more confidence in <br/>
the past few years. I know I have made countless mistakes with her, and have <br/>
really felt we have made up for so much being together in the past year. What <br/>
can I say, she is so much like me. Extreme thinking, gets caught in negative <br/>
traps where nothing pleases her. Sensation-seeking, drama-making, and her <br/>
current tirade against me. She is trying to use her school choice against me. <br/>
She said if I get her a cellphone, she won&#39;t go to school. (her 13yo cousin <br/>
got one for Christmas, I have no idea why, but I am not in favor of a child <br/>
too young to drive having a cell phone) <br/>
<br/>
Give it to me honestly, trusted mentors. I thought I was handling it well and <br/>
was seeing positive results. She really has come a long way in some areas, <br/>
will this little rough patch pass? I know she is bored and we haven&#39;t been <br/>
able to get out much with the constant snow advisories.....well she has now <br/>
come back asking to start the day over, wanting to do a project with <br/>
me......If I can get any practical feedback just from the little info I have <br/>
given today, to avoid further power struggles, I would be so grateful. <br/>

Is there an aikido teacher in the house?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t explain it but I think there are others who can.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I told her she can stay in her room until her meanness passes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t seem the best.  <br/>
<br/>
Could you have taken her to a restaurant and put food in her and tell her <br/>
funny stories until her meanness evaporated and turned to a pleasant exchange <br/>
and a shared time?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been deschooling in one place and she&#39;s been deschooling in her <br/>
room, or with her friends, you haven&#39;t spent the time as you might have. <br/>
<br/>
There is an amazing thread on just that thing at unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>

I think that gives you access to the current and older parts.  <br/>
Read from the beginning, until you get the gist and maybe more if it&#39;s fun.<br/>
This is one of the best discussions I&#39;ve ever seen about really BEING with <br/>
your kids.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;well she has now <br/>

<br/>
Yes!!   <br/>
 <br/>
I have to agree,    we were getting ready to leave for a few days and there I was stuck to the computer,  reading that thread.     Kids and dad,  standing, tapping their feet,  &quot;OK, Mom,  lets go, we&#39;re ready!&quot;               <br/>
 <br/>
I really think the part about how important it is for new unschoolers to spend lots of time with their kids and really listening and &#39;being&#39; with them was so great.         So often when my kids were absorbed in something I would then think,  &quot;OK, now this is when I can go get something done.&quot;           Well,  that would also be the exact time that I could be learning the most about my child.      I learned that from that discussion!<br/>
 <br/>
It is a great read.      Thanks to those of you who participated!   Thanks for your time.<br/>
