<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675561468">I think it&#39;s Janice Van Cleave that writes great intoductory science <br/>
books - something like Chemistry for Everyone or Every Kid.  You <br/>
would have to expand on it from there, but it would be a great place <br/>
to start.  <br/>

&gt; dont understand the metric parts either.I wasnt real great in Math in<br/>
&gt; school.I had some suggestions about going to Fl high school online but<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; didnt like their attitude about a few things.Please somebody help<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124839893">There is a great book called Chemistry for Every Kid by J. Van Cleave. It<br/>
has great experiments and talks through concepts well. It is part of a<br/>
series including physics and other stuff and it is enjoyable. It might be a<br/>
good place to start.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My older daughter (now age 11) started doing UMO stuff when she was 9.<br/>
She wanted to take high school biology but the local high school<br/>
couldn&#39;t deal with it.  We signed her up for a high school life sciences<br/>
course with University of Missouri Independent Study/Center for Distance<br/>
Learning.  They&#39;ve got courses ranging from elementary all the way<br/>
through graduate school.<br/>
<br/>
The course came with a textbook, and a separate learning manual drawn up<br/>
a Missouri teacher.  After each lesson, there was a 20+ question<br/>
progress evaluation, which could be sent in by mail or via computer.<br/>
There is also a midterm and a final exam, which is closed book -- no<br/>
text or notes and timed.  Our local library was happy to serve as<br/>
proctor.  The course was extremely well organized.  The kids can learn<br/>
at their own pace (there is a 9-month maximum per course, but even with<br/>
that there are extensions.)  Ali could do 3 lessons a week, or 1 a<br/>
month, as she chose.  She didn&#39;t find it at all drive, but she began<br/>
highly motivated.<br/>

My daughter has since taken Algebra 1 through UMO which is needed to<br/>
take on their chemistry course.  We actually ordered the chemistry<br/>
course first (because that is what she really wanted), but it became<br/>
instantly clear to her that she&#39;d need the Algebra to succeed at it.  We<br/>
had no problem exchanging.<br/>
<br/>
My forthcoming book And the Skylark Sings with Me: Adventures in<br/>
Homeschooling and Community-Based Education (it will be out September<br/>
20) will have several chapters devoted to science, nature, and math<br/>
education.  In about 6 days, my website will be up, and it will include<br/>
a sample chapter which deals with learning in the life sciences and our<br/>
experiences in nature education (www.skylarksings.com)<br/>

mail.  With algebra, she sends them in via computer.  Via computer, she<br/>
gets instant scoring, finds out where she made errors, explanations, and<br/>
places where she could study further in her materials.<br/>
