<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On this note, I just had an interesting conversation with my SIL yesterday.  <br/>
She has a 3+-year-old girl and when she turns 4 she&#39;ll &quot;graduate&quot; from her <br/>
co-op daycare (she&#39;s only there part of one day a week - either my BIL or SIL <br/>
is home all the other times).  So now they&#39;re starting to think of <br/>
pre-school.  They know I work in homeschooling and that we&#39;ll be unschooling <br/>
our children, though they don&#39;t have a clear idea yet of what unschooling <br/>
means.  Anyway, previously whenever homeschooling came up they both always <br/>
said, oh, we could never do that and made positive comments about ps.  <br/>
Yesterday, for the first time, I my SIL said, &quot;I hate school.&quot;  I was amazed. <br/>
 I think as it gets closer to really sending her daughter she&#39;s having more <br/>
negative thoughts about it.  We all talked about it for awhile yesterday.  <br/>
Actually, DH did most of the talking.  He&#39;s much more into trying to convince <br/>
them than I am.  (I think it would be great for them to unschool but I think <br/>
they need to feel ready, not be pushed.)  Anyway, most of their arguments <br/>
were pretty feeble, things like, &quot;How would she learn a foreign language?&quot;  <br/>
Eventually, it came down to what I think is the real reason for my SIL - she <br/>
feels like she would be giving up her life and she doesn&#39;t want to do that.  <br/>
She&#39;s tired of being home with her daughter a lot and wants time where she <br/>
isn&#39;t there.  Much to my surprise, my BIL suggested that they could share - <br/>
he being there two days and she the other two and both for three.  I was <br/>
amazed.  But she didn&#39;t really respond to that suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
At this point they plan to put her into ps and &quot;see what happens.&quot;  They&#39;re <br/>
pretty protective, so I wonder how it will fall out.  Unfortunately, not <br/>
having children yet, they can&#39;t be dazzled by our children&#39;s awesome success <br/>
as unschoolers. ;-)  <br/>

disguise it.  She knows they could work it out.  She admits that it&#39;s <br/>
selfish.  And they have pretty much avoided day-care, which is good (and much <br/>
more than some people I know have done).  <br/>
<br/>
One argument that I&#39;ve heard is the notion that mothers think their children <br/>
(especially daughters) will have a better concept of them (the mother) and <br/>
women in general if they&#39;re in a career instead of a SAHM.  When I was <br/>
discussing this with a friend of mine (who is SAH but doesn&#39;t HS) she laughed <br/>
and said her daughter has a friend whose mother is some important business <br/>
woman and hence is always gone on business trips, etc.  This woman&#39;s daughter <br/>
has no real concept of what her mother does, she just hates that she&#39;s gone <br/>
so much.  When my friend asked her daughter if she would like her to work, <br/>
her daughter said, &quot;Well, it would be neat if you worked at a pizza place so <br/>
you could bring home pizza for dinner every night.&quot; <br/>
;-);-);-);-)<br/>
<br/>
I think as adults it&#39;s easy to forget what the world is like through a <br/>
child&#39;s eyes and what&#39;s important to them.<br/>

it.  In fact, I rarely argue with anyone about anything (except DH of <br/>
course).  When they ask questions about HS or US I answer and I tell them <br/>
some of the philosophy behind it.  I think my SIL is a good mother, even if <br/>
she does some things differently than I would.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have statistics or anything, but I&#39;m not so sure it is a recent <br/>
thing.  I think the rich have always had nannies, nurses, tutors, <br/>
governesses, etc.  I think what&#39;s changed is economics.  More people can <br/>
afford to have others care for their children, so more people do.  <br/>
<br/>
Were there, statistically, more SAHMs in, say, the 50s?  Almost definitely.  <br/>
Did that mean they were happy there or that they were good mothers?  I don&#39;t <br/>
think so.  I prefer things now when women have more of a choice as to whether <br/>
they will be working moms or SAHMs.  I&#39;ve heard too many stories about angry, <br/>
bitter women addicted to alcohol/valium/whatever who were physically with <br/>
their children but had no good relationship with them whatsoever.  I guess I <br/>
just don&#39;t see this as better than school or day care.  A SAHM who chooses to <br/>
do so is great.  One who doesn&#39;t, well, that makes me uncomfortable.  (And <br/>
I&#39;m not saying you have to be a born SAHM - you can look at it as a necessary <br/>
sacrifice and still be great at it.  But it still has to be a choice.)  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m saying that choosing to do the right thing is much better than <br/>
being forced to do the right thing.  And that choosing to do the &quot;wrong&quot; or <br/>
&quot;lesser&quot; thing is also better than being forced to do the &quot;right&quot; thing.  <br/>
That&#39;s partly why I&#39;m attracted to unschooling in the first place.<br/>

<br/>
Our feelings, as a nation, toward motherhood changed when our feelings about<br/>
what &#39;family&#39;  &#39;husband&#39; and &#39;wife&#39; mean changed.  The whole women&#39;s<br/>
suffrage movement and subsequently the women&#39;s liberation movement came<br/>
about because somewhere along the line people a) stopped believing what the<br/>
Bible had to say about families and the role of men and women; b) women<br/>
started viewing their roles as inferior (even though they had the better end<br/>
of the deal imho). I am sure plenty of people won&#39;t agree with me but I do<br/>
believe that God had the roles of men and women perfectly laid out and only<br/>
our own selfishness has changed those roles.  The change in our attitude<br/>
toward mothering isn&#39;t new, it was a long time coming, it has just reached a<br/>
point now that it is unrecognizable in comparison to it&#39;s original form.<br/>
