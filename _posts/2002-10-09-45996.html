<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323412971">OK. Stupid question...how did they know that the baby was crying? And not just<br/>
opening and closing his/her mouth? Were there tears? Sound? Facial expression? <br/>
What made them say it was crying.<br/>
<br/>
Just trying to picture it and trying to figure out what purpose crying in utero<br/>
would serve...for some reason it is not making sense to me...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42036679">I think a baby would cry in utero for some of the same reasons a baby <br/>
would cry after birth.  Fear, pain, insecurity, maybe even sensing <br/>
his mother&#39;s sadness.  <br/>
<br/>
I have read that anytime the unborn baby feels like it is in danger <br/>
or is in pain, the baby will secrete the same hormones that we <br/>
secrete when we&#39;re in danger or in pain.  I&#39;ve read that autopsies of <br/>
aborted babies show very high levels of the hormones we secrete when <br/>
we have very high levels of fear and pain.  <br/>
<br/>
I have also read in books and articles on holistic health that trauma <br/>
in the womb can affect the baby&#39;s physical and emotional well-being <br/>
once born.  For example, hearing and sensing his mother in pain or <br/>
constantly weeping.  <br/>
