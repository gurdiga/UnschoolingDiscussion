<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782777270">I heard on the news last week that King Tut&#39;s mummy and some artifacts <br/>
from his tomb were going to start touring the US beginning this Summer <br/>
in L.A.  We&#39;re definitely planning a visit when the exhibit comes to <br/>
Chicago and I wanted to pass on this link for more info.   <br/>
