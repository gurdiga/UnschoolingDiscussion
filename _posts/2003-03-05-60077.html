&lt;&lt; When I have an adult friend over to visit I never expect them to help me<br/>
 clean up.  Why should we expect differently of kids? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What would you do to another adult that didn&#39;t clean up? Make them? Hint?<br/>
Or just graciously clean up after your guest?<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t really care for the analogy, because our children aren&#39;t guests <br/>
in our home. This home belongs to them too. And they have say in how they&#39;d <br/>
like things to be run, just like dh and I do. We don&#39;t override their needs <br/>
and vice versa.<br/>
So if they don&#39;t have a need for a very neat house and I do, it&#39;s MY problem.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t exclude asking them to think of my needs too though. But the <br/>
burden of keeping the house the way I like it should be mine.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

personally Ren.  In asking you have to be able to accept no or it isn&#39;t <br/>
asking.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I hugely agree with being a joyful, gracious host that doesn&#39;t focus on <br/>
the mess, but on the wonderful time spent with friends.<br/>
<br/>
It just sounded like someone (I don&#39;t know who) was saying they expect their <br/>
guests to clean up, why couldn&#39;t the children?<br/>
Maybe I misread it or maybe it was someone elses post, because I&#39;ve found <br/>
myself nodding in agreement with yours Pam.<br/>
