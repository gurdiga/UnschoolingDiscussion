<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179801276"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If anyone has a working Super Nintendo to sell us, I&#39;m probably<br/>
&gt; interested.  If anyone has used the clone type, made to play SNES<br/>
&gt; games but not made by Nintendo, I&#39;d appreciate advice or a review on<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We looked into buying an old Nintendo system and found that they&#39;ve<br/>
gone back up in price from when we last checked several years ago. I<br/>
was shocked at the prices because it seems just like yesterday (but<br/>
actually 8 or 9 years ago) that you could pick up a system for $10<br/>
that included a handful of games and all sorts of accessories. I<br/>
remember a thrift store in a nearby town had amassed a collection of<br/>
something like 90 units and they were practically giving them away.<br/>
<br/>
But now there is a big demand for good working systems because people<br/>
still enjoy playing but the units aren&#39;t lasting as long as the games.<br/>
Even some of the old games are becoming pricey now as they get harder<br/>
to find. We thought we could find a cheap Nintendo package to buy for<br/>
the kids, but they are well on their way to collector&#39;s status! The<br/>
Sega systems (Genesis and Saturn) are the same way.<br/>
<br/>
The store we were at had a clone system and the guy who owns the place<br/>
(a real video game geek who seems to know his stuff) said he&#39;s found<br/>
the clone units to be better than buying an old Nintendo unit (he had<br/>
some of those for sale, too). The one we looked at could play games<br/>
from several different Nintendo platforms and being new (rather than<br/>
used and 10 years old) was another plus. I think it was around $60 at<br/>
the store, which wasn&#39;t much more than the old systems were selling<br/>
for on eBay when we last checked.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about a Super Nintendo clone, but we got one of the ones that  <br/>
will play both NES and Super NES games, and its horrid. We&#39;ve never tried a <br/>
SNES  game on it, since that system works fine, but no one can move in the room <br/>
or  move the cord around anywhere near the base unit because it will move the <br/>
game  (which needs an adapter to work in the unit and stands very high and very <br/>
 unstably in the unit) and then it needs reset before you can play <br/>
anymore-which,  of course, means loss of all data. If you&#39;re going to go the clone <br/>
route,  I would suggest either getting one from somewhere that it can be tried out  <br/>
before purchase or have a good return policy. Personally, we both wish we&#39;d <br/>
have  scrounged and bought a previously owned unit at the higher cost. Good <br/>
luck,  whatever you decide!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

After I wrote, and Holly couldn&#39;t get the SNES to work, she ended up  <br/>
finding the Nintendo 64 and Marty helped her set that up and she  <br/>
played a while.  But in the course of looking through this and that,  <br/>
Marty figured out how to get the Wii to go online and they played  <br/>
with that.  Turns out you can download old games (for a fee, I guess;  <br/>
we didn&#39;t look that deeply) and the Wii controller, turned sideways,  <br/>
is an original Nintendo controller.  And Kirby says you can buy an  <br/>
SNES controller for it (or maybe he said 64, and maybe there are both).<br/>
