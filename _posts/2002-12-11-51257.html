<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And IF the early reading comes pretty easily, as it does for some kids in <br/>
&gt; school, what is lost is the opportunity for the parents and the child to <br/>
&gt; see <br/>
&gt; natural learning work.  If they can see reading come naturally, they won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; worry about other things a bit.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &#39;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s it!  That&#39;s what I don&#39;t want to interfer with...you are saying that <br/>
&gt; once one sees this process unfold, it is easier to let go of the worry <br/>
&gt; ...and then trust ?  This sort of thing did happen with me when my daughter <br/>
&gt; was a baby.  SHe was breastfed and did not want baby food at the <br/>
&gt; &quot;appropriate&quot; age.  I worried about it, but did not want to push food at <br/>
&gt; her.  I eventually foiund my way to a breastfeeding support group  and then <br/>
&gt; to LaLeache...she eventaully did begin to eat food, but not baby food or <br/>
&gt; pureed food...she began eating just food when she was arouind 2 yo.  Some <br/>
&gt; how, I was able to let go of my worries and trust her...talked with another <br/>
&gt; mom who&#39;s child did not eat food until about 2 and that knowledge  just in <br/>
&gt; and of itself helped me let go.  Once I got that, everything else was <br/>
&gt; okay....whatever, whenever....no pressure. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe because I am trained as a teacher, I have had a bit of difficulty <br/>
&gt; maintaining this kind of thought when it comes to &quot;education&quot;...althought <br/>
&gt; the word itself is startting to get on my nerves.  TEacher prepared <br/>
&gt; pre-reading questions, post-reading questions, during reading questions, <br/>
&gt; yadayadayda...interference.  Now I am thinking that I was trained to <br/>
&gt; interfer with learning....I am becoming aware of this and now just want to <br/>
&gt; keep my mouth shut for a while until I know when to speak!  Was reading to <br/>
&gt; my daughter today and she asked a question.  I actually did not answer it <br/>
&gt; just to see what wouild happen, and she did not ask again...I actually <br/>
&gt; think it was a rhetorical question (the story did answer) and she was <br/>
&gt; thinking out loud.  <br/>
