&gt;I think all of you who are bashing parents of ADD children should think long<br/>
&gt;and hard about what  it is like for these children and their families before<br/>
&gt;placing this kind of judgement on them, obviously you do not have  ADD<br/>
&gt;children, &quot;busy &quot; children and ADD children are two completely different<br/>
&gt;species!  there was a statement made about the parents of these kids being<br/>
 </span></blockquote>compared to people who<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;let their children bounce around the car,  most of the severe add children I<br/>
&gt;know wouldn&#39;t be able to be restrained without meds, some of these kids ( a<br/>
&gt;great deal of the severe cases) can&#39;t keep these kids in anything, beds ,<br/>
&gt;cribs, carseats ect...... and it comes as a great releif for the parents of<br/>
&gt;these children to be able to have things like restraints finally work!  you<br/>
&gt;people who think you know so much about other peoples children and the life<br/>
&gt;they must live have no clue how deep the love runs for  these children and<br/>
&gt;how far the parents would go to protect them and help them whatever it took!<br/>
&gt;so before you go accusing these parents of just being lazy or bad parents<br/>
&gt;maybe you should take a good  hard long look at what they go thru every day<br/>
&gt;of their lives  and be thankful for  the fact that you don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt;experience  what we do everyday , and that you don&#39;t have to spend every<br/>
&gt;waking moment  dealing with and protecting them from the  kind of ignorance<br/>
&gt;that  is out there with regards to ADD ~!!!!!!!!<br/>
&gt;Tanya Ohio  (who wished they had diagnosed my ADD  during my school years!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What parent could, in good conscious, medicate their child daily like<br/>
&gt;that?<br/>
&gt;&gt; How can we know what the long term effects of such action will be?  It<br/>
&gt;&gt;makes me sick, like folks who drive around with their kids bouncing all<br/>
&gt;&gt;over the car without seatbelts while they puff away on cigaretts with the<br/>
&gt;&gt;windows rolled up.  Or the people whose kids run around in the street (I<br/>
&gt;&gt;mean 3-4-5 year olds) without an adult in sight.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Of course, if the condition has been carefully diagnosed and medication<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;&gt;required as a small PART of a course of treatment, with the ultimte goal to<br/>
&gt;&gt;get them functioning without it, that is definately a responsible option.<br/>
&gt;&gt;I could keep my son overmedicated very easily with all of his special needs<br/>
&gt;&gt;and allergies, but I much prefer to treat him in other ways and keep the<br/>
&gt;&gt;drugs out of his little body.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Tanya;<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry that you are upset by the tone that the conversation has<br/>
taken and I apologize for any offense that my statements may have given<br/>
you.  I would like to point out that, since you are using my statements as<br/>
fuel for your ire, that I did clarify that I was not speaking about parents<br/>
whose children had been carefully diagnosed and for whom the medication was<br/>
a necessary part of their treatment.  There is, in my opinion, a problem<br/>
with misdiagnosis and overmedication of children with ADD, and I was<br/>
speaking to that problem.  I happen to know people whom I think are being<br/>
too quick to follow the advice of people not qualified to make such<br/>
diagnosis, or people who are known for overprescribing medication.  <br/>
<br/>
I know one ten year old little boy who has been on medication for the last<br/>
5 years for ADD, but they only give it to him during the school week to<br/>
ensure his maliablity in the classroom!  I think that is awful for him, and<br/>
irresponsible of his parents.  I have watched him, overnight, on numerous<br/>
weekends when he is NOT being medicated and while he is excitable and<br/>
enthusiastic, and I do sometimes have to gently hold his chin to get him to<br/>
focus on what I am saying to him, he is for the most part no problem.  He<br/>
is a delightful child, loves to play complicated computer games, is<br/>
intelligent and happy and articulate.  I do not believe that 5 day a week<br/>
medication is a necessary course of action for him.  His mother does not<br/>
work outside of the home and I see no reason why she could not spend more<br/>
time with him at home, rather than sending him to school where they have to<br/>
drug him into submission.<br/>
<br/>
Let us all remember that this is a friendly discussion, and again, I<br/>
apologize if I was generalizing or if my statements gave offense.  I value<br/>
your voice and your opinions Tanya, and I don&#39;t want you to feel attacked<br/>
or defensive here.  I am thankful that my children have not been diagnosed<br/>
with ADD, however I have already had several people tell me that my older<br/>
boy is a prime candidate for ADD.  He also has severe Asthma, allergies to<br/>
spices and preservatives, pet allergies, extreme allergies (like projectile<br/>
vomiting, hives and ER visits) to eggs and Dairy products, as well as a<br/>
fatal allergy to ALL nuts.  I cannot let him out of my sight - ever.  When<br/>
we are at playgroup I have to inspect EVERYTHING that the other children<br/>
are eating to ensure his safety.  I will wash the other kids&#39; hands (if<br/>
they were eating say, a cream cheese bagel or cheese) as his allergies are<br/>
severe enough to have a skin reaction if they touch him.  I cannot tell you<br/>
how many times my heart has leapt into my throat when I catch him eating<br/>
something when I don&#39;t know what it is, or when other children try to share<br/>
things with him and I have to shout NO! and hurry to interrupt the exchange<br/>
before I have to take him to the hospital.  All this without scaring him or<br/>
the other children or making him feel as though he is different.  Last week<br/>
at Playgroup they had Carrot Cake (with Walnuts!) and my sons and I stayed<br/>
locked in the house watching a video while the other moms and tots had<br/>
their cake on the patio.  I have been advised by a number of ER doctors,<br/>
and his Ped. to carry his Asthma medication, his Allergy medication and his<br/>
skin medication EVERYWHERE he goes, &quot;Just in Case.&quot;  He cannot eat most<br/>
things on kid&#39;s menus, he has never had Chinese food (due to a frequent use<br/>
of nuts and nut oils,) he has never been to Day Care and has had VERY FEW<br/>
babysitters.  He sleeps fitfully and often with a humidifier due to his<br/>
Asthma.  He is not allowed to &quot;Help Himself&quot; to ANY FOOD, EVER!  Even if<br/>
the other kids are all eating it, he still needs to ask Mom or Dad.  He has<br/>
never had any Birthday Cake, or most baked goods for that matter, he has<br/>
never had real ice cream or real milk, he has never had a grilled cheese<br/>
sandwich or a peanut butter sandwich, or pizza, and I have almost lost him<br/>
on several occassions already.  I dread the coming years when he will be<br/>
more independent and running around with his friends and I will not be<br/>
there.  One Peanut M & M, or one Reeses Pieces (which look like the regular<br/>
M&M&#39;s that he CAN eat) and I would lose him, no joke!<br/>
<br/>
So I do understand what it is like to deal with a child that has special<br/>
needs on a daily basis and to answer other people&#39;s intrusive questions and<br/>
dispell their misconceptions.  I truly can sympatize with how you feel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181042437"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Nancy, Thank you for clarifying  it was very late at night when I responded<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to the posts and I get sooooooo easily frustrated by people not knowing what<br/>
goes on behind closed doors, obviously you have a clue about children with<br/>
special needs, I have often wondered about allergies with my daughter, I do<br/>
know when she was 1 1/2 she had an instant change of personallity after<br/>
drinking applejuice, which makes me leary about giving it to her 13 years<br/>
later! I  am not a very organized person and have a hard time tracking and<br/>
removing certain food items from her diet, I tend to loose track or forget<br/>
what I was doing until it is to late and then have to start over again, I am<br/>
currently trying to find out if the 1 year old is allergic to apples, diaper<br/>
rash has been a major problem, so I cut out all apples, but coincedentally<br/>
put him back on formula and cut the tomatoe based baby food out all at the<br/>
same time, he has eaten pizza with no effect and yesterday and today he had<br/>
a bottle of reg milk and so far no problems, so I guess I have to give the<br/>
apples back next to see!~     do you know how many baby foods have apples in<br/>
them? wow! I cannot even immagine what you go thru with the food items, how<br/>
do you choose things to eat?? I think that my life with my daughter must be<br/>
easier than yours, she may be extreeme, but with patience and understanding<br/>
we get thru, but I don&#39;t think I would survive those severe allergies only<br/>
because I am the queen of JUNK FOOD!!!! it would probably do me good to have<br/>
to give it up, but I am pretty far gone !! well again, I am sorry to all<br/>
that I blew a gasket so quickly  and I do agree that kids should not be on<br/>
for the school days only  that comes from the doctors of whom I almost did<br/>
in for suggesting that she not be on afterschool , weekends or summer, until<br/>
they have lived with her, which I offered  for them to do for a weekend to<br/>
understand more completely ( they did not take me up on it I wonder why?)<br/>
now, if I expect absolutely nothing from my child including  behavior,<br/>
responsiblity, respect, self control of any sort,  self hygene,   not<br/>
inflicting pain on others, then I do not need her to take her meds,  but<br/>
when my child tells me that she can tell the difference and it helps her be<br/>
in control of herself, then I do know I am doing the right thing, I hope I<br/>
can get myself together to test for allergies soon, what would you suggest<br/>
as the best place to start? I do have the book is this your child, but have<br/>
it out on loan to a friend .<br/>
thank you  for your support to all who gave it, and I would have sent this<br/>
thank you earlier in the week, but I have been up every night until 2:00 and<br/>
sat until 5:00  with my best friend who was visiting from michigan, and her<br/>
4 children, putting us up to 8 and during that time we painted my dining<br/>
room, stairwell, and hallway, sponge painte the livingroom , wallpapered one<br/>
wall, and put up a border, (friday night and sat night)<br/>
so I haven&#39;t had to much time to answer any email!!! there 65 to go thru<br/>
tonight before my computer will let me receive any more~<br/>
well sorry this is soooo long, just making up for lost time oh yeah and<br/>
Joel, I am not sure how I feel about the DARE program at this time but it<br/>
must have some effect on the kids because she just about wigged out when I<br/>
drank a beer this weekend!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134332628">The real danger of the prohibitionist perspective is it tends to lead people to<br/>
all or nothing views of things.  This may work well for a very young child but<br/>
the older they get the more they see shades of gray or grey and then unless they<br/>
have learned to think critically, they may discount the exaggerated, often<br/>
deceitful propaganda to which they have been exposed.  Then they throw out the<br/>
baby with the bath water not being able to discriminate between subtle<br/>
differences resulting in the true dangers of drug use being ignored.  Kids who<br/>
are &quot;scared&quot; by propaganda can wind up having big time drug problems when they<br/>
hit adolescence in the context of public school especially.<br/>
