<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299286108">This is our first year homeschooling and we have tried just about <br/>
everything. We started with a computer school, switched to some <br/>
catholic curriculum with some lesson plans and have ended up more <br/>
like unschoolers. We live in Ohio and I have four kids ages 12,11,7 <br/>
and 5. There are three girls and one boy(11yr.old),and I am allover <br/>
the board with what we are doing. I read all the time on everything <br/>
to do with homeschooling- FIAR,Charolette Mason, Unit study, <br/>
Unschooling,etc.... Unschoolilng appeals to me most because it seems <br/>
the most fun and laid back, but also the hardest to feel like they <br/>
are &quot;learning&quot; the right stuff. We have our first portfolio <br/>
assessment May 21st and I worry if we have done enough to satisfy <br/>
the state and our assessor. <br/>
 Does anyone have any advice or reassurance that they can offer as I <br/>
am feeling a little panicky? Thank you.</div>

<br/>
First advice is nothing can prevent or cure the early panic except time and <br/>
experience, so keep on that path and it will get easier.<br/>
<br/>
The first two years Kirby didn&#39;t go to school (well he never went, but when <br/>
he was 5 and 6) I used to wake up at night sometimes with that classic kind of <br/>
weird feeling like &quot;Ah, I dreamed we just never sent Kirby to school...  OH <br/>
NO!   He&#39;s nearly eight!  IT&#39;S TRUE!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I quite got over that. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I still have some relapse moments, but they&#39;re smaller and farther between.   <br/>
 They&#39;re more like &quot;I wonder what if...&quot; now than &quot;OH NO!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055495744">I think the key is finding an assessor to satisfy your needs not trying <br/>
to satisfy an assessor.  E-mail me off list if you are anywhere near <br/>
Toledo and want a recommendation for an unschooling friendly assessor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This morning seamus woke up and said &quot;Katherine i had a terrible <br/>
nightmare!! It was horrible!&quot; so i said tell me about it...he said he <br/>
dreamed he was at his father&#39;s house (just came back from there last <br/>
week)and was woken up really early. His father told him &quot;Time for you <br/>
to go to school!&quot; and when they were walking to school kids from his <br/>
old school kept coming up to him in droves saying over and over &quot;do <br/>
you remember me?Do you remember me?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a nightmare to me! I told him if his father ever tried to <br/>
make him go to school he could call me and i would come and get him. <br/>
<br/>
I also had nightmares about my old job for the first couple months <br/>
after moving here. (Probably had something to do with me quitting <br/>
with no notice though!.)<br/>
