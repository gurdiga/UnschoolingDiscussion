<br/>
i agree with you about breast milk but unfortunately your position is fascist in<br/>
nature and leaves no room for those who could not breastfeed even if they may<br/>
have wanted to.  so yes there is no choice in many situation and when you take<br/>
the stance breastfeed or you&#39;re relegating your child to a life of poor health<br/>
is melodramatic and mean spirited because some people have no choice.  breast<br/>
milk is w/o question superior but humans are amazing and have proven time and<br/>
again to survive and even thrive on far worse things than formula or cows milk.<br/>
so i think a good use of all the energy and passion you have regarding this<br/>
topic might be better used in advocating for milk banks rather than berating<br/>
people.  i think information is best heard when it is give w/o all the harsh<br/>
judgements-jmo<br/>

and should not be taken personally, but also her comments were intended as<br/>
judgments and where highly charged leaving no room for other possibilities.<br/>
every situation is unique and making blanket statement serve no real purpose<br/>
then to cast judgments.  i wish, sonia, you would have found a better way to<br/>
pass on the info from all the research you has done.  trying to make people feel<br/>
bad or guilty for choices they have made or are in the process of making or for<br/>
having to cope w difficult realities is just not right and certainly not<br/>
supportive.<br/>
