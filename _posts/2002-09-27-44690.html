<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099996790"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hi Liza,<br/>
&gt;What is Project Gutenberg?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For all of you who do not know about PG,<br/>
<br/>
Project Gutenberg is an invaluable source, not only to homeschoolers <br/>
but to all people. I have been using it since 1994 and had access to <br/>
it through Compuserve (we did not have Mozilla, the precursor to <br/>
Netscape, at the time). In Internet years, 8 years are 2 years short <br/>
of a &quot;brick-and-mortar&quot; eon.<br/>
<br/>
The following is what I have cut and pasted from one of their <br/>
e-mails. For more information on Project Gutenberg (and to download <br/>
books), please go to &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://promo.net/pg">http://promo.net/pg</a>&gt;.<br/>

&gt;to the current production of #4000.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1 per year in 1971-1979 completed the first 9 Etexts<br/>
&gt;which were mostly a &quot;History of Western Democracy&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From 1980-1990 the first Bible and Shakespeare were completed,<br/>
&gt;but due to the new copyright extensions, the Shakespeare is<br/>
&gt;still not able to be released.  Thus the total was 10 Etexts.<br/>
&gt;[Counting all of Shakespeare and The Bible as 1 Etext each.]<br/>
&gt;[This particular edition of Shakespeare is still copyrighted,<br/>
&gt;even now, 20 years later, due to TWO copyright extensions in<br/>
&gt;the 31 year history of Project Gutenberg, which have removed<br/>
&gt;two million books from the list we could put online.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;eBooks per month per year<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  1  in 1991 We released The Bible as #10.<br/>
&gt;  2  in 1992<br/>
&gt;  4  in 1993<br/>
&gt;  8  in 1994 We released The Complete Shakespeare as #100.<br/>
&gt;16  in 1995<br/>
&gt;32  in 1996<br/>
&gt;32  in 1997 [we lost our funding for that year, and barely survived]<br/>
&gt;36  in 1998 [kept this schedule for first half and then in second half<br/>
&gt;             we completed two months during each month for 72 per month]<br/>
&gt;36  in 1999 [is our official schedule, we are now about 8 months ahead,<br/>
&gt;             but, as luck would have it, on the day the muse struck to<br/>
&gt;             write this article, I learned that our funding is again lost.]<br/>
&gt;40  in 2000 [I was never personally comfortable doing over 30 per month,<br/>
&gt;50  in 2001 so this is when I started planning all the delegating of today]<br/>
&gt;100 in 2001 [Starting on our 30th Anniversay, and we thought we would NEVER<br/>
&gt;             be able to do this many, so it would bring us back on schedule,<br/>
&gt;             but so far, only three months later, we have. . .so who knows.]<br/>
&gt;             [Note added in January, 2002, we managed to do 1240 in 2001, so<br/>
&gt;             we did somehow manage to average 100 per month--who knows how.]<br/>
&gt;200 in 2002 We started 2002 with an incredible 200 eBooks per month, and it<br/>
&gt;             is amazing, and we are still very close to that.  Right now we<br/>
&gt;             have an average of 198 per month for the first 8 1/2 months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here are some of the highlights:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;####  Date  Title<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    1  1971  The U.S. Declaration of Independence [July 4, 1971]<br/>
&gt;   10  1990  The King James Bible<br/>
&gt;  100  1994  The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [December 10, 1993]<br/>
&gt;1000  1997  Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy, In Italian[September 1, 1997]<br/>
&gt;2000  1999  Don Quixote, In Spanish [April 23, 1999]<br/>
&gt;3000  2000  A L&#39;Ombre Des Jeunes Filles en Fleurs V3 by Proust, In French<br/>
&gt;4000  2001  The Complete Works of &quot;The French Immortals&quot;, In English<br/>
&gt;5000  2002  The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, In English [April 10, 2002]<br/>
&gt;6000  2002  Our First Polish eBook &quot;Ironia Pozorow&quot; [September, 2002]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;[Now that we can officially say we have &quot;thousands&quot; of these<br/>
&gt;eBooks online, we should prepare to create an institution of<br/>
&gt;support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this<br/>
&gt;project into, and at least part of the way through, the next<br/>
&gt;millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more below]<br/>
