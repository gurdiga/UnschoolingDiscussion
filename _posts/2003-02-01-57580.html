What a wonderful story!! Someone just sent this to me:<br/>
************************************************************<br/>
What is a Grandmother?<br/>
<br/>
 What is a grandmother? ( taken from papers written by a class of 8 year<br/>
 olds), A grandmother is a lady who has no little children of her own.<br/>
<br/>
 She likes other peoples. A grandfather is a man grandmother.<br/>
Grandmothers<br/>
 don&#39;t have to do anything except be there when we come to see them.<br/>
<br/>
 They are so old they shouldn&#39;t play hard or run. It is good if they<br/>
drive us<br/>
 to the store and have lots of quarters for us.<br/>
<br/>
 When they take us for walks, they slow down past things like pretty<br/>
leaves<br/>
 and caterpillars. They show us and talk to us about the color of the<br/>
flowers<br/>
 and also don&#39;t step on &quot;cracks.&quot; They don&#39;t say, &quot;Hurry up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Usually grandmothers are fat, but not too fat to tie your shoes. They<br/>
wear<br/>
 glasses and funny underwear.<br/>
<br/>
 They can take their teeth and gums out.<br/>
<br/>
 Grandmothers don&#39;t have to be smart. They have to answer questions like<br/>
 &quot;Why isn&#39;t God married?&quot; and How come dogs chase cats?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 When they read to us, they don&#39;t skip. They don&#39;t mind if we ask for the<br/>
 same story over again.<br/>
<br/>
 Everybody should try to have a grandmother, especially if you don&#39;t have<br/>
 television, because they are the only grown ups who like to spend time<br/>
 with us.<br/>
<br/>
 They know we should have snack-time before bedtime and they say prayers<br/>
with us every time, and kiss us even when we&#39;ve acted bad. <br/>
*************************************************************<br/>
Isn&#39;t it great that we don&#39;t have to wait till we get old to act like<br/>
Grandmothers! I sure hope my children have such happy memories of their<br/>
childhood.<br/>
