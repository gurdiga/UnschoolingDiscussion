has to deal with relatives that don&#39;t understand ever again. &gt;&gt;<br/>

My children will have relatives who don&#39;t understand if they have scheduled <br/>
cesareans, have baby showers featuring tons of baby bottles and sterlizing <br/>
equipment and put their babies in daycare within a few months.   <br/>

Sometimes parents have beliefs they can&#39;t bend.  And if to a grandparent <br/>
school seems right and good and the kids blow school right by, won&#39;t it be <br/>
like me saying, &quot;Oh!  COOL!  I&#39;ll drive the baby to daycare for you and then <br/>
I&#39;ll go buy you a case of formula.  That will be fun!&quot;<br/>

unschooled were asked whether they had plans to unschool/homeschool their<br/>
own children. Most of them thought that it required too much commitment on<br/>
their part and they weren&#39;t willing to make that commitment. I think I would<br/>
have real problems with my kids if they put their kids in daycare to<br/>
continue their careers. Actually, I know I would!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
You know, I have thought about things like this and I must tell you, <br/>
I have had those same feelings.  Maybe not directly related to <br/>
schooling choices, but certainly hospital births, bottle feedings, <br/>
and so on.  My children are all young, so I have a while to keep <br/>
fretting, ;), but as with any other parenting decisions I make and <br/>
any worries I have about &#39;how they will turn out&#39;, I just remind <br/>
myself that I will make the best, most informed decisions possible <br/>
and hope that my children can look back and see how much they <br/>
benefitted from those choices and hope they will emulate those <br/>
choices when they, too, become parents.<br/>
<br/>
I know for myself, my parenting choices are directly related to <br/>
those of my parents, which were awful.  I came away wanting to be <br/>
nothing like that and have done everything in my power to be aware <br/>
of those bad situations I faced as a child.  Perhaps, and I hope <br/>
that, my children will come away feeling good about their childhood <br/>
and choose many of the same practices that led to their own <br/>
happiness.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear more on this from other list-moms who have older <br/>
teen and adult children now. <br/>

<br/>
My parents surely must have thought sending me to school and encouraging me <br/>
to stay there and go to college was the best choice they could have made.  <br/>
Both of them were high school dropouts, but I finished college.<br/>
<br/>
My dad died before I had children.  My mom&#39;s still around but doesn&#39;t argue <br/>
with me or criticize me.<br/>

<br/>
Kirby is very mature in and about relationships with friends and girlfriends. <br/>
 I really don&#39;t think that he will hook up with anyone he didn&#39;t think would <br/>
be a good mom.  He has NONE of the desperation and pressure to have a <br/>
girlfriend that he would have if he were in school.  He has had a few, and is <br/>
still friends with them after.  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday he told his current girlfriend (who goes to Manzano High, for the <br/>
locals and ex-New-Mexicans) that he didn&#39;t want to go to the prom.  She fell <br/>
into dramatic mode.  Sent a friend over to tell him she was crying and to <br/>
come talk to her.   (At a big public park full of people there for an SCA <br/>
fighter practice.)   He said no, she should come back over here and talk!  <br/>
She sent another friend.  <br/>
<br/>
She was doing something that to me was FULLY understandable and <br/>
recognizeable, from a high school girl point of view.<br/>
<br/>
To Kirby it was bizarre and irrational behavior like they won&#39;t even put into <br/>
a sit com.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s right!!  Good for him!!<br/>
<br/>
People trust him with their kids.  A stranger trusted him with a baby for an <br/>
hour.  I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s exceptionally good with kids at the karate school and <br/>
during the gaming sessions he runs, currently Yu-Gi-Oh, on Monday evenings at <br/>
the gaming shop where he works.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel too worried about who he&#39;ll marry since I trust Kirby.  <br/>
<br/>
But I would separate from them before I would give them hell.  (I hope I <br/>
would.)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather they privately did what they were going to do than that I <br/>
compromise my beliefs to help or approve of something that really wounded my <br/>
soul.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I play devil&#39;s advocate about WHY parents and inlaws would be so <br/>
harsh and freaky sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I worry about this too! Interesting...I met a woman, 23 yo who is pregnant. Her ILs<br/>
were attachment parenting folks, her MIL was a LLL leader. She says that she is<br/>
researching everything and that they have some doubts about AP (family bed etc).<br/>
Mainly because her dh remembers being very upset when he started kindergarten.<br/>
He cried and his mother stayed with him for the first couple of days and then <br/>
pulled him out and kept him home for another year. He feels that he was sheltered<br/>
and that he should have been able to handle kindergarten at age 5 like the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to talk with her about different kids having different personalities and<br/>
how it might have actually been *worse* for him if his mother had not been so <br/>
responsive to his needs. Was able to use my kids as an example (we did not start<br/>
the fb with my oldest until he was 1 year, he was in day care p/t until he was 2,<br/>
the youngest has never been to day care, slept with us from day 1 and definitely<br/>
has led a more &quot;child-led&quot; life) Jason (my oldest) is definitely more cautious, <br/>
more shy, more mommy centered. Kyle is my little independent guy. These are just<br/>
their personalities. I do not take credit/blame for creating them...this does not<br/>
mean that I do not have any influence on them, but I do believe that their fundamental<br/>
personality types were there when they were born. <br/>
<br/>
I basically told her that there were tons of different ways to parent and that she <br/>
basically had to follow her heart and do what felt right to her for her child. That<br/>
there was no &quot;right&quot; way to parent and that her child would help  her learn more<br/>
then any &quot;expert&quot;. She has already found a LLL group that she really likes and her<br/>
MIL has given her great reading material. I just felt a little sad that it was her<br/>
dh that was causing her to question it when he was the one raised that way. I did <br/>
not get the impression that he was opposed to it, just that he had some concerns.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that as the mom to 2 boys (and no more kids expected...dh was snipped last<br/>
week) I am hoping for wonderful DILs. And hoping that my boys don&#39;t regret how they<br/>
were raised. It doesn&#39;t seem like they will and I hope to keep talking about *why* I<br/>
parent the way I do. Maybe that will make the difference...I know that when I was a <br/>
kid, parenting was something that my parents just did...it was not something that <br/>
was really discussed with us....<br/>
