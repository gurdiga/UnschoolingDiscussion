  Alameda County CA for seizing<br>&gt;her<br>&gt;children because a relative of 
  the children&#39;s father (their father is<br>&gt;a<br>&gt;sometimes violent 
  homeless man who has no chance of gaining custody<br>&gt;of his<br>&gt;sons) 
  reported that the 9 year old twin boys were &quot;socially 
  isolated&quot;<br>&gt;and<br>&gt;&quot;unable to relate to anyone but their mother.&quot; the 
  children have been<br>&gt;in<br>&gt;three placements in the past several 
  weeks. I know these children<br>&gt;from the<br>&gt;Berkeley YMCA, where they 
  swim, play basketball, join group arts and<br>&gt;crafts<br>&gt;projects, and 
  generally are a part of the community. Please read and<br>&gt;circulate this 
  letter - it is a lesson in the absurd, and it could<br>&gt;happen 
  to<br>&gt;anyone. Patty is a down to earth older mother who gave birth to 
  twins<br>&gt;at age<br>&gt;45 after long term infertility, and she has been 
  following the<br>&gt;Independent<br>&gt;Studies curriculum supervised by the 
  Berkeley Unified School District.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Needless to say this has not 
  increased my respect for the child rescue<br>&gt;establishment. Homeschooling 
  is not the only item that could generate<br>&gt;such a<br>&gt;bizarre set of 
  events - any over-zealous neighbor or social worker who<br>&gt;doesn&#39;t like 
  your religion or lack thereof, your family bed, 
  your<br>&gt;letting<br>&gt;children play naked in the backyard, your messy 
  house, diet, longterm<br>&gt;breastfeeding, style of dress or choice of family 
  acctivities could<br>&gt;get<br>&gt;something like this nightmare going. 
  Official documents blame<br>&gt;Ptaricia for<br>&gt;using &quot;manipulative charm&quot; 
  with the children because she told<br>&gt;them, &quot;Smile<br>&gt;and tell the 
  truth if anyone asks you questions.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Please note that a legal 
  defense fund has been established on Patty&#39;s<br>&gt;behalf<br>&gt;- if you or 
  anyone or any group you trust could contribute even a<br>&gt;little, 
  it<br>&gt;would be wonderful. Thanks, friends,

  Friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  5/11/00<br>&gt;&nbsp; ( This is typed into the computer and sent for Patricia 
  by Anne<br>&gt;Marie.<br>&gt;Patricia is in bed with a migraine headache but 
  wanted&nbsp; to update<br>&gt;those<br>&gt;concerned. 
  )<br>&gt;<br>&gt;======================<br>&gt;Patricia has 
  said:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Dear Friends of Nils and Hans,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Thank you 
  for the love and support your email and calls offer. The<br>&gt;support 
  I<br>&gt;get&nbsp; gives me great strength and courage to continue. I 
  welcome<br>&gt;correspondence<br>&gt;from anyone who has advice to 
  offer,&nbsp; or comments about this<br>&gt;situation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I began 
  today with &quot;The Lord is my shepherd, ......&quot;&nbsp; This morning<br>&gt;one 
  of<br>&gt;the<br>&gt;neighbor kids came by to say &quot;Are you going to see the 
  boys today?<br>&gt;Would you<br>&gt;say &#39;Hi&#39; for me?&quot; I assured him I would 
  and recited the the prayer<br>&gt;for him.<br>&gt;He<br>&gt;said he had never 
  heard it! I think back to those many times I<br>&gt;repeated it<br>&gt;over 
  and over as a child his age going to Sunday school.&nbsp; I knew 
  I<br>&gt;would get<br>&gt;a<br>&gt;red&nbsp; bible bookmark with my name and 
  the Lord&#39;s Prayer on it in gold<br>&gt;letters<br>&gt;as soon as I could say 
  the whole thing. I was the same age as my 
  boys<br>&gt;are<br>&gt;now<br>&gt;when I memorized it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;MInutes 
  later my 82 year old Buddhist landlady&nbsp; asked me to come 
  in<br>&gt;and<br>&gt;chant<br>&gt;with her for a few minutes at her alter. She 
  loves my children just<br>&gt;like her<br>&gt;own&nbsp; great grandchildren 
  that Hans and Nils played with daily. She is<br>&gt;broken<br>&gt;hearted by 
  this tragedy. She misses the hugs the boys gave her 
  every<br>&gt;day.<br>&gt;Both<br>&gt;Hans and Nils call her Grannie Annie. She 
  is impatient to get into<br>&gt;court and<br>&gt;give those people her opinion 
  about all of this.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;After a few kind words from Grannie Annie 
  I&nbsp; left to see my children<br>&gt;for<br>&gt;visit<br>&gt;#3. It was 
  wonderful to hug them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;*****They tell me my sons will be moved 
  to another foster home and<br>&gt;enrolled<br>&gt;in<br>&gt;public school next 
  Monday.*****<br>&gt;<br>&gt;They have no glasses. They have not had needed 
  fillings and teeth<br>&gt;cleaning.<br>&gt;They said they miss me in the 
  morning when they wake up and need a<br>&gt;hug from<br>&gt;me. &#39;They told me 
  they love me and want to come home. We read a book<br>&gt;about<br>&gt;rocks 
  and minerals and learned about the hardness scale: Diamonds 
  10,<br>&gt;Quartz<br>&gt;7, Talc 1. They decided to start a rock collection. 
  We joked and<br>&gt;laughed. We<br>&gt;all three managed somehow not to 
  cry.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;All ages, sizes, and shapes of people who worship in many 
  ways are<br>&gt;sending<br>&gt;their love to my children at this time. And it 
  will take a lot of<br>&gt;love to<br>&gt;overcome this terrible thing. I send 
  my deepest gratitude to everyone<br>&gt;who<br>&gt;has<br>&gt;written, prayed, 
  chanted, called, emailed etc to share their love<br>&gt;with 
  our<br>&gt;family.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I will try to send out updates after our 
  weekly visits. Please send<br>&gt;us your<br>&gt;love at 10 am Thursdays when 
  we will hug-hug-hug and be a family<br>&gt;united<br>&gt;again<br>&gt;for a 
  few all too short moments.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;In Hope,<br>&gt;Patricia

  information for those have have asked:<br>&gt;The family&#39;s attorney has a 
  trust account to hold funds for 
  the<br>&gt;family&#39;s<br>&gt;legal<br>&gt;defense.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Any donations 
  to help huge huge legal costs to<br>&gt;&nbsp; bring the boys home may be made

  USA<br>&gt;<br>&gt;He may be reached at (510) 845-0504&nbsp;&nbsp; where he 
  will be very busy<br>&gt;trying to<br>&gt;prepare this complicated case and do 
  all of the necessary legal<br>&gt;procedures<br>&gt;to<br>&gt;get Nils and

  a<br>&gt;number<br>&gt;where she can call you back collect or even better an 
  email address<br>&gt;she can<br>&gt;write to you at. Her phone bill is huge 
  now due to this case and she<br>&gt;says<br>&gt;she<br>&gt;can not afford to 
  call you&nbsp; unless you would accept a collect call 
  if<br>&gt;you<br>&gt;are<br>&gt;out of her area code. Patricia welcomes all 
  communication. She<br>&gt;realizes her<br>&gt;case is not isolated, and can 
  set a precedent for other families.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A little legal defense fund 
  Benefit is hoping to happen here 
  in<br>&gt;Berkeley.<br>&gt;Two<br>&gt;excellent Berkeley bands have already 
  volunteered to play at it.<br>&gt;Children&#39;s<br>&gt;entertainers are 
  invited&nbsp; to volunteer. We need a small, free place<br>&gt;to 
  hold<br>&gt;it<br>&gt;where a band could set up and play on a Sunday 
  afternoon, printing,<br>&gt;advertising etc. If any one is interested in 
  helping or has<br>&gt;suggestions<br>&gt;please<br>&gt;contact

  [from Patricia Moodian-Pink 5/11/2000]<br>&gt;---------<br>&gt;For those who 
  may have missed it -<br>&gt;&nbsp; from the original paperwork to remove and 
  hold the children:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp; Quotes from Screener Narrative before 
  children removed on 4/20/2000:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&quot;The children are 
  homeschooled and never allowed out of her sight.&quot;<br>&gt;&nbsp; &quot;Mom has 
  totally isolated the minors and allows them no contact 
  with<br>&gt;anyone<br>&gt;but her.&quot; &quot;...at risk environment of the 
  minors.&quot;<br>&gt;&nbsp; (These are totally false allegations about two socially 
  active<br>&gt;children<br>&gt;that<br>&gt;are well integrated into their 
  community.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &#39;Screener Narrative&#39; 
  recommendations:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; 
  3. The children<br>&gt; &gt; enter public school next year, or as soon as 
  their mental health and<br>&gt; &gt; development allows.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Their 
  own records and documents prove what they did to remove 
  the<br>&gt;children<br>&gt;These documents exist,&nbsp; no matter how they try 
  to squirm around after<br>&gt;the<br>&gt;fact. No matter what else they do in 
  new petitions after the wrongful<br>&gt;detention, those words are, in fact, 
  quotes from documents used to<br>&gt;remove<br>&gt;the 
  children.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;In an effort to keep from antagonizing the court 
  Patricia is asking<br>&gt;that<br>&gt;neither the worker nor the court be 
  contacted at this point. That<br>&gt;could<br>&gt;change<br>&gt;in the future 
  depending on many things. For now she is concerned 
  that<br>&gt;they<br>&gt;not<br>&gt;only have her children but could take away 
  the one hour closely<br>&gt;supervised<br>&gt;visit per week that she is 
  allowed with them.&nbsp; She also does not want<br>&gt;to<br>&gt;have<br>&gt;a 
  gag order placed on her so that she is not even allowed to 
  update<br>&gt;others<br>&gt;on<br>&gt;what is happening. In their petitions 
  they tried to get the court to<br>&gt;order<br>&gt;her<br>&gt;not to talk to 
  anyone &quot;in the best interest of the minors.&quot; Patricia<br>&gt;is 
  very<br>&gt;grateful to all who have shown concern for the 
  children.<br>&gt;--- End forwarded message ---<br>&gt;<br><br></tt>

Oh my I see that you have not had any visits from CPS!<br/>
I have<br/>
For nothing<br/>
In fact I got a copy of the report and it said in there that I:<br/>
<br/>
Breast feed exclusively (a 5 month old) (it did also state that he was <br/>
nourished)<br/>
Home school<br/>
That my kids were dirty (which they were not)<br/>
Do not immunize (I realize this is controversial)<br/>
That I refused to give my child the medicine prescribed (I did refuse <br/>
Ibuprophen...I asked for Tylenol instead and I TOLD the doctor that yes I <br/>
came there (to the hospital) for treatment so yes I was going to fill the <br/>
prescription)<br/>
OH and the best was that I had a home birth<br/>
Oh yes and the doctor went on further to say that I have been reported to <br/>
CPS several times and I was a repeat offender.....<br/>
In fact when I was called the next day (after they came and were satisfied) <br/>
the worker asked me why he could not find me in his files...He was really <br/>
troubled and I explained HELLO I am not in there (as if all people who are <br/>
reported are child abusers)<br/>
<br/>
*They were going to take my baby right then* (at the hospital...I had all <br/>
sorts of people in my room)<br/>
<br/>
The doctor was pissed because I would not bow down to her!<br/>
<br/>
They (CPS) actually came to my house that night and I showed them the <br/>
medication that I FILLED and they were still not appeased<br/>
<br/>
This whole circus lasted for months (which I lived in terror).<br/>
They sent me letters dated weeks earlier which stated they were going to <br/>
take my babe if I did not take him to my family doctor (which I later <br/>
learned was best friends with CPS) in ten days (the time would be expired <br/>
by the time I got the letters)...I had taken him to the doctors (which was <br/>
fun in itself as whenever I went *CPS had called them* I had every doctor <br/>
in  my room examining every inch of my babe and the receptionists curious <br/>
stares) (who gave me another prescription which lasts (good guess 10 days)) <br/>
BUT the prescription made the babe puke and get a red blistery butt (which <br/>
started bleeding and was sore for months)......*the doctor told me NO he is <br/>
not allergic to the antibiotic*........I found some wonderful homeopathic <br/>
remedy that cleared it up in days........(But I do recall I made an <br/>
appointment to appease CPS and when I called to cancel it they were rather <br/>
upset and kept calling me to reschedule or just to come in when I <br/>
could.......(I wonder if CPS was laying in wait)<br/>
<br/>
So I did not take him back.......more letters....My attorney all this time <br/>
had been calling them, stating that I did not have to treat my babe with <br/>
allopathic remedies ......to no avail........<br/>
<br/>
It ended after I sent them a letter politely asking them to F%$K off<br/>
<br/>
Do I sound paranoid?<br/>
You bet!<br/>
Can you imagine receiving letters that someone is going to take your baby <br/>
because you do not want him to receive any more antibiotics that cause &quot;red <br/>
blistery butt&quot; and puking....who no longer has an ear infection?<br/>
<br/>
ALL this for an ear infection and because I had my baby in the loving <br/>
environment of my family, teach my children life in the safety and warmth <br/>
of our home, with a bare milk filled breast thrown in!<br/>
<br/>

Love POD<br/>
<br/>
PS by emotively rate do you mean losing your kids without emotion *wah* (is <br/>
this possible)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168017055">Wow, Susan-- You have been going through a nightmare, for sure!!!  If you <br/>
don&#39;t mind sharing, where do you live?  I have never heard of such terrible <br/>
treatment!!  (Of course, I have READ about things like this in books, but <br/>
have not heard of anyone&#39;s personal tragedy.)  I am so very sorry that you <br/>
have been put through such disrespect, and cruelty.  I will definitely <br/>
forward the message on and check into the web site you recommended on an <br/>
earlier post.  Hope things are going better for you.        ~Karen from Ind</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I see, though not intending to, that I did in fact 
give offense.&nbsp; For that I am sorry.&nbsp; And from what you have given me 
below I am beginning to get more of the picture.&nbsp; I will also go to 
CPSWatch and get fully informed.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">However, I&#39;ve also had a lot of experience in 
fighting mindless bureaucracy - so please hear me when I say that you or someone 
needs to dispassionately lay out, in chronological order, the verifiable facts 
of this case.&nbsp; If you do that, many more &quot;sober citizens&quot; will feel 
comfortable about backing you up, than you will get from emotional 
appeals.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Please don&#39;t misunderstand - I&#39;m not being 
patronizing and saying &quot;calm down&quot; or anything like that.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure I would 
be&nbsp;even more freaked out than you - but to drum up support a dispassionate 
report is invaluable.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44550141">OH things are much quieter now!<br/>
My story happened about a year ago......but I still live in fear of them <br/>
(though I try not to)<br/>
All I ask of anyone/everyone is that you become educated and educate others <br/>
and try to be supportive......<br/>
CPS is doing many unkind things to many people for reasons as simple or <br/>
less as mine!<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Wow, Susan-- You have been going through a nightmare, for sure!!!  If you<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t mind sharing, where do you live?  I have never heard of such terrible<br/>
&gt;treatment!!  (Of course, I have READ about things like this in books, but<br/>
&gt;have not heard of anyone&#39;s personal tragedy.)  I am so very sorry that you<br/>
&gt;have been put through such disrespect, and cruelty.  I will definitely<br/>
&gt;forward the message on and check into the web site you recommended on an<br/>
&gt;earlier post.  Hope things are going better for you.        ~Karen from Ind </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31789253">Well I am not sure what I can do for you on the &quot;facts&quot;<br/>
Some of them are laid out in the post........but I am not sure what more I <br/>
can get as CPS is not one to distribute their info!?<br/>
I will respond and see what happens!<br/>
thanks (I was not offended I just want people to know the <br/>
&quot;facts&quot;..............CPS is abuse) *not to say that it is not life saving <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I see, though not intending to, that I did in fact give offense.  For that <br/>
&gt;I am sorry.  And from what you have given me below I am beginning to get <br/>
&gt;more of the picture.  I will also go to CPSWatch and get fully informed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, I&#39;ve also had a lot of experience in fighting mindless <br/>
&gt;bureaucracy - so please hear me when I say that you or someone needs to <br/>
&gt;dispassionately lay out, in chronological order, the verifiable facts of <br/>
&gt;this case.  If you do that, many more &quot;sober citizens&quot; will feel <br/>
&gt;comfortable about backing you up, than you will get from emotional appeals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please don&#39;t misunderstand - I&#39;m not being patronizing and saying &quot;calm <br/>
&gt;down&quot; or anything like that.  I&#39;m sure I would be even more freaked out <br/>
&gt;than you - but to drum up support a dispassionate report is invaluable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If now is not the time to try to give you this advice - well, I apologize <br/>
&gt;again for bad timing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely, Gus<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Oh my I see that you have not had any visits from CPS!<br/>
&gt;&gt;I have<br/>
&gt;&gt;For nothing<br/>
&gt;&gt;In fact I got a copy of the report and it said in there that I:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Breast feed exclusively (a 5 month old) (it did also state that he was<br/>
&gt;&gt;nourished)<br/>
&gt;&gt;Home school<br/>
&gt;&gt;That my kids were dirty (which they were not)<br/>
&gt;&gt;Do not immunize (I realize this is controversial)<br/>
&gt;&gt;That I refused to give my child the medicine prescribed (I did refuse<br/>
&gt;&gt;Ibuprophen...I asked for Tylenol instead and I TOLD the doctor that yes I<br/>
&gt;&gt;came there (to the hospital) for treatment so yes I was going to fill the<br/>
&gt;&gt;prescription)<br/>
&gt;&gt;OH and the best was that I had a home birth<br/>
&gt;&gt;Oh yes and the doctor went on further to say that I have been reported to<br/>
&gt;&gt;CPS several times and I was a repeat offender.....<br/>
&gt;&gt;In fact when I was called the next day (after they came and were satisfied)<br/>
&gt;&gt;the worker asked me why he could not find me in his files...He was really<br/>
&gt;&gt;troubled and I explained HELLO I am not in there (as if all people who are<br/>
&gt;&gt;reported are child abusers)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;*They were going to take my baby right then* (at the hospital...I had all<br/>
&gt;&gt;sorts of people in my room)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The doctor was pissed because I would not bow down to her!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;They (CPS) actually came to my house that night and I showed them the<br/>
&gt;&gt;medication that I FILLED and they were still not appeased<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;This whole circus lasted for months (which I lived in terror).<br/>
&gt;&gt;They sent me letters dated weeks earlier which stated they were going to<br/>
&gt;&gt;take my babe if I did not take him to my family doctor (which I later<br/>
&gt;&gt;learned was best friends with CPS) in ten days (the time would be expired<br/>
&gt;&gt;by the time I got the letters)...I had taken him to the doctors (which was<br/>
&gt;&gt;fun in itself as whenever I went *CPS had called them* I had every doctor<br/>
&gt;&gt;in  my room examining every inch of my babe and the receptionists curious<br/>
&gt;&gt;stares) (who gave me another prescription which lasts (good guess 10 days))<br/>
&gt;&gt;BUT the prescription made the babe puke and get a red blistery butt (which<br/>
&gt;&gt;started bleeding and was sore for months)......*the doctor told me NO he is<br/>
&gt;&gt;not allergic to the antibiotic*........I found some wonderful homeopathic<br/>
&gt;&gt;remedy that cleared it up in days........(But I do recall I made an<br/>
&gt;&gt;appointment to appease CPS and when I called to cancel it they were rather<br/>
&gt;&gt;upset and kept calling me to reschedule or just to come in when I<br/>
&gt;&gt;could.......(I wonder if CPS was laying in wait)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;So I did not take him back.......more letters....My attorney all this time<br/>
&gt;&gt;had been calling them, stating that I did not have to treat my babe with<br/>
&gt;&gt;allopathic remedies ......to no avail........<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;It ended after I sent them a letter politely asking them to F%$K off<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Do I sound paranoid?<br/>
&gt;&gt;You bet!<br/>
&gt;&gt;Can you imagine receiving letters that someone is going to take your baby<br/>
&gt;&gt;because you do not want him to receive any more antibiotics that cause &quot;red<br/>
&gt;&gt;blistery butt&quot; and puking....who no longer has an ear infection?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;ALL this for an ear infection and because I had my baby in the loving<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762065178">I haven&#39;t posted on here in a long time but I do try to read many of the <br/>
posts from others.  It is so maddening and ironic that in a society that <br/>
gives lip service to tolerance and diversity, there is still the mentality <br/>
that there is ONE way to do things and that is whatever the majority are <br/>
doing at any given time.  U.S. history is filled with examples of the <br/>
majority going in the wrong direction in various issues, but the tendency is <br/>
to always think that is in the past and NOW we have it right.<br/>
     It is frightening that the state is willing to act so quickly on the <br/>
statements of one person without having to verify that that statement is <br/>
true.  I know there are times that CPS is justified in removing children.  <br/>
But it seems that many times personal egos get involved and they don&#39;t want <br/>
to back down from the position they&#39;ve taken.  <br/>
     Susan, I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t go even further for you and I can definitely <br/>
understand why it scared you so much.  With the fear, I know there must be <br/>
such an anger, the feeling of how dare they intrude into your life and <br/>
threaten to take your child?  I hope you never have to go through anything <br/>
like that again.<br/>

I second that request. It does seem to me, uninformed as I am, that the CPS<br/>
are being unbelievably cruel and high-handed if it is &quot;only&quot; a HS issue...??<br/>
