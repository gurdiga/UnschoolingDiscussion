<div id="ygrps-yiv-448335014">at the salvation army that we go to here in town, they have a free box<br/>
which holds toys like you&#39;re talking about and other mismatched or broken<br/>
or odd things.  my kids pick through em while i&#39;m searching around and<br/>
usually decide that they&#39;re not much fun or whatever and leave them there<br/>
knowing they could take em if they wanted.  they have picked some before<br/>
though, and, no...it wasn&#39;t a big deal.  i don&#39;t personally like them,<br/>
but if they enjoy them, then i don&#39;t see what the big deal is. :)  i do<br/>
know plenty of people who wouldn&#39;t allow it or, at the very least, would<br/>
work very hard to dissuade their kids from bringing them home.  i figure,<br/>
if they&#39;re free and they get tired of them, i could put them out in a<br/>
free box at a future garage sale or donate them back to goodwill, which<br/>
is, for the record, what has happened with them each time!<br/>

** i agree completely here and i think this is the sticking point.  i<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
guilt my children about their choices.  i&#39;m proud of my kids and i love<br/>
them.  if they really want something and it happens to be plastic, i&#39;m<br/>
not saying that i won&#39;t get it.  i&#39;m just saying that that isn&#39;t<br/>
typically the case.  we have an extremely limited budget and the kids<br/>
honestly rarely get gifts. **<br/>
<br/>
What about going to thrift stores and scooping up some of the piles of <br/>
pre-owned small plastic Disneyesque &quot;Happy Meal&quot; toys?  The toys have <br/>
already been made and purchased, so you aren&#39;t personally increasing the <br/>
amount of trash in the (future) landfill by buying them.  And they are <br/>
quite cheap.  Would you refrain from doing this?<br/>
