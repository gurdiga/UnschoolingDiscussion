<br/>
Hi Everyone (from Marianne Moyer),<br/>
<br/>
Some of you on the message boards know me and some don&#39;t. I am <br/>
homeschooling my two children Katrina and Sabrina, age 4 and 10. My <br/>
husband left me about a year and a half ago. He didn&#39;t give me any <br/>
support since last December 2001. Basically he left us with nothing <br/>
and gave us nothing, and I&#39;ve been in and out of court. I couldn&#39;t <br/>
work because I&#39;ve been extremely and chronically ill. I finally had <br/>
to go on public assistance and could barely pay any of my bills. My <br/>
family has helped me some but they no longer can help.<br/>
Consequently, I&#39;m now in the situation that I&#39;m in, and I have some <br/>
sad news. My landlord gave me an eviction letter on Oct. 24th, 2002. <br/>
He&#39;s giving me 30 days to vacate and at that time they&#39;re moving our <br/>
house off the lot in our mobile home park. I have gotten into arrears <br/>
in the amount of $2500 not having the money to pay for the rent on <br/>
the land for the last 6 months. <br/>
I&#39;ve been a homemaker for years and don&#39;t really have any marketable <br/>
skills even if I could work. The children and I are left with pain <br/>
and fear, and I have many chronic health problems including visual <br/>
problems, chronic fatigue syndrome, breathing difficulties, etc. <br/>
I&#39;m under the care of different doctors and have not been able to be <br/>
definitively diagnosed for over 10 years. The mystery of the unknown <br/>
is scary and I just want to be alive for my children to see them <br/>
grow. <br/>
Right now I&#39;m appealing to anyone who can help us from being on the <br/>
street and saving our home. I will be in the hospital in a few weeks, <br/>
and cannot rest until I know that the children and I have our home to <br/>
stay in and won&#39;t be put out on the cold streets. My older daughter <br/>
and her 1 year old baby also live with us. What sadness and ills have <br/>
befallen us today.<br/>
A loan, a gift, whatever you can spare would be gratefully <br/>
appreciated. My prayers go out to you for this support, as the <br/>
holidays are close and winter is falling upon us, an angel looks over <br/>
all the good in this time of need...and so you shall be blessed many <br/>
times over for your support in saving us from being homeless and the <br/>
loss of so much, as all our prayers are answered... I plead for my <br/>
children for they are my breath of my life... To see smiles wash away <br/>
the tears... I thank you for such kindness...<br/>
If you could just help us this one time, I think I can manage in the <br/>
future. I was just awarded some child support but not enough and not <br/>
in time, I&#39;m appealing disability and hoping to collect in the <br/>
future, I&#39;ll be going for spousal support in February and I may have <br/>
an insurance settlement in a few months. My older daughter is working <br/>
on employment as well. <br/>
Marianne <br/>

	PS This is from Marianne&#39;s friend Barbara Auerbach. My idea <br/>
is that 50 people donating $50, 100 people donating $25, $250 people <br/>
donating $10 would do it for Marianne. I&#39;ll put in the first $50. I&#39;m <br/>
hoping that everyone who sees this will help put in the rest. This <br/>
act of kindness will come back to you.</div>
