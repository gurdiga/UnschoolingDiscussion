<div id="ygrps-yiv-329241944">Someone wrote to me on the side and asked <br/>
-=-How much &quot;freedom&quot; do you really want?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I want the freedom to be with my children as they grow up with out school or <br/>
schooling.  Thanks for several factors, I have that freedom, and I guard it.<br/>
<br/>
I want the freedom to learn more in the way I want to learn it.  Not everyone <br/>
can provide that to me, but I have been thankful to find it over the years <br/>
from La Leche League leaders, other moms, friends who&#39;ve had children before or <br/>
along with me, and generous strangers (some of whom because friends) who <br/>
helped me by writing articles in GWS and HEM and online, helping me clarify and <br/>
purify what I was doing and thinking with Kirby, when he was little, when we <br/>
thought Kirby would need to be homeschooled, but Marty would probably like school <br/>
and want to go.<br/>
<br/>
I want the freedom to share what I have learned with other unschoolers.  <br/>
Thanks to e-mail and the internet, I have that freedom.  <br/>
<br/>
I want the freedom to ask  people to keep their voices down in my house when <br/>
my kids are sleeping late because they stayed up reading and playing and <br/>
writing to their friends.  Due to my own insistence, I have that freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I really like that I have the freedom not to invite people into my home if I <br/>
don&#39;t want them there.  I like that when someone is in my home and starts <br/>
being difficult or offensive I can ask him to leave.<br/>
<br/>
I like the freedom yahoogroups offers for just anybody to start an e-mail <br/>
list there.  I have a few, and am on several more.  I&#39;ve been on some that were <br/>
temporary, and some that died out, and some that have lasted years and years.<br/>
<br/>
I like the freedom of assembly which I&#39;ve exercised many stated and <br/>
advertised in advance.  I like it when people are peaceable and cooperative in those <br/>
meetings.   I would NOT like it if someone followed me out after I left such a <br/>
meeting and accosted me in an alley.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what it feels like when someone writes me a hateful kind of attack on <br/>
the side because I&#39;ve expressed my honest feelings on a list which has a <br/>
stated and advertised purpose. On a list on which over half a dozen people <br/>
cooperatively designed a set of guidelines, I was singled out privately and insulted.  <br/>
<br/>
I want the freedom to live my private e-mail life in peace.  Is that asking <br/>
for too much freedom?<br/>
<br/>
Here, without a paragraph that might identify the person, is my response to <br/>
my attacker.  The quotes are the whole post, barring that identifying bit, and <br/>
the other paragraphs are my responses of earlier today:<br/>
<br/>
=========<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I know that you are some sort of unschooling icon, published books, <br/>
founded a website, etc. but I have to wonder by your postings if you have let your <br/>
own &quot;expertness&quot; take over.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t published a book.  Anyone can have a website.<br/>
I&#39;ve never tried to make anyone listen to me.  Some do and some don&#39;t.  <br/>
I&#39;ve listened to others, too.  I learned about unschooling from a couple of <br/>
La Leche League leaders whose kids were not in school.  I learned a lot from <br/>
people online, then, when Kirby was five and six.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes, I just rejoined the group a few days ago,  but I had been a member <br/>
with a different email address some time ago.  I just wondered why you feel the <br/>
need to control what other adults say when your philosophy with your own and <br/>
others children seems to be one of unlimited ideas and freedom of expression?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like these kinds of discussions off the list.   I would much prefer <br/>
to have them ON the list, because my purpose with my volunteer time is to help <br/>
lots of other people understand that they don&#39;t have to teach their children <br/>
for them to learn, and they don&#39;t have to control their children for them to <br/>
&quot;be good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s possible to be just as narrowminded in the name of unschooling as in <br/>
anything else.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Focussed.  I am focussed on unschooling.  If yo&#39;ure not, why is what I do any <br/>
concern of yours?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Apparently, you feel that &quot;warnings are put there to justify limiting and <br/>
controlling children&quot;, and that&#39;s wrong, but for adults to express their own <br/>
opinions they should &quot;read a while longer, maybe read in the archives, maybe <br/>
read at www.unschooling.com  (the message boards there).  With such a large list, <br/>
moderators sometimes don&#39;t catch all the too-new posters&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Apparently?&quot; I&#39;m involved with several other people in keeping a VERY large <br/>
list functioning and useful.   <br/>
<br/>
If you go to yahoogroups.com there are clear directions for creating a <br/>
yahoogroup.  If you want to create your own and run it the way you&#39;re sure we should <br/>
be running this one, it would be no problem for you to list it and invite <br/>
people to join, not ony on this list but at www.unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we&#39;re not &quot;doing it right.&quot;  We&#39;re not keeping you from doing it <br/>
better.  But we (Joyce, Pam Sorooshian and our half dozen moderators, all <br/>
volunteers) are doing what we think is the best use of our volunteer time.<br/>
<br/>
If not everyone is happy, some are.   If what we&#39;re saying or the way we&#39;re <br/>
saying it isn&#39;t helping you or your family, that might be more about you and <br/>
your family than about what we&#39;re saying.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;[deleted identifying info] I found www.unschooling.com right away, and have <br/>
been on the path to unschooling most of that time [several years]. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been unschooling for twelve and a half years without getting off the <br/>
path.  Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m entirely confident, and you call it &quot;smug.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll discuss some of the other questions on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
-------------end of quoted e-mail--------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a big world.  There are lots of e-mail lists and websites.  Take what <br/>
you need and leave the rest.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been on and off this list in the past.  I left for a few months<br/>
several years ago because a few posters were so consistently and<br/>
abundantly offering terrible unschooling advice I couldn&#39;t take it.  <br/>
Many experienced unschoolers who were offering good advice left at that<br/>
time too, and it couldn&#39;t have been good for new people looking for<br/>
inspiring, life changing information.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a lot of people join thinking this was a support list, thinking<br/>
they could get sympathy here because they have lazy, mean brats and<br/>
what&#39;s a mother to do?  I&#39;ve see the disruption to the list that follows<br/>
and I&#39;ve seen new people join during those terrible disruptions and leave<br/>
again without ever knowing that in the good moments this list offers the<br/>
very best unschooling advice available.   <br/>
<br/>
What we have today is better.  People are asked to wait a couple of weeks<br/>
before posting so that they can see if the list is going to meet *their*<br/>
needs.  Someone who wants to spank and shame their kids and who doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to change won&#39;t have their needs met on this list and it&#39;s better<br/>
for the 1300 plus other members if that someone can find it out by<br/>
reading quietly.   We expect people are smart to understand the purpose<br/>
of this list from the introduction but if not, the safety net is the<br/>
suggestion to wait two weeks.  If a new member is still not mindful<br/>
enough to understand the purpose of the list, how much time away from our<br/>
kids should we spend trying to unravel the wreckage of a derailed list? <br/>
<br/>
How much freedom do I want?  I want the freedom tell neurotic, insecure,<br/>
mean moms, who only want to defend their thoughtless parenting and offer<br/>
terrible unschooling advice to go start their own list. <br/>

Woops.  <br/>

Should have been smart *enough*.   <br/>
It&#39;d be nice if people were smart enough to get the thought out clearly<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I may I&#39;d like to make a comment here as I am fairly new to this list, I <br/>
am not new to yahoo lists or hs lists though and as many people even on this <br/>
list who know me know I post pretty regular on other lists. I guess my comment <br/>
kind of encompasses this list and the always learning list since I have been <br/>
reading both for the last few weeks. <br/>
<br/>
First I would like to say that I personally think that Sandra shows great <br/>
restraint and compassion in her posts, this is not a yippee, jump on the Sandra <br/>
guru wagon endorsement, I am not that kind of person. I think the posts I have <br/>
read so far have been very considerate of peoples feelings. Sometimes though <br/>
people might think that anyone who disagrees with them is being mean, that is <br/>
not the case.<br/>
<br/>
I think taking the time to read over time is a good idea especially with <br/>
threads that might shake the foundations of our beliefs. That is not to say we <br/>
have to change what we believe, we don&#39;t, we don&#39;t even have to respond to the <br/>
posts, in fact no one has to know we even read them, LOL. But, one might find in <br/>
reading and thinking that even their own beliefs become clearer for them. <br/>
<br/>
It is one thing to believe in something, anything be it a religion or a way <br/>
of learning or a way of eating but to truly own it I think it helps to know why <br/>
we believe it. Over the years it has been the challenging discussions that I <br/>
have been in here on the yahoo lists that have helped me to see more clearly <br/>
just exactly who I am. I won&#39;t even pretend it was easy, in fact it often took <br/>
a lot of guts to stay in the discussion. I think those of us who were/are <br/>
willing to keep the talking going help a great many others to clarify what they <br/>
believe also. Not everyone has the constitution to handle conflict, it can be <br/>
scary. Lots of people read and never post but they stay so something is <br/>
happening.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes I just sit and read and then I think and read some more. The <br/>
nice thing is I can grow as a person and enjoy it, I can post it here or not, <br/>
it&#39;s my choice.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, did I go change paths mid post?<br/>
LOL<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;freedom&quot; for other people to come where I&#39;m already doing <br/>
something and do something else against my protests.  If I go into someone <br/>
else&#39;s home or to their party or onto their list and disregard what they want <br/>
done or what their limitations or plans or guidelines are, I&#39;m not exercising my <br/>
freedom.  I&#39;m invading theirs.<br/>

<br/>
I want to clarify what I think Deb meant, for the benefit of newer members.  <br/>
If I screw this up, Deb will need to clarify what she thinks I meant. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people come for &quot;support&quot; in their assumption that they&#39;re doing the <br/>
right things, but their children just won&#39;t cooperate.  They want us to tell them <br/>
how to make their children do their work, do their chores, stop fighting, <br/>
turn off the TV and eat good food.  They sometimes seem to want us to tell them <br/>
150 soothing things, like &quot;OOOh, you&#39;re such a good mother, you work so hard, <br/>
your kids are lucky to have you, isn&#39;t it hard to be a mom?  Kids are awful, <br/>
just tell them you work your butt off for them, and they need to appreciate you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not what they hear here.  They might hear &quot;Go watch TV with them.  <br/>
Make them more fun food.  Forget waxing your wood floor and expecting it to stay <br/>
that way; you have kids!  Lighten up.   Don&#39;t be a martyr.  Yes you SHOULD <br/>
learn the names of the characters on your kids&#39; favorite shows.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they hear &quot;Get up and go hang out with your kids instead of with <br/>
us, because it won&#39;t get better until you can be with them and relax and really <br/>
hear what they&#39;re doing, and what they&#39;re interested in, and give them so much <br/>
attention they don&#39;t want any more.  THEN they will stop acting out.  They <br/>
need MORE attention and love, not less.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Deb was suggesting that people with lazy mean brats want us to <br/>
support them.  I think (guessing &lt;g&gt;) she means there are not so many lazy <br/>
mean brats when/if people will look at their children in a more attentive, <br/>
respectful way, but some moms don&#39;t come here to learn how to be more attentive and <br/>
respectful, and they resent the suggestion that they&#39;re NOT already being as <br/>
attentive and respectful as their children need or deserve.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, what you said.  I was too lazy to write it all out. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a lazy kid.  I have seen kids who shut down because their<br/>
mom&#39;s were nagging, pushy, manipulative, nothing-will-ever-be-good-enough<br/>
parents and sometimes the only escape from that when you&#39;re little is<br/>
depression and withdrawal.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone comes to a list like this of their own free will, on purpose,<br/>
asking what to do about family problems;  If they&#39;re fouling up the<br/>
chance of a good and happy life with their kids and can&#39;t stand to hear<br/>
someone say &quot;you could be nicer,&quot;  I&#39;m not going to hold their hand and<br/>
say &quot;good mom&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
The intro to this list seems pretty plain to me.  It doesn&#39;t say come in<br/>
and be coddled. <br/>

Paths have to go somewhere, or they&#39;re no good! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And paths without options to go left or right, up or down, are pretty boring. <br/>

<br/>
It seems I&#39;m not either. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems clearly to show an adversarial relationship at home when a mom comes <br/>
here and gets angry at us because we took her kids&#39; side against her.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s hard to express to people who are rigid and defensive and want the <br/>
help they think they want (other help they define as &quot;no help at all&quot;), is that <br/>
if their kids are happy, they will be happier too.   If any one person in the <br/>
family can become calmer and more pleasant, the rest of the people&#39;s lives are <br/>
instantly calmer and more pleasant too *UNLESS* they&#39;re all in competition and <br/>
in the habit of defining their happiness by someone else&#39;s unhappiness.<br/>
<br/>
In those cases, unschooling isn&#39;t going to fix their problem.  They have <br/>
worse problems than just how to help their kids learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
One of the saddest things I&#39;ve ever heard that didn&#39;t involve blood and <br/>
maiming was that subtly-maiming thing some parents do, where they express pleasure <br/>
that their child is unhappy. &quot;Serves him right,&quot; or &quot;That will teach him,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;We&#39;ll see how staying home a month without the phone affects her attitude.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When they say it standing right next to me and I can kind of feel their <br/>
negativity in a physical way, it&#39;s revolting.  I thought of that when I was writing <br/>
ideas about siblings not getting along.  If I&#39;m sitting really close to a kid <br/>
sometimes I can sense their mood change before they express it verbally.  And <br/>
I remembered being up close to strident, self-righteous, mean parents <br/>
sometimes and how truly sorry I felt for their children.<br/>
