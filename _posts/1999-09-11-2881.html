<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972238328">I just thought I might introduce myself , seeing as I have been<br/>
eavesdropping on all of your conversations for the past two weeks.  My<br/>
name is Faith and I am the mother of 4.  I have a 7yob, 5yog, 2yog, and<br/>
a 2mo. old girl. (I am really new at all of this computer lingo so bear<br/>
with me!  And if someone would be so kind as to tell me what all of the<br/>
abbreviations, (i.e. dh, dd, lol, etc.) mean, I would be ever so<br/>
grateful!<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I were faced with the decision of &quot;SCHOOL&quot;  for our son<br/>
two years ago and the thought of putting him into a ps frightened the<br/>
daylights out of us.  First of all the schools around here are just<br/>
scary (they teach some weird curr. that go way against our faith), and<br/>
second, our son is way to vulnerable to be inindated by the garbage that<br/>
flies around the ps (i.e. language, stories, behavior, etc.).  We had a<br/>
friend from church who was hs and running a daycare who told me I should<br/>
hs.  My 7yo is a least a half a year ahead of his peers so I couldn&#39;t<br/>
imagine him in ps.  He&#39;s the type who would get bored waiting for the<br/>
rest of the class to catch up and end up in the principle&#39;s office!<br/>
He&#39;s a VERY quick learner and he likes learning on his own.  By the time<br/>
I would wake up in the morning, he would already be at his desk working<br/>
on his school books so he could get done in order to play. (Now I know<br/>
some of you are going to ooo and awww at him not being able to play<br/>
until his work was done, but remember I just heard about unschooling,<br/>
ok?)<br/>
<br/>
So, this is my 3rd year hsing and I really love it .  I love being the<br/>
one who gets to see when the light bulbs go on in my childrens&#39; heads,<br/>
and their eyes light up because of something they have just discovered.<br/>
Although, for the past 2 years I have constantly been down on myself<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t making my house a &#39;SCHOOL&#39;.  I thought it was wrong and<br/>
my son wasn&#39;t really being &#39;taught&#39; or learning because it wasn&#39;t<br/>
structured enough.<br/>
<br/>
Now, since I have been &#39;listening&#39; to you guys, I find that it&#39;s ok?<br/>
WOW!!  You mean I don&#39;t have to have a set schedule and a &#39;classroom&#39;<br/>
atmosphere and my children are still going to learn?<br/>
<br/>
One of the posts I read was talking about kindergarten and getting on<br/>
kids for not writing neatly.  I am ashamed to say, but I realized I was<br/>
doing that to my 5yo.  Boy, do I feel bad.  I remember kindergarten as<br/>
nothing but fun playtime with friends not what I have been trying to<br/>
make it.  I definately need to relax!<br/>
<br/>
I have really been enjoying the insights I have received in the past<br/>
couple of weeks.  Thank you.  I don&#39;t know if I can completely go to<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; but I am going to &#39;try&#39; to can this scheduleing and stop<br/>
trying to make my home a &#39;school&#39;!<br/>
<br/>
Also, about this socialization thing.  My dad has been the only one to<br/>
say anything about my kids not being able to socialize enough.  But I<br/>
always remind him that my children are at church at least 3 times a week<br/>
(sunday school, Royal Rangers and Missionettes (like girls and boys<br/>
scouts), and youth outreaches) where my kids are around a ton of kids<br/>
their age.  Around here there are a lot of hs families.  Probably 50% of<br/>
our church families hs and I&#39;m hearing of more people I know turning to<br/>
hs.  Usually when people ask my kids what school they go to and they<br/>
find out we hs, I hear, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s great!  I wish I could&#39;ve hs my<br/>
kids.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m thinking about doing that myself!&quot; It&#39;s almost becoming<br/>
trendy!  I think more people would if they knew unschooling was out<br/>
there.  I think some people are so afraid of it because they think they<br/>
have to make it like &#39;school&#39;!  If they knew they could relax and just<br/>
have fun with their kids they would be more willing.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve rambled enough!!!!  Sorry, but thanks for listening!<br/>
