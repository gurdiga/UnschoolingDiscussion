<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477852104">I may be totally off line here, keep in mind we are very new to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
However, wouldn&#39;t letting her go to school, be child lead learning, and<br/>
letting her follow her own path?<br/>
<br/>
I have always thought that if one of my sons actually wanted to go to<br/>
school, that I should just let them go, but also if they wanted to come back<br/>
home, they could do that also.<br/>
<br/>
All the friends my boys have, go to public school, and my boys have no<br/>
desire whatsoever to go to school with them, so far, but I have always<br/>
envisioned that one of them may want to just try it out and see what it is<br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
Chances are your daughter, if allowed to just try it out would not like it<br/>
anyway.  Maybe ask her what she thinks it would be like, so you know EXACTLY<br/>
what it is she thinks she is missing by not going to school.  Is it the<br/>
clothes shopping before hand, the new notebook, etc..??  Is it the<br/>
socialization, because there would not be as much as she probably thinks<br/>
there is, with her coming from an unschooling family.  Maybe she wants a<br/>
&quot;desk&quot; of her own, for &quot;school&quot;.  Is she involved in any extra-curricular<br/>
activities with her friends, like gymnastics, sports, or dance, etc...??<br/>
<br/>
Just my meanderings for the morning........mind you I am barely awake......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725503834">My daughter was like that after having been in school<br/>
for two years.  It was hard for her to break away. <br/>
She felt that she was missing something.  I tried to<br/>
fight her and insist on unschooling, but she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
do it.  So I gave her what she wanted.  I would take<br/>
her in September and do the school shopping thing. <br/>
She loved it.  I even bought her a new lunch box and<br/>
made her lunch.  I gave her assignments and graded her<br/>
(of course she always got A&#39;s).  I got already made up<br/>
worksheets on enchantedlearning.com and would give<br/>
those to her.  Every year when it came time for school<br/>
to start she would go through this, than one year she<br/>
said I feel sorry for kids who are in school and I am<br/>
glad I am home.  But she had to come to it in her own<br/>
time.  One thing I have learned, just because I<br/>
believe something and have believed it from the start<br/>
does not necessarily mean my children will.  They also<br/>
need to be given time to process things in life and<br/>
come to terms with it at their own time.  Even though<br/>
our kids are home with us society still influences<br/>
them a bit.  So homeschool her where she is at.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This time last year, Jack saw all his neighborhood friends getting ready for <br/>
kindergarten. He came home one day all excited and informed me that school <br/>
was starting soon and didn&#39;t I think it was about time to take him? He was <br/>
actually shocked when I told him that no, I didn&#39;t think it was time, nor did <br/>
I plan on ever taking him. (Needless to say, Jack went to school last year!) <br/>
He begged, he pleaded, he told us exactly why he wanted to go to school and <br/>
Darin and I finally agreed that he would go, so he did. School wasn&#39;t all <br/>
Jack thought it would be, he had to get up early (Jack likes his sleep) he <br/>
had to go on days Moly and I were doing things he would rather be doing... By <br/>
Christmas time, Jack was beginning to do the *I don&#39;t wanna* thing every <br/>
morning. Don&#39;t get me wrong, he loved being in school, he just hated the <br/>
hours. After a year of it, he was glad to be done. He realizes he plays with <br/>
his friends more after school than during school, he doesn&#39;t have to miss out <br/>
on what Moly and I are doing, and he can get those much needed zzz&#39;s that he <br/>
loves so much. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recommend school, but it wasn&#39;t the worst experience of our lives. He <br/>
didn&#39;t come out damaged, he wasn&#39;t labeled... (although I was sure he would <br/>
be) I don&#39;t know if he learned anything he wasn&#39;t already learning here at <br/>
home but he took from it what it offered and thankfully left the rest. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t unschooling, but it certainly wasn&#39;t forced either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215347952">Yes Sandra, I agree with what you said.<br/>
<br/>
Another point that leads to the fears of unschooling, is the HUGE amount of<br/>
curriculum suppliers, and &quot;Hooked on Phonics&quot;, Sylvan Learning Center, and<br/>
others, that tend to make parents feel like they are never doing &quot;enough&quot;<br/>
for their children.<br/>
<br/>
I at first felt this pressure.  I would scour the net and catalogs for this<br/>
and that, and always thought I had found something better.  We are in the<br/>
process of moving AGAIN, and AGAIN, I am packing up all this stuff we paid<br/>
so much money for that either hardly or never was used, or was a total waste<br/>
of time or money.  They have to be making so much money off all these<br/>
homeschool curriculum materials, really.<br/>
<br/>
Of course one of the first questions of other homeschoolers, when I began to<br/>
homeschool was &quot;oh, what curriculum are you using?&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498557120">As long term &#39;Unschoolers&quot; (13 years) we&#39;ve had to face this &quot;problem&quot; a few<br/>
times.  Particularly, when our daughter&#39;s friends were just starting school<br/>
and again when she decided not to attend High School. (School years are<br/>
separated differently in Australia - Primary School is up to and including<br/>
Year 6 and High School being Years 7 to 12.)  I hope my thoughts are<br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The problem we are having is our youngest, who sees her friends (all ages)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; carrying crowd.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She probably doesn&#39;t really want to go to school just to &quot;play&quot; at going to<br/>
school?  Maybe you could make up a lunch box for her for a little while so<br/>
she feel like her friends. After all, she probably has very pleasant<br/>
associations with picnics which is what a lunch box probably represents in<br/>
her experience.<br/>
<br/>
Why not let her design her own assignments on subjects that interest her.<br/>
Whether or not she ever completes the assignments could be her choice - our<br/>
daughter, on occasion, has insisted I put pressure on her to finish what she<br/>
has started so she can feel a sense of accomplishment on completion. Even if<br/>
no assignments are ever completed what she will learn about about the<br/>
subject and how to research a topic are valuable anyway.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>books (she loves them and &gt;does them with no prompting from me although she<br/>
really wants me to say &quot;ok, now it&#39;s time &gt;for...&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that the real &quot;problem&quot; here is that your daughter is not<br/>
choosing to learn the way you think she should.  I have found that, for us<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; is about letting go of our preconcieved ideas of how a child<br/>
&quot;ought&quot; to learn and respecting the learning style of the child at any given<br/>
time.  If your daughter is happy to learning by doing worksheets and using<br/>
&quot;school type books&quot; why not let her?  There is a big difference between<br/>
having to use a particular resource and choosing to use it. (If you REALLY<br/>
want her to stop using these books why not try making her sit down and do<br/>
&quot;school&quot;. lol)  What she covers in her &quot;school books&quot; can be a wonderful<br/>
spring board for discussion about how the knowledge is used in the real<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
If she wants a timetable why not involve her is setting one up that doesn&#39;t<br/>
inconvenience others - a great lesson in time management.  By trying to<br/>
stick to a schedule she will learn how restricting it is to have a timetable<br/>
dictate when and for how long you can study a particular subject.  On the<br/>
other hand, she may thrive on having her days regulated.<br/>
<br/>
Our 13 yo daughter has gone through several phases where she wanted her<br/>
learning to be more regulated.  None of which lasted long.  Each time she<br/>
had bought into the &quot;social wisdom&quot; that says learning only happens when you<br/>
are made to do &quot;school work&quot;.  It never took long for her to find the<br/>
&quot;school work&quot; boring and restrictive and revert to, what I prefer to call,<br/>
&quot;free-range&quot; learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and when school starts again in this area I want<br/>
&gt; to do something with her (and older son) to help take the sting out of her<br/>
 </span></blockquote>friends not being around &gt;much anymore. (Even the ones who homeschool are<br/>
&quot;going back to school.&quot;)  Maybe a trip to the &gt;dinosaur exhibit at the<br/>
Natural History Museum?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t hurt to point out that field trips like this don&#39;t happen very<br/>
often for children who go to school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway the point of this is to ask:  What do you do when the whole family<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is unschooling and one doesn&#39;t want to?<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you trust her and respect her desire to experiment with a variety<br/>
of learning methods and resources while she finds out what works for her.<br/>
If we truly want our children to think for themselves, and not be the drones<br/>
that school turns out, then we need to respect all their choices even when<br/>
those choices are not what we would choose for them.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Every so often my Casey toys with the idea of school. I&#39;ve tried to take her <br/>
inquiries seriously and also tried to figure out what it was she was really <br/>
looking for.<br/>
<br/>
At this time of year I take her to the store for Not-back-to-School <br/>
supplies. After all, why should only the school kids get all the cool stuff? <br/>
I get her new markers, pencils, notebooks...whatever catches her fancy. One <br/>
year it was indeed the fancy lunchbox she was wanting. I bought her a cool <br/>
one and then packed her lunch up for her each morning just as if she she <br/>
were off to school. I did this for as long as she wanted. I think it was <br/>
about a week or two before the novelty wore off. Now she uses it for park <br/>
visits and such.<br/>
<br/>
For awhile she asked me for work folders and assignments. :-P I made some up <br/>
for her and we played school. Of course I had no expectation that this <br/>
&quot;work&quot; would be completed. She did what she liked, got bored with the <br/>
repetition soon enough and I think this also lasted for a week or two.<br/>
<br/>
Last winter she actually visited a classroom with her friend and decided <br/>
she&#39;d like to go part-time. I made inquiries to see if I could make it <br/>
happen for her. In the time it took to get some answers from the school, <br/>
Casey decided tht she really wasn&#39;t interested. I think her exact comment <br/>
was &quot;It would take up too much of my time and interfere with all my real <br/>
activities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Casey is really a diehard unschooler and appreciates every bit of freedom <br/>
she has. Every so often she just wants to see what the rest of the kids are <br/>
up to. I try to help her get a glimpse and that seems to be all she is <br/>
really wanting.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
