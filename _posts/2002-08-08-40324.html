<br/>
I don&#39;t get this, and can&#39;t for the life me understand why some are <br/>
congratulating you for it. Please enlighten me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t say why they&#39;re congratulating me, but to talk of mid-20th century <br/>
Germans as though they were Americans from 2002 doesn&#39;t make sense.  It makes <br/>
rhetorical sense (in the rhetoric-as-sneaky-tricks sense)  but not <br/>
historical, geographical, sociological, anthropological or logical sense.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little like saying the Catholic church in 1550 was violating the civil <br/>
rights of heretics by not reading them their Miranda rights and that they <br/>
should have respected their freedom of religion in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
To look at all the world through American eyes and judge them ignorant or <br/>
backward or mean or anything by our current standards and under our current <br/>
laws is to think and act as though we (current Americans, or in Ned&#39;s case <br/>
current American Libertarians) are the holders of pure truth and right, and <br/>
that others are slackers who should get with the (our) program.  That is <br/>
ethnocentrism.  It&#39;s a macro-political version of the descriptions of <br/>
toddlers&#39; awareness of themselves and the world.  If a toddler is a boy he <br/>
might think not being a boy is wrong.  If he has short hair he might think <br/>
not having short hair is wrong.  If he sleeps in his own bed, another toddler <br/>
sleeping somewhere else is wrong.  They generalize from a small set of <br/>
specific knowledge.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want other descriptions and examples, here are some good ones I found <br/>
with google.com<br/>
