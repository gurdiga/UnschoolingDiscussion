<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	• Have demonstrated leadership in their school and community-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A couple of times when there were requirements for something about school performance or prominence, I wrote that he/she was the only one in her class, but that he was cooperative, industrious, attentive…. helpful with others in the family, at our homeschooling group, and at homeschooling conferences…..   Stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
For insuring teenaged drivers who didn’t have report cards to show to get a discount, I talked to USAA directly and said there were no grades, but that as the only one in his class, he was first in his class.  I asked if it was cheating to say they were qualifying students, since they were homeschooled, and the agent said it wasn’t at all.<br/>
<br/>
When you get a draft, maybe we could help you word it.<br/>
<br/>
But definitely encourage him to say he’s in the community with people of all ages, and in communication with homeschoolers or gamers or whatever (however that can be worded well) in several states (whatever’s right and true about that).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710146543"><p dir="ltr">I won a Rotary scholarship once, and I won lots of small grants and scholarships when I was high school aged. I was very much schooled, of course, and a praise junkie, but what they were looking for in interviews was clear to me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They wanted to see genuine creative thinking and intellectual curiosity *outside* of school. There are a million strong academic candidates, but there *aren&#39;t* a million candidates who can speak clearly and effectively with adults about a broad range of topics based on independent (non-school-directed) interests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I remember that my dad was reading a really interesting book and we talked about it at dinner. So I talked about that. I talked about all my &quot;dorky&quot; stuff-how I watched tv shows about finance and investing and learned how to make architectural drawings for the cover of reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An unschooler is *perfectly* qualified for those types of conversations.</p>
