<div id="ygrps-yiv-406383248">I have to agree with with Sandra on this issue.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t see any benefit to antagonising people when it is so easy <br/>
to refrain from doing so. I remember years ago, long before I had kids, <br/>
I had a job where I had to interview people for ? not sure what you call <br/>
it in the US? government benefits? support payments? for unemployed <br/>
people and solo mothers. I was interviewing a woman when her baby <br/>
started to cry, whereupon she undid her shirt completely, and sat there <br/>
with both breasts exposed, nursing the baby on one side and letting the <br/>
milk drip from the other breast onto the forms she was completing, which <br/>
I then had to take for processing. I found that extremely offensive at <br/>
the time, and still feel that it was an act of deliberate aggression <br/>
against &#39;the enemy&#39; as she appeared from other behaviour to believe we <br/>
were. I was 19yo. at the time. I think after that experience it is a <br/>
miracle that I went on to nurse 4 sons, tandem nurse, nurse one son <br/>
through to age five etc etc and become a LLL leader.<br/>
<br/>
When my second son was little, we were flooded out of our tent in a <br/>
flash flood in a camping ground. I was sitting on a chair in the kitchen <br/>
very discretely nursing our 4month old baby, when an elderly man came in <br/>
and made his cup of tea and toast for breakfast. Just as he was about to <br/>
leave, he looked at me and then asked (he had to ask, as there was <br/>
nothing to see), if I was nursing the baby. When I said yes, he went <br/>
wild, told me to go to my tent. I explained it was flooded, so he told <br/>
me to go and nurse in the toilet (? bathroom?). I told him I&#39;d nurse the <br/>
baby in the &#39;ladies&#39; if he went and ate his breakfast in the &#39;mens&#39;, but <br/>
otherwise, I was staying put.<br/>
<br/>
I am a pretty stroppy woman when it comes to defending my rights, or <br/>
those of my children, but doen&#39;t believe it is necessary or polite or <br/>
respectful to blatantly rub those rights in other peoples faces <br/>
unnecessarily. Many people do find the sight of naked breasts <br/>
disturbing. Even people who, in their head, know it is all natural, <br/>
still find it uncomfortable. Can&#39;t we ask that they be respected where <br/>
there is no hardship to us, or our babies, in the process?<br/>

&gt; like me telling Lexie to &quot;be careful&quot; when<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s pooring the milk or crossing the<br/>
&gt; street.  Of course she&#39;s careful, why woudl<br/>
&gt; she not be.  it&#39;s more like it&#39;s belittling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She wouldn&#39;t be careful if she had no notion of the possible <br/>
consequences (didn&#39;t understand the dangers of traffic), or didn&#39;t care <br/>
about the consequences (had never had to clean up the mess, had never <br/>
gone stinky from rotten milk on unwashed clothes), OR just didn&#39;t care <br/>
enough about other people to worry that someone else might dislike <br/>
having to clean up, or be in the presence of a rotten-milk-stinky person.<br/>
<br/>
If the notice needs to be given at all, presumably it means that there <br/>
are people who attend LLL conferences who are either not aware of the <br/>
discomfort others may feel at the sight of breasts / nursing babies, or <br/>
who don&#39;t care. Then LLL needs to decide whether it wants to promote <br/>
breastfeeding in the community, or whether it wants to just say, &#39;we <br/>
know this is best, stuff you if you don&#39;t like it&#39;. Yeah, I know that&#39;s <br/>
not what you are saying, but I can also see how it could be interpreted <br/>
that way by people who are not LLL minded.<br/>
<br/>
 So I guess I am trying to say: 1) I think babies should be nursed when <br/>
and where they need it, 2) I agree that some people will be offended no <br/>
matter what you do, and well, tough, that sort will just have to suffer <br/>
&lt;g&gt;, 3) I think if we want to encourage acceptance of breastfeeding, we <br/>
need also to encourage respect for others feelings, especially where <br/>
there be no need for conflict.<br/>

<br/>
Welfare.<br/>
(what they call it in the US)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I was interviewing a woman when her baby <br/>
started to cry, whereupon she undid her shirt completely, and sat there <br/>
with both breasts exposed, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a &quot;friend&quot; (former girlfriend of my current husband, in addition to <br/>
other connections), who had babies along/after I did.  I nursed in the SCA, <br/>
never exposed, making costumes that would accommodate, etc.<br/>
<br/>
She flopped wholly out once, massive breast, out of a Renaissance costume, <br/>
sitting under electric light, near where people needed to bring their dishes <br/>
and such after a feast--not in a dark corner, of which there were dozens.  <br/>
Not with a blanket or shawl or veil, of which there were hundreds in the <br/>
room.  I came and talked to her about being more discrete.  <br/>
<br/>
Her dumb-ass answer was this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well you nurse YOUR babies in public.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  But I never exposed myself that way, and I kept the babies covered.<br/>
<br/>
She looked at me without recognition of the English language, or of concept.<br/>
<br/>
I said that what she did reflected on all nursing mothers, and it would be <br/>
bad if public sentiment turned against the idea because she couldn&#39;t be more <br/>
careful.<br/>
<br/>
Two other stories of the same person, to illustrate a point:<br/>
<br/>
1.  She got really angry at the rest of us in the SCA (the order of the <br/>
Laurel, specifically, for those here who are SCA members) because we had <br/>
never told her about Dover books.<br/>
<br/>
2.  She did a piece of embroidery and entered it in a competition for which I <br/>
was a judge.  The work she did was nice, but it wasn&#39;t stable (meaning--shame <br/>
to waste that much energy on something that was going to come apart when it <br/>
was washed), AND... mysteriously, it was only the front of a neckpiece/yoke.  <br/>
I asked why she hadn&#39;t done the back too.  After a three-second gaze that <br/>
seemed &quot;processing...  ... processing...&quot;  she said &quot;it didn&#39;t show it in the <br/>
photo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SO.<br/>
My point is even some of the people who will go to a LLL conference aren&#39;t <br/>
brilliant, and only do what people TELL them to do, and only find what people <br/>
TELL them to find.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of them are followers, and are there because they want to do what LLL <br/>
folk do, and be like LLL folk are being, and might really, truly, need to be <br/>
reminded not to flash the neighbors.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826611446">I really think the issue may be that many moms feel so surrounded by LLL and<br/>
acceptance that they really don&#39;t realize there are other, unrelated, people<br/>
in the hotel who may not be used to the openness women feel at their local<br/>
meetings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK.  Vivid word pictures of insensitivity in action.  I get it.<br/>
<br/>
I think where trouble might be stirred is that a &quot;be careful&quot; message<br/>
that is strong enough to reach the willfully insensitive (like the woman<br/>
you described) is very likely to crush the tender feelings of the more<br/>
sensitive nursing moms in the group.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s gonna take considerable word-smithing talent.<br/>
