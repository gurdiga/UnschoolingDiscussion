<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224700829">...my all-time favorite for our family. (So far.) &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our second daughter, Erin, was 2 1/2 when Eileen was born.<br/>
Erin was right at the age where toddlers use the ME pronoun<br/>
for everything. &quot;Me do it, me want that,&quot; etc. For a long<br/>
time, when you asked her the name of her baby sister,<br/>
she would answer, &quot;Me-leen.&quot;    :)<br/>
