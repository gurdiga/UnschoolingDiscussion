<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797914208">My 9 yos just came in and asked what the date was.<br/>
I told him it was the 22nd.<br/>
He said, &quot;Oh, that means it&#39;s Earth Day today. What does Earth Day mean?&quot;<br/>
I told him it&#39;s a day about remembering to keep the earth alive and healthy and growing, planting things, etc. <br/>
And he said &quot;Well, shouldn&#39;t you do that every day?&quot;<br/>
I said, &quot;yeah, you&#39;re right! We *should* do that every day.&quot;<br/>
LOL! I thought it was funny. :o)<br/>
