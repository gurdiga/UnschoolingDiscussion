&gt; one boy in our program with all the traits you are describing.  The foster <br/>
&gt; family that has him and his sister are saints...have stuck by this kid <br/>
&gt; through <br/>
&gt; unbelievable behaviors...waited years for him to go to a &quot;famous&quot; attachment <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; disorder doctor, and he is finally beginning to turn around a tiny bit.  <br/>
&gt; Still, he <br/>
&gt; has so far to go and may never change completely and may end up <br/>

Yes, the only instances where I have even heard of such personailties, have <br/>
almost always ended in the person being institutionalized in one form or <br/>
another. My aunt and uncle have been told that she will end up in jail if they do <br/>
not commit her to some hospital for behavior dysfunction. But what answer is <br/>
that? Basically the &quot;experts&quot; on nearly every level have given them no hope. So <br/>
either way, she should be locked up, according to their prophesies. <br/>
<br/>
It is not just a daily struggle, but literally a minute by minute struggle. <br/>
She can be seemingly fine and quiet one moment and a wild banshee the next. <br/>
Then of course come the self preservation/society preservation questions....do <br/>
you actually go ahead and commit such a child because there are valid fears of <br/>
what she has the ability to do? Or do you utilize every ounce of energy and <br/>
humanity to save her? And can she be saved from herself? And what about the rest <br/>
of the world? <br/>
<br/>
She is spending the summer with us, everyother week, Monday to Friday, 13 <br/>
hours a day. On the opposing weeks she is with my aunt or uncle as they are <br/>
alternating taking vacation weeks to be with her. At 14, there are no resources for <br/>
kids like this. Nor would any facility providing summer camps be willing to <br/>
take on such a responsibility. My struggle now is why am I? Is it ego driven <br/>
because she does well with us? Is it because I can&#39;t take seeing my mom, my <br/>
aunt&#39;s or my uncle&#39;s (we are the Irish equivelent to My Big Fat Greek Wedding) <br/>
shed another tear? In the four full weeks I have had her, we had one meltdown for <br/>
the last hour before she went home one day and the amount of eneregy it took <br/>
was utterly incredible. I can&#39;t fathom living it everyday with no light at the <br/>
end of the tunnel. The theory that she would outgrow certain behaviors was <br/>
WRONG. She is seeming to get worse. So I won&#39;t stop having her, over that one <br/>
breakdown, but it was enough for me to question my own intentions and enough to <br/>
put me on gaurd. And it was enough for me to see that her parents diminished <br/>
marriage (which devestated this large extended family), even in the strongest <br/>
relationships, would have a very hard time surviving. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I have rambled and turned this thread around to be about my family <br/>
and it&#39;s struggles, but if there are any people in the world who wouldn&#39;t give <br/>
up on their own children, it is definately the people here. <br/>
<br/>
Peace to all of you.<br/>
