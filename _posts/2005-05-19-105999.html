<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375718861">Hi, I am new to unschooling and have been reading your posts for about <br/>
2 weeks now. I have also learned so much. I homeschooled my 11 yo son <br/>
for the last 3 years using all kinds of curriculum. I am so glad I <br/>
decided to get rid of it all and unschool. I was reading the posts <br/>
about shyness and it makes me think of Asperger&#39;s syndrome. I believe <br/>
I have that after reading a few books about it. I still hate getting <br/>
any kind of attention as much as I did when I was a kid. I just seem <br/>
to have all the characteristics of this. One of the posts said that <br/>
her kids hated the vacuum sound. AS kids are very sensitive to sounds, <br/>
textures, all kinds of stimulus. I guess I kind of diagnosed myself, <br/>
but it makes sense to me after all these years of preferring to be <br/>
alone reading or hating attention.  Please don&#39;t think I am thinking <br/>
any of your children have this. I would never assume that!  Thanks for <br/>
all the info I get from these posts. You guys are great!    Mary</div>
