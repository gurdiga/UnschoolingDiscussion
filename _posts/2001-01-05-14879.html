<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912068088">Hi Carol,<br/>
No &#39;typical&#39; day for our family, but heres some of the things our girls have<br/>
done in the past 2 months or so. Some days it seems nothing is going on, and<br/>
then others are very busy. Writing just fits in when there is a need for it.<br/>
I have 3 daughters, ages 16, 10 and 5 yrs.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest takes gymnastics & piano lessons, so a big part of her day is<br/>
spent practicing both of those.. She also has a part time job 2 days a week<br/>
working at an Art Print Shop. She is into survivalist/nature stuff right<br/>
now..learning animal tracking and finding out about wild edibles and making<br/>
outdoor shelters. She is also planning an extended backpacking trip just as<br/>
soon as it warms up. She just finished with an in-depth study of Ireland<br/>
after reading the book &quot;Angelas Ashes&quot;. She works on art projects, likes to<br/>
paint animal forms on rocks..and is now learning pysanky. She has many<br/>
e-pals and spends time writing letters..is also working on her own web page.<br/>
She recently took an on-line writing class taught by another homeschool mom.<br/>
<br/>
The 10yo recently discovered books and reads and reads.. the Dear America<br/>
series and anything about Dinosaurs. She spends lots of time working on art<br/>
stuff as that seems to be the particular &#39;bent&#39; of our family. Loves to<br/>
count her money, and is learning to use the keyboard so she can type her own<br/>
emails to a penpal. She plays chess and puts together puzzles. Watches allot<br/>
of Wishbone, Animal Planet and Science/History videos we rent from the<br/>
library.<br/>
<br/>
The 5yo joins in with most of the 10yo activities. She is also into art and<br/>
draws so well for her age. Lots of pretend games with the older sister,<br/>
using dolls and stuffed animal collections. We have a real cash register<br/>
that the girls love to play store and restaurant with.<br/>
<br/>
We visit the library every other week..and usually have a family read-a-loud<br/>
book in progress too. We take indoor field trips in the winter months and go<br/>
camping/hiking/fishing in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that is what you were wanting..I think ended up being more than<br/>
&#39;alittle&#39; sorry I tend to get long winded.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160489512">Hi, we have four children here ages 17, 15, 13, 11. Our typical days at the <br/>
moment start very early because the kids all received puppies for Christmas. <br/>
The kids decided they wanted to start raising puppies so I took the money I <br/>
made in my business this Christmas and bought pups. So now our days start <br/>
about 6:00 with whining pups wanting to go out. I let the kids each have half <br/>
an hour each morn to use the playstation or pc, whichever they choose. After <br/>
that and breakfast the kids wander off to do individual projects while I get <br/>
some work done on the pc. For the younger boys this may be drawing, legos, or <br/>
building one thing or another. Right now they are in the middle of building <br/>
ramps and rails for their bike stunts. My 15 yr. old likes to spend her free <br/>
time working with her dog, she trains dogs in obedience. She also enjoys <br/>
needlepoint. The 17 year old takes the other computer usually and works on <br/>
her web page, helps me with the business, or chats with friends online. She <br/>
can type a smooth 75 wpm. She is also our resident builder and often gets out <br/>
her power tools and builds something. As I type this she is building a dog <br/>
exercise pen. Late morn everyone comes in to go through a Tae Bo tape. If the <br/>
weather is nice we often go for a bike ride or run instead. We then take <br/>
turns fixing lunch. Whoever is not cooking  helps with household chores. <br/>
After lunch I do ask that everyone takes some time to read for a while. This <br/>
is not a problem as we all enjoy reading. Afternoons are spent in various <br/>
ways. There is always work to be done. We usually have a book that we are <br/>
reading aloud, we enjoy that. The girls wanted to take Japanese so they <br/>
practice and do lessons. They also each play a musical instrument so they <br/>
usually practice that too. The boys like to spend some time on the computer. <br/>
They also work on a drawing program we bought. Three days a week everyone <br/>
lifts weights, it is up to them to work it in and keep track of their <br/>
progress. All four find time to work on a monthly newsletter that they send <br/>
to distant relatives. Twice a week in the evenings is karate and weekends are <br/>
spent at BMX races 8 months out of the year. TV during the day is limited to <br/>
an occasional show on the Travel Channel, Discovery, or Animal Planet. Some <br/>
of their shows are excellent. The evenings that we are home are spent <br/>
preparing the meal and we do a quick house pickup before Dad gets home. All <br/>
in all our days just seem to fly by. <br/>
peace and grace<br/>

I live in Marion off I-40 35 miles east of Aseville and 65 mi. north of Spartanbug, SC.<br>
We are hs 3. 1 dau. 13, sons 12 and 9. This is our second year and I have been studying<br>
up on unschooling. I have tried some Charlotte Mason methods and like a &nbsp;lot of it but<br>
being kind of lazy and seemingly unable to pull everything together for a really organized <br>
cirriculum, I have been reading about unschooling and kind of like some of it&#39;s ideas.<br>
I would like to hear anything about how you all accomplish the education of your children.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719425821">Would anyone be interested in giving me a sample of their typical <br/>
day?  I am just not getting the hang of this.  I&#39;m not very good at <br/>
recognizing teachable moments or integrating learning into everyday <br/>

panic, thinking they are not learning anything if I don&#39;t.  Maybe if <br/>
I saw how others are doing it, I could be inspired.  I often wonder <br/>
if we are doing enough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799989124">OK....well, lately the kids (ages 6 and 8)  get up around 8 or 8:30. I<br/>
often crawl into bed with them and snuggle and  read a few chapters of<br/>
whatever book we have going.  We just read the first 4 chapters of &quot;A<br/>
Wrinkle in Time&quot; but decided it doesn&#39;t go fast enough for our tastes,<br/>
so we are looking to start something else. One eats breakfast right off,<br/>
the other generally waits a couple hours.  After we come downstairs,<br/>
most days the girls play pretend for awhile.  Lilly often heads to the<br/>
computer mid-morning to play Roller Coaster or Zoo Tycoon. (very<br/>
educational!) Leigh sits with her and gives her ideas and enjoys playing<br/>
vicariously  through Lilly.  ;0)  Sometime over the course of the<br/>
morning, I remind the kids to brush their teeth and I encourage them to<br/>
brush their hair so it doesn&#39;t get too tangled.  If we are staying home<br/>
for the day, they rarely get dressed.   The last few days the weather<br/>
has been nice and we went bike riding in the afternoon.   I put the kids<br/>
bikes in the car and we drive to a cul de sac up the road a piece<br/>
because we live on a busy road.<br/>
 <br/>
Every day is different, but they do go in cycles.  Lately, the TV hasn&#39;t<br/>
been very popular.  I turned it from the war to cartoons this morning<br/>
when they got up.  I feel like we have watched it too much.  They<br/>
watched for an hour then shut it off and now are in the bathroom mixing<br/>
shampoos and conditioners to give their beanie babies a bath.   They<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have turned it on, had I not done it for them.  They want<br/>
company this afternoon, so I will call their friend to see if she can<br/>
come over and play.<br/>
 <br/>
I finally remembered to pick up some borax the last time I grocery<br/>
shopped.  We made crystal snowflakes and silly putty yesterday.  They<br/>
spent half the day cutting up magazines and giving the people in them<br/>
makeovers with gel pens.  The gel pens write great on magazine paper.<br/>
We discussed the war a lot.  They played.  Oh ya, they found a wooly<br/>
worm (caterpillar) the day before yesterday and made a little home for<br/>
him in a cup with a few sprigs of green grass to eat.  They let him go<br/>
when they were done playing with him.<br/>
 <br/>
Over the course of a week or a month, I am sure we cover and cover well,<br/>
all the required subjects.  We read (I read to them, they can read, but<br/>
don&#39;t choose to read books to themselves yet, they read on zoo and<br/>
roller coaster tycoon and similar things), do science (wooly worm, zoo<br/>
tycoon, borax, cooking, discuss health issues like why we brush our<br/>
teeth), cover history/geography (war and we love our globe and maps),<br/>
language arts (how can you not?  But Lilly loves to write stories), math<br/>
(zoo tycoon, roller coaster tycoon, cooking, spending money, playing<br/>
board games and card games).  You can&#39;t just look at one day,  you have<br/>
to look at a month to see the big picture.  <br/>
 <br/>
I hope this helps.  I started with a day and got side tracked.  :0)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know you asked for typical day stuff but I think you might want to look at <br/>
your wording/thinking.  First... all moments are learning moments.  You can&#39;t <br/>
stop or start learning.  It just happens.  And I don&#39;t integrate learning <br/>
into everyday.  It just happens as my boys live their lives.  They can&#39;t help <br/>
it.  And it they find something worth investigating they will learn more.  <br/>
They will ask questions.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday.  <br/>
We got up early for us, 9:00.  And started with a trip to the feed store for <br/>
garden things.  We tilled the garden and put straw on it.  Planted some root <br/>
veggies.  Seeded a bare spot on our lawn, finished marking spots for holes <br/>
for posts for our new deck.  Watched &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. Boys had a craving for <br/>
popcorn chicken so I took them to KFC, yuck!!  Finished up the top for a <br/>
drunkards path quilt to donate to the unschooling conference raffle.  <br/>
<br/>
My boys had lots of fun with he straw.  Moving it from one place to another.  <br/>
Trying to push the bails up hill.  Making a bed out of it.  And then a bench <br/>
etc.  They loved the watering part of the lawn.  Helped some with the <br/>
planting.  Also helped some with marking the spots for the holes.  They hit <br/>
some golf balls and played in the sand.  Hated shopping but compromised, KFC <br/>
after, everyone wins.  Had a great productive day.<br/>
<br/>
Every day is different so not sure it is a typical day.<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s ten, so reading a lot on his own isn&#39;t natural anyway.  Honestly.  Don&#39;t <br/>
make him do any writing or math.   Move toward making his life like a luxury <br/>
summer camp based around surfing, skating, fishing and dirtbikes.  Make sure <br/>
his equipment is good.  Is he old enough or have the interest to change his <br/>
own wheels or bearings?  (Maybe his skates are still new.)    Does he have <br/>
subscriptions to any  magazines on his hobbies?  I&#39;d do that for sure, so <br/>
he&#39;ll get mail and even if he doesn&#39;t read the words yet, he&#39;ll have new <br/>
pictures and other input so he can think more and more about what he <br/>
currently loves.<br/>
<br/>
Any of those interests might fade, and that&#39;s okay, but there&#39;s not one of <br/>
them that doesn&#39;t involve math, physics, words, and some will lead easily to <br/>
geography (fishing) or mechanics (dirtbikes).  But don&#39;t SAY so to him.  Just <br/>
look for those things yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
Typical moments are better to consider than typical days.  Please read these <br/>
when you have a chance:<br/>

to do at the beginning is to learn to just *get out of the way*. Kids <br/>
will learn, if we just don&#39;t try to make them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So frequently I will fall back on structured lessons out of <br/>
&gt; panic, thinking they are not learning anything if I don&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you haven&#39;t done so already, I&#39;d suggest a trip to the library or <br/>
bookstore. You can fill up on books like &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; by <br/>
John Holt, &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by Grace Llewellyn <br/>
(which is not just for teenagers, it&#39;s great for anyone to read who <br/>
is starting out on an unschooling journey). Really, the hardest part <br/>
of unschooling for most people is getting their *own* head wrapped <br/>
around the idea that kids will learn *without* teaching. That <br/>
teaching them is not only not necessary, it is completely counter-<br/>
productive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe if <br/>
&gt; I saw how others are doing it, I could be inspired.  I often wonder <br/>
&gt; if we are doing enough.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d also suggest sitting down and thinking about what your own <br/>
passions are. What are *you* interested in learning? When you are <br/>
occupied with following your own interests, you will accomplish two <br/>
things. The first is that you give your kids a great model of how <br/>
*you* learn new things, the mistakes you make, the things that keep <br/>
you going. The second is that it gives you something to occupy your <br/>
mind so that you don&#39;t obsess about exactly how much your kids are <br/>
learning at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
So, here&#39;s a typical day for us:<br/>
<br/>
My son wakes up about 6:00, he usually peeks in on me and then goes <br/>
off to build with Lego or Bionicles. I either sleep in or get up and <br/>
do email and daily organization. My daughter wakes about 7:00 or so <br/>
and we all go down and make breakfast. If I&#39;m cooking something, <br/>
usually one of the kids helps out. After we eat, I do whatever <br/>
cleaning up needs to be done, and sometimes the kids help out or <br/>
sometimes they go to play or do writing or painting or use the <br/>
computer. <br/>
Then we&#39;re usually off for wherever we&#39;re going for the day. On <br/>
different days we have different activities - violin lessons, <br/>
homeschool singing group, homeschool park day or gymnastics day, a <br/>
playdate, our &quot;Homeschool Hogwarts&quot; group will be starting back up in <br/>
two weeks, and if the weather&#39;s nice we might go hiking or for a bike <br/>
ride, if not we might hit the pool or the library, or the science <br/>
center, sometimes we have homeschool field trips or other activities. <br/>
We often ride our bikes for transportation to wherever we&#39;re going. <br/>
Today we have violin lessons in the morning, and then we&#39;ll either go <br/>
to the library or to someplace outside if the weather&#39;s good. <br/>
At some point in the day, DH will take over and I&#39;ll go do my workout <br/>
(triathlon training and coaching is one of my interests), and if I&#39;ve <br/>
got a writing project going, I will take time to do that as well. If <br/>
I&#39;m in an editing stage, my son often sits with me while I read my <br/>
writing out loud and edit it. Afternoons are usually time at home and <br/>
we might do a craft project, or I&#39;ll read to the kids, or we&#39;ll cook <br/>
something for dinner, or the kids will play. We often have other kids <br/>
over to our house, it seems to be becoming the place where kids <br/>
congregate. Evenings we do different things. Monday night is <br/>
our &quot;Family Movie night&quot; and the kids take turns picking the movie. <br/>
We usually go swimming two evenings a week, and other nights we might <br/>
play games, read, do puzzles, or just each do our own thing. <br/>
Bedtime I always read a picture book or two and then read from <br/>
whatever chapter book we&#39;re in the middle of (Lord of the Rings right <br/>
now) and snuggle up with the kids to go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure on any given day I could look at what we&#39;re doing and <br/>
say &quot;We haven&#39;t done much today&quot; and I could choose to freak out <br/>
about it and panic. But when I look back over a week or a month I can <br/>
see the rich tapestry of fun and learning that is our life. This <br/>
month we saw two baby lambs being born, we went to the science museum <br/>
and did some chemistry stuff there, we&#39;ve baked bread, watched the <br/>
first bees buzz on our new flowers, worked in our garden, rode <br/>
bicycles and swam, played music together and found new music to <br/>
download on the internet that each of us liked, completed a new <br/>
puzzle, played trains and legos and raced hot wheels cars down our <br/>
driveway, hiked to the river and sailed &quot;fairy boats&quot;, watched a war <br/>
being launched on TV, got out our globe and atlases, looked at where <br/>
Iraq and Kuwait and Turkey and all those other places are located, <br/>
the list goes on and on. <br/>
<br/>
But *none* of these things were done with the intent of <br/>
creating &quot;teachable moments&quot; or &quot;learning opportunities&quot;. They were <br/>
all done because one or more of us were interested in that particular <br/>
activity at that time. They were done because they were fun and <br/>
interesting and just part of an enjoyable life. The learning is in us <br/>
and of us and all around us. We don&#39;t have to seek for it, we just <br/>
have to have the faith to get out of its way.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;My boys are 4 and 10.  The oldest learned to read without much <br/>
intervention besides my reading to him.  But he doesn&#39;t read books on <br/>
his own much yet.  He does not like to write, hates math (lessons), <br/>
loves to surf, skate, fish, dirtbike.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Typical days around here vary so much. For the most part, anyone coming here for a day or a week to see how and what my children are learning, would probably say nothing. All they do is play. Excluding of course those of you on this list. &lt;bg&gt; Even Tara is amazed what they know because as she puts it, they never really &quot;do&quot; anything.<br/>
<br/>
My kids usually get up one at a time. Joseph (8) Sierra (7) and Alyssa (2) all have different times of waking and one never knows who will be up first. Sometimes one or all of them will come and snuggle with me in bed. Sometimes one or all of them will head to my mom&#39;s and hang out with her. (she has an attached MIL apt) Sometimes one or all will turn on the tv and not see anyone else, or just start to play a movie from the night before that they didn&#39;t finish. (meaning act out with their toys) or just start drawing. My kids are usually up for an hour before they ask for food. They usually all eat at the same time. <br/>
<br/>
If we are staying in for the day, the play goes from there. It varies in activity and time spent on each one. Sometimes it&#39;s all short and moves quickly from one thing to another and sometimes they literally may spend hours doing somthing. It&#39;s tv, reading, either to themselves or to Alyssa. They play on the computer, lately a lot. They found this thing on postopia where it asks questions and then you have to fill in the right letters to spell the answer. I&#39;m amazed at how well Sierra spells. Gameboy and playstation have been set aside for quite awhile now. Sometimes they play board games, either with me or my mom or just with the two of them. Joseph was taking great pleasure in watching Price is  Right with my mom, although he hasn&#39;t in the past few days. He loves shows like that and is really good in math, all in his head. Sierra loves the Animal Planet channel. Joseph doesn&#39;t like it much and usually heads to his room when Sierra has it on in the playroom. Joseph draws a lot and spends a big portion of his days lately drawing elaborate pictures. Right now it seems to be city scenes. Sierra will join along sometimes and then there is also paints that come out and play dough or creepy crawlers. About 2 weeks ago, the play dough was out every day for a week. All 3 kids played with that. <br/>
<br/>
Sierra and Joseph will take turns playing with Alyssa sometimes and sometimes the 3 of them will all play together. It&#39;s with dinosaurs or horses or Polly Pockets or Barbies. Sometimes just links, marbles and balls. There is an awful lot to choose from here for them to play with. Sometimes they help cook or bake. Sometimes they are outside in the back yard, playing ball or just swinging or hunting rocks. Lately they like an evening walk searching for snail shells. We have tons of them now.<br/>
<br/>
They have also been hanging out with Tara (17) in her room and with her boyfriend when he&#39;s over. (every night!) Sierra and Alyssa spend the most time in there with them. They play games or watch tv together. Evenings they do different things with Joe when he&#39;s home. Usually games and computer stuff. Although Joe is knows to chasing them all around the house playing monster too!!! There&#39;s food and cleaning up and showers in between all this too. Never at any certain time. The children&#39;s hours are from about 10:00-11:00 a.m. until 11:30 or 12:00. Joseph usually stays up later. Sometimes with me until 2:00.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the closest thing to seeing learning by school terms is that some encyclopedia&#39;s are missing and in Joseph&#39;s room. Some days seem more educational with the kids asking questions that we look into instead of just me answering. Those days aren&#39;t too often lately. No major research has been going on here for awhile. Doesn&#39;t bother any of us in the least. We play. A lot. And most people would say that&#39;s all we do. We&#39;re a happy family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>day?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I don&#39;t think ay two days are same, but here&#39;s what&#39;s going on in my <br/>
house today.<br/>
<br/>
I woke up at 9:30. Casey (9) was up already and had been watching TV. I made <br/>
some breakfast for us and checked a few emails. Casey wants to to get back <br/>
in gymnastics shape before she starts classes again. I helped guide her <br/>
through her warm up, stretch and work out. We took a break of tv and more <br/>
emails. Then we sat down to read the latest issue of Ranger Rick including <br/>
doing all the puzzle pages. We made plans with friends and will be going <br/>
over to their condo to swim later. Before we go, Casey wants a new bathng <br/>
suit, so she&#39;s got her money ready to stop at the store on the way over.<br/>
<br/>
Conor (almost 14) woke up after 1:00 today because he was up most of the <br/>
night listenng to The Lord of the Rings-The Two Towers. He&#39;s going to come <br/>
with us to our friends condo. He may swim or he may just hang out and talk. <br/>
Later we may go to a cemetary so Conor and his friend can try their hand at <br/>
taking some artsy/cool photos with their new cameras. They&#39;ll probably play <br/>
D&D tonight.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just today and just what&#39;s already happened or is planned for later. <br/>
Plans are always up for change.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of days with Casey are filled with board and card games, reading, <br/>
crafts, writing and drawing. Conor volunteers at the Children&#39;s Museum, goes <br/>
bowling once a week with his dad and dad&#39;s friends (he mostly likes to be in <br/>
on the discussions afterwards), snowboards, reads, and games online.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713456576">I&#39;ll give you two days at our house.  No day is typical. :)  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we got up early and surprised dh with donuts in bed for <br/>
his birthday. (See yesterday&#39;s post on educationese--fire safety for <br/>
that whole story ;)  <br/>
<br/>
Downstairs we got out a root-vue kit that they had gotten for <br/>
Christmas.  You are supposed to be able to see the roots of the <br/>
plants that are growing.  We planted carrots, onions and radishes in <br/>
that.  We had the oppportunity to get out the rulers for that.  The <br/>
wicks that soak up the water needed to be cut to 6 inches, and the <br/>
seeds had to be planted 1 1/2 inches apart.  <br/>
<br/>
Then dd and I played a card game called Set.  It is a lot of fun, <br/>
although I can&#39;t beat my daughter. <br/>
<br/>
After that, dd was off to play her new pokemon ruby game and I sat <br/>
on the computer with the 3 and 5 year olds playing Putt Putt for <br/>
about an hour.  <br/>
<br/>
The boys also spent a lot of time playing with their matchbox cars <br/>
and water in the kitchen.  They dumped all of the toys out of the <br/>
plastic containers in the playroom, carried them into the kitchen, <br/>
and filled them with water.  The floor is covered with wet towels--<br/>
the kitchen has been this way for several days now. ;)  They made a <br/>
waterfall in there, boat rides, and car washes.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh and dd went on a bike ride together in the afternoon and then he <br/>
came home and built Thomas track with the boys.  Dd and I played <br/>
some more of our on-going Uno game together.  (We&#39;re playing until <br/>
one of us hits 10,000).  <br/>
<br/>
Two of the kids helped me make manicotti and salad for supper and <br/>
they played computer games while dh and I watched a movie in the <br/>
evening.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Today the boys played on their computers for much of the morning and <br/>
dd played her new pokemon ruby game. <br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon we went to the library, made a quick trip to Wal-<br/>
mart to buy supplies for girls&#39; club which we hold in our house <br/>
tomorrow, and then went to a playground in a different town.  The <br/>
kids had never been to this playground.  They love it when I find <br/>
new ones to go to.  This one had two really tall sliding boards, a <br/>
nice treat for them because neither of the parks in our town has any <br/>
more than a tiny rickety sliding board.  It also had a merry go <br/>
round (that everyone sits on and one person runs around in a circle <br/>
to make them go fast), seesaws and monkey bars.  No swings out for <br/>
the summer yet.  They had me push them really fast and they <br/>
pretended that it was a time machine.  As soon as it slowed down on <br/>
their own they got off and pretended it was a different time period <br/>
and that they were kings and queens.  <br/>
<br/>
We also found a tree that had fallen over and you could see it&#39;s <br/>
roots.  We found some coal and shale--the kind where you can split <br/>
the rocks in half rather easily.  We spent awhile looking for <br/>
fossils and although we found a few little things that &quot;maybe&quot; were <br/>
fossils, we didn&#39;t find any good ones.  <br/>
<br/>
We went to my mil&#39;s for dinner and I came home because someone&#39;s <br/>
coming to fix our furnace soon.  They are still there, helping her <br/>
fill eggs for an easter egg hunt her church is having.  <br/>
<br/>
The movie Blank Check is coming on tv tonight and the kids want to <br/>
watch that.  <br/>

They were helpful and inspiring.  It does seem like most people that <br/>
replied had younger kids.  I think they are much easier to unschool <br/>
because play is the best teacher.  But when they get a bit older and <br/>
approaching teens, I think I may need to provide more direction.  I <br/>
may be wrong.</div>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the exact opposite of how I felt when I discovered unschooling.<br/>
I thought, &quot;Yeah, teens can unschool because they can already read and<br/>
do basic arithmetic.  They can pursue their passions!  But little kids -<br/>
they need to be taught how to read, write, add, subtract, multiply and<br/>
divide.&quot;  I thought I&#39;d be strictly homeschooling until they learned<br/>
those &quot;skills&quot; and then let them follow their dreams.  Luckily, I<br/>
realized younger kids can unschool too.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072862061">I was not going to contribute to this thread b/c I thought  &quot;our days<br/>
are never typical and we don&#39;t really do anything much&quot;.  Then I thought<br/>
about what we did yesterday and realized this is the essence of<br/>
unschooling and I love it when I realize that. *We* consists of me and<br/>
dh and 3 kids, daughter age 10, son age 8 and baby boy age 1.<br/>
<br/>
So, yesterday we big folks and the wee one were up around 6:30 (not my<br/>
choice). We put the sap on to boil that we&#39;ve been collecting from our<br/>
maples. This boiled all day and we had a quart adn a half of syrup by<br/>
bedtime. The others got up around 8 or so.  We ate, messed around, read<br/>
a little (Kaleigh undoubtedly did some creative thing in here, I can&#39;t<br/>
begin to keep up with her on that score) and got dressed then had to go<br/>
grocery shopping before a dentist appointment for the two older ones.<br/>
The plan was to get done with the store and then have the baby fall<br/>
asleep on the way to the dentist.  It worked and we got there early so<br/>
we sat in the car for a while and played a word association game which<br/>
led to discussions on definitions and geography.  When Lochie woke up we<br/>
went in and read a magazine about birds before the kids went to their<br/>
respective chairs.  This was X-ray day so they got to see what their<br/>
teeth are doing beneath the surface and I got to ask about<br/>
development(health and technology).<br/>
<br/>
When we got home we had lunch and then went for a walk up the rpoad to<br/>
get the mail (1/2 mile or so each way).  Actually, Kaleigh and I walked<br/>
and Cerid biked.  On the way he was seeing how slowly he could bike and<br/>
explained to me that it is hard to go in a straight line when you are<br/>
going that slowly because the wheel on a bike is kind of like a<br/>
gyroscope and the speed is what keeps it on track(physics and exercise!<br/>
I had never thought about *why* it is hard to bike slowly, it just is!<br/>
Then Kaleigh told me that she thinks that the pile of unusual poop that<br/>
we saw on the day before is actually droppings from a Ruffled<br/>
Grouse(biology and physiology).  She came to this conclusion because she<br/>
found another pile of it in front of the house where we had see the<br/>
grouse a few days before.  (are there guide books for animal droppings?)<br/>
<br/>
The kids then played outside while I tried to figure out how to rig up a<br/>
clothes line(conservation and engineering).  They were using Kaleighs<br/>
kit of photoreactive fabric dyes (art and light)  They also checked out<br/>
their respective perrenial gardens and compared who had the most stiuff<br/>
coming up and why (botany and weather).  Then some friends stopped in to<br/>
play for a few hours.  They were mostly outside but got silly inside and<br/>
took photos of eachother looking like ants.  DH came home early adn<br/>
Cerid helped him dig a trench to drain the water that is collecting in<br/>
the yard from the melting snow (hydrodynamics).<br/>
<br/>
DH took the two older ones to fencing class.  When they got home we<br/>
played some math games before bed (from the Mensa math pack and a game<br/>
book).  This just happened because the cards were in reach when we were<br/>
snuggling on the livingroom floor.  We read a little before bed too.<br/>
<br/>
That really was a typical go-with-the-flow kind of day for us.  We have<br/>
some things on certain days (fencing, karate, sign language singing and<br/>
skiing).  The rest is all as it comes.  Hope this helps.  I have found<br/>
as I&#39;ve had to write those silly reports for the school, that it really<br/>
does help to do this once in a while and write it down.  I feel so often<br/>
like we don&#39;t grab every opportunity for leaarning buit then when I look<br/>
at this I think we&#39;re doing OK.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Thanks for all your posts.<br/>
<br/>
They were helpful and inspiring.  It does seem like most people that <br/>
<br/>
replied had younger kids.  I think they are much easier to unschool <br/>
<br/>
because play is the best teacher. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have kids who weren&#39;t in school.   They&#39;re 16, 14 and 11 now.  <br/>
Play is a great teacher at any age.  <br/>
<br/>
The older kids are playing on the internet, playing games way too complicated <br/>
for me to play, playing at being medieval (and doing research to support that <br/>
hobby)...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But when they get a bit older and approaching teens, I think I may need to <br/>
provide more direction.  I may be wrong. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The sooner you stop providing direction in the traditional sense and change <br/>
your own point of view to see the learning in everything, the less you will <br/>
think that older kids (who can read and are mobile and can find their own <br/>
resources easily) will need your direction to continue to learn naturally.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
They need encouragement and freedom and respect and materials.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i have an almost 11yo girl, a &quot;tween&quot;.  I haven&#39;t shared a typical day, but <br/>
it varies wildly. She spent the K through half of fourth in public school, <br/>
and has spent more than a year home with me. I don&#39;t know what you mean by <br/>
&quot;providing direction&quot;, but I am amazed how much my dd has taken the lead in <br/>
her own interests. As I back off, she figures out what she needs herself and <br/>
goes for it. This unschooling stuff really works! When she wanted to learn <br/>
geometry, I helped where she asked. When she wanted to learn to play guitar, <br/>
she found chords online and printed them out, and asked her dad who has the <br/>
musical ability in this family. She implements her own structure, then lets <br/>
go what doesn&#39;t work for her. Trust and have faith!<br/>

wall-hanging or pillow top. I think it will only end up being 14&quot; square. <br/>

direction. But lots of times I have had to alter the direction I *thought* <br/>
we were heading, as interests change and mature and develop. I&#39;ve had to <br/>
think harder about what things might be cool and interesting to strew <br/>
around. I&#39;ve had to be available to have some truly incredible <br/>
conversations. And I&#39;ve had to drive. Drive, drive, drive. It&#39;s all good.<br/>

called Animal Signatures. There must be others out there. The Natural <br/>
History Museum here has a display of animal droppings - a hit with the <br/>
kids, big and small.<br/>
<br/>
We were excited last summer to find some unusual poop on the path to the <br/>
beach at our cottage. Luckily we had our book and were thrilled to find out <br/>
it was from a bobcat. Some of our neighbours have seen them around.<br/>
