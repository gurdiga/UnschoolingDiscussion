<div id="ygrps-yiv-241816381">A big Thank you to everyone who had something to share with me! I am <br/>
excited to look into all of it. I am happy to be a part of this <br/>
wonderful site, and have been enjoying all the posts for a while <br/>
now. It is so refreshing to be a part of something, where I don&#39;t <br/>
have to explain myself or my reasons for doing what I am doing. I <br/>
really want to get my husband on board, but he just does not &quot;get <br/>
it&quot; yet. I have tried explaining unschooling to him, but it seems <br/>
like we never finish a conversation. He seems to like what the kids <br/>
are doing, and I always point out to him what the kids learned on <br/>
thier own, but every once in a while he will &quot;test&quot; the kids by <br/>
asking them questions he thinks they should know the answer to. It <br/>
really frustrates our 11 year old. Like the Algebra thing, my <br/>
husband thinks that my son needs to know all this other stuff before <br/>
he can learn about Algebra, and Jesse is just &quot;curious&quot;. I asked my <br/>
husband to explain it to him, but he won&#39;t because he does not know <br/>
how to, and feels he needs to know &quot;more&quot; before he tackles it. I <br/>
don&#39;t blame my husband for being the way he is, he has not had the <br/>
time to learn about unschooling, or even the desire. He just leaves <br/>
it up to me. Once in a while though, he feels the need to &quot;see&quot; what <br/>
they are doing, and I wish I could get him to stop. (him and <br/>
everyone else in my family). <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I just purged a little too much! Sometimes I do that. <br/>
Anyway, thanks again for the response. I look forward to chatting <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447899222">Thank you so much for that. I actually had seen something about that <br/>
on the net, and forgot about it. I will bring it up to my husband, I <br/>
agree that it might just do the trick! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406664154">As matematicians say, &quot;There are three kinds of mathematicians; those <br/>
who can count and those who can&#39;t.&quot;  Mathematics is not sequential.  <br/>
Mathematical thinking doesn&#39;t even require numbers.<br/>
