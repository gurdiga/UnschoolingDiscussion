<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do bake pretty regularly, but not often cakes. The other night I made a<br/>
&gt; chocolate cake with peanut butter icing, and both girls came running out<br/>
&gt; asking who&#39;s birthday it was. I  told them nobodies. They said it had to<br/>
&gt; be somebodies or I wouldn&#39;t be making a cake. So we put candles on the<br/>
&gt; cake and sang Happy Birthday to Mr. Nobody! It was fun.<br/>

My cub scout den wanted to have a party next month, but they&#39;re all at the<br/>
valentines is GROSSSSS stage, so we&#39;ve having an un-birthday party!  Should<br/>
be fun.  Can you believe several of these kids (mostly 7 yr olds) had never<br/>
heard of an un-birthday?<br/>
