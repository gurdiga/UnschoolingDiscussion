<div id="ygrps-yiv-477525241">In social interaction, many people with Asperger&#39;s syndrome demonstrate gaze <br/>
avoidance and may actually turn away at the same moment as greeting another. <br/>
The children I have known do desire interaction with others but have trouble <br/>
knowing how to make it work. They are, however, able to learn social skills much <br/>
like you or I would learn to play the piano. <br/>
