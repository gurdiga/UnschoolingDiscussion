<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This whole response was so well written, thank you for sharing it. This <br/>
&gt; paragraph in particular, hit a nerve of mine. When Kass &Kree were in the <br/>
&gt; last <br/>
&gt; class in which they attended school, at parent teacher conference, their <br/>
&gt; teacher <br/>
&gt; went on and on about Kree&#39;s inability to complete the timed multiplication <br/>
&gt; quizes. She had gone so far as to give her a &quot;D&quot; on her report card. Kree <br/>
&gt; sat <br/>
&gt; with me in tears and was basically falling apart as the teacher went on and <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; about the importance of knowing these tables. So, being my usual self, I <br/>
&gt; turned <br/>
&gt; to Kree. &quot;Honey, please don&#39;t cry. If you want to work on them at home I <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; help you.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ms. White chimed in with, &quot;Kree, you are very lucky to have a mom who is so <br/>
&gt; understanding. Mrs. Hill you wouldn&#39;t believe how many parents I get who <br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; punish their kids for what I just told you.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Knowing this woman enough to know she was trying to tell me I should be more <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; upset and consider punishment, I turned back to Kree.  &quot;But if you just <br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; ready, that&#39;s ok too, because these grades mean nothing.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ms. White&#39;s eyebrows rose and she asked Kree to leave so we could &quot;talk&quot;. I <br/>
&gt; said, &quot;No, this is Kree&#39;s education, so it&#39;s important that she know where <br/>
&gt; we <br/>
&gt; each stand. And from where I stand, you haven&#39;t done such a hot job. If, in <br/>
&gt; fact, these timed quizzes have been something Kree has been having <br/>
&gt; difficulty <br/>
&gt; with, why would you wait until now, at report card time to tell me about it. <br/>
&gt; You <br/>
&gt; are well aware of how much time I spend with the girls and with the amount <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; homework you send home, I wonder what it is you do all day in class. <br/>
&gt; Therefore, to assume I would be upset in any way with my child, you go too <br/>
&gt; far in your <br/>
&gt; assumptions. I don&#39;t blame her for not doing well on your silly quizzes, but <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; do blame you for putting far too much importance on such a trivial thing. So <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will work on them with her, if she wants to, but if she has been too <br/>
&gt; traumatized by the whole thing, why would I further traumatize her at home?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Her answer: &quot;Because if she doesn&#39;t get them down, she will be held back.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was shocked. &quot;Over the ability to quickly state times tables, you would <br/>
&gt; risk a childs psyche and love of learning? Not the fact that she knows them, <br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; that she isn&#39;t fast enough to write them? How pathetic is that?&quot; With that I <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; asked Kree to get her sister from the swings just outside of their <br/>
&gt; classroom. <br/>
&gt; My question was retorical, so when she began to answer, she got the &#39;talk to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the hand sign, cuz these ears aren&#39;t listening&#39; sign. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Huh!!! It was the following week I took them out of school to live a life of <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; peace and joy.<br/>

math. After a year of pointless timed tests, Julian believed he was stupid, <br/>
especially in math.<br/>
<br/>
When he left, we told him that unless he wanted to, he never had to memorize <br/>
the times tables. It seemed so stupid to destroy a child&#39;s belief in himself <br/>
over information that could be carried around on something the size of a credit <br/>
card.<br/>
<br/>
We read Math Phobia, by Marilyn Burns, that talks about how math is taught in <br/>
schools, and she talks about timed tests, and the ongoing nightmares kids <br/>
have about them. Great book.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to win the timed math test races in the additon tables. I <br/>
would get the little eraser for winning or placing second.<br/>
<br/>
We moved into times tables and I won the first two times. But on <br/>
the second test, the teacher graded it after I whizzed through it <br/>
only to find that I had failed it. (You were only allowed to miss one <br/>
or two.) The two tables being tested together were zeros and <br/>
ones. I got them backwards: 1x4=1 and Ox4=4  This error in my <br/>
memorization (obviously a total lack of understanding) made me <br/>
lose not only the test, but the eraser in front of the whole class.<br/>
<br/>
I never recovered. From second grade on I had math tutors. In <br/>
high school, I took Algebra II and midway through the year the <br/>
teacher suggested I drop the course to protect my GPA for <br/>
college.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until homeshooling my oldest and using Miquon math <br/>
that I actually *understood* what times tables were. I kid you not. <br/>
I also &quot;got&quot; fractions for the first time too. As an adult. In my <br/>
thirties. Is that pathetic or what? All from my shaken confidence <br/>
that math was magic and I couldn&#39;t ever understand it.<br/>
