  About the swimming. <br/>
<br/>
  Sandra, I think that is probably pretty on target.   It was a way to get kids <br/>
  to &quot;take a break&quot;  for the adults convenience<br/>

I&#39;m SURE that cakes don&#39;t &quot;fall&quot; because of children&#39;s running through the <br/>
house. They fall for other reasons. Mom&#39;s hour or so of peace and quiet <br/>
resulted from cake-baking. &quot;If the cake falls,  it&#39;ll be your fault. Then you <br/>
can&#39;t have any cake!&quot; <br/>

<br/>
OH! I hadn&#39;t even thought of that one.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone who ever told me that story, it seems, lived in a solid-floor house. <br/>
 Dirt, or concrete.  And they learned to bake cakes in iron woodstoves.  <br/>
RIGHT, like a kid running can shake THAT, even on a wooden floor.<br/>
<br/>
Bad thing is, the moms sometimes really believed it because someone told THEM <br/>
it was true.<br/>
<br/>
What is with people, and doing without thinking?<br/>
