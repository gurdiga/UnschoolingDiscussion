<div id="ygrps-yiv-558232049">I agree with your about attitute about learning, I am trusting my instincts <br/>
and figuring that my guys are inquisitive human beings that will want to <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to be as unstructured as I can possibly let myself be. I am in <br/>
Louisiana and have found that the laws are very homeschool friendly here. I <br/>
can register as a private school and they leave me alone after that. Yipee!<br/>
<br/>
The law here is that when the boys are 7 years old, they must go to school.I <br/>
have a while then. (the law here says that they have to attend school from <br/>
7-17 years old)<br/>
<br/>
Since my kids taught themselves the ABC&#39;s and are in the process of teaching <br/>
themselves to count(can get into the 30&#39;s now), I&#39;m not too worried.<br/>
<br/>
I like the thing that Holt says, Fish swim, Birds fly, Man learns.(I think <br/>
that&#39;s the quote)<br/>
