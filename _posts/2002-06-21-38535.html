<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903464517">Hi all:<br/>
<br/>
While researching new historical novels (of all things), I happened upon<br/>
this study. My apologies if someone has already posted it. I&#39;ve been too<br/>
busy to keep up with my email groups for several weeks:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The main gene that influences Attention Deficit Disorder is a relatively<br/>
&gt; recent evolutionary leap that happened during known human hunter/gatherer<br/>
&gt; times, according to internationally known ADHD author and psychotherapist Thom<br/>
&gt; Hartmann. The latest study, just published in the January 8, 2002 edition of<br/>
&gt; the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United<br/>
&gt; States of America, found that while most of the gene that encodes for novelty<br/>
&gt; seeking and other behaviors is about 300,000 years old, the variation of it<br/>
&gt; that is carried by most people with ADHD is only 30,000 to 50,000 years old.<br/>
&gt; And they found that it was a positive adaptation, meaning it was useful in the<br/>
&gt; history of humans.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774615791">Does anybody else beleive that genetics is a great way of passing the buck?  A<br/>
really neat quote comes from a rather sinister but competant hypnotherapist named<br/>
Richard Bandler who wrote in Frogs to Princes (Pg. 32), 1979, Real People Press<br/>
(ISBN 0-911226-18-4):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is something now that they are imposing upon children called &quot;learning<br/>
disabilities.&quot;  Many of these &quot;learning disabilities&quot; are really functions of the<br/>
educational system.  For example I was given a bunch of children who fell in the<br/>
classification of &quot;Crossed Hemispheres&quot; and they told me that this was something<br/>
that existed in the world.  They wanted me to find out if there was any difference<br/>
between these children and the rest of them, given accessing cues and so on.  What I<br/>
discovered was they were all children who were trying to spell auditorily.  ...  I<br/>
ask the children what they were doing and they said &quot;Sounding the word out,&quot; because<br/>
they were taught to spell phonetically.  You can&#39;t even spell &quot;Phonetics&quot;<br/>
Phonetically!&quot;<br/>

<h4>The Resourceful Homeschooler</h4>

 </span></blockquote>You know Google. I was looking for a writer named Dale Smith who is supposed<br/>
to live in the Portland, OR area. One link was for a college professor&#39;s<br/>
book release, and I wound up on that college PR site. Of course, the study<br/>
immediately caught my attention. I still haven&#39;t tracked down Dale Smith, of<br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
The person who told me they like Dale Smith&#39;s work was selling a phonics<br/>
reading program at the booth next to mine at the Washington Homeschooler<br/>
Assoiciation&#39;s conference. He seemed like a nice man, but he was clearly<br/>
nonplussed by the very idea of unschooling. I always follow up on these<br/>
suggestions because you never know where a good idea is going to come from.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe if he were to look Dale Smith up on Google he would get a glimmer of <br/>
how unschooling works (UNLESS he just clicked on the one most obvious link an <br/>
didn&#39;t touch anything else).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger I dreaded needing to look anything up in a dictionary if I <br/>
was in a hurry.  It wasn&#39;t because I would take too long to find the word--I <br/>
could find it in seconds.  The problem was that I couldn&#39;t NOT read what I <br/>
saw on the neighboring pages, and I couldn&#39;t NOT read the definitions of the <br/>
most interesting pictures I saw on the way there.  And sometimes those led to <br/>
looking something else up, or going to the Indo-European appendix (American <br/>
Heritage has been my fave since I was fifteen).  <br/>
<br/>
I hear my kids hesitating when I say &quot;Let&#39;s look it up on Google!&quot;  They want <br/>
the five second answer sometimes, not the &quot;OH MY GOSH!  Come look at THIS!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes the twenty minute answer is fun for them too.<br/>
<br/>
Dictionaries were less attention-sucking after I knew more.  It just took a <br/>
decade or so for all the pages to have been glanced at so I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
open it up and say &quot;I didn&#39;t know THIS was here!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That will never happen with google.<br/>
I&#39;m doomed to it taking me twenty minutes to look anything up.<br/>
<br/>
I also write reports sometimes!  We wanted t find a picture of Helen Keller, <br/>
and I filled a document file up with ten photos and several quotes, in <br/>
chronological order, from seven or ten websites, for Holly to look at the <br/>
next morning.<br/>
<br/>
What was that about ADHD? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are we surprised that schools are 300 thousand years behind the times (or 30 <br/>
million or whatever it was)?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem in our world is the concept of discipline (relating in <br/>
all directions--land ownership, slavery, women&#39;s legal status through the <br/>
ages, powers of kings) and that&#39;s So much bigger politically speaking than <br/>
even the English speaking &quot;Western World,&quot; so looking at that is daunting to <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
So I settle for the little models in freedom and respect which are afforded <br/>
by changing our relationships with our children from the cultural norm of <br/>
them being obedient without question to their being partners in exploration.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s a  column bubbling up to the surface.  <br/>
<br/>
I resisted watching Gone with the Wind my whole life until Friday.  I&#39;m 2/3 <br/>
through (the point where so many have famously fallen asleep in the past, I <br/>
guess), but thanks to the marvels of modern technology I didn&#39;t have to snore <br/>
in a crowded theatre during the depression.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I saw it AFTER I was aware of the sociological take on the role of <br/>
the southern U.S. in western civilization, and that is that they were trying <br/>
in many ways to re-create feudal Europe in a post-Renaissance world.    <br/>
Watching it through those eyes helped mesee things I would have ignored if I <br/>
had been familiar with the movie.   And it helps explain some of the <br/>
mysterious power of religion in so many people from that part of the country <br/>
too.  <br/>
<br/>
Before my ancestors were all Texans they were from the SE, not further north <br/>
than Virginia, except for ONE Yankee (brace yourselves).  My maternal <br/>
grandmother was from a second union.  Her mother&#39;s respectable Texas husband, <br/>
the father of her brothers, had died.  Her mother married again and had two <br/>
girls.  Their father was from *Michigan.*   <br/>
<br/>
To them that was as foreign as Boston! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
His last name was Houghton.  Turns out that&#39;s a prominent name in Michigan, <br/>
and I bet they never knew where he had gone.  &quot;Black sheep,&quot; my granny said; <br/>
&quot;ran away to Texas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s why I can&#39;t use Google without learning something different, <br/>
because I learned a long time ago to use distraction to my advantage.  Maybe <br/>
ADHD is a great HELP to unschooling because it keeps someone from finishing <br/>
the one thing they intended to do and then needing a prompt or permission or <br/>
an invitation to jump track to something related, or opposite.<br/>

You could say &quot;I don&#39;t think so&quot; (or &quot;I think so&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know) and then <br/>
write it on a list on the wall.  And whoever finds the answer writes it up <br/>
there and checks it off. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might be five seconds&#39; worth LATER.<br/>
