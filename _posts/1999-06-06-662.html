his is so true! That&#39;s why unschooling is so wonderful! It gives<br/>
children a chance to take control of their education (life). I believe that<br/>
children need lots of time to just &quot;think&quot;. I always wonder when I see my<br/>
child playing in the sandbox, or pulling weeds in the garden, what they&#39;re<br/>
&quot;thinking about&quot;. Maybe they&#39;re trying to &quot;figure out the world&quot;, or<br/>
wondering where their life &quot;fits in&quot; in the grand scheme.<br/>
School takes that away. Children who go to school are always so &quot;busy&quot;.<br/>
School all day, homework, extra-curricular activities... When do they have<br/>
time to THINK?!<br/>
<br/>
I agree! I spend every day of my THINKING. It&#39;s strange to me that some<br/>
people do not constantly think -- I can&#39;t imagine it. Lots of times during<br/>
the day I&#39;ll get up and start pacing around the house. It helps me sort<br/>
things out in my mind -- and it&#39;s good exersise too, hehe. ;-) ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>
