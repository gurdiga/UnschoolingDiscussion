<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813396941">Sharon, I tried your greens recipe for dinner tonight.<br/>
I really liked it! This recipe was not in any of my cookbooks. <br/>
I think the sugar or honey adds a certain something special.<br/>
I used organic collards from Wild Oats.<br/>
I sprinkled a bit of balsamic vinegar on the greens after cooking. <br/>
Flavorful, juicy, tender, very good. <br/>
Dh liked it too, but my kids are still insecure with new foods, especially when they are green!<br/>
Anyway, thanks for sharing it.<br/>
<br/>

  Thanks Julie<br/>

  About 2lb ( a mess) fresh, WASHED, locally grown<br/>
  collards (local may be the difference), cut up with<br/>
  most of the thick center vein removed. Cover with<br/>
  water in a pot big enough to hold them all, add a glop<br/>
  of vegetable oil (fat back or bacon  is<br/>
  traditional....but so is arteriosclerosis), I use<br/>
  canola. Salt, black pepper, and about 1 quarter cup of<br/>
  sugar (honey has a nice flavor, too...bet your thyme<br/>
  honey would be good and would make it yours). Stir it<br/>
  all together and boil, reduce heat, simmer until they<br/>
  are how as tender as you prefer.  I like mine with<br/>
  vinegar (various kinds) DH likes his with corn-bread<br/>
  crumbled or broken in chunks and salsa and LOTS of<br/>
  Seminole Seasoning (a salt substitute with salt in<br/>
  it)or hot sauce and Seminole Seasoning. Roy, and his<br/>
  brothers, and most kids, like theirs, as is.  Left<br/>
  overs can be frozen in the juice and zapped later, or<br/>
  heated on the stove top.  Old country folks save the<br/>
  pot liquor (the juice) and drink it as a beverage. <br/>
  Collards are high in everything, including calcium,<br/>
  iron, anti-oxidants, B vitamins, ruffage (give some<br/>
  folks gas, but it is the same people who get gas with<br/>
  brocoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and all the rest) and<br/>
  other good stuff I don&#39;t really know about...a little<br/>
  K and ????<br/>
<br/>
  Adrian had a good appetite! and secure enough to be<br/>
  willing to try new foods. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285904085">Red Chard and Swiss Chard are yummy too.  They don&#39;t need to cook quite<br/>
as long as collards.<br/>
