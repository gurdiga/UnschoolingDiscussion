<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296977543"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have friends on our block, our kids are friends too. They play<br/>
&gt;together <br/>
&gt;all the time. The difference is that they don&#39;t try to convert us and<br/>
&gt;we <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t try to convert them. And we don&#39;t use every little thing that<br/>
&gt;comes <br/>
&gt;our way to shove our beliefs in each other&#39;s faces. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tolerance and understanding, eh, that&#39;s the ticket! No one here is going to<br/>
change their minds about evolution, abortion, or religion. This isn&#39;t a forum<br/>
of unthinking sheep who are easily swayed. I would venture to guess that most<br/>
of us here have quite a few years of email lists and usenet experience, the<br/>
kind of experience that has proven the futility of rehashing these subjects to<br/>
the point where the real point of the list gets lost in acrimony. So, let&#39;s<br/>
move on and quit with the proselytizing. Can&#39;t we get back to support for<br/>
unschooling?<br/>
