<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452083293">&quot;You don&#39;t have to live there to get it just visit there web site and <br/>
send<br/>
them an email or call. We&#39;ve been members for 3 years and have never <br/>
even<br/>
been there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a center in Fort Walton Beach Florida that is only $45 per <br/>
year for a family. You can call them, order your membership on the <br/>
phone and get access to hundreds of science museums (like OMSI) <br/>
nationwide all year.  It&#39;s the Emerald Coast Science Center if anyone <br/>
wants one.:)  They&#39;ll tell you who they&#39;re affiliated with so check <br/>
before you buy.<br/>
