<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888818805">Hi Mel,<br/>
I&#39;m from NY.  I think the curriculum strictness depends on where you live.  <br/>
i just copy the appropriate grade information from the world book of <br/>
knowledge for my ihips and only have to say we covered &quot;x&quot; number of hours <br/>
of a subject, they reached 100% of expectations (i expect them to unschool). <br/>
  We can test them at home (IOWA test provided free by school) starting in <br/>
5th grade.  I&#39;m even ask to mark days present and absent.  Where else would <br/>
they be?  As long as they&#39;re on this planet I&#39;ll mark them present.<br/>
Where is Newfield?  I don&#39;t feel like hunting down the map.<br/>
