<div id="ygrps-yiv-315587725">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I went to my unschooling discussion group this past Sunday night and heard <br/>
something that so touched me and wanted to share it. It has probably been <br/>
presented before in this fashion or something similiar, and I am sure I have <br/>
heard it, but sometimes things just grab you as this did.<br/>
<br/>
Someone had brought up how they sometimes are in the company of other <br/>
homeschoolers who do &quot;school at home&quot; and they will ask her . . .&quot;you mean, <br/>
you aren&#39;t doing fractions yet?&quot; or some other similiar innane comment. And <br/>
she never really knows what to say and always feels sort of odd about it. <br/>
Another person there gave a great explanation that goes like this. . . she <br/>
took out a large sheet of blank paper, and said this blank area of the paper <br/>
represents all of the knowledge or material out there available to learn <br/>
about, and if we are being realistic, this paper would only be a small <br/>
portion of it. Then she put a dot on the paper and said, this dot represents <br/>
what schools(or some other curriculumn) have deemed important to learn. And <br/>
then she said we, as unschoolers, just have decided that we will learn a <br/>
different dot. <br/>
<br/>
I just so love this. . . because the young people in my family get to choose <br/>
which dot they are interested in learning about. And they can change that dot <br/>
at anytime they choose as well. And I can choose my own dot. So here&#39;s to <br/>
choosing our own dots!! :)<br/>
<br/>
lovemary<br/>
If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then <br/>
make a change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349285211">I like the dots story.<br/>
<br/>
When I first saw &quot;dots&quot; I was thinking of the grid game built on dots.   And <br/>
with that model still in my head when you said &quot;piece of paper,&quot; I have <br/>
another idea.<br/>
<br/>
School (at or away from home) tries to claim that their &quot;dot&quot; is the <br/>
information people need to succeed.  And they tie it together, in most <br/>
repetitive ways, from year to year, but rarely do they cross-reference <br/>
(science to language, history to music, math to history, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers, meanwhile come on dots randomly and connect them to other random <br/>
dots, and our kids end up with a huge web of connections.  Holes?  Surely, <br/>
but if you got a  hundred of the best-educated mainstream kids and compared <br/>
what they know, ALL would have a hole or ten compared to what the others <br/>
happened to have learned.  And it is impossible to separate what a bright kid <br/>
learned in school from what he came across and connected on his own after (or <br/>
during) school.<br/>
<br/>
It is not measurable, regardless of the joy some take in &quot;standardized <br/>
tests.&quot;   All you can measure is how well a person does on that test--not how <br/>
much more he knows, now how psychic he is, or how his deductive powers work <br/>
(eliminate the two worst, make a best guess--the whole column won&#39;t be &quot;B&quot; so <br/>
following five &quot;B&quot; answers, go with the other if you can&#39;t decide...).<br/>
<br/>
If the grid of all possibilities is the model, the schools stay in the corner <br/>
of school-requirements, what will be on the SAT test.  Our kids are out <br/>
riding horses or collecting action figures or cooking or building tents or <br/>
teaching embroidery, without regard for the test.  Which group will have the <br/>
greater bulk of information?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126759082">I too loved the dots story, thank you for sharing it, and I loved Sandra&#39;s <br/>
response. Both came at a good time here as all those standardized test scores <br/>
are coming in. I have never tested my kids, never will. But this morn a good <br/>
friend emailed me to say that his son (only child) who is a public school 2nd <br/>
grader just got back his standardize test scores. He scored in the top 3% in <br/>
the nation. (you knew I was going to say that right. No one ever emails if <br/>
their kid is in the bottom 3%!) Top 1% in math. My friend says, as he often <br/>
does, that his child is a lot smarter than him and he is only in 2nd grade. <br/>
That is so stupid. Another homeschool friend I have just emailed me with his <br/>
high schoolers test scores too. And he told me how his son just finished a <br/>
book for their school district explaining what they would be doing next year. <br/>
It is 3000 pages long! <br/>
<br/>
How nice it is too hear from like minded people. Thank you for being here. <br/>
