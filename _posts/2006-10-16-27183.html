<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490532601">that I didn&#39;t take the opportunity to &#39;meet&#39; most of you when you were practically in my backyard<br/>
(St. Louis, Mo).....  I&#39;m a lurker for the most part.. but you all have a made such a difference in my family and in our unschooling life.. just want to say thanks to everyone....esp to Joyce, Sandra, Pam & Ren for helping me to think and examine...even when it&#39;s hurt a bit..... yup.. it&#39;s been good.....even when I&#39;ve passed thru some tight spots. I&#39;m involved in a rather closed minded hm&#39;school group at the moment, because it&#39;s the only group around and my 11 yo dd really craves company..dang it..ha.. I&#39;ve sent links to this group, to Joyce and Sandra&#39;s sites.. wondering what they will do with that... .. and if they&#39;ll still let us hang out....but I am finding it harder and harder to let opportunities pass me by these days... guess I&#39;m getting old enough to be brave..... thanks again...Julie in MO~~aka~~farmgirl<br/>
