I received this virus warning Monday evening, May 28th. I followed the<br/>
instructions and sure enough, my computer was infected. I&#39;ve got<br/>
anti-virus software McAffee and NORTON and it did not pick it up! Please<br/>
<br/>
read the<br/>
following carefully.   You may receive a second email from me from my<br/>
home computer if you are in that address book as well.  I have had<br/>
several people check their systems and they have found this.  Some were<br/>
in my address book and some were not.  Therefore, this seems to be quite<br/>
<br/>
widespread.  I don&#39;t know much about this type thing but thought you<br/>
should have the info.<br/>

 URGENT.  A VIRUS could be in your computer files now, dormant but will<br/>
 become active on June 1.  FOLLOW DIRECTIONS BELOW TO CHECK IF YOU HAVE<br/>
 IT AND TO REMOVE IT NOW.<br/>
<br/>
 It was brought to my attention yesterday that a virus is in circulation<br/>
<br/>
 via email. I looked for it and to my surprise I found it on mine.<br/>
Please<br/>
 follow the directions and remove it from yours TODAY!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 No Virus software can detect it.  It will become active on June 1,<br/>
2001.<br/>
 It might be too late by then. It wipes out all files and folders on the<br/>
<br/>
 harddrive. This virus travels thru E-mail and migrates to the<br/>
 &#39;C:&#92;windows&#92;command&#39; folder.  To find it and get rid of it off of<br/>
 your computer, do the following.<br/>
<br/>
 Go to the &quot;START&quot; button.<br/>
 Go to &quot;FIND&quot; or &quot;SEARCH&quot;<br/>
 Go to &quot;FILES & FOLDERS&quot;<br/>
 Make sure the find box is searching the &quot;C:&quot; drive.<br/>
 Type in: SULFNBK.EXE<br/>
 Begin search.<br/>
<br/>
 If it finds it, highlight it.<br/>
 Go to &#39;File&#39; and delete it.<br/>
 Close the find Dialog box<br/>
 Open the Recycle Bin<br/>
 Find the file and delete it from the Recycle bin<br/>
 You should be safe.<br/>
<br/>
 The bad part is: You need to contact everyone you have sent ANY E-mail<br/>
 to in the past few months. Many major companies have found this = virus<br/>
<br/>
on<br/>
 their  computers. Please help your friends !!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 DO NOT RELY ON YOUR ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE. McAFEE and NORTON CANNOT<br/>
DETECT  IT  BECAUSE IT DOES NOT BECOME A VIRUS UNTIL JUNE 1ST.<br/>
<br/>
 WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT OPEN THE FILE!!!</div>
