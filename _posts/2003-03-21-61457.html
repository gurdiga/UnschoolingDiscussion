<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015166621">Just had to write and say that I know Brianna Thomas, the person who had her <br/>
picture put on the cover of the book.<br/>
She is a wonderful, creative and vibrant young woman.She is a true <br/>
unschooler, and her entire family is a model for me in my journey to <br/>
unschool.<br/>
Brianna&#39;s mom is an inspiration to me and a very dear friend. <br/>
Congratulations Brianna!!!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks -- Nancy!  I actually have never met her, nor even spoken with <br/>
her on the phone (her entry came without a phone number!) though my <br/>
publisher tracked her down.<br/>
<br/>
But when we say her entry, we immediately knew -- &quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; Of <br/>
course, then we had to figure out how to get it on a bookcover! <br/>
(that&#39;s why there are professionals who do such things....)<br/>
<br/>
Please convey my thanks to Maureen as well.<br/>
