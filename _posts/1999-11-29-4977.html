&lt;SNIP&gt;  They have 7 attorneys who are licensed at last count to practice<br/>
in 11 states.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	They *say* they have a way around this. Can&#39;t remember the exact name.<br/>
Apparently, though, it ticks off the local judges.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;SNIP&gt;  half of what they have up on their website as hsing laws for<br/>
particular states is not accurate or is their own personal idea of what a<br/>
state law means and quite frequently way out in left field.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	That&#39;s true of their interpretation of VA laws. You&#39;d think they&#39;d at<br/>
least get it right in their home state. I doubt it&#39;s ignorance, though. I<br/>
think it&#39;s by design. Makes them--and their favored brand of<br/>
homeschooling-- sound more necessary.  <br/>
