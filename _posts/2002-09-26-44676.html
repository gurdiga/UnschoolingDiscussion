<div id="ygrps-yiv-33204774">Hi everyone,<br/>
 My name is Sharon and I am new to the list. I have been &quot;lurking&quot;<br/>
(sounds funny) and enjoying hearing the conversation. I hope that I am<br/>
not bringing in something that everyone already talked about. I was<br/>
reading a back newsletter from HEM. The topic for two months was a<br/>
Marilyn vos Savant the Guiness Book of World Records smartest person I<br/>
think it said.<br/>
When she was asked about homeschooling she felt that all of the<br/>
homeschooled children will fade into the sunset and become stay at home<br/>
parents.Of course homeschooling their kids...as if that is a terrible<br/>
thing. Maybe the kids loved it so much that they want to carry on the<br/>
fun.*grin*<br/>
 I was amazed  at her logic...and wondered what you all thought of it.I<br/>
can&#39;t see how merely being in public school is going to guarantee my<br/>
child a better chance at &quot;success&quot;.The illusive word we keep hearing now<br/>
that we have teens! <br/>
  I don&#39;t know of many homeschoolers that just stay home because they<br/>
usually go on to jobs or other learning experiences. They keep moving and<br/>
learning. But I have met lots of public school kids burned out with<br/>
school and life in general not having that gusto for learning. Many go on<br/>
to college but do not finish or do not use the degrees they aquire.<br/>
  Would love to hear what you all thought.<br/>
Also, I am wondering if you all are hearing as much as we are about<br/>
&quot;success&quot;. My teens keep hearing that unless they get a degree they will<br/>
not &quot;succeed&quot; and will amount to nothing since they won&#39;t get a high<br/>
paying job. Minimum wage is very feared it sounds like. What ever<br/>
happened to people liking what they do? Does ever teen choose a<br/>
profession based on money? I would much prefer my kids liking what they<br/>
do and living on less than doing something for the money and being<br/>
unhappy. That sounds so much like half of the folks I meet in stores,<br/>
shops and businesses.<br/>
  thanks for listening,<br/>
sharon<br/>

My thoughts are that maybe they, the PS&#39;ers that went on to college, have <br/>
an epiphany, and realize they have a choice to go or not, so they make <br/>
other plans. Probably for most of their pre-college lives, they were led to <br/>
believe there WAS NO other choice but TO go to college. Don&#39;t know where to <br/>
find it, but there&#39;s a book out there called, of all things, &quot;UNjobbing&quot;. I <br/>
haven&#39;t read it, but I&#39;ve heard of it, in fact, my wife may just have it <br/>
somewhere, not sure :-)<br/>

either is true.<br/>
<br/>
If home-schooling were institutionalized, half of the youthful potential of<br/>
Americans would go unfulfilled. Say that a bright young parent sacrifices a<br/>
rewarding career to stay at home and teach the children. When those children<br/>
grow up, would half of them (one parent from each married couple) also<br/>
sacrifice their potential to stay home and teach their own children? If so,<br/>
much of the result of home-schooling would be the creation of more<br/>
home-schooling parents for the next generation, and so on.<br/>
Maybe home-schoolers can justify this loss. If so, please write. I believe<br/>
that home-schooling is a noble experiment done for the right reasons, and I<br/>
hope to hear why it may prove to be a success.<br/>
<br/>
And her week-later response:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...Many home-schoolers described how well their kids are doing and their<br/>
high hopes for them, but almost no one addressed my concern that a large<br/>
percentage of the kids would never use their educations if they became<br/>

concert hall; great leaders would never be able to change society; brilliant<br/>
scientists would never have a shot at curing cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a question to ask yourself: Would you want to home-school your sons<br/>
and then watch them become home-schooling parents themselves instead of<br/>
having careers? This is a serious philosophical issue: If you stay at home<br/>
and teach your child rocket science, and he stays at home and teaches his<br/>
child rocket science, and he stays at home and teaches his child rocket<br/>
science, when does anyone ever become a rocket scientist? In short,<br/>
home-schooling is easy to recommend for certain individuals, but hard to<br/>
recommend for society...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She seems to have more of a social concern that homeschooling will draw<br/>
people out of society.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What ever<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Has it ever been that way? In &quot;olden&quot; times men did what their fathers did<br/>
or apprenticed with someone of the parents&#39; choosing. Even husbands were<br/>
often chosen with an eye towards being a good provider. (Or increasing the<br/>
bride&#39;s family&#39;s status ;-) Happiness was what you managed to make of it,<br/>
not a goal.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me that people have always been advised to follow the path of<br/>
security which translates into a stable job that pays well. It&#39;s just become<br/>
more streamlined these days with kids being handed lists of careers that<br/>
will need people in the next decade. (And there&#39;s probably an even greater<br/>
social motive there too, trying to discourage kids from careers that are<br/>
already glutted.)<br/>
<br/>
As much as people talk about putting happiness first I think it&#39;s always<br/>
been unadmittedly secondary to security. It&#39;s pretty hard for it to be<br/>
otherwise in a society that spends 12 years pounding home the idea of the<br/>
needing to spend childhood preparing for good careers as adults. Can you<br/>
imagine schools asking kids what their dreams are and saying the school is<br/>
there to help them acheive them? ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052867874">I think that Marilyn Von Savant has too limited an experience with homeschoolers as a whole, so her picture of what goes on is limited to those who isolate themselves somewhere with their children for 12 or so years, perhaps having contact with other hs.<br/>
<br/>
Her argument against hs is also an argument against stay at home moms etc.<br/>
<br/>
What she doesn&#39;t see is the number of homeschool parents who manage to combine career and hs, or who do serial careers, work,  homeschool, when the children are older and can remain at home work again.<br/>
<br/>
The brain drain exists not because half the populace doesn&#39;t work, but because too many children are shunted into jobs that are unmeaningful to them (ditch digging, the common refrence to a dead end job, are great positions for people who like to use their muscles as they think or dream up stories, ideas etc.).   It is immaterial whether the reason for the loss is finacial, or educational, or even motivational.  The loss exists. HS is the least of the causes, and probably is the best repair.  Learning to do what is meaningful to oneself, regrdless of the difficutlies of the task or the reward, is more likely to inspire the man or woman who cures the common cold (cancer, altzheimers etc etc.) than are the children who are shunted through the typical educational system, and told, repeatedly, if they don&#39;t make a particular cut of one kind or another (SAT&#39;s, tests of all sorts) that they are limited in what they can become.<br/>
<br/>
The person who cures a disease, finds a way for us to travel to a distant galaxy, proves or disproves that there is a TOE (theory of everything...forget the other acronym) will need to put in hour upon hour, most likely, of poorly funded, unreward work, till they reach their final goal. Studying old and new studies done by others, consulting with people who they may never meet in person,  pondering, experimenting, throwing it all out and trying a different path. doesn&#39;t that all sound rather unschooling to you?<br/>
<br/>
Most people can&#39;t schedule an idea or thought... 9am on tuesday July 12 I&#39;ll think of how to (fill in the blank)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  those are the thougths of this woman.<br/>
As far as true success.  I think for most of our lives, meaning our lives as humans not my own 44 years here....succes is either fame or fortune...because these are what stand out.  It is difficult to point to success as happiness because we never really know how someone else feels.  I don&#39;t know that success is what it is all about.  I am not even sure that happiness is the goal.  To me the goal is to have peace of mind about what you are doing...to feel it is worthwhile and that you, as a person are significant and matter to at least someone  else in the world.  Valued.<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490514125">This is so true.  <br/>
A more cynical me thinks that the real issue is keeping most of the population working for the minority... striving to become better, ie richer, dragging themselves to unfulfilling jobs, so that they never really succedd where it counts, inside.  <br/>
<br/>
Like I said, ditch digging isn&#39;t the issue, what the job is isn&#39;t the problem, it is feelilng that one is of value.<br/>
<br/>
And you are right, most children are made to feel as if learning was a job. Hmmmmmmm...and isn&#39;t one of the messages, do it whether you like it or not, whether you find it interesting or not, whether it bores you to tears or not because that is the future? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the real fear is enough kids will say, No,  I&#39;m not going to do this for you when it leaves me feeling like I was nothing more than a machine.   <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, if unschooling becomes popular enough,  workers will be saying to their bosses: I will do this because it has meaning to me, it is a worthwhile job, it accomplishes something for the world at large.  It produces something that is worth making.  It makes me feel good.<br/>

be well,<br/>

&lt;&lt; And you are right, most children are made to feel as if learning was a <br/>
job. Hmmmmmmm...and isn&#39;t one of the messages, do it whether you like it or <br/>
not, whether you find it interesting or not, whether it bores you to tears or <br/>
not because that is the future? <br/>

was stupid and pointless!  But instead of report cards, you start to get pay <br/>
checks and car payments and credit card payments and mortgage bills!<br/>

 I agree whole heartedly with your thoughts. We hope too that our<br/>
children will find the work that they will enjoy but that will be a help<br/>
to others. I wish that being a stay at home mom was valued more but I<br/>
guess it has to start somewhere and it seems to be in the homeschool<br/>
community. The very place that others looking in don&#39;t see profitable<br/>
solutions coming from. At least our children (the next generation) will<br/>
have a different vision.<br/>
  Don&#39;t worry Rachel Ann....I bet more readers this morning will be doing<br/>
what you have been doing! I know we are...*grin* The only difference is<br/>
we have beans and rice cooking(we&#39;re some of those veggies....*smile*)<br/>
but I hope we can share ideas anyway. It&#39;s all about our families and<br/>
children.<br/>
