<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286417649">I&#39;ve posted lots of my favorite kids quips before, so I won&#39;t bore folks by <br/>
posting them again.. But, while reading some of the folks have posted, I <br/>
recalled another one.  Actually, it was pretty sad, because it was the <br/>
misunderstanding of a grandson of a friend of my mother ( confusing huh.. lol) .. resulting <br/>
from his grandmother lying to him. ..<br/>
<br/>
 The kid was about 3, his grandmother told him that if he didnt take his <br/>
vitamins, his hair would fall out.  ( I know, ridiculous)    After meeting Landon, <br/>
who was about 6 mos old and totally bald, the little boy reprimanded me <br/>
firmly.  &quot;You need to give your baby more vitamins (shaking his little finger at <br/>
me)&quot;   Of course I had no idea what he was talking about til his Grandmother <br/>
told me about her vitamin taking ploy.   <br/>
