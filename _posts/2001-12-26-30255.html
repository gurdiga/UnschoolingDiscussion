&gt; He can&#39;t remember the simplest of things and to carry out everyday <br/>
&gt; tasks and he hates it when I remind him. I don&#39;t like reminding him <br/>
&gt; either. I&#39;ve basically told him it is up to him to make things <br/>
&gt; happen. I will help him organize things, but I can&#39;t make him do it <br/>
&gt; if he refuses to. <br/>

pressure.....Kids Are Worth It by Barbara Coloroso. I would also deschool and <br/>
unschooling will come.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;My mom said a very nice thing to me about a year ago. We were talking<br/>
&gt; &gt;about unschooling, and I said something about how it was great it was<br/>
&gt; &gt;that she&#39;d been able to be open and accepting of it ... and she said<br/>
&gt; &gt;something like, &quot;I really don&#39;t know about unschooling, and I&#39;ll not sure<br/>
&gt; &gt;how I&#39;d feel about anyone else doing it,  but I know that if you&#39;re doing<br/>
&gt; &gt;it,  it will work out well.&quot; The message I got was &quot;I have faith in<br/>
&gt; &gt;*you*.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The most important thing I got from my mother was her belief in me.  She <br/>
&gt; knew, and let me know that she knew, that I was capable of staying out of <br/>
&gt; trouble, getting out of trouble if I did get into some, and that I would <br/>
&gt; know when to ask for help.  That meant a lot to me and is something I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; tried to pass on to my kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Thinking back to my childhood and now w/ my relationship w/ my mother. <br/>

to the puzzle. Thank you.<br/>
