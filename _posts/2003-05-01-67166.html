<div id="ygrps-yiv-639830466">Thought I&#39;d let you all know I just finished booking rooms for South <br/>
Carolina Conference and found out ALL suites are already booked!!!! I <br/>
thought I was ahead of schedule for making our reservations but <br/>
obviously not!! Looks like a large turn out already??? OR maybe just <br/>
too few suites available??? Anyway, I look forward to the event as <br/>
well as the trip. I&#39;ve been reading Carschooling by Diane Flynn Keith <br/>
and got some great ideas I can&#39;t believe I never thought off!!<br/>

Well,,,, that got me on the ball.<br/>
<br/>
They still have regular rooms,  I just booked mine!  Mention the Live and<br/>
Learn Conference.  Otherwise they will say there are no rooms available.<br/>
