<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660674113">and I need help!  We have just begun our unschooling journey this<br/>
year <br/>
after burning out on three years of traditional homeschool.  I know <br/>
some of you would say I&#39;m not a &quot;true&quot; unschooler due to the fact<br/>
that <br/>
I just can&#39;t seem to let go of the math and language texts (ABeka).  <br/>
I&#39;ve let everything else fall to the wayside, but these are the two <br/>
that concern me the most (call me uptight!).<br/>
<br/>
The problem is in getting my ds to complete the given assignment <br/>
within a proper time frame.  He will literally take all day to do one <br/>
lesson in each (and he&#39;s not struggling, either....just extremely <br/>
unmotivated).  I have definitely noticed this in other areas of his <br/>
life too.....when told to tidy the kitchen, load/unload the <br/>
dishwasher, etc. it can literally take him HOURS!  He drives me<br/>
crazy! <br/>
The only time he will really hustle is if he knows he&#39;s going to miss <br/>
something if he doesn&#39;t complete his work, and even then it&#39;s a <br/>
struggle.  He is a great kid, very intelligent, but has this lazy, <br/>
unmotivated streak.<br/>
<br/>
I know some of you are going to tell me to throw the ABeka out the <br/>
window (believe me I&#39;ve wanted to at times) but I don&#39;t think I can<br/>
do <br/>
that yet!  <br/>
<br/>
Any other suggestions?  <br/>
<br/>
I am set to web only due to the copious volume of mail generated by <br/>
this list (always interesting, though!), so if you reply please send <br/>
to my email.<br/>
<br/>
Bless you all,<br/>
<br/>
