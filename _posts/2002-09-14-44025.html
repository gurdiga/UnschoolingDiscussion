<div id="ygrps-yiv-229346627">just finished one here- we liked it.<br/>
As a grown up person I enjoyed a slightly different time frame. There is<br/>
sooo much about the late 1800&#39;s..<br/>
Love, Jude<br/>
just Back from the local Cold Spring Village- where Laura would fit<br/>
right in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628901782">LOVED the Martha books (Laura&#39;s great grandmother -- a feisty, bonny Scottish lass in the 1700s).  The Charlotte books (Laura&#39;s grandma, growing up in fashionable Boston) were okay-ish, but there aren&#39;t nearly as many of them.  The Caroline books are great -- it follows her from about age five, and she has finally met Charles Ingalls, but there is no romance yet. The series hasn&#39;t continued any further, and I&#39;m curious to see how it will turn out!  (grin) The Rose books were interesting, seeing how Laura parented, but Rose surely did live a different lifestyle in the end (discusses her forays with alcohol and her divorce, if that matters to you or your child.  If it does, just skip the final one. I can&#39;t remember what your stance is, but I have received some nasty comments from someone for recommending them and omitting this info.)  Hope this helps!  If have you more Qs, you can email me personally.   Debi<br/>
