Totally unschooling conference in Columbia, SC August 22-24. Almost 300 <br/>
people registered so far! WOW!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an inclusive CA conference the weekend before--NEXT weekend! in <br/>
Sacramento. <br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian will be at both---I think everyone else is choosing one or the <br/>
other.<br/>

Hi, Ingrid --<br/>
<br/>
On the west coast this Friday, Saturday and Sunday there is a fabulous <br/>
inclusive homeschooling conference that many unschooling families enjoy. <br/>
  It&#39;s in Sacramento, CA, which is, I admit, pretty far south for you to <br/>
travel unless you are making other stops.<br/>
<br/>
Details are available at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a>  (look for Live and Learn <br/>
conference)<br/>
<br/>
I think the hotel is fully booked at this point, but nearby hotels, <br/>
campgrounds, or friends to crash with are still an option.<br/>
<br/>
The conference has many speakers, including Pat Farenga and our own Pam <br/>
Sorooshian.  (We even have at least one Canadian,  Marty Layne.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s going to be dizzying array of stuff, including kid and family <br/>
stuff and informal round table discussions.  (A new addition.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very energizing to be surrounded by masses of enthusiastic <br/>
homeschoolers.  For those of us who are too &quot;geographically challenged&quot; <br/>
to go to the fabulous all unschooling conference in South Carolina, I <br/>
strongly recommend the HSC conference in Sacramento.<br/>
<br/>
Six more days!<br/>

unschooling friendly because it is organized and run by a bunch of <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

still haven&#39;t been to it.  They seem to be trying to be more <br/>
inclusive, but it&#39;s run by school-at-home Christians.  They usually <br/>
have one or two unschooling speakers.  I miss the Wondertree <br/>
conferences.  The two I went to were wonderful, much like the S. <br/>
Carolina conference sounds.<br/>
