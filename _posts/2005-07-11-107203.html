<div id="ygrps-yiv-194533848">Some time back, someone asked for information specific to Virginia <br/>
unschoolers and Virginia-specific compliance issues. Â  I don&#39;t<br/>
post much, but did at that time provide a link to the <br/>
VAEclecticHomeschool Yahoo! group.<br/>
<br/>
As of the July 4 long weekend, that group is no longer available, due <br/>
to a Yahoo! glitch.  <br/>
<br/>
To remedy this, the VAEclecticHS List is the rebirth of <br/>
VAEclecticHomeschool, which was a large, active list for <br/>
in-depth discussion of issues affecting homeschooling, and for news <br/>
about media articles and programs, proposed legislation, research, <br/>
conferences and other information of interest to Virginia <br/>
homeschoolers.  <br/>

wondering where the old VAEclectic went, here&#39;s how to get back (or <br/>
join for the first time)--<br/>
