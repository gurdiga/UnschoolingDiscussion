remember  playing &quot;Chinese Whispers&quot; as a kid - &quot;send<br/>
reinforcements; we are going to  advance&quot; became &quot;send three and fourpence;<br/>
we are going to a dance&quot;  according to an old WWI story or myth.<br/>

Good one!<br/>
 <br/>
Here it was called &quot;telephone,&quot; where one kids starts a statement and it&#39;s  <br/>
whispered down the line. (I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s what you mean by Chinese  <br/>
Whispers.  Is that what they called it in Australia, or where were  you?  Hong Kong?)<br/>

That was the name for it in Australia, and that is the game you describe.<br/>
