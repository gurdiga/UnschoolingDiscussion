<div id="ygrps-yiv-56553582">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Besides being the easiest language to learn in general, Esperanto is <br/>
also the easiest to learn online for free.  While foreign language <br/>
(Spanish, French, Japanese, etc.) courses are offered online, there <br/>
are hardly any high quality courses offered for free.  On the other <br/>
hand, virtually all Esperanto resources online are free, including <br/>
complete introductory courses, as well as some advanced courses, <br/>
dictionaries, news and radio broadcasts, literature (novels, short <br/>
stories, poetry), music, travel opportunities through the hospitality <br/>
service &#39;Pasposta Servo&#39;, etc.  Check out the following list of the <br/>
most useful links:<br/>

There is now a new and extraordinary web site for learning Esperanto, <br/>
as always, for free.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It offers three basic mini-courses equivalent to about a year&#39;s worth <br/>
of college studies.  It has sound, flash cards for learning each new <br/>
lesson&#39;s vocabulary and much more.  There is also a &#39;babilejo&#39; (chat <br/>
room) which you can use even as a guest if you haven&#39;t registered.  <br/>
Hundreds of new learners from around the world (the site has been <br/>
translated in over a dozen languages) have already registered.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not it will ever reach official status as the <br/>
international language, Esperanto has been growing (and will continue <br/>
to do so) as a living, vibrant and useful language for over a century <br/>
for millions of people.  For me Esperanto has been my third most <br/>
commonly used language (after Spanish and English) for almost 10 <br/>
years now, ever since I learned it in my teens.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend taking advantage of these resources. <br/>
<br/>
:)  Hector</div>
