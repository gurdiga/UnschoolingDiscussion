<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921888895">-=-Anyhow, from an unschooling parenting point of view, what do you all think <br/>
about this issue? Sorry so long, I got chatty and had lots to say about this <br/>
issue. Thanks for sticking with me to the bottom.-=-<br/>
<br/>
One problem occurs when parents give a child money and then refuse to buy him <br/>
things after that.   &quot;You have money, you buy it,&quot; or whatever.   When we <br/>
give our children money, we mean for them to decide how to use that money on <br/>
their own, without having to ask.   But I might want to buy them something and I <br/>
will (or at least offer), or if they see something they want that would <br/>
reasonably be part of their health, welfare, food, shelter, clothing, &quot;education,&quot; I <br/>
can justify that in the budget, and if we can afford it and it seems like a <br/>
good deal, I won&#39;t make them use their own money.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If you currently know enough about finances to work with your son in a<br/>
responsible manner, I don&#39;t think it is fair to blame your current financial<br/>
problems on &quot;how you were raised.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
People can get stuck feeling needy in one area or another, and it can cause a <br/>
lot of problems.  It is possible for a parent to see how not to cause the <br/>
same vacuum in a child, yet still find self-comfort in eating or shopping or <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t keep in mind how treatment of children can have longlasting <br/>
effects, I might be less vigilant than I want to be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m better with money than I used to be, but my children area already better <br/>
than I am.  I might be better later, but I will never be as good as they <br/>
already are.<br/>
<br/>
I have an article about this here:<br/>

<br/>
While there are issues of temperament, there are many other factors that will <br/>
determine a child&#39;s relationship with money and other people.   At the Dallas <br/>
airport yesterday we had a layover.  Marty, Holly and I were in a little <br/>
magazine stand.  Holly wanted gummy bears, but settled for Red Vines.  Marty was <br/>
getting a root beer. I picked up a magazine with an article about the coming <br/>
movie &quot;Alexander&quot; on the cover, as that&#39;s Marty&#39;s middle name and he has an <br/>
interest in the historical character separate from that too.   <br/>
<br/>
I had a ten dollar bill out.  Two women were working there, and no one else <br/>
was in the shop.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was already at the counter, and I handed the magazine over, and the <br/>
money (toward Holly) but she said, &quot;No, I&#39;m paying for this with my money.&quot;  Her <br/>
candy was the least expensive thing on the counter.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Even my magazine?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The woman who had been stocking in the corner came over to see this child who <br/>
was offering to buy things for her mom and brother.  Both women commented on <br/>
being glad when their kids bought them things someday.<br/>
<br/>
But their kids might not.  And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s just temperament, though <br/>
temperament is a starting place.<br/>
<br/>
Some other factors are neediness, self esteem, self image, relationship with <br/>
those particular others, feelings of safety, trust, and probably others people <br/>
here could think of.<br/>
<br/>
In the nature vs. nurture discussions, I always think of the crowded rats <br/>
experiments done in the 1960&#39;s (I think).   Rats were bred for a few <br/>
rat-generations, some to be agressive and others to be pacifist.   Then some of both kinds <br/>
of rats were put in spacious, interesting environments, and some of both were <br/>
put in crowded, stark places.<br/>
<br/>
Nice rats in bad environments acted worse than mean rats in good environments.<br/>
Nice rats in good environments acted better than mean rats in good <br/>
environments.<br/>
Nice rats in bad environments acted better than mean rats in bad environments.<br/>
<br/>
No one factor decides all.<br/>
