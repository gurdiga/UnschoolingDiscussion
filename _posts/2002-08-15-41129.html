 </span></blockquote>Kacy, You will get better answers, I think, if you describe your problem<br/>
more specifically. What sort of activities or situations tend to give your<br/>
daughter fits? It does sound as though unschooling is the best way for her<br/>
(and most other kids), so you are really asking about a possible personality<br/>

/skills. <br/>

Tell us more. <br/>
