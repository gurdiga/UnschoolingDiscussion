We&#39;ve become very much more concientious about what we eat, in our family, <br/>
too...after years of suffering from every allergy known to nature (it seems ;-), <br/>
chronic sinusitis, and--in my case--20 years of what *appears* to be rheumatoid <br/>
arthritis but always comes up negative on the blood test/marker...<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve made the switch almost entirely to &quot;natural&quot; beef, chicken, and pork <br/>
(raised for us by local farmers and thus quite affordable), free-range eggs, <br/>
organic produce (except during the winter; we have no source aside from our <br/>
garden and our CSA garden), and have seen our general well-being improve <br/>
dramatically.  There are still plenty of less healthful habits that we&#39;ve yet to <br/>
eliminate (all of us love our sugar, alas), but we&#39;re making small steps and not <br/>
only do we see the difference in our physical well-being, we all find the deeper <br/>
involvement in the entire process of acquiring and producing food (making <br/>
friends with the alternative farmers, joining a health food cooperative, working <br/>
together in our gardens, etc. ) *and* the political/environmental <br/>
contributions that such actions make, to be extremely gratifying. <br/>

&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president,<br/>
 or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only <br/>
unpatriotic and servile, <br/>
but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>
