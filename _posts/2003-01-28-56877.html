<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515072360">**Extracurriulcar activiites  (or <br/>
community involvement ) and essays are also a big  determinant to being <br/>
accepted into college.**<br/>
<br/>
(a tangent)<br/>
<br/>
Because of the pending Supreme Court case about the legality of<br/>
including race as a factor in admissions, Newsweek recently ran a<br/>
detailed article about how the points are added up for calculating<br/>
admissions eligibility at the University of Michigan.  I was surprised<br/>
that the essay didn&#39;t count for more than a few points in their system. <br/>
It&#39;s interesting reading, still.  And it&#39;s important to keep in mind<br/>
that each distinct college or university system may have their own<br/>
unique way of rating applicants.<br/>
