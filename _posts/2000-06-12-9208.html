<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229822401">Hi Dia;<br/>
<br/>
If you want to correspond in Scots Gaelic (would love to help you, but<br/>
can&#39;t...I used to have friends who spoke) you might consider accessing<br/>
penpals or homeschoolers in Nova Scotia, Canada.  More particularly, on<br/>
the Nova Scotian island of Cape Breton...Big-time Gaelic country there.<br/>
Lots of awareness for the Gaelic culture.  Maybe even just key in &quot;Nova<br/>
Scotia&quot; and see what you find on the web.  Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Raised in Nova Scotia,<br/>

&gt; Why do you un/home school?<br/>
&gt; We started hs&#39;ing because our oldest was advanced and we knew that he<br/>
&gt; would be bored (read &quot;in trouble&quot;) in ps.  We moved into the unschool<br/>
&gt; mode gradually as I realized that teh kids were learning more when I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; them.  We continue to unschool because it has become<br/>
&gt; a part of our lives, sort of like eating!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How many children do you have, how old, and names(if you wish)?<br/>
&gt; Three, Stephan, 12, Kyra, 10, and Joel, almost 8.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?<br/>
&gt; Stephan loves computers, cars and guns.  He is designing a web page<br/>
&gt; about his 4-H projects, and reads constantly.  Kyra loves horses.  She<br/>
&gt; reads about horses, talks about horses, dreams about horses.  Did I<br/>
&gt; mention that she likes horses? :-)  Joel loves to fix and build<br/>
&gt; things.  He spends a lot of time in the workshop hammering and<br/>
&gt; nailing.  He is allowed to use the electric sander and drill alone,<br/>
&gt; but must have help to use the table saw.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WHat area does your family live in?<br/>
&gt; Midwest<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DO you have any pets?<br/>
&gt; Oh boy!  Do we ever!  Fish, birds, cats, dogs, chickens, ferrets,<br/>
&gt; geese, ducks, iguanas, goats, cattle, sheep, rabbits, and sometimes<br/>
&gt; pigs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add<br/>
&gt; We are city transplants to the country and hope never to move back to<br/>
&gt; the city!  Also, I am learning Scots Gaelic and if (okay this is a<br/>
&gt; long shot!) anyone else knows this language I would love to write back<br/>
&gt; and forth!<br/>

Scotland and McLane fm was from Ireland; whatta mix, Scot~Irish, then along<br/>
