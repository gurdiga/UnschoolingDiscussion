<div id="ygrps-yiv-437968417">Does anyone know where I can find one of those upholstered foam sleep out chairs that just fold out into a bed for kids?<br/>
<br/>
The last time I bought one it was for less than $20 but all the ones I&#39;ve seen online are 100.00.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any that are cheaper somewhere?  My daughter still likes to sleep in our room on the floor next to our bed.  We&#39;ve been using a feather mattress, but it is so bulky and hard to clean up and store.  I&#39;d like to get one of these chairs for her since they are lightweight, easy to move, and store.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
