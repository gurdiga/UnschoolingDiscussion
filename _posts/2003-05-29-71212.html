<div id="ygrps-yiv-135773799">I am not sure where to start with this, so I guess I will get right <br/>
to the question:  Is compassion something you can learn?  Is it <br/>
something a 6yo can learn?  Do some people just have it, and others <br/>
don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
Background:  My daughter is a very factual, literal, not-overly-<br/>
emotional child.  She is very lacking in intuition or compassion.  <br/>
She does not notice, or at least she does not seem affected by, <br/>
people in pain (physical or emotional.)  (She has millions of <br/>
wonderful qualities, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they are not the ones I <br/>
am concerned about.)<br/>
<br/>
She does not realize when something she does is hurtful until I <br/>
really sit her down and explain it.  Then she is very remorseful.  <br/>
That, I figure, may come with time.  What concerns me more is how <br/>
unaffected she is by people in pain.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, one morning during her gymnastics class I almost passed <br/>
out, and had to lay down on a mat and several people were gathered <br/>
around me.  It was near the end of class so the instructor led the <br/>
class to a side room so that they wouldn&#39;t see what was going on.  <br/>
(Although they had to walk by me to get there.)  Most of the kids had <br/>
looks on their faces like they were worried or wondering what was <br/>
going on.  All my daughter was concerned about was telling me she is <br/>
thirsty, can she get a drink.  The other kids all picked up on the <br/>
idea that something was wrong, but not her.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to tonight:  My dad had back surgery yesterday, and it <br/>
was a much more serious operation than any of us realized.  So <br/>
finally tonight he was moved out of recovery and into surgical <br/>
intensive care unit, so we went to visit him.  I took her, partly <br/>
because I knew it wouldn&#39;t phase her, partly because I was hoping it <br/>
would.  When we walked into his room, she asked, &quot;Is that Papa?&quot; <br/>
because he really looked different.  He was coming in and out of <br/>
consciousness, and kept wanting to change position (which hurt him <br/>
tremendously) and was trying to pull at his many tubes, so they had <br/>
to restrain him.  It was really pitiful.  But even in the midst of <br/>
it, all she was worried about was whether she would be home in time <br/>
for a tv show.  Then she asked why we were staying so long (about 40 <br/>
minutes) and I finally went over and explained to her that he had <br/>
been there all by himself (without family, anyway) all day, and he <br/>
was in pain, and then I asked her to think about what she would want <br/>
if she were in pain in a strange place.  I saw a glimmer of <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect her to ever be an overly-compassionate, merciful type <br/>
of person.  But I do wonder if there is something I should be doing <br/>
to help her see things from other people&#39;s perspectives.  Maybe just <br/>
taking it incident by incident is all I can do.  I know I am in a lot <br/>
of conflict right now just over seeing my dad like that, so maybe I <br/>
am making more of this than I should.  I don&#39;t know.  I would <br/>
appreciate any thoughts.<br/>

PS:  She did cry when she watched ET and Air Bud, so it is in there <br/>
somewhere.  Mainly for animals and extraterrestrials, though, it <br/>
seems.  :-)</div>

 </span></blockquote>She sounds a lot like my best friend&#39;s son. Evan (my son) and Ethan <br/>
ADORE each other. Actually, we are all so close that we are more like <br/>
family than friends. Evan would hear a baby cry as an infant, and bawl <br/>
his eyes out. These days he takes it upon himself to soothe the baby <br/>
(or child). Ethan can be standing right next to someone who has just <br/>
had an accident and not even notice. It used to freak me out because I <br/>
adore that child and Hanna and I have discussed this to great lengths. <br/>
We have 2 theories. One is that he can&#39;t split his focus on two <br/>
different things.  Two, he freaks when he sees someone in distress and <br/>
basically shuts down emotionally ---in other words, it&#39;s his own way of <br/>
coping or bringing back balance to a stressful situation.<br/>
<br/>
As to learning compassion, yes, I think it can be learned. He had an <br/>
incident about a year and a half ago in which he hurt Evan. We were out <br/>
in the playground and I had to come back home with him to clean the <br/>
dirt and grit off his eyes (they actually were irritated for a few <br/>
days). Ethan was so upset, he described feeling his &#39;heart explode&#39; <br/>
because he did not know what to do to make Evan feel better --he really <br/>
had not intended to hurt his friend. So I guess, that&#39;s why he shuts <br/>
off --imagine his heart exploding all the time! Evan, on the other <br/>
hand, is the polar opposite --he cries and shrieks about anything and <br/>
everything ---he gets so overcome by his emotions that he plops in the <br/>
floor, a bag of tears*.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s funny because Ethan and Evan --although on different ends of <br/>
the empathy spectrum-- need to learn anyway how not to be overcome by <br/>
their emotions and how to express them with words. So I guess they <br/>
balance each other out :-)<br/>

* This may sound a bit harsh but when it happens 4,5,6,10 times a day, <br/>
you cannot but be a bit distant about this. And this coming from the <br/>
mom that invented the &#39;anti-booboo kiss&#39;.<br/>
