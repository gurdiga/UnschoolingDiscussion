Have you tried posting flyers for a playdate or &quot;recess&quot; at a local park or <br/>
skate rink or even (in Michigan, outside play is probably difficult this time <br/>
of year) McDonald&#39;s play area? One HS group here meets every other week at <br/>
CiCi&#39;s pizza. You should post them in &quot;alternative&quot; stores and <br/>
businesses---health food stores and restaurants, massage therapists, <br/>
homeopaths, chiropractors. Some libraries allow private posts (ours doesn&#39;t). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are many unschoolers/relaxed homeschoolers that don&#39;t visit these lists <br/>
or the boards. We see it all the time: &quot;I&#39;ve been unschooling for years and <br/>
just found this site...I&#39;m so glad to have found you...I didn&#39;t realize there <br/>
was a name for what we do...&quot;  You may need to search them out.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a nationwide HS network---Ren can probably give you the <br/>
site---where people register. They&#39;re listed by zipcode, I believe. It&#39;ll <br/>
give what method of homeschooling they follow and ages of children (?). Other <br/>
things. I&#39;ve registered. Many here have. A good way to connect with other <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a support group called Lansing Capital Area Homeschoolers.  They are <br/>
an inclusive group and include everyone.  I am new to this group so I don&#39;t <br/>
know how many of the homeschoolers are unschoolers, but I did talk to someone <br/>
for quite a while about unschooling.  They meet every Wednesday from <br/>
11:00-3:30.  Most of the time they meet at the Downtown Library, but I know <br/>
once a month they meet for gym at a different location.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve never heard of this group and are interested in finding out more, <br/>
the website is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.msn.com/LansingCapital">http://groups.msn.com/LansingCapital</a> AreaHomeschoolers (I <br/>
think this is correct).  If you&#39;re having problems checking out the website <br/>
let me know. <br/>
