<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776829848">Mysterious Spot Seen on Saturn<br/>
Astronomers are Puzzled<br/>
It&#39;s a First in the Solar System<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those are the headlines from an aol.news story this morning.  I&#39;m not even <br/>
going to read it, I&#39;m just going to comment on the humor of the idea that <br/>
astronomers would say that anything they&#39;ve seen in the VERY short time they&#39;be been <br/>
looking would be &quot;a first in the solar system.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Astronomy is pretty new.<br/>
The amount of time Earth scientists have been studying is infintessimal in <br/>
&quot;solar system&quot; time.  Almost infintessimal in geological time. <br/>
<br/>
I am likewise amused by the hole in the ozone.  The sky is falling off!!<br/>
<br/>
HOW long have people even thought there WAS an ozone, and they consider <br/>
themselves experts in the geological history of the ozone?   It would be like <br/>
someone studying sea level &quot;in great depth&quot; one morning at 11:00 and then freaking <br/>
out TOTALLY at the tide coming in or going out, and predicting the end of the <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
And global warming...<br/>
Isn&#39;t it the same scientists who KNOW for certain there have been ice ages <br/>
large and small on earth, that that is a natural state of the earth, to cool and <br/>
warm, and that it&#39;s been going on since before there were humans, and yet (as <br/>
with the probably origins of some religions and superstitions and practices) <br/>
some seem positive that humans have sinned and that&#39;s causing the earth to <br/>
heat up?  <br/>
<br/>
What sins did the dinosaurs commit to cause the world to get colder? <br/>
What wonderful service to God did prehistoric man perform to cause the ice to <br/>
recede?  <br/>
There was a &quot;mini ice age&quot; within the past thousand years.  No doubt the <br/>
Catholics could explain that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been theorized that the whole sun-worshipping set of religions came <br/>
about from people thinking they had helped the earth warm up again.   When God&#39;s <br/>
in the sky and darkness is equated with punishment and evil, there is some sun <br/>
worship going on (anthropologically speaking).<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
A first in the solar system.<br/>
You heard it on the internet in 2005.<br/>

(How do they know?  Who&#39;s been tracking all this time?)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe polar bears are sinful.<br/>
