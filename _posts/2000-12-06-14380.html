&lt;&lt; If a person really truly believes that each person should make his or her <br/>
own <br/>
 decisions about religion, politics and educational options, then there&#39;s no <br/>
 sense, really, in dedicating much time or energy to one or the other of <br/>
those <br/>
 options.  A to-each-his-own believer should, it seems, spend time making <br/>
sure <br/>
 people HAVE options. &gt;&gt;<br/>
