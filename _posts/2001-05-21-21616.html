<div id="ygrps-yiv-680208067">In continuation from my 1st Grade - part II posts earlier last week, <br/>
I thought I would let you know that my dh is finally starting to let <br/>
some of my &quot;unschooling&quot; information sink into his stubborn head.<br/>
<br/>
Over the weekend; He had made a comment to me about how our oldest dd <br/>
(6) will be starting ps for 1st grade in Sept and that she will no <br/>
longer be in the same daycare as our youngest dd (3). And that our <br/>
youngest will be now be sortof on her own as well as the oldest - <br/>
different schools, different friends, etc.  I told him, &quot;this doesnt <br/>
have to be this way&quot;.  DH then started to let all the uncertainties <br/>
out. With all that was said, here is what I concluded:<br/>
<br/>
* He&#39;s afraid that I wont be able to stick with this and that its <br/>
just a fad that I am not going to be able to keep up with. When he <br/>
was saying this, I ultimately knew that he was envisioning a &quot;school <br/>
type&quot; setting, with myself and dd&#39;s sitting and studing all day long <br/>
with writing,reading & math books out all day long.  I carefully <br/>
explained that &quot;life is learning&quot; we will not be hitting the books <br/>
daily and that I planned to help our dd&#39;s with whatever they thought <br/>
was interesting and that the rest (reading, math, etc) will come <br/>
naturally.<br/>
<br/>
* That they wont be able to fit into the &quot;real&quot; world. That the ps is <br/>
preparing them for the environment (meaning people) outside and they <br/>
should know how to &quot;fit in&quot;. &lt; Ok, these were&#39;nt his real words, but <br/>
they are very similar in meaning&gt;  We,(I), discussed that the real <br/>
world sucks, that people we both know in our jobs are fake and try to <br/>
be someone their not, that we ourselves don&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; in with the most <br/>
of it. We do not hang around those we do not like or know who are <br/>
fake and that ps brings the &quot;fakeness&quot; out in people. Our dd&#39;s would <br/>
learn from us and end up being the person that they want to be, not <br/>
someone that they &quot;ought&quot; to be. Another reply I had to him on this <br/>
was, how was our dd benefiting from ps if she is going to be worried <br/>
all the time about &quot;fitting in&quot;? My dh really contradicted himself <br/>
alot in this area and in the end saw the unschooling in a new light <br/>
(or at least I now think that he sees a light).<br/>
<br/>
* The rest of his unsecurities are more on a personal issue with the <br/>
biggest still relating to financials. I will continue in my quest to <br/>
be able to come up with someway of working pt from home to at least <br/>
contribute some $ and continue to search out the medical/dental <br/>
insurance issues we have.<br/>
<br/>
I thank you all for everyones help and advise. I would not have been <br/>
able to get this far without it. By the way, does anyone have the <br/>
website to Girl Scouts or Brownie Group for Illinois?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25605234">I am not sure who I am addressing - I wanted to give you my two cents.  Dh<br/>
will come around.  My daughter went to public pre and K.   While in K she<br/>
would mention continuously &quot;so and so got in trouble today&quot;. It seemed as if<br/>
her attention was on those being punished instead of those being taught. <br/>
That and some personal decisions were our pull to homeschool.<br/>
If you can, get your dh to read some of the books that were suggested -<br/>
&quot;just to get his opinion&quot; - they love to give it.  I am sure it will open<br/>
his eyes and his memory bank to the failings of ps.<br/>
As far as the financial stuff goes.  When we made the decision to<br/>
homeschool, I made the decision to give up my position as a General Manager<br/>
- tough/easy decision.  Tough because I had worked extremely hard to get<br/>
were I was and I was doing very well (pride issue).  Easy once the decision<br/>
was made and my husband told me &quot; I will support you in any way possible&quot;. <br/>
I still had to work.  We couldn&#39;t afford to live on one income because of<br/>
the child support that we paid for my husband&#39;s two children.  Believe it or<br/>
not, I stepped from my position as manager and became a shift manager.  My<br/>
schedule was more flexible.  I worked when dh was at home.  About 2 years<br/>
ago I quit working at the restaraunt and chose to work in a grocery store. <br/>
Best decision I ever made.  The hours are flexible - they are opened 24<br/>
hours.  I work at HyVee.  I am sure there are some in Illinois.  The pay was<br/>
less, but they have  been so good about working around my schedule.  If you<br/>
are what they consider a regular time employee they offer insurance, etc. <br/>
Their insurance is actually better than the insurance I had when I was<br/>
working 60 hours at the restaraunt.  What I am trying to say is &quot;where<br/>
there&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a way.&quot;  <br/>
It will probably seem hectic at first - switching from going to work, to<br/>
staying at home.  You will need to make some personal sacrifices - sleep<br/>
schedule, juggling activities between dh and dw.  I can tell you, it&#39;s worth<br/>
it.  We do not have the added expense of child care and we do not have the<br/>
exposure to every strain of colds/viruses that usually pass through daycare.<br/>
Sit down with your dh and look at it  $$$ wise.  The $300 I was paying for<br/>
childcare for 2 children was just about the difference of pay cut between me<br/>
going from salary to hourly.  Plus my children were with me.  We did go<br/>
through the owning only one car and driving each other back and forth - some<br/>
of those times were our best conversation and planning times.   This is just<br/>
a suggestion.  Good Luck!!!<br/>
I do wish to add that the best way to get dh to come around and support you<br/>
fully is to get him information.  Ask some of the people on this site for<br/>
some resources!!<br/>

OOh!  Oooh!   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s a website that connects scouting (badges and such) with <br/>
homeschooling checklist-stuff which might make your husband feel better.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s linked from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expage.com/RadicalUnschooling">http://expage.com/RadicalUnschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
Go to the &quot;homeschooling otherwise&quot; link if it&#39;s not on the first page there.<br/>
