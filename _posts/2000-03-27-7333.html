<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995486324">I have a lot to be proud of lately. Last Friday, my children did an act in <br/>
the Oregon homeschoolers Talent show. They are 9 and 10. My daughter was <br/>
scared to death, even cried before the show. (they are clowns) They have been <br/>
training the last year with a professional clown. I was not going to force <br/>
her to do the show, but I just behave calmly, like nerves are a part of <br/>
performing, which they are. Her brother was ready to go on and would have <br/>
been crushed had she decided not to. Plus, I knew she would have been <br/>
disappointed in herself if she hadn&#39;t. Well, they did it and the Triumphed! <br/>
(it wasn&#39;t a competition) But they were flawless... I was so proud of both of <br/>
them, but to be afraid like that then with a lift of the chin, do it <br/>
beautifully! <br/>
<br/>
Then today, I got up early to write and by 11 I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. I <br/>
went to bed and left the instructions that they could work on any type of <br/>
project they liked but had to clean the mess and no TV. I wondered briefly <br/>
what kind of shape the house would be in.<br/>
<br/>
I woke to the smell of Chocolate chip cookies. Upon sleepy investigation, I <br/>
realized that they had not only baked the cookies(perfectly) but had cleaned <br/>
the mess and the living room! WOW!<br/>
<br/>
I am so proud of them, they used problem solving skills, cooperation, <br/>
reading, math, and basic living skills, all without a single worksheet nor <br/>
any direction or cohersion from me:) LOL<br/>
<br/>
Tooo cooool!<br/>
