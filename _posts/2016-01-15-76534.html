<div id="ygrps-yiv-436785497"><p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">We are currently at some
cross-roads with labelling in our family. Reading about the OP’s concerns and
Alex’s responses has been very insightful and thought provoking.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">For several years I have been
aware that my eldest, now 13 would have been labelled with something if she
were in school, as the years go on, I would lean toward that label being
Aspergers.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">I avoided a formal diagnosis and
worked around her needs – staying home a lot, supporting her interests which are
all on a PC, including researching many topics and especially digital drawing,
she gamed most days for several years as well, still games now, just far less,
avoiding loud and crowded places for long periods of time and pre-planning most
outings. I didn’t really realise initially that she may be ‘eligible for
diagnosis’ as living our Radical Unschooling life, respecting the child was in
the forefront of our decisions. As the years went on, I started to see that she
had difficulties that weren’t the norm and that was ok, especially as she wasn’t
at school and could do things at her own pace.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">Recently she has been expressing
that she feels ‘not good enough’ and questioning her own behaviour, she sees
herself as being different from most others, likely has for a long time if not
since the get go, it’s just becoming a concern for her now. I’d never
considered that the label/diagnosis may help her understand herself
emotionally. What I see/feel is that for the longest time not labelling her was
beneficial as we avoided outside pressures and extra support as it’s called yet
over the past few months since Pema has been questioning herself, it seems that
not seeking a diagnosis is possibly going to cause her harm.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">It made me recollect 20 years ago
when I thought I was crazy. It turned out, after another anxiety/panic attack
and trip to the doctor that I had acute manic depression/bipolar and ocd
tendencies… I never attached myself to those labels and worked personally to
overcome my challenges, but I did have a huge sigh of relief in knowing that
there was something explainable happening within me and I wasn’t actually going
crazy after all. I could understand myself and then I could help myself. A few
trips to psychologists and medication didn’t take and I was fortunate enough to
be able to work through it all (albeit over several tumultuous years) myself.
(Coming back to this/psychologist option further on as this has made me think
of something else).</font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">We have visited our doctor to get
a referral. Our doctor is someone I know personally and trust and has referred
us to the psychologist, another lady who she feels would be a good fit knowing
our family. The appointment has yet to be scheduled when the psych is back for
early February.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">I explained to our doctor that I was
concerned primarily for Pema’s emotional well-being, she understood that and
chose an avenue apart from the government options which I think are more
closely linked to the type of support they look at when children are in school.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">Over the years I have always
reassured Pema and accepted her quirks, most of which aren’t ever even
mentioned within our family as most are aware or at least accept that I don’t
fuss over things so they don’t/won’t as I’m not generally the one in the family
they would try and force their opinions onto, knowing I would do things my way
anyway. </font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">I would love to hear from other
parents, Alex again as well with thoughts on what I have shared and how I could
best help Pema. </font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">Pema seemed to handle our
discussion of her possibly being on the spectrum quite well. She even said she
was curious and felt knowing would make her feel better. Perhaps this is where
I jump back to the psychologist point. Is it enough to read some books and take
what I feel will help? As I did with my own personal challenges. Currently I’ve
read very little, just enough research to know where I feel we are, I haven’t
really needed to up till now. I have though ordered 3 books on Aspergers, 1 specifically
aimed at girls and one titled ‘All Cats Have Aspergers&#39;. Pema adores
cats, always has, always will. </font><span style="font-family:Wingdings;"><span style=""><font size="3">J</font></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">The small research I have done I
have sourced from Tony Attwood and online from women with Aspergers. Many of
these women have said they present quite differently to their male counterparts
and although professionals know about Aspergers, they don’t always understand
it as well as needed at times to be of sufficient help. So I am looking forward
to reading more from these women. </font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">Perhaps a psychologist is
unnecessary. I know that I want to stay away from intervention, I just want
Pema to know that there isn’t anything wrong with her, that there are reasons for
why she can behave in certain ways and that we can seek help if needed in
coping and strategizing perhaps with things she feels she needs assistance with
or where I see may need help with. I feel quite ill-equipped to do this solo
presently and that could be because I haven’t researched much…</font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">On a side as well, I do feel it
will help with her family relationships, especially her sister, so her sister
knows that Pema doesn’t like cuddles etc… for a reason, that it isn’t her, no
matter how many times I tell Bella it’s not her, that Pema is Pema and we are
all different, she still internalises it to some degree as it will come up 6
months even a year or 2 later after a particular incident… I also feel it would
help with other extended family as well as they have been critical over the
years and find it hard to accept Pema at times for how she can be. I am also
curious to know about what adverse effects sharing a diagnosis has had with
family etc… as I can see that it could backfire as was stated… I’m just hoping
that because of Pema’s age, we are out of that danger zone whereby they could
try and force some form of external ‘help’… </font></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">This is quite long winded, my
apologies. I also hope that it is line with helping someone else on this list,
at least the feedback. I hope I’m conveying my thoughts and again would greatly
appreciate further input into this subject.</font></p><p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align:justify;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">Natarsha</font></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495573548">For one aspect of general discussions of the differences in people’s talents or perceptions, maybe you could print out and play around with her with a list of Gardner’s intelligences.<br/>
Talking about which family members, or friends, or fictional characters, seem to have a lot or a little of which ones might be a way to keep it from seeming “wrong” or clinical or pathological.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a> has lists and chitchat about it, my descriptions as might apply to unschoolers, but the basic list is<br/>
<br/>
Visual/spatial intelligence<br/>
Musical intelligence<br/>
Verbal/linguistic intelligence<br/>
Logical/mathematical intelligence<br/>
Interpersonal intelligence<br/>
Intrapersonal intelligence<br/>
Bodily/kinesthetic intelligence<br/>
<br/>
Plus Nature intelligence (categorization of nuts and bolts, parts, similarities and differences—not  just birds and trees, but heraldry, or trucks)<br/>
Plus maybe Spiritual/Metaphysical/Religious (people are still looking at that) <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488379262">-=-Is it enough to read some books and take what I feel will help? As I did with my own personal challenges. Currently I’ve read very little, just enough research to know where I feel we are, I haven’t really needed to up till now. I have though ordered 3 books on Aspergers, 1 specifically aimed at girls and one titled ‘All Cats Have Aspergers&#39;. Pema adores cats, always has, always will. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be great to totally personalize it for her, yourself, gradually and just as much as she wants.<br/>
<br/>
When you ask whether a psychologist is necessary, think of what a psychologist could do for her.  Is there “therapy” for Asperger’s?  I think just attempts to untangle messes made by school and mean friends and failure to compete (in school, or werever).  If you’re shielded her from damaging environs, maybe that’s not what she needs.<br/>
<br/>
To me it seems that Asperger’s creates a long, long runway for those kids to get non-verbal social information.  It doesn’t mean they never will, but they might get it at 16, 18 years old instead of at 10 or 12.  Treating it as a lifelong “disability” doesn’t help, and I think it’s false.  They might not ever be as facile as someone born with the maximum possible social potential.  But few people have the maximum.  I don’t.  Kirby is the best in our family for social skills, and yet he doesn’t see much value in dressing well or shaving. :-)<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was younger, I said many times in discussion like this (behind his back) that he would’ve been dyslexic, on a school schedule.  When he was older, 16 or so (?) he overheard me mention something and asked about it.  I said yeah, but so was my dad and so was HIS dad (Keith  my husband), and it came very often with whatever causes left-handedness and an ease with math and spatial.  With puzzles, Marty’s a whiz–those nine-piece puzzles where all the edges need to match, that I can NEVER do (I give up after ten or fifteen minutes), Marty has always worked in less than a minute.  He liked them, but they were too expensive to get for him, since he played with them for 30 seconds and was done. :-)  :-)<br/>
<br/>
So by the time he knew there was a label he would have had in school, he already could read and write well, which he figured out in his own way.   EVERY SINGLE PERSON does it in his or her own way.  So with unschooling, if “behind” or “slow” are not factors, then everyone’s feeling confident, ideally, sometimes, when we’re lucky.  I would aim for that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960061785"><div>Thank you for the link to the intelligences. Pema and I spoke today about them and also about our options, whether to attend the psychologist or not. What would we &#39;get&#39; from seeing someone. Other than an official diagnosis, after further thought and consideration not more&nbsp;than we could do ourselves in our own home, time and capacity. Pema would prefer to&nbsp;explore this personally for now.

<br/>
Sometimes I think of a career, and of what “intelligences” it needs, and whether I (or someone else I’m thinking of) would be qualified or good at it. Like… Driving a large truck.  Not me.  It takes kinesthetic intelligence (facility with one’s own body and strength) and spatial reasoning (backing a trailer up right to a loading dock, in the dark/rain/snow; looking at an intersection and calculating how wide an arc it will take to turn that corner, in that truck, without going over a curb or hitting a pole or something).  <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, some jobs need the ability to read people, to be patient, to be flexible in mood and response.  Receptionists, sales, organizers of large events—hotel managers, funeral directors, grocery store managers.  Some of those also require business sense (math) while others don’t.   <br/>
<br/>
But each job has some needs.  Each person has some areas where he or she is better and others where it’s not probably good to drive a truck, or manage a disaster.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid people were always saying “You can be anything you want to be!”  <br/>
That doesn’t even begin to be true, so it’s nice when people consider apititude and interest!<br/>

<br/>
What’s it called now, what was one called “Aspergers Syndrome”?  I didn’t know it had been undone.<br/>
<br/>
Many psychological practices are to help people fit in.  And people NEED to fit in, in order to function with others.  A person’s parents can’t guarantee they will live long enough to let the child stay with them his entire life.<br/>
<br/>
But if and when a person decides to look for a psychologist, one thing to listen/look for is “cognitive therapy.”  Rather than tell your life’s history and “be in analysis” for years (which is also falling out of style or practice, I think), a cognitive therapist will help you see how your thinking is tripping you up.<br/>
<br/>
It’s what we do in this discussion all the time, but we’re aiming it at what ideas and language get between someone and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out (in retrospect it’s clear, though 20 years ago, it wasn’t foreseen), becoming a better unschooler involves becoming a better person.  Becoming a better person (more analytical, compassionate, patient) helps people in areas of life besides unschooling.  But that’s all about the parents, and not the children.  Parents can’t “teach” a child to be a good person.  But they can become good examples, and better guides, partners and advisors, so that over ten or twenty years, the children have access to the parents’ clarity.<br/>
<br/>
Becoming the sort of person you hope your child will be, or that your child will respect, is more valuable than years of therapy.  And it’s cheaper. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If a child needs physical therapy, that might be different, though some parents learn those skills, too, when they have a child who needs special care or specialized skills.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922523750">I shouldn’t have asked a question so easliy searchable.  Sorry.<br/>
I had asked: -=-What’s it called now, what was one called “Aspergers Syndrome”? I didn’t know it had been undone.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Wikipedia says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The diagnosis of Asperger&#39;s was eliminated in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and replaced by a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder on a severity scale.[3]”<br/>
<br/>
This will make it difficult for classically, severerly autistic children, it seems, perhaps.  Dilution.  Thought “a severity scale” will identify them.  Sheesh…<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.  I think with age, and patience, a child in an unschooled family will make progress in social skills by the time he’s a teen, or late teens.  Moreso than if he were in public school, in special ed, or in regular classes being bothered by the others, and confused by the constant social interactions of teachers and students around him.<br/>

interested in this topic of diagnosis and labels and disabilities. The
discussion here brings up some questions for me:</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

</font><p class="ygrps-yiv-2050942125MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">I have read that many adults feel a great sense of relief
when they receive a diagnosis of Asperger’s in their adult lives because they
always knew there was something very different about them and that the
diagnosis helps to explain what they knew intuitively. It seems that for some
of these adults the diagnosis helps them finally make sense of things that had
perplexed them their whole lives, as if the pieces were finally fitting
together. So is this a result of the effects of schooling (assuming these
adults probably went to school as children)? If they had been unschooled, is it
likely these perplexing feelings would not exist or would be minimized?</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

more obvious physical disabilities. So, for instance, some would say that
access to social skills training would be no different than access to sign
language or Braille – to aid in accessing the world around you. Does this
approach hold true for unschoolers? From an unschooling perspective, how do you
navigate through all these options for intervention for something like Asperger’s
and social skills deficits? Do you wait until the child expresses a desire to
work on improving these skills? Do you let the child know this training it out there as a
possibility if they ever want to explore it?</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

an unschooling family to let a child know that something called “Asperger
Syndrome” exists? Would you let a child know that there is information out
there and a label that some people would give to persons with this particular
constellation of traits? Would you let the child know that some people might
say they have qualities that could be described as Asperger’s? What does an
unschooling parent do with this information? Anything?</font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

Of course that’s a large part of our idea here—to minimize the damage of labelling, and to provide absolutely individualized assistance and partnership with each unschooled child.<br/>

<br/>
WHAT approach?  There is no braille or sign language.  There are cards with facial expressions, and high-paid special ed teachers who are trying to ameliorate the damage being done just before and after the child reports for this speical “social skills training.”  HOW would you think that would be better than unschooling itself, or something that unschoolers would want to do?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do you wait until the child expresses a desire to work on improving these skills?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Please read this and take it in.  The question is very basic to what unschooling is, if you’re thinking about waiting for a child to express a desire to learn ANYthing.<br/>

<br/>
In a rich unschooling life, your questions wouldn’t likely arise.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would you let the child know that some people might say they have qualities that could be described as Asperger’s? What does an unschooling parent do with this information? Anything?-=-<br/>

It depends.<br/>
<br/>
ALL questions must be “it depends.”  <br/>

Before you can see anything in an unschooling light, you must have an unschooling light to see by. :-)<br/>
