<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042694283">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
Trust you all had a great family time during the holidays (whatever your<br/>
religious persuasion) !!!<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for a good site for making fraction equivalencies  easier to<br/>
understand. I have used baking (and doubling recipes) and manipulatives but<br/>
I was wondering if there was anything else really wonderful out there.<br/>
This would be for my daughter who is in late elementary level ...grade 5/6.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

the software Math for the Real World.  In addition to cooking!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about sewing or making something. Using a measuring tape?  The clock is<br/>
also useful, especially for comparing quarter of an hour to a quarter of a<br/>
dollar.  Order two pizza&#39;s and cut them up until you have little bitty<br/>
pieces. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she were younger I would suggest Bath Math.  Save all kinds of<br/>
containers, all sizes and play with them in the bathtub. How many quarts<br/>
fill up the gallon, how many gallons fill a teaspoon.   You can add food<br/>
coloring to some of the jugs and mix colors that way too.  But she&#39;s<br/>
probably to old for this idea. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also, remember sometimes understanding comes in spurts. What seems like a<br/>
struggle this week may be a breeze in a two months.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-714373482">Thank you Lisa...<br/>
some great ideas. The pizza is one I really like.<br/>
But especially for reminding me of the &#39;ages and stages&#39; of learning. Point<br/>
well made. I am definitely getting better at this...perhaps I am more<br/>
relaxed with the fact that when they rub their eyes and groan  it is a<br/>
clear sign that the material is either not of interest (right now)or that<br/>
they are just not ready ( maybe later).  :) <br/>
