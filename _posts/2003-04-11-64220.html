&lt;&lt; What about the fact that the bible was censored/translated by men - under <br/>

It&#39;s not about unschooling.<br/>

Your right. It&#39;s not about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
BTW....when things fall in our home, which ever one is there yells &quot;I&#39;m okay!!&quot; Sadly, I&#39;m the awkward one. I have more bruises than Brianna! I Loading the van, setting up tents, carrying, schlepping....yes, I get bruised..and then I&#39;ll shout &quot;I&#39;m alive!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes - the wonderful sounds of the absence of fear!<br/>
There&#39;s nothing like it!!<br/>
<br/>
Brianna does get frightened. If she starts thinking of me dying. If she thinks she&#39;s dis-pleased me. We talk about it, still, she has these fears.<br/>
She still sleeps with me. Her bio-mom (and a few others) think that&#39;s terrible. <br/>
Maybe this comes from her bio-mom leaving her at the age of 26 months. Maybe it&#39;s from the abuse she suffered at her bio-moms hands. (Her Ernie doll was traded for a bag of heroin, her car seat - gone; etc)<br/>
<br/>
Brianna has some fears. I&#39;ll not be adding to them.<br/>
