<br/>
Hi, I highly recommend you order a few books from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pianimals.com/">http://www.pianimals.com/</a><br/>
For less than ten bucks, a person could play several familiar songs in <br/>
probably less than 30 minutes, depending on the person and age.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, my question is simply, are traditional piano lessons or using a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>non-traditional approach ( as the simply Music), a good match for<br/>
children who already show interest in wanting to learn to play the<br/>
piano? Especially, for children as young as 6 ond 8. My kids have<br/>
shown an interest in the piano and other instruments for years. I &#39;d<br/>
just hate to suddenly zap it becuase of the wrong type of lessons. And,<br/>
I figured several on this list have had experience with their kids<br/>
learning to play the piano and was hoping to hear their first hand<br/>
experiences and advise.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m a professional pianist and a private piano teacher ... a few <br/>
thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
- Whenever someone calls me about lessons and their child is six or <br/>
younger, I would immediately forward them to the local MusikGarten <br/>
teacher. To me, this is much more age-appropriate and money better <br/>
spent than private lessons, at that age.<br/>
<br/>
- I&#39;m always amazed at how people never &quot;shop around&quot; for a private <br/>
teacher. I would always tell people to interview (with their child) at <br/>
least three different teachers before making a decision. I have never <br/>
known a single person to do that. <br/>
<br/>
I think a big reason so many people get disatisfied with lessons and <br/>
want to quit is because it never ocurred to the parents to try to find <br/>
the right match before beginning. <br/>
<br/>
Some teachers have all their students do basically the same <br/>
assignments; some really work to tailor the pieces to what each <br/>
specific student would like. Some teachers are BIG on incentive <br/>
programs; others don&#39;t use them at all. Some teachers require students <br/>
to write down how many minutes they practice each day. Some teachers <br/>
require participation in a recital. Others don&#39;t even provide that <br/>
opportunity. And on and on. And personalities are just different ... <br/>
who does your child just feel comfortable being around?<br/>
<br/>
- BTW, even if a child is learning through a &quot;traditional&quot; method, a <br/>
good teacher, IMO, should certainly have students be doing <br/>
improvisation and other more &quot;creative&quot; activities. One of the signs of <br/>
a good teacher is that they use way more than just a single method book <br/>
or series.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and feel free to e-mail me off the list if you want to talk <br/>
about it more.<br/>
