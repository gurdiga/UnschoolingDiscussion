<div id="ygrps-yiv-352610355">My 13-year-old decided to have her own private reading list this past <br/>
summer, since her friends in high school did (she is a year or two younger and <br/>
curious about what high school would be like)<br/>
<br/>
       So she went online to the local high school websites and pulled all <br/>
their reading lists for the different grades and decided what she wanted on <br/>
&quot;her&quot; list. She&#39;s had a great time telling me what she&#39;s been reading -- anyway, <br/>
the point is that she is still finishing up and doesn&#39;t want to stop. Yesterday <br/>
in the car, she began to laugh and to read a passage out loud to me and her <br/>
little brother (both of them were early, self-taught readers.)<br/>
<br/>
       It was from &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; about Scout going to first grade <br/>
and being told by the teacher that she shouldn&#39;t have been allowed to read <br/>
before the teacher &quot;taught her properly.&quot; It&#39;s a hilarious passage and all three <br/>
of us had a wonderful time laughing with Scout, at the regimented and clueless <br/>
world that doesn&#39;t know how delicious self-learning can be.  &quot;)  JJ<br/>

&gt; he&#39;ll be empowered to know that he can learn so many other things on his <br/>
&gt; own. <br/>
&gt; It&#39;ll destroy the myth of the need for teachers for every little thing he <br/>
&gt; needs <br/>
&gt; to know. He&#39;ll learn that he can willingly ask for assistance and receive it <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; graciously. Very important, too.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amblesideonline.homestead.com/&lt;/A">http://amblesideonline.homestead.com/&lt;/A</a>&gt; for reading lists.  We just use them as suggestions, not like following <br/>
thier curriculum, but they have some very good suggestions for great reading.  We <br/>
use the lists just as suggestions for reading, we dont just pick from one <br/>
&quot;level&quot;   Some of the books are very familar titles, but many of them I had never <br/>
heard of.    It&#39;s great to go to the library and just pick out books, and we <br/>
do that alot.. But, sometimes it gets overwhelming trying to choose.   We have <br/>
fun looking for particular books  THEN deciding if they look good.   <br/>
