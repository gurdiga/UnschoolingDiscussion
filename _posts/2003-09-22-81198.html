<div id="ygrps-yiv-575943269">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for sending this to the entire list, but I need to say &quot;Thank <br/>
You&quot; to those who have posted to me privately. Your kindness is appreciated and I <br/>
do promise to post back to each of you. Being that I still have some 175 <br/>
posts to get through, I hope to finish up soon and answer you individually. Sorry <br/>
for taking so long, I had no idea I&#39;d come home to so many. <br/>
<br/>
Have a great day,<br/>
Rhonda <br/>
<br/>
