really aren&#39;t producing that many school-y types of documents?<br/>

I wish I could just write a report, but I&#39;m supposed to give them<br/>
something to look at.<br/>

Scrap book.<br/>
<br/>
Seasonal stuff, photos of kids or of things they&#39;ve made or done,  <br/>
programs of plays they saw or were in, maps or brochures of museums  <br/>
or zoos or whatever...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703689623">Thanks for all the suggestions.  I had read the Acme things before, <br/>
too, and they actually helped me write up my own &quot;educational <br/>
objectives&quot; that I had to file at the begining of the year.  For the <br/>
end of year portfolio that I am working on, I was looking for more <br/>
specific things.  I know I saw a list *somewhere*!<br/>
<br/>
Like legos/k&#39;nex = geometry and critical thinking or whatever<br/>
<br/>
The article someone posted had a good couple examples.  I&#39;m going to <br/>
keep looking for that list!  I&#39;ll post it if/when I find it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263505728">We take tons of pictures of all the things we do.  Outings, museums,<br/>
great lego sculptures, and any paperwork they do that can be &quot;schoolish<br/>
enough&quot; for them.  <br/>
