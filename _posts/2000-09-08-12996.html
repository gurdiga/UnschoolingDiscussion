Oh Marianne, you haven&#39;t lived until you&#39;ve been terrorized by a dangerous<br/>
spider!  That&#39;s what I left out before...we have some really nasty spiders<br/>
here in Western Washington. The brown recluse, the gray recluse, the black<br/>
widow... A large black one got me once. Made me hallucinate. We have to be<br/>
very careful in the wooded areas.<br/>
