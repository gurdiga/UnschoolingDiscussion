<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106821294">Hi, I live in NY. A friend told me there are some great examples of<br/>
paperwork (instruction plans, reports, etc., written in an unschooling<br/>
style) on Sandra&#39;s site, and I can&#39;t find anything. Can someone point<br/>
me in the right direction?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
