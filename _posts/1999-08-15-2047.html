&lt;&lt; My niece was reading at a 5th grade<br/>
 &quot;level&quot; in 1st grade - but she&#39;s not reading at a Graduate school &quot;level&quot; in<br/>
 7th grade, so I believe all these things balance out in the end. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Becky!  I love this line.  My dd is only 2yo and loves being read to <br/>
all the time, BOOK AFTER BOOK!  But I have to admit to already being a little <br/>
nervous and concerned about when to teach her to read, how much to &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
and how much to just let her learn.  <br/>
    My grandma was a public elementary school secretary when I was a child, <br/>
and raised me until I was 6.  She would always bring home outdated readers <br/>
and textbooks or discarded sample copies from publishing companies.  She <br/>
swears that she taught me to read when I was 3.  I don&#39;t remember, but I do <br/>
know that I was reading fluently when I started kindergarten.  So, already <br/>
she is asking me when I am going to start teaching my dd to read.  With my <br/>
younger sister, my mother read a book on teaching your toddler to read, and <br/>
started working with her using flashcards at the age of 2 or 2 1/2.  So here <br/>
comes the confusion -- yes, I want my dd to learn to read, and neither my <br/>
sister or I grew to dislike reading because of feeling pressured at an early <br/>
age.  But, I can&#39;t help but think that my dd might respond differently and I <br/>
can&#39;t bear to think that I might do something that would decrease the love <br/>
that she has of being read to now by forcing her to soon to learn to read on <br/>
her own.  I don&#39;t want to sit back and do nothing, but I don&#39;t want to push <br/>
too hard and do damage in the long run!  Anyone else been in this dilemma?  <br/>
For now, my dh and I just read, read, and read some more to her.  And we also <br/>
make a point to let her see us reading things that we enjoy on a daily basis <br/>
as well.  Hopefully, we will know when the time is right for her.<br/>
    On the other hand, although my sister and I were both early readers, we <br/>
also both seemed to plateau somewhere around jr. high.  And neither of us <br/>
have IQs jumping off the scales now!  In fact, I thoroughly embarrassed <br/>
myself a little over a month ago, when in the midst of a conversation <br/>
regarding people with very high IQs, I remarked, &quot;Yes, like those people in <br/>
Mesna, right?&quot;  Oh well - I guess that alone would eliminate me from <br/>
membership!<br/>

<br/>
Being gifted academically definitely exists.  The system is not very well <br/>
equipped to handle it and in the process of not handling it, very often <br/>
mangles these kids.  Imo, the child with a high IQ is just as in need of very <br/>
special services as the child with a very low IQ.  IQs exist.  Intelligences <br/>
exists.  Different ability levels exist.  All measured by humans and <br/>
therefore not measured perfectly.  But the system is not able, imo, to deal <br/>
adequately with the high-level academic needs of some kids and kills them off <br/>
in the process.<br/>
<br/>
If a child &quot;levels off&quot; or &quot;evens out&quot; from neglect, this child has been <br/>
misserved.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119287131">Unschooling is primarily about process not content.  The process of learning, the<br/>
process of knowing yourself, openness, confidence, self-determination, independent<br/>
thinking, critical thinking....none of which one gets when following other<br/>
people&#39;s agenda.  Making one&#39;s own agenda is what it is all about. Again this is<br/>
done not in isolation but in the context of ones family and community.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot  get where YOU want to go if you are being coerced.....even if the<br/>
coercion is covert. Neither can your daughter.  Don&#39;t sit back and do nothing.<br/>
Live your life, share your enthusiasms and give assistance....when it is<br/>
requested.<br/>
