<div id="ygrps-yiv-96195332">wanted to jot this to share before the season passes...  <br/>
LOOK!  a halloween &quot;unit study&quot;(unschooler style)  -- notes taken <br/>
after-the-fact  --all of this wonderfully uncontrived while happening!<br/>
brainstorming (creative problem solving) what to be.  after seeing too many <br/>
50&#39;s girls&#39;poodle skirts at the parade, 10yodd decides she wants to be <br/>
something more original so she gets out a library book or 2 on greek myths to <br/>
refresh her memory & see costume ideas and decides upon persephone... a <br/>
character from one of her fav&#39;s.  7yodd chooses gypsy and we discuss the <br/>
different kinds of gypsies weve heard of and from where we have heard about <br/>
them.  <br/>
later, family discussion on diff meanings of halloween to diff people, why <br/>
some dont celebrate, etc. as we know fams who do not participate.<br/>
pumpkin carving, note historical origins of carving gourds for lighting, talk <br/>
about techniques for transferring patterns onto pumpkins before carving, <br/>
roasting seeds for snack.<br/>
during trickorttreat, practicing manners and safety lessons...<br/>
after trickortreat, sorting (led by the oldest, the kids put similar kinds of <br/>
treats in smaller bags and label with their names!) and next day trading with <br/>
friends who were over.  both great reinforcements of math and realworld <br/>
concepts...<br/>
next few days, splitting skittles into equal parts to share evenly, <br/>
(love those little kids doing fractions.)  and sharing the haul with elderly <br/>
neighbor and parents-- lessons of sharing w/less fortunate (or in this case: <br/>
less candied!)<br/>
later in wk, 3yos takes all of his loot and sets up a store for family to <br/>
come shop from!<br/>
<br/>
what have i forgotten? <br/>
