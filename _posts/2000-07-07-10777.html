&lt;&lt; Just wanted to let you know about a new e-group I&#39;ve started.  Its for <br/>
people <br/>
 who have home based businesses and also unschool.  Several people have <br/>
 e-mailed me privately about this and so I just went ahead and set it up!!  <br/>
 Hope to chat with some of you there as well as here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Dawn,  I joined the group today-- I sent a post to let you know!  I look <br/>
forward to being a part and learning how I could maybe work from home <br/>
successfully.  Thanks. ~Karen</div>
