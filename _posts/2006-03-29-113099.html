<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047933313">Have to share this sweet moment.<br/>
<br/>
I drove my 13yod to her play rehearsal.  It&#39;s a fairly small building, she <br/>
is acquainted with many of the friendly people who spend a lot of time <br/>
there, and there is no way that she could get lost on her way to the class.<br/>
<br/>
As we got close to the parking lot, she asked, &quot;Are you going to walk me <br/>
in?&quot;  I said, &quot;Do you want me to?&quot;  She replied, &quot;Yes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I walked with her to the sign-in sheet and the door of the rehearsal.  She <br/>
blew me a kiss and said, &quot;Love ya.&quot;<br/>
