&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t see you practicing what you preach. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How long have you been at this list Sherry?  I&#39;ve never known Joyce to not <br/>
practice what she preaches at this list. The list owner has asked us to keep <br/>
the INTENT of the list on track, which Ned ignores many a time. Does it not <br/>
matter to you that the intent of this list, the reason for which it was <br/>
created (BY the list owner) is to talk about unschooling?<br/>
If the focus of a list is for a purpose, it should be respected.<br/>
There are many lists with different focus, this one is to talk about <br/>
unschooling not to bash schools and promote a certain political view.<br/>
If people have a need for school bashing and politics there are other places, <br/>
that&#39;s all.<br/>
Why is it so hard to understand that?<br/>
Personally, my dh reads over my shoulder oncer in a while and I&#39;d hate for <br/>
him to read some of Ned&#39;s posts as he does not support unschooling <br/>
completely, nor does he enjoy school bashing since his experiences were good.<br/>
I come to this list to point people to unschooling and to get support and <br/>
advice from those more experienced than I.<br/>
It would be ludicrous to go to a vegetarian list ranting and raving about the <br/>
goodness of steak and then get mad at the list owner or moderator for asking <br/>
you to take it elsewhere wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>
I understand that homeschool law and politics do affect us to the point that <br/>
they will get mentioned here and discussion is one thing, ranting and raving <br/>
is another and destructive to the purpose of this list.<br/>

Vegetarian Cooking-a place to share great vegetarian recipes and ideas for <br/>
living a veg-life&quot; and then spending your time at that list bashing meat <br/>
eaters and describing slaughter house practices in detail. Not much joy, not <br/>
much sharing of ideas.<br/>

That was a really great analogy Mary. Thank you!<br/>
