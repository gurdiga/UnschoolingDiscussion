<br/>
In my husband&#39;s culture this is pretty common - mil&#39;s and others giving a LOT <br/>
of unsolicited advice. But they don&#39;t follow up on it -- they just love <br/>
giving it and it truly IS a way of being attached and showing concern and <br/>
love and caring and community. You can smile and accept it as a nice gift <br/>
without worrying that they&#39;re going to hold you to it later. And - sometimes <br/>
it is good advice (probably more often than most dil&#39;s take it). &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve always been involved with girl scouts - we&#39;re nonChristians and so <br/>
on....  Just pick your troop and troop leader carefully because the leader <br/>
has a lot of autonomy and can promote things that aren&#39;t at all part of the <br/>
GS program officially. <br/>
<br/>
Better yet, be the leader yourself, get other more like-minded girls/families <br/>
involved (that&#39;ll happen by attrition if you run it your way).<br/>
<br/>
If you have Campfire Boys and Girls near you - that is co-ed and I know <br/>
homeschoolers that really like it. Does a lot of girl scout type stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Remember to read the program YOURSELF and that you can do ANYTHING that is <br/>
within program guidelines -- you do NOT have to do it the traditional way.<br/>
<br/>
We had a troop for a few years that had girls from 5 to 15 years old all in <br/>
one troop. We met once a month, all day and occasionally for weekend outings. <br/>
Most troops meet weekly or every other week, for an hour or two and mostly <br/>
have all girls the same ages. We&#39;ve had lots of good times and lots of good <br/>
learning -- but we&#39;ve backed off in recent years just because the kids are <br/>
less interested in those kinds of groups of girls activities. We&#39;re starting <br/>
up with 4-H, though, to see how that goes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-878751717">I know that a lot of my M-i-L/D-i-L chat has been nothing more<br/>
than small talk about matters of common interest.  I care very<br/>
much how she raises my grandsons - but have no reason to believe<br/>
she will ever blindly follow consensus parenting or act to do<br/>
them harm purposely.  It is a fine line, though.  I bit my tongue<br/>
when she and our uncircumcised son decided to have the first boy<br/>
cut.  I gave them the reasons we had decided against it, but<br/>
walked away.  By the time boy 2 came along, D-i-L thinks I am th<br/>
efont of all parenting advice, poor thing.<br/>

your husband Iranian? (or from somewhere else in the Middle East?) I only ask <br/>
because of your last name, and that when I was a kid, we lived there in the <br/>
70&#39;s. We lived in Tehran for a few years and then south of there, for about <br/>
18 months, in Esfahan. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to see the decent motive underneath.  My cultural preference<br/>
(Californian?) would be that they lean back, exhale a little, and say<br/>
something mild like &quot;what about if you did blank?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The style of advice I get is a lot more agitated than that and sounds<br/>
like dictating to me.  (They don&#39;t literally shake their fingers in my<br/>
face but the words &quot;you should&quot; are heard over and over and they are<br/>
quite loud and emphatic.)<br/>
<br/>
I probably need to understand that they don&#39;t have the power to MAKE do<br/>
anything, no matter how loud they say it.  I have a hard time being<br/>
undefensive when it feels like they are attacking.  I need either more<br/>
deep breathing, or maybe tranquilizers.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really want everyone to agree with me and find disagreement pretty disagreeable.<br/>
