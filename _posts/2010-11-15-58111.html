<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110372986">I was recently at a La Leche League (breastfeeding support) meeting with several moms and children ranging in age from newborn to 7 years old.  One mom expressed some frustration at not being able to understand what her not-yet-talking two year old wanted.  Another mom quickly jumped in with &quot;Oh, definitely!  I would take a newborn over a toddler any day!&quot;  And someone else said, &quot;I would take a MILLION newborns over a toddler!&quot;  And then others with &quot;Well, I would take a toddler over a 4 year old!&quot;  And so on about how children keep getting more horrible as they get older.  <br/>
<br/>
I was shocked!  So I said, &quot;I like toddlers.  My daughter was 2 when my son was born, and she was so sweet to him.&quot;  The mom next to me scoffed and said &quot;Sweet!?!  I would NEVER use that word to describe my daughter!  I would use words like &#39;hellion&#39; or &#39;monster&#39;!&quot;  Everyone seemed to think it was funny but I was horrified.  I couldn&#39;t imagine saying that about another person, especially my own children.  There were a few moms of newborns there that were just kind of stunned and I felt bad that everyone was sending them a message that it was just going to get worse from there.  So many of the moms were enjoying the kid-bashing that my comments about how kids are great seemed to be drowned out.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems something positive did come out of this though, because later at home I talked to my husband about it.  He has a habit of saying negative things about our children when he is angry, like that they are &#39;babies&#39; or &#39;stupid&#39; or &#39;bad&#39; or &#39;naughty.&#39;  We didn&#39;t really talk about him or how he says those things - just about the La Leche League moms and how many of the kids were in the room and could hear what their parents were saying.  The cool thing is that I have noticed that since our conversation about how badly I felt to hear others talk about kids in such a negative way, he is really trying to change the way he talks about our kids when he is frustrated with them.  And I didn&#39;t nag or lecture him about it, but that he realized he didn&#39;t like how he sounded and decided to try to be better.<br/>

There were a few moms of newborns there that were just kind of stunned  and I <br/>
felt bad that everyone was sending them a message that it was just  going to get <br/>
worse from there.  So many of the moms were enjoying the  kid-bashing that my <br/>
comments about how kids are great seemed to be  drowned out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I run up against this quite often myself, even among mamas (and dads) who seem <br/>
to be advocates of empathic parenting practices (LLL, AP, etc).  There seems to <br/>
be a deeply ingrained belief that children are innately &quot;out to get us&quot;, <br/>
&quot;terrible&quot;, &quot;little monsters&quot;, etc., which then seems to make acceptable the <br/>
sort of down-talking, kid-bashing you experienced.  To say that it makes me very <br/>
sad and confused is an understatement.<br/>
<br/>
I have twin boys (who will turn 1 this Thursday) and a 4.5yo daughter.  When <br/>
people see us, very often the first response is, &quot;Wow&quot; or a look of amazement.  <br/>
After that, though, the negative, mama-martyring, child-bashing comments <br/>
disguised as support begin: &quot;My, my...you have your hands full&quot;, &quot;ooh, double <br/>
trouble, huh?&quot;, &quot;two boys, watch out!&quot;, &quot;oh, big sister.  I bet *she&#39;s* a big <br/>
help, huh. hehehehe&quot;, &quot;wow, super mom; you make my situation look easy&quot;, &quot;and I <br/>
thought my life was hard&quot;, etc. etc.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It gets so painfully old to hear these comments, but I also feel so irritated <br/>
and sad for children in general as well as the poor parents who literally feel <br/>
so frustrated by their lives and blame that on their children.  I aim to be <br/>
compassionate, understanding that these comments have more to do with the people <br/>
saying them than with my children or me, but I also aim to convey the happiness <br/>
and heart-bursting love that I genuinely feel for my children, my family and <br/>
myself.  So, like you, I focus on positive comments in return: &quot;yes, I am quite <br/>
a lucky mama&quot;, &quot;she is a big help to me&quot;, &quot;they are delightful&quot;, &quot;we have been <br/>
blessed&quot;, etc etc.  Usually, these statments shut the comments down rather than <br/>
encourage a more open, honest, positive conversation about being a parent as I <br/>
would some times like to have.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, even when I am having a challenging day, I really work on appearing content <br/>
if not happy, smiling and looking people in the eyes, kissing my children often, <br/>
speaking to them, involving them in the work we are doing, etc.  At the very <br/>
least I feel that being a beacon of positivity will give my children and I a <br/>
true sense of well being; if beyond that a few parents or non-parents feel <br/>
good/better/more positive about children and parenting as result of seeing my <br/>
family or speaking with me briefly about twins or children in general, then <br/>
great! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, having two baby/almost toddler boys is amazing and amazingly exhausting.  <br/>
Add to that a very spirited 4 year old girl and what an awesome experience I get <br/>
to have!  I think I may have written that the boys were almost 1yo and next to <br/>
that the word YIKES! I would like to clarify that I am shocked that they are <br/>
already a year old as it seems like they were just born... thus the YIKES!  Time <br/>
certainly goes by quickly when one is having a good time ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is exactly what I love about radical unschooling discussions - the idea that its not just &quot;okay&quot; to love being a parent but worthwhile to reframe parenting challenges into things we &quot;get&quot; to do and to have. Embracing and enjoying our relationship with our kids whole heartedly doesn&#39;t diminish us as thoughtful people or people with needs and interests of our own, its a chance to make our own lives bigger and more wonderful. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281616173">I have just come out of hospital for 4 days after an emergency op and I had to leave my 6 month old(who is breastfed) and   myother kids at home with daddy.  I was devastated but you would not believe how many nurses and other patients made comments about how I must be &#39;enjoying the break&#39; and that I should stay in as long as possible.  I found it so emotional and heartbreaking to be away from them all, especially the baby, and this &#39;joke&#39; just got more and more upsetting to me.  In the end I just kept saying &#39;actually I can&#39;t WAIT to get back to them all, I hate being separated&#39;.  They just looked at me like I was mad.<br/>
I don&#39;t get it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852102470">There is nothing to get, perhaps:)  It seems really easy to pick on the<br/>
disenfranchised, because they can&#39;t fight back.  Kids are the biggest<br/>
disenfranchised group who depend on adults for their survival and often<br/>
cannot tell us exactly what they want/need only what they do not want or<br/>
need and hope we can help them.  They are needy and dependent, and we are<br/>
obligated to respond to facilitate their very survival as well as their<br/>
future growth/prosperity/happiness.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it is like racism or sexism--where one torments and disempowers<br/>
members of a group as individuals, just because they are members of that<br/>
group and then uses their  desempowerment to belittle the group as a whole.<br/>
 Its not quite the same, as the disempowered group individuals(kids) are<br/>
sometimes loved well by individuals(parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents,<br/>
friends) within the group with life/death power over them. Although perhaps<br/>
slaver owners, and husbands who beat their wives also claimed to be<br/>
&quot;protecting&quot; and loving the disempowered person in their dyad, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that way our culture sets up parenting to be adversarial (needing &quot;control&quot;, &quot;who&#39;s in charge?&quot; that kind of thinking) does end up making a culture that takes it as an assumption that people don&#39;t want to be with their kids if they don&#39;t have to.  (And it makes a culture that makes families you *do* need a break from!) That *is* a sadness and a great poverty of spirit, imo.<br/>
<br/>
But too, I think we need to give parents space to need some time alone without making them feel like they, therefore, don&#39;t love and appreciate their children.  Parenting can be really hard, depending on your kid, and takes a huge amount of energy.  And different people have different needs. I know that *I* am a way more present available mother if I get some time alone to recharge (or time alone with my husband or my best friend).  <br/>
<br/>
That said, i do agree that it&#39;s an awful way to talk about someone you love, *especially* in front of them!  Kind of like when I was pregnant and people asked me, in front of my three boys, if I was hoping for a girl *finally*.  : (<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; People seem to focus on managing children&#39;s behaviour, rather than<br/>
 </span></blockquote>acknowledging or validating their needs.  We never assume adults need to<br/>
change.  Have you ever seen a hungry kid, whose mom is getting one more<br/>
errand done before she feeds him.  He is whining and she&#39;s on a mission to<br/>
pick up the drycleaner, the wine for a dinner party, and some boots at the<br/>
repair shop.  Then if in the meltdown at the Food Court the inevitable<br/>
meltdown comes the mother will actually make the kid wait longer.<br/>
<br/>
I once got into a conflict with a mother whose hungry child was &quot;too whiny&quot;<br/>
so she was going to punish her by letting the person behind them order next.<br/>
The line up was long and the girl (about four) kept asking if it was finally<br/>
their turn, she was saying how hungry she was, that her tummy hurt and<br/>
reciting all the things she wanted to order, as she bounced around on the<br/>
spot.  Her mother was intent on managing her behavior.  I would have been<br/>
rummaging through my purse looking for anything edible, card in hand anxious<br/>
for our turn.  The girl burst into sobbing into protest as the adult male<br/>
went next on her turn, which meant the mother let another person go in their<br/>
stead.<br/>
<br/>
The hungry kid&#39;s display was managed, rather than her hunger satiated.  Only<br/>
until she could be silent and order politely (p&#39;s and q&#39;s) was her mother<br/>
satisfied.  She glared at the people gaping, and of course there were more<br/>
people approving.  A couple of us exchanged glances and I protested by<br/>
saying I have three kids much older and honestly hunger is a problem in need<br/>
of solving and expecting kids behaviour to be &quot;restraint&quot; when they are<br/>
really really hungry is unrealistic.  I stopped talking when I realized the<br/>
mother was prepared to take her hungry sobbing baby to the back of the line.<br/>
 People &quot;manage&quot; children&#39;s behaviour rather than stop to discover the<br/>
source, or even ignore the source in favor of some &quot;lesson&quot; or respect they<br/>
deem more important than the child&#39;s physical need.<br/>
