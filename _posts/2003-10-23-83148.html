<div id="ygrps-yiv-110708366">-- Take Action -- Help Home-education in Holland --<br/>
-- Sample mails on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thuisonderwijs.net/support-nl/#samplemail">http://www.thuisonderwijs.net/support-nl/#samplemail</a> --<br/>
<br/>
Background<br/>
In The Netherlands home education as such is currently not a legal option.<br/>
You may try to get an exemption from school registration, but only for<br/>
deeply felt religious or philosophical reasons. These exemptions are<br/>
recognised with great reluctance, for your child is not considered to be<br/>
educated effectively without school attendance. Once your child has attended<br/>
a school even this option is barred; taking a child from school as a result<br/>
of a change of your opinion about life is in fact prohibited.<br/>
<br/>
Now only the parents of about a 100 children have been able to avoid this<br/>
trap to secure their freedom. Many more families would like to home-educate<br/>
their kids but are not able to get their way without years filled with<br/>
courtcases and child protection investigations.<br/>
<br/>
Since some courtcases have been won rather unexpectedly by home-educators<br/>
this year, Maria van der Hoeven, the Dutch minister of Education wants to<br/>
make life even more difficult for them. Despite the fact that the current<br/>
law does not consider home-education to be an effective option next to<br/>
schooling, she wants to put us under tight educational supervision. The<br/>
Educational Committee of the Second Chamber, the Dutch House of<br/>
Representatives, will have a debate on her plan on October 30, at 10.00 AM.<br/>
It can be read in English on<br/>

<br/>
Since only a 100 Dutch children are exempted from school registration, most<br/>
politicians do not consider this important. The debate has been postponed<br/>
twice already, and now it has even been put into a 1 hour shorter schedule<br/>
than before. But from the attention this small group has drawn in the past<br/>
few years, one might think that the potential interest in home-education is<br/>
far, far greater. Thousands of children are known to be damaged by their<br/>
school-attendance, many more children do not attend school for numerous<br/>
reasons. Many of those would be helped out of if their parents would only be<br/>
entitled to home-educate them.<br/>
<br/>
We, a group of home-educating parents in the Netherlands, want<br/>
home-education to become a legal option, its effectivity recognised by the<br/>
authorities, and most of all we want parents to exercise a free choice for<br/>
and with their children without unnecessary state interference.<br/>
<br/>
That is why we ask for your input. We know some members of parliament<br/>
sympathise with us, after having sent them tens of pages of arguments<br/>
against the minister&#39;s view, but all this input has come from a small group<br/>
of activists so far.<br/>
<br/>
So, after having sent them lots of info about reseach and different<br/>
legislative possibilities we need a lot of your messages to reach the hearts<br/>
of those MPs! Let them know that home-education has become an indication for<br/>
respect of human rights! Let them find out that home-education has grown to<br/>
a worldwide grass-roots movement of responsible families!<br/>
<br/>
Reading English is no problem for most Dutch people, knowledge of French and<br/>
German is also wide-spread here, so don&#39;t hesitate to express yourself in<br/>
your mother tongue. Perhaps you can include an English summary.<br/>
<br/>
Send mail<br/>
You can tell the Dutch legislators your own story and opinion using the URLs<br/>
you can find on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thuisonderwijs.net/support-nl/#samplemail">http://www.thuisonderwijs.net/support-nl/#samplemail</a> . Or<br/>
you can answer one or more survey questions like these:<br/>
<br/>
    - How and why does home-education work for you?<br/>
    - Is it a real and viable option in education? Why?<br/>
    - Does it work for you family? How?<br/>
    - Do you think a teaching certificate is necessary or useful for<br/>
home-educating parents?<br/>
    - Do you consider routinely held inspections useful or necessary?<br/>
    - What has been your own experience with inspections on your<br/>
home-education, if any?<br/>
<br/>
Quick Sample Mail<br/>
If you don&#39;t have the opportunity to write down your opinion in detail (we<br/>
know how busy home-educators always are!), then you can use our quick sample<br/>
email which includes the following text:<br/>
<br/>
    subject=Debate about home-education<br/>
<br/>
    Dear madam Minister, dear Committee members,<br/>
<br/>
Through this message we want to express our concern with the way how<br/>
home-education has been misjudged in The Netherlands so far. We urge you to<br/>
correct this judgement and to remove any obstacles in your law that still<br/>
prevent parents from exercising their responsibilities freely, with or<br/>
without the use of schools.<br/>
<br/>
Allowing home-education as such has become an indication of respect for<br/>
human rights and fundamental freedoms of both parents and children, since<br/>
its effectiveness has become clear beyond reasonable doubt. Please act in<br/>
accordance with this understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
your name and country<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Email addresses<br/>
Mails should be sent at the same time to the Educational committee of the<br/>
Dutch parliament and to the Minister of Education. A CC goes to our mail<br/>
