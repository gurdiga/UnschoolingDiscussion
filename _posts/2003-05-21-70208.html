  &gt;I couldn&#39;t help it.<br/>

  Were you lucky enough to get her shoes????  ;)  This sort of thing <br/>
  happened to my sister in 3rd grade.  What is UP with the power trip when <br/>
  a child needs to go to the bathroom?!<br/>
<br/>
  When I was in 4th grade my teacher told me that I couldn&#39;t go so I got <br/>
  up and ran out of the classroom and barely made it.  When I got back to <br/>
  my class the teacher had obviously announced that I was going to get the <br/>
  paddle because I disobeyed him.  I saw it in his hand and ran right back <br/>
  out of that room all the way to the principal&#39;s office and told him that <br/>
  I wanted to call my mom to pick me up because my teacher wanted to <br/>
  paddle me for using the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
  Lucky for me the principal just loved me and chewed the teacher out in <br/>
  front of me.  hee hee!  I did call my mom who came and got me and my dad <br/>
  left work when he got wind of it and told this guy he&#39;d &quot;kick his a$$&quot; <br/>
  if he so much as thought of touching me.  HA HA HA  That was so awesome! <br/>
  If only everyone could feel that their parents were on their side.<br/>

just sat there and took it.  <br/>

  When I was in junior high, one of our Gym requirements was that we had to <br/>
  climb the rope to the top of the very tall gym. We were graded on how high we <br/>
  got, and to get an A you had to touch the ceiling. I was terrified of the <br/>
  heights, and didn&#39;t have the upper body strength to do it anyway. <br/>
<br/>
  I was really upset that I was going to fail...GYM!!!!!  I told my parents, <br/>
  and the next day my father, who rarely got involved in the school stuff, called <br/>
  the gym teacher and told her that I would NOT be climbing the rope if I didn&#39;t <br/>
  feel comfortable doing it, and that I would NOT be punished for it.<br/>

&lt;&lt;When I was in junior high, one of our Gym requirements was that we had to<br/>

<br/>
When I went to a new school in 6th grade it was a lot different than my<br/>
small catholic town school. It was 20 miles away from home, I was one of 4<br/>
girls in the classroom and the place looked like a fortress. I came to love<br/>
that old building later. They had a huge indoor pool and swimming lessons<br/>
was a requirement there. The teacher was an old bat who had a voice that<br/>
would go right through you. She actually threw some kids in. I was terrified<br/>
and didn&#39;t know how to swim yet. I had come close to drowning as a kid and<br/>
never got over that. My skin would break out into huge open sores from the<br/>
anguish of having to swim. The boys would tease me about next week being at<br/>
the deep end. My mom went to the principal and pulled me out of class. Never<br/>
had to swim a stroke the whole 3 years I was there after that. The principal<br/>
couldn&#39;t understand how kids were dying to go to that school just for the<br/>
pool and here I was, NOT wanting it.<br/>
