<div id="ygrps-yiv-677128726">Lydia (12) went to a new class (part time) at her Montessori school yesterday.  She was not impressed with this teacher (neither was I) so has decided to come home again this year!  Yay!  Another chance to make home a better place than school!<br/>
<br/>
I really think the reason why Lydia went to school besides just being curious is so she could say she went to school (even tho it was part time).  She could complain about it with her friends, talk about how she couldn&#39;t wait until such and such break.  AND she could meet more kids her age. (Here in DSM, IA for some reason, MANY homeschoolers/unschoolers filter into the schools about middle school, especially the more social ones).<br/>
<br/>
My question for the list.  Yesterday when Lydia decided to stay home she said, I just hate saying I home school when people ask me where I go to school.  If she says unschool, they&#39;ll have no idea what she&#39;s even talking about.  We don&#39;t homeschool and I don&#39;t think she likes to label herself as one.  Just wondering if anyone else has run into this?<br/>
<br/>
One more thing.  Last year (Lyds first stint with PS) she was really conforming.  I&#39;ve noticed this year she&#39;s much more comfortable in her own skin again and just being herself, not afraid to be different. So, maybe there&#39;s my angle.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just excited that I get to hang with her again this year!  <br/>

You could come up with special terminology.   &quot;Tutored&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Personalized program&quot; or maybe a series of terms she could try on and  <br/>
re-use the ones she likes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Special exploratory program&quot;<br/>
&quot;Experimental experiential education|<br/>

We offer an outstanding educational opportunity providing a natural <br/>
learning environment, extensive real-world experience, flexibility of <br/>
schedule, and the ability to respond to the specific needs and <br/>
inclinations of the child. Each student’s program is developmentally <br/>
appropriate, integrated and fully individualized, and continually built <br/>
upon student strengths and interests throughout the year.<br/>
