&gt; have <br/>
&gt; &quot;tricks&quot; that they pull out in order to be more entertaining. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I only like the tricks, none of the other stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Well, that might be an exaggeration, but give me a physics teacher who <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; propelhimself across the room on a cart using a fire extingisher, and I <br/>
&gt; remember it for life.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah - that&#39;s not what I meant by &quot;tricks&quot; -- tricks in a science class are <br/>
science. Some of you may not have seen this - but at the college where I <br/>
teach they give a workshop in &quot;humor in the classroom&quot; (which is a GOOD thing <br/>
- I&#39;m the queen of the bad puns during my lectures - so don&#39;t get me wrong, <br/>
I&#39;m not opposed to laughter). But there are all these teachers who just stuck <br/>
in some little &quot;act&quot; - maybe that&#39;s better than that the word &quot;trick&quot; -- and <br/>
the result is just annoying if you&#39;re there to learn something from them.<br/>
<br/>
I meant things that have absolutely nothing to do with the class - at least <br/>
the teacher isn&#39;t connecting them in any way -- (I&#39;m sure we could come up <br/>
with &quot;connections&quot;). There is an English teacher who pretends to have a flea <br/>
circus in a little box and every so often she picks up the box and gives some <br/>
running commentary on what the fleas are doing. She just thinks she&#39;s <br/>
hilarious and that that is &quot;using humor in the classroom.&quot;  I know another <br/>
instructor who teaches nursing courses where I teach who blows bubbles in <br/>
class - she has this little bubble thing that you squeeze and some creature <br/>
pops up and it is the bubble wand and you blow through it to make bubbles. <br/>
She does that every time somebody answers a question correctly. These are <br/>
adult college students in these classes and it isn&#39;t really funny - they are <br/>
mostly insulted. Maybe what I&#39;m complaining about is just that the attempt at <br/>
humor is stuck in so unnaturally -- when they get &quot;taught&quot; that they should <br/>
use humor in the classroom, they can&#39;t carry it off and it is just annoying.<br/>

<br/>
OH! Flea circuses and bubbles would have irritated me even as a kid.<br/>
<br/>
I meant surprising, visually memorable schtick.  (I don&#39;t know of a word in <br/>
English, which must be why we&#39;ve adopted the Yiddish for it.)  Anything that <br/>
just sounds like droning on and people taking notes scares me.  Even those <br/>
who can learn from lectures and love to take artsy notes are getting <br/>
brain-numbness from those.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how people who&#39;ve actually lived through lectures and <br/>
note-taking can claim TV as the prime culprit in mind-numbification.<br/>
<br/>
I want sparkly bubbly INTELLIGENT people who are saying/doing/showing things <br/>
that I will take home and think about, which are accessed in more than one wa<br/>
y in my head, which can easily meld into my own idea-cooker.  I would rather <br/>
see a live butterfly than hear someone tell me they saw one once, and sketch <br/>
the outline on a whiteboard, I don&#39;t care HOW well they draw, or what pretty <br/>
colors they use.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
