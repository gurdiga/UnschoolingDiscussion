 </span></blockquote>Carol, here&#39;s a big hug for you, as I am starting to cry! My only son turns<br/>
7 today, and I see him growing up (an away) sooo fast. (I think he spoke to<br/>
me twice last night at his birthday party, as he rollerbladed away with his<br/>
friends.) I am going to email your post to a friend so she can cry too. LOL <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing, and don&#39;t ever stop thinking with your heart!<br/>
<br/>
