Yes, and she&#39;s kind enough to visit strangers in the hospital.  Well I was <br/>
KIND of strange.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165465017">Shucks, that&#39;s awful sweet of you folks!  It was just the stuff I needed to <br/>
hear after driving a total of an hour and a quarter to drive a little guy <br/>
home.  He had planned to spend the night with us and then at about 9:30 <br/>
p.m. or so decided he&#39;d rather go home, which is a half to three quarters <br/>
of an hour&#39;s drive from our home.  I felt sleepy and in a generally funky <br/>
mood when I walked back in the door carrying a 50-pound bundle of <br/>
still-sweet-smelling sleeping boy.  Did you know that kids gain 20 pounds <br/>
when they&#39;re sleeping?  It&#39;s amazing but true!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks, folks, for being there to cheer me up, even when you didn&#39;t <br/>
know I was in need of cheering.  Now *that&#39;s* what I call intuition!!<br/>
<br/>
With love and gratitude,<br/>
<br/>

surgery. ;-) Ahhh....anesthesia. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
