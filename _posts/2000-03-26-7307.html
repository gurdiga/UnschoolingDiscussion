<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768919504">Hi,<br/>
I know a girl named Kira, she&#39;s in her late twenties.  Looks to have an <br/>
Indian background, although I&#39;m not sure.  I babysat her daughter, but her <br/>
dad had custody so I really didn&#39;t know her well.  I have always loved her <br/>
name.<br/>
