<div id="ygrps-yiv-208604963"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The Princess Bride (now there&#39;s a good film...)<br/>
&gt;Tracy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Love it, own it!   I can quote the entire thing as<br/>
well.  <br/>
Indigo Montoya, to the man in black climbing the<br/>
cliffs below him  &quot;Hello down there...you do not think<br/>
you could...speed things up?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re in SUCH a hurry you could lower a rope or a<br/>
tree branch or something!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I do not think you will accept my help, since I am<br/>
only waiting around to kill you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That does put a damper on our relationship.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love Monty Python&#39;s Quest for the Holy Grail.  It&#39;s<br/>
hilarious when the chaste Sir Galahad stumbles across<br/>
the castle full of frustrated virgins.  The Black<br/>
Knight Scene, and the Viscious Rabbit scene are<br/>
classic Monty Python.<br/>
<br/>
We also really enjoy action fantasy and sci fi, like<br/>
the Matrix, 13th Warrior, Long Kiss Goodnight, Enemy<br/>
of the State, Stargate, Armegeddon, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As for guys in movies, I really like Harrison Ford,<br/>
Sean Connery, Brendan Frasier and Wil Smith.  But I<br/>
MOST go for the more quiet, shy or broody types -<br/>
Gabriel Byrne, Tim Robbins, Ben Affleck, Jimmy<br/>
Stewart, James Spader, David Duchnovney-(who everyone<br/>
says looks just like my husband!  :-)) Val Kilmer,<br/>
Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson.  Gary Oldman in Bram<br/>
Stoker&#39;s Dracula is to DIE for!  LOL  We am also<br/>
anxiously awaiting the Mummy Returns.  The previews<br/>
look Awesome!<br/>
<br/>
Some of my favorite actresses are Minnie Driver, Drew<br/>
Barrymore, Sandra Bullock, Jodi Foster, Audrey<br/>
Hepburn, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder, and Clair Danes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383103989">Last year, during my kids&#39; King Arthur phase, I got<br/>
them that movie. It&#39;s one of my all-time favorites. I<br/>
was the Killer Rabbit for Halloween once. My date was<br/>
King Arthur. :) The kids are CONSTANTLY acting out<br/>
scenes from that movie. They don&#39;t understand why teh<br/>
Virgins want to get spanked. I just told them, uh,<br/>
they&#39;re weird, right? Well, they&#39;re SO weird they<br/>
thing it would be fun if Sir Galahad spanked them.<br/>
They now feel they understand, as of course, they<br/>
agree anyone would have to be weird to want a<br/>
spanking. ;) Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234064513">&lt;&lt; Do you know &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead&quot;? Gary in Shakespearean <br/>
costume.  Woohoo!!  It was out of print two years ago when I checked.  I <br/>

<br/>
Heads it&#39;s in, tails it&#39;s not. We saw it recently and Meredith (who is more <br/>
of a Shakespeare buff than I am) loved it. (And had to explain some of it to <br/>
me.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested to know what anybody thinks of &quot;1776&quot;? We just watched it <br/>
again, and have the CD. I like to hear &quot;Cool, Considerate Men&quot;, I think it&#39;s <br/>
called. Meredith says the actor who played John Adams, also played Mr. Feeney <br/>
on &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, where the school was John Adams High.<br/>
<br/>
And remember Holling from &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;? He played Rutledge of South <br/>
Carolina, (in the video) and sings &quot;Molasses to Rum&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My good friend, the music teacher, hates 1776, but I&#39;ve come to like it. <br/>
Meredith watches it a lot. :) It grows on you. No &quot;hotties&quot; to discuss in <br/>
this one, I guess.<br/>

The boys watched it several times a couple of times we rented it years ago.  <br/>
Holly might like it.    She&#39;s our musicals-expert anyway.<br/>
