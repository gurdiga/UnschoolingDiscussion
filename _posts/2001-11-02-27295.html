<div id="ygrps-yiv-852534830">Below I&#39;m pasting the announcement about the new book I&#39;m working on.<br/>
I&#39;m depending on the kindness of friends and great networkers to help<br/>
me get the word out into all the hsing community nooks and crannies<br/>
that I would otherwise miss. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll be able to share it on the lists you&#39;re on wherever you<br/>
deem appropriate. Please pardon duplicates you may receive.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
Best to you and yours,<br/>

<br/>
Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
After three long years I have convinced a publisher that the<br/>
homeschooling community has the ability and desire to create the<br/>
ultimate &quot;learning ideas&quot; book, a much needed alternative or supplement<br/>
to traditional learning methods.<br/>
<br/>
The goal? To gather in one place the neatest, coolest, cheapest,<br/>
weirdest, quickest, funniest, most exotic, exciting, and fun learning<br/>
activities we homeschooling families have created ? or joyfully<br/>
stumbled<br/>
upon ? outside of or alongside text book studies. We&#39;ll be focusing on<br/>
ideas for use with (about) 3- to 12-year-olds.<br/>
<br/>
Your participation, as always, is warmly invited ? simply send an email<br/>
to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ldobson@...">ldobson@...</a> with &quot;Idea Book&quot; as the subject. In return<br/>
you&#39;ll receive all of the information you need to submit your greatest<br/>
ideas, and my everlasting gratitude. Additionally, there&#39;s a copy of<br/>
the<br/>
book for those contributors who submit five or more published ideas.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, though, we&#39;ll help put the joy and fun of learning<br/>
into even more children&#39;s lives, and that will be a gift to them that<br/>
keeps on giving.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to share this announcement on other lists where you<br/>
think it is appropriate. I look forward to hearing from you!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Linda<br/>
