<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But are you wanting to suggest that unschooling won&#39;t work for them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have to always keep in mind that not EVERYTHING will work for EVERYONE,<br/>
we<br/>
are not stepford families after all and unschooling MIGHT not work for every<br/>
single child, no matter how hard someone wants it to.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I disagree. I have yet to meet a child for whom unschooling would not work.<br/>
I have met many families and parents who I think are incapable (or, maybe<br/>
more accurately, just unwilling) to assist their children in successful<br/>
unschooling, but I think &quot;learning through true interest and/or need&quot; is a<br/>
good definition of &quot;human&quot;. I think unschooling will &quot;work&quot; (and here<br/>
perhaps we need to establish a definition for what we mean by &quot;unschooling<br/>
is working for this child&quot;) for every single child, if they are given the<br/>
real chance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533136113">OK, so along the lines of this,  Do you feel that a grade school child is<br/>
better off being schooled at home with a curriculum if the parent isn&#39;t<br/>
willing or able to be an unschooling facilitator for their child?  If the<br/>
parent is too busy to read to the kids much, to take them to the library, to<br/>
sit and play games with them, to seek out books they think the kid might<br/>
like, to take time to answer their questions or find answers to their<br/>
questions, etc. are they better off with a curriculum?<br/>
 <br/>
Do you feel the forced curriculum would do more harm than the kid being left<br/>
to his own devices?<br/>
 <br/>
I have thought this through some and I can&#39;t really decided which would be<br/>
better in those circumstances.  In my mind, I try to put myself in other<br/>
people&#39;s shoes to figure out what I would do under those circumstances, but<br/>
I am not sure.  <br/>
 <br/>
I can see the one pro for leaving them to their own devices would be not<br/>
killing their love of learning but on the other hand, at least with a<br/>
curriculum they get some one on one with their parent that they might not<br/>
get otherwise.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really bad at &quot;choice between two bad choices&quot; in my own real life and I<br/>
expect I&#39;m no better at it for a hypothetical family. :)<br/>
<br/>
It would depend (yes, I know that&#39;s not a terribly useful answer &lt;g&gt;) on the<br/>
child&#39;s temperament, on the parent&#39;s, on the child&#39;s wish to be away from<br/>
school or at school, on the quality of/relationship with a given teacher in<br/>
a given year vs. the relationship the parent has with the child, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If the child hates curriculum, for example, is it better for him to hate it<br/>
administered by the hands of strangers or by his own parent? Is it better<br/>
for him to live with his parent actually forcing him, or to live with the<br/>
knowledge that his parent is willingly helping someone else to force him?<br/>
<br/>
Or, if the child doesn&#39;t hate curriculum and pretty much goes along with the<br/>
program, is it better for him to learn to pretty much go along with the<br/>
program at home (which for me depends on where HE wants to be and the<br/>
quality of the relationship with the parent playing teacher) or to learn<br/>
that at school (which for me depends on where HE wants to be and the quality<br/>
of the relationship with his teacher(s) at said school).<br/>
<br/>
All of this means: I dunno. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
It depends. If there isn&#39;t a good relationship at home then the child is<br/>
better off at school. If the child has problems with standard school work,<br/>
bringing school home doesn&#39;t allow the child to escape home from it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the question to ask is where will that particular child be happier.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475903336">I guess I was too vague, but I hesitate to give all the details on a public<br/>
list.  I did mean schooled at home.  The family of which I am speaking<br/>
schools-at-home.  They know about unschooling (not radical unschooling) and<br/>
thinks it can certainly work and that it works for my family, but don&#39;t feel<br/>
like it can work for them because the mom feels like the end of the day<br/>
always comes and she hasn&#39;t interacted with her kids much in a way that they<br/>
might learn something because she is too busy with the littler ones.  She<br/>
has a pretty good relationship with her kids and it isn&#39;t too much of a<br/>
battle to get them to do the school work, but they already think of it as<br/>
(eye roll from the kids) *yuck!  school work!*  I guess the answer is really<br/>
what works for their family.  <br/>
 <br/>
(sigh) I wish I could help other people to see that they *could* unschool if<br/>
they wanted to.  <br/>

<br/>
Depends why the kid&#39;s not in school.<br/>
<br/>
If the child has something about him or her that makes school dangerous or <br/>
out of the question, then a curriculum might beat being in school, even if <br/>
the child is left to try to figure out the curriculum on his or her own.  I <br/>
could have done that when I was a kid.  If I had a physical disfigurement (to <br/>
use a fictitious example) and going to school would mean nothing but people <br/>
staring at me and tormenting me, I might be better off at home.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent is unable to be attentive and imaginative and patient, but school <br/>
isn&#39;t a better option...  I would have other questions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If the<br/>
parent is too busy to read to the kids much, to take them to the library, to<br/>
sit and play games with them, to seek out books they think the kid might<br/>
like, to take time to answer their questions or find answers to their<br/>
questions, etc. are they better off with a curriculum?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why is that parent thinking she has time to do school-at-home, without time <br/>
to unschool?<br/>
There are still sitting and library and answers issues with or without a <br/>
curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you feel the forced curriculum would do more harm than the kid being left<br/>
to his own devices?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends on the kid.<br/>
<br/>
A really active, imaginative kid left to her own devices could devise a lot!<br/>
A wounded, scared, irritated kid might be better off with a curriculum, <br/>
because IF this child has a parent home unable or unwilling to help, but <br/>
unwilling to send him to school, that kid is living with some kind of serious <br/>
problem, and might want to have the means to get the knowledge and options he <br/>
needs to get out of there as soon as possible, which might could be early <br/>
graduation from some correspondence high school or some such.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It depends&quot; is my best answer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

They&#39;re friends and one family unschools and the other does school at <br/>
home. The unschooling mom has the other kids at her house occasionally <br/>
and she does something very very nice, imo. She takes the time to <br/>
actually write up what the kids do at her house - putting it in <br/>
&quot;learrning&quot; terms - so that the other mom can appreciate it. Over time, <br/>
the other mom is more likely to be able to envision how she could also <br/>
do it.<br/>
