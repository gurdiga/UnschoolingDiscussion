<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982075859">I&#39;m about sick to death of our repeated meals (the five that please most of the family). And <br/>
even within that five, there are only two that everyone in the family will eat (Mexican and <br/>
black beans/or lentils with rice).<br/>
<br/>
I am not an exotic cook. We&#39;re talking kids who won&#39;t eat baked potatoes, spaghetti, oven <br/>
baked chicken and tonight, meatloaf!<br/>
<br/>
I want so much to make interesting food again (like I did when we were younger and my <br/>
kids were either toddler eaters or breastfeeders). I miss flavor and variety. My kids are just <br/>
driving me batty. They won&#39;t even eat sandwiches and yet every single week we go to a co-<br/>
op that requires a bagged lunch. I started making my old stand-by (pasta salad) which is a <br/>
favorite with the family... except my 10 yr old. So he never wants that for Monday lunch. <br/>
Even during the week, I cook lunch every day because no one will eat the normal American <br/>
lunch foods.<br/>
<br/>
For co-op, they basically take chips and a drink. Isn&#39;t that pathetic!? If I make pasta salad, <br/>
then the 13 yr old will take it but the 8 yr old will take it and not eat it. We get home from <br/>
co-op and they are understandably ravenous. They complain all afternoon until dinner <br/>
which they sometimes barely eat. I might put out cheese and apple slices, peanut butter <br/>
and crackers. Nope. Not good enough. They will end up eating microwave popcorn if I <br/>
have it or chips. I can&#39;t afford to have chips and popcorn as their primary food stuff!<br/>
<br/>
Dinner is becoming such a depressing time for me. How many times a week can we eat <br/>
Mexican, pizza and black beans with rice? They do love these foods and will eat them. But <br/>
I&#39;m so sick of them. If I make chicken, my 17 yr old won&#39;t eat it. Chicken and potatoes is a <br/>
sure fire way for him to starve. If I make chicken soup, the younger two won&#39;t eat it. If I <br/>
make stir-fry, two fo the boys won&#39;t eat it. If I make anything with too many vegetables, <br/>
none of them will eat it. I make chili once a week to help me on Thursday nights when I go <br/>
to grad school, I have to make a special kind for my vegetarian daughter (15) and my 10 yr <br/>
old boy won&#39;t eat either kind.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tearing my hair out.<br/>
<br/>
I love to make stew in winter, but only Jon and I will eat that.<br/>
<br/>
Even something simple like over fried chicken and french fries isn&#39;t universally received. <br/>
And now that my dd is vegetarian, she can&#39;t eat almost anything I make. I end up having to <br/>
make her different food every night. She hardly eats lunch any more (she won&#39;t eat <br/>
sandwiches like PB and J or cream cheese and ?). She will eat some of the meatless frozen <br/>
stuff but gets bored easily. She doesn&#39;t complain really, but she is half starving all the time <br/>
and ends up eating Ritz crackers and ice cream. Hardly a healthy diet!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so discouraged and sick to death of our meals. When my mom was here I made this <br/>
gorgeous Nicoise salad with real Ahi tuna and felt I had died and gone to heaven. If I put <br/>
all the effort in to make that meal, I will be the only person in the whole family to eat it <br/>
and be full. I know I can &quot;cook what I want to eat&quot; but I still have to contend with hungry <br/>
people who forage through my cupboards and complain all day that they are hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else struggle with the food factor?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really angry tonight. I made a really tasty meal and no one ate it. What a waste of <br/>
shopping, money and effort. I was going to make dessert but I don&#39;t have the heart to <br/>
create something tasty to have everyone opt for ice cream and turn their noses up at what <br/>
I prepare.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to whine, but food prep takes up such a huge percentage of my life and I hate that I <br/>
can&#39;t please a critical mass of people more often. Some days it just drains my enthusiasm <br/>
for the other hours of the day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14498047">Julie....I hear your anger and pain. Somewhere along the line, we&#39;ve <br/>
become short order cooks and it&#39;s killing me too. Now that my kids <br/>
are older, I quit cooking because of the same problem you <br/>
have....they wouldn&#39;t eat what I fixed and would not have it as a <br/>
leftover the next meal or day. <br/>
<br/>
I feel so badly about this but I&#39;m tired of wasting food. <br/>
<br/>
I thought we were the only ones to eat microwave popcorn for a meal. <br/>
This is so not funny. Sara in NC</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094594128">For what it&#39;s worth....here&#39;s what works for our family, which includes one<br/>
vegetarian teen and a hubby who can&#39;t eat tomato sauces.<br/>
I always have lots of cheap do-it-yourself options available (mac & cheese,<br/>
bagels, ramen soup, instant potatoes, cans of soup)...as long as there&#39;s no<br/>
mess for me and no one says anything negative about my food, they are free<br/>
to make something else.  I encourage the younger ones to at least taste what<br/>
I make.<br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of prep and let the family do the final fixings. For example, for<br/>
tacos I have soft and hard shells, meat, beans and the usual fixings all in<br/>
bowls. Everyone makes their favorites.<br/>
Spaghetti: I make pasta of some kind, Open a jar of regular sauce, a jar of<br/>
white sauce, a bowl of pre-cooked meatballs or ground meat, shredded<br/>
cheese...everyone puts together their own plate.<br/>
Pizza: I use English muffins, I put sauce on (except for hubby&#39;s), and have<br/>
bowls of fixings...everyone comes and makes however many they want, with<br/>
what they want. I get the works (onions, pepperoni, gr. peppers, olives,<br/>
garlic....)<br/>
I do salads the same way. Throw the lettuce in a bowl and have fixings on<br/>
the side.<br/>
<br/>
I also consider it a success if at least three of us like whatever I make.<br/>
If I&#39;m going to make a roast or soup, I just make sure I have some good<br/>
bread and veggies and cheese available on the side.   And since I would<br/>
never want to be forced to eat something I don&#39;t like, I don&#39;t force my<br/>
kids...and try not to be bothered. It&#39;s easier now.  They are all pretty<br/>
self-sufficient and willing to try new things. And finally after years of<br/>
thinking it wouldn&#39;t happen they mostly appreciate the cooking that I do (on<br/>
the other hand...maybe they&#39;re just glad I cook some days.....I can get<br/>
pretty bad about it some weeks!)  They also do some of the cooking which<br/>
takes the pressure off of me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788954963">Julie, how frustrating for you!<br/>
<br/>
After Jayn started eating solids, I became irritated by having to prepare<br/>
only three different things (and hers were nothing) as I was a vegetarian<br/>
but dh was not. I have a small inkling of what you are feeling, although by<br/>
no means did I have as much to deal with. I ended up changing my eating to<br/>
fit with him, just because it was simpler for me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m about sick to death of our repeated meals (the five that please<br/>
most of the family). And <br/>
even within that five, there are only two that everyone in the family will<br/>
eat (Mexican and <br/>
black beans/or lentils with rice).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where I live in Los Angeles there are so many options for Mexican food<br/>
available in the supermarket including almost instant refried beans, and<br/>
lots of frozen stuff and takeouts. Maybe you could have more of that<br/>
available that the older kids could at least toss in the microwave if they<br/>
didn&#39;t like the meal you are cooking for dh and yourself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They will end up eating microwave popcorn if I <br/>
have it or chips. I can&#39;t afford to have chips and popcorn as their primary<br/>
food stuff!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn goes through periods when she wants to eat microwave popcorn several<br/>
times a day. The same with chips. I find it only lasts a few days. I get the<br/>
snack size packs, which still make a sizeable portion, and there is less<br/>
waste. If anyone knows of a way to &quot;keep&quot; the popped popcorn fresh I would<br/>
love to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Dinner is becoming such a depressing time for me. How many times a week<br/>
can we eat <br/>
Mexican, pizza and black beans with rice? They do love these foods and will<br/>
eat them. But <br/>
I&#39;m so sick of them. If I make chicken, my 17 yr old won&#39;t eat it. Chicken<br/>
and potatoes is a <br/>
sure fire way for him to starve..... snip..... <br/>
And now that my dd is vegetarian, she can&#39;t eat almost anything I make. I<br/>
end up having to <br/>
make her different food every night. She hardly eats lunch any more (she<br/>
won&#39;t eat sandwiches like PB and J or cream cheese and ?). She will eat some<br/>
of the meatless frozen stuff but gets bored easily. She doesn&#39;t complain<br/>
really, but she is half starving all the time and ends up eating Ritz<br/>
crackers and ice cream. Hardly a healthy diet!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A short period of a less than optimum diet won&#39;t really hurt these older<br/>
kids, especially if they take some vitamins.<br/>
<br/>
I want to suggest that it might help to turn responsibility for their own<br/>
food over to the two older ones. They are old enough to do at least some of<br/>
their own cooking surely. What if they went with you to the store and had<br/>
their own buggies that they could use to buy the food that they will eat -<br/>
perhaps hand them the portion of the family budget that would encompass<br/>
their meals normally as the way for them to pay. Then they get to choose it<br/>
and deal with it at home. I expect microwave meals might take up a good<br/>
proportion of it - at least at first. <br/>
<br/>
If it works out that they love this arrangement at least part of your<br/>
problem is solved. If it works out that this becomes really difficult, then<br/>
at least they might gain an appreciation for the efforts you have been<br/>
making! <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I still have to contend with hungry <br/>
people who forage through my cupboards and complain all day that they are<br/>
hungry.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t they their cupboards too? I hope you can find some detachment to<br/>
their complaints. My dh gets complaining like that sometimes - he is pretty<br/>
picky, compared to me anyway - so I know it is hard not to take it as some<br/>
kind of personal criticism. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m really angry tonight. I made a really tasty meal and no one ate it.<br/>
What a waste of shopping, money and effort. I was going to make dessert but<br/>
I don&#39;t have the heart to create something tasty to have everyone opt for<br/>
ice cream and turn their noses up at what I prepare.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(((((Julie)))))<br/>
As someone who is a mediocre cook at best, I would love the opportunity to<br/>
not cook. I wish you could come over here and cook for me - believe me you<br/>
would get enormous amounts of appreciation!!<br/>

<br/>
It does sound tough.<br/>
<br/>
What comes to mind for me is that apparently the kids don&#39;t mind <br/>
repetition the way you do.  Therefore, I&#39;d be inclined to feed them <br/>
leftover black beans and rice or pizza on some nights on which you cook <br/>
what you like for yourself.  If your kids are eating these foods and <br/>
maybe some fruit (or even juice) then they are probably covering their <br/>
nutritional needs.<br/>
<br/>
Is it the salt that makes the popcorn so appealing?  Or the butter?  <br/>
Would putting more salt and butter in other foods help &quot;sell&quot; them?<br/>

<br/>
Almost all my favorite foods have tomato in them, so when my husband <br/>
started having heartburn and avoiding tomatoes my desire to cook really <br/>
plummeted.</div>

Could you ask each family member to come up with five meals that they would  <br/>
eat?  Full meals, not just the entree.  Then compile them, make a list  and <br/>
let each family member say what they absolutely would not eat under any  <br/>
circumstances.<br/>
 <br/>
Then use the pared down list (assuming you will get more than five meal  <br/>
choices), then post a weekly menu of sorts so that each person knows what you  <br/>
will be serving.  If it&#39;s someone&#39;s favorite and another simply is not  going to <br/>
eat it, then there might be a way of having a side dish that is filling  for <br/>
that person, or have them make themselves a simple meal they will  enjoy.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure it is extra hard when there are so many dislikes but maybe if they  <br/>
feel they have a part in the planning they&#39;ll be more inclined to eat the <br/>
meals,  even if it isn&#39;t their favorite.<br/>

they won&#39;t eat anyway now?<br/>

 Maybe you could have more of that<br/>
&gt; available that the older kids could at least toss in the microwave if they<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t like the meal you are cooking for dh and yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I need to do this more. I&#39;m probably just over-reacting to Mexican, but being from LA <br/>
myself and now transplanted into Ohio, the Mexican just isn&#39;t the same. :) although we are <br/>
getting our own Trader Joe&#39;s in town in November so that will be a big help! As it is, we eat <br/>
burritos at least once a week for dinner and Quesadillas for lunch most days!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to suggest that it might help to turn responsibility for their own<br/>
&gt; food over to the two older ones. They are old enough to do at least some of<br/>
&gt; their own cooking surely. <br/>
<br/>
They are, but they won&#39;t. My oldest will just not eat or eat cereal. And the vegetarian <br/>
daughter doesn&#39;t like vegetables! (Of all things). She&#39;s perfectly willing to microwave her <br/>
stuff, but she just isn&#39;t eating very well so I get concerned over that. Both don&#39;t like <br/>
cooking at all.<br/>
<br/>
What if they went with you to the store and had<br/>
&gt; their own buggies that they could use to buy the food that they will eat -<br/>
&gt; perhaps hand them the portion of the family budget that would encompass<br/>
&gt; their meals normally as the way for them to pay.<br/>
<br/>
That might be interesting!<br/>
<br/>
 Then they get to choose it<br/>
&gt; and deal with it at home. I expect microwave meals might take up a good<br/>
&gt; proportion of it - at least at first. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it works out that they love this arrangement at least part of your<br/>
&gt; problem is solved. If it works out that this becomes really difficult, then<br/>
&gt; at least they might gain an appreciation for the efforts you have been<br/>
&gt; making! <br/>
<br/>
Lol! At least that sounds like a win-win.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I still have to contend with hungry <br/>
&gt; people who forage through my cupboards and complain all day that they are<br/>
&gt; hungry.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Aren&#39;t they their cupboards too? <br/>
<br/>
I knew when I typed that someone on this list would remind me of that principle! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can find some detachment to<br/>
&gt; their complaints.<br/>
<br/>
Now you&#39;ve got what was behind it. I feel like it&#39;s my hard work that is being judged every <br/>
time they look for what they want to eat and don&#39;t find it. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t buy them <br/>
what they enjoy. It&#39;s that since they aren&#39;t eating decent meals, all the &quot;snack&quot; foods don&#39;t <br/>
last between trips to the store. So there is a rummaging effect that drains me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (((((Julie)))))<br/>
&gt; As someone who is a mediocre cook at best, I would love the opportunity to<br/>
&gt; not cook. I wish you could come over here and cook for me - believe me you<br/>
&gt; would get enormous amounts of appreciation!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh I wish I could! Would love to meet you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did buck up and make Warm Fall Pear and Plum Streusel for dessert with vanilla ice cream <br/>
and it was a hit so at least everyone ate that. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your encouragement.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi, Julie.  It sounds like somewhere along the line to an unschooling<br/>
lifestyle, you got appointed to be the family kitchen servant. <br/>
Perhaps my approach is less unschool, and more old school, but it<br/>
works pretty well for us, most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
I love cooking -- and I love to explore different cuisines.  My<br/>
feelings aren&#39;t hurt if somebody doesn&#39;t like what I&#39;ve made, and I&#39;m<br/>
often my own harshest critic.  I do usually ask that the kids all at<br/>
least try what I&#39;ve made, before they make faces and declare &quot;yuck!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they can&#39;t abide what I&#39;ve cooked, they&#39;re welcome to head off to<br/>
the kitchen to make themselves a PBJ or nuke a hot dog or whatever. <br/>
But I don&#39;t run a restaurant, and I don&#39;t much take dinner orders.  I<br/>
do try to shape the menu around the preferences of my family members,<br/>
but if someone&#39;s trying out vegetarian, they may get to fend for<br/>
themselves if dw and/or I get a hankering for steak.<br/>
<br/>
We host exchange students, so we get a variety of food preferences<br/>
over the years.  One year we hosted a Muslim, so I avoided pork, out<br/>
of respect for her sensitivity to its smell.  The next year, we had a<br/>
student who was avoiding beef, being fresh from the European mad cow<br/>
situation.  I adapted and adjusted.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has to work for everyone in the family -- and that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that it should make *you* work for everyone in the family.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing about my approach is that, while we eat a pretty<br/>
widely varied (and usually very healthy) diet, I hardly ever see<br/>
someone flatly refuse what I&#39;ve made (even the five-year-old), and do<br/>
the PBJ routine.  (There have been a few spectacular failures that<br/>
have been set aside by unanimous consent, but those are pretty rare. <br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
Best of all, I get to enjoy sharing my hobby with the family, and they<br/>
get a sense of how people in other parts of the world might eat.  (I<br/>
do remind them that much of what we sample from other cuisines is<br/>
feast food, and that they probably don&#39;t eat this way very often.) <br/>
Cooking is not a chore, but a joy, and mealtimes are less a struggle<br/>
than what you&#39;re describing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566983785">Hi Julie:<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you were having a rough day when you wrote this! Maybe <br/>
you&#39;re trying to hard to find common ground instead of looking at it <br/>
as reorganizing the way you plan your families meals.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I try to do is to plan my menu for the week.  I call all <br/>
the kids in to go over the menu.  This gives me an idea of who is <br/>
going to eat what so I don&#39;t have a big surprise at the dinner <br/>
table.  And I think that you just have to accept that on any given <br/>
night there will be one or two who aren&#39;t going to eat what&#39;s <br/>
prepared, so I ask them what they would like in substitute that <br/>
night.  We also try to cover all the times that they will need <br/>
snacks or brownbag meals outside of the house and what they want.  <br/>
It&#39;s almost like I get a mini-shopping list from each of the kids <br/>
and it works out really well.  That way I&#39;m not guessing what they <br/>
want and there isn&#39;t as much waste or want.  So I guess what I&#39;m <br/>
advising is that you take some of the pressure off yourself and get <br/>
your kids more involved in making the weekly menu planning choices.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like a food diary when you are dieting - you don&#39;t <br/>
actually see what you are eating sometimes till you write it down.  <br/>
With the menu planning, you sometimes see what the kids WON&#39;T be <br/>
eating and you can adjust accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
I also find that making a few staples ahead of time, say on Sunday, <br/>
like stew, chili, a homemade salsa, a big precut salad selection in <br/>
seperate containers and a big tomato gravy (with meatballs) and <br/>
container of pasta will generally fill in all the gaps for everyone <br/>
at some point during the week (and take care of dinner that night, <br/>
too).  And if you get good and organized about it, it doesn&#39;t take <br/>
that long to put all that together in one afternoon, it&#39;s even a <br/>
good chance to get some of the kids that like cooking in the <br/>
kitchen, too.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

squash almost every week. He loved it and would eat it even if we had other foods for <br/>
dinner he didn&#39;t like. I felt great knowing he was getting his veggies. :)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I ought to try exotic desserts for dinner and offer meat for dessert? ;-) At least <br/>
them I wouldn&#39;t feel like I was wasting the &quot;whole&quot; meal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399314013">I hadn&#39;t made chicken and dumplings since I had had children (and years <br/>
before that) but I did make it a couple of months ago and they really liked it, all <br/>
of them.  I&#39;ve made it three more times. &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;ll get tired of it, but <br/>
it&#39;s cheap and easy and makes the house smell good.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been using the chicken strips you can get at Costco (so all white meat <br/>
and easy to prepare).  I cook it a bit first and then cut it up, but if you <br/>
just simmer it for several hours it will fall apart on its own.    I start with <br/>
onion and garlic in a little oil, add water (used chicken broth a couple of <br/>
times, but that&#39;s not necessary), salt and pepper.   Chicken.  When the chicken <br/>
is cooked, add balls of biscuit dough.  I&#39;ve made my own and used canned and <br/>
the family doesn&#39;t care one way or another so far, it seems).<br/>
<br/>
Let those be there at least an hour.  The broth will get thick after a while.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good leftover, you can freeze it in small portions, and if you run out <br/>
of dumplings (Holly pretty much only likes that part) you might put leftover <br/>
rice in it.  That worked here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A platter of things to eat with toothpicks has been well received here over <br/>
the years, if the kids are bored and haven&#39;t had much variety.  Little cubes  <br/>
of meat maybe, or sections of hot dog, but for sure chunks of pineapple, cheese <br/>
and apple.   Maybe grapes or cherries (cut in half if you want them to get to <br/>
use the toothpicks).  <br/>
<br/>
Platters of sandwiches cut in quarters seem less intimidating than a whole <br/>
big sandwich to which a child has to feel a commitment (or pass-or-play).  A <br/>
quarter of a sandwich isn&#39;t too daunting, and if it&#39;s good they&#39;ll get more, and <br/>
if not the adults can finish it off.  <br/>
<br/>
Cream cheese goes well with unexpected things.  Keith taught me peanut <br/>
butter, cream cheese and honey sandwiches (plain cream cheese cut thin from blocks) <br/>
and I added sliced green grapes, for summer sandwiches).   Kirby created a mix <br/>
when he was a kid that still appears from time to time here:  tuna mixed with <br/>
pineapple cream cheese.  Sounds gross but is truly good for sandwiches or on <br/>
crackers.<br/>
<br/>
Little open-faced English-muffin things with melted cheese can be fun.  <br/>
&quot;Pizzas&quot; kind of.<br/>

<br/>
Dylan likes a salad (like chicken salad) made with tempeh.  <br/>
He also likes scrambled tofu rolled up in a tortilla with olives and<br/>
salsa. <br/>

***She doesn&#39;t complain really, but she is half starving all the time and<br/>

<br/>
Will she eat cheese with the crackers?   If she doesn&#39;t like peanut<br/>

Does she like nuts?   You can add them to salads and stir fry, oat meal,<br/>

Maybe if they get to plan a meal, shop for it and help prepare it, then they will be open to other things.  They could take turns.   If not, I usually have something in the fridge to offer up with my uhm, discriminating eater.  I get sick of his food too.  So, often I buy him a frozen kid meal and we eat something we like.  It&#39;s easier with one, I&#39;m sure it is much more challenging with more kids.<br/>

I like the idea of having different cultures and serving food from those places.  That might be fun, you could find recipes together and plan a special night once a week.  <br/>

time.<br/>
<br/>
When we travel we like to have trail mix on hand too - it handles <br/>
travel well and is filling and all. We usually hit Sam&#39;s (or other <br/>
bulk place) and pick out big packs of raisins, nuts, chocolate <br/>
chips, other dried fruit, crunchy cereals, etc. and mix up our own <br/>
trail mix - we get tons of stuff for way less than the prepackaged <br/>
kind and we can mix it to suit ourselves. For a while I was <br/>
making &quot;ogre mix&quot; for DS - instead of mixing the ingredients I&#39;d <br/>
leave them in layers! He loved it!<br/>
<br/>
We also buy the big store brand plain yogurt and then mix it on a <br/>
per serving basis with honey, fruit, jams & preserves, crunchy <br/>
stuff, whatever. That way there&#39;s no buying tons of this or that <br/>
flavor for each individual - just one base and lots of toppings.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really add much else to the discussion - there&#39;s only 3 of <br/>
us (DS is 6) and he eats about anything. We do take his ideas into <br/>
consideration and try to arrange things to suit all of us. For <br/>
instance, I can&#39;t eat eggs unless they are baked into something - <br/>
that rules out scrambled, fried, quiche, even some soft French <br/>
toast. DS currently loves cheese omelettes (4 egg omelettes no <br/>
less!) So, sometimes for dinner (yes dinner), he and DH will have <br/>
cheese omelettes, bacon, toast and juice. I&#39;ll have the juice, <br/>
bacon, and put the cheese on my toast to make a nice cheese <br/>
sandwich. Ends up being less cooking that way rather than more. As <br/>
has already been mentioned, we often have mix&#39;n&#39;match meals with the <br/>
pasta, sauce, cheese, meat, etc. all separate and mixed &quot;to order&quot; <br/>
but without much additional cooking.</div>
