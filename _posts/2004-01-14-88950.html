<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004657598">Hi Melissa and group....,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your response re: the Homeschooling conference in Sacramento.<br/>
I have attended one in the past.  I am very interested in the UNschooling<br/>
conferences and would love to attend one.  I live about 35 miles from Sac.<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling my grandson for 5 years  and want to shift to<br/>
UNschooling with him.  I have been trying to gradually change the way we<br/>
do things, sort of &quot;feeling my way&quot; towards an &quot;unidentified goal&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I guess this post looks like it will serve as my introduction!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
When my hubby and I took on the Guardianship of Kristopher (at age 14 mo.),<br/>
I knew I would want to homeschool him and began researching right away.<br/>
We struggled through 1st grade.  I joined a charter school for 2nd grade, but<br/>
did not really know how to use it to my advantage.  Third and 4th grades we have<br/>
been with a wonderful Charter School and have an advisor who has been a<br/>
real blessing to me.  She is an experienced PS teacher who is now homeschooling<br/>
her own children, and her assistance has been invaluable to me.<br/>
<br/>
Kristopher, now 10, is repeating 4th grade - but with different curriculum (I don&#39;t<br/>
see<br/>
that word on this list very much!!  LOL). Through the Charter School, he took the<br/>
same tests given in the Calif. PS.....he finished 4th grade last year at a<br/>
beginning-4th-grade<br/>
level...He is very bright in math, so we are working with 5th grade level math.<br/>
 Kristopher has had some some difficulties, and after having<br/>
him tested, it was decided he just needed a little boost in reading comprehension and<br/>
self expression.  Don&#39;t get me wrong....he can self express loud and long!!!.....he<br/>
just has a real struggle when it comes to getting his thoughts on paper.  As this year<br/>
has<br/>
progressed, I have come more and more to realize he needs to be in a more relaxed<br/>
situation, which I think I can provide for him through UNschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The Charter school is providing some tutoring......I was able to pick the teacher for<br/>
this!<br/>
He has made wonderful progress and loves going once a week to her home.  His reading<br/>
comprehension has improved 100%.  He is beginning to use his imagination to create<br/>
stories, including descriptive words, etc.  Rather than &quot;writing&quot; them, he tells them<br/>
to<br/>
his tutor and she writes them down.  Then....at home he types the story into his<br/>
computer,<br/>
editing it where necessary.  I think by this spring, he will be ready to &quot;fly on his<br/>
own&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I am ready to have him &quot;fly on his own&quot;!!  I have been reading this list for a couple<br/>
weeks....<br/>
and am overwhelmed with the volume of posts.  However, for the most part, they have<br/>
been very beneficial for me and helping me to begin thinking UNschooling!!<br/>
<br/>
The shift is not as easy as I had thought it might be......the &quot;old school&quot; ideas are<br/>
pretty<br/>
well implanted in my mind!  We are visiting the library and allowing him to check out<br/>
videos, books, etc.   Interestingly enough, he is checking out educational videos!!<br/>
I have been asking him what he would like to learn about, hoping to spark some<br/>
interest<br/>
in research, etc.  Self-teaching.....hmmmmmm, how do I explain that to him?<br/>
<br/>
I guess you can see that I am struggling with this.  Since we are still part of the<br/>
Charter<br/>
School, we do have to submit a sample of each of the four core subjects once a<br/>
month, along with attendance records, and twice a year, report cards and ILPs.<br/>
I will finish out the year with this, and probably not re-up with them in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
I think we are headed in the right direction!!!   Would love to find a local<br/>
UNschooler<br/>
to talk with.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long......I am really finding out what I am feeling and thinking as I<br/>
<br/>
type!<br/>
BTW: It isn&#39;t easy being &quot;Mom&quot; again!!!   I know now why God gave babies to<br/>
YOUNG people!!  *grin*  Thankfully, grandpa and Kristopher&#39;s dad are here and<br/>
lend a hand with things.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions will be gratefully accepted!!<br/>
<br/>

Hi Karol,<br/>
<br/>
My husband, daughter and I just moved from CA in Aug of last year<br/>
(the same weekend as the last Homeschooling conference in<br/>
Sacramento).  I&#39;m not sure about a specific Unschooling conference<br/>
but, there is a Homeschooling conference every Aug.  If you go<br/>
www.hsc.org, you can find out more info on it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I never did explain it to my kids, eventually they told me we needed to <br/>
unschool, LOL. I never felt the need to make an announcement, I think for my kids <br/>
that would have been confusing. They were more than happy to let the curriculum <br/>
drop by the wayside. Today they are both very good at articulating how they <br/>
see learning going on in their lives. They don&#39;t say &quot;I see learning going <br/>
on.....&quot; They just tell me stuff and I hear the learning. I would say just start <br/>
letting more and more slip away and let him fill it with his interests. Of <br/>
course you will want to continue to &quot;strew&quot; stuff around, LOL<br/>

Follow the links, too--they&#39;ll help you immensely.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have been asking him what he would like to learn about, hoping to spark <br/>
some<br/>
interest<br/>
in research, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not a good idea.  Just SEE what he&#39;s interested in, by watching him, by <br/>
seeing what he perks up at, by having discussions with him about what you&#39;re seeing <br/>
and doing.   Unschooling isn&#39;t &quot;sparking interest in research,&quot; it&#39;s learning <br/>
about what&#39;s in front of you because it can&#39;t be helped.  <br/>
<br/>
Go places and talk and play.   Listen to music you haven&#39;t heard for a while <br/>
or ever.  Rent more movies (they&#39;re ALL educational).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Self-teaching.....hmmmmmm, how do I explain that to him?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t.  Just not at all.<br/>
He won&#39;t be &quot;teaching himself,&quot; he&#39;ll be learning.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some justification for making that change in thought and language:<br/>

As another Californian, I just wanted to mention that you may send in the R4<br/>
at any time during the school year, that you choose to inform them you have<br/>
become a private school. (Just as you can pull a kid from public school and<br/>
then R-4) My point is that perceived legalities are not a reason to stay<br/>
with a Charter School until the school year is done. The number one regret<br/>
expressed by people who take up unschooling after a certain time, is that<br/>
they didn&#39;t do it sooner. Remember there is no testing, and no requirement<br/>
for portfolios or assessments in California. If the Charter is grading,<br/>
testing and assessing it is because they are accountable to the paying<br/>
customers, not the education laws for non-government schools. More info<br/>
www.hsc.org &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org/">http://www.hsc.org/</a>&gt;  - Chaos to confidence link.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of how wonderful you feel his &quot;progress&quot; is, and how nice the<br/>
teacher is, he is still being measured against a public school set of<br/>
standards that is limiting. He has always been ready to fly on his own if he<br/>
is not being weighed down by those expectations. How much better to have a<br/>
writing mentor who is interested in his stories out of personal liking and<br/>
friendship, than because it is part of the curriculum and must be covered<br/>
weekly, as part of being paid.<br/>
