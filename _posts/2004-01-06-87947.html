<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580296778">We had quite a few new people join the list in the last week or so and <br/>
I just wanted to say hello and welcome and remind you all to please <br/>
take the time to read the list guidelines.   You should have received <br/>
them by email when you joined, but, if not, you can read them in the <br/>
files area of this list or email the listowners and moderators at  <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; and we&#39;ll send you a <br/>
