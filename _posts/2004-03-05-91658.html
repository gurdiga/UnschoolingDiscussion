Everything I Know About Life I Learned Fron Video Games<br/>
<br/>
*There is no problem that cannot be overcome by force.<br/>
<br/>
*It it moves, destroy it!<br/>
<br/>
*Piloting any vehicle is simple and requires no training.<br/>
<br/>
*One lone &quot;good guy&quot; can defeat an infinite number of &quot;bad guys.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*Make sure you eat all food lying on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
*You can break things and get away with it.<br/>
<br/>
*If someone dies, he disappears.<br/>
<br/>
*If you get mad enough, you fight better.<br/>
<br/>
*You can overcome most adversaries simply by having enough quarters.<br/>
<br/>
*You can operate all weapons without training.<br/>
<br/>
*No matter how long you fight, you can always fight again.<br/>
<br/>
*Ninjas are common and frequently fight in public.<br/>
<br/>
*Whenever big, fat, mean guys are about to croak, they begin flashing red or <br/>
yellow.<br/>
<br/>
*You never run out of ammunition. Just grenades.<br/>
<br/>
*All women wear revealing clothing and have great bodies.<br/>
<br/>
*Shoot everything. If it blows up or dies, it was bad.<br/>
<br/>
*Don&#39;t worry if your vehicle crashes or explodes; a new vehicle will appear <br/>
in its place.<br/>
<br/>
*A thousand-to-one odds against you is NOT a problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I laughed. I&#39;m a video gamer from years back and it sounds like something a bunch of gamers would put up to make some good natured fun of themselves. I could only see it being disturbing if you really believed it.<br/>

That&#39;s FUNNY to people who actually play the games, but I guess if you <br/>

I sent it because I thought it was funny. It came from a video games <br/>
store----like poking fun at themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Had it come from Dr. Phil or John Rosemond, it would NOT have been funny.<br/>

<br/>
Interesting.  <br/>
I thought it was funny too, and either I&#39;m missing an e-mail (it happens) or <br/>
I hadn&#39;t noticed the &quot;Is that supposed to be funny?&quot; kind of note at the <br/>
bottom the first time.<br/>
<br/>
If critical old guys critical of childhood happiness make critical reviews of <br/>
kid-topics, it&#39;s just... negative and critical.<br/>
<br/>
If gamers themselves say &quot;Funny, huh?&quot; then it&#39;s fun for the sake of fun.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an acme cartoon physics list quite a bit like that.  It&#39;s gone around <br/>
for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
A few of them are:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made aware of its <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation<br/>
conforming to its perimeter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a good list with notes and additions here:<br/>
<br/>

And y&#39;know if nothing else they&#39;re an intro to the terminology of physics!!<br/>

the email programs are supposed to be doing something useful when they <br/>
automatically put the name of the person whose email is being quoted, <br/>
but don&#39;t we all sometimes copy one person&#39;s quotes from somebody <br/>
else&#39;s email? I apologize for not removing the name - I do try to <br/>
