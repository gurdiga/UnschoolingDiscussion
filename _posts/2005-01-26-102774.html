<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482228745">Wow!  I&#39;m a little behind on the digests and just read this post by <br/>
Sandra Dodd.  I checked out the spicey discussion on the message <br/>
board.  I&#39;m glad to see that Grace Llewlynn has posted a response <br/>
just yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not uncommon for people to misunderstand bellydancing (and in <br/>
this case, perhaps, hold grudges) and I think this is part of what <br/>
the upcoming movie on Belly Dance attempts to delve into.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know Grace personally, but I do live in the same town as her <br/>
(Eugene, Oregon), and can say that bellydancing is VERY popular and <br/>
loved in this town.  There is a Gypsy Stage at The Oregon Country <br/>
Fair which has bellydancing (and a little African and Flamenco) all <br/>
day long for 3 days (plus more for staff and volunteers).  Grace is a <br/>
bellydancer, and I was more intrigued with her bellydancing webpage <br/>
than her NBTSC, to be honest!  What can I say, I&#39;m a bellydancing <br/>
junky!<br/>

If any of you have any free-floating energy and want to defend belly <br/>
dancing, <br/>
it has been attacked as being inappropriate to have been performed at <br/>
the Not <br/>
Back To School Camp.<br/>
<br/>
