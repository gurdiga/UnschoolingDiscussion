<div id="ygrps-yiv-258222247">Mark came home with Two Towers on DVD a couple of days ago. We saw it at the<br/>
cinema and I was really disappointed with it. I was hoping I would enjoy it<br/>
more this time and I did. Phew! I&#39;m keyed up and ready for the next one now.<br/>
Only 4 months to go!<br/>
<br/>
Mark downloaded a desktop from the LOTR site so now I have the coolest pic<br/>
of Viggo on my screen. What a way to wake up!<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read LOTR to their kids? We have just finished The Hobbit and the<br/>
boys loved it but I think that LOTR will be too much for them. There is so<br/>
much to the book, I don&#39;t want to spoil it by reading it too early.<br/>

I read it to each of my boys when they were around seven.  And the cool<br/>

  **We saw it at the<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Just curious,,why were you first disappointed with it?<br/>
<br/>
  We saw it and loved it,  but I had never read it either.  So maybe that&#39;s the difference.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m reading it now,  my first time ever!  Wow!  Its amazing,  I had read The Hobbit when I was in elementary school but never LOTR.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  My kids love the long Gollum scene where his personalities are split and he&#39;s discussing how the Hobbitses are his friends and  he&#39;s a murrrdderrrr, pretty dark, but they like it.   For those of you who went to the conference and saw Joyce&#39;s dd do the scene from The Emporer&#39;s New Groove, (which was awesome, by the way!) That&#39;s what my dd (8) likes to do with that Gollum scene.  :)  So fun to watch,  we didn&#39;t even think of doing something like that for a talent show!  Great thinking Cat!<br/>
<br/>
  For reading to your kids,  couldn&#39;t you just make sure that you just read the first half or so?  Or into Two Towers?   I&#39;m not sure how much they overlap but I would think they would really enjoy it.   I wish my kids would let me read it to them,  but they are into other things right now.  So I read to myself! :)<br/>

read it to them now doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll never read it again. Some people<br/>
read it every year :-)<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s my favourite book. I was given the book for my 18th birthday and  read<br/>
it once a year. That&#39;s about 15 readings. There are lots of differences<br/>
between the book and the 2nd movie and I couldn&#39;t see how they were most of<br/>
them were necessary.  I bugged Mark in the cinema as I spent the whole movie<br/>
whispering indignantly, &quot;that&#39;s not right! that doesn&#39;t happen in the book!&quot;<br/>
&lt;g&gt; It is an awesome movie (the battle at Helm&#39;s Deep!!) and if I hadn&#39;t<br/>
read the book a few weeks before I saw the film, the differences wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been so glaring.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My kids haven&#39;t seen the movies yet. They watched the making of The<br/>
Fellowsip of the Ring and though they enjoyed it they felt that the movie<br/>
would scare them. Jess is extremely sensitive to music in movies and games<br/>
so that put him off the movie. One of the things I loved about the films was<br/>
the sound . It&#39;s HUGE!<br/>
I guess I haven&#39;t wanted to read the book until they could take it all in<br/>
but they might  really like it  and it is so huge you don&#39;t take everything<br/>
in first time. It&#39;s not like I would be spoiling it for them later on. I&#39;ll<br/>
wait till we have read Order of the Phoenix and then suggest it.<br/>

<br/>
Me too, and I&#39;m really enjoying the side-video stuff, making-of, previews, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
The first time I was so stunned by the way they portrayed Faramir that I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even SEE the rest of the movie.  I was upset for days.  Weeks.  (My <br/>
husband would say months. &lt;g&gt;)  Because I see the books from an interpersonal <br/>
standpoint rather than as an epic adventure/battle/manly/special effects story, <br/>
Faramir NEEDS to be really open and noble.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping they only left the very worst part of their Faramir in the <br/>
original and he&#39;ll be redeemed some by added scenes and the third installment.<br/>
<br/>
The bit about Aragorn falling over a cliff was weird the first time too, <br/>
since it didn&#39;t happen in the book, but it was a device for the romantic element <br/>
and so I forgive him.  It also allows them to show the responses of Gimli and <br/>
Legolas to seeing Aragorn alive.  Would they have carried on without him?  The <br/>
movie says &quot;yes.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of the book-provided background and motivation can&#39;t be shown visually, <br/>
so I know they need to take some liberties to get those relationships in <br/>
there, but I&#39;m looking forward to figuring out why they had to chop the integrity <br/>
off of Faramir.<br/>
<br/>
I read that Peter Jackson and the writers had as their guiding principle to <br/>
make the ring the main character and focus.  That&#39;s how they decided there <br/>
couldn&#39;t be a person who didn&#39;t want it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674900691">Hi Julie<br/>
<br/>
We rented it on VHS and the kids watched it. I couldn&#39;t sit still for <br/>
it on our tiny, losing-its-contrast TV, but did see it twice in the <br/>
theater. I also was disappointed, because of their treatment of <br/>
Treebeard. The first time I read LOTR, Treebeard was such a wonderful <br/>
treat, encountering him with Pippin and Merry and enjoying his depth, <br/>
his ancient wisdom...the movie made him into this slow doofus with no <br/>
spine.<br/>
<br/>
However, THAT was the only thing less than wonderful about the movie. <br/>
I loved the Gollum scenes (in fact, thank you, Peter Jackson, for <br/>
giving me an image of Gollum for when I read LOTR. Same with the <br/>
orcs. I never could picture them) and of course, Viggo is worth <br/>
watching! *slurp* I wish men dressed that way in these days. VERY <br/>
sexy: knee length over tunic, boots, sword belt...mmmm...LOL<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never read the trilogy to my kids, but they have checked out the <br/>
book on tape version of it, from the BBC...a VERY decent rendition! <br/>
And Abbie has read it a few times, starting w/the Hobbit at 7 and <br/>
LOTR at 10. Middle Earth has been her habitat of choice for many <br/>
years. <br/>
<br/>
Blessings, HeidiC<br/>

Yeah, I was disappointed with that too. I&#39;m thinking it was an issue of<br/>
time. Portraying him as the book did could have added half and hour to the<br/>
film easily. It makes you realize the depth of the book when three very long<br/>
movies can&#39;t bring it all to life.<br/>

read it to them now doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll never read it again. Some people<br/>
read it every year :-)<br/>

Often the first time through a book there&#39;s just enough processing power to<br/>
pick up the story. Subsequence readings are for finding deeper things<br/>
I just found the entire trilogy on 20 cds at the library.  There are 20 <br/>

Frodo found Faramir to be more like Aragorn, kingly and TRUE, than like<br/>
<br/>
Boromir  but I didn&#39;t want to rant.&lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES!!  The only men he had met were Aragorn and Boromir (and maybe some scary <br/>
guys in Bree or wherever along the way) and BOTH Aragorn and Boromir had <br/>
scared him at first, but Faramir was a GOOD guy, absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
The REAL Faramir, not the fantasy Faramir in the movie. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Funny, isn&#39;t it, that although the book is just fantasy too somehow it seems <br/>
the book has a reality the movie doesn&#39;t.<br/>

Probably I&#39;m just messed up in the head about the superiority of books.<br/>

There are lots of differences<br/>
between the book and the 2nd movie and I couldn&#39;t see how they were most of<br/>
them were necessary.  I bugged Mark in the cinema as I spent the whole movie<br/>
whispering indignantly, &quot;that&#39;s not right! that doesn&#39;t happen in the book!&quot;<br/>
&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Yep, I didn&#39;t like it at all except for maybe the close ups of Aragorn, and a couple of cute funny lines from Gimli.  Overall it was a big disappointment for me and for DH who made an hour trip to go and buy it after work (we didn&#39;t get to the cinemas).  Oh and Gollum was pretty gorgeous lmao - I like when he slipped into &#39;Mr Bean&#39; mode after giving the rabbit to Frodo - I nearly wet myself laughing. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I want to see the next movie.  I am reading the book again though just to get the story right in my head after having it messed around with so much.  I think I&#39;ll start reading it out loud to my girls (Jason will secretly listen) tonight if they&#39;re interested.<br/>
