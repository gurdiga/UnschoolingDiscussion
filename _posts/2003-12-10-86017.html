talking to her friend instead of noticing the stop sign, not a big truck, that hit <br/>
us. No idea how she was parented or schooled, but our being &quot;un&quot;schoolers <br/>
didn&#39;t help us a bit.<br/>
<br/>
       And all it did for me is furnish a whole new category of daily worry, <br/>
not make teen sex or nose-piercing seem safe by comparison. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

      Pam&#39;s a real expert, but as an amateur I&#39;d recommend  The Universe and <br/>
the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty by K.C. Cole. <br/>
<br/>
       Chapter Three called &quot;Calculated Risks&quot; in which she explains that <br/>
onereal risk in nearly every situation is the risk that our risk assessment has <br/>
been wrong! &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
