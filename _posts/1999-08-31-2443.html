<br/>
Hi  Nancy K.,<br/>
<br/>
There is much on the web about sustainability and permaculture. We are<br/>
involved with a group of people who are interested in a sustainable mode of<br/>
living which includes renewable energy like solar and wind power, organic<br/>
farming and gardening, natural non-toxic building methods, sharing resources<br/>
like tools, cars, living space, and much more.  There is one Co-Housing<br/>
community in Ann Arbor and several co-operative houses, and we are seeking<br/>
to form a rural community that has a sister urban community.  There is also<br/>
interest in this forming community in holistic healing, alternative<br/>
education, and teaching sustainabilty to the larger community.  You can<br/>
learn more online about intentional community and the eco-village model.<br/>
Some of the basic principles are looking at the effect of our actions on the<br/>
next seven generations; will it deplete the eco-system or enrich it?  Is our<br/>
garbage toxic or is it compost?  Another principle often involved in<br/>
community living is the method of consensus, peaceful conflict resolution<br/>
and problem solving.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;I just came back from spending a week with my friend and her four<br/>
children,<br/>
she is and always has been very materialistic, where I am not, I would love<br/>
to live in the country and have lots of animals and a garden ect..., I<br/>
cannot right now, I do live in a small town, that is very laid back and I<br/>
love it, she on the other hand lives in a much larger city, (lansing) it is<br/>
much faster paced, everyone works almost every family is a two income family<br/>
where she is, and the bigger the house and cars and the fancier the clothes<br/>
the better you are&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is so true here in Ann Arbor as well, Tanya.  We have long dreamed of<br/>
living simply on a farm and growing our own fruits and vegetables and<br/>
raising animals.  But some things hold us back; the isolation of living<br/>
alone on a big farm, the cost of real estate, and the work involved in<br/>
country living, historically done as a community.  It is very hard for a<br/>
mother with young children to do all of the work of running a farm while<br/>
daddy commutes to work six days a week just to pay for it.  Been there, done<br/>
that.  So we have been meeting with a group of between ten and twenty others<br/>
who share the same vision and want to do this work together; not in<br/>
isolation, to *escape* the city and modern life, but as a conscious choice<br/>
to be a model for sustainablity and future of society.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I lived in a rural area of Michigan for several years, and<br/>
decided that we just couldn&#39;t raise our family there without community of<br/>
people who are diverse, tolerant, and care about education.  We feel really<br/>
blessed to be where we are now; the main drawback to where we live is really<br/>
only money, since the cost of living is much higher here then in a small<br/>
town without any of the resources.  Funny, but we didn&#39;t have basic things<br/>
in a poor small town like even access to local produce or u-pick farms that<br/>
we do now living in a college town.<br/>
<br/>
I look at my decision to unschool as right and a responsiblity.  I need to<br/>
look at how my life affects society, and what kind of life I choose to work<br/>
towards.  Choosing to homeschool has led me to many things that have<br/>
enriched my life deeply, including permaculture, intentional community, and<br/>
choosing a spiritual community that practices tolerance and peace-making.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472139897">Sandra, sounds great! are you living in a co-operative group right now? that<br/>
has always appealed to me,  I need to get my family to the point where we<br/>
are eating more simply! I have checked out the sites on  cooking for a month<br/>
at a time, do you practice this and if so is it working out well? I need to<br/>
buy my freezer in order to do this, but before I can buy the freezer, we<br/>
have to have our final inspection so I can use it in the garage! anyway, I<br/>
would love to hear more about what you do with your family on a daily basis<br/>
to save energy and money and live simpler!<br/>
