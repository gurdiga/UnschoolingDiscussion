<br/>
Four years ago our family moved to the Midwest from a city for a better<br/>
lifestyle.  That meant a job change for my husband, and with it came a 60%<br/>
pay cut.  We weren&#39;t making big bucks to begin with either!  We were dropped<br/>
below the poverty level with that change, and our lives changed<br/>
dramatically...for the better.<br/>
<br/>
I began a huge garden, we raise most of our own meat, and we eat better than<br/>
we ever have.  It is still a struggle sometimes, and we hope that it will<br/>
not always be that way, but it is possible to adjust to a drastic income<br/>
loss.  And live to tell about it! :-)<br/>

I&#39;ve very envious of the garden thing... Something I can&#39;t do here in Tucson, <br/>
unless we want to eat cactus... Most of the things I&#39;ve planted have died a <br/>
horrible death from the heat and right now we have this water shortage going <br/>
on as well... Maybe a move to where there is more water and therefore more <br/>
gardening would be great for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832666158">For all the folks living in cactus country, my sister lives in Vegas and<br/>
she does container gardening using a drip system which requires much less<br/>
water.  She lives for the K-Mart sales where you can buy bags of top soil<br/>
and organic compost for $1 a bag.  She mixes these with vermiculite, plants<br/>
the plant and then puts lots of mulch on top which helps stop the<br/>
evaporation.  It works great and takes very, very little water!<br/>
