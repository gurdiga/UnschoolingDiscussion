<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432542659">We&#39;ve never had a problem with smells in them that I can think of.  When<br/>
they are washed I sit them in the oven during the winter and they dry<br/>
nicely.  During the summer I sit lots of things (like the tins) out on the<br/>
deck to sun dry.  The only one that has rusted was left out in the<br/>
greenhouse and I&#39;d rust too if left out there to long &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are currently investigating ethnic heritage diets and getting more &quot;back<br/>
to basics&quot; and getting rid of all the &quot;modern&quot; foods--convenience, packaged,<br/>
instant, etc..<br/>
