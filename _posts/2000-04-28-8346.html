<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035681168">Hi Everyone,<br/>
What magazines for kids do you like?  We don&#39;t get ladybug anymore, but<br/>
we did, and I loved it.  What else is out there?  Isn&#39;t there some out<br/>
there that are history?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746051704">We just started getting Kids Discover magazine and Zoobooks (which was<br/>
given as a gift). Kids Discover has some issues with historical themes. We<br/>
also get Ranger Rick.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any magazines good for kids around 7 years old that<br/>
have a hands-on science focus?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550668924">I think the Odyssey Magazine looks interesting. I am not sure if he is<br/>
ready for it yet. I have bookmarked it to look at this later. I noticed<br/>
there are a couple of kids&#39; history magazines put out by this same company;<br/>
they are listed on the &quot;Subscribe&quot; page at the site you mentioned (for<br/>
those looking for history magazines).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt;This one looks like it is for older kids, but with some parent help<br/>
&gt;maybe????<br/>

&gt;Olivia, I found a great one at Barnes and Noble but I<br/>
&gt;can not remember the name. We are going this weekend<br/>
&gt;so I will write down the name and phone number for<br/>
&gt;you. I do remember it was a cool mag. my 8 yr. old<br/>
&gt;seemed to like it! She loves Ranger Rick and The Big<br/>
&gt;Backyard. Also we all LOVE Kids Discover. Each issue<br/>
&gt;is one subject,like hurricanes or Thomas Edison<br/>
&gt;Jill <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Jill, I would like to know the name of it if you come across it<br/>
again. Thinking about magazines reminded me to take out some issues of Kids<br/>
Discover that we hadn&#39;t yet read. So last night we read and enjoyed the<br/>
issue about &quot;Language&quot;. It is a magazine that&#39;s interesting for both kids<br/>
and adults.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047402862">Hi Ann:<br/>
<br/>
The explorezone site has a lot of fun information. I also think he will<br/>
like SpaceKids.com, which was linked from that page you mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragonfly magazine looked promising, and the site has some interesting<br/>
activities. We&#39;ll have to explore them soon. However, when I went to read<br/>
about subscriptions, it said they were discontinuing the Dragonfly magazine<br/>
as a freestanding publication. Too bad because it looked good from their<br/>
website. But it also mentioned that they may be combining it with some<br/>
other publication. I&#39;ll check back later. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the sites,<br/>
Olivia<br/>

&gt;Here is another one I came across.  It looks like it might be pretty<br/>
&gt;interesting for younger kids, and it isn&#39;t quite as expensive as most of<br/>
&gt;the others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800130603">Hello there<br/>
<br/>
We subscribe to New Moon: &quot;the magazine for girls and their dreams&quot; (as my<br/>
daughter always likes to add).  They are publishing a drawing of hers in<br/>
their July/Aug issue.  One of their articles inspired us to take a belly<br/>
dancing class together.<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking and enjoying the sharing that goes on here.  We are<br/>
thinking of moving back to Madison Wi --  anyone know of an unschooling<br/>
community in that area?  We live in NH now -- came here (from Boston) for<br/>
me to get a MEd at Antioch.  That experience only further supported my<br/>
unschool leanings.  We also have Waldorf connections that both enrich and<br/>
provoke.<br/>
<br/>
Found the first violets in the backyard yesturday -- Spring has been slow<br/>
in coming.  Happy May Day.  (We too got out the May Pole that we made last<br/>
year -- wonderful motion and color pattern making improv ritual<br/>
celebration!)<br/>
<br/>
Hey! I finally jumped in!<br/>
