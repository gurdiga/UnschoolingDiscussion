<br/>
Robby wanted to make &quot;Edible Ocean&quot; where you put together a batch of <br/>
blue Jello and throw gummy fish and other water-creature candies, and <br/>
let it harden, then eat it.<br/>
<br/>
So, we got six small boxes of blue Jello, some Swedish fish, Nerds <br/>
make a good ocean bottom, etc. and Robby wanted to do it on his own. <br/>
Well, I talked him through the process before setting him loose in <br/>
the kitchen. &quot;What do you do first?&quot; and so forth, you know, just <br/>
reminding him that the Jello powder goes in, then the boiling water, <br/>
then the cold water and ice cubes.<br/>
<br/>
We had to six-times the recipe on the Jello box. Drew a picture of <br/>
3/4 times 6 and came up with 4 1/2 c. of boiling water, but what <br/>
about the cold water and ice cubes? I was sitting there, writing out <br/>
this math problem on paper, when Robby said &quot;Seven and a half&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just a sec, Rob. We...gotta...figure it...&quot; He was right. He didn&#39;t <br/>
need paper. He just did the thing in his head.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never set him down in front of a sheet of math problems EVER <br/>
again. Unless he wants to. <br/>
<br/>
And he and Katie gobbled down the edible Jello and slimy Swedish Fish <br/>
in one sitting.<br/>
<br/>
ewwwww. <br/>
