 </span></blockquote>I am unschooling two teenagers....16 and almost 14.  The biggest reason my <br/>
husband and i did this is because of the peer pressure crap that comes from <br/>
public school.  My oldest had just started Middle School (our elementary <br/>
school here was excellent, small and personable), and being the smallest <br/>
child in his class, not to mention gifted, he was teased...ALOT.  So....he <br/>
stopped doing his work....started getting into trouble....had a MAJOR <br/>
attitude problem.  *sigh*  So i figured, &quot;What the heck?  What do i have to <br/>
lose?&quot;  His attitude changed IMMEDIATELY!  He started excelling in his <br/>
learning, because he was learning about things he wanted to AND no one was <br/>
teasing him for being smart.  Needless to say we just finished up our third <br/>
year unschooling and the boys are so bright.  We have a fantastic <br/>
relationship, and they are truly GOOD kids.....not to say we don&#39;t have our <br/>
moments, i mean, afterall, they ARE teenagers!  LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343054637">If your son is 16 he does not need any other paperwork from my <br/>
understanding.  FLorida requires info from 6-16.  He could get his <br/>
GED and start taking college courses.<br/>
