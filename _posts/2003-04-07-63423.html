West Side Story, maybe?  Not as light.<br/>
<br/>
I used to turn it off before Tony died, for a long time, and one day I forgot <br/>
to distract kids away from it at that point, and I walked in on two of my <br/>
kids (Holly and Marty, I think) standing and staring at Maria holding <br/>
Tony.... ooops.<br/>
<br/>
Holly makes fun of me now, but it was nice for them to know the songs without <br/>
knowing Tony and Maria didn&#39;t live happily ever after.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days ago Holly was watching West Side Story and she said, &quot;Mom <br/>
are there other things written by this guy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Music or story?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Story.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I was in the next room and thinking and smirking and wondering how she would <br/>
take it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shakespeare.  They were doing a modern jazz version of Romeo and Juliet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well what else did he write then that we have?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Henry V, Much Ado about Nothing, Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, Hamlet...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;OH!!&quot;<br/>

But darn, they&#39;re not musicals.  <br/>
I guess I need to find &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; for her!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52838488">In the Back to the Future trilogy, Michael J. Fox&#39;s character spends<br/>
time in the fifties at a prom. For movies from the 50&#39;s I immediately<br/>
thought of early Elvis, but I might be wrong (60&#39;s??). An American In<br/>
Paris is 1951, and Gigi is 1958. Of course Grease is so sweetly naïve,<br/>
with all those actors in their 30&#39;s being teens at high school.<br/>
Or were you asking for advice on circular skirts? Big point - let it<br/>
&quot;drop&quot; gathered at the waist on a coathanger for at least a week so that<br/>
the hem (measured from the floor up) stays even.<br/>
Some of the most hilarious &quot;movies&quot; from the 50&#39;s are those social<br/>
studies films about drug use, or staying away from the &quot;bad&quot; crowd who<br/>
wear dungarees and dangling earrings (gasp!), designed supposedly for<br/>
teenagers as cautionary tales.<br/>

grandparents. Especially if they&#39;re from that era. Those were the years my<br/>
mom was in high school. My dad drove a &#39;56 Chevy Bel Air, pink and silver,<br/>
so that was their time. For my mom&#39;s 60th birthday, we threw a huge party<br/>
with a 50&#39;s theme. So the kids and I found clothes at Goodwill to wear from<br/>
that era, and I made a big &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; poster for my mom with<br/>
pictures of her from her life and we did the decorations up and found music.<br/>
It was really fun!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d think about throwing a 50&#39;s party or dance.<br/>

I surfed over our library system also and found a box set of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; shows. Also a movie with Dobie Gillis and Debbie Reynolds. Woohoo....I&#39;m starting to feel like the cat&#39;s meow and getting the itch to *cruise*.<br/>
