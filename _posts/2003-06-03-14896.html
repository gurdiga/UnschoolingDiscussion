Thank you for your interest in Building Homes of Our Own, the<br/>
interactive CD-ROM game geared towards Middle School students.<br/>
www.homesofourown.org<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Your registration did not contain a school email address or the name of<br/>
a recognized institution therefore, we are restricted from sending a<br/>
free copy of the game.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Because the game is a public service initiative to help school systems<br/>
our grant underwriters require that we screen all requests.  Our charter<br/>
is to reach school buildings with multiple grade classrooms.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you would like information on how your local library might receive<br/>
one free copy for local lending, please have a public Librarian contact<br/>
us for details. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you believe that you have received this message in error, please<br/>
return email us with ALL of the following information: <br/>
<br/>
*         The name of your school<br/>
<br/>
*         Student enrollment <br/>
<br/>
*         Grades levels of the school<br/>
<br/>
*         School email address <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once again, this is a PC game only; there is no Mac version at this<br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
The games minimum system requirements are:  Windows 98 OS or better, 233<br/>
MHz Pentium II, 64 MB RAM; 8 X CD-ROM. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212021780">Hi Dee,<br/>
Their grant writers require them to &quot;screen&quot; recipients? Hogwash! They&#39;re <br/>
post screening. But, rule of thumb ... never give more than is requested. (They <br/>
can however, freely expand on the info that you do give. I&#39;ve recently been <br/>
getting mail addressed to Dean Gregory &lt;g&gt;.) <br/>
<br/>
I put &quot;other&quot; for grade level, gave them our school name (GG Academy - Gifted <br/>
and Gorgeous &lt;g&gt;, renamed from Gregory Girls by my three strongly humor <br/>
ridden daughters &lt;g&gt;), and I used the same &quot;residential&quot; address for both home and <br/>
school. We&#39;d received it quickly, maybe all of three weeks???<br/>
 <br/>
Submitting another registration application with only required information <br/>
will likely do the trick. I&#39;d ignore their request for more. Student enrollment <br/>
is NOT on their application as they indicated on their subsequent request for <br/>
more info. <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
