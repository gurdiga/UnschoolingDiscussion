<div id="ygrps-yiv-801137042"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That&#39;s a really good idea.  Now can anyone think of a way to make it<br/>
&gt; something to throw?  The men in dh&#39;s family have always been throwers,<br/>
&gt; not punchers.  Wyndham is the same.  When he&#39;s mad, he rarely hits or<br/>
&gt; kicks, he throws.<br/>

Koosh balls.  Except in the kitchen, the little ones don&#39;t tend to do much,<br/>
if any, damage.  And they really fly, don&#39;t hurt when they hit someone, and<br/>
have a kind of satisfying feel to throw.  Also, they have a tendency to<br/>
induce laughter at my house, a nice effect!<br/>
