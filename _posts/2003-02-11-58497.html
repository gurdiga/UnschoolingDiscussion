<div id="ygrps-yiv-680891273">&lt;&lt; &gt; I really do mean this in the friendliest possible way.  An unschooling<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; conference is not one &quot;teacher&quot; in a classroom full of &quot;children&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;It was a joke.  Sorry it didn&#39;t come across that way. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That whole exchange bugged me. (In case anyone cares.)<br/>
<br/>
I thought someone jumped too hard on something that was obviously a joke.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people are touchy and that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t teach sewing, but I can sew.  I can help one person with one machine <br/>
(if there&#39;s a book) but I&#39;m not good at explaining sewing.  I was doing a <br/>
pair of pants this morning with a fancy three-part gore in the crotch.  I was <br/>
copying a pair of pants a friend made, for medieval pants for Kirby.  I got <br/>
really confused at one point, because I was thinking in words.  And so I took <br/>
a deep breath, and went back to it wordlessly, and thought only in pictures <br/>
and memories of what I know of traditional pants cuts and human movement <br/>
(squatting and stretching and other pants-related things).  It helped, and I <br/>
got it to go together without a problem.  I wouldn&#39;t have been able to <br/>
explain it easily to someone else, though.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was helping Holly with a sock monkey.  I was physically helpful, <br/>
but I don&#39;t have a lot of sewing-related patter to pass on, it seems, <br/>
compared to some other things I can talk about fairly lucidly.<br/>
<br/>
When I go to conferences I like to hear people talk, though,  I don&#39;t mind <br/>
hearing them answer questions, but I don&#39;t want to go to a conference to hear <br/>
everybody else say what they think, because some of the people at conferences <br/>
haven&#39;t even unschooled, and so their opinions are kinda time-wasting if they <br/>
get the mike for too long.  And if an hour of a conference is spent answering <br/>
things like &quot;what about socialization&quot; and &quot;how can they learn to read <br/>
without phonics&quot; then those who paid money aren&#39;t getting much good <br/>
information, and those asking those questions could have them answered by <br/>
just looking around at the kids and by reading any beginning unschooling <br/>
article, or picking up two or three homeschooling magazines until they find <br/>
an article on reading.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t love panel discussions much either, because too often it granulates <br/>
the information down into little reactionary bits and there&#39;s  not enough <br/>
cohesion to get a good point.  There was an unschooling panel at last year&#39;s <br/>
HSC conference.  There were some good moments, but overall it seemed very <br/>
disjoint to me.<br/>
<br/>
This year&#39;s HSC conference will be almost all panels, so those people who DO <br/>
love panel discussions should be in heaven!!<br/>
