<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083631566">Hi, I am Cat (37) mama to L (5) and (J) 10 mos.  We live (and unschool) in Pittsburgh, Pa. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been enjoying the threads especially on rages and dealing with same. L has very extreme emotions (may be the age, may be her personality) and is generally what I would consider challenging.  Nice to see various takes on how to deal with that. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been reading with interest the breastfeeding thread.  I don&#39;t spend any time in places where I think it woudl be inappropriate to nurse my baby.  I don&#39;t deliberately flash anyone, but I certainly dont&#39; hid under a blanket  -- and I frequently walk aroudn with my baby in the sling, nursing.  I agree with the poster who said that society won&#39;t change to feel that it is acceptable to nurse children, until people get accustomed to seeing it done.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now we do quite a bit of inadvertant flashing when J. suddenly unlatches to look around.   There is a great Hathor the Cow Goddess comic about that: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.angelfire.com/comics/hathor/dismount.html">http://www.angelfire.com/comics/hathor/dismount.html</a><br/>

That is just way too funny!!! Thank you. I never heard of that before. The<br/>
cow goddess I mean. Reminds me so muc of when Alyssa was nursing. She would<br/>
become rather nosy at times and latch on and release quickly and do the<br/>
exact thing in the comic along with a very loud smacking noise as she<br/>
suddenly pulled away. You all know that sound!!! Then go back nursing only<br/>
to do the same thing over and over again. All I could do was sit and laugh.<br/>
It was hysterical.<br/>
