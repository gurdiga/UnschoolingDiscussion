What confused me about this were two things...
<br>1.&nbsp; catalog?&nbsp; Guess that&#39;s what they call their web site.
<p>2.&nbsp; Retailer?&nbsp; All our local book stores are retailers too,
right?&nbsp; They give 10 - 20 percent discounts.&nbsp; Maybe because Amazon
is such a volume dealer, their prices are lower.&nbsp; I really haven&#39;t
paid that much attention.
