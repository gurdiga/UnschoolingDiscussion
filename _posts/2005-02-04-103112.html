I&#39;m  curious about what other thoughts people have on &quot;unschooling  <br/>
space&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t be fooled by the number of bedrooms in a brand new house.  The  living <br/>
spaces are often poorly designed for unschooling.  Three or  four bedroom <br/>
older houses that have been added onto, or in which the attic was  finished seem <br/>
to have the best options.  Of course, you might want to  have a bedroom for <br/>
each kid, but it&#39;s the common areas that matter.  <br/>
 <br/>
Is there a room that can be a library?  (Better if it has doors that  can be <br/>
closed.)<br/>
 <br/>
Is there a room where projects can be laid out and left there and not  hinder <br/>
meals?<br/>
 <br/>
You definitely want a house with a living room AND a den.  They  usually have <br/>
formal dining rooms, too.  My best unschooling house so far  was the one on <br/>
Penguin Cove.  It had a den, living room, dining room,  breakfast room, <br/>
sunroom, office, 5 bedrooms and in the middle of all that was a  room that could be <br/>
accessed from both ends of the house.  That was our  library.  <br/>
 <br/>
It wasn&#39;t a brand new house.  It was built in 1979.  Two of the  bedrooms <br/>
were added later, in the attic, as was the sunroom (not in the  attic).  It was <br/>
3000 sq ft, and I looked at other 3000 sq ft homes that  were brand new and <br/>
they didn&#39;t have near what this house had as far as usable  space.  They had <br/>
&quot;great rooms&quot; and gourmet kitchens.  I didn&#39;t need  that.  <br/>
 <br/>
It was also much more house than I could have afforded in the &quot;nicer&quot;  areas, <br/>
but it didn&#39;t matter to be in the &quot;nicer&quot; areas because we&#39;re  <br/>
unschoolers---GOOD SCHOOLS don&#39;t matter (except for resale, but we sold it for  more than <br/>
our asking price just 2 years later).<br/>
 <br/>
Most real estate agents will have a hard time understanding that you don&#39;t  <br/>
care how many more bedrooms or that it has all the latest gadgets in the <br/>
kitchen  or arched windows.  (Who doesn&#39;t want a beautiful house?  But there  are <br/>
trade-offs.)  I had to explain it to my realtor every time we saw a  house.  <br/>
They want you to think about the schools, but the schools really  didn&#39;t matter <br/>
to me.  I knew what I wanted. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have a great big house anymore.  There are only 3 of us here  now.  I <br/>
could have gone and bought a brand new house or a giant house  again.  What I <br/>
have now is a 110 year old Victorian in a small town on an  acre lot.  The <br/>
house is only 1500 sq. ft, and it&#39;s layout is divided up  perfectly for being <br/>
able to shut doors and keep out noise.  The reason I  bought this house over <br/>
several others was because it also has an 1100 sq. ft.  shop and 12x24 <br/>
studio--that&#39;s where all the stuff that was in the  library goes.  Plus we have the shop <br/>
for doing indoor things like baseball  practice (which we did with sock <br/>
balls) and working on the cars, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s really good to imagine what you will need and figure out what&#39;s really  <br/>
important to you.  Set a minimum (number of bedrooms and baths, number of  <br/>
seperate living spaces, size of kitchen, price range, of course).  This  helps <br/>
you narrow the field, because it can be mind boggling.  Look  at new AND old <br/>
houses.  You should look at all houses that meet  that minimum, no matter what <br/>
area they are in, because you never know.  <br/>
 <br/>
Of course, most of this depends on the market in your area and your price  <br/>
range!  <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry this is so long.  I&#39;m into house hunting.  <br/>
