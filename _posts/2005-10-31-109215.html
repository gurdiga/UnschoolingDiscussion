<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991599384">Thanks for the info, but really offlist is better for such local technical <br/>
stuff.   I do appreciate the reassuring ideas and Mary Ellen&#39;s clarifications, <br/>
but   it will bore and irritate the hundred dozen people who aren&#39;t in <br/>
Washington (and probably most of those too &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
