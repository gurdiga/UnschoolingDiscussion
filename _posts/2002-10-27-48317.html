<div id="ygrps-yiv-92888101">&lt;&lt;Okay this is a really stupid question but how exactly do you train a<br/>
rat not <br/>
to poop on you?? I always wanted a guinea pig but always got peed on by <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Our little girls still poop on me from time to time.  It&#39;s fairly dry and<br/>
comes in a neat little package, I just keep a bit of toilet paper handy.<br/>
<br/>
If they leave little pee drops you might consider yourself honored, rats<br/>
will &quot;mark&quot; their favorite things.  When Mama Cass does this on me I feel<br/>
quite loved, I just pat it up and it doesn&#39;t smell.<br/>
