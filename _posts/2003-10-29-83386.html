Shel Silverstein.  We&#39;ve recently been engrossed in his CD with this poem.  <br/>
My son would have never thought of reciting poetry until hearing Shel do his.  <br/>
Now he wants to do a few in the talent show (which keeps getting cancelled).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502517172"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Shel Silverstein *Where the Sidewalk Ends*&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Good book, good poem.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really behind in posts, but wanted to share a fun game Casey and <br/>
I played with our Shel Silverstein books.<br/>
<br/>
We started on the last page of poetry. Casey rolled a die and we <br/>
subtracted that many pages from the end page and that&#39;s the poem we <br/>
would read. Then she rolled 2 dice and would add those together and <br/>
we&#39;d subtract that number from the current poem page and read that <br/>
one. Then she rolled 3 dice...and on and on. I think we got up to 8 <br/>
dice. Sometimes she would just count the dots to add all those <br/>
numbers. Sometimes she had some &quot;math facts&quot; that helped her go <br/>
faster. Sometimes I would show her how to combine dice to get 10&#39;s, <br/>
which I always find the easiest way to add all those single digit <br/>
numbers.<br/>
<br/>
When we got back to the beginning of the book I think we started <br/>
adding the dice number to the pages. It was all very relaxed and the <br/>
rules of our games were developed and changed on the fly.<br/>
<br/>
I read all of the poems aloud to Casey, but I later heard her on the <br/>
phone with a friend (long distance!). They were playing the same game <br/>
and reading the poetry to each other.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
