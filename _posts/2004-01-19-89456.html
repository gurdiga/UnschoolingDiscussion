&gt; I also would do the same with ANY religion that I didn&#39;t feel was Bible<br/>
&gt; based.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the same time I could not force them NOT to explore.  I would feel very<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       This actually happened to a good friend of our Dd13 last year. She <br/>
announced to her folks and to her school friends that she was a witch. The other <br/>
girls&#39; parents then set up a sort of united &quot;intervention&quot; and told her <br/>
parents that no one would be allowed to talk to her anymore because she was a <br/>
dangerous influence. Her folks were so distressed that they pulled her out of her <br/>
public school and enrolled her in a tiny conservative Christian school until she <br/>
was sufficiently back in the fold and dropped the witch identity.<br/>
<br/>
       It had nothing to do with television and btw, as I remember the Salem <br/>
witch trials --long before tv -- the horror wasn&#39;t in young girls pretending <br/>
to be witches but the opposite. It was in their own claim to know who was holy <br/>
and who was possessed by evil, followed by pointing fingers at other people to <br/>
renounce their own evil or be forcibly expelled them from the community or be <br/>
purged by death. I&#39;d say witches and television have a lot in common as <br/>
scapegoats for all manner of human behavior and belief. <br/>
<br/>
       I kept thinking that if they&#39;d focused on what was going on with their <br/>
daughter in the first place, rather than responding to <br/>
witchcraft-as-religious-trigger, it could have been better for all concerned. They compounded the <br/>
problem imo with their determination to make her to conform instead of <br/>
discovering why she was rebelling.<br/>
<br/>
      What I mean is, I guess, that if I believed literally in either <br/>
salvation or hell and the Bible as the only thing standing between the two, I would <br/>
choose the approach with the strongest likelihood of permanently saving my <br/>
children. Which, in my mind, would be to help build the highest possible <br/>
individual strength, confidence and commitment in my children, so that I know they can <br/>
stand up for themselves and what they believe, and trust their own decisions, <br/>
against anyone or anything -- I&#39;d want them to withstand peer pressure and <br/>
institutional pressure rather than teach them to yield to it, for example. <br/>
<br/>
       And for a parent to succeed at all that takes more than not forcing <br/>
children to comply, imo, it takes CELEBRATING their exploration and learning <br/>
about themselves and what they need and want, cheering them on as they search for <br/>
what to believe and draw sustenance from their whole lives. <br/>
<br/>
       If my goal were to raise committed Christians, I wouldn&#39;t undermine <br/>
their fledgling independent ideas or choices, or tell them what to think, or act <br/>
in ways that make my religion or the Bible itself seem to be just glorified <br/>
peer pressure for the purpose of keeping each other on the straight and narrow, <br/>
et cetera.<br/>
<br/>
       Just as I wouldn&#39;t arrange their marriages or choose their college <br/>
major, I wouldn&#39;t do these things because they aren&#39;t practical, they don&#39;t get <br/>
the best results! They aren&#39;t well-suited to the long-term goal.<br/>
<br/>
       The girl is back in public school now, after she served her year in <br/>
the cloistered (and she says suffocating) setting. She&#39;s been allowed to join a <br/>
couple of theater productions with Dd (theater folk are not always exactly <br/>
&quot;wholesome &lt;g&gt;) and also to visit some different churches with Dd and then <br/>
dissect their differences, which they are enjoying.<br/>
<br/>
       I secretly wonder if the parents learned more from the whole thing <br/>
than their daughter did, and I kinda suspect so, but don&#39;t know for sure. Hope <br/>
so. :) JJ<br/>

going to any ceremony that I was invited to.  I would have no problem helping <br/>
my children explore any religion they wanted.  I would rather discuss it with <br/>
them then have them out there on their own.  I have been to and participated <br/>
in different ceremonies with different friends and family members it just <br/>
doesn&#39;t hold the same meaning for me as it does for them.  But I am always touched <br/>
that they would invite me to something so personal as a religious or spiritual <br/>
ceremony.<br/>

<br/>
Not if the institution was the church and the peers were the church members.  <br/>
Many Christian homeschoolers&#39; existence involves keeping their children &quot;in <br/>
the fold&quot; like sheep, where their only exposure is to Christian input.  There <br/>
are Christian knock-offs of Goosebumps and of romance novels.   There&#39;s a <br/>
Christian knock-off of the Crystal Cave series.  They will go to great lengths to <br/>
give their kids the illusion that they are allowing them freedom, but it&#39;s all <br/>
sham-freedom.    It&#39;s like the Truman Show in a way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;     If my goal were to raise committed Christians&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you were that kind of fundamentalist Christian you would be told it is <br/>
your duty to keep your children in line because Jesus could come today, and if <br/>
your children are not saved you will be separated from them for eternity in <br/>
addition to facing God&#39;s judgment for not being a good Christian parent.   <br/>
<br/>
There are arguments you can find easily online that say if you raise your <br/>
children without spanking them you are in direct violation of God&#39;s order to <br/>
parents.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish I could say &quot;Sorry I changed the subject,&quot; but it&#39;s not a change of <br/>
subject.  <br/>
<br/>
That girl said she was a witch because she had been exposed to Satanic <br/>
influences and was being lured away from God.    Her eternal soul was in immediate <br/>
peril.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m with you on this one, Pam -- well said.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also a Christian, and I have been honored to be invited to experience <br/>
other religions&#39; rituals.  Even as a Christian, I believe in things and have <br/>
participated in rituals that most other Christians would find difficult -- I have <br/>
sung at two gay unions, for example (my kids were ushers at the second).  I&#39;d <br/>
LOVE to sing at a handfasting!<br/>
<br/>
As far as helping my children explore other religions, Liam and I are <br/>
involved in a Comparative Religions co-op group with families that are <br/>
Buddhist/Universalist, Wiccan, Jewish, Catholic and Baptist (we&#39;re Lutheran).  We visited a <br/>
Taoist temple last week then went to eat Vietnamese food.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
