There are places where it is considered virtuous and even pious to &quot;take <br/>
things on faith&quot;, but this isn&#39;t one of them.<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
There are people in whose word I have great faith.  There are 85% reliable <br/>
people, whom I might press, question, or verify if the info is crucial and I&#39;m <br/>
going to act on it.  There are WAY unreliable people in my life, and I won&#39;t <br/>
act on their reports.<br/>
<br/>
That kind of knowledge and experience affect faith.  <br/>
<br/>
I have great faith in my kids&#39; reports of what they did or what they saw.  <br/>
Given many opportunities to be dishonest they have not been.  If Holly or Marty <br/>
brought me change and said he didn&#39;t have a receipt, I wouldn&#39;t even count it. <br/>
 They are scrupulous with money and accounting.  Kirby is more likely to keep <br/>
the change, but to buy me lunck or give me gas money another time later.  <br/>
That&#39;s not a problem for me either.  He has money of his own.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a lack of faith that would make me question them about something <br/>
they didn&#39;t know or experience directly.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty used to kind of bluff historical fact, and I would press him or look it <br/>
up and show him he was wrong, and should say &quot;I think&quot; instead of &quot;was&quot; which <br/>
totally gets him off the hook when he&#39;s wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I e-mailed Keith and Holly witha  correction after a discussion about the two <br/>
Roosevelt presidents.   Holly asked if Teddy was FDR&#39;s dad, and I said uncle. <br/>
 Turned out I was wrong.  He was Eleanor Roosevelt&#39;s uncle.  She was born <br/>
Roosevelt..  The president gave her away at her wedding.   Franklin was her <br/>
distant cousin, so he was also a distant cousin (fifth, I read when I looked it up) <br/>
of Theodore.<br/>
<br/>
I wan&#39;t very embarrassed to have made the mistake.  I wasn&#39;t an eye-witness. <br/>
I didn&#39;t swear an oath. I had just mis-remembered what I had read years ago.  <br/>
And I was willing to double-check my own answer and amend it.<br/>
<br/>
Last week Marty had role-playing kids over and he yelled outto me from the <br/>
next room, &quot;Mom what&#39;s a buckboard?&quot;  They were playing Deadlands, a wild west <br/>
fantasy game.  I poured forth an answer, but realized nobody had ever asked me <br/>
that before and I had never had a true need to know. I told them it was an <br/>
uncovered four-wheeled  bench in front, bed in back, kind of like a basic <br/>
pickuptruck now.   So when I got a free spot, I went to google images and then to <br/>
dictionary definitions.  What I had described was a buckboard, but there was also <br/>
another type with just a bench and no box/wagonbed.   So I went and told <br/>
Marty and the other guys that though what I had described was right (and it&#39;s what <br/>
they needed anyway, because they needed to imaginarily carry an imaginary <br/>
wounded or dead or enchanted body), that it really had to do with the type of <br/>
suspension and the wagonbed wasn&#39;t a necessity.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I had a bad conversation with Keith&#39;s longtime best friend, who was <br/>
the best man at our wedding 20 years ago.  He is accidentally, at the age of <br/>
47, about to have his first child.   They&#39;re not being thoughtful, and they&#39;ve <br/>
done very little research.  Many things he indicated in that conversation <br/>
disturbed me, but one thing he said was the kid will be confused (the mom is <br/>
Apache and two aunts and her mom plan to take turns taking leave from work to help <br/>
her--they all work for the tribe, mostly in the schools, and Bob works there <br/>
too, formerly as a teacher and now as the computers guy).  So yeah, confusion, <br/>
no planning.  But Bob said without joking &quot;I&#39;ll just tell him to believe what <br/>
I tell him and not the rest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I never expect my children to believe what I say because I say it.  If they <br/>
have faith in my accounts or my opinions, it is or will be ultimately because <br/>
of their experience in finding that what I said matched their own perceptions <br/>
or what they double-checked later.  I don&#39;t ask to take what I say on faith, <br/>
neither about which of their friends might be bad influences, or who Teddy <br/>
Roosevelt&#39;s relatives were, or what a buckboard is.<br/>
<br/>
He also talked about chores (the baby isn&#39;t even born) and said &quot;I was a <br/>
slave for my parents, and my kid&#39;s going to be raised just like I was.&quot;  I said I <br/>
thought it was a really bad idea.  <br/>
<br/>
I sent him some circumcision links, and looked at some other more attachment <br/>
parenting things, and my chores page, but decided he&#39;s just not ready to think <br/>
about it yet. I did tell him not to make any big declarations about what he <br/>
would do when the child is six or twelve, because he hasn&#39;t even met him or her <br/>
yet, and he should make his best decisions as time goes on instead of making <br/>
advance plans.  That made sense to him.<br/>
<br/>
He expressed hope/faith that kid would be reading in just a few years.  I <br/>
suggested he might want to go to my website at some point and read about reading. <br/>
 He knows some kids who are perfectly smart never read well; he taught <br/>
English and has taught ESL (English as a second language) to adults here and in <br/>
China.  I was kind enough not to say, &quot;BOB, what good is reading if you&#39;re going <br/>
to make decisions without any reading/research whatsoever?  Is it just for <br/>
reading fantasy novels and engine tune-up manuals!?&quot;  I thought it, but I didn&#39;t <br/>
say it.<br/>
