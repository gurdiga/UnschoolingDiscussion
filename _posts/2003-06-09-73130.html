At the Coca Cola museum in Atlanta there&#39;s a tasting room.   A couple of <br/>
dozen spigots and thousands of paper cups.  What they have is the Coke products <br/>
for sale in other countries.  Some countries have local flavors they really <br/>
like, or just happen not to like what Americans like.  And there&#39;s a ton of info <br/>
about it there in that big room.  And on screens above they&#39;re showing videos <br/>
of Coke commercials in other countries too.  It&#39;s fascinating.  (I don&#39;t know <br/>
if it&#39;s still set up that way, I went when Holly was little.)<br/>
<br/>
The flavor that is tried the most, that the people have to keep replacing <br/>
tanks on, is a Japanese flavor that&#39;s so freakishly foreign that everybody wants <br/>
to taste it.  Tasted kinda soapy.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an Australian thing I&#39;ve tasted (and sent back for more) that tastes <br/>
oddly soapy too.  LillyPilly Aeroplane Jelly.  It is (in American terminology) <br/>
jello made of a local fruit.  The color is like nothing in the U.S. <br/>
whatsoever, a kind of light blue I had never seen. Looked like light.  Tasted sweet and <br/>
tickly and had a mysterious aftertaste.  And because it was So different I <br/>
wanted more.<br/>
<br/>
Some Australian tell us about this, please.<br/>

Maybe you don&#39;t.<br/>

Sometimes people touch something and then they forget and end up tasting it.<br/>
It happens.<br/>
<br/>
And little kids who pay hard and don&#39;t shower a lot end up smegmatized, upon <br/>

in Tanzania/Kenya, but I don&#39;t care much for it here. I just figured it was<br/>
because it was so much hotter there and we were totally thirsty so it tasted<br/>
better.  I did have to swear off of drinking it past 5:00 pm though after I<br/>
got up to pee in the middle of the night and found an elephant outside our<br/>
tent! My body wasn&#39;t used to the effects of the caffeine (diuretic) and I<br/>
didn&#39;t feel like any more midnight trips to the loo.<br/>
They also had some great, incredibly strong ginger beer over there. Haven&#39;t<br/>
found anything here to match it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you have the yummy Fanta there? We got it in Spain and Portugal (maybe in<br/>
&gt; Morocco...can&#39;t remember). It was SO good.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The yummy fanta.  Hmmm.  Fanta comes in six or eight flavors that I can<br/>
tell.  Limon (lemon), Limette (lime), Orange (not as sweet as the orange<br/>
soda in the states, whatever that is), Wild Berries, and several I can&#39;t<br/>
even remember.  Those four are the most common.<br/>
<br/>
Was it the not-so-sweet Orange you liked?  My favorite is Limette, it tastes<br/>
like carbonated limeade from my childhood, minus all the wierd pulpy stuff.<br/>
Not at all like American lemon-lime sodas, much sharper.  I also like<br/>
Orangina, but that&#39;s not a fanta product.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t been to Spain, Portugal, or Morocco yet, though.  Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
different down there.<br/>
