<br/>
<br/>
Well in our unschooling house today we:<br/>
<br/>
Got up one hour early to prepare a big breakfast for family members on<br/>
their way home today after a wonderful double birthday party yesterday.<br/>
Did not do the dishes.<br/>
Did not make beds or clean the house in any way.<br/>
Hung around the house in our jammies until noon.<br/>
Read to each other for a while.<br/>
Had lunch with some of the same family members who had decided to stay<br/>
and join us at our favorite restaurant.<br/>
Father and son played with Legos.<br/>
Daughter and mother made window decals.<br/>
Went to the movies and saw Stuart Little.<br/>
Came home and ate dinner.<br/>
We are getting ready for baths and books now.<br/>
All in all, minus one small breakdown in the afternoon, it was a pretty<br/>
good day.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for getting me to think about what we did today - we did a lot!<br/>
And had a great time doing it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-970632002">Everyone else is still in bed this morning, so what we did yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
In the morning, we played Sesame Street Memory game and played with <br/>
that little fisherprice toy with the chalkboard and the magnetic <br/>
letters. <br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon we went to a rollerskating birthday party.  <br/>
<br/>
In the evening we were invited to a friend&#39;s church picnic and 3 of <br/>
us went.  The kids played water balloon games.  Dd went on tractor <br/>
rides and played kickball and ds came and sat on my lap after an hour <br/>
of water games while I played dirty bingo and some other games. <br/>
<br/>
The son who stayed home went swimming with his dad for 2 1/2 hours. <br/>
<br/>
Then my boys made cutout cookies.  My daughter tried to make <br/>
smoothies in the blender but didn&#39;t have the blender screwed into the <br/>
bottom right, so when we lifted the blender up, the drink came out <br/>
the bottom.  I spent half an hour cleaning smoothie up off the <br/>
counter, cupboards, and floor.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, each of my kids had a turn with their own &quot;sleepover&quot; with me.  <br/>
We pull out the sleeper sofa and watch whatever movie they pick to <br/>
fall asleep to.  Last night was my three year old&#39;s turn, so we fell <br/>
asleep to Thomas and the Magic Railroad.   <br/>
<br/>
It was a good day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411030563">Ds is out of town, and my parents were here yesterday. After church, we came<br/>
home and I made a real &quot;Sunday dinner pot roast&quot; lunch, then my parents left<br/>
to go home and I cleaned up. Dd played with friends while dh and I took a<br/>
nap (or tried to, at least, between shrieks and slamming doors). Then dd and<br/>
I went to a pool party where she went off the diving board (my baby&#39;s<br/>
growing up!) She was worn out when we got home so we snuggled and read two<br/>
Dr. Suess books and several chapters of James and the Giant Peach. On the<br/>
various car rides she sounded out words she saw on signs, asked me how to<br/>
spell a couple of words she&#39;d encountered, we talked about how you can love<br/>
someone and still disagree with them, and she mentioned she thought she was<br/>
ready to be on her own and would like to get married. She just turned six.<br/>

Surprisingly, it was pretty good.  I only had the urge to fall fast<br/>
asleep once during the whole movie.  Actually, I really like Hugh Laurie<br/>
(he&#39;s the dad) from his Black Adder and then Jeeves and Wooster days, so<br/>
I&#39;ll put up with a lot to see him.  But both the kids walked out  of the<br/>
theater explaining to me why we had to own this movie when it comes out<br/>
on video.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I love hearing about what other people do during their unschooling,<br/>
life living/loving days.  Maybe we could share more?  I know it bores<br/>
some people, but I&#39;m interested.<br/>

who is off with the kids to buy a new french door for their back room<br/>
and is so excited about having a door that actually opens she can hardly<br/>
stand it!</div>

thought it was better than the first one. We recommend seeing it!<br/>
