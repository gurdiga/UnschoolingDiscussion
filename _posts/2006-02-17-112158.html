<div id="ygrps-yiv-280862688">&quot;-=-What schools call &quot;math&quot; is actually a foreign language.-=-&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a &quot;language&quot; that can be understood by all sorts of people that<br/>
don&#39;t speak the same language!:) <br/>
<br/>
Math is actually a natural instinct imo. It&#39;s when you try to teach<br/>
someone the notation/symbolism for no other purpose than the idea that<br/>
&quot;you&#39;ll need this one day&quot;, that it becomes problematic.<br/>
<br/>
Real life useage just happens as people interact with their community.<br/>
And it doesn&#39;t seem foreign at all  that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988919978">&quot;And on the tail of saying that I could feel rising<br/>
up inside of me this desire to talk about how hard that is to become a<br/>
marine biologist. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was talked out of pursuing Marine Biology that very way. In Jr.<br/>
High, I was fascinated with the idea of studying ocean life. I thought<br/>
 I would LOVE that job. You know what my parents said &quot;You better<br/>
start doing better at math, that job involved a LOT of math&quot; and laughed.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh. That was like a big puncture to MY balloon. I hated math. I knew<br/>
I couldn&#39;t do anything with lotsa math. I never wanted to take math again.<br/>
<br/>
They could have gotten excited with me, taken me to aquariums, helped<br/>
me set up tanks, gotten me movies etc... and FED the interest. By the<br/>
time I would have needed the math, I would have been older and more<br/>
capable. Who knows where it might have led?  Even if I&#39;d decided NOT<br/>
to become a biologist, I would have felt honored and like my interests<br/>
mattered.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad you were able to shift the focus of your conversation<br/>
to support his interest in sharks.<br/>
