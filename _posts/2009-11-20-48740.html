<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841329418">Hi all,<br/>
I just watched this really great documentary with my children.  It&#39;s about<br/>
how Mark Bittner, who lives in Telegraph Hill (San Francisco), was searching<br/>
for his vocation.  He tried playing music, and he found himself working all<br/>
kinds of miscellaneous jobs, but he didn&#39;t know what to do with himself,<br/>
career-wise.  He starts reading poet Gary Snyder, and decides to start<br/>
feeding some of the local birds in an attempt to &quot;get back to nature.&quot;  He<br/>
finds himself fascinated by the local non-native parrots, and becomes very<br/>
interested in them.  His interest morphs into a passion, and eventually<br/>
finds himself borrowing cameras to take pictures, buying professional film,<br/>
keeping daily logs, and becoming a real nature scientist.  He reads all he<br/>
can about the birds and eventually writes a book.  No one had ever really<br/>
been able to study parrots in their native habitat because it was too<br/>
difficult, but he is able to study them in S.F.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link about Mark Bittner <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wildparrotsbook.com/">http://www.wildparrotsbook.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
and you can view it on Netflix Play Instantly.  I watched it with my five<br/>
and three year old, and I can say everyone in the family really enjoyed it.<br/>
The birds are amusing to watch, ( my three yr old son was often cackling at<br/>
their antics,) and with Mark&#39;s back stories on the birds, it&#39;s really<br/>
interesting.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Some schooled kids are told by their parents that homeschooled kids are<br/>
&gt; not learning b/c they are not in school. I don&#39;t care what people tell their<br/>
&gt; kids. However, when those kids (9 year-olds) come to my house and make those<br/>
&gt; remarks to my kids when I am not in the room, I am offended.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I dont know about your specific situation but in the past for us it isnt<br/>
&gt; that the kids have been told that homeschooled kids are not learning. It has<br/>
&gt; been that they have been told that the reason they have to go to school is<br/>
&gt; to learn and if they dont, how will they learn xyorz.<br/>
&gt; One little boy came up to a friend of ours and asked her, not meanly or<br/>
&gt; anything, how she knows how to read since she doesnt go to school. His<br/>
&gt; parents had never said anything like that but they had told him when he<br/>
&gt; asked why he had to go to schoool that it was so he could learn to read. So<br/>
&gt; he assumed you dont learn to read unless you go to school. As soon as he<br/>
&gt; found out that you can indeed learn without going to school he has been<br/>
&gt; begging to be homeschooled.<br/>
