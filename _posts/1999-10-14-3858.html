We have done the &quot;hot water freezes faster&quot; experiment at home (just to <br/>
prove it to my husband who didn&#39;t believe me when I told him ... when&#39;s he <br/>
gonna learn that I know everything ;)) in the freezer, and it really does <br/>
freeze faster.  However, it freezes differently, also.  The ice that results <br/>
in an ordinary ice tray in the freezer when cold water is frozen is &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
ice, safe to put into your ice tea or Pepsi Cola.  the ice frozen from very <br/>
hot water, while freezing faster, is not always so safe.  it has a tendency <br/>
to explode rather violently when put into anything warm or hot, like freshly <br/>
made hot tea that is being iced or Pepsi that has been sitting in a closet <br/>
rather than the refrigerator.  And if put into cold liquid, such as Pepsi <br/>
that cames from the refrigerator, it has a tendency to &quot;slush up&quot; more than <br/>
ice made with cold water.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, while I don&#39;t really understand the reasons for hot water <br/>
freezing faster, it isn&#39;t practical to freeze hot water into ice to be used <br/>
for drinking purposes unless you like exploding ice.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Try it ... I&#39;m really not kidding.<br/>
