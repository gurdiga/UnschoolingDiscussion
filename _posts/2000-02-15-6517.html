<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791375892">Oh dear! My mother never allowed discussions of religion or politics during family gatherings or during the holidays....created too many bad feelings in a matter of seconds that took years to repair.....are you all related to me? She felt that their friendship was too valuable to risk over something that had no true answer in a circle of more than one person. I have noted before that this list is my MAIN line of support for UNschooling and I hate to see it marred down with anger....<br/>
 <br/>
So......has anyone tried to garden with an &quot;Earth Box&quot;? They are quite pricey but we love to try new things.  Any info would be helpfull........Thx, Aleasa</div>

<br/>
Last week, tho, we got our tomato seeds from NASA.  Ones that have been up on <br/>
the shuttle and not and you are to plant and compare their growth, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
But then, the night after we planted, we had a huge rain and I think it <br/>
drowned the little seeds.  <br/>
<br/>
I am going to reorder (it&#39;s FREE!!!) and we&#39;ll give it another try.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, the lesson here was -- patience!!  Mostly for Mom I htink.<br/>
