<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132926922">&quot;If anyone knows her real name, could you e-mail me on the side?  Accusations <br/>
that I have passed someone else&#39;s words off as my own (plagiarism) or taken <br/>
money on false pretenses (fraud) are pretty serious accusations.  Baseless, and<br/>
 <br/>
reckless, and they serve NO useful purpose for the accuser.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know I already mentioned this to you privately, but I didn&#39;t think it would hurt for it to be at the list....<br/>
I REALLY believe her accusations and insinuations are either bordering on, or ARE libelous. Libel is anything that harms a persons reputation, and I think people need to be more careful about the words they sling around about a person that IS a public figure whether they like it or not.<br/>
Accusing someone of not writing what they have indeed written for years is probably libel...but I&#39;m not an expert.<br/>
<br/>
I say this because I think people should be more careful.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Jeva came to this list with her ideas well formed and ready to teach us all a lesson. Lynda (who had cause many problems here in the past) had told her some things and so she had already decided who Sandra was and didn&#39;t have an open mind in any way.<br/>
Her FIRST post at RUL was a negative attack on Sandra, which resulted in many posts in support, with the exception of Glena&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to write another rebuttal over there, but decided to keep it here, where maybe some positive stuff can flow around and squash all the negativity.<br/>
<br/>
I know this person had her ideas well formed because ALL of us wrote to her and I thought Joyce was the most outspoken of anyone, but she chose to hone in on Sandra, who hadn&#39;t said much at all and certainly not anything that could be construed as an attack.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what I wanted to say in rebuttal to the accusations was that I had met Marty in person and I KNOW without a doubt, that a person full of S*** about unschooling and gentle parenting wouldn&#39;t have a kid like that. NO WAY.<br/>
So, I saw all the truth of Sandra&#39;s words up close and in the flesh, I saw how he had empathy for his mother, true concern and I know that doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum. I spent time chatting with him and know that ONLY a child respected deeply and given the freedom that is spoken of here, would have the kind calm self assurance he possessed. <br/>
<br/>
I know Sandra writes her own words because I&#39;ve helped her with something she was working on, and she has helped me (asking nothing in return) countless times with my writing. <br/>
<br/>
I am appalled and angry that anyone would make false accusations towards a person that has selflessly and patiently helped so many of us. I&#39;m upset that the list could get derailed so efficiently by ONE person with preconcieved notions. <br/>

Ren, that&#39;s sweet.  I forwarded it to Keith and read it to Marty and put it <br/>
in the Marty-diary.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a good guy, and I&#39;m always glad to be able to give him some positive <br/>
feedback.<br/>

<br/>
I joined RUL and had a look at the archives.  I didn&#39;t go way back, but it<br/>
seemed that the first post there about Sandra was from Lynda.  Big surprise<br/>
. . . not.  I sometimes wonder if she could be putting people up to coming<br/>
over here to stir up shit.  This last episode had all the markings of troll<br/>
work.  First troll comes in and posts stuff in opposition to the beliefs<br/>
here.  She gets lots of calm and considered posts about it, which she<br/>
basically ignores.  Then people get frustrated.  Troll number two comes on<br/>
board and is appalled at the way troll number 1 is being treated.  As<br/>
theWorld Turns.<br/>
<br/>
It does appear to me that there is an attempt to destroy Sandra&#39;s<br/>
reputation.  I know that Puddles tried pretty hard to get Sandra fired as a<br/>
HEM writer.<br/>

This would explain why she is over there eating all this up. She<br/>
never <br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t know that.  I don&#39;t even remember who Puddles is.<br/>
<br/>
There was a (very small) campaign of lies designed to threaten that they (a <br/>
small e-mail loop) would boycott any conferences at which I spoke.  They hadn&#39;t <br/>
been going to the conferences anyway, but one of the organizers (maybe the <br/>
only one they contacted) let me comment on what they had sent her.  It was <br/>
nonsense.  <br/>
<br/>
What would it benefit any of these people if they could shush me?  Would THEY <br/>
then be helping people every day?  (If they can why aren&#39;t they doing it now?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This has the extreme tone of &quot;You looked at me funny when I drove past, so <br/>
I&#39;m going to firebomb your garage.&quot;  Quite out of proportion to anything really <br/>
happening, it seems.<br/>

<br/>
I thought you meant some kind of organized campaign behind my back.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I went shopping today for stuff my mom needed.  I expected him to <br/>
want to stay home, but he wanted to go with me.  We looked at the games and <br/>
bought a box of stuff on optical illusions, and looked at used furniture and <br/>
reminisced about beds and chairs we have known.  Then we went to the grocery store <br/>
and got just the bread he wanted for turkey sandwiches.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly came home from her day off and gave me a sweet lean-and-hug.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith came hme from work and was doing yard work because it&#39;s cooler than <br/>
usual and raining lightly.  <br/>
<br/>
Other than the weirdness, it&#39;s been a really peaceful day.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  And there&#39;s some really good recent stuff at &lt;A HREF=&quot;www.unschooling.com&quot;&gt;www.unschooling.com&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
(message boards) and thanks to those who went over there when it got boring here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949486012">I believe she could take issue if she wanted to. Sandra had made a name for <br/>
herself and has spent years building that weather she has known that or not. I <br/>
believe this person and another have stepped over the line of slander and <br/>
defamation of character. One could argue that these &quot;false&quot; statements are <br/>
disrupting ones peaceful life and career.<br/>
 I signed on to the other list and it is just rocking me. I keep wanting so <br/>
bad to post (I did once) but I don&#39;t want to get blasted for being the newbie <br/>
over there so I will be quiet. Ive been there bf not sure why I left?  I&#39;ll <br/>
