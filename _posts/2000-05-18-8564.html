<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820517104">Our homeschool theater group is right in the middle of six performances of The Wizard of Oz, so I barely have time to breath right now. I allow myself a few minutes to check e-mail in the morning and I&#39;ve notice a thread re. wild animals. <br/>
<br/>
The last couple of days we&#39;ve have a crazy robin trying to get into the house. I know that birds will sometimes see trees or sky reflected in glass and try to fly into it, but this bird is relentless in it&#39;s quest: it perches on a chair and flies right at the window, falls to the deck, gets back onto the chair and does it again...and again...and again. We tried putting a drawing of a ferocious face on the window, then we put strips of newspaper that flutter in the breeze, but still this kamakazee bird keeps on. Our three cats sit inside, mesmerized, in full view. The bird also did the same thing a couple of days ago next door.<br/>
<br/>
Any wildlife experts have any ideas?<br/>
