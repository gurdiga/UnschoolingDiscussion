<div id="ygrps-yiv-280146547">Pam, I think I see your point.  I too know many kind, good people who<br/>
enjoy this kind of &quot;entertainment&quot; (my DH included).  But 1) it is<br/>
different for an adult who truly understands it is fiction and<br/>
&quot;entertainment&quot; than it is for a child whose brain is trying to figure<br/>
out the world, and 2) how might our world be different if millions of<br/>
people (my DH included - I&#39;m not picking on you and yours) spent that<br/>
time doing something else?  Not to mention the billions of dollars that<br/>
goes into the whole industry of movie making.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Ellen<br/>
Thanks.  I needed that.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My husband loves &quot;action flicks&quot; and horror movies. Blood, gore,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>decapitations -- bring &#39;em on. I don&#39;t know what possible good he gets<br/>
from<br/>
them, but I know when it comes down to it, he remains a good man -- kind,<br/>
compassionate, not prone to violence.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I take it back -- I suspect what &quot;good&quot; comes from it in his<br/>
case<br/>
is a chance to vent. Is it healthy? He appears healthy. He has made solid<br/>
and lasting relationships. Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck... is a<br/>
duck. Looks healthy, acts healthy... is healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Now me, I hate horror movies and can only tolerate action movies by<br/>
covering<br/>
my eyes during the violent scenes until Wally taps me on the shoulder and<br/>
says, &quot;it&#39;s over&quot;. I don&#39;t appear to be less violent than he is. Not more<br/>
so, but not less.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s easy to blame television, but I don&#39;t feel &quot;desensitized&quot; in<br/>
the least. I ache on those few occasions I witness real-life violence. So<br/>
does my husband, though it&#39;s fun for him to watch Mel Gibson get beat up<br/>
by<br/>
the bad guys and win the day in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Reality is reality, fantasy is fantasy, and when the twain meet, I look<br/>
to<br/>
the character and health of the individual, not to the medium whether<br/>
that&#39;s<br/>
television, radio, books, fireside songs or racial memory.<br/>

needlepoint (and I&#39;m just starting to get competent!) and staring out the<br/>
window. :)<br/>
<br/>
Point 1 is of course well taken, but what I am finding is that my daughter<br/>
self-regulates. If I *were* of the mind (which I&#39;m not) to let her watch<br/>
horror movies, she wouldn&#39;t. She&#39;s a sensitive girl. I don&#39;t think most<br/>
small children want to watch horrific violence on screen or off, (maybe<br/>
sometimes if it&#39;s high fantasy -- i.e, Jurassic Park.)<br/>
<br/>
So what does that leave us with? Cartoon violence? The evening news?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have little children, in the &quot;fantasy is reality&quot; years of oh,<br/>
say, 2 to 6, who *want* to watch very violent &quot;real life type&quot; movies? It<br/>
would surprise me, but maybe I&#39;m too used to living with my clone, the girl<br/>
who makes me put away all the Disney videos that are &quot;too bad&quot; to watch.<br/>

watch it, even at other people&#39;s houses.  The do not watch a lot of popular<br/>
cartoons which I feel are too violent for them or have other elements I do<br/>
not like, such as poor values, lack of respect for others showed, rudeness,<br/>
unhealthy relationships, etc.<br/>
<br/>
However, my niece and nephew, now teenagers, were allowed to watch<br/>
&quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; Movies when they were in the age range you<br/>

it&#39;s not real, it&#39;s just make believe.&quot;  and would them have them parrot<br/>
back what she had said.  I can&#39;t help cringing when I think about it<br/>
though.  Also how many of us know little ones who are crazy about &quot;Power<br/>
Rangers&quot; or another violence based show?  I know a few, to say the least.<br/>
The first thing that comes to mind when I think about the children who are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-925457566">I hope your asbestos jacket is not necessary but keep it nearby in case this is<br/>
hotter than I think it is.<br/>
<br/>
There is a very big difference between &quot;protecting&quot; children from drugs, sex<br/>
and violence in an authoritarian and /or deceitful fashion (which frequently<br/>
leads to rebellion and often acting out the proscribed behaviours) and<br/>
protecting young children from gratuitous exposure to those same things.<br/>
<br/>
Of course most children are resilient enough to not be permanently damaged by<br/>
exposure to such things however I think there is evidence that exposure to such<br/>
things can have lasting effects on the sensibilities of children.  They will<br/>
armour themselves emotionally and toughen themselves in a way which detracts<br/>
from the kind of openness I personally want to foster in my children.<br/>
<br/>
My children will and have inevitably been exposed to the violence and genuine<br/>
horror in the world.  They are initially horrified.  They adapt.  I am glad it<br/>
happened in a way which was modulated by our intervention.<br/>
<br/>
Our six year old daughter watched Bambi for the first time with no ill<br/>
effects.  Her older sister would have not been ready at six. We won&#39;t let her<br/>
watch Star Wars which her 10 year old sister just watched.  We screened the<br/>
Star Wars trilogy for the older when little sister was doing something else.<br/>
Little sister thought it terribly unfair but this is understandable.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a possible confusion to equate the oppressive practices of your<br/>
parents with protecting children from unnecessary exposure to horror, gore,<br/>
promiscuous sexuality, violence whether it be physical or psychological.<br/>
<br/>
Documentaries can be every bit if not more disturbing and damaging to children<br/>
as fiction.  Roots is full of adult/older child themes and scenes.  The news is<br/>
unsuitable for very young children.  They will deal with all of those issues<br/>
when they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot &quot;protect&quot; our children from all that is harsh and negative and<br/>
horrifying even if we set out to do that.  This does not mean that we should<br/>
not try to protect them from those things that we can.  Protecting does not<br/>
mean saying &quot;Don&#39;t do that.  Its very bad and dangerous.&quot;  It is much more<br/>
complicated and involves really communicating with children not handing down<br/>
edicts from on high.<br/>
<br/>
Our children protest when they can&#39;t watch something that we want to watch but<br/>
is not appropriate for them (doesn&#39;t happen often) but that is okay.  We are a<br/>
democracy but as parents hold a number of vetoes which the children do not<br/>
have. We use them with discretion, respect and restraint. (at least when we are<br/>
behaving as adults).<br/>
<br/>
Interesting topic.<br/>

with you.  I have seen families though,  where the kids couldn&#39;t <br/>
self-regulate.  This happened for many reasons,  but the biggest <br/>
being that they didn&#39;t have a choice.  They were exposed to movies <br/>
that they weren&#39;t ready for by older siblings or parents.  We were <br/>
very careful about this.  The kids were comfortable telling us what <br/>
they were ready for.  My daughter is 6 years older than my son so <br/>
there was a time when we had a second tv and vcr so that her choices <br/>
didn&#39;t have to be his.  I definitely think self-regulation works but <br/>
it has to happen in the right environment.<br/>

don&#39;t like Disney Movies....they love old movies. They do not enjoy any<br/>
movies where people or animals are being maliciously hurt or killed. <br/>
<br/>
That is their choice. And I find it interesting that they steer away from<br/>
violent movies. They can tell when the music changes that &quot;something is<br/>
going to happen&quot; and they leave the room. They are usually right.<br/>

I think that childrens minds are as fragile and in need of protection as<br/>
their young bodies. Why can&#39;t children live in innocence for a while? Why<br/>
do we want them to be &#39;adult&#39; before their time? What is the big hurry?  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t tell my daughter to go hang-gliding or play in the traffic  nor<br/>
would I introduce her to  harmful visual imagery that could be ingrained in<br/>
her heart,soul and mind for eternity. I find it very strange that people<br/>
will protect their children from physical pain but expose them to<br/>
psychologically-damaging TV and movie violence. <br/>
<br/>
Blast away (pun intended)....I feel strongly about TV viewing, violence,<br/>
and loose gun laws (is my Canadian side showing?):)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are assuming that everyone agrees with you on your opinion that violence<br/>
in tv and movies is psychologically-damaging. Not everyone *does* agree, so<br/>
it is not at all strange that those who don&#39;t also do not protect their<br/>
children from it.<br/>
<br/>
Some people believe that Pit Bulls are child-eating savages, across the<br/>
board. It would seem very strange to those people that Pit Bulls are one of<br/>
the breeds I am most relaxed to have my children around. In their opinion, I<br/>
might as well be sending my children out to play on the freeway. My opinion<br/>
is different.<br/>
<br/>
All lives contain some risk.<br/>
<br/>
Some feel that risk comes from Pit Bulls, from violent TV, from school<br/>
shootings, from home intruders, from forcing curriculum on their children,<br/>
from coersion in any form, from absolute non-coersion, from CO2, from rock<br/>
concerts doing ear damage, from Teletubbies promoting a gay lifestyle, from<br/>
elephants crashing through their tent, from nests of wasps, from allergic<br/>
reactions to wool, from incompetent ER doctors at 3 a.m., from walking<br/>
across a street, driving anywhere in a car, from rare airborne diseases,<br/>
from raw meat, from shark attack, well, you get the idea...<br/>
<br/>
Any decent parent evaluates the risk, forms their own opinion, and acts<br/>
accordingly. It has nothing to do with wanting children to be adult before<br/>
their time. It has to do with *personal opinion on the risk involved*<br/>
