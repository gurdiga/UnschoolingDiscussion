<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514763109">MIL was here for a couple days, and oh, such negativity! Everything <br/>
ds did was going to lead to him breaking his neck or some such thing. <br/>
At one point she actually told him &#39;you can&#39;t see out that window&#39;. <br/>
Not &quot;don&#39;t look&quot; but trying to tell him he couldn&#39;t do something he <br/>
was doing. Weird.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, is this something parents have always done in <br/>
different cultures throughout history, or is it specific to this time <br/>
and place? She&#39;s 77, so lived through the Depression and WWII, if <br/>
that means anything. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
p.s. The obligatory &#39;child chooses fruit&#39; story: ds ordered apple <br/>
cheesecake, ate the apples but not the cheesecake. And kindly offered <br/>
to share the cheesecake w/ everybody else, telling us it was &quot;tummy-<br/>
tickling tasty&quot;!</div>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about it being specific to this time and place, but it <br/>
sure runs rampant around here.  My FIL just has to say someting <br/>
negative (which he sees as helpful advice) about *everything*.  His <br/>
dad is the same way, and my husband has had to learn to see how <br/>
painful it can be to children, including his own little child <br/>
inside.  He&#39;s one of those that in the past would say, &quot;That&#39;s a <br/>
pretty tree you drew, but the trunk should be brown instead of <br/>
purple.&quot; Yuck.  To his credit, he can now allow himself to feel the <br/>
pain of his dad&#39;s words so he can more clearly see that that&#39;s not <br/>
what he wants to do to his kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday FIL was here looking at the frog house L & L (5yo)<br/>
built and he just had to take the wind out of their sails by <br/>
saying, &quot;You really should put some more grass in there,&quot; etc.  I <br/>
had to shoot him a look and say, &quot;I think the frog looks very <br/>
comfortable in there.  Lena and Liberty worked hard making the house <br/>
and I can tell the frog appreciates everything they put in there.  <br/>
Don&#39;t you think so, girls?&quot;  I don&#39;t know if that was the right <br/>
thing or not, but I always feel like I have to undo those kinds of <br/>
remarks.  <br/>
