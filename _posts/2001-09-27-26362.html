will experience it in a different way and then tell it back to someone in a <br/>
different way.  Just because I discover a lot of families along the way <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I can talk about what worked and didn&#39;t work for them, because <br/>
it&#39;s not my experience.  I can only share my experience.  Sometimes that <br/>
helps people and sometimes not.... It&#39;s ok either way, it&#39;s just my <br/>
experience on this journey of life.   Keeping in mind that death is the <br/>
destination.  IMHO<br/>

&lt;&lt; Just because I discover a lot of families along the way <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I can talk about what worked and didn&#39;t work for them, because <br/>
it&#39;s not my experience.  I can only share my experience.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I tell a story about a family I&#39;ve known for fifteen years and the kids <br/>
are still in my life, there is as much usefulness to that as those who can <br/>
make use of it want to take!  The lead story at unschooling.com, by Carol <br/>
Rice, is there because I know Carol well enough to have gotten her permission <br/>
to post it.  I know all four of her kids.  I knew them before they could <br/>
read, and I know them now that they are teens and read.   How could it be <br/>
something I don&#39;t know?  I never claim they&#39;re my kids.  It was at their <br/>
house Kirby first played a Nintendo.  <br/>
<br/>
I know my sister&#39;s family intimately, and the story of their homeschooling is <br/>
something I know in detail.  (At the moment, one&#39;s home, one&#39;s in public Jr. <br/>
High and one&#39;s paying half his tuition to a private school, for the purpose <br/>
of being on their basketball team.)<br/>
<br/>
Those are part of my experience.<br/>
<br/>
Each person would have different details or a different flavor, but the basic <br/>
facts wouldn&#39;t change.<br/>
<br/>
When another homeschooling mom talks to me for hours about how things are <br/>
going for her and how her husband feels about this or that, or why she had to <br/>
buy Oak Meadoww this year, or how it went putting her kids in a charter <br/>
school (and pulling them back out) that becomes part of my own data bank.  If <br/>
it&#39;s someone I know well enough to trust her word and account, I&#39;m willing to <br/>
advise others based on her satisfaction or dissatisfaction (Monica liked it, <br/>
but Sara didn&#39;t...).  If it&#39;s someone I don&#39;t really trust, I just let the <br/>
noise flow by and don&#39;t save any details for the future.<br/>
<br/>
My life seems always to have includes lots more than my own family.<br/>

mistakes in order to learn from them. I can see someone else touch an<br/>
electric fence and get shocked, and learn not to touch it without<br/>
experiencing the shock myself. Actually, in my case it was a dog that<br/>
touched the fence first, but the point is the same...<br/>
