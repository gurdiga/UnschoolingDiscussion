<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437879594">Yesterday there was a chat on musical intelligence and musicality.<br/>
It was a pretty good chat. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Today I’m cleaning off the notes around my computer, and one was a half-quote from something a on CBS Sunday morning a few days ago.  Keith Urban was being profiled in a nice piece. The interviewer said, “There are certainly those songs that you’ve got to play over and over that…” and Keith said “That we *get* to play over and over again.  Thank goodness people want to hear them.”<br/>
<br/>
That wasn’t the only evidence of his upbeat attitude!  I don’t know if this will be viewable in all parts of the world, but here’s the video:<br/>

<br/>
He talks about having failed school music, and not understanding music theory.   He also talks about the importance of rhythm.  His dad was a drummer and he was around that.  Also he talks about his parents having let him leave school early to pursue music.<br/>
<br/>
But for me personally I loved his interruption of someone insisting “have to” and changing it to “get to.” :-)<br/>
