<br/>
&quot;Jerome Brunner once said, very aptly, that much of what we do and say in <br/>
school only makes children feel that they do not know things that, in fact, <br/>
they knew perfectly well before we began to talk about them. I have often <br/>
seen this in mathematics, where fifth-graders, confused and frightened by <br/>
rules and magic recipes, are unable to use either rules or common sense to do <br/>
problems that they could easily have done a few years before . And what is <br/>
true of school, is often true of home. A child&#39;s understanding of the world <br/>
is uncertain and tentative. If we question him too much or too sharply, we <br/>
are more likely to weaken that understanding than strengthen it. His <br/>
understanding will grow faster if we can make ourselves have faith in it and <br/>
leave it alone.&quot;<br/>

An Unschooling Day<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My 8y.o. son and 4y.o. daughter found a skeletonized squirrel in the yard <br/>
which really excited them. They came barreling in the house exclaiming &quot;this <br/>
is really cool Mom you HAVE to come see this&quot;. They weren&#39;t sure what it was <br/>
but because some fur and skin were still holding it together they soon <br/>
figured it out. I came out and helped them salvage some of the skeleton for <br/>
observation. Now, I could have said &quot;oooh, that thing is disgusting. Get it <br/>
off the driveway&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or something to that effect.<br/>
<br/>
But because I didn&#39;t here&#39;s what it led to.....<br/>
<br/>
We picked out some bones and glued them to a piece of cardboard...they made <br/>
guesses at what bone it was. Online they reconstructed an entire skeleton, <br/>
the website led us to owl pellets, then the Oakland zoo, green monkeys, <br/>
Muntjacks (don&#39;t even ask how long we spent on the various species of <br/>
Muntjacks), somehow in between all this we got hungry and made Potato Latkes <br/>
which we ate with chopsticks that the kids were fascinated with at the <br/>
grocery store. Later, they read a book and watched a movie in which <br/>
chopsticks were used (no, this was not planned...just serendipity). <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you the things we learned or it would take up way too much room <br/>
here.<br/>
One thing just naturally led to another. One of my children popped in <br/>
occasionally to see what we were up to and absorbed only a few tidbits while <br/>
happily roller blading the rest of the time.<br/>
<br/>
So the moral of the story is it&#39;s us, the parents that must change. <br/>
Unschooling works. It always works. But only if we can be as excited and <br/>
interested as our children.<br/>
<br/>
Or at least offer an avenue for them. Not everyone would be able to not get <br/>
squeamish at a dead squirrel...but &quot;hey, here are some gloves and a jar&quot; <br/>
would at least not slam the door of opportunity in their face.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry anymore that my children won&#39;t learn everything they need to <br/>
for this life. I also see that joyful learning can only happen if we are open <br/>
and totally willing to see every moment, every interest, everything as <br/>
opportunity. We never know what a tidbit of information, or an experience <br/>
might lead to...and not knowing can bring a sense of mystery to this whole <br/>
Unschooling life. If we keep that sense of mystery, that feeling that this <br/>
COULD lead to big things, (but if it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s ok too) we will so much <br/>
better be able to serve our children well when supporting and encouraging <br/>
their unique interests and pursuits. That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about for me.<br/>
<br/>
Being an avenue instead of a closed door.<br/>

Should you too happen to find an animal skeleton, here are a couple of great <br/>
web resources.<br/>

Photos of fossil skeletons. You probably won&#39;t be putting one together <br/>
yourself, but they sure are fun to look at!<br/>

More Skeletons<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Speaking of road kill, unschooling led us down a path that sure wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have happened if we weren&#39;t an unschooling family!<br/>
<br/>
Eldest son read some books about tanning hides and how early civilizations <br/>
and First Nations didn&#39;t waste anything and would skin and tan the hides of <br/>
animals found dead. He then read about a man that collected ridicule and <br/>
tanned the hides.<br/>
<br/>
YUCK!!! But, unless it is truly dangerous, in our family, there is no &quot;no.&quot; <br/>
We (mom, dad and kidlet) talked to our family doctor and our vet about <br/>
potential problems. We went shopping and got him some masks which he <br/>
sprinkled with cologne, some surgical gloves, disinfectant and gave him a <br/>
corner of the shed farthest from the house.<br/>
<br/>
He knew more about anatomy and dissecting by the time he was ten than most <br/>
college students that come out of a biology class with a lab! And he learned <br/>
all kinds of tanning methods. And he did skeleton cards of each species he <br/>
found.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was kewl!<br/>

Unschooling-dotcom Email Discussion List<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is a whole lot harder to talk about what unschooling looks like in <br/>
practice, because it is totally absolutely and completely different for every <br/>
family. And it isn&#39;t easily described by a list like schooling is - it isn&#39;t <br/>
an alternative method of schooling like doing unit studies is, for example. <br/>
<br/>
It takes time to read about unschooling and really &quot;grok&quot; it - it takes <br/>
reading LOTS of people&#39;s anecdotes and reading their philosophies and how <br/>
they apply it in their lives and thinking about how that philosophy might <br/>
apply in your own family&#39;s life while understanding that it will LOOK really <br/>
different in your family, even if the underlying principles are the same.&quot;<br/>

Unschooling-dotcom Email List Welcome and Group Description<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what they <br/>
need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent is a <br/>
facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and <br/>
enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and <br/>
how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>
Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to find out more <br/>
about how video games and life in general are filled with learning, come join <br/>
us!<br/>
<br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is <br/>
*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed <br/>
learning nor is it done on a part time basis. We advise reading for a week or <br/>
two before posting to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many <br/>
listmembers love a lively debate and questioning beliefs to their <br/>
foundations. If you have questions about this list please feel free to <br/>

This moment of childish wonder comes from my friend Jennifer:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Eric has had an earache and hasn&#39;t been feeling that well until today.  He <br/>
was also nauseous over the weekend.  Mike told him how the inner ear affects <br/>
balance, and I suppose Jacy was listening. Just a few minutes ago she was <br/>
spinning around in the kitchen, making herself dizzy.  I could see a light <br/>
bulb had just gone off in her head and she said, &quot;Mom!  I bet I know why you <br/>
get dizzy when you spin.  The fluid in your ear moves around and when you <br/>
stop it&#39;s still sloshing around and that makes you feel dizzy.&quot;  I told her I <br/>
had never thought about it, but she was probably right.  We went to the <br/>
internet and found this site:  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/bigear.html">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/bigear.html</a><br/>
<br/>
So, she was absolutely right.  Funny how I never even wondered why that <br/>
happened.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Now What?<br/>
<br/>
By now we all know that yes, unschooled kids can get into college. But what <br/>
about those kids who don&#39;t want to go to college, or maybe just don&#39;t want to <br/>
go &quot;yet&quot;? How can we as parents support them in their entry into the adult <br/>
world? How can help them find the best path toward their own goals?<br/>
<br/>
Many families have found Herbert Kohl&#39;s book &quot;The Question is College&quot; to be <br/>
a valuable tool to help their teens define their goals and develop a guide <br/>
for their futures. It differs from other interest and talent inventory and <br/>
mapping tools by not assuming that college is a necessary step in the process.<br/>
<br/>
Are your teens considering college, apprenticeship, full time work, travel, <br/>
or something else? Come to the Unschooling.com message boards and share your <br/>
stories! Let&#39;s talk about all the ways unschooled kids transition into the <br/>
adult world.<br/>
