He agreed without knowing what it would be like.   You can&#39;t hold an<br/>
eleven<br/>

<br/>
Would you hold yourself to finish a course you really hated?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes I would.  If I have made a commitment to something, I need to see it<br/>
though to the end, at 11 or 36 years of age.  A commitment is a<br/>
commitment.  I hope that this is something that I am teaching my<br/>
children - follow through.  I am at the tail end of a year long<br/>
commitment to something that I am not liking.  But I chose to do this,<br/>
maybe without fully knowing what I was getting myself into, and I have<br/>
certainly wanted to run screaming in the opposite direction more than a<br/>
few times this past year, but in the process of fulfilling my commitment<br/>
I have learned things about myself.  I think that learning to follow<br/>
through on your agreements is character building, and that in my book is<br/>
absolutely necessary.<br/>

To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its<br/>

to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and<br/>
never stop fighting.<br/>

aren&#39;t enjoying?<br/>
<br/>
To me, though, a committment is when I&#39;ve said I&#39;ll do something and other<br/>
people are counting on me to do it. Who am I inconveniencing or hurting if I<br/>
don&#39;t complete something I&#39;ve begun for myself if I&#39;m not enjoying it?<br/>
<br/>
I think learning to stick with something you dislike is much easier than<br/>
learning to discern when it&#39;s best to stick something out and when to cut<br/>
your losses. In fact millions of kids are learning that first lesson right<br/>
now in school.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We can learn from adversity. We can also learn in the absence of adversity.<br/>
Are the lessons learned from imposed adversity worth the imposing? Or could<br/>
we have learned something even better with the time we spent doing something<br/>
we didn&#39;t enjoy?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think learning not to inconvenience others for frivolous reasons is part<br/>
of being a decent human being. If I agree to take a class, who am I<br/>
inconveniencing if I drop it?<br/>

That&#39;s a question that needs to be asked before giving something up.<br/>
I stopped taking an English course in college, because the professor <br/>
was an a**hole.  I stopped taking guitar lessons when I realized I <br/>
really didn&#39;t have the time to commit, wiht two small children at <br/>
home.<br/>
My kids have stopped things here and there.  But they have joined <br/>
things where quitting would have put others out, and without me <br/>
forcing them, they stuck it out as a matter of decency.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-681186391">It was a liberating experience for me, in my late teens or early twenties, to decide that I did not have to finish reading a book.  By that time, I had tried about five times, without success, to finish &quot;It&quot; by Stephen King.<br/>

It was also liberating to determine that it was not only &quot;okay&quot; to write in books but that it also made them more valuable to me later on.<br/>

benign.  Kids need a lot of chances to try things out with little or no <br/>
commitment.  They also need a lot of chances to make and keep or not keep <br/>
commitments to other people so they can experience how it feels inside to <br/>
let someone down.  (I&#39;m not talking required stuff here, just chances that <br/>
come up in daily life, like maybe agreeing to babysit and backing down at <br/>
the last minute - and then not getting called again by that family.)<br/>
