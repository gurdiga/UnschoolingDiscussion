<div id="ygrps-yiv-95842327">*PRIMAL SCREAM*!!!  MY STARS ABOVE, MELODIE!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!<br/>
*THAT* is my GREATEST FEAR, those awful RATTLERS!!!  ughhhhhhhhhhhh ... we<br/>
don&#39;t have any javelinas (those are more south from us) but we DO have all<br/>
the other things you&#39;ve listed, yep right in the suburbs, ESP<br/>
RATTLERSSSSSS!!!<br/>
<br/>
last summer our neighbor was watering his yard late in the evening and as he<br/>
went to turn the waterhose off ... he stuck his hand in the shrubs and<br/>
THOUGHT he&#39;d heard a cicada chirping noise and continued to reach in and was<br/>
bitten by a 5 ft *rattler*!!!  poor fella almost died and has HORRIBLE SCARS<br/>
from the surgery ... to this day he says he&#39;s SO GRATEFUL he was the one to<br/>
meet up w/ the rattler b/c he&#39;d asked his 6 yo son to tend to the hose but<br/>
he was busy playing; ohhhhhh, goodness, that story would&#39;ve had a different<br/>
ending!!!<br/>
<br/>
sooooooooo, ohhhhhhhh, PULEEZE BE CAREFUL Melodie!!!  ***ALWAYS*** check<br/>
that laundry basket (now Pris has the CREEPS!!!)!!!<br/>
<br/>
I fuss @ dh all the time b/c he likes to leave the garage doors open during<br/>
the summer about 6 ins b/c it helps the garage stay cooler ...  wellllllll,<br/>
I *understand* but the creepy crawlies like to stay COOL, TOO!!!<br/>
<br/>
*OHHHHHHHHHHH* NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW???* how am I supposed to go to sleep after<br/>
this post???  yep, I&#39;ll have nightmares for sure!!!<br/>
<br/>
I *love* hearing the coyotes baying @ a distance but I get nervous when they<br/>
get too close to the house ... the dogs are very good about making their<br/>
presence known but you NEVER KNOW ... ugh ...<br/>
<br/>
geckos, do ya&#39;ll have these???  you know, those *nasty* little lizard<br/>
creature~thingies???<br/>
<br/>
well, ya&#39;ll can see I&#39;m NOT a very good SCIENCE/NATURE h-s mom, that&#39;s dad&#39;s<br/>
territory!!!  I&#39;d totally freak out, esp if *it* SLITHERS and has fangs or<br/>
split tongue!!!  (eehhewweee*!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Pris ~&gt; who&#39;z going to have a sleepless night for sure!!!<br/>

&gt; We have deer, rattlesnakes (found one in the laundry basket one day---as I<br/>
&gt; reached in for the 3rd time--yikes!), tarantulas, scorpions, really cool<br/>
&gt; lizards, jackrabbits, squirrels, bull and chicken snakes, raccoons, ring<br/>
&gt; tails, bats, all kinds of birds (the scissor-tail fly catchers are really<br/>
&gt; cool, too).  We occasionally hear coyotes and have seen one mountain lion.<br/>
&gt; The dogs ran off some havelinas that were eating our pecans one day.   And<br/>
&gt; since the dogs haven&#39;t figured out how to eat the armadillos, they try to<br/>
&gt; bark them to death.  Plus the usual animals --a cat, 2 dogs, a bunny, and<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; few hens.  It is HOT But  Never Boring out at Ashling Ranch!!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Melodie =) (who checks the laundry baskets more carefully these days!) </span></blockquote></div>
