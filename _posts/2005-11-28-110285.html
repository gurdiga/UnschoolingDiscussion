<div id="ygrps-yiv-753273210">There&#39;s one essay I had in the new book that I pulled, but I&#39;ve just put it <br/>
out in public for the first time:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gifts">http://sandradodd.com/gifts</a><br/>
<br/>
It was published locally, way back when, and is called &quot;Gifts for Guys to <br/>
Buy,&quot; but it could work for women too.   It&#39;s about finding kid-gifts in hardware <br/>
stores and such places, for those who have to be there anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So while I&#39;m at it, I should remind people that it&#39;s a good time to buy <br/>
gifts, and that I have a book for sale.<br/>

<br/>
And now I must go to the post office and to thrift stores and think about <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
