 </span></blockquote>That is a huge hot point for me.<br/>
I often think that if I have lived former lives, one of them must have been <br/>
as an American Indian.....I am so drawn to their ways, their stories, it <br/>
feels like it&#39;s in my blood.<br/>
But I sure don&#39;t look the part in THIS life. :)<br/>
<br/>
We watched Geronimo a couple nights ago, pretty powerful stuff.<br/>
I cried more than once. It was all so awful.<br/>
The guy that played the part of Goyatla was perfect...he exuded strength and <br/>
a warrior like presence!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
So many were killed between the time of the first invaders and well - right up to NOW - during the Occupation - that I would be very, very surprised if there aren&#39;t many folks returning!<br/>
