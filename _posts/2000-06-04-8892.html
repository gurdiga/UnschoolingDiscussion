<p style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span
 style="FONT-FAMILY:'Comic Sans MS';FONT-SIZE:13.5pt;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">The 
American businessman was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a 
small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several 
large yellowfin tuna.</span></font></b> </p>
<p style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span
 style="FONT-FAMILY:'Comic Sans MS';FONT-SIZE:13.5pt;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">The 
American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long 
it took to catch them.&nbsp; The Mexican replied, &quot;only a little 
while.&quot;</span></font></b> </p>
<p style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span
 style="FONT-FAMILY:'Comic Sans MS';FONT-SIZE:13.5pt;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">The 
American then asked why didn&#39;t he stay out longer and catch more fish? The 
Mexican said he had enough to support his family&#39;s immediate 
needs.</span></font></b> </p>
<p style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span
 style="FONT-FAMILY:'Comic Sans MS';FONT-SIZE:13.5pt;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">The 
American then asked, but what do you do with the rest of your time? The Mexican 
fisherman said, &quot;I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta 
with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and 
play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life, 
senor.&quot;</span></font></b> </p>
<p style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span
 style="FONT-FAMILY:'Comic Sans MS';FONT-SIZE:13.5pt;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">The 
American scoffed, &quot;I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more 
time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat with the proceeds from the 
bigger boat you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of 
fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell 
directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would 
control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this 
small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually 
NYC where you will run your expanding enterprise.&quot;</span></font></b> </p>
<p style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span
 style="FONT-FAMILY:'Comic Sans MS';FONT-SIZE:13.5pt;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">The 
Mexican fisherman asked, &quot;But senor, how long will this all take?&quot; To which the 
American replied, &quot;15-20 years.&quot;</span></font></b> </p>
<p style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span
 style="FONT-FAMILY:'Comic Sans MS';FONT-SIZE:13.5pt;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">&quot;But 
what then, senor?&quot; The American laughed and said, &quot;That&#39;s the best part!&nbsp; 
When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to 
the public and become very rich, you would make millions.&quot;</span></font></b> 
</p>
<p style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span
 style="FONT-FAMILY:'Comic Sans MS';FONT-SIZE:13.5pt;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;">&quot;Millions, 
senor? Then what?&quot;&nbsp; The American said, &quot;Then you would retire. Move to a 
small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play 
with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the 
evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your 
amigos.&quot;</span></font></b> </p>
