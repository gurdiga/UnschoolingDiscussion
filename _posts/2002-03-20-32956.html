<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487809696">The paragraph prior to the one you quoted from Nancy is interesting as it<br/>
applies to defining unschooling and the oft stated &quot;unschooling will work<br/>
for all children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It bothers me a bit that unschooling is perceived as &quot;new age.&quot; Labels<br/>
exist<br/>
to stop discussion. Give it a name, put it in a category, and you&#39;ve<br/>
captured it and made yourself safe from it. Label a person, and you have a<br/>
pretty good idea of what they are; you can feel safe either embracing them,<br/>
or excluding them, depending on what you label yourself. Call unschooling<br/>
&quot;new age,&quot; and you might dismiss it from the possibilities before you, just<br/>
as another person might label structured homeschooling &quot;conservative<br/>
Christian,&quot; and thus overlook what could be the ideal learning environment<br/>
for *their* child.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Only to people who don&#39;t enjoy a good heated discussion ;-) If a word<br/>
&gt; conjures up one image for one person and another image to another and they<br/>
&gt; each assume they both have the same image and don&#39;t care about clarifying<br/>
&gt; then language loses a lot of it&#39;s usefulness. Unschooling doesn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; conjure up the same image for each of us so unparenting is even iffier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just as a test of current usage, I typed &quot;unparenting&quot; into Google. There<br/>
&gt; are 78 pages that turned up. Pretty amazing when most searches turn up at<br/>
&gt; least thousands and typically millions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Apparently it&#39;s a technical term foremost and uses up most of the 78<br/>
pages:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have you tried just unparenting the belly from the hips (the old origin)<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; then parenting the hips to the belly, making the belly bone effectively<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; &gt; new root? I just did a quick test with a skinned object and seemed to<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; &gt; ok. I could then independantly animate the front and rear quad, and<br/>
control<br/>
&gt; &gt; the overall orientation of the setup from the new &#39;belly&#39; root.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You may need to disable any IK handles though that may be along the<br/>
spine<br/>
&gt; &gt; though and make sure your model is at the bind pose when you do it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I *think* they&#39;re talking about computer animation though I&#39;m not entirely<br/>
&gt; sure they&#39;re speaking English ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (If anyone wants to check out the other fascinatingly baffling posts<br/>
they&#39;re<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; And used in programming:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; gtk/gtklist.c (gtk_list_clear_items): Clear<br/>
&gt; &gt; list-&gt;undo/list_focus_child after unparenting<br/>
&gt; &gt; child, since unparenting the child can result<br/>
&gt; &gt; in list-&gt;last_focus_child being set.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They both seem to suggest severing a dependent relationship.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The first use of unparenting in a family context is from a page on a<br/>
&gt; homeschooling conference that&#39;s gone but tantalizingly said:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ... children time and space to explore their interests. Why unschooling<br/>
does<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; mean unparenting. This workshop is primarily for people new to<br/>
unschooling ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The next one is an essay from Unschooling.com :-) written by Nancy Wooton<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; 2/24/99. (Are you here Nancy?) She&#39;s a bit of a ringer (who came up<br/>
&gt; legitimately! :-) since she&#39;s an ex-AOLer who would have been used to<br/>
seeing<br/>
&gt; unparenting used to mean not parenting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/library/essays/essay09.shtml">http://www.unschooling.com/library/essays/essay09.shtml</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unschooling scares people, because there are no guarantees. What they<br/>
fail to<br/>
&gt; &gt; realize is, public school, private school, or school-at-home offer no<br/>
&gt; &gt; guarantees, either. What unschooling is about is *freedom.* How it<br/>
appears in<br/>
&gt; &gt; different homes is as individual as the child himself. It does not mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;unparenting,&quot; though a wide range of parenting philosophies are<br/>
practiced<br/>
&gt; &gt; (most unschoolers are pretty relaxed, though, since you aren&#39;t trying to<br/>
force<br/>
&gt; &gt; the kids to do things all day long). The basic tenet is not new age;<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;what is best for this individual person, my child?&quot; In some cases,<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling parents will find their child desires a structured<br/>
curriculum, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they provide it. The difference is in WHO is asking for the curriculum,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; who is responsible for doing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then, after many animation references, a frustratingly unlinked (or<br/>
perhaps<br/>
&gt; unparented?) link to an essay entitled &quot;Unschooling or Unparenting?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And another missing page that starts: &quot;... My response to that is to<br/>
remind<br/>
&gt; them that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean &quot;unparenting&quot;. My kids have plenty of<br/>
&gt; responsibilities and structure in their lives. It&#39;s ...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally an independent, relevent use which ironically ties into the<br/>
feminism<br/>
&gt; discussion :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; (waaaaay down at the bottom)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In the end, the values of feminism and individualism are good. The<br/>
problem is<br/>
&gt; &gt; that our time-place has not yet developed the cultural responses to<br/>
compensate<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the familial losses feminism has helped create. We have yet to solve<br/>
such<br/>
&gt; &gt; problems as homemakerless houses, unparenting parents, independencism,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; isolationism (oh yea, lots of us feel alone and depressed Â­ where have<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; &gt; grandparents gone?!). I think it is the undervaluing of the family, and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; overvaluing of the individual, that produced this mess. (We value the<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a whole very much, btw). We forget our place in life: our duty. We<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; not frogs; we are mammals: we must raise our young with precious time<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; energy if we want to make them happy and successful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And then, frustratingly, a reference that could arguably go either way<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; a Pagan homeschooling page:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My view of this is that people sort themselves out by associating with<br/>
others<br/>
&gt; &gt; based on commonalities and what meets their needs as time goes by.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Homeschooling families may find that they actually have little in common<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; each other, except for an intense interest in the well-being of their<br/>
children<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a desire to be left alone by the school district. Families who come<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; this primarily from a religious motivation may share a great deal more<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; each other; many such groups dictate a unified way of life. However, the<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; &gt; secular homeschoolers are indeed a diverse lot, particularly the adults.<br/>
They<br/>
&gt; &gt; include rich and poor, mainstream and alternative lifestyles, families<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; professional degrees and those with high school diplomas, urban,<br/>
suburban and<br/>
&gt; &gt; rural, liberal and conservative, young and middle-aged, new and old<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschoolers, etc. Even with regard to child-rearing, homeschoolers<br/>
include<br/>
&gt; &gt; all philosophies from what I call unparenting to rigid behavior<br/>
management. Is<br/>
&gt; &gt; there any reason to think all these folks are likely to be friends?<br/>
About the<br/>
&gt; &gt; only way to bring them all together would be in defense of homeschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; itself, if the legislature were proposing some drastic reduction of our<br/>
&gt; &gt; rights. Even then, each part of the homeschooling &quot;community&quot; would have<br/>
its<br/>
&gt; &gt; own critique and analysis of the proposal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And another vote for unparenting being a pejorative term:<br/>

&gt; &gt; I read a post on the internet later that evening that really hit home as<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; what was missing in our unschooling efforts, other than compliance :)<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; &gt; lady that posted said she felt that unschoolers actually have more<br/>
structure<br/>
&gt; &gt; than other homeschoolers - only internal not external. We expect our<br/>
kids to<br/>
&gt; &gt; learn to care for themselves. She said &quot;that being responsible for your<br/>
&gt; &gt; actions and taking care of what God gives you is completely biblical.<br/>
She<br/>
&gt; &gt; also said that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean unparenting&quot;.<br/>
