&lt;&lt;I love and want to read all of your experience and your <br/>
opinions.  I was thinking of putting this group on daily digest.  My <br/>
question is what works for you?  Got any tricks on how to keep up.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree; this list has a lot of mail!  I think that&#39;s what is so good about <br/>
it.  I&#39;ve only been on a short time, and I already feel like I know people <br/>
here.  I love all the discussion!  <br/>
<br/>
But if I don&#39;t read any mail for a day or especially for 2, I feel like I&#39;m <br/>
behind.  I try to check my mail for just a few minutes 2 or 3x a day.  This <br/>
isn&#39;t always easy with 5 children who also want to use the internet frequently!  <br/>
We are looking at our budget with a goal of cable internet access by Spring <br/>
which should speed things up a bit and allow us to stay on all the time.  (We <br/>
have certain times of day now that we have agreed not to use the internet so <br/>
family and friends can call us.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think receiving email in digest really helps.  Then you have so much <br/>
to read at once!  I would feel that was overwhelming, and the perfectionist <br/>
part of me would probably want to read everything right away.  Sometimes I <br/>
delete items in threads that aren&#39;t of particular interest to me.  Sometimes I just <br/>
skim things if I&#39;m in a hurry.  I also respond to fewer things if I&#39;m short <br/>
on time or if it&#39;s late.  I find that threads have a way of coming back, and if <br/>
there&#39;s something I really want to say, I can always say it later!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064046047">I&#39;ve long preferred non-fiction to fiction.   When people see my non-fiction <br/>
collection some of them say &quot;Have you READ all those books!?&quot;   No, I haven&#39;t <br/>
read every word in every one.  Some I have twice.  Some I never intended to.  <br/>
But I know generally what&#39;s in there.<br/>
<br/>
And so I see homeschooling info online as not just a non-fiction book but as <br/>
a river of information that&#39;s not going to stop flowing anytime soon.   Go <br/>
once in a while and take a dipper or a bucket or dangle your feet, but don&#39;t feel <br/>
like you failed because you couldn&#39;t save the whole river to examine it <br/>
carefully.  There will be more flowing tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
And if you like best parts, there are still pools on info online too.   If <br/>
you just go to google.com and put in &quot;unschooling&quot; and whatever you&#39;re wondering <br/>
about, you&#39;ll find things to read.<br/>
<br/>
If not, try &quot;homeschooling&quot; and your other topic, but that could net you a <br/>
bunch of advertisements for things to buy about it.  Still, with google, it&#39;s <br/>
easy to skim for something that looks good.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s how I use my non-fiction books, is knowing generally what&#39;s <br/>
available in there, bookmarking my favorite parts, and learning how to use the index.<br/>
