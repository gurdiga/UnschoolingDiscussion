 </span></blockquote>      Not parenting at all would have been even tidier though -- did you <br/>
think of that before having children?<br/>
<br/>
       I ask sincerely, because I actually DID think of that, and was an <br/>
avowed non-parent all through my 20s for such reasons. <br/>
<br/>
       There was a book out then called The Baby Trap, by Ellen Peck. It&#39;s <br/>
both embarassing and amusing to me now to recall how much that book influenced <br/>
me at the time. The book said I deserved a lifestyle that wasn&#39;t &quot;childless&quot; <br/>
but child-FREE, and that sounded pretty good to me. I had a career and money, my <br/>
own place, my own car, and complete control over how their daily use and <br/>
maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
       I particularly remember the book&#39;s interview with a young mom of one <br/>
baby. The author presented her as having gone from being a sexy, bright, <br/>
carefree wife and equal partner living an adult lifestyle with brunch and ski <br/>
vacations, to this hysterical shrew stuck at home with spit-up on her clothes and <br/>
baby stuff all over the house. Hubby arrives home one night with a single friend <br/>
and the friend can&#39;t even sit down because there are unfolded diapers <br/>
everywhere. The husband sheepishly apologizes for the mess and the wife loses her <br/>
mind and begins shrieking how dare he apologize for his BABY??<br/>
<br/>
       (Like I said, it made quite an impression on me then. This is part of <br/>
why I&#39;m certain that I&#39;m a very different parent now from the one I would have <br/>
been in my 20s.)<br/>
<br/>
       This isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t try to prevent car messes, of course. My <br/>
younger child had terrible motion sickness and threw up all the time in the car, <br/>
even on short jaunts. Probably because Florida is so hot? But we drive all the <br/>
time, to take Dd to dance and the theatre, to the grocery store, et cetera, <br/>
and so I needed a solution beyond rules. For me, it was Dum-Dum lollipops. I <br/>
keep a bag of them in my car and for about three years he sucked on a series of <br/>
lollipops everywhere he went. Still does when the car is stuffy or the trip is <br/>
longer.<br/>
<br/>
       Yes, this meant sticky sticks and wrappers to be disposed of, and my <br/>
car is still usually a mess. <br/>
<br/>
       But it smells fruity instead of sour, and I don&#39;t often have to scrub <br/>
the upholstery, and I never have that desperate feeling in traffic anymore <br/>
that I can&#39;t stop to help him until I find an empty parking lot. <br/>
<br/>
       It&#39;s an acceptable and even cheerful kind of compromise for me now, <br/>
but it wouldn&#39;t have been for that woman I used to be with my sporty little car <br/>
in the 70s. That woman would read this and think I was the one who had gone <br/>
insane. &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>
