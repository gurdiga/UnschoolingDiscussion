<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646337034">I have tried to let go of the whole bedtime thing.  DD (8) tends to go to bed now after I have.  I have traditionally used the evening time to get done all the mundane but important things that I try to avoid when I&#39;m with dd so that I can focus my attention and time on her.  i.e. refilling Rx, sending out bill payments, writing letters/emails, organizing paperwork and medical stuff, etc...  I also use the time for school work (i&#39;m taking online courses).  I know I can drop these.  Other than the fact that when done with school I can earn more money (which is attractive because I am a single mom), I realize it&#39;s not an ultimate priority.  At the same time, it takes about 1 hour a night that I would otherwise devote to television or reading for pleasure.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I find my daughter tends to &quot;bug&quot; me 50 times over.  She wants the computer, she wants me to make her something to eat, she wants me to come talk to her while she&#39;s on the toilet, she wants to know exactly how far away her birthday is, and so on...  I feel like I sit down, then I jump up, then I sit down, then I jump up, or I&#39;m the evil mom saying &quot;make yourself a sandwich or heat up something&quot;, or &quot;it&#39;s my turn for the computer&quot;, or &quot;bathroom time should be private time/PUHLEASE just do your thing and get it over&quot; etc...  How do you do it?  I do as much school/email stuff as possible while I&#39;m at lunch or on break at work.  I am away from the house for 10 hours a day for work/travel time.  When I get home, I must make dinner.  Sometimes that&#39;s something simple like sandwiches.  Otherwise, it takes time to prepare.  Eating out is not financially feasible on a daily or even weekly basis.  Additionally, since I do work I do need to do laundry sometimes, and because I don&#39;t like<br/>
 maggots I clean the plates and take out garbage.  I don&#39;t always wash the dishes, but if I don&#39;t do it right away then it&#39;s twice as long next time.  I try to use paper as much as possible but that feels like throwing away money.  Also, since i&#39;m so tight on time I dont&#39; shop that often and run out sometimes - or plain forget to get new when I do go shopping.  How do you do it?<br/>

<br/>
Well here&#39;s your answer as to why your dd is bugging you so much. She is<br/>
trying to cram the same hours of your attention [that those of us who don&#39;t<br/>
need to do outside work are so fortunately able to give to our kids all day]<br/>
into the few short hours between this other stuff you are doing and your<br/>
need to get to bed. I don&#39;t pretend to have a solution, but it sure is<br/>
understandable seen in that light.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn(4.75) will say anything, and do any kind of disruptive or annoying<br/>
behavior directed at her Dad, to get his attention when he has been at work<br/>
all the long filmmakers&#39; day - a fairly new phenomenon for her to deal with,<br/>
as he is just recently off disability. He was baffled. It was obvious to me.<br/>
They got together and talked it over, and he made a commitment to her that<br/>
they would spend time playing together when he got home, instead of him<br/>
immediately getting onto his computer, or phoning his producer buddy to talk<br/>
the day over at length. <br/>
<br/>
He has also agreed to make us the priority on the weekend for as long as<br/>
this show lasts, instead of helping his buddies do some other thing as had<br/>
been his habit while not working during the week. Having Jayn as a priority<br/>
in his head doesn&#39;t mean as much to her as him taking action to make her his<br/>
priority.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; When I get home, I must make dinner.  Sometimes that&#39;s something simple<br/>
like sandwiches.  Otherwise, it takes time to prepare.  Eating out is not<br/>
financially feasible on a daily or even weekly basis.  Additionally, since I<br/>
do work I do need to do laundry sometimes, and because I don&#39;t like<br/>
 maggots I clean the plates and take out garbage.  I don&#39;t always wash the<br/>
dishes, but if I don&#39;t do it right away then it&#39;s twice as long next time.<br/>
I try to use paper as much as possible but that feels like throwing away<br/>
money.  Also, since i&#39;m so tight on time I dont&#39; shop that often and run out<br/>
sometimes - or plain forget to get new when I do go shopping.  How do you do<br/>
it?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have some practical ideas, that may be useful or not to you. I won&#39;t be<br/>
offended if you reject all of them. However the spiritual advice I have is<br/>
to return your daughter to the forefront of your priorities in the brief<br/>
time you have to spend with her in the evenings.<br/>
<br/>
Flylady has a whole focus on working mothers - slightly different routines<br/>
etc. <br/>
<br/>
Fill the sink with hot, sudsy water before you start to cook dinner.<br/>
Everything goes into it at once. Washing up is faster.<br/>
<br/>
Put the garbage bag by your front door night before, and carry it down with<br/>
you in the morning. A smaller bin is actually easier to empty more often<br/>
than a larger one.<br/>
<br/>
I clean only one wall of the shower recess at a time when I take a shower -<br/>
unless Jayn gets to it first in a cleaning game.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have an internet grocer that will make deliveries in your area? This<br/>
was the most fantastic saving of my time and energy while pregnant - then<br/>
that particular service collapsed unfortunately. It did not cost<br/>
significantly more, especially once you factor in gas.<br/>
<br/>
Someone once posted a website that was about daily menus and shopping lists<br/>
for them - it removed the how to decide/dither factor from preparing meals. <br/>
<br/>
I buy paper goods in bulk from a warehouse store - one of Jayn&#39;s favorite<br/>
outings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m often tired and lazy-feeling at night. If I prepare the dinner in the<br/>
morning when I have energy - like put the veges into the steamer basket in<br/>
the fridge, fill the pot with water as needed, and rub the chicken with<br/>
spices - or even just plan it onto paper (ie the menu) - I get a much better<br/>
meal made in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
When you can afford it, I urge you to get a second computer, especially a<br/>
laptop. You may then be able to take some of your work or reading to where<br/>
your dd is, and you remove the competition for the use of the computer.<br/>
Nothing like sitting side by side playing computer games together.<br/>
<br/>
Ah the laundry. What I have to do is have a laundry day - or I am washing<br/>
all week long. The only reason that is a problem is because I have to haul<br/>
the stuff downstairs to the apartment complex laundry room, pay a heap of<br/>
quarters, and share the time with the other tenants. Sometimes we go to the<br/>
local Laundromat for a change - Jayn enjoys going to get a donut at the same<br/>
time. If I had a washer/dryer combo in my apartment (my big wish for my<br/>
future house) I would do one small load a day. In your case (assuming you<br/>
have this in your apt) I would suggest turning on the dryer last thing<br/>
before you head out the door, having as much non-iron knitwear as possible,<br/>
and hanging blouses to dry to reduce ironing. One day your dd will surprise<br/>
you by folding the laundry for you. Eventually she will be doing her own<br/>
laundry.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck finding a balance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196623802">&lt;warning, tongue in cheek alert...&gt;<br/>
Borrow 3 or 4 more kids of various ages for a month. Then go back to having one. You will be amazed at how much time you have ;-)<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;tongue back out of cheek&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I include my in activitues like doing the dishes or cleaning. They either help or find something to do instantly. At 8 I would say your daughter was old enough to understand about &#39;me&#39; time. If she&#39;s bugging you all the time its possible that you are giving her part-time harried attention all the time. Sit down with her and explain you&#39;ll do something for an hour where she has your whole attention then you want to do some chores. She can either help or read or something. Then more &#39;her&#39; time. Then &#39;you&#39; time. Because she would have had some undivided attention then she will feel more content and less bugging.<br/>
It takes a while to change this but I do it with 4 kids. They all get undivided attention to do something special for them (sort off, as I have to hold the baby all day) but it does stop that all day fight for attention cos they know that they &#39;special&#39; project will get done without siblings joining in.<br/>
Anyway, thats what worked for me. There are still days when I&#39;m washing the dishes at 11pm and gritting my teeth or I forget to put he garbage out and it only gets collected once a fortnight or we&#39;re at the hospital all day with the baby so everybody is whining and competeing for mummy-time.<br/>
But on the whole the children &#39;join in&#39; We talk when we walk to the shops -an every day chore. Or we chat on the bus on the way to the hospital - also every day at the moment. They also enjoy playing Runescape online so will play for hours which is a great time for me to get the chores done and have a cup of tea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370673576">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Anyway, I find my daughter tends to &quot;bug&quot; me 50 times over.  She wants<br/>
the computer, she wants me to make her something to eat, she wants me to<br/>
come talk to her while she&#39;s on the toilet, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It may help to consider that she doesn&#39;t mean to &quot;bug&quot; you, she is trying to<br/>
love you, albeit in a rather &quot;annoying&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
She thinks you&#39;re awesome and wants to spend time with you.  You need to get<br/>
some stuff done and then have some down time.  Here is what I would suggest.<br/>
<br/>
Invite her to help you.....really help you.  If you are paying bills,<br/>
explain to her what you are doing as you go along, let her do the math part<br/>
on the calculator, let her stuff the envelope, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Then make her a yummy snack, a library book or a video and let her know that<br/>
you are needing to recharge and that you will be available in 20 minutes.<br/>
You might think about asking her to get the next project organized that you<br/>
can do together when you are finished relaxing.  She is going to interrupt<br/>
several times.  Be nice, gentle but let her know you will be out soon.  Then<br/>
be sure to be right there physically and emotionally as soon as the time is<br/>
up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011048165">I agree with Julie. Most of the time, when DS (6 yrs old) <br/>
gets &quot;pestery&quot; (is that a word? lol) it&#39;s because he needs focused <br/>
attention and isn&#39;t getting it - even if it seems like I&#39;m there but <br/>
I&#39;m mentally elsewhere. I have worked from home on occasion (and <br/>
hope to make several days per week at home the norm) and DH worked <br/>
from home (part time) for a few years. We found that even 15 minutes <br/>
of focused being there time WHEN DS wanted it alleviated hours of <br/>
pestering and &quot;Are you done yet?!&quot; frustration. We also include DS <br/>
in the laundry, the dishes, the bill paying, the shopping, etc. as <br/>
much as he chooses to be involved. Laundry has always been a once a <br/>
week thing - back when DS was little and we lived in a bitty campus <br/>
apartment, after we moved and could use MIL&#39;s washer and dryer <br/>
(which meant a 30 minute drive each way), and now when we have a <br/>
house with a washer and dryer right there in the basement. That&#39;s <br/>
the way DH prefers it (he&#39;s the at home parent) so that&#39;s how it <br/>
goes. And, DS has his own computer - purchased very inexpensively at <br/>
a used/refurbished computer place but with enough power to go online <br/>
to play and such. He sits with me sometimes when I&#39;m doing bills and <br/>
does his own &quot;bills&quot; - he&#39;ll draw or scribble or write on small bits <br/>
of paper (3x5 size) and use old envelopes and those freebie address <br/>
labels and assorted stickers. He keeps me company while I talk about <br/>
what bills I&#39;m paying and all. We also used a grocery delivery <br/>
service for a while when DH was working because it was taking too <br/>
much of our time away to manage the drive to the store, shopping, <br/>
driving back, putting it away, etc. By timing the delivery to a time <br/>
when DH was home anyhow (like on laundry day) both things could get <br/>
accomplished without eating up more of the day. Also, things like <br/>
developing menus and keeping staples on hand helped with dinner - DH <br/>
and I can tag-team dinner if we both know what is happening.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the original post, what struck me right off is being away <br/>
10 hours per day and then get home and &quot;must&quot; make dinner because <br/>
when I thought about it, I&#39;m gone 10 hrs per day too (didn&#39;t realize <br/>
it was that many hours because I&#39;m so close to home). Something that <br/>
really helps is that dinner can wait for 15 or 20 minutes while DS <br/>
and I reconnect - whether I sit and watch part of whatever he&#39;s <br/>
watching or we sit and look at a book or something together or draw <br/>
on the table (yes, -on- we have big rolls of brown paper we use as a <br/>
table covering and keep containers of markers, pens, and crayons <br/>
where most people have the lazy susan with salt and pepper). I also <br/>
make sure I am available to talk to him once or twice during the <br/>
day - I call home or he calls me here at work and we chat.  We even <br/>
have what might seem a silly bit: one day when he was particularly <br/>
sad about me leaving for work, I told him about the &quot;purple part&quot; <br/>
that grows in every mommy&#39;s brain when they have a baby. That part <br/>
(and I pointed to a specific part of my head) spends the whole day, <br/>
no matter what, just thinking on that baby. He has decided he has a <br/>
purple part too. So I kiss his purple part (his moves around his <br/>
head sometimes) and he kisses mine (it&#39;s roughly behind my right <br/>
ear) and I give an extra hug and kiss to a small purple teddy bear <br/>
who holds onto it for him in case he needs and extra hug and kiss <br/>
during the day. Simple enough routine, takes all of 5 minutes maybe <br/>
IF he&#39;s awake before I leave. If he&#39;s asleep I write a note for him <br/>
by his seat at the table. When he was a pre-reader, I wrote the same <br/>
thing over and over. Those were the first words he could recognize <br/>
on sight in other contexts. It&#39;s all about developing the routines <br/>
and habits that promote staying connected because that&#39;s what all <br/>
the pestering is about to start with - connecting.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051282217">&lt;&lt; I have tried to let go of the whole bedtime thing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bedtime is a good thing, if it&#39;s time to go to bed because the house has <br/>
gotten quiet and the children are sleepy.    <br/>
<br/>
Arbitrary bedtime by the clock might be a thing to reconsider, but not to let <br/>
go of entirely all at once.   <br/>
<br/>
Gradually saying &quot;yes&quot; more and &quot;okay&quot; more, and being willing to do things <br/>
in new and different and more peaceful ways is healing.   Getting rid of whole <br/>
things can be disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyway, I find my daughter tends to &quot;bug&quot; me 50 times over.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the individual moments instead of the overall, you can sort <br/>
out the threads of what she needs and what she wants, and if you&#39;re willing to <br/>
rearrange your life so that different priorities and needs are foremost, it <br/>
will dissolve itself into the new fabric, I think.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel like I sit down, then I jump up, then I sit down, then I jump up, <br/>
or I&#39;m the evil mom saying &quot;make yourself a sandwich or heat up something&quot;, or <br/>
&quot;it&#39;s my turn for the computer&quot;, or &quot;bathroom time should be private <br/>
time/PUHLEASE just do your thing and get it over&quot; etc...  How do you do it? -=-<br/>
<br/>
By making sandwiches, letting them use the computer until they&#39;re through and <br/>
letting them talk to me while I&#39;m on the pot if they want to.   But we <br/>
started that from the beginning, and didn&#39;t jump to it all at once.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When I get home, I must make dinner.  Sometimes that&#39;s something simple <br/>
like sandwiches.  Otherwise, it takes time to prepare. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you want us to help you brainstorm options?  Crockpot from the morning?  <br/>
Take something out of the freezer you made twice as much of another day?<br/>
<br/>
-=-and because I don&#39;t like<br/>
 maggots I clean the plates and take out garbage. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This kind of visualizing and justification is harsh on your own soul.  Who <br/>
told you you&#39;ll get maggots if you don&#39;t clean the plates and take out the <br/>
garbage?  Do you even have flies?  (In the Middle Ages, there was a belief that <br/>
maggots appeared on their own somehow because of the sun, but really--flies have <br/>
to lay eggs, and it takes a while for them to develop into maggots.  More than <br/>
a week, I think.)  If you take the trash out every few days and you swat the <br/>
flies, you won&#39;t have maggots.  And maggots only grow on rotting meat and <br/>
such, not on plastic bags and paper.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t have boogy-men in your life that aren&#39;t realistic.  Don&#39;t act in <br/>
response to boogy-men (or boogy-maggots).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, since i&#39;m so tight on time I dont&#39; shop that often and run out <br/>
sometimes - or plain forget to get new when I do go shopping.  How do you do it?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Breathing to calm myself always helps.   <br/>
Keeping lists (magnet to the fridge) and never going to the store without the <br/>
list helps.<br/>
Putting things on the list before I run out helps.  If I know when I get to <br/>
the store that we don&#39;t REALLY need it yet (butter is on my list, but we have a <br/>
pound still), I&#39;ll put it back on the new list when I get back, having chosen <br/>
to wait another time.<br/>

Ooooooooo, the lake scene :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thats what I miss about America. A dryer. And a dishwasher. We cant afford either on a Brit salary and there aren&#39;t places in the kitchen to put them if we could. I loved my dishwasher in the US :-(<br/>

Waaaah.<br/>

 I do the same thing,  just throw it all in a clump on the couch and fold and fold and fold.  For a long time it was the LOTR Extended versions.   I now have to go and rent Pride and Prejudice, I haven&#39;t seen that in a long time.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also do this with my son when he&#39;s playing video games.  I can be with him, talk with him and at the same time accomplish the mundane task of folding clothes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oh,  I thought of you two today, Shyley and Sandra,  I was at a Claire&#39;s boutique where I saw wristbands that had &quot; I love Colin&quot; stitched on them.    I wondered which Colin it was, but thought you guys would like them. &lt;g&gt;  I wanted the Mrs. Bloom handbag.   I&#39;m sooo adolescent.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
