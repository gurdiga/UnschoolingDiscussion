I couldn&#39;t help notice you comment in your into. that your son&#39;s Clonlara<br/>
diploma was not valid in the eyes of the Army. I thought that the whole idea<br/>
of using an umbrella school was for times like that. Was that just an Army<br/>
thing? Do you know of anyone else having difficulty with colleges, other<br/>
branches of the armed services, etc. It seems scary to me that one could<br/>
spend money for curriculums, time corresponding, earn a diploma, and still<br/>
have a hard time. I&#39;d like your input bc we were thinking of using Oak<br/>
Meadow next year. BTW welcome to the list.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi, I&#39;m new to this list so thought I would lurk for a while, but found<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; note by Susan in my first digest, and couldn&#39;t resist commenting :)  Intro<br/>
&gt; first, though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been unschooling 10 years this month; took my older two kids out of<br/>
&gt; school 2/3 of the way through 5th grade when the older was suicidally<br/>
&gt; depressed due to school experiences and the younger, though he had skipped<br/>
&gt; two years of school, was still grossly unchallenged.  I knew no other<br/>
hsers<br/>
&gt; but one family who did school at home, which I didn&#39;t feel would work in<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; situation, but figured a tiny bit of structure would be needed.  However,<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; oldest son&#39;s intense need to deschool led directly to unschooling, and we<br/>
&gt; never looked back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The boys are now very nearly 21 (2 weeks) and 18.  The elder is in the<br/>
Army,<br/>
&gt; has been since before he turned 18, and is doing very well.  Getting him<br/>
in<br/>
.the Army was a challenge as our Clonlara diploma was not recognized as<br/>
&gt; valid.  But we got past that hurdle, then 6 weeks after Chris joined, my<br/>
dh<br/>
&gt; retired from the Army, and we left TX to move onto our land in MI, where<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; now have a small farm.  The younger son left home a few weeks after his<br/>
18th<br/>
&gt; birthday to move *back* to TX :) where he&#39;s employed by an Internet<br/>
ecommerce<br/>
&gt; company, and making a very nice salary along with 80 hour workweeks.<br/>
&gt; Personally, I hope he quits and finds something less stressful, but that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what he wants for now :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My youngest child is a girl, 8 going on 18, who is exceptionally sensitive<br/>
&gt; and strongwilled, so life is never dull.  At the moment she&#39;s minding the<br/>
&gt; batch of 28 baby chicks we picked up this morning.  We still unschool, in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; manner I&#39;ve been told is nowadays called &#39;radical unschooling&#39;, meaning,<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; told, folks who don&#39;t use unit studies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now for the comment.  Susan wrote:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; imo the fact that you wanted to learn piano and the opportunity to<br/>
acquire<br/>
&gt; this skill was not afforded to you would say to me that you were not<br/>
&gt; unschooled because your parents did not respect your desires and did not<br/>
&gt; follow your lead.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I strongly disagree with this :)  Unschooling, IMO, is indeed about<br/>
following<br/>
&gt; the child&#39;s lead--I like to refer to it as child-led learning.  However,<br/>
&gt; parents are not obligated to allow the child to lead anywhere she wants!<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think you&#39;d let your child lead you to give her lessons in arson, if<br/>
&gt; she were interested in burning things, would you? :)  There are always<br/>
limits<br/>
&gt; in the real world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If my daughter had her way, we&#39;d provide gymnastics, swimming, horseback<br/>
&gt; riding, piano lessons, and a host of other enriching activities.  I would<br/>
&gt; love to give her ample opportunity for each and every one of these<br/>
&gt; activities, but there&#39;s a few problems.  One, there&#39;s simply not enough<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; to do all these things; Two, we don&#39;t have the money; and Three, she is<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; real serious about any of the ones she&#39;s tried so far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where I can work out lessons that I feel are of the quality that provides<br/>
&gt; learning with respect, for a reasonable amount of money or labor (I have<br/>
&gt; bartered my labor for her lessons with friends), I give my daughter<br/>
chances<br/>
&gt; to try different activities.  But when she doesn&#39;t follow through on her<br/>
end<br/>
&gt; of the deal--for example, wearing the safety equipment needed, or placing<br/>
her<br/>
&gt; hands on the keys like her teachers says--then it&#39;s time to rethink the<br/>
&gt; lessons.  Periodically we&#39;ll give her a new chance to try if she&#39;s still<br/>
&gt; interested, and if she&#39;s willing to be fully cooperative with the<br/>
&gt; restrictions inherent in the situation, then lessons will continue as long<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; she is cooperative and we can work out any other problems.  But I&#39;m under<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; obligation to provide opportunities to someone who won&#39;t appreciate and<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; the most of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If my child had a burning *need* to do something--for example, a child who<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; a serious competitive swimmer, or who finds that music, or animals, or<br/>
&gt; whatever, is her life, then I would move heaven and earth to provide that<br/>
&gt; opportunity.  But most kids are just experimenting, which is fine, if done<br/>
&gt; with the understanding that it not take over the family&#39;s time and income.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, so much for my plan to lurk :)<br/>

&lt;&lt; unschooling is always in context of real life and family - one member&#39;s<br/>
 desires should never always usurp another rights and desires.  yes we must<br/>
 juggle the desires of all the members of the family (and for some people the<br/>
 state and extended family as well) though this is challenging at times it&#39;s <br/>
also<br/>
 beautiful when it&#39;s working. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Susan,<br/>
Nicely put!  I enjoyed your whole response but this part particularly rang <br/>
true, as one of my sons tends to &quot;take over&quot; the whole family.  It is a <br/>
delicate balance.<br/>
