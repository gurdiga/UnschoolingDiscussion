Just let me know when you are coming.<br/>
My mom has a summer apt on 11th street that I have access to all <br/>
winter long.  She doesn&#39;t come up til May, so it&#39;s empty.  We just <br/>
had the electric and water turned on last week so my brother and <br/>
family  could stay there over Easter.  So there will be a bathroom <br/>
and refrigerator AND shower for anyone that needs it.<br/>
check the weather and make the plans!<br/>
