<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954374923">&lt;&lt; I do realize that and that&#39;s probably a large part of it.  My 10 yos <br/>
thinks <br/>
&quot;If those kids don&#39;t have to do schoolwork, they must not learn anything!  I <br/>
don&#39;t want to not learn anything.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s rough when it was the parent who instilled the fear of unschooling.  <br/>
That&#39;s an additional problem with some families, when the mom told them the <br/>
reason they HAD to do their schoolwork at the kitchen table was because <br/>
otherwise they would never learn, never be able to get a job--and then when <br/>
mom changes her mind, it&#39;s easier for her to see a difference than for her to <br/>
go back to the kids and try to undo what she had said before.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think the easiest way must be to say &quot;I thought that was true, <br/>
but I don&#39;t think so now.  Let&#39;s try something else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have a neighbor who&#39;s about six, and yesterday she and Holly played a <br/>
while.  As before, she has forgotten that Holly is homeschooled.  Holly said <br/>
the conversation was like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We should play again tomorrow after school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t go to school.  But when you get home?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.  I&#39;ve told you before, remember?  I&#39;m homeschooled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t want to go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My mom doesn&#39;t want me to go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She doesn&#39;t want you to learn?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(So of course between me and Holly it was &quot;What?  You tell people you wanted <br/>
to go but I wouldn&#39;t let you?&quot; ; &quot;But I DID want to go when I was little&quot; ; <br/>
&quot;But you wante dto go to play with Kellee and she wasn&#39;t in your grade&quot;; &quot;I <br/>
KNOW!...&quot;  and back and forth &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t villianized schools and teachers at all to the kids, because <br/>
similarly, if they trust me and I tell them school is an unbearably horrible <br/>
place, what if my husband and I die and they have to go?    I liked school.  <br/>
(But I see that in Germany, someone has gone into his old school and killed <br/>
18 people...  and that unbearable horror was not a part of my schooldays.)<br/>
