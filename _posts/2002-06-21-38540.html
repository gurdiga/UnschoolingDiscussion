<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959089489">&lt;&lt;A question? Any one have a remedy for<br/>
constipation and irregularity for our 3 yr. old <br/>
daughter?  She eats like a bird too.  We&#39;ve tried<br/>
pears; she gets burned out on them.  Applesauce<br/>
seems to constipate her.. odd huh?  Any ideas<br/>
would be appreciated. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not strange at all that applesauce might add<br/>
tothe problem.  When kids have diarrhea, the ABC<br/>
diet is often recommended--applesauce, bananas<br/>
and cereal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend trying lots of fresh fruits and<br/>
veggies, and increasing fluids.  Try juice<br/>
popsicles and icees if she isn&#39;t a big liquid<br/>
fan.  If buying then is a pain, make mini<br/>
popsicles in ice cube trays--probably a better<br/>
size for her anyway, and you can offer them more<br/>
frequently.  Same with the fruits and<br/>
veggies--offer small amounts often.  You&#39;d be<br/>
amazed at how much more you can get down kids<br/>
that way!&lt;G&gt;  Its like when they are<br/>
barfing--offer a teaspoon every 10-15 minutes and<br/>
you&#39;ll get a LOT down them and they often don&#39;t<br/>
lose it!&lt;G&gt;<br/>
