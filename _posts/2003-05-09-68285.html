&lt;&lt; You are now an adjective!  &lt;g&gt; Someone on my Minnesota list said  &quot;I know<br/>
<br/>
its not very Sandra Doddish&quot; .   Cool! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s funny!<br/>
<br/>
I spoke in Minneapolis once, in a church meeting room.  Susan Bundlie <br/>
arranged it, when Keith was working up there and the rest of the family had <br/>
gone to visit him.  I remember it as a kind of dreamy, overcast, still day, <br/>
and the group was very quiet, and it was one of those days that I would <br/>
remember in that &quot;Did that really happen?&quot; kind of way.  (Those days disturb <br/>
me, by the way, and I don&#39;t have so many of them, but a few.)   But a couple <br/>
of years later I got an e-mail from someone talking about how that had <br/>
changed her life, and so I thought, &quot;Oh!  I guess it DID happen!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s kind of an exaggeration on the reality of it, but there was an oddity <br/>
to the whole deal.  (I hope I&#39;m not the only one who has had that feeling <br/>
about something, or you guys will think I&#39;m crazy!)<br/>
<br/>
I liked Minnesota, but not enough to want to trade New Mexico in on it. (And <br/>
New Mexico might not even have made the down payment! It&#39;s cheaper to live <br/>
here, and I already know how.  Minnesota takes a lot of study and practice, <br/>
it seems, or you could end up freezing on the way out to your already-frozen <br/>
car.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Your hard work really does show itself.   Although you might not always know<br/>
<br/>
how far it is reaching.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  Awkward thanks.<br/>

**but there was an oddity<br/>

<br/>
Oh,  I know what you mean,  for me it comes whenever someone asks me what<br/>
curriculum we use in our homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t have a clue.      Around where I live there aren&#39;t very many<br/>
people who have even heard of unschooling.    Even the homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**It&#39;s cheaper to live<br/>
here, **<br/>
<br/>
Really?   You mean than Minneapolis or big city?   Small town Minnesota is<br/>
pretty cheap,  housing wise,  but not grocery wise.<br/>
<br/>
Hey,  if New Mexico is cheaper than Minnesota in cost of living,  I&#39;d<br/>
consider it.  I was looking into Arizona last winter.  I heard their state<br/>
is very homeschool friendly.  My dh and I every once in a while really start<br/>
to detest the cold,  and the last few winters we havn&#39;t even had very much<br/>
snow.  Which makes the cold bearable.    Is there testing in New Mexico?<br/>
That&#39;s my gripe about Minnesota right now.<br/>

Nope. None in New Mexico.  Used to be three years out of the 13, but now it&#39;s <br/>
none.</div>
