<div id="ygrps-yiv-598003376"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;But... there were no spare moments for more details!! (I could&#39;ve done with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>less car and more interpersonals, but that&#39;s just me &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem fair, somehow, to criticise it for leaving anything out - <br/>
considering that it was a long movie. But - I agree that we could have done <br/>
with a bit less of the car and a bit less of the quidditch and just spread <br/>
those minutes out - a few seconds here and a few seconds there - to <br/>
increase the interpersonal stuff. All it would take was a camera shot or <br/>
two and a few words between various characters.<br/>
<br/>
There were a few disconcerting moments, I thought:<br/>
<br/>
Ron picking up a rock and knocking Lockhart out -- seemed out of character <br/>
and weird - Lockhart was so clearly already out of it and Ron isn&#39;t the <br/>
type to just hit him on the head with a rock just because he can.<br/>
<br/>
The scene where Hermione hugged Harry and then stopped herself from hugging <br/>
Ron and just shook his hand. There was NO chemistry of a romantic sort <br/>
between Hermione and Ron up to that point and it just seemed weird there <br/>
for her to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Ginny Weasely needed to be fleshed out a bit more - it would only have <br/>
taken a couple of seconds of time to make it more clear that she had a huge <br/>
crush on Harry. Percy was a nonentity in the film, too, and yet, again, it <br/>
would only have taken a few minutes of time to build up his character a <br/>
little more.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. I sent the following to another list earlier... Peggy will not<br/>
be at all surprised that we were unimpressed by the movie, of course.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;We did warn the friends we went to this one with that we would<br/>
probably be highly critical of it...;-)<br/>
<br/>
Dar<br/>
<br/>
Richard Harris was okay, but he didn&#39;t &quot;twinkle&quot; at all, he was so<br/>
serious. A big part of Dumbledore&#39;s appeal is his twinkle, his fun,<br/>
quirky side.<br/>
 <br/>
We saw the movie the day it opened and were of course unhappy with it. It<br/>
had the same &quot;rushing from scene to scene and cramming everything in&quot;<br/>
feeling as the first one - no character development at all. A lot of the<br/>
good lines were left out, and a lot of things were changed for apparently<br/>
no reason at all. Like why couldn&#39;t the basilisk have been bright green?<br/>
The book made it quite clear that it was. And why was Aragog so small in<br/>
the memory scene - he was maybe the size of a cat, certainly not<br/>
something scary or monstrous.  Certain scenes, though, seemed way too<br/>
long, like the Quidditch match and the running from the spiders and the<br/>
fight with the basilisk (and it didn&#39;t work the way they filmed it, with<br/>
Harry grabbing the fang and running back to the book).<br/>
 <br/>
I also found Dobby and Myrtle both pretty annoying, and Lucius was a babe<br/>
but not at all like I pictured him. And no one wore robes much at all,<br/>
muggle-clothes abound everywhere. And the broomsticks looked lame, and<br/>
Fred and George get to say about 3 words each, and all the parts that<br/>
foreshadow Ginny being the one opening the chamber (her forgetting her<br/>
diary as they leave for the train, her being very upset about Mrs.<br/>
Norris, her wanting to tell Harry and Ron something, and so on) were cut.<br/>
Also, Mrs. Weasley has way too much makeup on and why wasn&#39;t she wearing<br/>
robes at home?<br/>
<br/>
 I do like the actors who play Ron and Hermione, FWIW.</div>

My kids were quite sure the book doesn&#39;t say, either.  We decided she<br/>
couldn&#39;t have been a Slytherin, since no one would bully them (!), not<br/>
likely a Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, so we put her in Hufflepuff.  Are we<br/>
betraying a school-clique mentality here, even though my kids have never<br/>
gone to school???  This is vaguely disturbing.<br/>

Myrtle. Tom is the &quot;heir of Slytherin&quot;, and the books say at one point<br/>
that all the wizards who became death eaters were Slytherin, but that&#39;s<br/>
the closest they get to giving Tom&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
Myrtle baby-talked. She didn&#39;t whine. And she really wasn&#39;t fat, she was<br/>
way too cute, IMO...<br/>
