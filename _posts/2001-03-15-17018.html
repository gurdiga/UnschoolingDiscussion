<div id="ygrps-yiv-188348050">As long as it takes! I&#39;ve only met a handful of other adoptees, and I&#39;ve<br/>
enjoyed the stories and ensuing conversations immensely! If you&#39;d prefer to<br/>
email privately, feel free - or if you&#39;d prefer to talk let me know!<br/>

&gt; What fun! and yes it does make for some interesting family tree projects!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d love to hear your reuniting story sometime if you&#39;re open to sharing it.<br/>

&gt; It will have to wait until later...taking my kids to their horse camp thing<br/>
