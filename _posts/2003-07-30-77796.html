<div id="ygrps-yiv-809825841">Hi,<br/>
  So Trevor (age 6 in September) goes for his first ever eye exam yesterday. <br/>
Most people in our family wear glasses and I&#39;ve noticed him squinting at <br/>
things lately. Sure enough, he needs glasses. I asked him if he wanted to wear <br/>
glasses like mine and he said &quot;Sure!&quot; He really enjoyed picking out his frames and <br/>
a young girl who was with us told him how much she likes her glasses and that <br/>
he&#39;ll be able to see much more clearly. He&#39;s excited. I just keep thinking <br/>
how this would be a different experience if he were going to school and showed <br/>
up in glasses one day. He doesn&#39;t know that wearing glasses might be something <br/>
kids would make fun of.<br/>

  Three of my kids wear glasses.  Luckily they were never made fun of in school for it.  My boys used to get headaches, though, actually they still do.  Then they would want to come home to lay down.  <br/>
<br/>
  Funny story about my daughter&#39;s first eye exam.  There was a bus from the Lion&#39;s Club giving free exams at a festival one day so I had my kids get their eyes tested.  My daughter was 4 at the time.  The man asked her to read the first line, she said she couldn&#39;t.  So he asked her to read the next line, she said she couldn&#39;t.  Then the third line, she couldn&#39;t.  So he got irritated at her and said, &quot;can&#39;t you just try!&quot;.  She answered, &quot;no, I can&#39;t read&quot;.  It was so funny.  I hadn&#39;t even thought about that when I put her on the list to be tested.  Obviously he didn&#39;t think about that either.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Anymore it seems like so many kids wear glasses that it&#39;s just not much of a<br/>
big deal.  Does anybody have kids who&#39;ve been made fun of for their glasses?<br/>
<br/>
Tim only wears his glasses to read (and when he forgets to take them off<br/>
after reading!), so not everyone has seen them, I suppose.  But he was just<br/>
getting into Harry Potter when he got them a year and some ago, so they&#39;re<br/>
almost round.  Maybe he doesn&#39;t get teased because his are &quot;cool&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I remember getting my glasses; I was 10 years old and in 5th grade.  I got<br/>
teased a lot, and I was sure everybody was going to tease about them, except<br/>
that the most popular boy in my class got glasses the exact same day, and<br/>
that seemed to save me from most of it.  Actually, I loved my glasses; I<br/>
never knew I was supposed to be able to read what the teacher wrote on the<br/>
chalkboard and see leaves on tall trees!  That was a funny revelation.<br/>
