<div id="ygrps-yiv-609685766">The Hacker&#39;s ISP took action against him.<br/>
They can&#39;t tell me what action was taken, but they said &quot;according to their terms and conditions&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I am assuming they dumped his account.  <br/>
<br/>
THey said the FBI can contact them and they will share information with them, and they can then share it with me.  I feel kinda silly calling the FBI though!!<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
