<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844229305">Julie,  I know what you mean.  My 14yo dd understands unschooling and <br/>
the idea that whatever she&#39;s interested in, we pursue, blah, blah and <br/>
she is a different person than her 11yo sister in that she is a great <br/>
communicator/verbal person.  When someone says something like math is <br/>
hard, she would have a great response.  Or what about college, she <br/>
will say we&#39;ve checked into it and colleges still like me even though <br/>
I&#39;m hs&#39;d.  The 11yo we pulled out because of the insecurity/phobia <br/>
the school/her peers were ingraining in her.  It was about reading <br/>
then.  Math has always been her strong suit in an abstract way, like <br/>
her daddy.  The only thing I can do is continue to reinforce our new <br/>
way of life and, with the help of family members, hope things turn <br/>
out the way we predict they will.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, would certainly be happy to hear of stories from people who <br/>
have &#39;been there, done that&#39; and how it went.</div>
