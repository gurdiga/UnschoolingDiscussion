<div id="ygrps-yiv-102861014">Ann, your younger kids might enjoy &quot;duck, duck, goose&quot;; older ones might <br/>
enjoy jumping rope with various ropes and to jumping rhymes;  also,  maybe  <br/>
they could fly kites, and hoola hoop;  one idea that could be fun, too, would <br/>
be to fill a small wading pool with  a bubble mixture, then let the kids try <br/>
blowing  or making bubbles from different household items-  like the plastic <br/>
rings that hold a 6-pack of soda together.  Another idea  would be a cake <br/>
walk, where each  player chooses a prize  ( inexpensive trinket)  when their <br/>
number is drawn.  Hope your celebration goes well!      Karen                   <br/>
                                                            ps-- the limbo <br/>
would be fun, too!</div>

 </span></blockquote>You could also have them make the jump ropes out of plastic grocerie bags,<br/>
my kids did this and loved it! they are very sturdy ropes just tear the bags<br/>
down each side so you have one long piece of plastic (handle at top handle<br/>
at bottom)   then braid three together if you need it longer just tie<br/>
another to the ends of each one and keep braiding until you get the length<br/>
you want then tie knots in the ends and you can wrap with duck tape to make<br/>
actual handles!<br/>
