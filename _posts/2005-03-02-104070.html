How long does it take for a word someone makes up that means exactly the same <br/>
thing as a word already in existence to make it into the dictionary? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It would have to be used commonly, or used three or five times (not an exact <br/>
number, but once or twice wouldn&#39;t do it) in articles in the New York Times or <br/>
other nationally/internationally read publications.  And WHICH dictionary?  <br/>
There are slang dictionaries, and now with the internet there are group-built <br/>
temporary dictionaries.  To make it into something like Webster&#39;s or American <br/>
Heritage, the word needs to be in common use.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a short novel called &quot;Frindle&quot; about this very thing.   It&#39;s about <br/>
school, too, so that can be fascinating or irritating or both. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The questions at that site are quite overblown.  It&#39;s a stretched-out short <br/>
story.  But I guess kids are no more creative in asking authors questions about <br/>
their books than most adults are talking to kids.  There&#39;s &quot;What grade are <br/>
you in?&quot; and &quot;Do you like your teacher?&quot;   Kids ask authors how long it took to <br/>
write and whether it will be made into a movie.  This would make one lame <br/>
movie.    As I was reading it (a friend who has never understood unschooling but <br/>
knows I like words gave it to me), I was thinking it would be a fair fantasy <br/>
for a schoolkid, but ONLY in the context of school as an inevitability is it the <br/>
least bit interesting, because throughout it, the teacher is overbearing and <br/>
(seemed to me) mentally abusive, and think she owns English.    So it wasn&#39;t a <br/>
fun read for me.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s also a really cool short play by Vaclav Havel, former dissident <br/>
writer turned president of Czechoslovakia, called _The Memorandum_. It&#39;s <br/>
all about an iron-curtain type dictatorship trying to control the <br/>
meaning of language. As soon as a word begins to take on meaning from <br/>
context and use that goes beyond state control, a new memorandum is sent <br/>
out changing the word.<br/>
<br/>
Linguists have just begun in the past few years seriously studying the <br/>
word &quot;like&quot; and its use among young populations, parsing out all the <br/>
different contextual meanings of &quot;like I said&quot; and &quot;he was all like&quot; and <br/>
so forth. There have been a couple of really interesting pieces about <br/>
this scholarship on NPR in the last year or so that might still be <br/>
accessible if you&#39;re interested.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like this book a great deal, it shows a kid with spirit making changes <br/>
and not giving into authority.  The end is particularly good.  I&#39;ve read <br/>
a lot by the author and I like the one about the invisible boy best, <br/>
it&#39;s very good.<br/>
