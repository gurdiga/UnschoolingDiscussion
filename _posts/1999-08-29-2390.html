<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355768482">In New Zealand we have to be &#39;reviewed&#39; by the education authorities about<br/>
every3 years or so (except that every 2-3 years they have a break for a few<br/>
years, cause they decide there&#39;s no need cause there are so few problems<br/>
with homeschoolers). Anyway, I was support person for my friend whose family<br/>
is really into building massive box constructions. So when the reviewer<br/>
arrived, the entire family room had the furniture pushed back against the<br/>
walls, and the rest of the romm filled with fridge / oven / freezer etc.<br/>
boxes all joined together with No-More-Nails glue! And the kids were firmly<br/>
ensconced inside &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Give the woman her dues: she kicked off her high-heeled shoes, and crawed in<br/>
in her tailored pale blue suit, laddering her stockings as she went, to talk<br/>
to them about what they had made!<br/>

&gt; &gt; What with the doll house, the Lincoln logs, my daughter&#39;s art<br/>
&gt; &gt; projects and the large, heavily decorated &quot;house&quot; made out of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; cardboard box, we give a rather.....busy first impression.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   you mean i&#39;m not the only one with a cardboard box house in my<br/>
&gt; house?  Sterling was having so much fun with the dryer box that hubby<br/>
&gt; came home with one of those tall boxes that refrigerators are shipped<br/>
&gt; in!  it&#39;s been used lying on it&#39;s side as a bus, tractor trailer<br/>
&gt; truck, train, etc, etc.  fantastic imaginative fun!<br/>
