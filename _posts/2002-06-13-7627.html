&lt;&lt; We&#39;ve read here about some kids who really start bursting with mental<br/>
energy after 10pm.<br/>
Many neighbors wouldn&#39;t be visiting at that time of day to see that<br/>
happening.  (Although<br/>
the worst kind of neighbor might notice how late in the morning the kids<br/>
are found in<br/>
their pajamas.)<br/>

Still in their clothes from the night before, at our house! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told the kids that after 10:00 at night they need to be quiet enough not <br/>
to irritate the neighbors.   I&#39;m sure some of my neighbors know my boys are <br/>
up playing games sometimes at 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., or they see the computer <br/>
flicker through the window of my office (which is upstairs, but you can see <br/>
the light changing).<br/>
