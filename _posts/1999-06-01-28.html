<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151536468">Hi<br/>
<br/>
Like I guess everybody else at this point, I&#39;m new to the list.  I live <br/>
in Japan - I&#39;m American, dh is Japanese, and ds (2yr - his real name is <br/>
Michael, but we call him Mook) is both.  At first, about three months <br/>
ago, I started looking online for homeschooling resources because I was <br/>
planning to teach my son English and stuff after school.  The more I <br/>
researched, the more interested I became until I decided to try to teach <br/>
my son at home (which is basically illegal here, but a very few do it <br/>
anyway, and are constantly hounded by child abuse and neglect <br/>
&quot;authorities.&quot;).  Now, I&#39;m convinced I can not teach, but just help <br/>
learn, and I have never enjoyed being a mother more.  These have been <br/>
the best three months of our lives.  Mook is only two, but we&#39;ve <br/>
pursued HIS interests, and his knowledge of bulldozers and other power <br/>
machines is incredible.  I think he must know everything there is to <br/>
know about them (except how to operate one, of course, though he did ask <br/>
me to let him learn), and my own knowledge has grown.  I never thought <br/>
learning anything was worthwhile, and hated school.  But I went to <br/>
public schools from pre-school to college, and, well, I still have not <br/>
completely detoxed yet...:-)<br/>
<br/>
We go to the park and collect leaves and watch the moon rise - just <br/>
enjoy life as it comes.  While other mothers take their two year olds to <br/>
cram schools to learn to read and write and do math (as most mothers do <br/>
in Japan), Mook and I go outside and play soccer.  While the other kids <br/>
are watching tv, Mook and I are reading about power shovels or airplanes <br/>
together.  While other kids go to day care, Mook and I go for walks.  We <br/>
really enjoy our life together - even more so because I&#39;m not just <br/>
waiting &#39;til he&#39;s old enough to send him to school and get him out of <br/>
the house.  I&#39;m not trying to make him smarter than the kid next door.  <br/>
But he does seem a lot happier.  That&#39;s what&#39;s important to me.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re saving up to move to the States, but don&#39;t know where or when.  I <br/>
looked up homeschooling laws on the internet, and Idaho seems to have <br/>
the best - just do it - no papers or authorities - don&#39;t even have to <br/>
tell anyone.  So we&#39;re thinking about there.  Somewhere away from the <br/>
city - a place where we can go exploring, climb trees, go camping, etc. <br/>
in our own backyard.  We&#39;ve got to find a job first, and internet <br/>
searches and job services have not turned up anything.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pregnant due in early November, and Mook is learning a little about <br/>
pregnancy and likes to go with me to the doctor and see the baby on the <br/>
ultrasound.  He learns about whatever he likes - today he taught his <br/>
stuffed animals how to play soccer.  Mook won...:-)  <br/>
<br/>
My husband is very supportive of my homeschooling, but not sure about <br/>
unschooling - not that I have to tell him.  When he asks what we learned <br/>
today, I just tell him what we did in eduspeak, and he never knows any <br/>
different.  He thinks learning can only take place in front of a text <br/>
book (never mind that I learned to speak and read Japanese by being <br/>
here and reading the back of the shampoo bottle - not from a text book).  <br/>
We often take &quot;field trips&quot; to the store, or to an appointment, or <br/>
whatever.  One day on the way home from the park, Mook stopped me so we <br/>
could watch power shovels at a nearby construction site for two hours.  <br/>
(Another field trip.)  He kept telling me what the machines were doing, <br/>
and the names of the parts of them - how they were being used, that kind <br/>
of thing.  I never knew a two year old could be so smart.  But I guess <br/>
they don&#39;t teach about bulldozers at cram school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to get past the &quot;authorities,&quot; we&#39;ve established our own <br/>
&quot;school.&quot;  We&#39;re working on it - getting a website, printing special <br/>
school letterhead stationary - selecting an official name.  We&#39;re <br/>
thinking about &quot;St. Michael&#39;s American Academy.&quot;  hehe  It&#39;s working so <br/>
far.  But the law doesn&#39;t require him to be in school until he&#39;s six, so <br/>
we&#39;ll see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Well, time for our &quot;cooking class.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Love, Melanie in Japan</div>

 </span></blockquote>ROTF! No I guess they don&#39;t teach about bulldozers!  You know what, the neat <br/>
thing about unschooling is that you don&#39;t have to cram anything and when he&#39;s <br/>
12 he&#39;ll be telling you all about some other subject in exactly the same <br/>
detail!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Welcome! and tell us more about Japan! :)<br/>

us about culture and language.  Just a thought...Kimme</div>
