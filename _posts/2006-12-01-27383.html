<br/>
The Unschooling Conference 2008  12 January 8am-5pm<br/>
www.unschoolingconference.com    <br/>
<br/>
H.O.M.E., a Madison-based homeschooling support group since 1986, will be hosting the second Unschooling Conference on January 12 from 8am-5pm at the Lussier Family Heritage Center, 3101 Lake Farm Road, Madison (in Lake Farm Park).  The Unschooling Conference is Wisconsins first and only conference devoted to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a variant of homeschooling which is learner-led, and not curriculum based.  The term unschooling was coined by John Holt, author of numerous books on education and educational alternatives.  Unschooling is an educational option that is available to all Wisconsin families.  Whether you consider yourself an unschooler already and are looking for community and inspiration, or youre curious about educational alternatives for your family, The Unschooling Conference welcomes you!<br/>
<br/>
Especially exciting for the conference this year is keynote speaker Manish Jain, of Shikshantar: The Peoples Institute for Rethinking Development and Education, located in Udaipur, India.  Find out more about Manish and the Institute at www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/<br/>
<br/>
It will be a day of inspiration and connection in a beautiful setting.  Find out more about the conference and find registration materials at  www.unschoolingconference.com <br/>
