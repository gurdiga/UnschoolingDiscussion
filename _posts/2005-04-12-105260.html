<div id="ygrps-yiv-306529372">I&#39;m glad this place is here, because this morning, if there were no place to <br/>
rant and rave, I&#39;d be hauling the kids out of bed (despite their 1 am or <br/>
later bedtime) and cracking the whip.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness, I needed to bake bread, too. :) that helped calm me down.<br/>
<br/>
Now. When  I woke up this morning I had in my mind pictures of the things I <br/>
knew I needed to do today. Since starting geo-caching, and spending more <br/>
time at a &quot;pin money&quot; side job, the house has been more cluttered than I <br/>
like. Yesterday I decluttered some surfaces, like the kitchen table and side <br/>
tables in the front room. Swept. Dishes. etc. Things weren&#39;t super when I <br/>
went to bed, but they were...less irritatingly messy.<br/>
<br/>
When I woke up this morning, the powdered milk and sugar were out on the <br/>
table, along with a bottle of lemon juice (empty). There were crumbled <br/>
tortilla chips in my chair and on the floor near it. There is also powdered <br/>
milk...you know, milk powder?...on the floor. Not a whole lot, but enough to <br/>
crunch under foot. ew. The sink, which had a couple of bowls and a drinking <br/>
cup or two last night, this morning had discarded ramen noodles (and smelled <br/>
it...ramen noodle juice is strong) and more bowls, along with cups harvested <br/>
from various other rooms around the house. A little bowl with a few tortilla <br/>
chips on the side table. On the other side table, a piece of yellow bell <br/>
pepper, (along with some stuff that belongs there).<br/>
<br/>
In the laundry room, I just discovered piles and PILES of laundry, peed on <br/>
by the cat. Someone had &quot;cleaned her room&quot; by bringing down all the dirty <br/>
clothes that had accumulated on the floor over the past weeks, and dumping <br/>
it on the floor. The cat found it, and it was DISGUSTING. This, all over <br/>
night. There was dirty laundry in there, but not on the FREAKING FLOOR!<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you where I&#39;m at with this. 1) the kids are going to start doing <br/>
their own laundry. I&#39;ve about had it. Actually, sending out my Unschooling <br/>
Sensor, I can&#39;t think of anything wrong with this. If their dirty clothes <br/>
make it into the baskets in the laundry room, I&#39;ll wash it. If it&#39;s in piles <br/>
on the floor...well, what will I do? I can&#39;t leave cat urine smelling <br/>
clothes. sheesh. Never mind. My unschooling sensors are BROKEN in this case. <br/>
I&#39;m seeing red. It&#39;s just plain inconsiderate.<br/>
<br/>
2) I&#39;m calling &quot;kitchen closed&quot; when i go to bed. This is not the first time <br/>
I&#39;ve found all kinds of messes in the morning, because they stay up and <br/>
watch TV or play computer games after I&#39;ve gone to bed. Get the munchies? <br/>
Great! We&#39;ll make lemonade, and EAT POWDERED MILK? and chips and salsa. And <br/>
any candy, or ice cream. In fact, we had two half gallons of ice cream. I <br/>
got one bowl, my hubby got one bowl. I think my older girl had a bowl of <br/>
each flavor. And the kids got the rest. And no money until the end of the <br/>
week, to buy more groceries of any kind, let alone supply their stinking <br/>
SUGAR HABIT.<br/>
<br/>
I also found my younger girl&#39;s art kit out, with a streak of chocolate sauce <br/>
across the top. This makes me think they made chocolate milk, and since we <br/>
are out of regular milk (two gallons of which disappeared in two days, with <br/>
the breakfast cereal, a week ago) (I purchase my milk locally, from a dairy <br/>
farm that doesn&#39;t use BGH or antibi&#39;s. It&#39;s the same price, but 15 miles <br/>
across town, so...I hadn&#39;t gotten over there at $2.16 a gallon of gas to <br/>
pick up more...so sorry) Well, they made their milk from powdered, which I <br/>
usually have on hand, and then put the chocolate syrup in it, and got THAT <br/>
all over things, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on the verge of telling them (especially my night owl 10 year old girl <br/>
who hits her peak at 11pm and doesn&#39;t wind down until 3 or 4 in the morning) <br/>
that they can stay awake IN THEIR OWN ROOMS. Don&#39;t raid the kitchen. Don&#39;t <br/>
this, don&#39;t that. She actually fell asleep on the floor in the front room, <br/>
TV on. Who knows what kinds of advertising she&#39;s seeing. ew. Well, it&#39;s <br/>
probably cartoon network or Nickelodeon, but some of the channels have <br/>
revolting ads late at night. &quot;College Girls Naked!&quot; kind of things. ew.<br/>
<br/>
What I did: I picked up the &quot;big chunks&quot; in the front room. I&#39;m going to ask <br/>
them to help finish up in there by sweeping and vacuuming the floor. I did <br/>
all the dishes and made sweet rolls and a loaf of bread. And cleaned up <br/>
after myself in there, so there are no dirty dishes at this time. I&#39;m going <br/>
to ask one of them to put away the clean dishes and (maybe) sweep the floor. <br/>
I have a load of laundry going and plan on getting a whole bunch done today. <br/>
The cat smell is pretty bad. I might ditch the freaking cat. I&#39;ve always had <br/>
problems with this one, anyway. Scratching around in house plants and peeing <br/>
in...clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, thanks for letting me vent a bit. More than likely, it&#39;s &quot;family <br/>
meeting time.&quot; and I&#39;ll be able to express my frustrations without trashing <br/>
the kids. Lots of my anger was already dissipated from picking up and from <br/>
baking bread. and practicing my piano.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fantastic vent.  I read it all and took a deep breath for you.  Thank <br/>
goodness some things can help us cool off before we fire it all out.<br/>
<br/>
I ususally don&#39;t have much of an issue in the house cuz my kids are still <br/>
really little and we all kinda go to bed about the same time so I have no <br/>
surprises in the morning.  But for us, occasionally mine will get beyond my patience <br/>
when we are out running errands or whatever and I am so thankful that we have <br/>
the ride home to listen to music or the DVD or the gameboys or whatever, to <br/>
calm us all down.  By the time we get home, it&#39;s no biggie and we can talk if we <br/>
need to.<br/>
<br/>
I think setting some rules for &quot;after hours&quot; is a good thing.  They may be <br/>
tired and really aren&#39;t thinking about cleaning up at night, maybe the lights <br/>
are low and they don&#39;t see all the crumbs and stuff.  If there are dishes <br/>
they&#39;ve used, they should help clean and put them away.  Same with toys, books, or <br/>
whatever.  Unless of course they are using those things again later.  Since we <br/>
all share the same home, especially &quot;family rooms or common spaces&quot;, they can <br/>
help by taking care of their things.  They probably won&#39;t mind, they may not <br/>
even realize that you feel this way come morning time.  When it comes to the <br/>
dispersing of food (goodies), I really don&#39;t know what helps.  When it comes to <br/>
money and driving to shop, I think it&#39;s much more important to have a few <br/>
guidelines.  If you don&#39;t have the funds to shop continuously then they should <br/>
know that there won&#39;t be more until next time.  No special trips.  If you usually <br/>
buy 2 gallons of milk, maybe when the first is gone, the other should be for <br/>
cooking only.  With ice cream, buy the usual and if it&#39;s gone, see if they&#39;d <br/>
like to make their own.  It&#39;s funny with us because we have bought snacks or <br/>
foods that each family member enjoys and then everyone has something they like.  <br/>
Well, now our boys are bigger and beginning to like Daddy&#39;s snacks so he <br/>
always says he&#39;ll have to start hiding his goodies :o)  Even though he wouldn&#39;t.  <br/>
He just remembers a time when they would turn their noses up to almost all of <br/>
our stuff and now they are enjoying those things too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing, I feel like I&#39;m less alone when others have share their <br/>
ups and downs.  I hope all goes well with your family meeting.<br/>

Wash it?  It&#39;s a technicality, basket or out.  Were there enough  empty <br/>
baskets for the stuff from her room?  Was the washing machine  empty?  Was she more <br/>
excited about going right back and cleaning?<br/>
 <br/>
Did she decide on her own to clean her room voluntarily?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I&#39;m calling &quot;kitchen closed&quot; when i go to bed.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s the principle behind that?<br/>
Would it be better to talk go them about leaving it cleaner than they found  <br/>
it, or could you have snacks already ready that are NOT really messy?<br/>
 <br/>
Making rules about times doesn&#39;t help them learn to clean up, or to help  <br/>
them decide what is and isn&#39;t a good late-night food project and why.<br/>
 <br/>
I came back last night to LOTS of dirty dishes, and a dishwasher full of  <br/>
clean dishes, not put away.  Well they weren&#39;t out of clean dishes.  I  waited <br/>
until this morning, and cleaned the kitchen. I COULD have worked up a  froth of <br/>
resentment, but I chose not to.  I had already thought lovely  thoughts about <br/>
how nice it was that when I had called a few hours before they  were all home, <br/>
even though I hadn&#39;t been home since 10:30 a.m. and hadn&#39;t seen  them.  Kirby <br/>
had taken the car Marty usually drives and had put gas in  it!  Kinda sweet, <br/>
but Marty had been forced to take the big van Kirby  usually drives, which was <br/>
almost out of gas, and Marty didn&#39;t have as much  choice as Kirby to put gas <br/>
in.  No way could he afford to fill it up.   But they were all home, each <br/>
having put gas in a car.  All were getting  along well and being helpful.<br/>
 <br/>
I had been at the hospital (emergency room and admission) with Keith for 13  <br/>
or 14 hours, and yet the kids had still gone to class, work, had friends over, <br/>
 driven a friend home and come back, NOT been in any way  irresponsible.  <br/>
Holly felt safe and happy, Marty wished he&#39;d been  driving the 30mpg instead of <br/>
the 8/9mpg monster, but he&#39;ll recover (only put in  $5). <br/>
 <br/>
They left a mess in the kitchen, but they had also fed themselves and put  <br/>
the dishes in the sink.  And they were alive and healthy and I had been  able to <br/>
be at the hospital because I trust them and they didn&#39;t act differently  with <br/>
me gone than they would&#39;ve with me there.<br/>
 <br/>
Keith had an array of puzzling system.  He has (at least, maybe other  <br/>
things, maybe not) a 7 cm abcess between lower colon and bladder, so no  wonder.  No <br/>
wonder LOTS of things, and he&#39;s on big IV antibiotics.  He  had been very ill <br/>
for 10 days.  Now we know it&#39;s not a horrible  surgery-requiring thing, and <br/>
he will probably recover pretty easily.  The  kids are healthy and safe.  And I <br/>
can do some dishes and laundry and be  grateful.<br/>

before I got started on the dishes. they were part of the pile I <br/>
washed, because I went through and gathered them.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is standard procedure. Cleaning the bedroom means taking all <br/>
clothing off the floor and putting it in the laundry room. Both girls <br/>
do it. Laundry that has been folded is taken into their rooms by <br/>
them, and left on the bed until it dumps on the floor, and then <br/>
clean, folded clothing is put back into the laundry room. I&#39;ve <br/>
unfolded clean clothes from laundry baskets waiting to be washed. <br/>
Usually, I can just put it back on whoever&#39;s folded pile, and get it <br/>
back to them. Not when the cat&#39;s been in it. <br/>
<br/>
Part of what I was venting about this morning was the inconsiderate-<br/>
ness of &quot;cleaning her room&quot; simply meaning &quot;letting mom do all this <br/>
laundry&quot; and MOST of that was just because it&#39;s how it is done SO <br/>
often around here.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah. I just needed to rattle it out. That was me, after a couple of <br/>
hours getting some cleaning up done, making bread, practicing my <br/>
piano, starting a load of laundry. I wasn&#39;t nearly as ticked off when <br/>
I wrote that, as I was when I first got up and was confronted by the <br/>
mess. <br/>
<br/>
I did ask the kid(s) responsible not to leave messes like that any <br/>
more. They said &quot;okay.&quot; I&#39;ll remind them tonight before I hit the <br/>
sack.<br/>

I&#39;m glad to hear it&#39;s not any big, scary thing with Keith.  I&#39;d read another post from you about him not being well, and was thinking of you all.  It sounds like everyone did a great job of taking care of each other, and all went well enough to allow you to be where Keith needed you.  I hope he&#39;s feeling better and back home soon.<br/>

<br/>
Reading your post, a couple things came to mind.  One: The sappy poem about rocking your baby instead of cleaning the cobwebs.  Two: Yes, it is sometimes overwhelming being the responsible party.  What a gift to our children that someone else is there to take care of things, for a few years anyway.<br/>
<br/>
How many of us really paid attention when the more experienced mothers said &quot;nap with your baby&quot; &quot;the housework can wait&quot; &quot;they grow so fast&quot; and those other words of wisdom that are so true?<br/>
<br/>
My babies are gone.  Forever.  Why did I think anything was more important than just holding them and playing with them?  They are 9 and 12 now.  Why do I still sometimes think that there is anything more important than just hanging out with my pre-teens or helping them meet their needs?  In about 10 years, they will be young adults and won&#39;t be &#39;bothering&#39; me about things like laundry, messy rooms, wanting snacks when I&#39;ve just cleaned the kitchen, or spilling the beverage they poured on their own (rather than asking me to do it for them).  I will have no excuses for the messy house (except for dh, maybe).  My children will no longer be the major part of my life.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is frustrating to face never ending laundry, dishes, spills, etc.  Don&#39;t take it out on the kids!<br/>

<br/>

 <br/>
My mother retired, and lives alone.  A few years after her retirement,  while <br/>
I was visiting she said, &quot;I used to think you kids were the reason the  house <br/>
was always a mess.  Now I realize it was ME all along!&quot;   :)<br/>

  I was reading this post and I guess I have &quot;been there&quot; so many times that <br/>
I really was laughing. Not at you, but at how familiar it all seemed. I have <br/>
had these very same things happen to me and reading your posts and the <br/>
replies helped me to understand how I was feeling. Thank you for putting my <br/>
thoughts into words. Maybe the next time I am feeling this way, I might try <br/>
venting to the cyber-world. Blessings, Kandi</div>

&gt; later bedtime) and cracking the whip.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&quot;ve felt the same way sometimes and been glad to come sit and read what <br/>
others have to say.  There are always people with worse problems than I <br/>
have, plus the advice here is so positive and encouraging that it (almost) <br/>
immediately lifts my mood.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thank goodness, I needed to bake bread, too. :) that helped calm me <br/>
&gt; down.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s great that you have that positive outlet.:-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I woke up this morning, the powdered milk and sugar were out on the<br/>
&gt; table, along with a bottle of lemon juice (empty). There were crumbled<br/>
&gt; tortilla chips in my chair and on the floor near it. There is also <br/>
&gt; powdered<br/>
&gt; milk...you know, milk powder?...on the floor. Not a whole lot, but enough <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; crunch under foot. ew.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I ask my children (and husband) to clean up their messes - sometimes they do <br/>
it and other times they tell me that &quot;the commercial was over and the show <br/>
was starting&quot; or some other reason (not excuse).   If I ask them later all <br/>
of them will usually do it without complaint.  Most of the time I just clean <br/>
it up myself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; The sink, which had a couple of bowls and a drinking<br/>
&gt; cup or two last night, this morning had discarded ramen noodles (and <br/>
&gt; smelled<br/>
&gt; it...ramen noodle juice is strong) and more bowls, along with cups <br/>
&gt; harvested<br/>
&gt; from various other rooms around the house. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like to do dishes late at night, but in the morning it&#39;s as relaxing <br/>
to me as the baking is for you.  I love the feel of the suds and water, the <br/>
sense of accomplishment at seeing the (often huge) pile go down, and the <br/>
time alone to think my own thoughts and plans for the day.  Trust me, no one <br/>
bothers me at that time (they might be asked to dry and put away!). &lt;BG&gt; <br/>
Actually, sometimes one will come talk and help, if it&#39;s later in the day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In the laundry room, I just discovered piles and PILES of laundry, peed on<br/>
&gt; by the cat. Someone had &quot;cleaned her room&quot; by bringing down all the dirty<br/>
&gt; clothes that had accumulated on the floor over the past weeks, and dumping<br/>
&gt; it on the floor. The cat found it, and it was DISGUSTING. This, all over<br/>
&gt; night. There was dirty laundry in there, but not on the FREAKING FLOOR!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We just got a kitten ths week and I hope that he&#39;s a good litter-box user. <br/>
We&#39;ve had both kinds, so I can definitely sympathize!<br/>
Can you close the laundry room door to keep the cat out?  Or is that where <br/>
the litter box is?  I&#39;m always glad when the boys bring their laundry from <br/>
their rooms and epecially if they do it unasked!  Could you give each child <br/>
a basket to carry down to the laundry room?  I&#39;ve tried this and it works a <br/>
little bit (not consistently, but it helps).  My pattern is to do the <br/>
laundry, sort it on my bed, then put it in baskets in the hall for the boys <br/>
to carry upstairs to their rooms.  But I found out our pomeranian Snoopy <br/>
likes to sleep in those baskets, so now I try to hand them the baskets when <br/>
they&#39;re on their way up.  I thought about having each do their own laundry, <br/>
but it&#39;s actually easier for us to mix it because then I wash fewer and full <br/>
loads - saves on elec., water, soap, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m calling &quot;kitchen closed&quot; when i go to bed. This is not the first <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found all kinds of messes in the morning, because they stay up and<br/>
&gt; watch TV or play computer games after I&#39;ve gone to bed. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine almost always are up until after I go to bed and they definitely want <br/>
to eat.  Also, my dh gets home from work many nights at 1 or 2 am, and he <br/>
usually wants to eat then too.  I could never close the kitchen.   I do ask <br/>
them to put away perishables (refrig. or frozen stuff).  Maybe you could ask <br/>
them what they might want later for a snack and fix it for them before you <br/>
go to bed.  Or have some non-messy things to choose.  My children do a lot <br/>
of microwave foods (and also Ramen noodles - John almost lives on those).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, we had two half gallons of ice cream. I<br/>
&gt; got one bowl, my hubby got one bowl. I think my older girl had a bowl of<br/>
&gt; each flavor. And the kids got the rest. And no money until the end of the<br/>
&gt; week, to buy more groceries of any kind, let alone supply their stinking<br/>
&gt; SUGAR HABIT.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are some foods that are so popular with our kids that we do portion <br/>
them to be &quot;fair.&quot;   When I buy yogurt I let them choose what kind they <br/>
want.  If they choose Trix and I can only afford one package, they each get <br/>
two.   Last week, I was able to get them each their own package - James got <br/>
Trix and John and Joshua chose X-something (only 4 to a pack and almost <br/>
$3.00).  Often I buy three medium-size bottles of PowerAde so each boy has <br/>
his own.  This whole system works well for us, because some family members <br/>
eat or drink something in one day, while others take a little each day for <br/>
several days. They all feel this is a good way to divide the special things <br/>
(and sometimes when one has run out another will share, and other times I <br/>
hear them bargaining and I think of the Bible story of Jacob and Esau).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m on the verge of telling them (especially my night owl 10 year old <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; girl<br/>
&gt; who hits her peak at 11pm and doesn&#39;t wind down until 3 or 4 in the <br/>
&gt; morning)<br/>
&gt; that they can stay awake IN THEIR OWN ROOMS. Don&#39;t raid the kitchen.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My ds 26 and his wife gave John a mini-fridge for his (I think) 12th <br/>
birthday.  His friends think it is soooo cool.  He keeps his drinks, yogurt, <br/>
and other snacks in his room.   If he wants warm (like Ramen or pizza) he <br/>
does go down to the kitchen.  For a long time I had trouble getting him to <br/>
bring the dishes back down, but now I have a huge stack of paper plates and <br/>
he can use those.  Also, for a dollar (sometimes free) his brother will get <br/>
them all for me and collect the cans (which he then recycles and gets paid <br/>
again).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Okay, thanks for letting me vent a bit. More than likely, it&#39;s &quot;family<br/>
&gt; meeting time.&quot; and I&#39;ll be able to express my frustrations without <br/>
&gt; trashing<br/>
&gt; the kids. Lots of my anger was already dissipated from picking up and from<br/>
&gt; baking bread. and practicing my piano.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; blessings, HeidiC&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank You for sharing and trusting others to listen and support.  Best <br/>
wishes for your family meeting and for the rest of your day!<br/>
