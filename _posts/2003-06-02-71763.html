remembered correctly. Glad to find out I did! (I play with my 8 year <br/>
old son).<br/>

You can create a dack out of any cards that you have. So if you <br/>
want the Kaiba cards with your starter deck, no problem.<br/>
<br/>
The main thing the rules book tells you, though, is how to create <br/>
a deck to use for the game. It recommends that you only use <br/>
about 40 cards. That means some deck assembly beforehand. If <br/>
you&#39;re just starting out, use their guidelines. The main thing to <br/>
keep in mind is that you have a good number of monster cards <br/>
with less than five stars. If you load your deck with monster <br/>
cards that are have five or more stars, you have to offer a tribue <br/>
(sacrifice a lower star monster card) in order to play the more <br/>
powerful monster cards.<br/>
<br/>
When we first played, my son overloaded both our decks with the <br/>
really powerful monsters and almost immediately we got stuck <br/>
and unable to do much of anything. We couldn&#39;t get monsters on <br/>
the field and then couldn&#39;t use our magic or trap cards either. <br/>
The game went nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
So bottom line: use any yu-gi-oh cards you have in any <br/>
combination that you have from any deck that you have, but be <br/>
sure to follow the rule book guidelines at the beginning for the <br/>
right ratio of types of cards to each other.<br/>
<br/>
Amazingly, I&#39;ve come to enjoy playing!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499182374">Kirby, who runs the Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments at Active Imagination, says you can <br/>
combine them.  <br/>
<br/>
Channeling Kirby, who&#39;s on the phone:  <br/>
The starter sets are just a sample, arranged deck.<br/>
You can combine those two decks if you want along with any boosters, so long <br/>
as they&#39;re all in English.<br/>
<br/>
You can make your own deck then, of 60 cards (or whatever the mininum is) but <br/>
there&#39;s not a maximum number. <br/>
<br/>
If you have two kids you can combine and split, or however you want to do <br/>
that.<br/>
