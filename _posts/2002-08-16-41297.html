&gt; My church tells me I&#39;m not going to hell, and my school-at-home colleagues<br/>
&gt; are sure that I am.  I figure I win either way, since I&#39;ve met some pretty<br/>
&gt; facinating people here (and elsewhere) that will surely be there, too, if<br/>
&gt; the doomsayers are right.  Should be a very nice party.  (So long as <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; no dr. pepper...I agree, Mary!)<br/>
