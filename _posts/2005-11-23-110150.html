 </span></blockquote>Have you read much biography and autobiography of unschoolers or people whose <br/>
childhoods weren&#39;t controlled and limited?   Shit happens, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
turn a safe, peaceful home into a controlling, disrespectful-of-children home all <br/>
of a sudden.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know which part of Ren&#39;s post you thought was certainly true and <br/>
always would be true, because the rest of your writing seems to suggest there are <br/>
no solid principles to depend on.<br/>
<br/>
New influences won&#39;t keep my children from using good judgment after their <br/>
whole lifetimes of making decisions based on the best of what they know at the <br/>
time.   If they go nuts and join cults, they still won&#39;t have to run away.   <br/>
They can say &quot;I&#39;m going to join this cult.   See ya.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the absence of controls, how could a child rebell?   In the absence of <br/>
being kept in the house, given freedom to go on road trips when they want to, and <br/>
to stay overnight with friends when they want to, what would running away <br/>
accomplish?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if Keith or I left or died and the other married someone creepy and <br/>
controlling, that might be worth running away from.   That would mean that the <br/>
contract had changed, though, the nest was broken, and the child wasn&#39;t really <br/>
leaving his home, but leaving the home of the new stepparent.<br/>
