 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t so off topic, is it?   If a child doesn&#39;t feel safe and attended <br/>
to, he can&#39;t learn.   So you need to make your child safe.    Even when it&#39;s <br/>
safe from a sibling.    That&#39;s one way to approach the other sibling too, to <br/>
explain that if a stranger came in and started yelling at him or hitting him, you <br/>
would act immediately to keep him safe, that it would NOT be okay for someone <br/>
to do that to him.    And then when he&#39;s feeling how good that feels to know <br/>
you&#39;ll protect him, remind him that you&#39;ll protect his brother the same way, <br/>
even from him.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote years back that someone found again for me so I put <br/>
it in a safer place:<br/>

This still works here.   Holly was sad yesterday about something Kirby had <br/>
said.   I asked her if she wanted me to talk to him and she said no, but I <br/>
would&#39;ve been glad to if she thought it would&#39;ve helped.   And it&#39;s all based on <br/>
how things were untangled when they were little.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Letting them work it out&quot; often empowers a bully and contributes to the <br/>
abuse of one who&#39;s losing.   Why should a child not be safe in his own home?     <br/>
And learning how to stave off fights with a sibling is learning skills that <br/>
will apply in other situations.<br/>

<br/>
Probably the fine print says the backup shouldn&#39;t be in use while the other <br/>
one is.    <br/>
<br/>
I read all the fine print recently on Adobe Photo Elements, and you can <br/>
install it on a laptop AND a desktop, but not if the two are going to be in use at <br/>
the same time.    <br/>
<br/>
But copies of one&#39;s own music has long been legal and no big deal.   If you <br/>
put an album on a cassette tape, or now a tape onto a CD...    it&#39;s a minor <br/>
offense if any, and I think this is about the same deal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053092038">Okay, I&#39;m not an intellectual property authority, but I have looked <br/>
into Fair Use rules (check www.nolo.com or www.copyright.gov if <br/>
interested) and can say that in order for a backup copy of music or <br/>
software to clearly fall under Fair Use it has to be archival--that <br/>
is, the original and the copy can *not* be in use simultaneously. <br/>
Individual items can, of course, allow for broader copy permissibility <br/>
(as in Sandra&#39;s example of something that can be loaded on a laptop <br/>
and a PC, or freeware that specifically allows the user to make and <br/>
distribute copies).<br/>
<br/>
But now we are doubly OT, so having said that--back to unschooling.<br/>
