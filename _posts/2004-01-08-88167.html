<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286977543">I sometimes wish that Anne would be on this list----and she&#39;s been absent <br/>
lately on the boards (she just needs some time away to reconnect with her own <br/>
family---BOY! Do *I* understand THAT! &lt;g&gt; I&#39;ve been taking my own break.), so I <br/>
forwarded this message on to her for her imput. She didn&#39;t want to come here, <br/>
but she asked that I forward her response on.<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***We&#39;ve been &quot;officially&quot; homeschooling since<br/>
September, but haven&#39;t really changed anything, except keep Felix&#39;s<br/>
drawings and all in case we get asked about them by the school board.***<br/>
<br/>
I was just talking about this to a woman who comes to my library program.  <br/>
She is a single homeschooling Mom and I usually try not to mix my unschooling <br/>
passion with my library program, but everyone else had left and she was there <br/>
talking to me and I just could NOT listen to her tell me anymore about how she <br/>
is only giving her daughter three worksheets a week instead of six, and how she <br/>
won&#39;t do math with her because she, the Mom, is so bad at math.<br/>
<br/>
I would CRINGE whenever something like that came out of her mouth, so I <br/>
finally said, &quot;Do you know about unschooling?&quot;  And I gave her the basic overview <br/>
of unschooling...and she was very interested.  But she kept saying she wants <br/>
something there in case the school system asks for documentation.  I told her I <br/>
thought that wasn&#39;t very fair to her child because some states don&#39;t require <br/>
ANY homeschool reporting or documentation.  I said I would not punish my <br/>
children with doing school just because we live in New York State and have to do <br/>
quarterly reports.  She went off into a dreamy state and said she wishes she <br/>
could be like mutual friends of ours who homeschool underground and don&#39;t have to <br/>
answer to the system.  I told her she COULD.  <br/>
<br/>
Live AS IF school does not exist.  <br/>
<br/>
If people put as much life&#39;s energy into living a rich, joyful life with <br/>
their child as they put into worrying about what the schools believe our children <br/>
should be learning, then the children would be getting LOADS more than the <br/>
children in school were getting...and in many more ways than just academia.  But <br/>
some parents are so consumed with comparing their children, worrying about <br/>
reporting to the school, worrying about what their children AREN&#39;T getting, that <br/>
they close off that path that could be letting in so much LIFE, so much JOY, <br/>
and so much TRUST. <br/>
<br/>
Fear must be released in order for Joy, Life, and Real Learning to enter.<br/>
<br/>
Genevieve, what does Jonathan love to do?  Where does he SHINE?  When, in <br/>
life, is he able to see himself shining in his Mom&#39;s eyes?  Because I&#39;m reading <br/>
about how he is frustrating you...and I&#39;m sure there are times when he does <br/>
SHINE...but it&#39;s absent from this post.  And if it&#39;s absent from this post, it <br/>
might be absent from your lives, too...and you might need a reminder to shift <br/>
your perspective of your son and see him for his blessings, his gifts.  He needs <br/>
to be celebrated for Who He Is, and not seen as a frustration.  He KNOWS he&#39;s <br/>
frustrating you, and that&#39;s SO frustrating to him, which sets up this vicious <br/>
cycle even more.<br/>
<br/>
The cycle of frustration will end when you decide to let it end.  Focus on <br/>
this child&#39;s true spirit.  Trust that he is in this world to bless you and teach <br/>
you and share his gifts.  <br/>
<br/>
This child does not need school, as he is a non-typical child who will be <br/>
destroyed in school by being told over and over again that he needs to change and <br/>
conform.  He needs to know that he is fine just As He Is.  Once he feels <br/>
loved and honored for those things that make him Who He Is, the rest of the <br/>
&quot;behavior&quot; challenges will be minimized.  <br/>
<br/>
If his behavior is bad at the dinner table, listen to that.  He&#39;s not telling <br/>
you in words how he feels, but he&#39;s still telling you.  Why does he have to <br/>
be at the dinner table?  Let him be Free.<br/>
<br/>
If his behavior is bad at crowded places, PLEASE listen to that.  I have a <br/>
child who gets very anxious in crowded places, and we honor that about him.  We <br/>
believed him when he said things like that make him nervous.  We were in the <br/>
mall the other day, and the lights and the music in some stores made him so <br/>
anxious.  He is 13 now and because his family has always honored him and believed <br/>
him (frustations, quirks and all...), he knows now that when he starts <br/>
feeling anxious from crowds or certain people or other things that it&#39;s OK.  He&#39;s <br/>
still OK.  He can walk outside and breathe.  He can shift his focus to things <br/>
that he loves.  Because he knows it&#39;s OK to be HimSelf...he knows that no one <br/>
will ask him to be any less that who he truly is, even if that includes becoming <br/>
anxious and not understanding some things (like simple directions sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
What does Jonathan love?  What are his passions?  What does he eat up when he <br/>
sees it (I mean his brain and his heart, not his mouth!)?  What part of the <br/>
world does he introduce to you?  Do you honor that and listen to that and find <br/>
that interesting?   <br/>
<br/>
Allow your child to SHINE in your eyes.  Focus on those shining moments, and <br/>
the frustrating moments will not completely disappear, but will be easier for <br/>
you will have a greater understanding of your child&#39;s spirit.  <br/>
<br/>
Put away the school work, lighten up the control, and focus on your child&#39;s <br/>
heart, his passions.  See his frustrating behavior as his way of trying to tell <br/>
you something else.  Believe him.  Honor him.  <br/>
<br/>
See the world from his eyes, from his heart, and let him take you into that <br/>
part of the world that he loves and understands...that part of the world where <br/>
he sees himself Shining.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend you read &quot;The Highly Sensitive Child&quot; and see if you see <br/>
your son in it.  Also, raising your spirited child might be beneficiary (I&#39;ve <br/>
never read it, but it is recommended by others).   <br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

Choosing to focus positively instead of negatively. <br/>

Wow, I am so incredibly blessed by this post.  I am<br/>
going to print it out and leave the computer now, and<br/>
just cherish this feeling for a while.<br/>

Thank you Anne.  Thank you.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506273497">Thank you Anne for taking the time to post this, it&#39;s truely beautiful!<br/>
I&#39;ve read everything everyone posted about my post, and about the food<br/>
issue that was following, and it&#39;s helped alot.  I guess I needed to<br/>
hear what I was feeling but that everyone around me was going against.<br/>
I am responding more to him, his needs and his frustrations, and things<br/>
have improved a lot.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my perception or his<br/>
behavior, but it&#39;s SO good to feel the connection slowly coming back! He<br/>
IS a glowing person, but I guess I was shading him out, just because I<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to take him, and everyone&#39;s great reassurance and ideas<br/>
have helped tremendously.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I must say though, that we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school work,  and the reference to<br/>
the school board, is because Felix went to Kindergarten last year, and<br/>
is listed in the school board.  I sent a letter telling his he&#39;d be<br/>
homeschooled this year, but am keeping what I find around the house(<br/>
that would otherwise end up in recycling) just in case I get asked what<br/>
did he do this year.  They&#39;re quite unsure about the homeschooling thing<br/>
and our region had quite bad problems with other families (although I<br/>
didn&#39;t yet), so it&#39;s mostly for covering in case there&#39;s something.<br/>
Jonathan is not and WILL NOT be  listed since he won&#39;t go to school and<br/>
we won&#39;t have those problems... luckily!<br/>
 <br/>
THANK YOU, every idea is appreciated, <br/>
