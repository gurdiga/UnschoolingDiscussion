&gt; &lt;&lt;I I have I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; read, if one has the money and wants the whole school scene and one is<br/>
&gt; close<br/>
&gt; by, then okay. I feel like if a child *has* to go to school, then a<br/>
&gt; Sudbury<br/>
&gt; is the way to go. But I still think unschooling is better.&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My best friend&#39;s son Nick (who is my son&#39;s best friend) goes to a Sudbury <br/>
School in CT. The &quot;unschooling&quot; aspect of education is identical, really, to <br/>
Unschooling at Home. The big difference is Family.<br/>
<br/>
Sudbury Schools downplay family (specifically parents).  That&#39;s noty to <br/>
suggest that they incite rebellion, but more that during the school day, parents <br/>
are not really a factor.<br/>
<br/>
For Nick, being a round a bunch of like-minded kids is important, and he is <br/>
very happy there. He has no interest in homeschooling. I asked Julian if he <br/>
thought that, if we lived in CT, he would want to attend the Sudbury School, if <br/>
only to be with Nick.<br/>
<br/>
He said that if for some reason he had to go to school, he&#39;d want it to be a <br/>
Sudbury School, but that being with his parents was most important to him. <br/>
Julian&#39;s not a terribly social kid (not anti-social in any way, and meeting him, <br/>
you&#39;d probably be surprised to hear he wasn&#39;t very social), and he likes being <br/>
with his mama. :)<br/>
<br/>
So...a plug...we adore Nick, and like most Sudbury schools his is struggling. <br/>
If you know people in the Greater Hartford area who might be interested, give <br/>
me a howl. It&#39;s really important his school survives!<br/>

It said, &quot; Parents are welcome for brief visits when they pick-up and drop-off their children, but are not allowed on campus for extended visits without prior approval of the School Meeting.&quot;<br/>

Didn&#39;t sit right with me - but I thought I was maybe being paranoid.<br/>

your child in your absence. It&#39;s really about not being able to trust the parents <br/>
not to interfere with their (or others&#39;) kid&#39;s learning process -- that they <br/>
will make the kids start doing math or something. In many cases, it&#39;s not an <br/>
unfounded fear.<br/>
<br/>
Another aspect of Sudbury is that the kids have lots of power: hiring and <br/>
firing staff, making rules, etc. Adults often interfere when they start seeing <br/>
kids being empowered.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you unschool at home or send your kid to Sudbury-- you have to trust <br/>
your kid, and the process.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that rule is in place because lots of parents couldn&#39;t get out of <br/>
their own or their kids&#39; ways to let it happen.<br/>
