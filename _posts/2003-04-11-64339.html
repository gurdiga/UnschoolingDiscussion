&gt; &gt; I first had to evaluate if they were really hungry.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If they were really young, I would just take them out of the store,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or continue my shopping.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did learn an effective trick to older children who did the lay down&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; on the floor tantrum or throw a fit in the toy section.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It was to watch them, standing by my cart, look at my watch occasionally<br/>
&gt; and say hmmm....I really thought when you were crying, you were doing<br/>
&gt; a much better job! etc.&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; OR <br/>
&gt; &gt; How much longer do you feel the need to do this? I have about 3 more<br/>
&gt; &gt; minutes, so just go ahead and continue I will let you know when your time<br/>
&gt; is up!<br/>
