<div id="ygrps-yiv-52813100">&lt;&lt;Last night we watched Forrest Gump&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Last night we watched &quot;Gettysburg&quot;.  I got it at the library because Zach likes to watch stuff blow up and is a gun nut.  Also dh&#39;s grandparents lived very close to there.  We talked, shushed each other, asked and answered questions.  Adriane was highly incensed that women weren&#39;t allowed combat duty which took us off in an entirely different direction.<br/>
<br/>
We also watched &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; the other night.  Adriane is still talking about the movie and all the restrictions placed on the Quakers.  She was able to relate it to some children she knows whose parents are fundamentalists.<br/>
