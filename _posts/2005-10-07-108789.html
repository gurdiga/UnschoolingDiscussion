 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done that, Denise -- focus on how much I need a break and how much work<br/>
I need to do and how the heck do I get &quot;me&quot; time. I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s a<br/>
destructive pattern of thinking because, frankly, it alters the way I look<br/>
at and interact with my children. Seeing them as hindrances and something I<br/>
need an escape from ultimately isn&#39;t good for our relationships. I&#39;ve been a<br/>
lot happier (and I&#39;m sure they have, too!) since I&#39;ve consciously accepted<br/>
that they will be with me almost always and that my goal is to enjoy them<br/>
and to make life as rich for them as possible. Maybe it&#39;s easier for me<br/>
because I have always enjoyed them tremendously -- with just occasional<br/>
bouts of frustration -- and they&#39;ve never been to school or preschool.<br/>
<br/>
My house isn&#39;t neat. I don&#39;t cook from scratch all the time -- I often make<br/>
ahead large batches of basic ingredients we all like: rice, meat, potatoes<br/>
-- and we eat fruit and veggies raw most of the time. I used to do the<br/>
buying club and make more whole wheat breads and biscuits and such, but I&#39;ve<br/>
been simplifying our diets -- partially because I don&#39;t need that many carbs<br/>
and the kids don&#39;t miss them. I don&#39;t do a lot of chopping. I do spend a lot<br/>
of time with my husband, just talking about current events and sports and<br/>
other things of interest to both of us, and I spend a lot of time talking to<br/>
and doing things with my kids: library, parks, museums, the skating rink.<br/>
Today we&#39;re going to a pumpkin patch. I also work a lot on the computer -- I<br/>
have deadlines and paying clients and then volunteer work on top of that. My<br/>
computer is right next to the TV in our playroom. I don&#39;t suffer from<br/>
depression (I know I&#39;m lucky) -- when I&#39;ve had bouts of the blues it&#39;s<br/>
frequently when I have felt trapped, oftentimes because I&#39;ve been sitting<br/>
around the house, looking inward and looking at my life&#39;s restrictions<br/>
rather than the possibilities.<br/>
