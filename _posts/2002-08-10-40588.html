&lt;&lt; OK, so my point was that the state in MA puts requirements on homeschoolers<br/>
that some homeschoolers fulfill by lying about their plans. The Bryants did<br/>
not accept forced lying, preferring to be truthful and to expect decent<br/>
treatment by the state authorities. Instead, the state refused to accept<br/>
honesty and insisted that they lie in order to be free. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your either/or dichotomies create falsehood.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to submit a plan which is not a lie.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are Americans in Massachusetts free people, or not? Are you telling us that<br/>
regulations created by one-size-fits-all bureaucrats are fine, just because<br/>
they are &quot;easy to fill out&quot;? Whose side are you on?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was addressed to Joyce, not me.  But the continuing stridency of the <br/>
rhetoric you use (&quot;Whose side are you on?&quot; as though there are only two <br/>
sides) does nothing but flood this list with strident rhetoric and insult.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The Bryants are taking one small step, at huge personal expense and risk, in<br/>
order to help ALL homeschoolers everywhere, and you say they should cave in<br/>
to a bad regulation supported by a vindictive and stupid judge?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s &quot;whose side&quot; I am on:<br/>
<br/>
My life is lived with priorities, NOT with choosing sides.<br/>
<br/>
My priorities involve maintaining a safe and peaceful and stimulating <br/>
environment for my kids.  They&#39;re happy and they&#39;re thoughtful and they&#39;re <br/>
considerate of other people.<br/>
<br/>
My priorities philosohically involve truth and goodness and living in the <br/>
world.  I don&#39;t mean knowing the One Big Truth because I don&#39;t think there is <br/>
one.  But just because there&#39;s no one truth doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no such <br/>
thing as bullshit.   The people I have around me care about their own <br/>
integrity and about being better people on an individual bases.  Virtues and <br/>
ethics.<br/>
<br/>
No one person can do everything in the world.  People make choices.  My <br/>
choices keep me busy already and being involved in political activism is not <br/>
on my list, but I have friends who are politically involved and I appreciate <br/>
that they are.  I have friends who are childless and they appreciate that I <br/>
had children.  We don&#39;t have to divide the world into us and them and take a <br/>
side.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Please restore my faith here. Explain your stance.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your faith in Joyce won&#39;t help or hurt you or the list, will it?  <br/>
Oh.  It was just an insult, not a real request.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, don&#39;t explain anything.  Ned will just insult your explanation.<br/>
<br/>
I think if Ned is left to continue here he will do so without regard to the <br/>
listowner&#39;s wishes or anyone else&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I think if Ned is removed from the list he will go elsewhere and characterize <br/>
this list falsely and tell his own version of what happened without regard to <br/>
what anyone else said or ever will say.  I saw him ignore others&#39; feelings <br/>
and experiences and statements about learning to read.  I think its a &quot;damned <br/>
if you do and damned if you don&#39;t&quot; situation.<br/>

interesting. His posts have caused me to look much further into the role of <br/>
government in education. I have found that there is some basis for his <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*All* political views is the problem. Political discussions with more than<br/>
one point of view generate a *huge* amount of mail. (It generated a huge<br/>
amount of mail while people were trying to stop it from generating too much<br/>
mail!) The list would effectively stop being about unschooling and be about<br/>
the politics of education.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to see it that way because *right now* it seems to be a choice<br/>
between Ned and no Ned. And some are finding Ned&#39;s point of view<br/>
interesting. But one political point of view isn&#39;t an option for an<br/>
inclusive list. I don&#39;t think anyone really wants that. It&#39;s either all<br/>
political points of view or none.<br/>
<br/>
The politics of education isn&#39;t the niche this list is here to fill. This<br/>
list is here to provide a place to discuss unschooling. It would be cheating<br/>
the people who came here looking for that to turn it into a political<br/>
discussion list.<br/>
<br/>
If your grocery store advertised itself as a grocery store but started<br/>
shoving all the groceries in the far neglected corner and all the workers<br/>
were too busy to devote much time to the groceries because they were<br/>
spending time selling the cars the rest of the store had been filled with,<br/>
wouldn&#39;t you be a bit miffed? Wouldn&#39;t you probably take your shopping<br/>
somewhere else? Or complain?<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean political discussion (or cars) aren&#39;t valuable or<br/>
appropriate. It just isn&#39;t workable for the list to do both unschooling<br/>
discussion and political discussion. It&#39;s just too much mail and too much<br/>
energy that would get redirected from unschooling to politics.<br/>
<br/>
You (anyone) can start another list. You can even have just one political<br/>
point of view if you want! They&#39;re free. Yahoo makes it very easy. (But if<br/>
anyone needs help doing it just email me.) Put a tagline beneath your<br/>
signature on your posts to direct people to it. It&#39;s like opening up another<br/>
folder on a message board. That way people who want to discuss politics can<br/>
do so. Those who don&#39;t want to won&#39;t have to spend more time than they<br/>
perhaps already are deleting stuff they don&#39;t find useful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574582953">I&#39;ve learned something with this whole thread.  I sometimes skim <br/>
posts, but what I&#39;ve read from Ned&#39;s posts, I agreed with.  <br/>
<br/>
What I learned is that not all unschoolers agree with the concept at <br/>
www.sepschool.org!!!  I must say that I was/still am thoroughly <br/>
shocked to learn that not all unschoolers agree with it.  I never <br/>
thought that it would be an issue that would be debatable on an <br/>
unschooling list.  I even find it surprising that so many school-at-<br/>
homers don&#39;t support it, but I thought that was just because they <br/>
still have the school mentality of education being something that we <br/>
need to do to our children, therefore the gov&#39;t needs to make sure <br/>
that it&#39;s &quot;done&quot; to all children.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this to chide/rebuke/debate.  I&#39;m just sharing that I <br/>
had the perception that the majority of unschoolers would agree with <br/>
what Ned was saying and was surprised to find that wasn&#39;t the case. <br/>

keep ned here<br/>
<br/>
Why are you (general, not specific) choosing up sides?The protests are based<br/>
on the list purpose not on whether or not Ned is allowed to be here.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I learned is that not all unschoolers agree with the concept at<br/>
&gt;www.sepschool.org!!!  I must say that I was/still am thoroughly<br/>
&gt;shocked to learn that not all unschoolers agree with it.  I never<br/>
&gt;thought that it would be an issue that would be debatable on an<br/>
&gt;unschooling list.  I even find it surprising that so many school-at-<br/>
&gt;homers don&#39;t support it, but I thought that was just because they<br/>
&gt;still have the school mentality of education being something that we<br/>
&gt;need to do to our children, therefore the gov&#39;t needs to make sure<br/>
&gt;that it&#39;s &quot;done&quot; to all children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with the idea that the government should get out of <br/>
homeschoolers&#39; hair and just let us get on with our responsibility to help <br/>
our kids get educated.  What I don&#39;t agree with is that the state should <br/>
not be providing some sort of education, through taxes, to all those kids <br/>
who aren&#39;t ever going to be homeschooled for whatever reason.  That&#39;s part <br/>
of the libertarian philosophy, and I don&#39;t agree with a lot of libertarian <br/>
philosophy.  Does that help clear up at least *my* views?<br/>

<br/>
Anything is fine as long as someone doesn&#39;t turn the list into their own<br/>
private soap box and prevent the list from discussing unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Even the *occasional* Libertarian (or Greenie or Republican or) post would<br/>
spark some interesting discussion. :-)<br/>
