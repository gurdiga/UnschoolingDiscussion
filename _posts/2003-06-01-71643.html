 </span></blockquote>I bartended for a while, and a good one to try is (I&#39;ve heard it called both <br/>
of these) and Arizona Bulldog or a Phoenix Bulldog.  Make it like this:  In a <br/>
tall glass put a shot of Vodka, shot of Kahlua.  Fill the rest of the glass <br/>
with half milk, half coke.  Yum, tastes like a coke float.  <br/>

I agree with you.  Rarely drink and I don&#39;t even want to taste the alcohol.  <br/>
Although, an ice cold Amber Bock or Michelob light hits the spot once in a <br/>
great while...<br/>

Oooooo, I bartended for 7 years, and never heard of that!! (Of course, it&#39;s a <br/>
White Russian without the coke.) I&#39;ll have to try it some time. We&#39;re having <br/>
another banger 4th of July party, sounds like a good time to try it out!! <br/>
Thanks for the recipe!  Lara..........</div>
