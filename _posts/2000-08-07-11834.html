<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043100442">&lt;&lt;UnschoolinMy belief is that going to college<br/>
will be a thing of the past and not important at all.... Afterall reading a<br/>
book doesn&#39;t in anyway prepare you for the realities of life.  Life skills<br/>
and living are far more important in a job... Of course I also believe that<br/>
working for oneself is the only way to go in life and I know many of you<br/>
don&#39;t believe that, for whatever reason.  I think that now I live outside the<br/>
box I can really see, which I couldn&#39;t do before.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don&#39;t think college will become a thing of the past; I think it&#39;s here to stay. Also, most jobs do pay you more money if you have that college diploma, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
However, I want to recommend a REALLY GOOD book I read recently called SUCCESS WITHOUT COLLEGE by Linda Lee.  Amazon.com has it; check out the review at their site.<br/>

I think that&#39;s the point I&#39;m trying to make about being self-employed.... You <br/>
don&#39;t need a degree for that, but you do need life experience and that&#39;s <br/>
something I believe (IMHO) unschooling gives.<br/>
