<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584233430"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Recently my kids decided to raise dogs and have bought breeding &gt;stock<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and have puppies that need constant care. <br/>
<br/>
After recovering from apoplectic shock at reading this, I read on and<br/>
then checked to see if anyone else had commented.  No one else did, so I<br/>
will.  I do not know where you are located, but in the U.S. there is a<br/>
serious pet overpopulation problem. Millions of cats and dogs (that<br/>
includes puppies and kittens) are put to sleep EACH DAY because there are<br/>
not enough PERMANENT homes for them. I do not know if Canada or Britain<br/>
are in much better shape.  There is not a huge market for mixed breed or<br/>
badly bred pure bred dogs.  Dog breeding is something of a science and<br/>
love that should only be undertaken after much experience and research. <br/>
Also, a responsible breeder should be concerned about the life of their<br/>
&quot;stock&quot; and their offspring from the cradle to the grave, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And the dog thing was their idea not mine. I do help out but it is <br/>
&gt; their business. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Any dog breeder or animal shelter will tell you that as the adult in the<br/>
house, the dog is ultimately the adults responsibility.  These are living<br/>
creatures, not a rock collection.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the kids are reading dog books aloud, learning how to ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something that should have been done BEFORE the dogs or puppies<br/>
arrival.  Along with genetics and numerous contacts with current breeders<br/>
since you are planning to breed.<br/>
<br/>
If teaching children responsibility, maybe they should go to the local<br/>
shelter or pound and volunteer - it will help them find out how and why<br/>
many animals end up there.  To help them learn the miracle of birth and<br/>
life, the shelter/pound can also show you the miracle, or rather, tragedy<br/>
of death of many wonderful creatures who want nothing more then to be<br/>
loved THEIR ENTIRE LIFE.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry if I am being rude.  This issue is very dear to me.  I am<br/>
shaking as I write this.  Some years ago I was employed at the Chicago of<br/>
the Humane Society and was present for the death of many animals.  Most<br/>
were loving, wonderful dogs and cats of all breeds, mixes and ages. <br/>
Their only sin was that they existed past the point that there owner<br/>
cared and the shelter had space.  Animal welfare is a concern I will have<br/>
until my death because of that experience, and one I hope to pass on to<br/>
my children.  PLEASE check into neutering and spaying your dogs offspring<br/>
and finding responsible homes for any puppies you place.  Your dog may<br/>
have a litter of 8 puppies.  Even if you place each of those 8 puppies,<br/>
each of them could have a litter of 8 puppies and so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367013128">Gee, maybe you should ask us more about what we are doing instead of <br/>
attacking us. Our pets, not breeding stock, are neutered. It would seem <br/>
rather silly to neuter our breeding stock now wouldn&#39;t it. <br/>
<br/>
It is a shame that too many animals are killed whether it is a no longer <br/>
wanted pet, an unwanted litter of kittens, or beef cattle. I understand where <br/>
you are coming from but maybe you should be clear on your facts before you <br/>
start telling us what to do.<br/>
<br/>
First off my children are 17 to 11 yrs in age. They are not small children <br/>
who have no idea what they are getting into. They know so much about animals, <br/>
including dogs, that it amazes me. They are not the idiots that you are <br/>
portraying them to be. I did not have my children start raising animals to <br/>
teach them responsibility. I agreed to go along with them and help them. In <br/>
other words, I support their dreams and ambitions. I really do not appreciate <br/>
you telling me that we are not smart enough to understand the science of <br/>
breeding. I cannot believe that you think we would actually be breeding mixed <br/>
breeds, give us some credit. My kids have a great love for animals. That is <br/>
why they exercise and train their animals daily and would never leave them in <br/>
little cages like some. They have been training dogs now for several years, <br/>
using our pets as their subjects. And may I say that I am amazed at what <br/>
those dogs can learn to do. Two of my children are very interested in raising <br/>
and training dogs for the disabled and are at the moment waiting for some <br/>
information we ordered about doing this. It is their dream to raise dogs for <br/>
the disabled. In case you did not know there is a big shortage of dogs <br/>
trained in this field. <br/>
<br/>
If you are really wanting to get rid of all dog breeders then do it. Go for <br/>
it, write your congress or whatever, do what it takes, if that is your <br/>
desire. Be passionate about it and fight to do away with dogs as pets. Do <br/>
what you think is best. Make a stand. Exactly what will happen to the <br/>
existence of dogs if it becomes illegal to breed them is a thought. After all <br/>
it sounded like you are against the breeding of all dogs not just the ones <br/>
that are allowed to have unwanted pups. Usually dog breeders do not have <br/>
unwanted pups. <br/>
<br/>
I call the pups we have now breeding stock because they are pure breed dogs <br/>
that we do plan to breed someday. That does not mean that they are not loved, <br/>
respected, given attention to, and apart of this family. We never plan to <br/>
become a large breeder with hundreds of dogs. <br/>
<br/>
Since we live 60 miles form the local animal shelter the kids will not be <br/>
volunteering there anytime soon but you may be interested in knowing that our <br/>
pets did come from that pound. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Any dog breeder or animal shelter will tell you that as the adult in the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>house, the dog is ultimately the adults responsibility.  These are living<br/>
creatures, not a rock collection. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Guess they should try raising responsible children. I am insulted that you <br/>
think I or my children are not intelligent to know that animals take more <br/>
care than rocks. You are lumping me in with people who drop their dogs <br/>
(animals) off at shelters to be killed. I do not, and will not. Maybe instead <br/>
of working at the shelter, watching animals be put to sleep you should have <br/>
been involved in finding ways for low income people to get their pets <br/>
neutered. It is an expense that many find hard to afford.<br/>
<br/>
I have a big problem with way animals are raised for butcher. Not the small <br/>
farmer but the big industry of beef, pork, and etc., the meat that finds its <br/>
way to your store shelves. I will not eat it because I refuse to support it. <br/>
But I am not going to jump down your throat if you choose to eat meat. It is <br/>
your choice. You are blaming me and dog breeders for the way people cruely <br/>
throw away their pets or let them breed unresponsibly. Put the blame where it <br/>
is due, on the pet owner. Just how is a pet breeder suppose to know if a <br/>
perspective buyer is going to take care of their pets. Put the blame where it <br/>
belongs. Make it harder to dumo pets, but put the blame where due. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, you were rude. <br/>
<br/>
Know us before you condemn us. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341492182">Whoa, I missed that post!  Shelley, I am in complete agreement with you!<br/>
Raising dogs is NOT a child&#39;s business.<br/>
<br/>
If they wanted to &quot;raise&quot; a puppy, then they could have contacted 4-H, Guide<br/>
Dogs for the Blind or Canine Companions and done something useful instead of<br/>
adding to the pet population problem.<br/>
<br/>
No one should &quot;decide&quot; to raise dogs without knowing a whole lot about<br/>
genetics, the particular breed in question, showing, training and health<br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
And, as a former breeder of show dogs and stockdogs, I seriously doubt that<br/>
any children had the $1000 minimum it takes to actually buy breeding stock<br/>
and not just puppy mill stock which just perpetuates the problems.<br/>
<br/>
Again, no offense but thousands upon thousands of dogs, cats, puppies and<br/>
kittens are put to sleep every year and that doesn&#39;t even begin to count the<br/>
ones that are dumped and left to fend for themselves (spell that starve to<br/>
death)!<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, who hates the whole &quot;miracle of birth&quot; excuse that ultimately places<br/>
more animals in shelters to be put to death!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914920988">We use to do rescue but are so far off the beaten path now that the beasties<br/>
of our fav breeds just aren&#39;t being dumped in this area.  Which is a good<br/>
thing &lt;g&gt; but we kept the last rescue dog and he is still with us with all<br/>
his quirks.  We&#39;re not sure how old he is but he is at least 12.  He was the<br/>
result of all the bad things that happen.  He is obviously from show stock<br/>
but in Keeshonds you can&#39;t have what are called &quot;dirty&quot; feet and he does.<br/>
Who ever bought him never socialised him and he would appear to have been<br/>
locked up in a small backyard for at least 2 years without any company.  He<br/>
was supposedly 2 but was in actuality between 4 and 6 and had never been on<br/>
a leash.  It is sad what happens when folks don&#39;t realise the amount of work<br/>
that goes into caring for a long haired breed.<br/>
<br/>
We always screened buyers and made sure they knew exactly what they were<br/>
getting into.  It is too easy for folks to buy something &quot;cute&quot; and then get<br/>
tired of it when it grows up.  It is like what happened when 101 Dalmations<br/>
came out, literally thousands of Dalmations ended up in shelters.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear you will be doing Ridgeback rescue as they have a special<br/>
personality that requires special people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468484888">Perhaps you can explain why it is that when this topics comes up someone<br/>
always jumps in with the same or similar statement to the one you just<br/>
voiced.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt, just to play devil&#39;s advocate here, that too many humans<br/>
suffer more than the animal that is put alive into a closed chamber that<br/>
then has all the oxygen slowly removed from it.<br/>
<br/>
Using an animal as an educational experience for children would, indeed,<br/>
seem to fall under the category of unschooling, or homeschooling or even<br/>
public schooling, for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
To compare a discussion of the rights and wrongs of puppy mills and backyard<br/>
breeders and the resulting wholesale slaughter, not euthenasia (definately<br/>
not euthenasia), of thousands of animals each year with the supposed<br/>
pro-life tirades is a bit of a stretch.  As far as that goes, I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
that homeschoolers have been singled out to be on the receiving end of<br/>
pro-life tirades.<br/>
<br/>
Are you perhaps implying that those of us who are anti-puppy mills are also<br/>
pro-lifers that &quot;pooh pooh&quot; child abuse issues?  You really aren&#39;t to<br/>
terribly clear and where you were going with this other than it was clearly<br/>
a rant was clear either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031651990">I am somewhat confused by your post.  I live in northern Illinois and <br/>
we have several no-kill shelters here and there is a demand for <br/>
puppies, kittens and previously owned pets.  As much as putting <br/>
animals in gas chambers is an upsetting and unpleasant thought, I&#39;m <br/>
not sure how it really ties into &quot;pro-life&quot; issues.  My understanding <br/>
of &quot;pro-life&quot; has to do with humans from conception to death, not <br/>
with animals.  I will say that I firmly believe there is quite a <br/>
distinction between humans and animals.<br/>
<br/>
I find that pro-lifers aren&#39;t the ones cramming &quot;choice&quot; down other <br/>
people&#39;s throats and are not the ones who falsely make claims about <br/>
how &quot;choice&quot; helps humanity.  It seems that &quot;pro-choicers&quot; have that <br/>
market covered.  More confusion sets in upon reading, <br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are children suffering WAY more than euthenized pets are.  <br/>
They suffer for years and YEARS, past the natural lifespan of a dog, <br/>
and yet the argument that they can have an entirely horrible life of <br/>
abuse and deprivation is pooh-poohed by right-wing Christians in <br/>
comfortable homes who don&#39;t let their children associate with the <br/>
very people whose reproductive rights they want to control.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Am I to understand that children who are to be born into poverty, <br/>
abuse or inhuman conditions should be terminated before birth?  Or <br/>
that human suffering would be under control if &quot;pro-choice&quot; issues <br/>
and &quot;reproductive rights&quot; were everyone&#39;s belief?  What about people <br/>
who willingly and lovingly bring their children into the world only <br/>
to find that their lives change drastically over time?  Examples of <br/>
this would be job loss & homelessness; or sickness that creates <br/>
poverty for the family; or a divorced woman who takes up with a <br/>
boyfriend only to find that he has beaten, raped and killed her <br/>
child?  The list can go on and on.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of &quot;reproductive rights they want to control&quot;, does <br/>
anybody realize that if you are pro-life, pro-natural family <br/>
planning, pro-God&#39;s will & the faith to do His will, that you are <br/>
under constant attack by &quot;pro-choicers&quot;?  From family, to doctors, to <br/>
other &quot;faithful&quot; people, to strangers or obviously others on this <br/>
unschooling list, we never hear the end of it.  That strikes me as <br/>
ironic since we don&#39;t go around shoving our beliefs down other <br/>
people&#39;s throats and we don&#39;t try to &quot;convince&quot; others to follow our <br/>
beliefs.  We do live out a testimony to our beliefs and find it <br/>
absolutely amazing that so many people are offended by our &quot;pro-life&quot; <br/>
attitude and have the nerve to try to shove their opinions down our <br/>
throats.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else out there that has had to endure the comments, <br/>
critisisms and assumptions made by others, while being pregnant and <br/>
wanting a large family, about sterilization, too many kids, college, <br/>
etc.?  Just wondering...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355443226">I&#39;m sure that it is known that the laws favor abortion in the U.S., <br/>
and that people who believed that abortion should be legal had to <br/>
push their beliefs onto others or in the public eye to get the laws <br/>
changed in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also sure that reasonable people, regardless of your belief on <br/>
the subject, know that most people who respect life do not protest in <br/>
a violent manner.  Unfortunately, no matter what cause is being taken <br/>
up by the people, there are some radicals.  This is true with women&#39;s <br/>
rights, minority&#39;s rights, government protestors, as well as people <br/>
on both sides of abortion.  What constitutes violence is obviously an <br/>
opinion here since photos of tiny feet or movies depicting the <br/>
reality of what abortion is have to come from somewhere.  In my <br/>
opinion, a violent act had to take place in order for there to be <br/>
mutilated body parts.  Do people really want to see these images?  I <br/>
personally don&#39;t, but that doesn&#39;t hide the fact that these acts are <br/>
taking place and we call it &quot;abortion&quot; and it&#39;s supposed to be o.k.<br/>
<br/>
Since I was responding to a comment made, &quot;...that they can have an <br/>
entirely horrible life of abuse and deprivation is pooh-poohed by <br/>
right-wing Christians in comfortable homes who don&#39;t let their <br/>
children associate with the very people whose reproductive rights <br/>
they want to control.&quot;, I&#39;m wondering why it is alright to voice this <br/>
strong and not necessarily accurate view, yet it seems so offensive <br/>
to some that my view is pro-life.  Did I place judgement or call &quot;pro-<br/>
choicers&quot; anything but that?  Am I responding to left-wing Atheists?  <br/>
Did I tell anyone that their opinion is &quot;the lamest bunch of nonsense <br/>
I&#39;ve seen in a long time.&quot;?<br/>

hypocrital of you.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
And rights?  Someone felt that they had the &quot;right&quot; to label and make <br/>
clear their &quot;pro-choice&quot; beliefs, whether I wanted to read it or <br/>
not.  But that&#39;s not shoving something down some of our throats?  I <br/>
do believe that we all have the &quot;right&quot; to our opinion and free-will, <br/>
whether you &quot;prescribe to the rules of my God&quot; or not.  Opinion and <br/>
free-will were expressed in the original post regarding abortion, yet <br/>
this is not unfair or hypocritical of that person.  I do not <br/>
understand how that can be.<br/>
     <br/>
I&#39;d also like to say that my original intention was not to offend the <br/>
author or the other users on this site.  I see that some of you have <br/>
no problem responding to this with the intention to offend.  I also <br/>
know that your beliefs certainly won&#39;t be changed by my posts.<br/>
<br/>
So, if my husband and I want to have several children, it&#39;s supposed <br/>
to be o.k. for everyone to share with us their opinions regarding <br/>
sterilization, birth control and abortion, yet we are not supposed to <br/>
share our belief in procreation?  Again, I do not understand how that <br/>
can be.<br/>
<br/>
It does sadden me to see how compassionate people can be toward the <br/>
animals killed daily in our country, but that same compassion does <br/>
not seem to spill over to the humans killed daily in our country.<br/>

Personally I just think some people are thoughtless, and therefore often<br/>
offend others, whether they intend to or not.  I don&#39;t think the people who<br/>
question your family size are really coming from a pro-choice stance, I<br/>
think they&#39;re just obnoxious people who probably think everyone should be<br/>
just like them.  I face the same criticism, but in reverse, we have one<br/>
child, and we have no plans for more.  I am always amazed by the nerve of<br/>
people who tell us how unfair we are, how selfish we are not to provide our<br/>
son with his own little sibling playmate.  I refuse to explain to any of<br/>
them why we have an only child, there is no way to win this conversation,<br/>
just as there is no way to win an argument on abortion.  These are issues<br/>
that people have already made up their minds on, and too often there is no<br/>
tolerance nor understanding of  anyone who may have a different opinion<br/>
(usually due to having a different life experience).  So congratulations on<br/>
the new baby, and  I wish you & your family continued joy & happiness.<br/>

BTW-  I am non-religious, with deeply held spiritual beliefs.  I am<br/>
adamantly pro-choice.  I use natural family planning.  My pregnancy was<br/>
unplanned, and seemingly inconvenient- I took it as a profound gift, and I<br/>
never once considered any other option than giving birth, I never had an<br/>
ultrasound even though I was in my late 30&#39;s at the time- I have never had<br/>
such a sense of &#39;faith&#39; as I did with my pregnancy.  I go by my intuition.<br/>
I understand that other people are guided (or not) by their own intuition,<br/>
or beliefs.  I try my best not to judge the choices that other people<br/>
make...... Just to explain where I&#39;m coming from.  (I also understand that<br/>
many people think I&#39;m just flaky, that&#39;s ok, too.)</div>
