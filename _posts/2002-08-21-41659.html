<br/>
Maybe Winnie the Pooh, but note to everybody here:<br/>
<br/>
In movies they use slang and idioms, and so not every phrase everyone uses <br/>
came from a movie first.  The other day I used a variation on a phrase which <br/>
I&#39;d never seen or heard used in that exact variation, and people were sure it <br/>
was from a movie.  <br/>
<br/>
Some quotes do come from movies, but many more movies use everyday phrases.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Who? What?&quot; and variations thereon are hundreds of years older than movies <br/>
are. <br/>
<br/>
But in the Disney Winnie the Pooh (and maybe in the book, I don&#39;t have mine <br/>
anymore) in the &quot;woozles&quot; scene there&#39;s a bit like that, maybe.<br/>
