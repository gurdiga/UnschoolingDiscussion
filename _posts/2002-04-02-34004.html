<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249715956">Hello!!  We are just starting out with our homeschooling.  Our kids are<br/>
5 and 2 so we are going very slow.  For the most part we are not getting<br/>
any flack from friends and relatives- most are supportive. However,  a<br/>
couple people are bringing up the &quot;kids have to learn there is a time to<br/>
do things...can&#39;t just do what you want all day.&quot; type of thinking.  I<br/>
guess they believe there should be time set for waking, etc.. I respect<br/>
their opinions but in my heart believe this may be a mindset pushed on<br/>
us from greater society.  Just wondering what your take on this is and<br/>
how you handle matters like this one.  Thanks for your help!  Sharon</div>

I&#39;ve pondered this one often.  My kidlets have learned that if someone <br/>
else is waiting for you, it is important to be on time but that <br/>
artificial time constraints are not important.  <br/>
<br/>
In the bigger picture, I think this is part of the downfall of our <br/>
society.  We are loosing our creative edge and things are going to <br/>
stagnate if we don&#39;t do something about it.  People who invent things <br/>
and create things usually don&#39;t fit the 9 to 5 workday mold.  So <br/>
training all of our children from age five to fit that mold has to be <br/>
affecting creativity somehow!<br/>

&lt;&lt;However,  a<br/>
couple people are bringing up the &quot;kids have to learn there is a time to<br/>

You reminded me of a movie we watched the other day where the father says to his son, &quot;you are an adult now, it&#39;s time to go and live your life&quot;  - I thought to myself, &quot;who&#39;s life was it before 18?&quot; LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I definitely think this is a mindset that has been pushed and that in general kids sleep when they are tired, eat when they are hungry, and learn what they need and want to know. I would ask these friends if they would want a warden coming in their rooms at 6 am saying that they need to wake up, just because we all need to wake up at 6 am... (well maybe that is to harsh)<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet you,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just because they&#39;re going to have to do something when they&#39;re all grown <br/>
up, we have to make them do it when they&#39;re really little?  I just hate <br/>
that philosophy.  I remember when I was in school and girls weren&#39;t allowed <br/>
to wear pants.  The rationale was that we wouldn&#39;t be able to wear them to <br/>
work in an office when we grew up, so we had to get used to it.  Stupid!<br/>
<br/>
My son generally goes to bed quite late and sleeps till almost <br/>
noon.  That&#39;s the schedule he prefers right now.  But when he works, he has <br/>
no trouble going to bed much earlier and getting up on time with no <br/>
help.  They&#39;re quite capable of doing the things they need to do when they <br/>
need to do them.<br/>

them,  think about it,  do you feed an infant solid foods &#39;cause he or she<br/>
is gonna hafta know how to chew one day?   Do you think a toddler should<br/>
speak with words and sentences &#39;cause she&#39;s gonna hafta speak when she&#39;s<br/>
older?  Do you give them the car keys &#39;cause they&#39;re gonna hafta drive one<br/>
day?<br/>
Grrrrrrrrrrr!<br/>
