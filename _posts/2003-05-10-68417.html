&lt;&lt; I am. . . and it is nothing like what people keep warning me about. I <br/>
<br/>
doubt rebellion can happen in a real unschooling environmnet, at <br/>
<br/>
least not the kind of rebellion we read about in young people that go <br/>
<br/>
to school.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible-to-likely that people whose kids have been in school a long <br/>
time will never have the calm and clarity that always-unschooled kids can <br/>
have.  But there are other factors, certainly.  Genetics, parental patience <br/>
(and calm and clarity), step situations, trauma, grief...<br/>

*You are so right Sandra. We thought by taking our son out of school that he <br/>
would suddenly be this calm, happy kid. Wrong! Now he was always a good <br/>
natured kid at home and at school but when we took him out we then had all <br/>
that anger that he had bottled up for many years to deal with not to mention <br/>
the trauma of his accident and the situation he was in. Did he rebel against <br/>
us! It has been almost a year and it was not till this past month that we&#39;ve <br/>
seen major changes in him, thanks mostly to unschooling and some changes in <br/>
parenting. He&#39;s happy now with himself and with life. He truly is one of the <br/>
nicest boys to be around. And he to holds my hand when we go out, something <br/>
he has not done in years. I thought we&#39;d never get to where we are today <br/>
because of the amount of time he was in public school but it can happen but <br/>
it may not for some and that is sad. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436128095">&lt;&lt; From: &quot;jk_lenzmeier&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jk_lenzmeier@...">jk_lenzmeier@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t mind, can you say what kind of parenting changes you <br/>
<br/>
made? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve made many changes in our parenting. For starters we realized that we <br/>
were wrong to keep our son in school just like we were raised. You had <br/>
problems, you got hurt, you stayed in school, to leave is to run away was how <br/>
we were raised. So, we took him out and decided to keep him out and that was <br/>
a big change for us as parents. We were very loving parents, played with our <br/>
son, gave him lots of hugs and I love you, never hit, never screamed BUT we <br/>
were very strict with our son and he never once really gave us any reason why <br/>
we had to be. He had a certain bed time, a required reading time, good grades <br/>
to keep, he would have to go to bed early for speaking his mind, he had <br/>
required chores, he had to dress in clothes that we thought looked nice, and <br/>
on and on. Our son never got onto any trouble in school, he was always <br/>
considered to be the quiet, shy nerd. He would never fight back when he was <br/>
getting beat up and he would never speak up to anyone in school. No wonder <br/>
why, because of us! It was quite easy for us to change but it was hard to <br/>
realize that we needed to change. I feel the most important change we have <br/>
made as parents is that we are more open and we talk more and share more. <br/>
That was hard especially for me coming from a family of no communication and <br/>
always being told (till this day) my opinions don&#39;t matter or that I am a <br/>
poor communicator, be quiet and so on. I wonder why. All my life I&#39;ve always <br/>
been scared to talk to anyone because of what they may think. Now, I talk <br/>
with my son more than before but with an open mind and a big heart and he is <br/>
soaking it up so much sometimes I swear I see smoke coming from his mouth!  <br/>
We also now take the time to listen to him even when we&#39;re busy. Normally it <br/>
would be wait till later, we no longer put him off, he does come first. One <br/>
change I have not been able to master would be the guilt I feel everyday <br/>
looking at him. I can&#39;t have anymore children, I just lost a child on <br/>
Christmas, and Chris is our only one. I wish I would have unschooled him long <br/>
ago, I wish I didn&#39;t walk in my parents footsteps, something I swore when I <br/>
left home at 15 years old I would never do. I wish I can turn back time but I <br/>
can&#39;t, I wish I could have gave him a better childhood than I had but it&#39;s <br/>
too late. These feelings I can&#39;t change or maybe I can&#39;t let go of, something <br/>
I hope someday I can change, that and the embarrassment of who I used to be.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you told your ds all of this?<br/>
I think that helps.  My older two got the brunt of my ignorance.  <br/>
They were 7 and 4 before I started coming around and learning about <br/>
respectful parenting.  I told my son Sam last year that I wanted to <br/>
apologize for being not so nice to him, as a toddler, some of the <br/>
time. (forced naps, time outs, hurting him with a spank or grab of <br/>
the arm...all kinds of miserable things).  I needed to tell him <br/>
because I had been worse to him than my dd, who didn&#39;t push my <br/>
buttons quite as much.  <br/>
Sam and I were both stubborn and butted heads quite often.  We still <br/>
argued and didn&#39;t see eye to eye quite a bit, but we had come a long <br/>
way towards respecting each other and I was really starting to feel <br/>
good about the progress I had made in being more patient and <br/>
respectful of him.  He died on Jan. 19 of this year.  He fell through <br/>
the ice on a lagoon at a park while there with another family. One of <br/>
the things that helps me cope, is remebering how much I strived to <br/>
make our relationship better and how I knew, he knew how much I love <br/>
him, because of it.  I also feel very fortunate to have found <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
Sam was 8 (almost 9), and he spent his day finding his joy.  No time <br/>
wasted in school all day.  No time wasted doing meaningless <br/>
worksheets to make me feel better.  Infact, not having to think about <br/>
schooling him gave us all the more time to work on being together <br/>
peacefully.  Everyone who knew him described him as joyful.  He <br/>
relished life (sometimes with more energy than I could handle).<br/>
I&#39;ll always regret the times I could have been a WAY better mom with <br/>
him, but I try to avoid remorse because I know I saw the error of my <br/>
ways and strived to do better.  That&#39;s all we can ask of ourselves.  <br/>
Energy spent feeling guilty is not going to help you to be the best <br/>
of you.  Your son deserves that.  <br/>
I know my kids do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318740117">Wow, that was powerful.  I&#39;m so sorry for your loss, but please don&#39;t feel <br/>
guilty.  Kids somehow see through our faults and love us.  And the fact that <br/>
you changed says a lot; most people are too set in their ways to even <br/>
consider that there may be a different way of doing things.  You have <br/>
reminded me how important life is, how disrupting public school is in the <br/>
life of a family, and why we choose to take on the sometimes difficult but <br/>
always rewarding *job* of homeschooling.  I thank you for that.<br/>
Again, I&#39;m sorry about Sam.  You both sound awesome.<br/>

<br/>
Who you used to be is the same as Who You Are NOW. In fact, without <br/>

It&#39;s just your behaviors that are different. Your understanding of <br/>
the world is different. You&#39;re working from a different awareness and <br/>
with a new set of personal tools. That&#39;s good. That&#39;s growth. No need <br/>
to be embarrassed. Just another step along the path. Another <br/>
opportunity to make this next step even better. <br/>

Who you used to be is the same as Who You Are NOW. In fact, without <br/>
those past experiences, could you really be exactly Who You Are now? <br/>
It&#39;s just your behaviors that are different. Your understanding of <br/>
the world is different. You&#39;re working from a different awareness and <br/>
with a new set of personal tools. That&#39;s good. That&#39;s growth. No need <br/>
to be embarrassed. Just another step along the path. Another <br/>
opportunity to make this next step even better. <br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
