<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. I talk about it at some length in my essay &quot;Hebetudinous&quot;, which <br/>
is in my new book (&quot;Homeschooling and the Voyage of Self-Discovery&quot;(, <br/>
especially in the footnotes. As it turns out, I think this essay is <br/>
currently on my site (www.skylarksings.com)<br/>
<br/>
But there are two &quot;origins&quot; -- the first predates the great <br/>
immigrant &quot;invasions&quot;, and goes back to Noah Webster. His whole idea <br/>
was to make English spelling something peculiarly &quot;American&quot;, <br/>
including getting rid of all those ridiculous silent &quot;e&quot;s, (as well <br/>
as the &quot;ou&quot;s.) He was, however, overtaken by pro-British sentiments <br/>
in the early-mid 19th century. <br/>
<br/>
Spelling (as I write in the essay) embodies a &quot;societal myth&quot; (true <br/>
or false is not important, just as long as we operate as if it is <br/>
true.) &quot;Spelling is a sign of intelligence: good spellers are ....., <br/>
poor spellers are ....&quot; We all know it is untrue, and then go about <br/>
operating as if it is. So I do think it useful if kids LEARN to spell <br/>
(or at least to understand the societal myth behind it), and <br/>
absolutely irrevelant as to whether anyone actually TEACHES it (I <br/>
think usually a waste of time.)</div>

<br/>
I thot he had died before done.  Canada seems top have suffered with his<br/>
N.A. spelling with our Loyal ties to Queen&#39;s English.  So now we have TWO<br/>
ways to spell &quot;sul-fer&quot; and two ways to pronounce &quot;laboratory.&quot;  Thus, I<br/>
grumble at him at times.<br/>

This one wrenched me around in my chair!  As an English major, I held this<br/>
snooty attitude until I started working with the disadvantaged people I saw<br/>
when helping inventors commercialize their inventions.  Couldn&#39;t<br/>
write/read/spell, but could conceive of products for humanity.  That&#39;s not a<br/>
dumby!<br/>
So I gave it a rest, but this essay put it to bed!<br/>
