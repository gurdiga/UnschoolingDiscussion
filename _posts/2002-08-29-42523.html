<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959608890">Catholicism emphasizes the role of the parent as first teacher,<br/>
but the intersection of religious education and homeschooling is<br/>
a bit complicated.  I read on a blog yesterday as good an<br/>
explanation as is likely to be found.  Given that Blogspot&#39;s<br/>
perma links are notoriously unstable, I have cut and pasted the<br/>
whole thing, followed by the &quot;perma link&quot; below - tedious going<br/>
unless you are really interested, but as a Catholic I am, LOL:<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling and Canon Law<br/>
<br/>
I got another email today inquiring about homeschooling, canon<br/>
law, diocesan guidelines, the rights of parents, and the ongoing<br/>
feud between CHSNA and NACHE/TORCH. Originally, I stayed out of<br/>
this debate since I know people on both sides and I also know how<br/>
emotional and intense these debates can become. Also, my position<br/>
fell somewhere in the middle of that advocated by each group, and<br/>
so neither side would have been satisfied with my response. For<br/>
the past two years I continued to receive one or two emails or<br/>
phone calls a week from average homeschooling parents who are<br/>
confused about all the issues involved. As much as I would like<br/>
to stay out of it and allow the two groups to work out their own<br/>
problems, now that children are being denied the sacraments I<br/>
feel I must state something. So I finally sat down, put<br/>
everything into writing, and emailed CHSNA and NACHE the results.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if either group will respond, but if any of my<br/>
readers are part of a homeschooling group, please feel free to<br/>
reproduce and distribute the following. All I ask is that you if<br/>
you reprint it in your newsletter, please send me a copy. My<br/>
address is over in the column to the right side.....<br/>

Homeschooling Guidelines and<br/>
Sacramental Preparation<br/>
<br/>
Pete Vere, JCL<br/>
<br/>
It is with a fair amount of trepidation that I wander into this<br/>
debate. As both a licensed canonist and a student currently<br/>
working towards a Pontifical Diploma in Catechesis, I understand<br/>
the need for diocesan guidelines with regards to homeschooling<br/>
and catechesis. Yet I am also a Catholic parent, entrusted with<br/>
my child&#39;s Catholic education. My wife and I both consider<br/>
homeschooling a legitimate option. Thus my opinion concerning<br/>
this growing dispute will likely draw a fair amount of criticism<br/>
from all sides - bishops, catechists, homeschooling parents and<br/>
even many canonists. Yet if I have laid aside my initial<br/>
hesitation and wandered into the debate, it is because children<br/>
are the ones whose rights to the sacraments are threatened, and<br/>
someone must defend their rights to the sacraments.<br/>
<br/>
To summarize a rapidly growing situation, many Catholic parents<br/>
opt for homeschooling after coming across doctrinal deficiencies<br/>
in their children&#39;s catechesis. Granted, this is not the only<br/>
reason parents homeschool their children, but the reason is not<br/>
uncommon either. In response to this growing trend, the<br/>
catechetical establishment, concerned with parents using<br/>
homeschooling to circumvent the system, pressure bishops and<br/>
pastors to impose homeschooling guidelines. In short, the<br/>
catechetical establishment wishes to regain control over the<br/>
situation, perceiving homeschooling parents as fundamentalists.<br/>
Homeschooling parents resist the implementation of such<br/>
guidelines, resulting in pastors withholding the sacraments, and<br/>
everything simply degenerates from there. Parents assert their<br/>
rights as primary educators and pastors assert their right to<br/>
govern the faithful. Unfortunately, the rights most likely to<br/>
fall by the wayside are those over whom this battle is being<br/>
fought, namely homeschooled children. Caught in the middle of<br/>
this catechetical dispute, some homeschooled children now<br/>
unjustly find themselves functionally excommunicated from the<br/>
Church&#39;s sacramental life.<br/>
<br/>
Children are victimized because the three fundamental canonical<br/>
issues pertaining to this dispute have not clearly been<br/>
distinguished from the outset. The first issue concerns the right<br/>
of a diocesan Bishop to oversee catechesis within his diocese,<br/>
including that of homeschooled children, and impose certain<br/>
guidelines if he feels it necessary. The second concerns the<br/>
objection of parents to catechetical programs they perceive as<br/>
doctrinally deficient. And the third issue is the right of<br/>
homeschooled children, like all other Catholic children, to the<br/>
administration of the sacraments, particularly the Sacraments of<br/>
Initiation (Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Eucharist.) I will<br/>
treat each issue separately in the order they were raised.<br/>
<br/>
The Bishop&#39;s Right to Impose Guidelines<br/>
<br/>
Beginning with the right of the competent ecclesiastical<br/>
authority to oversee the catechesis of homeschooled children, as<br/>
well as impose certain guidelines, this right is implicit within<br/>
Canon 774:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Canon 774 §1 The care for catechesis, under the direction of<br/>
lawful ecclesiastical authority, extends to all members of the<br/>
Church, to each according to his or her role.<br/>
&quot;§2 Before all others, parents are bound to form their children,<br/>
by word and example, in faith and in christian living. The same<br/>
obligation binds godparents and those who take the place of<br/>
parents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now canon 774, §2 acknowledges both the natural right and the<br/>
natural obligation of parents as primary religious educators of<br/>
their children. Nevertheless, in accordance with canon 17,<br/>
&quot;Ecclesiastical laws are to be understood in with the proper<br/>
meaning of the words considered in their text and context.&quot; The<br/>
context of canon 774&#39;s second paragraph is clear, in that the<br/>
first paragraph acknowledges the obligation of the Church&#39;s<br/>
lawful ecclesiastical authority to direct catechetical efforts.<br/>
In short, as Catholics we believe Christ established a visible<br/>
hierarchy within His Church, with the power to sanctify, to teach<br/>
and to govern in His name. Therefore, the role of the diocesan<br/>
Bishop and the parochial pastor, as it pertains to religious<br/>
education, can neither be ignored nor completely minimized.<br/>
<br/>
This must be kept in mind by homeschooling parents. In outlining<br/>
the rights and obligations of the faithful vis-à-vis home<br/>
religious education, one must consider canon 223 §3 which states:<br/>
&quot;in the interest of the common good, ecclesiastical authority has<br/>
competence to regulate the exercise of the rights, which belong<br/>
to the Christian faithful.&quot; In short, no right within the Code of<br/>
Canon Law is absolute. While parents have the right to choose<br/>
catechetical resources approved by the Church, the diocesan<br/>
Bishop retains the right to impose certain catechetical<br/>
requirements. If parents are the primary catechists, then canon<br/>
780 which obliges local Ordinaries &quot;to ensure that catechists are<br/>
duly trained to carry out their office properly&quot; applies to<br/>
parents as well.<br/>
<br/>
The Parent&#39;s Right to Sound Catechesis<br/>
<br/>
With respect to the second issue, I frequently come across<br/>
situations where parents express concern over perceived doctrinal<br/>
deficiencies in their children&#39;s catechesis. In those situations<br/>
where I agree with the concerns of the parents, I advise parents<br/>
to approach their pastors. As canon 212 §2 maintains, &quot;Christ&#39;s<br/>
faithful are at liberty to make known their needs, especially<br/>
their spiritual needs, and their wishes to the Pastors of the<br/>
Church.&quot; If Bishops and pastors are slow to respond to the needs<br/>
of the parents, or if they outright dismiss the well-founded<br/>
concerns of the parents, an injustice ensues.<br/>
<br/>
Canon 213 clearly states: &quot;Christ&#39;s faithful have the right to be<br/>
assisted by their Pastors from the spiritual riches of the<br/>
Church, especially by the word of God and the sacraments.&quot; Unless<br/>
catechesis is merely something incidental to the Church, in which<br/>
case one wonders about the necessity of such strict guidelines,<br/>
the demand pastors assist parents in providing children with<br/>
doctrinally sound catechesis is not merely something optional<br/>
under canon law, but an actual right of the faithful. This right<br/>
is further clarified in canon 217 as follows: &quot;Since Christ&#39;s<br/>
faithful are called by baptism to lead a life in harmony with the<br/>
gospel teaching, they have the right to a Christian education,<br/>
which genuinely teaches them to strive for the maturity of the<br/>
human person and at the same time to know and live the mystery of<br/>
salvation.&quot; Doctrinally deficient catechesis denies Christ&#39;s<br/>
faithful their canonical right to a Christian education. Should<br/>
this situation persist after notification of the competent<br/>
ecclesiastical authority, in accordance with canon 221 §1,<br/>
&quot;Christ&#39;s faithful may lawfully vindicate and defend the rights<br/>
they enjoy in the Church, before the competent ecclesiastical<br/>
forum in accordance with the law.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Child&#39;s Right to the Sacraments<br/>
<br/>
Having resolved the issue of catechesis, namely the Bishop&#39;s<br/>
right to impose diocesan guidelines upon homeschooling parents,<br/>
as well as the parents&#39; right to expect doctrinally sound<br/>
catechesis for their children from their pastors, let us turn our<br/>
attention to the administration of the sacraments. Should the<br/>
administration of the sacraments, namely Confirmation and first<br/>
Holy Communion, be strictly tied to a child&#39;s catechetical<br/>
achievement? The answer to this question is no. Christ instituted<br/>
the sacraments as the primary means of God&#39;s grace, not as some<br/>
sort of ecclesiastical graduation certificate after a lengthy and<br/>
rigorous catechetical boot-camp. This is not what is intended by<br/>
the expression &quot;Church Militant.&quot; Consequently, nobody earns the<br/>
right to partake of the sacraments, for none of us is worthy.<br/>
Rather, we partake of the sacraments through the merits of Jesus<br/>
Christ.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the current catechetical practice in many parts of<br/>
North America does not reflect the Church&#39;s theology in this<br/>
regard. This problem does not uniquely affect homeschooling<br/>
children; the problem is common to most Catholic children in the<br/>
United States and Canada, where the traditional order for<br/>
administering the Sacraments of Initiation is disrupted, and<br/>
Confirmation is often deferred by diocesan catechetical<br/>
requirements until adolescence. This is done because many within<br/>
the catechetical establishment advocate a theology of &quot;mature&quot;<br/>
faith, expecting teenagers to fulfill a lengthy and rigorous<br/>
catechetical process, complete various service projects, and<br/>
generally demonstrate an &quot;adult&quot; faith. While such goals are<br/>
worthy within the strict context of catechesis, historically and<br/>
theologically they had little to do with preparation for the<br/>
Sacrament of Confirmation until the onslaught of Jansenism. The<br/>
influence exerted by Jansenism over the catechetical preparation<br/>
of children for the Sacraments is well explained by Fr. John<br/>
Huels, a noted canonist and liturgical scholar, in his essay &quot;The<br/>
Age for Confirmation.&quot; The following excerpts are particularly<br/>
insightful:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Early in the twentieth century, Pope Pius X combated the<br/>
Jansenistic influence over pastoral practice and religious<br/>
education in many countries. This rigoristic spirituality held<br/>
that most people were unworthy to receive communion frequently<br/>
and that children had to prove themselves worthy for first holy<br/>
communion through an extended catechetical program up to the age<br/>
of ten, twelve, fourteen or older. The pope responded by<br/>
standardizing the age for the reception of first communion and<br/>
first penance at seven. Confirmation was still supposed to<br/>
precede first communion, but it became impossible everywhere for<br/>
the bishop to make it to each parish all the time before children<br/>
of seven received their first communion; so confirmation often<br/>
was administered out of sequence after the children had already<br/>
received the eucharist.<br/>
&quot;With the growing frequency of the postponement of confirmation<br/>
to after first communion, the spirit of Jansenism resurfaced in<br/>
pastoral practice and in religious education in the twentieth<br/>
century. It was not eucharist, the sacrament that completes<br/>
Christian initiation, but confirmation, the second sacrament,<br/>
which was said to require lengthy catechesis, &#39;mature&#39; faith and<br/>
other requirements of parish or catechetical policy before<br/>
children or adolescents could demonstrate their worthiness to<br/>
receive it.<br/>
&quot;All the while, this custom of delaying confirmation was contrary<br/>
to canon law; the 1917 code, canon 788, said that confirmation<br/>
should be delayed to about the age of seven but it could be given<br/>
earlier if an infant were in danger of death or the minister had<br/>
just and serious reasons for confirming soon. This contrary<br/>
practice of delaying confirmation beyond seven only became an<br/>
option in law in 1971, and this came about despite the views of<br/>
liturgical experts who had recommended to Pope Paul VI that there<br/>
be no change in the law.<br/>
&quot;As a result of studies uncovering the history of confirmation,<br/>
contemporary theologians have been critical of the<br/>
above-mentioned &#39;spiritual maturity&#39; theology and praxis of<br/>
confirmation. They argue not only that it does not correspond to<br/>
the origins of the sacrament but also that it ritually and<br/>
theologically demands too much of confirmation to the<br/>
diminishment of baptism and eucharist.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of where they otherwise fall on the ideological<br/>
spectrum, many canonists, myself included, agree with Fr. Huels&#39;<br/>
analysis of the above situation. Admittedly, canon law currently<br/>
permits a diocesan Bishop to extend the age at which Confirmation<br/>
may be administered, but this is merely a concession owing to<br/>
historical circumstance. It does not mean the age of confirmation<br/>
should be extended, and Fr. Huels presents strong arguments why<br/>
it should not. Furthermore, some catechists will argue Fr. Huels&#39;<br/>
s analysis merely concerns a broader issue, namely the overly<br/>
demanding catechetical requirements preceding administration of<br/>
Confirmation. I will not dispute this as the context in which Fr.<br/>
Huels writes. Nevertheless, his insights still apply within the<br/>
current homeschooling debate. After all, children do not forfeit<br/>
their rights within the Church - especially the right to receive<br/>
the sacraments in a timely order - simply because their parents<br/>
homeschool them.<br/>
<br/>
Now granted, some homeschooling parents hold a doctrinally<br/>
fundamentalist view of the Catholic faith that can become<br/>
unhealthy. When this occurs, the Church must remind parents that<br/>
obedience to one&#39;s lawful ecclesiastical superior is one of the<br/>
fundamental tenets of Catholicism. Nevertheless, the fault in<br/>
such instances belongs to the parents, and not to the children<br/>
who unfortunately bear the brunt of the resulting functional<br/>
excommunication from the sacraments. Moreover, the current<br/>
catechetical establishment is just as guilty of the charge of<br/>
rigorism, although in the area of process rather than doctrine.<br/>
For in insisting homeschooled children adhere to strict diocesan<br/>
standards before seeking admission to the sacraments, the<br/>
catechetical establishment ought to keep in mind the Jansenistic<br/>
roots of rigorous sacramental preparation, especially before<br/>
labeling homeschooling parents as fundamentalists.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25026878">That&#39;s interesting to me mostly because the catechism itself is a memorized <br/>
dialog.  Why can&#39;t a kid memorize it at home?  But it went beyond that at <br/>
some point, to the lengthy school-style explanations of what each answer <br/>
meant.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known families to be pressured to pay for parochial school or to work <br/>
there in exchange for their kids getting in, and the method of pressure is <br/>
that at the baptism they promised before God to see to their children&#39;s <br/>
religious education.  BUT that&#39;s when the only option seemed to be public <br/>
school.   But many people are probably stuck in that mindset because THEY had <br/>
to pay for it and their kids were told they should be grateful to go to <br/>
Catholic school instead of the dangerous &#39;other.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
This will be a whole new set of debates for sure!!  <br/>
<br/>
Does the Seton curriculum have a catechism unit?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726490850">The Catechism is just one very small part of catechesis - as you<br/>
allude to when you say &quot;it went beyond that at some point&quot;.  The<br/>
nature of Catholicism is that it fully embraces all of our<br/>
humanity and experience.  As such it is probably a prime example<br/>
of what is best taught by unschooling, because to confine it to<br/>
CCD and weekly Mass - or CYO or any other &quot;unit&quot; is to deny the<br/>
thing that animates it.  Then again, about 10% of the kids in our<br/>
parish are home school kids (according to the parish secretary)<br/>
and they cover the whole range of learning styles, including<br/>
probably somebody who is using Seton, though I don&#39;t know who.<br/>
