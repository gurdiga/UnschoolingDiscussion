&gt; &gt;Thanks for your great thoughts.... Wondering if we dare keep <br/>
&gt; &gt;M&Ms handy for snacking...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting to note, too, how individual physiologies &lt;hmmm....not sure <br/>
I&#39;m using that correctly&gt; affect eating habits when they pertain to &quot;junk <br/>
food.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;ve been watching my two daughters with their large stockpile of <br/>
Christmas candy....15 year old has behaved in her usual fashion re: <br/>
Halloween, Easter, etc.  She has eaten a few pieces on Christmas Day, and <br/>
then will occasionally nibble one or two pieces every other day. Much of it <br/>
is already looking old and weary. &lt;g&gt;  If she follows her usual pattern, the <br/>
majority of it will be stuffed in a plastic bag and left to grow stale for a <br/>
year, till it gets pitched in the trash....<br/>
<br/>
   Younger daughter (the one who&#39;s always craved sweets; she used to walk <br/>
around sucking on the plastic Honey Bear jar when a toddler!) dove into candy <br/>
as if it were manna from heaven (despite never having any restrictions on <br/>
food choices around here,  in our daily lives), had consumed easily HALF of <br/>
it in an orgy of sugar consumption within the first day, and ALL of it within <br/>
about four days.....she&#39;s moved on to other sweet pastures, already.<br/>
<br/>
    Her father eats sweets in the same fashion.  He&#39;s hypoglycemic, and <br/>
binges on occasion, when his blood sugar levels wrest control of his mind. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 Younger daughter exhibits the same reckless tendencies, often eating herself <br/>
into a manic high, or even--when she was smaller--THROWING UP from excess <br/>
chocolate intake. <br/>
<br/>
  This despite *precisely* the same food lifestyle, freedom of choice, and <br/>
nutritional offerings in the same household.  One daughter&#39;s physical make up <br/>
gives her a &quot;problem&quot; with sugar; the other does not. <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think one can attribute food behaviors  ALL to  child-rearing <br/>
practices. People clearly have different physical relationships with food, <br/>
too....My sister always has been able to subsist happily on a breakfast of <br/>
breadstuffs and caffeine (rolls and coffee, biscuits and tea, etc.).  I, on <br/>
the other hand, go into a complete nutritional nosedive unless I ingest <br/>
PROTEIN asap in the morning: headaches, the &quot;shakes&quot;, etc..  Now, when I <br/>
visit her, I make sure to bring some cheese sticks or hardboiled eggs to <br/>
supplement her breakfast offerings, as she still forgets our differing <br/>
nutritional needs sometimes.....I can understand that.  It&#39;s easy to mistake <br/>
one&#39;s OWN experience for that of others, too.  &quot;If a croissant and grapefruit <br/>
keep her perkin&#39; till lunchtime,&quot; why wouldn&#39;t it do the same for me?  ;-D<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This is interesting.  My mother tended to skimp on &quot;store-bought&quot; treats <br/>
(Cokes, candy) partly for nutritional reasons, but partly because we couldn&#39;t <br/>
afford them.  Although she made dessert or cookies a couple times a week, <br/>
there were plenty of days when NO traditional &quot;goodies&quot; lay around the house. <br/>
 Since I always preferred cheddar cheese or dill pickles or peanuts to candy <br/>
or Ding Dongs, anyway, this never bothered me....<br/>
<br/>
  Dh&#39;s mother always had candy and sweets about.  Dh bought popsicles at <br/>
school *with all his lunch money* (appalling for me to consider, who loved <br/>
her cafeteria food! ;-)  He had easy and open access to candy and refined <br/>
sugar products all his childhood.<br/>
<br/>
  So, who is the person with the sugar cravings?  Dh.  I can easily live <br/>
weeks without chocolate, doughnuts, etc. ....If he didn&#39;t buy them, I bet <br/>
they&#39;d rarely come into the house.  On the other hand, I need the occasional <br/>
&quot;chip&quot; or &quot;cheese spread and crackers&quot; perk, or I feel positively sad and <br/>
deprived. <br/>
<br/>
  Dh wonders if his physical addiction to sugary foods has something to do <br/>
with his mother&#39;s gestational diabetes, and his high birth <br/>
weight.....there&#39;ve been some studies corrolating this.   I&#39;m beginning to <br/>
wonder, myself.  Although I didn&#39;t have any detectable diabetes with second <br/>
daughter, she was several weeks &quot;late&quot; (as was my husband) and weighed close <br/>
to ten pounds at birth!  She was the BIGGEST baby in our small hospital the <br/>
entire month of December, in fact.  <br/>
