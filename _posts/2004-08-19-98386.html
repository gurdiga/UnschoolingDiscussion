<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636168528">Ok not really MY butt.  I couldn&#39;t resist.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in the south and &quot;butt&quot; was a fairly bad word.  Not a full cuss word just really rude, or so I thought.  I guess we said bottom, or hinny or tush.  Much later, engaged or recently married, I was visiting my folks.  I had, at some prior point, had discussions re the word &quot;butt&quot; and other politically correct things with my fiancï¿½/spouse.  Just in a casual &quot;this is how it was for me growing up way&quot; and cause he is totally comfortable with &quot;butt&quot; &lt;g&gt;.   In some story, my dad said the word butt like &quot;he fell on his butt&quot; or something similar.  Now maybe my memory was faulty.  Maybe, and more likely, my dad had mellowed with age.  It did, however, throw me for a loop.  My husband still occasionally ribs me about it.  It still bugs me a little, butt it is MY issue &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>
<br/>
I definitely have a worse reaction when the kids say something &quot;sucks&quot;.  I know it does not carry the same connotation for them, but I internally flinch.  And don&#39;t even get me going about the &quot;eat me&quot; line in Shrek.  Yikes!!<br/>
<br/>
I still have the occasional talk with the kids about &quot;oh my God&quot; cause that one still bothers my dad.<br/>
Unfortunately, words and phrases can become so much a habit that people don&#39;t even think about what they are saying.  How others might feel/react is the main reason I try to get them to pay attention to what they are saying sometimes.   <br/>
<br/>
Is there a help group for us poor saps from conservative homes?  <br/>

Counting down to the conference where I bet &quot;butt&quot; won&#39;t matter a bit.  <br/>

I think I heard that &quot;bottom&quot; is pretty nasty in England. Worse than &quot;butt.&quot;<br/>
More localized there, involving holes I think.<br/>
Not buttocks.<br/>

If you start talking about butts in Australia someone will probably hand you<br/>
a cigarette. The word to avoid there is &quot;fanny&quot; which refers to a different<br/>
area of female anatomy than the rear end.<br/>

<br/>
i feel compelled to clarify the texas version --<br/>
<br/>
the emphasis is on the &quot;be&quot; -- you&#39;d say *bee*hind. :)<br/>
<br/>
and, i don&#39;t know why, but we say &quot;insurance&quot; with the accent on the first syllable -- try it.  when you know the middle syllable should be accented, accenting the first syllable sounds way off!<br/>
<br/>
something about those first syllables for us texans . . .<br/>

It is fun and makes us giggle. Some of our school-at-homer (doh) friends would <br/>
be horrified. We also really laugh at the Big Butt song, but I am not sure <br/>
what would be rude up here in the frozen north.<br/>

Yes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good dialect, but definitely different.<br/>
It&#39;s more than an accent.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  None of that&#39;s nasty here. All perfectly acceptable. &quot;Ass&quot; is nearest to rude but there&#39;s some colourful language here so it is usually okay. When in doubt about &#39;ass&#39; here however, say the much prefferable &#39;arse&#39;. &quot;Asshole&quot; is definately rude but somehow, adding the r sound and making it &#39;arsehole&#39; makes it all okay. :)<br/>
