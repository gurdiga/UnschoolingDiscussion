<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117664960">Hi all,<br/>
I have been BUSY as of late... birthday party, and then a trip to visit<br/>
relatives and then just catching up on things....<br/>
(like the backlog of messages!!!!)(291new messages... and I am too curious<br/>
to just delete them all:-)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, thanks for the birthday tips.. it ended up going off well.  We<br/>
bought cheap clay pots which we had the kids (14 of them ranging in age from<br/>
3 to 12) paint and then take home fullid with , among other things seeds to<br/>
plant some flowers in the pots. They all ended up enjoying the pot-painting.<br/>
I learned so much at this party... one thing was how important the gift<br/>
opening part is... we did the gift opening relatively early on so it was<br/>
completely relaxed and there was lots of time to fully appreciate what each<br/>
child had brought.  The other main event was a treasure hunt.... and then a<br/>
little free time while wating for all the parents to show up.  For the<br/>
treasure hunt I made a detailed map of our house and yard, and then cut it<br/>
up into 6 pieces and wrote a rather complicated clue on each peice...  They<br/>
had to save all the clues to put together at the end to find the treasure on<br/>
the map.  (it was buried 2 feet under in the garden :-)<br/>
<br/>
WHen it was all over I felt like I had been run over by a mack truck... but<br/>
I think next time will not be so stressful.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;  Your post should have come with a disclaimer in Bold to the effect that<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt;  this is a &quot;typical&quot; day for your family it&#39;s not what you&#39;d be doing<br/>
every<br/>
&gt;  day and &quot;typically&quot; leads to exhaustion and a need for a restorative day.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;  envision some poor newbie mom out there who signed off the list convinced<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt;  just doesn&#39;t have the stamina to &quot;do unschooling.&quot;  :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even the &quot;off&quot; days seem like a lot when you sit down and think about what<br/>
&gt; you did.  Heck, just getting them both dressed and to the store was a<br/>
major<br/>
&gt; accomplishment today.  Some days are better than others -- whether we do<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; or not.<br/>
