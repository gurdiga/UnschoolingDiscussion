This is really called Into the West. The kids and I just watched it for the<br/>
4th or 5th time. Not only Gabriel Byrne, but Ellen Barkin too!<br/>

<br/>
Another good movie (IMHO) is &quot;Bobbie&#39;s Girl&quot; with Rachel Ward and Bernadette <br/>
Peters and Jonathan Silverman too. The two women are partners and run a pub <br/>
together called The Two Sisters in an Irish seaside village. Then Bobbie&#39;s <br/>
nephew&#39;s parents die and the women &quot;inherit&quot; him. Kind of an unschoolish movie, the <br/>
nephew is given freedom he has never had, including reading books and plays. <br/>
One of the best scenes is when Ward and Peters characters go to meet with the <br/>
boy&#39;s headmaster at his old school and he lectures them on what the child <br/>
needs and how he and his school can provide it better than them. Insinuating that <br/>
the child&#39;s father wanted him to grow up and be a man and how living with his <br/>
lesbian aunts would be detrimental to this goal. Ward&#39;s character has a thing <br/>
or two to say about that. &lt;g&gt; Great movie! It is a comedy/drama and one woman <br/>
goes through a health crisis so it gets emotional, regardless it is a <br/>
wonderful movie. Moly and I watch it every time it comes on Showtime.<br/>

notices it become DVD available, please try to remind me (or this whole list is <br/>
fine &lt;g&gt;).  Sounds good.<br/>

It is on DVD and VHS. VHS I know on Amazon, other sites have it on DVD. I <br/>
didn&#39;t check Showtime, where it was aired originally, but they might have it for <br/>
sale too. <br/>
