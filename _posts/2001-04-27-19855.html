<br/>
&quot;AGE-APPROPRIATE&quot; CURRICULAE<br/>
<br/>
For this month&#39;s discussion, I&#39;d like to address the<br/>
general idea of &quot;age appropriate&quot;curriculae. There<br/>
are ways that what I&#39;ll say has relevance for both<br/>
classroom teachers and homeschoolers, so I&#39;ll<br/>
try to address both groups.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I want to say that I attended public school<br/>
from kindergarten through 12th grade, and I came out of<br/>
that experience with the expected prejudices about &quot;age<br/>
appropriate&quot; curriculae. Namely, that at certain ages, children<br/>
become ready for certain concepts; that they are not ready<br/>
beforehand; and that they would be bored if you were to<br/>
teach a topic too late. [i.e:  you do in Algebra 1<br/>
in eighth grade, not before, not after.]<br/>
<br/>
Lately, in my work with both schooled and<br/>
homeschooled children, it&#39;s as if a metaphorical wrecking<br/>
ball has come along and demolished this notion.<br/>
<br/>
Three examples to show what I mean -<br/>
<br/>
Example #1:   I&#39;m working with a public schooled kindergarten child<br/>
whose parents want me to do math enrichment.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago she learned quite a bit about negative numbers,<br/>
and I&#39;d like to share how this happened.<br/>
<br/>
She and I were playing around with subtraction<br/>
problems, and I had just asked her what<br/>
8 - 3 was. She said 5, and then she asked, &quot;What&#39;s 3 - 8?&quot;<br/>
I asked her what she thought it would be. She pondered<br/>
for a moment and said, &quot;You can&#39;t do it.&quot; I said, &quot;Well,<br/>
actually, in much more advanced math, you can do it,<br/>
and the answer would be negative 5.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At that, this girl started chuckling. She kept saying<br/>
&quot;negative three&quot; and laughing. I offered her a way<br/>
of understanding this by asking: &quot;Imagine that you<br/>
have three pennies, but you owe someone 8. What<br/>
would happen?&quot; She said, &quot;I&#39;d give them the three, but<br/>
then I&#39;d still owe them more.&quot; I said, &quot;Can you figure out<br/>
how many more you&#39;d owe.&quot; She took a moment, and then<br/>
counted up from 3 to 8, using her fingers, and eventually<br/>
said five. I said, &quot;Right, you&#39;d owe five more. And when<br/>
you end up owing money, the amount is negative. Since you&#39;d owe<br/>
five, 3 - 8 is negative 5.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, this girl loved this concept. It just<br/>
intrigued her. She asked me to give her more problems<br/>
with negative numbers. What was I going to do? Refuse?!<br/>
<br/>
So since then, she and I have been doing a slew<br/>
of problems with negative numbers. Once she even<br/>
figured out 9 - 23. Wish you could have seen the look<br/>
on her face when I told her she was right!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a kindergartner learning something that is ordinarily<br/>
taught in seventh grade.<br/>
<br/>
Example #2:   I&#39;m working with a first-grade boy who is homeschooled<br/>
and his parents also want enrichment. One day he was<br/>
standing in the entrance to my office, which has saltillo<br/>
tiling, large tile whose grout lines form a square grid pattern. I <br/>
wondered<br/>
if we might use this floor design to introduce the notion<br/>
of the coordinate plane. I explain that where he was standing<br/>
we would call the center; I explained that distances to the right of<br/>
the center would be called x distances, and that distances<br/>
up from the center would be called y-distances. I sensed that he<br/>
liked the sound of those terms, so I talked a bit about sci-fi shows<br/>
like Star Trek where people need to give their coordinates so that<br/>
others can beam them up or locate them. He thought that was cool.<br/>
Then I asked him if thought he could locate me by my x- and<br/>
y-distances if I stood at a certain intersection point where the<br/>
grout lines met. He said he wasn&#39;t sure. I told him I&#39;d help him<br/>
figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
It really wasn&#39;t hard. Within 10 minutes, he was able to give my<br/>
x- and y-coordinates. Oh, I guess I must confess. Part of what<br/>
motivated him is this. I told him that if he stated my coordinates<br/>
correctly, then he would blow me up. The first time he exploded me,<br/>
he was hooked. (Boys are boys, right?).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, in this case, the boy was learning about the first quadrant<br/>
of the coordinate plane. But I&#39;m confident that with a little more <br/>
work,<br/>
he would be able to locate a point in any of the four quadrants.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a first-grader learning something that is ordinarily<br/>
taught in 8th or 9th grade.<br/>
<br/>
Example #3:  The same kindergarten girl that I mentioned above<br/>
was working on counting with me one day. As we approached<br/>
the number 10, I had her take 10 popsicle sticks and bind<br/>
them with a rubber band. To help her grasp the idea<br/>
of place value, we divided my desk into two sections,<br/>
divided by a chopstick taped down with masking tape<br/>
(I love Asian food, what can I say!).<br/>
<br/>
In the section to the right of the chopstick she placed single <br/>
popsicle<br/>
sticks; in the section to the left of the chopstick she placed bundles<br/>
of 10 popsicle sticks. With a little bit of work, she was able to<br/>
see that a number like 37 means three bundles and 7 singles,<br/>
that the number in the 10&#39;s place means number of bundles,<br/>
while the number in the 1&#39;s place means number of singles.<br/>
<br/>
During this first session on the topic, this girl did problems like 23 <br/>
+ 34<br/>
using the manipulatives. By the next session, she was doing problems<br/>
like 23 + 34 (no carrying) in her head. Four sessions later, she was <br/>
able to do<br/>
problems like 26 + 38 in her head. She would mutter to herself:<br/>
&quot;O.K. 2 bundles and 3 bundles is 5 bundles. 6 and 8 is ....... 14.<br/>
You take 10 from the 14 and bundle them up. Now you have ... 6<br/>
bundles, and you have four singles left. So it&#39;s sixty-four.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here is a kindergartner doing second grade math, but mentally,<br/>
and with command of place value.<br/>
<br/>
You might be thinking ... these must be exceptional children.<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve been tutoring/teaching for 11 years now, and I can<br/>
tell you that while these children are bright, they are<br/>
not the most mathematically intuitive youngsters<br/>
I&#39;ve worked with. They are just curious and fun, like most kids.<br/>
<br/>
You might also wonder if I&#39;m advocating that we speed kids<br/>
along and try to make them all little math geniuses by third grade?<br/>
No. All I&#39;m saying is that if we pay attention to clues kids give us<br/>
(like the girl asking what 3 - 8 would be, then giggling at the <br/>
answer),<br/>
we will find that children are often ready to explore math ideas that<br/>
are slated for later grades.<br/>
<br/>
In this respect, hats off to the National Council<br/>
of Mathematics Teachers. This organization in 2000 put out<br/>
general standards stating that children should be taught in five <br/>
content areas<br/>
from kindergarten through 12th grade. These are:<br/>
-  number & operation<br/>
- algebra<br/>
- geometry<br/>
- measurement<br/>
- data analysis and probability<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to read these standards and see how they<br/>
can help you do all kinds of interesting math with your<br/>
children, just go to:<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
The point is: if we just keep our eyes and ears open to the curiosity<br/>
of children, we will see that they are often interested<br/>
in and ready to explore math concepts beyond what<br/>
the state education departments or local school districts<br/>
tell us they should be learning.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the key has been listening to the questions of<br/>
children, and having faith that they can learn a lot more<br/>
than we might think.<br/>

PASS IT ALONG -<br/>
<br/>
If you like what you read in the Algebra Times,<br/>
feel free to forward a copy to a friend - or<br/>
to your distribution list of fellow educators<br/>
or homeschoolers. Many homeschoolers<br/>
send it out along their email loop, and it&#39;s<br/>
fine with me if you do.<br/>

TRICK OR TREAT?  TIME FOR A TRICK<br/>
<br/>
The other day I was working on reducing fractions<br/>
with a tutee, and I saw something new and useful<br/>
about reducing fractions.<br/>
<br/>
When we run into a fraction like 12/25, we know<br/>
that it can&#39;t be reduced further, and if you ask most<br/>
teachers (at least most I know), they&#39;ll say it&#39;s because<br/>
the two numbers, 12 and 25, have no common factors.<br/>
<br/>
This is certainly true, and this is a perfectly valid way of<br/>
explaining why the fraction can&#39;t be reduced further.<br/>
<br/>
But all of a sudden I realized another way of looking<br/>
at the situation. If you look at the gap (or difference)<br/>
between 12 and 25, you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s 13, a prime number.<br/>
<br/>
If you just think about this for a moment, you&#39;ll see that<br/>
since this gap is a prime number, there are only two<br/>
numbers that will divide that gap evenly: 1 and 13.<br/>
<br/>
1 has no power to reduce a fraction, and 13 does not<br/>
go into 25, so this leads to a shortcut:<br/>
<br/>
If the difference between the numerator and denominator of a fraction<br/>
turns out to be a prime number, you need only check if that<br/>
prime number goes into the numerator or denominator.<br/>
<br/>
If it goes into one, it will go into the other, and the fraction<br/>
can be reduced in one step. Examples of this would be:<br/>
<br/>
14/21 (7 apart, and 7 goes into both),<br/>
reducing to 2/3<br/>
<br/>
39/52 (13 apart, and 13 goes into both),<br/>
reducing to 3/4<br/>
<br/>
If the gap number does not go into either, then the fraction<br/>
cannot be reduced. Examples of this would be:<br/>
<br/>
38/45 (7 apart, but 7 goes into neither),<br/>
so it can&#39;t be reduced.<br/>
<br/>
80/93 (13 apart, but 13 goes into neither),<br/>
so it can&#39;t be reduced.<br/>
<br/>
And now you can get a little bit of practice with this idea:<br/>
<br/>
For each of the fractions below, find the gap between<br/>
the fraction&#39;s numerator and denominator, and see if it<br/>
is a prime number. Then use the ideas above to see whether<br/>
or not the fraction can be reduced, and if it can,<br/>
what it reduces to. (Answers at end of newsletter.)<br/>
