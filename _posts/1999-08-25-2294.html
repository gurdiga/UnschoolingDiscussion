<div id="ygrps-yiv-558334978"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I understand that the demands from young children are much greater and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>very<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wearing.  However, it is just when they are emerging from this stage when<br/>
&gt; most people send them to school.  For those of us that find toddlerhood so<br/>
&gt; challenging those early school years are so much fun - if you let them be.<br/>
&gt; Jill<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jill, I am so glad to hear you say that!  My eldest is just emerging from<br/>
&#39;toddlerhood&#39; (and being fairly tricky with it, but I think that&#39;s<br/>
because...) her sister is 2&1/2 and EXTREMELY demanding atm.  Oh, and while<br/>
I&#39;m here, Michelle, you sound like a wonderful mother and I hope Stirling<br/>
realises that in later years!  If I had half your patience/dedication/energy<br/>
I think I&#39;d be doing very well!  So to find someone categorically saying<br/>
that they find life with toddlers wearing, and that it gets more fun is a<br/>
real boost to me!  Thanks!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  oh thanks Tracy! &lt;blush&gt; not sure what exactly you read that stood <br/>
out but believe me, some days i am very lacking in all 3 of the above <br/>
mentioned compliments.  although Sterling is a handful for sure, i <br/>
can&#39;t figure out how parents do it with several children, children <br/>
with disabilities, or as a single parent.  I have a lot of respect <br/>
for any parent - it&#39;s not an easy job no matter how you slice it.  i <br/>
say &quot;job&quot; because no matter how much one enjoys it and savors every <br/>
wonderful moment, it still involves a lot of work and responsibility <br/>
to attain that level of enjoyment.  <br/>
<br/>
   and don&#39;t be so hard on yourself!  i&#39;m sure you are doing a lot <br/>
better than you give yourself credit for!   <br/>
<br/>
  So<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i have to agree with Jill.  although some of their toddler <br/>
frustrations are replaced by others as they get older, they do become <br/>
more fun.  i think maybe this happens right about the time they start <br/>
becoming a little &quot;person&quot; and discovering their &quot;self&quot; and having <br/>
their own identity.  It becomes more fun when they can communicate <br/>
and start asking lots of questions too.  although along with the <br/>
communication skills, come the tools to learn how to be sassy!  <br/>
so no... nothing&#39;s perfect!  &lt;G&gt;   <br/>
