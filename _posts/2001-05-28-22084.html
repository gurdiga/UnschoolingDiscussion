<div id="ygrps-yiv-112541423"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  So, if I understand unschooling (and I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t) it is basically<br/>
&gt;  making everyday things you do into a &quot;lesson&quot; without ever telling the<br/>
&gt;  child?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, no, more like the child making everyday things he/she does into a <br/>
lesson without ever telling you! They quietly learn when you&#39;re not looking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Like sewing, (I think boys should learn to sew!), cutting out <br/>
&gt;  the pattern, cooking and measuring, building a model kit, kite, craft,<br/>
&gt;  etc.?  It&#39;s having them being excited about a piece of history they <br/>
&gt;  read about and heading to the library to find out more?  It&#39;s being <br/>
&gt;  open to what they are interested in at the moment?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it&#39;s about what *they&#39;re* interested in. If that&#39;s sewing or kites, <br/>
fine. If you&#39;re interested in those things, do them and you&#39;re likely to get <br/>
some help, but it&#39;s not guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Which brings me to another question.  How to teach them spelling, <br/>
&gt;  vocabulary, phonograms to help them read.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*I* teach spelling by waiting &#39;til my son asks, &quot;How do you spell (whatever) <br/>
and then I tell him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are there &quot;tools&quot; you do <br/>
&gt;  use to help them learn? Do you limit their TV/computer game time?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We limit TV by not having one, but I don&#39;t limit computer time at all. We <br/>
have no computer games and no sound on our computer, which keeps the noise <br/>
level down considerably.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you go to the library a lot?  I guess I&#39;m just having trouble <br/>
&gt;  imagineing my kids initiating a &quot;learning experience&quot;!  Does <br/>
&gt;  unschooling put them behind academically?  I mean, you want them to be<br/>
&gt;  able to basic adding and subtracting by a certain age and then <br/>
&gt;  multiplying and dividing by another age, right?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we go to the library a lot (usually--haven&#39;t in about 6 weeks though). <br/>
We have no age by which we expect them to achieve certain milestones. My son <br/>
is focused on words and numbers right now, but he also goes months without <br/>
thinking of anything but vehicles, which I also respect. I figure he learned <br/>
to talk just fine without &quot;lessons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Quite a different mindset!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116959438">Hi everyone - I&#39;m coming out of a loooong lurkdom for a quick intro.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Nicki, mama in Michigan to Dalton (6.5) and Teegan (3.5). I have always<br/>
&quot;believed in&quot; unschooling but became unexpectedly single two years ago and<br/>
had to rely on childcare and then public school for my oldest child. I am<br/>
very grateful to be remarried to a wonderful supportive husband who has<br/>
agreed to support my homeschooling. Thankfully my oldest child has somehow<br/>
retained a LOT of his innocence despite his public school experience this<br/>
past year. He really loves school and has no desire to be taken out of it<br/>
but I can&#39;t imagine sending him when I don&#39;t *have* to and I can REALLY see<br/>
the harm that is taking place. I won&#39;t pretend he has been unharmed by the<br/>
public schools - but the harm that is done is so &quot;typical&quot; that it is seen<br/>
by friends and family as &quot;normal growth&quot; and &quot;part of life&quot;. In fact, my<br/>
Mother (who is my only local relative and very close to my children) will<br/>
absolutely FREAK out about the prospects of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m challenged to try to maintain a balance with regular public school and<br/>
my own desire to unschool for the remainder of the school year. I hate<br/>
school &lt;grin&gt;. But Dalton has had another huge learning burst (at home) and<br/>
so it&#39;s reclaimed my desire to homeschool. He&#39;s on some numbers rampage<br/>
where he&#39;s hungry for learning every combo of ways numbers work and I am<br/>
(semi-reluctantly) guiding him. He announced on Friday that his teacher was<br/>
retiring (he was supposed to have his teacher 2 years in a row in this<br/>
program he is in but now that obviously won&#39;t happen even if he stayed in<br/>
PS) and I told him that pretty much sealed the homeschool deal and he whined<br/>
:-(. I pointed out that he would not even be able to do the math he loves<br/>
doing at school in the fall and he said &quot;MOM! There&#39;s ALWAYS RECESS!&quot;. Like,<br/>
DUH! Like I said, he retains a lot of his innocence. He brought his<br/>
finger-knitting to his first day of Boy Scouts. He does math he learns at<br/>
home during recess and shares it with his friends (which so far has not been<br/>
a problem). He is constantly involved in some new home-project or<br/>
self-initiated lesson that he feels obligated to bring to school to share<br/>
with everyone. I always let him but I&#39;ve ran into HUGE brick walls with his<br/>
teacher and she has literally told him he is not ALLOWED to do certain<br/>
things at home (read certain books, in particular). Luckily, so far it seems<br/>
his math teacher is more willing to encourage his home learning but his<br/>
regular teacher finds it extremely inappropriate. I can&#39;t STAND hearing this<br/>
child tell me &quot;MOM, I HAVE to do XYZ or my teacher will be soooo mad at me!<br/>
She says ever since I started doing things YOUR way, my PERFORMANCE in<br/>
READING has DETERIORATED&quot; (gag::choke::spew).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - that&#39;s my story in a nut shell. My Dh is a VERY reluctant supporter<br/>
of unschooling but I&#39;m not worried - I know he&#39;ll come around. It&#39;s still a<br/>
faith leap for him but I&#39;ve been watching it in action since my babies were<br/>
born so it is so far very natural for me. I&#39;m just trying to make a<br/>
conscious effort to point out the differences and the &quot;learning in action&quot;<br/>
and so far that seems helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to de-lurk further and join in the discussion :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  imagineing my kids initiating a &quot;learning experience&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the things I tell my Dh and others who ask is to think about your<br/>
child&#39;s interests, especially their passions. Those are almost always<br/>
self-initiated learning experiences. Obviously they were exposed to<br/>
SOMEthing in life to develop the interest in the first place but it usually<br/>
wasn&#39;t a unit or lesson or classroom.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, off the bat I can tell you my 3yo is passionate about<br/>
dinosaurs and bugs. I did not intentionally expose my child to those things<br/>
in the hopes of creating a passion. I exposed him to those things as parts<br/>
of life, reading, movies, gardening, whatever. I can&#39;t predict what will be<br/>
his next passion. When he does develop his new passions at this level I do<br/>
not interfere much unless he asks (and he will!). He has a &quot;bug jar&quot; he made<br/>
at our homeschooling group&#39;s garden that he keeps in his room and spends a<br/>
large portion of his day digging silently by himself in the dirt in our yard<br/>
finding new creatures and adding them to his jar. Sometimes he&#39;ll ask about<br/>
a bug and we&#39;ll research it a bit. Eventually he&#39;ll dump out his jar and let<br/>
his friends free and start over. Last month it was worms and he wanted to<br/>
see what compost looks like so we kept the worms for a month and then let<br/>
them back in our garden. Dinosaurs - same thing. We have tons of books,<br/>
videos (Nat&#39;l Geographic has great dino videos), toys and visit every dino<br/>
exhibit that comes near our city. I&#39;m not much interested in dinos or bugs<br/>
myself :) but his love of learning is contagious and I&#39;ve learned a lot<br/>
through osmosis :). It&#39;s also been contagious enough to revitalize a love of<br/>
bugs and dinos in my 6yo. But we don&#39;t do unit studies on these things or<br/>
specifically set of formal learning. We just learn through living, doing,<br/>
following what makes sense and what drives us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122776941">To Nicki -<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a &#39;lurker&#39; too. But that&#39;s only because I didn&#39;t find unschooling <br/>
to be the best route for my dd (her choice). That said, however, I <br/>
think unschooling is great - just not for us.  So I come to this list <br/>
to listen because I learn new ideas all the time.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote &lt;she has literally told him he is not ALLOWED to do certain<br/>
things at home (read certain books, in particular). Luckily, so far <br/>
it seems his math teacher is more willing to encourage his home <br/>
learning but his regular teacher finds it extremely inappropriate.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would go BALLISTIC if a teacher had the audacity to tell my child <br/>
what he is or is not allowed to do at home!!!! Unless you&#39;re talking <br/>
about pornography (which I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not), then she has no right <br/>
to interfere in your homelife. Even if you&#39;re using methods <br/>
contradictory to hers. Personally, I would complain to the principal <br/>
and the school board about her interference. And this is coming from <br/>
a former teacher! So, stick to your ideas and get him home. Once he&#39;s <br/>
home, he&#39;ll enjoy it as much (probably more) than he ever did school. <br/>
My dd was unwilling to homeschool too.  Now she wouldn&#39;t dream of <br/>
going to school.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my .02 cents.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks Tracy...lol. Yeah, he says every morning &quot;Bye, Mom...see you in 7<br/>
hours&quot;. No, I&#39;m not kidding. This is his regular goodbye for us. He thinks<br/>
this is cool, I think it&#39;s terrifying. Especially last week when my 3yo<br/>
slept peacefully in my bed during a tornado that *I* knew was way north of<br/>
us while my 6yo was hovering in a restroom wondering if his school was going<br/>
to be demolished by a tornado for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
It would be much easier to take this POV if the teachers were supportive but<br/>
they act VERY taken aback or challenged or insulted or something. I refuse<br/>
to speak to them about it because frankly it is none of their business. But<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I am becoming rather adversarial and have even stooped to telling<br/>
Dalton that these are people we hire to do a job for us - not parent my<br/>
children or tell me how I can spend my spare time with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
The case in point that I referred to, by the way, was that my son was having<br/>
trouble progressing with his reading. I had an epiphany that perhaps he<br/>
should read just in his head, develop an actual (gasp) enjoyment of reading<br/>
and then his reading would progress. Well - this worked for exactly two days<br/>
when he came home announcing that his teacher forbade him from reading the<br/>
books I picked out (Amelia Bedlia of all things) because they were &quot;too<br/>
advanced&quot; for him and now he will not read at all. I fought and fought but<br/>
it will just be one of those things that can wait. He needs to be<br/>
de-schooled because right now he firmly believes that his teacher is the<br/>
word of God and the end all be all of learning. She has more power in my own<br/>
home than I have and that is just messed up. Like someone said - it&#39;s not<br/>
like I&#39;m exposing him to porn. It was Amelia Bedilia. Finally, the teacher<br/>
backed down and agreed he could read those books *as long as* he was reading<br/>
them - out loud - to me. He was specifically NOT allowed to read in his<br/>
head. I will not even go into how totally absurd this is. I mean WHO the<br/>
hell (besides people who record audio books for a living) needs to be<br/>
proficient readers out loud. He spends SO much time trying to get<br/>
intonation, fluency and emphasis correct that progress is totally lost (as<br/>
is enjoyment - the real issue to me). Take away fluency, intonation and<br/>
proper emphasis and he&#39;s a GREAT little reader who (for awhile anyway -<br/>
until his teacher brainwashed him) really enjoyed reading and had full<br/>
comprehension. Isn&#39;t that the goal? Sheesh.<br/>

UGH!  Don&#39;t know about stooping, sounds like you&#39;re <br/>
standing proud to tell your son that this woman is no <br/>
more special than a bus-driver or shop-assistant or <br/>
anything, she&#39;s there to be an adult presence in a room <br/>
full of small children and try to teach them what she <br/>
knows, which may or may not be useful to any of the <br/>
children in the room.  Scary.  A friend of mine had a <br/>
similar situation, pulled younger children out but <br/>
eldest wouldn&#39;t leave, child seriously needs <br/>
deschooling, de-peer-orienting too, btw.<br/>
<br/>
I never had that problem, despite being an early <br/>
reader.  Though I do have a tendency to believe <br/>
everything I read, which I&#39;ve heard is common among <br/>
&#39;earlies&#39;<br/>

Bet you&#39;re looking forward to the Summer...<br/>

course, is only IF you were leaving him in ps which I hope you&#39;re not <br/>
going to do.)<br/>
<br/>
I am absolutely amazed that most people assume they have no rights in <br/>
schools. I guess it&#39;s part of the brainwashing still working in <br/>
adulthood. Every parent should be able to stand up for what they <br/>
believe is right for their child. <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there, hold your head high and speak your mind. What possible <br/>
harm can that teacher do to you?  Ask you to take your son out of <br/>
school?  Gladly!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879794003">&lt;&lt;WHY hold your tongue?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s not for lack of rights. It&#39;s because I view the PS system as<br/>
unchangeable, a failed system. If I actually thought I&#39;d see change, I might<br/>
devote more of my time to the PS system because I *do* consider it to be an<br/>
important system for the large majority of the country. I&#39;ve always thought<br/>
I&#39;d be one of those parents who homeschools but also keeps a strong arm in<br/>
the local PS to be proactive in change on that end too. I didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
one of the &quot;whiners&quot; who talks about all that is wrong with the PS system<br/>
but doesn&#39;t bother to do anything to change it. But what I&#39;ve grown to<br/>
believe is that the system is flawed for far too many reasons and that large<br/>
enough change to make PS an enriching growth experience for all simply is a<br/>
joke. It can&#39;t be done. I could still fight for the sake of fighting - just<br/>
so I could *say* that I&#39;m being proactive. But that would take precious time<br/>
and energy away from our family and for what? For nothing. Instead, I<br/>
consider PS to be a lost cause. I try not to &quot;whine&quot; about how PS is so<br/>
doomed and all the problems inherent to it because I am NOT willing to be<br/>
proactive in change. Instead of just believe what I believe in choose to<br/>
spend my time focused on my children.<br/>
<br/>
I did struggle long and hard and had many conversations with my dh about<br/>
what to do in terms of that particular situation at my son&#39;s school and<br/>
decided that it simply was not worth fighting for change. At MOST it would<br/>
get THIS teacher to tip-toe around MY child. But a much more important fight<br/>
worth fighting, in my opinion, is the fight to get my own child to see that<br/>
his worth is not dictated by this or any other adult. That his abilities are<br/>
something internal to him that only he is in control of and that certainly<br/>
no teacher whose salary WE pay can &quot;be mad at him&quot; or make him otherwise<br/>
feel bad or blue for not agreeing to do things HER way. I can most easily<br/>
change HIS view of the PS system and put it in perspective. I can NOT change<br/>
the entire PS world&#39;s view of my child. It is just an impossible (and moot)<br/>
battle with too much wasted misguided energy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am absolutely amazed that most people assume they have no rights in<br/>
schools.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And at the doctor&#39;s office :) It&#39;s the same mentality - that these people we<br/>
PAY to do a SERVICE for us are somehow in charge and can dictate what we do<br/>
and how we do it and when and can make us feel like crap. We PAY for<br/>
that?!!?!?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131591082">Nicki -<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely agree with you. And I know that speaking up will <br/>
probably not change this teacher or the school or the system. <br/>
However, if a bully was abusing your son, wouldn&#39;t you stand up and <br/>
say something? Knowing full well that the bully probably won&#39;t get <br/>
the message? This teacher is a legitimized bully to your son. So I&#39;m <br/>
glad that you&#39;re getting him out of that situation.<br/>
<br/>
Although it may seem that none of our &#39;stands&#39; would make any <br/>
difference, I think people still need to voice their concerns, their <br/>
rights and insist on them. For instance, although not many of us <br/>
question our doctors, there is a growing flood of people willing to <br/>
address their concerns, challenge their doctors, and expect better <br/>
care where years before they would never have even thought to <br/>
question. Change - even slow, slow change - has to start with <br/>
something; some small gesture.<br/>
<br/>
Had a teacher been unwilling to give me their curriculum outline at <br/>
the beginning of the school year, I would have run straight to the <br/>
principal and/or the school board and demanded it. But that&#39;s me and <br/>
maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a former teacher and know how the system is <br/>
and school&#39;s don&#39;t intimidate me. <br/>
<br/>
My dd was in school for 4 years before we started homeschooling.  And <br/>
the schools and the teachers knew me and what I expected out of the <br/>
school and them. And I got it. Not so much because I &#39;knew the ropes&#39; <br/>
but because I was persistent.  Of course, I was known as &#39;that <br/>
mother&#39; and, I&#39;m sure, worse names. But that&#39;s a small price to pay <br/>
for the results.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to criticize you.  I think you&#39;ve done well and will <br/>
love homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t leave the system for homeschooling; we really just kind of <br/>
fell into it and now love it.  Good luck to you.<br/>

Seconded, and use your best arguments and do so in <br/>

to you that he learns things his way and that the <br/>
teacher is not exempt from being told how not to do <br/>
stuff :-)<br/>
