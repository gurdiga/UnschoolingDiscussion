<div id="ygrps-yiv-925927022">An online aquaintance started a new forum I thought some of you <br/>
might enjoy participating in.<br/>
Ami McKay is a writer, and an unschooling Mum living in Nova Scotia. <br/>
Her forum has some neat stuff for writers (including a new poetry <br/>
contest) and the unschooling area seems to be taking off as well.<br/>
Check it out:<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s written some articles for soulfulliving.com, if some of you <br/>
read there. I adore her writing....her online blog is a fun read too.<br/>
