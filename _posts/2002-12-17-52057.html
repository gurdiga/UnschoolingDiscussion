<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903354810">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Since we &quot;jumped in with both feet &quot; a couple weeks ago I&#39;d like to ask <br/>
another question. Since I&#39;m trying to get the unschooling life down better I <br/>
was wondering if consequences for bad behavior falls outside of the box. For <br/>
example before my son, who like to argue and yell at his brother, would get <br/>
check marks under game playing that meant 15 minutes off game. My question is <br/>
how should we handle it now? Or if this way would still be considered <br/>
unschooling because he has the choice of doing the bad behavior before he <br/>
gets the consequence.<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated since we are so new at this and are <br/>
bound to make a lot of mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Well all I can do is tell you is what we do. You didn&#39;t say exactly what the <br/>
problem is but I&#39;m guessing it has to do with maybe one sibling not being <br/>
the nicest they can be to another? I have that here although not nearly as <br/>
much as when I yelled and sent them to their rooms!<br/>
<br/>
We talk to them. There is no punishment for anything here other than natural <br/>
consequences. Like you break something it&#39;s gone and if you want another one <br/>
save your money. My two middle ones are 13 months apart and they pretty much <br/>
either love each other dearly or hate each other. Luckily the latter has <br/>
been lessened. I seperate them both and go to the one first that seems most <br/>
upset. Instead of listening to all the he said she said he did she did <br/>
stuff, I start talking about what they see that happened and how they feel <br/>
and how they think the other one feels and what could they do differently <br/>
the next time around to prevent what happened. This could last for maybe 20 <br/>
minutes or so. We don&#39;t make it a quick you can do this next time thing and <br/>
leave. Then it&#39;s the other ones turn. We didn&#39;t have miracles overnight but <br/>
I see a big difference in the kids because of it. Now I hear them trying to <br/>
figure stuff out when a problem arises. Sometimes when one gets <br/>
antagonistic, the other one will become vocal about their feelings and that <br/>
helps to alleviate any further problems.<br/>

<br/>
EXTREME EXAMPLE ALERT:<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the argument wife beaters use--&quot;If you didn&#39;t want me to hit you you <br/>
should have cleaned the house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Consequences&quot; is a euphemism for punishment, if the &quot;consequences&quot; are <br/>
declared in advance and administered by someone else.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an unschooling thing, it&#39;s a parenting thing, though.  <br/>
On the other hand, the more loving and trusting the relationship between you <br/>
and your children is, the better unschooling is going to work.  <br/>
<br/>
If you and he figure out a way to see his relationship with his brother as <br/>
something worth working on and making better, then the consequences of his <br/>
being mean will be their relationship could suffer, or the brother could be <br/>
mean in return.  His reason to be nice to his brother should have nothing to <br/>
do wtih video game time.<br/>
<br/>
Are you limiting video game time in general?<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t seen this already, please look.  There&#39;s an addition since <br/>
this morning, a comment on Mary Gold&#39;s &quot;If you Give a Kid a Nintendo...&quot; <br/>
article.  (If you go to that one and then to &quot;read comments,&quot; there&#39;s a new <br/>
testimonial from a mom whose son has benefitted from games play.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And another benefit in talking it out, problem solving out loud, is that your <br/>
children will learn to problem solve in other situations when you are not <br/>
around.  My boys do so well with other children.  I see other children <br/>
running up to the mom or dad every 5 minutes saying &quot;sally won&#39;t share her <br/>
dolls&quot; or &quot; Joe won&#39;t play with me&quot; or &quot; Jimmy grabbed the toy&quot; etc.  And mom <br/>
or dad hops off to solve the problem.  If your children learn to problem <br/>
solve they can handle most minor problems themselves they won&#39;t always look <br/>
to you to&quot;handle&quot; a situation for them.<br/>

I&#39;ve been going through alot of heartache over my kids ways of talking to <br/>
each other. This was so helpful. <br/>
I did talk to Emily yesterday about how sad I was that Max was loosing that <br/>
innocent sweetness and beginning to speak meanly and with a nasty tone of <br/>
voice. I said that it made me so sad, and that the reason he was doing itt <br/>
was because he heard Emily and Zack talking to each other like that. I <br/>
explained that Max looks up to them and wants to emulate them and he is <br/>
picking up some meaness. I asked her to be a little more aware. Today I am <br/>
going to attempt that same conversation with Zack, although he got a new PS2 <br/>
the other day and is a bit, shall we say, engrossed. LOL<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  There is no punishment for anything here other than natural <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same here. Punishing has never worked in our family. We talk about the <br/>
feelings and results of different behaviors. Letting the kids know how others <br/>
may feel.<br/>
I think when kids &quot;mess up&quot;, break something, say something mean, hit, hurt, <br/>
those types, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt. They are children. <br/>
Learning to live amongst others. They are not born with all the social skills <br/>
programmed so that they KNOW what is right or wrong, they need to learn it. <br/>
We &quot;teach&quot; them by modeling the behavior that we want them to pick up. If we <br/>
want them to say please and ask for things in a polite manner, then WE <br/>
(adults) need to do the same. If we want them to speak about feelings rather <br/>
than throw tantrums, then we need to talk about things rather than yelling <br/>
and slam things around.<br/>
Punishment also has typically been unrelated to the &quot;crime&quot; Mary pushes <br/>
little Billy of his Bike so She can&#39;t ride her bike anymore. What has been <br/>
learned here? <br/>
DON&#39;T GET CAUGHT.<br/>
Mom might want to get out there and ask Mary what happened, commiserating <br/>
with her sense of frustration and anger about maybe having to let little <br/>
Billy go with her when she wanted to hang out with the big girls. If Billy is <br/>
upset, TALK to him, let him know you are sorry that the two aren&#39;t getting <br/>
along. And I think Mary B is right about the length of time to talk, 5 <br/>
minutes of &quot;You shouldn&#39;t do that because X X X...&quot; isn&#39;t enough for the <br/>
child&#39;s feelings to come to the surface.<br/>

<br/>
You know when the kids talk like that to each other, sometimes it&#39;s so hard <br/>
to put aside the anger and sadness I feel right at the moment and do what is <br/>
best for them to learn. It does help in the long run but I still struggle <br/>
with doing the right thing at times.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was trying to get out of the house to go to Rag Shop. My kids <br/>
want to make Christmas crafts to hand out to friends and relatives. Anyway, <br/>
it was late and I really wanted to get out of the house and I was in my <br/>
bedroom getting dressed. I have the intercom on from the girls room for the <br/>
baby and I heard Sierra talking very mean to Alyssa. That was unusual and <br/>
she was very taunting and teasing and just plain mean. By the time I got to <br/>
their room, the baby was starting to cry. I took Alyssa out of the room and <br/>
pretty much just raised my voice to Sierra and told her what I thought about <br/>
what she was doing. Not the best thing to do but it caught me off guard and <br/>
I was in a hurry. I&#39;m still trying every day.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh, maybe I should have clarified. I have a habit of thinking you all <br/>
know what I&#39;m talking about! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I never go into the child&#39;s room and say what I think they should have done <br/>
or what I was not liking. The thing for me is to have them be able to figure <br/>
that out by themselves with my help to get at why they did what they did. <br/>
Never a lecture.<br/>
<br/>
My point about not being just a 5 minute thing was because it does take some <br/>
time to actually get at what the problem was in the first place that made <br/>
the child behave that way. And sometimes my children don&#39;t want to really <br/>
talk right away. So sometimes we snuggle and I comfort them and maybe just <br/>
do some general talking on my own. Maybe I remember a time similar when I <br/>
was younger or even when Tara was younger. That usually helps them get <br/>
started and that&#39;s when they start talking. So all in all it&#39;s usually at <br/>
least a 20 minute thing, occasionally sooner if it&#39;s a reminder type of <br/>
situtation and sometimes longer if it&#39;s something new that has come up and <br/>
my child is into talking about it.<br/>
