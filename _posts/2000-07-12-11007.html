&lt;&lt; Good luck to you and let me know how it goes.  Are you within driving <br/>
 distance of Sesame Place?  We are only about 20 minutes away.<br/>

 Bonnie &gt;&gt;<br/>
Bonnie, we can get to sesame in about 2 1/2 hrs if we don&#39;t hit much traffic. <br/>
we are on long island. i love sesame and every year try to talk my dh into a <br/>
season pass, but since he does the driving (so i can nurse emma while she is <br/>
still strapped in her carseat-now there is a visual, lol) i got voted down <br/>
again this year ! i am trying to rally the troops about cleaning. the laundry <br/>
is one thing oi do not mind doing. if everyone helped with the sorting and <br/>
folding, i would not mind at all doing all the washing and drying. people do <br/>
not even think laundry around here until they are naked or need a uniform <br/>
shirt for a game in 5 minutes! my 13 1/2 yo son is fond of saying that the <br/>
laundry, dishes, etc. are &quot;my job&quot; because i do not go out to work fulltime <br/>
for money. how did i end up with archie bunker for a son???????<br/>

I agree... plus I was saying to somebody, off list, the other day... We ought <br/>
to ask the member whose a Nanny how much she makes... Because you can bet she <br/>
doesn&#39;t work for free from 5am-midnight, (on call for the rest of the time) <br/>
for no money and no benefits.  If we were paid in the currency that is <br/>
commonly accepted as being worthy in this state of mind we live in, we would <br/>
make at least $40,000 per year with weekends off and 9-5 hours.(LOL<br/>

here they go through all the jobs that a mother does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292687658">LOL.  That is too funny Bridget.  I also used to nurse my kids in their car <br/>
seats.  I often wondered what people passing by thought I was doing <br/>
(suffocating my child perhaps?)  Well, if you guys are ever coming down this <br/>
way, we are really close.  Also, there is a new water park that opened at <br/>
Six Flags this year called Hurricane Harbor and so far I have gotten very <br/>
good reviews...<br/>

to be his job.<br/>
