but will be thinking about you.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font size="2">I&#39;m not sure where I stand about the whole maths thing, why is 
it necessary to think about things in subjects?&nbsp; Arithmetic, which a lot of 
folk see as maths, tends to be something which people either get or don&#39;t, which 
is why we have calculators.&nbsp; But that doesn&#39;t mean that people who can&#39;t 
add can&#39;t think about the dimensions of things, measure things, count notes to 
play music.&nbsp; Not being able to spell well doesn&#39;t mean that someone can&#39;t 
write beautiful poetry, it means they need a spell-checker or an editor.&nbsp; 
Not being able to write neatly doesn&#39;t mean that someone can&#39;t write fascinating 
articles for magazines, it means they use a word-processor.&nbsp; Not being able 
to tell the time doesn&#39;t mean that one can&#39;t understand why the Jews were sent 
to concentration camps in our recent history, or that dinosaurs are extinct, in 
our long-distant past.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">This is another big part of unschooling, being able to 
recognise the ways we learn best, being able to recognise our talents and using 
those talents to get where we want to be (even to figure out where we want to 
be, which is probably much more difficult :-)&nbsp;)&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">ooooh, I&#39;m full of it tonight :-)</font></div>

Just wanted to pop in and say hello<br/>
I am a LLL Leader in New York, we just moved from Texas.  When I was <br/>
down for a visit we had a woman from England visit one of our <br/>
meetings.  It was great to hear the different ideas from another <br/>
group.  Good luck with your reading and preview.<br/>
