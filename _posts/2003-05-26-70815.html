<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058267811">One of the things I love about unschooling is having more time for my daughter. She&#39;s 4 and when we were doing school-at-home all too often I would find her something to do while the boys and I got through lessons. I remember being grateful that she was able to play independently  of me. <br/>
<br/>
She has been more demanding since we began unschooling but it occurred to me today that she is making up for all the times I had no time for her and I&#39;m extremely thankful that she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great day together today. We looked around the garden for  flowers and anthills and played catch and I pushed her on the swing for ages. She helped me cook and do dishes, the we played with stuff at the sink to see what would float and wouldn&#39;t. It was fun.  <br/>
