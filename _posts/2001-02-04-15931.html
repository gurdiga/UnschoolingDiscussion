<div id="ygrps-yiv-660344590">Thank you all for giving me much to think about. After the first little flare <br/>
ups I think we have, for the most part, discussed this issue with respect and <br/>
sensitivity. When my children and I discuss this issue, I will be able to <br/>
share with them a more informed perspective of the other side of this <br/>
extremely complex issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085713602">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I feel the need to share our wonderful experience this past week at the <br/>
Unschooling Rural Oasis at Winona Farm in Winona Minnesota. Farm Web Site: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.nbci.com/winfarm/index2.htm">http://members.nbci.com/winfarm/index2.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
If you live anywhere near Winona, try to make it over there!  Dick and Sue <br/>
are two of the most fascinating people we have ever had the pleasure to <br/>
meet!  Dick Gallien is a man that has been many places and has done many <br/>
things and has some great stories to tell.  Sue (who I just noticed is on <br/>
this list, HI SUE!!) is Dicks partner and after nine kids has seen <br/>
everything I think.  The four kids that live there now were fun to hang out <br/>
with (tell them that Ian and Riley miss them terribly already!!).  We spent <br/>
quite a few evenings sitting around with the kids sipping hot cocoa and <br/>
watching them play.<br/>
<br/>
The farm itself is almost its own living organism.  It really has a life of <br/>
its own.  There was so much to learn!!  Scott and I got a real taste of <br/>
what it is to be unschoolers ourselves too, which was most eye <br/>
opening.  Dick and Sue did not hold our hands and drag us around, but gave <br/>
us space to take it all in, think about things, ask questions, and do <br/>
things on our own.  It was such a nice change of pace!!  Scott and I felt <br/>
like kids ourselves with of the questions we had and things we had to <br/>
learn.  We learned about composting, animal gestations, farm equipment, the <br/>
importance of returning what we take from the earth, recycling of all <br/>
kinds, and what it feels like to do work, and not just a job.  We also <br/>
learned that chickens will eat just about anything, including chicken (we <br/>
city folks had assumed that chickens were vegetarians, lol!!)<br/>
<br/>
The kids had a fun time sledding, snowboarding, collecting eggs, and <br/>
playing with the other kids.  Riley got to ride on a goat (she fell in love <br/>
with the goats!!)<br/>
<br/>
Let me put it this way:  If we had another 8 days to take a vacation and <br/>
had to choose between my sisters place in Florida (where it is nice and <br/>
warm, and near the beach lol) and going back to see the wonderful folks at <br/>
Winona Farm, the Farm would win hands down every time.<br/>
<br/>
Though, if you are looking for a quaint country cottage where you can sit <br/>
sipping tea while watching the youngsters frolic in the meadows with the <br/>
sheep, you are probably going to be disappointed.  This is a working farm, <br/>
where there is a ton of work to be done and take part in.  No one is going <br/>
to hold your hand through it all either.  Just like we leave the bulk of <br/>
learning up to our young unschoolers, the exact same is expected of us.  It <br/>
was truly a wonderful experience for our whole family.<br/>
<br/>
The town of Winona is GORGEOUS too.  This was our first visit to Minnesota, <br/>
and instantly fell in love with its landscape.  I even HATED snow before <br/>
this visit, but now I can appreciate its beauty.  Living in a huge city <br/>
like St Louis, snow is usually a nightmare waiting to happen.  There it was <br/>
almost peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you are looking for a REAL experience and not just some manufactured <br/>
one, take a trip to meet the nice people at Winona Farm.  Open your minds <br/>
and take in the new experience and learn along with your kids.  It is a <br/>
great way to prove that we are always learning, never to old to learn <br/>
something new, and that age should never be a restriction (Dick is almost <br/>
70 and is the most agile and tenacious person I have ever met!  He makes <br/>
most people 1/4 his age look like slugs!!).  It is a wonderful place to <br/>
learn about real animals (though be warned it is NOT a petting zoo), <br/>
composting, waste reductions, and just how backwards a lot of things are <br/>
done in our society (ie landfills, and the way we recycle waste).  If you <br/>
are not afraid to get dirty (and you WILL get very dirty) and are open to <br/>
new experiences, this is worth the trip.  We drove 8 hours to get there and <br/>
would do it again tomorrow if my husband was not expected back at work (but <br/>
he works for Chrysler, so I am sure he will be laid off again soon!!)<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else been there?  If so I would love to hear your <br/>
impression!  feel free to email me off the list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:vespass@...">vespass@...</a> if <br/>
you want.<br/>
<br/>
Here are our personal pictures from the trip!!<br/>
