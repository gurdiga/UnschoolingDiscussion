<div id="ygrps-yiv-952860985">My son at age 8 had bird (green cheek conure).<br/>
His responsibility was food and water and mainly companionship for the bird.<br/>
I did the cage cleaning.  It was a good arrangement.  They were a wonderful<br/>
pair.  The bird was almost always with him riding in the front of his shirt<br/>
with just her little head poking out.  They would climb trees, go on walks<br/>
and bike rides, sit around the house...  then one day she just didn&#39;t wake<br/>
up.  It was very devastating.<br/>
It&#39;s been about a year now, and he thinks he is ready for another bird.  My<br/>
concern is that he may not find one that would develop the kind of<br/>
relationship that he had with the first one and he would be disappointed.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know much about birds.   Are any of you bird owners?  Any ideas?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-398120062">This was such a sweet story! We have 2 cats and 1 dog and none of my kids<br/>
have this kind of relationship with any of them. I&#39;m so jealous!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-188609429">Just got back from the Humane Society and a Pet Store minus any animals.  Zak <br/>
and Max were both fascinated by all the animals that were there, even though <br/>
Zak still insists he wants a rabbit. I&#39;ve told him we are going to talk about <br/>
what&#39;s involved and really it&#39;s just a case of whether I can cope with <br/>
anything else.  If I was &quot;just&quot; a SAHM and didn&#39;t have a business to run as <br/>
well, however the more involved I get with the unschooling the less time I <br/>
have to spend on my business... but maybe that&#39;s a subject for the other list.<br/>
