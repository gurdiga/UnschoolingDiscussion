<div id="ygrps-yiv-19016656">I&#39;ve never seen that before.  I went to your blog - which opens up to a dark screen - and opened View Source to see the html.  The weird thing is that it only shows the data for the page details - colors, margins, etc.  There is no content.  When I view source for my blog melonary.blogspot.com, it shows the page data AND my posts.<br/>
<br/>
Did you change anything in your template?  Can you undo the changes?<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried resetting your template?  If you want to give that a try, go into Dashboard, select Change Settings, Template, Pick New.  Normally, changing the template does not remove any previous posts, but no guarantees.<br/>
<br/>
Have you already looked around in Blogger Help?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I don&#39;t have a definite solution for you.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I put quotes to show in the side margin and across the bottom.   And at <br/>
first they showed.  I didn&#39;t touch anything else.  Then the  rest of the blog <br/>
showed for a couple of days but the quotes were gone.  No  biggie, I thought.  <br/>
Then everything went away.  So maybe I polluted it  somehow, but it seems if <br/>
I&#39;d screwed it up it would&#39;ve shown immediately, and  the quotes I put in are <br/>
gone too.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe if I just change templates completely it will pick up the posts  and <br/>
links from wherever they live.<br/>
 <br/>

Read the whole boring thing, and then wrote to them and got an automated  <br/>
response saying, more or less, &quot;there are many boring things you could read&quot; but  <br/>
I&#39;d already read them all.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, when I go there now, there&#39;s no dark anything, just a whole lot of <br/>
wacky source stuff.  I&#39;d bet something went haywire when you went into <br/>
the template source to add the quotes, though I&#39;m not sure exactly what <br/>
could have gone so drastically wrong. What you described first sounds <br/>
like it could&#39;ve been something going wrong with the color tags, but <br/>
without having seen it, I couldn&#39;t really tell you what.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried going to your dashboard and simply choosing a different <br/>
template? Blogger is set up to make switching templates pretty easy, <br/>
though you lose your links and stuff each time you switch. See if you <br/>
switch templates if any of the previous blog is restored. If it was just <br/>
a color tag glitch that may clear it up. Other than that, I don&#39;t have <br/>
any brilliant suggestions.<br/>

<br/>
i&#39;m looking at your site with firefox. the HTML body of your template <br/>
is gone. set-up a different template. that should do the trick.<br/>

I might&#39;ve sooner if you hadn&#39;t been so pushy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But look...  the blog is a big blue screen, while this<br/>
_http://sandradodd.com_ (http://sandradodd.com) <br/>
is updated regularly and has a ton of good, working links (except the one  to <br/>
that blog...)<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll switch the template out.<br/>
 <br/>
It wouldn&#39;t hurt my feelings any if my four whole posts are lost.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I have the prairie dog photo here anyway:<br/>
_http://sandradodd.com/prairiedogs_ (http://sandradodd.com/prairiedogs) <br/>
 <br/>
Pam Sorooshian&#39;s had blogs for a long time, but she&#39;s not using them for  <br/>
day-to-day reports, but for resource pages.<br/>
 <br/>
As the the many hundreds remaining in &quot;ya&#39;all,&quot; some have blogs and I&#39;m  <br/>
guessing most don&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
I changed the template and it seems to show to all but me, so now I&#39;ll go  <br/>
look for a cache to dump.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, all!<br/>
 <br/>
