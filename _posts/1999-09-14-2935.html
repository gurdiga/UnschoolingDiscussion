<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015376062">I receive the digest, and my only bug with it is that any attachments posted<br/>
don&#39;t come through, and one has to scan past all the messages, and if<br/>
replies don&#39;t have the original message removed, it can be hard to follow.<br/>
If folk don&#39;t want to start snipping, (I said snipping, not sniping...) then<br/>
please delete the message from your reply.  I swapped one list I&#39;m on from<br/>
digest to regular, but may swap back if it gets moved off onelist.  Onelist<br/>
ain&#39;t the easiest format for digests!  But OE5 couldn&#39;t read the other style<br/>
of digests that I&#39;m familiar with, so we&#39;ll have to see...<br/>
