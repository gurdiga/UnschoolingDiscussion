<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084248053">Thank you for all of the responses. <br/>
<br/>
This is not something for me to make a stink about &quot;publicly&quot;.  I <br/>
know this family well, and a couple of them may use it as an <br/>
opportunity to make me look bad. I know this from past experiences. <br/>
So I may just go with the flow completly or I may go to the room for <br/>
a while and join the b-day party later.  It is an 80th b-day after <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Babysitting is  not a problem because the ages of our kids are: 16, <br/>
14 (almost 15), 12, 9 and 3.  We will just have to reserve two <br/>
adjoining rooms to accomoate us all, and maybe an ice chest for <br/>
drinks and snacks and we&#39;ll get some fast food for dinner.  Hopefully <br/>
there will be something for them to watch on the hotel movie <br/>
channel.  I&#39;ll make it fun for them. As for getting together with <br/>
their cousins who are around their age... my girls love the younger <br/>
ones, but the older ones are different than them.  These older girls <br/>
sneek out at night, the 16 year old dates a 19 year old, and think <br/>
it&#39;s cool that their friend attends a boarding school where she can <br/>
sneak her boyfriend in to spend the night. I do not worry about this <br/>
influencing them in anyway, it just bugs me.  Their older brother <br/>
committed suicide a few years ago.  It is just different than us. <br/>
It is too bad too, because when the older ones were kids, we would <br/>
vacation together and they got along great and had a wonderful time <br/>
together. Now I&#39;m getting off the subject, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for all your views on the matter.  I will turn this <br/>
into something fun for them and keep a positive outlook!<br/>
<br/>
