<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list.  We&#39;re from Louisa, Virginia with two life-long unschooled <br/>
children, ages 9 & 10.  We&#39;d like to spread the word about our homeschoolers&#39; <br/>
2003 spring camps in Virginia and would particularly like to have more unschoolers <br/>
come to our camps.  There&#39;s more information below and on our website.<br/>
