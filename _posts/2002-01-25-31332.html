My daughter, Chloe (ten yr today!!) asked when she was 2 1/2 to have violin<br/>
lessons. Of course (LOL) I said no, when you are older....My wiser mother<br/>
researched it and found a DSO Dertroit Symphony Orchestra member to instruct<br/>
her little one. Well, Chloe became an accomplished violinist, she loves the<br/>
music, plays her heart out, alone. She has never wanted to perform for<br/>
groups. She plays at retirement homes, she doesn&#39;t consider them a &quot;group&quot;<br/>
and in her room with our oldest, the celloist. I was wrong, she need not be<br/>
older, I only needed to be more open. I hope your granddaughter gets the<br/>
opportunity.<br/>
Mary- You sound so wonderful to take your son on a &quot;field trip&quot; to<br/>
explore.....an inspiration. Thank you, where are you going to visit?<br/>
Dawn, I too have felt picked on at times, please know you are supported in<br/>
one way or another, not everyone shares the same opinions. And I too have<br/>
misunderstood some posts. Keep posting.<br/>

I have a daughter who wants to play the violin. She&#39;s taken lessons, gotten <br/>
bored, and dropped the lessons.She didn&#39;t drop the violin, really, but her <br/>
progress dropped to an imperceptible level. She takes it out, occasionally, <br/>
plays stuff from her old beginning book and painstakingly picks out pieces <br/>
she absolutely loves - from musical theater. The process is very very very <br/>
slow. <br/>
<br/>
IF she had a teacher - which she wants, by the way - who would let her REALLY <br/>
pick her own music - even if it is far beyond her ability - she&#39;d stick with <br/>
it. What she wants is a teacher to help her out with the music she&#39;s <br/>
interested in playing - not a teacher to put her through her paces - <br/>
following the standard systematic progression through the standard lesson <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve talked to teachers. They say she&#39;s being lazy and that, if she wants to <br/>
play, she has to pay the same price they did - go through the required steps. <br/>
They say that if she doesn&#39;t have that self-discipline (or get it imposed by <br/>
me) that she won&#39;t be able to learn.<br/>

oriented, maybe someone who is a fiddler or something.  The teacher can <br/>
still help her avoid the habits that will interfere with most kinds of <br/>
playing, but it wouldn&#39;t need to be nearly as rigid.  For instance, <br/>
learning scales can really help a person&#39;s playing.  I&#39;m doing them now on <br/>
the cello because I want to make it easier to play what I want to <br/>
play.  But it certainly doesn&#39;t need to come first.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With all due respect, Tia, I truly believe (and I&#39;m probably in the minority<br/>
believing this, but I do anyhow) that you can learn any technique you need<br/>
from anything.   Look at it this way: there are 100&#39;s of method books out<br/>
there, and most teachers pick one they like.  And it works (at least to an<br/>
extent).  But every teacher picks a different one, and those work, too.  So<br/>
what difference would it make if Pam&#39;s daughter learned all her violin<br/>
technique from her favorite broadway showtunes or from an incredibly dull<br/>
tome like Dont, which is a great method book, should you like method books.<br/>
(I don&#39;t, and therefore I don&#39;t Dont!)  Just because the tunes are fun<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean she should play them badly and learn bad habits.  If she wants<br/>
to be a classical violinist someday, she&#39;ll end up having great musicianship<br/>
and music appreciation that a method book won&#39;t give her.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, since your daughter is into showtunes, you&#39;ll probably appreciate this<br/>
aside.  I&#39;ve played The Music Man enough times now to know it cold, but I<br/>
always have to laugh at the best joke in the show, in my mind, which is<br/>
musical, not verbal.  When Professor Harold Hill is getting everybody riled<br/>
up about having a boys&#39; band, he starts to sing the famous &quot;76 Trombones&quot;<br/>
song.  The very first time the tune is introduced, (76 Trombones led the big<br/>
parade, etc.), it&#39;s with voice and *violin*.  I love it.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re not at my house, or even in the same country I am right<br/>
now.  Because I am screaming very, very loudly.<br/>
<br/>
The kids who actually know what music they want to play, drag in stuff they<br/>
find at the mall, clunk through christmas carols or whatever, learn FASTER<br/>
than anybody else.  They learn the &quot;odd notes&quot; -- the ones you have to reach<br/>
outside your normal position to play -- because music doesn&#39;t care where the<br/>
notes fall on your violin, composers pick what sounds good to them.  And of<br/>
course if you already know the tune, it&#39;s so much easier to play it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll teach your daughter .... how many thousand miles did you say you were<br/>
from Germany?  &lt;g&gt;  I wonder if you can teach violin on email.......<br/>

&gt;they&#39;re taking your money for instruction, not for listening to them play.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep.  That&#39;s what I always end up thinking.  Which is why I end up teaching<br/>
1 half-hour lesson every hour.  I can&#39;t do it in 30 minutes anyway, and then<br/>
kids think *I* should play, too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for good ideas.  I need to remember to push students to tell me what<br/>
they like musically and what they want to play and haven&#39;t bothered to<br/>
mention.  And we both need to play at lessons.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Lately, I have to &quot;remind&quot; her to practice, and of her commitment, <br/>
 and it&#39;s becoming a real pain!  I&#39;ve told her that it is her choice <br/>
 to continue with the instrument or not, but if she&#39;s going to <br/>
 continue, practice is part of the package deal.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why is practice part of the package deal? I know that isn&#39;t the traditional <br/>
way to view this, but maybe she&#39;s getting exactly what she needs right now <br/>
from just the lessons.<br/>
When practice is required or pushed it becomes a chore/drudgery and the child <br/>
is going to quit getting what they need from it.<br/>
She may want to stop for a while. Don&#39;t push, don&#39;t cajole, let her use her <br/>
instrument in the way that best suits her needs. It should be about enjoyment <br/>
of making music, not shoulds and have to&#39;s.<br/>
That&#39;s the best way to ruin a joyful experience.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She mentions she wants to now play flute, but we shelled out big <br/>
bucks for the violin.  (Her best friend just changed from playing <br/>
piano to violin)  I am not willing to keep buying (or renting) <br/>
instruments because she&#39;s changing her mind like the weather.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
But isn&#39;t that what people call &quot;well rounded&quot;? I understand if you don&#39;t <br/>
have the money, but if there&#39;s any creative way to swing it, the more <br/>
instruments the BETTER!!<br/>
Collect instruments, let children dabble with them often, fill your home with <br/>
joyful sound and they will get joy from the process, instead of stress.<br/>
I am only speaking from personal experience.<br/>
Had my parents quit nagging me about lessons, I would have continued with my <br/>
instruments (flute and piano) much longer. I also would have come back to <br/>
them time and time again.<br/>
Learning an instrument is not necessarily a linear process. Most people like <br/>
to dabble and the learning comes in spurts (just like with other topics).<br/>
Be her assistant in this, it should always be their choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039647746">I&#39;m curious about the idea of &lt;really&gt; unschooling music.  For the last year <br/>
or so, I&#39;ve been wanting to learn to play piano, guitar, cello, steel drums <br/>
and some sort of wind instrument all at the same time!  I don&#39;t have time for <br/>
lessons or regular practice.  I want to just dabble and be able to play more <br/>
as time goes on.  I can read treble clef (played violin as a kid) so I can <br/>
tap out one hand on the piano.  I got the Mrs. Stewart&#39;s Piano Lesson book <br/>
from the old John Holt Bookstore thinking that would be what I&#39;m looking for. <br/>
 But it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s too sequential.  Feels like Bob books for piano &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
But I&#39;m interested in learning.  I just want to do it on my terms.  I think <br/>
about all that very schoolish stuff that almost always goes with lessons:  <br/>
emphasis on position so you don&#39;t develop &quot;bad habits&quot;  (&quot;you must hold your <br/>
pencil this way&quot;), scales (drills), practice, starting with boring vapid <br/>
stuff, sequential learning.<br/>
<br/>
I want the unschooling version.  What does that look like?  Does it really <br/>
matter if I don&#39;t use my little finger to play piano?  I know there must be <br/>
thousands of music learning myths out there, just as there are with reading <br/>
and writing.  But I guess I&#39;m a little awed by musicians and wonder if maybe <br/>
there are some truths/basics I really should know?  (I&#39;m not asking about <br/>
specifics, just whether there are any absolutes.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if there are any absolutes but what my son likes is finding<br/>
a song he wants to play, having someone play it for him, a demonstration,<br/>
and then play it himself from there.  He&#39;s not interested in anything<br/>
else right now but learning the songs he likes.   His first teacher let<br/>
him do this, she would play the next song in the music book and ask if he<br/>
liked it, if he did they&#39;d play it, if he didn&#39;t they&#39;d skip it and it<br/>
was ok if he changed his mind.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been collecting sheet music of songs he knows he likes already and<br/>
has learned on his own to play a few, but it&#39;s easier for him if he can<br/>
look at someone else play it first, just watch them, and the rest comes<br/>
to him more smoothly. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what his unschooling version of learning music looks like, but<br/>
it&#39;s hard to find folks who support his learning style.  Adult music<br/>
teachers here are so rigid.<br/>

<br/>
Well, that depends on what you want out of it.<br/>
A lot of the &quot;rules&quot; are for your own benefit, like piano fingering. Just <br/>
makes it easier to play a piece that covers more than a few notes.<br/>
But are you interested in playing well, or just goofing around?<br/>
I think one of the better methods of learning quickly and making an <br/>
instrument useful (at least with piano and guitar) is to learn chords.<br/>
You could be playing music that is familiar, very, very quickly and it helps <br/>
you understand the note combinations.<br/>
There are some absolutes of course, notes have names, there are positions on <br/>
the instrument that match those names, there are better methods than others <br/>
for producing sound, and music theory can be helpful (to a point). Knowing <br/>
what Fortissimo is could be helpful, or what a Fifth is....<br/>
But I think understanding what it is you want out of it will help you decide <br/>
how much you really want to know.<br/>
Get a book that teaches you chords, that&#39;s my advice. Then dabble and play to <br/>
your hearts content. When you reach a point that you need more, then a <br/>
teacher or another book can be sought out.<br/>
And read John Holt&#39;s &quot;Never too Late&quot; about him teaching himself violin.<br/>

cello, wasn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s taking violin/fiddle lessons, and last week Keith took her to the <br/>
lesson, I didn&#39;t.  The teacher told Holly if she didn&#39;t practice every day <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t get better.  Keith didn&#39;t argue.  Now today we don&#39;t know who&#39;s <br/>
going back, but Holly hasn&#39;t practiced.  I really don&#39;t want her shamed.  <br/>
Usually, I goof around with her, but I&#39;ve been mostly in the bed with my foot <br/>
up, doped up some, or watching a movie, or snoozing, or reading.  I can&#39;t do <br/>
what I usually do.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m grumpy and will, next time I can get around enough to do so, take the <br/>
teacher some unschooling information, tell her I am  unwilling to compromise, <br/>
and risk having her either learn something new or say Holly&#39;s not a good <br/>
student for her anymore.<br/>

I would say more now, but my foot wants back on its pillow.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pam T.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dear Pam,<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t be awed by musicians.  We&#39;re just like everybody else, only a<br/>
fair bit wierder!  &lt;g&gt;  I was &quot;properly trained&quot; on cello and piano, and<br/>
learned violin by myself.  Guess which one I have the most fun playing....!<br/>
Here&#39;s the absolutes I can think of:<br/>
<br/>
1.  You have to spend time playing.  Call it practicing if you like, but you<br/>
don&#39;t get any better if you don&#39;t spend time with the instrument.<br/>
<br/>
2.  You get better faster with some sort of advice.  Find somebody who&#39;s<br/>
better than you, and go see them periodically.  Lots of people like to do<br/>
this weekly, but if semi-annually is better for you, fine.  (I&#39;ve had 3<br/>
violin lessons in 5 years, and like it that way, thanks!)<br/>
<br/>
3.  You get better a whole lot faster if you think about what you do.<br/>
Practicing with a comic book on the music stand instead of music (like I did<br/>
in middle school) does not help!  Thinking about how you feel and whether<br/>
what you&#39;re doing feels good or bad, natural or unatural, comfortable or<br/>
uncomfortable, and what you can do to improve the things you don&#39;t like<br/>
helps a whole lot.  (In my experience, most people get steps 1 & 2 and<br/>
totally miss this one.)<br/>
<br/>
4.  No matter how good you get, there will always be somebody younger and<br/>
better.  So what.  If you&#39;re not in it for the fun of it, get out!<br/>
<br/>
5.  Just like anything else, you will learn by leaps and plateaus.  Some<br/>
days it&#39;s hard to pick up the music because you feel stuck in the desert and<br/>
it&#39;s too hard.  This too shall eventually pass; see #1!<br/>
<br/>
6.  Music notation is a system of writing.  It&#39;s not any more complicated<br/>
than regular writing, but it has different rules.  Learn the rules and your<br/>
life is easier.  However, there is lots of learning that can be done outside<br/>

How&#39;s that?  I&#39;ve always wondered if one could teach cello by email; wanna<br/>
try?  ;)  I love your list -- which wind instrument?  Someday I&#39;m going to<br/>
learn oboe; it&#39;s been on my list since college.  Have fun!<br/>

Yes it does. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;although it&#39;s not the <br/>

<br/>
Except for what you can call it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think instruments are hard to learn well without some kind of teacher at <br/>
some point.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think if you&#39;re trying to learn saxophone, you can watch others play, but <br/>
somewhere at the beginning somebody (another reeds player) might have to talk <br/>
to you about soaking the reed, and how to put it on.  OR you could read it in <br/>
a book, or get a video tape.  But the book or video tape won&#39;t say &quot;tilt this <br/>
at an angle a little bit and it will be 100% easier.&quot;  (&quot;This&quot; being chin or <br/>
wrist or thumb.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve helped people get over a hump with recorder-playing problems by e-mail <br/>
or phone, because I&#39;ve done it a long time and helped other people play.  I <br/>
hate to &quot;teach music.&quot;  I&#39;m not very good at it at all, or else I don&#39;t want <br/>
to help people who want the weekly spoonfeeding that &quot;teaching music&quot; can be. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
But I think once someone asks someone to teach them to play recorder, or <br/>
guitar, or piano, and they follow that person&#39;s step-by-step, if they go back <br/>
any more than twice or so, they need to give up the &quot;self taught&quot; business.<br/>
<br/>
I konw there are degrees.  Someone might say &quot;self taught&quot; about creative <br/>
writing if he took years of English classes but none were called &quot;creative <br/>
writing.&quot;  Or someone might be a self-taught backhoe operator if he just got <br/>
on one and someone said &quot;this does that, that does this, practice in this <br/>
sand pit,&quot; instead of taking a backhoe certification course.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between an artist who becomes an artist and one who just takes <br/>
art classes, or the difference between a pianist and a piano student is <br/>
likely to have to do with how much they did beyond and above the class <br/>
assignments.<br/>
<br/>
Doing extra makes you &quot;real&quot; but it doesn&#39;t make you self-taught.<br/>

I was told &quot;you only have to practice on the days you eat&quot; (S. Suzuki&#39;s<br/>
favorite) and &quot;if you practice every day, you will eventually get better&quot;.<br/>
I practiced every day and got tendonitis.  You can practice mindlessly every<br/>
day and learn terrible habits, and you can practice twice a week, thinking<br/>
about what you&#39;re doing and how it feels and improve dramatically.  It&#39;s<br/>
probably true that if you practice every single day and really concentrate<br/>
every time, you&#39;ll get better a LOT faster, but I&#39;ve never been in the mood<br/>
to test that theory...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been teacher-less since I finished grad school over a decade ago.  I<br/>
practice on days I need to.  I practice to learn music, or because I really<br/>
just feel like playing.  I do NOT practice every day.  In fact, I have 2<br/>
degrees in music and I&#39;ve rarely practiced every day.  I hate practicing!<br/>

This is an interesting thread going here, and I know this isn&#39;t about<br/>
music, but it is about practicing.  My 7yo son&#39;s karate instructor was<br/>
asking me today about his practicing habits (he&#39;s not advancing fast<br/>
enough for her) and I started remembering all the posts on music going<br/>
around lately.  So I said, &quot;Well, when I remind him to practice it<br/>
upsets him and makes him feel as if I am nagging him, so I asked him if<br/>
he wanted me to do that anymore and he said no.  If he&#39;s advancing<br/>
slowly it&#39;s his choice to do that.  I&#39;m not concerned with him getting<br/>
ahead I just want him to enjoy himself out there.&quot;  I don&#39;t think, from<br/>
the look on her face, that any parent has ever said that before.  She<br/>
said ok and went out on the floor to teach 5 homeschoolers how to spar.<br/>
I turned around and was greeted with applause by all the homeschooling<br/>
moms there!<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the thread, it&#39;s helped this family.<br/>

<br/>
We told the acting teacher that, too.  That Holly was there just to have fun, <br/>
and all the school examples were wasted and any school-style shaming was <br/>
going against what we believed.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the fiddle teacher wants us to &quot;get our money&#39;s worth,&quot; with Holly <br/>
advancing at a quick clip.  We will NOT get our money&#39;s worth if Holly is <br/>
treated as a school kid.  I&#39;m sure she&#39;s never heard anyone say &quot;We&#39;ll pay <br/>
you for Holly to do her practicing here; leave her alone about practicing at <br/>
home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And she might have no interest in parents who encourage slacking.<br/>
