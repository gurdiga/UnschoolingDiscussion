One thing that helps is not to say anything - don&#39;t point it out. Just <br/>
prepare something quickly -- if he&#39;s already started to sink, maybe do it a <br/>
bit more attractively than usual (instead of handing him an apple and a chunk <br/>
of cheese, slice up an apple and sprinkle it with a bit of cinnamon-sugar and <br/>
decorate with curls of string cheese, for example). Put it out near where he <br/>
is - so he can&#39;t miss it - but don&#39;t make a point of it. (Trust him to learn, <br/>
over time, how much better he feels and functions if he eats.)<br/>
<br/>
Also- sometimes something substantial is what they really NEED at that point, <br/>
but they&#39;ve let it go too far and something substantial seems too heavy to <br/>
them. So - some frozen grapes or sliced apples or a little box of raisins or <br/>
something like that - quick fruit sugar - can get them feeling just enough <br/>
better to be willing to go ahead and eat a sandwich or something else with <br/>
some protein.<br/>
