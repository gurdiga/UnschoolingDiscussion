&gt; she puts nearly all her time and energy into musical theater and some<br/>
&gt; would see that as too one-dimensional or something. Last night I bought<br/>
&gt; her the boxed set of dvd&#39;s of Broadway: the American Musical -- which<br/>
&gt; recently showed on PBS. The DVD&#39;s have, of course, hours of extras. It<br/>
&gt; was $60 and my friend was surprised I&#39;d spend that on such a thing.<br/>
&gt; Would somebody hesitate to pay that for an advanced astronomy series<br/>
&gt; for a kid who was into rocket science? They&#39;d think that was a bargain.<br/>

DVDs, CDs, and the book. And we don&#39;t have a lot of extra $$ these days. We<br/>
LOVED the series and honestly, I can&#39;t figure out why everyone wouldn&#39;t see<br/>
why knowing about the history of musical theater is just as important as the<br/>
history of the Depression or the labor movement. It IS part of the history<br/>
of those things anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Now my list of movies to see is so much longer though......<br/>

Not sure if it has any content different than the dvd&#39;s. At least I got <br/>
some exercise!! (It weighs about 10 pounds, I think.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be interested to know whether it seems to be just a print version <br/>
of the dvd&#39;s or if it has additional material - let me know after you <br/>
guys spend some time with both!!<br/>

According to a segment on KCRW the book does indeed contain extra material,<br/>
and the DVD&#39;s contain 5 or 6 hours more material than the TV presentation.<br/>
