<div><font face="HoratioDMed" color="#000080">I have an 8yo and 6yo twins.........we 
started unschooling about 4 months ago after 2 years of trying to do &quot;school&quot; 
although it was still a very relaxed atmosphere.&nbsp; My kids still ask me 
every day when we are going to &quot;do school&quot; which I have to chuckle about and 
explain again how we are &quot;doing school&quot; every day.&nbsp; My 8yo is behind in 
math and I&#39;m not worried about it persay, but he certainly is and wants to learn 
his add/sub and multiplication facts better and quicker.&nbsp; I have tried a 
lot of math programs out there over the years............Horizons, MMM, Miquon,

I would love some suggestions on how to help him learn these facts 
better......I&#39;m looking at Math U See and Miquon for my younger ones 
maybe.&nbsp; Would love some input on what you think of these or more

<br>Hmmm . . . wish I was there in your living room with the 8 yo. &nbsp;He wants to 
<br>have the basic math facts memorized better -- faster? &nbsp;Math Blaster CDs are a 
<br>good series of CD-Rom games that offer a lot of drill/practice. &nbsp;Or does he 
<br>maybe need to use them in real-life activities -- like building something or 
<br>cooking or what would he enjoy that would use a few of these math facts?? &nbsp;Or 
<br>does he maybe need to try the next level up of some fun-type game that uses 
<br>geometry (Math Blaster Geometry for example) or play a CD game called Math in 
<br>the Real World (a rock band travels around and has to use math to get through 
<br>their trip -- figuring money for meals or gas, etc.). &nbsp;Or maybe move away 
<br>from the drill type stuff and get into more fun games like Logical Journey of 
<br>the Zoombinis or Rollercoaster Tycoon (build your own theme park). &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Or not.
<br>
<br>Wish I was there. &nbsp;I&#39;m curious to see what he thinks the situation is. &nbsp;Is he 
<br>&quot;bad at math&quot; or &quot;good at math&quot; -- which do you think he would say? &nbsp;Does he 
<br>enjoy the ideas but hasn&#39;t memorized the facts? &nbsp;Or does he not get the 
<br>concepts? &nbsp;Or something else? &nbsp;Does he understand that memorization of the 
<br>arithmetic facts is the least interesting part of the mathematics -- a tool 
<br>to explore other ideas -- like statistics or logic or sciences or science 
<br>experiments or baseball stats -- that they are just there to help him do 
<br>whatever he wants to?
<br>
<br>Real-life unschooling experiences to reinforce what he does know or help the 
<br>random facts &quot;stick&quot; -- cook something and measure and you will understand 
<br>better what fractions are -- or help Dad set some tile -- area makes sense. &nbsp;
<br>Or not -- my son is not the touchy-feely math type -- explain it to him, 
<br>write it down on a piece of paper. &nbsp;When he needs to use an idea, he will -- 
<br>but not one second before!
<br>
<br>Money is a good way to practice real-life math too -- simple multiplication 
<br>facts, etc.
<br>
<br>Wish I was there. &nbsp;I think this is interesting.

<br>
<br>
<br>Well, my interest is real. &nbsp;We enjoy math around here (today&#39;s highlight was 
<br>a discussion that came from my son&#39;s questions about how to run a retail 
<br>store -- a store that sells TVs -- and all the costs you might have and what 
<br>your profit would be -- this talk would not have been possible without math 
<br>-- it&#39;s a good tool!) and it is interesting and frustrating to me to see a 
<br>bright boy like your son getting stuck on not liking it.
<br>
<br>I have been thinking about your note and, please don&#39;t take offense, but I 
<br>don&#39;t think this is so much his problem.
<br>
<br>I am thinking that your son learns differently from you. &nbsp;This makes it hard 
<br>for you to accept that he is actually learning (enough) when doing things 
<br>like Legos or doing math in his head. &nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t see any &quot;proof&quot; -- or not 
<br>as much as you might be expecting.
<br>
<br>This is just my guess from your comments. &nbsp;And others will probably pipe up 
<br>with descriptions of different types of learners -- visual/spatial vs. the 
<br>other kind -- I can never keep it all straight.
<br>
<br>But it seems like that is part of it to me.
<br>
<br>Background info: &nbsp;I have two children -- a 7 1/2 yo boy and a 6 yo girl. &nbsp;The 
<br>boy -- I get him -- I see how he thinks -- he hates to write things down -- 
<br>he does as much as he can in his head -- he likes a clear, straight-forward, 
<br>cut to the chase answer, he is meticulous, detailed, perfectionist -- he is 
<br>impatient with slowness of any kind (but very kind on a personal level so 
<br>that&#39;s sort of misleading) -- but he won&#39;t tolerate any sort of repetition. &nbsp;
<br>The girl -- oh my goodness -- where did this child come from! &nbsp;We do OK I 
<br>guess -- she is flourishing -- but I am barely able to see how she does what 
<br>she does. &nbsp;She cannot read a story, for instance, without many stops along 
<br>the way to discuss what should have happened, what will happen, etc. &nbsp;Given a 
<br>box full of various craft supplies she will create something in 10 minutes 
<br>that I could not make in a week and wouldn&#39;t have thought of anyway. &nbsp;She has 
<br>an interest in fiction -- son will barely touch the stuff. &nbsp;He eats math up 
<br>and we are really in a bored-with-it-all but not-quite-ready-for-Algebra-yet 
<br>stage. &nbsp;She is a beginning reader. &nbsp;He was reading everything at 4 1/2. &nbsp;She 
<br>likes math but would much prefer to use blocks and do mazes and puzzles than 
<br>look at a book of any kind. &nbsp;Etc. &nbsp;Just today I was telling my Mom that it is 
<br>as if they have a meeting and decide to react to any given situation in 
<br>exactly opposite ways! &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Anyway, I get him. &nbsp;Most of the time, I have no idea where she is coming 
<br>from. &nbsp;I am really winging it with her!
<br>
<br>So, after all that . . . hmmm. &nbsp;Maybe your son needs to de-emphasize to 
<br>himself how important all this memorizing is. &nbsp;If he gets the concepts, and 
<br>he has a calculator, and he just does things for the next few years, these 
<br>facts will be repeated enough times to actually be a part of his memory 
<br>without having to sit down and repeat them a million times. &nbsp;Which isn&#39;t 
<br>going to work too well anyway, imo. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Which reminds me -- what is it that he gets frustrated doing -- games or 
<br>worksheets or what?
<br>
<br>Also, one thing we did, if you take a big sheet of the mult tables, and mark 
<br>out the ones he already knows (the 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 10s) and then 
<br>eliminate all the repeats (the good old commutative property) he may be 
<br>suprised to see how much he already knows and how little there is left to 
<br>memorize. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Then, some of the CDs, when set to the right level, will use the higher-end 
<br>problems, and that might be enough repetition to get thru.
<br>
<br>Not writing stuff down -- this is my son to a T. &nbsp;(Of course, daughter loves 
<br>to write -- was just this AM writing down a &quot;secret note&quot; about her brother 
<br>-- write crayon on black paper -- very spooky!! ooooooo). &nbsp;So, he doesn&#39;t 
<br>write a lot. &nbsp;And the world keeps turning. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>He recently had to do a short essay, for instance, for a Tae Kwon Do test. &nbsp;
<br>He enjoyed the thinking part and came up with some good ideas but dictated 
<br>what to type to me. &nbsp;If I had insisted that he had to write it by hand, no 
<br>way. &nbsp;We told the TKD teacher this was what we were doing.
<br>
<br>Sorry to be so rambling . .

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774375556"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I wrote a newsletter about unschooling math. 
<br>Here is the opening blurb ... you can find the rest of it here:
<br>http://www.homeschool-tips.com/RscNLV.asp?year=2001&amp;month=2&amp;day=2
<br>There are *zillions* of math resource ideas! :o)
<br>
<br>
<br>**Math. One of the two subjects that will put fear into even the most veteran 
<br>homeschooler. (Science, which we will cover next month, is the other.) And 
<br>why shouldn`t it? &quot;What do you do for math and science?&quot; is the second 
<br>question (right behind &quot;How do they socialize?&quot;) people ask when they find 
<br>out you homeschool. Is teaching math that hard? Is it something we should 
<br>fear? Do we have to be an engineer, or an engineering/math/physics professor 
<br>to teach math to our children? 
<br>No! But... I have picked the brain of someone who happens to be all of those 
<br>... and so much more! Her name is JoAnn, and I think if you ask her, she will 
<br>tell you the job title she is most proud of is Homeschooling Mom to Katie.**

<div><font face="HoratioDMed" color="#000080">I think you make some excellent points 
Nance.&nbsp; I think trying to de-emphasize the importance of memorizing the 
facts might help.&nbsp; He gets frustrated when trying to figure out a problem 
in his head and he gets the wrong answer so I&#39;m not sure I can do much about 
that.&nbsp; Someone mentioned having a chart with the facts up on the wall while 
he does &quot;math&quot; or works on his computer games so he can refer to it for speed in 
the game and eventually after seeing it over and over he&#39;ll memorize them 
without even thinking about it........see any merit in that philosophy???&nbsp; 
I think some of the problem is definitely me......I have a hard time letting go 
of the math.......everything else is fine, but math I seem to keep feeling the 
need to push....or create experiences so maybe with me letting go a bit and him 
lightning up a bit on himself it will work itself out.</font></div>
<div><font face="HoratioDMed" color="#000080">I do have another concern that you 
might have some input on, it seems that most unschoolers I hear from about math 
and such have young kids and seem to have the &quot;when they need it, they&#39;ll learn 
it&quot; philosophy down pat........but I&#39;m curious about people on the other side, 
with older kids if that is truly what happens or not.&nbsp; I sure would love to 
hear from people with older kids, looking back that let them learn math on their 
own and see how they approached it and if the kids did indeed learn it as they 
needed it.</font></div>

<div><font face="Pooh">Nancy,</font></div>
<div><font face="Pooh">You aren&#39;t rambling. This is very interesting to me. I&#39;m 
learning what makes Naomi tick. I mean, she has been in school up until this 
year (4th grade) and I never really took the time to learn what she likes to do 
and doesn&#39;t. I guess this mom got a crash course in the last 7 weeks! She hates 
repitition, likes to write but will write whenever she wants...doesn&#39;t care for 
cursive much...knows how to do it, but doesnt like being &#39;forced&#39; to do it every 
day on every single subject (that was one of her pet peeves in ps), loves music 
and is very musical, loves to dance to music, is very expressive physically. 
Will hug when she wants to and will sometimes give me one if I ask for 
one...loves math, but not the repitition. She already knows how to use a cash 
register, can figure in her mind how much change to give back (thanks to friends 
that taught her how to do it in a coffee shop), doesn&#39;t like me trying to 
explain things to her (her favorite phrase lately is I&#39;m not stupid!...which I 
despair of her ever to stop saying), loves watching disney especially the 
morning runs where they do the little kidlet shows with different learning stuff 
like in the box and is developing rapidly...very conscious of her body changes, 
very private and will not allow me anywhere near when getting dressed...but 
still likes to have me sit with her in the bathroom when taking a bath and still 
WONT run her own bath water. She is a contradiction of child and pre-teen and it 
is scary at times and surprising at others. I guess with this one, since I 
didn&#39;t grow up with her sister (summer visits only) I&#39;m learning what it means 
to be a child and pre-teen all at once.</font></div>

  TVs -- and all the costs you might have and what <br>your profit would be -- 
  this talk would not have been possible without math <br>-- it&#39;s a good tool!) 
  and it is interesting and frustrating to me to see a <br>bright boy like your 
  son getting stuck on not liking it. <br><br>I have been thinking about your 
  note and, please don&#39;t take offense, but I <br>don&#39;t think this is so much his 
  problem. <br><br>I am thinking that your son learns differently from you. 
  &nbsp;This makes it hard <br>for you to accept that he is actually learning 
  (enough) when doing things <br>like Legos or doing math in his head. 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t see any &quot;proof&quot; -- or not <br>as much as you might be 
  expecting. <br><br>This is just my guess from your comments. &nbsp;And others 
  will probably pipe up <br>with descriptions of different types of learners -- 
  visual/spatial vs. the <br>other kind -- I can never keep it all straight. 
  <br><br>But it seems like that is part of it to me. <br><br>Background info: 
  &nbsp;I have two children -- a 7 1/2 yo boy and a 6 yo girl. &nbsp;The <br>boy 
  -- I get him -- I see how he thinks -- he hates to write things down -- <br>he 
  does as much as he can in his head -- he likes a clear, straight-forward, 
  <br>cut to the chase answer, he is meticulous, detailed, perfectionist -- he 
  is <br>impatient with slowness of any kind (but very kind on a personal level 
  so <br>that&#39;s sort of misleading) -- but he won&#39;t tolerate any sort of 
  repetition. &nbsp; <br>The girl -- oh my goodness -- where did this child come 
  from! &nbsp;We do OK I <br>guess -- she is flourishing -- but I am barely able 
  to see how she does what <br>she does. &nbsp;She cannot read a story, for 
  instance, without many stops along <br>the way to discuss what should have 
  happened, what will happen, etc. &nbsp;Given a <br>box full of various craft 
  supplies she will create something in 10 minutes <br>that I could not make in 
  a week and wouldn&#39;t have thought of anyway. &nbsp;She has <br>an interest in 
  fiction -- son will barely touch the stuff. &nbsp;He eats math up <br>and we 
  are really in a bored-with-it-all but not-quite-ready-for-Algebra-yet 
  <br>stage. &nbsp;She is a beginning reader. &nbsp;He was reading everything at 
  4 1/2. &nbsp;She <br>likes math but would much prefer to use blocks and do 
  mazes and puzzles than <br>look at a book of any kind. &nbsp;Etc. &nbsp;Just 
  today I was telling my Mom that it is <br>as if they have a meeting and decide 
  to react to any given situation in <br>exactly opposite ways! &nbsp; 
  <br><br>Anyway, I get him. &nbsp;Most of the time, I have no idea where she is 
  coming <br>from. &nbsp;I am really winging it with her! <br><br>So, after all 
  that . . . hmmm. &nbsp;Maybe your son needs to de-emphasize to <br>himself how 
  important all this memorizing is. &nbsp;If he gets the concepts, and <br>he 
  has a calculator, and he just does things for the next few years, these 
  <br>facts will be repeated enough times to actually be a part of his memory 
  <br>without having to sit down and repeat them a million times. &nbsp;Which 
  isn&#39;t <br>going to work too well anyway, imo. &nbsp; <br><br>Which reminds me 
  -- what is it that he gets frustrated doing -- games or <br>worksheets or 
  what? <br><br>Also, one thing we did, if you take a big sheet of the mult 
  tables, and mark <br>out the ones he already knows (the 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 
  10s) and then <br>eliminate all the repeats (the good old commutative 
  property) he may be <br>suprised to see how much he already knows and how 
  little there is left to <br>memorize. &nbsp; <br><br>Then, some of the CDs, 
  when set to the right level, will use the higher-end <br>problems, and that 
  might be enough repetition to get thru. <br><br>Not writing stuff down -- this 
  is my son to a T. &nbsp;(Of course, daughter loves <br>to write -- was just 
  this AM writing down a &quot;secret note&quot; about her brother <br>-- write crayon on 
  black paper -- very spooky!! ooooooo). &nbsp;So, he doesn&#39;t <br>write a lot. 
  &nbsp;And the world keeps turning. &nbsp; <br><br>He recently had to do a 
  short essay, for instance, for a Tae Kwon Do test. &nbsp; <br>He enjoyed the 
  thinking part and came up with some good ideas but dictated <br>what to type 
  to me. &nbsp;If I had insisted that he had to write it by hand, no <br>way. 
  &nbsp;We told the TKD teacher this was what we were doing. <br><br>Sorry to be 
  so rambling . . <br><br>Nance <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font><br><br><tt>Message

<br>Thanks for being reassuring! &nbsp;As I said earlier today somewhere else, I will

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353781467">I think that is a great idea for anyone who WANTS to work on math facts. <br/>
Decades ago, I worked at a Dairy Queen.  We didn&#39;t have cash registers,<br/>
just a cash drawer and a pad of paper.  For YEARS after I quit working<br/>
there I remembered the price of most of the menu items, just from using<br/>
those prices over and over.  They also taught us to make change by<br/>
counting UP from the order total.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a computer game that someone gave me with your choice of horse<br/>
or car race.  The faster you answer your arithmatic facts, the faster<br/>
your car or horse goes.  It&#39;s called quarter mile math.  My dd rarely<br/>
plays it, but I think it could be useful for a kid who wanted to practice<br/>
in order to get faster.<br/>

&lt;snip&gt;Someone mentioned having a chart with the facts up on the wall<br/>
while he does &quot;math&quot; or works on his computer games so he can refer to it<br/>
for speed in the game and eventually after seeing it over and over he&#39;ll<br/>
memorize them without even thinking about it........see any merit in that<br/>
philosophy???</div>
