<div id="ygrps-yiv-729656467">It&#39;s possible that the school wouldn&#39;t take kids who hadn&#39;t willingly visited <br/>
and signed up themselves.  Where Kirby goes, the kids have to sign an <br/>
agreement concerning behavior and intent.  They won&#39;t take a child against <br/>
the child&#39;s will (so they wouldn&#39;t be able to sell gift memberships to <br/>
not-yet-members/students).<br/>
<br/>
Some schools stress tournaments and competitions and others don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Some are more interested in character building than in butt-kicking.<br/>
<br/>
I would say without even leaving the house you could read the ads in the <br/>
yellow pages--how do the schools present themselves?  You&#39;ll note differences <br/>
right away.<br/>
<br/>
You could look on line for overall descriptions of the philosophies of <br/>
different associations.  Many times local schools are affiliated with one or <br/>
another national or international association.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a local martial-arts supply house in town (like a store that <br/>
sells gear for the different sports) you might ask the purveyor (who is <br/>
likely also a martial arts teacher) about the differences in the types of <br/>
martial arts.<br/>
<br/>
One thing you could do as it&#39;s a gift would be to promise to pay for lessons <br/>
and a good uniform.  In some schools you can get the basic cheap uniform <br/>
which will be cotton/polyester blend, or you can opt for a better all-cotton <br/>
uniform.<br/>
