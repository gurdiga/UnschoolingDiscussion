<div id="ygrps-yiv-341703177">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a story that ran a few days ago in a major Japanese paper on that <br/>
all-too-frequent phenomenon known in Japan as *gakkyu hokai*, or <br/>
breakdown of order in school classrooms.<br/>
<br/>
The following article covers a seminar on this issue that was recently <br/>
held in Tokyo, and touches upon how other countries have dealt with -- or <br/>
not dealt with -- classroom breakdown on their own home turfs.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

STUDENTS NEED AN OUTLET FOR THEIR EMOTIONS<br/>
<br/>
The problem of &#39;classroom breakdown&#39; is rooted<br/>
in children&#39;s growing sense of powerlessness,<br/>
say education experts.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Gone are the days when teachers conducted lessons with confidence and <br/>
students listened to them with respect.<br/>
<br/>
Today, many schoolteachers in Japan -- from elementary schools to high <br/>
schools, in the city and countryside alike -- say that class management <br/>
is more difficult, with some students walking out, resorting to violence <br/>
or chatting among themselves during what are supposed to be study periods.<br/>
<br/>
The phenomenon is so disturbing that it has even been given a name of its <br/>
own: *gakkyu hokai* (classroom breakdown). <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Beyond Classroom Breakdown,&quot; an international symposium held on Sept. 22 <br/>
in Tokyo, focused on this widespread problem.<br/>
<br/>
Karol DeFalco, a panelist from the United States, said: &quot;Rather than <br/>
trying to fit the children into a mold that suits our schools, (let&#39;s) <br/>
think about changing the schools to fit the needs of the students.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DeFalco, who works to facilitate social development programs in New <br/>
Haven, Connecticut, was addressing the 700 people who filled Tokyo&#39;s <br/>
Yurakucho Asahi Hall to capacity last month.<br/>
<br/>
Changing the curriculum to meet the students&#39; needs is exactly what <br/>
DeFalco&#39;s team has been doing in New Haven -- a city of 130,000 people. <br/>
To cope with the problem of classroom disorder, the city&#39;s Board of <br/>
Education in the 1980s set up a special team to identify and tackle the <br/>
underlying causes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Behind the problem were changes in students&#39; attitudes and behavior,&quot; <br/>
she said. It took a year for the team -- consisting of 75 community <br/>
members, including teachers, university professors, students and parents <br/>
-- to identify why some students were behaving in ways that were holding <br/>
back their academic and personal progress.<br/>
<br/>
The study found that students rated poorly in self-awareness, stress <br/>
management, ability to control their impulses, problem-solving and <br/>
communication skills. As these findings came to light, courses were <br/>
developed to fulfill their needs.<br/>
<br/>
Pretend to be 6 years old<br/>
<br/>
The new social skills course was first tested in DeFalco&#39;s class. &quot;For <br/>
half a year, I gave up 45 minutes each day to teach social skills,&quot; she <br/>
said. Changes in her students&#39; attitudes and improvement in academic <br/>
performances led to the course being extended to all the city&#39;s public <br/>
schools. Now, said DeFalco, &quot;it&#39;s not a support program; it is part of <br/>
the curriculum from elementary school through high school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DeFalco asked audience members to imagine they were a class and she was <br/>
their teacher, to give them a feel for how her classes work. Everyone was <br/>
asked to pretend to be the 6-year-old boy who was the protagonist in the <br/>
story she read aloud.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In this story he is going to share with you some of his feelings,&quot; she <br/>
began.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;Yesterday, my class went on a trip to the nature center, and I was so <br/>
excited,&#39;&quot; she read, and asked the audience to show excitement on their <br/>
faces. As the story went on, her commands had them looking &quot;scared,&quot; <br/>
&quot;embarrassed&quot; and &quot;relieved&quot; in turn.<br/>
<br/>
She said that sharing feelings in this way helped students understand one <br/>
another better. In the actual class, &quot;facial expressions&quot; lessons are <br/>
followed by homework assignments, sometimes with simple instructions such <br/>
as: &quot;Look at other people&#39;s faces in the cafeteria.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These and other lessons are an everyday event throughout the school year, <br/>
and through them children learn how to empathize and solve problems, she <br/>
added.<br/>
<br/>
Another panelist -- Naoki Ogi, an education critic and former junior high <br/>
school teacher -- reported that one in six elementary schools in Tokyo <br/>
faces classroom breakdown, quoting a survey of 1,388 elementary schools.<br/>
<br/>
Having visited hundreds of schools during the past seven years, he said <br/>
he had seen for himself that classroom breakdown was not only widespread <br/>
but complex in its causes.<br/>
<br/>
*Gakkyu hokai* first attracted media attention around 1996. But three <br/>
years earlier, Ogi had noticed that some Tokyo teachers were beginning to <br/>
report that &quot;panic boys,&quot; youths turning violent in class, were on the <br/>
increase.<br/>
<br/>
With today&#39;s stressful social climate, he told the symposium, children <br/>
are losing hope for their future.<br/>
<br/>
Still, Ogi was not completely pessimistic, telling his listeners: &quot;In the <br/>
coming century, classroom breakdown will provide an opportunity to <br/>
rebuild adult-child relationships: they will be working as equal partners.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If we apply this concept to the building of a school community, children <br/>
will be able to participate in actual school management.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The notion of &quot;children&#39;s active participation in class&quot; -- let alone <br/>
school management -- is not a present-day reality in the Republic of <br/>
Korea (South Korea), according to another speaker, Yoon Chul-Kyoung, a <br/>
researcher with the Korea National Youth Development Institute.<br/>
<br/>
A government survey of classroom breakdown for which Yoon conducted <br/>
research found that 60 percent of teachers at junior and senior high <br/>
schools were thinking of quitting. Another striking discovery was that 67 <br/>
percent of teachers said the most effective solution to class breakdown <br/>
was to give teachers more authority.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Korean teachers&#39; tendency to cling to their authority will only make it <br/>
harder to reach a solution,&quot; commented Yoon. &quot;We need to see things <br/>
through children&#39;s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Disorder in schools, having first surfaced among high school students in <br/>
(South) Korea sometime in the 1990s, is now spreading to elementary <br/>
schools,&quot; said Yoon.<br/>
<br/>
Yoon also pointed to rigidity in the nation&#39;s curricula, lamenting: &quot;Most <br/>
of our curricula are designed to make lessons a one-way street.&quot; But she <br/>
voiced the hope that Korean children, adopting a flexible approach, might <br/>
reform the school environment.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Opening the school&quot; is one solution, said Mayumi Ujioka, an editorial <br/>
writer for Asahi Shimbun who acted as a moderator of the symposium. <br/>
Panelists also offered hints on reducing teachers&#39; stress levels and <br/>
revitalizing school communities.<br/>
<br/>
Ask parents to help out<br/>
<br/>
Ikuo Komatsu, director of the Educational Management Research Department <br/>
at Japan&#39;s National Institute for Educational Research, said that in <br/>
Britain parents, schools and the community at large were cooperating <br/>
closely to restore order in the publicly funded school system.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;(In Britain) teachers protect their own rest time by hiring the parents <br/>
to take care of children&#39;s safety,&quot; he said. He also advised: &quot;Trust in <br/>
children&#39;s resilience.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Akira Yoshida issued a challenge to those attending the session. Yoshida, <br/>
deputy director of pediatrics at the Japan Red Cross Wakayama Medical <br/>
Center, also heads a group called Kinokuni Kodomo Support Net, which <br/>
focuses on the well-being and education of the young.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why not ask ourselves, each of us, what we can do to overcome classroom <br/>
breakdown? Teachers, please ask for help and say: &#39;I have such and such <br/>
problems in my class but I can&#39;t solve them all by myself.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Parents, ask yourselves what sort of school you want for your children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ogi proposed that more than two teachers should be responsible for each <br/>
class at elementary school: &quot;Not only does this reduce the burden on each <br/>
teacher but it gives the children the sense that many teachers are united <br/>
in taking care of them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Among those busy taking notes at the symposium was Shiro Yasuda, a <br/>
retired principal from the town of Takahata, Yamagata Prefecture, three <br/>
hours outside Tokyo on the Tohoku Shinkansen line. &quot;Schools in a <br/>
peaceful, close-knit community like my town may soon be seeing classroom <br/>
breakdown, too. My sympathies are with teachers who can no longer provide <br/>
a traditional education,&quot; he told this reporter.<br/>
<br/>
Yoshie Ishiwata, who teaches elementary school in the Tokyo suburb of <br/>
Higashi Murayama, was struck by the U.S. educationist DeFalco&#39;s advice <br/>
that schools need to adapt to children&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I will think about what I can do here and now (toward that end),&quot; she <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
Hiroko Ichinose, a part-time teacher from Saitama Prefecture, said she <br/>
liked the idea, advocated by many panelists, of schools calling on <br/>
&quot;outside resources.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But she said there was a big stumbling block: &quot;In reality, it&#39;s not easy <br/>
to discuss your classroom problems even with the teacher next door.&quot;<br/>
