<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>21 Dec 2002, at 11:17am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856792327">My 7 year old was invited multiple times this week to go to a movie with her friend today.<br/>
<br/>
We made sure to tell the family that we would not home until after 1 or 1:30 bec. of a swim meet this morning.<br/>
<br/>
We got home to discover they went without her.  They didn&#39;t even leave a message to let her know that they were going to do that or why.<br/>
<br/>
I even spoke with the grandfather on Thursday afternoon.  There was no indication that this was going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
I called the mother who told me that they had a family party to go to this afternoon and the later movie woudln&#39;t work.  Ok, so I can understand that. What I do NOT understand is that they didn&#39;t even call to let her know, they just left.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s in tears and I&#39;m angry.  The mom says to me &quot;oh, is she upset??&quot;.  DUH.<br/>
<br/>
UGH.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I could just smack these people.<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

DUH. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Were you able take her to the movie?<br/>
<br/>
I get entirely frustrated when people botch plans with my kids too, because <br/>
we&#39;re so careful when we invite people somewhere.   Sometimes I want to tell <br/>
their friends&#39; parents something profound (and probably divisive beyond <br/>
repair) and the kids will say &quot;No, that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Today LUCKILY the dog we invite in to play was here when I heard the neighbor <br/>
out whistling.  The dog ignored it, but I heard it.  So I walked him over <br/>
there and said he was visiting, and that he&#39;s been visiting sometimes when <br/>
they&#39;re not home, and do they mind.  He said no it was fine with them if it <br/>
was fine with us.  COOL!!!  And the dog&#39;s name is Oreo.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s why I&#39;m mentioning it.  The dad-next-door told me that they&#39;re <br/>
going away for a week and leaving the dog with his sister.   So I&#39;m glad we <br/>
knew so we didn&#39;t worry about what happened to him.<br/>

today as to why people make arrangements and then let him down <br/>
cos something else has come up or they make the arrangements <br/>
and then forget.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t understand cos he doesn&#39;t forget :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128488997">No I couldn&#39;t take her to the movie.  I have to sleep this afternoon so I can work tonight.<br/>
<br/>
We actually already saw the movie as a family...but she really wanted to go with her friend.  It wasn&#39;t so much the movie thing as it was a friend invited her to go somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still pissed but my daughter talked to the girl when she came home from the movies. I guess they worked it out somehow.<br/>
<br/>
I know when I talked to the mom about it earlier, she promised to take them to the movies after New Year&#39;s and she bent over backwards assuring me she really would.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see.  Once burned, twice shy, is good advice in my opinion.<br/>
