<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008212058">Juli, I can&#39;t give you any more good advice than others have already given, <br/>
but I had to post to you, at least to give you a virtual hug. :-)  Your <br/>
story touched me as the mom of a spirited, perfectionist and often moody <br/>
(for lack of a better word) child, and having been a withdrawn and fearful <br/>
kid myself. It pains us so as parents to hear our children say things that <br/>
reflect deep emotions that are different than those prized by society: the <br/>
world loves confident, happy and outgoing people who have no problems. My <br/>
son has said many times in the past that he always feels sad, that he has a <br/>
miserable life, and that things always go wrong for him. He takes things <br/>
very personally. That was so very hard to hear since we have tried so much <br/>
to show our love and provide him with a happy and supportive home. I have <br/>
seen him happy, although he can&#39;t seem to focus on those feelings, but <br/>
rather concentrates on the bad things that happen. This is part of his <br/>
basic personality, and I still have to remind myself that his mood is not <br/>
always my fault. Homeschooling has gradually allowed him to grow past this <br/>
negativity somewhat, probably because he is free to go through these up and <br/>
down periods without being criticized by teachers or ostracized by other <br/>
kids, and he spends his days in the comfort of his own routines, not those <br/>
of others.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all go through mood swings in our life, like growth spurts in <br/>
kids. Who is happy all the time?? And we all have crutches to soothe us <br/>
emotionally in times of stress. I chewed dozens of pencils and pens as a <br/>
kid (probably ingested a lot of lead!), and my son still chews his fingers <br/>
and clothing when he is scared or bored. (In fact, I have urged him to chew <br/>
his clothing rather than his fingers when we are out to avoid the germs on <br/>
his fingers.) I have to admit that after 41 years, I still &quot;twirl&quot; my hair <br/>
with my fingers when I am nervous or while concentrating or reading (OK, <br/>
I&#39;m doing it right now!), and it STILL bothers my mother! It is just a <br/>
means for occupying my hands while my mind is at work. Your daughter has <br/>
developed a way to soother herself when she is stressed which is actually <br/>
good. I wish I had more concrete advice where the blanket is concerned, <br/>
except to not make an issue out of it but rather focus on the positives of <br/>
her life.<br/>
<br/>
I have written a lot and not helped any. I like what Laura said in another <br/>
post:<br/>
&quot;&quot;Is something wrong with me?&quot; is a question that haunts many of us from <br/>
our childhood, and it breaks my heart when a child starts to wonder this. <br/>
You are a good and strong and loving mother. She is your perfect child. You <br/>
are so lucky to have each other. Don&#39;t let false worries and fear creep in.<br/>
Breathe deeply and then start to search for some truth. :)&quot;<br/>

At 08:59 AM 4/5/01 +0000, you wrote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;This might be a long one, so I understand some of you<br/>
&gt;might have to skip it. But I&#39;d appreciate any advice<br/>
&gt;or support from those of you with the kindness and<br/>
&gt;patience to hear me out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My dd is 8yo. There&#39;s some suspicion she might be<br/>
&gt;bipolar, but we haven&#39;t gotten so far yet as to seek a<br/>
&gt;diagnosis. Partly that&#39;s because I&#39;m appalled at the<br/>
&gt;idea of her taking medication. Partly it&#39;s a learned<br/>
&gt;mistrust of doctors. Partly it&#39;s fear/denial.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, today&#39;s incident, which has me in tears off<br/>
&gt;and on, concerns her blanket. She has had this special<br/>
&gt;blanket she calls BB since she was, oh, 2 or 3. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;very special to her, though it&#39;s nothing more than a<br/>
&gt;raggedy scrap by now. It has to be washed frequently<br/>
&gt;because she chews on it. We&#39;ve talked to her about the<br/>
&gt;dye from the blanket getting into her system (she<br/>
&gt;sometimes has bright green poop) and about the<br/>
&gt;bacteria that grow on it from her saliva. She<br/>
&gt;understands this, but she isn&#39;t able to give up the<br/>
&gt;chewing. She also still sucks her thumb when trying to<br/>
&gt;sleep or calm herself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My ds (10yo) asked her today if she would rather give<br/>
&gt;up BB or the cat. She looked horrified at the thought<br/>
&gt;of either choice, then said the cat. Ds and I were<br/>
&gt;shocked, but I realized it wasn&#39;t a fair question<br/>
&gt;because of the completely different functions the cat<br/>
&gt;and the blanket serve for her. That&#39;s like asking me,<br/>
&gt;would you rather give up books or your friends?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then ds asked, &quot;Would you rather lose BB or Mama?&quot; She<br/>
&gt;thought and thought and thought for so long I started<br/>
&gt;feeling insulted. I said, &quot;Now, really, you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know? I&#39;m your Mama!&quot; She replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mama,<br/>
&gt;but I reeeeeeally need BB.&quot; Ds was horrified and<br/>
&gt;hugged me and petted my hair. He pressed her and she<br/>
&gt;shouted, &quot;It&#39;s my personality, it&#39;s my life,<br/>
&gt;everything!&quot; And then she wouldn&#39;t (or couldn&#39;t) say<br/>
&gt;anything else at all about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now before anyone jumps to the conclusion that we<br/>
&gt;somehow have a troubled relationship (I&#39;d give up my<br/>
&gt;dad before I&#39;d give up coffee, but then, he&#39;s never<br/>
&gt;liked me) let me assure you that we are very close,<br/>
&gt;very open and communicative, very<br/>
&gt;attachment-parenting. We adore each other. The other<br/>
&gt;day she woke me with breakfast in bed just because she<br/>
&gt;wanted to see my pleased surprise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, I can&#39;t help being hurt. I keep crying. I<br/>
&gt;tell myself we&#39;ll talk this over tomorrow and it&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt;fine. Right now, she&#39;s still in her uncommunicative<br/>
&gt;stage. Dh is out of town for work, and so is my best<br/>
&gt;friend, and so I don&#39;t even have them to turn to for<br/>
&gt;perspective.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I really think that the reason I&#39;m so teary over this<br/>
&gt;is NOT that I believe she loves the blanket more than<br/>
&gt;me. In fact, I&#39;ve always believed that blankies or<br/>
&gt;pacifiers or special teddy bears are a symbol of the<br/>
&gt;mother. I think the reason I&#39;m so teary is that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;realizing that, first, the deep need of her comfort<br/>
&gt;object, and second, the inability to speak after<br/>
&gt;saying something that probably horrified her as much<br/>
&gt;as it did me, I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;m scared shitless<br/>
&gt;that she really is bipolar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I mean, ONE of the reasons (there are many)<br/>
&gt;unschooling is so good for her is that if she&#39;s (for<br/>
&gt;example) writing one of her illustrated stories, and<br/>
&gt;she can&#39;t get her letters to line up perfectly and<br/>
&gt;goes into an uncontrollable fit, she can stop, go to<br/>
&gt;her room, cuddle up with her blanket and come back to<br/>
&gt;the story when she&#39;s feeling better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When she was in school (kindergarten and first grade<br/>
&gt;and the beginning of second) each year, the teachers<br/>
&gt;started off raving about what a happy, cooperative,<br/>
&gt;friendly child she was, so well-loved by the other<br/>
&gt;children, so kind, etc. Then, each year, there came a<br/>
&gt;time when we got a phone call from the teacher,<br/>
&gt;wondering if someone had died or if there was a<br/>
&gt;divorce going on, because Aubrey had suddenly changed<br/>
&gt;dramatically and was now  a sullen, teary,<br/>
&gt;non-participatory girl who had tantrums and hid from<br/>
&gt;the other kids at recess. I would assure them there<br/>
&gt;was no problem, that Aubrey is, in fact a very moody<br/>
&gt;person, and that this new Aubrey was every bit as much<br/>
&gt;the &quot;real&quot; Aubrey as the one they first met. Of course<br/>
&gt;they thought I was covering some family secret or<br/>
&gt;something. But one day soon, a smiling teacher would<br/>
&gt;approach me and say maybe Aubrey had been sick or<br/>
&gt;maybe whatever the problem was had been solved but<br/>
&gt;they were happy to see Aubrey was back to her &quot;old<br/>
&gt;self.&quot; This cycle would usually occur once, twice, or<br/>
&gt;maybe three times a school year. There&#39;d be referrals<br/>
&gt;to the school counselor for various &quot;problems&quot; such as<br/>
&gt;perfectionism, inability to stop a creative project<br/>
&gt;when it was time to line up (I know, I can see you<br/>
&gt;rolling your eyes!)which was called &quot;transition<br/>
&gt;problems&quot; and so forth. The the school counselor would<br/>
&gt;feel the sweet thrill of success as Aubrey would<br/>
&gt;suddenly become sunny and sweet again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know how to wrap all this up, so I guess I<br/>
&gt;just won&#39;t. I hope someone had the extraordinary<br/>
&gt;patience to read it all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
