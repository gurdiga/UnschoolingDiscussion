&lt;&lt; Hi, does anyone out there know a good way to drill holes in seashells?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wear a mask, foremost.  Some of that dust is REALLY really bad.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has carved and drilled lots of heishi beads.  He uses an <br/>
antique treadle-driven dentist&#39;s drill.<br/>
<br/>
I tried looking at google, and found this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I got a high-speed drill and used special tungsten drill-bits<br/>
first. As the first rather expensive bit broke I have tried then<br/>
dentist&#39;s bits which LJ got as a &#39;present&#39; from her dentist recently. The<br/>
later ones worked fine but it has taken me the whole Sunday morning<br/>
drilling these tiny holes. I couldn&#39;t believe that shells have such a<br/>
hard housing crust in few cases even rather brittle too. Anybody in need<br/>
of an advice how to drill shells just let me know about, O.K.?&quot;<br/>

There&#39;s the site, in case you can find him and ask!  (And maybe people here <br/>
will know.)<br/>

~~~<br/>
With a Dremel tool or other similar rotary tool.  Depending on the size of <br/>
the shell, you might want to put them in a bench clamp or secure them in vice <br/>
grips that you hold in your hand.  Light touch, let the tool do the work.<br/>
