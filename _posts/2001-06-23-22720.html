<div id="ygrps-yiv-610110164">Cardboard boxes!!!  My 11yo ds has a HUGE collection that grows daily.  It&#39;s<br/>
currently housed on the top bunk of his bed.  We have ten foot ceilings in<br/>
this house.  The boxes are packed inside each other and the pile goes up to<br/>
the ceiling.  Sometimes older brother has to help get down &#39;just the one&#39;<br/>
the little brother remembers.  Hint to Sherry: along with the tape buy<br/>
plenty of aluminum foil, string, and tacky craft glue.  We&#39;ve got a rule<br/>
that only Mom or big brother can use the box cutter -- learned the hard way.<br/>
The styrofoam packaging material is also really neat for some projects.<br/>
Last week&#39;s projects included a shield and sword to go along with the<br/>
castle.  Robots, computers, spacecraft, cities, have all taken up residence<br/>
in our livingroom, diningroom, kitchen, hallways......Great free source for<br/>
learning.  Grandparents, neighbors, friends, and local merchants all know my<br/>
son&#39;s love for boxes and provide a seemingly endless supply.<br/>
<br/>
Writing:  The best suggestion I ever found to encourage writing was years<br/>
ago when my sons were little.  I think it was a book or magazine article<br/>
called &quot;The Writing Box&quot;.  You take an old briefcase, plastic box with<br/>
handle, whatever can be easily carried by a young child.  Fill it with<br/>
pencils, crayons, markers, paper of all sizes/shapes/colors, envelopes,<br/>
stamps, stickers, etc.  Take this box where ever your child goes.  Car<br/>
trips, errands, doctor&#39;s visits, trips to grandma&#39;s etc.  Step back and let<br/>
the kid go.  Do NOT put in any coloring book type stuff.   Be prepared to<br/>
receive lots of &#39;mail&#39;.  If you include post-it-notes you&#39;ll also have a lot<br/>
of them around the house.  My youngest learned to read and write all the<br/>
names of things by sticking his self-made sticky-notes to anything and<br/>
everthing in our house!!!<br/>
