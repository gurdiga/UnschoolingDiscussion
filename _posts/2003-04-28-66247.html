International Democratic Education Conference UPDATE<br/>
<br/>
The IDEC is looking really great. You really shouldnât miss it. Our<br/>
latest new presenters are Zoe Readhead from Summerhill, testing<br/>
critics Susan Ohanian, Bill Ayers, and Mike Klonsky. This is in addition<br/>
to John Gatto, Ron Miller, Pat Montgomery, and many others.<br/>
The site at Russell Sage College looks wonderful, with two gyms, a<br/>
multi-purpose space, a basic meeting hall in an old church with<br/>
stained glass windows by Tiffany, a big open central quad, many workshop<br/>
spaces, etc. Our biggest problem has been raising the funds<br/>
so that the low income schools from around the world can attend. So far<br/>
we have students and teachers from 18 countries coming.<br/>
<br/>
We still have good sleeping spaces left at the conference site, Russell<br/>
Sage College, in Troy, NY. The cost is still amazingly low, as little<br/>
as $15 a day for food $15 a day for sleeping, and $10 for the conference<br/>
fees. And special group arrangements can be made. But time will<br/>
run out for those rates pretty soon, unless you at least contact us and<br/>
let us know you are coming. You can do that by replying to this e<br/>
newsletter. A deposit holds your place. The IDEC is from July 16-24. All<br/>
the info is at www.idec2003.com.<br/>
