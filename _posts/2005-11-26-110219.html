&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>===============<br/>
<br/>
The reason I was asking is that it can take WAY longer than that for someone <br/>
to remember what led up to a traumatic injury.   I&#39;m glad there was another <br/>
witness. <br/>
<br/>
Twenty years ago I broke my leg in the mountains, and it &quot;just happened.&quot;   I <br/>
was saying &quot;I fell&quot; when people would ask me, and as soon as possible there <br/>
was morphine and sleeping and other forms of &quot;out&quot; and when I would try to <br/>
remember what happened there was just whiteness in my brain, because it was so <br/>
scary and unexpected, my brain just didn&#39;t know how to process it.   <br/>
Gradually the picture back up and up until I could remember it clearly, but <br/>
it was six or seven days before that happened.     <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to describe in words, but there was a stick on uneven ground in <br/>
pitch darkness.   I stepped on it with one foot, and was wearing used <br/>
Birkenstocks I wasn&#39;t really used to yet and were a bit too big for me, and my foot <br/>
pivoted, like I was rocking on it and I didn&#39;t know whether I would fall forward or <br/>
backward, so I slammed my other leg down to catch myself, but the same stick <br/>
was there, only a little higher (I slammed my foot down like I would&#39;ve had I <br/>
been standing on an absolutely flat floor) and so it also pivoted there and <br/>
broke.   <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t break my leg because I fell, I fell because I broke my leg, myself, <br/>
and then collapsed onto it with my whole weight.     Yuck.   No wonder the <br/>
whole peaceful picture didn&#39;t come flooding back at once.<br/>
<br/>
I think when people have an accident and someone else is killed, even without <br/>
any drug or alcohol involvement, they might NEVER clearly remember all that <br/>
happened because their brain just won&#39;t think the thoughts or build the images.<br/>
<br/>
I new my friend Jay from before he remembered abuse by a priest, through the <br/>
time that he vaguely thought maybe something had happened until he could <br/>
detail several incidents.   And he felt guilty, like he was building the stories, <br/>
but I talked to him through years of that, and when he finally said &quot;Father <br/>
Wilkenson did this to me,&quot; others had reported similar things.    <br/>
<br/>
I went to Jay&#39;s site to get the name, but found something way better instead:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s something he wrote about donating money to disaster survivors instead of <br/>
giving Christmas gifts, and then give a card to each person you would&#39;ve <br/>
given a gift to instead.   He&#39;s even designed two cards and set the file up so you <br/>
can print them out in color or b&W to be colored.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t say he did the art, but he did.   He&#39;s an artist and I&#39;ve seen his <br/>
stuff for years, and he&#39;s done art for projects we were both working on, and <br/>
one year a Christmas card for me to send.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430569485">My son still  doesn&#39;t remember the actual accident when he&#39;s in a conscious <br/>
state.  He  only remembers seeing the deer and thinking he didn&#39;t have to hit  <br/>
it.<br/>
 <br/>
I think he has some memory below that conscious surface level because of  how <br/>
his body was reacting while he was sleeping, from peaceful to startled to  <br/>
jumping and reaching out and moaning, of which he also doesn&#39;t remember.<br/>
 <br/>
I think sometimes it&#39;s a good thing that the really bad parts aren&#39;t easily  <br/>
brought to the conscious mind, especially when one is trying to physically <br/>
heal  as well.<br/>
 <br/>
The pictures stunned him, he reacted in a way I&#39;ve never seen him  physically <br/>
react to anything, much less a photo of something passed.  I  think somewhere <br/>
inside there probably is a terrified boy who couldn&#39;t control a  car veering <br/>
off the road and smacking very loudly a large tree and breaking  glass and <br/>
body parts hitting and flying and landing.  It made me very sad  to see the look <br/>
in his face and I had to put away the photos for some time  because of how he <br/>
was reacting.  I know he&#39;s changed in some ways, I guess  we all change with <br/>
things like that.<br/>
 <br/>
That is a really cool thing your friend is doing, thanks for passing it  <br/>
along, I believe it&#39;s something our family will want to participate in.<br/>
