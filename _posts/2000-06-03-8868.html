<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509847581">Hi folks --<br/>
<br/>
Not to belabor the point, but here&#39;s another story that came out today, <br/>
indicating where public education in Japan seems to be heading.<br/>
<br/>
To help put all this in context, it may help to keep in mind that the <br/>
&quot;Kimi-ga-yo&quot; national anthem and &quot;Hi-no-maru&quot; national flag in Japan are <br/>
not &quot;official&quot; at all, never having been legally sanctioned or voted on <br/>
by the public. But that hasn&#39;t stopped the Education Ministry from <br/>
adopting them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, for many people both in and outside Japan, these two <br/>
controversial symbols of the anthem and flag (representing the Japanese <br/>
emperor as a &quot;deity&quot; and Japan as a &quot;divine nation&quot;) still stand today as <br/>
reminders of past Japanese war atrocities in the Pacific and Far East.<br/>
<br/>
My wife tells me that private schools too in Japan are now feeling the <br/>
pressure to go along with the Education Ministry&#39;s mandate to recognize <br/>
the &quot;divine symbols&quot; of the flag and anthem -- including a private <br/>
Christian school that is not too far from where we live.<br/>
<br/>
If even the private Christian schools in Japan are giving in to the <br/>
Education Ministry&#39;s Shinto-based commandments, what&#39;s next?<br/>

MOST SCHOOLS SINGING ALONG WITH KIMIGAYO, FLAG<br/>
<br/>
*In Tokyo high schools, 99 percent sang the government tune<br/>
in ceremonies this year, up from only 5.9 percent in 1999.* <br/>

<br/>
In this spring&#39;s school ceremonies, more than 90 percent of public <br/>
schools around the country led their students in singing Kimigayo, the <br/>
song legally designated the national anthem last August, the Education <br/>
Ministry said Friday. <br/>
<br/>
In the Tokyo and Osaka areas especially, high schools adding the song to <br/>
their ceremonies rose overwhelmingly. <br/>
<br/>
The ministry surveyed boards of education in all prefectures and major <br/>
cities around the country and found that elementary and junior and senior <br/>
high schools that had not previously included the song in ceremonies did <br/>
so after the law was passed. <br/>
<br/>
After the legislation passed, the Education Ministry stepped up pressure <br/>
on schools to include the song and hoist the flag at school ceremonies. <br/>
<br/>
On Friday, the ministry issued a notice to education boards across Japan <br/>
to ensure that &quot;all schools sing the song and hoist the flag.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The survey found that most schools routinely hoist the flag at their <br/>
ceremonies. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, 99.6 percent of elementary schools and 99.4 percent of <br/>
junior high schools and 99.8 percent of senior high schools hoisted the <br/>
flag at entrance ceremonies in April. Last year&#39;s corresponding <br/>
percentages for elementary schools and high schools were both 99 percent, <br/>
while the figure for junior high schools stood at 98.6 percent. Similar <br/>
percentages were reported for graduation ceremonies. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, 94.7 percent of elementary schools led their students in <br/>
singing Kimigayo at their entrance ceremonies this year, up from 89.2 <br/>
percent last year. With senior high schools, the percentage was 98.1 <br/>
percent for this year, up significantly from 85.2 percent last year, the <br/>
survey showed. <br/>
<br/>
Similar percentages were reported concerning graduation ceremonies. <br/>
<br/>
In Tokyo, only 5.9 percent of senior high schools included the song at <br/>
entrance ceremonies last year, while the percentage rose to 99 percent <br/>
this year. In Kanagawa Prefecture, the percentage rose from 26.6 percent <br/>
last year to 98.8 percent this year. <br/>
<br/>
Senior high schools in Osaka and Kobe did not include the singing of <br/>
Kimigayo in their entrance ceremonies until last year, but all schools in <br/>
the two cities sang the song at ceremonies this year, the survey found. <br/>
<br/>
In meetings in September and early this year, the Education Ministry <br/>
instructed officials from 13 education boards in regions where schools <br/>
have had a low rate of adopting the song to offer what it called <br/>
&quot;appropriate guidance&quot; on the issue.<br/>
