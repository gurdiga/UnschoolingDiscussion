&gt; people think unschooling is eclectic. I know it may be a step to it<br/>
&gt; but...Plus I just don&#39;t want to start it alone. Maybe after the conference<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll be braver and more committed to community.<br/>

unschoolers&#39; group. If you start one, they will come---in droves! <br/>
<br/>
And you started posting here after last year&#39;s conference. Happy to set you <br/>
up again, Barb! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
