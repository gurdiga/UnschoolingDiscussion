<div id="ygrps-yiv-584840064">Hello Jackie, Sonia, and Linda (and whoever else asked about being a<br/>
former unschooler)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you about this. I wanted to<br/>
respond, but didn&#39;t quite know where to begin. I&#39;ll try now, but<br/>
please excuse me if this sounds scattered; it&#39;s late and it&#39;s been a<br/>
long day. This is kind of long (I&#39;m HORRIBLY longwinded).<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have the ideal home/unschooling experience. I was homeschool<br/>
from the ages of 12 to 16. At times it was extremely dull and weeks<br/>
would go by when I don&#39;t think I did anything at all. My interaction<br/>
with other people (of any age) was pretty limited. I think sometimes<br/>
my parents didn&#39;t know what to do with me and my brothers. They are<br/>
not very structured or disciplined themselves, so they were not so<br/>
good about teaching us how to be. There was not much emphasis on<br/>
developing serious hobbies or interests or even our talents. Still,<br/>
they did the best they knew how, and I have no hard feelings towards<br/>
them. I only feel like I have a lot of catching up to do as an adult<br/>
because there are a lot of things I have an interest in that I wish I<br/>
already knew (e.g. Latin & piano) - and that I could have learned back<br/>
then if I&#39;d known how to be diligent. Since the age of 16, I&#39;ve been<br/>
either in college or working. I am trying to unschool myself now as an<br/>
adult, and the hardest thing for me is just knowing how to *finish*<br/>
things. It&#39;s not easy to learn these skills when you&#39;re 20-something<br/>
... and I&#39;m something of a dilettante by nature; *my* unschooling<br/>
experience probably reinforced that.<br/>
<br/>
Despite all that, I support other people&#39;s efforts to home/unschool, I<br/>
believe in the philosophy and if I had children I would more than<br/>
likely unschool them.  I enjoy learning and would love to be able to<br/>
spend time with my kid(s) everyday exploring the world and learning<br/>
with them. My main suggestion to parents (and I don&#39;t intend this to<br/>
be AT ALL accusatory)  is to really fight the urge to be lazy.  Make<br/>
sure your kids are really learning and engaged in life - taking<br/>
lessons, volunteering, getting outdoors, and developing skills;<br/>
whether they&#39;re playing an instrument, re-enacting history, sewing,<br/>
gardening, working on computers, fixing cars, or flying planes, they<br/>
should be experiencing things and trying things out. We don&#39;t always<br/>
have these opportunities as adults. (We should, but we don&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
The book Grace Llewellyn edited (I believe it&#39;s called &quot;Real Lives&quot;)<br/>
that featured essays by a dozen or so unschooling teens was excellent.<br/>
Unschooling is only an advantage, I believe, when kids are MORE<br/>
involved in life than they would be if they were in school. And when<br/>
they are more in touch with themselves. I was VERY in touch with<br/>
myself as an unschooling teen, but I wasn&#39;t immersed in life; that was<br/>
a very serious inbalance, and seven years later it&#39;s something I&#39;m<br/>
still trying to right.<br/>
<br/>
I think my parents keeping me out of school prevented me from being<br/>
overly concerned with what other people think about me because when I<br/>
first left school I was very, very easily hurt by others. I had low<br/>
self esteem.  I got along with everyone, but was also easily<br/>
intimidated and fearful of being disliked. To some degree it&#39;s part of<br/>
my personality to want to get along and avoid confrontation, but I<br/>
think my parents saw that school wasn&#39;t helping me in this regard;  I<br/>
do believe I&#39;m a much stronger-willed and independent person now than<br/>
I would have been had I stayed in junior high.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the best thing about my parents&#39; decision to unschool is that<br/>
it exposed me to various subcultures ... different way of looking at<br/>
things. I was alerted to alternative movements and ideas at a young<br/>
age, and learned to view everything (especially mainstream lifestyle)<br/>
with some skepticism, to not believe everything I was told, and to<br/>
question convention. I can say with a fair amount of certainty that<br/>
had I gone the normal schooling route I&#39;d be in the rat race with so<br/>
many other people, just trying to keep up with the Joneses, trying to<br/>
appear impressive and accomplished, and not asking myself &quot;Why am I<br/>
doing this? Who am I doing this for?&quot;  There&#39;s a large part of me that<br/>
can be really uptight and conservative, so unschooling was a fantastic<br/>
counterbalance to that.<br/>
<br/>
If I could go back 10 years and do things differently, I would have a<br/>
more active and fulfilling unschooling experience;  I wouldn&#39;t choose<br/>
school.  So that&#39;s that. I hope this answered your questions. Oh, and<br/>
I&#39;m a pretty &#39;normal&#39; adult. I work for a utility company, make decent<br/>
money, keep my own apartment, and have some friends. Still, I really<br/>
don&#39;t like this office work and plan to next year move to Spain to<br/>
study Spanish for a year, and then who knows? There are so many things<br/>
I want to do, that if one thing doesn&#39;t work out it just points me in<br/>
another direction I was interested in anyway.<br/>

&quot;The trouble with modern education is you never know how ignorant<br/>
people are. With anyone over fifty you can be fairly confident what&#39;s<br/>
been taught and what&#39;s been left out. But these young people have such<br/>
an intelligent, knowledgeable surface, and then the crust suddenly<br/>
breaks and you look down into depths of confusion you didn&#39;t know<br/>
existed.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So, as a matter of interest, were you interested in these things back then?<br/>
I know that some of the things I was interested in at that age myself, I<br/>
have absolutely no interest in now, and the things I am interested in now,<br/>
held no attraction for me then.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you mean by lazy? If things are important enough to us, we will do<br/>
them. If they aren&#39;t important enough to do them willingly, then are they<br/>
really worth doing?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No matter how many things we offer our kids, even if we have an endless<br/>
money supply and endless time and energy available, there will still be<br/>
things they don&#39;t get to experience. I think that for many children today<br/>
(adults too), who are incredibly busy, what they are really missing out on<br/>
is time to reflect, time to dream, time to simply &#39;be&#39;. I&#39;m not trying to be<br/>
critical, because I too have seen kids who have very narrow lives and who<br/>
don&#39;t get to experience a wide enough - IMO - variety in their lives, but I<br/>
do think it is important not to swing the other way and burden our kids with<br/>
so much &#39;opportunity&#39; that they never get to discover the world within<br/>
themselves.<br/>

to react and swing the pendulum too far the other way.<br/>
<br/>
