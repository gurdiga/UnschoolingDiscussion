<br/>
This is such a parenting issue, I would second the recommendation for Rue&#39;s<br/>
book rather than Unsch. Handbook for showing him that other ways of living<br/>
with children exist successfully - that the family does not disintegrate<br/>
when the power relationships are voluntarily altered by those with the<br/>
authority.  <br/>
<br/>
However there are some other writers that might also help him, outside of<br/>
Unschooling such as Alfie Kohn and many of the essays at<br/>
www.naturalchild.org .<br/>
<br/>
No one would be disputing his right to believe what mainstream society says<br/>
is the correct lifestyle - parent dominated. However maybe the questions<br/>
that he could ponder should be &quot;What am I trying to achieve as a parent?&quot;<br/>
and &quot;Is being authoritarian the best way to achieve it in the long term?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
What helped my dh and I more than anything was recalling how we *felt* when<br/>
we were children and sharing our childhood experiences. That was what led us<br/>
to seek a different path. You cannot heal what you do not acknowledge. <br/>
<br/>
Are you going to the conference?<br/>

That article alone might not change his mind, but it might give you some <br/>
ideas to share or consider.<br/>
If he were to meet my teenaged sons and hang around with them for any amount <br/>
of time (if he&#39;s not the kind of guy who sees &quot;just a kid&quot; and wouldn&#39;t <br/>
actually look at them or listen to them), he would read that article with new <br/>
interest.   That&#39;s what the conferences and what unschooling support groups can be <br/>
best at--candid opportunities to interact with kids who have grown up that way <br/>
and turned out well.<br/>
<br/>
After Marty attended a weeklong junior police academy a couple of years back, <br/>
one of the sergeants told me effusively at the end how wonderful Marty was, <br/>
and said   &quot;You can always tell when a kid comes from a home with a lot of <br/>
discipline and rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I looked up the exact quote in a conversation I saved from the time, and I&#39;m <br/>
glad because I had forgotten what or whether I said anything back (because the <br/>
memory of that moment still stuns me).   Part of the reason for putting this <br/>
here is to indicate that a kid who was raised gently and respectfully was <br/>
still competent and confident in a situation designed specifically NOT to be <br/>
gentle and respectful, but to simulate a police academy training week.   Yeah, they <br/>
were 12 to 14   years old, and yeah it wasn&#39;t really boot camp.   But I think <br/>
some people (dads especially, who don&#39;t have their moms and grandmas voices <br/>
in their heads but who have the harsh pronouncements of dads, grandpas, uncles, <br/>
ex-Marine neighbors and teachers, manly shaming messages) would assume that a <br/>
boy who wasn&#39;t pressured and &quot;made to work&quot; and all would be hopelessly lost <br/>
in a macho high-pressure situation.    <br/>
<br/>
This is a conversation with a childless adult friend who knows Marty really <br/>
well:<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:      AND Top Gun came with $15 gift certificate to Oshman&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
DWSO21:      Nice!<br/>
SandraDodd:      So you know how many paint balls that will buy? <br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:      HARDLY ANY.<br/>
DWSO21:      I was about to say, &quot;probably about 3.&quot;<br/>
SandraDodd:      But wait.   I was going to tell you the best part and got <br/>
sidetracked with all this chit chat.<br/>
DWSO21:      Tell me the best part!<br/>
SandraDodd:      After the dinner they fed us (Quarters barbecue stuff, <br/>
served up by some of their meanest instructors &lt;g&gt;), I went to sit with the <br/>
coordinator/spokesman of the whole thing, and I thanked him and told him Marty had a <br/>
great time.<br/>
DWSO21:      and then?<br/>
SandraDodd:      He told me Marty was great to work with.<br/>
SandraDodd:      And in the course of our both saying nice things about <br/>
Marty, he said &quot;You can always tell when a kid comes from a home with a lot of <br/>
discipline and rules.&quot;<br/>
DWSO21:      ...and then you told him Marty&#39;s never been to school in his <br/>
life, didn&#39;t you?<br/>
DWSO21:      hee hee!<br/>
DWSO21:      That&#39;s a riot!<br/>
SandraDodd:      I told him that Monday had been Marty&#39;s first day of school <br/>
of any sort.<br/>
DWSO21:      what did he say next?<br/>
SandraDodd:      And that when he got home he had re-written his notes.   It <br/>
was the first time he had ever taken notes.<br/>
<br/>
It was four gun safety rules and the names of all the instructors.<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:      &quot;Good.   Initiative! &quot;   He said.<br/>
<br/>
I told him we hardly have ANY rules at our house, we just tell them to make <br/>
good choices that don&#39;t hurt people.   <br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:      He said the homeschoolers he&#39;s met haven&#39;t tended to be very <br/>
outgoing but Marty was (I forget what he said)<br/>
SandraDodd: . . . He was all a-glow from luv of Marty.<br/>
DWSO21:      That&#39;s SO cool!<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:      I&#39;ll just show you the videos when you get a chance.   Two <br/>
short news things and a five minute summary video (nicely put together!   we <br/>
get a free copy for providing a blank tape)<br/>
<br/>
DWSO21:      I want to see it.<br/>
<br/>
DWSO21:      Aren&#39;t you afraid, though, that being a cop will wreck Marty&#39;s <br/>
naturally sunny disposition?<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:      Yeah.   He might not become a cop.   But it will be cop <br/>
appreciation.   Like when you are learning to play an instrument and quit, but <br/>
still afterwards you know what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not when you hear people playing <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:      Oh!   They did a crime scene for them too.   <br/>
<br/>
They set up a room with clues and a storyline and the kids went in and found <br/>
the right clues, in groups.<br/>
SandraDodd:      He had a lot of fun with that.<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:      And they visited the forensics lab (right across the parking <br/>
lot) and the guy showed them real crime scene photos.   They said &quot;Dead <br/>
body!&quot; and he said &quot;if you&#39;re good.&quot;<br/>
DWSO21:      and were they good?<br/>
DWSO21:      Did they see the dead body?<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:      He showed them a body after while.   Drug murder, at a <br/>
party, and let them figure out why the blood pooled as it did.   How was he when he <br/>
was first shot, and then how did he move (or did someone else move him) after <br/>
a while.   (photo)<br/>
SandraDodd:      But one of the first ones was a kitchen.   &quot;See anything?&quot;<br/>
&quot;bullet hole in the linoleum.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty said he said &quot;That floor does NOT   go well with that wall.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ordinarily wise cracks were not being made, because they&#39;d make them do <br/>
pushups, but they had been left with a nice lab guy who wasn&#39;t into that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So he said   &quot;If this were a fashion class, you&#39;d be right.&quot;<br/>
SandraDodd:      And then he showed a second set of photos.   They spray <br/>
something on the floor and then photographic it under black light and blood showed <br/>
up all over that floor and in the hall, and on the side of the sink.<br/>
SandraDodd:      So if you&#39;re going to mop up a crime scene.   REALLY rinse.  <br/>
 Maybe use hydrogen peroxide.    Rinse and repeat FOR SURE.<br/>
DWSO21:      Good to know!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, I haven&#39;t posted hear in a long time maybe never, so I don&#39;t <br/>
want to be intrusive or anything on this...but...<br/>
<br/>
The reason one should treat another respectfully no matter what age, <br/>
is because you should always treat someone else the way that you <br/>
want to be treated yourself.  This is especially true for kids <br/>
because kids learn how to treat others largely from how their <br/>
parents treat them!  Then, if you are treating a 4 yr old <br/>
disrespectfully, they probably won&#39;t be able to do anything about it <br/>
because they are little and you are big, but little 4 yr olds don&#39;t <br/>
stay 4, they grow to be big, and then the behavior that you&#39;ve <br/>
taught them looks bigger too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just always a better idea to treat all people respectfully, <br/>
even adults who don&#39;t deserve it, because they are just big people <br/>
with hurt little kids inside themselves.<br/>

That article alone might not change his mind, but it might give you some <br/>
ideas to share or consider.<br/>
~~~<br/>
For some, this is their first real conversation with a person who isn&#39;t grown <br/>
to adulthood. My kids are used to being the first, in that way. They&#39;re used <br/>
to the look in people&#39;s eyes when they realize that here is a child who has <br/>
something to talk about and who will confidently and guilelessly speak.~~~&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow... That gives me hope that I&#39;m at least on the right track. Wyl has been <br/>
like that since he could talk-18 months? 2 years old?-People would look at me <br/>
baffled, questioning, uncertain. Until I read that, I had just assumed it was <br/>
a &quot;safety&quot; kind of issue, &quot;You&#39;re letting your toddler/preschooler talk to a <br/>
complete stranger without you guarding (hovering over) him?!&quot;. He&#39;s always been <br/>
a natural, voluminous talker, eager to share all that happened to him that <br/>
day, that week, this lifetime... :~) Glad to know we haven&#39;t inadvertently <br/>
stifled that in our bumbling to be the best parents we can be. Thanks for the <br/>
little peace of mind.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
