<div id="ygrps-yiv-731966843">Yeah, no, I don&#39;t believe in &quot;IQ&quot; stuff, but I do sometimes find  <br/>
myself amazed at the speed of someone else&#39;s thought.  Deb Lewis, for  <br/>
instance, and her ability to sculpt with words.  I can make lots of  <br/>
cups and bowls with words, but Deb, she can make lit-up kinetic  <br/>
sculptures that make music and shower confetti.<br/>
<br/>
Holly said something stunning (and awful and embarrassing) yesterday  <br/>
and I thought of telling the story here and decided not to.  But  <br/>
because she did another one just now I&#39;ll tell you both.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s girlfriend Sam was staying with him when he housesat last  <br/>
weekend (he&#39;s still there).  Sam&#39;s smart, sexy and plays World of  <br/>
Warcraft.  She lives north of us and goes to college south of us, so  <br/>
she&#39;s always passing through and Kirby can get to Soccoro or Los  <br/>
Alamos either one pretty easily.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, Sam broke up with him.  Yikes.  He called me.  ME!  His  <br/>
mom.  (Usually lately I find such things out from Marty or Holly, but  <br/>
Marty was out of town...)<br/>
<br/>
Marty came back Sunday afternoon and said Jeff&#39;s family was camping  <br/>
another night and wouldn&#39;t be back until Monday.  I didn&#39;t think  <br/>
Kirby knew that, but Kirby would already have gone to work.  We can&#39;t  <br/>
call him at work.  Marty said he would call during the lunch break  <br/>
and if Kirby hadn&#39;t fed the dogs, Marty would go get the key and go  <br/>
feed the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
I really am getting to what Holly said.<br/>
<br/>
I was worried, then, because Marty had asked how Kirby was doing, and  <br/>
I wasn&#39;t sure.  I said &quot;I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t talked to him all  <br/>
day.  Maybe he killed himself,&quot; and Holly said in 1/3 of a second,  <br/>
&quot;Then the dogs will have something to eat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I HOOTED even though it&#39;s an awful, horrible thought, because it was  <br/>
so unexpected and so quick.<br/>
Good thinking.  Sicko, but quick.<br/>
<br/>
So today she wanted to play Zombies Ate my Neighbors, we cleared out  <br/>
a nice big space in the den, and she got all set up and the SNES  <br/>
flashed once and quit.  Marty couldn&#39;t get it to go.  She called  <br/>
Kirby&#39;s cell.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby, who&#39;s fine and alive and at Jeff&#39;s house, told her he knew he  <br/>
had another SNES in his closet, he thought, but he had no idea where.<br/>
Kirby has a walk-in closet full of shelves and boxes.  Full.<br/>
<br/>
I offered to try to find a used one and order it online.  I was  <br/>
already at e-Bay and google, and Holly said no, don&#39;t yet.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;He has one in his closet, but he&#39;ll take it to Texas with him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;He&#39;s not taking his closet to Texas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And y&#39;know?  That&#39;s true.  It&#39;s funny, and smart-ass, and he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
have time before he moves to go through that closet anyway. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a working Super Nintendo to sell us, I&#39;m probably  <br/>
interested.  If anyone has used the clone type, made to play SNES  <br/>
games but not made by Nintendo, I&#39;d appreciate advice or a review on  <br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432759935">Those ARE funny comebacks - our son does that too.  The other day we were going down the road and I asked him to remind me later about such and such - so as soon as I finished saying it he piped up and reminded me - he said I said later and did not specify how much later.  When he was three I was giving the spiel about how &quot;money does not grow on trees&quot; and he informed me that yes it does because money is made from paper and paper is made from trees.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741078202">Yes he now knows this about money, but at age three he thought it was &quot;paper&quot; - we do refer to it as paper currency.  We did have a look at the difference between writing paper and paper money.  I&#39;m going to read this to him so we will have a new family &quot;joke&quot; about money growing on bushes.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoy finding new silly things to say just to be silly and to have a family connection - kind of like a secrete joke.  One summer it was &quot;Cruise America&quot; - based upon the camper you see everywhere with Cruise America on them.  We say it and start laughing and people think we&#39;re weird ;)<br/>
<br/>
He has a book called &quot;The Secrete Symbols of the Dollar Bill&quot; that he likes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649205322">I want to insert my brother&#39;s best one.  He had aggravated my mom all <br/>
day and at dinner he was still at it.  I don&#39;t know what he said, but <br/>
my mom said &quot;Don&#39;t push your luck!&quot;  He got up and wrote &quot;luck&quot; on a <br/>
piece of paper, sat back down and pushed the &quot;luck&quot; over to her.  Dad <br/>
and I ducked under the table because we were sure my brother was <br/>
about <br/>
to die!  Fortunately for him, my mom thought it was really funny.  I <br/>
think wit is one of the surest signs of intelligent life.<br/>

When dd was four or five I used some paper out of one of my old<br/>
notebooks that dd had recently rediscovered and claimed as hers. I was<br/>
joking around and said, &quot;but it didn&#39;t have your name on it&quot; when she<br/>
laughingly protested against me using the paper. So a few days later I<br/>
saw her dancing around the house with one of my (rarely used) evening<br/>
bags. I said, &quot;Hey, you&#39;ve got my purse there kiddo!&quot; She paused<br/>
mid-step, looked down at the bag, turned it over and then looked up at<br/>
me and said, &#39;Well, funny that I don&#39;t see your name on it&quot; and then<br/>
went right on dancing while trying to contain a fit of giggles.<br/>
<br/>
Lately she can say the most absurd things in deadpan seriousness<br/>
without cracking a smile<br/>

Yeah I remeber my parents having lots of Mad mags around and I used to <br/>
love reading them.  I still remember tons of funny little bits from <br/>
them.<br/>
I might hunt down some old copies and show my kids. I think they will <br/>
really enjoy them.<br/>

I LOVE that!   My kid and husband have that kind of quick wit and <br/>
