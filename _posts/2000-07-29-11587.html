<div id="ygrps-yiv-220616120">Hi Collette:<br/>
<br/>
Dawn F here originally from England, now (unfortunately) living in very hot <br/>
Tucson, Arizona with Zak 5 years old and Max 10 months (yesterday).  I&#39;m <br/>
envious of the Washington State thing... Planning to move further northeast <br/>
in the next couple of years and Washington keeps coming up...Being from <br/>
England I love the rain, so that&#39;s not a problem, but the heat is.  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome<br/>
<br/>
Dawn F</div>
