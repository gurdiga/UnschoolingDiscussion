<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071325509">Kneeling with your bottom in the air, for short periods, can give <br/>
your babe room to turn around, this also helps slow things down if <br/>
someone&#39;s in late stages of labour and on the way to the hospital <br/>
or waiting for medical staff to reach them.  There are <br/>
acupressure points and massage techniques for turning,t oo, but I <br/>
don&#39;t know them off the top of my head.  Touch wood, I haven&#39;t <br/>
needed them yet :-)<br/>

PS, best of luck, though I&#39;d prepare for a c-s, and decide what <br/>
kind of anaesthetic you want...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815344518">Homeopathic pulsatilla works in many cases, taking the highest <br/>
oral dose possible to find. See a local homeopath to get the <br/>
remedy.<br/>
Things in your life being topsy-turvy can effect the baby&#39;s position. <br/>
Resolve loose ends, relationship related of nest/home related. <br/>
Visualize the baby turning. <br/>
Find an experienced OB who does versions, and do it with the <br/>
