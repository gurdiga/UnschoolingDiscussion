&lt;&lt; and being aware of what&#39;s going on around you becomes <br/>
 natural, not paranoia. I&#39;ve been married to a firefighter and <br/>
 paramedic for 17 years now so that has a lot to do with it. He is <br/>
 constantly surprised by how few people know where basic documents are <br/>
 kept when they have simple fires or emergency health issues. It is <br/>
 not a panic response to want to have your life in some order, just in <br/>
 case, especially when you have children.<br/>

<br/>
kids and dogs tend to require that.:o) also a larger one in the house. we <br/>
also have a fire safe box for important papers. I think when your parents do <br/>
this it rubs off. Dh and I are in no way organized but these things are in <br/>
order. Just as a matter of course. We are both avid outdoor people and kits <br/>
are a part of survival should something happen. Esp. when you live where <br/>
evening temps drop 30 -40 some degrees.<br/>

alone? My trip to Phila. takes 12 hours. It is hell,the last time I swore i <br/>
would never do it alone again. Now it will be at least 15 hours. They may not <br/>
have let you check in until 2 hours but you are told to be there 3 hours <br/>
ahead.For me it is too much to deal w/. Also if something did happen I have <br/>
an incredibly sensitive child who would never get on a plane again. Also in <br/>
my grocery store I doubt I will see another being subdued. Small town living.<br/>

But those cases had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks.  Just poor<br/>

So do you mind explaining why you think little of the ARC?  Just<br/>
curious.....having worked for several non-profits,  I realize people with<br/>
experience may have knowledge about &#39;how things *really* operate&#39;  as<br/>
opposed to the &#39;warm fuzzy&#39;  image they hope to bring up when asking for our<br/>
assistance for those in need.   I think it&#39;s extremem;y important to try to<br/>
find out HOW donations are used by organizations that serve (or proclaim to)<br/>
our society.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322328575"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Out of curiousity :) why are you not fans of the red cross?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a generalization and is based only on my experience and that<br/>
&gt; of my husband and his fellow firefighters in and around a large urban<br/>
&gt; area. The Red Cross is king of paperwork and &quot;assessment of need&quot;<br/>
&gt; (read: prove you need this) rather than real and direct help in times<br/>
&gt; of need. When there&#39;s been a fire or a tornado or other disaster, we<br/>
&gt; typically refer people to the Salvation Army. If the city cop or<br/>
&gt; firefighters says this family needs this, that&#39;s all the SA needs to<br/>
&gt; provide ON THE SPOT help. Conversely, the Red Cross takes hours,<br/>
&gt; sometimes days, two to three people asking the same questions, and<br/>
&gt; enough paperwork to choke a horse. Their overhead is tremendous and<br/>
&gt; their staff is way too fat to get my money. Additionally, money does<br/>
&gt; not stay locally and cannot be designated to a specific need. Many<br/>
&gt; folks across the nation believe that they are giving to help folks in<br/>
&gt; NY with recent Red Cross fund drives. That is not true. They are<br/>
&gt; giving to a general fund that funds ALL of the Red Cross. Yes, that<br/>
&gt; certainly helps NY, but that is not what all those $$ have been<br/>
&gt; pouring in for. Check out their overhead - the portion of each dollar<br/>
&gt; that actually goes to those in need. It was an eye opener for me a<br/>
&gt; few years back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s it in a nutshell. My husband wouldn&#39;t give you a dime for the<br/>
&gt; whole organization. I&#39;m not quite as critical but not a fan.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

Loud opinion appreciated here!  I agree strongly with your reasons for not<br/>
donating to American Red Cross.  Do you think their educational information<br/>
would be tainted by this extreme bbueracracy?<br/>
<br/>
I am glad to hear from someone who knows the percentage of money that goes<br/>
to actual people in need....I have similar reasons for being anti-United<br/>
Way.....actually I have MORE reasons for being anti-Untioed Way :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the input,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband is very active in emergency medical education, everything <br/>
from basic CPR up through paramedic training. He is the director of <br/>
Public Safety Services for a 5 county area here in Central Ohio in <br/>
addition to being a city firefighter and paramedic. So I asked him <br/>
what he thought. By and large, he avoids Red Cross materials in favor <br/>
of the American Heart Association and Nation Safety Council&#39;s course <br/>
materials. He is familiar with and has used the American Red Cross <br/>
materials for CPR, First Aid and Emergency Preparedness. He feels the <br/>
materials are valid and sound educationally, but the whole <br/>
bureaucracy and $$$ issue comes up again. The ARC is extremely rigid <br/>
in how courses are to be conducted, making it hard to flex the class <br/>
to meet the needs and constraints of various industries. <br/>
Additionally, each class conducted by a training center must remit a <br/>
per student payment to ARC. This is not something done by the AHA or <br/>
NSC. And its not like they need to pay for research as 95% of their <br/>
factual info comes from research conducted by the AHA. Red Cross <br/>
books are also more expensive. The reach for $$$ is evident.<br/>
 <br/>
For myself, I found it infuriating that scouting is very invested in <br/>
the Red Cross and refused, at first, to accept my AHA certifications <br/>
in first aid and CPR even though the Red Cross courses are based on <br/>
AHA standards. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m with you on this one! My scout troop is not permitted to <br/>
fundraiser during United Way collection times (which get longer and <br/>
longer each year) and yet the amount of money given to our scout <br/>
council is absolutely negligible. Frustrating...<br/>
