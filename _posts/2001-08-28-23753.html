<div id="ygrps-yiv-186831748">Just my 2 cents about this having to &quot;prove&quot; homeschooling is better than <br/>
(you fill in the gap)... <br/>
<br/>
For me this is about the relationship with a husband and the wife, not really <br/>
about homeschooling.  I think I would laugh at my husband if he asked me to <br/>
prove anything, after all I&#39;m a grown up not his daughter and don&#39;t have to <br/>
prove anything to him.  My husband trusts me when it comes to our kids that I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do anything to harm them, that&#39;s one of the reasons we chose each <br/>
other and decided to have a family together because of our common belief that <br/>
our children would be well taken care of by either of us.<br/>
<br/>
As for family members that make comments... I just shake my head and feel <br/>
sorry for them, that they are unaware there is another world out there that <br/>
doesn&#39;t think every child has to be woken at 5am to be sent on a bright <br/>
yellow bus, without seat belts, to a jail that houses too many of them for 8 <br/>
hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve had their chances to raise their children, now it&#39;s mine....<br/>
<br/>
I find the same problem with many men who question the astrological work I <br/>
do.  I&#39;ve had some women say &quot;my husband doesn&#39;t believe in astrology&quot;.  When <br/>
I ask them &quot;how long has he been studying it?&quot; (knowing full well the answer <br/>
is he hasn&#39;t).... They just laugh and then I say &quot;so how can you make a <br/>
judgment about a subject that you have no knowledge of&quot;....  Perhaps if these <br/>
&quot;husbands&quot; and &quot;family members&quot; who have to be &quot;proven&quot; to spent as much time <br/>
investigating homeschooling rather than criticising it, they would see it <br/>
works.<br/>
<br/>
Now to go and read my new John Grisham novel while DH reads the kids a <br/>
goodnight book, baths them and puts them to bed.  I get to put my feet up!!!<br/>

My kids recently are worried about their little twin cousins that are going to go to school- (they are four)they think about it alot because they love their cousins.  My sis is a teacher.  We feel bad for them.  But I think it is important that we don&#39;t say negative things about school in front of them- &#39;cause they dont have a choice.  I tried to put it in perspective by saying school isnt exactly &quot;hell&quot; or anything (well...).  But that kids in school are like ponies who have little kids ride their backs in a circle all day, get fed hay, get petted, wear pretty halters, ect.  And they might like their life, they don&#39;t know anything else. <br/>
<br/>
 My sis likes pony rides at the fair- but I like my WILD horses MUCH better! FREEDOM for ALL! yahhoo, bronco!<br/>
<br/>
My kids really liked thinking of themselves as wild horses...<br/>
