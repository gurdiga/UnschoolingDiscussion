 </span></blockquote>Yes. I think it&#39;s called patois, or patwa, although that word can be used<br/>
both generically and specifically. Not sure if it&#39;s a creole or an actual<br/>
recognized language, I would figure it began as a pidgin mixing English,<br/>
some African language, Spanish, Portugese, with some uniquely Rastafarian<br/>
words. It sort of reminded me of the pidgin we heard on Hawai&#39;i (which I<br/>
think is still a pidgin - a pidgin becomes a creole when it&#39; someone&#39;s<br/>
native langauge, rather than a mixture of languages used for<br/>
communication).<br/>

years - her daughter&#39;s father is Jamaican and she was born there - and<br/>
we&#39;ve all talked about going back some day...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup. It&#39;s that prescriptive vs. descriptive thing, which I&#39;ve tried to<br/>
explan to my sister  but she doesn&#39;t want to hear it, she prefers to<br/>
think that her college instructors are idiots. Which they may be, but not<br/>
because the linguistics tecahers is teacher desciptive phonology and the<br/>
English teacher is tecahing prescriptive presciptive phonology...<br/>

<br/>
This IS silly because, in Canada we have different dialects as you <br/>
move from West to East, which I believe is a reflection of the <br/>
populations that inhabited certain areas. (Lots of Celtic influence <br/>
in the maritime provinces and Nova Scotia)<br/>
<br/>
I have a half-brother who was raised by his mother in Nova Scotia. I <br/>
was raised in Alberta. He and I do not sound the same at all. He has <br/>
a very distinct accent to my ear that is peculiar to Nova Scotia. He <br/>
would say that I sound like a Westerner.<br/>
<br/>
People from PEI and New Brunswick have their own unique way of <br/>
speaking and Newfoundland is probably the most individual of all the <br/>
Canadian provinces. They have, for most purposes, evolved their own <br/>
language! Not to mention Quebec, where of course, they speak French <br/>
and the territories of Nunavut and North West Territories, where many <br/>
people speak Inuit or Cree as their first language.<br/>
<br/>
I find this interesting as well. Thanks for the thread.</div>
