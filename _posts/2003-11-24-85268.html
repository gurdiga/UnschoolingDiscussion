Sandra has some on her website. The typical days stories include some <br/>
families with younger kids and I have 2 things on there about my son when he <br/>
was 6 <br/>
and younger .  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s at <br/>

I think just play with them, give them as much freedom to explore as you can, <br/>
have cool art stuff (body paint, tempera they can paint a fence outside or <br/>
something, if you can), find things for playing that are cheap or free (ice in <br/>
the bathtub is fun, it cleans itself up &lt;g&gt; and you can freeze it in <br/>
interesting molds or just big shapes like cake pans, it floats).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m much outnumbered on this, but I don&#39;t consider kids under school age to <br/>
be &quot;unschooled.&quot;  Others say &quot;Ah, never mind her&quot; when I bring this up, and <br/>
partly it&#39;s regional.  In places where kids are expected to be in preschools at <br/>
the age of 2, maybe yeah, you&#39;re unschooling.  I don&#39;t live where kids to to <br/>
school before kindergarten, so when someone with a toddler tells me she&#39;s <br/>
homeschooling or unschooling, I just shrug and smile.  I figure she&#39;s doing the same <br/>
things she would be doing if her child were going to kindergarten, which he <br/>
might.<br/>
<br/>
Many people who told me they were going to homeschool when their kids were <br/>
little ended up just putting them in school, so maybe that&#39;s part of why I don&#39;t <br/>
&quot;count it&quot; until the first day of mandatory school comes and the kids don&#39;t <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s my personal prejudice, and you can ignore me like the others do.<br/>
<br/>
But as to natural learning, one of the best things people say about <br/>
unschooling is that you can just continue the things you did when they were younger, <br/>
because they keep learning from all the things around them, just as they did <br/>
when they were younger.<br/>
<br/>
My kids loved and still love music, so I tried to have music on quite a bit.  <br/>
 Funny stuff, rock&#39;n&#39;roll, musicals, mostly.  Video, or whatever.   Music in <br/>
the car.  Singing along.<br/>
<br/>
When we had company once the person said we didn&#39;t have music on when she was <br/>
there.  Well we had company!  We were talking and going places.  So when we <br/>
don&#39;t have company, there&#39;s often music.<br/>
<br/>
Holly just lately had me make her a replacement tape for one she wore out.  <br/>
It&#39;s similar but different, because by eliminating some things she was tired <br/>
of, we had more space.  It has at least one and sometimes three songs by Buffalo <br/>
Springfield, The Hollies, Linda Ronstadt, Donovan, Herman&#39;s Hermits, The <br/>
Beatles, Joni Mitchell, John Denver...  maybe more.  She&#39;ll probably wear this one <br/>
out too.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes I say to people, treat your kids like you did when they were <br/>
little, before they were school-age.  So there&#39;s a seamlessness for unschooled <br/>
children between when they were toddlers and when they are older, <br/>
could-be-in-school age.  Life doesn&#39;t change much for the 4 yo when she&#39;s 6 and unschooled.  <br/>
But I agree that toddlers are not unschooled.  In order to be &quot;un&quot; something, <br/>
there has to *be* something to be &quot;un&#39;d&quot; from.  lol.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I do say my son has been unschooled all his life, because there&#39;s no <br/>
way to say his life was different before he was subject to compulsory <br/>
attendance.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a paradox.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I can see both sides. Before my son was school-aged, I would say, &quot;We <br/>
plan on homeschooling&quot; when asked why he wasn&#39;t in preschool. I known lots of <br/>
people who say that they homeschool when their kids are little and I guess the <br/>
difference to them is in their intent. <br/>
