I think this is the crux of the whole unschooling philosophy.  Its not that there is no &quot;guidance&quot;.  Its that the reason and motivation for the guidance is coming from a different place.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thinking in terms of &quot;rebellious&quot; and &quot;defiant&quot; or &quot;because of a sin nature&quot;, I think &quot;in need of information&quot;, &quot;in need of understanding&quot;, &quot;in need of maturity that just isn&#39;t there yet&quot;, &quot;in need of time to cool off, so that we can talk&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
At least that is what I strive for, but I&#39;m not perfect.<br/>

I did NOT mean that as a rhetorical question. I mean that THAT is the <br/>
question a parent needs to ask him or herself IF a child is doing that <br/>
kind of thing frequently. It is NOT natural for kids to habitually be <br/>
mean to siblings or parents.<br/>
