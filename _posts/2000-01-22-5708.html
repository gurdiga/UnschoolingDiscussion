<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269953169">Hi Suzy,<br/>
God, I know how you feel.  My husband & I both grew up in Charlotte, not the<br/>
biggest but still holds it&#39;s own.  Now we live in a VERY rural area & have<br/>
to drive 25-30 minutes to NEAREST store (only 1 grocery store in town) and<br/>
40-45 minutes to Walmart, library, YMCA, etc.   My husband got the job he&#39;s<br/>
in now & I was finally able to stay home all the time, so we jumped at the<br/>
chance.<br/>
<br/>
We are SO TIRED of wasting whole days just to go to the library or to the<br/>
store.  I can&#39;t find any time to go that we don&#39;t have to eat out because<br/>
we&#39;re gone so long.  My husband also drives at least twice a week to MBA<br/>
classes aprx 1.5 hrs one way.<br/>
<br/>
We really like the rural part of where we live.  I have no fears sending the<br/>
kids out to play by themselves (7 & 3).  I&#39;m never afraid and many times<br/>
forget to lock my door.  BUT, I think I can get this all somewhat closer to<br/>
real civilization.  Even the town we go to for Walmart (Martinsville VA) is<br/>
too small...we usually drive to Winston for real shopping and all our<br/>
doctors are either in Winston or still in Charlotte.  Luckily my family<br/>
lives just north of Charlotte so we are able to &quot;get to town&quot; fairly often.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s cheaper in the boonies, but think of all the gas, the tires on<br/>
your car, the TIME you spend commuting, the higher your odds of having an<br/>
accident just because you&#39;re in your car so much more.<br/>
<br/>
I actually grew up just north of the Charlotte city limits but went to<br/>
Charlotte city schools.  My grandpa had cows, we had horses & lots of<br/>
animals...yet we were about 10 minutes from downtown Charlotte.  Now I know<br/>
that things have changed a lot in the last 35 years, but I contend that we<br/>
can find a place closer to a city, yet still offers all the advantages of<br/>
rural life.....it just may not be quite as cheap as the boonies!<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we will find our dream place this summer (or sooner) as my husband<br/>
will be finishing his MBA & looking for new opportunities.  Hopefully your<br/>
family will find one too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753653075">I LOVE SF and Portland is my second fav, I mean, ya gotta love a city where<br/>
the local Burger King has an indoor antique carousel for the kidlets to<br/>
ride &lt;g&gt;  I can&#39;t &quot;do&quot; the other big cities, although it was fun hitting<br/>
the Garden in NY for the horseshows as a kid but that was because they<br/>
block off the streets and you can take the horse out there and wander<br/>
around &lt;g&gt;  Otherwise forget it!<br/>
