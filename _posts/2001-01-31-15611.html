<br></font><font COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">JOB DESCRIPTION:  
<br>
<br>Long term team players needed for challenging 
<br>permanent work in an often chaotic environment.   
<br>
<br>Candidates must possess excellent communication and 
<br>organizational skills and be willing to work variable hours, 
<br>which will include evenings and weekends and frequent 24 
<br>hour shifts on call.  
<br>
<br>Some overnight travel required, including trips to primitive 
<br>camping sites on rainy weekends and endless sports 
<br>tournaments in faraway cities.  
<br>Travel expenses not reimbursed.  
<br>
<br>Extensive courier duties also required. 
<br>
<br>RESPONSIBILITIES: 
<br>
<br>For the rest of your life.  Must be willing to be hated, at least 
<br>temporarily until someone needs $5 to go skating.  
<br>
<br>Must be willing to bite tongue repeatedly.  
<br>
<br>Must possess the physical stamina of a pack mule and be 
<br>able to go from zero to 60 mph in three seconds flat in case, 
<br>this time, the screams from the backyard are not someone just 
<br>crying wolf. 
<br>
<br>Must be willing to face stimulating technical challenges, such 
<br>as small gadget repair, mysteriously sluggish toilets and stuck 
<br>zippers.  
<br>
<br>Must screen phone calls, maintain calendars and coordinate 
<br>production of multiple homework projects.  
<br>
<br>Must have ability to plan and organize social gatherings for 
<br>clients of all ages and mental outlooks.  
<br>
<br>Must be willing to be indispensable one minute, and handle  embarrassment the 
<br>next.  
<br>
<br>Must handle assembly and product safety testing of a half 
<br>million cheap, plastic toys and battery operated devices.  
<br>
<br>Must always hope for the best but be prepared for the worst.  
<br>
<br>Must assume final, complete accountability for the quality 
<br>of the end product.  
<br>
<br>Responsibilities also include floor maintenance and janitorial 
<br>work throughout the facility. 
<br>
<br>POSSIBILITY FOR ADVANCEMENT AND PROMOTION:  
<br>
<br>Virtually none.  Your job is to remain in the same position for years, 
<br>without complaining, constantly retraining and updating your skills, 
<br>so that those in your charge can ultimately surpass you. 
<br>
<br>PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE: 
<br>
<br>None required, unfortunately.  On-the-job training offered 
<br>on a continually exhausting basis. 
<br>
<br>WAGES AND COMPENSATION: 
<br>
<br>You pay them, offering frequent raises and bonuses. 
<br>When you die, you give them whatever is left. The oddest 
<br>thing about  this reverse-salary scheme is that you actually 
<br>enjoy it and wish you could only do more. 
<br>
<br>BENEFITS: 
<br>
<br>While no health or dental insurance, no pension, no tuition 
<br>reimbursement, no paid holidays and no stock options are 
<br>offered, job supplies limitless opportunities for personal growth 
<br>and free hugs for life if you play your cards right. 
<br>
<br>Forward this on to all the MOM&#39;s you know, in appreciation for 
<br>everything they do on a daily basis, and let them know they are appreciated.
