<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983969200">Hi again! Just realized that there are 2 &quot;Stephanie&quot;s on the list, so I guess that I<br/>
will start signing with my last initial to avoid confusion.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that people might give me some input on how they would handle<br/>
the following situations in an &quot;unschooling&quot; way. I have found that in the past<br/>
I have been good about seeing my kids point of view and trying to be respectful<br/>
in my discipline. There are certain areas where I seem to be at a loss and tend<br/>
to fall back on more traditional methods of punishments...any suggestions would<br/>
be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem lately has been hitting. Some days the boys (5 and 2) get along great. Some<br/>
not so great. Seems to be a couple of reasons why they hit...boredom, not getting what<br/>
they want and revenge (either towards each other or towards me). Obviously hitting<br/>
is not acceptable, but what to do about it? If I physically remove Jason (which is<br/>
what I usually do) he starts crying about how I hurt him and putting it all back on<br/>
me). If I try to talk with him about what he did and how it made Kyle feel, he tunes<br/>
me out (very obviously...which also pushes my buttons). Do I just focus on the reason<br/>
for the hitting? If so, how exactly (if they are bored I do something with them, but<br/>
the other reasons I am not so sure what to do). Dh is very sensitive to this, as he <br/>
was the youngest of two boys and his older brother picked on him. DH wants a specific<br/>
punishment...either a time out or being sent to his room (neither of which really <br/>
works as it turns into a power struggle with Jason running around to prove that we can&#39;t<br/>
make him - which *really* pushes dh&#39;s buttons. Not fun).<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that has become an issue is the sharing of the tv and computer. Now that <br/>
we have no restrictions, what is a fair way of doing this? The tv is a little easier,<br/>
I usually have them alternate shows (they actually enjoy a lot of the same shows, it is<br/>
just the 2 yo is absolutely hooked on Robotica and that is all he wants to watch and Jason<br/>
gets bored with it). I feel like I am controlling how they do this, but I also feel that<br/>
I have to be more involved since Kyle is only 2. The computer is a little trickier<br/>
as there is usually no good start/stop point. In the past, I have usually not made them<br/>
share...if one had something, the other could ask for it or offer something in trade<br/>
but it was up to the one being asked if he wanted to share it. The computer<br/>
has been harder however, as Jason would sometimes stay on it for hours and Kyle can <br/>
be very persistent and not be distracted (and often starts screaming). I guess that I<br/>
reach a point when I wonder if it is too unfair to Kyle to let Jason determine when he<br/>
gets to play all the time (Kyle usually will not initiate playing on the computer but<br/>
will want to play when he sees Jason playing). But then it is also unfair to Jason to <br/>
let Kyle get his way all the time just because he is the baby. SO then I get into <br/>
making the call again.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...just looking for some input, hoping to get some insight or to be able to see things<br/>
in a different way. Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907298773">Here&#39;s what I do with my 7 and 5 yo boys, hope it gives you some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Hitting: First, remind them when they first get up that there is no hitting allowed, because it&#39;s not nice to hurt people. Then throughout the day, like every hour or two, wander through or look up and ask, are you both remembering to be nice and not hit? This gives lots of reminders, with the focus being on acting nice to others. We have a reward system set up. I give my boys a foam heart cutout whenever they go an hour or two without the undesirable behavior, and they have a list of things they can choose from to trade their hearts in to do. <br/>
<br/>
Sharing tv/computer time: My oldest son get the computer in the mornings between breakfast and lunch, and my youngest gets it between lunch and supper. Opposite times with the TV. That way I&#39;m not having to keep up with whose turn it is, and they&#39;re both busy so they&#39;re not argueing about what the other&#39;s choices are. Plus before breakfast and after supper are my computer times and the tv is off those times. They&#39;ve both gotten to where they usually ignore both the tv and the computer, but when they do want to do/watch something, they know when they can or can&#39;t. <br/>

<br/>
I would remove the little one rather than the big one, and in a calm and <br/>
light tone of voice, say something like &quot;Oooh, it&#39;s dangerous here, let&#39;s go <br/>
feed the cat&quot; or something, and let the older one calm down.<br/>
<br/>
Removing the agressor is harder and less peaceful sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching, one of the older and male teachers told me, after I had <br/>
successfully broken up a fight between 15 year old boys, that I could have <br/>
been badly hurt, and the next time I should grab the loser, because he WANTS <br/>
to be rescued, and they both save face if you remove the victim.  If you <br/>
remove the agressor you risk being hurt, for one thing.  And the dynamics are <br/>
worse for participants and viewers.   Some of that applies at home too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If I try to talk with him about what he did and how it made Kyle feel, he <br/>
tunes<br/>
me out (very obviously...which also pushes my buttons). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Then ask him how he felt instead of telling him how you think it made Kyle <br/>
feel.  Ask him calmly and sweetly.   Make him an ally, not an enemy.  Tell <br/>
him you want the house to be safe and comfortable for everyone there, and <br/>
what can you do so that he&#39;s not being so frustrated he needs to hit.<br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;You don&#39;t need to hit&quot; it&#39;s in the range of telling someone <br/>
something doesn&#39;t hurt, or they&#39;re not hungry.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;DH wants a specific<br/>
punishment...either a time out or being sent to his room (neither of which <br/>
really <br/>
works as it turns into a power struggle with Jason running around to prove <br/>
that we can&#39;t<br/>
make him - which *really* pushes dh&#39;s buttons. Not fun).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of time out, maybe consider a walk (or a jog) with one of the <br/>
parents.  Get hiim away from his brother, out of the house, maybe even out of <br/>
the yard or neighborhood, and when the adrenaline is out and he&#39;s once again <br/>
NOT in the irritating presence of the usurper (firstborns will know what I <br/>
mean), he will be his best self again and can express to a sympathetic parent <br/>
how he&#39;s feeling.<br/>
<br/>
If IN the presence of his &quot;replacement,&quot; he is told he is BAD and WRONG to <br/>
resent the new kid, and that the new kid&#39;s rights are far greater than HIS <br/>
badboy oldest child rights, things will probably get worse before they get <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But then it is also unfair to Jason to <br/>
let Kyle get his way all the time just because he is the baby. SO then I get <br/>
into <br/>
making the call again.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they have favorite shows, make sure each knows the other wants to watch <br/>
whatever that is.<br/>
<br/>
Between and around those, help them negotiate case by case.<br/>
<br/>
What we do with computers is whoever&#39;s on can stay on until he&#39;s done, but <br/>
there are occasional exceptions.  Sometimes someone just needs to check <br/>
e-mail.  An e-mail check made on request should be really brief, not over <br/>
fifteen minutes, and that&#39;s worked out well.  <br/>
<br/>
When one of the boys didn&#39;t want to let Holly have a turn, I would remind <br/>
them that her sessions never lasted as long as theirs, that she&#39;s little and <br/>
gets bored, and that made them more willing to let her on.  <br/>
<br/>
If she was NOT getting bored and I had kinda promised the boys she would, I <br/>
would either find something truly good to distract the boy, or I would find <br/>
something truly better to lure Holly away.<br/>
<br/>
Telling them what they should want and that they should have had enough and <br/>
that they should give someone else a chance cansometimes sound like just <br/>
nagging.  Sometimes I do just nag. &lt;g&gt;  but it has always worked better when <br/>
I appeal to their higher selves, and when I use REAL needs in the house or <br/>
real opportunities to be with one kid or another to give them something more <br/>
attractive than waiting for or wrangling computers away from each other.<br/>
<br/>
When the baby&#39;s asleep, remind the older one to grab the computer, too.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately I tell Marty it&#39;s noble of him to let me or his sister on, because <br/>
when we go to sleep at night he has it all to himself.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between him feeling noble and feeling mistreated is prety <br/>
profound. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
The difference between me praising his nobility and me shaming him for being <br/>
selfish goes right off the charts.<br/>

Maybe, at a calm time, your dh could tell your eldest stories about what<br/>

story could get past the &quot;tuning out&quot; response.<br/>

For the computer sharing, how about using a timer so that they get equal <br/>
time? As for the hitting, I would just separate them for a time. I know <br/>
time-outs worked for us, but that they don&#39;t work for everyone. Good luck! :)<br/>

That would never have worked here, because one has always been way more <br/>
involved in something that actually takes longer, while another might just <br/>
have one or two things to do.  If you one kid has an hour and he&#39;s DONE, he <br/>
might not be willing to relinquish &quot;his&quot; remaining time.<br/>
<br/>
I think like with letting them decide what and how much to eat, letting them <br/>
know what &quot;I&#39;m done&quot; feels like is good too.  If they have measured amounts <br/>
and times they will feel more pressured and needy than if they know when it <br/>
IS their turn they can stay on as long as they want to, and sometimes that <br/>
might still be just five minutes.<br/>

them<br/>
know what &quot;I&#39;m done&quot; feels like is good too.  If they have measured amounts<br/>
and times they will feel more pressured and needy than if they know when it<br/>
IS their turn they can stay on as long as they want to, and sometimes that <br/>
might still be just five minutes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Definitely agree on this one too. My daughter spends much more time on the <br/>
computer than my son. But he spends more time on his puter just doing <br/>
programs we buy. He has no internet access. He decides much more what they <br/>
watch because she doesn&#39;t care and when she wants to watch something else at <br/>
the same time, we have more than one TV. Generally though, within 10 <br/>
minutes, I find both of them in the same room again!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922509819">Removing the agressor is harder and less peaceful sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching, one of the older and male teachers told me, after I had <br/>
successfully broken up a fight between 15 year old boys, that I could have <br/>
been badly hurt, and the next time I should grab the loser, because he WANTS <br/>
to be rescued, and they both save face if you remove the victim.  If you <br/>
remove the agressor you risk being hurt, for one thing.  And the dynamics are <br/>
worse for participants and viewers.   Some of that applies at home too<br/>
<br/>
I may be a bit late here - but when I read this question and answer I thought what a great idea - For one it actually gives attention to the &quot;victim&quot; which can be a positive motivator for better behavior in the future. Also, I can see how if I were to do this with my own children 8,4, &3, it would cause less stress on my part - and less yelling or fighting on their part. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra,  I always appreciate what you have to say on these parenting issues. It may seem so logical, but also knowing that you are on the other side of some of these issues and can speak for what has worked for you is very helpful for those of us still on the beginning of the journey ;-) and you always sound like a very patient, loving mom. Did you ever scream and want to pull your hair out??<br/>

<br/>
  -=-If I try to talk with him about what he did and how it made Kyle feel, he <br/>
  tunes<br/>
  me out (very obviously...which also pushes my buttons). -=-<br/>
<br/>
  Then ask him how he felt instead of telling him how you think it made Kyle <br/>
  feel.  Ask him calmly and sweetly.   Make him an ally, not an enemy.  Tell <br/>
  him you want the house to be safe and comfortable for everyone there, and <br/>
  what can you do so that he&#39;s not being so frustrated he needs to hit.<br/>
<br/>
  If you say &quot;You don&#39;t need to hit&quot; it&#39;s in the range of telling someone <br/>
  something doesn&#39;t hurt, or they&#39;re not hungry.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;DH wants a specific<br/>
  punishment...either a time out or being sent to his room (neither of which <br/>
  really <br/>
  works as it turns into a power struggle with Jason running around to prove <br/>
  that we can&#39;t<br/>
  make him - which *really* pushes dh&#39;s buttons. Not fun).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Instead of time out, maybe consider a walk (or a jog) with one of the <br/>
  parents.  Get hiim away from his brother, out of the house, maybe even out of <br/>
  the yard or neighborhood, and when the adrenaline is out and he&#39;s once again <br/>
  NOT in the irritating presence of the usurper (firstborns will know what I <br/>
  mean), he will be his best self again and can express to a sympathetic parent <br/>
  how he&#39;s feeling.<br/>
<br/>
  If IN the presence of his &quot;replacement,&quot; he is told he is BAD and WRONG to <br/>
  resent the new kid, and that the new kid&#39;s rights are far greater than HIS <br/>
  badboy oldest child rights, things will probably get worse before they get <br/>
  better.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;But then it is also unfair to Jason to <br/>
  let Kyle get his way all the time just because he is the baby. SO then I get <br/>
  into <br/>
  making the call again.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If they have favorite shows, make sure each knows the other wants to watch <br/>
  whatever that is.<br/>
<br/>
  Between and around those, help them negotiate case by case.<br/>
<br/>
  What we do with computers is whoever&#39;s on can stay on until he&#39;s done, but <br/>
  there are occasional exceptions.  Sometimes someone just needs to check <br/>
  e-mail.  An e-mail check made on request should be really brief, not over <br/>
  fifteen minutes, and that&#39;s worked out well.  <br/>
<br/>
  When one of the boys didn&#39;t want to let Holly have a turn, I would remind <br/>
  them that her sessions never lasted as long as theirs, that she&#39;s little and <br/>
  gets bored, and that made them more willing to let her on.  <br/>
<br/>
  If she was NOT getting bored and I had kinda promised the boys she would, I <br/>
  would either find something truly good to distract the boy, or I would find <br/>
  something truly better to lure Holly away.<br/>
<br/>
  Telling them what they should want and that they should have had enough and <br/>
  that they should give someone else a chance cansometimes sound like just <br/>
  nagging.  Sometimes I do just nag. &lt;g&gt;  but it has always worked better when <br/>
  I appeal to their higher selves, and when I use REAL needs in the house or <br/>
  real opportunities to be with one kid or another to give them something more <br/>
  attractive than waiting for or wrangling computers away from each other.<br/>
<br/>
  When the baby&#39;s asleep, remind the older one to grab the computer, too.  <br/>
<br/>
  Lately I tell Marty it&#39;s noble of him to let me or his sister on, because <br/>
  when we go to sleep at night he has it all to himself.<br/>
<br/>
  The difference between him feeling noble and feeling mistreated is prety <br/>
  profound. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
  The difference between me praising his nobility and me shaming him for being <br/>
  selfish goes right off the charts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done this sometimes...it works when the hitting is because Kyle is<br/>
bugging Jason. Other times Jason has followed us and kept trying to hit. <br/>
Guess the &quot;why&quot; was for attention...now that I think about it, I probably<br/>
should have changed tacts and tried to see what was really bothering him.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then ask him how he felt instead of telling him how you think <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been trying to keep this in mind...I really am on his side and I have <br/>
been trying to parent this way. I have asked him for some suggestions before<br/>
and gotten the infamous &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. We have talked about hitting other <br/>
inanimate objects like pillows (they are too soft) or arms of couches (that<br/>
won&#39;t work because it has to have skin and bones LOL!).<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am usually pretty good about this as it is a pet peeve of mine. I try to stay<br/>
away from telling him that he does or does not feel a certain way (other then<br/>
to ask questions about how he is feeling).<br/>
<br/>

&gt; sympathetic parent <br/>
&gt; how he&#39;s feeling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HeHeHe. I am a firstborn so we have the bases covered here (dh is a second <br/>
born). One of the things that has helped is that I talk about how I sometimes<br/>
resented my little brother. That I used to hit him, but learned other ways<br/>
as I got older. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; before they get <br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope that is actually one thing that I have done right. :o) I have<br/>
always been open to his feelings about Kyle and let him know that <br/>
it is ok to not always like him. I also talk about how I didn&#39;t like<br/>
all the time my little brother took when he was born. He has told me<br/>
many things that he does not like about Kyle. The funny thing is that <br/>
one time I was asking him if he wanted another little sister or brother<br/>
(we are just about sure we are done, but I wanted to get his take on<br/>
it). He said no, Kyle is enough. I then asked him if he would rather<br/>
have mommy and daddy to himself and he said no, that he liked having<br/>
Kyle around. And I believe him...Kyle is a built-in playmate and Jason<br/>
loves to have someone to play with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they have favorite shows, make sure each knows the other <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Between and around those, help them negotiate case by case.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, they seem pretty good with alternating shows. Sometimes I will<br/>
point out how cranky Kyle (usually in the evenings) and that it<br/>
might help him calm down to be able to watch his shows. Works sometimes.<br/>
Jason has also recently begun to &quot;sell&quot; a show to Kyle...&quot;hey Kyle...<br/>
do you want to watch junkyard wars, they crash up neat cars&quot;. Kyle is<br/>
actually very agreeable if you ask first, but if you just try to change<br/>
the show he digs in. Guess that will teach itself.<br/>
<br/>

to hear that it works!<br/>

Jason decide, the easier it is for him to decide to stop.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! I need to be more mindful of this. Thanks. I just think that I needed<br/>
someone to tell me that I did not have to &quot;crack down&quot; on this  behavior.<br/>
It is interesting...even my most gentle-discipline AP friends seem to <br/>
resort to punishments when it comes to hitting. Don&#39;t get me wrong...I don&#39;t<br/>
make excuses for him hitting, but I also don&#39;t want to treat him like he is a<br/>
bad kid because he is not.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the food for thought.....<br/>

overly close (they are as different as night and day) and I know that<br/>
he was picked on. I do think that Jason&#39;s and Kyle&#39;s relationship<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
That one about extricating the victim is courtesy of Louie Sanchez, who was <br/>
my 9th grade science teacher and later a co-worker.   And a dad, too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;and you always sound like a very patient, loving mom. Did you ever scream <br/>
and want to pull your hair out??&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not always patient, but I&#39;ve worked on it consciously the whole time I&#39;ve <br/>
had kids.<br/>
<br/>
I was just pretty grumpy Sunday, with Marty and a couple of his friends.  I <br/>
hadn&#39;t been that mad at Marty for a long time, but within fifteen or twenty <br/>
minutes we were joking about it (gently), and reminding each other we really <br/>
liked each other.  <br/>
<br/>
They left without telling us, and left the younger brother (8 or 9?) of one <br/>
of the boys.  We had words with each of them (my husband and I), in front of <br/>
the others mostly--Marty for being a neglectful host, the boy&#39;s brother for <br/>
not taking care of his own brother, and the third kid for being the oldest <br/>
and not being a better influence and more responsible.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t insult their being.  They didn&#39;t defend their irresponsibility.  <br/>
Nobody was crushed or scared.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an account of me swatting a little kid (yikes...):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/zeneverything">http://sandradodd.com/zeneverything</a><br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I do yell.  Usually at Kirby, I think.  But not much and I catch <br/>
myself and try to gracefully retreat into loving humor, and if I can&#39;t do <br/>
that, I try to just shut up and get away from the conversation until I can <br/>
state my concern calmly.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would probably have been a pretty strident and inflexible mom <br/>
(following some family tradition, if I hadn&#39;t stepped away from it <br/>
consciously) if it hadn&#39;t been for Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings and <br/>
La Leche League.  They really changed my attitude enough that I was able to <br/>
listen to other and see with my own eyes instead of the eyes assigned to me <br/>
by tradition/habit/inheritance.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sandra,  I always appreciate what you have to say on these parenting <br/>
issues. It may seem so logical, but also knowing that you are on the other <br/>
side of some of these issues and can speak for what has worked for you is <br/>
very helpful for those of us still on the beginning of the journey ;-)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
That one about extricating the victim is courtesy of Louie Sanchez, who was <br/>
my 9th grade science teacher and later a co-worker.   And a dad, too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;and you always sound like a very patient, loving mom. Did you ever scream <br/>
and want to pull your hair out??&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not always patient, but I&#39;ve worked on it consciously the whole time I&#39;ve <br/>
had kids.<br/>
<br/>
I was just pretty grumpy Sunday, with Marty and a couple of his friends.  I <br/>
hadn&#39;t been that mad at Marty for a long time, but within fifteen or twenty <br/>
minutes we were joking about it (gently), and reminding each other we really <br/>
liked each other.  <br/>
<br/>
They left without telling us, and left the younger brother (8 or 9?) of one <br/>
of the boys.  We had words with each of them (my husband and I), in front of <br/>
the others mostly--Marty for being a neglectful host, the boy&#39;s brother for <br/>
not taking care of his own brother, and the third kid for being the oldest <br/>
and not being a better influence and more responsible.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t insult their being.  They didn&#39;t defend their irresponsibility.  <br/>
Nobody was crushed or scared.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an account of me swatting a little kid (yikes...):<br/>

Sometimes I do yell.  Usually at Kirby, I think.  But not much and I catch <br/>
myself and try to gracefully retreat into loving humor, and if I can&#39;t do <br/>
that, I try to just shut up and get away from the conversation until I can <br/>
state my concern calmly.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would probably have been a pretty strident and inflexible mom <br/>
(following some family tradition, if I hadn&#39;t stepped away from it <br/>
consciously) if it hadn&#39;t been for Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings and <br/>
La Leche League.  They really changed my attitude enough that I was able to <br/>
listen to other and see with my own eyes instead of the eyes assigned to me <br/>
by tradition/habit/inheritance.<br/>
