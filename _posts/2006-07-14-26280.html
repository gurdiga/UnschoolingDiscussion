Some reminders for those who are undecided on some conference offerings:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6 August                        Hotel Reservations with conference <br/>
rate, after that the rate goes up considerably. I can do nothing about <br/>
the<br/>
                                     increase after this date! Please <br/>
book your room in time!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10 August                      Late Registration for the conference. <br/>
After Aug 10, you will pay the &quot;At the Door&quot; fee. No exceptions!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10 August                      T-Shirt Order deadline. I will be <br/>
ordering a very few extras, but don&#39;t count on it!                      <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10 August                      Banquet Reservations. We&#39;ll need your <br/>
reservations and payment for the Banquet<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps with your planning!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
