<div id="ygrps-yiv-67431181">I posted a couple weeks ago about my kids wanting to homeschool, but <br/>
we were planning on waiting out the year, then decided to do it <br/>
sooner...  I wasn&#39;t able to get online and respond as much as I&#39;d <br/>
have liked to, but just wanted to let you know I was reading.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I told the school today my kids won&#39;t be coming back.  My <br/>
dd5.5 is not going back at all, and my ds7 will only go back until I <br/>
get the word from the school district that our paperwork has been <br/>
accepted (we live in PA and have a few hoops to jump through), but <br/>
his last day will be sometime this week.  <br/>
<br/>
This list (and a couple others) and Sandra&#39;s articles have given me <br/>
much to think about.  We&#39;re even hoping to make it to the conference <br/>
in October.  I&#39;d especially love for my dh to go, he understands the <br/>
benefit of unschooling, but I&#39;d love for him to be as excited as me <br/>
and the kids are, and I think him getting personal experiences would <br/>
help. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing how when my 2 older kids were little this lifestyle <br/>
came so easy for us.  I read lots of Sandra&#39;s articles and related <br/>
to lots of them, in particular, the one where she drove around going <br/>
to the a few markets for a plum for Holly reminds me of the time my <br/>
kids were 2 years and 6 months, it was fall and there were leaves <br/>
all over.  Nick (2) wanted to jump in them, so we went out to get <br/>
one, and spent all afternoon raking the leaves into a pile and <br/>
splashing around in them.  We never actually raked them up, just <br/>
played in them and left them there.  <br/>
<br/>
Then all of a sudden they were in school, I was pregnant with my <br/>
third and everything went out of whack.  I can&#39;t believe it took me <br/>
this long to realize why!  I&#39;m so excited to get back to the way <br/>
things were.  Thanks again for pushing me to do it sooner.<br/>

**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE SCHOOL <br/>
DISTRICT**. :)  You give them your affidavit to inform them that you <br/>
will be homeschooling and then you stop sending them to school.  If <br/>
your school is telling you that you need to wait to have your <br/>
paperwork approved, they are wrong. <br/>

Thanks so much!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882898389">Our oldest spent only 4 half days in kindergarten.<br/>
I called him in sick after that until I had the <br/>
paperwork ready.  You could always do that if you don&#39;t<br/>
want him there. krista<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362673913">If you go to www.phen.org and click on PA Home Education Law, you&#39;ll <br/>
be able to read the actual home education law yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
In answer to your question about where the law states you don&#39;t need <br/>
approval from the school district, the law states, &quot;A notarized <br/>
affidavit of the parent or guardian or other person having legal <br/>
custody of the child or children, filed prior to the commencement of <br/>
the home education program and annually thereafter on August 1 with <br/>
the superintendent of the school district of residence and which sets <br/>
forth:&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The law states that you have to file the affidavit, it does not state <br/>
that you have to wait for the school district to approve it. Don&#39;t <br/>
give the school district more authority than the law gives it. :) <br/>
