He&#39;s absolutely right, some people cannot teach.....that&#39;s why it&#39;s <br/>
great that our kids DON&#39;T need us to teach them, they can learn just <br/>

not badly enough to look it up).  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

All I kept thinking while reading the article was...Mr. PhD. didn&#39;t do his <br/>
homework!!! Hopefully he is not on the Board of Admission for UC Irvine! Perhaps <br/>
my fingers will do the walking and call UCI and ask if he is, I&#39;m sure they <br/>
will be thrilled to hear from me if his is on the board. What a numbskull!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309425819">I have serious problems with the idea that classrooms breed democracy. I doubt there are any children from wealthy families in inner city public schools. If anything,  schools breed classism; who has what sneakers or who has how many hickeys or who has this kind of hair.<br/>
I fail to understand why more parents don&#39;t homeschool; however, I fear that as the numbers increase, the govt. will come down on us.<br/>
