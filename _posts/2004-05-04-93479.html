<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138452222">The other thing Morgaine liked, that is definitely non-sectarian, is <br/>
the idea of genetics.  She already knows that babies are made from a <br/>
mommy&#39;s egg and daddy&#39;s sperm, and that the sperm gets inside an egg <br/>
and it makes a baby.  One of the days she was missing her <br/>
grandfather I tried the approach, &quot;Remember that babies are made of <br/>
some of the mommy and some of the daddy?  And that the genes from <br/>
mommy and daddy tell the baby what kind of hair to grow, and how <br/>
tall to get, and how the baby&#39;s voice will be?&quot;  And we traced the <br/>
genes back a few generations, from her, to her dad, to her <br/>
grandmother, to her great-grandfather, coming of course to the <br/>
conclusion that even though great-grandpa is dead, part of him is <br/>
still alive, because some of his genes helped make her.  It seemed <br/>
to help her connect, and it might help with the idea of a parent&#39;s <br/>
death.  Also of course making it clear that the child would still be <br/>
taken care of. <br/>
<br/>
Also, Sang, I noticed you said your son is saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to <br/>
die&quot; not &quot;I don&#39;t think I will die.&quot;  Maybe just validating his <br/>
feelings would be enough.  A lot of people don&#39;t want to die.  You <br/>
don&#39;t have to change his mind about that.  He might be very clear in <br/>
understanding that he will eventually die, and that so will you.  <br/>
Morgaine knows that someday we&#39;ll die, but I&#39;ve told her I think I <br/>
will be very old, and that she&#39;ll be old, too.  When she asked how <br/>
old, I said, &quot;Maybe when I&#39;m 95,&quot; and she asked, &quot;How old will I <br/>
be?&quot;  I said she&#39;d be 74.  Sometimes she brings those numbers up.  <br/>
They seem comforting to her.  She knows it might be sooner or later <br/>
than that, but we&#39;ve created a scenario.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have just recently started talking about death with Andrew (6) because he <br/>
asked about it about after seeing a death in a movie.  We told him about lots <br/>
of ways that people view death so that he could kind of find what he needed to <br/>
believe or know to make him comfortable.  It&#39;s a really hard topic and I <br/>
almost felt as if he was losing a piece of what makes childhood magical.  He <br/>
listened intently and then asked a couple questions, then that was it.  Three days <br/>
later, he was in tears and said he didn&#39;t want to die or us either.  We talked <br/>
some more and he felt better but I didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s just a hard discussion no <br/>
matter where it starts or how it ends.  I sometimes wonder if he&#39;ll survive my <br/>
insecurities.  <br/>
