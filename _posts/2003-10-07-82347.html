sign for his bedroom door!)  He loves them.  There&#39;s a really cool one that&#39;s <br/>
big and clear with another little one inside it, he was practicing his <br/>
multiplication with it, having fun, seeing if he could get bigger and bigger numbers <br/>
without getting a low one, and other games he made up.    We also love <br/>
Yahtzee, altho after four games in a row,  I&#39;m out.  lol But his adding, and mine, <br/>
are getting much faster, because he wants to roll again. <br/>
<br/>
He wants to go back and get more dice with more facets on them.  But, so far, <br/>
he&#39;s just raided his Dad&#39;s D&D dice bag. lol  <br/>
