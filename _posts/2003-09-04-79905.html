 </span></blockquote>Ren~<br/>
These are some really good ideas!!  Thanks for sharing.  I am going to do<br/>
the BHAG with my dd tomorrow.  I love these out-of-the-box ideas because it<br/>
is great to use non-schoolish solutions to &quot;schoolish desires.&quot; Besides, I<br/>
wonder what kind of BHAGs I can come up with for myself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe his desire to fit in (a normal thing) is just stronger right now? Too<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bad you don&#39;t have &gt;some COOL unschoolers to hang with!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But what about buying the Peter Kowalke documentary on grown unschoolers?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe finding &gt;some stories of cool grown unschoolers would help him see the<br/>
possibilities and help him feel &gt;not so unusual.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another thing I did with the kids last year (and I want to do it with them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>again) is BHAG&#39;S. Big Hairy Audacious Goals. Someone wrote about it in HEM I<br/>
believe (sorry for not remembering the name) and I thought it was really<br/>
cool. We&#39;d always written down ideas and goals, but I loved the NAME! So we<br/>
sat down and said what we&#39;d really, really like to do if there were not<br/>
limits in our lives. Some were reasonable, some were outrageous, but it gave<br/>
us a way to focus on that person&#39;s dreams and needs.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We had things like a trip to Disneyworld, building a robot, learning<br/>
 </span></blockquote>guitar (he DID!) and such. Some of them we accomplished, others are still<br/>
pending and yet others have become non-important in that time.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So maybe instead of giving into his schoolish desires (which it sounds<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like he&#39;s not really all that into) ask him for his BHAG&#39;S and share yours<br/>
with him.</div>
