<div id="ygrps-yiv-300321501">***Being an x-ray tech, I have seen<br/>
too many needless fractures in children because the parents were inattentive.***<br/>
<br/>
Do you know for sure that the fractures you see are due to a parent&#39;s inattentiveness, or are you assuming?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often been accused of &quot;letting&quot; my children climb too high on trees as well as do other perceived-as-risky things because I for the most part let my children decide their own climbing limits.<br/>
I&#39;ve been the recipient of those well-meaning but misguided dirty looks combined with saying to my child right over my head &quot;oh honey get down, you&#39;ll hurt yourself.&quot;<br/>
I know, for example, that my neighbor thinks I&#39;m neglectful because my toddler likes to jump off high surfaces in the backyard and I don&#39;t stop him.  She&#39;s actually said to me &quot;I can&#39;t believe you let him do that!  Aren&#39;t you afraid he&#39;ll get hurt?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m not saying that your particular situation was misguided... I wasn&#39;t there and it does sound like the child may have been in danger.  I&#39;m just saying that sometimes what looks like neglect on the mother&#39;s part and &quot;risky behavior&quot; on the child&#39;s part might actually just be a physically adept child and a comfortable, trusting mother.  (I&#39;ve been heavily influenced by the continuum concept by Jean Liedloff in this area). <br/>
 <br/>
I think there is a much grayer area here than when the child is actually being hurt physically or verbally by a parent.<br/>

I&#39;m okay with growing a backbone too (I definitely need one), I just wouldn&#39;t want my backbone to backfire on the child I&#39;m trying to defend! :-/<br/>

One example I was thinking of was an infant who broke his femur when his mother left him in a car seat on top of a clothes dryer at a laudromat.  He was kicking and I guess it tipped over and landed on the floor.  The mother said she wasn&#39;t paying attention......she felt so horrible about it.  <br/>

I think this is some of what Myranda was trying to convey in the<br/>
beginning.  It just got buried in all the other statements and chat.<br/>

I think this is what Alice Miller refers to as an &quot;enlightened witness&quot;- meaning a person who makes it clear to the child-victim that there is another way.  If memory serves (I haven&#39;t read her in a while) I believe she actually says that it&#39;s the presence or absence of &quot;enlightened witnesses&quot; in an abused child&#39;s life that make the biggest difference in the long term outcome for the child.<br/>
