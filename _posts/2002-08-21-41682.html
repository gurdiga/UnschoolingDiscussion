that tape?!!? &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>

Holly needs me to come see Between the Lions, and I&#39;ll look after while for <br/>
the exact details on the tape ordering!</div>

I wish you would send it so it could be put on a website even if HEM <br/>
publishes it.   Dan Vilter is thinking about doing a webpage with notes and <br/>
links, and if he ends up deciding against that I&#39;ll do it myself!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836718987">i want to add a bit about the music part.<br/>
  growing up my father was a musican, i travled around with a bluegrass band <br/>
and was in many a nite club as a child, and the one thing i can tell you is <br/>
most of the time what offends one is just the way another may view it. i do <br/>
not believe in censorship at all i think artist have the right to write music <br/>
or lyrics that express how they feel or view things and as an american they <br/>
should be able to do this without worrying that their art will be <br/>
compromised.<br/>
 however i also believe you have the right to feel differently about these <br/>
things and you may or may not choose to listen. we are very open minded at my <br/>
house so something said in an em song isn&#39;t such a big deal because it has <br/>
been explained that because its right for him don&#39;t mean it should be taken <br/>
to heart and that alot of what he says is just his way of venting what is <br/>
building up rather than actually acting these things out. i am not an em fan <br/>
but my daughter loves him and is currently researching his life(her choice). <br/>
however i do like marylin manson, i don&#39;t always agree with him but i like <br/>
his music, i also enjoy flatt and scruggs, bill monroe, the osbourn brothers <br/>
etc. the message of the song doesn&#39;t mean the listener has to agree and act <br/>
in these ways. just my thoughts!<br/>

<br/>
To me, to put on Dan&#39;s or my video-game-defending webpage.<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether if you put it right out here on this list if that would make it less desireable for HEM, or if Helen and Mark have decided they can&#39;t use it or what.  But I would put it where those really serious about considering video games as real and good could find it easily.<br/>

unschooling/videogames/kids. Do you need my address? The thing with the cows <br/>
is kinda cute. Daxter rides on Jax&#39;s back and every time Jax slaps one of the <br/>
cows, Daxter goes flying! Jack just giggles. (Jack has a very cute and <br/>
infectious giggle.) <br/>
