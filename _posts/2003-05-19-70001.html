 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m kind of getting something that&#39;s happening here.<br/>
<br/>
My partner Beth and I had a long discussion about a minister we know, who is <br/>
a friend as well as having been a minister we both worked with. Gail did <br/>
something that disappointed Beth. Nothing horrible, but something Beth <br/>
believed Gail was better than. (Gail, in retrospect, probably felt the same <br/>
way.)<br/>
<br/>
Beth and discussed the fact that ultimately, ministers are people, and <br/>
sometimes they miss the mark. Beth agreed, but also said, &quot;But I guess I <br/>
expect ministers to be better than that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All ideas of religion aside, I think Sandra serves more as a minister than <br/>
and &quot;expert.&quot; As a result, probably we all expect more from her. Is this <br/>
entirely fair? Well, maybe not, but there it is, and I&#39;m sure that Sandra <br/>
knows that part of her reputation as someone people can turn to when they are <br/>
struggling with unschooling depends on her being able to maintain some of <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Then...lo and behold! Sandra is not perfect! Sometimes she gets cranky, or <br/>
tired, or pissed off, or just reaches the end of her rope with someone who <br/>
seems committed to not getting it. Sometimes she has trouble getting what <br/>
someone else is saying. Sometimes her patience just runs out. This e-mail <br/>
thing is hard, and Sandra, it turns out, is human. <br/>
<br/>
The point here is not to excuse anyone -- minister, Sandra, Mother Theresa -- <br/>
when they miss the mark, but to understand that we also have to take <br/>
responsibility for our own expectations of others. My experience of Sandra is <br/>
that  Sandra takes full responsibility for when she turns out to be human. <br/>
<br/>
There ya go, Sandra...ya went from being Expert to a minister.... scary, huh?<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers get a lot of that, too, and I was a teacher very young.  Twenty one. <br/>
 And I found that anything I did was a matter for community scrutiny.  And I <br/>
would say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m 21,&quot; and hear, &quot;Yes, but you&#39;re a *teacher.*&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the SCA, same thing.  I was grumpy at something a friend did yesterday, <br/>
and said of all the knights I respected most I didn&#39;t expect HIM to screw up. <br/>
 Why did I have to throw in that he was a knight?  Because he was.  Because <br/>
he&#39;s so many people&#39;s favorite and a role model. <br/>
<br/>
I could have said &quot;of all the dads I know&quot; or &quot;of all the cops I know...&quot; and <br/>
guess what?  It was a cop-job anyway.  I wanted him to write a letter of <br/>
recommendation to get Marty into the Junior Police Academy camp (which he did <br/>
write, and I thought it was way late, but turns out they extended the <br/>
deadline so I got better).    But because I thought he had screwed up, I went <br/>
for the highest rank, and that was knighthood, not police-officer-tude.<br/>
