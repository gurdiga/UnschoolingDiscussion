<div id="ygrps-yiv-44372784">Thanks sandra!<br/>
I have really appreciated reading your posts and the kind and thoughtful way<br/>
you communicate and answer questions for those of us new to unschooling.<br/>
I&#39;m still a little baffled by the TV thing.<br/>
It was helpful to read joyce&#39;s post about how the thoeries stack up against<br/>
the hard evidence of homeschooled kids with unlimited television. It&#39;s just<br/>
really hard for me to get all the information about TV&#39;s negative effects on<br/>
the brain out of my own brain. I am an attachment parenting Mom, nursed my<br/>
first until he was 4, tandem nursed when my second came along who is still<br/>
nursing at 5 and have devoured many books on parenting and wanting to do the<br/>
best thing for my kids. All the books posted on previous list i&#39;ve read and<br/>
agree are wonderful. But it seems like in the attachment circle, many of the<br/>
books tout the dangers of tV. Rahima balwin &quot; you are your childs first<br/>
teacher&quot; and true many waldorf inspired books and authors have led me to<br/>
believe that the best place for the TV is in the closet. And it has come and<br/>
gone there many times. My biggest struglle is that i feel my 5 year old<br/>
would sit there for hours on end watching. At what point does the<br/>
self-monitoring occur in the child? Is it the forbidden fruit that is the<br/>
temptation and then soon dwindles. I&#39;d really like to hear from other moms<br/>
who have had this same concern and who have come through to the other side.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t beleive that a little TV is bad. It&#39;s the 4 or 5 hours a day that<br/>
worries me that his brain is not being creative in other ways and is<br/>
absorbing the ideas of others on what the world is like. And it has been<br/>
shown that the brain works differently when watching a TV program . We limit<br/>
the TV to 2 hours a day. But even at that i still hear, &quot; mom can i watch<br/>
another show?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So whats the real scoop?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231613129">Hi Christine...we just got rid of tv restrictions last october and my worries were the<br/>
same as yours. I have been very pleasantly surprised. The tv is on more during the day,<br/>
but it does not have the same appeal. My oldest used to sit glued, but now he is up<br/>
and doing other things while the tv is on. He no longer feels that he *has* to watch tv<br/>
every day. In the past, if we were out and runnng around and did not get back until<br/>
late in the day, he would pitch a fit if he had not watched his hour of tv. Now he<br/>
does not mind, he knows that he can watch it tomorrow. I have also seen that if I start<br/>
to do something interesting (like set up the train set or start cooking) they will<br/>
more then likely come join me. Before nothing could tear them away from their 1 hr <br/>
of tv.<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning, the boys watched quite a bit of tv. But I can tell you now that we<br/>
do not watch anywhere near 4-5 hours of tv a day. Some days we watch more and some<br/>
days less, but even if it is on, we are usually doing something else at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Try it, I think that your kids will surprise you. Mine did (they are 6 and almost 3).<br/>
<br/>
I posted our experiences a couple of days back. I will post them here now again (feel<br/>
free to skip if you saw this before!)<br/>

Ok, I am a hundred or so messages behind, but wanted to write a quick one. I used to <br/>
believe those studies about tv and we definitely limited it. What convinced me to <br/>
change my mind was realizing that the warnings to not let your kids watch more then<br/>
2 hrs/day were based on kids who were in school all day. Betw school and homework,<br/>
if kids were watching more then 2 hrs/day, they most likely were not doing much else.<br/>
For our kids, 2 hrs/day is really not much when you look at all the &quot;free&quot; time they<br/>
have. There is tons of time for them to do other things.<br/>
<br/>
We lifted restrictions on tv back in october and it has worked great. They definitely<br/>
watch more then the 1 hr/day I previously let them, but I have found that they<br/>
are now doing other things while watching (previously my oldest (6 yo) would<br/>
pretty much sit transfixed). Now he builds legos, bounces on his mini trampoline,<br/>
plays with his brother etc. Much of the time the tv is more background noise. I have<br/>
also noticed that they do use the tv to relax...after we have had a really exciting day<br/>
and also to transition to waking up in the morning (all 3 of us usually cuddle on the <br/>
couch and watch blue&#39;s clues). <br/>
<br/>
Things I have also noticed is that they don&#39;t fight when we have to go somewhere and<br/>
turn off the tv. When my ILs were visiting, they hardly turned it on at all (my ILs<br/>
love playing with the boys). It is pretty easy to get them involved in other things<br/>
(mainly with the tv on). The tv no longer goes on first thing when we get home and <br/>
Jason has started asking me to put on music. I have seen no loss in creativity...they<br/>
still like to do lots of stuff. It has cut back on arguments and I like that I no<br/>
longer make them feel bad for liking something &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The only downfall is that I have lost my &quot;never-fail&quot; option...before lifting restrictions<br/>
if I had to get something done (phone call etc) I could always let them watch tv...doesn&#39;t<br/>
hold the same attraction nowadays...<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve had three five year olds who did NOT sit for hours on end watching, <br/>
though they could have.<br/>
<br/>
Self monitoring occurs at some point after they have the opportunity to self <br/>
monitor.  It cannot possibly begin to happen as long as the parent is <br/>
monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Is it the forbidden fruit that is the<br/>
temptation and then soon dwindles.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t beleive that a little TV is bad. It&#39;s the 4 or 5 hours a day that<br/>
worries me that his brain is not being creative in other ways and is<br/>
absorbing the ideas of others on what the world is like. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are ways kids can be creative watching pictures of other continents or <br/>
listening to music or watching musicians or artists which are not ways they <br/>
can be in their homes otherwise.  Absorbing the ideas of others on what the <br/>
world is like has been the basis of learning for a long time, hasn&#39;t it?  <br/>
Comparing what we thing to what others think is a GREAT way to boost <br/>
creativity and deep thought.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; And it has been shown that the brain works differently when watching a TV <br/>
program . &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What shows did they use for those tests?  Have you read the details on the <br/>
test group?  Every time I&#39;ve actually read the details of these tests I&#39;ve <br/>
thought &quot;lame.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Kids tested with the same little piece of video, whether they&#39;re interviewed <br/>
afterward or wired up or whatever, were not in their own homes, not watching <br/>
shows of their own choosing, and in every way they were in a testing <br/>
situation designed by someone intending to prove something.  What was the <br/>
researcher&#39;s motivation?  What were his methods?  <br/>
<br/>
When I let kids do what they need, my motivation is to give them the <br/>
opportunity to learn to make decisions based on real factors.  And when they <br/>
watch something that&#39;s making them think, making them sing, making them <br/>
wonder, making them discuss what and why, that meets my top priority in life, <br/>
which is helping them find opportunities for input, ideas, information, <br/>
amusement.  They&#39;re learning all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly watched Simpson&#39;s; just now turned it off.<br/>
<br/>
Between 8:00 and 9:00 Kirby and I watched 24 together.  I was fifteen minutes <br/>
late, having taken Holly to class. Kirby caught me up on what I&#39;d missed at <br/>
the commercial.  Marty had been watching some gameshow for a while in the <br/>
afternoon (whatever Donny Osmond is hosting, a word game) and forgot to turn <br/>
it off.  I turned it off.  Kirby was watching a rerun of That 70&#39;s Show while <br/>
he was answering e-mail this afternoon.   Before Holly went to class she was <br/>
curling her ponies&#39; tales with the TV on, but turned it off mid-show to come <br/>
hang around with me.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the day&#39;s tv report.  Nobody sat for hours.  Everyone&#39;s been online at <br/>
one point or another.  All the malefolk are too sick to go out.   Kirby and  <br/>
Marty are upstairs laughing and playing a card game at the moment.  Keith ate <br/>
and went back to bed.  He&#39;s going to try to go to work again in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We limit<br/>
the TV to 2 hours a day. But even at that i still hear, &quot; mom can i watch<br/>
another show?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do they ever forego that two hours?<br/>
Do you limit books?<br/>
Music?<br/>

It&#39;s different for every child. Depends on the child, depends on how long <br/>
you limited them and depends on how well you stop those limitations. I mean <br/>
really stop them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763748002">One of Joseph&#39;s favorite TV shows when he was about 5 was The Price is <br/>
Right. He also loved some grocery shopping show. Not sure where he even <br/>
found that one as I never watched it. Of course it all changes with is age <br/>
and moods. He still likes Price though. And he loved Millionaire when Regis <br/>
had it at night. Does he still watch SpongeBob Squarepants? Of course he <br/>
does. But the point is he watches all kinds of stuff along with that. And <br/>
it&#39;s never 4-5 hours a day. Sometimes he doesn&#39;t make it through even a half <br/>
hour show. Sometimes he sits and watches 2 of them back to back.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra love Animal Planet. She wants to be a vet now. Joseph gets bored with <br/>
that station and usually leaves. Sierra has Alyssa watching it now. She&#39;ll <br/>
even come into the living room if Joe and I are watching something and she <br/>
tells us to put on Animal Planet for her. She just very recently started to <br/>
watch TV. She&#39;s a 2 years and 4 months now and just started watching last <br/>
month. She always has had access to it and knows how to turn it off and on. <br/>
Just wasn&#39;t interested until now.<br/>
<br/>
Tara is 17 and never had restrictions on how much to watch or what to watch. <br/>
Plenty of times her room is quiet and she&#39;s drawing and coloring. Plenty of <br/>
times she has on her radio or playing cd&#39;s. Her TV goes on at 11:00 p.m. and <br/>
she falls asleep to Golden Girls. It&#39;s her favorite show and she knows the <br/>
dialog word for word on given one!!<br/>

My daughter watched hours of cartoons when she was younger. She developed<br/>
a talent for drawing... what else but cartoon looking caricatures. I<br/>
believe she was &quot;studying&quot;.<br/>
My son spent today watching hours of  &quot;The Tale of the Gun&quot; on the<br/>
History channel, a history-thon on guns. I asked if he ever got tired of<br/>
watching these gun programs, I swear they all look the same. He said<br/>
these were ones he hadn&#39;t seen before. He told me that he&#39;d watched so<br/>
many before that now he knows a lot of it already but there&#39;s always<br/>
something new. <br/>
My children watch tv a lot but rarely without doing other things at the<br/>
same time. For example my son drew two pretty detailed guns today. <br/>
I believe because we have no limits on tv time they seek out interesting<br/>
programming. They have time to watch the strictly fun and silly stuff but<br/>
they choose to watch the &quot;educational&quot; stuff too.<br/>
I do feel the need to remind them once in a while to turn it off and go<br/>
outside if it&#39;s exceptionally nice out, but it&#39;s usually not a problem.<br/>
They&#39;re good about doing things in moderation.<br/>

don&#39;t limit TV at all and never have. It is on most of the day, usually PBS, <br/>
Nick Jr, etc...My 5yo son watches a little TV but prefers books or play while <br/>
my 3yo daughter watches it for hours and hours. She will turn down play, <br/>
crafts or me reading to her and if I turn off the TV so we can listen to <br/>
music or do something else, she gets angry and turns it back on.  I know that <br/>
she is definitely learning stuff from the TV but it concerns me that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do ANYTHING else.<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

<br/>
It even makes sense that if kids aren&#39;t taught the things they need that<br/>
they won&#39;t learn them. Especially math.<br/>
<br/>
But the real question is does the theory match reality? There are unschooled<br/>
kids here with unlimited access to TV. Are they zombie-like? Are they<br/>
lacking in imagination? Do they turn on the TV the moment they get up and<br/>
are pulled away kicking and screaming at bedtime? Are any of the things the<br/>
authors conclude will happen happening to these kids?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My biggest struglle is that i feel my 5 year old<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everyone who has said that and has truly let go of the limits -- that is not<br/>
just for a couple of weeks but forever -- has found their kids can realize<br/>
that TV will always be accessible and can choose to not watch TV.<br/>
<br/>
My 11yo daughter does take binges both watching and not watching.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At what point does the<br/>
&gt; self-monitoring occur in the child?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends. If you expect the child to &quot;self monitor&quot; to an hour a day then<br/>
the answer is never. If you expect the child to be able to freely choose<br/>
what they find most interesting at any given time, then after they gain the<br/>
confidence that TV won&#39;t be restricted any more, then they will obviously<br/>
self-limit to how much they want to watch. It may be more than you&#39;d choose<br/>
for them, but it would be self-monitoring all the same.<br/>
<br/>
There may be stumbling blocks. There should be opportunities that are more<br/>
interesting than TV. If TV is the most interesting thing in the house, then<br/>
limiting TV is like schools covering up the windows so kids will will find<br/>
the teacher more interesting than the blinds. They may not want to miss a<br/>
program. Kids can feel trapped by the TV station&#39;s schedule. If they don&#39;t<br/>
watch something now they can&#39;t watch it. But learning how to operate the<br/>
record on the VCR helps there :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think many on this list are attachment parenting, I am, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean you follow anything blindly.  Book are great for reading but you have <br/>
your own instincts.  I attachment parented before I knew there was a term for <br/>
it.  I have read and read about all these topics and I choose to let my <br/>
children have choices in their lives.  Yes, even at this age.  My boys have <br/>
always had the choice where TV is concerned, they are 5 and 8 now.  They <br/>
watch TV more on some days and not at all on others.  It is their choice.  I <br/>
believe that by allowing them choices in their lives now and always they will <br/>
be able to make choices all through their lives and there won&#39;t be this shock <br/>
when they turn 18 or 21 or whenever the magical number is.  <br/>
<br/>
They are learning how to make choices.  For us TV is just another tool.  <br/>
Another something to explore.  And just because they are watching TV doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean they aren&#39;t learning or processing something else they did that day.  <br/>
Also my boys don&#39;t just watch TV.  I watch it with them and I can answer <br/>
questions.  TV starts a lot of interesting conversations about a variety of <br/>
topics.  I don&#39;t just sit in the corner wondering if they are learning or <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway toooo much on this topic for me.  I am sure others on here have much <br/>
better information for you.  It takes time to get it sometimes.  <br/>

Is she happy watching TV? Or is she using it as a way to avoid something?<br/>
Did you just move or is there upsetness in the family?<br/>

concerned if she did anything for that many hours at a stretch so I don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s just because it&#39;s TV as opposed to books, Barbies, or anything <br/>
else. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s an &quot;age&quot; thing.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; teacher&quot; and true many waldorf inspired books and authors have led me to<br/>
&gt; believe that the best place for the TV is in the closet.<br/>
 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The more I learn about Waldorf schools and Rudolf Steiner, the less respect I <br/>
have for them.<br/>
<br/>
It sure does SELL well to peace-loving, artsy, loving parents with cash, <br/>
though.   Their assertions about music and art sound good and soothing while <br/>
you&#39;re first hearing it, but from the point of view of art or music they seem <br/>
like nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
And one of the saddest homeschooling stories I&#39;ve ever heard was of a family <br/>
where the parents became suddenly SO sold on Waldorf stuff that they went in <br/>
and cleaned out their son&#39;s toys.  Everything with faces and everything <br/>
plastic was swept up and trashed.  And they presented him with his new <br/>
improved &quot;guaranteed&quot; nurturing and wonderful new toys.  But the little boy&#39;s <br/>
favorite thing had been a My Little Pony, and it was thrown away without <br/>
consultation.  He had not only no interest in the new faceless wooden pony, <br/>
but felt hugely betrayed and hurt.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s another example of parents looking at a &quot;program&quot; instead of at their <br/>
own child.<br/>
<br/>
This article is fascinating, by a mom who volunteered at a Waldorf school:<br/>

<br/>
Whatever all they MAY be, Steiner/Waldorf-trained parents are NOT unschoolers <br/>
and they&#39;re not involved in natural learning.  It&#39;s a bunch of very <br/>
attractive superstition.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve certainly not earned any right to suggest what&#39;s good for my kids in <br/>
their own homes, nor did Steiner  have anything to say about TV (since he <br/>
died in 1925).   <br/>

<br/>
Will she do other things while she&#39;s watching?  If you give her playdoh and <br/>
molds and a flat surface and some cool tools, will she do two things at once, <br/>
at least? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she likes it because she herself can turn it on and off.<br/>
<br/>
Is it winter where you are?  (I hate to assume, since there are people here <br/>
who are having a nice summer &lt;g&gt;)   Can you rent some good videos with music <br/>
that you&#39;d both enjoy?<br/>

last night and rented some movies they requested. (They&#39;re going thru a huge <br/>
Wizard of Oz phase and the library&#39;s copy was gone. :(  I&#39;m checking half.com <br/>
today for a used copy. The love for Wizard of Oz bemuses me, because when I <br/>
was my kids&#39; age I was terrified of the Wicked Witch and the flying monkeys!<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions!<br/>
