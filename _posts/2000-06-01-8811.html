<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827704029">My son and I love &quot;James and the Giant Peach,&quot; and &quot;Charlie and the <br/>
Chocolate Factory.&quot; We&#39;ve read them both many times. James does lose his <br/>
parents (like in the first page of the story -- it&#39;s not dwelled upon), and <br/>
his aunts are awful to him! (Til they get squashed by the peach - ha!). But <br/>
I do know other sensitive kids who manage OK with that. I think the rest of <br/>
the books make up for it. You could see what you think.<br/>
<br/>
My 7yo has similar tastes. I am trying to balance our fantasy, fairy tale <br/>
and myth reading by offering to read books that are a bit more <br/>
down-to-earth, like &quot;Shiloh&quot; and &quot;Black Beauty,&quot; but he turns up his nose!<br/>
