<br/>
Daily digest.<br/>
You can get a whole bunch of posts in one email, very easy to scroll through and skim the stuff you aren&#39;t interested in, stopping to read the ones that you care about.<br/>
It&#39;s a big list, but digest makes it manageable for even those that aren&#39;t online much....myself included.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Works even better if you first sort by subject. I read the first and last <br/>
posts in a thread to see if they&#39;re interesting. (The last one in case the <br/>
subject has changed but not the subject liine.) I hate digests because you <br/>
have to go through the whole thing. And it&#39;s harder to save the posts I <br/>
want to save from a digest.<br/>
