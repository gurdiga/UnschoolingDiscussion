<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154853598">this just make me completely and utterly physically sick to my stomach.  i&#39;ve<br/>
never use these facilities but this is beyond anything i could have or can<br/>
imagine.  i want to believe this is one of those &#39;urban myths&#39; but saddly the<br/>
truth is probably closer to it being a reflection of our societies utter<br/>
disregard for the safty and well being of other peoples kids.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Hi, My name is Lauren Archer, my son Kevin and I lived in Midland,<br/>
&gt; TN.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;On October 2nd, 1999 I took my only son to McDonald&#39;s for his 3rd<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;birthday.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;After he finished lunch, I allowed him to play in the ball pit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When he started whining later on, I asked him what was wrong, he<br/>
&gt; &gt; pointed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the back of his pull-up and simply said &quot;Mommy, it hurts.&quot; But I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;find anything wrong with him at that time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I bathed him when we got home, and it was at that point when I found<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;welt<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;on his left buttock. Upon investigating, it seemed as if there was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;like a splinter under the welt.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I made an appointment to have it taken out the next day, but soon he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;started<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;vomiting and shaking, then his eyes rolled back into his head.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From there, we went to the emergency room.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;He died later that night.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It turned out that the welt on his buttock was the tip of a<br/>
&gt; hypodermic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;needle that had broken off inside.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The autopsy revealed that Kevin had died from heroine overdose.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The next week, the police removed the balls from the ball pit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;There was rotten food, several hypodermic needles: some full; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; used;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;knives, half-eaten candy, diapers, feces, and the stench of urine.<br/>

<br/>
thanks for the link,  though i didn&#39;t send the orginal out just made a<br/>
comment on my physical react to it.  it&#39;s a sick story and i&#39;m relived that<br/>
it turns out to be false.<br/>
<br/>
Ball Pit Tragedy<br/>
<br/>
            A little boy died after sitting on a heroin-filled syringe in a<br/>
playground ball<br/>
            pit.<br/>
<br/>
            Status:   False.<br/>
<br/>
            Despite claims made in the e-mail, the Houston Chronicle did<br/>
not run a story<br/>
            about this child&#39;s death. This is a cautionary tale about the<br/>
danger of dirty<br/>
            playground ball pits, nothing more.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303600600">I understand that it makes you upset. It does the same to me. I own a list<br/>
where this exact letter circulated, and we are now discussing what WE have<br/>
witnessed in the past at such playplaces: Messy diapers (without children)<br/>
urine smells (not from our children BUT on our children) food and drink<br/>
spilled, and dried blood to name a few. My dd had a nosebleed in one of the<br/>
tubes, and I told McDonalds about it. They closed the playplace down for the<br/>
rest of the evening.<br/>
I have sent out misguided information before, and I know how important it is<br/>
to know what is being sent. Many things are circulating right now, the gas<br/>
out being the most popular. But it is hard for those on digest to receive<br/>
the legends...<br/>
