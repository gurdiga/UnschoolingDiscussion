I&#39;m really sorry!  That WAS &quot;this morning&#39;s&quot; when the post was written.  I shopped with Holly yesterday (to do with Marty&#39;s upcoming wedding&quot; and then I slept early and long.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday&#39;s Just Add Light quote was <br/>
&quot;When kids know their parents are on their sides, when parents help them find safe ways to do what they want to do, then kids do listen when we help them be safe.&quot;—Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
<br/>
It came from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/partners/child">http://sandradodd.com/partners/child</a><br/>
<br/>
Depending on the parents&#39; beliefs, &quot;help&quot; will be one thing or another (or a combination of many things, and maybe even some discouragement).<br/>
<br/>
More and more research is coming along to show that the &quot;two gender&quot; model isn&#39;t as clear nor as valid as we&#39;ve seen it.  Some languages even allow for more than one reference (having an intermediary or &quot;other&quot; category.  <br/>
<br/>
When Holly filled out forms recently to apply for a visa to visit India, the gender question was not male or female.   It was male, female, transgender. <br/>

They are put on something more akin to hormone-blockers. This is, almost universally, considered a better option if there&#39;s any indication that this is a course they&#39;d like to continue along. And these &quot;hormone blockers&quot; are also given to children who are NOT transgendered but who are, for whatever reason, experiencing puberty too early.<br><br>The benefit of hormone blockers is that they are completely reversible and, if discontinued, even fertility levels can be normal. A better descriptor can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=protocol-youth">http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=protocol-youth</a> . <br><br></div><div>The question of surgery is another matter (one that is usually moot, anyway, as most doctors would not consider doing this type of surgery on a younger child and you are typically required to live as the gender you &quot;present as&quot; for a good length of time). Also, keep in mind, surgery is not always desired as part of &quot;transitioning&quot;. In fact, most of my friends who are transgender have specifically chosen not to have surgery (with the notable exception of chest reduction - which, if they&#39;re on hormones pre-puberty, should not be an issue).<br><br></div><div>- Misa<br></div></span></blockquote></div></div></div>

<h4>CASS KOTRBA</h4>
<time>19 Oct 2014, at  9:15am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708336444">﻿
<html><head>
 
 
<style></style>
</head> 

 
<div>-=-&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that there are more than two genders and also 
that there are endless gender &quot;presentations&quot;. -=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is a subject I&#39;ve been pondering about.&nbsp; I have chickens.&nbsp; A 
couple of years ago I had some young roosters who became aggressive with the 
hens and people so we harvested them.&nbsp; I had a chicken who was clearly 
developing as a hen, she was about 6 months old, and I called her Helen.&nbsp; 
Two or three weeks after all of the other roosters disappeared from the flock I 
noticed Helen start to change.&nbsp; She started sprouting long tail feathers 
&amp; her legs &amp; ankles became more masculine.&nbsp; Eventually she started 
to crow like a rooster &amp; even hop on the hens as if mating with them.&nbsp; 
At that time I changed her name to Pat as I really wasn&#39;t sure if she was a male 
or female.&nbsp; I had heard that if you have a flock of chickens with no 
rooster that one of the hens would take on that role but I was surprised at how 
much this role change transformed Pat&#39;s appearance and behavior.&nbsp; Pat has 
not dropped testicles and can&#39;t fertilize eggs.&nbsp; He/she is not quite a full 
rooster but is definitely not a hen.&nbsp; Something in between that I don&#39;t 
have a word for.&nbsp; Pat has never become aggressive with the hens or people 
and is a great addition to the barnyard, whatever Pat&#39;s gender.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also have had&nbsp;ducks for 3 years.&nbsp; When I had males the entire 
flock was&nbsp;pretty sexually active.&nbsp; After we harvested the males I 
noticed that it did not take long for the female ducks to regain their sexual 
activity with the females taking on the role of a male.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s 
one particular female, I think they take turns but they look so similar it&#39;s not 
really easy to say for sure.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So it is obvious to me that in the wider animal kingdom there is much more 
flexibility in sexuality than is allowed for in our&nbsp;culture.&nbsp; 
(Although I believe that many Asian cultures do&nbsp;allow for more flexibility 
in sexual identity.) We tend to think of sexuality as a black and white, fixed 
thing.&nbsp; Animals do not follow this rule.&nbsp; For them, sexuality and 
gender identity seems to be quite malleable.&nbsp; It has been a very 
interesting, unintended learning experience for myself &amp; my kids.&nbsp; I 
mention it to most people who come to visit our little farm &amp; you can watch 
the wheels start turning in their heads.&nbsp; :D</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Similarly, I really enjoy watching my various critters take on the role of 
motherhood.&nbsp; I&nbsp;enjoy watching how loving and relaxed they are with 
their young.&nbsp; They are definitely unschoolers and I learn a lot from 
them!&nbsp; They each have their own sweet&nbsp;little language that 
they&nbsp;use to communicate with their babies.&nbsp; I love seeing how the 
desire to protect their young changes them.&nbsp; I had a duck that went broody 
this spring - meaning she wanted to hatch eggs into babies and would refuse to 
leave her nest.&nbsp; This normally timid, docile little duck went into warrior 
mode.&nbsp; Anyone coming close to her nest would face her wrath.&nbsp; She even 
bit me - hard - the couple of times I tried to get in there to check on her 
nest.&nbsp; About a month after the first duck went broody I had a second one do 
the same.&nbsp; I bought fertilized eggs for both of them to sit on.&nbsp; The 
first duck managed to hatch 2 ducklings -&nbsp;and then something unexpected 
happened.&nbsp; The 2 ducks teamed up.&nbsp; Both ducks started 
taking&nbsp;caring of the ducklings and sitting on the remaining eggs.&nbsp; 
They took turns and supported each other in the sweetest way.&nbsp; They did not 
manage to hatch any of the remaining eggs but they both took ownership of 
the&nbsp;ducklings that had hatched.&nbsp; I would never have expected them to 
act cooperatively in this way and it really made me think.&nbsp; They are an 
adorable little family.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181685868">(Sandra and Vicki, I responded to this, but then it said my post didn&#39;t send, and I couldn&#39;t get it back. I&#39;ll try to be more brief here, but please feel free to delete if the first one came through after all.)<br><br>Vicki, my sibling &quot;living as another gender&quot; was younger than my by 4 years. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s exactly the right expression for it, but she was born a girl, told my mom at age 4 that she wished she&#39;d been born with a penis, wanted to be called Rick or Spike, and wanted a buzz cut for her next haircut. She never liked to answer the other kids&#39; question, Are you a boy or a girl? I think if she&#39;d had more choices or certainly if the question weren&#39;t loaded, she might have found a term she felt comfortable with, but I don&#39;t think it was either of those.<br><br>This was in the Deep South in the early 1980&#39;s. I think my mom was pretty progressive in the ways she handled it at the time. She didn&#39;t let my sister get a buzz cut, but she did let her get a pixie cut. She was fine with my sister wearing leather jackets and high-top sneakers and sometimes gray facepaint on her cheeks and chin to look like a 5 o&#39;clock shadow. (And not just around the house, but to restaurants, the mall, etc.) She didn&#39;t just tolerate or even simply accept my sister, but she joyfully supported her; I remember her giving my sister gifts of a dinosaur pillowcase, a brown felt fedora, and any number of He-Man figures, Transformers, and Micromachines. She didn&#39;t ask the teachers to call my sister &quot;he&quot; or &quot;him,&quot; but she empathized mightily when my sister came home upset that she wasn&#39;t allowed to line up with the boys at the restroom break before recess. My mom was a quiet champion. She was very shy and reserved and not inclined to advocate for us out in the world, but she made our family life one characterized by solid, unwavering, loving support.<br><br>I think my sister just gradually moved into a different identity. She stopped wanting to be called Rick. She grew her hair out a bit. When she had her first communion (we were raised Catholic), she asked not for slacks and a white shirt but for a neon pink dress. (My mother took her shopping for this and bought it; what snark she had to suffer at the ladies&#39; Altar and Rosary Society meetings I don&#39;t know--she never mentioned it.) She joined the track team at school, and competed on the girls&#39; team without issue. <br><br>It is a great regret of my life that I was not more kind or supportive of my sister during this time. I was 8 to 12 years old myself, and was teased mightily for being awkward, chubby, wearing thick glasses, and going through puberty early. I didn&#39;t have the strength or the room in my heart to accommodate her differences, and I resented the negative attention my sister&#39;s ambiguous gender sometimes drew to me, by extension. <br><br>I posted about my sister when I asked the question so that others here would know that I did not ask about trans children with a gawking curiosity but rather with a sincere heart and a personal history. The unschooling lens has, for me, offered the most respectful, sensible, loving, and creative perspective when looking at past experiences, current realities, and possible futures with children, so I wanted to ask her for help seeing from that point of view.<br><br>Teresa</div>
