Oh I get it now - I&#39;m not a regular poster, therefor my opinion doesn&#39;t<br/>
count.  It doesn&#39;t matter that we&#39;ve been unschooling or whatever you<br/>
want to call it for many years now.  It doesn&#39;t matter that my opinion<br/>
has raised two bright, inquisitive, daring, funny and smart kids.  I<br/>
joined this list the first time over a year ago and was disgusted by the<br/>
attitude of people here - I still am. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe going for a walk and breathing clear air and looking at the stars would <br/>
help this shrill attitude.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a list for the purpose of welcoming newcomers and massaging their <br/>
feelings and giving them a cup of tea.  It&#39;s for discussing how kids learn <br/>
without being taught, without lessons, without a curriculum.  And children <br/>
can and do learn that way.  So, if people want to talk about that this will <br/>
be a really great place for them.  And if they want to display the chip on <br/>
their shoulder and insult other people and display their defensiveness, it <br/>
will not be much fun for them OR the rest of the readers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe breathe deeply, and don&#39;t post everything you think.<br/>
