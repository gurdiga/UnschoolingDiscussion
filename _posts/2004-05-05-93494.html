Yesterday the girls I took to the playground (4 & 6) immediately took off their shoes.  As this was happening a parent (or possibly nanny) was telling a 2yo to keep her shoes on because the wood chips are sharp and could give her booboos.  The 2yo had a perplexed look on her face as she watched the two girls taking their shoes off while i gladly collected them and put them under the bench where i sat.  Later as my dd was climbing up the slide a little boy at the top cried out angrily, &quot;you are not allowed to do that&quot; and then when noticing her bare feet repeated, &quot;you have to wear shoes, you are not allowed to do that.&quot;  Poor kid was totally confused when he saw second little girl without shoes.<br/>
<br/>
While i smiled at the girls freedom to be themselves and explore life, i was saddened by the number of children who were there being controlled by their caretakers.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that inherent in unschooling is the willingness (and courage) to not follow the accepted norm and being controlled by other&#39;s definition of danger and risk.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I took my kids to a local playground a week or so ago and there were a few boys there, about 10 or 11 maybe. No parents but me. The boys had their sneakers off and Catherine saw this, figured that was how it was done and slipped hers off to play. A little while later I got curious and asked the boys why they weren&#39;t wearing their shoes and one replied that they slid a lot better down the slide without them and the round gravel felt really good on their socked feet. Very good reasons I thought. I can just imagine the mess a couple  of controling parents might have made of that situation. A situation where all involved were happy, polite and having fun.<br/>

  You know what, I&#39;m not really sure.  Most of the parents I know get in a tizzy because their kids might &quot;step on something&quot; sharp.  Tetanus comes to mind.<br/>
<br/>
  But my kids ran in barefeet even in winter.  Sometimes I had to get after them to wear socks and shoes, just because they were having so much fun, they&#39;d forget to come back in and then their feet were in agony.<br/>
<br/>
  But in summertime, I say go for it.  I like being barefoot too, but I&#39;m worried I&#39;ll step on a bee.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4480510">I can tell you that in the Dominican Republic (where my family is <br/>
from) it is more about status than safety.  Since it&#39;s such a poor <br/>
country, many kids run around barefoot because they can&#39;t afford <br/>
shoes. So if you have them, you wear them. It seems stupid but I <br/>
know that in the hispanic communtiy it&#39;s more about it being a sign <br/>
of poverty than about safety.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959774338">Dunno. I&#39;m a big barefoot gal, and I still vividly remember my uncle<br/>
screaming at my cousin for going barefoot. I thought he was sooo mean!<br/>
<br/>
My kids all go barefoot all the time. I think people are nervous about<br/>
stepping on things like glass, splinters, rusty metal (which would require<br/>
that dreaded tetanus shot), hand/foot/mouth disease, bee stings, worms,<br/>
impetigo, ringworm, yadda, yadda. Both my mother and mil have made comments<br/>
about the kids going barefoot because we have a dog. Well, I grew up going<br/>
barefoot in a yard with a dog, so... I try to be really good about cleaning<br/>
up after the dog to reduce chances of picking up anything, but really I<br/>
think it just boils down to the fact that Americans live in a culture of<br/>
fear. *sigh* Everything has become dangerous because we hear fear mongering<br/>
news bits on it every night.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738332300">I&#39;ve always wondered this myself.  My DH is this way too.<br/>
I never wear shoes unless I have to!  The first think I do when I get home is take off my shoes!<br/>
Needless to say, my kids hardly ever have shoes on, and can never find them when we need to go somewhere.<br/>
My DH puts his shoes on to walk around in the house!?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lived my whole life like this, and other then a few splinters never had a problem.  My Mother who is 72 is also like this.  In fact, she used to tell me she was part Indian because of that, and I believed her.  (by the way she is still like this at 72)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       The American South was all about small-town, red-clay barefoot <br/>
freedom. We could go into the library, grocery store and even sit at the drugstore <br/>
soda fountain barefoot. (And did, every chance we got, because these places were <br/>
the very first to be air-conditioned, when even our homes were not.)  Oh, and <br/>
the movie theatre was air-conditioned and very popular then; I don&#39;t remember <br/>
anyone barefoot at the Saturday matinees, and I always had on shoes myself, <br/>
but it was mostly dark so who knows? <br/>
<br/>
       I had spectacular accidents while barefoot as a child in a culture <br/>
with that laid-back attitude toward kids and shoes. I don&#39;t mean mere bee stings, <br/>
although after a half-dozen you might think I would have put on shoes. &lt;grin&gt; <br/>
Seems like everybody had mosquito and chigger bites all over (not a barefoot <br/>
issue) but also ringworms were common, which I always understood came from <br/>
running around barefoot where animal feces had deposited the rascals.  I can&#39;t <br/>
vouch for the truth of this, it wasn&#39;t something I ever looked into or <br/>
contracted myself -- we&#39;d just hear our moms mention that so-and-so was being dosed for <br/>
worms again but what could you expect in the summer when everyone was <br/>
barefoot?<br/>
<br/>
       I had two real injuries stepping on metal and being carted off to the <br/>
emergency room to be stitched up (and yes, to get another tetanus shot.) A <br/>
rusty nail where you&#39;d least expect it,  and my grandmother&#39;s tin flower bed <br/>
border that I stepped backward onto (cutting my big toe to the bone) while washing <br/>
the car with a garden hose (a perfect time to be barefoot and great fun until <br/>
the blood started gushing!) I remember all the towels I soaked through in the <br/>
back seat and how much the numbing shots right in the wound hurt, and being <br/>
laid up on the couch with my foot propped up on pillows watching through the <br/>
big window while everyone else played outside, barefoot of course -- <br/>
<br/>
       Also I was barefoot one time when three of us girls caught a horse <br/>
peacefully grazing in the back pasture. I was trying to hold him without benefit <br/>
of even a rope much less a bridle and reins, so we could climb on for a <br/>
barefoot-bareback ride, and got my foot broken when a hoof came down on it. I doubt <br/>
that shoes would have made much difference that time.<br/>
<br/>
       So there&#39;s plenty to worry about. You should see the size of the bugs <br/>
and lizards here, even in the garage and sometimes in the bathroom! But <br/>
nothing requires us to live terrified, in a tizzy, or to ruin everyone&#39;s fun. It is <br/>
what it is. And even in the South, the world is different now, The <br/>
all-barefoot, all-the-time world is gone but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mainly because of fear <br/>
and spoilsport parenting. I&#39;d guess that liability laws, the rise of the car <br/>
culture, and the South&#39;s population explosion have more to do with it. <br/>
<br/>
       For us personally, the air-conditioned house and unschooling has a lot <br/>
to do with why my kids -- now 8 and 14 -- never incurred any of these <br/>
barefoot ill effects, not even one bee sting. They do enjoy being in the grass <br/>
barefoot, but generally they don&#39;t spend nearly as much time outside as I did as a <br/>
child (we were always shooed outside but never shoed outside , LOL)  JJ<br/>

Ringworm is NOT worms. It&#39;s a fungus. If you get it on your feet, that&#39;s<br/>
athlete&#39;s foot. You can get it from skin to skin contact with infected<br/>
people or animals. From contact of a surface infected by same or very<br/>
rarely, from the dirt. It&#39;s really not a big deal when you get it and can be<br/>
cleared up quite easily nowadays.<br/>

life - I remember many summers that I never put ON a pair of shoes the <br/>
whole summer. For my husband, growing up poor in a town with no paved <br/>
streets, no running water, no electricity, etc., not wearing shoes was <br/>
a sign of being too poor to wear out your shoes by wearing them to play <br/>
in and he&#39;s embarrassed by it. He had to get over it and, even now, <br/>
he&#39;ll say, &quot;Put on your shoes,&quot; when the kids or I are headed out the <br/>
door.<br/>

Ringworm is NOT worms. It&#39;s a fungus. If you get it on your feet, that&#39;s<br/>
athlete&#39;s foot. You can get it from skin to skin contact with infected<br/>
people or animals. From contact of a surface infected by same or very<br/>
rarely, from the dirt. It&#39;s really not a big deal when you get it and can be<br/>
cleared up quite easily nowadays.<br/>

<br/>
I wonder if some people are confusing ringworm with pin worms, which are<br/>
real worms.  They are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and may be<br/>
contracted by contact with feces.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097472098">My barefoot brother stepped on a spike that was sticking out of a board when<br/>
we were kids and it came out top of his foot.  It was really gross.(We were<br/>
tearing down an old barn at the time.  We were always barefoot.)    My kids<br/>
are welcome to go barefoot in the summer, but we do have thistles and after<br/>
stepping on a couple, the kids generally prefer to wear sandals when they<br/>
are running around in the grass.  There are no stopping the thistles as we<br/>
live downwind from a farm where they grow rampant.  When Clement Moore wrote<br/>
&quot;and away they all flew, like the down of a thistle&quot; he wasn&#39;t kidding.<br/>
Those little fluffies fly like snow in a blizzard across the sheep pasture<br/>
next to our house only to germinate and grow on our lawn.   I wouldn&#39;t trade<br/>
the farm next door for a thistle free lawn though.  <br/>

I dunno, maybe having a kid like me? I&#39;ve stepped on broken glass, <br/>
nails, pins, needles, rusty cans, burning cigarettes, bees, fish <br/>
hooks, and spiders. My parents took me to the ER so many times, I <br/>
think I knew all the staff by name. The worst was a curved <br/>
sailmaker&#39;s needle. It snapped off in my foot, stuck into the bone, <br/>
and required surgery to remove.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is though, if a person wants to go barefoot, it&#39;s darned <br/>
hard to stop them. My folks tried with me. I guess if all those <br/>
painful consequences didn&#39;t stop me, pretty much nothing would. My <br/>
kids go barefoot a lot too. I try to just give them information about <br/>
when it might be a good time to put on shoes, and hope they have <br/>
better luck than I have. <br/>

You can treat lice without putting harmful chemicals on your DD&#39;s <br/>
scalp.  Mothering magazine had a fantastic article on it a few years <br/>
back and I kept the issue, but they also have the article online at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mothering.com/10-0-0/html/10-2-0/10-2-confessions92.shtml">http://mothering.com/10-0-0/html/10-2-0/10-2-confessions92.shtml</a><br/>
<br/>
Coincidentally, the day after this issue arrived in my mailbox, my next <br/>
door neighbor called me all freaked out because her younger DD had <br/>
gotten lice and they had used 3 of those Rid kits and the lice were <br/>
still there, but her poor DD&#39;s scalp was so damaged that she just <br/>
couldn&#39;t put another dose of it on her.  I gave her the article and a <br/>
bottle of olive oil right then and it did the trick.  Another friend&#39;s <br/>
child got lice a few months back and they tried this too (without using <br/>
Rid at all) and it worked for them too.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  :)<br/>

Still four years after moving into our house I am finding glass in my back yard! And huge chunks of it too. I think it is becuase our house is over 100 years old and it used to be used for a compost or something. So what I did is took them to Target and had them pick out something that might not feel like shoes in the summer, that they could go in and out of the pool in and stuff and they all chose to get matching watershoes for the backyard.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238164494">There are a couple of &quot;common&quot; animal (dog feces)  parasites that remain in the soil. These are usually problems in hot climates where there is not enough frost to kill them.<br/>
Hookworm  is a common one. Roundworms is another.<br/>
These woud be commonly spread to small children or other people who sit on the ground  where dogs spend their time and defecate. Usually the form of contamination would be from putting &quot;things&quot; in their mouths that had been in /on the ground.<br/>
Toys, soothers/baby bottles, fingers, dropped food. unwashed garden produce.The eggs develop  in the soil and will live   in the human body feeding  in the human intestines<br/>
Roundworms  are not usually as big a problem to the human system but are very common in puppies and kittens and  the adult form is commonly seen in unwormed puppies. <br/>
Other parasites can be spread by cats using childrens sand boxes  as litter boxes.<br/>
The most at risk are young children who put soil and toys in their mouths.<br/>
 Bare skin -feet or otherwise  in itself  would not be a risk factor.<br/>
Regular pet worming and removable of pet feces  works but people should be aware of the &quot;stray&quot;cat problem  around kids sand boxes.<br/>
On the other hand fresh cow manure from cows on pasture  can have  an antibacterial effect and was often used as a &quot;poultice&quot;.<br/>
The  fact that  dewormers have  become so popular and that there is more awareness of sanitation  has made a huge difference.<br/>
The girls riding instructor and I were noting just yesterday  that we dont  usually see  Bot Fly eggs on horses any more  now that Ivermec is so commonly used as a horse dewormer. It gets  the larval stage that used to be missed by other  dewormers.<br/>
That used to be pretty gross  at  one of the developmental stages   LOL<br/>
I spent  most summers as a kid never wearing shoes  in our northern ontario  rural  area. I remember my Dad bitching about it spreading our feet as I could never fit my shoes  in the fall and he had to fork out all of $5 to buy more. Reality  about kids was never his strong point.<br/>

only had to soak my foot in soapy water every day for 10 days or two weeks (I <br/>
forget which, now) for a half hour. After about the second day (I had the <br/>
choice of the shot or the soaking), I wished I had gotten the shot, because it <br/>
took so much time out of my playing every day! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

We went down the lice road MANY times when our kids were younger and <br/>
in public elementary school.  It was horrible!  We tried EVERYTHING!  <br/>
The only thing that we found to work was constant &quot;picking&quot; and olive <br/>
oil.  The olive oil is great because when you find a bug you can put <br/>
the bug in the oil, and they die instantly.  <br/>
<br/>
The most important thing is to use a flushable cloth while pulling <br/>
eggs and bugs from the hair.  Put them all in the cloth and flush <br/>
when you are done.  You can put the oil on the hair, and you don&#39;t <br/>
have to worry about harming your child.  It does help to eliminate <br/>
the bugs, but you MUST constantly pick through the hair.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stress enough how important it is to pick thoroughly through <br/>
the hair.  Keep checking their heads daily for a week or two.  It&#39;s <br/>
SO EASY to miss just one egg, and then the process starts all over <br/>
again.  It&#39;s a terrible chore!  Oh, another helpful hint is to look <br/>
through their hair outside.  You don&#39;t have to worry about dropping <br/>
any on the floor, and it&#39;s WAY easier to see in the sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you the best of luck in this pain in the neck, literally, <br/>
situation.  We have seven kids, five girls that all had long hair.  <br/>
It&#39;s been years since we&#39;ve been through it, but I still have the <br/>
messed up fingertips to prove it.  I feel for you...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908248869">Another thing I&#39;m not sure was mentioned or not, is that it&#39;s important to <br/>
treat the child again 7 to 10 days later (I&#39;d do it probably on the 7th and 9th <br/>
day to be safe.)  Once an egg hatches, it takes (I believe) 8 to 10 days for <br/>
the louse to begin laying eggs itself.  So if you treat the child, then treat <br/>
them again in 7 days, (and maybe again a couple of days after just to be really <br/>
safe) you will kill any bugs that have hatched, but have not begun laying <br/>
eggs yet.  I usually treat my child, then treat them again in about 7 or 8 days, <br/>
then treat them again in another 7 or 8 days.  We&#39;ve never had a <br/>
re-infestation doing this.<br/>
<br/>
One of the more unpleasant things about this whole process, is figuring out <br/>
where they got it from.  My kids got lice once in CA, and kept getting it <br/>
repeatedly until I figured out my babysitter&#39;s granddaughter had a head COVERED in <br/>
bugs and nits. <br/>
<br/>
Although it&#39;s embarassing, it&#39;s best to let people your kids have  been in <br/>
close contact know that they had lice, so they can check their own kids.  It <br/>
will help them catch it before it gets bad, and if they are the ones who <br/>
originally gave it to you, they can handle it and neither of you will have to worry <br/>
about it afterwards.  <br/>
<br/>
And ALWAYS check your kids every so often for nits, especially at the nape of <br/>
the neck and behind the ears.<br/>

&lt;&lt;   What is it about bare feet that terrifies so many American parents? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think partly it was all the bare feet in the Depression.  Having just spent <br/>
the weekend with my inlaws, who are 80ish (one over and one under) and frugal <br/>
and picky, I&#39;m freshly reminded.  They don&#39;t want ANYTHING to remind them of <br/>
the depression.  (Yet they seem to want to keep reminding everyone else of it <br/>
in words and rules and such.)<br/>
<br/>
So if you HAVE shoes, by god wear them.   So partly it&#39;s social pressure, <br/>
passed down a couple of generations.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a few city parks in Albuquerque in which I asked the kids to <br/>
keep their shoes on.   One was down by the river in a neighborhood past <br/>
downtown, and the ground had things like broken miniatures bottles, broken vodka <br/>
bottles and condoms.  Used.  Another had a few broken bottles and lots and LOTS <br/>
of stickers.   But most of the parks, I don&#39;t mind and they do have more fun in <br/>
the sand without shoes than with.<br/>
