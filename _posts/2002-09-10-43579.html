<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050718211">I was/am an xray tech and I have personally seen films of very small children ( I would guess they were under 3)  who swallowed gum and had a small bowel obstruction.  It was rare..........I have only seen it twice but at the hospital I worked we didn&#39;t see a lot of small kids.....they usually went to AR Children&#39;s Hosp.  <br/>
