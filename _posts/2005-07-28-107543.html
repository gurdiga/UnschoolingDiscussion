<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884226386">I just want to remind everyone that the conference&#39;s Early Bird <br/>
Deadline is THIS Sunday, July 31.<br/>
<br/>
Postmarked by that date is fine---don&#39;t bust a gut to try to get it <br/>
here *before* then.<br/>
<br/>
Funshop presenters also need to fill out registrations! Just because <br/>
you&#39;re working doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t wear a nametag! Please get <br/>
registrations to me.<br/>
<br/>
If you have decided not to come and have an already reserved hotel room <br/>
you will not be using, please announce it on the <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:LiveandLearnConference@yahoogroups.com">LiveandLearnConference@yahoogroups.com</a> e-list. I know someone will be <br/>
willing to take it!<br/>
<br/>
And isn&#39;t it cool about the RV parking at the hotel? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>
