<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351504581">It is always hard to tell if what you are doing is &quot;working&quot; or if you are<br/>
making some giant horrendous mess of everything.  I think it is human and,<br/>
in particular, mommy nature to worry about our parenting skills.  And<br/>
particularly for those of us who didn&#39;t have the greatest examples to learn<br/>
from!<br/>
<br/>
Over the years we&#39;ve had our ups and downs and our little &quot;family&quot; has grown<br/>
and shrunk depending on how many foster and &quot;adopted&quot; children we currently<br/>
have living with us.<br/>
<br/>
But, when it is all said and done, the holidays always bring a card or phone<br/>
call from one of &quot;our&quot; kidlets that tells me &quot;ya ain&#39;t doing so bad, keep<br/>
following the same path.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what was written in a card we received on Christmas Day from one of<br/>
our &quot;adopted&quot; boys.  This kinda card makes it all worthwhile and makes the<br/>
self-doubts go away at least for a little while!<br/>
<br/>
You two have given me<br/>
     what no one else can,<br/>
Respect and responsibility to<br/>
     be a young man.<br/>
<br/>
You shone light on the darkness<br/>
     and opened my eyes,<br/>
To learn from my mistakes<br/>
     and go on with my life.<br/>
<br/>
From drama with mama<br/>
     or trouble in court<br/>
You two would never stop<br/>
     givin me support.<br/>
<br/>
But I can&#39;t pay you back<br/>
     for all the good that you&#39;ve done<br/>
But I recognize the family<br/>
     that loves me like a son.<br/>
<br/>
Now when I speak,<br/>
     it&#39;s HONESTY before fear!<br/>
Merry Christmas and<br/>
     have a Happy New Year.<br/>

&gt; I think this has to do with how much damage was done and how much<br/>
&gt; insecurities it caused.<br/>
&gt; I spent many years oblivious of my own insecurities, still trying to get<br/>
&gt; my &#39;mother&#39;s approval&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I&#39;ve been working on cutting that line for many years. Sometimes, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t always keep my confidence and her words shake me. Sometimes, I can<br/>
&gt; shake them off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    The wounds inflicted (knowingly or not) by parents seem to linger at<br/>
&gt; &gt;least a lifetime.  Have you found families you actually have friendships<br/>
&gt; &gt;with who have manged to develop adult-adult relationships with grown<br/>
&gt; &gt;children? </span></blockquote></div>

Makes it all worthwhile, doesn&#39;t it! That was a lovely poem. I like gifts like this more than presents~ (coming from one who is struggling to break away from livingin a material world, that&#39;s saying something!)<br/>
