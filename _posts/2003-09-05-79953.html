<div id="ygrps-yiv-790296189">Thank you, Pam, for this discussion between your daughter and yourself.  I<br/>
forwarded that post to my daughter so she can check out the links if she<br/>
wants to.<br/>
<br/>
I sat with my daughter today and read to her this entire thread and all the<br/>
replies.  According to her, Fanfiction is a site where writers critique each<br/>
other.  If someone wrote a story that had the wrong rating, people would be<br/>
complaining almost instantly.  My daughter writes stories and people write<br/>
what they think of them.  She changes her stories or keeps them the same as<br/>
she feels fit, but it gets her thinking about her audience, who they are and<br/>
what they want.  One thing about that site is that when an author has been<br/>
critiqued many times, new people come to read the story, so my daughter<br/>
sometimes critiques herself just to get people to come read her stories.  It<br/>
just seems to me that X rated stories could find their way onto that site,<br/>
but they wouldn&#39;t last very long.  Plus, since new writers have to be<br/>
critiqued to get people to read their stories, they probably will not have<br/>
very many people who actually read them, anyway.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Don&#39;t laugh - yes we were IMing from different rooms in the same house -<br/>

&gt; PSoroosh (10:38:07 AM): how much X-rated type of stuff do you run into on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fanfiction.net?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PSoroosh (10:38:19 AM): people on unschooling discussion are warning other<br/>
 </span></blockquote>parents about it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:38:21 AM): Basically none, since the new policy...<br/>
&gt; PSoroosh (10:38:27 AM): how about before the new policy?<br/>
&gt; PSoroosh (10:38:29 AM): a lot?<br/>
&gt; PSoroosh (10:38:50 AM): and - is there still stuff left there since the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>new policy? Do you run into ANY?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:38:52 AM): They used to allow nc-17 fics, but now<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nothing over R. And before that, most people /did/ categorize their fics<br/>
properly...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:39:05 AM): Occasionally someone will post some lemon<br/>
 </span></blockquote>under &#39;G&#39;. But it&#39;s rare and it&#39;s really obvious from the start.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PSoroosh (10:39:09 AM): how much should parents of, say, 10 yo&#39;s, be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>worried?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:39:12 AM): Nah.<br/>
&gt; PSoroosh (10:39:29 AM): well - you&#39;re on the list, temporarily, want to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>post about it firsthand?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PS! oroosh (10:39:38 AM): or I should pass along your experience?<br/>
&gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:39:45 AM): Lemons rated G are so badly written anyway<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(people writing highly rated stuff that&#39;s well-written ALWAYS post them<br/>
correctly) that most people don&#39;t bother reading them very far in. *g*<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:39:48 AM): Go ahead..<br/>
&gt; PSoroosh (10:40:18 AM): is nc-17 same as X?<br/>
&gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:40:20 AM): I don&#39;t read on ff.net much anymore<br/>
 </span></blockquote>anyway, it&#39;s not selective enough, and there&#39;s far too much drivel.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PSoroosh (10:40:26 AM): or are there two different levels?<br/>
&gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:40:28 AM): Yeah, basically.<br/>
&gt; PSoroosh (10:40:32 AM): okay<br/>
&gt; PSoroosh (10:40:34 AM): what do you read?<br/>
&gt; PSoroosh (10:40:43 AM): anything else to suggest?<br/>
&gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:40:47 AM): I love sugarquills.net for Harry Potter<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fics...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:41:21 AM): fictionpress.net, ff.n&#39;s sister site for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>original works, has some good stories - MUCH harder to write a decent origi!<br/>
nal story than fanfic, so there&#39;s a higher percentage of g ood fics vs. bad.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PSoroosh (10:41:40 AM): can you send me an email with this info?<br/>
&gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:41:48 AM): For other HP, and also Cats and the other<br/>
 </span></blockquote>few fandoms I read fics of, I usually have one or two fansites I browse. I<br/>
don&#39;t read fanfiction much anymore, mostly just write.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:41:51 AM): Sure...jas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://go.to/godawful">http://go.to/godawful</a> is a fun site for reading good writers/editors&#39;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>takes on really bad fics...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.subreality.com/movieverse.htm">http://www.subreality.com/movieverse.htm</a> is a superb X-men fanfic archive.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOADs of fics, good layout, v. navigable and fastloading. Easy to read<br/>
format is also a plus.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/xmenmoviefanfic/index2.html">http://www.geocities.com/xmenmoviefanfic/index2.html</a> the previous one&#39;s<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sugarquills.net">http://www.sugarquills.net</a> SugarQuills is a great place to find quality<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Harry Potter fiction, because, unlike ff.n, they have a selection process,<br/>
so not every fic gets in. Still, not every single fic is top-of-the-line,<br/>
but there is some  really good stuff here, and you don&#39;t have to sort<br/>
through the piles and piles of rubbish you get on ff.n.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sekaiseifuku.net/puppyfarm.html">http://sekaiseifuku.net/puppyfarm.html</a> Has a few nice fics, but they&#39;re<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ALL Sirius/Remus slash, not an archive, a personal site, so if you&#39;re not<br/>
into S/R, then... ;) If you /are/, or are willing to suspend disbelief,<br/>
they&#39;re VERY well-written.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://azkabanslair.slashcity.org/">http://azkabanslair.slashcity.org/</a> I haven&#39;t browsed Azkaban&#39;s Lair much,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so I don&#39;t know everything about it, but it has at least a few good stories,<br/>
and it&#39;s selective, like Sugar Quills. I think Azkaban&#39;s Lair is solely, or<br/>
at least primarily, S/R slash.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.catsfanfiction.ipfox.com/">http://www.catsfanfiction.ipfox.com/</a> Cats fanfics, it seems to be down<br/>
 </span></blockquote>right now, but it&#39;s REALLY good when it&#39;s up. VERY beautiful layout, great<br/>
stories. I have a couple posted here. ^_~<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.catsfanfiction.com/">http://www.catsfanfiction.com/</a> &lt;-- Very much the same as the one above it,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but not as many fics. I haven&#39;t seen it up in ages, so I&#39;m guessing the<br/>
downtime is permanent...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I used to have a TON of Cats links, but I&#39;ve lost all but a couple, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>none of them are fanfics except my own - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kalliroscope.net/9lives/">http://www.kalliroscope.net/9lives/</a><br/>
&lt;-- shameless plug there, but I like to think that some of my fics (about<br/>
95% of the fics on Nine Lives are by me) are pretty good...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Googling for fanfiction + whatever fandom you&#39;re into usually works quite<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well. Also, there&#39;re LOADS of webrings dedicated to fanfiction.<br/>
