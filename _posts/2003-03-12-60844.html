Fewer students feeling the sting<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
TALLAHASSEE -- Two-thirds of Florida school districts still spank students, <br/>
although the latest state numbers show that suspensions are increasingly the <br/>
preferred mode of discipline.<br/>
<br/>
About 11,000 Florida students felt the paddle during the last school year, <br/>
according to the Florida Department of Education, most of them in small, <br/>
rural counties. Larger, urban counties are spanking fewer children, opting <br/>
instead to send them home or sentence them to programs that include <br/>
&quot;in-school&quot; suspension, where the students are segregated from their <br/>
classmates.<br/>
<br/>
In Hendry County, a district that ranks second in the state for spankings, <br/>
veteran educator Rick Shearer said he might suspend more students if it <br/>
weren&#39;t for the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test. After a few swats, <br/>
children can return to class.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re under pressure for the kids to pass the FCAT and to do the best we can <br/>
with these kids,&quot; said Shearer, principal of Westside Elementary School in <br/>
Clewiston, south of Lake Okeechobee. &quot;If they&#39;re not in school, it&#39;s hard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hendry County is one of 10 mostly tiny districts that in 2001-02 accounted <br/>
for the majority of school spankings, about 6,500. Parts of the Panhandle, <br/>
North Florida and Hendry saw a rise in corporal punishment, while much of the <br/>
rest of the state saw a drop.<br/>
<br/>
Many Florida school administrators haven&#39;t lifted a paddle in years, part of <br/>
a national trend toward banning the controversial practice altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Administrators at Narcoossee Community School in Osceola County don&#39;t spank, <br/>
even if parents request it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve had a parent pleading if you&#39;ll just do it [spank], he&#39;ll straighten <br/>
up,&quot; said Principal Jim DiGiacomo, adding that in-school suspension works <br/>
well to curb discipline problems for his students because they hate the <br/>
isolation. &quot;You can impose the consequences and you can control what&#39;s going <br/>
on because they are with you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Schools turned to corporal punishment 10,685 times in the 2001-02 academic <br/>
year, state records show. That&#39;s a tremendous drop from the 124,295 paddlings <br/>
issued in 1985-86.<br/>
<br/>
The small, rural districts issued the most spankings. Florida&#39;s 10 smallest <br/>
districts, with less than 1 percent of all students, accounted for 10 percent <br/>
of spankings. In contrast, the 10 largest districts, with 63 percent of the <br/>
state&#39;s total enrollment, accounted for 8 percent of spankings.<br/>
<br/>
More than 240 spankings were reported in four Central Florida counties -- <br/>
Orange, Osceola, Polk and Lake. However, Dianne Lovett, a district <br/>
administrator in Orange, said the five incidents reported there appear to be <br/>
clerical mistakes. Orange banned corporal punishment in 1993, Lovett said.<br/>
<br/>
The American Academy of Pediatrics, National Association of Elementary School <br/>
Principals and other child-advocacy groups oppose corporal punishment, citing <br/>
research through the years linking childhood paddlings to depression, <br/>
delinquency and lower rates of college graduation.<br/>
<br/>
A new study by a longtime family violence researcher suggests that spanked <br/>
children don&#39;t read or do math as well as their peers.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;An extension of the parent&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Florida lawmakers let school districts decide what&#39;s best, however. About a <br/>
third of the 67 counties have stopped the practice under pressure from <br/>
parents and children&#39;s advocates, or because they feared lawsuits or <br/>
complaints to police.<br/>
<br/>
Mike Elmer, whose son, Nick, is a second-grader in DeLand, is glad Volusia <br/>
County schools no longer paddle. Elmer doesn&#39;t spank his child.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The way I look at it, the school is an extension of the parent and if the <br/>
parent doesn&#39;t do it, why should the school?&quot; Elmer said.<br/>
<br/>
Volusia parent Cheryl Fitzpatrick disagrees. She thinks parents should be <br/>
able to request spankings because the threat of being sent home may not carry <br/>
much weight.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think you telling them &#39;You&#39;re going to get suspended&#39; probably just makes <br/>
them happy,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
In Polk County, where administrators paddle the most of any Central Florida <br/>
school system, only some elementary schools still do it. Now, schools mostly <br/>
suspend students, said Deputy Superintendent Rusty Payne.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s a lot of things we suspend for now that I probably would have given <br/>
kids three licks for,&quot; said Payne, a former high school principal of 16 years.<br/>
<br/>
In this regard, Polk is much like the rest of Florida. Suspensions reported <br/>
statewide during the last school year totaled 480,655, more than double the <br/>
202,262 for 1985-86.<br/>
<br/>
Changing behavior<br/>
<br/>
Educators concede that spanking is not always effective, but the same goes <br/>
for suspensions. Instead of going home to study or contemplate poor behavior, <br/>
many children end up playing video games and watching television.<br/>
<br/>
In-school suspensions don&#39;t provide the same opportunities for classroom <br/>
discussion and projects, which educators say are key to learning.<br/>
<br/>
Citrus County officials, who rarely spanked children last year, sometimes <br/>
rely on an alternative center as a way to discipline. Children who repeatedly <br/>
misbehave or commit serious offenses are transferred to the Renaissance <br/>
Center, where they can get more academic attention and counseling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The purpose of a discipline system is to change behaviors so learning takes <br/>
place,&quot; said Renna Jablonskis, the Citrus schools&#39; director of student <br/>
services. &quot;Spanking is quick to take effect but it doesn&#39;t have a long-term <br/>
impact.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Small districts often don&#39;t have the cash to build and staff alternative <br/>
centers, though. Neither can they always afford after-school detention <br/>
programs and in-school suspension programs, administrators said.<br/>
<br/>
Shearer&#39;s school in Hendry County was able to offer in-school suspension this <br/>
year because one employee is used for several tasks, including making copies <br/>
and monitoring students.<br/>
<br/>
A new attitude<br/>
<br/>
Florida is not the only state where paddling in school is out of favor. About <br/>
27 states have banned it outright, as have about 10 countries, including <br/>
Germany, Sweden and Denmark.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the change in attitude stems from research suggesting that paddling <br/>
is particularly harmful to elementary-school children, who also are the most <br/>
likely to be spanked. A new study contends that such punishment may be <br/>
counterproductive for school officials trying to focus children on their <br/>
studies.<br/>
<br/>
Murray A. Straus, who co-directs the Family Research Laboratory at the <br/>
University of New Hampshire, tested 622 children ages 5 and 6 across the <br/>
country. Those who were spanked by parents scored lower on a standardized <br/>
exam when tested again two years later, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Straus speculates that learning slows because spankings can cause stress on <br/>
children&#39;s developing brains. He hopes the American public, now obsessed with <br/>
standardized test scores, takes his study seriously.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People do say, &#39;I was spanked and I&#39;m OK&#39; and they&#39;re not lying,&quot; Straus <br/>
said. &quot;But it&#39;s like smokers saying, &#39;I smoked all my life and I don&#39;t have <br/>
lung cancer.&#39; It ignores the fact there are lots of people who do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
State Rep. Frank Attkisson, R-Kissimmee, argues that school boards should be <br/>
able to choose for themselves how to handle behavior problems. One disruptive <br/>
child, he said, can hinder an entire class&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We have to balance his [Straus&#39;] concern with the overriding concern that <br/>
every child gets a year&#39;s worth of education with a year&#39;s worth of dollars <br/>
spent,&quot; said Attkisson, who said he was spanked at home and in junior high. <br/>
He also spanked his three kids.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You have to give tools to school boards and let them be the deciders of <br/>
what&#39;s right for the students.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Prevention is key<br/>
<br/>
Irwin Hyman, a child-discipline expert who heads the National Center for the <br/>
Study of Corporal Punishment and Alternatives in Philadelphia, said the <br/>
answer to handling behavior problems lies in prevention.<br/>
<br/>
Schools can use praise and rewards to encourage students to concentrate on <br/>
assignments and behave well. They also can try to figure out why a child is <br/>
acting out -- and help alleviate the problem.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When you go to the doctor, they want to diagnose before they prescribe you <br/>
anything,&quot; Hyman said. School districts that spank &quot;are giving the medicine <br/>
before diagnosing what the problem is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hendry County principal Shearer said some answers to school discipline <br/>
problems may lie within families.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The kids behave at school pretty much the way they&#39;ve been allowed to behave <br/>
at home,&quot; he said. &quot;The bottom line is we have to have law and order in the <br/>
school so teachers can teach and students can learn.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
If you really want to put yourself into total shock about what is <br/>
actually going on in the schools go get a job as a substitute <br/>
teacher, especially in an urban school system.  I have written <br/>
volumes from my &quot;in the trenches&quot; experience as a sub.  It is so much <br/>
worse than most can imagine.  So if you live in an urban area and can <br/>
qualify for a sub license or certificate then try it, just for a <br/>
little while, and you will quickly know why we homeschool and why we <br/>
unschool.  So much psychological brutality out there that it amazes <br/>
me.  And the folks doing it really believe they are helping the <br/>
children.  I even run into parents who still say to me that if the <br/>
schools would just reinstate the paddle that things would be much <br/>
better!  I take the time to talk to them, to try to get them to <br/>
understand a different point of view.  Sometimes I think a little bit <br/>
gets through.  Most of the time, not.  <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t live in Florida, or the south, but in the heart of the <br/>
midwest, in Ohio.  Some days it is just too much and I can&#39;t sub <br/>
again for a long time.  Right now I am about to do some other <br/>
contract work, which will give me another bit to write about, <br/>
correcting state proficiency exams from different states.  That will <br/>
keep me out of the schools for the rest of this school year, but I am <br/>
sure I will have an even more interesting subject to report after six <br/>
months of learning all about these tests and how they are graded.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not up to subjecting yourself to being in the schools just <br/>
rest assured that paddling is not the worst of what is going on in <br/>
many of them.  <br/>
