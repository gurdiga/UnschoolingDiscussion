&lt;&lt; I also shop for my children in used clothing and toy stores.  I<br/>
frequently find things that are brand new, even in their original<br/>
package or with tags still attached.  In affluent neighborhoods, parents<br/>
overbuy and the kids never even use some of the stuff.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We got Holly $35 worth of clothes in a thrift store the other day.<br/>
<br/>
Seven pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Four of those still had the store tags on them.  Two we didn&#39;t notice until <br/>
we got home.<br/>
<br/>
Well the pink and white jeans didn&#39;t have the new tags, but the inspection <br/>
paper was in the front pocket, never been washed, and that&#39;s how we knew that <br/>
was new.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s thrilled with her haul!   Some of the items had been $40 new.  Looked <br/>
like someone&#39;s grandma had bought a girl two matching fancy shirts the girl <br/>
didn&#39;t like, because two colors of the same shirt were on the rack, all tags <br/>
intact.  Holly got one, not both, at $4.<br/>
<br/>
I love that my kids are willing to wear whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was told he should wear solid red or black to work, or shirts with a <br/>
collar (he doesn&#39;t want to), or t-shirts with logos of things they sell <br/>
there.   He&#39;s had things from time to time, but the games went out of print.  <br/>
So at Christmas I hunted around the internet and bought him t-shirts with <br/>
logos of some current games.  Since that expensive time (but fun, and <br/>
appreciated), he has gotten NINE free shirts from working Magic tournaments <br/>
or from card-set releases.   I can&#39;t believe the number of t-shirts he has <br/>
now, and is still wearing thinning things he&#39;s had for five years.  They <br/>
stretch along with him.  But because he doesn&#39;t go to school, nobody&#39;s saying <br/>
&quot;Kirby, you&#39;ve been wearing this shirt since 7th grade, don&#39;t wear it <br/>
anymore,&quot; or &quot;THIS shirt isn&#39;t cool, why are you wearing it?&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Marty was at the thrift store the other day and some youngish two-year <br/>
veteran struck up a conversation with Marty so he could insult him for <br/>
wearing camouflage pants.  Because the 22 year old had been in the service <br/>
and Marty was only 14, he took it upon himself to tell Marty that it was <br/>
disgraceful for him/Marty to be wearing those.    I found out about it later. <br/>
 Marty was amused, not embarrassed or insulted.  Because Marty hasn&#39;t grown <br/>
up with the kids at school telling him what to wear or not to wear, he has a <br/>
large amount of calm mental health about what he wears.  And that saves us <br/>
lots of money! (among other advantages)<br/>
<br/>
The reason he has camo pants is Keith&#39;s work did a family paint-ball weekend <br/>
and the boys had nothing good for paintball, so went to the military surplus <br/>
store.  Marty LOVED the pants, and has gotten two more pairs since.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has ended up being SO much more than how they learn to read and <br/>
do math.<br/>
