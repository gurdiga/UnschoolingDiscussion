&gt;to not leave the house a whole lot.  I certainly don&#39;t want to make<br/>
&gt;them feel bad about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too!  This is a good point and something I hadn&#39;t considered. Wow. I am <br/>
Ms. Busybody and love getting out to chat with other Moms, shop, etc. <br/>
Almost *every* morning we go out, there is a struggle because my son <br/>
*never* wants to go anywhere. (Well, occasionally he wants to go if it&#39;s <br/>
somewhere we&#39;ve been before and he&#39;s really excited about it, like a local <br/>
indoor play place he loves.) I always figured he was just &quot;in the zone&quot; of <br/>
playing in the house and once we got to our destination he&#39;d be happy. I <br/>
guess I need to start understanding that he may really prefer to stay home...<br/>
