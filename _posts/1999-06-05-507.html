<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167352271">OK, I should make this quick...It&#39;s after midnight and I&#39;m exhausted <br/>
and have to be up early.  Here goes:<br/>
I&#39;m Angela, mom to Abby-5; Mitchell-3; Noah-6months (wife to <br/>
Gary).  We live in Tampa, FL.  I&#39;ve been interested in hs&#39;ing for <br/>
about 3 years...started out thinking that we&#39;d have cute little desks <br/>
and bulletin boards.  Wow!  Have my ideas evolved...I really like <br/>
unschooling and Charlotte Mason, too.  Sometimes, though, it <br/>
feels like I&#39;m flying by the seat of my pants and I have to re-focus.  <br/>
I&#39;m wondering about what to do with Abby, as far as reading <br/>
goes...she seems like she wants to read, but she hates it when I <br/>
try to instruct her.  She gets upset and starts drifting.  But, on her <br/>
own, she&#39;ll write down letters and ask me what they say.  Her <br/>
favorite thing to write is &quot;I love u&quot;.  Any suggestions?<br/>
What type of doctor is your sis?<br/>
