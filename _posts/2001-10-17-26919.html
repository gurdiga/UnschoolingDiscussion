I have been through this twice.  The first time I believe was someone at<br/>
the school that my children used to attend.  It happened the first year<br/>
we hs&#39;ed.  The second time was two years later and I have since found out<br/>
it was my husband&#39;s insane cousin who turned us in.  Both times the<br/>
&#39;allegations&#39; were provably false.  And both time CPS refused to tell me<br/>
who turned me in.  Here is my advice:<br/>
1.  Stay very calm.  It is unsettling for them if you are way more stable<br/>
than they are.  (worked wonders the second time they showed up.  I was<br/>
too exhausted to care - long story - and they were quite obviously<br/>
unnerved by my calmness.  So I just calmly told them to stay on the porch<br/>
tell me what they wanted to say and that I would respond &quot;soon&quot; which was<br/>
immediately by fax.) <br/>
2.  Respond in writing and include a statement that you consider this<br/>
allegation harrassment.<br/>
3.  Insist on getting a letter that say the case was closed as unfounded.<br/>
 <br/>
I have since taken to writing or faxing CPS occassionally and asking them<br/>
what their policy is regarding harassing complaints and if the person who<br/>
is turned in falsely has any recourse.  I like to point out that clause<br/>
in the consitution about facing your accuser occassionally too.  It does<br/>
absolutely nothing but in the long run, it may make them see that<br/>
innocent until proven guilty has some merit. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and if you want to talk off list feel free.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Question about CPS<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am floored.  CPS showed up at my house this afternoon, supposedly<br/>
&gt; responding to a report that I am neglecting my children&#39;s education <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; physically and verbally abusing them.  The kids, thank heaven, were <br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; here at the time as they were visiting my mother.  I did not let  them<br/>
&gt; inspect my home as they did not have a court order.  Did I do the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>right<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thing?  What do I do next?  I live in New York State.  No, I&#39;m not a<br/>
&gt; member of HSLDA yet, as my oldest son isn&#39;t 6 yet, so I have no  legal<br/>
&gt; obligation to send him to school nor file any paperwork.  Any voice  of<br/>
&gt; experience would be appreciated.<br/>
