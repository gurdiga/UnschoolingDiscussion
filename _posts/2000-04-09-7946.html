<div><font size="2">If this looks odd, it&#39;s cos it was 3 separate emails that I 
decided should go together, but I don&#39;t want to spend time editing them 
now.&nbsp; Hope no-one minds :-)</font></div>

<div><font size="2">Bridget, I know what you mean.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to get 
offensive, but I don&#39;t mean that formula is &#39;just as good.&#39;&nbsp; It&#39;s an 
inferior product, but babies can still thrive on it, my own daughter, touch 
wood, has no physical problems with it.&nbsp; The point is that unless people 
take breastfeeding down from it&#39;s pedestal and say &#39;This is the natural thing to 
do,&#39; some people are going to hold it up as an unapproachable ideal, which I did 
to an extent with the general lifestyle portrayed in the Art of Breastfeeding 
(GB and NZ version from about 10 years ago.)&nbsp; I was heartbroken when I 
couldn&#39;t continue breastfeeding Heather, partly because I&#39;d held it up so 
high.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#39;ve been sent the article I was talking about, I&#39;ll attach 
it.&nbsp; If the group doesn&#39;t accept attachments, I can send it privately to 
anyone who wants it, or if the consensus of the list agrees, I can cut-and-paste 
it to the list.&nbsp; It explains what I mean much better than I can 
:-)</font></div>

<div><font size="2">Stephanie, you both deserve a big round of applause for being 
open to discussion, with your past experiences, and your dh&#39;s reservations about 
the benefits.&nbsp; I know you wanted the discussion closed, but I would like to 
add a few more thoughts.&nbsp; You don&#39;t have to read them if you don&#39;t want 
:-)</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I am glad that you have reached a decision that works for you 
both.&nbsp; And while I understand the desire for the husband to bond with the 
child, I think I have to point out that there are so many ways that we bond with 
our babies, feeding is only one of them.&nbsp; There are many breastfeeding 
fathers who feel well-connected to their children, and their partners no doubt 
feel indebted for their commitment to their families&#39; well-being.&nbsp; Yes, 
expressing milk is the next best thing to breastfeeding, with, according to the 
WHO other mothers&#39; expressed milk next and formula fourth and last on the 
priority list.&nbsp; I would add other mother breastfeeding (in cases where 
maternal breastfeeding is not possible, rather than not desired) &#39;wet nursing,&#39; 
below maternal breastfeeding in this list, because there is much more to 
breastfeeding than nutritional content.&nbsp; This is what was so upsetting for 
me. I knew that while some babies have allergic reactions to formula, some 
babies suffer medical problems later in life due to bottlefeeding, I have not 
suffered any visible effects (yet) from being bottlefed.&nbsp; I wanted my 
children to experience the whole experience of breastfeeding, the skin contact, 
the physical developmental differences...&nbsp; I wanted to experience 
breastfeeding, the hormonal rush, the skin contact.&nbsp; It was particularly 
important for me since Heather had spent time in SCBU&nbsp;that I become the 
only person who could provide this for my daughter.&nbsp; Other people can do 
anything else for a baby, and in some societies, even breastfeeding is widely 
shared.&nbsp; But it is a very special thing for a mother to share with her 
baby, and I am glad that I experienced it, and still do, with my second 
child.&nbsp; Now, if only I could persuade her to stop.... 
&lt;g&gt;</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Thanks for listening here, and I hope your dialogue continues, 
since I think that parenting issues are never really closed.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Tracy</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">PS&nbsp; I have to admire your commitment to expressing, I 
found it to be very difficult and did not produce enough to feed my daughter 
fully after a few weeks, even though I had provided for her completely while she 
was on the SCBU.</font></div>

<div>Wendy, <font size="2">you&#39;re right, that&#39;s why I made the point that I don&#39;t 
speak for LLL earlier :-)</font>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">But I&#39;d be interested to know what exactly you think gave LLL 
a bad name, either on or off list.</font></div>
