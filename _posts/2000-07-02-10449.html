<div id="ygrps-yiv-768476042">&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t use time-out or any other such form of punishment.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t remove &#39;privileges&#39; (what do people regard as privileges,<br/>
anyhow?  This is a serious question, btw, I&#39;ve never quite<br/>
understood this term) unless they were directly involved ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a funny story on this topic... I was with a group of moms and the <br/>
topic turned to toilet-training, and one of them, who was then very <br/>
determinedly training her 22-month-old son, said that when he messed up, she <br/>
would take away privileges.<br/>
<br/>
I was at a loss to imagine what would be a privilege for a 22-month-old... <br/>
bedtime story? his teddy bear?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59180021">Annette, I&#39;d find that funny if it wasn&#39;t so sad.  This seems to be a <br/>
pat phrase that comes up, and I for one am not that sure of it&#39;s <br/>
meaning.  I guess one would have to work out in advance with the <br/>
child what the &#39;privileges&#39; were.  Which seems to me to be an <br/>
indeirect way of saying to someone, &#39;we expect you to <br/>
&#39;misbehave,&#39; so we&#39;re establishing what your punishment will be <br/>
already.&#39;  Does anyone else follow this logic, or is it just me?<br/>
