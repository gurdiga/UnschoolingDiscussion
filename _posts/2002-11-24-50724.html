<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013275888">Patricia C. Wrede wrote some books that are fun for younger kids.  <br/>
&quot;Dealing With Dragons&quot;, &quot;Searching For Dragons&quot;, Calling On Dragons&quot;, <br/>
and &quot;Talking To Dragons&quot;. <br/>
There may be others.<br/>
These have strong female characters (human and dragon)  magic, fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Scott O&#39;Dell wrote a book called &quot;Black Star, Bright Dawn&quot;  with a female<br/>
lead, a young girl  and her dog in Alaska.   He wrote other books with<br/>
strong females.   Can&#39;t think of titles right now. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tatterhood and Other Tales&quot;  has strong female characters who know how<br/>
to solve their own problems.  These are strange folk tales from other<br/>
places.   <br/>
<br/>
And &quot;Not One Damsel In Distress, World Folktales for Strong Girls&quot;   by<br/>
Jane Yolen if you like Jane Yolen (&quot;Wizards Hall&quot;) - the Harry Potter<br/>
before Harry Potter -   (I forget the illustrators name, sorry) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452195718">Scott O&#39;Dell also wrote Island of the Blue Dolphins and Zia (both with <br/>
strong female lead characters). Zia is the sequel to Island of the Blue <br/>
Dolphins.  He also wrote the Black Pearl ( I don&#39;t know if the lead <br/>
character was female, though).<br/>
