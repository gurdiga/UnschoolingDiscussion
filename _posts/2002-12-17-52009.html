<br/>
That&#39;s too funny. I was watching a Will and Grace a couple of weeks ago and <br/>
Will turned the bedroom into a gift wrapping center. Him and his gay guy <br/>
friend (don&#39;t know his name) were exchanging gifts in the morning. One <br/>
wrapped the milk and the other wrapped the cereal. They wer so happy with <br/>
themselves!!!<br/>

I loved (LOVED) opening gifts as a kid.  One thing my mom did every Christmas <br/>
was to buy us new school supplies, and wrap them.  So after Christmas I had a <br/>
new box of crayons, new erasers, pencils, glue, maybe a ruler, maybe <br/>
notebooks...<br/>
