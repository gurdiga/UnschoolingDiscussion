<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730159744">Hafhida, Thanks, I appreciate your comments.  I, too , was very shy as a <br/>
child.  It was difficult for me, too, to relax, and be open and friendly when <br/>
meeting new people.  My older brother was always more the extrovert type, and <br/>
I always found myself wishing I could be make myself more outgoing like that. <br/>
 I did become more outgoing as I grew up, and could take initiative in <br/>
conversations, etc... and ended up marrying an extremely extroverted guy!  I <br/>
guess we balance each other out!  When I was a teacher, I often would have to <br/>
speak before groups, and even presented a workshop for about 200 people.  <br/>
Wow!  I came a long way, baby! :)                           Karen</div>
