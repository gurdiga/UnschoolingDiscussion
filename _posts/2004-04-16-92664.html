Breathe.<br/>
<br/>
Then listen.<br/>
We&#39;ve been where you are and we&#39;ve walked your path.  We&#39;re trying to show <br/>
you how what we *thought* was essential, really turned out not to be.<br/>
Untwist the knickers and read.<br/>
Then read it again.<br/>
and Breathe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457817933"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;e growing<br/>
&gt;sexist pattern of girl plays with pinky barbies and<br/>
&gt;boy plays with guns.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The GROWING sexist pattern!?<br/>
&gt;The waning sexist pattern.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, he did play with Barbies.<br/>
and he likes guns too.<br/>
So, is maybe he should be bi-gendered? (grin)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-=-Instead of buying him toy guns, why not tell him he<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t have to be like the other boys, that being a<br/>
&gt;person is about being an individual, not bellonging to<br/>
&gt;a group.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Those are the only two choices?<br/>
&gt;People can do both.<br/>
&gt;Maybe he had friends who didn&#39;t play with guns and he was &quot;the first on his<br/>
&gt;block&quot; to ask for one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually he did happen to be the first person on the block to get a gun, <br/>
and we got one for him because he wanted one and we had just bought enough <br/>
land to fire it safely without bothering the neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
...And this kid is so much NOT like a &#39;stereotypical&#39; boy that I had to <br/>
laugh when you said maybe he could be an individual.  For gosh sakes he&#39;s <br/>
got lovely long blond hair down to his waist and he cries at sad movies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-=-&gt; He&#39;s also interested in computers, video games,<br/>
&gt; &gt; blacksmithing -<br/>
&gt; &gt; specifically forging, welding, paper art, flowers,<br/>
&gt; &gt; home decoration (no<br/>
&gt; &gt; kidding) and his long-distance girlfriend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-He&#39;s not into make up, hair, dresses, high heels...<br/>
&gt;Why is that?-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you think it&#39;s because his mother didn&#39;t buy him enough toy high heels and<br/>
&gt;makeup?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, mostly it&#39;s because he&#39;s been through that phase already.  He had <br/>
my high heels to stomp around in and wore nail polish quite a lot but liked <br/>
capes more than dresses.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe dear Leonore, you should read a little more before being quite so <br/>
sure of yourself.<br/>
No offense, but you&#39;ve really stuck your foot in it something fierce.<br/>
