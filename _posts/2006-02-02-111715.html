<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237496480">Happy Year of the Dog! Unlike our New Year&#39;s eve celebration, the <br/>
Lunar New Year (or Chinese New Year) is celebrated for 15 days. <br/>
Sunday (Jan 29) was the first day, and Feb 12 is the last day of the <br/>
celebration.<br/>
<br/>
If you happen to be near the Annapolis/Severna Park area of <br/>
Maryland, you might be interested in the free &quot;week of workshops&quot; <br/>
offered by the Jing Ying Institute as part of the new year <br/>
celebration. They run from Feb 6 to Feb 11.<br/>
<br/>
Details and registration are at <br/>
