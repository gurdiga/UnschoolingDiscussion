<div id="ygrps-yiv-280612240">I agree that if what you are eating bothers you, you shouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
For all of my meat-eating years, however, I preferred not to use or hear<br/>
distasteful words about my meal.  I think a whole lot of people eat meat<br/>
and don&#39;t want to think that it was once a living, breathing animal.<br/>
One of the vegetarian books I&#39;ve read encouraged a change of language to<br/>
call &quot;meat&quot; by it&#39;s animal name, chickens, fishes, cows, pigs, etc.<br/>
because the author felt that language was one of the ways we have made<br/>
carcass eating more appealing.<br/>
<br/>
And now, vegetarian myself this last year, I understand that my<br/>
meat-eating dd does not want to be offered a piece of some animal&#39;s<br/>
&quot;dead body&quot; for dinner or a piece of cow or pig.  She&#39;s quite adamant<br/>
about that.  We all know that doesn&#39;t change what is on the plate.  But<br/>
I think she has the &quot;right&quot; to call a Whopper a Whopper instead of a<br/>
piece of dead cow.  And that I should respect her feelings and call it a<br/>
Whopper, as well.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m on this subject,  Easter morning we went outside and found the<br/>
neighbor cooking a pig, a whole pig, in their front yard.  I was<br/>
fascinated by the kids&#39; response.  I&#39;ve long thought that if kids were<br/>
introduced to meat in such a way, the body of an animal they could<br/>
recognize, they would all be vegetarian.  So after they showed it to me,<br/>
I asked if they were going to eat it.  They all said yes, even the<br/>
youngest, although she added, &quot;But I&#39;m not going to eat it&#39;s butt!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that we all have different sensibilities.  I thought<br/>
of asking the kids, What about Wilbur? What about Babe?  Would you eat<br/>
them?  I managed to restrain myself.<br/>

names were Anglo-Saxon because the peasants took care of them and used those<br/>
names. The Norman French nobles just dealt with the cooked animals so used<br/>
the Norman French words for the meat (which I assume *also* applied to the<br/>
animals back in France.) Well, I assume Sandra will help me out here if I&#39;ve<br/>
boggled it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that people are any less eager to each chicken and fish than<br/>
they are beef and bacon.<br/>
<br/>
But as a deliberate switch in thinking, if that&#39;s someone&#39;s goal, then it&#39;s<br/>
probably helpful. And along that line of thinking, perhaps just changing<br/>
from saying teaching to learning won&#39;t help much unless someone is changing<br/>
consciously.<br/>

The Normans recognized those words as animal names.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope the author didn&#39;t think that was someone&#39;s conscious decision, to <br/>
disguise the Anglo-Saxon / Old English names for the animals just to thwart <br/>
vegetarianism.  Vegetarianism wasn&#39;t a big thing (if it WAS a thing at all) <br/>
in the 11th century when that came about.<br/>

I agree with her.<br/>
Moms should respect their kids&#39; feelings, and if a hot dog isn&#39;t really a dog <br/>
but a kid wants one, there&#39;s no advantage to naming off the ingredients in <br/>
World&#39;s Cheapest Hot Dogs.   The parent could go get a fully organic <br/>
all-beef, no-by-product, fine-ground sausage instead of whatever&#39;s on sale at <br/>
the grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
I think in some cases the stress and shame and pressure some people put on <br/>
others about their choices has GOT to be worse for them than the effect of <br/>
&quot;bad&quot; food eaten in peace.  <br/>
<br/>
And here is the story of my friend Hunter, which has nothing to do with diet.<br/>
<br/>
Hunter worked hard in school.  He was a non-nonsense guy, who went to Goddard <br/>
HS in Roswell.  He always did exactly what his mother said.  He went to <br/>
college and didn&#39;t goof around with the rest of us, he studied hard and <br/>
eschewed &quot;fun.&quot;  He never had girlfriends (because he was really boring and <br/>
uptight, but still...).  He went to law school, and got good grades and a job <br/>
practicing law in a big city in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
AND when he was a lawyer with a job, he got a date.  And crossing the street <br/>
with his date, he was hit and killed by car.  (She wasn&#39;t hit.)<br/>
<br/>
So when someone gets totally focussed on the potential evil of the moment, or <br/>
the importance of one little class or timeframe, or the virtue of hard work, <br/>
or the evils of slacking, I think of Hunter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588519674">Last week,  I noticed my two oldest, Katy 10 and Abby 7,  engrossed in<br/>
something at a neighbors garage up the street.  A whole gaggle of the<br/>
neighborhood children seemed enthralled by something.  We don&#39;t know those<br/>
neighbors well,   but it seemed ok by sheer numbers......figured I&#39;d inquire<br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out the neighbors had a turkey (which is also called turkey after it&#39;s<br/>
cooked,  so there&#39;s an example that doesn&#39;t fit the general rule ;-) )  They<br/>
had shot it (I suppose at a turkey shoot).  I didn&#39;t even have to ask.  Abby<br/>
tells me when they got home:  &quot;Mom,  they had a dead turkey and they said<br/>
they were cleaning it and going to eat it!&quot;  Then she remarked that she<br/>
found watching this and thinking about it to be &quot;totally disgusting&quot;  She<br/>
said she missed the plucking, but saw the cut off head,  watched it being<br/>
skinned, etc.  Katy also said later that it was disgusting to her, too.  She<br/>
toys with the vegetarian idea lately,  but this didn&#39;t seem to push her one<br/>
way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
It led to much lively discussion about where our food comes from and how it<br/>
is processed.  I told her that our relatively new neighbor had raised<br/>
chickens at her previous home and that their grandmother (my mom) had LOTS<br/>
of chickens as a child.  We also talked about visiting the Turkey farm near<br/>
us.....though they said they&#39;d have to think about it after this experience!<br/>
Anyhow,  a few days before that Abby had asked about where bubble gum comes<br/>
from and how it&#39;s made.  During our library trek we had found a good book on<br/>
that PLUS one on peanut butter and chocolate and their origins and<br/>
production.  AND there was a book we borrowed called (something like)<br/>
Disgusting things people eat ..throughout the world and throughout history.<br/>
So we talked abouth the relativity of being disgusted, etc.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a small glimpse of our recent unschooling life.<br/>

it resembled. Well, anyway, here&#39;s the incredibly convoluted history of how<br/>
turkeys came to be called turkeys from the Straight Dope.<br/>
<br/>
(And if you&#39;ve never been to the Straight Dope website, it&#39;s chock full of<br/>
fascinatingly deep research into things that are too common (and sometimes<br/>
too unmentionable ;-) to spark questions until someone asks and you realize<br/>
you should have wondered about it all along. There are books too, which are<br/>
collections of newspaper columns.)<br/>

<br/>
Dear Straight Dope:<br/>
<br/>
With the recent earthquake in Turkey, I started to think about the fact that<br/>
there&#39;s a bird and a country named the same thing. How did each get its<br/>
name? And are there any other countries named the same as animals or food?<br/>
Is there a place named Chicken? --Aron Siegel<br/>
<br/>
SDSTAFF bibliophage replies:<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s all I know for sure: Despite several crackpot theories to the<br/>
contrary, the bird was named after the country, but in a very roundabout way<br/>
so that the details are uncertain. Oh, one other thing I know for sure: No<br/>
European should ever have been allowed to name any New World species. The<br/>
Aztecs, who kept domesticated turkeys for hundreds of years before the<br/>
Europeans arrived, had a perfectly good word for the bird in their Nahuatl<br/>
language: xuehxolotl, which, of course, is pronounced. Don&#39;t ask me how it&#39;s<br/>
pronounced, but I&#39;m sure it can be done. If the Europeans had been smart<br/>
enough to stick with the original name, there would have been no need for me<br/>
to write this Staff Report, and on Thanksgiving we&#39;d sit down to &quot;xuehxolotl<br/>
with all the trimmings.&quot;  Oh, the things that might have been.<br/>
<br/>
First let&#39;s talk about the country. Turkey was named for the Turks, believe<br/>
it or not. Turk can mean either &quot;a citizen of the modern state of Turkey&quot; or<br/>
more broadly, &quot;an individual of the Turkic-speaking people.&quot; The many Turkic<br/>
languages are spoken not only in Turkey but also in a large area of central<br/>
Asia and in northern Siberia. The real question is the origin of the name<br/>
Turk. The word is essentially the same in many languages, including English,<br/>
Turkish, Arabic, and Persian (Farsi). It probably comes from some Turkish<br/>
root, but there&#39;s no consensus on which one. It may be one root meaning<br/>
&quot;strong&quot; or &quot;vigorous&quot; (according to the American Heritage Dictionary) or it<br/>
may be another meaning &quot;the people&quot; (according to the Encyclopedia<br/>
Americana). <br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of other theories of how the country got its name, both<br/>
wrong. The first has it that the country was named after the first leader of<br/>
the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. But like most Turks, Mustafa<br/>
didn&#39;t have any surname at all until 1934, when he chose Atatürk (&quot;Father of<br/>
the Turks&quot;) for himself. He had already given the country its<br/>
western-influenced name Türkiye several years earlier. During the period of<br/>
the empire, the Turkish name for the country had nothing to do with the<br/>
Turks. Rather, it was named for the Osman (Ottoman) dynasty that ruled it.<br/>
Another theory has it that the English named the country after the bird, as<br/>
a taunt. But the country was already called &quot;Turki&quot; or &quot;Turkeye&quot; in English<br/>
by 1275, hundreds of years before the bird was known in the Old World.<br/>
Now I&#39;ll give you the bird. It&#39;s likely the first bird called &quot;turkey&quot; in<br/>
English wasn&#39;t the familiar Thanksgiving fowl (Meleagris gallopavo), but a<br/>
smaller domesticated bird originally from sub-Saharan Africa: (Numida<br/>
meleagris), which we now call the Guinea fowl. This bird was introduced to<br/>
the Mediterranean in ancient times and was known (as a rarity) to the Greeks<br/>
and Romans. It was named after the mythical Meliagrides, who were the<br/>
sisters of Meleager and who were turned to birds after his death. This bird<br/>
seems to have disappeared from Europe and was reintroduced from west Africa<br/>
by Portuguese traders at the end of the fifteenth century. If this bird was<br/>
from Africa, why was it called &quot;turkey&quot; in English? Probably because it was<br/>
introduced to England by so-called &quot;Turkey merchants&quot; who traded with the<br/>
Mediterranean region, including the Ottoman Empire (which then controlled<br/>
the eastern third of that sea). A similar confusion caused another New World<br/>
species, maize or corn (Zea mays), to be called &quot;Turkey wheat&quot; or &quot;Turkey<br/>
corn&quot; in England.<br/>
<br/>
M. gallopavo was introduced to Spain from America sometime between 1498 and<br/>
1526 (but most likely before 1511), and thence to England sometime between<br/>
1520 and 1541 (but probably before 1530). It too was named &quot;turkey&quot; in<br/>
English, perhaps because it was confused with N. meleagris, or because it<br/>
was likewise introduced by Turkey merchants. In citations from the Oxford<br/>
English Dictionary, &quot;turkey&quot; dates from 1541, but it is unclear which<br/>
species is meant. Among unambiguous citations, the N. meleagris meaning of<br/>
&quot;turkey&quot; beats out the M. gallopavo meaning by only three years (1552 vs.<br/>
1555). The OED doesn&#39;t say so but according to Schorger, the word has also<br/>
been used to describe other birds the males of which use tail displays, such<br/>
as the peacock. It is even possible that &quot;peacock&quot; was the original meaning<br/>
of the word in English, but that seems unlikely. For the same reason, the<br/>
capercaillie (a kind of grouse) has sometimes been called a peacock (pavo)<br/>
in Latin as well as &quot;turkey&quot; in English.<br/>
<br/>
There are other theories of how the bird got its name. John Smith (of<br/>
Pocahontas fame) is sometimes given credit for naming the birds he saw in<br/>
Virginia &quot;turkey,&quot; having confused them with the Guinea fowl. But as we have<br/>
already seen, both birds were established in England decades before Smith<br/>
was born in 1580. Another story is that the bird was named after its<br/>
caruncle (wattle), which is sometimes blue, the color of Turkey stone<br/>
(turquoise). Okay, but just because you like &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean you have to grasp at straws trying to explain the name.<br/>
<br/>
Another story is that Christopher Columbus named it tuka, after the Tamil<br/>
word for &quot;peacock.&quot; (He may or may not have been the first European to see a<br/>
real turkey; the credit sometimes goes to Pedro Alonso Niño or Vincente<br/>
Yáñez Pinzón, but it&#39;s less certain that the birds they saw in earlier years<br/>
were really turkeys). It&#39;s hard to imagine why Chris would choose a Tamil<br/>
word when Spanish already had a perfectly suitable word for the domesticated<br/>
peacock, which was not at all uncommon in Europe at that time. But in fact<br/>
he named the bird he saw in Honduras in 1502 not tuka, but rather gallina de<br/>
la tierra (&quot;ground chicken&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
But the peacock theory isn&#39;t entirely fantasy. In the early days, there were<br/>
dozens of different names for the turkey in Spanish, but the one that<br/>
finally caught on was pavo, which originally did refer to the peacock. To<br/>
differentiate it from the turkey, the peacock is now called pavo real in<br/>
Spanish (which could be translated &quot;royal turkey,&quot; and coincidentally this<br/>
is exactly what I call mybrother-in-law). The two birds may not look very<br/>
much alike to us, but the association isn&#39;t completely unfounded:<br/>
<br/>
*    They act the same. The males of both the peafowl and the turkey spread<br/>
their tail feathers in mating displays, though the turkey&#39;s display is much<br/>
less impressive.<br/>
*    They sound the same. Both of them have unpleasant calls, a fact noted<br/>
by the writer Motolinía who visited Mexico in the sixteenth century.<br/>
*    They taste the same according to at least three early reports,<br/>
including that of Columbus.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there is a related species found in Central America, the<br/>
ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata, also called Agriocharis ocellata),<br/>
which resembles a peacock in having eye spots on its tail feathers. It may<br/>
have been this bird that the earliest Spanish explorers saw, or it may have<br/>
been any of several other birds of the region that have been confused with<br/>
the peacock. This confusion is a big part of the uncertainty of exactly when<br/>
M. gallopavo was introduced to Spain.<br/>
<br/>
English is not the only language that incorrectly associates the turkey with<br/>
Turkey. Welsh borrowed the English usage and calls the bird twrki. But it is<br/>
interesting that many other languages incorrectly associate the bird with<br/>
other countries. In many languages (including Turkish and French), the bird<br/>
is called by names indicating it&#39;s from India. This may derive from the<br/>
confusion between the East Indies and West Indies that was rampant in those<br/>
days. In fact, one of the early Spanish names, gallina de las Indias, means<br/>
&quot;hen of the Indies.&quot; But other languages (such as Dutch and Danish) are<br/>
strangely specific in calling the bird by names indicating the bird is from<br/>
the Indian city of Calicut. At that time, Calicut was the most important<br/>
city for the trade between Europe and India. So it would not have been<br/>
unreasonable for Western Europeans to assume that anything exotic came from<br/>
Calicut, or more generally, from India. Incidentally, &quot;calico cloth&quot; is also<br/>
named after Calicut.<br/>
<br/>
In Portuguese, the bird is called peru, despite the fact that the bird was<br/>
not introduced to Peru until after the Spanish conquest. The most reasonable<br/>
explanation for the association is that the bird became popular in Portugal<br/>
shortly after Pizarro conquered Peru in 1532, and the Portuguese made a<br/>
natural assumption. In Brazilian slang, peru can also means &quot;penis,&quot; which<br/>
must make life interesting along the Brazil-Peru border. One word for the<br/>
bird in one of the several dialects of Hindi is also peru or piru, which is<br/>
probably borrowed from Portuguese. That makes sense, since the turkey was<br/>
introduced to India by the Portuguese (sometime before 1612). Another<br/>
suggestion, discounted by Portuguese etymologists, is that Portuguese and<br/>
Hindi both borrowed the word from a Tamil source. Tamil again? It&#39;s hard to<br/>
understand the fascination Tamil holds for the inventors of false<br/>
etymologies. Maybe they figure most of us can&#39;t speak it and so will believe<br/>
almost anything about it. In case you were wondering, in Tamil the bird is<br/>
called by names meaning &quot;sky chicken&quot; or &quot;foreign chicken,&quot; but neither name<br/>
looks anything like tuka or peru.<br/>
<br/>
Lest you think the scientific name of the turkey makes more sense than the<br/>
common ones, it is my duty to inform you that it is perhaps even more messed<br/>
up. Meleagris gallopavo is composed of the names of three different birds,<br/>
none of them the turkey. Meleagris was the ancient Greek name of the Guinea<br/>
fowl (mentioned above). For hundreds of years, European naturalists believed<br/>
the turkey was a kind of Guinea fowl, for reasons that are not entirely<br/>
clear. Gallopavo was one of the early Spanish names for the turkey (often<br/>
spelled gallipavo). Gallo- comes from gallus, the Latin word for the common<br/>
barnyard fowl (chicken), Gallus domesticus. And -pavo comes from Latin word<br/>
for the blue peacock, whose scientific name is Pavo cristatus. The Spanish<br/>
apparently gave it that name because the bird combined several traits of the<br/>
two birds. Some later naturalists took the name too literally and assumed<br/>
the turkey was a hybrid of a peacock and a chicken or of a rooster and a<br/>
peahen. <br/>
<br/>
Other foods that share names with countries? Well, there&#39;s chili or chile<br/>
(as in pepper) but it&#39;s not etymologically related to the name of the<br/>
country Chile. Guinea is an obsolete shortened form of the edible &quot;Guinea<br/>
fowl&quot; (mentioned above). And from the Brazil nut tree (named after the<br/>
country) we get brazils (or Brazil nuts).<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ll accept geographical features smaller than nations, you can make a<br/>
whole meal out of places. You could have a Bologna and Cheddar Sandwich with<br/>
Dijon, and a cup of Java to wash it down. You could even serve it on fine<br/>
China. And since you asked, there is a place called Chicken, Alaska (pop.<br/>
17). There&#39;s also an airport in California called Chicken Strip. No word on<br/>
whether it&#39;s tender, juicy, and golden-brown. I could continue in the same<br/>
silly vein, but that would be beneath the dignity of the Straight Dope. I&#39;m<br/>
not Ghana do it. <br/>
<br/>
Aw, who am I kidding?<br/>
<br/>
Oman, all this talk of food is making me Hungary. Iran over as soon as I<br/>
smelled your cooking. Jamaica nuff for me? Why, yes, I would like some<br/>
coffee. Just one Cuba sugar, though. You&#39;re out of cream? Why don&#39;t you just<br/>
milk Macao to get Samoa? Bring me some booze instead. Lots of it, because I<br/>
really want to Taiwan on. This is what you call food? It&#39;s nothing but<br/>
Greece. Waiter, Czech please!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417709640">In England, people were eating geese and swans for large poultry, and they&#39;re <br/>
kinda nasty.  Bummer the gold was in south America and not north America, <br/>
because while the Spanish explorers were bringing gold back, the English <br/>
didn&#39;t find gold in their colonies, but were bringing trees (for ships&#39; <br/>
masts) and tobacco and wild turkeys (to be domesticated for food).  Then they <br/>
were taking those new masts and huge trees and building ships and taking the <br/>
gold away from the Spanish ships.  It worked out okay (for England, for a <br/>
while).<br/>
