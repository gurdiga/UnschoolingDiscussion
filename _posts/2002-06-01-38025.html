<div id="ygrps-yiv-515923356">My Zach is a world champion arguer, persistence personified, gonna do it my<br/>
way or die trying kind of kid.  I love him truly and deeply but could pinch<br/>
his head off about half the time.  Something that has helped is to get him<br/>
to brainstorm ideas.  Example from yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
I am taking Zach and Adriane to meet their grandparents half-way between our<br/>
homes so they can spend the week with them.  Two older cousins are also<br/>
meeting so 6 people and their luggage will be riding for over 5 hours<br/>
crammed into my parents&#39; car to get back to the Texas panhandle.  Zach<br/>
wanted to take all kinds of stuff with him, baseball bat, raquetball stuff,<br/>
scooter, his own blanket and pillow, etc..  I pointed out about space<br/>
considerations and said he would need to leave stuff behind.  He argued and<br/>
argued, huffed around, I got mad.  Finally, I caught myself and pointing out<br/>
the problem, asked him how he would solve it.  He suggested using the<br/>
suitcase as a limit....after he had packed his clothes, he could fill the<br/>
remaining room with his choice of stuff but could only take what could fit<br/>
in the suitcase.<br/>
<br/>
Made perfect sense to me and worked like a charm.  He was happy...I was<br/>
happy...hopefully, nobody was too crowded on the ride to Granny&#39;s house.<br/>
