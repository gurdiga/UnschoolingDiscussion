<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575856926">Too often I think adults DON&#39;T talk to children about what they&#39;re doing<br/>
or thinking. The children have no idea where those thoughts came<br/>
from---what process was used to get to the end. They don&#39;t see us<br/>
struggle with day-to-day thoughts and ideas. *I* think we need to talk<br/>
more.<br/>
 <br/>
Chatty, chatty me,<br/>

Us introverted folk don&#39;t come by this naturally.  Actually, I can only<br/>
speak for myself...I tend to think things through myself, and not talk<br/>
about it; preferably alone before dc are out of bed in the a.m.<br/>
 I do think it is worth the effort to try to learn some &#39;thinking out<br/>
loud&quot; for the sake of the dc being able to listen in.    Susan</div>
