&lt;&lt; It&#39;s called &quot;Eating for Your Type&quot; I think.  I bet if you did a search on <br/>
 Amazon you could come up with it.  I have seen the book and it says that my <br/>
 blood type should be vegetarian (which is funny, because I&#39;m not a <br/>
 vegetarian, but I really don&#39;t like a lot of meat)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have heard of this, too.  I saw an article on it in a  magazine from the <br/>
Health food store nearby.  Interestingly, I am type O blood, and it said that <br/>
I would be a meat eater, which coincidentally- or not- I am.  It helps me to <br/>
have the higher protein my system needs in light of being intolerant of many <br/>
carbohydrates that raise my blood sugar level.  ~Karen</div>
