<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299566945">I remember a class I took in college called &quot;Psychology of Consciousness&quot;.<br/>
We discussed brain waves- alpha waves,  beta waves....and one other Greek<br/>
letter I can&#39;t think of just now.  Studies showed that during meditation,<br/>
your brain comes to produce alpha waves - a state of deep relaxation and<br/>
high awareness.  Studies of people watching television showed them going<br/>
into a wave zone (beta? - I&#39;ll have to look this up);  this state clearly<br/>
was one of reduced awareness to surroundings.  (Ever tried to ask something<br/>
of a person watching TV in this state? They  appear to ignore you.)  At any<br/>
rate,  this state of consciousness,  with its low level of awareness,  seems<br/>
decidedly unhealthy to stay in for prolonged periods.   OTOH,  reading and<br/>
computer time also at times seem to &#39;take over &#39; to the neglect of other<br/>
physical,  environmental needs.<br/>
<br/>
In regard to video games.....I wonder if studies have been done.  Maybe the<br/>
interaction makes a difference in brain functioning -?-<br/>
<br/>
.  I guess for me the questions boil down to.....how do we teach our<br/>
children/orselves discipline to care for themselves physically,<br/>
emotionally,  etc?  OR....how to we promote their growth and encourage them<br/>
to find a balance?   The media producers and advertisers are majorly<br/>
invested in us/our children spending as much time in front of their<br/>
adverstisements as possible.   Do we simply allow our children to be fed<br/>
this stuff?<br/>

&lt;&lt; The fallacy of using a label such as &quot;deschooling&quot; is that some children<br/>
who<br/>
have never been to school nor have they ever been in an environment that was<br/>
controlling will still sit like mindless little bloob in front of the tube.<br/>

You cannot tell by looking at someone what they are thinking, and they ARE<br/>
thinking.  They&#39;re either thinking of what they&#39;re looking at and hearing,<br/>
or<br/>
they&#39;re thinking of something else and using &quot;I&#39;m watching a show&quot; as a<br/>
privacy screen so they can think.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know any &quot;mindless little bloobs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps those who have children who are mindless little bloobs should have<br/>
their own list, because I don&#39;t like the phrase or the lack of respect<br/>
behind<br/>
it, and I think it&#39;s a strawman created for the purposes of this discussion.<br/>
