Mmmmm.... I really like that Marjorie!  I think I&#39;ll hang onto that one.<br/>

About the Ocarina discussion...<br/>
I bought a really great little soprano ocarina from songbird ocarinas (online). They make raku ocarinas that are very high quality, a little more money too, but worth it.<br/>
If you buy an ocarina from them, it comes with a couple fingering/song books including the zelda songs. If you get a sweet potato ocarina (like Sandra mentioned) you can play all the Zelda songs, which is a great way to connect music for those gamers. :)<br/>

Ooooohh,  Ren I&#39;m going to look into this,  thanks.<br/>
<br/>
The kids were so into Zelda on the way to the conference and at the conference.   I got to listen to the music in the van.  I liked it.  :)  They would really get a kick out of hearing this.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have that to learn and some of the Shire/hobbit music from Lord of the Rings.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

The ocarina I got Moly (Jack too he says &lt;g&gt;) has a Zelda emblem (for lack of <br/>
a better word) on it. A triangle with another triangle upside down inside it. <br/>
The song book they got with it has some Zelda tunes in it and I am going to <br/>
order the songbook with all the Zelda tunes for them. I got mine at the KC Ren <br/>
Fest and the book has a link to their web site. Very pretty selection and you <br/>
can create your own. The site is Ocarinaworld.com The family is based out of <br/>
Ithaca, NY.<br/>

Jonathan&#39;s birthday is in December, now I know what to get him.  He has a<br/>
very strong genetic bent for music so I&#39;m interested to see how long it<br/>
takes him to pick out the Zelda songs.  I&#39;ll show him the fingering charts<br/>
but I&#39;m guessing he&#39;ll opt to figure them out on his own.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen &quot;Zelda-like&quot; ocarinas but getting one with the actual triangles<br/>
and the right color is too cool.  Thanks for the link.<br/>
