&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, JJ, are you also having hot flashes? (and I don&#39;t mean of <br/>
&gt; insight!) &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; but five-year-olds keep eating past that point.   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; School?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mercedes<br/>
&gt; who has hot flashes and continues eating when full. . . .<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       Oh good, I wondered if it was just me! Yeah, hot flashes for sure, and <br/>
I&#39;ve lost both my own folks now too. <br/>
<br/>
       So the part where Harry conjures up the Patronis just breaks me up, <br/>
the idea that we give life to and protect our children and then through them, <br/>
continue to touch others and affect the world for good (or for some <br/>
unfortunately, evil) -- I sat there with tears streaming down my face while my 14-year-old <br/>
patted me on the leg and said there, there, which just made me cry harder. I <br/>
got this flash of HER children someday doing that to her, and it was wonderful <br/>
and powerful and poignant all at the same time, and I wallowed in it. It was <br/>
a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       But I must admit that foremost in my mind this spring is what I&#39;m <br/>
finding about  all kinds of stuff happens to women&#39;s bodies as we age, that no <br/>
care or conditioning or positive thinking can halt, and no amount of saying no <br/>
can stop, and I -- DON&quot;T  --- LIKE  ---  IT!! &lt;g&gt;   JJ<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just loved this. I recently sobbed my way through a high school sign language concert as <br/>
I watched these fresh faced teens performing with passion - conscious of the passage of <br/>
time and the way our roles change from new adult to young married woman to mother...<br/>
<br/>
The Harry Potter stories speak to me on that profound level. To make manifest a mother&#39;s <br/>
love and sacrifice as a powerful protective force in the life of her child is something only a <br/>
mother would have dreamt up. I&#39;m grateful to Rowling for that emphasis.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing sappy or sentimental about it. The most real, most powerful force in a child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh. <br/>
<br/>
Nice to start my day with that realization. Might need to post it on the refrigerator.<br/>
