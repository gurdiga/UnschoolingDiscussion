<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203728135">&quot;Math is a boon and learning is always fun if taken in the right<br/>
spirit.&quot;<br/>
Someone left that on my blog.  Anonymous said more than that, and the<br/>
rest was worse.  I absolutely disagree with the assertion that math is a<br/>
boon, or that ANY learning is a boon.  I&#39;m not sure what they meant by<br/>
&quot;the right spirit&quot;, but I can only assume based on the rest of the<br/>
comment that they meant that learning is fun if the student goes into a<br/>
classroom with a positive attitude.<br/>
I found these 2 definitions of the word boon:<br/>
A benefit bestowed, especially one bestowed in response to a request.<br/>
and<br/>
  A general term that refers to a benefit or improvement for investors.<br/>
This can include such things as increased dividends, a stock market<br/>
rally and stock buybacks.<br/>
In either case though, I don&#39;t think math is a boon, or that any kind of<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; is a boon, or that learning should be.<br/>
Learning about math shouldn&#39;t be a benefit for future investors, or<br/>
future employees, learning about math is inevitable if math is all<br/>
around us, defining the universe and the order around us.  I really<br/>
really don&#39;t believe that any learning can be bestowed onto someone in<br/>
response to a request.  Teachers truly believe that they can request a<br/>
student to learn and impart all their teacherly knowledge onto a student<br/>
and that it&#39;s truly a gift of the highest order of gifting, after all,<br/>
we do spend billions of dollars to &quot;gift&quot; upon students, in the form of<br/>
teachers and schools and math textbooks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253620254">I have been hearing my dad say that kind of thing lately about reading. He<br/>
thinks that if Karl could read (the sooner the better seems to be his idea)<br/>
then his education would be set!<br/>
<br/>
I had half a mind to ask how blind people could possibly learn anything<br/>
before learning Braille. How do deaf/blind people figure out anything before<br/>
they can read? Surely someone could be there reading for them and talking<br/>
about all kinds of things! Same for Karl, who is not yet fluent at reading.<br/>
He&#39;s very fluent about lots of other things and he&#39;s learning tons of stuff<br/>
-- all without being able to read yet.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, while watching a Godzilla movie (Tokyo S.O.S.) on Netflix and<br/>
thinking about how bodies work, Karl just now said &quot;if we didn&#39;t have any<br/>
bones, we would be a puddle of skin.&quot; It&#39;s as if he&#39;s always proving to me<br/>
that he&#39;s taking in so much about what&#39;s around him, seamlessly, that<br/>
there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll even be able to record it or keep up with it. Only a<br/>
fraction that he&#39;s doing comes to my notice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420309886">Math could be considered a &quot;boon&quot; of our human brains, like language, but its certainly not bestowed by any human agency. And learning is frequently fun, if the spirit isn&#39;t sucked out of it by too much bestowing. <br/>
<br/>
Probably the ickiest part is the implication that kids who dislike being taught need to change their attitudes. That, along with the idea that any kid can do well in school &quot;if they apply themselves&quot; are two of the most damaging preconceptions one can have wrt learning. Bleh. <br/>
