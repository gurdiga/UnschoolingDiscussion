<div id="ygrps-yiv-559132882">Hello, I homeschool my two children, but really interested in what unschooling is. My son hates the workbooks especially Math. I have not idea what unschooling is any one that can let me know I would really appreciate it. Any books that you can recommend would be great also. When you unschool what do you do at the end of the year where I live you have to do either a portfolio or a test.Thanks in advance. Andrea</div>

 </span></blockquote>Well, unschooling is in the eye of the beholder.   Some will tell you there <br/>
are rules; others will say do what works for you and yours.  We fall in that <br/>
second category.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Fla and have to show a daily log/journal of activites and a <br/>
portfolio that shows &quot;appropriate progress.&quot;  So I keep the juornal and stick <br/>
whatever product is produced in the portfolio and end up with a chrono pile <br/>
of stuff we did.  It&#39;s not tooooo neat because some of it is photos and some <br/>
is art work and some is math work and some is from the Internet.  We do what <br/>
works and what is fun and what comes up and (this is the not-so-unschooling <br/>
part) we do what mom thinks we should be doing some time this year.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

&gt; &gt; it. Any books that you can recommend would be great also.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My favorite unschooling book for all ages is _The Unschooling <br/>
Handbook_ by Mary Griffith.  She also wrote _The Homeschooling <br/>
Handbook_ which has a section detailing different styles of <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what unschooling is - this is something I wrote awhile back <br/>
to answer just that question.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about contining to do the things with your children<br/>
that you have done since birth.  Read to them, play with them, sing<br/>
with them, go on walks, visit the zoo and hands on museums where they<br/>
can experience things they can&#39;t at home.  Let them help you cook,<br/>
shop, clean, etc.  Continue to live your lives the way you always have<br/>
without the interruption of school.  Unschooling isn&#39;t about trying to<br/>
teach your children something - it&#39;s about helping them to learn.  You<br/>
read to them, and then one day they begin to read on their own.  They<br/>
begin to be able to seek out information on their own.  They ask a lot<br/>
of questions about space so you help them search the net, look at the<br/>
NASA sights, get out the telescope.  They ask about dinosaurs so you<br/>
go to the library and help them find the section with the dinosaur<br/>
books.  You help them write letters to Grandma and when she writes<br/>
back you help them to read them. As they get older, we expect it to<br/>
change, but it really doesn&#39;t.  They ask more complicated questions,<br/>
but you still help them find the answers.  You might need more help<br/>
finding answers, even a mentor, or a teacher here and there.  You talk<br/>
about the future and what paths their lives might take.  Sometimes<br/>
that means that they&#39;ll tackle some formal training or education.  You<br/>
help them investigate this.  What&#39;s the ACT or SAT?  How do you<br/>
prepare?  What do I have to do to get into this college or technical<br/>
school. How do I start my own business?   How do I become a nurse? <br/>
How do I know if I want to become a nurse ( excellent opportunity for<br/>
a volunteer project).  You encourage and facilitate.  You provide<br/>
tools, books, tapes, software, but most of all support.  You<br/>
continually remind yourself that this will work and seek out other<br/>
unschoolers for support.  You trust, trust, and trust some more that<br/>
your child was born with all the curiousity they need to lead them<br/>
through their education.  Most of all you enjoy the path you&#39;ve<br/>
chosen. Celebrate everyday that you don&#39;t have to follow the crowd.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My favorite unschooling book is by Grace Llewellyn.  &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;.  It was wonderful.  I wished I had been unschooled.<br/>
Try the unschooling web site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a>  They have a books section.  Just start reading everything you can find.<br/>
