There is a great group for parents who homeschool & have AS kids.  Yahoo<br/>
ASLearning at home.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ASLearningAtHome@...">ASLearningAtHome@...</a> .  They are very useful for<br/>
AS related stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858162031">when I read about Asperger&#39;s I have to state again that testing for Lyme<br/>
disease is very important. It is one of the misdiagnosed conditions that is<br/>
attributed to Lyme.<br/>
www.IgeneX.org for info and correct testing for Lyme.<br/>
for me this is a matter of morality, to offer this information.<br/>
MS, Lupus, Autism, ALS, Alzheimer&#39;s, CFS, ADD, BiPolar, panic and<br/>
agoraphobia, arthritis, early onset Parkinson&#39;s. all highly suspect for<br/>
borrelia infection.</div>
