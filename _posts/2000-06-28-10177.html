<p>Could you give me an example please?&nbsp; I was after all asking, what

<p>i know tensions have been high on this list lately and i was not being

who
<br>asked about unschooling. hope i didn&#39;t offend.

<br>&gt; &lt;&lt; unschooling does not mean letting kids do whatever they
want. it means
<br>&gt;&nbsp; following their lead. eventually it all falls into place. &gt;&gt;

<p>--
<br>&quot;Let us seek to have the mind that was in Christ. Like Him, let us
be gentle, and kind, and encouraging ... above all, let us tell men continually
that they must not judge of Christ by Christians. Let us assure them that
there is far more in that gracious Master than there is in the best of
His servants.&quot;
