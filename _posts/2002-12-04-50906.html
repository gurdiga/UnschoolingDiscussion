Maybe you can look forward to the day, some time in the future, when the<br/>
early rising kids will be able to feed the early rising cats?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067208719">You could try putting the kids&#39; cereal in covered bowls and putting the milk <br/>
in small pitchers (measuring cup?) and they could help themselves in the am. <br/>
  The same could be done with the cats&#39; food (if it&#39;s dry) and water, the <br/>
kids could feed the cats.<br/>

biological clock, staying up really late and sleeping in.  &lt;g&gt;  Mine was<br/>
still up at 3:15 this morning when I got up for a pee.  It&#39;s around 11:30<br/>
now, and I don&#39;t expect to see him very soon.<br/>
