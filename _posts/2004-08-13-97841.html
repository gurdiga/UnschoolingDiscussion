<div id="ygrps-yiv-352908003">I&#39;m considering unschooling after this year, however, even in our <br/>
after school activities I find it very trying for me to just let my <br/>
daughter decide what she&#39;s going to do. I love the idea, however, <br/>
maybe I&#39;m missing something. If she starts something I would like for <br/>
her to finish the project - especially if it was her idea to do in <br/>
the first place. Should I make her finish it and attempt to make it <br/>
more interesting? or just let her move on and maybe she&#39;ll come back <br/>
to it? I&#39;m finding this to be very challenging and don&#39;t want to <br/>
become worse over time in giving her her space to see and learn <br/>
things on her own. <br/>
Any specific suggestions? Also, any one unschooling in the Tampa, <br/>
Florida area?<br/>

The longer you take to start unschooling, the longer you will be deschooling<br/>
before the joy and fun and exploration can really start up.<br/>
<br/>
The most likely result of forcing someone unwilling to finish what they<br/>
start is that they will stop being willing to start things. The most likely<br/>
result of forcing someone to stay in an activity after they want to stop is<br/>
that they will stop wanting to join activities.<br/>
<br/>
Space includes the freedom to say, &quot;This is wrong for me after all&quot; and<br/>
stop. If she goes back later, great. If not, great. <br/>
<br/>
Schooling is full of desperate techniques to falsely &quot;make&quot; subjects (and<br/>
drills) that are irrelevant *seem* interesting because they are part of the<br/>
mandatory curriculum. If interests come first, even the motivation to do the<br/>
grunt portion as well as the cool parts, will be there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706646468">People get really wound up about finishing things when it comes to kids.<br/>
Like if they don&#39; t make them finish things now, then they will never finish<br/>
anything in their entire lives.  Do you ever start something that you don&#39;t<br/>
finish?  A book that just isn&#39;t good?  a knitting project that you lose<br/>
interest in?  I know I do and I&#39;d be pretty pissed if someone told me I have<br/>
to finish my last project before I start a new one.  I have a half finished<br/>
book sitting on the arm of  the couch.  I started a new one today.  I might<br/>
finish the other one at a later date.  I might not.  I have a half finished<br/>
pair of mittens in the knitting basket.  I know I&#39;ll be interested in<br/>
knitting again once the weather cools down and I am home more.  I have two<br/>
pairs of pants cut out and ready to be sewed but I am not in the mood to sew<br/>
right now.  I&#39;ll do it before the kids need pants this fall.  <br/>
I am sure I have other unfinished projects.  Like, I&#39;ll finish cleaning the<br/>
house when the kids move out.  ;0)<br/>

I finally realized that I probably would have read more biographies over <br/>
the years if I allowed myself to *skip* when things got dull.  I&#39;m so <br/>
used to the idea that you have to start at the beginning and plow <br/>
through to the end that I just stopped reading biographies entirely.  <br/>

Adams, and I liked that.)<br/>

Sometimes when I&#39;m trying a new quilting technique, I&#39;ll just make one <br/>
block.  The fact that I didn&#39;t make 36 blocks for a bed quilt doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean I wasted time.    Sometimes I make a few blocks and realize that <br/>
the color combination isn&#39;t working.  Making more blocks just like them <br/>
in order to &quot;finish&quot; wouldn&#39;t be worthwhile.  And it could destroy my <br/>
enthusiasm for quilting.</div>

<br/>
I really like autobiographies, but I often stop once they people are grown.  <br/>
When they&#39;re writing about their childhood and early successes, I&#39;m <br/>
fascinated.  Once they&#39;re grown it&#39;s a big yawn. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

--------------<br/>
<br/>
After 2004?<br/>
<br/>
After May 2005?<br/>
<br/>
What year is this you&#39;re talking about?<br/>
<br/>
If you were driving the wrong way to get to your destination, wouuld you go <br/>
to the next town or intersection and then turn around?   Or would you turn <br/>
around as soon as you knew you were going the wrong way?<br/>
<br/>
Once you start unschooling, will you force yourself to finish it, whether it <br/>
seems fun or good or not?<br/>
<br/>
If you start eating something and it doesn&#39;t taste at all good, do you finish <br/>
it anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Books?<br/>
Movies?<br/>
<br/>
Someone I know felt QUITE progressive and open-minded because when she <br/>
started homeschooling she told her son that he could read any book he wanted to, <br/>
with the sole proviso that he had to finish every book he started.    <br/>
<br/>
It was one of the worst ideas and most wrong-headed ideas I had ever heard.  <br/>
It would keep him from starting any books, or it would make him a faker and a <br/>
liar.<br/>
<br/>
I taught Jr. High English.  I remember being in English classes all through <br/>
school.   When children are &quot;made&quot; to finish a book, many of them lie and <br/>
cheat, either skimming or making things up, reading Cliff&#39;s Notes, asking their <br/>
friends, watching a movie instead...   They&#39;re not reading books the way books <br/>
can and should be read.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should decide by the moment in your life what to do.  Live and be <br/>
in the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668146525">You&#39;d probably like Clinton&#39;s autobiography then. Reviewers who <br/>
misunderstood or disliked his approach were criticizing him for spending <br/>
so much time on his formative years and then cramming 5 different major <br/>
events that occurred while he was president onto one page. He supposedly <br/>
did that on purpose so that readers would get a sense of how much <br/>
pressure there is and how quickly things move when you are president.<br/>
<br/>
I thought that was pretty clever of him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s comparatively easy to train someone to finish everything they begin.<br/>
The training won&#39;t necessarily stick and it may have bad side effects (not<br/>
wanting to start anything, anger at being made to do what they don&#39;t want to<br/>
do, wanting to be away from the one who is controling them, guilt over all<br/>
the projects they &quot;need&quot; to get back to one day). But the techniques are<br/>
pretty easy to master: just stuff down your feelings and keep plugging.<br/>
<br/>
But a more useful skill for a lifetime is knowing when to abandon something<br/>
that is taking more from you than it will give in return.<br/>

<br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s book, _Punished by Rewards_, relates to this idea.  He <br/>
talks about the example of kids that were given incentives to keep <br/>
painting.   Those kids did more painting for awhile, but ended up liking <br/>
it less than kids who only painted when they wanted to.  So giving a <br/>
bribe or pressure to finish a job can undermine a kid&#39;s built-in <br/>
interest in a topic.  (Also called &quot;intrinsic motivation.)<br/>
