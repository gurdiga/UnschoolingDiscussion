  I have a 7 year old boy and a 14 year old girl who hold grudges because of parenting. They both are very sensitive to voice and underlying feelings and keep me checking the respect I am dishing out in my parenting. They are very good respect thermometers for me. If the grudges or moody anger begins usually I have delivered something unkind or out of line. They are also the most loving and caring about me. They do it with passion.<br/>

I wonder why?<br/>

I&#39;ve heard that if a person is &#39;obsessive&#39; about emotions (ie, a grudge <br/>
endures out of proportion to the event) the person may be dealing with <br/>
depression.  Also, folks might want to be aware that kid/teen-depression is <br/>
usually significantly different than adult depression and may not &#39;seem&#39; <br/>
like what we think depression is.<br/>
Good stuff to consider, anyway.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen this in other aspects of life, with men too.  <br/>
<br/>
It might be that men&#39;s social tools are still physical, while women&#39;s tend to <br/>
be interpersonal/social tools.<br/>
<br/>
If a guy is pissed at another guy, he decides whether he can kick his ass, <br/>
and then whether it&#39;s worth doing.  Usually they decide it&#39;s not worth it.  But <br/>
if the other guy just KNOWS his ass is kickable, he usually acts better <br/>
afterward.  (I&#39;m not saying this is great, I&#39;ve just seen it unfold.)<br/>
<br/>
Then the guys are fine again and they shake hands and go on, though something <br/>
DID happen, in an imperceptible kind of plane that women don&#39;t usually know <br/>
anything about.<br/>
<br/>
With women, in our culture, we can&#39;t shun in the same way we might if the <br/>
troublemaker just wasn&#39;t invited to go dig roots the next day.  We get the <br/>
instinctive urge but don&#39;t have the means to express it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a rough estimate and it might be totally wrong, but it&#39;s my best model <br/>
at the moment.<br/>

<br/>
I was just talking to Jason about this, he said that almost always guys deal with other guys in one of two ways...<br/>
<br/>
Some problems require a beer to get solved. <br/>
<br/>
Others require an ass kicking and then a beer.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him if they talk while drinking the beer, he said yah, but rarly about the problem. They both know there is a problem, why discuss it to death. Apparently the same goes with the second option too.<br/>
<br/>
I asked his about problems that can&#39;t be fixed with ass kickings and beer. He said only rarely is that the case, but if it can&#39;t be fixed with those, maybe it&#39;s not worth fixing.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure it makes sense to me, but then, I don&#39;t like beer.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
My girls are all fairly even tempered. If they do get upset, they get over<br/>
it quickly. Joseph is more moody than the girls and also quicker to get<br/>
upset with us. Sometimes it seems like it&#39;s over nothing at all, and most of<br/>
these times are between him and his father. We try real hard to take care of<br/>
that and find out exactly what the problem is. It isn&#39;t always easy to do. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t say he holds grudges for long periods of time. I mean it&#39;s not like<br/>
an hour goes by and he&#39;s still mad, just more so than the girls. He also<br/>
gets angry quicker too. My husband and I have been really working on this<br/>
and ever so slowly, we have seen some improvement in how things are handled.<br/>
I&#39;m hoping that between what we do and his maturing, it will continue to get<br/>
better as it seems to have already started.<br/>

<br/>
Yup. When things change, it&#39;s always a good thing to consider. My oldest (now <br/>
25) went through a deep depressive episode at 17. <br/>
<br/>
My 11yo though, isn&#39;t doing something really different *for her*, just <br/>
temporarily BIGGER. Moodier. Broodier. Makes me sympathetic to her and very <br/>
very glad that *I* don&#39;t ever have to go through puberty again as long as I <br/>
live. :) <br/>
