<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299473372">Hi, <br/>
   My name is Govinda and I was wondering if there are any message <br/>
boards or sites run by middle school or teenage unschooling kids,  <br/>
I&#39;m specifically looking for a place where kids are sharing their <br/>
goals,learning activities and what they do with their time.  I have a <br/>
boy who will be 13 in January.  We live up in the foothills of the <br/>
Sierra Nevada mountains and there is a limited amount of <br/>
opportunities up here for him.  We are looking for some inspiration <br/>
from some peers around his age group or older teens.<br/>
   Nice to be here.  I haven&#39;t had the time to read many messages <br/>
yet, but look forward to the association.<br/>
   By the way, is there anyone involved in Eastern Phylosophies <br/>
(Krsna Consciousness,Vegetarianism)?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434975217">I would be interested in finding some good groups for my daughter as <br/>
well.  I will do a search on yahoo and see what I come up with. If I <br/>
don&#39;t find anything that fits the bill, I may create a group.  I&#39;ll <br/>
post my findings here.<br/>

conversations between teens and also younger kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246199455">A quick search on Yahoo returned a few groups for home schooled teens, but <br/>
most of them have less than 50 members.  I joined a few to peek in, and they <br/>
were not very active.  I emailed the owner of one group called Homeschool <br/>
Teens.. If they are not interested in maintaining the group, I will take over <br/>
moderation.  Groups have to be adequately promoted and managed to be <br/>
successful.  Again, I will keep folks posted on how this goes<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for all your replys.   My son is pretty shy about writting <br/>
others,  I think is is mostly because he is not a very good speller.  <br/>
I want to encourage him (with out coercion) to communicate with <br/>
others who are unschooling and have some interesting goals <br/>
spearheading them on in their learning.  I was kind of hoping for <br/>
some conversations that go alittle deeper than what movie or game <br/>
stations they are playing.  Is that bad of me?  Anyway lets just see <br/>
what happen.  <br/>
