<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586112540">Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
I have been on this list for quite a while (several months?) and <br/>
this is my first post. The discussions are so great that I really <br/>
appreciate being a part of them, even though I&#39;m just sitting here <br/>
at the computer smiling, laughing, crying, etc. to myself. I rarely <br/>
post on lists because I&#39;m relatively new to unschooling and feel I <br/>
have more to learn than contribute at this point. I find if I wait, <br/>
my views on a topic are usually posted by someone else, in a much <br/>
better way than I had thought of!LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wanted to add that the Certificate of Empowerment was <br/>
great for me as I started unschooling. I was one of those people who <br/>
NEEDED it, and sometimes still do. Although, I don&#39;t have it right <br/>
up on my desk anymore, I know right where it is if I need to pull it <br/>
out and refer to it. I understood the paragraph in question, I <br/>
think, because I was already learning about unschooling. I do see <br/>
how it could be misconstrued by parents wanting to control their <br/>
children more, unfortunately. I really like the way Rue suggested to <br/>
reword it, if you feel like changing it at all, Sandra. <br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my opinion (plus alot more). I guess it&#39;s good I don&#39;t <br/>
post too often, you see how wordy I tend to be. (I just remembered <br/>
how I used to get KISS on my English papers in school all the time. <br/>
I guess I just refuse to be controlled!LOL) Thanks to all who do <br/>
post. Don&#39;t stop, I&#39;m learning and growing thanks to YOU.<br/>
