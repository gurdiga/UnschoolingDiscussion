him be, while I let him know that I was still available (by rubbing his back<br/>

Last night, some unschoolin&#39; teens were in town for the night. Hayden was<br/>
*so* excited that they called him on his phone :D he immediately asked me<br/>
for a ride and made plans to see them. After hanging up, he realized he was<br/>
awaiting two calls on Skype. &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot; was the theme<br/>
song of the evening. He was literally writhing in the pain of this choice.<br/>
He didn&#39;t want to disappoint anyone and he didn&#39;t want to miss ANYthing. He<br/>
cried and cried and wailed &quot;HELP me!!!&quot; I offered gentle suggestions like<br/>
making a pros and cons list, flipping a coin (and changing your choice if<br/>

was so crabby sounding, it felt like &quot;ganging up&quot; on an overwhelmed little<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-256634974">I guess I usually try to ask myself, &quot;How can we have both?&quot; Could he make <br/>
the calls earlier and let his Skype friends know something unexpected came <br/>
up later? Could he have two cakes in different flavors or cupcakes in many <br/>
flavors? Often &quot;having both&quot; means more energy and work from Mom...is that <br/>
the wall he is hitting? To be honest, sometimes that is the wall that Jayn <br/>
comes up against with me. Sometimes I just need a few moments to change my <br/>
gears up to willingness to do more.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my &quot;help&quot; inflames things and what helps most is my silence. I <br/>
never expected that keeping out of Jayn&#39;s thought process would be the best <br/>
thing to do, but sometimes it just is, expecially when otherwise she turns <br/>
on me with anger. My silence seems to allow her to listen to her own <br/>
clamoring thoughts instead of having to direct energy to filtering my voice. <br/>
Even when she has &quot;asked&quot; for help, usually it is just her thinking aloud <br/>
and not wanting my solution. Sometimes asking for help is her way of wanting <br/>
ideas specifically to reject.<br/>
<br/>
Am I trying to help because of my need to be important to her or to rescue <br/>
her from her painful seeming thinking? Or is it because I can see an elegant <br/>
solution that is evidently escaping her?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>BTDT. I like Kelly&#39;s answer, but here&#39;s another: sometimes, if you  <br/>
make the choice for them, it gives enough clarity for them to then  <br/>
breathe and make another decision for themselves. So if you say &quot;I&#39;ll  <br/>
make the chocolate cake,&quot; he can either think &quot;great&quot; or &quot;oh wait, I  <br/>
don&#39;t want chocolate, I want banana.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Quinn was younger, he would often be that way about going  <br/>
places. He liked what he was doing and he liked where we were going.  <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;d say, &quot;ok we&#39;ll stay&quot; and that was enough for him to  <br/>
feel like the pressure of deciding was off and he then he was free to  <br/>
say &quot;no let&#39;s go.&quot; Or not.<br/>
<br/>
At first, I was worried that I sounded too coercive, but a friend of  <br/>
mine who knows Quinn said that she could easily see how too many  <br/>
choices would be overwhelming - Quinn can take in a LOT of data at  <br/>
once. And it was true.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not so much that way anymore at (almost) 15.<br/>

Well, that second one was going to be my recommendation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he was so tired that &quot;pass out&quot; was the best option, but it  <br/>
does seem sad that he missed both.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry it was a rough night.  When he&#39;s chipper and bright, ask him  <br/>
then to help you figure out ways to decide next time.  Maybe...<br/>
<br/>
Magic 8 ball<br/>
<br/>
Open a book (Bible, Shakespeare, a Sinfest collection...) randomly  <br/>
and read something and see if it suggests an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Throw a dart at a map and if the thing it hits is closer  <br/>
alphabetically to one or the other option, go with that (or against  <br/>
that, if the disappointment is apparent).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last night at about 1am Margaux says she&#39;s hungry.  I was already in<br/>
bed but her dad wasn&#39;t and he was willing to make her something, which<br/>
was very sweet because I wasn&#39;t.  My answer to those late night<br/>
requests are that she can go into the kitchen and get whatever she<br/>
wants, but I&#39;m not up for making a meal at 1am after I&#39;ve already gone<br/>
to bed.<br/>
<br/>
She absolutely wouldn&#39;t tell her dad what she wanted to eat.  She kept<br/>
asking what her choices where.  Her dad and I kept rattling off choices<br/>
and she kept saying &quot;no, what else is there, I want to know ALL my<br/>
choices.&quot;.  She wanted a run down on every single food item in the<br/>
house and what could be made from them.  Dad wasn&#39;t willing to make<br/>
that sort of from scratch thing.<br/>
<br/>
She was upset about all of it, got upset with us for not accomadating<br/>
her needs which seemed really unreasonable at 1am in the morning.  So,<br/>
it ended with me saying that clearly she wasn&#39;t all that hungry if<br/>
NOTHING would satisfy that need that she felt for food.  Her dad<br/>
brought her a popcycle, which she ate it and then fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
She seems to like impossible scenarios and making it so there is<br/>
seemingly no solution.  It&#39;s frustrating for everyone, especially her.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;ll learn better coping tools for general<br/>
dissatisfaction which is what seems to spur it on.<br/>
<br/>
When she usually says she&#39;s hungry and she doesn&#39;t know what she wants,<br/>
I run down a list of possibles based on various food qualities,<br/>
like &quot;are you in the mood for sweet, salty, warm, cold, fruity, meaty,<br/>
bready, etc..?&quot;  That usually works because she can get a sense of what<br/>
she is really craving without comitting to a particular food or<br/>
prepared dish.  It is generally someting else bugging her when she<br/>
can&#39;t pin down that, like in the case of last nights hungry/unsatisfied<br/>
dilema.<br/>
<br/>
She likes buffets because she can try it all!  Sometimes it is that she<br/>
really does want it all, she really doesn&#39;t want to choose.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864726081">I was listening to the song &quot;Watershed&quot; by the Indigo Girls and then this post topic came up. <br/>
Up on the watershed<br/>
Standing at the fork in the road<br/>
You can stand there and agonize<br/>
Till your agonys your heaviest load<br/>
Youll never fly as the crow flies<br/>
Get used to a country mile<br/>
When youre learning to face<br/>
The path at your pace<br/>
Every choice is worth your while<br/>
<br/>
I was humming that to myself the other day while I was waiting for my son to make a choice. It made me think of how lucky we are that we get to make so many choices in our lives. I love what someone said, I think on this list? Sandra maybe? about making each choice to get you moving in the direction that you want to go. But for the other choices, that don&#39;t matter and don&#39;t go anywhere, the last three lines of this song resonate with me.<br/>

extra boys planning to go bowling with us after the park... suddenly Hayden<br/>
realizes his one special friend won&#39;t be able to come bowling with us. He<br/>
just wants to go home. The boys (who&#39;s mothers have left the park) really<br/>
want to bowl; I had a chance to gather the three of them together and<br/>
explain that Hayden changed his mind and if we could all support him in<br/>
making our time at home fun, he just may decide to go bowling afterall.<br/>
Sure enough, after gathering extra Xbox controllers and games, we&#39;re just<br/>
about home and Hayden pipes up &quot;hey, I thought we were going bowling!&quot; The<br/>
other boys laughed, which made Hayden laugh, which led to us really talking<br/>
about what they wanted from their time together -- time together :D No one<br/>
much cared what we did or where, so we continued home and had the most<br/>
social day in months!! :)<br/>
At the peak of his own angst, H sat in the car alone... not in a sulky way<br/>
nor in an angry way... I let him be. When we packed up to join him, he was<br/>
unable to say goodbye to anyone. Once he realized no one was upset about the<br/>
change in plans, nor about his upset, he called out &quot;BYE!!!!&quot; as we drove<br/>
away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880140869"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve encountered this type of situation many times with my daughter <br/>
and I was reading something recently that helped me see it from a <br/>
different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is that everyone likes to be noticed, and known, and really <br/>
truly *seen* by other people, and part of that knowing is paying <br/>
close attention to their likes and dislikes. <br/>
<br/>
In the case of the birthday cake, maybe it would be more fun to <br/>
say &quot;let me surprise you&quot; and make the choice based what you *know* <br/>
he likes. Then when the day comes, he may notice that you&#39;ve deeply <br/>
thought about him, and that feels really good. Maybe that&#39;s the kind <br/>
of help he&#39;s asking for. Relief from the responsibility of choosing. <br/>
<br/>
The after midnight meal situation (from the other post)has happened <br/>
many times in our house, and we&#39;ve finally figured out that I (or my <br/>
husband) will only give maybe 2 or 3 options of food that we know <br/>
they like and we are truly happy to make at that hour. If those are <br/>
rejected, then the kids are free to get something for themselves. <br/>
Trotting out the list of all things possible is too much, and only <br/>
leads to frustration. I try to keep some easy, pre-made and/or no-<br/>
prep stuff on hand because I know from experience that my kids will <br/>
just go without if it&#39;s too much trouble for them to make something.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes making choices seems more like a big burden that involves <br/>
other people and their wants and needs, not just a simple &quot;what do <br/>
*you* want?&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the homeschooling teens coming to town was a really <br/>
big deal, and maybe the Skype friends might be more of a regular <br/>
thing, so if you know that to be true, maybe don&#39;t present it as an <br/>
equal choice. Know that he would probably choose to hang with the <br/>
teens (if that&#39;s true) and help him make that happen. I might have <br/>
helped him call those friends and tell them the truth in a sweet and <br/>
considerate way.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it seems like wide open options like making pro/con lists <br/>
are too much information to consider when you are stressed already, <br/>
or random ones like tossing a coin are unsatisfying because the <br/>
specific concerns, like potentially dissapointing some friends, are <br/>
not being addressed and are only left to chance.<br/>
