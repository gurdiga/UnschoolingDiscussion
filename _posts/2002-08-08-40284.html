<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097618569">Sorry this took so long to get onto the list, I&#39;ve been a bit overwhelmed<br/>
with moving and being without email for two months!! (I have 704 messages<br/>
waiting - mostly from porn sites. It&#39;s taking a long time to read, er, I<br/>
mean, delete them!)&#92;<br/>
Anyway here is the Jewish view:<br/>

an excerpt:<br/>
&quot;The word moshiach means anointed. It is commonly translated as messiah.<br/>
The Moshiach will be a very righteous man from the family of King David with<br/>
a total commitment to the Torah. He will be anointed as king of the Jewish<br/>
people. He will reestablish the dynasty of King David, rebuild the Holy<br/>
Temple in Jerusalem, and gather together all the Jews from throughout the<br/>
world to the land of Israel directing all of them to properly observe all of<br/>
HaShem&#39;s laws. He will reestablish the laws of a Jewish Kingdom, including<br/>
the sacrificial service and other practices. Finally, he will perfect the<br/>
world, leading all humanity to serve HaShem in unity. The entire world will<br/>
realize that HaShem is the only God and they will all worship HaShem<br/>
together. The world will be completely at peace.&quot;<br/>
Another from the same site:<br/>
How Do We Identify The Moshiach?<br/>
When a person comes forth and claims to be the Moshiach, how can we know if<br/>
he is the real thing? Unfortunately, Jewish history has had several false<br/>
claimants to the title of Moshiach. Some of these false messiahs caused<br/>
great turmoil and suffering. Christianity was founded by the followers of<br/>
one such false Moshiach. So we see that it is very important to have clear<br/>
rules to identify the real Moshiach.<br/>
<br/>
There are two stages in the identification of the Moshiach. The first stage<br/>
is when someone first comes and claims to be Moshiach. He must fulfill the<br/>
following conditions:<br/>
<br/>
He must be a father-to-son descendant of King David. Therefore, a Kohein,<br/>
Levi, or a convert (and his children) cannot be Moshiach.<br/>
<br/>
He must be completely immersed in the study of Torah, just like his ancestor<br/>
David.<br/>
<br/>
He must follow the entire Torah, both the Written and the Oral.<br/>
<br/>
He must lead all the Jews back to the Torah, so that they follow all its<br/>
laws.<br/>
<br/>
If a man comes who fulfills all of these conditions, then we assume that he<br/>
is the Moshiach. This is the first stage of the identification of Moshiach.<br/>
The second stage is completed when the presumed Moshiach succeeds in<br/>
rebuilding the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and gathering all the Jewish people<br/>
in the land of Israel. At that point we know that he is certainly Moshiach.<br/>
<br/>
These are the minimum requirements. Until a person succeeds in fulfilling<br/>
all the requirements of the first stage, we are not allowed to accept him as<br/>
Moshiach.<br/>
<br/>
It is also important to know that the Moshiach does not have to perform<br/>
miracles to prove that he is the Moshiach. If he fulfills the requirements<br/>
listed above then he is the Moshiach, even if he never performed a single<br/>
miracle. Nevertheless, the Moshiach will be a great prophet. His level of<br/>
prophecy will be higher than any other prophet except Moses.<br/>
<br/>
What Moshiach Is Not<br/>
There are many false ideas about Moshiach in the world. Many of these ideas<br/>
have been spread by Christianity. It is therefore important to clarify some<br/>
of these points:<br/>
Moshiach will be a normal human being born from human parents. He will not<br/>
be a god, or a son of god.<br/>
<br/>
Moshiach will be mortal. He will not live forever. When he dies he will be<br/>
succeeded by his son, like any normal king.<br/>
<br/>
Moshiach will not atone for our sins. Every person must atone for his own<br/>
sins; no one else can do it for you.<br/>
<br/>
Moshiach will not change the laws of the Torah in any way. If he attempts to<br/>
do so then we know that he is a false messiah.<br/>
<br/>
All of these issues point to a fundamental belief of Judaism. We must<br/>
recognize that the Moshiach is only a person who is a messenger from HaShem.<br/>
He is not our actual redeemer, for redemption only comes from HaShem. The<br/>
Moshiach will be like Moses who took us out of Egypt. It was really HaShem<br/>
who took us out of Egypt, not Moses. That is one reason why we never even<br/>
mention Moses in the entire Haggadah which we read at the Pesach Seder.<br/>
Moses only served as a prophet, conveying the news of redemption to the<br/>
Jewish people and to Pharaoh and the Egyptians. The Moshiach will serve the<br/>
same function. It is important that we always focus on HaShem as our savior,<br/>
and not on any human being. It is especially important that we never pray to<br/>
any human being instead of HaShem. &quot;<br/>

I am a Christian, and I was just wondering why Jesus is denied as the<br/>
Messiah, even though he fulfills every prophecy written regarding the<br/>
Messiah.<br/>
<br/>
I am not writing to be rude to you, I have a deep respect and love for the<br/>
Jewish people, and I know there are those who call themselves Christians,<br/>
who have said and done terrible things in the name of Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking time to read my letter. I hope to hear from you soon.<br/>
<br/>
THE AISH RABBI REPLIES:<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your thoughtful question. For 2,000 years, Jews have rejected<br/>
Christianity and the idea of Jesus as messiah. It is important to understand<br/>
why Jews don&#39;t believe in Jesus. The purpose is not to disparage other<br/>
religions, but rather to clarify the Jewish position. The more data that&#39;s<br/>
available, the better-informed choices people can make about their spiritual<br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
Jews do not accept Jesus as the messiah because:<br/>
<br/>
1) Jesus did not fulfill the messianic prophecies.<br/>
<br/>
2) Jesus did not embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah.<br/>
<br/>
3) Biblical verses &quot;referring&quot; to Jesus are mistranslations.<br/>
<br/>
4) Jewish belief is based on national revelation.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of this answer, we will examine these additional topics:<br/>
<br/>
5) Christianity contradicts Jewish theology<br/>
<br/>
6) Jews and Gentiles<br/>
<br/>
7) Bringing the Messiah<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
1) JESUS DID NOT FULFILL THE MESSIANIC PROPHECIES<br/>
<br/>
What is the Messiah supposed to accomplish? The Bible says that he will:<br/>
<br/>
A. Build the Third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28).<br/>
<br/>
B. Gather all Jews back to the Land of Israel (Isaiah 43:5-6).<br/>
<br/>
C. Usher in an era of world peace, and end all hatred, oppression, suffering<br/>
and disease. As it says: &quot;Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,<br/>
neither shall man learn war anymore.&quot; (Isaiah 2:4)<br/>
<br/>
D. Spread universal knowledge of the God of Israel, which will unite<br/>
humanity as one. As it says: &quot;God will be King over all the world -- on that<br/>
day, God will be One and His Name will be One&quot; (Zechariah 14:9).<br/>
<br/>
The historical fact is that Jesus fulfilled none of these messianic<br/>
prophecies.<br/>
<br/>
Christians counter that Jesus will fulfill these in the Second Coming, but<br/>
Jewish sources show that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies outright,<br/>
and no concept of a second coming exists.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
2) JESUS DID NOT EMBODY THE PERSONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF MESSIAH<br/>
<br/>
A. MESSIAH AS PROPHET<br/>
<br/>
Jesus was not a prophet. Prophecy can only exist in Israel when the land is<br/>
inhabited by a majority of world Jewry. During the time of Ezra (circa 300<br/>
BCE), when the majority of Jews refused to move from Babylon to Israel,<br/>
prophecy ended upon the death of the last prophets -- Haggai, Zechariah and<br/>
Malachi.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus appeared on the scene approximately 350 years after prophecy had<br/>
ended.<br/>
<br/>
B. DESCENDENT OF DAVID<br/>
<br/>
The Messiah must be descended on his father&#39;s side from King David (see<br/>
Genesis 49:10 and Isaiah 11:1). According to the Christian claim that Jesus<br/>
was the product of a virgin birth, he had no father -- and thus could not<br/>
have possibly fulfilled the messianic requirement of being descended on his<br/>
father&#39;s side from King David!<br/>
<br/>
C. TORAH OBSERVANCE<br/>
<br/>
The Messiah will lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance. The Torah<br/>
states that all mitzvot remain binding forever, and anyone coming to change<br/>
the Torah is immediately identified as a false prophet. (Deut. 13:1-4)<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the New Testament, Jesus contradicts the Torah and states that<br/>
its commandments are no longer applicable. (see John 1:45 and 9:16, Acts<br/>
3:22 and 7:37)<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
3) MISTRANSLATED VERSES &quot;REFERRING&quot; TO JESUS<br/>
<br/>
Biblical verses can only be understood by studying the original Hebrew<br/>
text -- which reveals many discrepancies in the Christian translation.<br/>
<br/>
A. VIRGIN BIRTH<br/>
<br/>
The Christian idea of a virgin birth is derived from the verse in Isaiah<br/>
7:14 describing an &quot;alma&quot; as giving birth. The word &quot;alma&quot; has always meant<br/>
a young woman, but Christian theologians came centuries later and translated<br/>
it as &quot;virgin.&quot; This accords Jesus&#39; birth with the first century pagan idea<br/>
of mortals being impregnated by gods.<br/>
<br/>
B. CRUCIFIXION<br/>
<br/>
The verse in Psalms 22:17 reads: &quot;Like a lion, they are at my hands and<br/>
feet.&quot; The Hebrew word ki-ari (like a lion) is grammatically similar to the<br/>
word &quot;gouged.&quot; Thus Christianity reads the verse as a reference to<br/>
crucifixion: &quot;They pierced my hands and feet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
C. SUFFERING SERVANT<br/>
<br/>
Christianity claims that Isaiah chapter 53 refers to Jesus, as the<br/>
suffering servant.<br/>
<br/>
In actuality, Isaiah 53 directly follows the theme of chapter 52, describing<br/>
the exile and redemption of the Jewish people. The prophecies are written in<br/>
the singular form because the Jews (&quot;Israel&quot;) are regarded as one unit. The<br/>
Torah is filled with examples of the Jewish nation referred to with a<br/>
singular pronoun.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, Isaiah&#39;s prophecies of persecution refer in part to the 11th<br/>
century when Jews were tortured and killed by Crusaders who acted in the<br/>
name of Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
From where did these mistranslations stem? St. Gregory, 4th century Bishop<br/>
of Nanianzus, wrote: &quot;A little jargon is all that is necessary to impose on<br/>
the people. The less they comprehend, the more they admire.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
4) JEWISH BELIEF IS BASED SOLELY ON NATIONAL REVELATION<br/>
<br/>
Of the 15,000 religions in human history, only Judaism bases its belief on<br/>
national revelation -- i.e. God speaking to the entire nation. If God is<br/>
going to start a religion, it makes sense He&#39;ll tell everyone, not just one<br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
Judaism, unique among all of the world&#39;s major religions, does not rely on<br/>
&quot;claims of miracles&quot; as the basis for its religion. In fact, the Bible says<br/>
that God sometimes grants the power of &quot;miracles&quot; to charlatans, in order to<br/>
test Jewish loyalty to the Torah (Deut. 13:4).<br/>
<br/>
Maimonides states (Foundations of Torah, ch. 8):<br/>
<br/>
The Jews did not believe in Moses, our teacher, because of the miracles he<br/>
performed. Whenever anyone&#39;s belief is based on seeing miracles, he has<br/>
lingering doubts, because it is possible the miracles were performed through<br/>
magic or sorcery. All of the miracles performed by Moses in the desert were<br/>
because they were necessary, and not as proof of his prophecy.<br/>
<br/>
What then was the basis of [Jewish] belief? The Revelation at Mount Sinai,<br/>
which we saw with our own eyes and heard with our own ears, not dependent on<br/>
the testimony of others... as it says, Face to face, God spoke with you...<br/>
The Torah also states: God did not make this covenant with our fathers, but<br/>
with us -- who are all here alive today.&quot; (Deut. 5:3)<br/>
<br/>
Judaism is not miracles. It is the personal eyewitness experience of every<br/>
man, woman and child, standing at Mount Sinai 3,300 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
5) CHRISTIANITY CONTRADICTS JEWISH THEOLOGY<br/>
<br/>
The following theological points apply primarily to the Roman Catholic<br/>
Church, the largest Christian denomination, and the one most familiar to the<br/>
Western world.<br/>
<br/>
A. GOD AS THREE?<br/>
<br/>
The Catholic idea of Trinity breaks God into three separate beings: The<br/>
Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19).<br/>
<br/>
Contrast this to the Shema, the basis of Jewish belief: &quot;Hear O Israel, the<br/>
Lord our God, the Lord is ONE&quot; (Deut. 6:4). Jews declare the Shema every<br/>
day, while writing it on doorposts (Mezuzah), and binding it to the hand and<br/>
head (Tefillin). This statement of God&#39;s One-ness is the first words a<br/>
Jewish child is taught to say, and the last words uttered before a Jew dies.<br/>
<br/>
In Jewish law, worship of a three-part god is considered idolatry -- one of<br/>
the three cardinal sins that a Jew should rather give up his life than<br/>
transgress. This explains why during the Inquisitions and throughout<br/>
history, Jews gave up their lives rather than convert.<br/>
<br/>
B. MAN AS GOD?<br/>
<br/>
Christians believe that God came down to earth in human form, as Jesus said:<br/>
&quot;I and the Father are one&quot; (John 10:30).<br/>
<br/>
Maimonides devotes most of the &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; to the fundamental<br/>
idea that God is incorporeal, meaning that He assumes no physical form. God<br/>
is Eternal, above time. He is Infinite, beyond space. He cannot be born, and<br/>
cannot die. Saying that God assumes human form makes God small, diminishing<br/>
both His unity and His divinity. As the Torah says: &quot;God is not a mortal&quot;<br/>
(Numbers 23:19).<br/>
<br/>
Judaism says that the Messiah will be born of human parents, and possess<br/>
normal physical attributes like other people. He will not be a demi-god, and<br/>
will not possess supernatural qualities. In fact, an individual is alive in<br/>
every generation with the capacity to step into the role of the Messiah.<br/>
(see Maimonides - Laws of Kings 11:3)<br/>
<br/>
C. INTERMEDIARY FOR PRAYER?<br/>
<br/>
The Catholic belief is that prayer must be directed through an<br/>
intermediary -- i.e. confessing one&#39;s sins to a priest. Jesus himself is an<br/>
intermediary, as Jesus said: &quot;No man cometh unto the Father but by me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In Judaism, prayer is a totally private matter, between each individual and<br/>
God. As the Bible says: &quot;God is near to all who call unto Him&quot; (Psalms<br/>
145:18). Further, the Ten Commandments state: &quot;You shall have no other gods<br/>
BEFORE ME,&quot; meaning that it is forbidden to set up a mediator between God<br/>
and man. (see Maimonides - Laws of Idolatry ch. 1)<br/>
<br/>
D. INVOLVEMENT IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD<br/>
<br/>
Catholic doctrine often treats the physical world as an evil to be avoided.<br/>
Mary, the holiest woman, is portrayed as a virgin. Priests and nuns are<br/>
celibate. And monasteries are in remote, secluded locations.<br/>
<br/>
By contrast, Judaism believes that God created the physical world not to<br/>
frustrate us, but for our pleasure. Jewish spirituality comes through<br/>
grappling with the mundane world in a way that uplifts and elevates.<br/>
Intimacy in the proper context is one of the holiest acts we can perform.<br/>
<br/>
The Talmud says if a person has the opportunity to taste a new fruit and<br/>
refuses to do so, he will have to account for that in the World to Come.<br/>
Jewish rabbinical schools teach how to live amidst the bustle of commercial<br/>
activity. Jews don&#39;t retreat from life, we elevate it.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
6) JEWS AND GENTILES<br/>
<br/>
Judaism does not demand that everyone convert to the religion. The Torah of<br/>
Moses is a truth for all humanity, whether Jewish or not. King Solomon asked<br/>
God to heed the prayers of non-Jews who come to the Holy Temple (Kings I<br/>
8:41-43). The prophet Isaiah refers to the Temple as a &quot;House for all<br/>
nations.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Temple service during Sukkot featured 70 bull offerings, corresponding<br/>
to the 70 nations of the world. The Talmud says that if the Romans would<br/>
have realized how much benefit they were getting from the Temple, they&#39;d<br/>
never have destroyed it.<br/>
<br/>
Jews have never actively sought converts to Judaism because the Torah<br/>
prescribes a righteous path for gentiles to follow, known as the &quot;Seven Laws<br/>
of Noah.&quot; Maimonides explains that any human being who faithfully observes<br/>
these basic moral laws earns a proper place in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
7) BRINGING THE MESSIAH<br/>
<br/>
Maimonides states that the popularity of Christianity (and Islam) is part of<br/>
God&#39;s plan to spread the ideals of Torah throughout the world. This moves<br/>
society closer to a perfected state of morality and toward a greater<br/>
understanding of God. All this is in preparation for the Messianic age.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, the world is in desperate need of Messianic redemption. War and<br/>
pollution threaten our planet; ego and confusion erode family life. To the<br/>
extent we are aware of the problems of society, is the extent we will yearn<br/>
for redemption. As the Talmud says, one of the first questions a Jew is<br/>
asked on Judgment Day is: &quot;Did you yearn for the arrival of the Messiah?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How can we hasten the coming of the Messiah? The best way is to love all<br/>
humanity generously, to keep the mitzvot of the Torah (as best we can), and<br/>
to encourage others to do so as well.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the gloom, the world does seem headed toward redemption. One<br/>
apparent sign is that the Jewish people have returned to the Land of Israel<br/>
and made it bloom again. Additionally, a major movement is afoot of young<br/>
Jews returning to Torah tradition.<br/>
<br/>
The Messiah can come at any moment, and it all depends on our actions. God<br/>
is ready when we are. For as King David says: &quot;Redemption will come today --<br/>
if you hearken to His voice.&quot;<br/>

READER COMMENTS:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: Bob<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for your kind, tactful, and informative response to the nice woman<br/>
who asked, &quot;Why don&#39;t Jews believe in Jesus?&quot; In reaching out to our<br/>
Christian friends (to educate, not convert) it is so important that we do so<br/>
with the lovingkindess that embodies our Jewish nation. Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: &quot;Lasassop@<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you, thank you, thank you for that concise explanation of why Jews do<br/>
not accept Jesus as messiah. I converted to Judaism after being raised in a<br/>
Christian community. When people ask why I converted, I say something simple<br/>
about &quot;beliefs.&quot; But your response brought back so many memories of all the<br/>
questions I had begun to ask myself even in childhood! And eventually the<br/>
answers led me to Judaism. Thanks again for your wonderful letter.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: David<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a Christian who realizes that God exists in ways human beings cannot<br/>
understand. I do not understand much, but try to grow. I do believe that the<br/>
Gospels were written to prove that Jesus was the Messiah, and that the<br/>
Writings were manipulated to prove this. The Jewish way is a better one than<br/>
modern Christianity. Thank you so much for your valuable time. We waste so<br/>
much on myth that we miss the heart and spirit of God.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: Natalie &quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one of the most pragmatic, logical and clear explanations I have<br/>
ever heard to the questions of Jesus. Thank you. I will pass this on to at<br/>
least 20 people who have asked these questions, or to Jews who would not be<br/>
able to respond to these questions.<br/>
