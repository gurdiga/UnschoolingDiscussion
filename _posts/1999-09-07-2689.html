 </span></blockquote>Well, ladies, I love the idea of a camera--we are a camera irresponsible<br/>
family, NEVER have family pictures, no one ever thinks to bring a camera,<br/>
and if they do, we never get them developed.  Relatives are always nagging<br/>
me for pictures and I never have them.  It is one of my serious character<br/>
flaws.<br/>
<br/>
As far as making the hat--well, I&#39;m a pretty skillful seamstress, but I<br/>
think something like that hat was beyond my level.  Now if you suggested<br/>
that dd learn to make the hat.... ;-)  (Actually, she is making a costume<br/>
for the next fair, personally I think the pattern she has picked out is way<br/>
more than she can handle, so I will probably end up doing the bulk of the<br/>
work.)<br/>

I<br/>
certainly found myself wishing that I were independently wealthy when my 14<br/>
yo dd tried on a hat that looked so-oo-oo adorable it brought tears to my<br/>
eyes.  I said &quot;Oh, we must buy that!&quot;  Then asked how much it was.  $110!!!<br/>
But I gotta tell you, if I&#39;d had that kind of money to spend on a hat, I<br/>
would have bought it in a heartbeat.<br/>
