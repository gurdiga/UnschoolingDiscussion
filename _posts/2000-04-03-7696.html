<div id="ygrps-yiv-189271397">Gee, this was going along in a rather adult fashion until now.  The quote<br/>
you used was not addressed to you, it was addressed to the husband of a<br/>
list member.  What you wrote is indeed what you accuse the other person<br/>
of--flaming.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if you hadn&#39;t been looking for it to be addressed to you or weren&#39;t<br/>
insecure in your beliefs, this wouldn&#39;t have offended you.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t breastfeed all of the kidlets for which I have valid medical<br/>
reasons.  But I don&#39;t get my bloomers in a twist because someone states<br/>
opinions using generalizations about folks who don&#39;t/didn&#39;t breastfeed. <br/>
Perhaps the quote &quot;Get over yourself and your own opinions&#39; should be<br/>
applied closer to home.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, who is really tired of folks who go looking for arguments.<br/>

&gt; OK - this is what I was talking about.  Tracy (a LLL leader, and a firm <br/>
