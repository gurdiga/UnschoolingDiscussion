<div id="ygrps-yiv-810709463">Our favorite Math games:<br/>
Quiddler (this is a word building card game but each letter is worth certain points and you have to add and subtract depending on what you use and don&#39;t use)<br/>
<br/>
S&#39;Math (it&#39;s a math equation game set up like Scrabble)<br/>
<br/>
Dominoes (I had NO idea how many math games this takes care of!)<br/>
<br/>
Mille Bournes (It&#39;s a card game where you accumulate miles to win a &quot;race&quot; and has &quot;bad&quot; cards like run out of gas, pop a tire..etc)<br/>
<br/>
