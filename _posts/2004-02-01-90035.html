<div id="ygrps-yiv-626322113">I can&#39;t believe I am asking this question on a list like this.  Has <br/>
anyone tried hooked on phonics ????<br/>
My son always sees the commercial and has asked me to buy it (for <br/>
about a year now) so I finally did. They also have a hooked on math.<br/>
I feel like such a bad unschooling mommy :( I really wanted to do it <br/>
natrually over time with games. I can send it back after two months <br/>
if we don&#39;t like it.  He might like it or he might not. I just hate <br/>
how they hype it up becuase if he doesn&#39;t like it becuase it doesn&#39;t <br/>
work as fast as he thinks it should he may feel like a failure.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579701181">Sarah asked for it back the summer she was five...&quot;Mommy, I gotta get that! It&#39;ll teach me to read!&quot; So I said sure, and we borrowed a copy from the library. There was some workbook sort of thing with it (it was an older version, about 3 years old at that time) and when I said to her I&#39;d have to go buy her a notebook to write in since this one was just to look at because it belonged to the library and not for us....we never did get that notebook, the whole thing was never opened again...I returned it to the library and that was the extent of &quot;using&quot; HOP. I&#39;ve heard of some school-at-home families using it successfully though...<br/>
 <br/>
I suppose it COULD work, and work well, IF that&#39;s what the child wants to do and there&#39;s no  pressure involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-581632437">Yeah ! I ordered the one from the library and it was horrible. It <br/>
was old and missing things and just plain yuk!! He is going to be <br/>
eight soon and I would be happy if he waited a little longer. I am <br/>
doing it for him though per his request so if he doesn&#39;t like it off <br/>
it goes back to the supplier. I will say this he loves computer <br/>
games and they are suppose to have a bunch of new computer games <br/>
that come with it.  <br/>
<br/>
I love thelooks of the harvest moon game. I tried to talk Joey into <br/>
getting it but if it doesn&#39;t have a gun he doesn&#39;t like it <br/>

fluency and speed.<br/>
<br/>
The other night we were watching Once Upon A Time In<br/>
Mexico, and he needed some help with the subtitles<br/>
during the spanish parts because they went too fast,<br/>
but sometimes even I didn&#39;t get to the end of the<br/>
sentence before it disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
But there have been many times lately where I have<br/>
assumed he needed my help to read something, and he<br/>
has said, &quot;I already read it Mom&quot;.<br/>

Andrew will be 13 in June.<br/>

There&#39;s a cassette tape you might be able to get used, which was put out by <br/>
discovery toys.  It&#39;s called &quot;Sounds like Fun.&quot;  There&#39;s a song with letter <br/>
sounds.  Maybe you can buy it very inexpensively if you ask around your local <br/>
area.  Even  new it wasn&#39;t much.  Comes with an alphabet card with pictures  (if <br/>
it&#39;s still out there in print).<br/>

I, personally, was not talking about formal early-phonics <br/>
education.  I simply related a story about my DD loving two of the <br/>
new videos that we bought for her and, a side effect of that is that <br/>
she is learning her letters and some of the sounds that go with <br/>
them.  Isn&#39;t that what unschooling is all about?<br/>

Thanks for your input.<br/>
My son hates those alphabet shows always has.<br/>
I  originally posted about H.O.P. becuase I wanted to know if anyone <br/>
had any success with it. I going back to work and I thought I may <br/>
have to put my son in school if only for a year because I don&#39;t know <br/>
how I will be able to juggle it ??<br/>
That is where the H.O.P. started. I thought he would need to be able <br/>
to function in school if that is where I nedded to put him.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like to add to that the message sent to the<br/>
&gt;&gt; kids. Are you going to<br/>
&gt;&gt; buy anything and everything the kids think is cool<br/>
&gt;&gt; because they saw it<br/>
&gt;&gt; on an ad? That ad is successful because it is<br/>
&gt;&gt; incredibly manipulative.<br/>
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s like that &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; where he sends<br/>
&gt;&gt; away for the beanie<br/>
&gt;&gt; hat, thinking it will be greatest thing he&#39;ll ever<br/>
&gt;&gt; have. Then it gets<br/>
&gt;&gt; there and he&#39;s thoroughly disappointed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; l i z a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But isn&#39;t that a GREAT lesson in and of itself?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He never would have learned it if his mom or dad had<br/>
&gt; said, &quot;no, you can&#39;t have it.  it is a piece of crap.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you have $300 to spare and don&#39;t care? In Calvin&#39;s situation he <br/>
earned the tickets by eating loads of SugarFrosted Chocolate Bombs. If <br/>
he had to ask his &#39;rent to shell out $300, his father would have said <br/>
flat out no.<br/>
<br/>
Evan wants a real skateboard, not the toy kind we got him at Toys &#39;r <br/>
Us. A real one can cost more than $100 to put together. So we decided <br/>
to give him $3 a week so that he could save up for the skateboard. He&#39;s <br/>
got $93. He&#39; still looking forward to that board ... and in the process <br/>
has come to understand a thing or two about money. When he asked how <br/>
much that HOP thing was, I told him, &quot;about 3 real skateboards&quot;. End of <br/>
story :)<br/>

explore the thing to their satisfaction without paying full price.  <br/>
<br/>
Checking it out from the library or borrowing it from a friend, for <br/>
a couple of ideas.  Some homeschool groups even have their <br/>
own &quot;library&quot; with resources that families can check out.<br/>
<br/>
And HOP sets are for sale all the time on vegsource.com too, <br/>
sometimes pretty inexpensively.  (That, in itself, ought to tell you <br/>
just how bad the program is! LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great that Evan is saving for a skateboard.  Only 31 more weeks <br/>
to go!  Does he have the July date circled on the calendar?<br/>
<br/>
We have a used sports equipment shop up the street that sells <br/>
skateboards.  I wonder if they are real ones?  Hmmm...ah well, my <br/>
sedentary kids let their bikes and scooters and skateboards gather <br/>
dust.  Too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter, and rainy <br/>
all spring and fall.</div>

And if you buy it new, I think I remember from the ads that there&#39;s a <br/>
money-back guarantee.  If a kid *really* wants it (not the parent, <br/>
the kid), what a great &quot;learning experience&quot; to get it, investigate, <br/>
and if it&#39;s not what he wants, send it on back.  The power of <br/>
returning what turns out to be crap.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised to see Liza&#39;s advice, because this list is usually <br/>
so &quot;respect what the child wants, get him stuff he wants,&quot; etc.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t prioritize HOP over say, a Yu-gi-oh figure or a skateboard, <br/>
but should it be a lesser priority, if the child expresses real <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you really in the position to buy everything they express interest <br/>
in?  Ads like HOP&#39;s go through committees and focus groups and testing <br/>
and they get tweaked and scripted in such a way they&#39;ll elicit the <br/>
exact response of &quot;Mommy, I really want you to buy me that so I can <br/>
read&quot;. They&#39;ve got Pavlov all over them and ad agencies are not ashamed <br/>
of it either (especially if the ad gets them a Clio).<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it the responsibility of a parent, especially a parent that is <br/>
practicing awareness, to at least ask why the child would think they <br/>
need that to learn how to read? I am not saying do not buy anything <br/>
advertised on TV. What I am saying is, can&#39;t you take a moment of <br/>
pause, stand back and ask yourself why you want to comply with this <br/>
request. If you can borrow it at the library or from a friend, then run <br/>
and get it. If you are ready to lose money (remember, you do not get <br/>
reimbursed for shipping/handling/taxes/fees and that&#39;s where they make <br/>
a lot of their money), then hey, more power to you in this economy. But <br/>
really, are you buying them a learning tool or your own peace of mind <br/>
--even if it never gets used?<br/>
<br/>
I like to watch TV, especially kids TV. It dawned on me sometime last <br/>
year that my kids sometimes could not distinguish between an ad, a <br/>
video clip and a show. So one day we just watched TV for the ads. We <br/>
would wait for the ads, watch intently, mute the show and talk about <br/>
the ads: what they were about, what were they trying to tell us, how <br/>
that made them feel. It&#39;s really fascinating to &#39;deconstruct&#39; an ad <br/>
with a 6 and a 3 year old.<br/>
<br/>
The whole process of questioning why you would want to buy this is also <br/>
a learning process. In our consumeristic world, it is actually a much <br/>
needed learning process. I&#39;d add to that thorough researching of the <br/>
product and other slike it and how those $300+ would compare to other <br/>
things the kids may covet.  If my kids really want something, it <br/>
certainly comes up again and again in conversation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s happened with guitar & tae kwon do lessons, computer games, food <br/>
and even, dare I say, ways he feels will help him learn how to read. <br/>
Like making up crosswords or having spelling games or counting the <br/>
words he knows on any of our NYC outings. It&#39;s really getting <br/>
interesting now that he is asking for specifics.<br/>

<br/>
People who can afford to buy it, aren&#39;t limited to buying it! It&#39;s not their<br/>
only choice. They just have *one more* option than the people who can&#39;t<br/>
afford to buy it do.<br/>
<br/>
Buying something that&#39;s refundable so a child can see for himself whether<br/>
it&#39;s worth it or not is a great way for a child to see for himself the<br/>
difference between what ads say and what something actually is.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which means that you fear that advertising and packaging is more powerful<br/>
than a child&#39;s own ability to investigate a product and come to the<br/>
conclusion that the advertisers are wrong. You think that the advertisers<br/>
and packagers are so powerful that a child will convince himself a product<br/>
is good even if he&#39;s not enjoying it.<br/>

My daughter wanted to go to kindergarten instead of homeschool. I didn&#39;t<br/>
just sign her up! I asked why. It turns out she wanted to ride the big<br/>

do you see this learning process taking place, if the<br/>
child isn&#39;t allowed to be a consumer?<br/>
<br/>
They cannot fail to learn that some things are not as<br/>
they seem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thorough researching of everything they ask for would<br/>
get boring and tedious, and turn into &quot;school&quot; every<br/>
time they ask for a board game or a baseball bat.<br/>
<br/>
I understand researching something like your son&#39;s new<br/>
skateboard, to get one that he likes and will serve<br/>
him the best, or which wheels will give the best ride,<br/>
or whether graphite or WD40 is the best lubricant.<br/>
<br/>
I understand having him save his allowance for it, if<br/>
you can&#39;t afford it.  But not as an arbitrary &quot;lesson<br/>
in consumerism&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If my kids really want<br/>
&gt; something, it <br/>
&gt; certainly comes up again and again in conversation.<br/>

&gt; computer games, food <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So they should ask 3 times for guitar lessons? 5 times<br/>
for tae kwon do lessons? 6 times to try the new candy<br/>
bar or eat at the new restaurant in town?  <br/>
<br/>
So if they don&#39;t ask enough then they might not really<br/>
want it?  <br/>
<br/>
Some people let their babies cry for 10 or 15 minutes<br/>
before they pick them up, to make sure they really<br/>
want to be picked up.  Some babies stop crying, and<br/>
the parent thinks, &quot;see, they didn&#39;t really want to be<br/>
picked up&quot;, but in reality the child learned that<br/>
their needs weren&#39;t going to be met, so they gave up. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to lose interest in something<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t willing to meet that interest.  I<br/>
don&#39;t mean I&#39;m out rushing to buy everything they say<br/>
in passing, &quot;oh, that looks neat&quot;, but having<br/>
expressed a real interest, if it is within my means,<br/>
why not?<br/>
<br/>
Am I misunderstanding you?<br/>
<br/>
Allowing them to explore those interests, as much as<br/>
it is within our means, is one of the great gifts we<br/>
give our children, isn&#39;t it?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t withhold what I am easily able to provide to<br/>
teach them valuable lessons in consumerism.  I also<br/>
don&#39;t go into debt to provide things either.<br/>
<br/>
I think any child with $5 in their pocket and taken to<br/>
the dollar store or the candy store quickly learns to<br/>
be careful with what they buy.<br/>

It&#39;s not a magic ticket to reading.  <br/>
If parents let a child think so, I believe it would be like not reminding <br/>
them that G.I. Joe doesn&#39;t really have ammo.<br/>
<br/>
If a child really wants to go to boarding school, maybe a parent should honor <br/>
that.  On an unschooling list, though, the discussion might want to move <br/>
toward whether the parent is wanting help to persuade him NOT to go to boarding <br/>
school, rather than just discussing the relative prices and merits of boarding <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
And if a child doesn&#39;t like shows like Between the Lions or Sesame Street, <br/>
why would he like a little set of happy videos or recordings of similar things?  <br/>
Or of less happy/colorful/flashy things?<br/>
<br/>
I just think that instead of saying &quot;OOOH yes, here&#39;s a lovely early-phonics <br/>
product over here, Dennis!&quot; we might better remind people that young children <br/>
don&#39;t need &quot;early-phonics products&quot; to learn to read.<br/>

<br/>
My two older kids loved Sesame Street and they could name letters and know <br/>
the sounds before anyone would have been concerned, so that didn&#39;t even show.  <br/>
They probably don&#39;t remember learning it.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly did NOT like Sesame Street.  She used to say &quot;I HATE BIG BIRD!&quot; and <br/>
turn it off.  She discovered and started liking it just a couple of years ago, <br/>
and was thrilled that I had some tapes of favorite parts from years before.<br/>
<br/>
Holly can sing that letter-sounds song from Sounds Like Fun, but that might <br/>
not be where and when she really &quot;learned&quot; them, because learning is rarely a <br/>
one-legged stool, but it&#39;s three or four legs on the ground before it&#39;s solid.<br/>
<br/>
I believe strongly that when children learn on their own gradually, and <br/>
figure it out as Jayne did, and they know they did, that it gives them more <br/>
confidence to be open to learning other things on their own.   If a child or a parent <br/>
thinks a formal learning tool is crucial/important/vital to their having <br/>
learned something, that will reinforce them looking for formal learning tools in <br/>
future moments of perceived  need.<br/>
<br/>
This is online at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/deeper,">http://sandradodd.com/r/deeper,</a> but I&#39;ve lifted it here:<br/>
<br/>
The Deeper Effect of a Child Learning to Read: Confidence<br/>
<br/>
a Mom in a discussion online: A homeschooling friend has shared that she <br/>
feels we need to teach the basics then unschool them.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll:Your friend is wrong. If she&#39;s never experienced a child who <br/>
learned to read or do math without instruction then of course she&#39;s not going <br/>
to be able to imagine it&#39;s possible. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd: If what the friend is imagining is that a child who reads will <br/>
then acquire all the other knowledge on her own, that&#39;s not the worst vision in <br/>
the world. If what the friend is hoping is the child will get past the point <br/>
that the mom worries about getting in trouble or failing entirely, I can <br/>
understand her reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
If she REALLY wants to unschool, though, it will help her immensely to see <br/>
how many ways children can learn without reading. And it will help the children <br/>
immensely to have the deep confidence that they can learn without instruction. <br/>
Any child who has learned to read without &quot;being taught&quot; (and I have three of <br/>
them) cannot doubt that he can learn other things without finding a teacher <br/>
and following a prescribed course.<br/>
<br/>
Holly takes fiddle lessons. In the course of a month she has private, paired <br/>
and group sessions. She really likes that. She shows me what she learns and I <br/>
play with her at home. I found her some songs and a book and she goes outside <br/>
of just what the teacher has assigned. Many music students don&#39;t. <br/>
School-trained, or just lacking courage and joy, they will only play what the teacher <br/>
&quot;makes&quot; them play, or what the teacher tells them they can play, without thought <br/>
to the idea of figuring out that through experimentation and analysis, they can <br/>
figure out themselves what other songs might be within their range of ability.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby studies karate at a dojo where he&#39;s gone for seven years. He&#39;s part of <br/>
a longterm group, there are many adults there who have watched his progress <br/>
all those years, and once a week he teaches a class of younger children. So <br/>
although there is a prescribed course, there are several different aspects and <br/>
there is flexibility to the learning and activities he&#39;s involved in there.<br/>
<br/>
Had I just taught my kids to read and THEN unschooled, they would not be the <br/>
calmly confident people they are today. They might be saying &quot;Okay, mom, time <br/>
to teach me division&quot; or &quot;Mom, you didn&#39;t teach me to spell yet.&quot; Instead of <br/>
that, I help them learn whatever is in front of them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Somebody asked Rosie, yesterday, who taught her to read. I was there, <br/>
listening. She hemmed and hawed a little - then said, brightly, &quot;My own BRAIN taught <br/>
me to read.&quot; As if that answered it. The other kid (one of her girl scout <br/>
friends) was questioning her about homeschooling, not looking for THAT kind of <br/>
answer at all...but Rosie couldn&#39;t figure out any other way to answer the <br/>
question. I helped out by stepping in and saying, &quot;She means she taught herself.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kirby studies karate at a dojo where he&#39;s gone for seven years. He&#39;s part <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; a longterm group, there are many adults there who have watched his progress <br/>
&gt; all those years, and once a week he teaches a class of younger children. So <br/>
&gt; although there is a prescribed course, there are several different aspects <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; there is flexibility to the learning and activities he&#39;s involved in there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       This is exactly what DD14 has found at her dance studio and in <br/>
community theater. It all started with her own inspiration and desire, seeing opera <br/>
and plays and ballets -- it did NOT start with us and we never know quite where <br/>
it&#39;s leading. The best way we found to support her was to let her DO it, to <br/>
test and try and discover and own it. It is now leading her into teaching the <br/>
younger kids, and performing, and also technical theater (sets, lights, sound, <br/>
stage managing) which is a whole area none of us knew anything about but are <br/>
really enjoying with her.<br/>
<br/>
       There&#39;s a ps resource program here with semester courses the kids can <br/>
choose from. It&#39;s nice that the courses are not for credit, not tested or <br/>
graded, or under any requirements by the school, but what&#39;s REALLY great imo is <br/>
that the school forbids the parents to prescribe what the child will take! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
       Each child chooses privately for himself, after a day of presentations <br/>
by the different teachers pitching what the course will cover and what <br/>
activities there will be (darkroom work, or field trips to the university mag lab <br/>
and planetarium, or to the on-campus day care center to read to the little kids, <br/>
or producing a tv interview for the local access channel, etc)<br/>
<br/>
       Done this way, the students are free to decide if they want to venture <br/>
into something new or pursue something they already are deeply involved in. <br/>
Each course winds up with some of both, kids who really can learn from each <br/>
other without embarrassment or fear or force. Even when what they learn is that <br/>
this particular area is not for them, it&#39;s a good experience.<br/>
<br/>
       I just think that philosophy of the child owning the learning from <br/>
start to finish, without some prescribed outcome, is so important. And here&#39;s a <br/>
ps program that gets it, while there are too many homeschooling parents who <br/>
THINK they get it, but don&#39;t at all.  JJ<br/>

&lt;&lt; I understand researching something like your son&#39;s new<br/>
skateboard, to get one that he likes and will serve<br/>
him the best, or which wheels will give the best ride,<br/>
or whether graphite or WD40 is the best lubricant. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about skateboards, but I can tell all of you NOT to use WD40 to <br/>
loosen the tuning peg on a piano.  My sister had an old upright and one string <br/>
was way out of tune, and Hey!  I had a wrench from a harp!  But it would not <br/>
turn.  So I squirted it with WD40.  It turned!  Hooray!<br/>
<br/>
Not hooray.  It couldn&#39;t tighten up.  That string was as happy as the Tin <br/>
Woodsman and just relaxed entirely.  So it was still out of tune, but way low.  I <br/>
thought about sticking chalk or flour or baking soda or dirt in there to soak <br/>
up the oil and decided that I better leave it the heck alone and let New <br/>
Mexico take care of coating that with dust and in a few weeks or months maybe it <br/>
could be tightened back up.<br/>
<br/>
No sense ALL of us trying WD40 on a piano.<br/>

<br/>
I agree, but with a big &quot;but.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(&quot;BUT,&quot; one &#39;t&#39;!!)<br/>
<br/>
Written just that way, some new unschoolers might jump on that &quot;children own <br/>
their learning&quot; and then stay too hands-off, too distant, too &quot;it&#39;s your fault <br/>
if you&#39;re not learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems one of the failures of unschooling advice is that some people come <br/>
for just enough of it to go away and screw it up for a few years because they <br/>
leave their kids alone and they don&#39;t DO anything.  Sometimes it&#39;s because the <br/>
parents are imagining &quot;do something&quot; as to do book reports, memorize all the <br/>
major rivers of the world, etc.  But sometimes it&#39;s because the parents missed <br/>
the stories about the parents paying so much attention to their kids that they <br/>
know they have an interest in dance or theatre or karate, and the parents go <br/>
out of their way to let them try something out for a day or a year, and the <br/>
parents help them out by making sure they have supplies and money and outfits or <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
And now some people might read what I just wrote and be overjoyed at the idea <br/>
that I just told them they should find something their kid has expressed an <br/>
interest in and sign them up for a year&#39;s &quot;trial&quot; and spend a bunch of money so <br/>
the kid will feel guilty if he doesn&#39;t finish a year.<br/>
<br/>
I was using Elmer&#39;s glue yesterday.  I had to mess with the nozzle (like <br/>
y&#39;do) to get it to come out in a good stream.  And once the stream was flowing, it <br/>
didn&#39;t matter how much was in the bottle, the only point at which glue was <br/>
being dispensed was right there in that second, as I moved the glue bottle <br/>
along, keeping tension by squeezing not too hard, not too soft.<br/>
<br/>
Same with kids.  Once energy is flowing, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s going to <br/>
be five more minutes or five more years.  The parent just needs to pay <br/>
attention to that present moment and make sure things are operational and smoothly <br/>
facilitated.<br/>

<br/>
I did learn a tremendous amount about how a piano it<br/>
put together, can be taken apart to clean, how to<br/>
replace felt, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess some unschooling good did come out of it.<br/>
<br/>
The piano tuner guy was not too pleased though, and 3<br/>
years later we still are finding glue in the recesses.<br/>

With Guns) which is about how a little drop of water<br/>
becomes a trickle, keeps growing, breaks down the dam,<br/>
and at the end of the song the music has crescendoed<br/>
into a river flowing free.<br/>

<br/>
The title song is great too, btw.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the song reminds me of my family&#39;s journey to<br/>
unschooling, and how the river flows free now.  Once<br/>
the dam was broken, there was no holding back the<br/>
kids&#39; enthusiasm and joy in learning.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, but speaking as someone who lives in the desert, lots of drops of water <br/>
never make it past the place they fall.   STILL, though every tiny bit a <br/>
child learns might someday attach itself to something else.  And it can take years.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents don&#39;t get the privilege of seeing their children&#39;s <br/>
education all finished and neatly packaged before they turn 18.  Parents of <br/>
school-kds and school-at-homers (doh!) get the illusion of a package of learning, <br/>
finished.<br/>
<br/>
But what we can get if we work at understanding it is that things DO pool and <br/>
stream and flow!!<br/>
<br/>
But we can&#39;t channel every drop into a torrent.  That&#39;s not our job anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
All learning happens inside the learner.   The outside indicators aren&#39;t <br/>
learning.  They&#39;re tricks, or grades, or a diploma or whatever, but they&#39;re not <br/>
themselves anything LIKE learning.<br/>

so hard for people to grasp real learning. There is no test, no time schedule, <br/>
no beginning or end and it can be very messy, especially to track. It moves <br/>
forwards and sideways and back upon itself and it never ends. Kind of like a <br/>
riddle...<br/>
