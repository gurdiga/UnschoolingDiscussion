&gt; I like your sense of humor ;-)   although there are some definate truths in<br/>
&gt; what you said... what is that saying... &quot;there is always truth in jest?&quot;...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you have copies of that video??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ned answers, Yes, well we could make them. If you&#39;d like one, please email<br/>
me privately and we can talk about it. I&#39;ve already been suspected of trying<br/>
to &quot;sell something&quot; to this group.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote yesterday that I have made several hour-long TV programs, called,<br/>
&quot;School is Hell,&quot; that I play (sponsor -- it means that I take<br/>
responsibility for their content) on the local cable-access channels in area<br/>
towns. Luz and I sometimes make copies to send to homeschoolers (and others)<br/>
in other areas where they sponsor them on their local channels. It has been<br/>
a hobby. For example, when Linda Dobson comes to CT, we tape her talk and<br/>
make it into a program and play it on public access. She is glad to give us<br/>
permission. Same for John Gatto, Sam Blumenfeld, Pat Farenga, and others --<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
Call it a &quot;Labor of UN-love&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like a tape, let me say first that they are not in any way made in<br/>
order to help families homeschool/unschool their children. They are personal<br/>
rants/ diatribes -- just me talking, with an edge of displeasure -- about<br/>
the failings of the public school system.  I do not make these programs for<br/>
their general entertainment value.  My purpose is to tell parents the goals<br/>
of those schools, the damage they do to the children, the parents, the<br/>
community, the culture, so they will at least consider taking the kids out.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve made about 200 programs over the past 8 years and most of them are<br/>
about how rotten the public schools are.  As time passed, and I went to<br/>
school board meetings listening to them talk about their (terrible) programs<br/>
and dishonest policies, imagining that those elected neighbors would take an<br/>
interest in changing things for the better. I found out that they are part<br/>
of the problem, and they are not even trying to be the solution. In fact,<br/>
they promote all the bad stuff that the schools do. They are the rubber<br/>
stamps for the school establishment and its employees. In CT, the local<br/>
school boards are agents of the state, not representatives of the town&#39;s<br/>
people. --- Yeah, it&#39;s that bad... They do the bidding of the state dept of<br/>
ed instead of working for local parents and children.<br/>
<br/>
In this town, the local public access station televises all school board<br/>
meetings, so in my programs, I use tape (copied) from those meetings in<br/>
order to show the residents just how corrupt the system is. The local<br/>
schoolers have been up in arms about the programs (and me personally, of<br/>
course) for years, but I have continued, and the programs have become more,<br/>
shall we say, strident and confident until nowadays I simply call them<br/>
School Is Hell, and play it as a series of thirteen programs running each<br/>
week (twice) as a TV series. At the end of the three month cycle, I run<br/>
another series.  <br/>
<br/>
Much of my material comes from Gatto, Holt, Greenberg (Sudbury) and  the<br/>
books  of about one hundred other people -- all critical of the PS system<br/>
and therefore offering encouragement to take children out.<br/>
<br/>
A few titles are:<br/>
<br/>
Who Controls Our Children?<br/>
School Corruption<br/>
Public School: War Against Children<br/>
  This is the Title of a series of many programs<br/>
Readin&#39; Writin&#39; and Ritalin<br/>
Dying For School<br/>
If Parents Ran the Schools... I & II<br/>
    a list of questions about the bad policies that schools use<br/>
The High Price of Dumbing Down<br/>
What Parents Need To Know<br/>
Public School Teach Dumbness<br/>
Parents Versus the State<br/>
How Schools Got Dumb<br/>
Who, Exactly, is Teaching the Children?<br/>
Phonics Is How Reading Happens<br/>
   -etc.<br/>
<br/>
....you get the idea, Since the school system is seamless, every thread<br/>
(topic) leads to the central problem that the system is a fraud.<br/>
<br/>
All programs are one hour, suitable for play on public access, although<br/>
there might be some variations where you are.<br/>
<br/>
I have, in this way, been what is called an &quot;activist.&quot; Sponsoring the tapes<br/>
is my way of challenging the edu-stablishment. My hope is that others will<br/>
do it too.<br/>
