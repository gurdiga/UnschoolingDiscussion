<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796912979">Now mind you I am just speaking for myself here. Each person is so<br/>
different. For us the bible is very interesting collection of stories.<br/>
My husband and I both read the bible together in the early stages of our<br/>
marriage.  My husband I were to be lifted up to bible leaders in the<br/>
church we were in many years ago.  My children are familiar with it.  My<br/>
oldest more so than the rest but that has been out of curiosity since<br/>
most of her friends are catholic. And if my kids want to take a CCD<br/>
class or go to a bible group I would be more than open to that.<br/>
<br/>
As for Jesus. My entire family sees him as a great teacher. My husband<br/>
sees him as a shaman. My children see him much the same way I do. A<br/>
great man who lived long ago who came to teach us much.  Much like your<br/>
friend I see Jesus as a great prophet but not the son of God. I<br/>
personally believe the teaching of Jesus are a good thing to read to<br/>
kids as well as Buddha&#39;s teachings and many others.<br/>

Does the bible play any part in your life? I mean even as a historical<br/>
document. Do you disregard it totally? I have a friend who is a Hindu<br/>
(from<br/>
India) who knows more about the bible and Jesus than most proclaimed<br/>
Christians. She also holds Jesus in great esteem as a prophet but not as<br/>
the<br/>
son of God. How does that fit in your beliefs? Religion is one of my<br/>
passions. I am so curious. I would appreciate any info. you would be<br/>
kind<br/>
enough to give me. Excuse me if my questions seem silly. Thanks.</div>
