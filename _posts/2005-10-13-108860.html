<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520200866">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I live in Attleboro, Massachusetts and we are planning on moving to <br/>
the lakes region in New Hampshire. Bridgwater is a very small town and <br/>
everything is so far away compared to where we live now. I am sort of <br/>
nervous because we live in a city where there is so much near us and <br/>
so many wondefful families. So I thought I would just take a peek and <br/>
see if there are any fellow &quot;like minded people&quot; that I may be in that <br/>
area.<br/>

Please feel free to mail me if you out there - thanks<br/>
