<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943550165">I love the internet, I love my website, I love history, and I love  <br/>
the future.<br/>
<br/>
Robyn Coburn wrote something once about her dad, who was a  <br/>
professional juggler.  I put it on a webpage, as a connection from  <br/>
another juggling page I had, and linked it to the page where I  <br/>
collect and link some of the best of what Robyn has written.<br/>
<br/>
On Robyn&#39;s article &quot;The Beautiful Park,&quot; I had an e-mail link so that  <br/>
people could contact  her for reprinting it.  It&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for me, that link was outdated.  (It&#39;s fixed now.)<br/>
<br/>
But luckily for me, Robyn and a guy in England whose name I don&#39;t  <br/>
know, my address worked fine and I could contact Robyn.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I love cellphones.  I tried to call Robyn, called her husband  <br/>
James who gave me the house phone number (I had saved cellphone  <br/>
numbers from when I picked them up at the train station when they  <br/>
came to Albuquerque for the Live and Learn conference)...   and I  <br/>
know I still haven&#39;t gotten to the point, but that&#39;s part of what  <br/>
enables the excitement, is the very many things that led up to it,  <br/>
most of which we&#39;ll never even know.<br/>
<br/>
So I could talk to Robyn quickly; that was cool.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the e-mail I got:<br/>
<br/>
=====================================<br/>
<br/>
Hello Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I sent this email to Robyn at the address for her I found on your  <br/>
website, but it bounced. If you have a more up-to-date email address  <br/>
for her, please could you forward it on to her?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

Subject: Elimar: a video<br/>
<br/>
Hello Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
I found your address after searching google for &quot;Elimar juggler&quot;. A  <br/>
friend passed on a VHS to me with this video clip on it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.juggling.tv/vaults/view_video.php?">http://www.juggling.tv/vaults/view_video.php?</a> <br/>

<br/>
I thought you would like to see it.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

==================================================<br/>
<br/>
JUST TODAY, November 12, this guy had put up video of Robyn&#39;s dad  <br/>
juggling.<br/>
<br/>
Robyn had NO video images of her father.  She has very few photos.    <br/>
She was a little choked up and a lot happy.<br/>
<br/>
You can get to all the other links referenced above from this, and  <br/>
see the video clips too:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/jugglingrobyn">http://sandradodd.com/jugglingrobyn</a><br/>
<br/>
The only link that comes up right now if you google Elimar juggler is  <br/>
that page.<br/>
Soon, the other page will show as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m giddy.  This is very exciting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Had to add my praise here, I had never heard of unschooling until I<br/>
found it on the internet whilst searching for homeschooling info.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t quite believe it but thanks to the internet, the more I <br/>
read the more I wanted it for my family.  Unschooling websites, <br/>
especially Sandra&#39;s gave me the confidence to take the step and I<br/>
have never looked back, just learning more and more.  My daughter <br/>
(11) reads Wikipedia for hours at a time, one subject leads to <br/>
another, just because she wants to and, of course, because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t go to school anymore, she has the time.<br/>
<br/>
Love it, and I love this list, thank you all so much.<br/>

to keep their jobs (or  create other ones) while luring kids (and  <br/>
