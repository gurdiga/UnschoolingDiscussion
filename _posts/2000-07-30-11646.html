 </span></blockquote>Hi Dianna:<br/>
<br/>
I know that when we decided to do this I had researched unschooling vs <br/>
homeschooling for 3 years so at least I wasn&#39;t doing it blind.. I read every <br/>
book I could on unschooling, typed the word &quot;unschooling, unschooler, <br/>
unschooled&quot; into AOL, Yahoo, Snap.com and every other search engine I could <br/>
find... I went to Barnes and Noble, Borders (sorry guys), Amazon.com etc etc <br/>
until I felt I couldn&#39;t learn anything more before making a decision (which <br/>
of course I could)... This whole exercise in it&#39;self is unschooling... When I <br/>
am interested in learning about something I will ask questions, do research, <br/>
contact other people and have all my &quot;stuff&quot; in front of me and then be able <br/>
to make decisions about what I want to keep and what I want to throw away.... <br/>
same as unschooling...<br/>
<br/>
My son spent 5 hours on the computer yesterday (5 years old) playing Madeline <br/>
2nd Grade Math (which he knows how to do) in conjunction with using his <br/>
dinosaurs to count so that he can add things up (ever seen 75 + 27 dinosaurs <br/>
laid out on the bedroom floor before!!!)...  I kept asking him if he (a) <br/>
wanted help to which he replied &quot;no thanks mum, just juice&quot; and (b) would you <br/>
like to do something else to which he replied &quot;no thanks mum, just a Pnut <br/>
Butter and Jelly Sandwick (which he had at the kitchen table)....He then got <br/>
out his number game (that&#39;s what he calls it) and puts all the cards in order <br/>
and starts chosing ones he wants to add and subtract.. He&#39;s been on the math <br/>
kick for a couple of weeks now... Soon he&#39;ll move on.... He asked about <br/>
letters and reading yesterday afternoon and I asked him if he wanted to learn <br/>
to read.  he said yes, so now I have to figure out how to do that... Someone <br/>
suggested a phonics books for the sounds... I&#39;m only interested in using <br/>
those as a jumping off point... I think we&#39;ll go around the house and write <br/>
the words of all the appliances,  etc... DS just came into my office and I <br/>
told him we were going to do that and he said &quot;can we write the word DOG&quot;  <br/>
favorite word at the moment... I said &quot;we don&#39;t have a dog what shall we <br/>
stick it on?&quot;  He said &quot;I have a toy SPOT THE DOG, maybe we could stick it on <br/>
him&quot;.... There&#39;s unschooling and using your imagination for you.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway off to make labels....not the kind that say &quot;my child is a honor <br/>
student at blah blah blah school&quot; but the kind that teach him something and <br/>
help his self esteem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279603037">I laughed when I read this, because that&#39;s probably the truest thing <br/>
ever said about unschooling!  It&#39;s one of those things that&#39;s different <br/>
for everybody, there are as many ways to unschool as there are <br/>
unschoolers.  For us, it means atm that we don&#39;t think about what <br/>
the kids are learning, because I know they will always learn.  I don&#39;t <br/>
worry about &#39;basics,&#39; because what might be basic to me isn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily basic to my kids.  Dd1, (nearly 5yo) for example, is <br/>
getting into reading and writing, she was asking me how to spell <br/>
something.  I was trying to tell her that if you think about how you <br/>
say the word, then take the letters that make those sounds, then <br/>
write it down, you will have that word, and she just doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
know it.  What could be more &#39;basic&#39; than phonics?  Anyway, I&#39;m <br/>
rambling.   If we use workbooks it&#39;s when the kids want them, <br/>
textbooks would be treat like &#39;normal&#39; books.  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the group, Dianna (is that pronounced dy-anna or de-<br/>
anna?  I&#39;m asking because dd2 has a Trekkie middle name...) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195871757">Hello, I just found these support/discussion groups online and joined <br/>
four, so this post may show up a few times in your in-boxes.  My name <br/>
is Kathleen Madrid. I have five-year-old twin daughters, Isabella and <br/>
Martha.  We recently moved to Sharpsburg, MD from Germantown.  We <br/>
have no family, friends or support groups in the area and are <br/>
desperate to make some connections. I&#39;m a single mom trying to <br/>
homeschool/unschool with no clue as to how I should be doing this.  <br/>
I&#39;ve done some reading, but I feel overwhelmed by the whole process <br/>
(what will happen in January when I meet with the Washington County <br/>
school official?; should I be using a curriculum?; do I need daily <br/>
lesson plans?; can the county make me put my kids in school if they <br/>
don&#39;t like the way I&#39;m doing things?; etc...) I have been letting the <br/>
girls lead the way, directing their own learning for the most part, <br/>
but that too is worrying me. One of my daughters loves reading, the <br/>
other one &quot;hates&quot; it (probably because she mixes up her letters a bit <br/>
and gets frustrated when she sees her sister learning with more <br/>
ease).  Should I just leave the reading alone for awhile, or do I <br/>
keep encouraging her to try? They also have such different learning <br/>
styles.  If anyone has experience with twins I&#39;d really appreciate <br/>
hearing from you. <br/>
My ex-husband has been very supportive of me keeping the girls out of <br/>
school, but now he&#39;s really starting to push the idea of enrolling <br/>
them in kindergarten just so they can meet some other children. I <br/>
really don&#39;t like that idea, but unless I can find some other ways to <br/>
connect with people he may end up taking me to court.<br/>
If anyone can offer any help with any of these issues I&#39;d be very <br/>
grateful for your input.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624270346">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Hello, I just found these support/discussion groups online and joined <br/>

<br/>
Try going to www.nhen.org and clicking on the county contacts. You may<br/>
discover a whole network of nearby home schoolers with park days and other<br/>
opportunities for social interactions, and advice on the administrative<br/>
&quot;hoops&quot; for your state.<br/>
<br/>
That website also has very clear information about the State education<br/>
statutes - click on the legal info tab. That should put your mind at ease -<br/>
if you agree that knowledge is power. Is the legal school age 5 in your<br/>
State?<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;should I be using a curriculum?; do I need daily <br/>
lesson plans?;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not if you are Unschooling which by definition includes not using either of<br/>
these, unless your child has asked to set it up that way. It seems unlikely<br/>
that 5 year olds would be doing so. At least my 5 yo would have absolutely<br/>
zero interest in the idea of limiting herself with a daily plan. Unschoolers<br/>
try to think in terms of &quot;learning&quot; rather than &quot;teaching&quot;, so adult<br/>
instigated curricula or lessons are avoided.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I have been letting the <br/>
girls lead the way, directing their own learning for the most part, <br/>
but that too is worrying me.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You have come to the right place to find hundreds of other families who are<br/>
going beyond even &quot;letting&quot; but enabling and facilitating their children<br/>
directing all their own learning. Keep reading and be reassured!<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;One of my daughters loves reading, the <br/>
other one &quot;hates&quot; it (probably because she mixes up her letters a bit <br/>
and gets frustrated when she sees her sister learning with more <br/>
ease).  Should I just leave the reading alone for awhile, or do I <br/>
keep encouraging her to try? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the encouraging is actually making her *feel* DIScouraged, then perhaps<br/>
you should stop for the moment. When the time is right for her, it will<br/>
probably suddenly become effortless seeming, as many others have<br/>
experienced.<br/>
<br/>
Have you been to www.sandradodd.com/unschooling  ?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They also have such different learning <br/>
styles.  If anyone has experience with twins I&#39;d really appreciate <br/>
hearing from you.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the greatest things about Unschooling is that it allows us to honor<br/>
the individuality, quirkiness, special brilliance of our children without<br/>
reference to charts, bell curves, competitions or milestones. Sometimes it<br/>
seems like curriculum using home schoolers, who are mimicking school<br/>
schedules, treat close in age siblings as if they were one entity with two<br/>
heads. It&#39;s great that you are free from that phenomenon.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My ex-husband has been very supportive of me keeping the girls out of <br/>
school, but now he&#39;s really starting to push the idea of enrolling <br/>
them in kindergarten just so they can meet some other children.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you are able to reassure him that you have taken steps to meet others<br/>
locally, he may feel better and stop pressuring you.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the journey.<br/>

Hi Kathleen, I&#39;m Danielle, Unschooling mom to Emily (7), Julia (5) and <br/>
Sam (4)--no twins but *very* close in age. ;)  We live in Southern <br/>
Maryland, which is pretty far from where you are. I know Beth Wecht, a <br/>
member of this list, lives somewhere out your way, so she may be able to <br/>
offer more info than I.<br/>
<br/>
You might also try contacting this woman to see if she can be of any help:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:camillebauer25@...">camillebauer25@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s an active email address or not, I got it off the <br/>
Maryland Unschoolers site at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kaligecko.tripod.com/">http://kaligecko.tripod.com/</a>  which <br/>
doesn&#39;t look terribly up to date.<br/>
<br/>
You might also find the following email lists helpful (not sure where <br/>
else you signed up, since this is the only intro I&#39;ve seen):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics</a>  A list geared towards <br/>
newbies and beginner&#39;s questions<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled</a>  A list geared towards <br/>
unschooling young children--till around age 8--where I know there are at <br/>
least two single moms who might be helpful (yep, count me as another <br/>
shameless self-promoter!)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling in Maryland is very easy. Reviews vary from county to <br/>
county, though they tend to be pretty relaxed for the early years, so <br/>
don&#39;t panic about curriculum. The easiest way of all to Unschool in <br/>
Maryland is to join an Unschooling-friendly umbrella organization like <br/>
New Creation Academy, run by Wendy Bush--this is the one I use. I choose <br/>
the peer review option, which costs only $75 per year for my <br/>
*family*--not a per child charge--and that allows me to review only once <br/>
a year instead of twice with the county and I review with another <br/>
Unschooler in my area. Feel free to email me offlist if you&#39;d like to.<br/>
