<div id="ygrps-yiv-671388546">Our son has a BB gun, paintball gun, a compound bow and a shot gun.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Maine &quot;The Way Life Should Be&quot; , many kids here have them/their <br/>
parents have them for them. Maybe we are behind in the times I dont know? Maybe <br/>
we are preserving old traditions? Whatever it is from this side of the street <br/>
it looks and feels like old times/holsome family traditions.<br/>
They dont kill people or hurt them. They have been taught what they are for <br/>
and how to use them.<br/>
<br/>
Dustin and my husband have been hunting for several years now.  Every year <br/>
for two months each weekend day they hunt. So far the last two years they have <br/>
not found a deer that was suitable.  Roughly that&#39;s 16 days a season and 128 <br/>
hrs of sitting in the woods and talking about the woods, life, animals, guns, <br/>
people, history and so on...  My husband has taught our son what to look for in <br/>
a deer, tree scrapings, branch signs, sounds and what bedding areas look like. <br/>
 I am not fond of deer meat but they like it. Luckily for me they have only <br/>
shot 2 in 6yrs. Personally sitting in the woods freezing doesn&#39;t interest me at <br/>
all but they dont seem to mind it!<br/>
<br/>
As a family we used to go to 3D shoots.  That is using a recurve or compound <br/>
bow walking a trails with 30 targets, standing at the stake knowing the <br/>
yardage and hitting the target with an arrow in the score zone.  We have a fake deer <br/>
in our yard that we shoot at some times. We dont go that ofetn anymore due to <br/>
the little ones.<br/>
<br/>
Our son shoots his BB and sling shot in the yard with his friends. They aim <br/>
at cans or a box. They know what I consider safe. They wear protective lenses <br/>
and shot one at a time or on a line.  So far it kinda reminds me of something <br/>
out of the Stand By Me movie or Sandlot. It&#39;s old-time childhood fun without <br/>
the &quot;you&#39;ll shot your eye out&quot; comments (Christmas Story).<br/>
<br/>
We dont live in an area where people get shot hardly ever or go nuts with <br/>
guns. For us the gun criminals are mostly formers from another state.  <br/>
I know my son I know what we contribute to his life. I know his experience <br/>
with guns has been a positive one. He knows how to clean them, load um, make the <br/>
shells and will have his own man-ly weekend trips im sure. My husbands dad <br/>
still hunts with them so I suspect they will do the same when he has children.<br/>
<br/>
He has been to Maine Conservation Camp and loves to woods. He takes walks <br/>
leaving a trails to see if he can find his way. He uses his compass and skills. I <br/>
am confident that he could find his way out if he was ever lost.<br/>
He plans to be a fish and game officer or join the military.  Whatever he <br/>
chooses be it those or not he has found interest in something and I think its <br/>
great. <br/>
