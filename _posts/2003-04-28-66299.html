<div id="ygrps-yiv-434853594">*****My fave was on a 14 hour flight from Italy... my ds was 13 months old <br/>
and at that stage where he wanted to stand up and nurse, flip over and <br/>
nurse, climb and nurse :-p ******<br/>
<br/>
You mean I&#39;m not the only one who has dealt with this??? LOL  Chloe is only <br/>
7 months but her favorite thing to do right now is squeeze her feet between <br/>
my legs, stand straight up in front of me and nurse.  It looks so silly!  If <br/>
we are laying down, she wants to be on her hands and feet, upright in a big <br/>
triangle position and nurse that way.  For some reason when she does it, she <br/>
really makes slurpy sounds and it is SO hard to be discreet in public!  <br/>
Sure, no one can SEE anything but the *sounds* sure seem x-rated!!!  I just <br/>
laugh and go with the flow.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also into this suck-pull-release nursing stage.  Drives me bananas!  <br/>
She&#39;ll latch on, suck two or three times, puuuullll my nipple three states <br/>
away and POP.  Yeeoowww!  It takes us 3 hours to fill her belly sometimes.  <br/>
Makes for interesting, lazy days around here!<br/>

But that is way too cute. Reminds me of when Alyssa was so nosey and wanted<br/>
to pick up her head and look from side to side but never releasing when she<br/>
nursed!!! I really miss those days. I was so ready to nurse a long time with<br/>
my last but she had other plans. She weaned herself very early. Enjoy the<br/>
days you have. I envy you.<br/>

This may sound odd, but thank you!  I&#39;m so fortunate with Chloe.  The <br/>
longest I&#39;ve ever nursed any of my kids was 5 months.  I was in an on again <br/>
off again depression and my marriage was very rocky for a looong time.  My <br/>
milk supply was severely hindered because of it.  Both my boys were very <br/>
sick because I nursed them past the point I should have stopped so they <br/>
could grow and be healthy.<br/>
<br/>
  Our marriage is finally on solid ground.  I finally told my husband how <br/>
devastating my nursing experiences were with the boys.  I felt like a <br/>
complete failure.  Less than a woman.  I hated my body for not working <br/>
properly.  It was terrible and agonizing.<br/>
<br/>
With Chloe, it has been a dream.  We had a rocky start but I begged my <br/>
husband to give me the time I needed to stay in bed all day and nurse until <br/>
we (Chloe and I) got it right.  He did and here we are...she&#39;s seven months <br/>
old and nursing strong!  Just this one thing has made me a completely <br/>
different person!<br/>
<br/>
I think her nutty nursing just makes me nervous.  I&#39;m afraid that she&#39;ll <br/>
decide to wean before *I* am ready.  That&#39;s hard to deal with.  I envision <br/>
at *least* two years of nursing but I know that sometimes, babies have their <br/>
own plans.  I just hope she nurses long enough for me to get past my own <br/>
failure issues.  For the first time, in a long time, I don&#39;t feel like I <br/>
want another baby right away.  This is hard and embarrasing to admit, but <br/>
even though I always wanted a huge family, I think had I had better <br/>
experiences, I may have spaced things out a little more.  I really love <br/>
having the kids all so close in age, but it is *SO* nice knowing Chloe will <br/>
be my baby for a while.  Usually by the time our babies are 7 months, I&#39;m at <br/>
least a month or two pregnant.  I wish I could have given all the kids two <br/>
years to be the only baby.  I work hard to make sure they all get needed <br/>
attention, which I feel confident they do, but now that Chloe is this age <br/>
and Caeleb will be 2 in a couple of months, it&#39;s nice to have the time to be <br/>
able to lay around nursing all day.  When you have a 13 month old and a new <br/>
baby, it is so different.  Not bad, just different.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, this got WAY deeper than I had planned.  Basically, I just wanted to <br/>
say thanks for shining some light my way.  I needed it!<br/>

I am glad you are so enjoying your bf experience. I love to hear moms talk<br/>
like that. I remember an old friend who had children way before I did<br/>
talking about how much she enjoyed bf and I just couldn&#39;t understand what<br/>
would be so enjoyable for her.<br/>
<br/>
My first 3 children were only nursed for a few months each. They each went<br/>
through a very cranky period and all I kept hearing was that it was my<br/>
breast milk. Even the pediatrician suggested I switch to formula. I really<br/>
didn&#39;t know anything else. No one in my family ever breastfed and no friends<br/>
did for more than a month and I had no support whatsoever telling me<br/>
otherwise. I stopped nursing as I didn&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
<br/>
With my last, I was determined to bf the way I always had wanted to. My life<br/>
was in a whole different direction and I had major support. Of course the<br/>
family was the first to say whenever the baby would cry the least little bit<br/>
that it was probably my breast milk. How nice huh??? I had developed a major<br/>
nasty case of ezcema all around and on my nipples. They bled and I would<br/>
also get a breast infection every few months but I refused to stop. When my<br/>
husband saw what my breasts looked like, he even suggested I switch to a<br/>
bottle, not formula, just a bottle. Well after our little chat &lt;bg&gt; he never<br/>
mentioned that again!! I was all set to go at least 2 years nursing but<br/>
Alyssa had other plans for me. She weaned herself down to 3-4 times a day at<br/>
age one and when she was almost a year and a half, she stopped completely<br/>
within 2 days time. I kept asking if she wanted to nurse and was heartbroken<br/>
when the answer kept being no. I still long for those days. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll<br/>
get another nursing chance again.<br/>

ROFLMFAO!!!!  Laughing *and* crying! Crying because some of you are lucky <br/>
that you have kids that nurse for so long. My babies were no longer <br/>
interested, and as much as I tried coaxing them to keep nursing, would have <br/>
no part of it right around their first birthday. (Funny, my mom said I did <br/>
the same thing.)   Lara...........</div>
