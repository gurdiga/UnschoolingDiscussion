<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009778086">I have a little project underway which will eventually end up as part of what <br/>
NHEN (National Home Education Network) will offer for new homeschoolers. I <br/>
would like a very very large number of short blurbs - words of advice from <br/>
experienced homeschoolers for those just getting started.<br/>
<br/>
I need a few lines or a paragraph (if you want to write more, we&#39;ll call it <br/>
an article and be THRILLED to have it, too) in which you tell a new <br/>
homeschooler something you consider valuable for them to hear as they get <br/>
started on their homeschooling adventure.<br/>
<br/>
If there is anything you&#39;d like to write an article about - related to new <br/>
homeschoolers, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll use your full name or only your first name and state, if you prefer.<br/>
<br/>
Send responses to me, please.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Pam<br/>
