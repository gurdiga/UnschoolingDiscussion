<div id="ygrps-yiv-384208324">Hi,<br/>
I read the part of what the womans concerns were and immediately I <br/>
thought of this................................................<br/>
My stepson who is 15 years old will be 16 come september and if hes <br/>
lucky and passes he will be in the ninth grade @ age 16 heck if he <br/>
does well he might be out by 20 if he doesn&#39;t drop out by <br/>
then.  ?????????????????????????????????????? I would like to add he <br/>
has been in public school ALL of his life !!!!!!!!!!!! You can tell <br/>
that story to your friend and tell her I am an unschooling friend of <br/>
yours LOL........<br/>
My son who I know is not @ the leel of his friends doesn&#39;t concern <br/>
me because he will get it when hes ready. I can remember long ago <br/>
when he (my stepson) was my sons age he use to come to my house <br/>
crying saying he was stupid now that I have my own son I totally <br/>
understand !!! The schools made him feel this way. I would like to <br/>
add that this boy is very intellegent and I feel sad for him. I <br/>
would like to scoop him up but I can&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337274544">She did make me thing though... And thats sad that she had that affect on <br/>
me! Now I am wondering if maybe in order to go to college my son NEEDS <br/>
higher math... or how to write a essay, ect...<br/>
We do &quot;Math&quot; but its in everyday things, like cooking, driving and feeding <br/>
the baby!<br/>
We never sit and do book work math... we tryed doing times tables a few <br/>
weeks ago and that didnt go over well!<br/>
My son went through 4 years of Public school, and he was feeling stupid and <br/>
dumb because of the teachers telling him what he SHOULD be doing at his <br/>
grade level... I am glad I took him away from that, but people that start in <br/>
on you about &quot;How is your son going to get into college?&quot; make me rethink <br/>
everything! UGH!<br/>

<br/>
The assumption is that everyone enrolled in school and forced to go gets that <br/>
education you are referring to. It&#39;s been my experience that this is not <br/>
really the case. Was it here I read recently that out of a class of 30, 10 get it, <br/>
10 don&#39;t care so they teach to the other 10 in the middle who might care but <br/>
don&#39;t get it. I seriously doubt that those 10 always get it either. So say <br/>
maybe, and I think this is a high guess that 15 out of 30 get what is being <br/>
taught at any given time. The 10 that don&#39;t care have turned it all off so they <br/>
aren&#39;t getting anything. <br/>
<br/>
The school kids I knew/know turn school off at about 3pm, except for homework <br/>
(if they do it and a lot don&#39;t) they don&#39;t even want to hear anything <br/>
educational.  I think I&#39;m rambling here but in short I am trying to say that you <br/>
could send a kid to school and he could go clear through and not get an education, <br/>
many do.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I guess you could do drill and kill at home too but as you probably <br/>
already know that is not much fun. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s amazing what people can do when they are motivated by a goal <br/>
they set. I think a good base of real life experience will take them much further <br/>
than 4 years of higher math. I think the connections happen much faster as <br/>
they are learning because they can remember where in life these things applied. <br/>
I remember not too long ago one of my older boys coming to me after starting a <br/>
new job and asking me if I could help him figure out the tape measurer. He <br/>
was working in a construction type job and really needed to know this. He had <br/>
always had a bad math phobia in school which hurt his self esteem a lot. We <br/>
spent about 20 minutes going over measurement and he stepped back amazed. He told <br/>
me that this was really easy but that in school this was all in a book and he <br/>
always ended up so confused. He never had another problem. (Well, with <br/>
measuring, LOL)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  The difference between kids in school and your son is that those kids in school get sent to be taught all the things they&#39;ll need to know by the time they graduate (hahahahaha)  because Lord knows, learning is hard work and not fun and those elastic brains of youngsters begin to harden and grow stale by the time they hit 18 or so. If they don&#39;t know what they need to know by then well goodness, that&#39;s all she wrote.<br/>
    Your son however is ever and always learning. He&#39;s been shown that life learning is the important thing and so, if he finds some area lacking when he gets to a certain point in his life when he needs it, he&#39;ll learn it.<br/>
      You know that proverb..Give a man a fish, he&#39;ll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he&#39;ll eat for a lifetime (something like that). School is handing out fish while you&#39;re showing your son how to use the fishiing pole.<br/>

What is TCS !!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
I agree with Joyce (and maybe a few others) that we are not <br/>
obligated to justify why or what we are doing with our childrens <br/>
education. I also agree with you that we could be planting seeds for <br/>
other children out there. I understand both sides of this coin and I <br/>
think when you are being asked you need to discern where that person <br/>
is coming from. Are they genuinely interested or are they grilling <br/>
you ?? I have started out eager explaing with wide eyed enthusiasim <br/>
only to be spoken to with rudeness with remarks said to me that I <br/>
would never dream of saying to another person EVEN when I didn&#39;t <br/>
agree with them. A friend of mine once told me that I shouldn&#39;t take <br/>
it personally - it just makes them question what they are doing and <br/>
they don&#39;t like that. These insecure people feel better when <br/>
everyone is doing the same thing so they don&#39;t really have to look <br/>
at what is happening and &quot;question athourity&quot; <br/>
I have the wost spelling I hope you understand what I am saying <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30921839">TCS &quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot; I believe there is a website for it, but I didn&#39;t save it as there wasn&#39;t much to it in my opinion. There was supposed to be a link for an email discussion group but it didn&#39;t work. It may have changed since I last looked, but a google might turn it up!<br/>

<br/>
That was my comment on how I decided how to aim information, generally, when <br/>
I was teaching jr. high.  I figured if I was presenting some standard piece of <br/>
information, ten already knew, ten didn&#39;t care, and I was directing the info <br/>
to the other ten.<br/>
<br/>
I tried as often as I could to provide NON-standard information.  Once a week <br/>
I &quot;just did a ballad.&quot;  Fridays were ballad days.  I called it poetry and <br/>
literature behind their backs, but they considered it just for fun.   None of <br/>
them had heard the ballads so there was a chance of possibly getting everybody&#39;s <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I managed that with other things, but not often.<br/>
<br/>
And if they&#39;d been free to come or go, few would&#39;ve stuck around for the <br/>
ballads either, but they liked it better than reading and writing, generally.  It <br/>
was interesting to them on various levels.  And some had to do with sex and <br/>
violence, a bit, and that they liked.<br/>
