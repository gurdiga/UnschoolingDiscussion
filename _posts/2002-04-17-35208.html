<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is it normal to have this feeling that if the child changes at all, even one <br/>
&gt;little bit, you&#39;ll just die of sorrow, because you&#39;re so completely <br/>
&gt;infatuated with the way they are this very minute? Today was almost <br/>
&gt;painfully great. He is learning so much, every second, it&#39;s all I can do to <br/>
&gt;just keep up, let alone push. I can see the brain changing every day -- I <br/>
&gt;feel like his baby clock is ticking down and I&#39;m going to wake up and find <br/>
&gt;he&#39;s a little boy. Nooooo!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Love,<br/>

At the moment, my youngest son is about to turn 12 and showing the first <br/>
little signs of puberty. I look forward to the wonderful teenager / <br/>
young adult he is about to become, but my heart aches already for the <br/>
beautiful, sweet, exciting child he is about to leave behind to be held <br/>
only in my memory. parenthood is so very bitter / sweet.<br/>
