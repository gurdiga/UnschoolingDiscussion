<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118841146">&quot;Schools like to say that they create and spread knowledge. It would<br/>
be closer to the truth to say that they collect and hoard knowledge,<br/>
corner the market on it if they can, so that they can sell it at the<br/>
highest possible price. That&#39;s why they want everyone to believe<br/>
that only what is learned in school is worth anything. But this<br/>
idea, as much as any other, freezes the class structure of society<br/>
and locks the poor into poverty.&quot; John Holt, &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; p.70</div>
