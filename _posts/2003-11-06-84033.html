   From: Fetteroll &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fetteroll@...">fetteroll@...</a>&gt;<br/>
What if one of your children grew up, had a family and started involving her<br/>
family in a cult you&#39;d heard scary things about? Her happiness and<br/>
confidence might give you the impression she&#39;s still rational, but why would<br/>
she be making such irrational, scary and &quot;obviously&quot; wrong decisions?<br/>
How much would you be interested in what she was doing with the cult? If you<br/>
already knew it was bad, wouldn&#39;t anything she said sound like brainwashing?<br/>
On the other hand, how much would you be interested in hearing comforting<br/>
words that she was coming to her senses and thinking straight again?<br/>
They&#39;re fishing for those comforting words because they&#39;re scared.<br/>
Everything they&#39;re certain of about what kids need -- and society confirms<br/>
it for them -- you&#39;re apparently oblivious to.<br/>
I liked Susan&#39;s answer about blitzing them with what the kids are doing. :-)<br/>
That way you aren&#39;t allowing yourself to take a defensive position and<br/>
proving you&#39;re right. You just blaze on ahead with full knowledge that you<br/>
are right :-)<br/>
Another tactic is to give them inforamtion to read and say you&#39;ll be glad to<br/>
discuss it when they&#39;re done reading.<br/>

Good points, Joyce.  I never thought of it as being scary to<br/>
them...cult-like. And they don&#39;t really want to hear what I have to say<br/>
because they have already determined it is brainwashing or so far from norm<br/>
that I don&#39;t deserve too much of a conversation over it. I do try to tell<br/>
most, that even mention it, that we do this and that and the kids are<br/>
learning so much and then at the end of my rah-rah speech, someone will say,<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re not going to do this through high school?!&quot;  I didn&#39;t come to<br/>
homeschooling from early on like many of you, but when I heard about it, I<br/>
researched it and I read about it and then I went further and found<br/>
unschooling and then! I found this group!  Oh my!  But I never said, &quot;Oh,<br/>
that&#39;s ridiculous.&quot;  Most people in general aren&#39;t very open to new or<br/>
different things...<br/>
...Makes for boring family get-togethers!, Lisa</div>

another look at your decision if it ever seems *to you* that it is no <br/>
longer working.<br/>
