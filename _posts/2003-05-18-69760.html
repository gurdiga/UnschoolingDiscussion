<div id="ygrps-yiv-314432635"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve observed in his overall personality that he gets easily <br/>
 </span></blockquote>frustrated when something isn&#39;t going right for him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that this is where perfectionism starts lots of times. It&#39;s <br/>
just an overall personality trait. We can certainly make it worse, or <br/>
try to ease it a little, but I think it&#39;s one of those things that is <br/>
just a part of who we are. Some of us get it way worse than others. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Now he&#39;s doing this sort of thing with writing.  HE wants to learn <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to read and write and has been very persistent in asking me <br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; him. I&#39;m struggling to find the words to reassure him <br/>
that -he&#39;ll learn- to read not by me &quot;teaching&quot; him but just because <br/>
he wants to learn and he&#39;ll pick it up.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well you can teach him what he wants to learn without setting up a <br/>
full-time reading curriculum for him. He&#39;s asking to learn. Go for <br/>
it! Make it a game. Make labels for things for around the house and <br/>
see how many he can stick on the right object in 1 minute. Switch <br/>
them around and see how quickly he can get the labels back on the <br/>
right item. Play word concentration. Play with word families. Write <br/>
him simple little notes. Do as much as he wants and stop when he&#39;s <br/>
seems &quot;full.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;DS also *begs* for workbooks when we&#39;re at the bookstore and is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>very interested in knowing what &quot;grade level&quot; they are. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Casey used to love workbooks. She still does them a bit now and then. <br/>
She loved knowing the grade levels too. We&#39;d just make it a kind of <br/>
joke though. She plays games that range from ages 3 to adult. She <br/>
does workbooks and plays computer games that are all over the grade <br/>
levels. Just by experiencing how arbitrary those &quot;standards&quot; are, she <br/>
has seen for herself that they&#39;re meaningless in her world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Is there any way to reassure him that just &quot;doing your best&quot; is all <br/>
 </span></blockquote>we can do in life?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can and should reassure him lots. There&#39;s no way to *make* him <br/>
believe it though. He needs more life experience. I believe we *get <br/>
it* by living it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; How can I be there for him and help him to work through his <br/>
 </span></blockquote>frustrations without imposing my own wishes or solutions on him?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll have to live it too. See what works. Judge for yourself when <br/>
you think he&#39;s looking for help and when he needs you to back off. <br/>
You&#39;ll find your rhythm.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want them to live in someone else&#39;s &quot;box&quot; but to be able to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>follow their own paths.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The grade level stuff is really not so all powerful when they&#39;re not <br/>
in school. They hear it and maybe compare to an extent, but it desn&#39;t <br/>
define them. They are already living outside the box and following <br/>
their own path.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son has always been quite a perfectionist. I have no drawings of his<br/>
showing balloon-footed stick people, because he didn&#39;t want to draw things<br/>
at age 3 that &quot;didn&#39;t look real&quot;. My daughter, OTOH, creates with abandon.<br/>
One thing that really helped here is when I became more conscious about my<br/>
kids seeing *me* make mistakes. More specifically, once I started working on<br/>
my novel, my son asked to sit with me while I was reading it out loud and<br/>
editing it. He was amazed at *how many* &quot;mistakes&quot; I had made that I needed<br/>
to change. We had some long conversations about what it means to truly do<br/>
something and how even famous people like writers, painters, and scientists<br/>
rarely get something right the first time around. It takes repeated trials,<br/>
errors, and efforts. After that, something seemed to loosen inside him and<br/>
he became a prolific writer, even though his handwriting is all over the<br/>
place and his spelling is largely phonetic.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  However, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;having a hard time seeing this in my child because (in retrospect) I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;learned that &quot;perfect&quot; is not really (IMO) attainable or desirable.  Is<br/>
&gt;there any way to reassure him that just &quot;doing your best&quot; is all we can<br/>
&gt;do in life?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe look for less ways to tell him that, and more ways to show him. I<br/>
think to kids it must look as if adults can just do everything perfectly the<br/>
first time. Rarely do they get to see us struggle, make mistakes, get back<br/>
up and try again. By the time they&#39;re born, we can usually already do most<br/>
things that we need to, and we tend to stick inside our comfort zones. So<br/>
I&#39;d say, take a risk and do something with him or near him that you&#39;ve never<br/>
done before. Bake a souffle&#39;, write a haiku, take up an instrument you don&#39;t<br/>
know, rent some rollerblades or skis and let him see you fall on your butt<br/>
(literally or figuratively)!<br/>
I remember the day my kids watched me do a triathlon for the first time (the<br/>
first time they watched, not the first one I did). They saw a volunteer hang<br/>
a &quot;finisher&#39;s medal&quot; around my neck (which all races seem to give out now,<br/>
harrumph, but that&#39;s another rant about why adults can&#39;t just do something<br/>
for the sake of doing it and not a prize). Anyways, they started screaming<br/>
&quot;You won mom! You won!&quot; and I had to explain to them that I didn&#39;t actually<br/>
win. That led to a rather lengthy discussion about why I would do the race<br/>
if I wasn&#39;t going to win, what winning really meant, how I defined success,<br/>
etc.<br/>
Another example: one thing I like about the Suzuki method of violin, which<br/>
the kids are taking right now, is that they encourage parents to learn<br/>
alongside their kids. Wow, talk about getting perspective on just how hard<br/>
it is. When you&#39;re screeching and scratching your way through Twinkle,<br/>
Twinkle Little Star, you get a lot of insight into how hard *everything* is<br/>
for kids. We adults should do more of that kind of thing--put ourselves in<br/>
the position to learn something totally new and remember just how danged<br/>
hard it is! I have done a fair bit of teaching of various things to<br/>
adults--computers, skydiving, swimming to adult non-swimmers, and the single<br/>
greatest thing to get past for all of them is the fear of making mistakes.<br/>
As adults, it has had years to be ingrained deeply. The further we can go<br/>
now toward making sure our kids know that making mistakes *is how we learn<br/>
anything*, the better off they&#39;ll be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, how do you all handle &quot;schoolish&quot; lingo with the littler ones?<br/>
&gt; What I mean is the &quot;age/grade level&quot; that workbooks, games and<br/>
&gt;activities put on their products and things like that.  I&#39;m having<br/>
&gt;difficulty explaining that it&#39;s all arbitrary, but DS is taking it<br/>
&gt;literally and seems to be really focusing on these labels.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, first off I&#39;d examine how he heard about it in the first place. Ask<br/>
him where the context is coming from. Or if you provided that context in the<br/>
first place, examine why/how you did that. Most 4 year olds wouldn&#39;t know<br/>
about age or grade levels unless someone told them. When my son has asked<br/>
&quot;Why does this Lego box say &quot;8 and up&quot;, I just tell him the truth: for some<br/>
crazy reason, our society requires them to do that, but it&#39;s totally<br/>
meaningless. If you can, maybe just offer to make him some workbooks at<br/>
home. Avoid going down the aisle in the store that has the workbooks unless<br/>
he asks to. My son used to love it when I made up worksheets for him. I&#39;d<br/>
draw silly pictures and it would become an interactive activity. Disclaimer:<br/>
He totally asked for this, after seeing workbooks in a store. I have *never*<br/>
required him to do workbooks on any subject. He does like them though.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s a few things that have really helped around here. I&#39;ve seen my<br/>
son&#39;s perfectionism really back off in the last couple of years, and I think<br/>
it was a combination of things that did it (including just getting older, of<br/>
course). Your child is four, right? Four is probably a hard age for kids.<br/>
They&#39;re old enough to know the vast scope of things they might be able to<br/>
do, but young enough so that it might seem to them that they haven&#39;t<br/>
mastered very many, and all of them are still very difficult. They don&#39;t<br/>
realize that in just mastering walking and talking, they&#39;ve done some of the<br/>
hardest things that humans every have to learn!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really nice post, Robin.<br/>
<br/>
I think, too, that truly succeeding in *something* helps too. Cameron&#39;s a <br/>
perfectionist. He is easily frustrated by things and used to give up quickly. <br/>
At 12, he became one the best magicians anywhere. Truly incredible. Some of <br/>
the BIG names in magic were in awe of this *little* boy with *little* hands <br/>
doing these amazing things (mostly manipulations). It took A LOT of doing <br/>
magic to get that good---and a lot of tears and frustration. But he saw what <br/>
he could accomplish. <br/>
<br/>
Now, when he&#39;s frustrated at drawing or drumming or guitar or <br/>
filming/editting or writing or...whatever, I can point out how hard magic <br/>
was. And that he CAN do whatever he wants to do. He realizes now how hard <br/>
some things can be, but that if he just keeps working at it.... <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the perfectionism isn&#39;t *gone*, but he&#39;s not as critical of himself <br/>
as he used to be. It&#39;s age, I&#39;m sure. But it&#39;s also the knowledge that he&#39;s <br/>
done something even tougher before. And the more you do it, the better you <br/>
get.<br/>

<br/>
    My son does this to himself with drawing, too, but with writing, he <br/>
doesn&#39;t. lol <br/>
<br/>
    I put up his Pikachu he drew on the wall, and he said it wasn&#39;t perfect.  <br/>
I told him I knew it was Pikachu, what else was his goal?  He said he wanted <br/>
it to be perfect, I told him he could trace it, but he didn&#39;t want that <br/>
either.  I told him practice can make perfect, if that&#39;s really what you <br/>
want.  It&#39;s still on the wall,  wavily deformed, and I love it, lol. I told <br/>
him later, that&#39;s what I call art, when you feel something, not necessarily <br/>
when it&#39;s aesthetically perfect.  <br/>
<br/>
With writing, well, cursive anyway, when I ask him what letter this is, or <br/>
that, he looks at me like I &quot;should&quot; know.  Told him that there are many ways <br/>
to write a letter, but it&#39;s gotta be a way &quot;someone else&quot; can recognize as <br/>
that letter!  He didn&#39;t like that very much, hehehe.  One, that I pointed out <br/>
something so obvious, and two, because that wasn&#39;t any fun.  <br/>
<br/>
 I think he&#39;s developing his own secret cursive alphabet, now, actually, but <br/>
I can&#39;t be sure, because, of course, it&#39;s secret.  He&#39;s got his arm wrapped <br/>
around the paper, and he&#39;s peering at me suspiciously whenever I walk by, <br/>
which I think is funny, because he knows I CAN&#39;T READ IT!!!  LOL  <br/>
<br/>
Perfectionism vs recognition, creativity vs set concrete goals.  Do you write <br/>
or draw it so that someone else can read it or recognize it,  and is that <br/>
your goal, or not?  Making that distinction for him was useful. He forgets, <br/>
and gets frustrated drawing, and I remind him.   A lot of the time I just ask <br/>
him, what&#39;s your goal, do you have one?,  and that frees him up quite a bit. <br/>
<br/>
And, btw, I&#39;m not concerned at all about cursive, he&#39;ll probably decide to do <br/>
what his father does, which is to simply never write in cursive.  They both <br/>
have short, thick fingers, and it&#39;s just not practical.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135982728">My 4yo is the same way.  He rarely draws (which I have mentioned <br/>
before) and a few weeks ago he decided to draw a Harry Potter story <br/>
after we read something from Little Bill.  He got SO frustrated <br/>
because the head was too big, the body was the wrong size, on and <br/>
on,  ahhhh!!  I kept trying to reassure him which just seemed to <br/>
frustate him more.  Darn it if the minute I walked away he drew for <br/>
about an hour!!  Who knew..LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Robin I loved your idea about making mistakes in front of them.  <br/>
WE are pretty forthcoming in discussing when we screw up.  Also, Dad <br/>
plays video games with him and he sees his Dad keep trying which I <br/>
think is helping him.  Also, lately he has succeeded at a few things <br/>
so maybe that will help turn things around for him.<br/>
