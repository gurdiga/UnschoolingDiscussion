&lt;&lt; I have just begun looking into unschooling and I am wondering by reading<br/>
 these posts if it is more of a pagan style? I have seen a lot of things on<br/>
 the wiccan way and pagan sites and I was just wondering. &gt;&gt;<br/>

     I too have noticed that there are a lot of &quot;pagan&quot; families on this <br/>
list.... I myself am Christian.  Unschooling is a style of learning where the <br/>
parent lets the child learn in a way that is best for them (very <br/>
oversimplified I know). I know many, many different types of people that <br/>
unschool that represent many different religions (or have no religion at <br/>
all).  My  point is that unschooling is not a religious style, it is a <br/>
learning style (however, some particular religious groups may be attracted to <br/>
unschooling).<br/>
