This whole post was so beautiful, and this part so especially profound, I<br/>
wanted to thank you.  <br/>
<br/>
Helen compared your writing style and clarity to John Holt&#39;s, and I can<br/>
see that too.  But there is a kind of deep respect for children and a<br/>
love  in your words that didn&#39;t always shine through in John&#39;s writings. <br/>
<br/>
So, thanks for being a light in the darkness.<br/>

Sometimes I hear &quot;GET THAT TORCH OFF MY ASS, who do you think you are?&quot; more <br/>
than &quot;thanks,&quot; but that&#39;s okay. &lt;g&gt;  Occasionally I get a letter two or three <br/>
years later saying &quot;Thanks for lighting that fire under me that I didn&#39;t <br/>
think I needed at the time.  It changed our family&#39;s life.&quot;  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>For many years I was the only person in our homeschool community who <br/>
admitted to new people - well, anyone really - that the homeschooling <br/>
life can be hard at times, especially in the early years as you work <br/>
through all the issues that inevitably arise. I always said I thought it <br/>
was worth it, but I wasn&#39;t prepared to say that changing your whole mind <br/>
set and life was easy either. For example, when someone said their <br/>
husband was totally against homeschooling, and what should they do, I&#39;d <br/>
try to help them find ways to talk him into agreeing to a trial for a <br/>
year, and ideas on what to do during that year to &#39;convert&#39; him. The <br/>
others would just tell her to ignore her husband, and he&#39;d &#39;get over <br/>
it&#39;. Etc. etc. I was told I should shut up, that if people thought there <br/>
were negatives they wouldn&#39;t even try homeschooling. Must put a positive <br/>
face on everything, and tell them that whatever they did would be <br/>
lovely. And because everyone else was doing this, some new people got <br/>
quite offended by what I was saying. But as the years went by, I have <br/>
had so many people say that the memory of me saying &#39;it&#39;s hard <br/>
sometimes, but it is worth it&#39; was the only thing that stopped them <br/>
sending their kids to school when they ran into a tough patch. They <br/>
would think of all the people who said how great and easy it all is, and <br/>
feel hopelessly inadequate. Then they&#39;d remember what I said, and know <br/>
that they weren&#39;t the only one ever to have doubts and hard times, and <br/>
keep on going. It has been good to get that feedback, but it must be <br/>
nice to get the instant thanks all the time that the positive thinking <br/>
brigade get by dishing out only what people want to hear at the time.  ;-)<br/>

<br/>
Well that&#39;s the same sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
I never say &quot;ignore him, he&#39;ll get over it,&quot; but I don&#39;t usually recommend <br/>
compromising unschooling, either, because people can go twelve or fifteen <br/>
years &quot;compromised&quot; and they never get loose of the structure that they&#39;re <br/>
hanging onto &quot;just until&quot; they can move on to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, like bike riding and playing guitar, only happens when you <br/>
actually DO it, and that&#39;s what I tell new families who want to unschool.  <br/>
Reading and thinking about it won&#39;t convince them, but their kids can, given <br/>
the chance.<br/>
