<br/>
I used to fill out a pretty chart showing I practiced every day.  Every<br/>
single day.  Did the pieces get any better?  Well, no, not while I was<br/>
reading the Anne of Green Gables series *while* practicing....<br/>
<br/>
Who cares if you fill out the chart if you don&#39;t take your brain with you to<br/>
the practice room!!<br/>

Holly loves hers.  She likes lists and checklists and forms to fill out.  <br/>
<br/>
her checklist has seven squares after each item, and she goes down and fills <br/>
in each square.  Some of them are listening.  Those are the least likely to <br/>
be completed.  She has four CDs and various listening assignments.  She has <br/>
movement assignments and bodily exercise things and things that seem designed <br/>
either to make her comfortable with and familiar with the instrument or to <br/>
build particular little muscles and muscle memory, or both and all.  And then <br/>
there&#39;s actual playing.<br/>

where I was practicing the clarinet.  Funny how fast those 30 minutes used<br/>
to go.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
