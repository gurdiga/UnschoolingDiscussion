&lt;&lt; In my opinion, unschooling requires a parent to trust the child to make <br/>
the <br/>
right decisions for the child, at the right time, regarding education.  <br/>
Elsewise, it is parent-directed learning, and *not* &quot;unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, those are not the only two choices.<br/>
<br/>
If a child has no idea what his options are, he can&#39;t make an informed choice.<br/>
<br/>
And by the way &quot;child led learning&quot; isn&#39;t my favorite phrase, and I don&#39;t use <br/>
it as any central definition at all.  It it too misused by people who intend <br/>
to disparage unschoolers.  Learning does not have to be all up to the child <br/>
*or* &quot;parent directed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have done lots and tons of things together.  Neither he nor <br/>
I chooses or decides them all.  Neither of us has ever really forced the <br/>
other to do something against his will, either.  Twenty-four years, and so <br/>
far so good.   So far so good with Kirby, 15 years.  And so on.<br/>
