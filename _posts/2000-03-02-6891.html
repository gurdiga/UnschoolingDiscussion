hi sus,
<p>my son, also 4 (last sept), is really wild.&nbsp; he would most likely
be &#39;labeled&#39; adhd if i let someone.&nbsp; one person, a health practitioner,
tried and i stop going to her.&nbsp; those label, imo, are nothing but
distracting and limiting and keep you from getting to know who your son
really is, which, i think, is both the fun and the priority of these early
years.
<p>my son runs in circles at night to wind down (and sometimes even stays
up after we&#39;ve gone to bed and comes to bed with the use of a flashlight
when he&#39;s ready - weird i&#39;m sure but he&#39;s happy and healthy, - &#39;if it works
go with it&#39; is our motto:), paces when he&#39;s telling a story, loves being
read to but has flat out refused to learn to read (i think he&#39;s just waiting
until it no longer will require work &lt;g&gt; a rather efficient approach
i think), he &#39;invents&#39; things, &#39;designs&#39; computer games and robot, mixes
up &#39;chemical experiments&#39; (i.e. trashes the bathroom:) and is busy at what
he&#39;s busy at.&nbsp; he will rarely color, when he does it&#39;s pure &#39;energy&#39;,
he won&#39;t try to write, when he paints it&#39;s for 5 mins max. and all the
colors end up as one big brown spot &lt;g&gt; but he&#39;s happy and capable just
not interested in following some prescribed formula for the best approach
to learning.&nbsp; when people talk about their kids reading and writing&nbsp;
i simply tell them: &#39;right now rene&#39; is not at all interested in learning
those things&#39;.
<p>early on i had entertained the ideas set forth by waldorf etc. e.g.&nbsp;
play music -which he hated (though that is changing),&nbsp; dolls -which
he has no interest at all in, fairies - again could care less, silk scarfs-
nothing &#39;boring&#39; as he says, stuffed animals sit on his shelves etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
he likes any and all construction sets, building guns, is not real interested
in store bought ones,&nbsp; computer software: both games - whoops and
hollers while playing some squirrel combat/ninja freeware game - and educational
(the other night he stayed up until midnight to play a german cd from kidspeak
(transparent language) then the next morning the first thing he did was
play the indonesean cd for over an hour- go figure:)
<p>i&#39;ve just been reading an interview with grace llewelyn.&nbsp; here&#39;s
a quote i think applies to the bigger picture (the &#39;it&#39; refers to her first
hand experience with unschoolers at her camp &#39;not back to school camp&#39;):&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#39;it confirms for me that there&#39;s something about unschooling that helps
people to really grow as human beings, not just in the narrow, academic
sense, but just really grow as human beings.&#39;
<p>this is what, i believe, is at the heart of raising children.&nbsp;
imo, the reasons schools fail is because they remove the academic component
from its natural context and progression.&nbsp; in an attempt to find that
&#39;one right way&#39; to learn they strip away all the creative approaches that
children naturally come up with.&nbsp; unschooling is a leap of faith in
your child innate curiosity and desire to learn.&nbsp; what this looks
like will be utterly unique for each and every child.&nbsp; unfortunately
our society is so rooted in comparisons and competitions, and strongly
sets forth the notion of the &#39;one right way&#39; that it is hard to maintain
this faith.&nbsp; but then that&#39;s why there are groups like this, to help
in those time of doubt, which seem to come and go.
<p>i know this (and most my posts:) is long but one last thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
at first i found rene&#39;s &#39;maleness&#39; so different i tried to curb it.&nbsp;
that just compromised our relationship - made him feel controlled which
was exactly the truth!&nbsp; so from my experience i would recommend accepting
him (ahhd and all but try and forget the labels) and give him lots of opportunity
to be physical - wear him out (i.e. we have water balloon fights in the
tub:)&nbsp; a good book is <u>the wonder of boys</u>.&nbsp; for me it help
to shed some light on this great mystery (for me not for dh he already
got it:) and i just learned to work with it rather than change it.&nbsp;
i think people have the right to develop their true natures.
<p>best of luck,
<br>susan

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133547315">Hi,<br/>
Absolutely you need to just pull back and trust that your little boy is an<br/>
active, intelligent little guy who will definitely read and write etc. when<br/>
he is ready!! You do trust him and yourself and you are just feeling bad cos<br/>
of the odious comparisons!! I know cos this happens to me much more than I<br/>
would like. Sometimes I can catch myself and laugh at my silliness - you<br/>
know, &quot;Wow their five year old can write whole sentences and my seven year<br/>
old still holds his pencil like a battering-ram! Even though he can do<br/>
gymnastics and running and jumping and displays &quot;remarkable kinesthetic<br/>
achievements!! - wow *grin* he still shows no interest in learning to play<br/>
the flute!&quot; We are always comparing.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I find useful is sometimes to sit and watch a bunch of kids<br/>
the same aga in the playground. I ALWAYS come away knowing that no matter my<br/>
kids academic standard, whether he be &quot;above or below average academically&quot;<br/>
at the moment, his nature and character are so far superior to the<br/>
school-kids with their pack mentality that HS is definitely the way to go<br/>
<br/>
Love<br/>
Michelle<br/>
Regards,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589457508">Yes, you&#39;re feeling the societal pressures.  He&#39;s just not ready yet. <br/>
If you can delay these activities until HE&#39;S ready, you will both feel<br/>
greater success and accomplishment.  Avoid the power struggles.  He&#39;s<br/>
still SO young.  Provide the crayons, puzzles, paper, glue sticks, etc.<br/>
and perhaps occassionally let him see how YOU use them, but then sit<br/>
back, relax, and watch for his signs of readiness.  Eventually, he may<br/>
be content just to even draw/color swirls and abstract images.  Actual<br/>
drawings and coloring can take time to develop and lots aren&#39;t<br/>
interested until about age 6 or 7 years.<br/>
