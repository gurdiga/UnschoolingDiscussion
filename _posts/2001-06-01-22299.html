<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441926109">My feelings are that homeschooling (or unschooling) is just another choice--I <br/>
still have one kid in ps and she wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. She is very <br/>
active in extracirricular activities and an honor roll student. She&#39;s a <br/>
&quot;social butterfly&quot; and very well-liked--by people of every type. She has been <br/>
taught never to judge people by their looks, so she enjoys the company of <br/>
nearly every person she encounters. She has never been &quot;damaged&quot; by her <br/>
choice of education--she has thrived on it.<br/>
What a sad world this would be if our choices were taken away from us--even <br/>
those that are not appropriate  for some of us. (including my son)</div>

<br/>
Ok, but I still don&#39;t entirely understand this. I mean, school *is* an<br/>
environment lacking in choice. Someone else makes ALL your choices - what<br/>
you do, how you do it, when you do it, even what you eat sometimes, when you<br/>
go to the bathroom a lot of times, when you &quot;get to&quot; exercise, sing, do art.<br/>
I mean the lack of choices is horrifying! Your entire day is controlled for<br/>
you in almost every way. Except for the (20 minutes here) of recess twice a<br/>
day when you (hopefully) get to decided what you want to do and how to do<br/>
it, school is the place devoid of choice by it&#39;s vary nature.<br/>
<br/>
I often wonder if adults who feel that they thrive on structure, that they<br/>
need a very segmented and structure day and life are those we just suffered<br/>
at the hands of the institutionalized educational system. Once they left and<br/>
had no one telling them what to do all day, they had no idea how to function<br/>
so had to create their own rigid structure.<br/>
<br/>
What reminded me of this is that my son has always loved our carefree<br/>
lifestyle and now is suddenly &quot;booooored&quot; if there is not someone telling<br/>
him what to do all day. This is obviously a result of PS (even in daycare he<br/>
could create his own days). I&#39;ve been trying to decide how to best de-school<br/>
him: whether to just go cold-turkey or to do some modified curriculum and<br/>
slowly decrease it until it&#39;s normal for him to conjure his own days. In the<br/>
end, I decided to just make a calendar for the summer (as much for his good<br/>
as mine - to try to keep up with the pre-registrations for different things<br/>
we&#39;d all like to do) and let the kids fill it in. But now I wonder if that<br/>
was just supporting this theory that he&#39;s unnecessarily structured and rigid<br/>
and in need of being told what&#39;s next all the time and I wonder if I&#39;m doing<br/>
him a disservice by inadvertently supporting that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756976416">Although school is regimented, some schools are moving away from that.  I <br/>
managed to have lots of choices in school because I would propose things and <br/>
pull them off (a friend and I designed a current-events class where the kids <br/>
did the presentations and the teacher was just kind of a class sponsor, and <br/>
we got history credit), and I took lots of music, which has its own kind of <br/>
structure-traditions (group music has to), but I was in there because I <br/>
really wanted to be and so the structure was of my own choosing.<br/>
<br/>
I believe there are people whose joy and imagination are snuffed out by <br/>
school.  Lots of people.  I believe there are some who use school as a drab <br/>
background on which to play out their imaginations, and they use the extra <br/>
time the structure saddles them with to be creative in their heads, or on <br/>
paper.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that off all the people in the world there are more followers <br/>
than leaders, and there are more who need social attention than there are <br/>
loners.  And so some seem to crave and appreciate school, or the military, or <br/>
jobs so structured there is NO question what to do or when or where--you go <br/>
to work and you follow the procedures and your work is inspected for you.  <br/>
There are some brain-damaged druggies who prefer prison to being out and <br/>
trying to find a place to live and something to eat without the convenience <br/>
of robbing convenience stores.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad to me, but it seems objectively and really true that some people are <br/>
followers and they really want to be told what to do and how.  I&#39;m sure that <br/>
was happening before schools were created.<br/>
<br/>
We went to a historical museum the other day.  It has existed here for over <br/>
20 years, but I had never gone.  They&#39;re collecting and re-creating buildings <br/>
from around the state.  I saw a museum in Salt Lake City which was similar, <br/>
and they had gathered buildings from around the valley.  But theirs are of a <br/>
closer range of time, being all late 19th century.   The one here ranged in <br/>
intent and such from early 17th century to the late 18th.  They had brought a <br/>
schoolhouse from Raton (a couple of hundred miles away, from a town near the <br/>
border of SE Colorado, in post-railroad, coal-mining days.<br/>
<br/>
Putting that school near the older buildings was a heck of an anachronism.  <br/>
The way the inside was set up was 1915, 1920.  But it didn&#39;t seem to matter.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just too picky, but it seemed to me that the illusion was being <br/>
created (and certainly will be for young impressionable kids who aren&#39;t clear <br/>
about the difference between &quot;built in 1880&quot; and &quot;built in 1710&quot; or in &quot;the <br/>
building up the hill was here when they were using wooden oxcarts&quot; and &quot;this <br/>
building was moved from a distant town that was railroad-based.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the Josefina Montoya books, but I sincerely hope they don&#39;t <br/>
have her going to that one-room schoolhouse in the 1820&#39;s.  If so, the <br/>
schoolbus might as will pick her up and take her down there, it will be so <br/>
thoroughly anachronistic.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, there&#39;s a picture of Abraham Lincoln on the wall! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
