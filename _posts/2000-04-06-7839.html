&gt;   I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; imagine telling my<br/>
&gt; &gt; child,&quot;no&quot; when asked to help him read a word!!  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; put &quot;unschooling&quot; into<br/>
&gt; &gt; words so easy for others to understand.  I felt a<br/>
&gt; &gt; sense of confirmation that<br/>
&gt; &gt; what we are doing is right, as every once in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; while, I need to hear it.<br/>

&gt; You know when I first started this home/unschooling<br/>
&gt; journey I was still &quot;programmed&quot; to do this the<br/>
&gt; &quot;school way&quot;. But I soon realized that when my DD asks<br/>
&gt; &quot;how do you spell&quot;.... All I had to do was tell her! I<br/>
&gt; no longer had to say &quot;go look it up&quot;. Besides I always<br/>
&gt; hated it when my step-mother said that to me! It was<br/>
&gt; so freeing!<br/>

If a spouse or business coleague asked us we would just tell them.<br/>
We wouldn&#39;t disrespect them by telling them to look it up. I&#39;m trying<br/>
very hard to get into the habit of telling them how it&#39;s spelt or<br/>
explaining I don&#39;t know but we can look it up and check.<br/>
