<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect you&#39;re suspecting that the reason your 14 yo helps and your 7 <br/>
yo doesn&#39;t is because the 14 yo had assigned chores and the 7 yo <br/>
didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s because 1) he&#39;s 14 and 2) it&#39;s part of his personality.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter never had assigned chores. And if I asked her for help, <br/>
even something easy like folding towels, when she was younger it was <br/>
like she was being asked to climb Mt. Everest. But when she was 11, she <br/>
started noticing things that needed done. She&#39;d carry groceries in and <br/>
help me put them away. And now at 13 she asks several times a day if <br/>
there&#39;s any help I need.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Laundry chores used to be shared between Ds and<br/>
&gt; myself, pre-RU times, but now they have evolved to be almost<br/>
&gt; exclusively mine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about inviting her to keep you company? Have conversations. Tell <br/>
stories. If she reads, ask if there&#39;s something she might like to read <br/>
to you. Listen to a book on tape together.<br/>
<br/>
My mother had a lot of chores when she was a kid and was determined not <br/>
to do that to my sister and me. But what she did was divide the world <br/>
into adult work and children&#39;s play. She never invited us into her <br/>
world to help or spend time with her. And then later when we were teens <br/>
and she resented us not helping it didn&#39;t (in the midst of my teenage <br/>
surliness) make sense to me. She&#39;d done it all before and now all of a <br/>
sudden she needed help?<br/>
<br/>
So invite them to help. Invite them to keep you company. Tasks are <br/>
often more pleasant when done together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m considering making a list for the refrigerator, a public posting<br/>
&gt; so-to-speak.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How would it feel if your husband put up one for you? Full of things <br/>
that you felt were his -- like mowing or paying the bills or getting a <br/>
job -- or were not worth the time taken away from the things you <br/>
thought were important like scrubbing the garage floor?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She is constantly asking for help finding things<br/>
&gt; because she is one of those creative types who leaves her creations<br/>
&gt; and treasures scattered about the house as she moves from one project<br/>
&gt; to the next.  Along with her creations are the excess materials and<br/>
&gt; tools she uses to make them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. Sounds like Kathryn at that age :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She also scatters her clothing, shoes,<br/>
&gt; books and anything else she picks up and moves to another spot<br/>
&gt; throughout the day. Along with this, she also requests that I HELP<br/>
&gt; her change clothes, brush teeth, wash face, take a bath, go to sleep<br/>
&gt; (we cosleep), wipe her tush and many other every day tasks that the<br/>
&gt; majority of 7-1/2 year olds are usually competent in and willing to<br/>
&gt; do for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, and all that too even the bum wiping. It&#39;s just who she is.<br/>
<br/>
At 13 Kathryn can do all that herself but she still likes company.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds harsh but it&#39;s often helpful to think &quot;What if this were her <br/>
last day on Earth? What if tomorrow all this stuff that brings her joy <br/>
would be put away never to come out again?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about organizing things for her? Don&#39;t expect it to last! But look <br/>
for a sensible system that would make things easier for you to put <br/>
away. Papers were the bane of my existence ;-) (I swear she must have <br/>
gone through 2 big cartons of paper.) I put a box near where she drew <br/>
and tossed the drawing in there when I cleaned up. All her notebooks <br/>
share space on the shelf with the DVDs because that&#39;s where she does <br/>
all her drawing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627452433">Ditto to what Joyce said about finding a workable organization <br/>
system - even if it just means plastic bins in each room that you <br/>
toss her stuff into as you go about the day (if she&#39;s moved on from <br/>
the) - that way all her stuff is contained and it&#39;s easier to look <br/>
in 3 or 4 bins than to have to check floors, under couches and <br/>
cushions, in cubby holes, etc. We&#39;ve got bins of all sorts all over <br/>
the place. If I walk by the couch on the way to something and spot <br/>
Spiderman sitting on the back of the couch, with DS nowhere insight, <br/>
I grab Spidey and pop him into the nearest suitable bin. (a) Spidey <br/>
is safe from predation by the dogs (b) he is findable again when he <br/>
is needed (c) the couch remains usable without risking bruised buns <br/>
from sitting on action figures (a big risk for DS who, at just about <br/>
7, still prefers au naturel to clothing much of the time). Rather <br/>
than having to do big cleanups, most of the time we use the &#39;drip&#39; <br/>
method - pick up along the way in bits and overall things stay tidy.<br/>
<br/>
With DS, too, we&#39;ve found that if we simply ask him to keep us <br/>
company (which he tends to prefer anyhow - he prefers to play in <br/>
whatever room us grownups are in), eventually he pitches in to help. <br/>
For instance, we just got a new dresser for our room (hand me down <br/>
from friends - free is good!) So, that initiated a major overhaul of <br/>
drawers and closet space (okay closet isn&#39;t completed yet, we&#39;re <br/>
getting there...lol). DH and I set about sorting out stuff that was <br/>
stashed in the back of drawers and needed to (a) be thrown out - <br/>
like old, ripped, single socks (b) given away - like the size medium <br/>
t shirts that I&#39;ll never wear again but are still in good shape (c) <br/>
moved to the other dresser - my stuff moved to the new dresser, DH&#39;s <br/>
stuff got distributed between the two small dressers we had been <br/>
using. We started sorting, DS was zooming about playing. As he <br/>
zoomed by, oneor the other of us might ask him to bring an item to <br/>
or from one place to another in his trajectory. No problems with <br/>
that, just added to his game. Then he decided he would be the <br/>
official delivery person bringing things to and from (the concept of <br/>
an assembly line is a biggie for him these days). So he was taking <br/>
items we indicated to the trash bag, other items to the give away <br/>
basket, and other items to whichever location they needed to go to. <br/>
When he wanted to simply play for a bit, he did. Then again, when DH <br/>
wanted to stop for a minute to watch a bit of TV (Mythbusters was <br/>
on), he did. Same principle.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836109155">Today I had a friend over for breakfast before she had to be at work. This<br/>
meant that I had to get up at 7am about an hour before I usually do. My kids<br/>
usually get up later still.Anyway today my daughter heard me cooking in the<br/>
kitchen and came out and after some time passed I asked if she wanted  to<br/>
empty the dishwasher well, she sure didn&#39;t seem to thrilled to do that. So I<br/>
just started doing it -no problem -I didn&#39;t make her feel bad for not<br/>
feeling like doing that chore, but then she went on to do the kinds of<br/>
things that she does enjoy doing and that she knows needs to be done. She<br/>
did this because she knew I could use the help and that I would appreciate<br/>
her input. She wiped down the table, found a tablecloth to cover it with,<br/>
set the table including going out to the garden to pick a lovely bouquet of<br/>
flowers which I would of never had time to do.<br/>
Anyway I guess my point is that perhaps you and your kids can work out<br/>
together what chores you each like to do. Sometimes my kids don&#39;t do the<br/>
chore I originally wanted help with, but they&#39;ll do something else that<br/>
saves me time or work and its all appreciated. You could all get together<br/>
and you tell your kids what  your problems  are and then open a<br/>
brainstorming session on what can be done to help. Often they come up with<br/>
ideas that are so out of the box and are really great. Just working on<br/>
problems in this fashion can be fun and bring each other closer. Often times<br/>
I found out that they were not aware of any problem and are genuinely eager<br/>
to help out.  Anyway, just having a casual, not blaming anyone, family<br/>
meeting can&#39;t hurt- give it a try.<br/>

basically since DD was born 2 years ago.  I thought it was because of <br/>
that.  I am glad to see he isn&#39;t the only 7 year old who doesn&#39;t like <br/>
to be interupted to help with housework.  I have been gladly accepting <br/>

This is  a very good point.  I tend to do that same kind of division.    <br/>
Housework is THE enemy of playtime.  I need to work on my multi-  <br/>

of it in words before, but I do tricks with  the silverware and my fingers, or <br/>
I think patterns with the glasses and  bowls.  I don&#39;t do it in the same <br/>

clutter of books scattered on the bed for hard surfaces? I know places <br/>
like WalMart have the kind that is a cushion similar to a beanbag <br/>
chair underneath and a smooth hard surface on top (often with a <br/>
shallow border to keep things from rolling off). Several years ago DS <br/>
got a lap desk type thing (like a breakfast in bed tray, with legs on <br/>
either end) that had trays on either side for writing implements and <br/>
whatever else and the top slid open to store paper, stickers, etc. <br/>
That one in particular was designed for use in travel so maybe check <br/>
both the bedroom accessories and the vehicle accessories areas.</div>

house the more opportunity for extra housework.<br/>
The more the other folks in your home think its ok to leave their socks, <br/>
shoes, video games, light sabers, blankets, werewolf mask (yes in the <br/>
living room as we speak), blankets and pillows (left on the floor from <br/>
sleeping out in the living room the night before), ravioli can, fork, <br/>
bowl, the 4 glasses he used to drink out of the day before without <br/>
making any effort to move some of the items back into their proper place <br/>
(I won&#39;t even mention the bacteria experiment that is his bathroom which <br/>
is right off the living room)----well I can see how one might want a <br/>
little help. Then there are all the voices around you are saying that <br/>
they &quot;must do chores&quot; and such.<br/>
I&#39;m way more willing now then I was a few years ago to pick up and clean <br/>
up after Josh because in a lot of ways they are MY issues. He does the <br/>
bathroom sometimes, but I do it more because I care more and would hate <br/>
for a guest to use that bathroom in its natural state. I&#39;ll move his <br/>
stuff back to his room to deal with. If I can&#39;t walk through his room <br/>
I&#39;ll pick up a bit---he really appreciates that and sometimes I think <br/>
the mess gets so big he&#39;s unable to figure out where to start 1st.<br/>
His father is way less forgiving and much more of a &quot;gotta do the <br/>
chores&quot; guy.<br/>
But my biggest fear is that when he grows up and gets married, instead <br/>
of being a man who can clean up after himself like I got from my MIL, he <br/>
will be a guy who thinks his job is to sit on the sofa playing video <br/>
games while his wife cleans up around him. In the end of my nightmare my <br/>
DIL hates me and never lets me see our grandkids lest I infect them with <br/>
the messy gene.<br/>
Of course this is just silly &#39;cause Josh is a helpful and kind guy who <br/>
would probably share household responsibilities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291968770">We all eat in the living room regularly.  When I am headed to the kitchen for whatever reason, I always grab a glass or plate and take it with me.  It&#39;s pretty easy to keep the dishes out of the living room that way, without it feeling like extra work.  I also mention to the kids, if I notice them heading that way, that they might grab a glass and take it to the kitchen on their way.  The do it without complaint if they are on their way.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids also leave a lot of their things on the floor but I&#39;ve found I can&#39;t really say to them, &quot;don&#39;t you care if it gets trashed?&quot;  becuase in reality we are all (excpet dh sometimes, but he&#39;s away on business as much as he is home) very careful of where we step and things can stay on the floor for ages and be just fine when they eventually get back to them.  (maybe with a little dust on them.)<br/>
<br/>
I know some people who had lots of chores as a kid whose houses are always trashed and I know other people who are anal about how clean their houses are, as were their parents.  It probably depends on how your kids see doing chores, as to how they are as an adult with the freedom to do as they choose.  <br/>
<br/>
My own house is fairly cluttered sometimes, very neat for short periods, but generally clean enough to be healthy.  I didn&#39;t have regular chores as a kids, although I was expected to help out now and then when things needed to be done, like help stack wood or help with dishes when the dish washer was broken.  I enjoy a neat house but living an unschooling life and taking the time to follow my interests as well as help my kids follow theirs, doesn&#39;t leave the amount of time it would take to keep my house as neat as I would like it.  It isn&#39;t my first concern nor even my second.  The people I know whose houses are their top priority, over their kids, aren&#39;t really the kind of people I enjoy being around, tbh.</div>

Some of the laziest adults I know were made to do a LOT of chores and heavy  <br/>
yardwork and wood hauling, etc., when they were kids.  And the one who is  THE <br/>
most industrious and concerned about his house and yard and car is the one  <br/>
we used to tease because his mom picked his laundry up and brought it back  <br/>
folded and put it in his drawers for him.<br/>

Anyway, there&#39;s a big genetic component (discovered in studies of adult  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-997830887">I grew up with grandparents with plastic slipcovers<br/>
and a living room in our house that we were not<br/>
allowed in unless accompanied by an adult.  My sister<br/>
was a self-absorbed princess with whom I shared a<br/>
room.  I had one dresser drawer that actually held<br/>
clothes (the rest had my collections of interesting<br/>
stuff) and a bed that probably had one leg off the<br/>
ground from covering most of my other interesting<br/>
stuff.  I never had chores but I was constantly<br/>
hounded, criticized and brow-beaten to &#39;clean.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I was a slob.  But I would also have been more<br/>
willing to clean and be helpful if I hadn&#39;t been<br/>
continuously bullied.  As a grown-up-type person, I<br/>
have had phases of Susie Homemaker-ness, including<br/>
cleaning the INSIDE of my vacuum cleaner when I was<br/>
pregnant with my first sweet boy.  Most of the time, I<br/>
put things away in the same places because I have a<br/>
really poor memory.  And I like the kitchen to be free<br/>
of dirty dishes because gnats are annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I&#39;m ok with everyone keeping their<br/>
things as they wish.  If it bugs me, I&#39;ll move it.  If<br/>
it&#39;s a huge mess, I&#39;ll offer to help clean up.  But I<br/>
know from personal experience that sniping, badgering,<br/>
demanding and bossing kill any spirit of cooperation<br/>
or pleasure in accomplishment that a kid might get out<br/>
of doing stuff around the old homestead.<br/>
<br/>
As always, your mileage may vary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224108770">My kids are really nice to me and pretty nice to each other.  They&#39;ll  <br/>
deliver food to their dad in the back or the garage if he&#39;s working, and any of  <br/>
them will bring dirty dishes they pass by as they move through the house.  <br/>
 <br/>
None of my kids cleans toilets.  I bet when they have their own places  <br/>
they&#39;ll clean toilets better than I do.  (That would be a pretty easy  <br/>
accomplishment, as I don&#39;t clean toilets very regularly either, but when I do,  they&#39;re <br/>
CLEAN and then time passes again... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
All of my kids have volunteered or been asked to help unrelated adults do  <br/>
difficult things and have never once been sent away for incompetence or lack of  <br/>
serious.  No one has ever complained about the job my kids did when they  <br/>
helped out with whatever it was---moving, cleaning, cutting, stacking, set-up  <br/>
for card tournaments, babysitting, party set-up, whatever.  <br/>
 <br/>
Kirby showed up at 11:30 last night to go to a movie with Marty and other  <br/>
friends, instead of the 11:00 they had told him to try to do.  That&#39;s the  <br/>
biggest failure of months here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
The movie was at midnight.  He was half an hour early, not the hour  the <br/>
group had decided on.  They were waiting for him in the theatre, so it  wasn&#39;t a <br/>
huge inconvenience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yes, my mother has even used that one on me....&quot;With the kids in <br/>
school, you would have more time to take care of the house and <br/>
yourself.&quot;  I told her I would not send the kids to school just so I <br/>
could clean and exercise. I don&#39;t find either to be as appealing as <br/>
being with my kids&lt;g&gt;, and it&#39;s just not worth it. Besides, my MIL, <br/>
whose house was always &quot;chaotic&quot; until the last of her 4 kids moved <br/>
out told me that now, &quot;It&#39;s nice and clean, but it&#39;s soooo quiet. <br/>
It&#39;s too quiet.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Another observation I made since moving to FL is that so many of the <br/>
retired folks down here have WHITE everything---white cars, white <br/>
rugs, white couches, white cabinets,etc. Over the years we&#39;ve been <br/>
fortunate to receive alot of secondhand furnishings and such from my <br/>
parents friends, but usually in white! Our friends comment on <br/>
our &quot;fine&quot; furnishings and I always say, &quot;yes, but I never would <br/>
have picked white with  3 kids, a cat, and a dog in the house.&quot;  <br/>
Many of the older folks down here will also look longingly at our <br/>
kids and say things like, &quot;S/He looks just like my grandkid up <br/>
north, but I haven&#39;t seen him/her since.....&quot; or &quot;My son used to <br/>
have hair just like that.&quot; If I get frustrated with the mess, I <br/>
remind myself I would rather have my kids around me than white <br/>
cabinets. I&#39;m not really eager for those &quot;white cabinet days&quot;. I <br/>
think these days are much more fun, at least they can be if I let <br/>
them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075788995"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hello,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is my first post to the group, although I&#39;ve been reading <br/>
enthusiastically for a while.  I feel compelled by the topic, because <br/>
in our home we seem to be seeking a slightly elusive balance between <br/>
relaxed living and home comforts - some days all is harmonious, but <br/>
then some days when we can&#39;t find the particular fairy we are looking <br/>
for, or the baby&#39;s favorite bedtime book, a favorite skirt, etc, it is <br/>
less than harmonious.  We don&#39;t have assigned chores, and with three <br/>
kids (dd6,dd4 and ds1) all very creative and active, and two adults, it <br/>
is a challenge sometimes to stay on top of the things that make a home <br/>
comfortable and livable, while still enjoying our day (and avoiding <br/>
some of that resentment that can pop up occasionally).<br/>
<br/>
We are unschooling ourselves, though, and the miracle of unschooling is <br/>
that it tends to make us think about how we do EVERYTHING, and see if <br/>
there is a different way to approach it - wow, didn&#39;t realize we&#39;d be <br/>
doing that two years ago when we started this journey!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there are a few little things that I&#39;ve been doing differently <br/>
lately, that have helped and reduced the possible frustration factor, <br/>
so I thought I&#39;d share in case it might help someone out there.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Harnessing Periods of Natural Energy - wow, this one might sound <br/>
like a no-brainer, but just recently I realized that I was totally <br/>
defeating myself.  Every day I would say &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll clean up that mess <br/>
after the kids are asleep for the night.&quot;  Doing everything at night <br/>
was a long-time habit from working out of the home for many years.  <br/>
Well, I am naturally a morning person, and after I nurse and cuddle <br/>
everyone to sleep at night, the cleaning rarely happens since I&#39;m <br/>
usually asleep too.  So recently I just started to try and tackle some <br/>
of the necessary things during the morning, a totally different <br/>
approach, and it has worked really well - I am less likely to be trying <br/>
to clean up when I am tired and uninterested, and it also helps because <br/>
the kids are generally in a pretty calm mood at that time of day too, <br/>
so they are fine with me doing a few things.  For some folks, the <br/>
opposite might hold true, and they might be better able to sort their <br/>
Polly Pocket/Bionicle pieces at midnight, but using whatever time frame <br/>
you have more energy might help avoid the frustration factor and <br/>
grumbliness.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Following Our Path Through the House - we seem to have a meandering <br/>
path through the house throughout the course of the day, from breakfast <br/>
table to tv/play area, to bathroom to bedroom for naps, and back again. <br/>
  Recently, I decided that I would just try to do a few things as we use <br/>
each room, so that the room would be a little bit better than when we <br/>
started (not perfect mind you, just a tiny little bit better).  The <br/>
little bits and pieces that I can put away in a minute here or there <br/>
really add up throughout the day, and again, that frustration factor <br/>
seems reduced.  I think for me a lot of the frustration comes from a <br/>
lack of control and a sense that the mess is too much to handle at one <br/>
time (especially if company is coming soon).  Chipping away at it all <br/>
day gives a sense of progress that can be encouraging.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Scooch and Clean - Basically what I have been doing lately is <br/>
following the baby around the house (in addition to number 2 above), <br/>
and wherever he cruises, scooches or crawls, that is where I sit and <br/>
and play with him (and whoever else tends to join, since usually one of <br/>
the big sisters will join in wherever we are) and organize whatever <br/>
stuff is in that area while we play.  Sometimes the area ends up <br/>
messier than when we started, since everyone gets interested in what <br/>
there is to play with, but like someone said, that&#39;s what you clean up <br/>
for anyway, so that they can have their things available to play with <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Again, we don&#39;t have chores, and while I will ask the girls to help <br/>
occasionally, I feel that they absorb a lot by example; if I can manage <br/>
our environment in a way that does not feel stressful, they will <br/>
hopefully also learn to manage their own environment in a healthy and <br/>
happy way.<br/>

This is a great idea.  I&#39;ve always wondered how to describe it.   You&#39;re <br/>
simply being present with your children, maybe getting something done at  the same <br/>
time, and interacting with them as need be.  This is what I want  to tell the <br/>
people who have littles that fight each other all the time.   Sit down on the <br/>
floor where they are.  Be there next to them.  Just be  present.<br/>
 <br/>
Your whole post was good.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602861675">Funny you should bring this up. Until the beginning of June, I had the kids <br/>
on a rotating dish schedule. Three kids, so that each kid got to do dishes <br/>
every third day. (regardless of whose day it was, I did the dishes at least <br/>
once every day, simply because I would want them out of my way to do <br/>
something in the itsy bitsy kitchen. which is to say, no one had to do a <br/>
whole entire day&#39;s worth. But they were on a schedule)<br/>
<br/>
Hm. Funny thing. None of them ever did the dishes voluntarily for either <br/>
their sibs, or me. None of them ever did other chores on their own <br/>
initiative, though all of them are good about pitching in when it&#39;s pick up <br/>
time...YOU know, when the clutter gets freaky and it&#39;s JUST TIME to pick <br/>
up...<br/>
<br/>
Well, about the beginning of June I noticed, though the dishes were getting <br/>
done, other things like wiping off the countertops or stove top, or sweeping <br/>
the floor, were neglected. I never asked them to do those things, that&#39;s not <br/>
the point. The point is, though the dishes were getting done, the kitchen <br/>
wasn&#39;t getting cleaned. And so, I took over &quot;the dishes&quot; entirely, and the <br/>
kitchen got cleaned every day, and I was happy. I did tell the kids &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
taking over everyone&#39;s dishes. If you see other things that need doing, <br/>
please feel free to do them.&quot; but didn&#39;t hand out any other chores or <br/>
schedule them for anything. And, they didn&#39;t take on any new chores! LOL <br/>
silly me.<br/>
<br/>
So, I kept up with the kitchen, and picked up &quot;the big chunks&quot; around the <br/>
house, without comment, keeping in mind the FlyLady mantra &quot;Even housework <br/>
done imperfectly, blesses the family.&quot; And last night, I went to bed with <br/>
dirty dishes in the sink, a cluttered front room, and three alert, <br/>
wide-awake kids. In fact, the 12 and the 10 year olds told me they were <br/>
going to clean their rooms. I asked them to keep it as quiet as possible, <br/>
and went to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
When I got up this morning: the dishes are done! the front room is picked <br/>
up! and the laundry has been advanced by two loads! including folding! What <br/>
a blessing. I didn&#39;t ask anyone to do any of it, though I did point out the <br/>
dishes to my oldest, who took her nose out of her costume mending long <br/>
enough to say &quot;g&#39;night.&quot; All that&#39;s left for me to do is bathrooms, and <br/>
clearing off the table, and sweep the floors. Isn&#39;t that COOL? :) Cool kids, <br/>
mine.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>
