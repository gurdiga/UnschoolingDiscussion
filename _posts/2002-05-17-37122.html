<div id="ygrps-yiv-956098266">Hi all:<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your suggestions. We&#39;ve already read as many of the<br/>
Redwall books as we can handle--they start seeming too much alike after a<br/>
while. My older son loved THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN when he was about<br/>
that age, but my younger one is fixated on the animal adventures at the<br/>
moment. I think it&#39;s because it is less threatening to him if something bad<br/>
happens to one of the characters.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t think of BEN AND ME and MR REVERE AND I, since I<br/>
carry them in the store. There is another one about Columbus&#39; dog, too.<br/>
Perfect solutions, thanks once again.<br/>
<br/>
