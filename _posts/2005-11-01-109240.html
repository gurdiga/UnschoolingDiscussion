<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132185716">I really appreciate that this list exists.  I appreciate that the <br/>
owners and other long-time unschoolers are so generous with their <br/>
time, their knowledge and experience, that they are willing to answer <br/>
so many questions, over and over again, in a thousand slightly <br/>
different ways.  I am grateful that an easy forum exists, for free, <br/>
where we can gather and store so much useful information about <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Something that I have seen again and again, between the lines of the <br/>
messages here, is the emotional process that most people go through, <br/>
on their way into unschooling.  (I am a therapist/life-coach, and so <br/>
the inner journey is always the part that speaks the loudest to me.)  <br/>
There is so much that this list offers to people to people in this <br/>
process.  This is a place to find new ideas, a place to have mistaken <br/>
beliefs challenged, a place where harmful patterns are exposed.  This <br/>
creates an opportunity to replace old ways of thinking with new ones <br/>
that are more conducive to the trust, freedom and joy that so many of <br/>
us experience (or want to experience) as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
What is missing from this list (and there is no way to add it, this <br/>
is not a complaint but an observation), is the real human tender <br/>
connection that most people need when they are doing the work of re-<br/>
evaluating, exposing old wounds, and committing to a new way of <br/>
life.  To move from the belief that children cannot be trusted, that <br/>
learning only happens when forced and that children are not full <br/>
human beings  to a place of trust in the inner selves of our <br/>
children (not to mention ourselves, and all people) requires a deep <br/>
shift in our psyche.  In my experience, this shift is simply not <br/>
possible without going through all kinds of emotional pain and <br/>
struggle, and I have seen countless messages on this list testify to <br/>
this fundamental reality. <br/>
<br/>
This new birth  of unschooling- requires a labor of sorts, and what <br/>
I want to say here is that laboring women need midwives.  There is a <br/>
lot we can do to learn about birth  new ideas, good suggestions, <br/>
information that helps us understand birth  all of this intellectual <br/>
work can help women immensely.  But when the real labor pain hits, <br/>
all the &quot;facts&quot; of the situation are of no help at all, in comparison <br/>
to the midwife who looks at us in the eyes, wipes our brow, and holds <br/>
our hand.<br/>
<br/>
I want new unschoolers (and all of us) to understand, that as <br/>
wonderful and irreplaceable as this list is for providing a place to <br/>
discuss and learn about unschooling, it is not a replacement for the <br/>
real-life emotional support that most (if not all) of us need on this <br/>
journey.<br/>
<br/>
When I read new unschoolers questions, I can&#39;t help but hear the <br/>
anguish behind their words.  I want to reach out to them, to hold <br/>
them while they cry, to listen to their hearts speak, to comfort <br/>
their fears and release their shame.  But this is a yahoo list, a <br/>
computer screen, a series of 1s and 0s that does an amazing job of <br/>
communicating thoughts around the world.  It really is not the forum <br/>
for touching skin to skin, or wiping away tears.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where to tell new unschoolers to go for this kind of <br/>
emotional support.  Maybe you will be lucky and have a best friend, <br/>
sibling or parent, who fully understands your struggle and will <br/>
support you along the way.  Maybe you will find a therapist who <br/>
understands unschooling and who will midwife you through your <br/>
emotional process to your new life.  I have seen advertisements for <br/>
unschooling-friendly therapists in *Life Learning* magazine, and <br/>
perhaps they could be a wonderful resource for a phone connection.  <br/>
<br/>
I often see people try to overcome emotional struggle using <br/>
intellectual rigor.  Sometimes that works.  But if you are someone <br/>
who is in emotional struggle, and if the answers on this list aren&#39;t <br/>
helping you get to the bottom of your pain, I want you to know that <br/>
this is neither because of your or the list&#39;s failure.  It is because <br/>
you need something that this list doesn&#39;t (and never claimed to) <br/>
provide.   I encourage you to find someone who will be your midwife <br/>
at your side, as you give birth to something precious and wonderful.  <br/>
<br/>
In the end, I think you&#39;ll find that the labor was worth it.</div>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It still would be &quot;just a list,&quot; but maybe you could make a list specifically <br/>
for the purpose of emotional support and for letting people tell their school <br/>
stories and get it all out.   <br/>
<br/>
At the Live and Learn conference recently a dad talked to me for a while <br/>
about Twelve Step program issues.   He had been to a conference where drug-rehab <br/>
counsellors were, and saw the version of the Certificate of Empowerment that <br/>
the author of the Procovery book has used (it&#39;s been on her website for many <br/>
years, and that&#39;s cool--she made good use of it).   He was talking to some of his <br/>
fellow counsellors about whether I might have come from a recovery <br/>
background, from clues in things he knew of my writing.<br/>
<br/>
I did go to Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings for four years, from when I <br/>
was childless up to when Marty was one or so.   In there I also went to some <br/>
AA meetings with my mom, when she didn&#39;t want to go alone, or when she got a <br/>
coin/token, or it was too snowy to drive home and come back to get her.   So I <br/>
saw a few of the really hardcore meetings that AA can be.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that bears a similarity between a type of advice there and here is <br/>
that the harmful things need to be ceased.    If someone comes here and says <br/>
&quot;When we finish this curriculum we have, we&#39;re going to think about maybe <br/>
easing into unschooling,&quot; she&#39;s not ready for this list yet.   If she wants to let <br/>
that curriculum go and start unschooling, then we can help her.   Otherwise, <br/>
it would be like someone going to an AA meeting and saying &quot;When my liquor <br/>
cabinet is empty, and after the Christmas and New Year&#39;s parties, I&#39;m going to <br/>
quit drinking, so I would like to come to meetings now and share every week even <br/>
though I&#39;m actively finishing off my Scotch and tequila.<br/>
<br/>
In AA, people usually have sponsors, which is a one-on-one relationship.    <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the kind of sponsors even new unschoolers need might be those <br/>
kinds--other moms at La Leche League, or maybe someone at a group for codependency <br/>
or something like Al-Anon, where people are recovering from substance abuse of <br/>
the parents or other relatives.<br/>
<br/>
Neither this list nor unschooling itself can or should be everything to <br/>
anybody.   Learning from the real world works the same way for adults as for <br/>
children.    Use resources that are out there!   If dumping and reviewing all that <br/>
happened during childhood is what&#39;s needed, find a counsellor who can help you <br/>
look at it in those terms--if your current reactions and   self image are <br/>
still school-based, you should try to clean that internal mess up!   It will make <br/>
a difference.   <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s might be a good idea too, for someone with no local contacts.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe finding a partner and reading through some of what&#39;s already written, <br/>
whether some of Joyce&#39;s very logical answers or my more emotionally-based <br/>
essays, would be helpful too.   <br/>

<br/>
I think some people want all personal exploration without borrowing from <br/>
already-been-there experiences, and that can be slow and frustrating.    <br/>
<br/>
I think some people want all borrowings with no personal exploration, and <br/>
that won&#39;t work.   That&#39;s like reading about the bike riding without getting the <br/>
bike, or reading fifty cookbooks but never turning on the stove, or collecting <br/>
sewing patterns but not ever buying any cloth.   You don&#39;t sew or cook from <br/>
reading.   You don&#39;t unschool or come to trust natural learning from reading.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling starts to make sense when people are unschooling.   It takes some <br/>
reading and some doing, more reading, more doing...<br/>

When I was 12, we were discussing reading and doing in sixth grade. I smartly piped up, &quot;MY mama says that, if you can read, you can do *any*thing!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
My teacher, Mrs. Nuckols, set me straight (and made me question my mother a bit more in the  future) with, &quot;Well, I can read just fine, but I can&#39;t SEW!&quot; &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
That feeling of &quot;duh!&quot; has stayed with me all this time! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Yes, I think this addresses the human need for personal connetion <br/>
(especially when traveling into new sometimes-scary ground) that I <br/>
was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep thinking about how we could establish something like this <br/>
for unschoolers.  I think it&#39;s a great idea.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what all that is--MANY people&#39;s take on it, with very practical things <br/>
to do and try.<br/>
<br/>
When people call me on the phone about homeschooling, often they first want <br/>
to tell me in detail how horrible a kid was treated in school.   I try to cut <br/>
them off and start at the &quot;and now that he&#39;s home...&quot; place.   Partly I just <br/>
don&#39;t want the grief.   Mostly, they need to turn their backs on that and look <br/>
at the now, not the then.<br/>
<br/>
People could (and some do) obsess about mistreatment from the past for weeks, <br/>
months, YEARS, and their whole life is lived in the shadow of that <br/>
frustration they didn&#39;t know how to deal with way back when.   YES some people suck.   <br/>
And a mom who can&#39;t take a deep breath and live in the moment for at least one <br/>
moment is one such sucky person.   And if that one present moment and that one <br/>
deep breath feel good, she will claim another one, and another, until the <br/>
past is far away and not a knot in her stomach making her want to burst into <br/>
tears.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, some review of the past might be necessary, but TOO much review comes <br/>
straight out of today&#39;s sunshine and today&#39;s calm and today&#39;s potential.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I thought for a while last year about starting a Yahoo group for <br/>
unschooling support--deschooling support, really.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get very far with the idea for two reasons. One was that I <br/>
got pregnant and could see that I wasn&#39;t going to have the time to <br/>
look after a group any time soon.<br/>
<br/>
The other is that my thoughts seemed to get very specific about <br/>
exactly what I would like the list to be. Could be a very small <br/>
list, lol. Anyway, in case it sparks interest in someone else, this <br/>
is what I was thinking.<br/>
<br/>
It would be for people who understand the concept of radical <br/>
unschooling and want to get there, but have daily ups and downs, <br/>
sticking points, varying degrees of cooperation from spouses/SO&#39;s, <br/>
etc. I wouldn&#39;t want it to get into the &quot;wherever you are is great, <br/>
that works for my family&quot; grey area. That doesn&#39;t help me keep <br/>
moving toward unschooling/letting go of controls. <br/>
<br/>
There are days when the discussions here and on other groups really <br/>
helps me understand more and move forward. Other days, I know what&#39;s <br/>
right and how I got it wrong and just want to admit my mistakes and <br/>
find the strength to try again.<br/>

I hadn&#39;t really thought about telling our own childhood stories of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If that parental damage is very &quot;massive,&quot; unschooling might not be a good <br/>
idea.   If the parent is so needy herself that she will expect the children to <br/>
make her life bearable, they might be better off in school until she can get it <br/>
together enough to be attentive and fun and able to create a place for them <br/>
to be in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling isn&#39;t for everyone.   Unschooling is for fewer still.<br/>
<br/>
If this were a yachting list and someone came who didn&#39;t believe wind was a <br/>
viable powersource, and her husband didn&#39;t want a yacht, and she lived in <br/>
Montana, and she couldn&#39;t swim, and they couldn&#39;t afford a yacht, how much response <br/>
would be a waste of time?<br/>
<br/>
When someone comes to a list like this and thinks some things have to be <br/>
taught, and that parenting isn&#39;t an issue, and her husband doesn&#39;t understand it a <br/>
bit, and she needs to work full time, I don&#39;t feel obligated to try to get <br/>
her life in order.    Many of the first steps need to be taken elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Being emotionally prepared to own a yacht isn&#39;t even nearly enough.   People <br/>
need to start with a little sailboat and know what they&#39;re doing, and believe <br/>
sails can work, and discover whether they&#39;re the kind of person who can <br/>
operate sails and take care of the equipment and withstand being on a boat for days <br/>
at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Is it &quot;not fair&quot; that some people have yachts and others don&#39;t?   Is it &quot;not <br/>
fair&quot; that the Unsers have race cars when some others in Albuquerque don&#39;t <br/>
have a car at all?   When we&#39;re touching on emotional issues, sometimes there <br/>
comes a wave of &quot;that&#39;s not fair,&quot; and that&#39;s not fair to the list as a whole.<br/>

<br/>
I always thought that Basics filled this function to a great degree. However<br/>
there is a Board at Unschooling.info that is called something like &quot;Support<br/>
for the Child in Us&quot; that would probably be an ideal place for this<br/>
emotional speaking.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I hadn&#39;t really thought about telling our own childhood stories of <br/>

<br/>
People really want to tell their birth stories too a lot of the time. I<br/>
found writing about my mother/childhood was very helpful after she died. I<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If that parental damage is very &quot;massive,&quot; unschooling might not be a good <br/>
idea.   If the parent is so needy herself that she will expect the children to <br/>
make her life bearable, they might be better off in school until she can get it <br/>
together enough to be attentive and fun and able to create a place for them <br/>
to be in the moment.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I would say that would probably depend on the severity of the parent&#39;s ability to control their acting-out on the child.  If there is physical or emotional abuse, I would say school IS a better place for the child.  If the parent is majorly going through emotional turmoil and just has trouble being in the present with the child and has sad or self-loathing feelings that are NOT being taken out on the child, I would say school is way more damaging to the child.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Homeschooling isn&#39;t for everyone.   Unschooling is for fewer still.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right, few can imagine homeschooling and spending all of that time with their children (God forbid!) and never getting any break from them.   Unschooling &lt;gasp&gt; is even more of a leap.  They may actually have to trust their children and relinquish parental controls and expectations. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If this were a yachting list and someone came who didn&#39;t believe wind was a <br/>
viable powersource, and her husband didn&#39;t want a yacht, and she lived in <br/>
Montana, and she couldn&#39;t swim, and they couldn&#39;t afford a yacht, how much response <br/>
would be a waste of time?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, I know what you mean.  They really have to be at least sincere about it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When someone comes to a list like this and thinks some things have to be <br/>
taught, and that parenting isn&#39;t an issue, and her husband doesn&#39;t understand it a <br/>
bit, and she needs to work full time, I don&#39;t feel obligated to try to get <br/>
her life in order.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right, this probably is not the list for trying to find which way to go (i.e. school, homeschool or unschool).  Although, if a person is sincere about unschooling (and actually &quot;gets it&quot;) and truly is just having personal issues coming up, I would&#39;nt say that emotional support should be overlooked or out of the question.  I know what you are saying about reviewing too much is standing in the way of the present or the relationship/good feelings for the child.  The whole goal of unschooling is a wonderful relationship with our children in the present.  I agree that this advanced unschooling list should make and keep that as a priority.  I do think, though that sometimes parenting an unschooled child can bring up past childhood wounds for the parent.   Even though, I&#39;ve found that unschooling is very healing for my own childhood wounds.  It is wonderful to see the happiness in my children&#39;s faces and be present for the love that they eminate.  When I do think back to my own childhood is<br/>
 still does make me sad.  I&#39;m sure that depending on the severity of an abusive childhood it&#39;s something that never totally goes away.  Thus, someone who suffered even worse may have a hard time being in the present if they have unresolved personal issues, despite making a clear commitment to unschooling and unconditional love towards their children.  I remind myself that I am changing my families&#39; legacy and that my children will have the freedom to grow into whomever they want with full support and love from both of their parents.  That in itself is very freeing and helps me be focused in the present.  I think that getting to that place in the beginning is sometime hard for a &quot;needy&quot; parent, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible or necessarily warrants a child having to be put into school.  I know that you did say &quot;might be better off&quot;, so you did leave that open for discression.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Many of the first steps need to be taken elsewhere.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
O.k. but what about the unschooling parent that has been doing it for several years and has emotional baggage beginning to come up?  It may or may not be triggered by certain life&#39;s events or circumstances.  Maybe they&#39;ve realized that the reason that they are having certain problems in certain areas of unschooling is because emotional baggage hasn&#39;t been fully dealt with.  What then?  I just wouldn&#39;t want them to put the kid in school at this point, unless the child is asking to be.  Maybe the parent can be honest and tell the child that mom or dad is having a hard time.  I think honesty is very beneficial at these times.  Children that are shown compassion and understanding, generally can show that in return to a loving parent.  Also, what a great thing for a kid to know that even mom or dad have different emotions coming up every now and then.  And maybe it can be discussed openly and honestly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Being emotionally prepared to own a yacht isn&#39;t even nearly enough.   People <br/>
need to start with a little sailboat and know what they&#39;re doing, and believe <br/>
sails can work, and discover whether they&#39;re the kind of person who can <br/>
operate sails and take care of the equipment and withstand being on a boat for days <br/>
at a time.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Interesting analogy.  I agree parents need to take steps to see if this is the way to go for their families.  The ones that do decide that this is the way to go for may sometimes need to sort things out, in regards to their feelings of the life they have chosen for themselves.  Things come up.  Life happens.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is it &quot;not fair&quot; that some people have yachts and others don&#39;t?   Is it &quot;not <br/>
fair&quot; that the Unsers have race cars when some others in Albuquerque don&#39;t <br/>
have a car at all?   When we&#39;re touching on emotional issues, sometimes there <br/>
comes a wave of &quot;that&#39;s not fair,&quot; and that&#39;s not fair to the list as a whole.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, well right, life IS not fair.  Your commentary is very well thought out and I know that the list is focused on helping unschoolers live better lives.  Part of that may or may not include emotional support for veteran unschooling parents and maybe even on occasion a new, but comitted radical unschooling parent.  I see that you want to keep the exploratory &quot;looky-lou&#39;s&quot; away.  That is a waste of your time.  I understand not wanting to &quot;clutter-up&quot; the list.  You have set up a great arena for other unschoolers to lead happier, care free lives.  Living is the present is key.  Sometimes people faulter emotionally.  The goal should always be happiness and love for our children.  I don&#39;t think that anyone is questioning that.  Maybe emotional struggles can be touched upon, but with a gentle reminder of the avoidance of projecting it on to our children?  That (projecting) is definitely something to be avoided.  I understand that you don&#39;t want to let any parental baggage to take away<br/>
 from the joy and love of our children and that you are in this for the children.  If the parent is able to overcome this (emotional baggage), it just brings more advantages to the child.  The children probably benefit from a parent receiving emotional support from fellow unschoolers.  I know in the interum it may be a bit uncomfortable for the child, but I think if the parent is open and honest and loving, it does not harm and may even be a tool of compassion for another human being.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868324486"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If this were a yachting list and someone came who didn&#39;t believe <br/>

and she lived in Montana, and she couldn&#39;t swim, and they couldn&#39;t <br/>
afford a yacht, how much response would be a waste of time?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a great analogy, and it leads me to admit what I have been <br/>
feeling (as I ponder the idea of starting a different list for the <br/>
emotional process), which is, I just don&#39;t feel like giving away so <br/>
much of my time for free.<br/>
<br/>
I feel embarrassed about saying that here in front of a few thousand <br/>
people, but I think it&#39;s important to say for the purposes of this <br/>
discussion, for several reasons.<br/>
<br/>
First, to acknowledge (again  but I think it bears repeating) how <br/>
much time the leaders on this list give away.  I am grateful for <br/>
their patience, their willingness to answer similar questions over <br/>
and over, to share their own family&#39;s stories and hard-earned <br/>
experience, and for reading and typing thousands and thousands of <br/>
words each month  all for free.<br/>
<br/>
This leads to the issue of &quot;it&#39;s not fair.&quot;  It&#39;s TOTALLY not fair <br/>
that some people have so much pain to sort through if they want to <br/>
successfully and joyfully attain unschooling.   When I read posts <br/>
where it&#39;s obvious that there is a lot of struggle and pain, I feel <br/>
so sad for them, knowing that they have old stuff about authority and <br/>
kids, and that they probably weren&#39;t raised with compassion.  I hate <br/>
that the world is so unfair, and I really really hate that 99.9% of <br/>
the children on this planet bear the brunt of the injustice.  It <br/>
makes me sick, and I actually cry about it often.<br/>
<br/>
However -  this does not mean Sandra (or I, or anyone) has to give <br/>
anything away for free.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that unschooling can be an amazing path to healing.  I <br/>
think that anyone who wants to unschool (or own a yacht) has the <br/>
right and the full potential to do so.  BUT I think that many (if not <br/>
most) people are going to need real-life, day to day, emotional <br/>
support, in order to be able do it. <br/>
<br/>
I would say that Sandra&#39;s analogy would be even more apt if all <br/>
people were born near the water, and the yacht-resisting beliefs <br/>
(like denying wind and the fear to swim) were overwhelmingly common, <br/>
due to a society that pervasively and systematically discouraged and <br/>
shamed yachting from the minute a baby was born.  <br/>
<br/>
If we lived in such a world, everything to do with yachting would be <br/>
fraught with emotion and confusion.  Some people would sort it out by <br/>
sheer brain-power, some people would join with others and sort it out <br/>
together, most people would probably never sort it out at all.  <br/>
<br/>
We do live in a world where human being&#39;s trustworthiness and <br/>
curiosity are systematically discouraged and shamed, and it will take <br/>
a million lifetimes to sort it all out.  I think there is hardly <br/>
anything worth sorting out more, and my life is dedicated to this <br/>
very human process.<br/>
<br/>
But I need to eat and buy toilet paper and pay for health insurance <br/>
too.  And so (I imagine) does Sandra and the other leaders on this <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Being someone who CAN help can be a very excruciating thing, when you <br/>
live among thousands who need you.  Making decisions on whom to help, <br/>
how to help them, when to help them, takes a huge toll on the helpers <br/>
and in fact eventually compromises their ability to help at all.<br/>
<br/>
BUT this does not deny the fact that this kind of help is DESPERATELY <br/>
NEEDED.  So again I urge the new unschoolers who are struggling  <br/>
please!  find yourself someone who values unschooling, to hold your <br/>
hand, hear your stories, and listen to your tears. You need emotional <br/>
support, your children need you to get emotional support, your <br/>
husband needs you to get emotional support, the planet needs you to <br/>
get emotional support. <br/>
<br/>
(I know that last part sounds like a pompous proposition, but I <br/>
happen to think it&#39;s true so I kept it in.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Amy, for articulating all of this SO well.<br/>
<br/>
As someone who has given pretty freely of her time - like Sandra,  <br/>
I&#39;ve made this MY life-work for the past 10 years or so - I  <br/>
appreciate the recognition of the time involved and especially  <br/>
appreciate the recognition that people can&#39;t GIVE everything that  <br/>
everybody needs EVEN when we might be capable of it. That&#39;s a TOUGH one.<br/>
<br/>
My email address and phone number are listed on my state organization  <br/>
website as a homeschooling contact person. I get one to three phone  <br/>
calls per day. Nearly ALL of them are from a desperate emotionally  <br/>
upset very very needy parent. Nearly all of them need to tell me  <br/>
about their problems - nearly all of them have had truly horrible,  <br/>
terrible, life-sucking, traumatic school experiences. Most are  <br/>
hanging onto their belief in their own kids by a very slim thread.  <br/>
Many times they cry, on the phone, just hearing me speaking of their  <br/>
child as a valuable, viable person - I cannot count how many of these  <br/>
parents tell me, &quot;You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve spoken to about my son  <br/>
in YEARS who hasn&#39;t thought of him as &quot;broken&quot; and pretty much not  <br/>
fixable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - I hope people will stop and think about how much time these  <br/>
phone calls take. The person often really truly MUST tell their full  <br/>
and complete story, get it ALL out, before they can take a breath and  <br/>
listen and believe that I understand just how frustrated they are and  <br/>
how they&#39;ve tried everything else and how contacting homeschoolers is  <br/>
a last resort. I know, from experience, that if I don&#39;t listen and  <br/>
make it clear I understand, that they won&#39;t be ready to hear what I  <br/>
have to say. NONE of them have unschooling in mind when they call -  <br/>
they&#39;re just finally at the point of wanting to escape from the  <br/>
school situation. But, many times their child has been seriously hurt  <br/>
by school and it is obvious to ME that they desperately need a  <br/>
lengthy period of deschooling and then unschooling. And these parents  <br/>
are often SO completely and totally angry with the whole school  <br/>
approach that the very idea of unschooling hits them like a ton of  <br/>
bricks and they say things like, &quot;Oh that would be heavenly, I can&#39;t  <br/>
believe I&#39;m hearing you right, this is what I DREAMED of.....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can imagine how gratifying this is.<br/>
<br/>
But you can also imagine how much time it takes and that there are  <br/>
times my own children are standing there, watching me talk on the  <br/>
phone, waiting and waiting and waiting to talk to me or needing me to  <br/>
do something for them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t regret doing this at all. And my kids understand that this is  <br/>
my way of helping the world.<br/>
<br/>
But there has to be balance and we have to set limits. Sometimes  <br/>
there are people I don&#39;t call back because I feel like I&#39;ve said what  <br/>
I could say to them and that the ball needs to be in their court. I  <br/>
KNOW they need far more emotional support than I can provide and I  <br/>
HOPE they find it, but it can&#39;t all come from me, clearly. I always  <br/>
try to help people find a local group and hope they&#39;ll find a friend  <br/>
or two there who can give them the emotional support they need.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a great need for a national network of therapists  <br/>
who support unschooling - I know of one, only, and I do refer people  <br/>
to her very frequently - she does phone, email, and in--person  <br/>
consultations. If someone is looking for a &quot;project,&quot; putting  <br/>
together a list of unschooling-friendly therapists would certainly be  <br/>
a useful one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016304737">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  If the parent is majorly going through emotional turmoil and just has<br/>
trouble being in the present with the child and has sad or self-loathing<br/>
feelings that are NOT being taken out on the child, I would say school is<br/>
way more damaging to the child. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are several issues not being considered in this blanket type<br/>
statement. One is that children have different emotional intelligences, and<br/>
what one child might shrug off and be able to view with detachment, might be<br/>
absorbed and internalized, in a damaging way, by another - both the parent&#39;s<br/>
emotional state and negative school stuff. <br/>
<br/>
The other issue is that there is nothing here about the concept of offering<br/>
the choice to the child, with the freedom to change their mind at any time.<br/>
<br/>
The core of Unschooling *is* &quot;being present&quot; with your children. Jayn<br/>
mirrors my emotional state back to me, no matter how I try not to impose my<br/>
feelings or bad mood on her. I do that by attempting to be really aware of<br/>
my state of mind, but I&#39;m not always fabulous at it. Her mirroring usually<br/>
helps me realize just how much negative projection I am engaging in - and<br/>
I&#39;m not remotely near depressed. Just not &quot;taking it out&quot; on them, doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that the kids aren&#39;t feeling an effect.  <br/>
<br/>
However, nor need &quot;home with miserable mom&quot; vs &quot;being miserable in school&quot;<br/>
be the only options. There might be a free school nearby, there might be<br/>
ways to attend college classes part of the time, there might be the<br/>
possibility of visiting relatives for a brief time, there might be the<br/>
ability to bring someone else into the home situation to help out.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Although, if a person is sincere about unschooling (and actually &quot;gets<br/>
it&quot;) and truly is just having personal issues coming up, I would&#39;nt say that<br/>
emotional support should be overlooked or out of the question. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My experience here and on the sister lists has been that I have received a<br/>
lot of emotional support at different times, when I have posted a problem -<br/>
or as seems to happen in a magical way, someone else posts with a<br/>
commensurate issue just as I was about to! The support happens as a side<br/>
effect of discussing problems of perception. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   I do think, though that sometimes parenting an unschooled child can<br/>
bring up past childhood wounds for the parent.   Even though, I&#39;ve found<br/>
that unschooling is very healing for my own childhood wounds. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We do a *lot* of this kind of conversation on AlwaysUnschooled. We do quite<br/>
a lot of it on Basics. Ren Allen has actually asked for specific stories of<br/>
personal/emotional healing instigated by Unschooling and mindful parenting,<br/>
and revisits the topic periodically on Basics. <br/>
<br/>
There really is a place for people having these emotional struggles as a<br/>
result of discovering Unschooling to share and receive empathy - especially<br/>
if they are looking for reasons to keep Unschooling, rather than a kind of<br/>
permission to drop it because it is too painful. Sometimes people respond to<br/>
pain by getting angry at the others on the lists, as if we caused it by<br/>
opening their minds and hearts to Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It is wonderful to see the happiness in my children&#39;s faces and be<br/>
present for the love that they eminate.  When I do think back to my own<br/>
childhood is still does make me sad. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too - both of those ideas. I see my mother&#39;s family stretching back into<br/>
the ages with a pattern of abuse and severity and unkindness perpetuated. I<br/>
sometimes envision myself as the bulwark holding back a thousand screaming<br/>
monsters with the faces of my mother and my horrid grandfather and his even<br/>
more wretched mother. It stops here.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Maybe the parent can be honest and tell the child that mom or dad is<br/>
having a hard time.  I think honesty is very beneficial at these times. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I tend to think honesty is beneficial at all times.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This is a great analogy, and it leads me to admit what I have been <br/>
feeling (as I ponder the idea of starting a different list for the <br/>
emotional process), which is, I just don&#39;t feel like giving away so <br/>
much of my time for free.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, to acknowledge (again  but I think it bears repeating) how <br/>
much time the leaders on this list give away.  I am grateful for <br/>
their patience, their willingness to answer similar questions over <br/>
and over, to share their own family&#39;s stories and hard-earned <br/>
experience, and for reading and typing thousands and thousands of <br/>
words each month  all for free.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right, I&#39;m not trying to discount what the list owners ALREADY are doing.  That in itself is a huge act of service &lt;g&gt;.  I too appreciate what they share.  It has been tremendously helpful to glean from their experiences.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This leads to the issue of &quot;it&#39;s not fair.&quot;  It&#39;s TOTALLY not fair <br/>
that some people have so much pain to sort through if they want to <br/>
successfully and joyfully attain unschooling.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;m talking about sometimes addressing this when it deems appropriate.  Sometimes it may or may not be appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When I read posts where it&#39;s obvious that there is a lot of struggle and pain, I feel so sad for them, knowing that they have old stuff about authority and kids, and that they probably weren&#39;t raised with compassion.  I hate <br/>
that the world is so unfair, and I really really hate that 99.9% of the children on this planet bear the brunt of the injustice.  It makes me sick, and I actually cry about it often.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I think that it&#39;s very sad also.  And Unfortunately, even if it doesn&#39;t effect us directly.  It does effect our families indirectly.  We are constantly being exposed to it when we go out in &#39;real&#39; life.  As I&#39;ve heard (or read) Sandra say before, our families are a refuge.  That is the gift of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;However -  this does not mean Sandra (or I, or anyone) has to give <br/>
anything away for free.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right, we all have choices.  Sandra and the other list owners have chosen, very unselfishly, to help other unschooling families.  That should definitly be recognized for what they give to others.  I&#39;m not trying to discount that at all and hope that it didn&#39;t come across that way.  I was just talking about maybe occassionally addressing the emotional component of unschooling on occassion.  (Maybe even the sometimes needed brutal honesty of telling someone that therapy might be needed to get over control issues or other stuff and that the list owners are unable to help with so much emotional baggage?)  This may come off as acknowleging that this is beyond what the list owners can emotionally give because this kind of stuff can be so draining and may seem apathetic to the people at times, but being honest about this kind of stuff is admirable and sometimes needs to be told.  And maybe (and probably) it is beyond what can be given in this unschooling list setting.   I guess what I&#39;m<br/>
 saying is that a parent&#39;s emotional baggage should be acknowlegded and encouraged to heal by whatever means that are available.  This &#39;review&#39; and acknowledgement often leads to healed parents and happier children.....the very goal of this list.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I do think that unschooling can be an amazing path to healing.  I <br/>
think that anyone who wants to unschool (or own a yacht) has the <br/>
right and the full potential to do so.  BUT I think that many (if not <br/>
most) people are going to need real-life, day to day, emotional <br/>
support, in order to be able do it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Some people would sort it out by <br/>
sheer brain-power, some people would join with others and sort it out <br/>
together, most people would probably never sort it out at all.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s the current dilema for ru&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We do live in a world where human being&#39;s trustworthiness and <br/>
curiosity are systematically discouraged and shamed, and it will take <br/>
a million lifetimes to sort it all out.  I think there is hardly <br/>
anything worth sorting out more, and my life is dedicated to this <br/>
very human process.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As are all of the list owners on this board.  That is a given.  The emotional aspect is an intrinsic part of the whole picture and may not always be addressed enough as the &quot;root&quot; of some of the problems faced by unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But I need to eat and buy toilet paper and pay for health insurance <br/>
too.  And so (I imagine) does Sandra and the other leaders on this <br/>
list.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right, I don&#39;t think anyone wants any of the list owner&#39;s to sacrafice so much that they have nothing left over for their own families.  Maybe just the integration of addressing self-exploration and healing of parental baggage.  Maybe the concern is that this may seem too overt or as a personal attack?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Being someone who CAN help can be a very excruciating thing, when you <br/>
live among thousands who need you.  Making decisions on whom to help, <br/>
how to help them, when to help them, takes a huge toll on the helpers <br/>
and in fact eventually compromises their ability to help at all.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right, I&#39;m sure that is tough and I cannot imagine.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;BUT this does not deny the fact that this kind of help is DESPERATELY <br/>
NEEDED.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my point exactly!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So again I urge the new unschoolers who are struggling  <br/>
please!  find yourself someone who values unschooling, to hold your <br/>
hand, hear your stories, and listen to your tears. You need emotional <br/>
support, your children need you to get emotional support, your <br/>
husband needs you to get emotional support, the planet needs you to <br/>
get emotional support. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
lol, YES!  Maybe the support in person is best, but a little acknowlegdment online couldn&#39;t hurt either.  Kind of like maybe someone with a similiar past experience of that particular issue can share.  That kind of sharing can be eye-opening for the person with the emotional baggage.  I personally have heard from people who need help with this and say that there is a great need for this. Heck, and I&#39;m no where nearly as experienced as the list owners with a ton of unschooling life experience, lol.  So yes, there is a huge need for addressing parental emotional baggage, especially when I see other new unschoolers asking me a lot of questions, lol.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;(I know that last part sounds like a pompous proposition, but I <br/>
happen to think it&#39;s true so I kept it in.)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If might be possible to design a list for that purpose, though, and those who <br/>
can handle helping others process could do that until they get tired of it <br/>
and they can leave the list&#39;s work to others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But part of the deal here is that it doesn&#39;t HAVE to be &quot;unschooling <br/>
friendly.&quot;   If someone has deep, serious childhood scars, there are probably <br/>
already-existing help groups for that.   If the parents were substance abusers or <br/>
abusive, or if the person is deep into codependent behavior, or if it&#39;s to discuss <br/>
dysfunctional families or the effects of divorce, there is already a huge <br/>
body of literature and therapy and self-help out there.   Unschooling lists can&#39;t <br/>
become all of that, nor should they.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s an after-effect of curriculum or religion for people to expect <br/>
to have all their needs met by some one place or group or thing.   <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, learning from the real world, from the whole world, from all <br/>
possible sources, should be the LAST &quot;place or group or thing&quot; to consider trying <br/>
to provide it all for its &quot;members.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not a church that needs an outreach program for this, and a therapy <br/>
group for that, and a women&#39;s menopause Sunday school class and daycare and a <br/>
softball team and a girl scout troop and...<br/>
<br/>
There are all those things in the real world.   We can just focus on the <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There have been times when my helping others has kept me from being with my <br/>
kids.   I&#39;ve been on the phone with some distraught mom when one of them needs <br/>
me and I&#39;ve asked my kid to wait.   Overall, though, they know that their <br/>
lives are already pretty sweet and some other kid&#39;s life might have gone from crap <br/>
to better, which is a pretty big jump.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s concern OR attack.   I&#39;m not worried about this <br/>
emotional-support discussion at all.   I do think that the articles on deschooling <br/>
and the recommendations about saying yes to children instead of no are <br/>
therapeutic in and of themselves.  Recovery is not and should not be something thought <br/>
of as a whole body of work which must be done before the next step.   It&#39;s <br/>
something ongoing.   If a person is too screwed up and wounded to take care of <br/>
another person&#39;s 24-hour-a-day needs, then something should be done THERE, not <br/>
here.   A child can&#39;t be put on the shelf and picked up again in a year or two <br/>
when the mom&#39;s therapy is done.   They need mom NOW.   <br/>
<br/>
Years back, therapy was a deep analysis of all childhood memories and <br/>
experiences, along with analysis of what the parental background was.   That <br/>
benefited Freudian   therapists more than it benefited their patients.    They were <br/>
learning a LOT that they could use as therapists, but the patients were just <br/>
wallowing in dredged up memories and not getting much in the way of practical <br/>
advice about what to do in the midst of those years of psychoanalysis.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays a much better idea is cognitive therapy--changing how we see the <br/>
world, and how we see ourselves in it, and living in a healthier and more hopeful <br/>
and productive way.   &quot;Here&#39;s what you might try between now and next week&quot; <br/>
is not something Freudian or Jungian analysts were prone to say, unless it was <br/>
a recommendation of how to dredge up or mine more history of pain and <br/>
suffering.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Being someone who CAN help can be a very excruciating thing, when you<br/>

<br/>
I disagree.<br/>
Being someone who can help and doing so for free means getting to choose <br/>
one&#39;s method and approach.   Even those in private practice (as opposed to those <br/>
who have contracted to provide services through an agency with its own <br/>
established mission statement and methods) can choose their own methods and <br/>
approaches, even if they&#39;re charging big bucks to do it.   <br/>
<br/>
What I do is helping anyone who comes across it.   I don&#39;t need to collect <br/>
names or statistics.   If I write an article or collect cool writings of others <br/>
and make them available for people to read when and if they want to, that is a <br/>
way to help people in which the &quot;when&quot; is up to them, and it doesn&#39;t take a <br/>
huge toll on me. (And usually the writing is therapeutic for me at the same <br/>
time.)   <br/>
<br/>
If I speak at a conference and 25 people or 150 people are in the room, maybe <br/>
only five or ten are really helped, but that&#39;s really not even between me and <br/>
them.   I was doing a dance (metaphorically speaking &lt;g&gt;) and telling some <br/>
jokes and maybe something will become the catalyst for a change they didn&#39;t even <br/>
know they needed to make, the the area of memory or recovery or understanding <br/>
or inspiration.    I agreed to perform, they chose to attend, some weren&#39;t <br/>
really listening or didn&#39;t need what I was saying, some were listening just to fi<br/>
nd something to hate, but a few maybe DID benefit.<br/>
<br/>
What has really pissed me off a few times is someone coming to a forum or <br/>
discussion list and going off because others won&#39;t give her exactly what she <br/>
THINKS she wants exactly the way she thinks she needs it.   I&#39;ve been insulted a <br/>
dozen times or more on the charge that I probably am a big fraud, saying I&#39;m <br/>
patient with my kids because I&#39;m not treating some random e-mailer the way I <br/>
would treat my own child.<br/>
<br/>
#1, the random e-mailer is NOT my child<br/>

some maturity<br/>

<br/>
I have NO obligation to adopt everyone who comes by and treat her as my own <br/>

Making decisions on whom to help, how to help them, when to help <br/>
them, can take a huge toll on the helpers and in fact can eventually <br/>
compromise their ability to help at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll just say that it HAS compromised my own ability to help at <br/>
times.  Sometimes I get so tired of hearing everyone&#39;s pain that I <br/>
just want to put my hands over my ears and run away with <br/>
a &quot;LALALALA&quot;.  Sometimes I even swear at people in my head, and then <br/>
it&#39;s pretty clear that I&#39;m not being terribly helpful any more.<br/>
<br/>
To get back to &quot;emotional support for new unschoolers&quot; my point is<br/>
<br/>
1.the journey to unschooling can be a rough one<br/>
2.this doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not worth taking<br/>
3.it does mean you might need emotional help<br/>
4.and you might have to pay for it.<br/>

being overly drained by other people- lots of her help is by writing  <br/>
articles and those get read and people deal with their own reactions  <br/>
to them and she isn&#39;t really part of that (although some people feel  <br/>
the need, I know, to share, so they do write to her). Somewhat true  <br/>
about speaking to groups, too.<br/>
<br/>
And on the list, we made it as clear as we possibly could what this  <br/>
list is for - it is truly intended to be for &quot;discussion&quot; and not for  <br/>
other kinds of &quot;support&quot; - medical, emotional, healing from abuse,  <br/>
divorce counseling, etc. Some people GET al lot of support through  <br/>
that discussion and some people make connections with people and talk  <br/>
offlist. That&#39;s great, but it IS a side-effect of the list - not the  <br/>
list&#39;s real purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I feel less protected because take a lot of phone calls and that  <br/>
person-to-person stuff is FAR more heartrending and, therefore,  <br/>
draining than any of my other work. I recently took my name OFF of  <br/>
the Los Angeles County area because I was feeling overwhelmed and not  <br/>
able to help the people I talked to as much as I had been able to  <br/>
before. So now I&#39;m a contact just for my own, smaller, county.<br/>
<br/>
So - if that&#39;s what Amy meant, then I&#39;ve also felt this way. Amy, we  <br/>
probably just need to learn how better to balance what we do - I  <br/>
don&#39;t think it is inevitable, do you?<br/>

*****People who want to be told, &quot;That&#39;s okay. What ever works for your family... And yes! You are unschooling!&quot; That poo-poohing kind of thing isn&#39;t helpful, isn&#39;t therapeutic, isn&#39;t working toward a better life and relationship with a child. I have not been back for long, but I do remember seeing that kind of needful, wanting, demanding post many times in the past. And Sandra&#39;s right. Many times that person would do a virtual stomp and fit throwing, calling her, Pam, Joyce, or whom ever out. In the end, that person didn&#39;t get help and others on the list who might have benefited didn&#39;t either. <br/>

<br/>
I think some of us feel well qualified to discuss how unschooling works <br/>
in happy families, but not necessarily well qualified to discuss <br/>
personal transformation from unhappiness and oppression to happiness and <br/>
freedom. (We can hold up roadsigns that point out the destination, but I <br/>
don&#39;t know if we can build a railroad that carries people the whole <br/>

licensing).  (It&#39;s a little inconsistent, but that&#39;s how I feel.)<br/>
<br/>
**Kind of like maybe someone with a similiar past experience of that <br/>
particular issue can share.**<br/>
<br/>
OK, yes, peer to peer counseling can often be valuable *when* <br/>
experiences have been similar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900099153">**People who want to be told, &quot;That&#39;s okay. What ever works for your <br/>
family... And yes! You are unschooling!&quot; That poo-poohing kind of thing <br/>
isn&#39;t helpful, isn&#39;t therapeutic, isn&#39;t working toward a better life and <br/>
relationship with a child. I have not been back for long, but I do <br/>
remember seeing that kind of needful, wanting, demanding post many times <br/>
in the past. And Sandra&#39;s right. Many times that person would do a <br/>
virtual stomp and fit throwing, calling her, Pam, Joyce, or whom ever <br/>
out. In the end, that person didn&#39;t get help and others on the list who <br/>
might have benefited didn&#39;t either.**<br/>
<br/>
Right.  Some people (posting here in the past) clearly are craving <br/>
unconditional love and acceptance and total approval of their parenting <br/>
style.  I understand that this would be a wonderful soothing balm.    <br/>
But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s appropriate for this list to dispense <br/>
unconditional approval. <br/>
<br/>
The list might express the idea -- &quot;Yes, we all have bad days and <br/>
sometimes say things we regret&quot; but no one is going to get the message <br/>
&quot;Your parenting is fine the way it is and we will never ask you to <br/>
improve it.&quot;  (Not if they came here posting about conflict with their <br/>
children and tears and punishment.  I think people who ask for help <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be surprised at the implication that they need help and that <br/>
other people believe they have ideas that might improve on their current <br/>
behavior.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704568814">I recommend the folder in the &lt;unschooling.info/forum&gt; message boards  <br/>
called: &quot;Support for the Child in Us.&quot;<br/>
I updated the description a little, here it is:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A place to find people who understand the difficulties and special  <br/>
challenges some of us might face because of our own childhood  <br/>
experiences. A good place to talk over the issues of growing up  <br/>
without parents who understood us. Help in dealing with emotions that  <br/>
arise in ourselves as we unschool our children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Does that seem to be what some are thinking would be useful?<br/>

as: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re kids will be fine - children are resilient,&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;As long as you&#39;re doing your best, don&#39;t beat yourself up,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Just do what works best for your family.&quot; And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Never could figure out a way to make it work!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I deal with people on the phone I do cut off the school stories, because <br/>
I&#39;ve found that they might only have a few minutes to talk, or even if they <br/>
seem to have lots of time I might not, or they might get a young child needing <br/>
attention, or whatnot.    I try to get them to start at the what to do <br/>
tomorrow part, unless ie&#39;s early morning.   If it&#39;s morning I suggest she could to <br/>
and get the child and bring him home.    If it&#39;s afternoon, I say &quot;He doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to go back tomorrow.   He never has to go back.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
I recommend that she just bring him home while she researches options, and <br/>
recommend strongly that she not spend any money whatsoever for a while, and let <br/>
her know that in New Mexico she has thirty after the establishment of a <br/>
homeschool in which to register and that she could take a week or two to decide <br/>
whether she wants to establish a homeschool.   <br/>
<br/>
Cheering her up and giving her something really positive to do that very day <br/>
seems more helpful than letting her tell me her school problem.   Because no <br/>
matter WHAT the school problem, the other realities are the same.   The kid can <br/>
stay home starting right then, and she should do more research and   she has <br/>
a free month and some of no legal obligations at all.<br/>
<br/>
Some people want to wait a few weeks to bring the child home.   If schools&#39; <br/>
really that bad, she should bring him home while she thinks about it.    An <br/>
hour spent talking about how bad school can be with someone like me won&#39;t really <br/>
help.   It will just be a hour during which she&#39;s not with her child, and I&#39;m <br/>
not with mine, and her kid is... somewhere.<br/>

Somone who needs a railroad built isn&#39;t likely to get there before the kids <br/>
