<div id="ygrps-yiv-716009084">That&#39;s so funny you should mention the, &#39;where did you get that red hair<br/>
from.  I grew up w 3 red headed brothers and now have a red headed son. My<br/>
brothers all have brunettes or blondes.   I suppose people are just wanting<br/>
to say something but it IS an odd thing to say.  No one asks where someone<br/>
got their brown hair from.  Once when my brother was about 3 someone asked<br/>
him if there were any redheads at home and he replied, yes, 2 headed<br/>
brothers, a redheaded dog and some redhead fish.  Why not say, what great<br/>
hair.  I wonder if there&#39;s some history involved w/ the question.  Like in<br/>
the Middle ages, red hair was seen to be the work of the devil or something.<br/>
Sorry this is my my middle ( for me ) of the night musings.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wonder about. Some times if I mention we&#39;re homeschooling<br/>
to strangers, they will gather themselves up several inches taller and tell<br/>
me why this is such a bad idea and they believe this and that.  I think, had<br/>
I said I was sending them to Catholic school or a Jewish Orthodox school<br/>
which they might have thoughts about, they would never share those thoughts<br/>
thinking that&#39;s my personal preference. But someone this seems fair game.<br/>
Do others have that experience?  And I wonder why that is.  Maybe bc they<br/>
think that it really is a much better idea than they&#39;ve got going and have<br/>
to defend against it.  I find it a strange phenomenon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656858244">We get a lot of weird questions, but not because of red hair or adoption.<br/>
My dh is (mostly) Filipino, so both of my dds don&#39;t look much like me.  I<br/>
have been asked if I&#39;m the babysitter, where did they get those eyes, that<br/>
hair, etc.  But, my all-time &quot;favorite&quot; question was a woman at the mall<br/>
asking me, &quot;Did you give birth to her?&quot;  I don&#39;t think she *meant* to be<br/>
rude, but I can&#39;t imagine asking a complete stranger that!<br/>

I&#39;ve never had anyone respond that way.  Often, I hear about how they know someone who homeschools, or that it must be a lot of work (along with how they could never do that).  Sometimes, the person asking turns out to be a homeschooler or considering homeschooling, and I get asked what curriculum we use, etc. Occasionally, they say nothing and some even wonder away without another word.  <br/>
 <br/>
Not sure what I&#39;d say if someone told me how bad and wrong it is to homeschool, but at my age and point in life, I&#39;m guessing I wouldn&#39;t be especially gracious or kind. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think it&#39;s just a &quot;don&#39;t rock the boat&quot; reaction on their part.<br/>
I&#39;ve had it happen.  The talisman I use (which isn&#39;t fair, but it works like <br/>
magic) is to say &quot;Well, I used to be a teacher, and...&quot; and the critic gets <br/>
small again and says, &quot;Well, then, that&#39;s different.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s someone I care about or think I&#39;ll be dealing with in the future, I <br/>
go on to say it&#39;s not a teacher thing, it&#39;s a life-living thing, but if it&#39;s <br/>
just a passing whoever, I sometimes let it go there.  They&#39;re deflated and don&#39;t <br/>

with the woman working in the dairy department of the grocery store, she was <br/>
making comments on how &quot;smart&quot; he was and how well he spoke. The next question <br/>
was how old was he, then was he in school. He proudly said, &quot;No, we <br/>
homeschool!&quot; To which she looked at me for confirmation. (Why, I&#39;m not sure-he had <br/>
spoken for himself up to that point, with no &quot;corrections&quot; or interrruptions from <br/>
me.) Then she asked if he had any friends his age that he played with, and <br/>
since he is pretty literal and factual, and at the time he was 4 1/2 and had no <br/>
EXACTLY 4 1/2 year olds that he played with (5, yes, 4, yes, etc. but no one 4 <br/>
1/2! LOL), he said, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; she nodded wisely as if she had discovered <br/>
something important, &quot;THAT&#39;S why you speak so well. You&#39;re always around adults.&quot; <br/>
Ugh. I hastened to remind Wyl about the kids he plays with on a regular basis, <br/>
and then he understood that she meant somone AROUND his age, and hopefully, <br/>
she got the point. Or maybe she thought I was making it up. Who knows. At any <br/>
rate, his friendliness got him a tour of the walk-in cooler and a brief <br/>
explaination of how that area works in the grocery store, as well as an invitation to <br/>
come find her the next time we&#39;re in the store. People are strange... :~)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354284891">Gary is 3rd generation Okinawan-American, very dark skin with black hair and dark brown eyes.  I&#39;m white, with hazel eyes and brown hair (depending on my current color choice, it has red/blond highlights.  Andy has exactly the same coloring as Gary, while Dan is much more my color, but with light-brown eyes. I&#39;ve been asked &#39;what nationality is your husband?&#39;   Usually, I say, &#39;American&#39; and leave the next question to them!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been asked if my boys have the same father.  Of course Will, does have a different bio-dad, so I&#39;m used to that question, but it&#39;s strange to be asked that when Andy & Dan do have the same father.  People have asked me if Andy was born fairer in color (more like Dan) and then &#39;darkened up.&#39;     My reply depends on whether the person is a stranger, an acquaintance (who may become a friend) or a friend genuinely intrigued by the genetics of interracial kids.<br/>
 <br/>
I remember the day we were at a community center.  Andy had run ahead, while I got Dan out of the carseat.  I had asked Andy to wait outside so he could go in with me.  He ran to the sidwalk, where a woman offered to hold the door open for him.  He told her was waiting for his Mom.   I walked up, opened the door and motioned for Andy to go in ahead of me.  The woman looked at me and said, &quot;He&#39;s waiting for his Mom to let him in.&quot;  Andy threw her a very confused look.  I replied, &quot;I&#39;m his Mom.&quot;  She didn&#39;t look convinced, until Andy confirmed it for her.  Really very strange.<br/>

the door for him that he was waiting for his mom, and then a woman <br/>
came up, opened the door and he went in, I would naturally assume <br/>
that this was his mother! Why would he deny me, a stranger, yet go in <br/>
with a different stranger?! I think some people either just like to <br/>
stir things up or are deliberately obtuse.<br/>

<br/>
I really liked this response and the whole subject hit home with <br/>
something I struggle with lately.  I use a talisman, too (&quot;Well, I <br/>
have several degrees...&quot;) and that always seems to garner some <br/>
respect for our lifestyle.  But I always feel icky after I say it, <br/>
like I had to justify myself to a total stranger or that I copped <br/>
out.  I&#39;m trying to give myself a break though.  But I think for me, <br/>
it&#39;s part of the process I&#39;m going through being new to <br/>
homeschooling, and unschooling in particular.  I&#39;m still trying to <br/>
divorce myself of the schoolish ways (emphasis on myself, not my <br/>
kids, they are leaps and bounds ahead of me).  Everything about <br/>
having been brought up in a school minded mentality/society sets us <br/>
up to justify ourselves, either with grades, class rank, <br/>
qualifications, etc. and I have 37 years worth of that to undo!!  So <br/>
that&#39;s part of it for me, and it&#39;s also part of my process to work <br/>
on making myself a stronger person for my family, my children, to <br/>
live the unschooling life within our own family unit before I try to <br/>
educate the rest of the world.  I&#39;m still figuring it all out and <br/>
how to live it.  Unschooling isn&#39;t a &quot;cause&quot; for me, it&#39;s just a <br/>
natural way of living, so I try not to get too worked up about <br/>
comments from strangers and realize that those same comments are <br/>
what drew me away by intimidation from living this kind of life in <br/>
the first place.  Sometimes I think the most important way to be an <br/>
activist is to live the lifestyle like it wasn&#39;t a cause, just your <br/>
natural state of being.  I feel more confident that way.  I don&#39;t <br/>
need to explain &quot;myself&quot; to anyone, so when I think of unschooling I <br/>
think of it being a part of myself instead of something seperate.  <br/>
Still, I hate to waste a lot of energy or a good days positive <br/>
outlook arguing, so I&#39;ll use the talisman to easily opt out of that.<br/>
<br/>
I read a comment made by Alicia Silverstone (the &quot;Clueless&quot; <br/>
actress/PETA/Vegan activist) in Jane magazine (aren&#39;t I the bookish <br/>
one) that kind of came close to how I feel.  She said that she used <br/>
to be a lot more vocal about her causes with anyone that took <br/>
exception to them, but now she has  come to the point where she <br/>
knows in what forum her activism will make a difference.  It&#39;s sort <br/>
of a waste of energy otherwise.  I try to remember that when I feel <br/>
like I&#39;m copping out on explaining our reasons to <br/>
homeschool/unschool.  I think a lot of folks are closet verbal <br/>
abusers, and use opinions as a way of achieving their &quot;release&quot; and <br/>
I&#39;m just the current victim. Have you ever met someone that lives by <br/>
the mantra, &quot;I&#39;m entitled to my opinion&quot; and then uses that mantra <br/>
to justify saying nasty, *unsolicited* things to people?  Those are <br/>
the folks I&#39;m talking about, generally speaking.  So I either use my <br/>
talisman with them or just make it clear through my body language. <br/>
etc. that I don&#39;t have any interest in discussing the subject at <br/>
length.  I&#39;m not good at saying &quot;none of your business&quot;.  I&#39;m a lot <br/>
better at acting as if I&#39;m not interested in a person, that often <br/>
has the same effect..<br/>
<br/>
When I get the urge to share an opinion, I always ask myself, is it <br/>
kind, it is necessary and is it asked for, before I go about sharing <br/>
it.  I kind of turn that around a little to help me decide if I&#39;m <br/>
going to defend my lifestyle/opinions, too.<br/>
