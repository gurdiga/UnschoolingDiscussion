<div id="ygrps-yiv-898104795">Last night as I was drifting off to sleep I had the TV on and the Sopranos was on. A book was talked about and I thought it might be worth reading. Then of course I fell asleep and now I  can&#39;t remember the name. It was about  a 12th century scholar who got a girl pregnant. He was castrated and made a monk and she was sent to a nunnery. The book is her letters. Boy, I hope I got that right!!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone out there know the book I&#39;m talking about? I know the title is their names.<br/>
<br/>
something and something &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006368843">I&#39;m jumping in here with a quick intro - I have four kids (daughter 21, and sons 18, 16 & 14), all unschoolers. It was the only homeschooling approach I seriously considered.<br/>
 <br/>
I checked our public library for a copy of Abelard and Heloise, and found a link to the Medieval Sourcebook&#39;s electronic edition of Peter Abelard&#39;s Historia Calamitatum, translated from Latin in 1922. You can find it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html.">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html.</a> Here is a clip from their introduction:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;The Historia Calamitatum, although in the literary form of a letter, is a sort of autobiography, with distinct echoes of Augustine&#39;s Confessions. It is one of the most readable documents to survive from the period, and as well as presenting a remarkably frank self-portrait, is a valuable account of intellectual life in Paris before the formalization of the University, of the intellectual excitement of the period, of monastic life and of a love story that in some respects deserves its long reputation.&quot;  <br/>
