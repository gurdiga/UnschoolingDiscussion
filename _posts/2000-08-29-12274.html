Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 kids with 4 different appitites. My 3rd is a 4-1/2 yo girl. She&#39;s a<br/>
very picky eater. Hates vegetables of any kind. Hates anything &quot;different&quot;.<br/>
Throws a fit if we suggest potatoes are not &quot;yucky and stupid&quot;. For awhile I<br/>
thought she was living on air itself. Never finished a meal. The ironic<br/>
thing is she&#39;s built like a brick and is the healthiest of all my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Since she&#39;s so healthy I don&#39;t cater to her. I prepare what I want for<br/>
everyone and let her eat what she&#39;ll eat. If she&#39;s still hungry she can help<br/>
herself to applesauce or cheerios or a piece of bread (those are the 3 main<br/>
food groups to her) She gets them herself. I&#39;m not a short-order cook. I<br/>
won&#39;t fight about it and it&#39;s taken my husband awhile to realize it&#39;s not<br/>
worth fighting about. I don&#39;t want them to end up with some weird food<br/>
control issue. Someday she&#39;ll eat all those yucky things she won&#39;t touch<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about your son starving. As long as you give him healthy<br/>
choices he&#39;ll be okay.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I dealt with this very issue when my now 5yob was 3. I let him decide <br/>
if he was going to eat or not. If he chose not to that was fine but <br/>
if he was hungery later guess what he got for bed time. That&#39;s right. <br/>
His dinner. If he chose to go to bed hungery that was his choice not <br/>
mine. I guarenty you he ate a good breakfast the next morning though. <br/>
I just made sure to have lots of good snacks in the house and little <br/>
junk. If he chose to eat his dinner or any other meal then he got a <br/>
treat for snack. If he chose not to eat the meal then he got his left <br/>
over meal for snack. There was no barganing bartering or anything <br/>
else of the sort. He was in total control of when and if he ate and <br/>
somewhat in control of what he ate, by choosing to eat he got the <br/>
treat. I didn&#39;t make a big deal about it. I just did it. If he <br/>
complained that he wanted a treat and had not eaten his meal then I <br/>
would explain to him that he had to eat his meal first  and then he <br/>
could have a treat. I have to tell you also that my son has always <br/>
been lean. At 6mo he had a washboard stomach...never had any baby <br/>
fat. He is still lean and healthy and all of his 40lb is muscle. If <br/>
you make a big deal about it, it will turn into a control issue. DH <br/>
would do this when he was  home to have dinner with us by not <br/>
allowing DS to leave the table until DS had eaten to DH&#39;s content. <br/>
The next day he would eat less. Just relax and let DS make his own <br/>
choices and then be responsible for those choices. Corallyn</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643326093">I can&#39;t help other than to tell you my horror story-maybe you will figure <br/>
out a better answer.<br/>
<br/>
My second kid did the same thing-food that was fine the week before, he all <br/>
of a sudden hated. I didn&#39;t really think much of it at first. He didn&#39;t want <br/>
the meatloaf, but would still eat the baked potato and the green beans, so <br/>
if he had a hot dog with it instead, it was no big deal. It got worse and <br/>
worse. Then as the next 3 kids have gotten older they have become just as <br/>
picky. They have a very limited menu, I am sick to death of cooking the same <br/>
things over and over, so they are all learning to cook themselves. Sometimes <br/>
I make 2 complete dinners, sometimes I throw some chicken nuggets in and <br/>
they will eat side dishes that we are having, or sometimes they cook for <br/>
themselves or have cereal.<br/>
<br/>
My sister was home a couple of weeks ago, and all 3 of us got together and <br/>
talked about how all of our children are like this. When we were growing up, <br/>
our Dad would make us eat things even if we sat and cried for hours at the <br/>
table and eventually vomited. None of us wanted this with our kids, and now <br/>
we have picky eaters.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is also picky, but he is a meat and potato guy, and the boys <br/>
hardly eat any meat. Cooking here is hell and I hate it. Last year I got to <br/>
a point where I was burning everything I touched. I finally said &quot;I quit&quot; <br/>
and gave everyone a nite to cook, and I did the clean up instead. We ate <br/>
alot of grilled cheese and tomato soup and spaghetti! After a few months I <br/>
could cook again, but I don&#39;t do it all the time. I still hate it.<br/>
<br/>
If you find an answer, let me know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765258694">Thanks Corallyn and Cathie:<br/>
<br/>
I get the digest version of unschooling.com but I couldn&#39;t wait for answers <br/>
so went to the web page to see if anyone was out there to help and I learned <br/>
a lot by what you both said.<br/>
<br/>
Dinner was even worse tonight (before I&#39;d read your e-mails) and I came home <br/>
from the post office to find Zak in bed at 7pm and sound asleep, with DH <br/>
fuming over his behavior.  When I was cleaning up the kitchen after dinner, <br/>
Zak was busy making some kind of ball out of mashed potatoes and broccoli and <br/>
smearing them all over himself, the table, chair and the floor.  I breathed <br/>
very deeply and left it to DH to take care of, which might not have been such <br/>
a good idea.  I didn&#39;t want Zak to have food issues either and the rate we <br/>
are going that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s going to have.<br/>
<br/>
So tomorrow is another day and when DH get&#39;s back from work (power outage so <br/>
had to go) we are going to talk about different strategies as suggested... DH <br/>
is a very picky eater as well, meat and potatoes guy.... I&#39;ll pray for a <br/>
better day tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460119125">Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
Ugh, we have the same problem at our house.  What I have come up with is<br/>
to always make the option of a PB & J sandwich available to Alex if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to eat what is being served.  We tried the requirement of at<br/>
least tasting the dinner, but that caused way too many fits.  At the ripe<br/>
old age of 6 now, he occasionally tries dinner, and sometimes he even<br/>
likes it.  I also make sure there is stuff in the fridge he can get<br/>
himself if he is hungry - like yogurt or those little single serve apple<br/>
sauce cups.  With this system, I know he is eating something and I&#39;m not<br/>
feeling like a short order cook.  If he wants to eat the same thing every<br/>
day - so be it.  If he doesn&#39;t eat, he can get himself something on his<br/>
own later on when he is hungry.  Unfortunately, little sister Sean Marie<br/>
(almost 3) announces, before she even sees what is on her plate, &quot;that&#39;s<br/>
yucky&quot;.  Oh joy.<br/>

Your post has me delurking.  I have one child who will try most things and <br/>
eats whatever we are having.  My son has never liked food and finds it <br/>
difficult to try new foods-we have had some battles.  He has gotten so upset <br/>
that he vomited at the table over strong tastes.  When this happened, we <br/>
immediately stopped pushing him to try new foods.  I want our meals to be <br/>
peaceful times and I want to enjoy each other.<br/>
<br/>
This is what we do now.  We have little junk in the house and we almost never <br/>
have desert.  I make a normal meal and people choose what they want to eat <br/>
from that.  I always have some type of protein, a vegetable and a grain or <br/>
bread.  If my kids don&#39;t like it they are welcome to go and make themselves a <br/>
peanut butter sandwich or cereal or eat some fruit I do not prepare a second <br/>
meal.  I may leave sauces off of something and serve it on the side.<br/>
<br/>
I always have a good selection of fruit on hand, whole grain breads and real <br/>
cheese/yogurt and when they were smaller I kept a snack plate in the fridge <br/>
with cheese and cut up veggies and they were allowed to eat it whenever they <br/>
wanted.  They do get sweets but not on a regular basis and never as a reward <br/>
for eating something else.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to disengage but we have no battles at the table anymore.  I truly <br/>
think some individuals are just not that interested in food.  My son is one <br/>
and he has always had a problem with textures and strong tastes.<br/>
<br/>
I make sure they have a vitamin every day and they both drink lots of <br/>
filtered water.  They are lean, rarely sick and have incredible energy.  Do I <br/>
wish my son liked more foods? You bet.  But I can&#39;t dread each meal.  When we <br/>
are going somewhere and I know he won&#39;t eat I just feed him before hand.  <br/>
This drives my relatives nuts but hey they are all huge and have eating <br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
I read some place that, some people live to eat and some eat to live and I <br/>
truly believe this.  One more thing-this week my son, he&#39;s 10, said he is <br/>
going to start trying to like/try more foods because his friends do.  So, <br/>
there is hope.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970405855">Something else I do is to let them be part of the decission making on <br/>
what we have for dinner. I will ask them, &quot;What shall we have for <br/>
dinner tonight?&quot; If they ask for something that I don&#39;t have all the <br/>
vital ingrediants for I let them know and they choose something else. <br/>
Or I will ask, &quot;Would you like _______ for dinner tonight?&quot; If they <br/>
don&#39;t then I ask for suggestions. This way they can&#39;t complain about <br/>
what we are having because it is thier choice. Most nights I do this. <br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t and I think they enjoy having a &quot;surprise&quot;  for <br/>
dinner. Sometimes I will also fix breakfast for dinner just to be <br/>
different i.e. eggs and pancakes and ham. I figure if it is good <br/>
enough to start the day it is good enough to end the day. Fortunately <br/>
none of mine are picky eaters. I know 17mo absolutely will not eat <br/>
potatoes no matter how they are prepared. He has always disliked them <br/>
even in the baby food. And 5yos doesn&#39;t like beans, the legume type <br/>
not the green type. And I don&#39;t think 3yod dislikes anything. She <br/>
does love noodles of any type though. I guess these are my <br/>
suggestions for those of you whose children just don&#39;t want to eat. <br/>
For those of you who have picky eaters, I don&#39;t know what to say <br/>
except that I am glad it isn&#39;t me. (Not to be rude) Corallyn</div>

&gt;  now...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The throwing up part has me concerned.  It may be there is a food allergy or <br/>
some other medical condition.  I had a friend who&#39;s child did nearly waste <br/>
away.  It took 2 years of diligence and a lot of luck before the diagnosis <br/>
was finally made.  She came very close to dying.  Once the family knew the <br/>
problem, the solution was very easy...she simply had to avoid foods that <br/>
contained or caused gluten because the gluten was gumming up her intestines.<br/>
<br/>
If there isn&#39;t a medical condition, I would guess this is an issue that your <br/>
ds feels strongly enough about that there will be no winning with any methods <br/>
of force feeding or coercion.  (Been there done that...only I was the child!  <br/>
I still have some major food aversions due to being force fed as a child.<br/>
<br/>
We had a very picky eater who also ate very small portions.  It was very hard <br/>
to not make food an issue.  Talk about gut wrenching...for all the reasons <br/>
you described.  Ultimately, we decided to follow the expert&#39;s advice of the <br/>
time (something I don&#39;t do often...LOL) and quit worrying about it.  DS was <br/>
asked to sit with us for dinner and visit if he didn&#39;t feel like eating.  I <br/>
made a point of including something that was normally tempting to him in <br/>
every meal, but not necessarily the entire meal.  I figured that way there <br/>
would be something there for him to eat if he wanted it.  We serve ourselves <br/>
because I&#39;ve seen lots of reports that a parent&#39;s idea of normal portion and <br/>
the size of a child&#39;s stomach are often far apart.  So, ds was required to <br/>
sit and be polite while we ate.  If he didn&#39;t like/want what was on the <br/>
table, he could get his own of something else.  It is hard enough for me to <br/>
make one dinner, I don&#39;t do duplicates.  I kept easy things in the <br/>
cupboards/fridge and supervised his efforts when he prepared something <br/>
(typically PB&J).<br/>
<br/>
He did get quite skinny, but had lots of energy and at every doctor&#39;s appt. <br/>
the doc was confident he was developing normally so was not concerned about <br/>
his weight.  As an infant he was in 90th percentile height/weight ratio.  At <br/>
age 6 it was 10th.  I actually had people stopping us in the grocery store <br/>
and asking if I had considered taking him to a doctor to have him checked.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, about age 9, he put on weight and quickly.  He stopped gaining, but <br/>
still hasn&#39;t grown into all his weight.  He&#39;ll be 12 in October.<br/>
<br/>
Another note, we&#39;ve come to discover that ds does have a physical problem <br/>
which gets in the way of eating on our schedule.  He has an illness which has <br/>
lots of queasy tummy symptoms.  It&#39;s pretty hard to want to eat when your <br/>
stomach is upset.  I was already glad we&#39;d avoided power struggles over food, <br/>
but doubly so when this came to light!<br/>
<br/>
So, relax.  Assuming he is learning and developing normally, is not lethargic <br/>
or other health concerns, it is probably a phase which he will eventually <br/>
outgrow.  One day he&#39;ll be a teenager and you won&#39;t be able to keep enough <br/>
food in the house to satisfy him!  I would still have him come to the table <br/>
and visit with the rest of the family at meal times, eating or not as he <br/>
needs.  As for what alternative foods to offer, it is really up to you.  I&#39;m <br/>
inclined to allow cold cereal, but the expense gets rather high.  DH thinks <br/>
cereal is for breakfast ONLY and so there have had to be comprises.  For <br/>
instance, cereal is one of the options, but we don&#39;t buy lots of sweetened <br/>
stuff.  Cheese sticks or slices, carrot/celery sticks, apples and other <br/>
fruits, yogurt, crackers (graham, saltine, whole wheat...there&#39;s lots of <br/>
variety), PB&J sandwiches, eggs already boiled and ready in the fridge, <br/>
granola bars.  Just a sample list to get your juices going.  Help him get <br/>
lots of liquids.  It&#39;s easy for little people to get dehydrated, which can <br/>
cause mixed hunger/lack of hunger signals.<br/>
<br/>
DS lived on ramen for a while and mac and cheese quickly became a favorite <br/>
when he could fix it with supervision.  PB&J is still a staple.  Hard boiled <br/>
eggs are a hit in spurts (take a pencil and put and X or the date on them so <br/>
you know which are hard boiled!)  He still likes cold cereal for a bedtime <br/>
snack...but then so does his mom!<br/>

I am so sorry you are having such a hard time....<br/>

We are in the begin stages of pickiness with Ali (3), I try to make one thing <br/>
that I think she will eat to go (I usually ask her right before dinner what <br/>
she would enjoy as a side dish because her taste change from day to day) with <br/>
the new stuff or stuff she doesn&#39;t care for.  Then her options are to eat or <br/>
be hungry until breakfast.....she has choices.  If she doesn&#39;t eat, she gets <br/>
dinner as bedtime snack.  If she does, she gets a treat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048185545">Thank you all so much for your help with this... Read this digest to DH and <br/>
we are going to try what the majority suggested... He has healthy foods to <br/>
each when he does eat and I have applesauce, cheese, whole wheat bread <br/>
(Weetabix is the cereal of choice in our house, but I didn&#39;t say that as I <br/>
didn&#39;t think anyone would know what it was - Marianne)., bananas, soy <br/>
burgers, etc . We talked last night about all the things he does eat  and <br/>
that this has just become another battle lately and we don&#39;t want to fight <br/>
with him... The whole point of this unschooling for us was in lots of <br/>
areas... So this is about our own control issues and he seems to be winning.<br/>
<br/>
No he doesn&#39;t have a food allergy... He puts so much food in his mouth that <br/>
he vomits because it&#39;s touching the back of his throat, that was he&#39;s sick <br/>
and then he doesn&#39;t have to eat it... He&#39;s also very bright as you can see by <br/>
this demonstration of will.<br/>
<br/>
So today is a new day and I&#39;m willing to give this a try and see if I can <br/>
come out unfrazzled at the end of the day.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again all of you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578075975">Everyone in the group gave such great advice to Dawn F on food issues.  Now<br/>
I could use some help myself.<br/>
<br/>
First I&#39;m really a good mom.  Yesterday drove me to the brink of &quot;send hem<br/>
to school quick!   I thought we were having a great day, dd making Barbie<br/>
clothes from felt & staples (interesting look), painting, reading books,<br/>
etc.  The kids were having fun.  My ds (4) was participating with great<br/>
enthusiasm.  He did have a few spats late afternoon with ds (2) over toys<br/>
which I thought they&#39;d settled very well.<br/>
<br/>
Then like a switch he was playing with his brother his brother (2) in their<br/>
bedroom.  DS (2) came out to me after awhile & said bo bo & pulled me into<br/>
their room.  DS (4) was under the crib & after some time I was able to get<br/>
him out.  His first comment was &quot;do you forgive me?&quot; so he knew he&#39;d done<br/>
something wrong.  I sent him back thinking he&#39;d pulled an arm off one of the<br/>
Barbies only to have him present me with a tape, or at least its remains.<br/>
He&#39;d pulled it out, stretched & had knotted the rest into a mess.  No real<br/>
problem I thought he&#39;ll just loose one of his tapes.  WRONG, it was a<br/>
library tape dd had checked out.  The more I saw the madder I got.  All I<br/>
could hear from ds was &quot;I won&#39;t do it again.&quot;  He got a spanking in spite of<br/>
his promise, as he makes them too readily & doesn&#39;t remember them the next<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I took the tape into the living room to see if I could recover the mess back<br/>
into the tape box when I noticed he&#39;d snapped the tape.  I put it on the<br/>
table to show dh later & left the room.  I was mad about the tape & knew it<br/>
wasn&#39;t the time to confront him any further.  I gave him time out.  After he<br/>
was up from time out I thought he was playing well with the other two.<br/>
WRONG dd came in & said &quot;you have to come see what Gegory did.&quot;  I go in &<br/>
find he&#39;s again pulled the tape out & now has it all over the living room.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t believe it.  He got another timeout.  I didn&#39;t trust myself to<br/>
spank.<br/>
<br/>
The kids have a tape player in their room (have since birth) & the tapes sit<br/>
next to it on a chest of drawers.  We&#39;ve never had a problem from any of the<br/>
kids doing this.  When dh had been home for a bit I showed him the problem<br/>
tape.  He talked with the ds.  By this time I got a call to pickup dd (16) &<br/>
I jumped at the chance to leave the house to cool off.  When I returned I<br/>
saw my sweet sweet son standing in the kitchen smiling up at me with a huge<br/>
chunk of his hair missing right in the middle.  Not just cut short but cut<br/>
at down to the scalp about the size of a half dollar.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know that years from now we&#39;ll remember this day & laugh.  But that<br/>
doesn&#39;t help me now.  Am I just over reacting or how do I get a handle on<br/>
this before it gets any worse.  I know he&#39;s interested in how things work,<br/>
right now he&#39;s checking out a staple remover & picking up colored pencils.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really strange, he is really such a sweet child most of the time but<br/>
there are times (weeks in between thank goodness), without warning that a<br/>
switch flips & he&#39;s a nightmare.  Most of these times he&#39;ll start screaming<br/>
& you can&#39;t communicate with him at all.  Then the experience ends without<br/>
any causal connection & it&#39;s like it never happened.  His doctor says he&#39;s<br/>
healthy, he was 2 months premature, in the ICU for 4 wks for lung<br/>
development.  When he was 1-2 he&#39;d pitch a tantrum throughing himself to the<br/>
floor hitting his head on the floor.  But these disappeared before he was<br/>
2.5.  When he&#39;s in trouble he hids & goes into a fetal position.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else encountered anything like this? anyone survived anything<br/>
like this?  Sorry for the depressing note but I need help before I ship him<br/>
off to the military or the French Foreign Legion.  Or is this all normal<br/>
behavior for a boy?   Help please.</div>

He will not waste away.  Instinct will take over and he will eat.  The human <br/>
body does not need three meals a day to survive.  My 5 yo son also has <br/>
stopped eating vegetables at dinner and does eat some fruit, but not that <br/>
frequently.  He usually will only eat whatever meat I have made for dinner <br/>
and sometimes if there is a starch or carbo he will eat it.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
he has touched a vegetable in months.  Actually, that isn&#39;t entirely true.  <br/>
He likes raw vegetables.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure he will eat them cooked again eventually.  It is just another way <br/>
of asserting his independence right now.  Gook luck!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Help...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My 5 year old Zak is becomming a nightmare at the dinner table.  He&#39;s <br/>
&gt;decided<br/>
&gt;to hardly eat anything I put in front of him... I don&#39;t want him to starve<br/>
&gt;and I don&#39;t want to keep preparing or start preparing cereal for dinner <br/>
&gt;every<br/>
&gt;night and give in... Hubbie thinks we ought to do that for a while and <br/>
&gt;maybe<br/>
&gt;he&#39;ll get bored with the cereal... I have terrible fears of him wasting <br/>
&gt;away<br/>
&gt;in front of my eyes, with scurvey and zits and all kinds of vitamin<br/>
&gt;deficiencies.  I&#39;d love to hear how many of you handle the food issues with<br/>
&gt;your younger kids.  Last night hubbie ended up feeding him and he was <br/>
&gt;crying<br/>
&gt;(not my hubbie) and then threw up, even though we had something he&#39;s eaten<br/>
&gt;many times before in his life.  I&#39;m at my wits end.  I dread dinnertimes<br/>
&gt;now...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hubbie and he made a list of fruits and vegetables that he likes to eat and<br/>
&gt;wrote out which days he would eat them. I&#39;m serving them up like on the <br/>
&gt;list<br/>
&gt;and he&#39;s not honoring his part... HELP HELP HELP.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;At the ripe<br/>
old age of 6 now, he occasionally tries dinner, and sometimes he even<br/>
likes it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son is six and a fraction and recently became much, much less picky and <br/>
much more willing to try what the grown-ups are eating.  (He had been a <br/>
fairly reasonable toddler that got unreasonable at age 3.)  I didn&#39;t push him <br/>
for the last few years, and during that time he ate a pretty limited diet, <br/>
with almost no vegetables, and far, far too many cookies.  We are seizing <br/>
this window of opportunity to improve everyone&#39;s diet.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d relax. It&#39;s perfectly normal, and he won&#39;t starve.  At that age, all my <br/>
Zack would eat was macaroni and cheese and yogurt.  So, every day he had <br/>
macaroni and cheese and yogurt.  Next I thought he&#39;d turn into a chicken <br/>
nugget.  Zack&#39;s likes are still more limited than I&#39;d like, but he&#39;s really <br/>
branching out.  <br/>
<br/>
I bought a recipe book on working with kids in the kitchen, cause I thought <br/>
maybe the kids would be more interested in dinner (and more appreciative) if <br/>
they knew what goes into making it.  The other night when Zack was making the <br/>
bread, I was making a tuna ring.  He&#39;s never wanted tuna, and he absolutely <br/>
insisted that he wouldn&#39;t eat it.  Tuna is for cats, he said.  Well, the <br/>
policy in our house is that you have to try it, but you don&#39;t have to eat it <br/>
if you don&#39;t like it.  He was so funny.  At the table, he complained that I <br/>
put that cat food on his plate.  He was not being disrespectful, he was <br/>
laughing, actually.  Then he picked up his plate and licked the tuna.  Then, <br/>
he picked up his fork and gobbled up the tuna ring!  <br/>
<br/>
This is happening more and more.  We also have a policy in our house that if <br/>
you don&#39;t like the dinner, there&#39;s no complaining.  You can have a sandwich <br/>
or cereal or anything that doesn&#39;t require mom and dad to make any extra <br/>
effort in the kitchen.  If that isn&#39;t acceptable, there&#39;s always breakfast in <br/>
the morning.<br/>

<br/>
We hae a similar policy. When my husband and I first met (both already having <br/>
children) he firmly believed that kids should eat what they were served <br/>
whether they liked it or not. I had never forced my then 6 year old daughter <br/>
to eat anything she didn&#39;t like or to clean her plate. He grudgingly <br/>
respected my position.<br/>
<br/>
His perspective changed a lot when his then 7 year old son came to stay with <br/>
us. He was so accustomed to being forced to eat food, he would make up all <br/>
kinds of excuses to avoid eating what he didn&#39;t like. He would &quot;accidentally&quot; <br/>
spill or drop the food. He would all of a sudden come down with a stomach <br/>
ache or go to the bathroom and come back and say &quot;I just threw up. Even after <br/>
I explained to him that he didn&#39;t have to eat anything he didn&#39;t like and <br/>
could be finished when he was satisfied, he continued to lie and try to sneak <br/>
out of eating things. Eventually he came to see that it really didn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Dh also learned another valuable lesson from my daugthter. Always save room <br/>
for dessert. He was raised to clean his plate to get dessert, so he was in <br/>
the habit of basically filling himself and then stuffing in dessert. He <br/>
finally said one day that it  made more sense to leave a few bites of meat <br/>
and potatoes on the plate and really enjoy the ice cream without being <br/>
stuffed.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, yeah!  &lt;see the lightbulb over my head?!&gt;  The motto we went with is &#39;He <br/>
who complains, cooks!&#39;  This is so instinctive, I totally forgot we even use <br/>
it!<br/>
It made a difference.  It was harder to get dinner on the table when the 5 yr <br/>
old was in charge, but it made a difference and my kids can cook.<br/>
<br/>
Picky son, age 12, now expresses a desire to try new things when eating out <br/>
or visiting relatives.  I never thought I&#39;d live to see THAT day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94836629">I have brought my kids up to have a choice to eat what is on thier plates.  I <br/>
will not cook anyone thier own plate of food.  I have 4 kids, so no  way will <br/>
I end up with all that mess.  I do let them snake on vegs adn dip before bed <br/>
if they so choose or something else.  I have made it a rule that if you are <br/>
not going to eat anything on the plate goto your room til we are done, this <br/>
is because they keep saying they don&#39;t like the food and end up fighting with <br/>
the other ones at the table.  Siince I have this rule they can&#39;t &quot;snack&quot; for <br/>
an hour or two after dinner.  They now all sit at the table and eat what is <br/>
there.  But everyone has thier way of doiing things.  I can&#39;t afford to have <br/>
4 full different meals at the same time either.  I also have where I ask one <br/>
of them to pick out what they want for dinner that night like corn or peas, <br/>
mashed potatoes or mac and cheese.  This has helped by rotating who gets to <br/>
pick each night and they also get to help me cook what they choose.</div>
