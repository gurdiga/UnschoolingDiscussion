<div id="ygrps-yiv-354353342">**I offer lots of times to pay half of something if they&#39;ll save up the other <br/>
half - especially for fairly expensive items.**<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me! Sarah saved and saved to buy herself a My Twinn doll to <br/>
look like her, she got the catalogs and video info in December and planned to buy <br/>
one in January - on January 17th we headed to the website to place our order <br/>
and found the company is shut down and in bankruptcy. She is very very sad.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a lead on another way to produce a doll around 24&quot; modeled <br/>
after a particular child, please email me offlist. Thanks! DACunefare @ aol.com   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122078597">You can customize the American Girls dolls with hair and eye color, skin tone. Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t get one with one green eye and one brown eye like me LOL!<br/>
