<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309850514">Just wanted to let everyone know about the Unschoolers Network 25th <br/>
Anniversary Conference coming up on Saturday, June 29 at Brookdale <br/>
Community College in Lincroft New Jersey. This conference is a must <br/>
for anyone in the New York/New Jersey area and well worth a roadtrip <br/>
for unschoolers in other states.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto will give the keynote speech on &quot;The Paradox of <br/>
Extended Childhood.&quot; FUN Books will sponsor a special showing of &quot;A <br/>
Life Worth Living&quot; a video tribute to the late John Holt. FUN Books <br/>
will have a variety of titles by John Holt available as well as <br/>
backissues of Growing Without Schooling, the magazine he started. <br/>
John Holt is generally recognized as the father of the modern <br/>
homeschooling movement and the person who coined the <br/>
term &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The conference will feature dozens of great workshops and a resource <br/>
fair with a variety of new and used materials. <br/>
<br/>

Nancy Plent at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnNet@...">UnNet@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
Be sure to share this information with any new homeschoolers you know <br/>
as well as veteran homeschoolers. This conference will appeal to both <br/>
and will also include workshops for families with younger children as <br/>
well as those with teens.<br/>
<br/>
Tired of attending conferences and discovering that the vendors just <br/>
sold out of an item you really wanted? FUN Books encourages you to <br/>
avoid that frustration and get free shipping by placing a pre-<br/>
conference order and picking it up at the conference. Just indicate <br/>
in the comments section of the on-line shopping cart that you will <br/>
pick up the order at the conference and shipping charges will be <br/>
deducted. You are also encouraged to contact us in advance if you <br/>
want to make sure we bring a resource that you would like to see <br/>
before making a purchase decision.<br/>
