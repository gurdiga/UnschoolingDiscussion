<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712227053">I&#39;m feeling guilty for having sent a couple of posts back and asking people <br/>
to wait to post, so I&#39;d like to appeal to everyone at once.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a big list, and some people drop off just because of the volume of <br/>
e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Please try to avoid really short chit-chat greetings, as there are over 1300 <br/>
list members.   Please read for a week or two before jumping in, especially if <br/>
you&#39;re very new to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not trying to be mean with this policy, we&#39;re trying to keep peace and <br/>
save energy (new people&#39;s, respondents&#39;, and readers&#39; all).<br/>
<br/>
For people who are anxious for unschooling information quickly, you might go <br/>
into the archives of this list, to unschooling.com&#39;s message board, or to <br/>
follow links at my webpage.   Addresses are below:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563778829">Sandra, can you clarify what this part of your post meant-- &quot;Please try to avoid really short chit-chat greetings, as there are over 1300 list members.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 Do you mean only &quot;greetings&quot; - like &quot;oh, mary! how good to see you here!!&quot; or did you mean any post that doesn&#39;t contain any substance?  For example, when Kathryn wrote that we had a separate list to discuss your typos and I wrote something like &quot;lol or giggle&quot; is my comment the sort of thing you would like people not to post?<br/>

<br/>
JUST JOKING.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy for new members not to realize how high the normal volume of mail <br/>
is, or not to know how big a list is, if they just join because their friend <br/>
said &quot;come on over!&quot;    Any totally-local stuff (me talking to someone about the <br/>
meeting here on Friday would be no good) or &quot;I&#39;m glad to be here&quot; with no <br/>
more substance (especially if they quote a whole long post along with it) and <br/>
things like that are best combined with useful information.  If we wait until we <br/>
have something interesting to say and then combine our chit-chat with that, it <br/>
will be better for those people receiving digests (fewer digests will arrive, <br/>
and will be richer in content) and those receiving individual e-mails, and <br/>
those reading at the site (less opening and closing to find something good).<br/>
<br/>
Some chit-chat is inevitable.  I&#39;ve seen some lists seem to be nothing BUT <br/>
chit-chat and this one can&#39;t even begin to go that direction with (checking for <br/>
current count...) 1371 members.<br/>
