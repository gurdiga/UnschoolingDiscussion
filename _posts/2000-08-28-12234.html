<div id="ygrps-yiv-137732063">I too have a daughter who does not really have a bed time.  Even as a <br/>
baby she never needed as much sleep as other children. So we do not <br/>
enforce *bedtime* - she goes when she is ready.  She is usually <br/>
asleep about 10-10.30pm. Rising about 8 - 8.30am.  She is not a <br/>
morning person and lounges around untill about 10am.  It took me a <br/>
while to realize that she is different to me - I am a morning person <br/>
I do my best work BEFORE 10am...  Our body clocks obviously work <br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
Maths.  I always loved maths - english and English History.  I loved <br/>
working from work books and loved to learn.    My daughter is the <br/>
opposite.  So when we started H/Sing 5 months ago i expected her to <br/>
be like me - my daughter is 11yrs and had attended school for 6yrs - <br/>
I really did EXPECT her to be so happy not to have to go to school <br/>
(she was very depressed because she was getting bullied) wrong.  So <br/>
after 5months I decided to go along with what people had suggested on <br/>
these message boards and unschool - well at the moment we are <br/>
deschooling - I am begining to wonder if she is ever going to <br/>
progress to unschooling...............<br/>
