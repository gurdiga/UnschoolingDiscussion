<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191191426">Honor: In Search of a Definition<br/>
<br/>
By Dr. Robert K. Holyer<br/>
Dean of the Faculty<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One can know honor without defining it.&quot; At least, this is what one of our<br/>
sister institutions assures its students. And there is, no doubt, something<br/>
to it. There are many concepts of which we have a working knowledge for<br/>
which we cannot give a precise definition. And honor may be one of them.<br/>
<br/>
To be an honorable person, then, is not just to do the right thing, nor<br/>
simply to give moral considerations a central place in our lives. It is also<br/>
to want to be known and trusted by others -- especially by other honorable<br/>
people -- as this sort of person. And honorable people will go to great<br/>
lengths to maintain these bonds of trust or to re-establish them when they<br/>
are broken.<br/>
<br/>
But again, if we were to stop here we would miss the most difficult and<br/>
challenging dimension of honor. To belong to a community of honor is to take<br/>
a special interest in the moral health of that community and its members<br/>
<br/>

I found the above quote through a google search.  I tried to look it up in<br/>
the dictionary....but I can&#39;t seem to find mine since our crazy move to the<br/>
new house!  I think your article explored the issue from the angle I tried<br/>
to get at.  The original post was something about how someone didn&#39;t think<br/>
anyone should need to follow the commandment to honor you father and mother<br/>
since many mothers and father are abusive to children.<br/>
    I responded with some of my experience in choosing to honor my mother<br/>
and father (who had been abusive....especially dad).  I would think truly<br/>
&#39;honoring&#39; could only come from one&#39;s personal decision and<br/>
commitment.....*not*  becuse one has been told to by God or a a minister.<br/>
    It will take me some time to sort out all that this experience meant to<br/>
me.  I think I decided to &#39;honor&#39; my parents years ago (when I became a<br/>
mature adult)....meaning to look at them more in terms of your<br/>
description....to see them and grow in understanding of their wonderfulness.<br/>
Yet,  it has changed me ....though I don&#39;t yet fully know or realize the<br/>
changes.  After dad&#39;s funeral 10/5....it was as if I went into a cocoon for<br/>
a week - 10 days.  Right now I&#39;m slowly emerging from that cocoon.  We&#39;ll<br/>
see what the results are with time!<br/>

<br/>
But that&#39;s about being honorable--behaving in such a way that others will <br/>
trust you, respect you, want to be like you...   so that they will honor you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Something can be digestible or bendable or photographable, but unless someone <br/>
else digests, bends or photographs, there is no completion of the circuit.  <br/>
You can take care to become and remain honorable (having the worthy potential <br/>
to be honored by others) but only the others can honor you.  And you can&#39;t <br/>
send them the bill. &lt;g&gt;  They have to come to that feeling about you <br/>
naturally and spontaneously.<br/>
