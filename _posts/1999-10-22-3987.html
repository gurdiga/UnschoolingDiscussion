&gt;Eclectic Homeschool Online Update October 16, 1999<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eho.org/">http://eho.org/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to start off this newsletter by introducing myself! My name is<br/>
&gt;Lisa Conner and I have taken the opportunity to help your EHO Leader,<br/>
&gt;Bev Krueger by taking on the task of writing the newsletter that comes<br/>
&gt;to you twice each month. ::::smiling, waving &quot;hello&quot;::::: Just to let<br/>
&gt;you know, I&#39;ve been homeschooling my 2 children, ages 6 and 8 for 3<br/>
&gt;years now. We don&#39;t use any one specific curriculum or method to<br/>
&gt;accomplish this task, but use what works for each child at that<br/>
&gt;particular moment in time.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is not the first online newsletter that I&#39;ve written  :-) Some of<br/>
&gt;you may recognize my name and style from AOL&#39;s Homeschool Connection<br/>
&gt;Newsletter that I wrote a while back. I would like to take the time to<br/>
&gt;say that I love to hear from you readers!! Please feel free to send<br/>
&gt;suggestions, websites, and articles that we might consider them for<br/>
&gt;inclusion in the newsletter or EHO&#39;s website.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can reach me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Lemmenpie@...">Lemmenpie@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, enough about me...... let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening at EHO!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;North Carolina has taken quite a beating as we all know. Among the<br/>
&gt;hardest hit are hundreds of homeschooling families who need your help.<br/>
&gt;Imagine what it would be like if you lost all your homeschooling<br/>
&gt;materials! See how you can help by visiting the &quot;Homeschool Hurricane<br/>
&gt;Relief Effort&quot; in this edition of EHO. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eho.org/">http://eho.org/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ve created a temporary Homeschool Discussion Board while we are<br/>
&gt;reformulating our boards. The new system we are looking at takes a bit<br/>
&gt;more tinker than we thought. Please join us as we discuss<br/>
&gt;homeschooling!! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eho.org/discussi.htm">http://eho.org/discussi.htm</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t forget that you can help us as we help you by visiting Amazon.com<br/>
&gt;through our site! Just look for the Amazon.com Icon and click away!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;In our Features this update we have a &quot;Dinosaur Art Project&quot; by Sharon<br/>
&gt;Jeffus of Visual Manna. You won&#39;t want to miss that!! Great for<br/>
&gt;expanding any dinosaur unit study you might be doing. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;In our How to Homeschool Department you&#39;ll find a wonderful article on<br/>
&gt;&quot;Christian Unschooling&quot; by Jeanne Musfeldt. We are a wonderful mix of<br/>
&gt;unschooling and eclectic in our home. Jeanne describes unschooling in a<br/>
&gt;very easy to understand manner! As a matter of fact, you might be<br/>
&gt;unschooling and not even realize it!!   Thanks Jeanne! <br/>

  Lol!  I did have that book once upon a time but I lent it out about a <br/>
  year ago and never got it back.  I read it back in the days when I <br/>
  described myself as &quot;almost an unschooler&quot; so I&#39;m not sure if my take <br/>
  on it would be the same now as it was then.  Back then I would have <br/>
  described it as &quot;ok for someone who needs to get over being a school-<br/>
  at-homer&quot;.    I would like to re-read it.  I&#39;ll have to give the <br/>
  person to whom I lent the book a call and see if she still knows <br/>
  where it is.  <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m 3/4 of the way through How Children Learn by John Holt.  I also <br/>
  got The Continuum concept but my daughter is giving me that for <br/>
  Christmas and she has it pretty well wrapped.  I&#39;ll have to wait <br/>
  until after Christmas to read that one.  Any other recommendations?  <br/>
  I&#39;m looking for something that will encourage me to continue to be a <br/>
  totally radical unschooler.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704355455">Anyone who has read Summerhill might want to try a fairly recent book by<br/>
Matthew Appleton, a former houseparent at the school (yes, its a school,<br/>
but a very unusual one). Its called A Free Range Childhood. Id even<br/>
recommend it over Neills books (which have become very dated in some ways),<br/>
as an introduction to them. Matthew (I know him because I was one of the<br/>
interpreters for some talks he gave in Madrid years ago) writes very clearly<br/>
about what its really like to work and live with children growing up in<br/>
freedom.<br/>
<br/>
The author of Childs Work is Nancy Wallace. Her first book was Better Than<br/>
School - also excellent.<br/>
<br/>
I think Leistico is the author of I Learn Better By Teaching Myself.<br/>
<br/>
The Holt Associates website is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com">http://www.holtgws.com</a><br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/">http://www.holtgws.com/</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can link from the website to FUN Books, which bought out the book end of<br/>
Holt Associates. You can still buy back issues of GWS, and some other<br/>
things, on the Holt website itself, and they still do consulting and give<br/>
talks.<br/>
<br/>
These (along with the Home Education Magazine catalog) are good places to<br/>
buy from, rather than from a big chain, if you want to help support people<br/>
connected to unschooling.<br/>

&gt;   I&#39;m looking for something that will encourage me to continue to be a<br/>
&gt;   totally radical unschooler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101891077">Hi Cathy,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the USA, also have 5 children and consider myself a Christian<br/>
unschooler.  I think the ease of reconciling the two depends on your view of<br/>
Christianity and God.  If you see people as basically evil who need to be<br/>
coerced with the threat of hell and damnation to be &quot;good&quot;, then unschooling<br/>
can be more difficult to accept.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I remember how Jesus said we should be like children, how he<br/>
honored them, how he himself taught.  He lived his life, he talked and asked<br/>
questions.  He never forced people to listen and take note.<br/>
<br/>
I was at a support group meeting and the topic was &quot;Scheduling our<br/>
homeschool days--a guide to lesson planning&quot;.  I thought &quot;oh yuck&quot;, but<br/>
wanted to go see some of my friends I knew would be there.  The speaker told<br/>
about how she prays for God to show her what her children need to know, what<br/>
to teach them.  I thought about that and figured my kids don&#39;t need me as a<br/>
go between for them and God.  I think if he is looking out for me, he is<br/>
looking out for them and if he needs them to know something, he will let<br/>
them know.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350698041">I&#39;m glad you mentioned that book. I was thinking about getting it. I have also noticed that most &quot;Christian&quot; unschoolers seem to be more relaxed the what I&#39;ve alwasy thought would be unschooling. <br/>
Julie W in AR<br/>
  I&#39;m a Christian and I&#39;m <br/>
  an unschooler.  However, there aren&#39;t any good resources out there <br/>
  that I&#39;ve seen that are specifically for the Christian unschooler.  <br/>
  The Christian Unschooling book is good for helping Abeka <br/>
  homeschoolers relax, but it&#39;s more about relaxed or ecclectic <br/>
  homeschooling as opposed to unschooling.  It talks about unit studies <br/>
  and stuff.  Christian unschooling lists also are usually more relaxed <br/>
  homeschooling lists<br/>
