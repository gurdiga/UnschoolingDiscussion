<div id="ygrps-yiv-557631205">Hi, my name is Kelli and I am mom to Molly (11), Sadie (3, almost 4) and Nora (18 months). I was on this list serve last summer and throughout part of last year but went back to graduate school and took a break from being involved in anything but maintainance and school. So we are all rediscovering unschooling (we have been pretty much unschooling this year too) but I am back here again looking for support and hearing all of your great ideas. So our problem here, and the reason I reintroduce myself today, is that my little Sadie who will be 4 on July 4th is so hard on herself it is startling to me and dh. We are trying to be supportive of things she wants to leave about with no pressure for perfection or for anything but that she enjoys herself but she always aims to achieve perfection and will try something over and over again until it is perfect to a startling degree. For example, she and I are learning sign language (it started with an episode of Cailou many months ago and has<br/>
 developed in to quite a knowledge of this way of communicating) so she decided that she wants to learn how to sign the entire song of ABCs ( you know, with the &quot;next time wont you sing with me&quot; part and everything) so I showed it to her and she has spent an entire week going over and over and over it and if I suggest maybe we should take a break and try something else because she looks discouraged she says &quot;NO&quot; she wants to &quot;get it right&quot; and she wants to do it all by herself (oh she always says that ) I can understand the wanting to do it all by herself but tonight when she was trying to learn how to draw a heart and not being able to figure out how to do it she was a crying mess. I was trying to encourage her to trace mine or to keep practicing because that makes you better. I just felt like the poor thing is not even in a high pressure situation and she creates these things for herself. I also am looking for simple suggestions on how to teach her something like how to make a<br/>
 heart without actually drawing the heart because then she is just trying to do what I did and also she gets frustrated when I help in anyway. Thanks Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004610579">Kelli --<br/>
<br/>
I was JUST like her!! And I was like that at 4 years old, too. My mom <br/>
told me so many stories. One was about me getting new roller skates for <br/>
Christmas. ALL the kids in the neighborhood were out skating, but I was <br/>
in the garage, practicing over and over and over for hours and hours, <br/>
before I&#39;d go out and skate with other kids.<br/>
<br/>
And when I was 5 our local children&#39;s librarian came to our school to <br/>
talk about books and the library. She said if we could write our own <br/>
name we could get a library card of our own. My mom gave me a <br/>
stenographer&#39;s notebook and wrote my name at the top of the first page <br/>
so I could practice. I carried that notebook with me for several days <br/>
and wrote my name over and over and over and over until I&#39;d filled the <br/>
ENTIRE notebook - I&#39;d written my name over a thousand times. I didn&#39;t <br/>
want to DO anything else except write my name during that time.  I <br/>
remember this - I remember sitting in our treehouse writing my name and <br/>
sitting in the back seat of our big car, writing my name, and cuddled <br/>
up in a big chair in the living room, writing my name, trying to make <br/>
it just absolutely &quot;right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is so awful, first of all. The desire to do good <br/>
work never left me and I&#39;ve done a lot of good work because of that <br/>
urge.<br/>
<br/>
Moderating it a little, so it isn&#39;t so upsetting when she really can&#39;t <br/>
get something right - will come over time.<br/>
<br/>
The very best thing you can do is make sure you and other people around <br/>
her try things that you&#39;re not great at and show that you&#39;re okay with <br/>
outcomes less than perfect.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college, my grandmother felt it was necessary to tell me, <br/>
&quot;Pam, we&#39;ll still love you just as much even if you don&#39;t get all <br/>
&#39;A&#39;s&#39;&quot; So clearly she was still seeing that in me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay - I still like to be good at what I do, but I figured out <br/>
sometime along the way that there are times to relax and just muddle <br/>
through  and times when &quot;good enough&quot; is good enough &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

Today we were able to talk about the hearts and she told me that sometimes she doesn&#39;t do things right but that she will when she gets older and then I was able to tell her that at 31 I still dont do a lot of things right but I do them right for &quot;me&quot; and she liked that. She had a great day at the park today, she is dirty and suntanned and sweaty and laying on her playroom floor immersed in dolls and her sisters:) Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627644014">How about giving her room to express her frustration without you having to do more than that.  It is hard for a 4 year old to draw a heart, especially one that is &quot;perfectly&quot; symmetrical.  Most adults can&#39;t do it.  Let her have her full range of feelings and support her in that as much as you support her in learning sign language.  Her feelings and emotional expressions are as important as what she can do.  If you remain calm and accepting she can get strength from you.<br/>
