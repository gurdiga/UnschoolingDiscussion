<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one said to let Jaiden keep hurting Avery. In fact someone said that<br/>
they should never be left in a room alone together. This will protect<br/>
Avery until it is worked out. So why resort to spanking if there <br/>
are other options.<br/>

their parents? How does this reinforce your zero tolerance about <br/>
an older kid hurting a younger one? Kids learn by modeling. What<br/>
message does spanking model?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahhh. But the why is important. It is always important. When Kyle (my youngest)<br/>
was a couple of months old, every time I would put him on the floor, Jason would<br/>
come and throw his whole body on top of Kyle. Could not for the life of me <br/>
figure out why. I talked with Jason (who was 3) about it hurting him etc. Did not<br/>
stop him. I stopped putting Kyle on the floor if I was not around to keep Jason<br/>
off me. Sometime later, I was watching dh rough house with Jason...by lying on<br/>
top of him and having Jason try to get out. Now there is a HUGE difference between<br/>
a 35 yo man gently lying on top of his son while wrestling and a 3 yo lying on<br/>
top of a 2 month old, but obviously Jason was too little to understand. Once I made<br/>
the connection I was able to approach it from a different direction and Jason <br/>
gradually understood. If I had just spanked him to get him to stop, he would have<br/>
been extremely confused...after all he was just playing with Kyle like Daddy played<br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, protecting Avery is the main importance. But what folks are saying is that this<br/>
can be down without hurting Jaiden in the process.<br/>

really did sound like you were saying that what Jaiden was doing <br/>
was bad enough that he should get spanked. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with you that Avery needs to be protected and Jaiden needs<br/>
to know that it is unacceptable to hurt him. But there are other things<br/>
that his mom can try as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897189543">I think we often get stuck in a mind set that it is either or.  Sort of like the concept of justice and mercy.  Neither really can stand on their own, without each other they don&#39;t make sense.  Literally justice without mercy isn&#39;t justice, and mercy without justice isn&#39;t mercy.  They are mockeries of themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Same with this type of situation. Why matters, and stopping the behaviour matters.  It is normally not very conducive to finding out why a behaviour is happening while it is going on since the person is too involved with the actual behaviour to think about it. So it has to stop, and in some cases consequences...loss of the toy, temporarily, may be applied.  But the why helps prevent the behaviour in the future...or at least gives one a leg up in stopping it more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113485624">Once again i have to stress that I was not suggesting that you spank Jaiden. Forgive me for the bad  <br/>
<br/>
choice of words. I don&#39;t believe in spanking. Trying to teach someone not to hit by hitting them is<br/>
<br/>
preposterous. I am the younger of two children. I  have an older brother that was resentful of the  <br/>
<br/>
attention I got, so I feel a strong connection with Avery.(my brother and I get along fine now.).<br/>
<br/>
When I had my second child I just really made sure that my daughter didn&#39;t feel replaced. I brought her<br/>
<br/>
a baby doll when I brought the baby home. and I also made her feel like her baby brother was her baby  <br/>
<br/>
too. He was an addition to the family not a replacement. One more person for her to love. I have been  <br/>
<br/>
fortunate with all my children in that area. I know we are all individuals,but first and foremost we are<br/>
<br/>
a family unit.Our motto is all for one and one for all. That is one area I have succeeded with my children.<br/>
<br/>
I must add I pray alot. I ask the Lord to take up my slack and he does every time.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on your breakthrough with Jaiden.May God bless your family.<br/>
<br/>
diane<br/>
<br/>
p.s. it might help to tell him that as the baby gets older he won&#39;t need as much attentionand<br/>
<br/>
you will have more time for Jaiden.<br/>

<br/>
With 581 unread e-mails, perhaps it is too soon for me to comment, but <br/>
whether others have said this or not, here&#39;s a consideration:<br/>
<br/>
This is not an exact analogy.  It&#39;s a separate and very real other <br/>
consideration:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==Why she hit her brother doesn&#39;t matter.==<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;never hit&quot; is the forever rule, how will a child prevent sexual abuse?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps children should be encouraged to knee guys in the nuts and scream <br/>
like banshees *IF* the guy&#39;s nuts have been exposed and he has laid a hand or <br/>
a WORD on them in preparation to do something to them that is not okay.<br/>
<br/>
Across-the-board rules like &quot;Always do what adults tell you to do&quot; and &quot;NEVER <br/>
hit&quot; are invitations to and preparations for disaster.<br/>
