<div id="ygrps-yiv-213431320">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Fisher&#39;s grandpa came over today to &quot;do something&quot; with Fisher.  Fisher had a <br/>
game out (I think it&#39;s called a skoelje board, an old Frisian game that this <br/>
grandpa had made for him one Christmas) and was enjoying playing and keeping <br/>
tracking of his points.  Then Grandpa stepped in and started directing the <br/>
focus toward the addition and counting -- not very subtly, either.  (Grandpa is a <br/>
retired math teacher.)  While Fisher was excited because he liked how well he <br/>
was doing, after several minutes of having the numbers side of it drilled into <br/>
him, he was ready to be done.  As we were picking up the pucks, Grandpa <br/>
started counting them, and Fisher told him firmly, &quot;No more counting!&quot;  I supported <br/>
Fisher by just making sure he was heard (&quot;No more counting -- okay.&quot;) but <br/>
otherwise let him speak for himself.  I don&#39;t know if I should speak to Grandpa <br/>
about it more, but I was proud of Fisher.  <br/>
<br/>
He seems to really get that we&#39;re unschooling and that means nobody gets to <br/>
tell him what to do.  The other day I was trying to get a picture with him and <br/>
Riley, and was telling him where to move, to put his arm down, etc.  Finally <br/>
he&#39;d had enough and said, &quot;No -- we&#39;re unschooling, and I should get to do it <br/>
how I want.&quot;  I had to agree that it wasn&#39;t working the way we&#39;d been trying, <br/>
so I followed his lead -- it worked great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading -- just needed to share with those who would understand.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy<br/>

If you wanted to take a picture a certain way and since photos cost money <br/>
(unless it was  a digital camera in which case I withdraw that objection) I don&#39;t <br/>
see a problem with you asking him to position himself however will work for <br/>
your piece of art.  There are candid snapshots and there are posed photos, and <br/>
if someone agrees to be in a posed photo then there are obligations (slight <br/>
but real).<br/>
<br/>
If he were photographing you and wanted you to stand or sit or smile or go <br/>
profile, wouldn&#39;t you consider it?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, lots of times when we take photos for a purpose and <br/>
there&#39;s posing involved we&#39;ll discuss what would be good for background and <br/>
composition and that and decide together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s one of those cases where the lines are a little fuzzy.  I had asked him <br/>
to be in the photo because it was for our Christmas cards, so I was willing to <br/>
work with him rather than risk him saying &quot;no thanks&quot;.  His little brother <br/>
was alternately grabbing at him and rolling away, and I had a dark sheet out <br/>
that I needed them both to stay in the middle of.  Once we just stuck to the <br/>
&quot;stay in the middle of the sheet, do what you want, and I&#39;ll move Riley to match <br/>
you,&quot; it worked great, and I got a very nice shot for cards.<br/>
<br/>
Good point, though.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I kind of lean toward the person being photographed having more of a <br/>
say in how the picture goes.  The picture is capturing them and will <br/>
probably live on after they do, helping people to remember him and <br/>
formulate opinions of who he was at different ages.  So letting a <br/>
person be Who They Are in a photo is pretty important I think.  <br/>
