<div id="ygrps-yiv-913798095">&lt;&lt;Someone actually said that to you? OMG...They must be 70 or 80 years<br/>
old....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the several women who have stated this to me were in their 30&#39;s<br/>
and 40&#39;s.  It is a standard belief in our area, sadly.  Of course, these<br/>
women also believe in &quot;courting&quot; vs. dating, and are OFTEN left stranded by<br/>
their husbands who at the last minute decided he needed the car.<br/>
