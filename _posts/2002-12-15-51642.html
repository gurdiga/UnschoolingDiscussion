<div id="ygrps-yiv-139330799">I wanted to reply to someone who said something about looking at how we talk<br/>
to our children but now I can&#39;t find it... :o)<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it was reminded me of the time when Jason and I were having a particularly<br/>
bad day...it had been raining all week, we were at the beach (so did not have <br/>
access to all our toys, computer etc) and he was picking on Kyle. I said something<br/>
and he responded with &quot;fine, whatever...&quot; complete with attitude. I was shocked<br/>
and hurt. His whole attitude said that I don&#39;t care about you or what you want<br/>
me to do. My first reaction was, where did this come from, what had I done to<br/>
deserve this. Then, when thinking about it later, I figured it out. He had learned<br/>
it from me. :o( If I get really frustrated with him not wanting to do what I want<br/>
him to do, I would just walk away and say, &quot;fine, whatever&quot;...it wasn&#39;t until<br/>
I had it directed back at me that I realized how devastating it felt. I learned<br/>
that I really have to watch myself when frustrated, that he is constantly learning<br/>
how to deal with things by watching what I do. A big eye opener for me.<br/>

<br/>
The worst part is that they seem like reasonable responses when we say them<br/>
but when someone else directs them at us we can see how ugly they are!<br/>
<br/>
My worst was probably &quot;It&#39;s your mess. It&#39;s yours to clean up.&quot; I even said<br/>
it with a reasonable voice, not a nasty one.  Boy did I realize how mean<br/>
that was when I knocked something over and my daughter said it to me. :-/<br/>

&gt; Yeah..humbling, isn&#39;t it?  We were out shopping and I got overwhelmed with <br/>
&gt; all the activity around me and my children wanting to go everywhere and <br/>
&gt; touch everything.  My daughter started playing with a stuffed animal we <br/>
&gt; were buying and started saying  &quot;I hate it when that happens&quot;...over and <br/>
&gt; over again. She was reflecting how I was feeling...it was probably just <br/>
&gt; oozing out of me...even though I tried my best to control how I was <br/>
&gt; feeling...think she saw it in my face and in the way I was pushing that <br/>
&gt; cart.  And what if she actually thought just an inkling that my frustration <br/>
&gt; was directed toward her in that way and in those words?    Of course, she <br/>
&gt; had to hear that from me to begin with.  My best solution is to shop alone <br/>
&gt; at the present when I have an agenda...planned activities (finding thisngs <br/>
&gt; ona list) do not work for my son (2.5yo) (he just wants to explore).. don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; like short trips because my son does not like carseats and car trips and <br/>
&gt; short trips mean more trips...any suggestions?  <br/>

Sounds like the revelation I had while watching an Oprah show!!! I always <br/>
remember now what Jamie Lee Curtis said about kids. That they are like <br/>
little papparazzi&#39;s, always watching us and taking our picture even when we <br/>
don&#39;t want them to. Makes sense that they pick up all kinds of stuff we are <br/>
never even aware of that they saw or heard.<br/>
Same way I felt about my oldest and my sometimes negative image of myself.<br/>
