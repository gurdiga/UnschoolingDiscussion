<div id="ygrps-yiv-474172070">As a list owner and moderator, I see many articles go through lists that<br/>
&quot;need to be passed on&quot;. PLEASE make sure that the article you are passing<br/>
are actually true. Urban legends are very easy to believe, and I know I have<br/>
fallen prey to such enticing ideas. Currently we are experiencing a gasoline<br/>
crisis. I know that it is hard on everyone to pay up to (and over) $1.50 a<br/>
gallon of gasoline. BUT the GAS OUT article that is circulating the lists is<br/>
an urban legend. Just go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://4urbanlegends.com">http://4urbanlegends.com</a> and you will find it in<br/>
their archives. Or you can search through your ISP and find a different<br/>
site.<br/>
    Seriously, the only way to lower gasoline prices is to STOP USING<br/>
GASOLINE for your main form of travel. Start carpooling, only going to the<br/>
store once a week/month, pick and choose what you need instead of what you<br/>
want. Get out that bike that has been collecting bust since you fell off<br/>
that exercise kick. Walk. hey, I understand.<br/>
    I love the comfort of my van, and the ability to dress in sweats and RUN<br/>
from the house to the van, turn the key, blast the heat, run to the house,<br/>
warm up, and then run back to a heated vehicle. BUT, I too, am looking at<br/>
the gas station 3 blocks from my front door and going &quot;Not me, not until the<br/>
prices fall.&quot;<br/>
    So, I have pulled out my bike. I have even gotten out the trailer for<br/>
the children (the one that has not been opened since I bought it) and I will<br/>
BIKE the 7 blocks to Krogers, the 12 blocks to pick up the children, and<br/>
even the 25 blocks to rent a movie. And, yes, I will even put on my spring<br/>
coat to do it.<br/>
    Hey, then I am doing two rights for my country. I am banning gasoline,<br/>
and I am banning the extra weight that is sneaking up on my hips.<br/>
    Point to all of this. We need to get up and do something, not just pass<br/>
an email that is not true to everyone. So, do it today!<br/>
