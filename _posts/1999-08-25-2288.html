&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;I was just wondering at what point did our feelings towards mothering<br/>
&gt; change?<br/>
&gt; It is a fairly recent thing, I feel. Just voicing what I see, certainly not<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our feelings, as a nation, toward motherhood changed when our feelings about<br/>
&gt; what &#39;family&#39;  &#39;husband&#39; and &#39;wife&#39; mean changed.  The whole women&#39;s<br/>
&gt; suffrage movement and subsequently the women&#39;s liberation movement came<br/>
&gt; about because somewhere along the line people a) stopped believing what the<br/>
&gt; Bible had to say about families and the role of men and women; b) women<br/>
&gt; started viewing their roles as inferior (even though they had the better end<br/>
&gt; of the deal imho). I am sure plenty of people won&#39;t agree with me but I do<br/>
&gt; believe that God had the roles of men and women perfectly laid out and only<br/>
&gt; our own selfishness has changed those roles.  The change in our attitude<br/>
&gt; toward mothering isn&#39;t new, it was a long time coming, it has just reached a<br/>
&gt; point now that it is unrecognizable in comparison to it&#39;s original form.<br/>

Cool, I would be very interested in hearing that detail when you have time.<br/>
What I spoke of was only one aspect of what is wrong with the picture.<br/>
