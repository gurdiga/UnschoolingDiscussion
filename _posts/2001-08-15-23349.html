<div id="ygrps-yiv-637506716">my 5 year old starting reading books about 2 years ago.<br/>
I read some things from Glen Domain.  He has an institute (the gentle<br/>
revolution I think its called) in PA (that I would love to get a chance to<br/>
visit someday)and a book I read &#39;teaching your baby to read&#39;.  It involved<br/>
making flash cards with large print but she enjoyed it has a fun game.  Some<br/>
think that the focus on whole words would make learning phonics hard but she<br/>
picked that up because she was always able to relate sound to words she<br/>
already knew.  <br/>
  I looked at some ABEKA reading material and some scholastic readers for<br/>
phonics instruction but by she pretty much just picked it up by herself.  <br/>
<br/>
That same 5 year old is delayed 1-2 years in early/basic math skills.  She<br/>
read Charlottes web a few months ago but if I ask her today  what 2+3 is she<br/>
may answer any # from 2-10.  I just have to remember not to worry about it<br/>
because that stresses both of us out.  The author Glen Domain also  has a<br/>
book how to teach your baby math but I never bought that one :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420816490">My youngest daughter struggles with reading as well. So far I help her <br/>
whenever she asks and read to her. But I have to say I feel a slight panic <br/>
coming on :) She is 8yo, and I know she will will read, my parents think I <br/>
am ruining my children (I always was the black sheep) &lt;g&gt; and they seem to <br/>
always come up with a snide remark aimed at living style or teaching (or <br/>
lack thereof)style. So far my children have been quick to respond without me <br/>
stepping in. Very frustrating at times, but, she does know sign language and <br/>
some spanish so I guess I&#39;ll just stay out of her way a while longer :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not only does every child learn at a different age,<br/>
but I think they learn best with different methods -<br/>
so you could offer many of them.  The words on all the<br/>
objects in your house is a good idea.  A word wall is<br/>
another - a wall with pictures of objects with the<br/>
name of the object on the card.  Some children learn<br/>
by writing to read. Since she can print you could help<br/>
her to write her own stories by spelling them for her.<br/>
 Some children are more sight readers and would be<br/>
helped by having the same few books read over and<br/>
over. She&#39;ll soon &#39;read&#39; it from memory.  Some kids<br/>
like to play a game with flash cards where you show<br/>
them a letter and if they can think of a word that<br/>
starts with that sound they win the card.  You can<br/>
play a game of saying words like &#39;lighthouse&#39; and see<br/>
if she can break it into light and house (this helps<br/>
with auditory segmentation.) You can play a sound game<br/>
by saying &quot;/c/ /a/ /t/ - what word is that?&quot; to help<br/>
with auditory blending (both necessary skills for<br/>
reading development. You&#39;re already doing the most<br/>
important thing - reading to her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866182836">NICKI said, &quot;I am wondering how to teach her to read when she asks me <br/>
to. I picked up a book at the library the other day, looked at it and <br/>
put it back,too schoolish for me.. . . Just wondering how it has <br/>
transpired for those of you who have young readers or want to be <br/>
readers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My son was reading within a few weeks of his third birthday.  We took <br/>
a very unschool approach to the whole thing (like most things).  He <br/>
showed interest, we made sure he had access to info.  He absorbed it <br/>
and asked for more, we made sure he had more access.  We read to him <br/>
and he had a phonics toy that named the letter or uttered the sound <br/>
it most commonly represents when you pushed a button shaped like it. <br/>
He played a LOT with magnetic letters, alphabet flash cards, and a <br/>
placemat that had the alphabet on one side and a &quot;hidden letters&quot; <br/>
puzzle on the other.  When he started absorbing sight words we got <br/>
flash cards with them, too.  But the real breakthroughs mainly came <br/>
from two sources--computer games and television--which allowed him to <br/>
study reading on his own.  Of course, he&#39;s very visual and a very <br/>
independent learner (having me &quot;watching&quot; while he&#39;s trying to figure <br/>
something out drives him bonkers), so that was in perfect keeping <br/>
with his needs.  That might not be true for your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
We like Reader Rabbit around here--both the age-based series and the <br/>
subject-based line are popular, but the former is much more so.  (The <br/>
publisher&#39;s website is at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.learningco.com/SubCategory.asp?CID=251">http://www.learningco.com/SubCategory.asp?CID=251</a> but you can buy RR <br/>
stuff from almost any software vendor.)  We also downloaded several <br/>
things (shareware and freeware) from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kidsdomain.com/down/index.html">http://www.kidsdomain.com/down/index.html</a> and linked from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kidsdomain.com/games/index.html">http://www.kidsdomain.com/games/index.html</a> to online games that he <br/>
enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re open to using TV, I recommend you check out Between the <br/>
Lions, on PBS.  That show is probably the largest single contributing <br/>
factor in my son making the transition from &quot;knows certain words&quot; to <br/>
&quot;really reads&quot;.  The website at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbskids.org/lions">http://www.pbskids.org/lions</a> is <br/>
designed as a complement to the show, and you can find out almost <br/>
anything you want to know about it there.  There are descriptions for <br/>
each episode, including what letter sounds and combinations are its <br/>
focus, and online and printable games and a list of recommended books <br/>
to reinforce the information.  The site also has a section for <br/>
parents and teachers which explains in detail the educational theory <br/>
behind the show and gives tips on teaching reading.   If I were going <br/>
to &quot;do&quot; anything to &quot;teach&quot; him to read, I&#39;d probably start there. <br/>
It&#39;s such a FUN show, lots of music, groovy laid-back lion family <br/>
that seems to be unschooling. . .though the show&#39;s producers may not <br/>
realize it.  You can also link from the PBS site to info on your <br/>
local station and air times for the show.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can find a fun way to feed that need!<br/>
