You might like to try   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a>     and click on the <br/>
message boards. It&#39;s easier to &quot;pick and choose&quot; what you&#39;d like to read <br/>
there. It can get cantakerous sometimes too (folks both places are Very <br/>
serious about unschooling and its related ideas), but generally only in one <br/>
thread or another, not the whole board!<br/>
