<div id="ygrps-yiv-72196050">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Beth and I live in GA with my DH and 3 children, ages 13, <br/>
9 and 8.  We have homeschooled the younger two for 4+ years now.  My <br/>
oldest attends public school due to a shared custody arrangement.  <br/>
<br/>
If I had to choose a label for our family, I&#39;d call us eclectic <br/>
relaxed homeschoolers.  We&#39;ve tried some of every methodology, <br/>
mostly out of boredom, but also out of my passion for all things <br/>
school-like (new books, notebooks, supplies, etc.)  I wrote on <br/>
another list that unschooling is like our base.  We start there and <br/>
if we get bored or in a rut, I bring in things (books and textbooks <br/>
mostly) to give us something to do.  Then something kicks in, like <br/>
an addiction, and I find myself wanting to follow a schedule and <br/>
check off the list.  The funny thing is that we never stick with <br/>
anything very long.  Most of the time, the kids are happy to try <br/>
something new with me and then when the newness wears off, we <br/>
realize it&#39;s pretty stupid and we stop doing it.  I have had some <br/>
occasions where I felt the need to push and force and I&#39;m not proud <br/>
of those moments.  <br/>
<br/>
We moved (local move) last summer and by October we were having lots <br/>
of various issues.  We decided to put the kids in public school.  My <br/>
ds9 hated it from the first day and we took him out a couple of <br/>
weeks later.  My dd8 (seven then) absolutely loved being in class <br/>
though and begged us to keep her in.  She lasted until February when <br/>
we finally made a mutual family decision to withdraw her because of <br/>
things we didn&#39;t like.  Although she thought it was a good idea, she <br/>
was sad that she wasn&#39;t going to be in a room full of kids every day <br/>
anymore.  After a few days of being home again, she said she was <br/>
happy that she was home but.... and here is my major question for <br/>
this particular post... she has become clingy and wanting to spend <br/>
all of her time with me in particular.  Now, I&#39;m not complaining <br/>
because I absolutely adore being with my children.  I just wonder if <br/>
there is something I&#39;m overlooking that I might should be doing for <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
She turned 8 in March.  She&#39;s normally an independent sort, very <br/>
assertive and decisive.  She has a lovie assortment (3 blankets that <br/>
are named and best friends) that she sleeps with.  Lately, she <br/>
carries them around everywhere, and is always wanting to sit in my <br/>
lap, and is verbalizing that she is afraid to be alone.  I am <br/>
answering every want for her and just need to make sure I&#39;m doing <br/>
the right thing.  At the zoo yesterday, she was very whiny and <br/>
tearful and I ended up carrying her part of the time and she&#39;s quite <br/>
heavy.  I didn&#39;t complain because I felt like she needed me.<br/>
<br/>
I do see that she is a social butterfly and thrives on being with <br/>
people.  We have some homeschool friends that we see every Wednesday <br/>
at the park.  She has a gymnastics class on Tuesdays that she <br/>
absolutely loves.  We&#39;re starting an arts and crafts club on <br/>
Thursdays with a couple of girls to keep us busy while her brother <br/>
starts Robotics classes.  She seems to need more though.  Short of <br/>
putting her back into school, is there anything I can do for her?  <br/>
Can a really social butterfly like her be happy at home?  I felt the <br/>
rules and expectations at school were very unreasonable as they were <br/>
causing her distress.  But she just seems so unhappy right now and <br/>
my heart is hurting for her.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions?  comments?  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

think AUGUST!  YES!  knowing there would be school-supply aisles at  <br/>
every store, and paper would be cheap, and there would be new binders  <br/>
and new kinds of pens.<br/>
<br/>
My kids never cared.  I used to try to get them interested in  <br/>
things.  Kirby had a Dallas Cowboys three-ring binder he used and  <br/>
reused for gaming stuff and art and cards, and never wanted a newer  <br/>
one.  The first time he took some community college classes, he used  <br/>
some Ninja Turtle folders I had bought him when he was little.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s healthier than my paper-hoarding self. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Family decisions aren&#39;t the same as real decisions.  The youngest kid  <br/>
usually loses.  Was there any pressure for her to concede so that she  <br/>
would still feel a part of the &quot;mutual family&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
Well... you scared her somehow, to get her out of school.  Think back  <br/>
to things you told her.  What levers did you use to get her to go  <br/>
along with that mutual family decision?<br/>
<br/>
And you made her small.  She was feeling big and out there, and the  <br/>
&quot;mutual family&quot; pulled her back in.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She seems to need more though.  Short of<br/>
putting her back into school, is there anything I can do for her?<br/>

<br/>
Bring kids over.  Have all-day play sessions and overnighters once or  <br/>
twice a week.  If it gets to be too much, she&#39;ll tell you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I felt the<br/>

Just in case she does go back to school, you can minimize the  <br/>
distress and your own guilt and the impact.  If she has a choice  <br/>
(which she hasn&#39;t had before) her relationship with the school will  <br/>
be different.<br/>
<br/>
And what you&#39;ve effectively done is bring one of the worst parts of  <br/>
school home.  She is home compulsorily.  She didn&#39;t choose to come  <br/>
home.  She broke under pressure, because you didn&#39;t think of other  <br/>
solutions from which she could choose.  It was all school or no  <br/>
school, and she wants to be with you.<br/>
<br/>
Regression is normal even under the best of circumstances.  Sometimes  <br/>
kids realize they&#39;re getting bigger and older and they want to jump  <br/>
back and experience their favorite parts of the stages before.  That  <br/>
doesn&#39;t all have to be serious indicators of anything.  But you did  <br/>
take her power and freedom back down to a lower level.  She needs to  <br/>
build back up to it.  You can help by giving her more choices about  <br/>
little things every day.  Let her have  her way lots, even if her way  <br/>
is to just be in your lap.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list also.  My name is Karen and I have two sons, ages 4 <br/>
and 8.  I can relate to this part of your post, because over the last couple <br/>
of weeks my 8 year old has also become quite clingy.  I was also trying to <br/>
figure out what is different in our household lately, and the only thing I <br/>
can come up with is that we have recently started unschooling.  It&#39;s working <br/>
out great for us, and my sons and I absolutely love it, but maybe taking <br/>
away the structure of homeschooling or public school is leaving them feeling <br/>
a little in limbo.  I&#39;m sure in time my son will get used to the feeling of <br/>
being able to direct his day.  Any thoughts from others who have more <br/>
experience with switching from a set schedule to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I also want to say that reading these posts is really inspiring.  I&#39;m so <br/>
glad that I found this list.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Sandra, I&#39;m not sure what you mean here.  Her final straw was a <br/>
presentation her teacher assigned.  Every child was given an <br/>
American History symbol and she got Mt. Rushmore.  She was supposed <br/>
to research it, make a model or poster, write a little report and <br/>
then give an oral presentation to her class.  She was fine with all <br/>
the requirements except the oral presentation.  Every time she <br/>
thought about it, she&#39;d burst into tears.  This went on for a few <br/>
weeks until the night before the presentation.  We tried everything <br/>
we could think of to help her but she didn&#39;t know what to ask us for <br/>
and nothing we were suggesting was helping.  She finally realized <br/>
that the only way to not be held accountable to the teacher was to <br/>
not be in the class.  When I said &#39;family&#39; decision, I meant my <br/>
husband and I talked with her about it so the 3 of us decided to <br/>
just pull her out of school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What levers did you use to get her to go along with that mutual<br/>
&gt; family decision?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm... I told her that the teacher expected her to do certain things <br/>
and that I couldn&#39;t get her out of them because I wasn&#39;t employed <br/>
with the school.  Yes, I did contact the teacher.  And instead of <br/>
giving her grace to skip this project, I was assured that making her <br/>
do it was beneficial for her career in school.  So basically it was <br/>
stay in school and play by their rules, or come home and play by her <br/>
own rules.  That&#39;s a tough decision for a little girl!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And you made her small.  She was feeling big and out there, and<br/>
&gt; the &quot;mutual family&quot; pulled her back in.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bring kids over.  Have all-day play sessions and overnighters once<br/>
&gt; or twice a week.  If it gets to be too much, she&#39;ll tell you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m trying, but all the homeschoolers we have met so far are <br/>
traditional homeschoolers.  They can&#39;t just drop everything and make <br/>
a playdate because they don&#39;t have time to do their schoolwork.  <br/>
Field trips have to be planned 2 and 3 weeks in advance.  However, <br/>
we did meet an unschooler at gymnastics recently and I&#39;m very <br/>
excited.  She suggested some unschooling email groups including a <br/>
Georgia list which I didn&#39;t know existed.  I was just approved and I <br/>
will make every effort at finding people close by to hang out with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I read this but we had already done that.  I never forced her <br/>
to go and supported what she wanted to do.  She set her own alarm <br/>
clock each night.  Got herself up and dressed.  I fixed her whatever <br/>
breakfast she asked for, and also a lunch if she chose that over <br/>
cafeteria food (depended on what they were serving), walked her to <br/>
the bus, etc.  She loved everything about going to school except <br/>
that she was forced to give that oral presentation and that the <br/>
class was depending on her reading high level Accelerated Reader <br/>
books so they&#39;d win the pizza party at the end of the school year.  <br/>
The class went from last place to second place during her 4 months <br/>
in school.  At first she thought it was cool but she stopped liking <br/>
it because the only books left for her to read were books she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to read and the teacher encouraged her to read them anyway.  I <br/>
even contacted the teacher and told her I did not want my daughter <br/>
pressured to read books she didn&#39;t like and the teacher had the <br/>
librarian help my daughter find some other books.  That lasted a <br/>
couple of weeks I guess before they were back to encouraging her to <br/>
read books she didn&#39;t want to read.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And what you&#39;ve effectively done is bring one of the worst parts<br/>
&gt; of school home.  She is home compulsorily.  She didn&#39;t choose to<br/>

&gt; other  solutions from which she could choose.  It was all school<br/>
&gt; or no school, and she wants to be with you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Had that been the case, I&#39;d totally understand that.  But I really <br/>
did try everything I could think of.  I suppose I&#39;m guilty of not <br/>
being creative enough.  We did think about letting her stay home on <br/>
the day of the presentation but when I told her that I couldn&#39;t <br/>
prevent the teacher from asking her to give her presentation on the <br/>
day she returned to school she didn&#39;t want to go back to school.  <br/>
What else could I have done?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Let her have  her way lots, even if her way is to just be in your<br/>
&gt; lap.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;ll keep on doing what I&#39;m doing then.  That&#39;s good to hear.  <br/>
I&#39;ve even looked into private schools but #1) we can&#39;t afford them, <br/>
and #2) all the local private schools are Christian and even if my <br/>
daughter wanted to attend, my DH refuses to pay money to a Christian <br/>
school.  The closest secular school is for kids with learning <br/>
problems and you pretty much have to have a doctor&#39;s diagnosis to <br/>
get into the school, not to mention the hefty $15K annual tuition <br/>
that we can&#39;t afford.  I feel like our choices are so limited.  It&#39;s <br/>
so stupid and I can&#39;t help but feeling helpless.<br/>

<br/>
Is there a store near you that you&#39;ve never been in?  Maybe a  <br/>
Hallmark shop, or even a trophies-and-uniforms place?  Clocks?   <br/>
Stores can be like museums.   Thrift stores!<br/>

Maybe your daughter feels like she was so afraid of speaking that her  <br/>
whole life changed.  That must be scary.  I&#39;ve heard that the fear of  <br/>
public speaking is one of the biggest fears of all.  I took a class  <br/>
in public speaking before the first time I spoke at a conference ten  <br/>
years ago.  I wanted to speak without saying &quot;ummm&quot; and &quot;uh&quot; and I  <br/>
wanted to speak without freezing up out of fear of it being  <br/>
recorded.  It helped.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly Lovejoy went to Toastmasters to prepare for speaking at a  <br/>
conference.  (The class I took was by a longtime Toastmasters  <br/>
participant, doing a six-week thing for continuing education.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not recommending that you take your daughter to Toastmasters, but  <br/>
you might point out to her that adults who are already brave and can  <br/>
speak fine to small groups are afraid of &quot;public speaking&quot; and have  <br/>
classes and clubs about it.<br/>
<br/>
Find things you can do that are sparkly different.  You&#39;ll get more  <br/>
confident and she&#39;ll have happy things to think about while she  <br/>
recovers from her recent fears and traumas.<br/>

<br/>
I thought the same thing and offered the opportunity to her.  She <br/>
already had her written report that she completed to turn in to her <br/>
teacher.  She dictated it to her big sister to type out, but then she <br/>
let me and her dad read it.  She didn&#39;t want to even read it aloud to <br/>
us.  We suggested she give a presentation to her stuffed animals but <br/>
she didn&#39;t like that idea.  <br/>
