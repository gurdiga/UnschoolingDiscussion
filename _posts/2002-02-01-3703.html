<div id="ygrps-yiv-672994187">**Another reason is my dh is really convinced that you must protect your <br/>
identity from people on the internet.  He wouldn&#39;t even let me put my whole <br/>
last name for my identity.  He is convinced that those of you who show your <br/>
names are using fake names!  Well are you?**<br/>
<br/>
No. This is me. Deborah A Cunefare. Who&#39;d make that up? :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think that the whole idea of hiding behind psuedonyms is, well, stupid. In <br/>
the case of kids, it takes the focus off the REAL dangers and gives a false <br/>
sense of security. Kids aren&#39;t in danger of being stolen away by some <br/>
stranger who learns their name and where they live and sneaks up behind them <br/>
one day as they walk innocently along. Kids are in danger from predators who <br/>
slyly work themselves into their confidence and lure them away while <br/>
encouraging them to hide from and lie to their parents. Doesn&#39;t insisting our <br/>
kids lie to others about themselves set a poor precedent? <br/>
<br/>
As for adults, I think most of the nastiness to be found online is being <br/>
perpetrated by people hiding behind anonymity. I don&#39;t want to be mistaken <br/>
for one of them. And I don&#39;t believe that having people know who I am and <br/>
where I live is inherently dangerous.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree!  I asked him how was anyone going to be able to hurt us just be knowing our name?  He had some answer that didn&#39;t make sense to me at the time but I guess I internalized his feelings.  I&#39;m glad to hear from all of you sensible folks.  I&#39;m learning to trust my own instincts.<br/>

Yesterday, I made chocolate chip cookies.  About 10 min. before dinner my dd asked if she could have one.  I told her I was not going to tell her what to do but explained my thinking on the matter.  She decided to wait.  My dh said &quot;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t ask me because you probably would have been sent to your room after throwing a fit about not being *allowed* to have a cookie&quot;.  Later on that night he told me he had a talk with my dd about how smart her mother is.  I think I can get used to this new status!<br/>
