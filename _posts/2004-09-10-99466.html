Anne, who apologizes if it&#39;s already been discussed on lists that I don&#39;t regularly read...I just wanted to share the information!<br/>

Awwwwwwww...  we missed that!  Dang.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And it says it won&#39;t be shown again,  in the next 2 weeks anyway.  It might later though,  and I bet I could get a copy somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Alec would have really gotten into that.  The website looks cool too.  We&#39;ll be playing with that today!<br/>
<br/>

Speaking of video games,  I wake up this morning and my son is sound asleep, in his room with the music to a Yu-Gi-O game lulling him to sleep.  A very calm and soothing music sequence. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
:)  &lt;---  my son, in his video game heaven.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673851964">We watched it too!<br/>
Can&#39;t believe how far things have come...<br/>
My husband and I got to remember all the games we grew up with :)<br/>
Of course, I felt a pang of desire for the simpler games.<br/>
I loved &quot;Frogger&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband, on the other hand, just bought &quot;Doom 3&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey ~ I had *Pong* when it first came out (on weekends, I visited my <br/>
very sweet Dad who made sure his children that he only saw on <br/>
weekends had everything they wanted and more...!).<br/>
<br/>
Jake got disappointed with the second half of the show...he said <br/>
there was a Dad that kept restricting the children&#39;s video game <br/>
playing.  He said there didn&#39;t seem to be a fair representation of <br/>
both sides of that issue. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to watch it myself, though, to see what I think...Jake is <br/>
very sensitive to the negativity of those kinds of issues and it may <br/>
have been more magnified to him than it would be to me...<br/>
<br/>
What did you think, Kiersten?<br/>

My dad had &quot;Pong&quot; too!<br/>
It was my first video game :)<br/>
I was always amazed that we had little money for food/clothes, etc., <br/>
but we did always have video games and later a computer.<br/>
Priorities, LOL<br/>
<br/>
Jake is right about the dad...he was a total dud!<br/>
He kept telling the boy to stop playing in one of those whiney <br/>
tones...<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s time to stop now&quot;<br/>
&quot;Really, you need to stop&quot;<br/>
&quot;I told you it&#39;s time to turn it off&quot;<br/>
while his son is begging and pleading just to be allowed to finish <br/>
up the scene he is in.<br/>
I even yelled at the TV &quot;Be a man and turn it off or shut up and let <br/>
him play&quot;<br/>
What is the point of making rules just so you can sit and complain <br/>
while your kid ignores you???<br/>
<br/>
It was a good unschooling discussion starter for my me and my <br/>
husband that night :)<br/>
