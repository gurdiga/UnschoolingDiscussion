&quot;...Man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins<br/>
because he had achieved so much... the wheel, New York, wars, and so on,<br/>
whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a<br/>
good time. But conversely the dolphins believed themselves to be more<br/>
intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons.&quot;--Douglas Adams<br/>

On history:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through<br/>
three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and<br/>
Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question &quot;How can we<br/>
eat?,&quot; the second by the question &quot;Why do we eat?,&quot; and the third by the<br/>
question &quot;Where shall we have lunch?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The history of warfare is similarly subdivided, although here the phases are<br/>
Retribution, Anticipation, and Diplomacy.  Thus:<br/>
Retribution:  I&#39;m going to kill you because you killed my brother.<br/>
Anticipation:  I&#39;m going to kill you because I killed your brother.<br/>
Diplomacy:  I&#39;m going to kill my brother and then kill you on the pretext<br/>
that your brother did it.&quot;--Douglas Adams<br/>

<br/>
If you want your children to fine tune their critical capabilities, learn to<br/>
better see through the veneer of society, and eventually become veritable<br/>
fountains of unconventional ideas, I strongly recommend you introduce them<br/>
to the &quot;Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; and other works of Douglas Adams.<br/>
<br/>
Adam&#39;s thinking had a major impact on mine during an impressionable stage in<br/>
my life.  After subjecting myself to it in large doses, I was never the same<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Adams has a website chock full of information.  Visit it at:<br/>

&quot;The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that<br/>
cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong<br/>
goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or<br/>
repair.&quot;--Douglas Adams</div>
