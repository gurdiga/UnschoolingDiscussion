<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249239146">I have 2 daughters, one 7 and one 8.  I started homeschooling them <br/>
last year, right at the last of the school year, because of several <br/>
factors.<br/>
<br/>
My main factor was my 7 year old.  The teachers have tried repeatedly <br/>
since she was in pre-school to get me to put her on ritalin and into <br/>
a &quot;Special&quot; school because &quot;They&quot; determined she had ADHD.  I fought <br/>
long and hard, and finally found a child psychologist that changed <br/>
her diet when she was 5, and she&#39;s doing MUCH MUCH better.  I will <br/>
not and do not want to drug her, nor put her in a &quot;Special&quot; school.<br/>
<br/>
OK last year, the school started sending out &quot;Evaluation&quot; letters for <br/>
my 8 year old daughter who is NOT hyper, nor anything like my 7 year <br/>
old.  These were the same forms they used on my 7 year old, before <br/>
they determined she had ADHD.  <br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, my girls can&#39;t read, and it&#39;s not THEIR <br/>
FAULT.  They are not dumb, nor retarded (sorry for the rude word but <br/>
that&#39;s what they try to say about my 7 year old).  I finally got fed <br/>
up last year and pulled them otu, figuring I could teach them to read <br/>
one on one much better than the SORRY teachers could.<br/>
<br/>
OK since then, the 8 year old has improved ALOT.  She&#39;s a lil Math <br/>
genius, and can grasp math quicker than I can believe.  So I can say <br/>
that homeschooling for her has gone GREAT except for the fact she <br/>
does not like doing seatwork.<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old, I&#39;m about at my wits end now and can understand why <br/>
the teachers couldn&#39;t teach her.  She is SMART but WILL NOT apply <br/>
herself.  She knows how to tell time, but like this morning when I <br/>
gave her the clock worksheets, she wrote down random numbers just to <br/>
get it done, then stomped off when I printed her 2 new worksheets and <br/>
told her to do them right because I knew she could do it.<br/>
<br/>
When we go our phonics flash cards, she won&#39;t even TRY to sound them <br/>
out, she just says whatever comes to mind first.<br/>
<br/>
I am almost ready to give up, I&#39;m near tears and I DO NOT want my <br/>
daughter in that &quot;Special&quot; school.  I was looking for homeschooling <br/>
help resources trying to find a support group for children with ADHD <br/>
children when I stumbled across a site that mentioned unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So far I have read for 2 hours, and I think this may be what we <br/>
need!!!  I know both my girls would LOVE to learn, by doing fun <br/>
things instead of seatwork and memorizing, but I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
begin and how to start unschooling them so they can learn to read.  <br/>
(They can read a lil, but not on thier grade levels).<br/>
<br/>
Any helpful tips and advice sure would be appreciated.  Especially in <br/>
the reading area.  Because they are both smart as a whip, if I teach <br/>
them somehting to do with Science, they remember it, and they catch <br/>
onto Math quick.  But the not being able to read is killing me, and <br/>
frustrating them because they want to be able to read books alone <br/>
likethier big sister does (She&#39;s 13 and still in piblic school, she <br/>
is agifted child that taught herself to read and was reading on 4th <br/>
grade level by time she was 4, so I left her in publicschools so she <br/>
could participate in all the progras she&#39;d already joined).<br/>
<br/>
I think I let my oldest daughters succes blind me to how difficult it <br/>
is for a child to learn.  Then I thought the school would have them <br/>
reading.  Then I woke up and realized I best do something quick <br/>
because the blasted school system DOESN&#39;T CARE if they can do <br/>
anything, all they care about is &quot;Pass&quot; or &quot;Fail&quot; and on to the next <br/>
student.  <br/>
<br/>
Also I wanted to try hooked on phonics, but that&#39;s too expensive for <br/>
our budget right now.  So any helpful affordable advice woudl be <br/>
appreciated.   And if they need a course or somethignt hat costs alot <br/>
of money, I am more than willing to sell my truck to get it for them, <br/>
but I need to know it&#39;s a course that will work.<br/>
<br/>
OK I&#39;m rambling, I&#39;m going to go read more about this unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508508283">Maria, welcome to the group.  The first thing to do is to sit down and take a deep breath.  :-)  You may have found in your unschooling research that unschooling is letting the children be the leaders of their lives.  It may take a while for them to deschool, but when they do you will find them bringing up subjects and asking you to help with whatever they are interested in.  Don&#39;t worry, just trust they will know what they need at any given time.  Good Luck!<br/>

Unschooling to us, (husband and myself) is child led learning. Meaning you <br/>
don&#39;t make them do worksheets and sit down and do seat work and so on. You <br/>
relax and let them stay home with you and go places with you and do what <br/>
they would like to do. And many many days it will seem like all they do is <br/>
play. And that&#39;s okay too because they also learn so much just by playing. <br/>
As parents we make sure that our children have all kinso f resources around <br/>
the house. Tons of books, which aren&#39;t all childrens books. And toys and fun <br/>
stuff like arts and crafts and building materials and animals and so on. We <br/>
provide all the &quot;stuff&quot; and just let them have at it. There are some things <br/>
that may go untouched for years, but then they will discover it.<br/>
<br/>
My 6 and 7 year olds have taught themselves how to read just like they <br/>
learned to swim and walk. I was there watching of course, (well not all the <br/>
time with the walking and reading!) but they did it themselves when &quot;they&quot; <br/>
were ready regardless of what I thought.<br/>
<br/>
My SIL told me about fantastic swim lessons for the kids. I asked them if <br/>
they wanted to go and they said no. Well she didn&#39;t think that was a good <br/>
idea here in FL. That I should have, for their own good, taken them. Why?? <br/>
They didn&#39;t want to go. And now they swim like fish with no pushing and no <br/>
crying over lessons they didn&#39;t want. Same thing happened with the reading. <br/>
Why should I make them sit down and force them to do things they don&#39;t want <br/>
to do? When they are ready, they will get it on their own. Really they will.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like your daughter is trying to tell you that. If you know she knows <br/>
things and she&#39;s putting things down to get them over with, she&#39;s telling <br/>
you she doesn&#39;t like doing it. And if you keep making her, she will get <br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
So just play with your kids and let them play and read to them a lot and <br/>
don&#39;t worry about them reading to themselves. It will all come. And just be <br/>
there for them to do things with and answer questions for them and help when <br/>
they ask for it. If you watch your kids they will give you all the signs of <br/>
what they need and want to do.<br/>

Hi, Maria --<br/>
<br/>
Making the switch over to unschooling from a more &quot;formal&quot; kind of<br/>
learning with worksheets takes a big mental adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
If you pick fun materials for learning, but still set times for your<br/>
kids to use the materials and make them &quot;finish&quot; when they don&#39;t want<br/>
to, that wouldn&#39;t be unschooling and you wouldn&#39;t see the same results<br/>
that we expect from unschooling.  (The approach I&#39;m describing could be<br/>
&quot;eclectic homeschooling&quot; or &quot;unit-studies&quot; or &quot;relaxed homeschooling&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
Some people come into the unschooling forum just to find out about the<br/>
fun resources.  Others come to change their way of life.  We may TRY to<br/>
persuade you to &quot;unschool all the way&quot;, but we can&#39;t actually force you.<br/>
 &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I actually have a homeschooling mom friend who was on Ritalin herself as<br/>
a child.  I think the school system just couldn&#39;t accomodate her<br/>
kinesthetic learning style.  Her oldest daughter is also a kinesthetic<br/>
learner.  I might be able to recruit her to talk to you if you have<br/>
specific issues you need reassurance about.  You can email me privately<br/>
if you need to follow up on that.<br/>
<br/>
I live in a big city and the libraries here carry Hooked on Phonics and<br/>
the Phonics Game. So check your library, if you haven&#39;t done that<br/>
already.  Some of my homeschooled friends (who aren&#39;t unschooling)<br/>
recommend the book Reading Reflex, which I would guess only costs about<br/>
$20.  My son (now 8) really learned a lot about reading from watching<br/>
the PBS show, Between the Lions.  He liked it because it&#39;s funny. <br/>
(Resources at my house have to be more than fun -- they have to be<br/>
funny, or my son won&#39;t touch them.)<br/>
<br/>
When kids aren&#39;t early readers, they can learn a lot from books that mom<br/>
reads to them, audio books on tape (especially in the car) and videos.<br/>
And, of course, they can learn from hands-on experience.  Science and<br/>
history videos are popular at my house.  I&#39;ve been taping the new<br/>
revolutionary war cartoon, Liberty&#39;s Kids, on PBS.  My son likes it<br/>
because it has lively music AND gun fighting.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, but I think you have to let go of anxiety about kid&#39;s reading<br/>
so that they can relax enough to do it.  It may take time. I hope Sandra<br/>
will post the links to the articles she has about kids learning to read<br/>
in their own time.  The articles will help you feel better.<br/>

For the LONGEST time I thought my daughter would never read on her own. We <br/>
just kept reading TO her (still do). Oh, when she was like 5,6 I would <br/>
*try* unsuccessfully to *teach* her to read. Then like a couple of years <br/>
later we would catch her reading books to her younger brother, who is 2 <br/>
yrs. younger. And that was when she would refuse to read out loud to us &lt;g&gt; <br/>
and we were a little concerned about her reading level. Then one day she <br/>
was reading a book, and someone gave us a link to a site that said what <br/>
grade-levels different books were. And to our ecstatic surprise, she was <br/>
reading a 6TH GRADE LEVEL book at 8 yrs. old :) Ever since then, we&#39;ve <br/>
stopped worrying about it. We tried to teach our son (now 7) to read a <br/>
couple of years ago, but he just was NOT interested. He was perfectly happy <br/>
reading road-signs, captioning on TV, video game &#39;talking&#39;, and computer <br/>
games. So basically, he taught himself to read.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Advice? Oh, maybe just trying to relax, take them to the library and let <br/>
*them* pick out (or not) books (no matter what the &quot;grade level&quot; is). How <br/>
about comic books? Or magazines?<br/>

<br/>
You make it sound so EASY.<br/>
<br/>
So far, I have already given one lesson, and the next starts <br/>
tomorrow.  My dryer broke so I went to hang clothes out on the line.  <br/>
My 8 year old daughter (Mariah) followed me and asked how they got <br/>
dry like that (She&#39;s so used to the dryer doing the work) so I turned <br/>
that into a lesson where I explained about evaporation, clouds and <br/>
rain.  We&#39;re fixing to go let her boil a small pot of water so she <br/>
can watch it disappear, and freeze a soap mold full of water so she <br/>
can make a cube of ice that looks like a butterfly.<br/>
<br/>
I also asked if they wanted to make birdhouses so I&#39;m going to look <br/>
for a simple birdhouse to make, and let them measure it and build it <br/>
themselves tomorrow.  We&#39;ll probably use wood glue instead of nails, <br/>
but I think that&#39;ll be fun and they both jumped up and down excited <br/>
when I asked if they would like to make one. Maybe that can turn into <br/>
a lesson on birds.<br/>
<br/>
Right now they are watching rat race with the closed captioning <br/>
turned on, I saw that at another unschooling site, about if they want <br/>
to watch TV let them, just turn the captions on so they can be <br/>
learning word recognition without even realizing it.  (Oh I was so <br/>
happy to find that tip)  and rat race is a pretty clean movie, <br/>
suitable for their age.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling sounds like so much fun, for both me and the girls.  And <br/>
I never realized that maybe Mirial (the 7 year old) was trying to <br/>
tell me something, by refusing to do her seatwork.<br/>
<br/>
Mariah asks alot of questions, so it&#39;ll be easy to seek opportunities <br/>
to teach when she asks (like she did with the clothes) but Mirial is, <br/>
well like she&#39;s in her own little world.  When I was hanging clothes, <br/>
Mariah stood right by me and hung onto every word.  Whereas Mirial <br/>
took off to the other end of the clothesline and tried to swing on <br/>
it, then started digging in the grass, then went towards the creek, <br/>
then went and jumped off the porch, then tried to swing her lil <br/>
sister off the porch (Baby is 1 1/2 and I also have a son that&#39;s 4), <br/>
then went and threw some wood off the porch, then tried to roll the <br/>
trash can through the backyard.  That resulted in as much excersise <br/>
for me, chasing her, as it did with her running around.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s very active, and I still haven&#39;t found any unschooling ideas <br/>
for a child that doesn&#39;t want to sit still for more than aminute, she <br/>
always has to gogogogogo.  Like right now, she&#39;s not paying rat race <br/>
any attention, she&#39;s got her hands and feet between the door posts <br/>
and is climbing up the doorway like a lil spidergirl.  PE will be no <br/>
problem for her, but I don&#39;t know if she can actually learn if she <br/>
can&#39;t even stay still long enough to listen to one sentence.  I can&#39;t <br/>
even read to her, because we&#39;ll be reading a book, and she&#39;ll look at <br/>
the pictures and get to wanting to go see a bird, or ride a bike, or <br/>
do anythign that is realted to the picture.  BUT for the rare times <br/>
she does sit still, I can tell her something ONE time, and she <br/>
remembers it.  Like telling time, it took two days for mariah to <br/>
grasp it, but Mirial took to it the first time I told her.  So i know <br/>
she&#39;s not dumb.  The not wanting to sit still is why they wanted to <br/>
put her on ritalin, I can handle it, it doesn&#39;t bother me a bit,but <br/>
when I need her to learn it does make me wonder if I can do the job <br/>
of teaching her properly.<br/>
<br/>
I have even taken them to the park, thinking a few hours of HARD play <br/>
would help her calm down a bit to learn.  No luck, that child can go <br/>
for hours on end and not get the least bit tired.  When we get home, <br/>
the other kids will go right off to sleep because they are so tired, <br/>
whereas Mirial just wants to jump on the bed.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post, but you&#39;d have to understand Mirial, in <br/>
order to understand why i&#39;m having doubts about whether I can do this.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to do just that, take a deep breath that is.  No more <br/>
lessons for them today other than playing with water.  They need a <br/>
break and I sure need one bad...lol<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also going to spend some time today looking for lessons for hyper <br/>
children, hoping to find something that can help my 7 year old Mirial.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, it&#39;s nice to know that there are alot of parents that are <br/>
unschooling, that I can ask advice from.<br/>

research that unschooling is letting the children be the leaders of <br/>
their lives.  It may take a while for them to deschool, but when they <br/>
do you will find them bringing up subjects and asking you to help <br/>
with whatever they are interested in.  Don&#39;t worry, just trust they <br/>
will know what they need at any given time.  Good Luck!<br/>

I use to live in Lawrenceville, GA but now live in<br/>
California, we all miss it so much.  That is where I<br/>
first started homeschooling.  A book I find that is<br/>
really good no matter how you homeschool, is Awakening<br/>
Your Child&#39;s Genius by Thomas Armstrong.  Good Luck.<br/>

<br/>
&gt;Mary,<br/>
&gt;You make it sound so EASY.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So far, I have already given one lesson, and the next starts<br/>
&gt;tomorrow.  My dryer broke so I went to hang clothes out on the line.<br/>
&gt;My 8 year old daughter (Mariah) followed me and asked how they got<br/>
&gt;dry like that (She&#39;s so used to the dryer doing the work) so I turned<br/>
&gt;that into a lesson where I explained about evaporation, clouds and<br/>
&gt;rain.  We&#39;re fixing to go let her boil a small pot of water so she<br/>
&gt;can watch it disappear, and freeze a soap mold full of water so she<br/>
&gt;can make a cube of ice that looks like a butterfly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also asked if they wanted to make birdhouses so I&#39;m going to look<br/>
&gt;for a simple birdhouse to make, and let them measure it and build it<br/>
&gt;themselves tomorrow.  We&#39;ll probably use wood glue instead of nails,<br/>
&gt;but I think that&#39;ll be fun and they both jumped up and down excited<br/>
&gt;when I asked if they would like to make one. Maybe that can turn into<br/>
&gt;a lesson on birds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The not wanting to sit still is why they wanted to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;put her on ritalin, I can handle it, it doesn&#39;t bother me a bit,but<br/>
&gt;when I need her to learn it does make me wonder if I can do the job<br/>
&gt;of teaching her properly.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well Maria, it probaly is easier for me because I&#39;ve been doing this since <br/>
my 7 year old was born. And I&#39;ve never had to deal with them being in school <br/>
at all so there was no deschooling to be done. And from what I understand, <br/>
most kids from school need to have their time to deschool. I&#39;ve heard people <br/>
say it can actually take a year or more.<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing with the dryer and the birdhouses are great. You can see how <br/>
something so simple about the dryer breaking (sorry to hear that!) can be a <br/>
learning experience. Just make sure you don&#39;t force too much info if they <br/>
seem to be zoning out. I sometimes get so eager when they ask a question I <br/>
get way too involved and I start to see that glassy look in their eyes. <br/>
That&#39;s when I have to remember not to go into overkill!!! Of course my son <br/>
will just tell me that&#39;s enough he does&#39;t want to know anymore!!<br/>
<br/>
And as far as your 7 old goes, I can see where you have your hands full. But <br/>
why is it that you need her to learn when you want her too? Let her go, she <br/>
may take much longer than the older one to get into the swing of <br/>
unschooling. But my suspicion is she&#39;ll do it before you do!<br/>

Hi, Maria!<br/>
<br/>
Our son didn&#39;t want to learn to read and would put his unhappy face on <br/>
whenever we tried.  However, he got tired of waiting for someone to read <br/>
his Nintendo games (Mario) to him and started reading.  Now he can read <br/>
quite well.  Sometimes kids who have been in the public school system need <br/>
more time to de-school before they are ready to try things on their own.<br/>

Handbook which is a very good reference book for those starting out.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It can take time, weeks, months, sometimes even years, for children to <br/>
rediscover their natural curiosity, to adapt to the concept that what and <br/>
how they learn is up to them, to believe enough in their own abilities to <br/>
let themselves care deeply about what they do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if it&#39;s butterflies you&#39;re looking for, try the naturestore.com. Every <br/>
year we order butterflies from there as soon as our weather cools down. It&#39;s <br/>
getting to be around that time again.<br/>

you have to rid yourself of that &quot;teaching&quot; them mentality. You don&#39;t have <br/>
to teach them anything. Just let them vedge out from all the school stuff. <br/>
Let them do whatever they want to do. If it&#39;s watch TV all day, that&#39;s okay. <br/>
They will get to the point where they will start to learn, and want to on <br/>
their own. That&#39;s where the quote comes in at.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97813582">Hi Maria, Welcome to the list!<br/>
<br/>
My first advice to you about unschooling is, stop doing lessons! Think about<br/>
how you and all the adults around you learn new things. I do it by reading<br/>
interesting books (sometimes from the kids section of the store) looking for<br/>
TV programs that talk aboutthe topic, talking to others with experiences,<br/>
and actually DOing. All of this becasue it is something I am interested in.<br/>
Nobody makes up a leesson plan, nobody sets up a table ful of manipulatives<br/>
or asks me to write a report. I find the info **because I want to know<br/>
more**. I&#39;m curious and I actively seek out  the info on my own. Sometimes<br/>
DH will mention he met someone who does what I m learning about. Sometimes<br/>
Emily (dd)will point out a TV show, but for the most part, it&#39;s all from me.<br/>
Here&#39;s the hard part to believe when first finding unschooling. Your<br/>
daughters will do this too. When something is interesting, they will not<br/>
leave it alone until all their curiosity is satisfied. Sometimes that will<br/>
be one questioned answered, sometimes it will turn into a lifelong passion,<br/>
but mostly their interest level will fall somewhere between those two<br/>
levels.<br/>
We son&#39;t have to get in their way and set up unit studies, or write learning<br/>
objectives or set up hands on projects, in order to get them to learn. We<br/>
need to act as facilitators, rather than teachers. *offering* resources to<br/>
them but not requiring that they take them. Think about how you would let a<br/>
friend know you saw something related to a hobby they may have. Casually<br/>
mentioning it in passing or giving something as a gift. That&#39;s how we<br/>
unschoolers help our kids learn. And we do this because we love and care<br/>
about them, not because we feel that they &quot;should&quot; learn, they &quot;need to know<br/>
this&quot; or any of that school based nonsense.<br/>
Start allowing them (and YOU) to &quot;de-school&quot; let all those years of forced<br/>
learning be shed. Allow their natural curiosity and desire to learn shine<br/>
forth again. Spend the next couple of months playing with them, while you<br/>
learn how to see *natural* learning rather than forced temporary<br/>
memorization that is part of school and school at home.<br/>
Read lots of unschooling books and websites.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Maria! Welcome to the list! :o)<br/>
I wanted to say something. &lt;g&gt; I noticed you tend to use the words *lessons* <br/>
and *teach* and others like them a lot. With unschooling, you don&#39;t have to <br/>
use those words. You don&#39;t use lessons for hyper children or any children for <br/>
that matter. There are some really great books out there for you to read on <br/>
unschooling. Check some of them out from your library. Some other great <br/>
sources for information are places and people right here. Go to <br/>
unschooling.com and check out the library there! Tons of great articles to <br/>
read. The message boards are easy to navigate there as well. Go to <br/>
sandradodd.com/unschooling Sandra has lots of her articles posted. But above <br/>
all else, remember to let your kids play and have fun! You don&#39;t have to <br/>
worry about lessons! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959172393">**I think I let my oldest daughters succes blind me to how difficult it <br/>
  is for a child to learn.  Then I thought the school would have them <br/>
  reading.  Then I woke up and realized I best do something quick <br/>
  because the blasted school system DOESN&#39;T CARE if they can do <br/>
  anything, all they care about is &quot;Pass&quot; or &quot;Fail&quot; and on to the next <br/>
  student.  **<br/>
<br/>
Different kids can have really different ways that their brains work. <br/>
One book that I like is _How Your Child Is Smart_, which is by Dawna<br/>
Markova.  Howard Gardener and Thomas Armstrong (and someone else I<br/>
forget) have also written good books about the idea of &quot;multiple intelligences&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to persue this idea, you could go to Google.com and put in<br/>
&quot;multiple intelligences&quot; as a search phrase.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe someone else on the list here can remember the titles of other<br/>
books about learning styles.  (Is one of the other author&#39;s Sheila Tobias?)<br/>
<br/>
(from a different post)<br/>
**<br/>
She&#39;s very active, and I still haven&#39;t found any unschooling ideas <br/>
for a child that doesn&#39;t want to sit still for more than aminute, she <br/>
always has to gogogogogo.  Like right now, she&#39;s not paying rat race <br/>
any attention, she&#39;s got her hands and feet between the door posts <br/>
and is climbing up the doorway like a lil spidergirl.  PE will be no <br/>
problem for her, but I don&#39;t know if she can actually learn if she <br/>
can&#39;t even stay still long enough to listen to one sentence.  I can&#39;t <br/>
even read to her, because we&#39;ll be reading a book, and she&#39;ll look at <br/>
the pictures and get to wanting to go see a bird, or ride a bike, or <br/>
do anythign that is realted to the picture.**<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter does sound really kinesthetic.  Some kids like this can<br/>
listen fine if they are moving.  I&#39;ve heard of kids that listen to<br/>
stories while bouncing on a mini trampoline or spinning or swinging or<br/>
rocking in a rocking chair.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  In my husband&#39;s English textbooks that he taught from last year<br/>
there were always suggestions for letting kinesthetic learners get up<br/>
and do an interpretive dance as a book report.  I *really* didn&#39;t think<br/>
this was going to fly in a junior high school classroom, but maybe your<br/>
daughter would like to mime or dance a story as you read it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972882262"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What is deschool?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people use the word &quot;decompress&quot; from public school - it evokes the<br/>
gradual release of the pent up tensions and conflicts and ways of doing<br/>
things that have to be let go of. It&#39;s like dropping all the baggage you<br/>
are carrying before you can then run and jump and dance on your journey.<br/>
It seems like you have to decompress from your PS experience, just as<br/>
much as your delightful sounding kids. <br/>
<br/>
Remember, there is no hurry - once you are homeschooling, and especially<br/>
unschooling, the timetables of public school and society at large are<br/>
totally meaningless.<br/>

DETOX<br/>
by Barbara Frederick<br/>
<br/>
Someone once said that beginning to homeschool was like moving to another <br/>
country. In many ways, they were right. When traveling to another country, <br/>
it is important for all new citizens to take inoculations. When traveling <br/>
to Homeschooolland, it is necessary for all new citizens to &quot;detox&quot;--to rid <br/>
themselves of the deleterious effects that Publicschoolland has had on <br/>
their education.<br/>
<br/>
Before beginning this &quot;detox&quot; process, one must carefully analyze the <br/>
Learning environment that exists in Publicschoolland and take note of it&#39;s <br/>
inherent qualities. In Publicschoolland all of the citizens are carefully <br/>
controlled. All movement occurs at the sound of a bell. Performing <br/>
necessary bodily functions is discouraged, and access to the bathroom is <br/>
monitored by a teacher. The citizens are told what to learn, when to begin <br/>
learning, and when to stop learning. Failure to learn at the proscribed <br/>
pace (be it too slow or too fast) is punishable with failing grades and/or <br/>
sheer boredom. Citizens are not permitted to leave Publischoolland for 12 <br/>
years, unless they obtain an exit visa and travel to Homeschoolland. Once <br/>
Public- schoolland citizens obtain their exit visa, they will need help <br/>
acclimating themselves to the new learning environment of Homeschoolland.<br/>
<br/>
These new citizens will need the following things from The Homeschoolland <br/>
&quot;Consulate General&quot; (the parent) to aid in this &quot;detox&quot; process:<br/>
<br/>
1. Freedom. The freedom to move about during the day from one subject area <br/>
to another according to the citizen&#39;s own interests.<br/>
<br/>
2. Faith. Faith in the fact that human curiosity and intelligence need not <br/>
be &quot;stimulated&quot; in order for learning to take place.<br/>
<br/>
3. Patience. Patience during the entire &quot;detox&quot; time.<br/>
<br/>
4. Time. Time to distress from the regimented learning process. (This time <br/>
period can last anywhere from one month to one year).<br/>
<br/>
Upon arriving in Homeschoolland, new citizens often feel a little <br/>
disoriented and confused. In this first phase of &quot;detox&quot;, they will expect <br/>
a teacher to tell them everything that they need to know about a subject. <br/>
They may not know where to look to obtain knowledge for themselves. While <br/>
textbooks are familiar, the new citizen will, most likely, hold them in <br/>
contempt. Stay as far away from textbooks as possible during the &quot;detox&quot; <br/>
time. Allow the new citizens to fill their first days in Homeschoolland <br/>
with unstructured playtime and healthy, positive, social interaction with <br/>
siblings.<br/>
<br/>
When the new citizens express an interest in &quot;doing something&quot; or &quot;learning <br/>
about something&quot;, phase two of the &quot;detox&quot; process has already begun. <br/>
Respond gently and slowly to the citizens first tentative steps into <br/>
Homeschoolland. Share in their sense of wonder, as they begin to see all of <br/>
the learning possibilities that exist in Homeschoolland. The Consulate <br/>
General must reassure the citizens that he/she is &quot;here for them&quot; and will <br/>
help them find the information they need; without giving it to them. The <br/>
tricky part of phase two is keeping a clear head. The Consulate General <br/>
must resist all urges to &quot;teach&quot; or to make the new citizens &quot;get something <br/>
out of&quot; a teaching moment. The Consulate General may guide, encourage, and <br/>
cheer, but they should not contrive &quot;learning experiences&quot; or &quot;lesson <br/>
plans&quot;. Soon enough, the new citizens will be so &quot;stimulated&quot; by the <br/>
learning environment in Homeschoolland, that the Consulate General will <br/>
find it hard to keep up with them. When this happens, the citizens have <br/>
entered phase three of the &quot;detox&quot; process.<br/>
<br/>
Though the Consulate General will be tempted, he/she must not rush the new <br/>
citizens through phase three. This phase is the most important phase of the <br/>
&quot;detox&quot; and transition process. During this time, the citizens will be <br/>
rebuilding their fragile sense of self-esteem as well as relearning how to <br/>
learn. They may revert to easier tasks or simpler reading books, but do not <br/>
be alarmed. They are simply rediscovering the thirst for knowledge that <br/>
they had at a younger age--but were forbidden to quench in <br/>
Publicschoolland. Be Patient! Some citizens require more time than others <br/>
to &quot;detox&quot; and adjust to Homeschoolland.<br/>
<br/>
The Consulate General should use this &quot;detox&quot; time period to decide which <br/>
learning method, materials and approach will be most effective for the new <br/>
citizens. In the near future, the citizens will be willing and able to <br/>
offer input into this decision making process. When this happens, the <br/>
Consulate General will know that the &quot;detox&quot; process is complete.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the new citizens can relax and enjoy all of the educational <br/>
opportunities that Homeschoolland has to offer. Remember, Homeschoolland is <br/>
much more than a nice place to visit, it is a GREAT place to live!</div>

always unschooled. She never did any schoolwork of any kind until she <br/>

Laurie detested math and ended up taking three senior level <br/>
Statistics courses in college, just because she loved it. All A&#39;s. <br/>
She didn&#39;t need Statistics for her major. Oh, she also spent eight <br/>
years &quot;playing&quot; on the computer. She did nothing else but the <br/>
computer, even putting her obsession with books aside during those <br/>
years. When they decide they need to know something for their own <br/>
purposes, they&#39;ll learn it. And they&#39;ll learn it at an amazing speed.<br/>
<br/>
And you get to do anything you want to do! No more manipulating the <br/>
children to do what you think they need to do. Just let them be. It&#39;s <br/>
phenomenal. And giving them total trust will make them trust you, <br/>
which will be very helpful when they hit their teen years. Laurie and <br/>
I have always been best of friends. <br/>

long time for some to get it out of their systems that they can do as <br/>

I&#39;m 6 months into unschooling & LOVE it!  My daughter is 8.  I&#39;m <br/>
curious how your daughter went from no math (Other than &quot;life&quot; math) <br/>
to senior level statistics courses?  I&#39;m led to believe that she <br/>
would first need algebra, trig, calc, etc. before that.  Also, (I kno <br/>
this is premature) did your daughter get a &quot;diploma&quot; or complete her <br/>
GED before going onto college?  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is asking to do math out of books, she wants to keep up <br/>
with her school-age friends.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

&gt; always unschooled. She never did any schoolwork of any kind until <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; started college (her choice). Just let go of the school way of <br/>

&gt; Laurie detested math and ended up taking three senior level <br/>
&gt; Statistics courses in college, just because she loved it. All A&#39;s. <br/>
&gt; She didn&#39;t need Statistics for her major. Oh, she also spent eight <br/>
&gt; years &quot;playing&quot; on the computer. She did nothing else but the <br/>
&gt; computer, even putting her obsession with books aside during those <br/>
&gt; years. When they decide they need to know something for their own <br/>
&gt; purposes, they&#39;ll learn it. And they&#39;ll learn it at an amazing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>speed.<br/>

&gt; children to do what you think they need to do. Just let them be. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; phenomenal. And giving them total trust will make them trust you, <br/>
&gt; which will be very helpful when they hit their teen years. Laurie <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Her entire life, she wanted to know how to do math because she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to feel dumb. But she didn&#39;t want to know it bad enough to study <br/>
it. She asked my sister (a school teacher) to show her how to <br/>
understand Algebra when she was in her late teens. That lasted an <br/>
entire hour, I think. After a few tries, she quit trying and <br/>
concentrated on the computer. Then when she decided to go to college, <br/>
she knew that algebra was one of the subjects she would have to take. <br/>
She has no GED, no diploma. She took the college entrance exam and <br/>
scored high on the average. Top scores in English, Comprehension, <br/>
etc.. and barely scraping by in Math. So she took remedial math <br/>
classes (in college) and made all 100&#39;s. She found college to be so <br/>
easy that she made all A&#39;s. But she wasn&#39;t bored with the classes <br/>
like all the other students seemed to be. (I started college at the <br/>
same time and we had some classes together). She truly enjoys <br/>
learning. She had no preset notion of making all A&#39;s. She seldom even <br/>
thought about the grades, she just loved all topics, rarely studying. <br/>
She&#39;d hear it once and remember it. So, after the first semester when <br/>
she found she had all A&#39;s, she decided to try to keep the A average. <br/>
She went on to make an A in college algebra. Then she decided to try <br/>
Statistics because her remedial math professor was teaching it, and <br/>
she loved her remedial math professor. They are still close friends. <br/>
Anyway, she fell in love with statistics and just kept taking more.<br/>
 <br/>
I say if your daughter wants to do math, then let her. That&#39;s what <br/>
unschooling is all about.. letting them do what they want to do when <br/>
they want to do it. No manipulation required. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that helped.<br/>
Love, Valerie</div>

child! &lt;g&gt; I make a *date* with all my LIW books every year. I usually sit <br/>
down sometime after Christmas, when it is good and cold out and I want <br/>
nothing more than to curl up on the couch under my feather comforter. I read <br/>
through all the LIW books in a day or two. There is nothing I like better. I <br/>
even tried making those little cakes Laura described her mother making for <br/>

&gt; My 7 year old, I&#39;m about at my wits end now and can understand why <br/>
&gt; the teachers couldn&#39;t teach her.  She is SMART but WILL NOT apply <br/>
&gt; herself. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The teachers wanted her to apply herself in a school setting.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to do that anymore.  She will &quot;apply&quot; herself when she <br/>
is ready.  And the way she applies herself may look very different; <br/>
and it may come and go in spurts. <br/>
<br/>
 My son has loved dinasaurs since he was a toddler.  Since that time, <br/>
he has gone  through phases of being into them intensley, moving on <br/>
to other things, and coming back.  And he remembers all kinds of <br/>
things about them that I forgot, even though I read him tons of books <br/>
on dinasaurs.  <br/>
<br/>
Read up on deschooling, if you haven&#39;t already.  There is some great <br/>
stuff about it on www.unschooling.com message boards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 She knows how to tell time, but like this morning when I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; gave her the clock worksheets, she wrote down random numbers just <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get it done, then stomped off when I printed her 2 new worksheets <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; told her to do them right <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She has no need to write down the time.  She can *tell* time--that&#39;s <br/>
all she needs right now.  Can you think of a *real* reason she has to <br/>
do that?  I don&#39;t know if she learned to tell time &quot;formally&quot; but I&#39;m <br/>
guessing maybe she did.  Unschooling is about trusting she&#39;ll learn <br/>
to tell time because she wants to know what time Daddy gets home or <br/>
what time her favorite show is on, or on and on.  <br/>
<br/>
She already made it clear she did not want to do it. In what way is <br/>
asking her to do two more of them going to help?  If it were my dd,  <br/>
I couldn&#39;t imagine how it could helpful in any way. I would fear, <br/>
however, that she would learn that it is not ok to expresss <br/>
herslef or her true feelings--especially to me.  And this learning <br/>
will transfer to all things; from not wanting to share an interest <br/>
with me for fear that I would turn it into a unit study, to concerns <br/>
about her emerging sexuality.  And even if she does go ahead and do <br/>
the worksheets and &quot;learns&quot; what I think she should, that other <br/>
learning is still happening--and *that* is the learning that will <br/>
stick. <br/>
  <br/>
Examining these kinds of questions constantly--trying to live <br/>
mindfully--has helped me tremendously and, for me,is the key to <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My focus would be to help her say she didn&#39;t want to do it in a more <br/>
respectful way--but first she has to *truly trust* that it is ok to <br/>
do that. A common phrase of unschoolers is to &quot;Trust the Child.&quot;  For <br/>
me is also very much about fostering their trust in you. Building <br/>
that trust is my main goal of unschooling; but more than that, it is <br/>
my main goal of parenting--of building a relationship with my <br/>
children based on love and mutual trust and respect.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-because I knew she could do it.-=<br/>
<br/>
Knowing how to tell time and how to write time are two very different <br/>
things.  It doesn&#39;t follow that because she can tell time, she can <br/>
write it.  Even if she *can* do it, it may be a struggle for her and <br/>
one that is especially unpleasant because she doesn&#39;t have a need to <br/>
do it.  When she does--filling out party invitations, or keeping a <br/>
journal--she will. Trust.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; When we go our phonics flash cards, she won&#39;t even TRY to sound <br/>
 </span></blockquote>them <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; out, she just says whatever comes to mind first.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She doesn&#39;t want to and she will likely never want to.  That doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean in any way that she won&#39;t learn to read. She will learn to read <br/>
when she has a reason to, using the tools that will help *her*.  And <br/>
if you persist, she may learn to read in spite of or because of them, <br/>
but it is may very likely also learn that reading is no fun.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I am almost ready to give up, I&#39;m near tears and I DO NOT want my <br/>
&gt; daughter in that &quot;Special&quot; school.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you should give up the school at home and she doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
ever go to that &quot;Special&quot; school. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (They can read a lil, but not on thier grade levels).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are no more grade levels.  They are not in school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I let my oldest daughters succes blind me to how difficult <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is for a child to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s just that people learn in different ways. It&#39;s <br/>
interesting that if you look at program recommendations for <br/>
both &quot;challenged&quot; children and &quot;gifted&quot; children, they both emphasize <br/>
letting them follow their interests and learn in their own way.  It <br/>
seems to me pretty obviously to folllow that it&#39;s a good idea for all <br/>
children.  Read up on Howard Gardner&#39;s (It might be Gardener) <br/>
multiple <br/>
intelligences and on emotional intelligence.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And if they need a course or somethignt hat costs <br/>
 </span></blockquote>alot <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of money, I am more than willing to sell my truck to get it for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>them, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep the truck and take them places they want to go--the park, on <br/>
hikes, to visit grandma.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I need to know it&#39;s a course that will work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s called life and you&#39;re already enrolled.  You set the course <br/>
fees!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to go read more about this unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good idea!  It may take a while to shift paradigms so completely but <br/>
it is so freeing so worth it.  Good luck!<br/>
