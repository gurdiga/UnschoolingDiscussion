Really, the time keeps flying by faster and faster. If you can keep <br/>
yourslef and your own family busy---and keep the extended family at a <br/>

You can certainly collect a bunch of unschooling books and articles and <br/>
give them an assignment! &lt;g&gt; AFTER they read all of your books, *then* <br/>
they are at least minimally qualified to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
I told my sisters-in-law one day that *I* had been on both sides of the <br/>
fence---as a student, as a parent of a student, and as an unschooling <br/>
parent. *They* have only been students and parents of students. They <br/>
have absolutely *no* experience or knowledge of unschooling. They are <br/>
unqualified to even bring up the subject. I&#39;m very sure they talk about <br/>
me behind my back, but my children and I do not have to put up with <br/>
them anymore.<br/>

When Keith&#39;s parents were here last week, they wanted to go out to dinner and <br/>
had said so in advance, but Keith was on liquid diet in preparation for a <br/>
medical procedure the next morning.   <br/>
<br/>
I asked each of the kids if they&#39;d consider going out with grandma and <br/>
grandpa, and that they didn&#39;t have to, but I was going to stay home with Keith and <br/>
have chicken broth and jello.   I had hoped at least two would be willing to <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
Every one of my kids went.   Kirby (18) drove, because their vehicle didn&#39;t <br/>
hold five.   <br/>
They had said the kids should pick the restaurant.   They chose Twisters, a <br/>
mid-priced one, and the very nearest.   They had a good time, I heard.<br/>
<br/>
In very many families, I believe, the teen boys would&#39;ve found excuses to be <br/>
gone (and these guys usually ARE gone, so it would&#39;ve been honest).   They <br/>
planned around it.   <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the other grandkids are completely incommunicado as far as I know. <br/>
  They don&#39;t like their parents anymore, they&#39;re troublesome and sneaky and <br/>
angry.    <br/>
<br/>
Earlier predictions were that those other kids, by virtue of having strict <br/>
parents, going to school and going to church, would be &quot;good kids,&quot; while ours <br/>
were being ruined.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with the stick my nose in the air technique when someone is<br/>
being rude and condescending.  But I think what she&#39;s saying is that<br/>
they&#39;re loving, caring parents who genuinely just don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; and<br/>
are trying to be supportive and understanding but are concerned.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom is trying to be loving, caring, supportive, and understanding<br/>
(she really is a different person now that she&#39;s older, doesn&#39;t have<br/>
any kids living with her, and is on antidepressents. ;).  We generally<br/>
get along very well, and she for the most part keeps her mouth shut<br/>
when I do things she disagrees with.  <br/>
<br/>
She is, however, *very* concerned about my kids and unschooling. <br/>
Mostly that my just turned 8 year old isn&#39;t reading yet.  She just<br/>
expressed her concern to me again just last week, when she went to the<br/>
Harry Potter event at Barnes & Nobles with me and my kids.  She saw<br/>
that my son was very excited to get the book so that I could read it<br/>
to him, but she saw that as a negative, not a positive.  <br/>
<br/>
Her argument was this:  I did school at home with my now 12 year old<br/>
daughter, and taught her how to read when she was 4, and she<br/>
absolutely loves reading now.  When she was 8, she read all the time.<br/>
 &quot;But look at Matt, he&#39;s not reading at all, and he&#39;s eight&quot;, she<br/>
said. She said &quot;he&#39;s eight&quot; in a dramatic whisper, as if it was a<br/>
horrible, horrible tragedy that she couldn&#39;t bear to voice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve explained the unschooling philosophy to her several times.  I&#39;ve<br/>
emailed her links to a few of Sandra&#39;s articles.  Once I took the time<br/>
to give a lengthy explanation to a non-unschooling online friend about<br/>
unschooling and reading, and I copied and pasted it and sent it to her<br/>
with a friendly, &quot;Hey Mom, someone asked me about unschooling and<br/>
reading and I know you&#39;ve expressed concern about that aspect of<br/>
unschooling, so I thought you might enjoy the response I gave this<br/>
person&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
So this time I started to give her the &quot;he&#39;ll learn when he&#39;s ready&quot;<br/>
and &quot;look at all the cool things he IS doing&quot; etc, she interrupted me<br/>
and said, &quot;Yes, I know all that, I&#39;ve heard all those lines before,<br/>
and I know you do all kinds of good, interesting things that<br/>
contribute to their education.  But they NEED phonics and things like<br/>
basic math&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
All I could do at that point was stand my ground and disagree.  <br/>
<br/>
A few days later she stopped by to see Matt&#39;s hotwheels set that he<br/>
put together.  She had gotten it for him for his birthday.  While she<br/>
was there, I printed out some pages from the journal that I keep of<br/>
things my kids learn.  I picked some pages that showed some really<br/>
cool things about numbers and letters that they learned naturally, on<br/>
their own, while doing fun, interesting, non-schooly things.  I<br/>
thought for SURE she would be impressed at what they&#39;re learning and<br/>
understand.  I asked her today what she thought, and she acted like<br/>
she wasn&#39;t impressed.   <br/>
<br/>
My mother in law is equally concerned, mostly about the reading issue.<br/>
 People aren&#39;t as concerned about Alisha, because she can read.  But<br/>
the late reading is a huge hurdle for some people.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be easier if they were complete jerks who were rude to our<br/>
kids and don&#39;t care much about them.  But when you know that they<br/>
genuinely love their grandkids and are truly concerned, it&#39;s nice to<br/>
at least try to make them understand. I know that if my children<br/>
wanted to send my kids to public school and punish them if they didn&#39;t<br/>
make the honor roll, I wouldn&#39;t want them sticking their nose in the<br/>
air at me instead of talking it through with me. ;)  And I know my mom<br/>
does understand and accept more about unschooling than she used to. <br/>
Whether or not she ever will completely get it or not remains to be<br/>
seen.  There comes a point when you just have to accept that they<br/>
might never get it, and stand your ground.  If they&#39;re nice about it,<br/>
great.  If their concern turns into something not as nice, *then*<br/>
stick your nose in the air and say the proof is in the pudding. ;) <br/>

My ideas tend to be really flippant, so feel free to ignore them.<br/>
<br/>
What came to mind here, after her dramatic whisper &quot;he&#39;s not reading at <br/>
all and he&#39;s eight&quot;, would be to dramatically and cheerfully whisper <br/>
back &quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;He&#39;s really different.&quot;  &quot;But that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(But that would probably only work the first time she brought it up, not <br/>
the tenth or eleventh time!)<br/>
<br/>
**it&#39;s nice to<br/>
at least try to make them understand.**<br/>
<br/>
On the late reading thing, I tend to think that even if they understood <br/>
they would still worry.<br/>
