<div id="ygrps-yiv-188652243"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Lazybones and Sillygoose are cute <br/>
&gt; little names that convey caring and family&#39;ness&#39; to me. I see no<br/>
&gt; labeling and, most positively, no abuse.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose if one is in the habit of randomly calling all of the loved ones<br/>
in her life, lazybones, sillygoose, muffinhead, etc. (from the kids to her<br/>
husband to the dog, mixing up the names as a general thing -- sort of like I<br/>
call all rabbits in the barn &quot;fuzzy&quot;, but if I call one over and over again<br/>
&quot;snakebait&quot;, well, the rabbit doesn&#39;t mind, but my husband and kids know<br/>
that one&#39;s destiny &lt;g&gt;) It&#39;s different than singling one child out as &quot;lazy&quot;<br/>
and &quot;lazybones&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And, frankly, none of us are being paid a salary here. We have our own<br/>
opinions. If I just disagree that calling a child specifically &quot;lazy&quot; is an<br/>
okay thing, I am under no obligation to say it is. Nobody is following the<br/>
poster home or forcing her at knifepoint to continue the conversation. She<br/>
can opt out at any time it becomes too uncomfortable. In fact, knowing when<br/>
to stop arguing is a useful life skill, and one that believe it or not I<br/>
even practice on occasion. :)<br/>
<br/>
If we are the brick wall, it&#39;s kind of silly for her to keep hitting her<br/>
head against it unless she&#39;s enjoying it or getting something from it (which<br/>
she may be, and that&#39;s fine, too).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I joined the list in hopes of finding open minded parents.<br/>
&gt;  I have seen quite of bit of heavy handed criticism that is<br/>
&gt; disappointing to me... so many here seem to think the worst of each<br/>
&gt; other and pounce on mere &#39;semantics&#39;.<br/>
&gt; It seems counter productive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t find unschoolers more or less likely to be open-minded than any<br/>
other group. I am, in fact, downright closed-minded on some things. :)<br/>
<br/>
And the reason people pounce on &quot;semantics&quot; (i.e, words) is that words are<br/>
all we have here. Clear communication is critical for people to understand<br/>
what you are trying to convey in a written forum. Fuzzy logic, imprecise<br/>
language, these do not help us understand each other&#39;s thoughts in this<br/>
medium.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966004211"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My 5 yr old son, however, still does not <br/>
&gt; even recgonize his letters. He doesn&#39;t know how to tie shoes, he <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t know how to spread peanut butter on a piece of bread. He is <br/>
&gt; lazy - does not want to try anything new that might take effort. His <br/>
&gt; favorite sayings are &quot;it&#39;s too hard&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is from the first post about &quot;lazy&quot;.  <br/>
This is harsh.<br/>
The later explanations that lazy is an affectionate term came after<br/>
responses to this first post.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not sitting here thinking this mother doesn&#39;t love her son.  I&#39;m<br/>
just thinking there are better ways to think about and talk about our<br/>
children that will not harm them.  <br/>
<br/>
And even if &quot;lazy&quot; in this family is all cutesy and nice it isn&#39;t to the<br/>
rest of the world, where her little boy will someday be around people who<br/>
give him a different idea about &quot;lazy&quot; and  where he will be developing<br/>
ideas about himself as a person and his worth on this planet.  <br/>
