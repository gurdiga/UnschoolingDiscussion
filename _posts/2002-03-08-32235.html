<div id="ygrps-yiv-163373866">Hi I homeschool my youngest child age 6 and encourage additional <br/>
reading by my older kids age 12 and 16. Here are some books I found <br/>
to promote 2 different theories on dealing with the religious nature <br/>
of our country today.<br/>
<br/>
theory 1 for younger children<br/>
dilute the word &quot;god&quot; by presenting all the ancient gods and their <br/>
myths to your atheist child emphasizing how at that time people <br/>
believed in these gods so much to kill and be killed for them. <br/>
Explain that as science advanced we were able to understand more <br/>
about the world around us and as we did we realized that we didnt <br/>
need to make up gods and goddesses to explain nature. Presenting many <br/>
gods just makes it so when others talk about god to your child the <br/>
child just categorizes it with all the other ones YOU controled the <br/>
topic of. They easily dismiss god as a fairy tale.<br/>
<br/>
One part of this theory I am on the fence about is Santa, havent <br/>
decided on that one yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
theory2 for older kids<br/>
<br/>
Give them the knowledge to back up their belief system. They need <br/>
facts and theory to not fall victim of wanting to follow a crowd by <br/>
not being able to defend their thoughts with answers that will stand <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found some books for all my childrens age groups at amazon.com and <br/>
decided to share my finds with those interested.<br/>
