<div id="ygrps-yiv-501707355">I&#39;ll introduce myself now after a couple of months of<br/>
lurking, because I wanted to respond to this post.<br/>
<br/>
I have one 9yo son, newly withdrawn from school and<br/>
unschooling. He&#39;s gone to school off and on for the<br/>
last few years, some his choice and some mine for a<br/>
variety of reasons I may or may not be up to<br/>
discussing later. I was a radical (rabid?) unschooler<br/>
before he went to school. This list has been<br/>
fantastically helpful to me in both helping me come<br/>
back to my &quot;roots,&quot; so to speak, and also helping me<br/>
understand and live unschooling in a much deeper, more<br/>
meaningful way than I ever could before even when I<br/>
was writing articles about unschooling and haranguing<br/>
people on a regular basis about how great unschooling<br/>
is. I&#39;d like to thank you all for your thoughtfulness<br/>
and mindfulness, and willingness to share it with<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Kristi&#39;s post about talking honestly with your kids<br/>
about school really resonated with me. There&#39;s a woman<br/>
in my area, a well known unschooler with grown kids<br/>
who&#39;s written books about unschooling. She constantly<br/>
tells the story of how, when her daughter wanted to go<br/>
to school, she would sit her down at the kitchen table<br/>
and, as one poster described, not let her get up to go<br/>
to the bathroom or get a drink, basically make school<br/>
seem as miserable as possible.<br/>
<br/>
It always bothered me a lot, even when I was most<br/>
opposed to kids going to school. The analogy I&#39;ve come<br/>
up with is, what if your kid started asking if she<br/>
could go see a movie? Would you say, &quot;Oh, you think<br/>
you want to see a movie, huh? Well, just sit down<br/>
there and I&#39;ll show you what a movie is like.&quot; You<br/>
stick her in a plush seat, turn off all the lights,<br/>
make her sit still and be quiet for two hours, and . .<br/>
. DON&#39;T show her the movie. Then you say with<br/>
satisfaction . . . &quot;And she never asked to see a movie<br/>
again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of really good reasons for kids not to<br/>
go to school. Resorting to an essentially dishonest<br/>
argument, tricking kids into thinking that a minor<br/>
inconvenience (which may or may not even be real -- in<br/>
my son&#39;s classroom you could go get a drink of water<br/>
or go to the bathroom any time you wanted, or carry a<br/>
water bottle if you wanted) is the sum total of what<br/>
school is about, is really doing both you and your<br/>
kids a disservice. It&#39;s just as dishonest to stress<br/>
only the negative parts of school as it is to be like<br/>
Barney and make school seem like an earthly paradise. <br/>
<br/>
Why not talk honestly with your kids about school?<br/>
Talk about your own school days, what you liked, what<br/>
you didn&#39;t? Talk about why you think what you do at<br/>
home is a lot more interesting and valuable -- and at<br/>
the same time acknowledge that you understand what<br/>
kids might feel like they&#39;re missing? Try to find out<br/>
what it&#39;s really like at the school in your<br/>
neighborhood -- the routine, the atmosphere -- and<br/>
discuss what the pros and cons of going to school<br/>
might be, without any scare tactics?<br/>
<br/>
And if after a thorough, honest discussion your child<br/>
still feels she wants to go to school -- well, that<br/>
tells you something, doesn&#39;t it, about your child and<br/>
her needs and desires that you didn&#39;t know before. If<br/>
you really think it will be irremediably harmful to<br/>
her, you could still choose not to let her go, and try<br/>
to meet those needs in other ways. It would probably<br/>
be easier than before since with all your honest<br/>
discussions about school you know your child better.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could let her try it out, and keep<br/>
communicating honestly and unjudgmentally with her<br/>
about her experiences there, what she likes, what she<br/>
doesn&#39;t. You could support her in her decision to let<br/>
her learn how she wants, while letting her know that<br/>
she can come home any time she wants -- for a day, a<br/>
week or forever -- and you will be thrilled to have<br/>
her. Keep home a really interesting, safe, loving<br/>
place. Take her side in any conflicts she has with the<br/>
school, while keeping in mind that she may have<br/>
important relationships with adults there that she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want damaged. <br/>
<br/>
School has a lot less power to hurt kids when parents<br/>
aren&#39;t on its side, when kids know they can leave<br/>
anytime, they can pick and choose which parts of it<br/>
they want to do, they can have bad feelings about<br/>
parts of it and no one will shame them for them. Then<br/>
it becomes pretty much like just another<br/>
&quot;extracurricular&quot; experience -- you stay around as<br/>
long as it&#39;s still valuable to you, as long as the<br/>
benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and leave when that&#39;s<br/>
no longer true.<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is just to have kids say, &quot;You&#39;re right,<br/>
Mom, school is bad,&quot; then sure, go ahead and scare<br/>
them into it. If the goal is actually to find out<br/>
something about your kids and what they want, I think<br/>
you have to be more honest.<br/>

<br/>
When Holly wanted to &quot;do school&quot; that long ago season, I would just say &quot;If <br/>
you were in school you&#39;d have to do this for 45 minutes, and wait until the <br/>
others finished if you finished early.&quot;  She&#39;d just laugh and say she was tired <br/>
of it now and take off.  I&#39;d certainly let her go, because I wanted to be a <br/>
teacher WAY less than she wanted to be a student! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say I&#39;m not relieved, though, every time she decides not to go to <br/>
school.  But she is more curious than the other kids, and partly I think because <br/>
she&#39;s a girl and has no sister and is the youngest and has the same curiosity <br/>
I had (have) about who&#39;s doing what and why and what they think about it.<br/>
<br/>
She might yet end up in school at some point, and if so she&#39;ll probably do a <br/>
good job of it.  She would probably also get harder and snappy (in a bad way) <br/>
and preoccupied with school stuff and impatient with my lack of <br/>
attention/dedication to schoolishness.  That&#39;s my fear, anyway.  One of them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

business and go as far as involving Social Services, etc.  I agree with the talking <br/>
it through honestly because scare tactics are hurtful, harmful, and highly <br/>
dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
If a child really wants to take classes, I&#39;d try for community center classes <br/>
that you can choose together. <br/>

I can see this being a problem.  Locally -- well, actually state-wide -- a big fuss is being made over school truancy.  There are truancy police in the Malls, parents have been hauled into truancy court because a genuinely ill child missed too much school, and so on.  Already, it&#39;s been suggested that people could call themselves homeschoolers just to cover up their negligence in allowing their kids to be truant.  I&#39;m concerned that if we were to start drifting in and out of the system, we&#39;d been seen as negligent parents who simply want to &#39;excuse&#39; the kid&#39;s truancy and lax attendance.<br/>
 <br/>
Besides that, if your kid&#39;s not there on the day they dole out money (day 40, is it?) the school district doesn&#39;t really want them showing up later.  As if we don&#39;t pay the same taxes as all the parents whose kids are in school.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a big sore spot with us.  We are in VA and the state says we cannot <br/>
particpate in extracurricular activities and use the libraries, etc.  Not that I <br/>
care to.  But we still pay taxes.  Some states allow full access to the <br/>
schools and have no problems with it.  My son is choosing to stay in Kindergarten <br/>
right now until the end, on the 18th.  He has it circled in RED so he knows <br/>
when it&#39;s coming, he has enjoyed it but we have talked about next year being <br/>
full-day and that he&#39;ll eat there and he knew right away that he didn&#39;t want to go <br/>
back.  They have started training the K&#39;s for 1st grade and he doesn&#39;t like <br/>
it one bit.  Which is a major relief to me.  Anyway, his school is very strict <br/>
on attendence and being tardy is almost as bad.  I know a friend of mine who <br/>
lives a few hours from us, her child (9) was playing outside and because he was <br/>
not on their property, he was considered truant and they have had to deal <br/>
with Social Services ever since and that was 18 months ago.  I know when mine <br/>
started Kindergarten this year that I had made the worst mistake of my life but I <br/>
had chickened out on being responsible for his future, I got back on track <br/>
but by then he was choosing to stay so we have hung tough, but it is amazingly <br/>
hard.  I felt so exposed when they sent home papers asking us our marital <br/>
status, social security numbers, birth records, incomes, etc., etc.  All for their <br/>
taxes.  YUCK!!!<br/>

<br/>
That is such a loving, sweet take on public or private school.<br/>
Unfortunately, I feel it is a bit idyllic.  A child cannot go home whenever<br/>
he or she wants. Even when my nephew was having asthama and wanted the<br/>
school to call his mom, the school &#39;assessed the situation and decided the<br/>
call was unwarranted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When your children are in public school (2 of my kids have been), the parent<br/>
looses the ability to parent the child while the child is on the school<br/>
premises.  Sometimes depending on the teacher there is collaboration, but<br/>
most often the rules, attendance requirements (a tardy officer from the<br/>
state may visit your home), discipline (you missed the work while you were<br/>
out yesterday, so no recess for you) are in motion whether you as a parent<br/>
are aware of it or not.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My view is that if you are uncoiling, then do it.  That encompasses a<br/>
certain &quot;lifestyle&quot; in which you support your children in perusing their<br/>
goals.   If your children are in public school, as a parent you must do the<br/>
same; make sure they are there on time, have money or a sack lunch ready,<br/>
help them have a place for homework (20 min. per grade, excluding spelling<br/>
practice and extra projects) and give them the support to finish projects on<br/>
time, etc...  The child will suffer at public school if the parent is not<br/>
involved.  For unschooling families, the involvement may be too intrusive.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids do NOT want to go back to public school.  They experienced it.  I do<br/>
agree with you that for children who want to experience school, the parent<br/>
should support the child&#39;s decision.  But be aware: the decision has &#39;rules&#39;<br/>
attached to it that may affect the parent&#39;s role.<br/>

It&#39;s not who pays, it&#39;s how it&#39;s distributed that should be revamped to make <br/>
things more fair for everyone (and to give schools more funding even though <br/>
homeschoolers aren&#39;t there).  <br/>
<br/>
If schools got funding by the tax base or population base instead of by <br/>
enrollment, they would be GLAD to have fewer students and the same amount of money <br/>
as if they had lots.  That would be the greatest boon to unschooling of all, <br/>
to give the schools ALL POSSIBLE FUNDS and let them have a smaller group to <br/>
spend them on.   We&#39;d still be out, but they wouldn&#39;t be wingeing about it.<br/>

etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not real clear on the distribution of funds but I know that our schools <br/>
lose a major chunk on the food side.  USDA funds are cut per kid that does not <br/>
register for school.  I&#39;m probably not explaining that right but a friend of <br/>
mine in the superintendents&#39; office said that some districts get really sore <br/>
when they get more notices of intent because the budget is cut.  If it&#39;s gonna <br/>
happen, they hope it will happen during the year and not before because then <br/>
they already have the funds.<br/>
