<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192089171">I sometimes want a light cover on even if its hot.. but never covering me up <br/>
completely..just tossed over me.  But I can also sleep nude on top of the <br/>
covers and snooze all night  Now, I do like to snuggle up in heavy and comfy <br/>
covers when its cold.  <br/>
