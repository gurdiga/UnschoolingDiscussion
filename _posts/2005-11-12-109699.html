<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554602752">Hi:<br/>
<br/>
We live in a very exclusive area in So. Cal, where education is very <br/>
important and most of our schools are Distinguished schools.  My <br/>
husband and I moved here to give our children a chance at life <br/>
through this so called great school system.<br/>
<br/>
By the time our dd was in 3rd grade she was begging us to homeschool <br/>
her.  She was completely bored in school and she hated the bullying <br/>
by the other girls.  Even her teacher told me at her conference that <br/>
her problem was boredom because she knew all the material he was <br/>
teaching.<br/>
<br/>
We brought her home and tried to teach her the best we could.  I <br/>
read several books, attended seminars and talked with other <br/>
homeschoolers.  We must have gone through 8 or 9 different <br/>
curriculums over that year or so.  My dd became increasing <br/>
frustrated and was beginning to hate not only the school work but <br/>
she was withdrawing from me. <br/>
<br/>
But last year through some unfortunate events in our life I had to <br/>
stopped &quot;schooling&quot;  her.  Then I found a great book &quot;the unschooled <br/>
handbook&quot;.  That book changed our life forever.  Since that time I <br/>
have read several of Holt&#39;s books, Ren&#39;s book and several others.<br/>
<br/>
The relationship with my dd is on the mend, we have grown closer and <br/>
she has learned things on her own.  She may not be learning what her <br/>
peers in PS are, but my little 11 yo dd can design a website with <br/>
graphics, has learned to type and is much more self confident today <br/>
than a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
Michael, my dd doesn&#39;t need someone to tell her what or who to <br/>
study.  She will get what she needs, when she needs it and will find <br/>
her own way to contribute to society with me and her father at her <br/>
side cheering her own.<br/>

<br/>
Easy mistake. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something   recent of Ren&#39;s (mindful parenting), and then something a <br/>
bit older (how she went from TV controls to loosening up, and the benefits she <br/>
found):<br/>
