I&#39;ve heard WAY too many kids&#39; moms say to them, &quot;Here, let me do that.&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m days behind as we were in Tampa for the week (Thanks to those of you for <br/>
all the tips on where to go. We had a GREAT time!).<br/>
<br/>
The worst example I&#39;ve witnessed if this was at a little girl&#39;s birthday <br/>
party. I think she was six. Her mother lit the candles of her cake, carried it <br/>
over to the waiting birthday girl while we sang. <br/>
<br/>
The MOM then blew out the candles!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Liza&#39;s face turned white and tear-y. (Mine was RED! But I was tongue-tied!) <br/>
Mom cut the cake and the party continued, but I was totally stunned.I STILL <br/>
can&#39;t get over it! <br/>
<br/>
Poor Liza.<br/>

I really struggled with this when my kids were in school and I was a room mother.  I felt that the kids should be allowed to do the best they could, no matter what....on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Other room parents and often the teacher felt that we had to impress the parents, so some of them would just take over for the kids.<br/>
