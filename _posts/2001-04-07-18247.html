&gt; &lt;&lt;  And what<br/>
&gt; is supposed to be the scientific explanation of the increase in cesareans<br/>
&gt; among inter-racial parents? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Different size babies than that race left to itself would have produced.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s what I heard, from a midwife.  That in cultures wihtout intermarriage<br/>
&gt; CPD is unheard of.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***Okay, the only cases of &quot;CPD&quot; I&#39;ve ever heard of were of couples the same<br/>
&gt; race. (CPD meaning the pelvis is too small for the mother to birth the<br/>
&gt; baby.) Thing is, CPD is used as a huge excuse to hurry up the delivery. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; heard of doctors saying &quot;The baby was in there &#39;funny&#39;&quot; or &quot;You don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to be in pain, do you?&quot; (like c-sections...surgery...doesn&#39;t hurt?) and even<br/>
&gt; &quot;We could be here all night&quot; (those pesky babies, taking more than 8 hours<br/>
&gt; to be born). So they say, it&#39;s CPD, it&#39;s out of our hands, we have to do<br/>
&gt; this. And this is generally after a whole bunch of intervention already:<br/>
&gt; being connected to machines and given drugs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My midwife, who&#39;s assisted with over 2000 babies over the past 25 years<br/>
&gt; never said anything about inter-racial couples having trouble with birthing..<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll email and ask her, though. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. The only<br/>
&gt; person I know who truly had a pelvis too small to birth vaginally is my sil..<br/>
&gt; She grew up poor in Europe and had lousy health care. So she didn&#39;t develop<br/>
&gt; as well as she should have. She married within her &quot;race&quot; to a man of normal<br/>
&gt; proportion. Their babies were healthy and not too large, but there was no<br/>
&gt; way they could get past her pelvic bone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The inter-racial couples I know (black/white, Asian/white) had no problem.<br/>
&gt; If CPD is &quot;unheard of&quot; in cultures without inter-racial marriage perhaps<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s because those countries have better birthing practices?<br/>
