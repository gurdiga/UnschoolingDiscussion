<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500829811">Well, I picked up my &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; today. <br/>
<br/>
I had planned to get another one of the ones suggested. Wont you know it B & <br/>
N did not have any, not even the extra teach your own that I had asked that <br/>
they get. Gesh!<br/>
<br/>
So I placed another order and will wait the two weeks (they say 3-5 but its <br/>
been almost 2 weeks a couple times now).<br/>
<br/>
When I came home I looked at my receipt and was thrilled and guilt ridden at <br/>
the same time. The lady at the capachino stand (mind blank on the name of the <br/>
coffee) took the<br/>
 on-hold paper off my book but never scanned it!  Could be me but I thought <br/>
there was something strange about the transaction.  <br/>
Was this an accident? <br/>
Did we look poor? (My kids are very well dressed, I am in jeans and sneakers <br/>
but they are clean and always a Polo) I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
Did she know we where HS/Unschoolers? Was she Homeschooled?<br/>
Does she hate her job?<br/>
Did she just miss it?<br/>
My gosh I am driving my self nuts. I keep thinking when we left the store we <br/>
could have been accused of shoplifting. UGH!<br/>
&quot;ATTENTION B & N CUSTOMERS&quot;<br/>
&quot;Homeschool Mother lifts book at B & N while shopping with her three <br/>
children&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am not going back there tomorrow but when my other book come in I will give <br/>
them the money. <br/>
Strange thing is my husband came home and told me his cruel boss is doing pay <br/>
cuts on the bonus program again to the toll of -1000.00 a month.<br/>
<br/>
Coincidence? Do do Do do Do do Do do (twilight song)<br/>
