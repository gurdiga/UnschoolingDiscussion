<div id="ygrps-yiv-711224900">I&#39;ve just replied to several posts that went on and on and on and on, and <br/>
included every post they were responding to.  It seems to take ages to get <br/>
the cursor all the way down to the bottom of the post.  This is only mildly <br/>
annoying to me, as I try to clip off all the excess junk.  But I imagine <br/>
it&#39;s no fun at all for the digest readers.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t hard to clip your posts.  In Eudora, I can highlight the part I <br/>
want to reply to and then click reply.  Only the part I highlighted will <br/>
appear.  I don&#39;t know how to do it in other programs, but it&#39;s easy to <br/>
simply highlight and delete all the stuff that isn&#39;t needed before hitting <br/>
send.  The digest readers will love you for it.<br/>

I&#39;ve been getting &quot;the blue screen of death&quot; using Netscape lately since<br/>
I had too many emails in some of my folders - I finally figured that out<br/>
after several days of seeing TBSOD.  I&#39;m ready to change.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
to move to Outlook since a) I prefer not using a Microsoft product if<br/>
I can avoid it and b) it has so many virus attacks on it.<br/>
<br/>
I will be running a Windows system (I&#39;m getting myself a new computer soon;<br/>
this one is 4 years old and then I won&#39;t have to share as much with my<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been using Eudora for years and like it.  The only thing it doesn&#39;t do <br/>
that I wish it did is allow me to change the subject lines before <br/>
saving.  I&#39;ve started getting around that by forwarding the message to <br/>
myself with a new subject line that clearly shows what&#39;s inside.  That&#39;s a <br/>
bit of a hassle, but I can live with it.  It doesn&#39;t seem to have a problem <br/>
with huge numbers of saved emails.  I don&#39;t have many on this machine, <br/>
because I&#39;m about to switch back to the other one, which has probably <br/>
thousands.<br/>
<br/>
The other program that I&#39;ve heard people say they like is Pegasus, but I&#39;ve <br/>
never tried it.<br/>

I tried one called PocoMail that I found at Tucows not too long ago and it was good imo. I&#39;m no expert in this area, though, so you might discover something about it that went right over my head.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169256054">If you do the following setting for Outlook, it is as safer or safer than<br/>
most programs and even safer if you have a good firewall.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
First thing to do is get rid of the Windows Scripting Host, this applies<br/>
 to everyone using Windows no matter what email program. The Scripting<br/>
 Host isn&#39;t used or needed by 99.9% of users and essentially is used like<br/>
 the old DOS batch files but on steroids .. if you don&#39;t know what it<br/>
 does or have never used it then you don&#39;t need it and won&#39;t miss it....<br/>
 to remove:<br/>
<br/>
 Go to Start Button --&gt;Settings --&gt;Control Panel --&gt;Add/Remove<br/>
 Programs --&gt; select Windows Setup tab --&gt;highlight Accessories --&gt; click<br/>
 on Details button --&gt; look for the entry towards the bottom of the list<br/>
 that says Windows Scripting Host and remove the check next to it --&gt; hit<br/>
 the OK buttons until you are out of the Control Panel.<br/>
<br/>
 To secure Outlook Express:<br/>
<br/>
 Start up Outlook Express and Internet Explorer, 1st go to Internet<br/>
 Explorer to set up the Secure Zones:<br/>
<br/>
 Select Tools from the top menu bar --&gt; Options --&gt; Security tab --&gt;<br/>
 highlight Restricted Zones --&gt; click Custom Level button<br/>
 You&#39;ll see a window with several sections with options in each section,<br/>
 ActiveX Controls and Plugins - disable everything<br/>
 Cookies - disable everything<br/>
 Downloads - disable everything<br/>
 Microsoft VM - Disable or High Safety<br/>
 Miscellaneous - Disable everything but<br/>
                             Drag and Drop or Copy and Paste - set to Prompt<br/>
                             Software Channel Permissions - High safety<br/>
 Scripting - Disable everything<br/>
 Hit OK buttons until out<br/>
<br/>
 Go to Outlook Express:<br/>
 Choose Tools from the upper menu bar --&gt; Options --&gt; Security tab --&gt;in<br/>
 the Security Zones section check the box next to Restricted Zones --&gt;<br/>
 hit OK buttons until out<br/>
<br/>
 And that&#39;s it, this will keep scripts, ActiveX control and Java from<br/>
 executing on there own, and you will be as secure or more secure than<br/>
 with any other email program. Remember though you still have to watch<br/>
 out to not execute virus/worms that are sent as attachments(although<br/>
 these security settings will stop several scripted virus/worms if<br/>
 clicked on) but a good virus scanner *should* pick them up as long as<br/>
 you keep the virus definitions updated (I do mine once a week or when a<br/>
 virus alert goes out) You can download a couple of really good<br/>
 completely FREE ones here:<br/>

break into, too easy to make worms and virus for and way too easy to <br/>
back door into someone&#39;s computer.<br/>
<br/>
If MS has spent more of their resources on writing good code instead <br/>
of their awesome marketing strategies in the past 15 years, they&#39;d <br/>
have a good product.<br/>
<br/>
Besides all that personal info that MS sends back under the guise <br/>
of &#39;piracy prevention&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
But as life has it, its not always the better product that ends up in <br/>
mainstream usage (or the schooling!!).<br/>
<br/>
I use a Macintosh (Linux and Unix on occasion) and am still using <br/>
Claris Emailer from ancient times. It works damn good and I don&#39;t <br/>
worry about all those nasty virus and worms that everyone sends <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
Eudora would be my second choice.<br/>
<br/>
Outlook has upgraded their so easily hackable code, but its still <br/>
inferior and open for attacks.<br/>
