<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855177963">Ok, I&#39;m jumping in on the end of the &quot;Can a religious family unschool?&quot; <br/>
thread.<br/>
<br/>
My answer is a strong yes.  My kids absolutely love the kids activities at <br/>
church.  Our church has made kids a priority in that they were going to enjoy <br/>
church.  <br/>
<br/>
When my oldest kid turned 18, he didn&#39;t want to go to church, that was fine <br/>
with us as parents, he&#39;s 18, a grown adult.  I didn&#39;t say a word, I let my <br/>
faith speak through my lifestyle.  Yes, I pray to my Lord, but I don&#39;t &quot;plead&quot; to <br/>
my kid.  When he came home on break, he assisted in getting his younger <br/>
brother and sister to their activities, and he still enjoys the Bible Quiz team and <br/>
helps out.<br/>
