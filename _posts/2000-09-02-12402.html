&gt; Okay so DH and I have very different veiws on how to handle certain <br/>
&gt; situations with the children. He thinks that we need to use more <br/>
&gt; corporal punishment in the form of a switch, that the hand isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; enough. Not that I use my hand often, but I do believe there is a <br/>
&gt; time and a place for it and it is always a last resort. The last time <br/>
&gt; and only time that I seriously used my hand on either of the children <br/>
&gt; was when DS ran off in the mall and I couldn&#39;t find him. He was <br/>
&gt; almost 4 at the time. Anyway, to make a long story short, I had <br/>
&gt; security looking for him for 15-20 min. When they found him I bawled <br/>
&gt; like a baby, held him in my arms then took him to the bathroom and <br/>
&gt; spanked his bare bum till my hand hurt, not out of anger but out of <br/>
&gt; love. I wanted him to understand how serious it is that he not run <br/>
&gt; off like that. Then I explained to him how scared I was and how much <br/>
&gt; I loved him and sat there in the stall just holding him close for a <br/>
&gt; while. Needless to say he has never run off in any store again. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as DH and I go I have always believed more in the lines of <br/>
&gt; Love and Logic and DH believes more along the lines of coersion and <br/>
&gt; force much like the ps uses. So my question is does anyone have any <br/>
&gt; suggestions as to how to handle situations that arrise when DH is <br/>
&gt; dealing with the children in a manner that I totally disagree with <br/>
&gt; and the children aren&#39;t used to, simply because they are use to the <br/>
&gt; way I handle things since I am the one who is home all day and night <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589497292">Hi Corallyn;<br/>
<br/>
I know it won&#39;t go over well to discuss this but as with all parenting<br/>
issues we need to educate, sensitize and address even the most difficult<br/>
topics.  We owe it to ourselves as parents and have the moral OBLIGATION<br/>
to constantly scrutinize ourselves and our choices to ensure we are<br/>
always offering our children the VERY BEST we can give.  To not discuss<br/>
these very personal topics amongst other parents from whom we may learn,<br/>
is to deny the most basic resource we have for education...each other!<br/>
<br/>
Regardless where one stands on the spanking issue, I think few would<br/>
argue that corporal punishment with actual &quot;weapons&quot; (ie. belts,<br/>
switches, rods etc.) is excessive.  That IS abuse.  Ask any doctor,<br/>
lawyer, social worker, or parenting expert.  Some extremist religious<br/>
groups defend the use of &quot;weapons&quot; based on misinterpretation of<br/>
scripture.  My husband is a clergyman (and a &quot;traditional&quot; one at that!)<br/>
and this question comes up regularly.  We also have concerns over a<br/>
&quot;bare bottom&quot; spanking as it can confuse a child sexually and especially<br/>
for an older child is further humiliation that can go beyond repair. <br/>
This is by far NOT what God intended for his greatest gifts - children! <br/>
And for those non-religious types who exert control by means of corporal<br/>
punishment, it happens either simply from lack of knowledge or because<br/>
&quot;it was done to them when they were a kid&quot;.  The real issue here is not<br/>
that of disciplining a child so much as it is about an adult raging and<br/>
needing some anger management assistance.  Sure kids defy authority, and<br/>
sure parents get darned frustrated, and there&#39;s no argument that<br/>
parenting is the toughest job out there, but excessively attacking<br/>
children only creates resentment and breaks down families.  The day<br/>
inevitably comes when the bomb explodes and the so-called discipline<br/>
backfires in the parent&#39;s face, one way or another.  It happens every<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not meaning to insult or judge your situation Corallyn, and my heart<br/>
goes out to you if you are in a situation of conflict to resolve this<br/>
with your husband and family.  The answers won&#39;t be easy...they never<br/>
are for the really tough and worthwhile questions.  I know it&#39;s easier<br/>
said than done but would your husband entertain talking to someone about<br/>
this?  He can get some answers to his parenting questions through<br/>
community parenting groups, a health clinic, the library, or other<br/>
parents etc.<br/>
<br/>
Above all else, since you are as you said, &quot;the primary care giver to<br/>
your children&quot;, show your babies unconditional love.  Hug and kiss each<br/>
of them every day so they have a sense of security and stability.  That<br/>
will be your greatest disciplinary tool.  Try not to have unrealistic<br/>
expectations of yourself or your children.  They ARE children after all<br/>
because they do make mistakes when they are learning and growing and not<br/>
every mistake needs necessarily to be disciplined.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I haven&#39;t offended you.  I support and respect you or any other<br/>
parent who is willing to learn and self-improve.  I know this is an<br/>
issue some people don&#39;t want to touch on this list but I wanted to<br/>
repond to your question.<br/>
<br/>
This is the one great thing I like more than just about anything else on<br/>
this list.  I LOVE having the resource of so many other parents to learn<br/>
from and to receive support from.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-142569362">Hi Lynda;<br/>
<br/>
I can understand your hesitancy to repetitively review the same<br/>
parenting issues over and over again but aren&#39;t we all here to learn? <br/>
And can we not learn from each other?  As a reminder to the<br/>
long-established members of this list, let us not forget that this list<br/>
is constantly changing and new members are joining all the time.  It is<br/>
in our best interest to repeat some discussions not only for the new<br/>
members who haven&#39;t been involved in previous discussion but also to the<br/>
old stand-bys.  As time goes on don&#39;t we all grow and change?  Maybe<br/>
since the last discussion someone has a fresh viewpoint based on some<br/>
new report/book/experience one has been exposed to.  I know how awkward<br/>
and controversial some of these discussions can be, but this list has<br/>
such potential as a parenting tool.  Could we tolerate the opportunities<br/>
as they arise?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much to everyone!  With much appreciation,<br/>

&gt; Hi Lynda;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can understand your hesitancy to repetitively review the same<br/>
&gt; parenting issues over and over again but aren&#39;t we all here to learn? <br/>
&gt; And can we not learn from each other?  As a reminder to the<br/>
&gt; long-established members of this list, let us not forget that this list<br/>
&gt; is constantly changing and new members are joining all the time.  It is<br/>
&gt; in our best interest to repeat some discussions not only for the new<br/>
&gt; members who haven&#39;t been involved in previous discussion but also to the<br/>
&gt; old stand-bys.  As time goes on don&#39;t we all grow and change?  Maybe<br/>
&gt; since the last discussion someone has a fresh viewpoint based on some<br/>
&gt; new report/book/experience one has been exposed to.  I know how awkward<br/>
&gt; and controversial some of these discussions can be, but this list has<br/>
&gt; such potential as a parenting tool.  Could we tolerate the opportunities<br/>
&gt; as they arise?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks very much to everyone!  With much appreciation,<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Friday, September 01, 2000 10:46 PM<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay so DH and I have very different veiws on how to handle certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; situations with the children. He thinks that we need to use more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; corporal punishment in the form of a switch, that the hand isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough. Not that I use my hand often, but I do believe there is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time and a place for it and it is always a last resort. The last time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and only time that I seriously used my hand on either of the children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was when DS ran off in the mall and I couldn&#39;t find him. He was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; almost 4 at the time. Anyway, to make a long story short, I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; security looking for him for 15-20 min. When they found him I bawled<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a baby, held him in my arms then took him to the bathroom and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spanked his bare bum till my hand hurt, not out of anger but out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; love. I wanted him to understand how serious it is that he not run<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; off like that. Then I explained to him how scared I was and how much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I loved him and sat there in the stall just holding him close for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; while. Needless to say he has never run off in any store again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as DH and I go I have always believed more in the lines of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Love and Logic and DH believes more along the lines of coersion and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; force much like the ps uses. So my question is does anyone have any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions as to how to handle situations that arrise when DH is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dealing with the children in a manner that I totally disagree with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the children aren&#39;t used to, simply because they are use to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way I handle things since I am the one who is home all day and night<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and DH works all day and all night?  Corallyn<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been with the same man for 25+ years, married for 23.  We have an <br/>
established relationship.  One grown son, daughter-in-law, 2 yr old grand <br/>
daughter and a 12 yr old son.  I list the &#39;credentials&#39; to let you know that <br/>
this is a life journey and I&#39;ve come a long way, learning new things as I go.<br/>
<br/>
First off, my personal opinion...I don&#39;t spank.  I did with my oldest.  In <br/>
fact, your description of what happened in the mall is very typical of what I <br/>
would have done with my oldest son.  I learned that it made me feel too icky <br/>
and so I have worked very hard to find alternative methods.  <br/>
<br/>
A note of explanation here, I was raised in a very abusive family, so any <br/>
form of corporal punishment, yelling or signs of anger really hurt me.  Many <br/>
people think I over react to these situations...my DH is one of them.  While <br/>
I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re abusive, my parents used similar approaches; beating us <br/>
and then telling us a) it was our fault and b) they only did it because they <br/>
&#39;loved&#39; us and c) it was their responsibility to see that learned to avoid <br/>
sin so I would not go to hell.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I am NOT accusing you of abuse.  I just want to preface my methods by <br/>
sharing my experiences so you can see that this comes from the bottom of my <br/>
heart.<br/>
<br/>
Because I felt so awful and out of control any time we spanked, we decided <br/>
that spanking was not an appropriate form of punishment or discipline in our <br/>
family.  Even before we made that decision, we were careful to never be out <br/>
of control.  If we felt there was any anger or danger of abuse we sent ds to <br/>
his room until we could calm down enough to deal with it.  I still felt <br/>
awful.  <br/>
<br/>
With ds #2 (10 yrs later), we had tried so hard to bring this child into our <br/>
lives and had such heartache in the process (miscarriage, tubal pregnancy and <br/>
many months of failed fertility treatment) that the idea of striking him in <br/>
any way was repulsive.  Interestingly enough, the process of getting ds #2 <br/>
here, also softened our hearts considerably in our dealings with ds #1.  The <br/>
most that ds #2 has received was the very occasional swat.  Then it was when <br/>
I could not get words out fast enough to stop dangerous behavior.  i.e. he <br/>
was about to grab a sharp knife.  On those occasions we have really had to <br/>
laugh because his reaction was to stand up straight, grab his buns and look <br/>
at us with a look that said &#39;what did you do that for?!&#39;  There was obviously <br/>
no real pain involved.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to solutions...DH does not feel as strongly about this as I do.  He <br/>
does not see spanking as abusive or coercive.  I&#39;m the one that is around the <br/>
kids all the time.  DH is often out of town for weeks or months, so there <br/>
have been times that I am, essentially, a single parent.  When DH would come <br/>
home, he would automatically assume things would fit his expectations without <br/>
it even occurring to him that I might be doing things another way or that <br/>
changing the routine the rest of the family had established would be <br/>
disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
So, I sat down with DH and explained that in his absence, this was how I did <br/>
things.  That I certainly did not want him to feel like he was a visitor in <br/>
his own home, but it would help us a lot if he could let us know what he <br/>
expected, we could establish some rules we could all live with and each of us <br/>
would need to use extra patience in learning/remembering what it was we were <br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
I then went on to explain how awful it made me feel when there is any yelling <br/>
or spanking going on.  Explaining that it dredged up my childhood and caused <br/>
me to relive that pain every time it happened in our home.  That it took away <br/>
from my happiness when we had this contention.  I had to explain this on more <br/>
than one occasion.  Since he loves me and there are other ways to discipline, <br/>
he has learned to find alternatives or use the ones I already have in place.  <br/>
<br/>
On the rare occasion that DH strongly feels that more needs to be done and <br/>
the child has gotten off too easy (which hardly happens, it&#39;s not like I just <br/>
let them run over me!), DH and I excuse the child and explain that mommy and <br/>
daddy need to discuss this.  Go wait at the kitchen table/in your room/where <br/>
ever until we are ready to talk to you.  Then we hash out what is needed and <br/>
go from there.<br/>
<br/>
I feel it is important for there to be a united front.  That does NOT mean <br/>
that dad has to discipline using the exact same form of consequence that mom <br/>
uses.  It does mean that DH and I have set limits for our family which we are <br/>
each comfortable with.  When DH says the consequence for &#39;X&#39; is &quot;Y&quot;, I back <br/>
him up and he does the same for me.  If a child thinks it is too harsh, they <br/>
have to work it out with the parent that is handling that episode.  This <br/>
keeps them from playing us against each other.<br/>
<br/>
(A funny note:  We have a family rule concerning our activities on Sunday.  <br/>
We do not shop or engage in heavy labor, with rare exceptions.  It is our day <br/>
of worship.  Last week DH simply HAD to work on the car.  DS #2 came out and <br/>
asked DH why he was working on the car.  DH gave his answer and went on <br/>
working.  Then DS #2 came inside and asked me why dad was working on the car. <br/>
 I gave him an answer.  DS&#39;s response:  That&#39;s just what Dad said!  I really <br/>
had to laugh...that&#39;ll learn him to even consider pitting us against each <br/>
other.  LOL)<br/>
<br/>
I know this is long.  I&#39;ve given background in order to help you know if this <br/>
is a solution that will work for your family.  It has been an ongoing process <br/>
for our family.  DH sometimes still gets forceful with DS or (more often) <br/>
with the pets.  It doesn&#39;t take more than a cleared throat or my speaking <br/>
DH&#39;s name and he checks himself to see if he is out of control.  Knowing that <br/>
DH pauses to consider his actions helps reassure me and also helps DH decide <br/>
whether he is behaving appropriately.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366231466">I am going to reply to all the posts in responce to my initial email. <br/>
To those of you who had genuine support of my delima of differences <br/>
of oppinions between DH and myself I thank you. Your input was <br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
To those of you who offered suggestions as to how to propperly <br/>
dissapline my children you totally missed the topic of my post. That <br/>
may have been partially my fault as I strayed from the topic somewhat <br/>
with the sp...situation.<br/>
<br/>
To those of you who had the nerve and audacity to accuse me and my <br/>
husband of being abusive toward our children because I spanked DS two <br/>
years ago I am highly offended and resent that you would accuse <br/>
someone you have never met in person of such a crime. You have no <br/>
right to pass such a judgement on me simply because you don&#39;t know me <br/>
well enough to pass that a judgement. I view that oppion of me as <br/>
closed minded and irrational.<br/>
<br/>
And to those of you who had nothing but complaints about my choice of <br/>
topics, how rude. I had a problem that I really wasn&#39;t sure how to <br/>
handle and thought that this list would be a &quot;safe&quot; place to get an <br/>
honest oppinion from a diversified group. Apparently I was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
For the latter three groups I have learned an important lesson here. <br/>
Although this appeared to be an open group it apparently is not. I <br/>
have found much support here the past few weeks that I have been on <br/>
the list and will most likely continue to lurk, however, I doubt I <br/>
will be so quick to post especially on something that is a touchy <br/>
topic for myself and somewhat difficult to discuss to begin with. <br/>
With all this said I do respect each  person&#39;s right to their <br/>
oppinion. That doesn&#39;t mean I do/have to agree/like that opinion. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223315409">Yes, that&#39;s it.  Also, anyone who has ever raised children knows that<br/>
although we can try to teach children responsibility for their actions, the<br/>
degree of responsibility is directly tied to the age and maturity of a<br/>
child.  A child at that age has the responsibility attention span of a gnat<br/>
(not a bad thing &lt;g&gt;), the curiosity of a cat and the urge to flutter<br/>
around like a butterfly from one magnet to another.<br/>
<br/>
One of the true joys of unschooling is being able to let that imagination<br/>
run free to all those natural (and quite frequently messy &lt;g&gt;) conclusions.<br/>
 Attempts to stifle that with unrealistic expectations that don&#39;t match the<br/>
age of the child coupled with the given outside stimulus usually results in<br/>
failure.<br/>

&gt; &gt; A four year old is a child and if the child got away from an adult, <br/>
&gt; it is the ADULT&#39;s responsibility!  Period!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are absulutely right. It is my responsibility. I am responsible <br/>
&gt; for how I teach my children and at preasant the choices they make and <br/>
&gt; how I deal with those choices. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think Lynda was trying to say (correct me if I&#39;m wrong Lynda)... that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; as the adult were responsible for your child running away and punishing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from me, not hitting him for something that children do... They don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; understand at 4 yrs old they could get lost or someone could hurt them...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; They just see things that they like and off they go, which is why it&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; job as adults to not let that happen.  But why should your son suffer <br/>
&gt; consequences for your inability to take care of him?  It&#39;s just a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and one I only just thought off.... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t make you a bad parent, just a typical reaction to the thought<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Regardless where one stands on the spanking issue, I think few would<br/>
&gt; argue that corporal punishment with actual &quot;weapons&quot; (ie. belts,<br/>
&gt; switches, rods etc.) is excessive.  That IS abuse.  Ask any doctor,<br/>
&gt; lawyer, social worker, or parenting expert. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry to break the news to you but there are still places where &quot;schools&quot;<br/>
whether public or private are still allowed to use various weapons against<br/>
children for &#39;discipline&quot;.      Some are permitted to do this even without<br/>
parental consent.    And  no,   it is not found to be &quot;abuse&quot;.   So lawyers,<br/>
social workers,  or others (I REFUSE to label principals or teachers  as<br/>
parenting experts)  might give surprising answers in those locales.<br/>
<br/>
Vicki----won&#39;t try to horrify you with descriptions of weapons considered<br/>
appropriate or how one my have unexcused absences &quot;burned off&quot;.</div>

<br/>
I undersyand your point, but part of the value (for me, at least) of a<br/>
public forum is to air controversial issues. And usually such issues are<br/>
controversial because there are no cut and dried answers.<br/>
<br/>
Although the conversation may have gotten a tad intense at times (!), a lot<br/>
of interesting information was shared. It&#39;s difficult to say if anyone&#39;s<br/>
mind was changed or parenting stance was affected by new information because<br/>
in the heat of a discussion your focus is on defending your position. But it<br/>
may well be that each side at least received some food for thought, or<br/>
perhaps a better understanding of those who think differently on this issue<br/>
than they do. Without a followup a few months or years down the road, we may<br/>
never know what the true effects of the discussion were.<br/>
<br/>
But if we are only going to discuss those issues about which we all agree,<br/>
we&#39;ve done to this board what we&#39;re trying to prevent public education from<br/>
doing to our children--stifled all independent thought.<br/>
<br/>
I say, keep those controversial issues coming, but keep your delete key<br/>
handy in case of philosophical emergency!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907364524">Hello everybody! I&#39;m jumping in! ;-) This is kind of long-sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Others get angry at the thought of a child<br/>
 </span></blockquote>being hurt or at the thought of someone judging their parenting<br/>
techniques.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it may be a little more than this. There is the fear that others may<br/>
decide to interfere with that family&#39;s life or traditions to the point where<br/>
their children are actually separated from them.  There is also the anger<br/>
that the government sees fit to discriminate against parents for their<br/>
disciplinary choices (definition of abuse aside for now).<br/>
<br/>
Case in point:  not long after I had my second son the police were called to<br/>
my home by a neighbor.  My kids are LOUD. As babies, they competed with<br/>
train whistles-and I am NOT exaggerating. I had my 4 year old, whom I was<br/>
preparing to send to preschool (this was pre-homeschooling days) and my 5<br/>
month old, a filthy house, a husband on his way to school that morning, and<br/>
my son&#39;s preschool teachers due in 20 minutes. I put on some loud music<br/>
because that had the tendency to soothing the baby, and it worked for 5<br/>
minutes, just enough time for me to get into the shower.  The baby began to<br/>
scream.  Now, I was rushed that morning, so I couldn&#39;t have been in the<br/>
shower more than 10 minutes tops.  When I got out of the shower, I was<br/>
entangled in trying to dress my preschooler, clean the house, and soothe a<br/>
crying baby (who had reached the point of no return, which is pretty common<br/>
for my kids if I don&#39;t get in some early intervention)-all the while loud<br/>
music is blaring while the baby I&#39;m carrying around is shrieking in my ear.<br/>
It was an insane morning. But glory of glories, I managed to pull it off,<br/>
clean the house enough to look healthy, dress my son so he looked<br/>
presentable, and put something on other than a towel.  The baby, however,<br/>
would not be soothed.  He cried for about 45 minutes straight. He was in a<br/>
proper tit, as we call it around here.<br/>
<br/>
When the teachers arrived, we looked like a hallmark card-except for the<br/>
crying baby, but then a knock comes on the front door. Lo and behold-it&#39;s<br/>
the police! The neighbor had called 911 to report abuse!!<br/>
<br/>
I was deeply offended and frightened too! One frantic morning, and I could<br/>
possibly have my children taken away from me? Have CPS come to investigate<br/>
me? At the very least-which is what happened-have a police officer come and<br/>
frighten the hoo ha out of me?!<br/>
<br/>
After the police and the teachers left, I took my baby over to that<br/>
neighbor&#39;s house-since I drilled the cop and figured out who reported me-and<br/>
basically placed my healthy, happy but very LOUD 5 month old in their face<br/>
and said &quot;SEE! He&#39;s healthy!! No bruises!&quot; But the damage is done.  Now, I<br/>
have a permanent police report filed against me of suspected abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since then I&#39;ve been afraid that someone may misinterpret how my<br/>
children act as behavior exhibited by abused kids.  What I have read on this<br/>
list is *not* reassuring.  From my point of view, we have to be very very<br/>
careful whom we accuse of child abuse.  Imo, spanking alone is not an<br/>
indicator of child abuse, and to report someone solely on evidence of<br/>
spanking, or yelling at a child, or a loud crying baby that will not be<br/>
soothed is to put that family at serious risk. Also, I suspect that having a<br/>
CPS worker come in and investigate a family for alleged abuse based on a<br/>
single spanking, yelling or crying episode would cause great damage to the<br/>
children&#39;s sense of trust and stability.  Think of it-a child sees a<br/>
stranger come into the home assessing his parents and later finds out that<br/>
this stranger could come and take him away from his parents and his home.<br/>
*That* must be very reassuring.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I would ask of list members who feel that any kind of spanking is<br/>
abuse-when do you call the police or report the child to CPS?<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to give a tip for those of you who are *positive* you are<br/>
witnessing abuse. Don&#39;t bother calling CPS-it takes lots and lots of calls<br/>
to get a response from them that will benefit an abused child.  Instead,<br/>
call the police. This way, a police record is being created (like the one<br/>
*I* have) providing hard evidence of possible or proven abuse. I know this<br/>
because we have neighbors who abuse their children regularly by neglect and<br/>
alcoholism. I&#39;ve had the unfortunate experience of having to call the police<br/>
to their home. As our neighbor is good friends with several police officers,<br/>
I have assurances this is the best way to handle it.  This is not something<br/>
I relish doing, but it *is* something I will do when I am certain abuse is<br/>
taking place.<br/>
<br/>
Take care everybody, and play nice! :-)<br/>

with rubber gloves. He just ran up to me stark naked with a rubber glove<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032664413">Cindy, you hit it right on the head. I got into a big debate on another hot <br/>
topic on my very first list, 2 years ago. I unsubbed from it because I felt <br/>
like there was no way I could deal with the people on it, and then was <br/>
hesitant to really get into any big discussions on other lists afterward. It <br/>
stinks to feel rejected on a list that is supposed to be suportive.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, I think it has helped me to become a better writer-I try hard now <br/>
to really express myself more clearly since you don&#39;t have any personal or <br/>
visual clues, and I try to be more diplomatic, and I keep my mouth shut and <br/>
my fingers still when I just want to spout off in anger.<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list in the middle of the last brouhaha on spanking, and <br/>
managed to stick around until it was over, I hope the other new members will <br/>
do the same-we really are about unschooling, and it will get nicer here when <br/>
this dies down.<br/>
