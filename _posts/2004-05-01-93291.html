Some of you who don&#39;t know about this magazine might be interested.  They <br/>
have an article I wrote about homeschooling at their website.   <br/>
<br/>
I was amused, in this  newsletter, to find that after using terms like gifted <br/>
and mystical and indigo and rainbow, lots about ADHD, there&#39;s mention of a <br/>
current article on how labels hurt children.  Then back to stuff like &quot;an <br/>
introduction to the appearance and <br/>
<br/>
rise of Meta-Human Consciousness as seen in <br/>
<br/>
Generations X, Y, and Z and includes a<br/>
<br/>
summation of Star Child ways, needs, and the gifts <br/>
<br/>
they bring. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s information on authors of whom it is written &quot; Both women are <br/>
<br/>
Indigo/Crystal adults from South Africa. &quot;   Maybe even some adults feel <br/>
better if they&#39;re labelled.  <br/>
<br/>
Interesting juxtapositions.<br/>

Children of the New Earth Magazine Newsletter<br/>
<br/>
Greetings! (May 2004)<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A Welcome from Dona Reynolds, Deputy Editor<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The children are waiting for us.  Yes, we adults need to <br/>
<br/>
step up to the plate.  The gifted and mystical children <br/>
<br/>
of today are waiting for us to become the pillars of <br/>
<br/>
strength and counsel they need to begin the work they <br/>
<br/>
have come here to do.  Are you ready?  Are you <br/>
<br/>
prepared?  Children of the New Earth Magazine is <br/>
<br/>
endeavoring to assist you with all the latest information <br/>
<br/>
and guidance available today not only from experts in <br/>
<br/>
the field but from the parents, grandparents, and <br/>
<br/>
caregivers who work daily with these amazing, but <br/>
<br/>
sometimes frustrating children.   Together we can clear <br/>
<br/>
the path the children need to move forward on. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 In the <br/>
<br/>
next few issues of Children of the New Earth magazine <br/>
<br/>
you will see articles from experts in the field of <br/>
<br/>
ADD/ADHD, Autism, and other developments in the <br/>
<br/>
children of today.  These symptoms classified <br/>
<br/>
as &quot;disabilities&quot; just may not be disabilities at all.  We <br/>
<br/>
intend to bring you information that will change <br/>
<br/>
your mind.  Are drugs such as Ritalin really the <br/>
<br/>
answer?   Or are there new healing modalities that our <br/>
<br/>
children will respond to that do not include drug <br/>
<br/>
therapy?  Yes, there are and we will bring you the <br/>
<br/>
newest life-changing information coming into the field <br/>
<br/>
today.   Are you ready?  A new day and time is upon <br/>
<br/>
us.  We intend to brighten your path with the latest <br/>
<br/>
information available for you in your quest of standing <br/>
<br/>
strong for the children of today.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please check and be sure you have renewed your <br/>
<br/>
subscription so you won&#39;t miss out on any of our future <br/>
<br/>
issues.  You can do that by going to our website and <br/>
<br/>
clicking on My Account, enter your username and <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
information.  You can also use the website to make any <br/>
<br/>
changes in your address if you are moving.  The post <br/>
<br/>
office is not obligated to forward magazines, and in <br/>
<br/>
some cases they simply do not bother.  It costs us an <br/>
<br/>
additional $1.29 plus the cost of the magazine to mail <br/>
<br/>
you a replacement.  If you have not been receiving <br/>
<br/>
your magazines, please contact us immediately and be <br/>
<br/>
sure to change your address through the CNE <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We believe this magazine is critical.  As we do not earn <br/>
<br/>
big bucks from advertising because we feel bringing you <br/>
<br/>
information is more important than advertising, we have <br/>
<br/>
to be very careful to conserve every penny and many <br/>
<br/>
of us do not take any money in salary, preferring to <br/>
<br/>
make sure all the profits go back into ensuring the <br/>
<br/>
magazine continues to thrive and grow before we do <br/>
<br/>
so.  <br/>

HOLISTIC MOMS NETWORK REACHES NEW HEIGHTS!<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
The Holistic Moms Network, a non-profit organization, <br/>
<br/>
has been growing by leaps and bounds in recent <br/>
<br/>
months!  The organization currently has twelve <br/>
<br/>
chapters in progress in New Jersey, three forming in <br/>
<br/>
New York, three in Pennsylvania, and one in Ohio.  <br/>
<br/>
Moms from across the country have been inquiring <br/>
<br/>
about starting up chapters in their area and many more <br/>
<br/>
are expected to be created in 2004.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Holistic Moms Network was founded by moms and <br/>
<br/>
for moms as a community building coalition. At its core, <br/>
<br/>
the HMN helps moms find their tribe, remember their <br/>
<br/>
spirit and connect to new friends.  Offering everything <br/>
<br/>
from playgroups to lending libraries, the HMN embraces <br/>
<br/>
healthy living for all people.  We seek to empower <br/>

<br/>
and their priorities.<br/>

Generations X, Y, and Z and includes a<br/>

NATURAL FAMILY ONLINE<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a gaping hole out there for families who are <br/>
<br/>
somewhere in between &quot;mainstream&quot; and &quot;crunchy-<br/>
<br/>
granola.&quot; Where do you find support if you&#39;re out there <br/>
<br/>
in the middle? And where can you get solid information <br/>
<br/>
about moving toward a more natural lifestyle - without <br/>
<br/>
being clobbered over the head by the &quot;granola police&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
Natural Family Online magazine shows you how easy it <br/>
<br/>
is to fold natural, holistic practices into your daily <br/>
<br/>
family life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are so many aspects of natural parenting, <br/>
<br/>
attachment parenting and natural family living, and not <br/>
<br/>
all of them are practiced in any given family,&quot; says NFO <br/>
<br/>
Editor Lisa Poisso. &quot;All sorts of different combinations <br/>
<br/>
work - but the result is that sometimes parents feel <br/>
<br/>
out of place in places that seem predominantly <br/>
<br/>
mainstream or strongly alternative. Natural Family <br/>
<br/>
Online strikes a balance between those philosophies, <br/>
<br/>
while always offering families the tools and strategies <br/>
<br/>
they need to learn more about and move toward more <br/>
<br/>
natural, holistic ways of parenting.&quot;<br/>

PLANETLIGHTWORKER.COM<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Wondering how the Children of the New Earth Magazine <br/>
<br/>
came into existence?  It all began on our sister website <br/>
<br/>
PlanetLightworker.com.  Sandie Sedgbeer, editor of <br/>
<br/>
PlanetLightworker and Children of the New Earth <br/>
<br/>
Magazine, began to see the need for more information <br/>
<br/>
on these brilliant children while watching the response <br/>
<br/>
from those parents who were reading the informative <br/>
<br/>
articles on PlanetLightworker.com.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Parents and caregivers wanted more information, so <br/>
<br/>
Children of the New Earth Magazine and website were <br/>
<br/>
birthed.  The underlying philosophy of PlanetLightworker <br/>
<br/>
is to provide a space for many different flavors of <br/>
<br/>
truth.  PlanetLightworker, as all loving parents do, helps <br/>
<br/>
finance its child, CNE Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We invite you to visit the Mother website.  There are <br/>
<br/>
lots of free articles to read both from the front page <br/>
<br/>
and in the archives.  And perhaps you might wish to <br/>
<br/>
subscribe to PlanetLightworker.com.  At only $2 per <br/>
<br/>

THE JOURNEY TO WILD DIVINE<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
We have found an amazing computer game for you and <br/>
<br/>
your children! The Journey to Wild Divine, with its <br/>
<br/>
biofeedback sensors, is no ordinary game. It is filled <br/>
<br/>
with tasks that <br/>
<br/>
utilize our intention to accomplish. It has aspects that <br/>
<br/>
are purely instructional and provides stunning visuals <br/>
<br/>
that delight the soul. It has fun exercises that <br/>
<br/>
demonstrate our ability to utilize our own <br/>
<br/>
mind/emotions/spirit through the body to achieve a <br/>
<br/>
desired goal. And it activates the visualization capacity <br/>
<br/>
of the mind. There are objects to find and retrieve, <br/>
<br/>
there are tests to take related to internal states, and <br/>
<br/>
there are beautiful scenes to partake in that bring a <br/>
<br/>
feeling of peace and delight to our senses.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With a soundtrack that gives just the right background <br/>
<br/>
for each part of the journey, the experience can be <br/>
<br/>
transformative. There is a little something for everyone <br/>
<br/>
in this game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Check out Kathleen Jacoby&#39;s review at <br/>

professional numerologist with over 25 years of <br/>

experience. She is also one of PlanetLightworker&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
earliest contributors and an incredible spiritual teacher.<br/>
<br/>
