&gt; All at once, everyone&#39;s ears perked up as if I had mentioned gold or <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t expect that this scenario will be repeated each time I talk <br/>

always want to share what I have learned and know about unschooling.   <br/>

opinion about anything.  I was a real wallflower.  Now, I find I am very <br/>
opinionated about so many issues and find it hard not to be outspoken.  <br/>
I need to learn how to be more genteel.<br/>
