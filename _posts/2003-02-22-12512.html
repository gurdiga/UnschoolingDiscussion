<div id="ygrps-yiv-344559290">Hi, my name is Rebecca. Mom to 2 boys Jaiden(4) and Avery(19m). We <br/>
live in San Diego. We are living, loving and learning together all <br/>
the time now and I see no reason to change that just because my kids <br/>
turn 5 and everybody (family, friends,the state @@)thinks I should. <br/>
<br/>
I found this group yesterday while cruising around yahoo and joined <br/>
up and was excited to *see* so many names that I recognized from <br/>
unschooling-dotcom. I&#39;m gonna keep reading the archives for now, I <br/>
just wanted to say &quot;hi&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

You found our little corner Rebecca!! We all jumped ship and followed Sandra <br/>
here during a particularly exasperating time at unschooling.com<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
