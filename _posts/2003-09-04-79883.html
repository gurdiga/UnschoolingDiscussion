<div id="ygrps-yiv-403554487">I had meant to comment on your &quot;Death Day&quot; party last night and forgot to Diane...I think it sounds really cool.<br/>
Rituals to remember loved ones are really important, especially to children, I&#39;m glad you found one you&#39;d all enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really been interested in Mexico&#39;s celebration, Dias de los Dios (day of the dead) for a while. I picture my table covered with candles, flowers, fruit and pictures of our loved ones that have died. What a cool way to honor them. Now where to find some sugar skulls? Time to google I suppose!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that is great as well.  I mean I talk about my parents to the kids <br/>
all the time but Jackson isn&#39;t like that.  I sometimes mention to him that the <br/>
boys won&#39;t really know anything about his mother because he never mentions her. <br/>
 The &quot;day of the dead&quot; could be a really neat idea to celebrate all those <br/>
people in our family that have passed before us and tell stories that the boys <br/>
will remember.  Just a thought I had, will have to mention that to Jackson and <br/>
the boys and see what they think.<br/>

It&#39;s Dias de los Muertos.  It is similar to our Halloween.  Just Google and<br/>
you will find lots of links explaining it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755051994">My father in law passed away in February.   His illness was short and pretty <br/>
sudden.   His birthday was in August.   Some of the children ( his children) <br/>
wanted to have a birthday party for him just like we always do.   Some of the <br/>
children felt it was too soon, too painful a reminder that he was NOT <br/>
celebrating a birthday.   We were most concerned about my MIL and how she would handle <br/>
it.   The family decided to carry on with tradition and have a cook out to <br/>
celebrate his life.   My MIL brought gifts for each of the children and <br/>
grandchildren that were momentos from his life.  She gave each of the girls a carving <br/>
thier Grandpa had made.  She gave the boys each a hat from his &quot;fishing hat&quot; <br/>
collection.  She gave my DH his dad&#39;s wallet.  She gave the other children items <br/>
like a favorite book of his or a handerkerchief that he carried.    I don&#39;t <br/>
know where she got the idea to give gifts in honor of him on his birthday.. but <br/>
it was very touching and very meaningful.   She can&#39;t do this every year, <br/>
because there won&#39;t be any more &quot;stuff&quot; of his to give away.  But I can imagine <br/>
us sitting around and remembering him, telling stories and feeling good with <br/>
our memories.<br/>

*******************<br/>
Thanks Ren :)  It sure beats the hell outta hiding out and being sad!  <br/>
It&#39;s cool, Mitch&#39;s death day is December 3, very near La (el?) Dia de los <br/>
Muertos ~ I wonder if the sugar easter egg lady can do skulls? &lt;g&gt; He was <br/>
*buried* (we say *put in the cupboard*) on Our Lady of Guadalupe day ~ another great <br/>
day to celebrate with all its colors & FOOD!<br/>
Mitch always talked about bringing the kids to Disneyland, but they were *too <br/>
young* (I no longer think there is such a thing!).  Even after his stroke, we <br/>
joked about being ushered to the front of the line because we now had a <br/>
wheelchair &lt;beg&gt;  After two funerals, I had to think of *something* to do to cheer <br/>
us all up so we went to Disneyland (think: superbowl commercial &lt;g&gt;).  Now a <br/>
trip to LA isn&#39;t complete without a trek to Orange County!  <br/>
So now you know the full scoop ~ December 3 happens to fall on a Wednesday, <br/>
between Thanksgiving and Christmas Vacation ~ can&#39;t wait to see you all there <br/>
:)  <br/>

I can get sugar skulls, I&#39;m right next to Mexico. About 15 min from the border.<br/>

Do you want me to get you some?<br/>

Isn&#39;t it weird that we can&#39;t get them here?  (&quot;Here&quot; meaning the U.S., or <br/>
even here meaning Albuquerque!)<br/>
<br/>
I looked for mail order sources.  Maybe someone who knows the name for those <br/>
in Spanish could find them online to see if they can be mail-ordered.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just not something anybody does in Northern New Mexico, though some <br/>
people buy one of the folk-carvings with that theme, which also come from Mexico.  <br/>
But you can&#39;t eat them. &lt;g&gt;  (Well you COULD...)<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure that I have seen them in some of the mexican grocery stores here, (San Diego) but they are a whole lot cheaper in T.J. (Tijuana, Mexico) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21162904">We&#39;ve got a store about a mile from the house owned by an old Mexican <br/>
man who stocks all kinds of Day of the Dead stuff including really <br/>
neat folk art.  I never checked for sugar skulls but I can tomorrow.  <br/>
I know I&#39;ve seen them.<br/>
<br/>
The feeling I got when I was in NM this summer was that the culture <br/>
is much more Spanish and Native American.  Here in Houston you can <br/>
get anything that&#39;s available in Mexico.  We live 1 block from a <br/>
Mexican grocery store and bakery and we like to go over once or twice <br/>
a week and try something new.<br/>
