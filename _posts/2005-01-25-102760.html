<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025702487">The Chinese New Year, or Lunar New Year, starts with the second new moon<br/>
after the winter solstice. The winter solstice marks the start of winter and<br/>
is the shortest day of the year (time between sunrise and sunset). It has a<br/>
very scientific and mathematical basis which makes it easy to calculate the<br/>
date thousands of years in the future (or past), but means that when<br/>
converted to our calendar, the date seems to shift and can fall in a range<br/>
from late January to mid February.<br/>
<br/>
This year, Feb 9, 2005 is the start of the Lunar New Year and it will be The<br/>
Year of the Rooster. Unlike our New Year celebration, the Lunar New Year<br/>
celebration lasts several days. Although the first 5 days or so are the most<br/>
important, the celebration actually ends with the full moon 15 days after<br/>
the start and is marked with the Lantern Festival.<br/>
<br/>
The Jing Ying Institute (in Arnold/Severna Park area of Maryland) is<br/>
offering several free activities for a Chinese New Year Celebration that is<br/>
also a Tsunami Relief Fundraiser. Starting on Friday, Feb 11, from 7:30 to<br/>
9:00 pm, you can take a free Tai Chi class. A $5 donation is suggested to go<br/>
to the fundraiser. On Saturday, Feb 12 from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, we will<br/>
have Lion Dance performances at various times during the day, martial arts<br/>
demonstrations, an indoor yard sale, a bake sale, a kick-a-thon at noon, and<br/>
many other activities. Funds raised will go toward the Tsunami relief<br/>
efforts of Mercy Corps, a highly rated international charity with an<br/>
extremely high efficiency rating and reputation for high-impact rapidly<br/>
deployed aid programs.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to help with the yard sale or bake sale (provide items,<br/>
work at the tables, or help with set up or clean up), or help in any way,<br/>
you can join the e-mail list by sending a message to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:TsunamiReliefFundraiser-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">TsunamiReliefFundraiser-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to sponsor a Greer in the kick-a-thon (Billy, Glen or<br/>
Lane), we will be doing 200 kicks and pledges can be as low as a penny per<br/>
kick. Just e-mail us directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fun@...">fun@...</a><br/>
<br/>
You can also help just by attending and enjoying the events we are offering.<br/>
We are located about half way between Baltimore and Annapolis and directions<br/>
can be found at www.JingYing.org. If you happen to find a great bargain at<br/>
the yard sale or something yummy at the bake sale, remember that your<br/>
purchases will be helping the people in SE Asia who were affected by the<br/>
Tsunami and won&#39;t have as much to celebrate this Lunar New Year.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m delighted to see someone post on an Asian new year <br/>
&gt; celebration.  And I can&#39;t resist the opportunity to remind <br/>
&gt; everyone that this new year calculation is indeed based on a <br/>
&gt; lunar calendar created by the Chinese, *and* it is celebrated <br/>
&gt; by many ethnic / national groups in East Asia, including the <br/>
&gt; Koreans (Sol Nal), and the Vietnamese (Tet). </span></blockquote></div>
