My husband has all that MCSE stuff and CNE as well.  Now his BA this <br/>
Saturday.  Don&#39;t give up hope of him making more money.  When Steve started <br/>
out in the industry 4 years ago and knew nothing he earned $10 per hour.  <br/>
After 9 months he took at job that paid $12.  He then took at regular job <br/>
paying $26,000 per year.  8 months after that he took a job paying $32,000.  <br/>
1 year after that he took a job paying $42,000.  3 months ago he took a job <br/>
paying $55,000 and people say the Computer Industry doesn&#39;t pay in Tucson.  <br/>
All through this my husband self studied and went to the University of <br/>
Phoenix one night a week. He took every MCSE and CNE test.  He&#39;s now a <br/>
Network Manager.  The next move will be IT Director or out of State to <br/>
possibly Washington for better weather and a better way of life.  The good <br/>
thing about computers is that you keep moving up and no one seems to care <br/>
whether   you&#39;ve been somewhere for only 1 year or not.  It seems to be <br/>
expected.<br/>
<br/>
Think about what you can do at home and turn it into a business.  If you want <br/>
to e-mail me privately I&#39;ll be more than happy to help you with this as <br/>
that&#39;s what I do for a living.  Help people figure out what they want to do <br/>
and then show them the resources to do it.<br/>
