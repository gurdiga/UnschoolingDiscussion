<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548636237">thanks cat for all the good ideas<br/>
<br/>
i do have a couple of memberships and one that i need to renew when i can.<br/>
<br/>
it does really help to think of the donut.  especially since that is often how i try to look at &quot;dieting&quot;. i would rather pay more per ounce (or whatever) for a smaller portion so that i don&#39;t consume the extra calories.  <br/>
<br/>
any suggestions for travelling?  or just chalk up the spent money as learning whether or not we liked that new experience.  <br/>
<br/>
i am really trying to just enjoy being more adventurous.  i guess i just need to give myself time<br/>
<br/>
also, we do just go to the cheap theater now. or try to rent the movie.  <br/>
renting is what works best so far, though even with that sometimes it will take a couple of times renting a movie before my kids decide they want to see it all the way through.<br/>

Me:<br/>
Can you get memberships?  Maybe as gifts from family?  Maybe the organization has sliding fees (some institutions do this even though they don&#39;t really advertise it).  Perhaps get memberships to one or two in your area and then go primarily to them. <br/>
<br/>
We have memberships to the local museums and go to the local cheap theater ($1/person).  We do it precisely because it is then so easy to move on to something else if no one is having fun and you don&#39;t feel like you just blew $30 on the 15 minutes that you have been there.  <br/>
<br/>
But without a membership, then I think it&#39;s like the donut example - better in the trash than eaten unwanted.  Cheerfully move on from the experience, or the $30 (already spent) will have been spent to make children&#39;s lives worse instead of better.  Which isn&#39;t to say that I would always, without fail, be able to do that -- but it is my goal, and thinking of it like the donuts helps. <br/>
<br/>
Also the museums around here often have a free day a week or free week once a year.  Or go with a local group at group rates. <br/>
