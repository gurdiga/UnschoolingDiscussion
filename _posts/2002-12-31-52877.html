<div id="ygrps-yiv-141439106"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; We love it here (but then, I&#39;m an Oregon native, so it&#39;s a homecoming<br/>
&gt; of sorts). No traffic, more sun, we get to bicycle everywhere.<br/>
&gt; Homeschooling laws are much less restrictive here too, I think. We<br/>
&gt; have a great homeschooling group and tons of unschoolers to do things<br/>
&gt; with.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm.  Sounds idyllic...Not sure if I could get anyone to move further south,<br/>
though.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids were too young when we lived in Woodinville for me to look<br/>
&gt; into groups in that area, so I don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s like up<br/>
&gt; there for finding like-minded unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found Anne in Bellevue from this list already &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
All the folks I know from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there that were planning on homeschooling ended up choosing school,<br/>
&gt; for one reason or another. I do miss the 4 acres we had up there<br/>
&gt; though, and all the lakes! Cottage Lake park was our little summer<br/>
&gt; hangout, and Farrell McWhirter park with the animals and the trails<br/>
&gt; through the woods.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know where Farrell McWhirter park is, but I&#39;ve looked at Cottage Lake<br/>
park as we&#39;ve driven by it, thinking &quot;what a nice place to hang out in the<br/>
summer&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
The one property we&#39;ve looked at is on Lake Sammamish (sp?), about 1 1/2<br/>
acres and close to both Starbucks *and* Krispy Kreme.  But it will be gone<br/>
by the time we are ready to move.<br/>
