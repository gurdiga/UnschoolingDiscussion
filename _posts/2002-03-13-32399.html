<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548308917">Where I live, for high school, there is no need to test.  At the<br/>
community college, if you want to enter a specific program, they test and<br/>
place you according to what you need to take for the career you are<br/>
seeking.  There is also the g.e.d. course there, which my son wants to<br/>
take when he is sixteen, so he can say he got it, not because it is<br/>
required.  We have to take a test every two or three years so the school<br/>
district will allow us to keep homeschooling.  I can&#39;t help but ask, why<br/>
don&#39;t you do that for kids in p.s.?  My husband asked me about tests, and<br/>
I quoted John Holt from &quot;How Children Learn&quot;, page 293.  &quot;We do not need<br/>
to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning.  What<br/>
we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world as we<br/>
can into the school and the classroom; give children as much help and<br/>
guidance as they need and ask for; listen respectfully when they feel<br/>
like talking; and then get out of the way.  We can trust them to do the<br/>
rest.&quot;<br/>
