<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132823565">Hi, <br/>
I have enjoyed the discussions on this board. <br/>
My 2 week look and learn time is almost up.<br/>
What a valuable suggestion. It has allowed me time to think, ponder, and  wonder . I appreciate Sandra&#39;s talent for speaking straight, and getting to the point. I have really enjoyed reading the essays in the links. They are very encouraging, and refreshing.<br/>
Here is how we came into Unscooling:<br/>
We are into our 4th year of our home schooling journey. <br/>
We began when my daughter was 8. The first year was a time of healing from the public system( what I like to call detox)  and refreshment. The next few years have been about discovery , trial and error,and introspection, as we find our way through the homechooling lifestyle, to the right fit for us.<br/>
But there is no right fit. So we create our own.<br/>
It has been amazing.<br/>
 Traditional schooling at home did not fit our lifestyle. Unit studies were a great way for us to begin-kind of like training wheels. This was our intro to learning through living as we explored the resources within our own community to fulfill our curiosities and wonderings. The unit study sort of got left behind as we gobbled up really cool and fascinating stuff. My role has evolved from teacher to facilitator to co-learner, to all three.<br/>
 I want to say that Unschooling for me is more about who we are, and less about what method of homeschooling we use. <br/>
I have 2 older children. My son, unschooled himself, although back then it was called dropping-out. Throughout elementary school, amid reports that &quot;although your son is very bright he will not achieve his potential unless he does it our way&quot; we sticker-charted ,rewarded, consequence , bribed,and coerced him to comply. Thank God he is strong willed and  survived! He has forged his own path in the Skate board culture, and is making a living out of doing what he loves- designing and building  skate parks. <br/>
My oldest daughter was public schooled by her choice,consciously played along with the rules of the game,and is now a college student at a performing arts conservatory, on a scholarship.<br/>
Jenny is 11 , and is enjoying the kind of life I dreamed about when I was a child. She is a right brain kind of person and  has very unique and interesting ways of receiving and processing information . Rather than figuring her out and managing her life, I decided to relax and enjoy the ride, trusting that she will learn what she needs to, to do the things she wants to.<br/>
Although there are lots of homeschoolers her, I haven&#39;t met any unschoolers. Abeka,  Sonlight, gotta keep up so we don&#39;t fall behind types are not very fun to be with. <br/>
Glad to find you guys! <br/>

If you go there and ask for people or meetings closer to you they  <br/>
might be able to help.<br/>

Glad you&#39;re here.<br/>
