 </span></blockquote>I still get that same feeling of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;anxiety when I  make a parenting choice I know my father will disagree with.<br/>
&gt;Even though I am almost 37 years old, I have this innate desire to please<br/>
&gt;him!  I believe many adults never outgrow this.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe this has to do with the way so many of us are raised with total<br/>
parental control and living by their praise and approval.  When everything<br/>
we do is subject to the whims of our parents&#39; opinions and all our<br/>
activity, study, relationships, etc are monitored and directed by parents<br/>
or other adult authority figures for our first 18 years or more (especially<br/>
for those going to college on Mom or Dad&#39;s bill) how can we help but retain<br/>
that anxiety and fear over our choices being approved or vetoed by our<br/>
parents?<br/>
<br/>
There is the old classic situation where we take our current mate home to<br/>
&quot;Meet the Parents&quot; for the first time (or the reverse, where we go to meet<br/>
theirs) and all the anxiety and desire for approval from them that<br/>
accompanies that.  But in the end, you will marry or stay with whomever you<br/>
want, and basically become estranged from your parents if they do not<br/>
approve.  That is one of those situations where you are forced to move away<br/>
from parental approval and make a life based on your own rules, thereby<br/>
becoming more healthy and independent.  Many people never find the<br/>
emotional or psychological courage to break those ties that bind (in the<br/>
restrictive sense) and live their lives going along with the family<br/>
expectations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In my case, my parents heartily approve of my choice of mate (for the first<br/>
time in my life!) as I married a man I met at my dad&#39;s office, whom my<br/>
father had hired.  On a side note:  For a while it became rather difficult,<br/>
with coworkers (new hires) assuming he had gotten the job because his<br/>
father-in-law was the boss.  When in reality he worked there, and we knew<br/>
each other, for more than 2 years before we became romantically involved.<br/>
In fact he was in the last stages of a failing marriage when he first began<br/>
to work there, and was divorced a year before we began to go to lunch<br/>
together, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
But I resent my parents&#39; approval for the same reason I would resent their<br/>
disapproval:  They make my accomplishments or failures their own.  They<br/>
love to take credit for anything intelligent that I say or do as being a<br/>
direct result of their parenting skills (hah!) or education of me (Double<br/>
Ha!)  By the same token, my mistakes or errors in judgement come out as<br/>
&quot;Where did we go wrong?&quot; from them, with all the guilt associated with<br/>
that.  I am not allowed to own any of my own successes or failures, and as<br/>
such not recognized as a functioning human being on the same (or I like to<br/>
think - more sane) level as them.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps our children will be more sane, independent and emotionally whole<br/>
as a result of being allowed to have autonomy, more control of their own<br/>
lives and decisions, more control of their educations, etc.  If we are<br/>
lucky, they will consult us in important decision making because they value<br/>
our input, and not because they need our approval.  If we&#39;re REALLY lucky,<br/>
they&#39;ll take our opinions as what they are and make decisions based on all<br/>
the information they have available and their own feelings, not ours.<br/>
