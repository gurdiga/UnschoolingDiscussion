I&#39;m pretty sure Einstein didn&#39;t start talking until about age 5. <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s no problem at all. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I wrote an article about Conor and the testing that showed so many <br/>
things &quot;wrong&quot; with him. You can see it here: <br/>

I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m like Carly, I&#39;ve been on the list only a day or two, but have <br/>
read a lot of back posts and just felt like jumping in here!  <br/>
<br/>
I think Einstein was about to be labeled &quot;retarded&quot; in his youth (they didn&#39;t <br/>
have the politically correct labels back then), and Edison was pulled out of <br/>
school by his mother because the school wanted to label him with something <br/>
akin to ADHD.   I think the (sometimes very insidious) lie is that all kids are <br/>
supposed to develop in lock step and when they don&#39;t, there is something wrong <br/>
with them.   I think that particular datum would have to be much more closely <br/>
examined than it is, in general, before we could determine if it had any <br/>
validity at all, whatsoever, under any possible circumstance.  Minimally, kids <br/>
developing at different rates would need to be examined 20, 30 or even 50 years <br/>
later to see how they were doing in life.  Other factors would need to be <br/>
controlled for (i.e. schooling, home life, health factors, etc).  Studies like that <br/>
are difficult to do and there is not much (if any) financial incentive for <br/>
doing them.  Maybe some have been done, I don&#39;t know of any personally (I&#39;d love <br/>
to hear about any others may know of).  My view is that until science has <br/>
proven that kids encouraged and/or manipulated into developing with the &quot;norm&quot; are <br/>
better off than kids allowed to develop at their own pace and given love and <br/>
respect and stimulation, I&#39;m going with my own personal observations and my <br/>
gut.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad I found this group!  I&#39;ve been unschooling for a couple of years <br/>
now after my kids had bad experiences in school.  We&#39;ve had some wonderful and <br/>
precious experiences doing this, but lately it&#39;s been going rougher, <br/>
especially with my younger child, and I really need this daily infusion of wisdom and <br/>
encouragement from others who are doing this.  Thanks for being there!<br/>
