<div><font face="Century Gothic">I was going to stay out of 
this...but...</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">The scenario below is EXACTLY the situation I 
found myself in when I was 11 or 12.&nbsp; I was not able to get myself out of 
the situation and was shot in the chest with a highly pumped pellet gun.&nbsp; 
Luckily for me (and the boy with the gun) the gun was not a larger caliber and 
the pellet lodged against my rib and I ultimately recovered okay.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">There really was no way for me to anticipate 
that my friend&#39;s little brother was going to decide to show off with his 
gun.&nbsp; He didn&#39;t even know it was loaded and was showing off.&nbsp; I also 
did not know there parents were not home.&nbsp; I had just arrived for a 
pre-arranged after school play time, had found out no parents were home and was 
putting on my coat to leave when her brother came into the room.&nbsp; He was 
between me and the door.&nbsp; There was no talking him out of pulling the 
trigger because he didn&#39;t know the gun was loaded and was &#39;playing&#39; with 
me.&nbsp; (His and his parents&#39; level of irresponsibility is not the topic of my 
post.)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">My point is that responsible parents do their 
best to train their children to react well in whatever circumstances they find 
themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scenario described is not at all far fetched.&nbsp; 
This was not a gang neighborhood and my family was about conservative/(poorer) 
middle class as they come.&nbsp; This was also 30 years ago when juvenile crime 
and gangs and drug use was not nearly as common as it is today.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure 
the risks have not lessened any in 30 years.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">Kudos to all parents who are doing their part 
to protect their children by role playing and teaching them to be safe, 
for&nbsp;helping them find answers that work for them.&nbsp; And, especially for 
helping their children learn when mistakes have happened.</font></div>
