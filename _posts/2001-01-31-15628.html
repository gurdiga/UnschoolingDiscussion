<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670154056">AAAAAaaaaaGGGGGhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!  Enough of abortion!  Please, let&#39;s drop<br/>
the &quot;politics&quot; and get &quot;back on track&quot; and be nice to each other before we<br/>
lose other subbers.  This is a great list and I hate to think that others<br/>
will unsub from it because of this ongoing political discussion.  A few<br/>
mentions and thoughtful commentary is one thing, but this stream has become<br/>
almost all-encompassing.<br/>
<br/>

P.S. --- Hey, maybe some of you want to take it off-list?  That way you can<br/>
continue in your discussion without the aforementioned problems possibly<br/>
occurring.</div>
