<h4>Q</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709846714">I haven&#39;t really posted much since i joined the list but I wanted to say I<br/>
just love that you&#39;re talking about ballet the past couple of days, because<br/>
coincidentally my son and I have been watching &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; on<br/>
video.<br/>
All right, , it&#39;s not ballet but WOW!! Gene Kelly could dance!! It&#39;s just<br/>
absolutely breathtaking to watch him, and my son<br/>
(he&#39;s almost 3) is fascinated by all the tapping and whirling and leaping.<br/>
The title song is fun to sing while washing dishes too. (Haha, now y&#39;all<br/>
won&#39;t be able to get it out of your heads all day...)<br/>
I was in drama club in high school and college, and I have a real weakness<br/>
for good dancing and show tunes.<br/>
Think we may rent a Fred Astaire flick next week. Or perhaps &quot;South<br/>
Pacific&quot;.<br/>

Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat got lots of viewing here when it <br/>
first came out (and a viewing occasionally, including last week).  There&#39;s <br/>
not a ton of dancing,, but what there is is varied, and the costumes are <br/>
interesting.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548807450">We have also learned a ton from &#39;Joseph&#39;,  in regards to looking into history, Egyptian and such.   The kids like to make connections that they see in that play to other bible and historic stories.     <br/>
 <br/>
Our tape of Joseph is about ready to die from viewing it so much.  <br/>
 <br/>
Something OT in regards to Joseph,  my kids watched Joseph so much that alot of time they would refer to it, as we would go about our days........well,  back in my hair coloring days, I had colored my hair, and then gone to get a cut,    after the cut my daughter and son walked over to me in the stylist&#39;s chair and said &quot;Mom, you look like Pharaoh!&quot;  And I&#39;m like &quot;what?,  who?&quot;,    &quot;you know Pharaoh, in Joseph.&quot;  My hair stylist is looking at me inquizitively,,and it dawned on me,,&quot;Elvis!&quot;  my hair looks like Elvis!?!   Ewww..  I think my color got a bit dark,  my kids hadn&#39;t ever heard of Elvis but they sure knew what Pharaoh resembled and it was me that day!    Yuck!<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway,<br/>
 <br/>
Kelli,  now my natural brunette color with my natural gray highlights!<br/>

Last time we went to Disneyland, Kirby got a little skull figure, from <br/>
Pirates of the Caribbean&#39;s gift shop.  It was just a generic pirate-prop he <br/>
wanted to use as a marker for a Seventh Sea game, but it had Elvis&#39;s black <br/>
pompadour.<br/>
<br/>
He calls it &quot;The skull of Pharoah.&quot;<br/>

My kids have heard of Elvis (and Eisenhower, and Howdy Doody), but they know <br/>
Pharoah&#39;s song better than any Elvis song.  They&#39;ve heard UB40&#39;s version of <br/>
&quot;I Can&#39;t Help Falling in Love With You&quot; way more than Elvis&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
But the Beatles, now THAT they know!<br/>
