 </span></blockquote>Not often - but sometimes what spurs a child to learn to read IS that <br/>
other kids his/her age are already reading well and they&#39;re embarrassed <br/>
at scout meetings or 4H or Sunday School or wherever -- that could be <br/>
called &quot;shame&quot; I suppose, although that seems an overstatement.<br/>
<br/>
And it is NOTHING compared to how much later readers truly can be <br/>
shamed in schools.<br/>
