 </span></blockquote>I also hope he discusses the downside to the gaming business - like if<br/>
you want a life outside of work it&#39;s nearly impossible.  Then there is<br/>
no job security, if you have a hit, you are employed and employable.<br/>
If the next game isn&#39;t a hit, your company could be gone in no time!<br/>
I know a number of people who work at various types of jobs in the <br/>
computer game business; it&#39;s a hard life at times.<br/>

not happen? <br/>
<br/>
Both my unhusband and I are in the &#39;artsy&#39; fields and this seems to be <br/>
the norm. Unless we want to change over to something secure and <br/>
*sarcastic* ever so challenging - like lab technician. *smile*<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As I think it about : none.  But in the computer industry one always has<br/>
dangling out in front the option of getting rich, really rich like Bill<br/>
Gates and Steve Jobs did.  I don&#39;t exactly consider engineering to be<br/>
artistic as much as creative.  I know the computer business since that<br/>
is where I worked and where my friends and husband work.  <br/>
<br/>
I am reacting a lot to the fact that my DH has worked every day since<br/>
mid-Nov. (He didn&#39;t work Christmas.) And I&#39;ve got another 5 or so weeks<br/>
of it.  I&#39;m tired of his stress level and his exhaustion level.  I actually<br/>
asked him if he&#39;d like to move out so we could have some peace and he<br/>
could work all the time with no interruptions!  He changed then but I can <br/>
tell that it&#39;s hard on him to be calm when he&#39;s so stressed!<br/>
