<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873759093">Faith,  I absolutely defend your right to raise your children in<br/>
whatever way you see fit.  I imagine we may find other areas of common<br/>
ground but this is not one of them.  Please understand that the<br/>
following is my opinion, strongly held, based on 50 years of living,<br/>
years of schooling and unschooling, and studying human behaviour.  I<br/>
could be very mistaken but it is what I honestly<br/>
believe.  Forgive my strong language,<br/>
<br/>
This is extremely difficult for me.  I absolutely equate the Ezzo world<br/>
view and methodology with the very worst of oppressive, arrogant,<br/>
adult-centered, power destroying, life-draining cultism.  I know that<br/>
there are devout Christian people out there who decry this viewpoint and<br/>
espouse attachment parenting. Tragically the results of this kind (Ezzo)<br/>
of child rearing technique are like a time bomb which sometimes explodes<br/>
in other peoples lives.<br/>
<br/>
The writings of Alice Miller would be a good choice for people wanting<br/>
to explore this concept) For Your Own Good specifically.  There is a<br/>
essay entitled &quot;The Fear of Being Permissive&quot; which is really from a<br/>
Judeo-Christian perspective which also explores some of these<br/>
observations.  I would be happy to email a copy to anyone interested.<br/>
<br/>
Faith, I hope that you do not close your ears to what I have to say<br/>
because of the loudness, intensity or perhaps even the abrasiveness of<br/>
some of my words.  As deeply as you disagree is certainly as deeply as I<br/>
believe in what I am saying.<br/>
I am unlikely to convince of my position in any case and in some ways I<br/>
am speaking to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Authoritarian methods engender people who follow authority<br/>
unquestioningly. Powerful authoritarian figures have historically used<br/>
this for their personal power and material gain.  They have used it to<br/>
promote a wide variety of philosophies and ideologies.  Some are<br/>
ultimately harmless to the world at large and others become a scourge<br/>
for all of humanity.  The more power sharing and democratic parenting<br/>
methods are, the more independent minded and able to think the children<br/>
reared in that method are able to become.<br/>
<br/>
Authoritarian methods breed and cultivate unthinking obedience.  I<br/>
don&#39;t believe it is an easy thing to combine authoritarian methodology<br/>
and independent thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Of course many of the people following the Ezzo method are not<br/>
interested in independent thinking except to extinguish it.<br/>
<br/>
Believing the human spirit innately corrupt extinguishing it for the<br/>
greater glory poses no problems except for how to achieve that necessary<br/>
(from their point of view) crushing of independence and<br/>
self-determination.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the suffering inflicted on these children echoes down<br/>
through history like an spiritual plague.<br/>
<br/>
I have said what I needed to say.  A strong opinion yes but honestly<br/>
held.<br/>
<br/>

    I have one more quick comment on behalf of Christian parents. The <br/>
commandment is, &quot;Children obey your parents IN THE LORD&quot; (key words). This to <br/>
me says that if we raise our children appropriately, they will obey. There <br/>
will be no need for any method to bring about submission, it will occur <br/>
naturally. Now also in Ephesians 6:4, it says, &quot;Fathers, do not exasperate <br/>
your children...&quot; Again, the assumption there is that if you act in love with <br/>
the childs best interest in mind, instead of your own desire for peace or <br/>
control or what have you, the obedience will follow. They will not have a <br/>
ridiculous list of rules to adhere to but things that make sense, that they <br/>
can identify as neccessary. I have noticed that there are not a lot of verses <br/>
about childraising in the bible and I believe that is because we should treat <br/>
our children like anyone else; with love, patience, respect, etc... Notice <br/>
that even God let&#39;s us have free will and we blow it often! So it should go <br/>
with our children. And that is my two cents. <br/>

i am interested in the writings you spoke of.  i think we are oftentimes <br/>
shortsighted in the midst of the challenges of childraising and so instant <br/>
obedience looks so attractive!  then we are fertile ground for a <br/>
good-sounding rationale for requiring it from our children when one is <br/>
offered!  that seems to be what i am getting from my acquaintances who like <br/>
the ezzo &quot;strategy.&quot;<br/>
