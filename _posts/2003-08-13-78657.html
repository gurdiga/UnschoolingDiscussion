already booked Fri and Sat. reservation and have had NO LUCK!!!!! I will <br/>
DEFINITLY call Ken Ivey tomorrow A.S.A.P. I have called NUMEROUS x&#39;s, left voice <br/>
messages and even emailed and gotten NO WHERE!!!!!  I sure hope I can get things <br/>
resolved soon. I&#39;m looking so forward to the conference but the reservation <br/>
department has really been ticking me off. <br/>
          Thanks again, <br/>
