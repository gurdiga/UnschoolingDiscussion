<div id="ygrps-yiv-433096827">OK, here&#39;s how it goes - my mom - at first totally against my<br/>
homeschooling my own children decides that my younger brothers and<br/>
sisters aren&#39;t getting a good education in their new school (they just<br/>
moved).  So she asked me for advice on homeschooling ASAP!  Well, I sent<br/>
her Mississippi (where they just moved - Collinsville - anybody there?)<br/>
state laws (I got it off the unschooling.com website), and I promised to<br/>
sort through some essays for her and pick out a few that would be most<br/>
helpful to them in their situation.  Well, I was looking for a certain<br/>
essay - the one that &quot;converted&quot; me (sounds like a religion, doesn&#39;t it<br/>
- I guess in a way, maybe it is).  I don&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called.  I<br/>
don&#39;t remember who wrote it.  It was about a family with a lot of kids<br/>
(I think at least four) and they asked Mom to homeschool them, and so<br/>
she did.  She talks about how they teach themselves, and they have a lot<br/>
of land.  She says they have to spend money for school taxes anyway and<br/>
she&#39;d rather spend it on the kids.  Um, she also says that the school<br/>
authorities leave her alone - that testing is wrong and they know it. <br/>
Oh boy.  I wish I could remember it better.  I thought I had kept it,<br/>
but I can&#39;t find it.  Perhaps I&#39;m misquoting, but if anybody can lead me<br/>
to it, I&#39;d be very grateful.  I searched the unschooling.com website,<br/>
but it wasn&#39;t there.  <br/>
<br/>
Two of my brothers and one of my sisters are teenagers, and Mom is<br/>
worried about sending them to college - how now they have 4.0+ grade<br/>
point averages, but homeschooling doesn&#39;t look as good, and how will she<br/>
prepare them for the SATs, etc.  I don&#39;t want to scare her away - this<br/>
is my chance!  I suggested the Teenage Liberation Handbook (or whatever<br/>
it&#39;s called) for starters.  She has a new baby at home (guess the<br/>
doctors were wrong about the menopause &lt;g!&gt;), so she doesn&#39;t have time<br/>
to search the web or join a mailing list - though I would suggest this<br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Melanie in Japan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703664275">Is someone looking for the book Homeschooling for Excellence by the<br/>
Colfax family.  That is a VERY good book to give someone beginning to<br/>
homeschool.  they had 4 kids that they homeschooled on a lot of land in<br/>
California.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180058764">Hey, I know this might sound really cheesy, but don&#39;t forget to appreciate <br/>
your mom for deciding to homeschool!  Its a scary decision for a parent, and <br/>
I know a lot of us wish our parents would have made it.  Just a thought!  <br/>
Congratulations!!!!  Rachael</div>
