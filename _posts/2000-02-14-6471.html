<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085676555">I may be in the minority among Christians, but I don&#39;t want anyone teaching<br/>
my kids religious beliefs in school either.  It could never work.  You<br/>
would have to include everything from every faith to make it fair.  That&#39;s<br/>
not what they&#39;re there for. <br/>
........<br/>
Families must take the responsiblility to raise their own, each according<br/>
to their personal beliefs.  We teach our own and also allow trusted Sunday<br/>
school teachers etc at our church to teach them.  Parents have given up on<br/>
molding and training their kids and just expect the school or the gov&#39;t to<br/>
take care of it.  Which is probably why this country is such a mess.<br/>
  <br/>
What do you guys think?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m standing in my chair whisting and applauding Betsy, that&#39;s what I<br/>
think.  You hit the nail right on the head on both counts.  Religion in<br/>
Public schools is impossible, unrealistic and just plain wrong.<br/>
<br/>
As to the other, it is a symptom of the &quot;It&#39;s not MY fault!&quot; mentality to<br/>
blame everyone BUT the parents for how the children turn out.  While<br/>
parents cannot be held wholly responsible for the actions of their<br/>
children, it is, as you said, the FAMILIES responsibility to teach<br/>
morality, value systems and to raise their children &quot;each according to<br/>
their own personal beliefs.&quot;  And what tunnel visioned fool saw fit to<br/>
combine some of the concepts in the original post and equate them all with<br/>
the departure of Judeo-Christian worship from the public schools?  What a<br/>
crock of #&#%!!!<br/>
<br/>
That message really chapped my hide, and I was surprised to see such a<br/>
bigotted and narrow minded post on this, one of my most cherished lists.<br/>
