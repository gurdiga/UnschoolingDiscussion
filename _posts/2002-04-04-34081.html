<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941243992">I will never forget the first time I rode a bike without help.  It was<br/>
the most free I had ever felt.  I still feel that way when I ride a bike.<br/>
 I didn&#39;t learn until the third grade.  My neighbor tried to help me<br/>
learn in the first grade.  He pushed me on his bike that was too big for<br/>
me.  I went right into a big hole in the road where they were doing<br/>
construction.  I skinned myself and accused him of doing it on purpose. <br/>
He didn&#39;t really.  But he felt so bad.<br/>
All four of my children taught themselves to ride when my step-dad bought<br/>
them bikes.  Right now all our bikes are broke.  We need to learn how to<br/>
fix them.  There is a place in town called Alternative Transportation<br/>
where they actually teach you how to fix and make all sorts of non-motor<br/>
self-propelled vehicles.<br/>
