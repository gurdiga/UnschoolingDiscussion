&lt;&lt; HeHeHe. That was me...I hope that you don&#39;t mind Ren. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not at all...thanks for reminding me Stephanie!<br/>
I think most everyone here has had to go through some big paradigm shifts to <br/>
get to wherever they&#39;re at today, I mean heck, even Sandra talked a relative <br/>
into not homeschooling at one time!<br/>
It&#39;s neat to read old stuff you&#39;ve written and witness the growth.<br/>
I got out an old journal the other day and in it I was writing a note to <br/>
Trevor when he was about three. Mark and I were going on a mountain climb <br/>
that I had a not-so-good feeling about and I was stating our wishes about who <br/>
would raise him and so on. Part of it was telling Trevor to have love for God <br/>
and DO GOOD IN SCHOOL!!! Ack.<br/>
I really cringed when I read it.<br/>
But it&#39;s great to know how very much people do change for the better...:)<br/>
And I believe I had a funny feeling about that climb for a reason.<br/>
We got near the top and actually turned around, not attaining the peak.<br/>
One year later, when Jared was exactly one week old, Mark did the climb <br/>
again. He almost died that day, fell off the peak and barely managed to self <br/>
arrest after a long fall. There were some large rocks that feel down after <br/>
that, and one of them hit him on the ankle pretty hard. If it weren&#39;t for the <br/>
large, plastic climbing boots it would have been pulverized.<br/>
As it was, rescue patrol had to come get him down. We met him at the hospital <br/>
in the wee hours of the morning.........<br/>
So maybe my intuition wasn&#39;t so far off? <br/>

My dad and a friend and I were climbing Cathedral Peak in Yosemite years<br/>
ago.  My friend and I were too scared to do the last, very exposed bit, so<br/>
my dad went on to the top alone.  Once we were down off the mountain and on<br/>
the trail back to the parking lot, a man came running down.  He&#39;d seen an<br/>
accident on the far side, the hard side.  A young man was climbing with his<br/>
12 year old brother.  He fell, almost pulling the brother down with him.  He<br/>
landed on a ledge and the poor kid was sitting there with horrible rope<br/>
burns, not know whether his brother was alive, and not knowing how he would<br/>
get down.<br/>
My dad ran on ahead to alert the rangers to get a rescue operation going.<br/>
He wanted to help more, but they said he&#39;d done enough climbing that day.<br/>
Later we heard that the man died in the helicopter on the way to the<br/>
hospital.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hey, I would love to have people like John Holt, Mary Griffith, and you<br/>
 over to my house and listen firsthand about all their unschooling<br/>
 experiences  over a cup of java. I just don&#39;t see it happening. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nope, I don&#39;t see it happening either, since Holt died quite some time <br/>
ago...:)<br/>
But you&#39;ve got real live unschoolers right here!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>yes, I realize that now, but it was difficult during my lurk mode to see<br/>
the forest through the trees, per se. <br/>
This list is more than a little intimidating when reading through the<br/>
posts of the many people who make unschooling seem so effortless and<br/>
natural, and those who antagonize for what seems the sake of<br/>
antagonizing. It makes it difficult for someone with absolutely no<br/>
experience, who in fact grew up in a very different way, to just jump<br/>
right in. What a lot of the posters have really done for me though, is<br/>
force me into answering a lot of my own questions. And that I appreciate.<br/>
