<div id="ygrps-yiv-217586014">From Pat: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I have embraced that I am &quot;trying my best <br/>
and that is the best I can do&quot;. When I don&#39;t do something I want I <br/>
don&#39;t beat myself down mentally. I regroup and realize I can do it <br/>
differently without the FEAR that I am failing. This constant FEAR is <br/>
a result of the painful consequences in my childhood that I was <br/>
unable to escape then. These consequences are gone now, choose your <br/>
priorities. For some, the best that they can do is not to hit their <br/>
children. For others, the children can thrive on so much more when a <br/>
parent isn&#39;t trying to overcome so much themselves. Be gentle with <br/>
yourself. <br/>
How can one play when one is on the verge of failing, IN HER OWN <br/>
MIND? You can not do it all perfectly. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This was WONDERFUL! Thank you so much for saying exactly what *I* <br/>
need to hear :)  My MIL was just here and I was putting on my <br/>
*Supermom* act and shoving my children into the *model grandchildren* <br/>
roles.  It&#39;s no surprise that we only lasted 4 days til the first <br/>
rebellion against my micro-management!  When MIL not-so-gently-<br/>
suggested I use spanking to deal with Hayden, I realized the whole <br/>
*being what she wants to see* experiment was a failure; she wasn&#39;t <br/>
seeing her grandchildren as the whole and wonderful people they are.  <br/>
Well, it was really her grandSON she didn&#39;t see that way; Hannah&#39;s <br/>
incredibly adaptable and social, Hayden requires a lot more loving <br/>
patience.  My kids are her *only* grandkids, I&#39;ve now put the <br/>
responsibility of getting to know them back onto HER.  If she only <br/>
sees them once every 18 months and expects perfect *restaurant* <br/>
behavior from them at all times, then SHE&#39;s the one missing the <br/>
boat.  I will never again coerce my children into being who they are <br/>
not to make someone else comfortable.  <br/>
