<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398933352">But why..........?  Please indulge me a little here, and continue the<br/>
follwing word with your own thoughts.<br/>
&quot;Because........................................................&quot;<br/>
Just trying to get some proactive dialogue going here. Charlotte has sasid<br/>
]she&#39;ll think on an expansion of her excellent &#39;one liner&#39;.<br/>
There are reasons why we all keep our kids at home - and there are different<br/>
answers from different parents - but I&#39;m trying to see the reasons/opinions<br/>
have on what they think educational systems all over the world should take<br/>
into consideration regarding the educating of our next generation of<br/>
leaders, politicians, and opinion makers. Sending them home is a good idea<br/>
but only because we value our kids in a different light to what some<br/>
bureaucrats do. so what are those differences.<br/>
And if anyone is interested I can forward someone a pdf copy of our latest <br/>
newsletter to put up on  a web page somewhere - just incase people might<br/>
like to understand how we do things &#39;down under&#39;!<br/>
