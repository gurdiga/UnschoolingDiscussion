<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687789543">Thought this taken from a magazine was interetsing. About how kids are being <br/>
more and more confined...<br/>
<br/>
What De says about  children killed by cars in the USA mirrors  the <br/>
situation in the UK  where road &#39;accidents&#39; are the major cause of <br/>
death amongst children under 16 but of course it isnt even news. <br/>
Media hysteria  is reserved for  the occasional child  abduction and <br/>
knows no bounds, rivalling only by the press&#39;s persistent campaigning <br/>
to  get speed cameras removed and for relaxation of penalties for the <br/>
speeding by motorists - those who are the cause of so many child <br/>
deaths and who when not actually killing nevertheless bring about the <br/>
climate of risk and danger thus  leading to  children not being <br/>
allowed to play unsupervised outside in their own streets. <br/>
<br/>
So we have it proclaimed in the London Times the other  <br/>
that &quot;parents who allow their children to ride a bicycle in London <br/>
should be locked up&quot; . Cycling advocacy groups are already on the <br/>
case :)<br/>
<br/>
Natural parental instincts to protect our children are  manipulated <br/>
so that we can be ignorant  of the long term harm  caused to  <br/>
children by blocking their developmental needs, cocooning and over-<br/>
protecting them, rendering them incapable to handle the risks they&#39;ll <br/>
face in life, or unable to expand their geographical horizons, <br/>
encouraging sedentary habits and the tendency to obesity, etc the <br/>
list could go on.<br/>
<br/>
Mayer Hillman says it all much better:-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;.... Hillman it was (along with John Adams and John Whitelegg) <br/>
whose massively influential 1991 One False Move... A Study Of <br/>
Children&#39;s Independent Mobility, alerted us to the reduction in <br/>
children&#39;s freedom because of the increase in traffic. While in 1971, <br/>
80% of seven- and eight-year-old children went to school on their <br/>
own, by 1990 only 9% were making the journey unaccompanied, with more <br/>
than four times as many seven- to 11-year-olds being driven in 1990 <br/>
compared with 20 years earlier. .....<br/>
. Roads are now such perilous places that fearful parents have <br/>
dramatically curtailed their children&#39;s right to navigate them <br/>
independently. As a result, parents (for which read - mostly - <br/>
mothers) have taken to driving them, thereby putting more cars on the <br/>
road, and so increasing the danger - as well as maternal exhaustion. <br/>
(While this latter won&#39;t perturb governments unduly, they may be <br/>
exercised by the fact that escorting kids took up 900 million hours <br/>
in 1990 - and has surely risen exponentially since then - annually <br/>
costing the economy some £20bn.) .......<br/>
.......His take on &quot;stranger danger&quot; is also fresh. &quot;Far more people <br/>
are killed by strangers behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle <br/>
than are killed by strangers on foot. Danger should be removed from <br/>
children rather than children from danger.&quot; In reality, the opposite <br/>
is happening, with vulnerable road users such as children affected by <br/>
the so-called &quot;improved&quot; performance of cars, which enables drivers <br/>
to accelerate to higher speeds in fewer seconds. <br/>
Down the years, Hillman has charted the vast repercussions of the <br/>
growth of motorised transport. &quot;Normal carelessness in children is <br/>
now considered blame-worthy. And though the outdoor environment <br/>
contains experience, learning opportunities and stimuli that are <br/>
crucial to children&#39;s understanding of the real world, it&#39;s now out <br/>
of bounds to them until they reach an increasingly advanced age in <br/>
their childhood. It&#39;s salutary that, when children do obtain <br/>
parental &#39;licence&#39; to travel on their own, there are fewer outdoor <br/>
and public spaces for their social and recreational activity owing to <br/>
the appropriation of streets for traffic.&quot; <br/>
He makes a shocking analogy. &quot;Children&#39;s lives have been evolving in <br/>
a way that mirrors the characteristics of the lives of criminals in <br/>
prison. They, too, have a roof over their heads, regular meals and <br/>
entertainment provided for them, but they are not free to go out. But <br/>
children are not criminals.&quot; <br/>
The &quot;battery&quot; lives he describes today&#39;s children as living are in <br/>
clear contrast to his own free-range childhood. ......<br/>
&quot;..we learned the meaning of taking risks and its consequences, <br/>
something that is increasingly denied this generation of children. <br/>
They&#39;ll therefore be at more risk later, because they have no <br/>
experience to fall back on, no coping mechanisms that they&#39;ve <br/>
developed through slight accidents and injuries.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
if everyone owned a car, what a smelly, dangerous, noisy, stressful, <br/>
unhealthy, expensive society this would be... oh, wait... it is! <br/>

It&#39;s been show that traffic density drops (in the UK) during half-term and <br/>
school holidays. Therefore, if less went to school we&#39;d have safer roads. Best <br/>
get out there with banners  &#39;No school=safer roads&#39;<br/>

***************************************<br/>
<br/>
WOW!<br/>
<br/>
I could not agree more!  All these years, while I was getting dirty looks from other parents because I gave my children a &quot;free range&quot; childhood, I just knew there was something more important at stake.  I couldn&#39;t have told you what it was, but this is it!  I had a free range childhood too, and I wouldn&#39;t trade it for the world.  <br/>
<br/>
I have always truly pitied children who have to have constant supervision, have no means for carving out their own space in the world at any age.  I understand the fears, I really do.  But there again, its about choosing to live in fear when the risks are not really kept in perspective.<br/>
<br/>
We live near a railroad and a river.  There is a line of woods between the river and our home.  The railroad runs through the woods.  In spite of the dangers, it is a PERFECT place to explore, play, pretend, have fun, whatever.  Its great for forts, campfires, sleepouts, and swims in the creeks that come off the river.  There are trails and other fun stuff.  One trail runs the whole way to a place we own along the river about 1-2 miles away.  And the trail continues even further up the river than that.  Its got neat bridges and stuff too.<br/>
<br/>
In the other direction is an abandoned mining town and a quarry full of water.  It is absolutely beautiful.  My oldest likes to hike down there with his older friend.  They take pictures, watch the stars at night, and talk about the history of the abandoned town.<br/>
<br/>
I wrestled with myself when they were younger about whether or not to let them go without me.  And for a long time I didn&#39;t.  But when they got to be about 10, I&#39;d let them go in groups of friends.  And I sent a cell phone along, in case they needed me. I figured it was a good compromise.  I had a way to stay in contact, they had easy access to help, and they could still roam freely.<br/>
<br/>
When they were little, I taught them that if they go into the river, never to go in above their knees unless an adult was right there with them.  (That way the current could not knock them off their feet.  Can&#39;t rely on landmarks with fluctuating river depths).  I taught them never to swim alone.  <br/>
<br/>
I taught them never to rely on the sound of a train whistle at your back in the summer, because the greenery would asorb the sound, and they likely woudn&#39;t hear it.  (I found that out when I was young, free ranging on a RR bridge.  I turned around and there was a train and I was trapped.  I had to run as fast as I could to get off the bridge.)<br/>
<br/>
Because they&#39;ve *been* out in the river (with us), they know the dangers of hidden rocks, how slippery it is, and how fast the current can get.   They&#39;ve seen the trains go by.  They know how fast they can be.  In fact, they&#39;ve learned to read the signals now so they know when a train is approaching.  They taught that to me. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just can&#39;t imagine depriving them of this rich and wonderful place to play.<br/>

Can we come and live in your house too? What a terrific environment! I<br/>
remember living in Tahiti for a year when I was 7. I did a lot of ranging<br/>
all over the spread out cabana style hotel grounds where we lived (my mother<br/>
was a singer in the hotel). I also remember ranging around the neighborhood<br/>
at my grandparents� home � neighbor�s houses and yards in three directions.<br/>
The backyards seemed really big too. Was it just because I was smaller?<br/>

Probably.  As an adult, I have traveled the same roads and gone to <br/>
the same places I went to with my parents as a child and they always <br/>
seem shorter (as for the length of time to get from point A to point <br/>
B) or smaller (as in the case of parks, grandparents backyards) than <br/>
they were as a child.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266585274">I think one of the best things my mother did for us was when we moved to Bermuda and she lifted the reins she&#39;d had on us when we lived Stateside. It was no longer &quot;don&#39;t go past the end of our block&quot; or &quot;only around the circle&quot; on our bikes...it became &quot;So long as you&#39;re home by dinner, and you call home to check in once in awhile...have fun!&quot; It was &quot;Here&#39;s five bucks, see you tonight!&quot; or &quot;Mom, I&#39;m headed to Dockyard with Tracy and I&#39;m gonna spend the night.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
When we moved there I was only 12. We had a &quot;babysitter&quot; for about two weeks, when Mother pretty much said &quot;Alright. Here&#39;s how you use the public buses. I gotta be at work before you even have to wake up. You&#39;re on your own, here&#39;s your alarm clock. I&#39;ll buy you a book of bustickets a payday only so use them wisely or you&#39;re buying them from your allowance. You miss the bus to school, you walk. It&#39;s your responsibility to get there.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
She did  also say, ok, guys, no matter what, if you&#39;re in trouble you can call home and I&#39;ll come get you with no questions asked. <br/>
 <br/>
It was a great way to be, and if we hadn&#39;t been on the Rock I doubt she&#39;d have loosened up like that. Even now other parents in the neighbor hood don&#39;t understand how I can give Sarah the freedoms I do...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434995075">I really don&#39;t know. She was still pretty controlling in other ways, but yet, we pretty much had the run of the island. It seemed more to me at the time..and still now..that she just didn&#39;t really want to be bothered with us. We&#39;ve never been a close family, and that didn&#39;t help much either in some ways, because it was only for the first year that we had to stay together. I&#39;m in the middle of an older and younger brother, by the way. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a whole different way of life there, much more relaxed, and so to a degree..she relaxed.<br/>
