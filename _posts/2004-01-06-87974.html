  He inspired a lot of the ideas in Jurassic Park did he not? Amateurs get no <br/>

amateur in Paleontology when really, that whole field was the creation of people <br/>
with no training.<br/>

Do you folks know the book &quot;The Independent Scholar&#39;s Handbook&quot; by Ronald <br/>
Gross? It&#39;s this cool book about becoming an expert in any subject, on your own, <br/>
and talks about Freud, Darwin, Betty Friedan, etc., etc. who became experts in <br/>
their fields by independent learning and reseacrh rather than school. VERY <br/>
cool book.<br/>
