&lt;Military intelligence, my eye!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sooo behind in my digests (as you can see) it&#39;s almost embarrassing, I <br/>
even thought about letting this slide, but just couldn&#39;t!!  I have another <br/>
&quot;intelligence&quot; story here.  My son also joined the Army - reserves - and <br/>
needs to have his blood type before they&#39;ll give him his ID.  Well, we don&#39;t <br/>
have it - he was born in a birthing center and they&#39;ve gone out of business <br/>
so they aren&#39;t a source (besides, they didn&#39;t do anything to get his blood) <br/>
- it was recommended that we call the hospital he was born at - DUH!!! Not <br/>
an option!!<br/>
<br/>
After calling his pediatrician&#39;s office (they didn&#39;t have the information <br/>
either - had no reason to have it!) it dawned on me... when you go through <br/>
your physical they do all kinds of tests - including drawing your blood - <br/>
why didn&#39;t the army just find out his blood type???  Just one of those dumb? <br/>
questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365791514">no doubt they are &quot;THE MILITARY&quot; bla<br/>
most children don&#39;t get their bold typed at birth<br/>
seems as though they should it could be typed from the umbilical cord<br/>
my blood is O+ (i didn&#39;t know until pregnancy)<br/>
and my first two children had umbilical typing<br/>
my third however, i asked and asked what type his was, they said they don&#39;t type babies (ANYMORE) i explained why the others were typed (if they were neg. they watch for jaundice, which oddly enough both the boys had as well as MY blood type) <br/>
but they still wouldn&#39;t type even at our insistence. (our ped was out of town and the hospital ignored all of our birthing plan, involving the baby)<br/>
we asked the peds office at the  2week visit<br/>
he said it was not something we needed.<br/>
so when our youngest  was 3 and a heart defect was found, requiring surgery, at the age of 5<br/>
we didn&#39;t know his blood type<br/>
i wanted to have blood donated by a family member (because they wouldn&#39;t take his own a couple of times before the surgery,  he would need to be 18 yrs old)<br/>
ANYWAY he had to be typed and they hospital (Denver Childrens) said they and any hospital would need to type before any surgery to be sure for a case sanative blood.<br/>
Witch leads to my point<br/>
all of the people we know in the military were RE-vaccinated.<br/>
and since many babies are not typed the Army should have known this and typed it <br/>
... when you go through <br/>
your physical they do all kinds of tests - including drawing your blood - <br/>
why didn&#39;t the army just find out his blood type???  <br/>
