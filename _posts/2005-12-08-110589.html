<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505852655">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
My city has a Yoga Kids class ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yogakids.com">http://www.yogakids.com</a> ), which isn&#39;t<br/>
just a yoga class for younger age, but also includes &quot;reading,<br/>
storytelling, music, creative arts and earthcare blend seamlessly with<br/>
yoga movement [..] along with poses, modified just for kids&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have experience with this program? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Inna Manni</div>
