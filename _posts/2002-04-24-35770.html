&lt;&lt; I agree with her.<br/>
 Moms should respect their kids&#39; feelings, and if a hot dog isn&#39;t really a <br/>
dog <br/>
 but a kid wants one, there&#39;s no advantage to naming off the ingredients in <br/>
 World&#39;s Cheapest Hot Dogs.   The parent could go get a fully organic <br/>
 all-beef, no-by-product, fine-ground sausage instead of whatever&#39;s on sale <br/>
at <br/>
 the grocery store.<br/>
 <br/>
 I think in some cases the stress and shame and pressure some people put on <br/>
 others about their choices has GOT to be worse for them than the effect of <br/>
 &quot;bad&quot; food eaten in peace.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, exactly!<br/>
It took me a long time to &quot;get it&quot; with the food issues.<br/>
I at least have my kids liking the tofu and veggie weinies....I don&#39;t think <br/>
I&#39;d handle it very well if they liked the other variety!!!<br/>
We even found decent corndogs...what a treat.<br/>
I have an unschooling friend that is very controlling over diet....maybe I <br/>
should forward your post....<br/>
I often mention emotional/mental health as the more decisive factor in over <br/>
all health.<br/>

Now, that the squeamish are off meat, go check out how they make Tofu <br/>
and Tempeh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389782113">&lt;&lt;But if you have a child obsessive-compulsive, it doesn&#39;t really help to<br/>
only hear advice about how to unschool children that don&#39;t have it&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My Danny (3) was born addicted to cocaine.  He is a &quot;wild child&quot;.  He is<br/>
intense and problematic and wonderful and funny.  Much more &quot;pressure per<br/>
square inch&quot; than any of my other 4 children or any of the 14 foster kids we<br/>
had.  He also has Hepatitis C and tends to get tired a lot.  So he has &quot;the<br/>
crankies&quot; on top of everything else.  He has great difficulty regulating<br/>
himself.  He often hurts himself or others because he is either angry or too<br/>
wound up.<br/>
<br/>
Point being....we unschool Danny the exact same way we do the other<br/>
children....we PARENT Danny differently.  Danny has special issues that when<br/>
left to his own devices (not taking a nap and getting tired) he interferes<br/>
with other family member&#39;s rights to their lives (he gets too wound up,<br/>
angry and hits the 2yo).<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that unschooling doesn&#39;t work.  It means that everyone is<br/>
an individual, even within a diagnostic category.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365068989">Does anyone remember those &quot;veggie&quot; burgers from the dark ages?  It was like<br/>
biting into sawdust and was gritty!  And then, of course, there were those<br/>
slimey Loma Linda veggie hot dogs in a can, eeeuuuuu!  Or, worst of the lot,<br/>
vegemite!!!<br/>
