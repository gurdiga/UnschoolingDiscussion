<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, what about kids who are *gifted*? Katherine is learning so much at<br/>
&gt; school, and in her Enrichment class. She is learning stuff that is beyond her<br/>
&gt; *grade level* in this class. Stuff that I&#39;m amazed that she is learning and<br/>
&gt; doing.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Gifted* education is not supposed to mean that you&#39;re learning beyond your<br/>
grade level (doing 5th grade work in 2nd grade type thing).  The point of<br/>
gifted education is supposed to be that the children are learning more in<br/>
depth of the subject than the surface skim that a normal classroom gives.<br/>
They&#39;re also supposed to have time for things that normal classrooms don&#39;t<br/>
have time to do.  <br/>
<br/>
This is one of my father&#39;s favorite rants; he&#39;s an Educational Consultant<br/>
for the State of Iowa.  Most schools don&#39;t get that.  I know the DODDS<br/>
school here doesn&#39;t.  When I registered my son for school so he could join<br/>
chess club and use the library (our post library is awful), they wanted to<br/>
test him for Talanted and Gifted (TAG).  I asked a lot of questions as to<br/>
what the TAG classes were studying, and was told that they&#39;re learning<br/>
French because languages are &quot;so good for kids&quot;, and they learn to play<br/>
chess, and some other things like 5th grade is learning Algebra.<br/>
<br/>
My son already plays chess, and we live in GERMANY, folks.  They get a very<br/>
basic dash through German culture for 1 hour a week in their classrooms, why<br/>
not work on their GERMAN, since it would have practical use!  Oy.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that strikes me for your friend, though, is the last sentence.  My<br/>
questions for her would be, &quot;Is your daughter amazed at the things she&#39;s<br/>
learning and doing?&quot;  and &quot;Are these things that *she* really wants to be<br/>
learning?&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525017229"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I notice in observing my kids that their interest in things tends to go in<br/>
&gt; spurts. And, interestingly enough, it&#39;s when they&#39;re doing &quot;nothing&quot; in a<br/>
&gt; given &quot;subject&quot; that the real progression happens.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES!  This is so much what I see, too.  It&#39;s as though the information has<br/>
to go in and be processed for a while before it suddenly reappears in a new,<br/>
more complete form.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the step that schools miss so badly, too.  Kids learn stuff<br/>
in the first stage, if you will.  They ask and answer questions about it.<br/>
Then test, and boom, it&#39;s over.  On to something else.<br/>
<br/>
But they never get time to apply it to the other stuff they know and<br/>
reconnect it in different ways.  Sort of like my son&#39;s beloved legos.  New<br/>
sets always get built and played with as sets.  Eventually Tim pulls them<br/>
apart.  And they sit in piles for weeks on end.  And one day, they reappear<br/>
in a whole different form, as part of something else.<br/>
<br/>
My mother is a school teacher, and totally does not get what we do here.<br/>
She also insists that lego sets stay in their sets, and re-boxes them after<br/>
they&#39;re taken apart.  I wonder if these are connected, somehow.....<br/>
