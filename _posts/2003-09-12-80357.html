<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My sister and I were 4 years apart, and we spent almost no time together, <br/>
especially after we got our own rooms.  I can&#39;t remember one time after I got my <br/>
license that I took her someplace.  I was always with friends instead.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are so much the opposite!!  I LOVE it.  My oldest has her own <br/>
apartment, and almost every week one of them is spending the night there, or going <br/>
out shopping, or out to eat.  They don&#39;t like going anywhere alone, they&#39;ll <br/>
always take a sibling with them.  I sure wish my sister and I had that <br/>
relationship.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Shyrley, feeling like a crappy mother<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you are a crappy mother, then so am I.  Your 11 yo dd sounds a lot like my <br/>
11 yo ds, and my 7 yo ds too.   F&#39;ing B**** is JP&#39;s phrase of choice right <br/>
now.   And also, &quot;shut the hell up&quot;.    On Labor Day weekend, Anna, JP and I <br/>
rode home from our camping trip together.  DH and Ethan rode together. ( We have <br/>
to take 2 vehicles to haul all of our gear)  JP was playing gameboy, he got <br/>
frustrated.  Anna and I were talking in the front seats.  He started screaming <br/>
at us to shut the hell up.. over and over.. calling us the FB name.. among <br/>
other names..  I asked him what was wrong, could I help him, could Anna help him? <br/>
He kicked the back of my seat and he  continued to scream for us to shut the <br/>
hell up.. sometimes switching hell for F****.  I looked at Anna and she and I <br/>
did not say another word.. not a mumble, not a whisper... nothing.. for ( I <br/>
clocked it)   20 minutes.  He screamed the whole time for us to shut up.. we <br/>
messed him up, we ruined his game.. etc etc.    I think when he finally realized <br/>
that no one had spoke a word in a long time. he switched to my driving..  He <br/>
started cussing me for swerving, &quot;driving crazy&quot;.. going too fast..  I calmly <br/>
said. &quot;JP,I am driving as carefully as I can&quot;   Then, she started with the shut <br/>
the hell up again.    I know he was tired, I know he was frustrated.   He had <br/>
to just get it all out.  If folks knew how he acts, I am sure they would be in <br/>
shock and disbelief.    Maybe he takes his frustrations out on me because he <br/>
knows I won&#39;t &quot;retaliate&quot;.. I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
But, Shyrley, know that you are not alone.    And for what its worth, I dont <br/>
think either of us are crappy mothers :-)<br/>

It&#39;s one thing not to retaliate, but did you tell him it&#39;s really not okay?<br/>
<br/>
Did you tell him it&#39;s bad for HIM to be that way, even if others don&#39;t hear <br/>
him?  That given a choice of doing one thing or another, he should choose the <br/>
better thing if he wants to have a good life and be a happy person?<br/>
<br/>
I think keeping my children safe and happy includes protecting them from one <br/>
another as much as protecting them from the hypothetical crazed homeless <br/>
lunatics who might pull them out a window and do national-enquirer stuff.   <br/>
<br/>
Nobody should tolerate being called f*** bitch, not by strangers, not by <br/>
relatives.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a serious problem in the relationship and could you work on that <br/>
directly (instead of the symptom or result)?<br/>

Your son seems to have more than the normal amount of rage when he gets too<br/>
frustrated. But do you let him know that this behavior is wrong? Does he<br/>
suffer any consequences for his bad behavior? Or maybe you do do these<br/>
things and just didn&#39;t communicate that? It wasn&#39;t clear when you said you<br/>
don&#39;t &quot;retaliate.&quot; I don&#39;t understand why he did not receive an immediate<br/>
verbal reprimand - not screaming, just simple, calm words that his behavior<br/>
is not acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest had trouble with getting frustrated and having a tantrum for a<br/>
while when she was three - she was immediately reprimanded and sent to her<br/>
room and not allowed out till she &quot;got control&quot; of herself. If she came out<br/>
(her choice) and wasn&#39;t in control of herself, back she went. Her mother and<br/>
younger sister did not have to tolerate this behavior. Each of my other<br/>
children went through this stage also, a normal stage IMO. My DS has dings<br/>
on the back of his door where he threw metal train engines at it. And yes,<br/>
that always brought momma immediately to tell him, in no uncertain terms,<br/>
that you did not throw things no matter how angry.<br/>
