<div id="ygrps-yiv-874966238">Wendy,<br/>
My father was in the Air Force so I know how tough it is to up and move out <br/>
of the blue.  I spent my last 2 years of high school in Morocco and although I <br/>
HATED it at the time....what a learning experience it was!!!!   Germany would <br/>
be wonderful for your family.  I really feel for you but it will be ok.<br/>
<br/>
My husband just called home and asked if I would go back to work because he <br/>
wants to quit his job!  Well, I&#39;m not interested in the least bit in going back <br/>
to teaching with a 1yr and 3 1/2 yr old at home.  Not to mention, now that <br/>
I&#39;ve decided to unschool them, I don&#39;t really want to ever have to go back to <br/>
teaching in ps!  Hopefully by the time he gets home tonight he will have calmed <br/>
down a little and not quit on his way out the door!   So it looks like we&#39;ll <br/>
be going through some life changes as well.  Some career changes can change <br/>
your life so much!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and try to be open minded about how wonderful the experience of <br/>
living in Europe will be.  It&#39;s so easy to travel all around Europe on the train, <br/>
cheaply!   Since you unschool, you can do so much!  I attended an American <br/>
school and still had the chance to travel a lot (spent thanksgiving vacation one <br/>
year on a camel in the Sahara)!  Have fun....I love Europe & am kind of <br/>
jealous now!<br/>

Yep.  <br/>

Brenda isn&#39;t on this list anymore.   I think she&#39;s near or in Frankfurt.<br/>
<br/>
Wendy,  do you know where you&#39;ll be stationed?   If you&#39;re near Frankfurt, I could e-mail Brenda and let her know an unschooler is coming over.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119257674">I don&#39;t know if they&#39;d be living on a base or out on the economy, but if they are on a base then they would follow under the DODDS, which from what I understand isn&#39;t that big a deal. They may have to submit a form to the local school principal, etc. notifying them that they are homeschooling. If they are out on the economy then they are subject to local rules if I am not mistaken...<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Yes we are an Army family and we go by American Laws, not <br/>
German Laws... I can home school freely there because we will be <br/>
living on American Federal Land. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there is a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the US <br/>
and each country that hosts US military forces.  The SOFA agreements <br/>
can vary by country and are used to determine what happens when a <br/>
military member or their dependents break local law. If the crime is <br/>
serious like drugs or rape sometimes the military turns the perp over <br/>
to the local authorities or they might just be shipped back to the <br/>
states. I think there is alot of leeway for the military authorities <br/>
to determine what happens.<br/>
<br/>
We have one friend who was on liberty off a Navy ship in Greece and <br/>
stole a Greek flag. He had to spend 3 months in a Greek prison. <br/>
Normally that crime would only involve a return to the ship, a really <br/>
mad skipper, and perhaps a slap on the wrist or a fine. At the time, <br/>
though, there were negotiations going on between Greece and the US <br/>
about trade issues (or something like that).  Our friend feels that <br/>
had alot to do with why his crime resulted in a prison sentence <br/>
instead of just a fine. So there are often politics involved. <br/>
<br/>
My dad was in the Air Force and when we were stationed at Kadena AFB <br/>
on Okinawa in 72-75, 16yo could drive cars on but only on base. To <br/>
drive off base you had to be 18.  (Well, we did  know of that one <br/>
unguarded back gate. . . . .   &lt; g &gt; . . . really handy for sneaking <br/>
on and off  base. . . . )<br/>
<br/>
The first time I ever heard of hsing, dh (who was in the Navy at the <br/>
time) and I were living on Patch Barracks in Stuttgart Germany. Nick <br/>
was 6 and Alex was 2. I heard of this US family living off base that <br/>
had been reported to the Polizei by their German neighbors because <br/>
their children weren&#39;t in school - they were homeschooling. My first <br/>
reaction was:<br/>
<br/>
WHO would ever WANT to do THAT?????  <br/>
<br/>
That family was allowed to homeschool and we didn&#39;t come to our <br/>
senses until 6 years later.<br/>
<br/>

who would trade places in a heartbeat with anyone who got the chance <br/>
to move to Germany (or just about anywhere else in Europe. . . . )</div>
