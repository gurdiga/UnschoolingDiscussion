<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491031905">I really appreciated all the feedback from those whose kids are highschool<br/>
age.   Since then, I went out and purchased a Canadian copy of the GED prep<br/>
book.  Now I have some peace as to how we&#39;ll deal with the finishing out<br/>
period of their home education.<br/>

Thanks Diane, for responding to my writing question.  I have been so busy<br/>
lately, that I was able to read posts, but couldn&#39;t put my thoughts into<br/>
words to continue the thread.<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted to say, is that I want to teach my girls the formula for the<br/>
five paragraph essay.  It&#39;s important to me, that they are prepared to<br/>
tackle any practical piece of writing should the need arise.  My 15 yr old<br/>
daughter has ADD, and can write creatively with amazing ease, but as far a<br/>
putting her thoughts into a practial piece of writing, she definitely has a<br/>
struggle.  The 13 yr old is better with the 5 paragraph formula, but<br/>
creatively is less at ease.<br/>
<br/>
We are not exactly unschoolers because there are things that I feel<br/>
responsible to teach them, whether they choose to learn them or not, such as<br/>
the 3 R&#39;s, but in other respects, I do not load them down with mountains of<br/>
assignments; instead, we read out loud and discuss whatever we want to<br/>
learn, and avoid textbooks.  They do work out of &quot;Key To&quot; consumable math<br/>
books which are excellent for any of you who haven&#39;t tried them yet, and do<br/>
&quot;Wordly Wise&quot; for vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; Have you talked about the writing process much, on this loop?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; LOL!!  I think we&#39;ve talked about how resistant some of our children<br/>
&gt; are to writing ANYTHING - especially boys it seems.  My 13 year old<br/>
&gt; will do almost anything to avoid writing. </span></blockquote></div>
