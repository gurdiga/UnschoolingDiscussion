&gt; Speaking of PBS, is anyone watching the fantastically beneficial &quot;1900<br/>
&gt; House&quot; mini series?  The kids are really enjoying it for the exposure to<br/>
&gt; living history and social studies.  Yes, there definitely are merits to<br/>
&gt; having PBS access...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We watched the PBS show last night .... fascinating stuff. Oldest one<br/>
and I were discussing how we would fare if it were our family.<br/>
We figured pretty darned good because I know I could cook and bake on<br/>
that range (Mother-in-law had a coal and wood stove I&#39;ve experience with<br/>
and I&#39;ve cooked on open fires successfully  so a more *controled* range<br/>
would be simpler), we have enough hobbies that would fit in to the<br/>
Victorian era ( knitting, embroidery, puzzles, painting, reading etc ),<br/>
we like each other enough that we could put up with each other for the<br/>
three months.<br/>
<br/>
They are doing a couple of similar projects here in Canada .... one in<br/>
Manitoba where a family (maybe it was three families) will live in a<br/>
totally pioneer lifestyle and one I believe in Newfoundland where they<br/>
will live as the vikings who landed there would have.<br/>
<br/>
We got rid of cable in favour of a satellite dish service. Best choice<br/>
we&#39;ve made in a long time, don&#39;t know why we didn&#39;t do it when they<br/>
first came out (serviced dishes not the giant point and aim dishes).<br/>
Now we get two PBS feeds east coast and west coast so we never miss a<br/>
program. It&#39;s always on later for us to watch or tape.<br/>
We get every Canadian province&#39;s version of PBS too which is wayyyy<br/>
cool!<br/>
