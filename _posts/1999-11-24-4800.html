<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120486598">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m new to this group (not yet one week).  to this point i&#39;ve only been<br/>
skimming this thread, but the concept of witnessing is very interesting.   i<br/>
grew up the youngest of 5 kids in 6 years (4 girls & 1 boy).  we were, in<br/>
anyone&#39;s definition, abused, primarily through neglect but that was accompanied<br/>
by frequent unpredictable outbursts of aggressive and violent behavior.   most<br/>
people want to believe that this kind of thing is perpetrated due to cold<br/>
heartedness, the need for control or disdain for the kids.  my experience is<br/>
that it&#39;s actually not that personal (but it&#39;s extremely difficult not to take<br/>
it that way),  that it&#39;s the parents&#39; inability to handle the stresses of their<br/>
own choices.  it&#39;s not that they don&#39;t love you or that you are not lovable,<br/>
it&#39;s just that their own needs are so big and out of control they can&#39;t even<br/>
begin to realize you have any.   hence they do not model for their children how<br/>
to handle or release the natural occurring stress that build up in all our<br/>
lives but model a sort hypersensitivity which can  either produce a paralyzed<br/>
sort of personality and/or a highly combative/defensive one (personally i flip<br/>
flop).<br/>
<br/>
neither my father nor my mother were abused in this sense but for various<br/>
reasons they were not taught how to not put themselves at the very center of<br/>
every situation.  this they did successfully model.  it has been interesting to<br/>
see how each us have lived our lives and the choices we&#39;ve made.  what i can<br/>
confidently say is that we, my siblings and i,  all have developed an emotional<br/>
instability that some of us &#39;witness&#39; and some struggle to.  to me this is an<br/>
invaluable skill, to be able to emotionally distance yourself so you can<br/>
release the stress,  but one that has been incredibly difficult, at least for<br/>
me, to acquire and maintain because my unconscious understanding of the world<br/>
(as a scary unpredictable place where your needs are never met- an emotionally<br/>
unstable view) often overrides my conscious understanding of love and<br/>
compassion (which i experience daily with my son).<br/>
<br/>
i can relate to the story about the dogs that pam sent (see below) i felt that<br/>
way by the time i was thirteen ( i was so tired i prayed to sleep forever)  but<br/>
at that point my parents&#39; own personal internal problems blocked me from their<br/>
view and i was virtually on my own (divine intervention:)   but that feeling of<br/>
resignation - there is a point were you just stop desiring anything at all and<br/>
it takes a long time to get it back.  but i whole heartedly believe one can<br/>
overcome anything and for me the way to do that is to be kind to yourself,<br/>
complete and nonjudgmental acceptance for you as a whole flawed person (much as<br/>
a parent naturally does for their children) .  this releases stress then<br/>
perhaps some clear new understandings can come through.  otherwise your life<br/>
will maintain itself just exactly the way it has been and the cycle continues.<br/>
it really does come down to making conscious choices.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes people make choices.  People&#39;s choices are shaped by their previous<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience.  It is very difficult to make choices about which you have<br/>
&gt; limited<br/>
&gt; &gt; or no experience. People struggle within the limitations of their<br/>
&gt; experience.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Effective &quot;therapy&quot; is in fact a little world of alternate experience<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; &gt; allows people to have experiences that they would never &quot;choose&quot; because<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; &gt; experiences are outside their &quot;box&quot; of choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do not people also struggle within the limitations of their inexperience?<br/>
&gt; And therapy would allow us to become experienced at analyzing the choices we<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t make?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The question of why people with similar experiences make different choices<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; of course central to this discussion.  I believe that people who make<br/>
&gt; &gt; constructive choices in spite of their painful experiences have had (to<br/>
&gt; borrow<br/>
&gt; &gt; from Alice Miller) &quot;witnesses&quot; to what was done to them.  People who<br/>
&gt; choose<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;destructive&quot; roads have not had &quot;witnesses&quot;.  this is at least one piece<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the puzzle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have read only one Alice Miller book, a compendium of stories.  I think I<br/>
&gt; understand the use of the word  *witness* here, but would love for you to<br/>
&gt; explain more anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My childhood was pretty rotten....when went over the edge of rotten and into<br/>
&gt; abuse it was becuase of who *I* am/was.  Another child might not have had a<br/>
&gt; second thought about things my parents said or did.   I am a better parent<br/>
&gt; to three of my children than I am to the 4th.  I struggle to parent that 4th<br/>
&gt; child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am really glad that (thus far) this discussion (this time) has not<br/>
&gt; resulted<br/>
&gt; &gt; in anyone going off in a snit.  I find that this conversation gets people<br/>
&gt; &gt; really excited and often &quot;mad as hell&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ya, know, this list has never had a long lived snit.  We all seem hungry for<br/>
&gt; more indepth discussions.  Some of us have unschooled for a long time and we<br/>
&gt; need to analyze where we&#39;ve been and where we&#39;re going.  The face of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling has changed more than once in the last 20 years and the next 5<br/>
&gt; are going to see it change yet again.  Frankly, we now have some very clear<br/>
&gt; insights that the rest of the culture should take a long hard look<br/>
&gt; at......is they&#39;ll sit still long enough.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;They took a series of dogs and put them on a metal plate in a square area<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;The day after each dog &quot;gave up&quot;, they put the dog in the square room, but<br/>
&gt;this time, major difference: they left a CLEAR AND OBVIOUS EXIT (the same<br/>
&gt;door they would take the dogs in and out every day to get into the room).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;None of the dogs, when the electrical shocks began, attempted to escape.<br/>
&gt;None.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s learned helplessness. That&#39;s what at least some kids in school are<br/>
&gt;feeling, probably many, maybe most.<br/>
