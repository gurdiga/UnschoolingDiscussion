&lt;&lt; I myself had never heard<br/>
any controvery on this issue other than from child-centered parents &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
faith,<br/>
could you explain the phrase child-centered parents: where you learned it <br/>
from and what it means?  this may be inherent to the controversy...   i am <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117850685">A lot of this, if not all, will mean nothing to the non-Christian.  It&#39;s based<br/>
on scripture and God.  To those of you who are going to read this, please<br/>
don&#39;t take offense and think I am saying you have to follow this.  Erin asked<br/>
me a question of what I have learned and the reasons to the way I believe.  I<br/>
am simply answering her question.<br/>
<br/>
God intended our priorities to be:<br/>
1. God<br/>
2. husband/wife<br/>
3. children<br/>
<br/>
When we get away from that and put children before our husband/wife<br/>
relationship and sometimes even before God we are getting into child-centered<br/>
parenting.  Putting the child&#39;s feelings before anything, including their<br/>
behavior.  Always making the child &#39;feel&#39; happy instead of making him<br/>
responsible for his actions.  When the child leads what the family does<br/>
instead of mom and dad.  Basically making the child the center of our<br/>
existence.  Now don&#39;t get me wrong.  I love my children and they mean<br/>
everything to me and my husband, but we know that our relationship with God<br/>
and each other is more important.  Let me explain why before you label me an<br/>
uncaring monster!<br/>
<br/>
God made Adam, saw he was lonely and created Eve. Then he said &quot;it was very<br/>
good&quot; (Gen. 1:27-31) and rested.  If you notice children were not present when<br/>
he said this. After woman was created God authoritatively declared that His<br/>
creation was very good.  If children were necessary to complete man and woman<br/>
God would have created children, then said it was good.  The marriage<br/>
relationship lacks nothing.  Woman alone completes man and visa vera.  So, the<br/>
husband and wife form the nucleus of the family unit.  Children do not<br/>
complete the family: they expand it.  A healthy husband/wife relationship is<br/>
necessary to the emotional wellbeing of a child.  When they see that mom & dad<br/>
love each other more than anything, their world is secure.  They don&#39;t worry<br/>
or even think that they aren&#39;t loved, they know they are.  They don&#39;t need to<br/>
be made the center of the family to feel love.<br/>
<br/>
In GKGW they suggest daily &quot;couch time&quot;.  It&#39;s a time taken 10-15<br/>
min.everyday, in front of the kids (meaning you don&#39;t go into a back room<br/>
somewhere or wait til they go to bed) and you two talk with the understanding<br/>
the kids are not to interrupt.  It provides your kids with a visual sense of<br/>
your togetherness.  They also suggest each parent set up a certain time each<br/>
week to spend one-on-one time with each child, and family things to do<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stop now, sorry so long.  Like I said this is how I believe. I don&#39;t<br/>
condemn anyone who lives or believes differently.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Faith,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi and welcome to the list - I&#39;ve had email on the back burner for a while now<br/>
and am just catching up.  I am not attempting to reopen a bucket of worms like<br/>
this but wanted to pass on a couple of things for you to consider.  First, let<br/>
me say I am a Christian was raised by very authoritarian parents and started<br/>
out parenting similarly.  I have changed.  My dh comes right after God just as<br/>
you outlined but my kids are much more to me than I was taught children should<br/>
be considered.  I can testify that being raised in an authoritarian<br/>
methodology<br/>
does in fact breed and cultivate unthinking obedience. It took me the better<br/>
part of 20 years to overcome the effects of an authoritarian upbringing,<br/>
and in<br/>
fact probably still suffer from it at times.  So I know that comment to be<br/>
true<br/>
in the fullest form.  <br/>
<br/>
I thoroughly support this quote and would say it is now how I look at my<br/>
children:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I have noticed that there are not a lot of verses <br/>
about childraising in the bible and I believe that is because we should treat <br/>
our children like anyone else; with love, patience, respect, etc... Notice <br/>
that even God let&#39;s us have free will and we blow it often! So it should go <br/>
with our children. And that is my two cents. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In response to your sharing of scripture I only want to ask you to pull your<br/>
Bible back out and revisit a verse, Gen 1:28 where God told them to multiply<br/>
(i.e., children) and replenish the earth.  It wasn&#39;t until verse 31 that God<br/>
said it was very good.  A man can live alone with no wife and live a life God<br/>
views as very good in our day and time (I Corn. 7:8) and living married is<br/>
also<br/>
looked upon by God as very good in our day and time (I Corn. 7:2 and others.) <br/>
With or without children a marriage is a good thing and as you say lacks<br/>
nothing.  Interestingly, in scripture, the number 3 represents completeness<br/>
- a<br/>
child actually makes a family; there is no family without children, only a<br/>
couple.  So while God had not created children by verse 31 He did in fact<br/>
create the necessary means by which a child could be born.�And even instructed<br/>
Adam and Eve to multiply.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A healthy husband/wife relationship is necessary to the emotional wellbeing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of a child.� &gt;When they see that mom & dad love each other more than anything,<br/>
their world is secure.� &gt;They don&#39;t worry or even think that they aren&#39;t<br/>
loved,<br/>
they know they are.� They don&#39;t need to &gt;be made the center of the family to<br/>
feel love. <br/>
<br/>
This is so true.  They aren&#39;t to be the center of the family; but God should<br/>
be.  And with God in His proper place, the family can function with<br/>
emphasis on<br/>
children or not on children.  That is really left up to the parents.  Children<br/>
should be treated with respect for their feelings on different subjects just<br/>
like adults.  An adult can usually tell if their feelings are truly in need of<br/>
consideration or if they are throwing a temper tantrum, fit of jealousy, etc. <br/>
But we must be able to hear their side of things and weigh the situation<br/>
teaching them how to listen to their feelings but weigh them against what God<br/>
wants in any given situation.  It is much easier to simply be authoritarian -<br/>
you don&#39;t have the judgement calls to make - it is just OBEY!  God does not do<br/>
that to us thus I do not believe God would want us to do that to our<br/>
children. <br/>
Freedom of will is BIG with God!  Christ obeyed God of his own free will unto<br/>
the death of the cross.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This amazes me.  Don&#39;t most parents spend time together in front of their<br/>
children?  Don&#39;t the children see the parents just living life?  I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine telling my dds to sit there and watch Mom and Dad be together - oh and<br/>
by the way, don&#39;t interrupt.  Yikes!  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nor do I condemn you Faith.  It is wonderful to be able to speak what you<br/>
believe in this country isn&#39;t it?  My heart goes out to all children in<br/>
authoritarian homes though, I&#39;ve been at the receiving end and the recovery<br/>
end<br/>
and it has become my decision to live with my children fostering free will,<br/>
individual thinking, questioning and openness.  These make my life very<br/>
challenging at times but it is well worth it to me to know my kids won&#39;t have<br/>
to overcome the mental anguish authoritarianism creates.<br/>
<br/>
Understand that my kids understand that there is appropriate authority in life<br/>
but they also know they can ask questions when they don&#39;t understand<br/>
(something<br/>
I was never allowed to do), they can choose to disagree with me (something<br/>
that<br/>
I was never allowed to do), and they get to live with the consequences of<br/>
their<br/>
actions (something I never got to do until I was free of someone else doing my<br/>
thinking for me - somewhere around age 21.)  By the way my earthly father<br/>
still<br/>
cannot accept the fact that I don&#39;t opt to do things his way.  Thus, even now,<br/>
to him my life is unacceptable.  I even feel sorry for him and the loss he<br/>
suffers from his current attitude toward me and my family.  My brother raises<br/>
his kids like my Dad did me.  My step mother once told me she thought my kids<br/>
were much more peaceful and less angry than my brother&#39;s kids.  Their only<br/>
option to the frustration they feel is to lash out (for which they get<br/>
punished.)  My kids can ask questions (respectfully) and even disagree with<br/>
me.  For their safety of course, Mom and Dad has the last say in anything that<br/>
might harm them.  If it is something that will not physically harm them, we<br/>
will often let them spread their wings - I&#39;d rather be there to pick up the<br/>
pieces now and help them see how to avoid these things in the future while<br/>
they<br/>
are still under my wing.<br/>
<br/>
Doing my best as well,<br/>
<br/>

In His Service,<br/>
