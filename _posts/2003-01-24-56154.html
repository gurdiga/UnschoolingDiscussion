ACK!! You just HAD to go and do that dincha?<br/>
If it was a choice between AK and conference, I&#39;d have to choose AK. That&#39;s <br/>
my family and all (yes, I actually really like them).<br/>
BUT, I don&#39;t have to choose, we&#39;ll be back from AK in time. The issue is <br/>
whether or not babsy boy will wean himself or not.<br/>
If he does, I&#39;m coming. If he doesn&#39;t I&#39;m not. sigh....<br/>
I just can&#39;t do another trip with the kids that close together, they don&#39;t <br/>
really relish the thought of driving that far anyway.<br/>
So the cool part is I might be coming to the conference childless with <br/>
LeaAnn!!!<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mind hanging with the red wine on the roof ladies this year. :)<br/>
I don&#39;t see this child weaning himself anytime soon, but there is a sliver of <br/>
hope.<br/>

    It could be quite fun to do a late night party. Game Night was fun<br/>
but...That is as long as it&#39;s on saturday night. That way people like me<br/>
driving in can make it past midnight and driving home isn&#39;t a hazard. &lt;sg&gt;<br/>

No Anniversary (mines in mid July), just the yearly trek to Alaska. I really <br/>
need it too, since the last time we went (a year ago) was a fast and very sad <br/>
trip.<br/>
I would LOVE to meet Helen, if she has the time. My sis lives just up the <br/>
road in Wasilla, right next to Palmer, so maybe? :)<br/>
We&#39;re going to AK after my anniversary and coming home in early August if all <br/>
goes well. It depends on work and such. I might just quit my job and go to <br/>
massage therapy school...not decided if this is good timing or if I should <br/>
wait until next year.....so many things up in the air.<br/>
So August 22nd is a good date!! We&#39;ll see if Jalen agrees.....Daddy can&#39;t <br/>
nurse him at night so he needs to at least be sleeping better at night.<br/>
I could feasably go to the conference without weaning and pick back up when I <br/>
got home. But Mark won&#39;t be able to cope well if Jalen is still waking up <br/>
more than once.<br/>

I am really looking forward to the conference.  I have been with other <br/>
unschoolers for years on the internet but aside from Ren and another <br/>
lady, haven&#39;t met any in real life.  I can&#39;t imagine a bunch in one <br/>
place.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the cold, I grew up in it too but I guess I&#39;ve been south too <br/>
long.  It&#39;s been down to 30 some here and I can&#39;t stand it.  My 10 yr <br/>
old asked the other day if we could drive up and play in the snow.  He <br/>
wants to go ice skating again.   I&#39;m thinking about it but I&#39;m scared <br/>
to drive in it! I love the things Cols and surrounding communities has <br/>
to offer.....if they could just get rid of that cold stuff!  We went <br/>
to see Tecumseh in Aug last yr and it was awesome!  Oh...and the kids <br/>
always want to go to COSI.  <br/>
<br/>
How did I live up there and not meet you?   I look forward to meeting <br/>
you too!<br/>

    I know what you mean about IRL people. There just aren&#39;t that many<br/>
radical unschoolers here. A lot think they are. Some really seem to<br/>
understand but just can&#39;t let go of things. It makes life quite<br/>
intersting.;-)<br/>
    The snow is falling and the snowman making will probably happen sometime<br/>
today. This is the first snowfall that has been inches instead of 1 or 2&quot;.<br/>
My ds is looking forward to using the snowball maker I got him for<br/>
christmas. He&#39;s tryed before but there just wasn&#39;t enough. I definity<br/>
understand not wanting to drive through the mountains in this stuff. We<br/>
don&#39;t have a SUV or truck so it&#39;s slow going around town.<br/>
    I really want to go to Tecumseh and Blue Jacket this summer. I think my<br/>
youngest can now take the loudness and not freak out. Just yesterday Iwas<br/>
talking to a friend about the Renaissance Fest south of here. I&#39;d like to go<br/>
to that sometime too. We liked the old COSI better. IMO Toledo has the best<br/>
COSI now. Even though we plan on going to ours again soon. There&#39;s so much<br/>
to do and see. Can you tell I love my Ohio? LOL!<br/>
    If you get up my way before conference give me a holler and we could do<br/>
lunch or something. :-)<br/>

I didn&#39;t meet any IRL unschoolers the year I lived up there <br/>
either.....and I looked.  I knew a couple of homeschoolers from the <br/>
past but I just didn&#39;t fit in with them.  My kids are dying to go back <br/>
and play in the snow.  The first time they had seen snow was the yr we <br/>
moved there....in 2000.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 yr old...who is into history sat throught he entire Tecumseh <br/>
show....I asked him about halfway if he knew what was going on and he <br/>
nooded his head,  wouldn&#39;t even look away from the show.  It was <br/>
great. I am a genealogy addict though and love history...have lots of <br/>
Ohio history books laying around.  Maybe that&#39;s why he enjoyed it so <br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh.  The Renaissance Fest....we went there too cause the 15 yr old <br/>
is into anything medieval,  did I spell that right?  Ren got jealous <br/>
when I showed her the pics.  It was awesome.  I haven&#39;t been to <br/>
Toledo&#39;s COSI but will have to go now.  I remember taking field trips <br/>
every yr to the old one in Cols.  I also went to school at Central so <br/>
it was interesting to see how they used the building.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still thinking of making the trip....I&#39;ll yell if I get up that <br/>
way.  Thanks for the invite!<br/>
