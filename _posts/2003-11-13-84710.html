Hi, Melanie --<br/>
<br/>
Talk of the Nation should be live at the same time nationwide.  They are <br/>
about half way through the first hour now and they are talking about <br/>
Iraq.  The possible segment on homeschooling is still to come.  (cross <br/>
your fingers)<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the WBEZ schedule and it looks like they chose not to carry <br/>
Talk of the Nation.<br/>
<br/>
There are some places you can listen to the radio on the internet that I <br/>
haven&#39;t used.<br/>
<br/>
If you start from this page for Talk of the Nation...<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/index.html">http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
... then there is a button on the left side that says NPR program <br/>
stream.  You may have to download a free media player to get it to work.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you could try these stations that claim to be within <br/>
reach of Chicago:<br/>
    WILL-AM: 580.0<br/>
    WBAA-AM: 920.0</div>
