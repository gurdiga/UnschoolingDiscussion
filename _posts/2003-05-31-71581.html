 </span></blockquote>Olga, you have to find a way to convince yourself that whether or not you<br/>
&quot;see&quot; their learning, they are still learning. Just because you can&#39;t follow<br/>
through with more resources about a topic, it doesn&#39;t take away whatever it<br/>
is your kids have gotten from the original source.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?<br/>

Zoe recently read &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; I read it so long ago, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
really have a great conversation with her about it. So, I don&#39;t know what<br/>
she took away from it, but whatever it is still exists IN HER.<br/>
