Enough time has passed.  Shakespeare is now available translated side-by-side.<br/>

Interesting.  Probably within some current lifetimes the plays might be <br/>
performed or filmed that way.<br/>
<br/>
I found it trying to find maybe an online count of how many times the word <br/>
&quot;chat&quot; is used in The Taming of the Shrew.  <br/>

<br/>
Act II, Scene I<br/>
PETRUCHIO<br/>
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;<br/>
I love her ten times more than e&#39;er I did:<br/>
O, how I long to have some chat with her!<br/>
<br/>
PETRUCHIO<br/>
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:<br/>
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,<br/>
<br/>
Act III, Scene II<br/>
PETRUCHIO<br/>
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha&#39; done with words:<br/>
To me she&#39;s married, not unto my clothes:<br/>
Could I repair what she will wear in me,<br/>
As I can change these poor accoutrements,<br/>
&#39;Twere well for Kate and better for myself.<br/>
But what a fool am I to chat with you,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Act V, Scene II<br/>
LUCENTIO<br/>
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:<br/>
And time it is, when raging war is done,<br/>
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.<br/>
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,<br/>
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.<br/>
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,<br/>
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,<br/>
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:<br/>
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,<br/>
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;<br/>
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.<br/>
<br/>
Plus &quot;chattering&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Act IV, Scene II<br/>
TRANIO<br/>
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;<br/>
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,<br/>
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076769321">Those have been around a while. We had them when I was in high school. And<br/>
there are a lot of versions of Shakespeare being performed with original<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s depressing.  When Shakespeare-study was the big rage, 19th <br/>
century, it wasn&#39;t so archaic.  Now people have a hard time understanding <br/>
some of the language in 19th century writing, so Shakespeare is REALLY old.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier for people who grew up memorizing chunks of the King James Bible, <br/>
but that&#39;s fading too (both the translation and the memorization).<br/>
<br/>
And with it side by side, people can look over to see what&#39;s what in a really <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826944839">I agree - I love the traditional interpretations and find it fascinating<br/>
that my children can even follow them - but I also love the modern<br/>
interpretations in all their varied creativity. I love how language evolves<br/>
and also love many of its archaic forms. I don&#39;t think you have to choose<br/>
with these things - although in art school there was plenty of choosing<br/>
sides on these issues. I, again, found myself in the middle kind of liking<br/>

I was listening to The Taming of the Shrew (which has to go back to Hollywood <br/>

Apparently yes!  <br/>

If I never looked at what I was wondering about, I would have never found the <br/>
thousands of side paths that have taken me to finding so many other things.<br/>

The guy who played Kate&#39;s dad also played Rodrigo&#39;s dad in El Cid.  That was <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57768642">I think you&#39;re right - it is more beautiful in its original form, but I also<br/>
think that falling in love with other versions sort of leads you to the<br/>

So is Beowulf, they say.  I&#39;m not learning Anglo Saxon for that, though.<br/>
I did learn Middle English enough to read Chaucer aloud in the &quot;right&quot; <br/>
(reconstructed, guessed-at) way and to understand it.  Whoopty do!  There were jokes <br/>
you had to understand Middle English to get, and some nice rhymes.   It was <br/>
like playing a game, learning a historical thing for fun.<br/>
<br/>
To acknowledge that only SOME people have an interest in words for the <br/>
historical sake of words is just being open to the idea of multiple intelligences.   <br/>
I think it&#39;s probably unfair that scholars cling doggedly to the idea that <br/>
knowing some Shakespeare is necessary for being a well-rounded, educated person. <br/>
 I love Shakespeare, but I don&#39;t fault people who don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Shakespeare SHOULD go the way of Chaucer.  People do fine in life <br/>
without being able to qoute or reference The Canterbury Tales.   People do fine <br/>
without knowing Mozart&#39;s operas (or anyone else&#39;s).   People can do fine without <br/>
Shakespeare.<br/>
<br/>
But if Shakespeare IS to be &quot;required&quot; and if the stories ARE important, then <br/>
translations are a good thing.   And the huge benefit of a side-by-side <br/>
translation is that someone can be reading along and as soon as they don&#39;t <br/>
understand something they can look at the other side.<br/>
<br/>
I have a Bible with four translations, and all across the open two pages.  <br/>
It&#39;s one of the coolest books!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023134781">Actually, what&#39;s really cool about Shakespeare is that the stories are<br/>
timeless....our drama group has taken Shakespeare and performed it in<br/>
different time periods...such as the Rocking 50&#39;s (A Midsummer Night&#39;s<br/>
Dream), the wild west (A Comedy of Errors), ancient Rome (Julius<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814596125">Well - they&#39;re reworked already in Shakespeare. He didn&#39;t come up with his<br/>
own stories. I mean he took from others who also used language in poetic<br/>
ways of their times. When poets and writers now rework the works of<br/>
Shakespeare there is the potential for new interesting works that use the<br/>
language poetically in a contemporary way. It&#39;s always been this way. I love<br/>
Shakespeare for the language too - but I love some beat poets for the same<br/>
reason - albeit entirely different usage. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483405801">I think the process of translation is fascinatingly, and the idea of<br/>
translating something that most of us can mostly understand already just<br/>
serves to highlight the problems that exist for all translation work.<br/>
<br/>
What does it mean to translate poetry for example?  What parts of the<br/>
original are you trying to preserve, and which are allowed (or forced)<br/>
to change?  Is it harder or easier with metered verse?  Is it mostly<br/>
about the rhythm or the meaning of the words, or maybe the emotional<br/>
resonance?  There&#39;s a very interesting essay about these issues in<br/>
Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s book &quot;Meta Magical Themas,&quot; particularly as it<br/>
relates to translating titles and the &quot;slip-ability&quot; of our concepts and<br/>
words.  Stanislaw Lem is a Polish author (highly recommended by the way)<br/>
whose work is stuffed full of all kinds of wordplay, and I believe all<br/>
of his work was originally written in Polish.  In one of his short<br/>
stories (which I read in an English translation) someone is challenged<br/>
to write a poem about a particular subject in a particular meter where<br/>
every word starts with the letter s.  The translation does it!  I would<br/>
die to know what sort of changes this entailed!  Does the original have<br/>
the same subject?  Use the same letter?  Same meter?  Sadly, I don&#39;t<br/>
know anyone that speaks polish to check it out for me ;)<br/>
<br/>
To try gamely to wrestle this back around to unschooling... is there<br/>
anyone on the list who has kids (or is a kid) interested in learning a<br/>
second language in a non-class environment?  What kinds of strategies<br/>
work for people?  I&#39;m currently trying to read the first Harry Potter<br/>
book side by side in english and spanish.  It&#39;s interesting, but I don&#39;t<br/>
know if I could ever get fluent this way ;)  Certainly not speaking<br/>
fluent, but maybe reading...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105670766">I think Shakespeare&#39;s use of the language of the time is superior to the<br/>
translators of biblical work who created the King James version of the bible<br/>
- so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want the original Shakespeare to be lost or that I<br/>
think it could be replaced by the King James Bible. But the bigger point<br/>
here is that even Shakespeare was adapting rehashed old stories with his<br/>
work. Those weren&#39;t really original stories - that&#39;s what playwrights did<br/>
then (and now to some degree) - they took old stories and made them new<br/>
again by adapting them with some contemporary language and sensibilities.<br/>
And there&#39;s not only nothing wrong with rehashing old stories - but it&#39;s<br/>
positively traditional. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719033459">You&#39;re right Sandra, I should have been more specific about that. Some of<br/>
Shakespeare&#39;s work was original. Much of it was was not (considering story)<br/>
and it was not frowned upon (nor is it now) to take stories from the past<br/>
and rehash them. Each artist&#39;s interpretation has the possibility of<br/>
creating something new. There are also some (like Joseph Campbell) who would<br/>
argue that all stories have some archetypal connection to the earliest<br/>
stories and all that we create is merely a rehashing of that which we all<br/>
already know. And I think Ecclesiastes said &quot;There is nothing new under the<br/>
sun.&quot; Although he said it in either Greek or Hebrew and mine is only a badly<br/>
butchered paraphrase of an English translation. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450069048">Hi Emile - my kids and I lived in Montreal for a year and the way we<br/>
&quot;studied&quot; French was somewhat of an immersion technique. They were in school<br/>
at the time and went to an English speaking school but did get quite a bit<br/>
of French instruction - vocabulary etc (which they hated) but we would watch<br/>
French stations. I started saying the standard things in French<br/>
(pardonez-moi, ou est la toilette, je suis desolet - don&#39;t trust my spelling<br/>
on these though) and the kids sort of followed after a while. We also read<br/>
French signs (Montreal has laws about signage - so there was a lot of<br/>
side-by-side language we could check against) and listened in and tried to<br/>
understand other&#39;s conversations. For me, I was involved in a sculpture<br/>
program at Concordia U - which is English speaking, however, because it&#39;s a<br/>
French (and English) culture, if someone asked a professor a question in<br/>
French, the professor would answer in French. This immersion makes your<br/>
brain really work at trying to figure things out so much more efficiently<br/>
than any other way of learning - it&#39;s how we learn our own language. I would<br/>
suggest a class or two in basic structure though - this way you have a good<br/>
foundation and don&#39;t have to struggle with different grammar structure. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108121394">** To try gamely to wrestle this back around to unschooling... is there<br/>
anyone on the list who has kids (or is a kid) interested in learning a<br/>
second language in a non-class environment?  What kinds of strategies<br/>
work for people?  I&#39;m currently trying to read the first Harry Potter<br/>
book side by side in english and spanish.  It&#39;s interesting, but I don&#39;t<br/>
know if I could ever get fluent this way ;)  Certainly not speaking<br/>
fluent, but maybe reading...**<br/>

Hi, Emile --<br/>
<br/>
My son isn&#39;t specifically trying to learn a second language, but I am.  <br/>
And I&#39;m doing the same thing you are; reading HP #1 in Spanish.  (But <br/>
not from a cold start.  I had a year of Spanish in Jr. High School more <br/>
than 30 years ago.  And I recently watched through the episodes of <br/>
Destinos, a fake telenovela designed to teach Spanish that is shown on <br/>
some PBS stations.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun when you know from context that that verb must be &quot;swish&quot; and <br/>
the next verb must be &quot;flick&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451037229">Why don&#39;t you put an ad on craigslist or in the paper looking for people to<br/>
practice with? Spanish should be a relatively easy one.<br/>

 Yeah, the immersion stuff seems like the way to go, if the method<br/>
requiring the most drastic changes.  I&#39;ve wondered about looking for<br/>
people that are native speakers of another language who would like<br/>
english &quot;lessons&quot; and trying to work out some reciprocal thing; one day<br/>
a week we could get together and work on english, one day to the other<br/>
language or something.  I&#39;m not very good at finding and introducing<br/>
myself to random people though ;)<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
