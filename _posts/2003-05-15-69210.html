<div id="ygrps-yiv-831312736">I&#39;ve read Skellig and Stargirl with my daughters.<br/>
<br/>
Stargirl had such extreme caricatures of both the homeschooled and the<br/>
schooled kids.  I think part of the point was to make people think about<br/>
teenage conformity and non-comformity.<br/>
<br/>
Skellig is just...  very interesting!  I cried at parts of it.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to an adult book club.  We read a children&#39;s book about once a<br/>
year, and have discussed both Harry Potter and Stargirl there.  We read Snow<br/>
Falling on Cedars, by David Guterson, who also wrote a homeschooling book<br/>
called Family Matters.  Anyway, I later heard that Snow Falling on Cedars<br/>
was banned in a Texas high school because of the sex in it and my first<br/>
thought was what sex?  Then I remembered that there were a couple of minor<br/>
sex scenes, but they were such a small part of the story and both took place<br/>
between willing partners who really cared for each other.   They just didn&#39;t<br/>
stand out to me in my reading of the story.  It is an excellent book by the<br/>
way, and deals with Japenese internment in America during WWII and takes<br/>
place in the San Juan Islands on America&#39;s and Canada&#39;s West Coasts.   One<br/>
of women in my book club commented that when she was a teen, she went out of<br/>
her way to read banned books.  She wanted to see what they were trying to<br/>
keep from her.<br/>
