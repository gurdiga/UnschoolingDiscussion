<div id="ygrps-yiv-200624612"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="3" FAMILY="SCRIPT" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Hello all,
<br>I just joined the list yesterday, and am beginning to regret that. &nbsp;I thought 
<br>this was a list for unschooling, not bashing other religions or personal 
<br>views! &nbsp;I happen to be Roman Catholic, and using birth control is against 
<br>church teaching, yes, but it is not a mortal sin, it is a venial sin. &nbsp;Venial 
<br>sins do not break our relationship with God completely as mortal sins do. &nbsp;
<br>Mortal sins are things like murder and other such capital crimes. &nbsp;And, as 
<br>all real Christian believe, if they believe in the One True God, ANYTHING can 
<br>be forgiven by God if one comes with a repentant heart! &nbsp;So why are we 
<br>discussing this on the unschooling list? &nbsp;I will give it some time to see if 
<br>this is just one of those threads that happens now and then on any list, or 
<br>if it is an ongoing thing I will definitely unsub. &nbsp;
<br>I am also curious as to exactly what is a Pagan? &nbsp;So if they ladies that said 
<br>they were Pagan would please email me off list and let me know, I have always 
<br>wondered. &nbsp;I promise I will not try to convert you, or bash your beliefs, I 
<br>am just truly a curious person and have always loved to study world 
<br>religions. &nbsp;Thanks!

  more Catholics on the unschooling lists. Some good friends of ours, former 
  neighbors now living in Michigan, started homeschooling/unschooling partly (I 
  hope) because they saw we were having so much fun with 
  it.&nbsp;They&#39;re&nbsp;Catholic, while we&#39;re Lutheran. And the mom was a public 
  school teacher, now a SAHM of 4.&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128485195">Welcome Paula,<br/>
    We&#39;ve had lots of productive sharing about our children&#39;s learning and <br/>
growing and about our role in all that. I suggest you read through the <br/>
archives.<br/>
     However, as unschooling is about learning from life there are lots of <br/>
other subjects that have been discussed and argued about also. It seems that <br/>
we have a lot of different communication styles in this group as well as <br/>
different ideas about what&#39;s appropriate or productive to talk about. <br/>
Whenever I&#39;ve objected to something that&#39;s going on, someone has disagreed <br/>
with me and given interesting reasons. By the way I&#39;ve only done this <br/>
publicly, I haven&#39;t sent any private e-mails. I do think we should try to ask <br/>
questions of each other rather than attacking. Still, I can understand how we <br/>
can sometimes have strong reactions to each other. Is it surprising that <br/>
we&#39;re each so unique and interesting? <br/>
with Love and Peace to all, Amalia</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519262565">Welcome Paula! I saw bits of pieces of your intro days ago but am finally<br/>
seeing the real thing. Looks as if the religious discussion has died down a<br/>
bit. Now, I don&#39;t know if this is an ignorant question about Catholics and<br/>
birth control or what, but I&#39;ll ask it anyway. LOL. When you say birth<br/>
control is a venial sin, do you mean artificial forms like condoms, birth<br/>
control pills, etc.? Since natural family planning is a form of birth<br/>
control and is used by many Catholic (and non-Catholic) families I know, I&#39;m<br/>
assuming that&#39;s okay. Is this correct?<br/>
