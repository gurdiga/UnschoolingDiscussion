Subject: This week in the HSI e-Alert<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This week in the Health Sciences Institute e-Alert<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; **************************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This week in the HSI Forum<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; An important warning appears in the HSI Forum this week,<br/>
&gt; posted in a thread titled &quot;Soy-onara&quot; - which, not<br/>
&gt; coincidentally, is also the title of Tuesday&#39;s e-Alert about<br/>
&gt; a Japanese study that examined the effects of soy and other<br/>
&gt; isoflavone-rich foods on breast cancer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; An HSI member who goes by the name of Chefgirl explains that<br/>
&gt; at the age of 12 she was diagnosed as hypothyroid - a<br/>
&gt; condition in which the thyroid gland produces inadequate<br/>
&gt; amounts of two key hormones that help regulate metabolism.<br/>
&gt; She points out that soy plays havoc for people with thyroid<br/>
&gt; problems such as hers because the soy isoflavones limit the<br/>
&gt; cells&#39; ability to receive thyroid hormones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chefgirl writes: &quot;In reality, soy protein is one of the worst<br/>
&gt; things that I could consume, especially on a daily basis. I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t begin to tell you the difference I felt when I stopped<br/>
&gt; eating soy products, just within 2-3 days.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What infuriates her - and rightfully so - is that she<br/>
&gt; consumed soy products for 10 years, &quot;thinking I was eating<br/>
&gt; healthy and being told that was the case.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In particular, I was concerned with one detail in Chefgirl&#39;s<br/>
&gt; posting: her comment that the isoflavones in soy are<br/>
&gt; responsible for thyroid dysfunction. If soy isoflavones cause<br/>
&gt; thyroid problems, wouldn&#39;t that also be true of other<br/>
&gt; sources, such as red clover (which we&#39;ve recommended as an<br/>
&gt; alternative to soy)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A little legwork with our research sources soon turned up a<br/>
&gt; comment on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center web<br/>
&gt; site, warning that due to the estrogenic activity of red<br/>
&gt; clover, it should be used with caution by patients with<br/>
&gt; hormone-sensitive diseases. And that would include thyroid<br/>
&gt; conditions, of course.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you consume a high quantity of soy foods, or if you use<br/>
&gt; red clover, here are some of the symptoms of hypothyroid<br/>
&gt; disease that you should be aware of: low energy, slowing of<br/>
&gt; the healing process, edema (swelling, usually in the feet or<br/>
&gt; legs), and unusual changes in skin, nails or hair.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This serves as a perfect reminder that herbal supplements are<br/>
&gt; natural medicines that can have powerful effects and should<br/>
&gt; be used with care. So if you&#39;ve been diagnosed with thyroid<br/>
&gt; problems, you should probably avoid soy, red clover, and<br/>
&gt; other foods or botanicals touted as high in isoflavones. And<br/>
&gt; as always, consult your doctor whenever you use any<br/>
&gt; nutritional or herbal remedy to address a medical condition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other topics being discussed on the HSI Forum this week<br/>
&gt; include:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * If you have any doubt that genetic modification of crops is<br/>
&gt;   a hot button issue, just visit the thread &quot;GM Foods,&quot; which<br/>
&gt;   has more than 80 postings in a very lively debate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * A thread titled &quot;McDonald&#39;s to Eliminate Using Beef...&quot; is<br/>
&gt;   a reaction to Wednesday&#39;s e-Alert, &quot;McMedicine&quot; (see<br/>
&gt;   below), but Big Macs may not be as antibiotic-free as we<br/>
&gt;   are supposed to believe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * An HSI member named Lee offers a warning in &quot;Forteo, Unsafe<br/>
&gt;   Drug for Osteoporosis.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Double Whammy<br/>
&gt; Patients with type 2 diabetes can reduce the risk of a heart<br/>
&gt; attack or a stroke by 25 percent by using cholesterol-<br/>
&gt; lowering statin drugs - even if they don&#39;t have elevated<br/>
&gt; cholesterol levels - according to two recent studies. And<br/>
&gt; while that may sound promising, you can be certain that there<br/>
&gt; are gremlins in the details. This e-Alert looks at the<br/>
&gt; misguided logic of trading a lower risk of one problem, for<br/>
&gt; the side effects that come with a lifetime supply of multiple<br/>
&gt; prescription drugs.<br/>

&gt; Soy-onara<br/>
&gt; Does soy intake help prevent breast cancer? In spite of what<br/>
&gt; you may have heard, there&#39;s no easy answer to that question,<br/>
&gt; which is at the heart of a long, ongoing debate. But a<br/>
&gt; recently completed 10-year study from Japan reveals some<br/>
&gt; promising new clues that could eventually lead to useful<br/>
&gt; answers. We&#39;ll tell you about the best source for the<br/>
&gt; compound that is believed to be the active component in<br/>
&gt; preventing breast cancer.<br/>

&gt; Last week McDonald&#39;s Corporation told its meat suppliers to<br/>
&gt; discontinue the use of antibiotics in animals. But let&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; jump to the conclusion that McDonald&#39;s menu is going to be<br/>
&gt; anything close to antibiotic-free. The details of this new<br/>
&gt; policy leave something to be desired, especially in the face<br/>
&gt; of the ticking time bomb of human antibiotic resistance that<br/>
&gt; is rapidly developing through the general consumption of<br/>
&gt; commercial meat products.<br/>

&gt; P53, Where Are You?<br/>
&gt; Selenium has been shown to reduce both the risk and mortality<br/>
&gt; for prostate, liver and colorectal cancers. Now another<br/>
&gt; cancer can be added to that list: one that&#39;s closely<br/>
&gt; associated with chronic heartburn and acid reflux. We&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; examine the groundbreaking details of this important new<br/>
&gt; study, and tell you why getting more selenium in your diet<br/>
&gt; might be one of the best preventive health measures you can<br/>
&gt; take.<br/>
