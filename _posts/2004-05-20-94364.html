<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117348567">Here are a few answers my 15 year old son gave recently. Please feel free to<br/>
ask any other questions you might have here or privately and we can see if<br/>
we can help you. :) Jane<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Question #1 - How would you &quot;define&quot; unschooling?<br/>
I don&#39;t know if there is a way to define unschooling, I just do my things<br/>
and go day to day doing what I want to do. I find it&#39;s the best &quot;life style&quot;<br/>
for me. There aren&#39;t many rules to follow and barely any structure. In<br/>
public school I never felt like I ever got enough time to read into subjects<br/>
I was being force fed, but with unschooling, instead of just going from<br/>
subject to subject I&#39;ll go in phases where I&#39;ll take any knowledge I can<br/>
get. For a while I was a beatnik, reading only Kerouac, Burroughs, Kesey and<br/>
Ginsberg and then I&#39;ll be interested in urban legends and social sciences. I<br/>
never set out to be an unschooler, I guess I just am.<br/>
<br/>
Question #2 - What is your favorite thing about homeschooling?<br/>
Everything, way too many list off, so here is a few:<br/>
#1. I like not being confined in the walls of a school all day long.<br/>
#2. I like the ability to learn at my own pace when and where I want<br/>
#3. I like to be able to have a Job(Puppeteering,Working with Loran (his<br/>
dad), T-shirts)<br/>
#4. I like being able to go where ever I want at my leisure, not having to<br/>
ask for a hall pass or excuse slip.<br/>
#5. I like the more realistic social settings than the social settings in<br/>
school where you are kept with people your own age, except your teacher, and<br/>
able to have friendships with everyone from 8 to 80 instead of your<br/>
designated age range.<br/>
<br/>
Question #3 - What is a typical day like for you? (what are you &quot;into&quot;?)<br/>
I wake up at my leisure, take a shower, eat breakfast, Some days I go to the<br/>
thrift store down the street and buy some records or something and then come<br/>
home work around the house, work on the computer, go somewhere, read<br/>
whenever, ride a bike around, talk to people, take some photos. When I was<br/>
doing &quot;The Mikado&quot;  puppet show at the folly theater, I lived with some<br/>
friends, the Usher&#39;s,  in Kansas city and rode my bike to work everyday,<br/>
which was 5 blocks away from the Folly. I got to do alot of sight seeing in<br/>
downtown Kansas city and I always had a camera, when I had rehearsals I<br/>
worked over on Linwood and Troost and would ride over there and in the<br/>
afternoon ride back to the Ushers or I&#39;d go to Westport or the Plaza or to<br/>
my girlfriend Ida&#39;s. That was a much further ride like many miles. I feel<br/>
like that was a good &quot;unschooling&quot; experience and know that If I were in<br/>
school I&#39;d never have those experiences.<br/>
