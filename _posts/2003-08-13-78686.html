<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037947516">Some of you may remember that my son (now 16) took Algebra II <br/>
at the local high school last year. It was completely new to us as <br/>
we had never had him in any school of any kind before that. And <br/>
it served to show me just ho easily bound up in school <br/>
expectations I can become. Sandra and others really helped me <br/>
to step back from the automatic school-y ways that set in as I <br/>
pressured, cajoled, nagged and reminded my son to work <br/>
harder. Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday we went to his counselor appointment. He was <br/>
slated to take Adv. Math, computer science, Sign language and <br/>
Music Theory. But he had decided this summer that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want any more math. I worried since his choice of profession is <br/>
computer game design and programming.<br/>
<br/>
But what a pleasant surprise I had in store for me yesterday. His <br/>
counselor pressed him to take the math and he took control of <br/>
the conversation saying that he had researched and found that <br/>
he doesn&#39;t even necessarily need college let alone advanced <br/>
math for what he plans to do in the gaming world. The counselor <br/>
sort of clucked her tongue at him and he replied, &quot;If I need the <br/>
math to do the work I&#39;m actually doing, I&#39;ll get it then. I see no <br/>
need to ruin next year with math I don&#39;t like that I will forget <br/>
anyway.&quot; The counselor sort of broke out laughing and said, <br/>
&quot;Well, I can&#39;t argue with that logic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She then said with disappointment, &quot;Shoot Noah. I thought we&#39;d <br/>
get you here for all seven periods one of these years.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He replied, &quot;No way. You&#39;ll never get me here for that many <br/>
periods. I like my life too much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He then worked out his schedule so that he can be with the <br/>
computer science teacher (who he really likes) for study hall as <br/>
well as class and lunch hour (three hours to work with an <br/>
expert). ASL and Music Theory are on trial. he&#39;ll drop them like <br/>
hot potatoes if they aren&#39;t engaging, says he. <br/>
<br/>
As we left he said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how school kids can stand those <br/>
counselors. She was so condescending. Maybe they&#39;re used to <br/>
being treated like little helpless kids that don&#39;t know what they <br/>
want to do with their own lives. But I can&#39;t stand it. There is no <br/>
possible way I&#39;d ever want to spend my entire day in a place like <br/>
this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I smiled. And I learned a lot. Let Noah do the talking. He really <br/>
does know what he wants and where he&#39;s going. I&#39;ve just got to <br/>
get out of the way.<br/>

Good for him and good for you. Sounds like all is going well. I&#39;m glad you<br/>
were able to see how he&#39;s doing with it all. That will certainly help you<br/>
stay out of the way whenever you need to again. &lt;BG&gt; Great story.<br/>

I&#39;m new to the list and wonder if you can review the background of how you<br/>
and your son arranged with the high school to take just the classes he<br/>
wants.  I always thought that with public school you had to take the whole<br/>
package. I have a ds, now 16, who&#39;s been out of public school since 5th<br/>
grade. It would be great to know how we could use the system for our own<br/>
purposes, if he so desires.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any information you can provide.<br/>

<br/>
It really depends on the school district. Tehcnically, you have the <br/>
right to take any clases you want. Your tax dollars pay for public <br/>
education. The school districts ought to want you as they get a <br/>
portion of the ADAs (Average Daily Attendance monies) for <br/>
whatever number of classes your son takes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d call the guidance office at your local school district to find out if <br/>
they are familiar with part time enrollment. If they give you the <br/>
cold shoulder brush off, ignore it and call the district. Go to the <br/>
superintendant. Tell him that you know they get money if your <br/>
son attends and that you won&#39;t take no for an answer, you simply <br/>
want to know &quot;how&quot; to make it happen. Be persistent and let him <br/>
know that you know school districts around the country offer part <br/>
time enrollment so he can&#39;t say it isn&#39;t done. Remnind him/her <br/>
that you are a tax payer.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally your son shouldn&#39;t even have to prove his skill level or <br/>
anything. Sometimes it helps to contact the teacher of the class <br/>
he wants first so that the teacher will go to bat for you as well.<br/>
<br/>
One of my friends had to make about a million phone calls in CA <br/>
to get the school to finally accept her daughter (so that she could <br/>
also play basketball). But she did it! It just took repeatedly telling <br/>
the school administrators that she had the right and that she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t give up until they accomodated her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m lucky. Our school district loves homeschoolers and bends <br/>
over backwards to include them... for the money. :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
right to take any clases you want. Your tax dollars pay for public <br/>
<br/>
education.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It does depend on the school district, <br/>
but there are no technical rights.<br/>
<br/>
You have the right to be enrolled if you&#39;re under 18 and you legally reside <br/>
in that district.  But the terms of enrollment can be set by district and state.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a buffet.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The school districts ought to want you as they get a <br/>
<br/>
portion of the ADAs (Average Daily Attendance monies) for <br/>
<br/>
whatever number of classes your son takes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not enrolled at least half time, they  might not be able to get <br/>
anything.  AND their liability insurance won&#39;t cover non-students, so that&#39;s a <br/>
huge part of getting kids enrolled half or full time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Tell him that you know they get money if your <br/>
<br/>
son attends and that you won&#39;t take no for an answer, you simply <br/>
<br/>
want to know &quot;how&quot; to make it happen. Be persistent and let him <br/>
<br/>
know that you know school districts around the country offer part <br/>
<br/>
time enrollment so he can&#39;t say it isn&#39;t done. Remnind him/her <br/>
<br/>
that you are a tax payer.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d leave out that last part, but the first part could work. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Schools are run off property taxes, generally, with some federal aid funding <br/>
on top of all that, and special programs, and sometimes projects run from <br/>
bonds or mill-tax blah blah.  But the state funding usually comes from property <br/>
taxes. <br/>
<br/>
A childless 60 year old guy with a big piece of land in an expensive <br/>
neighborhood can&#39;t go down to the school and say &quot;I&#39;d like to take art and play <br/>
football but THAT IS ALL, and I&#39;m a TAXPAYER!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m lucky. Our school district loves homeschoolers and bends <br/>
<br/>
over backwards to include them... for the money. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It can vary from year to year, too, even in the same district, so it&#39;s <br/>
absolutely worth a try, but they don&#39;t HAVE to do anything but enroll your kid full <br/>
time and treat him like they treat every other kid.  That&#39;s THEIR starting bid.<br/>

I think in California the school only gets money for students who are <br/>
enrolled full-time.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s fairly uncommon for California kids <br/>
to go to public school part-time.  But it looks like, from the example <br/>

<br/>
In New Mexico I think they can get benefits if the kid goes more than half <br/>
time, which is why &quot;The Family School&quot; has kids for a morning and lunch, or <br/>
lunch and an afternoon.  They SAY it&#39;s so the kids in the two sessions can meet <br/>
each other, but I&#39;ve heard that&#39;s what makes their funding.  They get money for <br/>
ALL the kids, though they use the classrooms and lessons twice a day for two <br/>
batches.   <br/>
<br/>
More power to them.  I think alternative programs are better than <br/>
school-as-usual.  But it&#39;s still school at its core.<br/>
