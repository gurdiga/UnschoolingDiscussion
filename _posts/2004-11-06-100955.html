<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130087436">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
We just purchased a bounce house for the kids and we were so pleased <br/>
with it that we wanted to pass on the info!  The kids have been <br/>
bouncing non-stop all day, even the 12 year old is into it!  It&#39;s <br/>
one of those inflatable bounce houses like you see set up in <br/>
someones yard for birthday parties, maybe a bit smaller (but still <br/>
pretty big), nice construction, lots of fun.  We bought it from Home <br/>
Shopping Network (HSN.com, listed under Holiday Gifts, Kids).  It <br/>
was $149, but you can extend the payments out over 4 months ($37/mo) <br/>
and free shipping.  We were so excited about it we couldn&#39;t wait <br/>
till Christmas, hehe!  Hopefully no more long faces as they pass by <br/>
the birthday parties now...they can have a birthday party everyday <br/>
in the backyard.  Check it out at www.hsn.com.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Cyndi</div>
