with all the hate in this world it&#39;s nice to know love still survives.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Something For Stevie<br/>
&gt; By Dan Anderson<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I try not to be biased, but I had my doubts about hiring Stevie.  His<br/>
&gt; placement counselor assured me that he would be a good, reliable<br/>
&gt; busboy.  But I had never had a mentally handicapped employee and<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t sure I wanted one.  I wasn&#39;t sure how my customers would react<br/>
&gt; to Stevie.  He was short, a little dumpy, with the smooth facial<br/>
&gt; features and thick tongued speech of Down syndrome.  I wasn&#39;t worried<br/>
&gt; about most of my trucker customers, because truckers don&#39;t generally<br/>
&gt; care who buses tables as long as the meatloaf platter is good and the<br/>
&gt; pies are homemade.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The four-wheeler drivers were the ones who concerned me; the mouthy<br/>
&gt; college kids traveling to school; the yuppie snobs who secretly<br/>
&gt; polish their silverware with their napkins for fear of catching some<br/>
&gt; dreaded &quot;truckstop germ;&quot; the pairs of white shirted business men on<br/>
&gt; expense accounts who think every truckstop waitress wants to be<br/>
&gt; flirted with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I knew those people would be uncomfortable around Stevie, so I<br/>
&gt; closely watched him for the first few weeks. I shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; worried.  After the first week, Stevie had my staff wrapped around<br/>
&gt; his stubby little finger, and within a month my truck regulars had<br/>
&gt; adopted him as their official truckstop mascot. After that I really<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t care what the rest of the customers thought of him.  He was<br/>
&gt; like a 21- year-old in blue jeans and Nikes, eager to laugh and eager<br/>
&gt; to please, but fierce in his attention to his duties.  Every salt and<br/>
&gt; pepper shaker was exactly in its place, not a bread crumb or coffee<br/>
&gt; spill was visible, when Stevie got done with the table.  Our only<br/>
&gt; problem was persuading him to wait to clean a table until after the<br/>
&gt; customers were finished.  He would hover in the background, shifting<br/>
&gt; his weight from one foot to the other, scanning the dining room until<br/>
&gt; a table was empty.  Then he would scurry to the empty table and<br/>
&gt; carefully bus the dishes and glasses onto the cart and meticulously<br/>
&gt; wipe the table up with a practiced flourish of his rag.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If he thought a customer was watching, his brow would pucker with<br/>
&gt; added concentration.  He took pride in doing his job exactly right,<br/>
&gt; and you had to love how hard he tried to please each and every person<br/>
&gt; he met.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Over time, we learned that he lived with his mother, a widow who was<br/>
&gt; disabled after repeated surgeries for cancer.  They lived on their<br/>
&gt; Social Security benefits in public housing two miles from the<br/>
&gt; truckstop.  Their social worker, who stopped to check on him every so<br/>
&gt; often, admitted they had fallen between the cracks. Money was tight,<br/>
&gt; and what I paid him was probably the difference between them being<br/>
&gt; able to live together and Stevie being sent to a group home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why the restaurant was a gloomy place that morning last<br/>
&gt; August, the first morning in three years that Stevie missed work.  He<br/>
&gt; was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester getting a new valve or something<br/>
&gt; put in his heart.  His social worker said that people with Down<br/>
&gt; Syndrome often had heart problems at an early age, so this wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; unexpected, and there was a good chance he would come through the<br/>
&gt; surgery in good shape and be back at work in a few months.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A ripple of excitement ran through the staff later that morning when<br/>
&gt; word came that he was out of surgery, in<br/>
&gt; recovery and doing fine.  Frannie, my head waitress, let out a war<br/>
&gt; hoop and did a little dance in the aisle when she heard the good<br/>
&gt; news.  Belle Ringer, one of our regular trucker customers, stared at<br/>
&gt; the sight of the 50-year-old grandmother of four doing a victory<br/>
&gt; shimmy beside his table.  Frannie blushed, smoothed her apron and<br/>
&gt; shot Belle Ringer a withering look.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He grinned.  &quot;OK, Frannie, what was that all about?&quot; he asked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;We just got word that Stevie is out of surgery and going to be okay.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I was wondering where he was.  I had a new joke to tell him.  What<br/>
&gt; was the surgery about?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Frannie quickly told Belle Ringer and the other two drivers sitting<br/>
&gt; at his booth about Stevie&#39;s surgery, then sighed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m glad he is going to be OK,&quot; she said, &quot;but I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; how he and his mom are going to handle all the<br/>
&gt; bills.  From what I hear, they re barely getting by as it is.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Belle Ringer nodded thoughtfully, and Frannie hurried off to wait on<br/>
&gt; the rest of her tables.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since I hadn&#39;t had time to round up a busboy to replace Stevie, and<br/>
&gt; really didn&#39;t want to replace him, the girls were busing their own<br/>
&gt; tables that day until we decided what to do.  After the morning rush,<br/>
&gt; Frannie walked into my office.  She had a couple of paper napkins in<br/>
&gt; her hand a funny look on her face.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; I asked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I didn&#39;t get that table where Belle Ringer and his friends were<br/>
&gt; sitting cleared off right after they left, and Pony<br/>
&gt; Pete and Tony Tipper were sitting there when I got back to clean it<br/>
&gt; off,&quot; she said, &quot;this was folded and tucked under a coffee cup.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She handed the napkin to me, and three $20 bills fell onto my desk<br/>
&gt; when I opened it.  On the outside, in big, bold letters, was printed,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Something For Stevie&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Pony Pete asked me what that was all about,&quot; she said, &quot;so I told<br/>
&gt; him about Stevie and his mom and everything, and Pete looked at Tony<br/>
&gt; and Tony looked at Pete, and they ended up giving me this.&quot;  She<br/>
&gt; handed me another paper napkin that had &quot;Something For Stevie&quot;<br/>
&gt; scrawled on it&#39;s outside.  Two $50 bills were tucked within its folds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Frannie looked at me with wet, shiny eyes, shook her head and said<br/>
&gt; simply, &quot;Truckers!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That was three months ago.  Today is Thanksgiving, the first day<br/>
&gt; Stevie is supposed to be back to work.  His placement worker said<br/>
&gt; he&#39;d been counting the days until the doctor said he could work, and<br/>
&gt; it didn&#39;t matter at all that it was a holiday.  He called 10 times in<br/>
&gt; the past week, making sure we knew he was coming, fearful that we had<br/>
&gt; forgotten him or that his job was in jeopardy.  I arranged to have<br/>
&gt; his mother bring him to work, met them in the parking lot and invited<br/>
&gt; them both in to celebrate his day back.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stevie was thinner and paler, but couldn&#39;t stop grinning as he pushed<br/>
&gt; through the doors and headed for the back room where his apron and<br/>
&gt; busing cart were waiting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Hold up there, Stevie, not so fast,&quot; I said.  I took him and his<br/>
&gt; mother by their arms.  &quot;Work can wait for a few minutes.  To<br/>
&gt; celebrate your coming back, breakfast for you and your mother is on<br/>
&gt; me.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I led them toward a large corner booth at the rear of the room. I<br/>
&gt; could feel and hear the rest of the staff following behind as we<br/>
&gt; marched through the dining room.  Glancing over my shoulder, I saw<br/>
&gt; booth after booth of grinning truckers empty and join the procession.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We stopped in front of the big table.  Its surface was covered with<br/>
&gt; coffee cups, saucers and dinner plates, all sitting slightly crooked<br/>
&gt; on dozens of folded paper napkins.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;First thing you have to do, Stevie, is clean up this mess,&quot; I said.<br/>
&gt; I tried to sound stern.  Stevie looked at me, and then at his mother,<br/>
&gt; then pulled out one of the napkins.  It had &quot;Something for Stevie&quot;<br/>
&gt; printed on the outside.  As he picked it up, two $10 bills fell onto<br/>
&gt; the table.  Stevie stared at the money, then at all the napkins<br/>
&gt; peeking from beneath the tableware, each with his name printed or<br/>
&gt; scrawled on it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I turned to his mother.  &quot;There&#39;s more than $10,000 in cash and<br/>
&gt; checks on that table, all from truckers and trucking companies that<br/>
&gt; heard about your problems.  Happy Thanksgiving!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, it got real noisy about that time, with everybody hollering and<br/>
&gt; shouting, and there were a few tears, as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But you know what&#39;s funny?  While everybody else was busy shaking<br/>
&gt; hands and hugging each other, Stevie, with a big, big smile on his<br/>
&gt; face, was busy clearing all the cups and dishes from the table.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best worker I ever hired.<br/>
