<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685646220">I have a question... How do any of you get anything else done in the house <br/>
with having the kids there all day?  I need to clean out the freezer, washing <br/>
the windows outside.... Do you just include your kids in these tasks (then it <br/>
turns a 1 hour job into a 4 hour job) or what?  I can&#39;t do all this stuff <br/>
when they go to bed as then I need to work and although hubby does most of <br/>
that kind of stuff, I&#39;d like to do some of it?  Or are is all your time <br/>
completely with the kids?  My best friend asked me the other day &quot;well how <br/>
are you suppose to get anything done&quot; and I didn&#39;t have an answer for that <br/>
except to say &quot;I&#39;;ll take them with me&quot; (we were talking about going to the <br/>
bank, groceries store etc, outside things)... Then today I realized I need to <br/>
do lots of things around the house... Am I just being overconcerned about <br/>
having the entertain them?<br/>
<br/>
Feedback would be great...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857714051">What do you do now?  Apart from having a window-cleaner and<br/>
doing the absolute minimum (our freezer got cleaned out when the<br/>
plug got unplugged by accident and I had to throw Â£30 of food<br/>
away, ewww, it was rank!) I just kind-of get on and do.  They do<br/>
their bit (like now, or not...)  And I work sometimes during the<br/>
day too.  It depends how engrossed they are in what they&#39;re<br/>
doing.  Though sadly, since we sold our old house, Ive been less<br/>
inclined to get involved in what they&#39;re doing, depression,<br/>
exhaustion and habit, a foul combination...<br/>
