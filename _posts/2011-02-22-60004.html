<div id="ygrps-yiv-16062040">I was talking with Mary Draper about kids learning to read, and telling some stories about friends of Holly&#39;s when she/Holly was learning to read.  I mentioned that both the families I was talking about also ended up divorced, and I thought it wasn&#39;t unrelated.  Not related to the reading, I corrected myself, but from the mother worrying more about what other people thought it looked like she was doing than what she was actually doing.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m saving that for me to think about further and figured people on the list could help me think about it too.<br/>

&quot;[Problems with kids, and ultimately divorce, came from] the mother worrying more about what other people thought it looked like she was doing than what she was actually doing.&quot;<br/>

More self-conscousness than clarity can cause big problems.<br/>
Too much what and not enough why, perhaps.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about the what and why part.  It takes self awareness, to a large <br/>
degree.  If a person is fairly self aware, the what and why tends to get tied <br/>
together.  That produces more clarity.  If you are clear and do consider the <br/>
what and why, then what you DO is what it&#39;s all about.  What you DO should, to <br/>
some extent, show when out and about.  If it doesn&#39;t, or if what you DO isn&#39;t at <br/>
all fitting with the whats and the whys, then you are really just living in BS <br/>
land.  Living in BS land isn&#39;t at all good for any marriage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68889222">Money issues are about this as well if you dig: mother worrying more about<br/>
what other people thought of her family&#39;s needs or what she feels other&#39;s<br/>
idea of a good life is. Keeping up with others ideas as we see them-- not<br/>
as  they see our choices. &quot;Shoulds&quot; must wreck many relationships.<br/>
She feels she should do something or not do it--people are looking.<br/>
