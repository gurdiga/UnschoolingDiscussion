<div id="ygrps-yiv-122299245">We have recently been struggling with the choice of giving up my husband&#39;s <br/>
job near a large city in NY State and taking a much lower paying job close to <br/>
family and several hours from a large town or city.  After growing up focused on <br/>
getting out of the small town and going away to college and &quot;a real life&quot;, <br/>
we&#39;ve realized that living in the suburbs isn&#39;t all that great afterall.  So <br/>
we&#39;ve finally decided to make the move and give up the &quot;extra&quot; income.  We <br/>
already live on a lot less than most of our neighbors since I&#39;m a SAHM, not too many <br/>
around these parts.  It will be a struggle for me to be able to stay home <br/>
with the kids, but I&#39;m hoping we&#39;ll find ways to make ends meet as many other <br/>
families have had to.<br/>
<br/>
We want our children to grow up surrounded by nature, not just visiting it a <br/>
few times a year.  Although $ will be much tighter, I believe my children will <br/>
benefit from being around extended family who adore them.  I look forward to <br/>
getting back into hiking, skiing, and using our canoe again.  <br/>
<br/>
We are a bit concerned about giving up my friends in the area(I belong to <br/>
MOMS Club) and homeschooling groups as well as the museums and GREAT libraries <br/>
that we frequent.  But I hope life in a more rural area will have much to offer <br/>
in other ways, even if the municipal & economic resources are less.<br/>
<br/>
When I write all this out, it seems like such a &quot;no-brainer&quot;, and I&#39;m asking <br/>
myself why have I been having such a hard time making this decision?  I did <br/>
not grow up near extended family & when people told me about Sunday dinners at <br/>
grandma&#39;s or spending the night at the cousin&#39;s house, it seemed so strange to <br/>
me.  Now I want those things for my children.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I&#39;m rambling on and on.  What I&#39;m wondering is if any of you have made <br/>
similar decisions with your families (to move to be with extended families, <br/>
to move to the country, to live on less $) and how it&#39;s been for you.  I would <br/>
apprecitate any insight you might have on this issue.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515301583">We moved from a large city to the country almost 8 years ago and have never<br/>
regretted it.  Our extended family actually came to join US in the last 3<br/>
years.  While we may not have the museums, libraries, concert halls etc. at<br/>
our back door (within a few hours drive if we feel the need for something<br/>
&quot;bigger&quot;) there are so many other avenues to explore and things to do that<br/>
enrich us everyday.  We discovered an old refurbished church that was turned<br/>
into an art center that hosts many intimate events..not on the grand scale<br/>
of a large city but ones in which the kids can be right there involved in<br/>
the performance and asking questions etc.  For me it&#39;s all in how I choose<br/>
to see where we are and why we are here.  In the city we were living a much<br/>
more limiting lifestyle than we ever have here --- we just have a real sense<br/>
of freedom now that wasn&#39;t there before the move.   Life seems to move a bit<br/>
slower here and I truly love that.  Hope that makes some sense.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I havent made the rural vs. city move, but i did move back to <br/>
michigan in january with my 7 yr old son. It was a pretty agonizing <br/>
decision, because his father lives in cincinnati, and moving meant he <br/>
would not see his father every day like he was used to. I quit a job <br/>
where i was making almost $30,000 a year (probably not a huge income <br/>
to most people, but for me it was my first &quot;real&quot; job), gave up our <br/>
three-story house with tons of space (it was falling apart anyway), <br/>
we even had to leave our little dog with seamus&#39; father&#39;s mother. <br/>
Cincinnati had tons of stuff to do, great restaurants, bookstores, <br/>
the zoo, the aquarium, museums, tons of HSers, everything within 10 <br/>
or 20 miles of us. <br/>
<br/>
Now we live with my brother in his 2 bd apt, we have much less space <br/>
and i have to deal with having a roommate again. I work for my mom, <br/>
taking care of her (disabled from a stroke)about four days a week. I <br/>
have to say, our lives are great...seamus and i are almost always <br/>
together, he surrounded by complete love and acceptance from my <br/>
mother, two sisters, two of my brothers who live close, and his very <br/>
best friend in the world, my 8 yr old niece. He didnt have that in <br/>
Cincy. He still sees his father every month. Its not the same though. <br/>
When i moved down to Cincinnati when seamus was 3, i went through the <br/>
same agonizing decision (should he live near his father? Or my close <br/>
family??) I am very happy with what i chose this time. <br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that having the memories of growing up having &quot;Sunday <br/>
dinner at Grandma&#39;s house&quot; (which, like you, i did NOT have as a <br/>
child)is priceless. And if you actually like your family and get <br/>
along well, having that kind of supportive atmosphere around is also <br/>
totally worth the move. Much more important than money and museums.<br/>
