&lt;&lt; I guess the problem I have with this is that vocabulary does not <br/>
influence my thinking much anymore.  And I&#39;m encouraging my kids to <br/>
learn that words are words.  For example, we might be having roast for <br/>
dinner or we might be having a hunk of dead cow.  Either way, it&#39;s the <br/>
same thing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Being called &quot;girl&quot; isn&#39;t the same as being called a woman, when the woman is <br/>
an engineer, or a secretary.  When men call women &quot;girls&quot; they do mean <br/>
something by it, and it does color and affect the way they&#39;re treated.<br/>
<br/>
Being called &quot;African American&quot; isn&#39;t quite the same as &quot;the &#39;n&#39; word.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Words are more powerful than most people realize.<br/>
<br/>
When a family discussed their children&#39;s learning in terms of who taught them <br/>
what, it shows they think thinks need to be taught.  There are truly young <br/>
mothers who think they &quot;taught&quot; their children to walk, or to speak.  <br/>
<br/>
So until people can change the terminology they use, they can&#39;t really change <br/>
mindsets.  If a homeschooling family with a bought curriculum says &quot;my son is <br/>
in 8th grade,&quot; that makes sense in their context.  If an unschooler says &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
unschooling an 8th grader,&quot; that says to me that they are still living in the <br/>
shadow of the school.  <br/>
<br/>
No unschooled child is an any-&quot;grader,&quot; if they&#39;re living an ungraded life of <br/>
full-time learning.<br/>

Well, heck, when I worked at the hotel with the truck drivers, I was <br/>
the *girl* behind the counter, or the *girl* up front.  But they all <br/>
respected me just the same.  Actually, maybe moreso, because I didn&#39;t <br/>
ask them to change their vocabulary to meet my expectations but I <br/>
could converse with them about a variety of subjects.<br/>
And despite whet the sexist a-hole who owned the second hotel I worked <br/>
at thought I was not in danger of being raped because I could carry on <br/>
a conversation with a truck driver.<br/>

I think this is an excellent sentence (well, I guess it&#39;s really a<br/>
paragraph) It really can be hard to &quot;hear&quot; such a radically different way of<br/>
thinking. I don&#39;t think I was able to hear alot of unschooling ideas when I<br/>
first started learning about it and I was sure it was right for us!<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; And a lot of my feeling on this may come from the fact that I&#39;ve never <br/>
had some big unschooling epiphany.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It could still happen, though.<br/>
<br/>
The reason &quot;lessons&quot; is an indicator (when the word is used by someone <br/>
discussing unschooling) is that lessons are systematic, and given to one <br/>
person by another person.   When it is deeply understood that learning <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be systematic, and that learning happens inside the learner, <br/>
then the word &quot;lessons&quot; is like a meatball in the vegetarian stew.  It just <br/>
doesn&#39;t fit, and it messes up the purity of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby doesn&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;m taking karate lessons,&quot; he says &quot;I go to Shorin Ryu&quot; <br/>
or &quot;I&#39;m a green belt at Ed Erler&#39;s school&quot; or something.   He goes to White <br/>
Crane seminars whenever they&#39;re held, but he&#39;s not &quot;taking White Crane <br/>
lessons.&quot;  He&#39;s learning the forms, yes.  But he&#39;s learning when it&#39;s <br/>
available because he wants to go somewhere on a special day and learn it.   <br/>
It&#39;s not the same as lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are black belts at that school refer to their sessions as <br/>
&quot;workouts,&quot; not &quot;lessons.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s just in my nature I guess and <br/>
circumstances forced that out of me early into our homeschooling when <br/>
I WAS trying to be more of a structured homeschooler.  Kind of like <br/>
someone who never really smoked (maybe tried it in high school and <br/>
didn&#39;t like it) is usually much less vehement on the subject than <br/>
someone who quit after smoking for many years.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone who has never really fully unschooled wouldn&#39;t be in either category, <br/>
though.    Just not doing school does not equal confidently and efficiently <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For some unschooling comes gradually and for some it comer going to two or <br/>
three unschooling conferences doesn&#39;t make one an unschooler.  Only <br/>
unschooling can do that.<br/>

&lt;&lt; No I don&#39;t think anyone is scanning just for buzzwords to attack.  But <br/>
I do think that some people allow their own negative impression of <br/>
certain words to color their posts and maybe they need to just sit <br/>
back and examine why that is. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My negative impression of &quot;lessons&quot; comes from years of having them inflicted <br/>
on me, and inflicting them on others when I taught.  And our language has <br/>
some bad connotations to add.  &quot;Maybe now you&#39;ve learned your lesson,&quot; and <br/>
&quot;Let THAT be a lesson to you!&quot; are not things said with tender love.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You know, when you get right down to <br/>
it, last year, I was told to look at my posts in a certain light and I <br/>
did and it made me change the way I talked about something because I <br/>
realized I wasn&#39;t being clear enough about part of it.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just being clear in what is communicated to others.  That&#39;s very <br/>
important.  But changing terminology will make it clear to the person who is <br/>
writing, talking, thinking.  A conscious change from &quot;teaching&quot; to &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
will create a shift which will make a profound difference.<br/>
<br/>
If two people start at the same point and take trajectories just five degrees <br/>
apart, after a mile they&#39;ll be quite a long way from one another.  So if <br/>
something seems too insignificant to consider, it might just be a few degrees <br/>
from what the person is already thinking or doing, but a year or two they&#39;ll <br/>
be FAR from where they would have been without that slight change of <br/>
trajectory.<br/>

<br/>
Same here.<br/>
During the course of this latest round of debates, I opened up my <br/>
dictionary...just to see what the &quot;official&quot; definition was. <br/>
It&#39;s a Tormont Webster version and here&#39;s a couple of the definitions:<br/>
Lesson: 1. something to be learned (this to me does not imply the method in <br/>
which most unschoolers self teach) 2.a A period of instruction: a class: a <br/>
tennis lesson (occasionally useful when a child actually WANTS it)<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but then we get to number 4. A reprimand or punishment.<br/>
hmmm......too many times I&#39;ve heard the &quot;that should teach him a lesson&quot;.....<br/>
<br/>
I really  think that many of us may use terminology different...we may indeed <br/>
have experiences that &quot;color&quot; our use or acceptance of words.<br/>
<br/>
This still does not explain nor does it condone the behavior of those that <br/>
consistently, and persistently deride the posts/posters that point away from <br/>
lesson oriented thinking and towards a life of exploring freely, the things <br/>
that interest us.<br/>
There are experienced unschoolers here saying &quot;get outside the box, look how <br/>
many ways there are to learn things&quot;<br/>
without subject boxes, without lessons, without artificial time constraints.<br/>
It&#39;s quite beautiful.<br/>
Until someone comes along and says mean things about the information given.<br/>
I have read and re-read many of these posts and this is the pattern I&#39;ve <br/>
seen...<br/>
A person claiming to not understand unschooling, or who says they are not <br/>
unschoolers comes along asking for information.<br/>
It&#39;s given...along with some great advice.<br/>
The person either loves the advice or gets a bit ruffled at it.<br/>
If they get ruffled, we suddenly have a couple of posters angrily deriding <br/>
and chastising the advice given by experienced unschoolers instead of letting <br/>
the original poster answer for themselves.<br/>
Often, when I got my feathers ruffled in coming to my unschooling epiphany, <br/>
that was what provoked the most thought...and eventually change.<br/>
But it was only by being ruffled, then being answered back several times that <br/>
I finally understood what the person was really saying.<br/>
It&#39;s ok for new unschoolers to get ruffled a bit...that&#39;s so normal.<br/>
It is not ok in my book, for other unschoolers to come along and <br/>
deride/chastise the unschooling advice.<br/>
Disagreement is normal. <br/>
But to totally discount what numerous, experienced and happy unschoolers are <br/>
saying is so destructive.<br/>
We will continue to point to unschooling. We will continue to point away from <br/>
subject boxes and lessons and school and disrespect to children.<br/>
I believe these are the foundations of the convictions that have been laid in <br/>
many of our hearts, through trial and questioning and real life experiences.<br/>
The best thing for the list (only an opinion again) is for certain posters to <br/>
accept that this will continue, and disagree though they may, please respect <br/>
the right of the other unschoolers here to continue to point away from those <br/>
things.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The &quot;trading lessons&#39; thread is an example.  And this thread did<br/>
&gt; feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; to me like people jumped on a hot button word.  When I say my girls<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to find lessons in something, it just means they want to learn<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  It does not mean that I am going to stick them in a class and<br/>
&gt; &gt; make them do everything the instructor says and stick it out even<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; it isn&#39;t what they though it would be.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No I don&#39;t get upset if someone says &quot;so, what exactly do you mean<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; lessons?&quot;  I do get upset when someone says, &quot;We don&#39;t believe in<br/>
&gt; &gt; lessons here.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This thread didn&#39;t start because of something *you* said.<br/>
&gt; And no one ever said, &quot;we don&#39;t believe in lessons here&quot;.<br/>
&gt; If anyone is jumping on things, it is you.<br/>
&gt; Your example says, &quot;....my girls wanted to find lessons...&quot;<br/>
&gt; That is not comparible to what the OP(and ensuing posts) was<br/>
&gt; discussing.<br/>
&gt; Your putting a slant on it that never existed.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re trying to discuss unschooling here.  It seems counterproductive<br/>
&gt; to divert  conversations in this way.<br/>

we all in a way? We seek the type of advice that works (comfortably) for us<br/>
(even if it&#39;s hard and uncomfortable sometimes!) and avoid the stuff that<br/>
doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was going to say I think we should. But I realized I should express it as<br/>
I think *I* should because that&#39;s what feels right to me. (I think too many<br/>
conflicts have erupted here over how &quot;we&quot; should give advice. I think &quot;we&quot;<br/>
should each individually give advice in the way we as individuals feel most<br/>
comfortable giving it.)<br/>
<br/>
I know how far I had to come to get to unschooling. I trust that no matter<br/>
how far someone is from unschooling when they arrive here, that if they<br/>
stick around long enough and if something about unschooling sounds appealing<br/>
(but we don&#39;t need to *make* it appealing just allow unschooling to be it&#39;s<br/>
natural self :-) then they can get unschooling if they want to.<br/>
<br/>

doing in terms the neighbors want to hear that leaves the neighbors with<br/>
whatever impression the neighbors want to have.<br/>
<br/>
Avoiding confrontation is a way of life for some people. But avoiding<br/>
confrontation doesn&#39;t have to mean avoiding doing controversial things. It<br/>
just means avoiding giving the *impression* of doing controversial things.<br/>
It can be challenging fun, actually :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Honestly, if people are too sensitive to discuss<br/>
&gt; what they want to do, they&#39;re not strong enough to do it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, as one of those sensitive types I&#39;d disagree :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve rarely brought anything that I want to do to a list. The times I&#39;ve<br/>
done so haven&#39;t given me the &quot;right&quot; answers. And I&#39;ve felt attacked and<br/>
humiliated and wrong ;-) That&#39;s because I can&#39;t objectively examine myself.<br/>
In order to learn I need to answer someone else&#39;s questions from whatever<br/>
point of view I&#39;m trying to understand. *Then* I can understand and apply it<br/>
to my life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a lesson in that for other sensitive people or not!<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not a mater of sensitivity, it&#39;s more a matter of someone&#39;s ability<br/>
to handle questioning themselves. I&#39;ve managed to work around my inability<br/>
to do it directly.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, as one of those sensitive types I&#39;d disagree :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve rarely brought anything that I want to do to a list. The times I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; done so haven&#39;t given me the &quot;right&quot; answers. And I&#39;ve felt attacked and<br/>
&gt; humiliated and wrong ;-) That&#39;s because I can&#39;t objectively examine<br/>
 </span></blockquote>myself.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In order to learn I need to answer someone else&#39;s questions from whatever<br/>
&gt; point of view I&#39;m trying to understand. *Then* I can understand and apply<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to my life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are again describing me SO WELL! This is exactly how I feel, too. And<br/>
because I understand these feelings, I am VERY careful to not attack,<br/>
humiliate or shame anyone. Of course, that&#39;s easy to do when I don&#39;t post<br/>
that much. &lt;g&gt; But I do cringe when I see other newcomers get attacked - in<br/>
a sense. I know how they must be feeling. IMO, if time is taken to carefully<br/>
choose words about advice given, nobody needs to feel hurt or humiliated, in<br/>
most cases. I know sometimes that&#39;s hard to do when an obvious unschooling<br/>
no-no is apparent, but I&#39;ve seen people respond in kind but firm ways that<br/>
don&#39;t harm. For instance, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen Joyce attack or<br/>
humiliate anyone. (And probably not a coincidence that she is moderator<br/>
here! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also pondering the thought posted about being sensitive to discussing<br/>
unschooling and not strong enough to do it. Does that mean that one has to<br/>
be a good debater to be a good unschooler? Aaack!! I hope not. I&#39;m not<br/>
really a good debater. I *do* have strong opinions about many things,<br/>
unschooling being one of them, and I can defend my opinions *to a point*,<br/>
but when the discussion gets to the point when if feels like I&#39;m losing<br/>
ground and we&#39;re going in circles, I would rather give up than go on<br/>
debating. I don&#39;t really enjoy heated discussions. They make me feel<br/>
uncomfortable. And I think this has to do with ones personality. BUT, I<br/>
still think I can unschool my kids, regardless of my debating skills. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just thinking out loud here. Like someone else mentioned, I&#39;m almost<br/>
afraid to recommend this list as an unschooling resource, especially to<br/>
sensitive-type people. I have done just that, today, and I&#39;m not sure if she<br/>
will join but if she does, I hope that she won&#39;t regret it. Because I know<br/>
she is still somewhat shakey on her unschooling legs but is needing support<br/>
and assurance about older unschoolers and if they can make it as competent<br/>
and happy adults.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just giving another sensitive newcomer&#39;s point-of-view, although I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t consider myself a newbie right now, I still remember what it feels<br/>
like to be one, and I hope I never forget.<br/>

Some people may be so wired to read the &quot;kind&quot; posts and interpret it to<br/>
mean whatever they&#39;re doing is okay. And what they really need is a wake up<br/>
call.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s great to have many different points of views and styles of<br/>

don&#39;t find useful but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to learn that lesson ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988003260">Unschooling shouldn&#39;t be viewed as a one-size-fits-all in any of its many<br/>
aspects and that would include giving and receiving advise.  After all,<br/>
wasn&#39;t one of the reasons for not sending our children to ps is that they<br/>
are pigeon-holed and not treated as individuals by the system?  Seems<br/>
logical that the same would apply to the other members of the unschooling<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks leap right into unschooling, some take baby steps.  I guess I<br/>
don&#39;t understand why the same folks who understand that children who have<br/>
been to ps will need to deschool in various degrees can&#39;t/don&#39;t/won&#39;t<br/>
understand that adults coming to the list will also have to<br/>
deschool/relax/let go at their own pace.<br/>
<br/>
And just as everyone has their own style of posting, why not accept that<br/>
others are going to have their own style or method of<br/>
receiving/understanding the advise being given to them.<br/>

&gt; I think if they did they wouldn&#39;t run screaming out of here ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or if they do know it I suspect they avoid the kinds of advice that make<br/>
&gt; them uncomfortable and seek the kinds that make them comfortable. But<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; we all in a way? We seek the type of advice that works (comfortably) for<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; (even if it&#39;s hard and uncomfortable sometimes!) and avoid the stuff that<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think we should baby new unschoolers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was going to say I think we should. But I realized I should express it<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; I think *I* should because that&#39;s what feels right to me. (I think too<br/>
many<br/>
&gt; conflicts have erupted here over how &quot;we&quot; should give advice. I think &quot;we&quot;<br/>
&gt; should each individually give advice in the way we as individuals feel<br/>
most<br/>
&gt; comfortable giving it.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know how far I had to come to get to unschooling. I trust that no matter<br/>
&gt; how far someone is from unschooling when they arrive here, that if they<br/>
&gt; stick around long enough and if something about unschooling sounds<br/>
appealing<br/>
&gt; (but we don&#39;t need to *make* it appealing just allow unschooling to be<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; natural self :-) then they can get unschooling if they want to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If they can&#39;t take a<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion about unschooling, how will they take the pressure from<br/>
neighbors<br/>
&gt; &gt; and other homeschoolers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By avoiding those people. By learning to accurately express what they are<br/>
&gt; doing in terms the neighbors want to hear that leaves the neighbors with<br/>
&gt; whatever impression the neighbors want to have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Avoiding confrontation is a way of life for some people. But avoiding<br/>
&gt; confrontation doesn&#39;t have to mean avoiding doing controversial things. It<br/>
&gt; just means avoiding giving the *impression* of doing controversial things.<br/>
&gt; It can be challenging fun, actually :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Honestly, if people are too sensitive to discuss<br/>
&gt; &gt; what they want to do, they&#39;re not strong enough to do it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, as one of those sensitive types I&#39;d disagree :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve rarely brought anything that I want to do to a list. The times I&#39;ve<br/>

myself.<br/>
&gt; In order to learn I need to answer someone else&#39;s questions from whatever<br/>
&gt; point of view I&#39;m trying to understand. *Then* I can understand and apply<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; to my life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a lesson in that for other sensitive people or<br/>
not!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So it&#39;s not a mater of sensitivity, it&#39;s more a matter of someone&#39;s<br/>
ability<br/>
&gt; to handle questioning themselves. I&#39;ve managed to work around my inability<br/>
&gt; to do it directly.<br/>

direct and honest statements which jarred us out of our usual thinking <br/>
patterns and allowed us to really shift paradigms. The direct and blunt posts <br/>
that might feel too harsh to some sensitive people are like raindrops in the <br/>
parched desert to others of us. I am not particularly sensitive (anymore - I <br/>
grew out of it &lt;g&gt;) and I don&#39;t mistake unschooling advice for personal <br/>
attacks on me, my family, my homeschooling decisions, or my lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
No stranger on an email list really MATTERS enough to me that I would get <br/>
&quot;hurt&quot; by anything they say. I just take what they say as input - as <br/>
something to consider. I appreciate ideas that shake me up a little - that <br/>
are strong and clear and don&#39;t pussyfoot around the point. <br/>
<br/>
So - people are different. Some people want to make everyone behave in a way <br/>
that would work best for themselves. <br/>
<br/>
But as unschooling parents, one of the first things we have to do is give up <br/>
the idea that our own children ought to learn the same way we learn best. <br/>
<br/>
We can give up that expectation of each other, too. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I think that&#39;s obvious! Not only do we have the upset reactions from<br/>
new people but we have lots of people jumping on others for upsetting them.<br/>
Anyone who can&#39;t pick up obvious clues like that is probably dead and not<br/>
offering advice here anyway. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
That different people need to receive different advice is obvious and no one<br/>
is disputing that. The problem is how to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
Do we offer only advice that is guaranteed nonthreatening and then slowly<br/>
offer more and more difficult stuff up to someone&#39;s tolerance level? And how<br/>
would we &quot;train&quot; everyone who wants to give advice in how to do that? A<br/>
dozen different readers can interpret the same thing in a dozen different<br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
Do we somehow read someoene&#39;s mind and figure out they aren&#39;t quite ready<br/>
for the hard questions yet and just give them the advice they want to hear?<br/>
<br/>
(And what if their comfort point is being assured that what they are doing<br/>
is fine when it isn&#39;t unschooling? It may be fine in the great scheme of<br/>
things but why would someone *specifically* need to seek out unschooler --<br/>
not fellow homeschoolers but *unschoolers* -- to reassure them what they are<br/>
doing is fine?)<br/>
<br/>
Or, like a library, do we offer them what they are asking for and let *them*<br/>
pick and choose what they find useful and discard what they don&#39;t? And what<br/>
of those who are reading who need a different style of advice?<br/>
<br/>
We have all heard loud and clear that some people feel attacked by certain<br/>
styles of advice. I think two things are being missed:<br/>
<br/>
The ones who interpret the hard advice as attack are not *just* being<br/>
offered hard advice. They *are* being offered a variety but they&#39;re taking<br/>
exception to the fact that some of it is not to their liking.<br/>
<br/>
The people who have spoken up and said they *needed* the harder type of<br/>
advice for them to get unschooling. They don&#39;t get hurt and angry because<br/>
some of the advice is soft. (Nor should they!) They just take what&#39;s useful<br/>
to them and leave what isn&#39;t. And if the advice gets limited to soft they&#39;ll<br/>
just have a vague sense that this list isn&#39;t meeting their needs and leave<br/>
without a big grandstanding fuss. The effect of losing people will be<br/>
*exactly* the same. The difference is we won&#39;t have to be upset by the fact<br/>
that we did something to make them leave because we won&#39;t even be aware of<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s also helpful to keep in mind that this advice that upsets<br/>
people *isn&#39;t* intended to hurt them. It *isn&#39;t* hate literature we&#39;re<br/>
offering people in our library. It&#39;s perfectly fine literature that some<br/>
people love and some people find objectionable. *And* we&#39;re offering them a<br/>
variety to choose from. Some people are just getting upset that the stuff<br/>
they deem objectionable is being offered at all.<br/>
<br/>
So, what to do?<br/>
<br/>
Rather than censor or control advice or advice givers, I think helping new<br/>
people be better informed is a better -- a more democratic and unschooling<br/>
;-) -- answer.<br/>
<br/>
But how to deliver the information? In an introductory letter? If people<br/>
read them. :-/ (But if they don&#39;t, it isn&#39;t the lists fault!) A monthly<br/>
reminder on the list is probably annoying and impersonal.<br/>
<br/>
I like what Pam said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some of the advice you get here might challenge you, shock you, disturb<br/>
you, or seem harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful<br/>
and what feels uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed<br/>
to hear. If you don&#39;t like the way someone says something, ignore it. If you<br/>
disagree with the content of what they say, offer your own alternative<br/>
ideas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Just thinking out loud there.)<br/>
<br/>

I have a couple thoughts here:<br/>
<br/>
One is that, yes you have every right to continue posting in the same <br/>
manner that you have.  BUT, I personally know several people who left <br/>
this list specifically because of that type of posting, so for <br/>
everyone you help, you may be loosing one too.  Just a thought to <br/>
think about.<br/>
<br/>
My second thought is that you seem to be saying that any homeschooler <br/>
or parent for that matter who doesn&#39;t take to unschooling must not <br/>
respect their children properly.  So is that really what you think?<br/>

&gt; I believe these are the foundations of the convictions that have <br/>
been laid in <br/>

 I was talking about a type of posting and the effects it can have. <br/>
And just asking that it be considered. <br/>
And if you are going to question my answer to Ren in this manner, you <br/>
probably should be questioning Ren&#39;s post too.<br/>

<br/>
*Apparently* since I keep &quot;reminding&quot; certain people over and over there is<br/>
some extreme confusion over how we can create a place to discuss<br/>
unschooling. I will continue to post *examples* of what being &quot;uncivil&quot;<br/>
means until it stops.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to do this on list because one, I *assumed* people were making<br/>
these comments by mistake and were honestly *trying* to be more civil so a<br/>
reminder off list was enough and, two, because the focus will shift from<br/>
improving *your* (general you) behavior to whether other people are<br/>
improving their behavior and whether it&#39;s being singled out fairly.<br/>
<br/>
Pay attention to *your* behavior, *your* posting style. *Not* other<br/>
people&#39;s. (That goes for everyone.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because everyone is doing their best and all the complaining ABOUT how other <br/>
people post is what fills the list with negativity. Just let people be who <br/>
they are - we aren&#39;t their mothers, to teach them how to behave the way we <br/>
think is right. If we don&#39;t like how someone posts, if WE think it is <br/>
offensive or looks like an attack to some people, then we only compound the <br/>
negativity by following it up with more attacks attacking them for attacking <br/>
someone else, and so on. If we don&#39;t learn to let things go by without <br/>
comment - the list will eventually collapse under the weight of the negative <br/>
posting.<br/>
<br/>
We are unschoolers - we LET our kids be who they are. This very often means <br/>
letting them pursue something in their own way, even though it isn&#39;t the way <br/>
we would do it and even if we think it is counterproductive. Lets give the <br/>
same respect to other unschooling parents who are here and offering advice in <br/>
THEIR own way. Every question gets a variety of answers - lets give some <br/>
respect to the questioners, too, they are adults and can sort through the <br/>
answers to take what is useful to them and ignore those that upset them. They <br/>
don&#39;t need a bunch of us jumping in front of them, to protect them from <br/>
anything that might offend them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89940105">Yes people have been disputing that people &quot;need&quot; advise in different ways.<br/>
It has been flat out stated that of they can&#39;t take the &quot;slap up along side<br/>
the head&quot; advise that they are too weak to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first rules of public speaking is to deliver your message in a<br/>
manner that fits your audience.  For example, if you were giving an<br/>
unschooling talk to a Christian fundamentalist group, you wouldn&#39;t appear in<br/>
hot pants, a tube top and inject four letter words every other sentence.<br/>
However, if you were addressing a group of Hell&#39;s Angels, you might.<br/>
<br/>
The same goes with any debate group.  You change tone to effectively deliver<br/>
your message.<br/>
<br/>
What everyone seems to forget or doesn&#39;t understand is that the &quot;tone&quot; you<br/>
use doesn&#39; deminish the message.  The most effective tone is the one that<br/>
gets the message across to the particular segment of the population you are<br/>
addressing at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
As to a message being &quot;non-threatening,&quot; you can shake up the foundation of<br/>
someone&#39;s thinking without appearing threatening or appearing to attack<br/>

&gt; &gt; And just as everyone has their own style of posting, why not accept that<br/>
&gt; &gt; others are going to have their own style or method of<br/>
&gt; &gt; receiving/understanding the advise being given to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well I think that&#39;s obvious! Not only do we have the upset reactions from<br/>
&gt; new people but we have lots of people jumping on others for upsetting<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; Anyone who can&#39;t pick up obvious clues like that is probably dead and not<br/>
&gt; offering advice here anyway. ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That different people need to receive different advice is obvious and no<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; is disputing that. The problem is how to deal with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do we offer only advice that is guaranteed nonthreatening and then slowly<br/>
&gt; offer more and more difficult stuff up to someone&#39;s tolerance level? And<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; would we &quot;train&quot; everyone who wants to give advice in how to do that? A<br/>
&gt; dozen different readers can interpret the same thing in a dozen different<br/>
&gt; ways.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do we somehow read someoene&#39;s mind and figure out they aren&#39;t quite ready<br/>
&gt; for the hard questions yet and just give them the advice they want to<br/>
hear?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (And what if their comfort point is being assured that what they are doing<br/>
&gt; is fine when it isn&#39;t unschooling? It may be fine in the great scheme of<br/>
&gt; things but why would someone *specifically* need to seek out unschooler --<br/>
&gt; not fellow homeschoolers but *unschoolers* -- to reassure them what they<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; doing is fine?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or, like a library, do we offer them what they are asking for and let<br/>
*them*<br/>
&gt; pick and choose what they find useful and discard what they don&#39;t? And<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; of those who are reading who need a different style of advice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have all heard loud and clear that some people feel attacked by certain<br/>
&gt; styles of advice. I think two things are being missed:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The ones who interpret the hard advice as attack are not *just* being<br/>
&gt; offered hard advice. They *are* being offered a variety but they&#39;re taking<br/>
&gt; exception to the fact that some of it is not to their liking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The people who have spoken up and said they *needed* the harder type of<br/>
&gt; advice for them to get unschooling. They don&#39;t get hurt and angry because<br/>
&gt; some of the advice is soft. (Nor should they!) They just take what&#39;s<br/>
useful<br/>
&gt; to them and leave what isn&#39;t. And if the advice gets limited to soft<br/>
they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; just have a vague sense that this list isn&#39;t meeting their needs and leave<br/>
&gt; without a big grandstanding fuss. The effect of losing people will be<br/>
&gt; *exactly* the same. The difference is we won&#39;t have to be upset by the<br/>
fact<br/>
&gt; that we did something to make them leave because we won&#39;t even be aware of<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s also helpful to keep in mind that this advice that upsets<br/>
&gt; people *isn&#39;t* intended to hurt them. It *isn&#39;t* hate literature we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; offering people in our library. It&#39;s perfectly fine literature that some<br/>
&gt; people love and some people find objectionable. *And* we&#39;re offering them<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; variety to choose from. Some people are just getting upset that the stuff<br/>
&gt; they deem objectionable is being offered at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, what to do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rather than censor or control advice or advice givers, I think helping new<br/>
&gt; people be better informed is a better -- a more democratic and unschooling<br/>
&gt; ;-) -- answer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But how to deliver the information? In an introductory letter? If people<br/>
&gt; read them. :-/ (But if they don&#39;t, it isn&#39;t the lists fault!) A monthly<br/>
&gt; reminder on the list is probably annoying and impersonal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like what Pam said:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Some of the advice you get here might challenge you, shock you, disturb<br/>
&gt; you, or seem harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful<br/>
&gt; and what feels uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed<br/>
&gt; to hear. If you don&#39;t like the way someone says something, ignore it. If<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; disagree with the content of what they say, offer your own alternative<br/>
&gt; ideas.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Just thinking out loud there.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any sensitive types who are afraid to post because you don&#39;t want attacked<br/>
&gt; want to comment? (You can email me privately of course!)<br/>

so confused by all the posts that criticize the &quot;attacker&quot; and defending <br/>
the &quot;attacker&quot; that they get all that stuff mixed up in their minds.  Often <br/>
they think someone said something about them that was actually said about <br/>
someone else.<br/>
<br/>
If you think someone gave a bad answer to someone&#39;s question, just ignore <br/>
their answer and answer the question the way you think it should be <br/>
answered.  Then you&#39;ve given the person a choice of answers instead of a <br/>
big argument that doesn&#39;t even really answer their question.<br/>

But that begs the definition of unschooling and some of us consider<br/>

off-topic and not about unschooling.<br/>
