<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152150733">I went to this link and it is the same url as the one above it.  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t find anything about a computer experiment in 3rd world countries...<br/>
I would really be interested in reading about  if you could find the <br/>
right url for me  :-)<br/>

&gt; And I posted this before, and it&#39;s been passed around quite a bit, but <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; post it again for anyone interested. It&#39;s the experiment with third world<br/>
&gt; countries and computers left in the open for people in the slum areas <br/>
&gt; to use.<br/>
&gt; It just proves that people teach themselves!! A great article for <br/>
&gt; anyone that<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t yet read it.<br/>
