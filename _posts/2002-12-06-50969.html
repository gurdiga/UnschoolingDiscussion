<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119028763">I received a question the other day about early childhood learning, <br/>
inquiring whether Home Education Magazine had published any articles <br/>
on the topic of very early childhood learning. I replied that I <br/>
couldn&#39;t recall any, to which the writer, who has so far only <br/>
identified himself as Marsh, replied: &quot;I am talking about the whole <br/>
issue of nature vs. nurture as it relates to tots and toddlers. In <br/>
other words, will early environmental stimulation increase a young <br/>
child&#39;s intelligence, and if so, by how much? I am curious if this <br/>
whole issue was ever presented to homeschoolers. I can tell you that <br/>
most educators have no use whatsoever for it and will say most <br/>
anything to dissuade parents from it. Among their other objections, <br/>
they equate early parental instruction as early home schooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have personally been involved with this for 21 years, ever since I <br/>
started to teach my two year old how to read. And no, I am not <br/>
talking about a high pressure hot housing kind of scene.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you would look at my web page on <br/>
this---www.educationbeginsatbirth.com---you will learn more about it <br/>
and me at the bio section.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I did take a look at Marsh&#39;s site, and it&#39;s interesting reading. I&#39;ve <br/>
always believed there was a direct correlation between early social <br/>
and mental stimulation (not necessarily &#39;schoolwork&#39; per se, but <br/>
loving and supportive interaction between parent and child) and later <br/>
learning abilities, and I&#39;ve often wondered why there&#39;s still a <br/>
strong perception that &quot;learning&quot; is something that should start <br/>
happening around the age when children would normally go off to <br/>
school. I know most homeschoolers know better, that children are <br/>
learning from birth (and perhaps even before) but still, most of the <br/>
articles we receive are directed toward a sort of &quot;parallel school <br/>
age&quot; group.<br/>
<br/>
Marsh&#39;s no-nonsense approach to the topic of very early childhood <br/>
learning makes me wonder why the whole subject hasn&#39;t received more <br/>
discussion. Or perhaps it has and I missed it...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I think you missed it. I guess you haven&#39;t been to a baby store and<br/>
seen all the &quot;infant stim&quot; merchandise being sold. The Mozart for Babies CDs<br/>
and DVDs. (Type &quot;infant stim&quot; and &quot;infant stimulation&quot; into Google. I see<br/>
that you can even download graphics for the computer to stimulate your<br/>
infant.)<br/>
<br/>
I think the idea that the first 3 years are important is a good one. Not<br/>
necessarily because there&#39;s something specifically vital to a child&#39;s mental<br/>
growth happening (maybe there is, maybe there isn&#39;t) but because, as you<br/>
point out, learning doesn&#39;t start at school age.<br/>
<br/>
But I think parents are taking the early infant learning with a grain of<br/>
salt because babies aren&#39;t embracing the idea that their early learning can<br/>
be bought at a store ;-) And this society is very ... I&#39;m not sure of the<br/>
word, but perhaps process? oriented. People don&#39;t find an activity<br/>
satisfying unless there&#39;s a clearly defined process with a clearly defined<br/>
result at the end. What they want is &quot;If you do this for this amount of time<br/>
you will get this result.&quot; (And that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s saying. Phonics for<br/>
30 minutes a day will get you genius level intelligence.) They want magic<br/>
spells. They don&#39;t want to spend time figuring out what their particular<br/>
baby needs. They don&#39;t trust that what the baby enjoys is what is best for<br/>
the baby. They want experts to tell them the right process so they can just<br/>
do it. They don&#39;t want to be told to sing and read and play and cuddle and<br/>
laugh. They want to know what to do and how long to do it and what results<br/>
they can expect. The goal of whole healthy happy child isn&#39;t enough. That&#39;s<br/>
something that will just happen from life. It&#39;s academics that concern them.<br/>
They want something measurable and specific. They want numbers. They want<br/>
something translatable into security for their child.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I&#39;m drawn to the idea of processes to increase IQ, I think it<br/>
pushes what babies really need into the background. What they need is<br/>
affection and attention and connections with the people in their lives.<br/>
Anything else is extra. But the emphasis on early *learning* and IQ moves<br/>
the spot light onto academics. And that&#39;s buffing the car to a high gloss<br/>
shine and neglecting the engine.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m kinda in favor for avoiding things that will produce &quot;genius level <br/>
intelligence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The factoids and speed of performance stuff that get people high IQ scores <br/>
can be picked up later.  The compassion and intuition and the encouragement <br/>
of open inquiry can be extinguished for life early on.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They don&#39;t want to be told to sing and read and play and cuddle and<br/>

<br/>
The current National Geographic, in their cover article on skin, says this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-For humans insufficient touching in early years can have lifelong results. <br/>
 &quot;In touching cultures, adult aggression is low, whereas in cultures wehre <br/>
touch is limited, adult aggression is high,&quot; writes Tiffany Field, director <br/>
of the Touch Research Institutes at the University of Miami School of <br/>
Medicine.  Studies of a variety of cultures show a correspondence between <br/>
high rates of physical affection in childhood and low rates of adult physical <br/>
violence.-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-387360064">My two cents...<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time agreeing with this kind of statements. Granted, the first 3 years in a child&#39;s life are vital for their development and stimulation is good for them. But I don&#39;t think they necessarily need this &quot;intellectual&quot; kind of stimulation. I believe children develop fantasy and imagination first, which help them integrate their environment and later the world at large, so they should have plenty of *material* to promote and enhace that, but most importantly at that young age they need to be NURTURED and loved and stimulated emotionally. They need to bond with their parents and close family and feel safe in the world.<br/>
Later come more imagination and creativity, as they develop more abilities to do and create things, along with further development of physical abilities. It is not until later on (6-7 years) that the intellectual abilities develop and children are *ready* to learn to read, write and comprehend concepts in a less intuitive way, and in a more intellectual manner.<br/>
<br/>
To me, this *early education* stuff, with all their products and gimmicks, is nothing but an unnecessary *rushing* into things that would come naturally at a later stage. It just seems that this culture has a really hard time accepting the fact that children are not &quot;little adults&quot; that are already &quot;pre-programmed for society.&quot; Sometimes I wonder, when I look at your average parent, why they act toward their kids as if they SHOULD already know what the parent does not have the patience to teach or at least let them learn, and they get so frustrated with the child&#39;s trial-and-error kind of response...<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s society&#39;s rush, rush rush... You&#39;re born, you should be reading right away and then to school and then become part of the working force. What about JUST being a baby, then a toddler, then a kid, and live, feel, think and dream JUST like a kid?<br/>
Well, someone out there must be making big bucks with all this gimmick. And if not, some parents out there must be inflating their egos with their young kids&#39; accomplishments...<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that learning to read is like learning to talk... it comes naturally, but at its own time, when the child is ready. What&#39;s the rush anyway? Why try to train them like animals? The longer a child maintains his or her innocence and &quot;magical&quot; approach at life, the more s/he will be able to preserve and maintain his or her sense of inner Self.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Excellent idea, Tia! From reading your writing over the years I&#39;d say <br/>
you have a lot to share with our readers! If anyone else is <br/>
interested in writing for HEM just send me a note and I&#39;ll return our <br/>
editorial guidelines, deadline, photo information, rates of payment, <br/>
etc. And FYI, I&#39;m not really the one who selects articles that run - <br/>
that job is handled by Carol Narigon, who also edits our wonderful <br/>
HEM email newsletter. If you&#39;d like to submit something directly to <br/>
Carol, her address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HEM-Articles@...">HEM-Articles@...</a><br/>
<br/>
The lists are really pretty simple, since they&#39;re all housed at <br/>
YahooGroups: just enter this URL in your browser: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.groups.yahoo.com/community/">http://www.groups.yahoo.com/community/</a> and then just add the name of <br/>
the group you&#39;re interested in to complete the URL. For example:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.groups.yahoo.com/community/HEM-Networking">http://www.groups.yahoo.com/community/HEM-Networking</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.groups.yahoo.com/community/HEM-Writers">http://www.groups.yahoo.com/community/HEM-Writers</a><br/>
or<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.groups.yahoo.com/community/HEM-Resources">http://www.groups.yahoo.com/community/HEM-Resources</a><br/>
<br/>
We also offer these groups:<br/>
HEM-Unschooling, HEM-SupportGroups, HEM-Conferences, HEM-Movielovers, <br/>
and History of Homeschooling. That last one&#39;s been quiet for many <br/>
months now, but I&#39;ve been thinking about kickstarting it again after <br/>
the first of the year.<br/>
<br/>
You can subscribe to any of these groups without going to the website <br/>
by sending a blank email message to this address: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NAMEOFTHEGROUP-subcribe@yahoogroups.com">NAMEOFTHEGROUP-subcribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>

who they are...they are magical....so creative and full of <br/>
themselves...Yesterday, my husband had a ladder in the MBR to access the <br/>
ceiling fan and left it there for a few minutes.  My daughter (5.5 yo) and <br/>
son (2.5) started to climb up the first few steps and climb down.  At some <br/>
point, they decided to &quot;play a game&quot; where my son would climb up the two <br/>
steps and &quot;tell&quot; my daughter &quot;what to talk about&quot; (clouds and moon are two I <br/>
can remember).  He would climb down and then she would climb up and start <br/>
expounding on each topic so self assured and, like I said, full of herself.  <br/>
Can&#39;t explain it better than I am, but I &quot;get it&quot;  and am continuing to &quot;get <br/>
it,&quot; and I am grateful for that!  I am just so pleased to have found this <br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
Robin, who gave her dd a worksheet on the letter &quot;L&quot; in a moment of panic <br/>
only to have it returned rolled up and secured with a ribbon (like a <br/>
diploma)...she had actually agreed to do it because it had a picture of a <br/>
lady bug on it.  I eventually threw it away, but wish I had saved it as a <br/>
reminder when I get stuck in a panic again!  <br/>
