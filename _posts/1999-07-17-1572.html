<div id="ygrps-yiv-966341270">Ann,<br/>
I think you will want to listen to your grandmother on what she wants to do in regard to &#39;getting out of the house&#39;.  What Lisa found with her grandmother is typical (i.e., short outings,  a few hours,  to familiar places).<br/>
Grandparents may not want to be upfront about physical/medical limitations (they often don&#39;t want to worry or burden family).  Try to be respectful of her wishes.<br/>
I am speaking from a decade of experience in geriatric social work.<br/>
I imagine your children will benefit greatly from this trip!  Hope they get lots of &#39;stories&#39; and &#39;family history&#39;.<br/>
