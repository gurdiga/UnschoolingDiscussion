<br/>
Find out:<br/>
<br/>
Who was the only founding father and president to free his slaves<br/>
Who lived the longest<br/>
Who was the first VP (later became president) to preside over the Senate<br/>
with loaded pistols<br/>
Who was the last British-born president<br/>
Who served as president for only one day<br/>
Who campaigned in German<br/>
Which future president attended law school while serving as VP<br/>
Who was the first to ride in a submarine<br/>
Who was the first self-made millionaire<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One other piece of info to dig up:<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had seven presidents who were left-handed.  At one point three<br/>
consecutive presidents were leftys.  Who are those three consecutive<br/>
presidents?<br/>
<br/>
(Sorry for the lefty question.  Being one myself, I couldn&#39;t resist)<br/>
