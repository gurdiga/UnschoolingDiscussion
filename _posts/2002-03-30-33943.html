<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256945187"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Are these good?  Did you read them too?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve been listening to some on tape and they really are a hoot. I think you <br/>
have to listen to a couple to really get into them. They have continuing <br/>
characters and story line, a tongue in cheek style, an author (Lemony <br/>
Snicket) who&#39;s supposedly gone in hiding out of fear for the bad guys, and <br/>
some truly ingenious heroes (the Baudelaire children). Conor actually told <br/>
me that he likes them almost as much as Harry Potter. High praise indeed.<br/>

We are reading the 2nd book right now of the series. When I went into the book store I asked the women what books were like Harry Potter and those were the first ones she brought us to, they really are funny.<br/>
