<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904036059">Hi,<br/>
I am fairly new and posted a couple weeks ago about the in-laws.  I neglected to mention <br/>
that my dh doesn&#39;t feel the way I do about respecting children, waiting for their timetable, or <br/>
trusting that they will have successful academic experiences  through their interests.<br/>
He is just not open to reading John Holt, or any other material about it; I believe, because he <br/>
was raised with such an authoritarian approach.  He mentioned the other day to his parents <br/>
that our ds left 6th grade this year because the option was given to him that he COULD  leave <br/>
at any time.<br/>
From a personal experience, does anyone have similar experiences or suggestions they can <br/>
share that helped their family with unschooling?<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions.<br/>

topic... believe me.  Here are a few links:<br/>

And this one is just flat out encouraging for that really great picker upper<br/>

PS:  I forget who says this, but it goes very well with the title of your<br/>
post.  &quot;When you believe it, you&#39;ll see it.&quot;<br/>
