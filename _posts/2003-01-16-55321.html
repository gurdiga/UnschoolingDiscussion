<div id="ygrps-yiv-292819341">I am needing some help here sorting some things out, and hoping all you wise<br/>
ladies can help.  I would have said I need help with &quot;socialization&quot; issues<br/>
but I hate that word.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 13.  She is very outgoing socially, but does not seemed to be<br/>
well liked.  I have tried to give her some hints about things that she does<br/>
which might cause people not to like her, but overall I find this really<br/>
difficult.  I like her!  She loves people and doing things.  She is a very<br/>
crafty person.  She is great at thinking through things and coming up with<br/>
ways to do things that others might not see.  She loves to help people and<br/>
be involved in whatever someone is doing.  She can tend to be too bossy.<br/>
She doesn&#39;t do well sitting in a chair and listening to a teacher without<br/>
something else to do (and for this reason gets on the nerves of sunday<br/>
school teachers, though one has figured it out and allows her to doodle,<br/>
whereas the other hasn&#39;t figured it out and rebukes her for getting out of<br/>
her chair, talking, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I am mainly concerned today because yesterday our homeschooling group had<br/>
the final pick for parts in the play we will be doing at the<br/>
homeschoolconvention.  She had her heart set on a certain part and did not<br/>
get it.  She was extremely upset.  She told me that it wasn&#39;t fair because<br/>
the director had not even really given her a chance to try for the part<br/>
(like she had said she would).  The person who got the part is a sweet,<br/>
compliant child.  I am not complaining that she did not get the part (they<br/>
did give her a part, just not a major one), but I am trying to figure out<br/>
why this always seems to happen to her.  I do think that it has something to<br/>
do with the fact that they don&#39;t like her (which is why I am putting this<br/>
story in the message), but I don&#39;t know how to help her with this issue.  I<br/>
could be completely wrong.  But if I am wrong about this incident, I am not<br/>
wrong about the general feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>

<br/>
Adolescence (like menopause) is a time when a lot of stuff shows up for a woman and it&#39;s a transitional period that can be hard to deal with for most of us. Anyway, I just thought I&#39;d mention it not from an *expert* point of view, but out of compassion for a young woman. I am sure you&#39;ll get plenty of good advice from people with older kids here...  ;-)<br/>

I will try to do some more reading about homeopathy.  I suspect I live in an<br/>
area where they have never heard of it, so I don&#39;t think I could go to<br/>
anyone for help (probably can&#39;t afford it anyway).  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
What happened with the part in the play, is that they didn&#39;t try anyone out.<br/>
My daughter had done the part the first two practices (without any prior<br/>
knowledge of the musical, etc), and then the other child (a boy) was asked<br/>
to do the part for the next two.  The difference here is that the boy had<br/>
been in the production last year, with a different part, but he knew the how<br/>
the part was played.  The director has said she would have try-outs<br/>
yesterday and my daughter had practiced the part a lot, using different<br/>
voice intonations etc.  Then, without having them try out, they just walked<br/>
up and told her that the boy had the part, and she would have a different<br/>
part.  So she didn&#39;t even get a chance to show them how she could do with it<br/>
really.  But like I said, I really feel like how well she could do that part<br/>
didn&#39;t really matter.<br/>

I dont know if I really have any advice ( esp unschooling related)  but, I <br/>
can empathize with you We have had  similar experiences  in my family( I wont <br/>
go into them specifically for the sake of time and space).<br/>
<br/>
    My daughter is also 13, and gosh, it is such an emotional age.  <br/>
EVERYTHING is a big deal.  A lot of the emotional turmoil that Anna <br/>
experienced, I blamed on school ( and probably rightly so)  But I can see <br/>
that school is not all to blame.. Just like in your situation, I think its <br/>
just thier age in general, and &quot;life&quot; in general that is difficult for <br/>
changing minds and bodies to deal with.   Unfortunately, even unschooling <br/>
can&#39;t shelter our children from plain old politics in this world.  The only <br/>
alternative would be to avoid society at large, and I dont think that is a <br/>
good idea.   I  know she feels like lifes not fair, and that she didnt get a <br/>
chance to prove herself.   I hate that for her.  I suppose the only <br/>
consolation is that there is always &quot;next time&quot;  IF she isnt too afraid of <br/>
rejection again.   Did she get a different part in the play?  Perhaps you can <br/>
encourage her to just show her talent by doing that part as well as she <br/>
possibly can.    Blah, I know, thats little consolation too.. &quot;there are no <br/>
small parts&quot;  seems like a bunch of BS when you have a small part., But those <br/>
small parts can be bridges to bigger parts if they are played right and with <br/>
enthusiasm and effort.<br/>
<br/>
   I think mostly, with kids this age, its a matter of  just letting her get <br/>
her feelings out and listening to her woes.  Usually, after Anna has her <br/>
emotional bouts of frustration, depression, anxiety, etc.. she&#39;s fine and <br/>
back to &quot;normal&quot; soon.   I remember those roller coaster days when I was her <br/>
age.. Oh, bless my poor Momma.. lol..<br/>

<br/>
Yes, she did get a different part in the play, so we have had the discussion<br/>
about being the best she absolutely can at that part.  She says she will,<br/>
and says she will learn the other part too, just in case the boy gets sick<br/>
at the last minute, lol.  Today she is handling it well, but still<br/>
mentioning it isn&#39;t fair.  We talked about how she can show her maturity by<br/>
going in there at the next practice and doing her best and not letting it<br/>
bug her,etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I guess 13 for anyone can be emotional.  I know she cannot be protected<br/>
from the world, but this is just one isolated incident in a whole stream of<br/>
them.  Most of  the others could be explained away by the fact that we are<br/>
homeschoolers (only homeschoolers in a very small community which thinks<br/>
that their school is perfect and cannot see why I wouldn&#39;t send my children<br/>
there.  Even the girls her age who are in our church don&#39;t spend much time<br/>
with her and are purposely mean to her because she is different, i.e.<br/>
homeschooled.)  I think that it should at least be different when immersed<br/>
in a group of homeschoolers, and I think that is what has dissapointed me<br/>
about the whole thing.  So in my disspointment I am looking at what we can<br/>
do to change.  Maybe we can&#39;t do anything, but I gotta hope!<br/>

that the &#39;social stuff&quot; will be easier for Anna ( and my other kids too) <br/>
among homeschoolers than it was in public school.    Actually, my 11 yo son <br/>
is the one that has had the most trouble in social situatuions.. and I have <br/>
the same hope, that he does better with homeschoolers, in more relaxed and <br/>
&quot;fun&quot; situations than at public school.   And, I also know what you mean by <br/>
trying to find out what is &quot;wrong&quot;.. or the reason that your daughter is <br/>
having trouble fitting it.. I feel the same way about Ethan... I think.. what <br/>
can I do to help him feel more comfortable.. to help him relate to other <br/>
children better..  We are new to homeschooling and in the process of trying <br/>
to meet other hs families, joining clubs, signing up for activities, field <br/>
trips, whatever we can find to meet new folks.. Ethan is still very resistant <br/>
to getting involved, and I have not insisted nor &quot;pushed&quot; him to join in..  <br/>
Really, he would be happy to stay at home, all alone, playing video games.. <br/>
But, once I convince him to get out and join in with others, he does have a <br/>
good time and he does not regret it.  I just hope in time he becomes more <br/>
comfortable and seeks out these opportunities without me  having to convince <br/>
him to join in.   I think he is just so scarred and hurt by public school, he <br/>
is gun shy.. It will just take time ( again.. I HOPE!)<br/>

<br/>
I understand Ethan&#39;s position too.  I have a son like that.   He mostly<br/>
prefers not to go to social activities and prefers to spend most of his time<br/>
on video games too (and reading).  I have in the past pushed him to do<br/>
social things.  He usually is happy to have done them, but does not carry<br/>
that on to the next activity.  He just doesn&#39;t like new situations, and that<br/>
is the way it is, lol.  He, would have never tried out for the musical in<br/>
the first place, lol.  I offered, but he said no way!  But you know what, he<br/>
seems to do better in social situations than my daughter.  He tends to sit<br/>
back and observe mostly, but when he begins to take part  he is accepted.  I<br/>
don&#39;t really get it.<br/>
<br/>
I sure hope you do find some like minded families that will befriend your<br/>
children.  We have the added problem that we are unschooling, and there are<br/>
no other unschoolers in the immediate area that I know of.  But of course,<br/>
even if there are, they are probably not admitting it, lol.  So, I get<br/>
together with homeschoolers but don&#39;t really talk about schooling.  I used<br/>
to always be the one asking everyone what curriculum they used though, and<br/>
since I have tried most of them, I do understand what they are talking<br/>
about, lol.  With the laws in our state, I am sure if my friends new I was<br/>
unschooling they would be working to convince me that I shouldn&#39;t be.  They<br/>
are all very meticulously doing their curriculums and have always thought I<br/>
was off my rocker when I refused to give my children grades, etc.  They are<br/>
all really nice people though : - ) !<br/>

limited exposure to homeopathy, I know its not all about little pills..  I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-688778890">Just wondering if the whole no one likes me stuff is coming from your <br/>
daughter or are you actually seeing that this is the case?<br/>
<br/>
Reason I ask is because I always saw my oldest as intelligent and attractive <br/>
and nice as a young adolescent. Now at 17, she tells me she was a real geek <br/>
and a nerd and no one liked her. She&#39;s talking about the ages between 11-14. <br/>
I still have a hard time believing it was all that bad but she swears for <br/>
her it was awful. I mean I believe her when she says how bad it hurt, what I <br/>
don&#39;t believe is that she was really some freak. I think maybe she just <br/>
tried way too hard to be well liked and she was easy pickings for when the <br/>
&quot;popular girls&quot; neede someone to make fun of.<br/>
<br/>
I just talked until I was blue in the face about what was really important <br/>
and to wait a few years and see where all the cattiness and nastiness got <br/>
the girls. Tara was always the one to stick up for the underdogs and talk to <br/>
the kids everyone made fun of. Now of course she sees what I was talking <br/>
about. She&#39;s a very well liked, understanding and trustworthy friend. Her <br/>
friends at school run the whole gammut of groups that the kids put <br/>
themselves in.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if you really see something your daughter is doing to push people <br/>
away or it&#39;s just her age and the kids she&#39;s around. If it&#39;s the latter of <br/>
the two, it will all change shortly.<br/>

limited exposure to homeopathy, I know its not all about little pills..  I <br/>
think the practice encompasses MUCH MUCH more than that.. That would be like <br/>
saying the unschooling is not doing a curriculum.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Possibly so, but on an unschooling list at least saying unschooling is not <br/>
doing a curriculum is on topic.<br/>

I think it is both.  I see her do things (such as being bossy, always trying<br/>
to be right) and I see people&#39;s reaction to her.  Up until this year, she<br/>
was completely unaware of it.  Just last week, one girl from our church,<br/>
told her two things.  She said she didn&#39;t use to like her because she was<br/>
not &quot;popular&quot; and she didn&#39;t want to be seen with unpopular people.  (And<br/>
she said this was because of the homeschooling.)  She also said that they<br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;use&quot; to like her because she was annoying.  My daughter relayed this<br/>
information to me, but it didn&#39;t really seem to bother her.  She had been at<br/>
the other girl&#39;s house that day, and she was just glad to go and spend some<br/>
time with her. (This doesn&#39;t happen very often though, and there is a girl<br/>
in the same family who is my daughter&#39;s age that will talk to her there, but<br/>
if she sees her in public she ignores her mostly.<br/>
<br/>
She does have one good friend, who never treats her differently and they<br/>
enjoy each other.  The friend is two years older than she is, which limits<br/>
some of the things they do together, and she is in school, but when they can<br/>
get together they are happy.  So, she is not completely without friends.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for helping me figure this out,<br/>

I too struggle with a lot of the types of things you mentioned.   I tend to agree with someone on the list who said that things would probably improve with time.   I watched my oldest, a boy, struggle with feeling he was not accepted in his homeschool group as a teen.  He continued to participate anyway and one of the teens told him he was the kindest person in the whole group.   Sometimes it just takes one good friend.   When things are going well for our kids we hurt just as much as they do.  Girls seem to mature socially before boys, so it might not be long till your daughter is finding herself feeling better about her social interactions.  For my oldest, he really came into his own right after he turned 17 and began college.  The like mindedness of his fellow music majors gave him a social belongingness.  <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime I wonder if it would be possible for you and your daughter to start your own independant drama group.  It could be for just one play or more.  It could include both schoolers and non-schoolers.  Many years ago I got 6 children together, including my oldest, and they put on the play &quot;A Mad Tea Party.&quot;  I found the script and practiced with the kids twice a week for about a month. I had zero drama experience.  After each practice they swam in our pool and had snacks.  (I&#39;m sure the pool was a big draw, but those kids put on a darned good performance).  We taped it and the local newspaper took their picture.  If you could find a play that had several big parts then your daughter could shine with the rest of them.  Also, if you have a community drama group where she could act with adults, that might give her some positive feedback and a great opportunity.<br/>

  &quot;I would tend to think so too.  I know that I am hoping ( fingers crossed)<br/>
  that the &#39;social stuff&quot; will be easier for Anna ( and my other kids too)<br/>
  among homeschoolers than it was in public school.    Actually, my 11 yo son<br/>
  &gt; is the one that has had the most trouble in social situatuions.. and I<br/>
  have the same hope, that he does better with homeschoolers, in more relaxed<br/>
  and  &quot;fun&quot; situations than at public school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I understand Ethan&#39;s position too.  I have a son like that.   He mostly<br/>
  prefers not to go to social activities and prefers to spend most of his time<br/>
  on video games too (and reading).  I have in the past pushed him to do<br/>
  social things.  He usually is happy to have done them, but does not carry<br/>
  that on to the next activity.  He just doesn&#39;t like new situations, and that<br/>
  is the way it is, lol.  He, would have never tried out for the musical in<br/>
  the first place, lol.  I offered, but he said no way!  But you know what, he<br/>
  seems to do better in social situations than my daughter.  He tends to sit<br/>
  back and observe mostly, but when he begins to take part  he is accepted.  I<br/>
  don&#39;t really get it.<br/>
<br/>
  I sure hope you do find some like minded families that will befriend your<br/>
  children.  We have the added problem that we are unschooling, and there are<br/>
  no other unschoolers in the immediate area that I know of.  But of course,<br/>
  even if there are, they are probably not admitting it, lol.  So, I get<br/>
  together with homeschoolers but don&#39;t really talk about schooling.  I used<br/>
  to always be the one asking everyone what curriculum they used though, and<br/>
  since I have tried most of them, I do understand what they are talking<br/>
  about, lol.  With the laws in our state, I am sure if my friends new I was<br/>
  unschooling they would be working to convince me that I shouldn&#39;t be.  They<br/>
  are all very meticulously doing their curriculums and have always thought I<br/>
  was off my rocker when I refused to give my children grades, etc.  They are<br/>
  all really nice people though : - ) !<br/>

&gt; advice, as Joyce put it<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Before there is any speculation on whether I should have said what I may or<br/>
may not have said, I will share what I privately discussed with Yol.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that there are people on the list who appreciate the homeopathy<br/>
suggestions and some who feel this is an unschooling list and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
belong. I feel that the list can accomodate a variety of suggestions that<br/>
don&#39;t interfere with unschooling even if they aren&#39;t strictly &quot;unschooling&quot;.<br/>
Lots of people here hand out parent-to-parent advice on health matters and<br/>
parenting matters they&#39;ve found works for them.<br/>
<br/>
Yol is a practicing homeopath so that makes her advice *more* than<br/>
parent-to-parent. It&#39;s professional advice. I asked that she be aware of the<br/>
difference. She says there is no difference.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the things school and society robs us of as parents is a<br/>
feeling of competency: that we aren&#39;t competent to determine the needs of<br/>
our own children. We can&#39;t tell a healthy child from an unhealthy one. The<br/>
clues are so subtle that only professionals would be able to recognize them.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to support parents&#39; feelings of competence. When a<br/>
professional repeatedly suggests that ordinary problems should be seen by a<br/>
professional, I feel it undermines that feeling of competency.<br/>
<br/>
It was beginning to feel, to me, like people were being directed to a<br/>
homeopath for too many ordinary run-of-the-mill problems that parents<br/>
normally handle themselves. I felt it was heading towards being harmful to<br/>
some people trying to regain (or build in the first place!) their sense of<br/>
confidence in themselves as parents.<br/>
<br/>
A specific incident -- small in itself but more significant when compounded<br/>
by similar incidents -- was Yol&#39;s joke on the HEM-Unschooling list:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; What if someone said to a three year old boy who was holding his<br/>
&gt;&gt; penis inside his pants, &quot;Hey, ya looking for gold?&quot; THAT would be<br/>
&gt;&gt; funny, wouldn&#39;t it? Every male in the room would get a little gleam<br/>
&gt;&gt; in his eye. <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t say anything to the boy, because that would be humiliating<br/>
&gt; IMO, but I would definitely say to the parents to take him to see a<br/>
&gt; homeopath. But you know that&#39;s me and my clinical eye... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While a parent could get away with saying something like this as a joke and<br/>
having it mean nothing more than another parent, I felt it was irresponsible<br/>
of a claimed professional to make jokes like this about something that<br/>
wasn&#39;t presented as an obsessive problem but as something the parent wanted<br/>
directed to more private times.<br/>
<br/>
I did not ask her to stop giving out homeopathic advice. I asked her to be<br/>
more aware. She felt no one thought of her as a professional so her words<br/>
didn&#39;t mean any more than anyone elses&#39;. While that may be how some people<br/>
view her, I felt it was irresponsible not to see the power her words *could*<br/>
have on some people.<br/>
<br/>
Yol dismissed my suggestions and told me I&#39;d never see her offering<br/>
homeopathic advice again. That was her choice.<br/>
<br/>
And, apparently it&#39;s now her choice to change her mind when she feels it&#39;s<br/>
too important not to offer her advice. And since, to me, this *again* seems<br/>
like another perfectly ordinary problem, the extraordinary need to pass on<br/>
homeopathic advice despite her declaration not to, reinforces my feelings<br/>
that judgement and power isn&#39;t being used wisely.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Erin,<br/>
       Did I have twins and didn&#39;t remember? Our daughters sound very <br/>
similar.<br/>
<br/>
       I think many people have a preconceived notion of what a 13 y/o should <br/>
look and act like. When they encounter someone as outspoken, intelligent, and <br/>
mature as my daughter, they don&#39;t know how to deal with them. In their eyes <br/>
it must be the child&#39;s problem. My daughter has a handful of very close <br/>
friends, but many acquaintances. If she were in school, she would probably <br/>
not be part of the &quot;popular group.&quot; Does this bother her? No, she is quite <br/>
happy with who she is and doesn&#39;t want to fit everyone else&#39;s mold of a 13 <br/>
y/o. She&#39;d much rather have friends because they like who she is not because <br/>
she follows the herd. <br/>
<br/>
       The only time she is bothered is in her theater group when the kid <br/>
with a voice that is reminiscent of fingernails on a chalkboard gets a <br/>
leading role. The director is biased toward petite girls with nasal voices. <br/>
In spite of this she wants to continue with the troop.<br/>
<br/>
       What does your daughter think of all this? Is she bothered by all this <br/>
or are you? I remind Carly of all her wonderful traits. You can always turn <br/>
her negatives into positives. Instead of saying bossy, say assertive, <br/>
decisive. Our best traits are usually also our worst; it&#39;s all in how you <br/>
look at them.<br/>

I think you are right about the preconceived ideas, and this may definitely<br/>
be part of the problem.  I think my daughter is extremely mature at times,<br/>
and immature at other times.  I am fine with that, but most people aren&#39;t.<br/>
I mostly don&#39;t want her to be scarred from the emotional trauma of the way<br/>
people treat her, but I guess that would be every parent&#39;s hope.<br/>
<br/>
 I am doing a lot of the reminding her that she is a terrific talented<br/>
person, and that she has one very special friend who likes her for who she<br/>
is.  As a family, we try to encourage her to be herself, even when it is<br/>
unpopular, and say that we have done that as a family unit.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the only reason she has been so emotional over this issue is<br/>
because she is just realizing what is happening.  This year is the first<br/>
time that she realized that no one on her volleyball team talks to her, and<br/>
that they get upset with her when she tells them to do something.  But<br/>
again, this is one of those situations where the beginning of the dislike<br/>
happened because she is not in school with them.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure, as many have said, that things will get better as she gets older<br/>
and finds her place in the world.  Just hard on her right now, and me!  I<br/>
wish people really knew the girl I know!  I really think unschooling is<br/>
going to help her blossom into who she wants to be.  (Which was why she<br/>
wanted to do this play (it is actually a muscial) in the first place.  I<br/>
told her if this was something she really wanted to do, we would do it even<br/>
though it meant traveling 45 minutes each way two days a week, etc.  And,<br/>
even through all of this she still wants to do it!)<br/>

I don&#39;t think the independant drama thing will work, as we are too far out<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877621167">&lt;&lt; Yol is a practicing homeopath so that makes her advice *more* than<br/>
parent-to-parent. It&#39;s professional advice. I asked that she be aware of the<br/>
difference. She says there is no difference. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because in my perception of things, I am not giving professional advice. I think *expertise* is a tone and an attitude. I think this applies also to someone who&#39;s a violin teacher or a professional violinist speaking about violin stuff. I doubt anyone takes it as *professional advice*. I tend to think that people here (and on the HEM list) are intelligent enough to take what suits them and leave the rest out.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons why I became a homeopath is because I&#39;ve seen homeopathy help me throughout my life in magical and unexpected ways. So, my posts are mostly motivated by my own experience and not necessarily by a *professional* approach. I feel very fortunate to be able to offer my daughter an alternative approach in life that will make her life even easier and healthier and happier. This is why we do homeopathy, and this is why we unschool. And this is the main motivation behind wanting to share it with other people.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think one of the things school and society robs us of as parents is a<br/>
feeling of competency: that we aren&#39;t competent to determine the needs of<br/>
our own children. We can&#39;t tell a healthy child from an unhealthy one. The<br/>
clues are so subtle that only professionals would be able to recognize them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It has not been my intention at all to *rob* anyone. I think that to offer information and an alternative to the mainstream medical/psychological approach is actually empowering. But as with unschooling, you&#39;d need to switch your perception and realize that what seems &quot;ordinary&quot; may not be. It&#39;s like assuming that school behavior is &quot;ordinary&quot; when you can tell it&#39;s not if you get out of the mainstream box.<br/>
<br/>
I am a parent as well, and I&#39;ve seen many people bend over backwards trying to adjust their lives around issues they feel helpless about, and I can&#39;t help but feel for them and think, if they only knew! There are issues that have no simple solution, no matter how you approach them. I am grateful as a woman and as a mother for homeopathy at those times.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think it&#39;s important to support parents&#39; feelings of competence. When a<br/>
professional repeatedly suggests that ordinary problems should be seen by a<br/>
professional, I feel it undermines that feeling of competency. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it is also important to make parents feel that they&#39;re not alone and that there is help out there if they think what they&#39;re dealing with is not an &quot;ordinary&quot; problem. Someone who sees homeopathy as just another *medical profession* is missing on the nature of homeopathy. If I said to someone, you know meditation helps with stress and low self-esteem, would you say that I am offering *expert advice* because I&#39;ve been meditating for years and have a meditation center? Does that make me an *expert*? <br/>
<br/>
Homeopathy is a way of life too, where doctors, psychologists, nutritionists, and even dentists and many other *experts* can become a thing of the past, for the most part. Now, I think that can very empowering.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It was beginning to feel, to me, like people were being directed to a<br/>
homeopath for too many ordinary run-of-the-mill problems that parents<br/>
normally handle themselves. I felt it was heading towards being harmful to<br/>
some people trying to regain (or build in the first place!) their sense of<br/>
confidence in themselves as parents. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too many problems? I posted ONCE about it on the HEM list. The truth is that nobody, except Sandra, complained about my post, which was intended as a joke in the first place! And it was not until after Sandra and I got into a discussion about a later issue that Joyce e-mailed me privately to say that my posts on homeopathy (from days before) were irresponsible.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I did not ask her to stop giving out homeopathic advice. I asked her to be<br/>
more aware. She felt no one thought of her as a professional so her words<br/>
didn&#39;t mean any more than anyone elses&#39;. While that may be how some people<br/>
view her, I felt it was irresponsible not to see the power her words *could*<br/>
have on some people. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I still have to see my power here... At the most, I&#39;ve seen people ignore, question and make fun of my posts, or asking for help finding a homeopath, or maybe inquiring about a remedy, but I haven&#39;t seen anybody intimidated by what I&#39;ve posted. What I have seen, though, is someone else totally disempowering and pushing away a newcomer (on the HEM list) with harsh words, without Joyce making a peep about it. I thought it was unfair to give so much *power* to my words and not other people&#39;s tone or words, which indeed made the newcomer feel completely helpless, misunderstood and not given the chance to express herself. (Helen H. was the only one who said something about it.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; And, apparently it&#39;s now her choice to change her mind when she feels it&#39;s<br/>
too important not to offer her advice. And since, to me, this *again* seems<br/>
like another perfectly ordinary problem, the extraordinary need to pass on<br/>
homeopathic advice despite her declaration not to, reinforces my feelings<br/>
that judgement and power isn&#39;t being used wisely. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I shouldn&#39;t have said anything, I know. It just breaks my heart sometimes to hear what some people post here and just wish they knew how things could be much easier with a little help. Would it have made any difference if I had said, when I was a teenager homeopathy helped me with similar problems...? Or does the fact that I am a homeopath now marks my every post? No need to answer, really. I&#39;m just thinking out loud. This is your list, and I shouldn&#39;t post anything you don&#39;t want me to.<br/>

<br/>
No one suggested that if a boy touches himself he&#39;ll stop if he plays violin, <br/>
nor if a girl weren&#39;t getting the part she wanted in a play that professional <br/>
violin lessons should be sought immediately.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I tend to think that people here (and on the HEM list) are intelligent <br/>
enough to take what suits them and leave the rest out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What Joyce thinks about the list is important.<br/>
Her point is that someone who is insecure doesn&#39;t need to hear &quot;homeopathy&quot; <br/>
every time a learning or parenting situation is mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;One of the reasons why I became a homeopath is because I&#39;ve seen homeopathy <br/>
help me throughout my life in magical and unexpected ways. So, my posts are <br/>
mostly motivated by my own experience and not necessarily by a *professional* <br/>
approach.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loved books all my life, but if I were selling DK or Usborne books and <br/>
brought it up every time anyone said anything, I&#39;d be professionally selling <br/>
books.  <br/>
<br/>
We do have people here with home businesses of all sorts who aren&#39;t flooding <br/>
the list with recommendations for their products.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But as with unschooling, you&#39;d need to switch your perception and realize <br/>
that what seems &quot;ordinary&quot; may not be. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But as a mother with NO boys, you suggested strongly that little boys playing <br/>
with their penises was something about which to seek professional help.  It <br/>
isn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
Very many things ARE very ordinary.  Kids not getting parts in plays happens <br/>
WAY more often than kids getting parts in plays.  There is no homeopathy to <br/>
make kids good actors, nor make them charismatic.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am a parent as well, and I&#39;ve seen many people bend over backwards trying <br/>
to adjust their lives around issues they feel helpless about, and I can&#39;t <br/>
help but feel for them and think, if they only knew! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again you&#39;re suggesting that if there is an issue a parent feels helpless <br/>
about, IF THEY ONLY KNEW there was a homeopathic &quot;cure,&quot; they would be all <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think it is also important to make parents feel that they&#39;re not alone <br/>
and that there is help out there if they think what they&#39;re dealing with is <br/>
not an &quot;ordinary&quot; problem. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they think their problem is extraordinary, but other unschooling moms with <br/>
more experience can tell stories of similar situations which worked out <br/>
peacefully and sweetly, then this list will be serving a glorious purpose (as <br/>
it has for a long time).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I said to someone, you know meditation helps with stress and low <br/>
self-esteem, would you say that I am offering *expert advice* because I&#39;ve <br/>
been meditating for years and have a meditation center? Does that make me an <br/>
*expert*? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two or three people have mentioned in the past that your bristly posts here <br/>
are NOT good advertisements for meditation or yoga.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I shouldn&#39;t have said anything, I know. It just breaks my heart <br/>
sometimes to hear what some people post here and just wish they knew how <br/>
things could be much easier with a little help.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could e-mail them on the side, and then nobody here could say anything <br/>
about it.  Advise away, on the side.  But if you do it on the public list, <br/>
with its archives, others might feel obligated to counter the claim if you&#39;ve <br/>
suggested homeopathy as a remedy for something which is absolutely normal <br/>
child behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce says you said you wouldn&#39;t mention it further but you did.  <br/>
Do you intend to keep your word on this list?<br/>
<br/>
Joyce has had to TWICE defend what she actually said against your claims of <br/>
what she said.<br/>
Isn&#39;t there maybe a homeopathic remedy for being dishonest and defensive?<br/>

<br/>
I have also been concerned with the suggestion that behaviors in a child<br/>
that we may not understand or may not be comfortable with are somehow<br/>
disorders or syndromes or illnesses.   <br/>
For a long time now schools have been medicating kids who wiggle or talk<br/>
or get bored.   If a child seems different in the least from the rest of<br/>
the group they&#39;re not individuals they&#39;re suffering from a disorder that<br/>
must be treated. <br/>
<br/>
If kids don&#39;t like seams in their clothing, buy a bigger size or another<br/>
kind.  No one is treating the millions of adults who can&#39;t wear wool.   I<br/>
personally can&#39;t stand polyester, but I&#39;m not seeking treatment for my<br/>
aversion. <br/>
<br/>
I think an attitude that our children are just as they should be would be<br/>
infinitely more in keeping with an unschooling philosophy than an<br/>
attitude that some little difference is a sign of an imbalance.<br/>

when I was in 6th grade. I got the part of Bashful in the Snow White. Best time of <br/>
my life and fostered a wonderful love of the theater. It really is great to be able<br/>
to act next to the adults. When we moved to Maryland, I was involved with a great<br/>
Children&#39;s theater as well as community theater. Funny thing, I never played more<br/>
then bit parts in high school...there seemed to be more favoritism there. But<br/>
I got great parts in community theater...my favorite was playing Dinah in The <br/>
Philadelphia Story (I was 17 playing 15). I was the only &quot;kid&quot; in the cast and<br/>
learned so much. IN college I switched to doing behind the scenes stuff (mainly<br/>
because I could not get home to audition for summer plays early enough). Kept<br/>
doing it up until Jason was born (freaked people out when they saw a pregnant<br/>
woman climbing up the ladder into the light booth LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess that I rambled a bit...can you tell I loved community theater.<br/>
