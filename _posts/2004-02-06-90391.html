Since the school reforms of the 60s and 70s opened up the gates of<br/>
hell, and are at least half responsible for all the evils of the<br/>
present day (remember that the 50s were a Golden Era of perfection),<br/>
the very worst thing I can do is link what I&#39;m trying to do now<br/>
(unschooling) with school reform from then.  (Also, being 30+ and the<br/>
product of said reforms, this would only reinforce for them how overly<br/>
permissive and misguided I am).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOL. I&#39;d just tell them that I am on the cutting edge of education.They are <br/>
RIGHT! Schools are NOT what they once were! *I* have got to take over where <br/>
these schools have failed! The apathy in colleges from high school graduates is <br/>
astounding! Rote learning and no critical thinking---what are the schools <br/>
*thinking*????<br/>
<br/>
There was this school reformer in the 70&#39;s & 80&#39;s who realized that schools <br/>
are NOT reformable and they&#39;re just getting worse. I&#39;m taking HIS advice and <br/>
UNschooling!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m SO glad that they (parents & in-laws) are well-educated, because *they* <br/>
can understand where I&#39;m coming from. They must KNOW that learning doesn&#39;t stop <br/>
at 12th grade or after college. We&#39;re all learing all the time until today&#39;s <br/>
school system beats it out of us! Aren&#39;t THEY still learning? I could help! <br/>
&lt;g&gt; Would they like some light reading? I have books and articles and websites I <br/>
can give them! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651910088">This is the standard thing I send out to potential unschoolers in SC. I&#39;d <br/>
um..... cut & paste!  But it&#39;ll give you a starting point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling Basics<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is trusting the child to learn what he needs to learn when he<br/>
needs to learn it. Unschooling is also sometimes called &quot;natural learning&quot; and<br/>
&quot;child-led learning&quot; . But mostly unschooling is NOT school-at home: we do not<br/>
try to replicate school in our houses. It&#39;s real living in the real<br/>
world---for and with a purpose. You cannot live and not learn---we&#39;re <br/>
surrounded by real opportunities every day to learn. And it&#39;s REAL learning, not <br/>
simulated as in<br/>
school. Living is learning is unschooling is living is learning is<br/>
unschooling.....<br/>
<br/>
There are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and on<br/>
the marvels of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer in the<br/>
70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most popular<br/>
books are How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and Learning<br/>
All the Time.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He finally<br/>
quit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind<br/>
unschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground History<br/>
of American Education.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith has a great little book called The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting that shows how little one learns in and remembers from school. He<br/>
pushes REAL learning---for a purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic<br/>
motivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic<br/>
motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School and<br/>
Get a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great read for<br/>
teens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute little<br/>
story&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; in <br/>
the early<br/>
fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers and share<br/>
passions and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Griffith has two books, The Homeschooling Handbook and The Unschooling<br/>
Handbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for documenting<br/>
what&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC, it&#39;s very <br/>
helpful.<br/>
But The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new unschoolers. In it she<br/>
gives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. Convinced my<br/>
husband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
David Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and Homeschooling and the<br/>
Voyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>
<br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I highly recommend: The<br/>
Unprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her daughter,<br/>
Laurie. I give it as gifts a LOT!<br/>
<br/>
Magazines:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Home Education Magazine&quot; (known as HEM)<br/>
&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot; <br/>
&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally put out by John Holt. No longer in <br/>
production, but back issues available from &quot;old&quot; unschoolers and from FUNbooks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Websites:<br/>
<br/>
www.unschooling.com is THE website for unschooling. There are other lists<br/>
that &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are the radicals who KNOW what they are <br/>
talking<br/>
about. There are essays and FAQs which you should definitely read first.<br/>
Afterwards go to the message boards and read, read, READ! If you have <br/>
questions<br/>
after reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things have been explained<br/>
before, so if you read, you&#39;ll run across the answers to most of your<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
The posters to pay attention to are Sandra Dodd, Joyce Fetteroll, Pam<br/>
Sorooshian, Anne Ohman, and Mary Gold. There are other wonderful posters, but<br/>
these are all radical unschoolers who all have great ways of expressing <br/>
themselves and getting to the nitty gritty of unschooling. They will all be at the<br/>
conference in August.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> is a great e-list if you prefer your <br/>
messages in mail form, but the traffic is HIGH. 200-400/day on the Discussion <br/>
list. Unless you&#39;re hard core, or just prefer your lists this way, I&#39;d recommend <br/>
the message boards.<br/>
<br/>
There is also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com</a>. For beginners.<br/>
<br/>
www.SchoolsOutSupport.org is the SC unschooling support group. Membership is<br/>
free. It has a message board and info about laws and local groups. It hosts<br/>
the unschooling conference in August.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 16, 14, & 12 (I<br/>
think). She has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays and stories <br/>
about<br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s a great place to start. www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling  She<br/>
is also the keynote speaker at the August conference.<br/>
<br/>
Ned Vare & Luz Shosie have an<br/>
already-graduated-from-college-always-unschooled son. Their website is full of<br/>
short essays on unschooling. They have a<br/>
newsletter as well. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/">http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/</a><br/>
<br/>
Billy and Nancy Greer own FUN-books---a mail-order catalogue for unschoolish<br/>
books and games. www.FUN-Books.com   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the conference: Here&#39;s the flyer:<br/>
<br/>
School&#39;s Out Support&#39;s Live & Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>
August 22-24 in Columbia, SC at the Holiday Inn-Coliseum.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;THIS YEAR IN PEABODY, MA AUGUST 27-29. 2004. Go To <br/>
www.LiveandLaernConference.org &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This conference is a must attend! Meet other families on the same journey,<br/>
listen to inspiring speakers, and discover the art of unschooling in beautiful<br/>
downtown Columbia, SC. This is a non-age-discriminatory conference: anyone can<br/>
participate in any Funshop or Presentation. Bring the whole family for a<br/>
joy-filled weekend!<br/>
<br/>
School&#39;s Out Support (SOS) is a volunteer-driven, statewide organization<br/>
whose mission is to support and promote unschooling, provide information,<br/>
monitor and influence legislation, offer opportunities for families to get <br/>
together,<br/>
and empower families to make the choices that respect the rights, needs and<br/>
aspirations of their children. SOS welcomes anyone with an interest in<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Since its inception in April 2001, SOS has supported families that have made<br/>
the decision to unschool as they face difficult questions and challenges.<br/>
These families may wonder about socialization, the legal issues surrounding<br/>
unschooling, accountability associations, or integration of John Holt&#39;s<br/>
educational philosophy into their everyday lives. Some families may doubt <br/>
their abilities, feel confused and ask themselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. SOS <br/>
encourages<br/>
parents to trust themselves and their children to make good decisions and<br/>
empowers them to find the support and information they need.<br/>
<br/>
Our Presenters<br/>
For our Keynote presenter we are very fortunate to have the popular<br/>
contributor to Unschooling.com message boards, its e-list, AlwaysLearning, and<br/>
regular columnist in HEM---unschooling guru, Sandra Dodd. A former middle <br/>
school<br/>
teacher, Sandra has talked countless families into running away from school <br/>
and<br/>
jumping into learning for fun. Her motto: &quot;Everything Counts!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also delighted to have Anne Ohman, from the Unschooling.com message<br/>
boards, back for a return engagement. She &quot;stole the show&quot; last year with her<br/>
debut and is now in demand at conferences all over the country. AnneO&#39;s<br/>
passionate, gentle approach to life and learning continues to inspire families<br/>
daily.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian is well known in &quot;all the unschooling<br/>
circles&quot;---Unschooling.com&#39;s message boards, the unschoolingdotcom e-list,<br/>
AlwaysLearning, NHEN, and<br/>
the California boards. When she&#39;s not teaching college level economics and<br/>
statistics, Pam&#39;s an unschooling mom of three teenagers: she&#39;s &quot;been there, <br/>
done<br/>
<br/>
that&quot;---and will surely have a few answers for you!<br/>
<br/>
Mary Gold is better known as &quot;Zenmomma&quot;--and you can find her wherever<br/>
unschooling is a topic! Mary &quot;preaches&quot; peace and trust and joy---and the pure<br/>
delight of unschooling her children. Her encouraging words are music to a<br/>
stressed<br/>
parent&#39;s ears---and she always leaves you knowing that &quot;Life is good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jim Weiss&#39; storytelling has captivated and delighted both adults and children<br/>
with his original stories and retellings of classics. To hear him tell a<br/>
story is to be swept into another world. Jim&#39;s award-winning tapes are <br/>
favorites<br/>
<br/>
in many homes---including ours!<br/>

You may also all me anytime to ask questions or discuss concerns. I truly<br/>
believe that school is harmful---physically, emotionally, intellectually, and<br/>
spiritually. It&#39;s a bad place to spend a childhood.<br/>
