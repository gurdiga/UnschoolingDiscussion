<div id="ygrps-yiv-210590417">Hi Carol<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to answer your post, because this is something that I <br/>
struggle with, though I was raised in a very relaxed way (too <br/>
relaxed IMO) I&#39;ve seen what &#39;laissez-faire&#39; parenting can do on the<br/>
receiving end.  So I try to be more &#39;pro-active&#39; with my children,<br/>
which sometimes means that I&#39;m harder than I need or want to be.  <br/>
 I find it hard to strike the balance, since even though I feel over-<br/>
authoritarian, a lot of the time, I&#39;m still more empathetic and less<br/>
judgemental, less patronising than most other people I see around <br/>
me. <br/>
I don&#39;t ask my children to behave like performing dogs for the in-<br/>
laws<br/>
for example!  (this really gets my goat, and I know that&#39;s<br/>
judgemental!)  It&#39;s very hard to find role-models to learn from, in<br/>
the flesh, which is the best way to learn such things, I think.  So I<br/>
make do with the support I get from this list and others.   On one<br/>
such list, there was a debate about smacking and discipline and<br/>
punishment, which was quite educational *grin*  One of the posts <br/>
was<br/>
very useful to me, it said everything that I&#39;d wanted to say, and what<br/>
I needed to hear, too, along with adding more information than I&#39;d <br/>
had<br/>
before.  I&#39;ve yet to read the book finally recommended myself, <br/>
though<br/>
I can recognise the process, since I&#39;ve read the Faber and Mazlish<br/>
books, and while they&#39;re a good &#39;kicking-off-point,&#39; acknowledging <br/>
the<br/>
fact that children generally behave as well as they feel, so giving<br/>
them respect and empathising with their feelings will help things,<br/>
they&#39;re still about promoting certain behaviours, as oppose to<br/>
respecting the whole child for their own sake.   So I&#39;ve included it<br/>
here, cos I think it&#39;s a great piece of writing, and says what I want<br/>
to say, but with the benefit of greater experience than mine.  And I<br/>
just want to second the person who said that you are a GREAT <br/>
parent<br/>
for recognising the need and capacity for change, for questioning <br/>
the<br/>
status-quo, for sticking to your guns, school won&#39;t change any of <br/>
the<br/>
problems you have, and from the sounds of things would just make <br/>
it<br/>
harder, more competitive, even less time for the fun things.  The <br/>
very<br/>
best to you<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I suppose I would say wilful disobedience of a clearly given<br/>
&gt; parental instruction, given in a normal voice, accompanied by the<br/>
&gt; moral/pragmatic reason why (&quot;eg, I should like you to pick up <br/>
 </span></blockquote>your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; coat that you left on the floor since it is getting in the way&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that was how I used to see it too.  But gradually I learned a <br/>
few<br/>
extra things:<br/>
<br/>
1)  To some types of people a politely requested, but direct<br/>
instruction like that, actually appears as rude and complaining.  I<br/>
find this hard to comprehend, but my husband assures me it is true <br/>
-<br/>
although he in his turn tries to see beyond what he perceives as<br/>
rudeness in such requests.  My YS understands things like I do, <br/>
and my<br/>
OS understands as my husband does.  To YS, a request such as <br/>
yours<br/>
would be greeted with something like, &#39;Oh yes, I forgot, sorry&#39; and<br/>
immediate - and fairly cheerful - picking up of the coat.  To OS,<br/>
there would be an instant, &#39;Why do you always complain at me so<br/>
much??&#39;<br/>
<br/>
If your child is of this personality type, then you might simply need<br/>
to phrase your requests differently.  &#39;Oh dear, the coat is on the<br/>
floor again and I&#39;m worried I&#39;m going to trip over it,&#39; would be the<br/>
way I would make such a request to my husband or OS for them to <br/>
find<br/>
it reasonable and polite, and to respond by picking it up.<br/>
<br/>
2)  It&#39;s important to distinguish between what is someone else&#39;s<br/>
problem and what is your problem.  In this case (and I realise it&#39;s<br/>
just one specific minor example, but this can be extrapolated to<br/>
almost anything else) the problem is yours.  Your child doesn&#39;t <br/>
mind<br/>
the coat being on the floor - but you do.  Obviously you could just<br/>
pick it up yourself each time, but that wouldn&#39;t help the child learn<br/>
responsibility, and could lead to repressed anger and irritation all<br/>
round as the child might not know where the coat was after it was <br/>
hung<br/>
up, and you would feel manipulated, as if you were being treated <br/>
like<br/>
a servant.<br/>
<br/>
But having acknowledged that it&#39;s your problem, yet wanting the<br/>
child to do something about it, you can have a discussion - <br/>
preferably not<br/>
at a tense time - where you explain, using I-messages only, that it<br/>
bothers you when coats are left lying around.  Give as many <br/>
reasons as<br/>
you can - the coat was expensive and you&#39;re worried it might get <br/>
torn<br/>
if someone treads on it.  It will get dirty quickly and it&#39;s a<br/>
nuisance to keep washing it.  It&#39;s in an awkward place and someone<br/>
might trip over it.<br/>
 Things might fall out of the pockets... etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
Then listen to the child&#39;s point of view.  We did this - actually with<br/>
the same thing - for ours at one point, and the children explained<br/>
that it was difficult to reach the hooks, and the coats kept falling<br/>
off.  But they didn&#39;t want to have to take them to their bedrooms all<br/>
the time as it meant running upstairs when they might be tired, and<br/>
then it was a nuisance when we went out and they had to go back <br/>
up to<br/>
fetch them.  So we fitted some new - and bigger - coat hooks in the<br/>
hallway, for children only, at half the height of adult ones. Problem<br/>
solved.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a child will come up with what seems like an <br/>
unacceptable<br/>
solution - if they actually *want* their coat on the floor, for<br/>
instance!  In that case you might need to come up with some place<br/>
where the coat can be left on the floor, but it&#39;s unlikely that anyone<br/>
will trip over it or step on it.  Perhaps a low stool would be a good<br/>
compromise, or a chair cushion that&#39;s only for the child&#39;s coat,<br/>
somewhere out of the way.  The child might offer to wash the coat <br/>
when<br/>
it gets dirty... in which case, accept the offer and teach them how <br/>
to<br/>
wash the coat and hang it out to dry.  Seeing what is involved is<br/>
often enough to help the child see the adult&#39;s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
3)  We tend to think we are being reasonable (&#39;obviously&#39; it&#39;s not a<br/>
good idea to have coats lying around....) and therefore have the right<br/>
to tell our children what to do, until they see reason for ourselves. <br/>
I do agree with this from a safety point of view (road crossing is my<br/>
chief example) but I&#39;d rather help my children understand than just<br/>
get them to do something because I say so.  Just like HE (yes, <br/>
this is<br/>
on-topic! &lt;g&gt;) - we help them understand concepts, answer <br/>
questions,<br/>
and encourage them to research things for themselves and come <br/>
up with<br/>
their own solutions to problems.  We don&#39;t do what sometimes <br/>
happens<br/>
in schools - giving out busywork and drill, coercing them to do it,<br/>
and hoping that sooner or later something will catch on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the punishment would be given for refusal to pick up the coat, not<br/>
&gt; for (absent-midedly?) leaving it there in the first place).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I did believe this when my children were much younger.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s the James Dobson approach.  But when I thought more deeply <br/>
about<br/>
it, I realised that &#39;wilful disobedience&#39; is a bit of a strange<br/>
concept, really.  Children want to please their parents on the whole <br/>
-<br/>
they *need* to be loved and cared for.  So any apparent <br/>
disobedience<br/>
is due to lack of understanding, or being in a bad mood for some<br/>
unrelated reason, or exhaustion.... all the kinds of things that also<br/>
make adults sometimes irritable or stroppy.  But small children<br/>
haven&#39;t learned to explain this, or to hide it, and indeed shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have to hide their feelings in front of their parents.<br/>
<br/>
When they are trying to express their independence by saying &#39;no&#39;,<br/>
they&#39;re only trying to grow up and act more like adults do!  And as<br/>
parents frequently say &#39;no&#39; to their children&#39;s requests, it&#39;s pretty<br/>
unreasonable for the children not to be allowed to say &#39;no&#39; back.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I speak in retrospect - my children are now much older<br/>
and I don&#39;t really see &#39;punishment&#39; as applying at all to pre-teens<br/>
and teenagers, because we get along together (on the whole) and<br/>
discuss things together.  They don&#39;t want their clothes to get torn<br/>
and dirty any more than I do.  It&#39;s much more difficult when you&#39;re<br/>
confronted with a stroppy four-year-old crying &#39;I won&#39;t!!&#39; to what you<br/>
perceived as an entirely reasonable request.  If you say, &#39;OK, I&#39;ll<br/>
pick it up&#39; then it paves the way for the child to expect you to do<br/>
that kind of thing every time.  If you leave it on the floor, then the<br/>
coat may well get torn, or someone might trip over it.  If you enforce<br/>
some kind of punishment (or even shout and threaten until the child<br/>
does what you ask) then you&#39;ve been controlling, and the child is<br/>
likely to be resentful because of feeling powerless.  If you keep<br/>
arguing, then the child feels caught in a corner too.<br/>
<br/>
But if you sit down with the child, and say, &#39;OK. you don&#39;t feel like<br/>
hanging up your coat.  But I&#39;m worried that someone might fall over<br/>
it. What do you think we should do about it?&#39; then you&#39;ve done three<br/>
things: firstly acknowledged the child&#39;s feelings; secondly pointed<br/>
out your own worries without being accusatory, thirdly turned the<br/>
problem over to the child and asked for suggestions - which leaves <br/>
the<br/>
child free to come up with an original idea, or even back down and<br/>
acknowledge your point of view without feeling humiliated.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And as I posted earlier, I suspect that in loving families with open<br/>
&gt; communction disobedience in these sort of situations this rarely<br/>
&gt; happens.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a lot depends on the child, and on the parental response. <br/>
Some<br/>
children just seem determined to be stroppy, and most of them go<br/>
through stages of being extra-assertive or apparently doing the<br/>
opposite of what they&#39;re asked.  Sometimes this is a kind of<br/>
subconscious test of the parents&#39; love - will we *really* keep loving<br/>
them and accepting them even if they&#39;re obnoxious?  It&#39;s how they<br/>
learn about unconditional love.<br/>
<br/>
I threw out my James Dobson books when I&#39;d read other parenting<br/>
books - firstly Kevin Leman&#39;s &#39;How to make your children mind<br/>
without losing yours&#39;, which showed me the importance of teaching<br/>
about consequences (rather than arbitrary punishments).  Yet in <br/>
some<br/>
ways he&#39;s still advocating control, although of a less authoritarian<br/>
manner.  Then I read &#39;How to talk so your kids will listen and listen<br/>
so your kids will talk&#39;, which gives lots of examples of dealing with<br/>
&#39;I-messages&#39;, and determining whose problem you are dealing with, <br/>
and<br/>
other techniques.  It&#39;s an excellent book and I&#39;d highly recommend <br/>
it,<br/>
but *still* there&#39;s an element of control in it - the idea of making<br/>
our children do things to make our life easier/more pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
Then I read Ross Campbell&#39;s book &#39;How to really love your child&#39;, <br/>
and<br/>
it revolutionised the way I think about things.  He really didn&#39;t talk<br/>
about discipline much at all, but looked from the point of view of a<br/>
child longing to be loved and understood, with an immature <br/>
&#39;emotional<br/>
tank&#39; that needed constant filling.  Campbell&#39;s theory is that<br/>
whenever a child is behaving in ways that antagonise parents, <br/>
they&#39;re<br/>
crying out for attention.  Some need more than others, some are <br/>
hurt<br/>
in ways we can&#39;t begin to understand.  But we can respond *first* <br/>
by<br/>
giving lots of hugs, eye contact, time doing what the child chooses,<br/>
listening to all they say and acknowledging their feelings as valid,<br/>
and so on.  99% of the time problems are resolved when the child is<br/>
feeling truly loved and knows that the parents want to understand.<br/>
<br/>
Well that&#39;s quite enough philosophising from me...</div>

<br/>
Thanks.  I printed the post you forwarded and I will<br/>
keep it and read it.  I want to read that book, also,<br/>
because I felt much the same way about Mazlish and<br/>
Faber.  <br/>
I just wish I could figure a way out to give so much<br/>
attention to seven at the same time.  Don&#39;t get me<br/>
wrong-I love having a big family-but sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
just so darned hard to even focus!<br/>
<br/>
Take care and thanks again-<br/>
