<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954331588">Hi all!  Renewed sub. here.  Been lurking last month.<br/>
<br/>
Would like to hear any thoughts re: pets death and grieving times.<br/>
<br/>
We just lost our 8yr. male cat to an illness.  Kids grieved about 4 <br/>
hours and then wanted to look for a new kitten.  We got an 8 wk. old <br/>
kitten next day.<br/>
<br/>
I am trusting that this is the right decision but am a little <br/>
worried that they may have grief start to fester with the quick turn <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Tina</div>

 </span></blockquote>We lost a 16 year old cat about a month  and a half ago.  My four year old <br/>
still wakes up at night thinking about him and needs snuggling.  We&#39;ve had many <br/>
discussions about death - she&#39;s at that age.  She was particularly frightened <br/>
that the cat just went to sleep and never woke up again.  (We, on the other <br/>
hand, were thrilled he went so peacefully.)  We talk about it probably every <br/>
other day now.  My five year old will occasionally talk about the cat.  He was <br/>
very involved in the burial rituals, making a grave marker, etc.  He shows <br/>
everyone the burial site, but is more accepting of death.  He was 3 1/2 when his <br/>
grandpa died, so this is really his second death.  It&#39;s my daughter&#39;s first, <br/>
really as she doesn&#39;t remember her Grandpa much.<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends on the child&#39;s age, their exposure to death in the past <br/>
and their closeness to the animal.  A friend across the street had to put their <br/>
dog down and the five year old was asking for another dog the next day.<br/>
<br/>
Our cat&#39;s death has led to some interesting math discussions, though.  As in, <br/>
we have four pets - two cats and two fish.  We used to have five pets - three <br/>
cats and two fish.  Soon we&#39;ll have five people - two kids, a mom, a dad and <br/>
a baby.  Pretty good for a four year old!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095907478">That&#39;s why I am a little worried:  b/c the cat was an indoor cat and <br/>
was my dd&#39;s.  She is 7.  He never left her.  He slept with her and <br/>
followed her everywhere since she was 6mths old.<br/>
<br/>
Now with this new kitten, for the past ( oh say 20 hours)(we got him <br/>
yest.) she hasn&#39;t put him down.  He must be soothing to her soul.<br/>

Now my 11yr. ds. worked on a memory book and is discussing the cat.<br/>

loved and with us all of the time.<br/>

in our own way.  <br/>
<br/>
I seem to be the saddest about Dakota dying; he was really my dog.  I <br/>
still have a sensation of him greeting me at the door when I come <br/>
home, or lying in his favorite spot.  And every now and again Luke <br/>
(5) will say something like &quot;oh yeah, Dakota isn&#39;t here to bark when <br/>
we come in.&quot;  My daughter Addi (9) cried really hard and long the <br/>
night he died, AND in the middle of her panic cry she sobbed, &quot;Can we <br/>
get a puppy?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t put a time frame on my or my kids&#39; grieving, because I don&#39;t <br/>
know their brain pathways or processes for going through that.  I <br/>
trust that I will know when I&#39;m ready to get another dog, and that <br/>
when my kids are ready also.<br/>

new kitten could provoke talk and remembering of your old cat.  When <br/>
ever I have misgivings about my actions, I look at my motives.  If I <br/>
got a new cat to cover up the pain of losing one, then I&#39;m taking <br/>
away  my kids&#39; grief process and that isn&#39;t healing, it&#39;s hindering.  <br/>
If I got a new cat because we wanted one, then we got a new cat and <br/>
we&#39;re still grieving/processing the death of our old cat.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978396993">We lost our old shelties over six years ago.  Lexie was 2 1/2.  we lost <br/>
a baby in June, Jasmine (16 year old sheltie) in July, and Jerry (15 <br/>
year old sheltie) in August.  It was the summer from hell, and probably <br/>
that is why we often talk about those animals and how much we miss <br/>
them.  They (their ashes anyway) live on top of our shelves by our bed, <br/>
in an urn (along with two cats and a bird).  The girls love to look at <br/>
the bags of ashes. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know I reread that a couple of times, and it really struck a <br/>
chord.<br/>
Because our cat was sick and we had been grieving thru the process, <br/>
I truly trust the kids wanting a new cat because they wanted one.  <br/>
Not to cover the pain.<br/>
For me though, it is bitter sweet.  Perhaps because I know how final <br/>
death is.  This is their first pet to die.</div>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter&#39;s childhood pet Edgar Allan Paws died four years ago.  He was old <br/>
but hadn&#39;t been sick too long.  What seemed like just an ear infection turned <br/>
into a deadly infection, even with numerous treatments from the vet.<br/>
<br/>
She was crushed, she grieved longer and harder for Edgar than I&#39;ve seen <br/>
anyone grieve, even for people.<br/>
<br/>
But I recognized that Edgar knew all her secrets, when I might have been busy <br/>
doing something, he was always available for dress up and stroller rides.  He <br/>
had an entire wardrobe of crazy outfits and suffered through wearing them for <br/>
Cait.  He endured baths and blow drying and hair bows in his long manly fur.  <br/>
He slept with her at night keeping all harm away.<br/>
<br/>
If someone or something made her angry she would scoop him up and run to her <br/>
room to tell him all about it.<br/>
<br/>
He was with her for most of her &quot;firsts&quot; in her life and it was very hard to <br/>
see him go.<br/>
<br/>
She made herself physically sick for days.  We all missed him too and even my <br/>
DH cried when we knew he was finally gone after such a fight to stay with us.<br/>
<br/>
She slept in our room often after this, coming in crying that she missed <br/>
Eddie. It was heartbreaking.<br/>
<br/>
We did get a new kitten about nine months later.  She LOVED Lily at first but <br/>
on the second night she came crying into my room carrying Lily and saying she <br/>
HATED Lily she wanted Edgar back.  Of course she didn&#39;t HATE Lily but she was <br/>
very sad that it wasn&#39;t Eddie.<br/>
<br/>
It was a hard struggle to know what was the right thing to do.  There were <br/>
thoughts of finding a new home for Lily if it seemed to hard for her to be in <br/>
the house with Cait.<br/>
<br/>
In the end Cait loved Lily but it did take her a very long time to get over <br/>
loosing her childhood friend, Edgar.  She was 11 at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Just this past summer she lost another cat, Isabella.  She had Issy for just <br/>
over a year when she died.  She was very sad and upset that a one year old cat <br/>
would die on her and she really blamed the vet (and with good cause) but it <br/>
wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as when Edgar died.  She got another baby kitten within <br/>
the week and loves Charlotte very much from the start. <br/>
<br/>
 I think maybe with being 15 and going through death more times (five <br/>
relatives died in one year) she is able to understand better that loving someone else <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean we love those we have lost any less.<br/>
<br/>
Listening, cuddling and sharing the pain and sharing the memories of the lost <br/>
pet were the only things that seemed to help at all, but most of all, time <br/>
was the best healer as with most grief I think.<br/>
<br/>
Also that we had lots of pictures of Edgar and a lovely neighborhood funeral <br/>
and she ordered him a nice stone helped.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear of your pets passing, I know it is so very hard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132318268">I really appreciate your thoughtful post.  Even though my dd is <br/>
still holding onto that kitten, now named Tiger, she just this <br/>
morning mentioned she wanted to travel to see God.  I asked her if <br/>
she thought maybe she wanted to see Luke (our deceased cat).  It let <br/>
to a discussion about heaven, will Luke know her, etc.  She didn&#39;t <br/>
cry but verbally let go of some of the grief.<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
