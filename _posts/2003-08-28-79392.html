<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068774700">You need the original Sims in order to use Hot Date/House Party/etc. It&#39;s<br/>
called The Sims (have the people).  You can buy Sims deluxe that has the<br/>
original and Living Large.  The &quot;original&quot; Sims that you probably have is<br/>
Sim City (no people).  This info comes from a very experienced Sims addict..<br/>
my wife ;-)<br/>
Peace,<br/>
