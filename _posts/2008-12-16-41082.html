<div id="ygrps-yiv-110690624">My oldest just turned 6 and we need to meet the FL requirment of either <br/>
sending a letter of intent to homeschool or enrolling him in <br/>
a &quot;private&quot; school.  I was leaning toward the umbrella school b/c it <br/>
only requires &quot;attendance&quot; records and we could avoid the <br/>
testing/evaluations necessary under the homeschool choice.  Are there <br/>
any disadvantages to using an umbrella school?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Let&#39;s discuss this idea as it applies to anyone in the world, rather  <br/>
than to Florida specifically.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think more options to public school are better than less!  So, in<br/>
general, I think umbrella schools are a wonderful thing.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, there should be no need of such a thing because, in my own<br/>
little ideal world scenario, there would be no laws regulating<br/>
homeschooling, therefore, no need to jump through the hoops of an<br/>
umbrella school to avoid intrusive testing and oversite.<br/>
<br/>
So, all in all, the disadvantage that I see of using an umbrella school,<br/>
is perpetuating the need of it.</div>
