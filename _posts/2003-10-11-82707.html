<br/>
       Unschooling to me is about support and encouragement of unique <br/>
individuals, rather than defining, delimiting or dictating what&#39;s best for others, or <br/>
manipulating others to one&#39;s own ends. So how could unschooling be compatible <br/>
with political pronouncements about the private lives and choices of others? <br/>
<br/>
       Whether the issue is marriage and family, religion and spirituality, <br/>
or learning and education, how can any unschooler support political intrusion <br/>
of any sort into what an individual thinks and feels, and how one expresses it <br/>
in one&#39;s own private life?  JJ<br/>

<br/>
That was an artsy rhetorical question, right?<br/>
<br/>
Because I am not comfortable with separatist, white-supremist gun-toting <br/>
homeschoolers who teach their children that liberals are the army of Satan come to <br/>
prepare the earth for the anti-Christ.  That bothers me some.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m nervous when I think about the Christian Homeschoolers who campaigned <br/>
so hard for Bush because they want God&#39;s kingdom to come on earth, in the <br/>
congress especially, and the Supreme Court.  I worry about my kids growing up and <br/>
having to deal with their kids who will say &quot;Hey we were homeschooled too!  <br/>
So I guess you&#39;re also conservative, &#39;pro-life&#39; Nazi-ready; let&#39;s go shoot some <br/>
Jewish health care providers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t control those other people, and they can&#39;t control me.<br/>
But they would sure like to.<br/>

       I very much agree it&#39;s uncomfortably true we cannot control others. <br/>
It&#39;s most especially and most unfortunately true imo that we cannot control the <br/>
ones who would like to control us.  JJ<br/>

It was pretty lyrical and poetic.  That&#39;s not a bad thing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
