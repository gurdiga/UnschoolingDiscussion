<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160784352">&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This post will stay at the top until the end of the day Friday,<br/>
November 29th. Please scroll down for updates.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/&quot;&gt;Buy<br/>
Nothing Day&lt;/a&gt;, and about anti-consumerism in general. And I&#39;m considering<br/>
the words of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starhawk.org&quot;&gt;Starhawk&lt;/a&gt;, when she speaks<br/>
of finding a more positive model for combatting globalization, beginning with<br/>
what we CALL things. And I&#39;m wondering if it might be more appropriate, rather<br/>
than participating in Buy Nothing Day, to participate in Create Something Day.<br/>
<br/>
So, with that in mind, I hereby proclaim Friday, November 29, 2002 to be the<br/>
first annual Create Something Day. Draw a picture, write a poem, sing a song,<br/>
make a sculpture out of found objects, do collage art, paint, dream, cook a<br/>
meal, make a friend, write a letter, make a mix tape, start a blog...create<br/>
something out of things you already have available to you.<br/>
<br/>
Because, generally, when we cease to do something, we find something to take<br/>
its place. If we cease to participate in consumerism, let&#39;s fill that gap with<br/>
something positive. Let&#39;s fill it with something creative.<br/>
<br/>
Because the opposite of consumption is production. And we can choose to<br/>
produce things that are positive and good for others to consume.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to participate in Create Something Day, please trackback or<br/>
comment here and let me know what you&#39;ve created. It doesn&#39;t have to be a<br/>
masterpiece. It doesn&#39;t even have to be tangible. It just has to be something<br/>
that you feel has a positive impact.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397323777">Actually, I have participated in discussions before. I&#39;ve been a <br/>
member of the list for over a year now, but generally by the time I <br/>
get here, whatever I would contribute has already been contributed.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I would understand this response if I was trying to sell <br/>
something, but in actuality I&#39;m just posting a suggestion based on a <br/>
post about buy nothing day. If you don&#39;t consider that a <br/>
contribution to the discussion, I&#39;m not sure what to tell you.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, someone on another venue objected to the creating <br/>
something idea by saying that creating something contributes to the <br/>
vast array of things out there. So we decided that his contribution <br/>
to create something day was nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Or something.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, yes. Whatever works for you.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
But there are things... like creating music, food, laughter, togetherness...<br/>
<br/>
Today I happened to have an hour-long conversation with Kirby (16) in the van <br/>
near a park in Alamogordo, where his sister, brother and dad were off at the <br/>
playground.  But Kirby and I stayed in the van.   We talked about music (he <br/>
said he wants to learn to play piano) and perception and how music or art can <br/>
be like a second language, in the way that it&#39;s another way to see the world <br/>
and that those who have another plane of understanding, whether it&#39;s a <br/>
literal second language (Kirby&#39;s uncle just got back from two weeks in Lima, <br/>
Peru, where he was thrilled that his northern New Mexico Spanish not only got <br/>
him by, but people didn&#39;t peg him as a foreigner, even) or another <br/>
&quot;intelligence&quot; (though we werne&#39;t using that word).<br/>
<br/>
Just that conversation, and Kirby&#39;s surprising insights, might end up being <br/>
something that will produce changes in not only our lives, but other people&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Because of music and writing, I&#39;m sensitized to the non-tangible-production <br/>
end of life.  Some writings end up &quot;tangible,&quot; but lots of online writing <br/>
ends up in the atmosphere, recycled as the particles of light and electricity <br/>
it ever was.<br/>
