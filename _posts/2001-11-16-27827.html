<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143621621">Bridget makes some good points on Sandra&#39;s &#39;style&#39;.  I&#39;ve listened to both<br/>
of them for quite awhile now.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve had the fairly recent experience of having my words seriously<br/>
misconstrued along with baseless assumptions about my state of mind - by<br/>
Sandra - that I must be envious of the TV....or jealous that my children<br/>
attend to it; and the erroneous assumption that because someone else&#39;s<br/>
metaphorical description &quot;like a mindless bloog&quot; brought to mind something<br/>
I&#39;d studied over a decade ago,  I must rely on the results of one study to<br/>
direct my decisions;  not to mention the assumption that,  because I<br/>
understand another parent&#39;s struggle with whether or how to limit TV<br/>
viewing,  that I MUST be using some kind of measures to control my<br/>
children&#39;s behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
I respect Sandra&#39;s perspective and experience,  if not always liking her<br/>
style.  I have come to understand from her input here,  that she hopes to<br/>
enable those newer to unschooling to avoid mistakes she has either<br/>
experienced personally or through her relationships with others who&#39;ve<br/>
travelled this path.  These are MY words and MY understanding,  which only<br/>
Sandra can clarify.<br/>
<br/>
My recent experience with having my message so distorted leads me to wonder<br/>
whether Sandra likes to *rile* (sp?) things up in order to push buttons and<br/>
keep the discussion lively.  If so,  she is often effective.  Regardless,  I<br/>
have found that whether or not I have time to respond on the list,  I do<br/>
more fully articulate my feelings and thoughts on a particular matter and<br/>
strengthen my convictions...whether I agree or not.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise,  early in the TV thread,  I found Bridget&#39;s re-cap of her personal<br/>
experience,  along with the wisdom - you know your children, trust your gut<br/>
(I&#39;m paraphrasing)  to be most beneficial to me.  I think many of us in the<br/>
throes of coping with managing young children need to be reminded of basic<br/>
bits of wisdom from time to time - we probably &#39;know&#39; to trust our gut,  to<br/>
trust our children as they grow and learn....But our perspective and judgeme<br/>
nt get clouded at times in our weariness (Maybe I should only speak for<br/>
myself her -?- ).  I appreciate a voice of experience that says...I&#39;ve<br/>
travelled a similar road before...you will need to find your own<br/>
way....trust your instincts (i.e., if you&#39;re led to unschooling,  you<br/>
probably have a basic belief in yourself and your children).  I think this<br/>
is what Bridget tries to do.....again,  these are my words,  I&#39;m not<br/>
speaking for Bridget!<br/>
<br/>
Overall,  I think we&#39;re fortunate to have both  of you here.<br/>
<br/>
Susan<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;  It appears to me that both of you are putting words in the others<br/>
&gt; mouths. If<br/>
&gt; &gt; you would each take the time to LISTEN to the other, you would<br/>
&gt; discover you<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably are not that far apart on the issue. But instead you take<br/>
&gt; a portion<br/>
&gt; &gt; of something the other said and distort it. No one said you were<br/>
&gt; nuts for<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking the way you do Sandra, and no one said your family was<br/>
&gt; chock full of<br/>
&gt; &gt; badness Bridget. To infer those things from the conversation is<br/>
&gt; paranoid and<br/>
&gt; &gt; looking for something to get upset about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. I&#39;m not upset.<br/>
&gt; 2.  I listen to Sandra.  But I do not and cannot respect the position<br/>
&gt; that if we would all just do things her way, our problems would<br/>
&gt; magically go away.  And as recently as this week she has said nearly<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; 3.  Yes, my family deals with allergies, OCD and depression.  No we<br/>
&gt; are not discordant, unhappy and frustrated.<br/>
&gt; 4.  Perhaps those of us who have faced these problems and learned to<br/>
&gt; deal with them within a framework of respect for individuality have<br/>
&gt; something to offer that others who have not BTDT cannot simply<br/>
&gt; because they have not faced the problems and challenges themselves.<br/>
&gt; 5.  No one has a monopoly on &quot;right&quot;.  I offer examples of how we do<br/>
&gt; things here.  I offer what worked and what didn&#39;t and why.  I do not<br/>
&gt; say that everyone has to do exactly what worked for me because it may<br/>
&gt; not work for the next person.<br/>
&gt; 6.  I resent being called paranoid when I object to my posts being<br/>
&gt; answered in such a way as to suggest that my family is dysfunctional.<br/>
&gt; 7.  We really don&#39;t want to rehash why I feel my family has been<br/>
&gt; seriously maligned here do we?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716141489"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can someone please explain to me why Sandra can say just about<br/>
&gt; anything she wants here, including subtly bashing one&#39;s entire gender<br/>
&gt; with something like, &quot;And it is easy for some parents, especially<br/>
&gt; dads, to expect more of children than they are emotionally and<br/>
&gt; intellectually ready to understand.&quot; and not one of you calls her on<br/>
&gt; it.  Yet when she insults someone to the point where they get nasty<br/>
&gt; back you are right there to jump in and defend her?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dan,<br/>
&gt; I understand your frustration with what has been said and trust me<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dan:  Have to go along with Bridget here....those who&#39;ve hung around have<br/>
witnessed it.  I&#39;ll repeat my thought:  I wonder if Sandra does this on<br/>
purpose?  Maybe to keep things lively?  Her input is often helpful...yet she<br/>
seems to enjoy flaming people....Bridget&#39;s gone through plenty of fire here,<br/>
she must be &#39;made of gold&#39; .</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534523768">The quotes were defense from a huge attack on me, with claims I and others on <br/>
the list considered to be false, which did entirely seem unrelated to <br/>
unschooling or anything else, and seemed, as others had said had happened on <br/>
other lists, to be wholly for the purpose of causing dissent, unrest, <br/>
irritation, etc.  Trouble.  And it was in the midst, as I recall, of some <br/>
discussion of what WOULD be helpful--sharing direct information about our own <br/>
homeschooling experiences, in which case I was pointing out that I have never <br/>
hesitated to tell whole, real stories, but others had declined to give <br/>
details.<br/>

Is that flaming?  It&#39;s defense.<br/>
<br/>
Comments saying &quot;Sandra Sucks&quot; are flames (or paraphrases thereon).  Comments <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652188111">This is sooo funny.  Anyone who knows me knows that I don&#39;t give a dead<br/>
rat&#39;s patotty if folks want to talk about my &quot;personality.&quot;   Hey, be my<br/>
guest, go for it.  I mean, if it came from someone whose opinion I<br/>
respected, I would take a look at what caused them to say what they were<br/>
saying.  Then and only then would it bother me and to date I&#39;m not bothered.<br/>
<br/>
However, folks need to try honesty instead of lies, innuendos and gossip.<br/>
Also, those who participate in or begin such juvenile games should be<br/>
prepared for the fallout.  As in don&#39;t do the whole whiney martyr trip if<br/>
you are guilty of what you accuse others of.  AND, if you are going to say<br/>
something, be prepared to back it up WITH FACTS.<br/>
<br/>
GOSSIP:  &quot;a person who chatters or repeats idle talk or rumors; such talk or<br/>
rumors.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
RUMOR:  &quot;general talk not based on definite knowledge; mere gossip; heresay;<br/>
an unconfirmed report, story or statement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From the Latin rumor, noise!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh really, I&#39;d say that GOSSIP is definately not covered under the<br/>
&quot;issues<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the table category.&quot;  For example &quot;There are tales of you on other<br/>
lists&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now that is very junior high girls sitting around the quad backbiting<br/>
&gt; &gt; gossipy type statement and definately not on topic about unschooling<br/>
issues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;d rather that YOUR personality not be discussed, then perhaps we<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; stop discussing personalities and focus more on issues?  Please.<br/>

North America.<br/>
<br/>
But as it had to do with what I consider social vandalism, blowing things up <br/>
just to do it, with no real benefit except the joy to the vandal and any fans <br/>
thereof, without regard to the harm to others, the phrase was less cute.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Arab&quot; is neither a race nor a religion.  It&#39;s a language group.  As race <br/>
goes (which isn&#39;t far) they&#39;re caucasion. As language goes, it&#39;s an <br/>
Indo-European language, related (not descending from but related) to Sanskrit.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s frustrating to have people misunderstand (or claim to misunderstand) my <br/>
writing here so often.  I would hate to have to tone it down.  <br/>
<br/>
I also object to and regret that the subject is so often getting off of <br/>
unschooling and into personalities.  <br/>
<br/>
I will try to ask the question in another way.<br/>
<br/>
What benefit is there to individuals or small groups if this list is <br/>
disrupted?  Is the purpose of this list to amuse a tiny portion of its <br/>
readership?  What benefit would there be to a small group of two or three <br/>
antagonists if I were to stop writing altogether, or compromise my <br/>
principles, or to start a different list?  <br/>
<br/>
(It&#39;s a hypothetical question; I think there would be only the small benefit <br/>
of them feeling successful in having affected something bigger than <br/>
themselves.  I find that benefit in helping other people unschool.  I&#39;m <br/>
puzzled by those who seem to find their joy in stirring up turmoil for the <br/>
sake of turmoil.)<br/>

&gt; The one time I&#39;ve returned a slur to the list that was sent to me <br/>
offlist, it <br/>
&gt; was presented whole and untouched.  This use of present tense with <br/>
no <br/>

more than <br/>
&gt; once, and without fail, that things are &quot;creatively edited.&quot;  For <br/>
the benefit <br/>
&gt; of anyone reading who might think the quoted statement above is <br/>
valid, I know <br/>
&gt; of not one incident on this list or others in which it has happened.<br/>

If you are, there was NO editing at all. . . I did not want to discuss other <br/>
people offlist, which is what you were doing by emailing me offlist to ask <br/>
questions about Sandra, and I would not dicuss it offlist with you, and said <br/>
so on the list.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it here more than once which prompted my curiousity.  I am <br/>
fascinated by regional differences in the language.  I suspect prolly <br/>
is a local thing but in more than one spot.  Interesting.<br/>
