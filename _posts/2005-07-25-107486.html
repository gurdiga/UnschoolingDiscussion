***************************************<br/>
<br/>
Dating is &quot;the&quot; topic this past week/season in fact it caused a quite a  stir <br/>
in our homeschool group.. <br/>
I have been talking with my son about other families and girls homeschooled  <br/>
and not. Girls and boys who seek to rebel against their controlling parents  <br/>
and families by using my son...<br/>
 <br/>
Seems a 13 yr old (mine) cannot *plan* a movie bc the other parents say  <br/>
&quot;Children are not to plan events adults do&quot;.........<br/>
In the end the movie was canceled only to reappear the following day masked  <br/>
as the same event hidden from manipulating parents who&#39;s children learned from <br/>
 the best. Them!<br/>
 <br/>
How can I.. as a parent who respects my children stand strong  for 17 more <br/>
years (my youngest is 1) with puppet parenting all around  me? I try to lead by <br/>
example but I feel like it is rubbing off on me in a way  that is causing me <br/>
to be frustrated.. <br/>

group (including the adults) to do?  Plan events for themselves that are<br/>
activities that are reserved for adults?  I&#39;m confused.<br/>

Sorry for the delay. <br/>
 The whole situation just makes me tired. Lacking others around me  that <br/>
allow their children to be who they are and be happy with friends. My son  has a <br/>
good amount of friends but this one situation (the closest homeschool one  to <br/>
us) has me a bit stressed over the hurt feelings he has endured. The clicks  <br/>
that form between certain parents with religious beliefs/control/forced  <br/>
thinking. The phone calls,private meets and gatherings to discuss other  families. <br/>
It&#39;s been a year now and I am just now seeing what&#39;s been taking place  and I <br/>
don&#39;t like it. That&#39;s what is rubbing off on me or rather rubbing me  across the <br/>
grain...<br/>

<br/>
One of the things that I do is avoid having school/teaching conversations or<br/>
&quot;how to get them to...&quot; conversations with any of the mothers in my local RL<br/>
groups. Actually I am fortunate because there is such a wide variety of<br/>
personalities and other interests in the groups that conversation rarely<br/>
flags - nor do I think so highly of myself that I believe anyone would miss<br/>
my opinion about any of their schooling or parenting choices. <br/>
<br/>
It is a very odd thing, a kind of blindness, in gossipers that they somehow<br/>
believe that they will be spared the same treatment that they are dishing<br/>
out to others. <br/>
<br/>
However how to counteract it? The first thing that would probably be<br/>
suggested is to find a different group. The second thing would be create<br/>
your own. <br/>
<br/>
I belong to two RL groups - one a general *secular inclusive* group. The<br/>
guidelines for the group are pretty enlightened in expression. However I<br/>
don&#39;t see it as being a place for Unschooling support and thinking - that I<br/>
get mostly online. In the last 4.5 years that the group has been in<br/>
existence, and we now have over 70 families I think, there have been very<br/>
few blow ups. The key is a mandate for &quot;at least polite toleration&quot; of<br/>
different belief systems. <br/>
<br/>
Actually the members are mostly fairly clueless about Unschooling, but this<br/>
group is not a discussion forum, but a way to facilitate park days, play<br/>
dates and activities. I have some real friends from that group. There has<br/>
been a lot of thought put in to issues like choosing which park to meet at,<br/>
and how other activities and &quot;field trips&quot; that provide group discounts<br/>
might best be organized (not on Park Day please).<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/djjhp/CWHNmain.htm">http://www.geocities.com/djjhp/CWHNmain.htm</a><br/>
 will take you to the site if you wanted to read the various guidelines of<br/>
the group. <br/>
<br/>
The other group is a newly formed Unschooling/Child led learners group<br/>
created by an Unschooling mom to generate more congenial support, more<br/>
friends for her son, and more regularity of connection. She started simply<br/>
by creating a Yahoo group, publicizing it on all the Unschooling and other<br/>
local (to us) lists, choosing an appropriate park and a day and continuing<br/>
to turn up most of the time. Other ways to find members is to put up flyers<br/>
at libraries and places frequented by people likely open to alternative ways<br/>
of being like food co-ops, or liberal houses of worship, or arts and crafts<br/>
centers or...well I&#39;m sure you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/smwla/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/smwla/</a> for the group description and<br/>
keywords to help people understand that this is a non-curriculum based<br/>
homeschooling play group, with the focus on mindful parenting, not academic<br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
It can be exhausting and energy draining to be around negativity, even if<br/>
you are not an active participant in it. The internal stress generated by<br/>
the attempt to stay acceptant and positive in the face of deeply opposing<br/>
life philosophies to your own can make you grumpy without realizing it. It<br/>
takes strength to excise the negative people from ones life. I&#39;m not very<br/>
good at doing that myself. Good luck with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133772200">Thank you Robyn,<br/>
 <br/>
I agree and do feel as you have written,even more so now.<br/>
I did make one final attempt to help one of the issues the other day.  You <br/>
may remember the dating issue/tattling mom? I called her (my friend of 5  years <br/>
who began homeschooling this year) and asked that she stop bc she was  getting <br/>
the boy in trouble and he was expressing fear of his mom, so much so he  <br/>
stated he was going to sleep in his closet. Yelling or whatever the mom was  doing <br/>
to the boy the tattling mom was the catapult and I was trying to  settle <br/>
things down. (I say that because I don&#39;t know enough to say either  way)<br/>
 <br/>
I asked her,a normally kind-hearted religious woman, &quot;so you know  that he is <br/>
getting in trouble so much so he&#39;s going to hide in his  closet, your still <br/>
going to call because the word *kill* isn&#39;t allowed in  your home?&quot;  &quot;Yes, <br/>
absolutely that word is banned in my home&quot;, she said.  (The boy jokingly said he <br/>
was going to kill *my son* to stir up her son because  a girl her son liked <br/>
showed up at the movies with my son.) She knew it was  a joke and said so days <br/>
ago but she still called the mom to cause trouble.. <br/>
 <br/>
Needless to say, frustrated by her attempts to play blonde and her pushing  <br/>
her right to cause trouble, I hung up on her. An hour later she called me  to <br/>
tell me she had called the boys mom (our list owner)and  said &quot;hi, Just  want <br/>
your to know they are all alive and safe and (moms name here) wants you to  <br/>
know they are all fine! WHAT! I said.<br/>
 <br/>
I could not believe this woman who has been my friend for 5 years just made  <br/>
that call to someone she&#39;s know for less than a year, that I introduced her <br/>
to,  to make me look bad by making my call to her look bigger than it was. Now I <br/>
 doubt there is an abuse issue but what bad parent is going to admit that <br/>
when  asked? And If he was she very well may have gotten the boy in more trouble  <br/>
for telling another kid............ Two days later he doesn&#39;t answer my sons  <br/>
calls and has not been online so he is prob banned from speaking to him who  <br/>
knows?<br/>
 <br/>
So that being the final straw I am walking away to breath. Im not sure Id  <br/>
want to start my own group especially after this however I do have a  <br/>
unschooling group online with 40+ that is slow but full of nice people( current  group <br/>
above has 10). We did meet up with a mom I met at the convention last  year so <br/>
we have begun to move away from the group situation. <br/>
