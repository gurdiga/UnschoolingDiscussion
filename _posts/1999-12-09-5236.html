&gt;Nice to see you here too! What&#39;s a &quot;hidden Mickey?&quot;<br/>

they define Hidden Mickeys as:<br/>
Hidden Mickeys are images of Mickey Mouse incorporated in the design of some of<br/>
the attractions and resorts on Walt Disney World property.* Usually the image <br/>
consists of a head and ears.* Other images include profiles of Mickey Mouse&#39;s <br/>
head with a pronounced nose and ears set in back. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hidden Mickeys&quot;, began as an inside joke by Walt Disney &quot;Imagineers&quot;.* <br/>
&quot;Imagineers&quot; today continue to add &quot;Hidden Mickeys&quot; when<br/>
designing, constructing, or adding the finishing touches to an attraction or <br/>
resort area.* Although there is no official tracking of every &quot;Hidden Mickey&quot; <br/>
on Walt Disney World property, on the pages to follow you will find a list of <br/>
most of the &quot;Hidden Mickeys&quot; until today. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That website address also has a full list of all reported Hidden Mickeys on<br/>
property.  Some of the more well known ones include in Splash Mountain, <br/>
there&#39;s one part that if you look up at the clouds, they&#39;re shaped like <br/>
Mickey.  In Great Movie Ride (Disney-MGM Studios), in the gangster scene, <br/>
you look up at the top windows of one of the warehouse buildings, and there&#39;s <br/>
a silhouette of Mickey&#39;s head. It&#39;s a lot of fun, especially for those of us <br/>
who have been to Disney a million times...  I printed them out and put them in<br/>
a binder that we bring with us sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great for honing their observation skills, and we all get so excited<br/>
when we find a new one!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
