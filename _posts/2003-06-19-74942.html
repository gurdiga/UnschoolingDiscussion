 </span></blockquote>Ahhhh, Mary, Karma is a wonderful thing. Also known as Universal Law, for <br/>
every action there is an equal and/or opposite reaction or in simpler terms, <br/>
whatever one puts out, one receives back. In very simple terms: Be kind, receive <br/>
kindness, share knowledge, receive knowledge, be cruel & expect cruelty. So, <br/>
although it is based in the Laws of the Universe, the choice is yours as to what <br/>
you send out and what you will automatically be returned based on that <br/>
initial choice. The only problem being that not all actions and subsequent reactions <br/>
necessarily occur within the same lifetime.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want to know more, just ask. Just remember, there are many points of <br/>
view.<br/>
