<div id="ygrps-yiv-760658655">&quot;But &quot;natural&quot; in of itself conjures up the idea that no outside<br/>
 influences <br/>
were needed to produce the resulting behaviour or in this case <br/>
reading.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Um...why would the term &quot;natural&quot; equal NO outside influences?<br/>
That is a strange conclusion to draw from someone saying reading <br/>
happens<br/>
 naturally.<br/>
<br/>
I am honestly baffled by unschoolers that are arguing against the <br/>
fact that<br/>
 reading is a natural process...I wonder how long they&#39;ve been <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Natural does not mean learning happens in a vacuum. It means human <br/>
are naturally<br/>
 adaptable and have a STRONG desire to learn what is around them. It <br/>
is natural<br/>
 for caregivers of a child to show and assist and be generally <br/>
nurturing in most<br/>
 societies. The innate ability to learn means most all things that a <br/>
child is<br/>
 surrounded by will be naturally picked up.<br/>
<br/>
One of the many definitions of &quot;natural&quot; in my dictionary is:<br/>
Pertaining to or resulting from INHERENT nature.<br/>
<br/>
It is inherent for human beings to learn. If we accept that, then <br/>
saying reading<br/>
 will happen naturally in an unschooling environment saying reading <br/>
is natural.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps those that are coming up with off the wall exceptions to <br/>
natural<br/>
 reading, could just accept that for the purposes of unschooling <br/>
discussion, we<br/>
 all agree that we&#39;re talking about &quot;natural&quot; in relation to<br/>
 unschooling! <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe it has to be explained that natural learning does not <br/>
happen in<br/>
 the absence of learning materials. That&#39;s a big &quot;doh&quot; for everyone at<br/>
 this list. We all KNOW that learning can&#39;t happen in a void. But <br/>
then, even a<br/>
 child left in the wild, with wolves is learning....just not the <br/>
things that our<br/>
 culture would value.<br/>
<br/>
NO outside influences? How is that even possible?<br/>

This is the Unschooling-Disgusting List (see, I don&#39;t NEED <br/>
&quot;Unschoolingdotcomedy&quot;! &lt;G&gt;), NOT  AlwaysLearning---not everyone here &quot;gets&quot; it---so there WILL <br/>
be these questions and concerns! Very few &quot;doh&quot;s here---there are MANY that <br/>
don&#39;t know about learning ! Our job is to get them AWAY from that saying into <br/>
&quot;doh&quot;! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
You have NO idea Kelly...that NAME!! Bwaaahhahahahahahaaaaa<br/>
<br/>
I do understand that there will be many questions about philosophy <br/>
and practice...bring it on! I welcome honest seeking.<br/>
But do you really think anyone would be researching unschooling <br/>
without the knowledge that learning needs materials, interest, <br/>
PEOPLE?? I can&#39;t even fathom anyone believing THAT! And yet, some of <br/>
the arguement about &quot;Natural learning&quot; seems to suggest that natural <br/>
means MAGIC. Wham, bam, it&#39;s in the brain. NO exposure to ideas, no <br/>
dialogue, no presence necessary. <br/>
<br/>
Natural doesn&#39;t equal &quot;happening without input&quot; it means that it <br/>
unfolds without outside forces pushing. Without coercion. It happens <br/>
because the learner wants the learning and has materials available to <br/>
get what they need.<br/>

&quot;You cannot teach a man anything, you can only help him to find it <br/>
within himself.&quot;</div>

because someone calls themselves an unschooler doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re using<br/>
the word the same as other people who call themselves unschoolers.<br/>

unschooling groups, and you guys are not the most &quot;radical&quot; bunch <br/>

<br/>
This group is fond of saying things like &quot;you can&#39;t say you&#39;re <br/>
unschooling except for math&quot;, which is all good and well--but then <br/>
there are other groups which will take that one step further and <br/>
say &quot;you can&#39;t say you&#39;re unschooling except for religion&quot;, meaning, <br/>
you can&#39;t say that you are truly allowing your children complete <br/>

indeed coerce their children in one way or another when it comes to <br/>
religious matters. Somebody posted earlier the Holt dictum of &quot;if <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I think this assumption certainly needs questioning.  I have been on<br/>
this list off and on for several years.  Seems to me that most of the<br/>
time when that topic arises, unschooling families do indeed, more often<br/>
than not, &quot;unschool&quot; areas of faith.  <br/>
<br/>
I am Catholic.  I attend services regularly,  but my husband chooses not<br/>
to.  My children attend with me occasionally, but often do not,  They<br/>
choose certain functions to attend or not.  They are in no way coerced<br/>
into believing anything.  <br/>
<br/>
I also share stories and viewpoints of other faiths.  They will choose<br/>
their path and I chose mine.  What they see in my example is part of<br/>
their experience.  I value my choices and I value their choices and<br/>
insight in faith matters.<br/>
<br/>
We have had a lot of this in the past year as we faced the deaths of<br/>
both my parents as well as the loss of a pregnancy.  I remember Dar<br/>
writing about some things she and her daughter discussed when death<br/>
issues arose in her experience.  She is not Catholic,  but I think we<br/>
had similar discussions and approaches with our children about death and<br/>
afterlife and faith.<br/>
<br/>
There are practical matters,  like Sandra mentioned.....her children<br/>
went to SCA when they were too young to have a viable option.  When they<br/>
had a viable option,  they had a choice. <br/>
<br/>
If one doesn&#39;t think shoving math or science or history into a child is<br/>
possible,  why would they do that with religion? <br/>

<br/>
&gt; Well, if the child is coerced to participate in the family&#39;s chosen<br/>
&gt; passion through the use of rewards and/or punishments, then yes,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s indoctrination.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to disappoint your low expectations of our Radicalness ;) but I<br/>
don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to find a lot of argument on this list that<br/>
&quot;Unschooling except for religion&quot; is unschooling, any more than &quot;Unschooling<br/>
except for math&quot; is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I understand what you are saying here, but we both know the reality<br/>
&gt; of the situation is that many religious &quot;unschooling&quot; families do<br/>
&gt; indeed coerce their children in one way or another when it comes to<br/>
&gt; religious matters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many who claim to be unschooling coerce their children in all sorts of<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; and &quot;non-educational&quot; areas. I don&#39;t think that was in<br/>
dispute. The original claim (unless I&#39;ve got my posts muddled, quite<br/>
possible) is that the occupants of this list aren&#39;t as radical as some<br/>
unschooling list, and then the religion factor was thrown in to illustrate<br/>
this argument, as a point of proof.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem to illustrate anything, though, about the general posting<br/>
population of this list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Somebody posted earlier the Holt dictum of &quot;if<br/>

&gt; Commandments or the Five Pillars before the children are mature<br/>
&gt; enough to seriously wonder about morality laws for themselves?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To sound like BC, it depends on what your definition of &quot;teach&quot; is. If it&#39;s<br/>
enforced, tested, plotted out, etc., it&#39;s not unschooling. If it&#39;s under the<br/>
same general style as me &quot;teaching&quot; my daughters to cook (i.e, cooking with<br/>
them as they express an interest in doing so) it&#39;s still unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I breed rabbits. I&#39;ve mentioned that a few thousand times in the past few<br/>
days, I know. Sorry. My point here is that in a household where the parents<br/>
are animal-rights activists, breeding cute show bunnies is going to get an<br/>
entirely different slant from the parents than it is in this household. It<br/>
is impossible (and a bad idea) to try to hide our beliefs and ideals from<br/>
our children. There is a large difference between living my life as I see<br/>
fit vs. forcing my children to my every viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Other<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I am not finding the posters in this discussion, or on this list, who<br/>
do this. And when someone says they DO do this, it&#39;s cause for quite a<br/>
debate here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From my atheistic viewpoint, I don&#39;t think there should be a<br/>

list. That was the point originally.<br/>

<br/>
I think it is more likely that Alex will grow up pagan, rather than <br/>
Christian, even tho he&#39;s got a bible in his room, and I have one on my shelf, just from <br/>
that &#39;indoctoration&quot; I&#39;m going to know more about pagan ideas than any <br/>
others, he&#39;s gonna be more familiar with that.  I hope that won&#39;t influence his <br/>
available choices when he tries to find the spiritual path/s that&#39;s best for him.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But teaching something as truth, when it&#39;s not, is where I hit the wall, and <br/>
altho I try very hard to not judge families who do that, I have a definite <br/>
problem with it.  Some family members in particular.  That kid is going to grow <br/>
up and find out that what&#39;s been taught to him is not a universal truth, like <br/>
he&#39;s being led to believe, but instead, his parents&#39; personal, spiritual truth. <br/>
 It&#39;s just not intellectually honest.  <br/>

<br/>
I think it depends.  Some  parents don&#39;t really enjoy reading, or <br/>
don&#39;t really enjoy reading certain types of books but feel guilty <br/>
about it because society says that books are good for kids.  So they <br/>
have books sitting around anyway because they hope their kids will <br/>
pick them up and read them.  I used to be guilty of doing that with <br/>
certain kinds of children&#39;s picture books.  I didn&#39;t buy them because <br/>
I thought my kids would like them or because I liked them, but <br/>
because I thought I had to get my kids to like them because they were <br/>
good for them.  That is a kind of coercion.<br/>
<br/>
  But if parents have books around because they delight in reading <br/>
good books and even buy special books that they think would delight <br/>
their kids, and then their kids pick up on the idea that books are <br/>
fun things, then it&#39;s just kids picking things up naturally from <br/>
their environment.  <br/>

read &quot;possibly&quot; instead of &quot;probably.&quot; And while &quot;probably&quot; is a qualified <br/>
statement in that it can go either way, it does take on the meaning of something <br/>
being more likely than not. So maybe I read &quot;possibly&quot; instead, because I <br/>
didn&#39;t see the correlation between late reading and road blocks to getting there <br/>
as &quot;probable,&quot; but indeed, &quot;possible.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
       I think this is why it&#39;s so good to be aware that, yes, most kids want <br/>
to please their parents, and so I think you must be very clear with yourself <br/>
about expectations, and be very clear with your kids that you support them <br/>
even if their ideas, and interests are not similar to your own. <br/>
<br/>
        I don&#39;t think it happens too often where the kids are just radically <br/>
different than the parents....I think of Alex Keaton on Family Ties, lol.  <br/>
Those flower children having a dyed in the wool capitalist Republican, I know <br/>
that&#39;s fiction, but they were good at supporting him even tho they disagreed with <br/>
him.  <br/>
<br/>
      I think unschooling allows, sometimes even triggers, constant <br/>
questioning, and that kind of discernment happens so early, and so often, that it&#39;s not <br/>
a shock at teenagerhood.  That&#39;s my working theory so far, btw, my son is  9. <br/>
 But I&#39;ve always seen adolescence as a chemical independence, it&#39;s almost <br/>
like the body is forcing the division between parent and child.  But for an <br/>
unschooler, for example, that&#39;s not a shock, it&#39;s just another process and stage, <br/>
and it&#39;s one they are well prepared to handle.  <br/>
<br/>
       I think my 9 year old right now is going thru one of those stages now, <br/>
a dry run of independence, a rehearsal if you will.  Most parents would try <br/>
to squash it because it seems disrespectful or just plain too early, but if I <br/>
expect him to be independent when he&#39;s grown up, I can&#39;t squash this stage.  <br/>
Duh.  It&#39;s part of the process he&#39;s been going thru his whole life. <br/>

Hard to say true/not true about a qualified statement like<br/>
 &quot;probably.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. What I SHOULD have said was &quot;not always true&quot;. It sounded like the person thought if a child didn&#39;t read naturally by 14, it was due to negative pressures. Which can happen.<br/>
So I should have said &quot;not always the case&quot; instead of &quot;not true&quot;.<br/>
