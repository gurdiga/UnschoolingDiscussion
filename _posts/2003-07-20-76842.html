<div id="ygrps-yiv-941575847">&lt;&lt;Do you want your child to do what you ask because they fear your response <br/>
if they don&#39;t?&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In an emergency situation, when he is going to be at high risk otherwise, <br/>
YES.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that is a BIG mistake!!  I started very young fearing my mom and my dad. <br/>
To get me to listen or for safety issues, a good beating was my lesson. Didn&#39;t <br/>
teach me shit though. I still fear mom till this day which is why I&#39;m having <br/>
a hard time breaking ties.<br/>
<br/>
When our son was in school, I was the same way with him. He was the best <br/>
behaved kid in town, straight A student, teachers pet and so on. Part of that is <br/>
because he&#39;s a great kid BUT a lot of that was because he feared me and what <br/>
stupid harsh punishment I would hand out if he were to behave otherwise. I never <br/>
spanked him but I did swat him on the butt once when he was 5 and he still <br/>
remembers that!<br/>
<br/>
Along with school and us, we did a lot of damage to our son and since we have <br/>
changed we have learned just how much he couldn&#39;t stand the way we were and <br/>
the things we did. We have been dealing with all kinds of emotions from anger <br/>
to depression to resentment, you name it and he is doing so much better and we <br/>
have this awesome relationship but that is only because we have changed. <br/>
Please don&#39;t for a minute think that fear of a parent is good for a child in any <br/>
situation.<br/>
