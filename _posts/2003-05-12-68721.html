<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055198662"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So I&#39;m going to keep reading unschooling stuff but I want to<br/>
&gt; know what do to with her.  Do I say, &quot;well, now you can the books you always<br/>
&gt; wanted to?&quot; &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tell her you&#39;re learning so much about learning right now, that you&#39;ve<br/>
decided to take vacation from the old ways for awhile.  Sure, let her read<br/>
the books she wants.  In a month, you may have a better concept of what you<br/>
do or don&#39;t want to do with her, and you can talk more then.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do I just stop the scope and sequence stuff?  COLD TURKEY?!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure, why not?  If she had pneumonia and was in the hospital, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be hovering around with the scope and sequence, would you?  Let it be for<br/>
awhile.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll still be there if you want to go back to it.<br/>
<br/>
If you just let her choose what to read, decide where she might like to go,<br/>
consider things she might want to try?  What would happen?  What would she<br/>
choose?  Pretend it&#39;s Saturday tomorrow, and the day after, and the day<br/>
after that, too.  Heck, figure it&#39;s Saturday for the next month!  I dare you<br/>
to try and   keep her from learning anything in the next month!  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
