<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795571588">****&lt;We learned our lesson from California. We bitched constantly about<br/>
EVERYTHING<br/>
there, but after we left, we realized how much fun we had---and what we<br/>
really missed. We decided NOT to do that again, and we enjoyed our other<br/>
<br/>
tours SO much more! We seem to REALLY enjoy going back out to California<br/>
<br/>
whenever we can! ****<br/>
<br/>
I know I don&#39;t post very much and most people might not recognize my<br/>
name, but I&#39;m in California!  And we love unschoolers from everywhere to<br/>
visit.<br/>
<br/>
Our corner of CA is beautiful (on the coast almost right in the middle),<br/>
we are near Hearst Castle, Cambria (wonderful artsy town), Big Sur (ok a<br/>
few hours drive), San Luis Obispo, Avila Beach (one of the best kids<br/>
beaches ever), Santa Barbara (for famous people watching), etc...<br/>
<br/>
Just let us know when anyone on this list wants to visit!  I love<br/>
showing off my part of the world.<br/>
