<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805344888">I have been no mail for a while and have not been posting.  I have <br/>
missed the input form this group, as I found I did not have the time <br/>
to peruse the archives.  So I am back, at least temporarily, to see <br/>
if I have time to sort through the email of this very active list.  I <br/>
remember when there was nobody here and I asked why things were so <br/>
quiet, only to discover that I was almost the only member on a brand <br/>
new list.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, we are currently working on projects that I just KNOW <br/>
will find a resonant chord with some of the folks in this online <br/>
community.  Foremost among these is planning a move to Western <br/>
Washington in preperation for the formation of a cohousing ecovillage <br/>
intentional community.  We are currently looking for more members, <br/>
and I will post our call for members in another message, for those of <br/>
you who might be interested or know someone who might be.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I am interested in hearing from those of you in WA <br/>
regarding the legal realities of homeschooling in that state.  Feel <br/>
free to email me privately if you feel the information may be too <br/>
specific to be on topic for the whole list.  I know that the minimum <br/>
required age for addressing schooling in WA is 8yrs and I know that <br/>
anual testing can be left out of your home education program, in <br/>
favor of non-testing based assesment.  I notice that the Wash. <br/>
Homeschooling Association lists many people/organizations which do <br/>
assesments, can anyone tell me about these assesments?  Has anyone <br/>
here done them?  I am also interested in knowing what the qualifying <br/>
course for parents that is recommended is like.  Any other <br/>
information or experience that anyone with knowledge of homeschooling <br/>
in WA wants to share would be great (are you listening David?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>

There are 4 ways to qualify:<br/>
<br/>
1) take a 10 hour qualifying course...these are usually done by local<br/>
&quot;experts&quot; or at community colleges and cost around $100(?)<br/>
<br/>
2) have a certain amount of college credit, about two years worth.<br/>
<br/>
3) have the local school oversee you.<br/>
<br/>
4) something else like #3...I think it&#39;s having permission from the local<br/>
superintendent.<br/>
<br/>
I had a cousin with a teaching license assess my daughter one year. She just<br/>
talked with her, asked her some questions, and signed a paper saying she was<br/>
doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a good idea to contact WHO (Washington Homeschool Organization)<br/>
once you&#39;re there (or, here). They have all the info. Like the 4 ways to<br/>
qualify that&#39;s more specific than &quot;something like #3&quot;. And lists of people<br/>
who will test or assess for a fee. I&#39;d also like to recommend &quot;FLO&quot; for<br/>
testing services.<br/>
