<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219910317">Well! <br/>
I looked at the documentaries on that page once I had the Netflix page up.  <br/>
Some we&#39;ve seen.  One I&#39;d never even heard of, so I ordered it but it will be <br/>
way down the queue.    That&#39;s fine.  <br/>
<br/>
I did look it up online, though, and the reviews are fascinating, and there&#39;s <br/>
even an official site with some images.   A couple of paragraphs from a <br/>
review are below, and the documentary is &quot;Hell House&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
--------. . .George Ratcliffe&#39;s documentary &quot;Hell House&quot; chronicles the <br/>
damnedest thing I&#39;ve seen in ages (pun intended): for the past ten years, the <br/>
Trinity Christian School in Cedar Hill, Texas, has presented &quot;Hell House&quot;, <br/>
literally, a house of horrors tour depicting not the fictitious evils of witches and <br/>
zombies, but the very real &quot;sins&quot; of drugs, AIDS, suicide, abortion, incest, <br/>
and school violence (Trinity&#39;s graphic Columbine scene drew record crowds in <br/>
1999).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Focusing on last year&#39;s &quot;Hell House X&quot;, Ratcliffe presents a remarkably fair <br/>
look at the event&#39;s conceptualization, rehearsal, construction, and eventual <br/>
October 31 presentation, complete with the usual backstage technical gaffes (a <br/>
Star Of David mistakenly drawn for a Pentagram) and mixed response from an <br/>
audience that is not always willing to echo the performers&#39; rather rigid <br/>
sentiment. Subplots focus on specific participants, most memorably, a &quot;stage father&quot;, <br/>
single after his wife has left him for a chatroom lover, who lovingly dotes on <br/>
his children and even allows his personal trauma as a basis for one of the <br/>
sketches. One gets a sense that &quot;Hell House&quot; is as much a cathartic release for <br/>
Cedar Hill&#39;s teens (many are eager to participate in the Rave rape sketch, if <br/>
for no other reason than to &quot;get to dance&quot;), as it is a pageant of some rather <br/>
hysterical spiritual parables.<br/>
