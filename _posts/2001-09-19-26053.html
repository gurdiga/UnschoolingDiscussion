<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318599088">Thank you all so much for the input you gave me on my client&#39;s e-<br/>
mail.  As I&#39;m a coach I decided to digest and think about it for a <br/>
while.  Underneath is the e-mail I finally sent to her.<br/>
<br/>
You sound angry and defensive in your e-mail about the choices you <br/>
are making for your child.  I&#39;m wondering if you were telling me this <br/>
for a reason?  Did you need some coaching around this subject? <br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you need from me.<br/>
