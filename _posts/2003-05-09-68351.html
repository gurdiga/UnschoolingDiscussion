<div id="ygrps-yiv-494005929">**One problem.  We&#39;d have to take out a second loan just to fill the<br/>
shelves! **<br/>
<br/>
Is that where all my money went?  Darn it!<br/>
<br/>
The website www.booksales-in-america will point you to some of the<br/>
cheapest books that can be found anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Our library has a bag sale this weekend, $5 for a bag of books.  Some<br/>
sales, towards the end, let you select a grocery bag of books for $2.<br/>
<br/>
So -- no excuses! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
