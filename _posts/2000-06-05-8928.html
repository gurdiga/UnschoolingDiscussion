<div id="ygrps-yiv-447721366">Hello Nance, Amy, Bonnie, Sue, Cindy, and others! I enjoy just hearing that<br/>
you are out there, living your lives in a similar way, so I can get ideas<br/>
or just say &quot;that sounds neat&quot; or &quot;me too.&quot;  I forgot to get specific<br/>
earlier, so here are some things I want to know your thoughts on: <br/>
What&#39;s your approach to reading? My daughter is almost 6 and has been on<br/>
the verge of reading for awhile without really taking off yet. Do you just<br/>
read to them until they figure it out? Do you talk about some of the sounds<br/>
letters make or ignore phonics completely? Have regular reading practice<br/>
where I listen to her and tell her the words or never ask her to read<br/>
unless it&#39;s her idea? Cindy, it sounds like you have a very advanced<br/>
reader, what are Ruth Beechick books and BOB books? I don&#39;t mean to sound<br/>
like I&#39;m rushing it, but there&#39;s so much she can explore on her own when<br/>
she can read.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have some thoughts on unschooling music or giving music<br/>
lessons? My daughter has expressed interest in playing the piano and my<br/>
sister, my mother, and I can all play and so there&#39;s plenty of free<br/>
teachers, but I want her to love music too, so I&#39;m uncertain about lessons<br/>
(I took lessons until about age 10, then hated having to practice). I&#39;ve<br/>
read that playing an instrument is beneficial in both emotional and<br/>
intellectual ways, but I also read that a lot of the best musicians are<br/>
self-taught.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input!<br/>
Becky in AR</div>
