In a few weeks I hope to have some photos added there, but when I was  <br/>
out looking for links I found some interesting things, including it  <br/>
being on a menu in New Zealand! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s one from someone who didn&#39;t remember where she saw the idea,  <br/>
and there&#39;s a photo and all.  Maybe I misunderstand a little, but it  <br/>
seems there&#39;s a &quot;clean your monkey platter&quot; policy of sorts, and a  <br/>
statement that the vegetables are always the last thing left.  That  <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen here.   Still it&#39;s a positive mention and there&#39;s a  <br/>
list of ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810573325">Your idea has spread far and wide :)<br/>
<br/>
On our local list, we were just discussing this and came up with a <br/>
list of foods to try.  Maybe people can find some new ideas if they <br/>
are in a rut...<br/>
<br/>
mini carrots, <br/>
celery &quot;smiles&quot; (stalk celery cut across the strings small enough for <br/>
a bite)-sometimes plain, sometimes with peanut butter or cream <br/>
cheese, <br/>
bell pepper slices/chunks, <br/>
small mushrooms or big ones sliced, <br/>
cherry or grape tomatoes,<br/>
grapes, <br/>
melon cubes, <br/>
cheese cubes or sticks (just got the idea the other day to use tiny<br/>
cookie cutters to make shapes like the expensive &quot;brand name&quot; in the <br/>
dairy section!), <br/>
string cheese,<br/>
cubed balogna, ham, or turkey-or sliced and rolled up into bite-size <br/>
portions with a toothpick in to keep it rolled, <br/>
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches cut up into about 1&quot; squares, <br/>
nuts, <br/>
banana slices, <br/>
trail mix, <br/>
raisins, <br/>
dried cranberries,<br/>

frozen peas, <br/>
frozen green beans, <br/>
frozen blueberries, <br/>
cooked potato or sweet potato cubes, <br/>
cooked brussels sprout quarters, <br/>
broccoli<br/>
cauliflower florets-cooked or raw, <br/>
&quot;cheerio&quot; kind of cereal (I suppose &quot;chex&quot; kinds would work, too), <br/>
rice cake pieces-plain or with peanut butter, <br/>
plain popcorn (or salted), <br/>
bread cubes, <br/>
tofu cubes, <br/>
chicken (unbreaded chunks or &quot;nuggets&quot;), <br/>
salmon, <br/>
seeds (like sunflower-though they &quot;can&quot; be messy), <br/>
pickles (sweet or dill), <br/>
olives (green or black), <br/>
hard boiled egg, <br/>
wax beans, <br/>
pinapple pieces, <br/>
cucumber slices, <br/>
whole wheat crackers (triscuits are a favorite, here!), <br/>
tofu hot dogs-sometimes sliced, sometimes whole, <br/>
pretzles,<br/>
Applesauce, peanutbutter, blackstrap molasses, cream cheese, sour <br/>
cream, plain or flavored yogurt and/or chip dip for dipping. <br/>
fruit leather,<br/>
freeze-dried fruit,<br/>
freeze-dried veggies,<br/>
chocolate covered sunflower seeds,<br/>
Sunchips,<br/>
flax chips (TJ&#39;s),<br/>

rolls,<br/>

tiny mt. balls,<br/>
veggie burger pieces,<br/>
edamame,<br/>
mini pizza slices,<br/>

If I put this list on the monkey platters page, how should I credit  <br/>
it?  &quot;Kiersten&#39;s Local List&quot;?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a great list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-mini bagels w/ cream cheese,-=<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby and Marty were little I would get unsliced bagels and slice  <br/>
them the &quot;wrong&quot; direction, in little slices, so that there were  <br/>
several matching sandwich sets of little pieces of bagel about the  <br/>
size of a fifty-cent piece, and make cream cheese sandwiches with  <br/>
those.  And I&#39;d just keep slicing and so there would be different  <br/>
shapes and sizes, but the best ones were those very round ones across  <br/>
the middle from each other.<br/>
<br/>
I never thought of slicing corn on the cob in that same way.   Cool  <br/>
(but potentially dangerous for the person doing the cutting) idea.   <br/>
&quot;Corn wheels.&quot;   Cool.<br/>

I don&#39;t know what &quot;strata squares&quot; are, either.<br/>
Hmmm... We need photos!   (Hint, hint...)<br/>

Mt. balls was supposed to mean meat balls (I was a waitress and that was our abbreviation)<br/>
<br/>
Strata is made from old bread.  You cube it and throw it in a casserole dish, layered with cheese and veggies. Then you pour a mix of eggs and milk over the top.  Refrigerate overnight, then bake in the morning.  When cool, it can be cut into squares and picked up.<br/>
I didn&#39;t know it was so obscure- I try to make it when our bread gets old and hard to cut.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, on the frozen veggies being still frozen. My daughter likes the corn and peas that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85973223">I looked through the monkey platter idea list.. I saw breaded popcorn shrimp, my son likes to put cocktail shrimp in his monkey platters.. with some cocktail sauce. <br/>
<br/>
My boys like dipping their finger foods in sauces. So, sometimes we use one muffin tray for the food platter and another for the sauces to go in.. and we use a variety of stuff.. dipping chocolate, caramel, dressings, lemon juice, homemade bean dip or salsa, fruit sauces, yogurt and stuff like shredded coconut or chopped nuts for double dipping. :) And the boys like poking some of the foods with toothpicks to do the dipping process.<br/>

This goes against the &quot;it will be really clean&quot; theory of the  <br/>

I recently read on an email list, to which I belong, that you had laid  <br/>
claim to the term �monkey platter�; that it was your invention.  In  <br/>
reading your blog and website, I find that you can�t possibly have  <br/>
�invented� that term as my grandmother used that term from the time we  <br/>
were all small and she�s 93.<br/>
<br/>
Further consideration to this would also be the fact that people who  <br/>
have no clue who you are, don�t home school their children or are  <br/>
grandparents raising their displaced grandchildren also use this term.<br/>
<br/>
BTW�Do you hold the copyright to that term?  I would imagine that, if  <br/>
you�re going to demand that people give you credit for a term you  <br/>
didn�t invent, you may want to consider it.<br/>
<br/>
I am also a long-time member of the SCA.  I find that an insane amount  <br/>
of people there take themselves entirely too seriously.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ll spare you all her name and give her that much dignity, but does  <br/>
anyone know what list this is that got her so worked up?  Here&#39;s my  <br/>

Not particularly worked up or stressed out.  It had been shared with  <br/>
our group that you had apparently googled monkey platter and had asked  <br/>
one of the members of the group to give you credit either on her site  <br/>
or her blog for using the term, since you had essentially �coined� it.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that this is a term that�s been around longer than either  <br/>
one of us has been alive.<br/>
<br/>
I don�t require an audience with you to vent.<br/>
  -------------------------<br/>
(only the name removed, and my response below:)<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
You did choose to write and express yourself, though, and that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
I think the only blog I left a comment on (and it wasn&#39;t any kind of  <br/>
request or demand for anything) was someone who said she&#39;s read it on  <br/>
the internet but didn&#39;t remember where.  Most of the others I found  <br/>
had my link because they knew they got it from me, and they said so.   <br/>
The one on which I left the comment was found from a blog link from  <br/>
one of the people who did get it from me.  So it wasn&#39;t a random find.<br/>
<br/>
The son who was a two or three years old on the day we went to the  <br/>
zoo, and maybe five when I first wrote about monkey platters on the  <br/>
AOL homeschooling forum is 20 now, so it&#39;s not something I first wrote  <br/>
about the other day.   I wasn&#39;t being jealous or possessive; I was  <br/>
thinking &quot;cool!&quot;<br/>

That&#39;s a great list.=-<br/>

I could be wrong, but that&#39;s what popped into my head when I  read those <br/>
words I quoted at the top. Maybe it got confused with the post of  Kiersten&#39;s <br/>
where she said, &quot;Your idea has spread far and wide&quot;-but that was  someone else <br/>
putting the ownership on you, not you claiming it.<br/>

I tend to have an amazing lack of clarity when I rush to  judgement. That&#39;s <br/>
one of the reasons I know to calm down, back off and revisit  when I&#39;m cooler <br/>
when I&#39;ve got a big reaction to something. &quot;Quick-to-anger&quot;  seems to give me <br/>
tunnel vision, somehow! Thank goodness folks on these groups  have helped me to <br/>

Yes, Anika will eat a whole tray full of fruits and veggies if there  <br/>
are enough pretty, frilly toothpicks to decorate it.  Thanks for  <br/>
reminding me.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve called them monkey platters for years.  I think I heard it first  <br/>
from Dan Vilter or maybe Pam Sorooshian on a camp out.  So that is, no  <br/>
doubt a direct line back to you Sandra.  Funny.<br/>
<br/>
One Thanksgiving we were visiting the zoo and the zookeepers had given  <br/>
the animals sort of pinatas full of food that they had to crack open.   <br/>
It was a lot of fun to watch and the animals seemed to enjoy it.  My  <br/>
kids thought that it was funny that the pinatas were full of oranges  <br/>
and apples and carrots instead of candy.   I&#39;ve never tried to make  <br/>
one at home.  Maybe it would be fun. Or we could make one for our  <br/>
guinea pigs.<br/>

<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know Katamari, it&#39;s a game where you roll a sticky ball and pick things up--at first little things, like tacks, paper clips and litter, and then you progress to big things like houses and cows. <br/>
