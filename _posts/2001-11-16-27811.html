<div id="ygrps-yiv-908474740">Hmmm, why is it so hard for some folks to accept that their writing style is<br/>
abrasive and to try to change the &quot;tone&quot; of their writing.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been here before and had the same discussion over and over and over<br/>
again.  It all boils down to how folks present their &quot;thoughts&quot; or &quot;ideas.&quot;<br/>
Do they come across as suggestions or helpful hints or anectodal maybe this<br/>
will help you or as &quot;I know everything&quot; and &quot;my way is the only way and if<br/>
you don&#39;t do it my way you aren&#39;t doing a good job of raising your child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As to who&#39;s been where or how long or earning faith or trust,  that has<br/>
absolutely nothing to do with life experiences.  One can be a self-annointed<br/>
cyber geru for umpteen years and have faith and trust coming out their ears<br/>
and that has little relevance to first hand experience.<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to oft stated *opinions,* they are just that, they are not *facts.*<br/>
Nor does not experiencing something negate the factual basis that someone<br/>
else is basing their statements on.<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets and I can tromp through poison oak until the cows come home and<br/>
never get so much as a minor itch.  I&#39;m not going to tell other folks they<br/>
can&#39;t be getting great ouzy sores from poison oak because we don&#39;t or<br/>
because I might never have personally met anyone who has.<br/>
<br/>
The same applies to part of another discussion--milk.  Who cares if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t bother some folks.  That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t/can&#39;t bother<br/>
others.  But then, I can&#39;t understand why anyone would want to allow their<br/>
children to experiment with drinking a fluid that the government says can<br/>
have up to &quot;x&quot; percentage of puss in it.  The substance that has to be<br/>
pasteurized inorder to kill various bacteria and viruses that cause life<br/>
threatening illnesses.<br/>

Lynda, who will now have to go check her averages since she didn&#39;t know this<br/>
was a game or that we were keeping score.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Can someone please explain to me why Sandra can say just about<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything she wants here, including subtly bashing one&#39;s entire gender<br/>
&gt; &gt; with something like, &quot;And it is easy for some parents, especially<br/>
&gt; &gt; dads, to expect more of children than they are emotionally and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because I&#39;m saying things I have reason to believe are true, I&#39;m not<br/>
saying<br/>
&gt; them to be hateful, and my average stays up because I&#39;m helpful here and<br/>
&gt; other places on the internet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bridget, you or anyone can say anything you want to here, and if people<br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; the urge to defend you, they absolutely can and will.  I&#39;ve spent a few<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; years earning  faith and trust than you have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lots of parents are blissfully or willfully unaware of child development<br/>
&gt; realities.  They expect three year olds to make promises they keep (about<br/>
&gt; things they&#39;re incapable of understanding or performing) and promise them<br/>
&gt; then for not keeping their word.  They take six year old boys to doctors<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; they can&#39;t read, instead of just waiting two or three years until they can<br/>
&gt; (during which time those boys can absolutely learn TONS of stuff from<br/>
books<br/>
&gt; read to them, videos, visits to museums and historic sites,<br/>
hands-on-stuff),<br/>
&gt; but instead the parents WANT a diagnosis of ADHD or dyslexis or something<br/>
&gt; scientific, so they feel like they did the right parental thing.  Moms, as<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; group, seem vastly more in touch with what their kids know and can say and<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; and have been doing than dads, in general, do.  If a mom had no idea if<br/>
her<br/>
&gt; child could tie his shoes or not, it would seem neglect.  Dads, though,<br/>
often<br/>
&gt; ask the kid or other kids whether the youngest needs help with the<br/>
bathroom,<br/>
&gt; or the kids will tell dad who&#39;s needing a high chair or help reading<br/>
&gt; subtitles or whatever.  Some dads are totally up to the moment.  Others<br/>
&gt; choose not to be and few fault them; it&#39;s not their job, in this society.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-Yet when she insults someone to the point where they get nasty<br/>
&gt; back you are right there to jump in and defend her?-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wasn&#39;t trying to be insulting, and if someone gets nasty back to a<br/>
&gt; discussion about federal highways (which, by the way, nobody did except<br/>
you),<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s their doing, not mine.  I want to discuss issues. You want to<br/>
discuss<br/>
&gt; me.  I wish you&#39;d stop.<br/>

Your not taking your own advice. I hear a lot of anger and a little frustration too. <br/>

That&#39;s right, this is just an exchange of opinions and ideas. I suggest that you refrain from reading Sandra&#39;s posts, they aren&#39;t bringing out the best in you :~)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234940162">&quot;I hear a lot of anger.&quot;  Do you hear voices also?  Cause, let me tell ya,<br/>
there wasn&#39;t any anger, so you must be &quot;hearing&quot; things that aren&#39;t there,<br/>
nor was there frustration.  In fact, if you actually knew me you would<br/>
realise that I get a bit of a kick out of the whole &quot;hang around the cyber<br/>
kitchen table&quot; coffee clatch group.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you should follow your own advise because this post is definately<br/>
not bringing out the best in you, or at least, since I don&#39;t know you, I<br/>
hope this can be construed as a &quot;fact&quot; and not just an unfounded opinion on<br/>
my part.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, who rarely gets anger and when she does you will definately know it<br/>
%-}  Trust me &lt;g&gt;  Or ask those who really know me.  There are a couple on<br/>
this list who can vouch for that &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m sorry if I upset you or anyone else! I was sincerely trying to help but I&#39;m obviously not aware of the extent of the animosity here. I&#39;ve only been following this list short time and I don&#39;t really mind that the tone is often combative. I was lurking on the TCS (Taking Children Seriously) list for a while and I found their method of trying to avoid this level of personal discussion more tedious than reading what happens here. I notice that a lot of interesting ideas and opinions surface in these sometimes aggressive dialogues. I didn&#39;t realize at the time I posted my comments that deleting Sandra&#39;s posts would almost be tantamount to leaving the list. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy for me to communicate this way but I thought I was getting better! I guess I&#39;m still a long way from being a peace maker. Again I&#39;m sorry to have attracted such negative attention.<br/>
