<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587400583">OK.  I put the words &quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;neglect&quot; in the google search<br/>
field and got *only* 207 hits.  Most of them seem to be making the point<br/>
that unschooling is NOT neglect.  (OK, I didn&#39;t look much past the first<br/>
page of links.)<br/>
<br/>
The first link that I chose to click from the first page was this, from<br/>
parenting.com, which I was thrilled to see was written by Nancy Wooton. <br/>
(And at the bottom it says &quot;Used by permission of unschooling.com&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
So I didn&#39;t swim very far from home with this search.  But I enjoyed it!<br/>

<br/>
IF you want to go out again, throw in Christian and obedience with <br/>
unschooling and neglect.<br/>
or maybe try child led instad of unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128706194">Well, I hate that word &quot;obedience&quot;, so I defied you &lt;g&gt; and didn&#39;t put<br/>
it in.<br/>
<br/>
Just using &quot;Christian&quot; &quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;neglect&quot;, I got two hits on<br/>
the libertarian unschooling pages first, and then a hit on<br/>
ww.homeschoolchristian.com   that wasn&#39;t as bad as I expected.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s all I found on the page I hit about unschooling.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
exactly what we all would say about unschooling, but it doesn&#39;t condemn<br/>
unschooling and shows some grasp of the idea.<br/>
<br/>
This is from the Learning Styles and Homeschooling styles page:<br/>

**3) What is unschooling or child-led education?<br/>
 Unschooling is where you become a facilitator and your child chooses<br/>
what to learn. You just supply the materials, transportation, etc. This<br/>
can be very<br/>
 frightening to a parent, but it really does work. It doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>
a license for the child to be lazy. The child can be asked to pick goals<br/>
and to reasonably<br/>
 stick to them, and you can coax the child along toward the chosen<br/>
goals. As the 3 R&#39;s don&#39;t take a long time to learn (if you aren&#39;t in<br/>
public school), there is<br/>
 usually more than enough time to study what would normally be rather<br/>
far out things. Not everybody *needs* to study physics, chemistry, and<br/>
rocket science.<br/>
 Your children become more self-reliant more quickly. However, it is not<br/>
for everyone. Look at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/.">http://www.unschooling.com/.</a> --Chuck S. <br/>
 Unschooling is child-directed learning. Parents provide a rich,<br/>
stimulating atmosphere (don&#39;t ALL home educators do that?), then let the<br/>
child find his own<br/>
 path. While most homeschooling parents practice some form of<br/>
delight-directed learning, an unschooler practices solely<br/>
delight-directed learning. If a child<br/>
 doesn&#39;t want to learn something, he doesn&#39;t. If he chooses to learn<br/>
math and reading through Pokemon-trading or Magic:The Gathering cards,<br/>
that&#39;s how he<br/>
 does it. If his only interest is aviation, he&#39;s free to pursue it to<br/>
the exclusion of everything else if he so desires. Unschooling is NOT<br/>
&quot;relaxed homeschooling;&quot;<br/>
 relaxed homeschoolers still direct their children&#39;s learning. It is<br/>
&quot;not-schooling.&quot; The difference between homeschooling and unschooling is<br/>
one of authority --<br/>
 who chooses what your child will be learning? Child-directed =<br/>
unschooling; parent-directed = homeschooling. A Christian who unschools<br/>
must ignore the<br/>
 Biblical commands and examples of parents to teach and disciple, and<br/>
must turn a blind eye to what the Bible says about children. Just as<br/>
homeschoolers cannot<br/>
 in good conscience ignore that which their children WANT to learn,<br/>
neither can they neglect what their children NEED to learn. --Chas. **<br/>
