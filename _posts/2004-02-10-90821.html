<br/>
I want to hear how the kids IN school were &quot;interacting with the arts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AMEN!<br/>
<br/>
I almost posted an anti-ISP story two weeks ago about a friend who was <br/>
in an ISP, but one month they (gasp) didn&#39;t have enough to &quot;report&quot; for <br/>
social studies because they had been doing art class at the museum and <br/>
music lessons anda attended three live music performances that month, <br/>
plus music lessons and practice.  That&#39;s quite some art exposure in the <br/>
home plus in the community.  I know that Fine Arts and Social Studies <br/>
are considered different boxes in school, but shouldn&#39;t &quot;culture&quot; be <br/>
considered part of &quot;social studies&quot;?  It was silly, anyway, that a child <br/>
be expected to learn carefully measured even amounts of every subject <br/>
every month and that the school be anxious that social studies was <br/>
neglected.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider myself an &quot;artist&quot;, I&#39;m pretty much a beginning <br/>
dabbler, but because of my passion for quilting I&#39;ve brought home 47 <br/>
different quilting books from the library in the last year, I tape a <br/>
daily quilting show and view or skim it in the mornings, I babble to my <br/>
family about what I&#39;ve bought that&#39;s new and what I plan to do with it. <br/>
 I ask them for color advice when I can&#39;t decide.  I have projects in <br/>
process hanging on the walls while I think about how to arrange the <br/>
blocks and I have fabrics of all colors pooling and spreading all over <br/>
the house.  My kid may be *overexposed* to this particular art.  All our <br/>
homeschooled friends who visit get exposed to it as well.  I bring <br/>
samples of my work to parkdays and show them off.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my homeschooled friends have their kids in art classes.   Many <br/>
schools have cut art.  I think real life beats out school on the <br/>
&quot;exposure&quot; issue, hands down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653204612">I was having this intellectual exercise with a friend (read screaming<br/>
debate!) and in answering his arguments that most parents aren&#39;t equipped to<br/>
homeschool because, well, people are lazy -sigh- I came up with this basic<br/>
outline of an idea.  I thought I would present it here for some discussion,<br/>
if anyone is interested, in hopes of learning more about the idea and if it<br/>
would work.<br/>
<br/>
So here is the outline:<br/>
<br/>
One of his objections was that there are not enough opportunities for<br/>
children who are not in school to interact with the arts.  Now, I know that<br/>
there are ways, so I wasn&#39;t going to get into arguing a case by case,<br/>
because he would say &quot;Then you are lucky here in Pittsburgh.&quot; or &quot;But that&#39;s<br/>
only for a few kids.&quot; or whatever.  So I said, fine, let&#39;s take my school<br/>
tax money and use it to support--rather than compulsory public<br/>
schools--general public education.  And any &quot;body&quot; who takes that tax money<br/>
has to make an effort to make their service available to school age kids.<br/>
Discount tickets, special advertising, special programs, whatever makes<br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
My theory here is that a percentage of those on the margins parents, the &quot;I<br/>
would homeschool if only...&quot; people would be much more likely to do so when<br/>
they see that their tax dollars will be working for them in this case,<br/>
instead of just going to the schools and pull their kids.  And like any good<br/>
organic movement (-grin-) this would grow.<br/>
<br/>
The schools would get less money, and they would have less kids.  They would<br/>
really be forced by hard tax numbers to try new things--really have to sell<br/>
their schools to the parents.  And less kids in school could mean that the<br/>
ones there actually get a decent experience.<br/>
<br/>
My friend&#39;s one comment on that was, &quot;And then you create a two tiered<br/>
system.  Those in school and those at home.  But I saw we already have a<br/>
classist society and to pretend we don&#39;t is foolish.  Let&#39;s open up the<br/>
options.<br/>

Good for you for sticking your neck out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that I agree with the idea that changing the use of our tax money from school to other organizations geared towards kids would make a difference to the person who says &quot;I would homeschool if only...&quot; Money is only perceived as barrier to options if you allow it to be. People who are not yet ready to homeschool will always find an &quot;if only&quot; reason not to homeschool.<br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;And then you create a two tiered<br/>
system.  Those in school and those at home.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t we a &quot;multi-tiered&quot; system...those in public school, those in private school, those in p/t private school, those in school at home, those that don&#39;t school at home...and just learn.<br/>

statement.<br/>
<br/>
There is almost NO art in schools and what they call art is often just <br/>
awful and as likely to turn children away from art than encourage them.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably the number one best reason to vilify schools - what <br/>
they do to children under the guise of &quot;arts education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes I&#39;m sure there are some inspired art teachers out there - <br/>
especially in the world of drama I think there are some great high <br/>
school drama programs.<br/>
<br/>
But how MANY kids have been discouraged before they ever get a chance <br/>
to develop their artistry? ALMOST all of them. Think about how artistic <br/>
kids are before they go to school? Almost all kids are natural artists. <br/>
Almost all kids see the world AS artists. Then it is drummed out of us <br/>
and we have to struggle HARD to see the world that way again, as <br/>
adults.<br/>
<br/>
Artistry takes time to experiment, to make big huge messes, to take <br/>
risks - to take BIG risks of looking foolish, especially. This is NOT <br/>
allowed in school.<br/>
<br/>
Art is one of the two best reasons to get kids out of school - between <br/>
that what they do to math - those are the two things that can turn me <br/>
into a &quot;school-basher.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Holy Moley, what does he call interacting with the arts? Going to school<br/>
matinee of the visiting Shakespeare company once a semester and joining a<br/>
rowdy crowd of kids who are just glad to be out to see a walked through<br/>
performance? Memories, memories. Perhaps he means the rush the herd through<br/>
the art gallery, looking only at the assigned pictures and fill in the<br/>
blanks on the workbook interaction. Or perhaps he is referring to band<br/>
practice, or standing in line to use the potter�s wheel because that is the<br/>
assignment, or being told to paint pictures of fish today. :P~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, sometimes arguing is futile, but getting him to expand on<br/>
his position and explode his own myths is more helpful. Doesn�t he know that<br/>
music and arts programs are the first to go when budgets get tight?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;So I said, fine, let&#39;s take my school tax money and use it to<br/>
support--rather than  compulsory public schools--general public education.<br/>
And any &quot;body&quot; who takes that tax money has to make an effort to make their<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Firstly this sounds something like vouchers. I think NHEN has a forum<br/>
debating this kind of stuff. Also there is the whole �Should children who<br/>
are in PS ISP�s be counted/labelled as home schoolers or public schoolers�<br/>
issue that was around last year. Public schools are targeting �services� to<br/>
hs�ers with the agenda of pulling them back in and receiving the tax moneys<br/>
based on attendance. Again there are many other forums for that discussion,<br/>
which is so not unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In Califoria there is the private school option for hs�ing. Many parents I<br/>
know get educator discounts at all kinds of places, including bookstores.<br/>
Also parents in my local group arrange field trips (hate the phrase but<br/>
that�s what they are I guess) and by sheer weight of numbers get the school<br/>
group discount. We don�t go on too many of these yet, since historically<br/>
Jayn always wants to leave early, but it must be different for the hosts to<br/>
see such a wide age range in one group, compared to school groups of one<br/>
grade.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think homeschooling is already a growing movement, but I don�t care<br/>
whether it grows or not. I can�t worry about every child in school and<br/>
direct my energies and thoughts towards school system reform. In California<br/>
there is yet another bond issue on the ballot for LA Unified School<br/>
District�s massive building program. If it passes property taxes will<br/>
increase again � part of my rent goes towards that. They haven�t spent all<br/>
the last bond, building and improving school facilities. There are more<br/>
children than spaces supposedly available, yet the kids still head off each<br/>
day, some onto buses to other areas. They talk about increasing the number<br/>
of �seats� and the number of school children is growing. Better minds than<br/>
mine are spending all their time debating these issues. Since we do have<br/>
schools, and if we must have schools in existence, I�d rather they had<br/>
enough money and were good, but Jayn isn�t going regardless of how good they<br/>
are, and I hope she never wants to go.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My friend&#39;s one comment on that was, &quot;And then you create a two tiered<br/>
system.  Those in school and those at home.  But I saw we already have a<br/>
classist society and to pretend we don&#39;t is foolish.  Let&#39;s open up the<br/>
options.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My fear is that accepting tax money closes the options, and leads to more<br/>
requirements. Some of the parents in my group are in charter schools. It<br/>
seems like they have fewer options and must give more (documenting work<br/>
done, keeping up with the curriculums) than the law asks for because of it.<br/>
They have chosen the discounted materials and books over the level of<br/>
freedom available to them in CA. In some ways we have a system with 50 tiers<br/>
� since every State is different.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
UNlike the system of some kids being in public school and others being in <br/>
private schools? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the two-class system of some homeschoolers being chained to the table <br/>
(figuratively) and spanked (literally) if they don&#39;t do their &quot;work&quot; while <br/>
others are eating bon-bons and watching TV?   (I bought Holly an expensive artsy <br/>
little candy bar twenty minutes ago at a book stores.  She didn&#39;t like it and <br/>
brought it home and gave the rest to Kirby, with a glass of milk, delivered to <br/>
where he was playing a war-strategy video game on his computer, sitting in <br/>
his nice swivelling desk chair, in boxer shorts and a t-shirt, at 1:15 p.m. when <br/>
it&#39;s freezing cold outside.)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so it wasn&#39;t bon-bons and nobody&#39;s watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
But as to arts, I was thinking just yesterday about how I NEVER ever want to <br/>
go again to a &quot;school performance&quot; of any dance school or theatre group.  They <br/>
so grate on my nerves.  But Holly likes to go and sit with her playgroup <br/>
friends.  And me?  NO, I&#39;d rather pay $15 each and sit like humans than pay $3 <br/>
each and be herded like cattle, into chutes in order, to sit with our &quot;class&quot; <br/>
(the other homeschoolers) and to be dismissed by class when it&#39;s over.    <br/>
<br/>
Well...  Some families would never take their kids to a play or a musical or <br/>
a concert or a dance recital.   So in those cases, if their kids go on some <br/>
field trips they&#39;ve seen more than they might have otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
But if not performance arts, what?  Art museums?  Art in public places?  <br/>
Pottery for useful purposes as opposed to wild artsy sculpture pottery?  (Because <br/>
we have pottery at our house.)   Graphic arts?  Like giant paintings, or like <br/>
album covers and DVD covers?  Book covers?  (Because we have graphic arts at <br/>
our house and books of and about paintings and etchings and woodcuts and <br/>
watercolors and moving picture art...)<br/>
<br/>
What fear was he trying to express?<br/>

<br/>
I remember having one six-week unit in high school called &quot;humanities.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s when they told us that art and music are related to geography and <br/>
history.<br/>
Up to that moment they hadn&#39;t been. &lt;g&gt;  Honestly.  And he didn&#39;t go into <br/>
science and math, but I could see the minute he said what he&#39;d said that it all <br/>
made sense and that everything was part of everything else.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I probably WAS stoned that day, but still.  Up to that point what was <br/>
science was science because it was IN a science classroom, I had a science book <br/>
open, and a certified teacher of science was watching to make sure we did or <br/>
didn&#39;t do whatever.  (I chopped my to-be-dissected starfish up into little <br/>
bitty pieces, and got in trouble, I remember.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My kid may be *overexposed* to this particular art.  All our <br/>
homeschooled friends who visit get exposed to it as well. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet with just the slightest thought, though, they&#39;ll be aware that if you <br/>
were doing another kind of art you&#39;d still have piles of materials, color <br/>
considerations, exciting new patterns and techniques and partly finished projects <br/>
and favorites and that there are ways for people to learn these things without <br/>
going to a university and getting quilting/oil painting/portrait-in-pastels <br/>
degrees.<br/>
<br/>
I argued once that a kid who was engrossed in WWII history to the seeming <br/>
exclusion of all else was probably going to have NO problem asking the right <br/>
questions about other wars he might wonder about in the future because he was <br/>
already well aware of the effects of technology, ideology, motivation, leadership, <br/>
supply realities, weather, geography, communications, etc.   Different wars, <br/>
same factors, different answers.  <br/>
