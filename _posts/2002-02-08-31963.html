<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254312455">Hi<br/>
Reading this:  As I said in my previous post, many unschooling parents seem<br/>
to have children who don&#39;t struggle with choice.  These children always seem<br/>
to peacefully and wisely make decisions that are in their best interests.<br/>
Limits on television watching and video games come to mind, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder - is everyone entirely honest about this? Are people saying<br/>
that people will always make good choices, left to themselves? Personally I<br/>
find that quite hard to believe...(maybe the country I live in has something<br/>
to do with it)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see anyone as &quot;left to themselves&quot; in an unschooling family.<br/>
I honestly have no problems with the 2 examples given (TV and <br/>
videos), but in some families, my kids choices, and amount of time <br/>
spent, might be considered unacceptable.  The only choices my kids <br/>
make, that I sometimes have problems with, is dealing with other kids <br/>
or their siblings.  They aren&#39;t always kind.  They sometimes hurt <br/>
feelings, and we talk about it, and I usually find, someone <br/>
embarrassed another, or wasn&#39;t playing fair, or was just being grumpy.<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m grumpy and don&#39;t handle it all well, but we ALWAYS come <br/>
back to it later, and we discuss it again, and talk about other ways <br/>
of handling things(even for me) and we forgive ourselves and each <br/>
other for being grumpy, and not making the right choices.<br/>
I do think some people have easy going kids, and make it all sound a <br/>
little unrealistic, esp. when applying it to my life.  My kids have <br/>
lots of energy and lots of passion.  That&#39;s not easy to control for a <br/>
little kid.  It&#39;s not always easy to control for me!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>People make choices based on their experience and on the expectations of<br/>
those dear to them.  Children, a subset of people, will try things that may<br/>
not be good for them, but will ultimately respond to the behavior modeled<br/>
around them (most children; there are doubtless some who will not follow the<br/>
model).  If you watch TV all day, they&#39;ll assume this is OK to do and will<br/>
want to do it too.  If you&#39;re involved in meaning and interesting stuff,<br/>
they&#39;ll want to participate with you in what you&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
Most children won&#39;t choose to sit at a desk, day after day, filling in<br/>
worksheets.  Mine would choose to be outside running around, reading a book,<br/>
creating their own world and games with Legos and other toys, or playing on<br/>
computer or video games.   They do learn from all these things.  Maybe they<br/>
don&#39;t know what year some war ended.  Maybe they don&#39;t know what happened at<br/>
some famous battle, or who invented penicillin.  If it becomes important to<br/>
them to know that, they&#39;ll learn it quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody makes mistakes.  Children, having less experience on which to base<br/>
their decisions, might be expected to make more mistakes; having parents<br/>
close by to model good decision-making is what lets so many of them survive<br/>
