 </span></blockquote>yesterday evening after we got back from trick or treating and I <br/>
walked past my 5 y.o. sitting with her basket of candy at the table <br/>
and noticed that one of the first things she had eaten was the apple <br/>
she got from our next-door neighbor. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love it. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got one for &quot;they&#39;ll never DO anything if you don&#39;t MAKE them.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Casey (9) came back from trick or treating and immediately set out to <br/>
sorting her candy. She sorted them incredibly precisely by exact <br/>
candy type and name, about 40-50 categories. Then she got a piece of <br/>
paper and wrote down each type and the number of each that she had. <br/>
Then she totalled it and announced to us that she had 168 pieces of <br/>
candy. She adjusted that number down as she ate a few.<br/>
<br/>
The next day we were sitting with her candy (we like to just look at <br/>
it sometimes to marvel in its glory ;-)) and we started playing <br/>
around with the sorting again. We did it *my* way, chocolate vs. non-<br/>
chocolate (like there&#39;s any other distinction!), by texture, by <br/>
sweetness, and talked about all the different ways we could <br/>
categorize and count those same pieces of candy. We figured out which <br/>
type of candy was the favorite to distribute and some possible <br/>
reasons why, which had the longest shelf life, and WHY someone would <br/>
want to give a kid a &quot;God Loves You&quot; tract on Halloween.<br/>
<br/>
THEN we ate a piece or two. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

couldn&#39;t have that until the next day because she didn&#39;t want him to eat the<br/>
candy in the late evening.  How frustrating!!  He just got all these<br/>
interesting, colorful little packages all thrown together in a bag and now<br/>
he can&#39;t LOOK at it?!  So, I told her to let him look at the stuff and show<br/>
her what he got, etc.  She reluctantly let him and guess what?  He looked it<br/>
all over...showed everybody...ate HALF of a little candy bar and was done.<br/>
My sister is a very controlling person and she was quite amazed that he<br/>
didn&#39;t eat everything.  I explained to her that he didn&#39;t WANT to eat<br/>
everything...he just wanted to see it!<br/>
Why are some moms so controlling?  I find it sooo frustrating.  With my<br/>
sister, I could just butt in &lt;bg&gt; but with others, I just watch in dismay.<br/>
**********************************<br/>
Why? Well, some people are just jerks, and want to control everything. Most <br/>
people aren&#39;t though. So...why?<br/>
<br/>
Because they&#39;re scared and want to do what they think is best for their kids. <br/>
Candy is bad for kids. It&#39;s important that kids get enough sleep, so they <br/>
have to have a bedtime. There are germs in that. Educating children is something <br/>
professional do. Parents get controlling because they&#39;re afraid if they don&#39;t <br/>
keep things under control, Something Terrible Will Happen.<br/>
<br/>
Face it... you&#39;re presented with this little being who&#39;s all cute and <br/>
vulnerable and you realize that suddenly you&#39;re in the Person-Making Business. That&#39;s <br/>
why we read all the books. How the hell do you make a person????<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, even if you&#39;re in control, Something Terrible STILL might <br/>
happen. And when you let go of control, it really works out okay.<br/>
<br/>
So, try to be patient with those people. I believe it&#39;s much harder to BE <br/>
those people than to be around them. And you can keep helping your sister.<br/>
