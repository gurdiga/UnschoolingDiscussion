<div id="ygrps-yiv-353248789">Dear Linda,<br/>
    In my opinion, math is the easiest subject to unschool.  Try not to<br/>
rely on the drill and kill methods especially if they are in the form of<br/>
worksheets (or Saxon math lessons).  Any child, LD or not, learn more<br/>
and retain more when math is presented in the context of real living.<br/>
There is so much you can do to make math fun and meaningful.<br/>
    If he likes to cook, encourage him to help you half, double, triple,<br/>
etc. recipes for dinner or dessert.  Let him help you figure out the<br/>
different measurements needed.  Let him do the measuring.  Let him<br/>
create the grocery list, cut the coupons, and help you compare prices in<br/>
the grocery.  Have him estimate as you shop the amount of money being<br/>
spent.  By all means, let him play with his food.  Make 3D shapes with<br/>
marshmallows and toothpicks.  Turn a pizza dinner into a fraction<br/>
&quot;lesson.&quot;  Let him help you balance your checkbook and keep track of<br/>
savings account balances.  Does he like to garden?  Wow!  Tons of math<br/>
application in planning and caring for a garden.  Does he have a<br/>
particular hobby or talent he can turn into a business?  Letting him<br/>
create his business plan, borrow money from you to get started, keeping<br/>
track of sales and inventory, advertising.  I could go on and on.  It<br/>
could be as simple as walking the neighborhood dogs to selling<br/>
vegetables grown in his garden.  Do you have any adult friends who use<br/>
math daily in their career?  Set up an apprenticeship or at least some<br/>
regular time for your son to work along side someone who uses math in a<br/>
meaningful way in his/her job.  Does he like to construct?  Legos are a<br/>
great math &quot;activity.&quot;  There is even a website devoted just to &quot;Lego<br/>
gurus.&quot;  Is he an artist?  Tons of math in art and art projects.<br/>
    Make everything a game.  If he doesn&#39;t know his addition or<br/>
multiplication facts, first decide if he really has to  memorize them.<br/>
If you feel he does, practice them through card and dice games.  Marilyn<br/>
Burns has some great math literature books geared to kids such as Math<br/>
for Smarty Pants or I Hate Mathematics.  A small company called Box Cars<br/>
and One Eyed Jacks  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.planet.eon.net/~boxcars/home.htm">http://www.planet.eon.net/~boxcars/home.htm</a>  has<br/>
some really great (and cheap) game books to help reinforce computational<br/>
skills.  And there are tons of board games our there that teach and<br/>
reinforce computational skills, problem solving and logical thinking.<br/>
Check out Turn the TV Off company<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.turnoffthetv.com/profiles/index.htm">http://www.turnoffthetv.com/profiles/index.htm</a> and Mindware for great<br/>
math and strategy games.<br/>
    And don&#39;t be afraid to let him use the calculator.  In the age of<br/>
the printing press, many scholars thought books would hinder imagination<br/>
and in the 1800&#39;s, teachers thought the use of pencils would make<br/>
students lazy.  Some &quot;experts&quot; have the same opinion of calculators but<br/>
let&#39;s be honest.  How many adults do not use a calculator to perform<br/>
tedious or time consuming computations.  LD kids, in particular, gain<br/>
more confidence in mathematics and take more risks in problem solving<br/>
when given an opportunity to use a calculator.<br/>
    I think I am finished now.  If you would like to email me for more<br/>
games you can play and make for free in your own home, feel free to<br/>
email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cdefrancisco@...">cdefrancisco@...</a>.<br/>
I hope this was helpful,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440181667">Although my daughter has never been tested and labeled I&#39;d say she has LD.  <br/>
She struggles with reading, spelling, and math.  She didn&#39;t learn to read <br/>
until age 12.  I just tried to read with her every day and then maybe she <br/>
would want to read with me.  We used the Bob Books and Dr. Suess and other <br/>
easy readers from the library for her reading.  Then finally something <br/>
clicked and she was reading.  She still turns letters around and reads words <br/>
wrong but she can usually get the meaning of something.  We also played some <br/>
of the games from &quot;Games for Reading&quot; for Peggy Kaye.  One favorite for all <br/>
of my kids has been letting them copy words onto index cards from some of <br/>
their favorite books.  Then they rearrange the cards on the floor to make up <br/>
their own sentences.  They love making up nonsense sentences.  When they <br/>
moved on from early readers all of my kids have loved the &quot;Magic Treehouse <br/>
Books&quot;.<br/>
Math is still a huge struggle.  Even though she is of 9th grade age she is <br/>
doing 6th grade level math.  That&#39;s when she does math.  She has a hard time <br/>
remembering something from one day to the next.  It took her over two years <br/>
to get the concepts of fractions and sometimes I still have to explain how <br/>
to convert fractions to whole numbers.  I have really backed off this year <br/>
to a true unschooling approach.  I was so worried about her future and how <br/>
would she ever get into college if she couldn&#39;t do all these things.  Then I <br/>
remembered that the reason I started homeschooling 15 years ago was so that <br/>
my children could learn what they wanted at their own pace.  I trusted my <br/>
older children to learn and they did in their own time.  I have 6 kids and <br/>
three of them have to work very hard to learn something that comes easy to <br/>
most people.  My oldest daughter is in her second year of college and doing <br/>
very well.  She studies very hard to make good grades but it is something <br/>
she is doing because she wants it.<br/>
I&#39;ve spent way too much money on programs and gimmicks that were supposed to <br/>
help my LD child learn some concept.  I don&#39;t think any of them worked.  <br/>
From my own experience I&#39;d say that if a child needs or wants to know <br/>
something they will figure out a way to learn it.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard <br/>
that before but it&#39;s always good to hear it again.  Also, it just takes <br/>
time.  With your love and patience your son will learn the skills that he <br/>
needs for now and the future.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Just wanted to add to my last post, remember, I just started unschooling<br/>
&gt; about a month ago.  :-)<br/>
&gt; Anybody unschooling in PA??  I could use some suggestions on how to work<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; logs to go along with the unschooling.<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
