<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342389607">This is long...<br/>
<br/>
When I began homeschooling in 1990 the VA county we lived in had an active<br/>
support group of about 10 families.  There had been two Christian families<br/>
and one had moved, leaving one in the group.  That had never been a problem.<br/>
When I and another lady (both Christians) met the Christian hs-ing mom, she<br/>
invited us to the group&#39;s meeting.  The first time I went my chldren and I<br/>
enjoyed meeting other homeschoolers (at one of their homes).  The children<br/>
played and I talked with some of the moms.  At noon those who had been in<br/>
the group got out their lunches (we didn&#39;t know to bring anything) and began<br/>
eating.  One lady asked me &quot;Are you a vegeterian?&quot;  When I said no, she<br/>
immediately turned away and didn&#39;t speak again.  The next week we went on a<br/>
hike with the group.  Again, my children and I had a wonderful time and were<br/>
enjoying meeting experienced homeschoolers.  It was a different group of<br/>
people than any we had known before, both because of the hs-ing and because<br/>
of different practices.  On the hike several talked of homeopathy (which I&#39;d<br/>
never heard of), and when we rested two women began breastfeeding (which I&#39;d<br/>
done with all three kids for about a year), but they had children about 3 or<br/>
4.  I wasn&#39;t too surprised as I&#39;d heard of long-term breastfeeding, just<br/>
never seen it.  When I went to the parking lot to get our lunch (I knew to<br/>
bring it this time!), I saw the leader of the group, the Christian &quot;old&quot;<br/>
member, and the other &quot;new&quot; member talking.  The leader was saying that<br/>
there were several people in the group that didn&#39;t want &quot;so many different&quot;<br/>
people coming in because they might change things.  One of the others asked<br/>
if it was because they were Christians and the leader said (rough quote),<br/>
&quot;Well, no one really wants to put it that way.  It&#39;s just that people have<br/>
different beliefs...&quot;  The old member said, well, maybe she could drop out<br/>
and help start a new group with the Christians.  So that&#39;s what we did.<br/>
After that experience, we made sure not to make it an exclusive group.  It<br/>
was interesting because as the years passed some of the other group&#39;s<br/>
members would come to our activities, especially field trips or play days.<br/>
    I have never been in a group that made members agree to a statement of<br/>
faith.  One group I was in started requiring that of leaders and I quit the<br/>
group.   I agree with whoever (Sandra ?) said that if a group says right up<br/>
front who&#39;s welcome that&#39;s fine (such as a Catholic homeschoolers group,<br/>
etc.).  But I think it would be nice if more people got along with others<br/>
and enjoyed the diversity that is homeschooling/unschooling rather than just<br/>
being with likeminded ones.   I have always wanted to meet people who have<br/>
different beliefs, customs, and viewpoints, but I know that makes a lot of<br/>
people uncomfortable.<br/>
    Sometimes it&#39;s hard being a Christian (who started out pretty<br/>
conservative but isn&#39;t so much any more) and a homeschooler (who started out<br/>
with curriculum, then got rid of the books and let the kids learn while<br/>
enjoying life).<br/>
Many area homeschoolers shun me as too liberal and not doing as a Christian<br/>
homeschooler should.  I don&#39;t know any local unschoolers.  Now my ds13 is<br/>
wanting to go to school next year.  We went yesterday to the high school and<br/>
talked with a counselor.  My dh says it&#39;s okay with him, but I think that&#39;s<br/>
just because he doesn&#39;t think that unschooling is good, so he&#39;d rather have<br/>
ds go to school.  I want ds to go if that&#39;s what he wants, because he wants<br/>
to see what it&#39;s like.  He has plenty of friends (all schooled) and is<br/>
active in theater.  He has also taught himself enough computer &quot;stuff&quot; (two<br/>
languages, sets up websites and creates games), so that a friend who teaches<br/>
CIS classes at a university has invited him to sit in on some jr and sr<br/>
level classes, because that&#39;s what ds is working on.  So he&#39;s learning here<br/>
at home but he wants the experience of going to school.   If that&#39;s what he<br/>
still wants in August, then I guess that&#39;s what he&#39;ll do.  His two younger<br/>
brothers are still home.  This probably knocks out a trip to the conference<br/>
in MA.  I was hoping I might be able to go.<br/>
    On top of all of this, I&#39;m in my last semester of classes working on a<br/>
PhD in social foundations of ed.  Why?  I&#39;m not really sure.  What do I want<br/>
to do?  Don&#39;t know yet.  Helping people homeschool/unschool would be good,<br/>
but the more I learn (at school and on this list and other places) the more<br/>
I know I don&#39;t know.  An early goal was to help bring unity to the hs<br/>
movement, but after reading various articles I don&#39;t know if that can<br/>
happen.  And I do blame the &quot;Christian hs movement&quot; for that state of<br/>
affairs, although, to come full circle, some exclusiveness has been shown by<br/>
different groups at dif. times in dif. places.  I hope that lessens as time<br/>
passes.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Before I was homeschooling I was in a field trip co-op group called &quot;Moms <br/>
With Something Extra,&quot; just a local thing someone had organized.  It was <br/>
stressful for me and the kids when some kids could walk on a ramp and others&#39; moms <br/>
said &quot;stay on the stairs.&quot;  Some kids could get out of line and play on the <br/>
grass, but other kids&#39; moms said &quot;stand right here and hold my hand.&quot;  When we went <br/>
on a field trip to Pizza Hut, over half the moms said &quot;no soda.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I dropped out of the group, because I didn&#39;t want to see the sad faces on <br/>
kids who couldn&#39;t do what my kids were doing, nor the mean faces on their mom, <br/>
nor did I want to squelch my kids&#39; freedom just to make more uptight, <br/>
controlling families more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I think that might be where it&#39;s hard to be with families that aren&#39;t <br/>
likeminded.  I can&#39;t enjoy &quot;diversity&quot; that involves the unhappiness of children <br/>
whose movement and freedom and joy are limited &quot;for their own good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can&#39;t we all just get along&quot; sounds good in theory, but will my kids have to <br/>
see toddlers spanked until they cry?  What will it cost us?<br/>

This is exactly the reason why I am uncomfortable with Jayn�s friendship<br/>
with our neighbors. The mother pulls her kids by their ear, does punishments<br/>
and time outs, and I think spanks. Also she leaves Renee and her visitor and<br/>
little brother unsupervised in their room, and in the past problems of<br/>
jealousy and Jonah�s sense of having his space invaded have been left to<br/>
escalate into violence (child acting-out minor violence but still upsetting<br/>
to the kids). I have told Jayn that I can�t let her be at their house, and<br/>
it is hard to phrase the reasons to her in such a way that are not being<br/>
critical or unkind � nor do I really want anything I say to get back to the<br/>
mother. I still don�t like the girl much, although Jayn seems better able to<br/>
stand up to her bossiness. They see much less of each other now. My dh and I<br/>
have had to have a talk with her about not trying to bring Jayn in on her<br/>
sly plans to steal and hide candy � as she is not allowed to have sugar and<br/>
both Renee and mother have told us this. I am very uncomfortable both with<br/>
the idea of limiting food (why should Jayn have to be limited for Renee�s<br/>
sake) and yet I can hardly go against something the mother has specifically<br/>
demanded. Renee is overweight and I guess they are trying limiting to deal<br/>
with it. Her mother always asks if she has �behaved�. Of course she has.<br/>

<br/>
I have trouble being with families that are more controlling simply because<br/>
it makes *me* uncomfortable knowing they are judging me as a poor parent.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll get over that with time &lt;g&gt;.  I know having this place to<br/>

I feel like this too, and this is one of the things I am working on in my<br/>
own personal growth program. I think I have come a long way, because I<br/>
recognize the urge to �do something� and ignore it (ie the urge) now,<br/>
instead of trying to change Jayn�s behavior (albeit nicely) unless she<br/>
really is driving people nuts. I find my idea of what is safe is not the<br/>
same as other peoples. I try to see myself as a good example for others (is<br/>
that really arrogant?) because it makes me stay relaxed with Jayn, despite<br/>
the subtle pressures of other parents around me. BTW never have any of these<br/>
particular bad feelings amongst the other hs�ers in my local group, just<br/>
schooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
I have so much admiration for my husband who seems to just neither notice<br/>
nor care about other people�s judgments.  He has said to other people<br/>
�that�s just where Jayn is right now�.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A sense of humor sometimes bridges the gap and it also can model lightening up with <br/>
your kids (which can be a good thing). I remember my then three year old son running <br/>
away toward our camp room when we were at a missionary retreat. He was way ahead of <br/>
us when my husband called to him to stop and wait for us. While calling out to him, a very <br/>
strict mom walked by. (She had given me a baby shower where the primary gift was a <br/>
wooden spoon and instead of games, gave a &quot;talk&quot; about how to spank...)<br/>
<br/>
When my son kept running, my husband called out, &quot;Hey listen to me! I&#39;m only going to <br/>
tell you two hundred more times to wait for us....&quot; This woman stopped in her tracks. then <br/>
she looked at my husband and we both just cracked up. Noah beat us to our room, <br/>
naturally, where he got tickled by dad.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, I&#39;ve learned to cop to our very different way of parenting (even before <br/>
unschooling we were &quot;slackers&quot; compared to our homeschool world) with a sense of <br/>
humor. It helps when you can&#39;t avoid those more rigid contexts... and I&#39;ve seen some <br/>
moms loosen up as if gaining permission from observing me and my kids...<br/>

good, because I&#39;ve come to say things like &quot;Why don&#39;t you just let her play?&quot; <br/>

I have been known to ask �why?� when a parent has made some arbitrary<br/>
decision, like �that�s the last bucket of water�. The answer has usually<br/>
been a blank stare and a shrug. Also the children tend to ignore the parent<br/>
making the statement � even before I say �why?�.<br/>
