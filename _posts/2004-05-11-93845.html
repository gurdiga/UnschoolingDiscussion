<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238853921">This is really true. Honest! We three saw Mean Girls on opening day -- <br/>
DD14 and me, with eight-year-old DS in tow. DS isn&#39;t in the least sexually <br/>
curious, got absolutely none of the innuendo and also wasn&#39;t bothered by any of <br/>
it. He loved the movie, laughed his head off.  By the way, he knows as little <br/>
about school as he does about sex or girl psychology and head games. He still <br/>
loved it -- didn&#39;t bother him in the slightest. :)  JJ<br/>
<br/>
p.s. It&#39;s one of those movies that could have been gross and tedious, like so <br/>
many teen movies. You can&#39;t tell from the printed recipe how the chef&#39;s <br/>
personal flair and the outstanding quality of the  ingredients she hand-picked make <br/>
this movie worth seeing. Also her presentation on the plate --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But the stuff I posted above...Wow, she doesn&#39;t know much about any <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of that at all.  Maybe she&#39;s curious, maybe she&#39;s ready to start <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hearing about some of that, and that&#39;s cool...but all that thrown <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; together in one movie? -=--<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The things you posted, not one of them is necessary to the plot.  If she <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t understand something, it will just go by and she won&#39;t need it <br/>
&gt; explained <br/>
&gt; to understand the story or the characters.<br/>
