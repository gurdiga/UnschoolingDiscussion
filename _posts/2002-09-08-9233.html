<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122149512">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may remember me from months ago.  I&#39;d unsubscribed for a<br/>
while as DH was laid off and took over with the kids while I worked from<br/>
home full time.  He just went back to work and I must say I missed the<br/>
flow that I&#39;d got into with the kids.  I&#39;m listening to my husband as I<br/>
write giving short sharp controlling directions to both kidlets about<br/>
not spilling water on the floor of the bathroom (is that possible?) not<br/>
too much water, not too many bubbles.... DH just found all the shampoo<br/>
tipped out and asked me to go take away money from Zak (assuming it was<br/>
him)... I answered &quot;no... I don&#39;t think I want to be that<br/>
controlling&quot;.... I think I&#39;ve noticed that not only is he controlling,<br/>
but I am as well since I haven&#39;t been the one &quot;at home&quot; with them.  DH<br/>
went to work this morning and we had a great few hours.  The kids were<br/>
naked building tents in the living room out of sheets and other things<br/>
they could find.  I was cleaning my house (we are moving) and would stop<br/>
and play periodically as I was invited into their tents.  Eventually I<br/>
was invited in and told the rules of what happens if you leave the tent<br/>
and how many points you lose.  I decided to stay and lay on the couch<br/>
and read Life Learning Magazine... It was actually quite peaceful...<br/>
Prior to that they were outside naked turning on the hose and making a<br/>
trench and a bowling place....  Covered with mud I put them in the bath<br/>
prior to them building tents.  I think I&#39;m going to think more about<br/>
this controlling issue as I used to like to say &quot;is this the hill I want<br/>
to die on&quot;....<br/>

<br/>
I was wondering where you had gotten to!  So where is your <br/>
moving destination and when is the event taking place?  Glad <br/>
you&#39;re back.<br/>
