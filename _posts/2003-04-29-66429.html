Maybe someone should do a conference in Ohio in Spring 2004.  That <br/>
would be <br/>
really  nice.  (We are planning to drive out there anyway!)<br/>

Oh My! Ohio would be a great! There are a few Ohio unschoolers on the list <br/>
here, and I know of a few more here and there. I would volunteer, but I&#39;m not <br/>
sure I have hit the magical brain spurt yet (stuck right in the middle of the <br/>
30/32 years) heh heh.... <br/>
<br/>
Another Ohioan on the list and I were talking briefly about it at a <br/>
homeschooling get-together, and I was saying how I wish it could be here <br/>
instead of SC, because I was unsure I could make it to SC, and she was kinda <br/>
telling me how much it takes to make one happen.....wow. <br/>
<br/>
Just the thought of having one here has me giddy......I am totally open to <br/>
suggestions, however naive I am LOL....<br/>

appreciate the work you yourself did!  (Which can be a good thing, when <br/>
there&#39;s that much work!)<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be a full-blown big conference.  It could be a picnic and <br/>
have demo-activities, games, something that causes interaction and helps the <br/>
shy people get ideas.<br/>
