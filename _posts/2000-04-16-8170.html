<div id="ygrps-yiv-662422387">Hi all! I have a question that has been concerning me about my kids. I have a <br/>
9 1/2yr. old son and a 7yr. old son. My 9 yr old will ask me every question <br/>
under the sun about everything in life. Together we find and search out the <br/>
answers to all his questions (and sometimes he reads and searches for answers <br/>
by himself). But, my 7 yr. old never asks us any questions about anything. He <br/>
loves dinosaurs and big trucks. He does a lot of dinosaur digging in the back <br/>
yard and he plays with his trucks most of the day. He looks at picture books <br/>
but doesn&#39;t yet read. I haven&#39;t pushed him in anyway to learn anything. But, <br/>
yet he asks us no questions about anything. Is this strange or normal or <br/>
what? Is it because he learns in a different way? Should I be concerned or <br/>
just let things be? Any suggestions? I would appreciate some advice about <br/>
this.<br/>
