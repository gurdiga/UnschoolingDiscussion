<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911942439">There are three conferences coming up at which I&#39;m speaking, and others here <br/>
are speaking at one or another of them too.  So I thought maybe it would be <br/>
good to ask this thoughtful group for suggestions on what is, would be, has <br/>
been helpful to you at an in-person presentation.  <br/>
<br/>
Different people like different things too.  Some like a workshop at which <br/>
they&#39;re directly addressed, and given something to hold or do or say.  Others <br/>
like anonymity where they listen in quiet stillness (on the outside, anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone on this list who was in Long Beach last spring when I did the <br/>
thing with the kitchen timer and the six topics which were ended at ten <br/>
minutes by the timer?    I&#39;m thinking of doing that one again, maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that in South Carolina I should do the &quot;That&#39;s Not Educational&quot; <br/>
game that I&#39;ve done sometimes before, where people name things and I tell <br/>
them what learning opportunities could be made of them.  If I can&#39;t, they get <br/>
a prize.<br/>
<br/>
Are there other conferences than these three that some of you are attending <br/>
or participating in?<br/>

<br/>
P.S.<br/>
For those who might be here who are or were involved in the cooperative <br/>
MindFull conference in September in Fort Worth, I&#39;ve withdrawn from <br/>
participation.  I&#39;m sorry it didn&#39;t work out differently.  Before I signed on <br/>
I was told it would be open to others up to the last minute, for locals who <br/>
found out about it late.  Then it was closed entirely.   There were a few <br/>
other problems, which perhaps could just be written off as having to do with <br/>
my own pushy personality, but I&#39;m not going to subject five kids to a drive <br/>
into the heat of Texas for that (not to mention hotel meals for six people <br/>
for three days, gas, risking lives, etc.)  And the teenaged boys were SO <br/>
realistic about the &quot;opportunity&quot; to meet lots of other homeschooled teens.  <br/>
They said if they liked them a lot it would be frustrating that they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
get to see them more, and if they didn&#39;t like them much it would be <br/>
frustrating that they&#39;d gone so far and were stuck there three days.   Pretty <br/>
smart kids.</div>

<br/>
We should be at this one. I&#39;m easy when it comes to workshops -- as long as<br/>
I&#39;m not bored senseless (I have no worries about you in particular, but I&#39;ve<br/>
been hostage in conference rooms where they could have performed emergency<br/>
dental surgery on me, as everything including my teeth had gone to sleep) I<br/>
don&#39;t have a preference for whether I listen quietly or am asked to<br/>
participate in charades, or anything in between. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect to be attending many of the workshops in Sacramento (yours<br/>
for sure, others maybe when I see a schedule) -- I&#39;ll do a shift at the<br/>
county contact booth, and the girls (or at least Brit) will want to be<br/>
involved in the kids programs, so it&#39;ll be a bit of a juggle with Wally to<br/>
see that we&#39;ve got everything covered. And we won&#39;t likely be staying<br/>
overnight (we live an hour south, so it&#39;s hard to justify the hotel fees,<br/>
plus we have a dog who isn&#39;t welcome and we don&#39;t like to leave her). We may<br/>
just be there for one day, but hopefully both.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll definitely be at this one. I live about 2 hours away from <br/>
Sacramento. I&#39;m just trying to work out if I can afford a hotel or if <br/>
I&#39;ll have to come for just one of the days. The other possibility is <br/>
to camp somewhere within a reasonable driving distance away. <br/>
If anyone knows of anywhere to camp, could you pass along the <br/>
info to me, thanks.<br/>
I&#39;m really looking forward to meeting some of you in the flesh!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was really our intention to camp two years ago to attend the conference -<br/>
there is a KOA across town from the hotel and it&#39;s not a terrible drive.  We<br/>
figured that it didn&#39;t matter that it was a KOA, since we&#39;d be spending 99%<br/>
of our waking hours at the conference itself.  It was however, 106 degrees!<br/>
And was only cooling down to the 90&#39;s at night!!  We weenied out and got a<br/>
hotel room near the conference instead.<br/>

<br/>
My dream in life is to do Jesse-Jackson-style oration.  <br/>
I LOVE to listen to him.  I usually have no idea what he said after it&#39;s <br/>
over, but it&#39;s a sound-massage.  Probably in part because he&#39;s doing a <br/>
classic Baptist preacher cadence/rhythm/lilt/build, but he&#39;s not talking <br/>
about brimstone and hellfire.<br/>
<br/>
I think the workshops are more like telling little stories and asking leading <br/>
questions so people think what they hadn&#39;t thought to think.  It might be a <br/>
style of preaching.  <br/>

more of a lecture, but one that is boring and not very engaging. <br/>
Where you&#39;re being talked at a lot but not required to think much. <br/>
I don&#39;t have any personal experience of preaching, I used the <br/>

&gt; &gt;    the efforts  of each station to reduce spending<br/>
&gt; &gt;   costs and streamline their   services,   some<br/>

&gt; programs is<br/>
&gt; &gt; too large a portion of   funding for something  <br/>
&gt; which is seen as not<br/>

&lt;&lt; Preaching was not the right word. I was really trying to describe <br/>
more of a lecture, but one that is boring and not very engaging.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no.  I don&#39;t lecture.  But I aspire to preach so that people jump up and <br/>
yell Hallelujah! and they throw off the shackles of demonic schooling and <br/>
live free in the light.  <br/>
<br/>
Amen.</div>
