<div id="ygrps-yiv-119109693">&lt;&lt; the squashing of arbitrary *no&#39;s* has forced<br/>
me to be conscious of just how much i&#39;m operating on autopilot sometimes,<br/>
listening to the whispering ghosts of my parents&#39; rules and expectations<br/>
and relaying them into *rules* that my own children must abide by. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to point out that use of &quot;expectations,&quot; right between rules and <br/>
*rules.*<br/>
<br/>
Candid, honest use of a word, evidence of where it can commonly be found.<br/>
There&#39;s another place it sits:  &quot;parental expectations&quot;<br/>
That just doesn&#39;t sound as useful to me as &quot;parental generosity&quot; or &quot;parental <br/>
joy.&quot;<br/>
