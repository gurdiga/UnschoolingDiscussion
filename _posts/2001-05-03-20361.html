<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443578390"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   BUT ... I am moving out of here this summer most likely :<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Reason being : Pierce county is going nuts on raising rates<br/>
&gt;   Our rent is a mere $1400 a mo ... not a biggie - pretty typical<br/>
&gt;   and actually a very wonderful price for the beautiful home we<br/>
&gt;   have by the water, with 4 bedrooms, 3 bath, hot tub - huge floorplan etc<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how we ended up back here in Oregon. When we moved out of King<br/>
County, we sold our land with our 20 year old mobile home for just about<br/>
enough to cover our beautiful new house here in Oregon. During the time that<br/>
we lived there, we went from being on a dead-end dirt road to being smack in<br/>
the middle of $500k per house developments. Scary! My advice if you&#39;re<br/>
looking to locate a community is to be very sure about what is going in<br/>
around you. It made such a huge difference to our quality of life when our<br/>
little dirt-road became a major paved thoroughfare for all the yuppies<br/>
zipping by in their Range Rovers at 50 mph (even though it was still<br/>
supposedly &quot;residential&quot; and a 25 mph speed limit. And none of the new<br/>
divisions put in sidewalks, so we could no longer walk on our road with our<br/>
kids. Everything in that area of Washington is booming with new<br/>
developments, so be very careful what/where you buy!<br/>
Also, if you get the opportunity, go and visit &quot;Sharingwood&quot; community in<br/>
Bothell. They went through a ton in trying to get their (now very<br/>
successful) community off of the ground, and in dealing with permits, land<br/>
use restriction, etc. for this sort of development. I&#39;m sure they could give<br/>
you lots of great advice about putting together a community in Washington.<br/>
You should be able to find a contact by doing a web search.<br/>
