<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281053920">Beth, I got Julie the original at Wireless or Signals several years ago.  It<br/>
was down to shreds when I found it again at www.iloveadeal.com, on sale,<br/>
just recently, although I think I have seen it in a T-shirt shop somewhere,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
And, no I don&#39;t particularly miss those days, although I do have many fond<br/>
memories.  I am glad my kids have an atmosphere of more people knowing about<br/>
home/unschooling, even if they don&#39;t always have an accurate view or agree,<br/>
and just generally having more information readily available than I did.  I<br/>
was working in the dark most of the time, knowing in my heart this was<br/>
right, but unaware of just how incredible it would turn out to be.  My<br/>
children are much more aware of what they are working toward and options<br/>
available as they home/unschool their own kids and doing a beautiful job!<br/>
<br/>
  Most of the other hs&#39;ing families we met early on in person were Fundies<br/>
and we had such strong philosophical differences that they seemed as weird<br/>
to us as I am sure we seemed to them.  By the time we came to Oklahoma, I<br/>
was beginning to feel that others within the homeschooling community were<br/>
far greater threats to our right to homeschool in the way that best fit our<br/>
family than anyone outside could be, so we were fairly isolated in<br/>
homeschooling, just doing the things that worked for us.  We did meet other<br/>
families here who respected individual ways of hs&#39;ing, and formed<br/>
friendships, but still continued on our own way day to day.  I appreciate<br/>
having, for myself as well as my kids, the communication that the internet<br/>
provides, as well as a growing number of homeschoolers everywhere.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076715648">Thanks for the link that looks like a great web site! Also I know what you<br/>
mean about the &quot;fundies&quot; they are the only organized support group up here<br/>
and the other ones are far away but it seems being an unschooler means being<br/>
unconventional and not needing the support of a group any way though it is<br/>
nice to have the internet to go to for ideas and friendship. Did you let<br/>
your kids schedule their time completely however they wanted to all day long<br/>
or what type of rules if any did you have and enforce?<br/>
Beth the curious and grateful</div>
