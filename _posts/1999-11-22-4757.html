<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Over a 40-year career, the difference in earnings between a high school<br/>
 </span></blockquote>education and a college education is about $1 million, he told CNN.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s the value of a college education,&quot; said Caperton, a former West<br/>
Virginia governor. And even if it requires loans, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t know<br/>
anywhere in the world where you can make an investment and make that kind of<br/>
return.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Caperton stressed that Americans need college degrees for the better paying,<br/>
high-skill jobs offered in technology and the global economy. &quot;In this<br/>
knowledge-based economy,&quot; he said, &quot;the payoff is worth whatever it costs.&quot;<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Ergo:<br/>
<br/>
If you accept this premise (as if you&#39;re going to question it anyway), you<br/>
have no choice but to go through us to obtain your &quot;ticket to success.&quot;  Ya<br/>
ha ha ha ha ha!!!<br/>
<br/>
And as long as enough people realize that, we can raise tuition to whatever<br/>
level we want.  If the cost of a four year degree were half a million, you&#39;d<br/>
still be able to double your investment over your lifetime.  So quit whining<br/>
about how expensive it is and get back to your homework!!<br/>

not true.  My best friend&#39;s dad, who worked for Getty Oil (here in<br/>
California) wanted to be a lawyer.  He had never attended college,  never<br/>
attended law school, studied on his own, and passed the bar on his first try<br/>
(with a very high score).  Homeschooled his own self :-)<br/>

Just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>

Thanks for the message.  We need to hear about more people like that.  We<br/>
need to give colleges more competition; show them that they don&#39;t own the<br/>
patent on education.<br/>
