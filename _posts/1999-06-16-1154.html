<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088743002">There are some things I make my 2yr old son do - he must finish his <br/>
bread - no leaving the crust.  He must clean up when he spills.  And <br/>
when he&#39;s old enough, he must help out around the house.  I&#39;m not mean <br/>
about it.  He just knows what&#39;s expected of him, and even though he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to pick up his toys, he does because he&#39;s a big boy now and <br/>
he has his own room.  He&#39;s learning to do things he doesn&#39;t like to do.  <br/>
He knows if he doesn&#39;t keep his room clean, then he won&#39;t be able to <br/>
have his own room (though he still sleeps in our room).  He knows that <br/>
he can&#39;t wear his favorite shirt every single day, and that his teddy <br/>
bear must be washed once in a while.  He knows that when we only have <br/>
about half an hour before Daddy gets home, that he has to help me <br/>
straighten things up before I read to him.  DH is supportive of <br/>
homeschooling, but not unschooling, and insists we get started early, so <br/>
I&#39;ve made the few minutes before DH gets home story time.  DH has no <br/>
clue that DS doesn&#39;t sit at the table doing worksheets all day.  <br/>
Whenever DS does do a worksheet, which he likes to do on occasion, I <br/>
save it in a folder, and when DH asks to see what DS has been doing, I <br/>
show him the folder.  I also tell him all our activities in eduspeak, <br/>
and DH is quite proud of his &quot;genius&quot; son.  Whatever works.  I guess I&#39;m <br/>
getting good practice for when MIL asks why we&#39;re not sending our son to <br/>
baby genius school (she does sometimes...).<br/>
<br/>
And, sure, I survived the ps system - barely.  I still have almost no <br/>
confidence in myself, and am afraid of meeting people in person.  I&#39;ve <br/>
lost all my creativity, and fear any kind of book, except the books I <br/>
got in trouble for reading at school.  I have no motivation except <br/>
unschooling.  Whenever I think about it, I just fill with adrenaline.  I <br/>
can&#39;t sleep in anymore because the second I think I might be starting to <br/>
wake up, I remember my decision to unschool ds (and also myself, I <br/>
guess) and wonder why I would want to waste such a wonderful morning.  <br/>
I jump out of bed as soon as possible, and get so excited about all the <br/>
wonderful things I can learn - without having to sit in front of a <br/>
textbook listening to a boring lecture about things I already know, <br/>
or things I don&#39;t care about.  The last time I woke up early on my own <br/>
because I wanted to was after about a month of summer vacation in <br/>
elementary school.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ramble.  I think I wrote this for my own benefit more than <br/>
anything else.  hehe<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631407860">Hey Lisa - A child that likes spinach??!! I find this concept overwhelmingly<br/>
unbelievable. Are you sure your child wasn&#39;t swapped at birth for an alien?<br/>
&lt;vbg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids eat what is put in front of them - or go make a sandwich or whatever. I<br/>
wasn&#39;t made to eat anything I didn&#39;t like as a child - except the once, and<br/>
after dealing with the resulting mess, my mother never did it again! My cousin<br/>
on the other hand was made to eat everything put in front of her (I won&#39;t go<br/>
into details of what &#39;made to eat&#39; meant in that family, as I don&#39;t want to<br/>
totally gross everyone out), and when she first left home and went flatting<br/>
with me she was very boastful of the fact that she ate everything. Six months<br/>
later she was the ultimate fussy eater and remained that way, while as I got<br/>
older I gradually ate more and more things. Even spnach :-)<br/>
