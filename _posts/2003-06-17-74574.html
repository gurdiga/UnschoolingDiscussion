&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve heard stories about kids still sucking thumbs when they&#39;re <br/>
<br/>
teens.  That just doesn&#39;t seem ok to me.  At what point do you do <br/>
<br/>
something about it?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The something that most parents do is shame the child to the core.<br/>
When do you think would be the best time to do that?<br/>
<br/>
And really, what else CAN you do?  Because you can&#39;t stop the behavior very <br/>
smoothly without some damage to the child&#39;s esteem.<br/>
<br/>
I know a girl who sucked her thumb until she was grown.  She learned to hide <br/>
it, she learned not to care what others said, and I don&#39;t think she still <br/>
sucks it, since she&#39;s been in romantic relationships.   (Maybe your son needs a <br/>
girlfriend!   Joking, mostly...)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d let him sleep with the stuffed animal, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I slept with my teddy bear for years and years.  A big breakup in my 20&#39;s got <br/>
him one more trip to the bed with me.  (I wonder if Katie sucked her thumb <br/>
when she broke up with her first boyfriend!)<br/>
<br/>
When my kids have had behaviors go on to the point I was afraid of what <br/>
others would say to them, I would say that.  I would say they should try not to do <br/>
it in public because it makes others uncomfortable and not everyone will be <br/>
nice to them about it.   There were some things we did tell the kids were okay <br/>
to do in private, but not in public.  Holding their privates, picking their <br/>
noses...  and maybe that could be one of those.  It&#39;s sad, because it&#39;s NOT <br/>
scatological, but I think letting it go without ANY comment could be as cruel as <br/>
conditioning it out in ways that will leave other scars.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s young.  I wouldn&#39;t rag on him.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Holly has a friend now who&#39;s 10 or so who&#39;s a thumbsucker.  Her parents <br/>
don&#39;t get along at all.  They separated and hardly speak to each other.   The <br/>
first girl I mentioned, her parents divorced, too, when she was young. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428973177">Sheila my dd doesn&#39;t suck her thumb but she still drinks out of a bottle about twice a day, once during the day and then at bed time. Oh and she has no cavities or teeth deformity, we were just at the denist. Several months ago she stopped drinking her bottle out in the yard where people can see cuz she knows what people think and doesn&#39;t like their reaction I don&#39;t either, my hanai mom has finially learned to keep her mouth shut when she spends the night and dd asks for a bottle but I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, she can quit when she&#39;s ready and if she&#39;s still enjoying a bottle or two when she&#39;s 35 oh well. BTW I have asked her when she thinks she&#39;ll be ready to give her bottle and she says she&#39;s drinking bottle forever, so that&#39;s where it&#39;s at for now. <br/>
<br/>
p.s. I did make a one bottle a night rule becuz she sleeps w/me and I don&#39;t like being pee&#39;d on. She can stay dry if she sticks to one bottle, but two and well I get a midnight shower I don&#39;t very much appreicate. <br/>
<br/>
Personally I wouldn&#39;t worry about the thumbsucking and would just help her find ways to avoid peoples negitive reactions but then I really do believe in picking my battles wisely. I stand firm on issues of health and safety but pretty much everything else is negoitatable, not sure if that fits your parenting style but it works here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366030361">Sheila, my first thought was, what&#39;s wrong with that? We all have different <br/>
ways of soothing ourselves and he has found one that works for him. My <br/>
youngest son, who will be four this week, still breastfeeds once or twice a <br/>
day - horrifying to some people but wonderful for him. He will quit when he <br/>
is ready.<br/>
<br/>
My second thought was about his growing teeth. Is it really true that <br/>
thumb-sucking can cause teeth to grow crooked? If it is, it is much easier <br/>
to fix crooked teeth than a damaged spirit.<br/>

break when it got cracked, raw, and infected from being chapped so much.. But <br/>
,that got healed up and now, he pops in in once and while.     JP sometimes gets <br/>
frustrated because he NEEDS his thumb when he is playing, but he has such a <br/>
strong habit of sucking it, its a conflict of interests.  When he has been like <br/>
that, I offer  to do anything I can to help him stop sucking his thumb  I have <br/>
suggesteed buying some nasty tasting nail polish stuff ( they do make that <br/>
for breaking thumbing sucking) , putting a band-aid on it, giving him $$ if he <br/>
stops for an extended period of time.. He always opts out and choses to keep <br/>
sucking his thumb.   My sister sucked her thumb til she was 15.   Granted, after <br/>
she was 8 or 9, she only did it in the privacy of our home and among her <br/>
other friends that still sucked thier thumbs.. lol.   <br/>

our family.    Among my children,  Ethan&#39;s teeth are the most crooked, and he <br/>
never sucked his thumb and gave up his pacifier comparably earlier than Landon <br/>
and Anna. OH, and speaking of crooked teeth.. Anna will be getting her braces <br/>
off next month!!.. Then we can get Ethan in his braces, he is very excited.. <br/>
He wants his teeth fixed so badly.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141555770">***I&#39;m looking for some opinions on thumb sucking.  My son will be six <br/>
next month and still sucks his thumb.  He also has a favorite stuffed <br/>
animal (Curious George!) that he needs to have in order to fall <br/>
asleep.***<br/>
<br/>
Dylan is eleven and sleeps with his &quot;bundle of snuggles&quot;.  It&#39;s his old<br/>
baby quilt and afghan wrapped around whatever baby he&#39;s selected for the<br/>
night.  He has a bunk bed with a futon below and the futon is full,<br/>
STACKED with babies. (stuffed animals)  He talks to them to make sure<br/>
they want to sleep with him, etc. and snuggles them all night.<br/>
<br/>
He never did suck his thumb but he twirled his hair and still does when<br/>
he&#39;s thinking particularly hard about something. <br/>
<br/>
I sucked my thumb for a long time.  I was six or so when my mom tried to<br/>
bribe me into quitting because she was afraid I&#39;d do it at school and the<br/>
kids would tease me.  I don&#39;t remember ever being teased (I don&#39;t<br/>
remember much about school) and I don&#39;t remember when I finally quit. <br/>
Today I&#39;m reasonably well adjusted, no criminal convictions, no mental<br/>
illness, no emotional hang ups.   Dylan says I&#39;m a compulsive trampoline<br/>
bouncer, but can one really trust the diagnosis of a hair twirler? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think sleep friends are very nice and comforting and I think that&#39;s<br/>
what the thumb sucking is too.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.   He&#39;s pretty<br/>
smart if he&#39;s found a way to comfort himself and meet his own needs. <br/>
Lot&#39;s of adults don&#39;t know how to do that in a healthy way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053707444">&lt;&lt;My second thought was about his growing teeth. Is it really true that<br/>
thumb-sucking can cause teeth to grow crooked? If it is, it is much easier<br/>

<br/>
Some of my kids have been very attached to pacifiers.  Nicholette, in <br/>
particular.  She sucked on one until right around her 4th birthday.  The bad <br/>
news, in some cases, is yes, it does cause tooth misalignment.  The really <br/>
bad news is that it also can cause the pallet to mishapen.  W have seen <br/>
several dentists who have all told us that thumb sucking can be even more of <br/>
a problem.  (I tried to encourage thumb sucking over a pacifier for sanitary <br/>
reasons.)  Her teeth grew in perfect, though after time, her pallet, and as <br/>
a result her teeth, grew in an arch.  One of her front teeth began to recess <br/>
back into the gum.  Not disappear but the whole tooth was visible, looked <br/>
like it was on top of the gum on the outside and the bottom of her tooth was <br/>
fluh with the bottom of her gumline, if that makes any sense.  It took a <br/>
long time to fall out and her permanant tooth grew in behind it.  Her <br/>
permanant teeth look better but she still has a noticable arch to her teeth.<br/>
<br/>
The comments from others was very damaging to her.  People asked all the <br/>
time if she lost her first tooth.  This started very early, right about the <br/>
age of 3.  She would tell them no and I would explain that the tooth was <br/>
still there.  She cried many times because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Hannah also sucks a pacifier.  She will be 5 in September.  She doesn&#39;t do <br/>
it very often now but she still does.  It&#39;s been hard to discourage with <br/>
babies in the house.  I&#39;ve found that *losing* them really works.  It <br/>
generally takes a couple of days, during which I offer lots of extra <br/>
comfort, love and attention.  My boys and Hannah have almost completely <br/>
given them up.  I notice that Chloe doesn&#39;t care for a pacifier and I wonder <br/>
if this is a result of breastfeeding.  I was unable to nurse the other kids <br/>
for very long but Chloe is almost 9 months old and could care less about a <br/>
pacifier.  She&#39;s the first one!<br/>
<br/>
I have always been really torn about pacifiers.  On the one hand, they are <br/>
very comforting to children, on the other, I worried that they were just <br/>
Mommy substitutes.  In the end, it came down to paying attention to times of <br/>
use and reasons for use and I concluded it had nothing to do with the amount <br/>
of attention or comfort I provided.<br/>
<br/>
I realize you can&#39;t just *lose* a thumb! LOL  So, in that respect, I&#39;m sorry <br/>
but I can&#39;t offer any solutions for stopping.  I just wanted to add that it <br/>
*can* in fact cause permanant damage.  I also agree though, that I&#39;d go for <br/>
my child&#39;s comfort and deal with the damage later.  Unless, like Nicholette, <br/>
the damge is causing the emotional pain, in which case, I would work on an <br/>
agreeable alternative.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve heard stories about kids still sucking thumbs when they&#39;re<br/>

something about it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll let you know when I get there!!! I have a family of<br/>
suckers here. Tara sucked her fingers not her thumb. She sucked them until<br/>
she was probably about 6 or 7. I never thought it was any big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph had a pacifier. He loved his pasher. Had a ton of them. He used them<br/>
until he was a little over 4. Then decided he wouldn&#39;t need them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra sucks her thumb. She still does and she&#39;s now 7. She uses the that<br/>
thumb stuff that you put on the thumb to not suck it. She only uses it<br/>
during the day and only when she remembers. It was her idea. She was getting<br/>
sick a lot. It was always only her and I talked to her that it was because<br/>
of her thumb always in her mouth. So we talked about germs and washing her<br/>
hands and using the anitbacterial stuff. She decided on the thumb stuff<br/>
instead. It works for her and she hasn&#39;t said she doesn&#39;t want to do it.<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed when she doesn&#39;t use the stuff, she doesn&#39;t suck like she use<br/>
to. She also always takes it off at night so she can still use her thumb.<br/>
I&#39;m still not worried. If she reaches 16 and still does it, I&#39;ll let you<br/>
know how I feel about it then. I&#39;m really not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Alyssa loves her pashers. We&#39;ve gone through hundreds. She loses them<br/>
regularly. She goes through periods when she never has them during the day<br/>
and then days when it&#39;s always in her mouth. Being that I nursed on demand,<br/>
I was sure, as I was told that she wouldn&#39;t need a pacifier. Well she did<br/>
anyway. She wanted to use me as a pacifier but didn&#39;t want the milk. So that<br/>
was her only choice as I saw it. When she talks I ask that she takes it out<br/>
so I can understand her. Most times at night she&#39;s sleeping without it.<br/>
Again I&#39;m not worried.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My SIL is 42, last time she slept overnight here (six years ago) I went to <br/>
take her an extra blanket in the night, her thumb was in her mouth.  She&#39;s done <br/>
it all her life in her teen years (and I knew her then) some thought it was a <br/>
problem.  When she gave birth the first time I remember a nurse having a <br/>
problem with finding a MOTHER sleeping with her thumb in her mouth.  Her front <br/>
teeth, despite wearing braces in her teens are still protruding.  She doesn&#39;t find <br/>
it a problem, no one else seems to care anymore.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son was a thumbsucker, since birth.  At seven the dentist put an <br/>
appliance in his mouth to prevent him from sucking his thumb at night.  Matthew <br/>
tried every nasty tasting substance to avoid the thumbsucking.  He REALLY <br/>
wanted to stop.  He had a cabbage patch doll, he cut his thumb off, it worried me, <br/>
the appliance might have helped him NOT to suck the thumb but it helped him <br/>
emotionally to THINK it was over.<br/>
<br/>
No one in our home cared if he sucked his thumb, SIL was still doing it, <br/>
Matthew didn&#39;t want to do it and eventually he did stop.  I&#39;m really not 100% sure <br/>
because he hasn&#39;t lived at home for a few years.  When he does sleep over he <br/>
has his SO with him so I don&#39;t go in his room.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest girl has a &quot;binky&quot; which is her blanket.  She&#39;s 15, she still <br/>
packs it for overnight trips.  Will she sleep with it when she&#39;s married?  <br/>
Doesn&#39;t bother me but I have heard relatives comment on it, her friends accept it as <br/>
part of her.  I do take it to wash it occasionally, making sure it&#39;s back by <br/>
bedtime.  It&#39;s old, raggedy and getting pretty fragile.  One time she did say <br/>
she thought we should put it in the cedar chest before it disintegrates, I <br/>
thought she meant right then, she didn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
I would try to help the child overcome the thumbsucking if that was the <br/>
child&#39;s goal.  If there were dental issues involved I&#39;d let the child be a part of <br/>
that discussion with the dentist so they know what is at stake physically but <br/>
in all reality there isn&#39;t so much you can do about any of those things, like <br/>
thumbsucking or blankies and it can cause lots of stress if you try.<br/>

<br/>
The child! lol I guess the stars made that confusing.  We go through <br/>
hundreds of them, too, like you.  Unless requested, I don&#39;t make an effort <br/>
to locate them.  Most of the time, they are lost while out shopping or <br/>
something.  Those are actually good times to lose them, so to speak, because <br/>
the kids are occupied and don&#39;t notice.  Caeleb gave up a pacifier in a <br/>
situation like this.  He lost his at the mall and only asked for it twice.  <br/>
Both times, we were at home and didn&#39;t have one.  We snuggled and played and <br/>
it was forgotten.  He only now takes one if he happens to find Chloe&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times they were lost at home and I didn&#39;t look for them.  <br/>
This was how Nicholette gave it up, too.  She lost it and we looked for it <br/>
but couldn&#39;t find it.  She asked for it, but at the time we had a rental car <br/>
and couldn&#39;t fit everyone in it, so we couldn&#39;t go to the store to replace <br/>
it.  I offered lots of extra attention and though she was fussy more than <br/>
usual, she went through the transition smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying that *if* you want to get rid of them, losing them is an easy way <br/>
to go.<br/>

  ************************<br/>
  Guh!  I could never do that to my daughter.  Geez!  Quick story....  We were living in Helena, had just gotten our home, but were still sleeping nights at the hotel.  The one night, Margaux forgot her Perri and Huggy (big pink bunny and blanket).  Shahram was exhausted and I was exhausted.  I didn&#39;t want to drive across town and get them.  She said she couldn&#39;t sleep without them, so I told her that she didn&#39;t have to sleep, if she didn&#39;t want to.  We told her that Perri and Huggy were keeping our cat company and they would surely not want to make her cry.  So I held her and she eventually got uncomfortable and wanted to lie down.  We both got into bed together, and 2 minutes later she was softly snoring.  When she got up in the morning, she thanked me for staying with her and said she still missed Perri and Huggy.  So, we left right away and went to the apartment to see Perri and Huggy.  If Perri and Huggy were ever actually lost, the whole family would be devastated.  They are such a part of her and who she is.  I crocheted Huggy for her when she was still inside my belly.  Perriwinkle, the bunny, was given to her one Easter when I had no money to spend and we were living solo.  That bunny would not let me leave the store without her.  So, I felt that Perri and Margaux were meant to be together.  I could never intentionally lose Perri.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think I could cause my daughter that kind of pain intentionally.  I still have my Chewbacca doll from my childhood.  I&#39;m glad my mom didn&#39;t lose him.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;My sister sucked her thumb until she was maybe 11.  Then she noticed that<br/>
her top teeth stuck out.  Don&#39;t know whether it was because of the<br/>
thumb-sucking or not, but she took it on herself to put elastic bands around<br/>
her top teeth.  I think she put the elastics on the teeth that were either<br/>
side of the ones that stuck out and included the sticking out ones.  She<br/>
ended up with straight teeth.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Well I never sucked a thing (when I was little) and I needed braces. Tara&#39;s<br/>
sister sucked her fingers well into being 11-12 and didn&#39;t need braces.<br/>

Sierra has a very small mouth and crowded teeth from day one that she<br/>
started to get them. I figure all my kids will need braces so sucking a<br/>
thumb or a pacifier isn&#39;t worth the fighting.<br/>

&lt;&lt;One of the biggest disagreements I&#39;ve ever had online was with someone who<br/>
said when she didn&#39;t want her kids to watch the VCR she unplugged it and<br/>
said it<br/>
was broken.  Even to trying to turn it on and acting surprised and sad and<br/>
sympathizing with them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just want to say that I didn&#39;t say that about &quot;losing&quot; a pacifier. And I<br/>
also took it that the poster lost it herself. She explained that wasn&#39;t the<br/>
case already. I do agree with you Sandra as to those motives.<br/>
<br/>
Alyssa loses a lot of pacifiers but only here in the house. We like to keep<br/>
two handy and she loses one a day if not both. The other day she had 3 of<br/>
them and by bedtime we were down to 1. She takes them out when she gets<br/>
interested in something and forgets where they are. Where she puts them is<br/>
the problem!!! Usually inside something. I always help her look for them and<br/>
I always keep spares here just in case. We&#39;re back to 2 again now. The new<br/>
one is still missing in action. There is also another one missing in this<br/>
house for about 6 months now. I figure we&#39;ll find a whole bunch if we ever<br/>
move!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>1) a kid can grow out of a binky, but a thumb you can&#39;t toss. When <br/>
Robby was two, and he saw his baby sister sucking a binky, I felt <br/>
like the time was right to ask him if he&#39;d like to toss his binky? He <br/>
did so, right on the spot. Didn&#39;t want to be like &quot;the baby&quot;. Well, <br/>
bedtime came, and he wanted his binky...walked over to the garbage <br/>
can...(It had not gone out yet)...and I said &quot;You threw it away, <br/>
remember?&quot; and he looked a bit sad for a moment, then said &quot;oh yeah.&quot; <br/>
and looked in there, saw the binky...left it there. And did just fine <br/>
without it. Other than that few minutes, he didn&#39;t display any <br/>
anxiety about it at all. Never looked back, so to speak. If he&#39;d <br/>
needed it, I&#39;d have given it back to him, but he did great without it.<br/>
<br/>
2) I tried with all four of my kids to get them to suck their thumbs, <br/>
so we wouldn&#39;t have to buy binkies, but it never worked. It was <br/>
easier to pop a pacifier in there, than try to get their little jerky <br/>
hands to their mouths, and thumbs out, to boot! What DID mothers do, <br/>
before the modern pacifier was invented...<br/>

No harm done Nichole! :)<br/>
<br/>
To answer your question, for me, it was the humiliation Nicholette felt <br/>
about her teeth.  Not from us, but from strangers, friends and even some <br/>
family members.  I never had a problem with pacifiers until then.  I still <br/>
struggle.  On the one hand, they *are* a comfort.  On the other, they have <br/>
inadvertantly caused my own child a lot of emotional pain as a result of the <br/>
physical damage done by them.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is what you were looking for.<br/>

&gt;&gt;When do you think would be the best time to do that?<br/>

<br/>

If there are any issues like this, you could bring them up in a calm, pro/con way, acknolowdging that there is one real pro - comfort.<br/>
<br/>
My sister (who&#39;s parenting I don&#39;t always or even often agree with, but this one seemed alright) had a conversation with her daughter thumb sucker who is now 16 about the age of 4.  My sister said she was worried about if daughter&#39;s teeth would be affected by the thumb sucking.  They came up with the plan that daughter would stop sucking her thumb when her first front tooth fell out.  I think my niece was 7 (I know some are younger and your son might already have lost his, I don&#39;t know) when that happened and she did stop.  She had many years of knowing that was the goal and had no problem with it.  By-the-by, though, she did still sleep with her special blanket even after stopping the thumb sucking.<br/>

&gt; My daughter never used one. My son now 1 uses one sometimes when I lay him <br/>
&gt; down. He thinks of them more a toy that actually having a function to soothe. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My first never used one either. I think because I nursed they never took to <br/>
&gt; them. I also have various kinds so when he goes to bed its never a special <br/>
