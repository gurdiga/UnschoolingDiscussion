<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318990041">According to my son&#39;s friend, from whom we borrowed the Nintendo <br/>
64. :)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your mom is SO cool! She plays computer games!&quot; I was giving Sonic a <br/>
spin. Sonic&#39;s on the computer, not the Nintendo, and I was dinking <br/>
around with it, and the kids SAID that. (I&#39;ve discovered that the 3-D <br/>
computer games give me motion sickness!L)<br/>
<br/>
His mom told me he was never so motivated to get his schoolwork done <br/>
(they do school-at-home) as when he knew he could come over as soon <br/>
as it was done. And I wondered about it, right away.<br/>
<br/>
He hustled through the hoops as fast as he could, and got that work <br/>
done...but I had to wonder, what did he learn? Maybe he learned that, <br/>
if he gets his work done quickly, he&#39;ll have time for what he wants <br/>
to do. <br/>
<br/>
Made me a bit sad, actually. He&#39;s a cool kid, and he &quot;knows&quot; a lot, <br/>
but what he knows isn&#39;t really part of him. <br/>

<br/>
He learned that the freedom he has at your house is so worthwhile that <br/>
he&#39;s willing to put a lot of effort to get the payoff of having more <br/>
time at your house.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So, okay he was doing his assigned work in a slapdash fashion.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think doing it very carefully and ponderously would have been a great <br/>
thing either. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If more kids had the opportunity to speed up their &quot;school day&quot; and have <br/>
a life afterwards, that would be a good thing.  (But not as good as <br/>
unschooling all day, which I think was your underlying point.)<br/>
