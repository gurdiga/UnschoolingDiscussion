<div id="ygrps-yiv-297599617">I think when people ask theoretical questions, it&#39;s usually new people<br/>
testing the waters here.  They&#39;d like to know if we&#39;re all nuts.  How far do<br/>
these people go, they&#39;re wondering.  If they go This Far, I&#39;m turning around<br/>
and won&#39;t be back.  However, they&#39;re thinking, if these people&#39;s views on<br/>
the subject allow for safety concerns that concern the poster then they can<br/>
relax and listen more.  It&#39; seems to be a litmus test.  Of course they could<br/>
stick around and read longer but I imagine this helps people do just that.<br/>

for free.<br/>
If they don&#39;t have real questions, they can just read quietly or go somewhere <br/>
else, in my personal opinion.<br/>
<br/>
My kids haven&#39;t been tested, and I don&#39;t feel like being tested.  I&#39;m being <br/>
open and honest already.  <br/>

I&#39;m test-resistent. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

If I could make a living taking standardized tests, I would have a DAMNED <br/>
fine car.  But that&#39;s not what we&#39;re doing here.<br/>
