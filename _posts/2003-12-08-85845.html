I would be less than thrilled if I had just expressed blatant frustration and <br/>
my husband put on the &quot;you little schnookums&quot; voice and said &quot;I hear that <br/>
you&#39;re frustrated...&quot;<br/>
*****************************<br/>
A long, long time ago (in a faraway universe), my then-husband (Julian&#39;s dad) <br/>
and I were both working in a day care center. We knew we were in trouble <br/>
when, while having a fight, one or the other of us would say, &quot;That&#39;s not okay!&quot;<br/>
