Your story of missing school to see Dad (horrors!) reminded me of a trip we <br/>
have coming up around here.  We are scheduled to go to PA for a wedding in <br/>
the fall, and plan to stretch that to a few extra days in the NY/NJ area.  <br/>
Before we started hsing at the end of this past yer, I had it in the back of <br/>
my mind that I was going to have to explain this 1-2 week absence to someone. <br/>
 Not anymore!!!!!!  <br/>
