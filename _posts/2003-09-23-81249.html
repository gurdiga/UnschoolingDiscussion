First of all I don&#39;t know of anyone who was ever asked to see their high<br/>
school diploma when going for a job. It may happen but I would think it&#39;s<br/>
not the norm. But why not give yourself a name. Something schooly or fun or<br/>
crazy or very family appropriate. The print up a diploma on the puter. Make<br/>
it as simple, fancy, extensive as your son wants. Why not??? Works for me<br/>
and it sounds like that would work well for you son too.<br/>

school considered sufficient to pass their standards. They aren&#39;t issued by<br/>

approval.<br/>
<br/>
Accredited schools, of course, have their standards set and watched over by<br/>
the government or some official group, so someone can check to see what the<br/>
diploma of an accredited school is supposed to mean, eg, 4 years of math.<br/>
But what &quot;4 years of math&quot; means is harder to quantify which is why<br/>
standardized tests are so popular. (At least in MA they were originally set<br/>
up to make sure the teachers were having the effect expected of them. *That*<br/>
didn&#39;t last long :-/)<br/>
<br/>
But ultimately diplomas don&#39;t mean much at all. If you agree that your son<br/>
has done sufficient to graduate then you can issue him a diploma.<br/>

homeschooled. If he decides to take a course at a community college, he can<br/>
check off &quot;some college&quot; on applications. It&#39;s helpful to look at what a<br/>
company would like to see in an employee. They don&#39;t really care that<br/>
someone has a high school diploma so much as they care about someone having<br/>
what a diploma represents. A college may expect a certain body of knowledge<br/>
to build from. And a diploma represents that. But it isn&#39;t the only way to<br/>
get it. Companies that want a high school diploma are not really looking for<br/>
a high school diploma -- do they really care that someone stuck it out long<br/>
enough to sit through reading and hearing about the Battle of Waterloo ;-)<br/>
What they&#39;re trying to eliminate are the kids who dropped out of high school<br/>
because within that group are those who are substance abusers and people who<br/>
are chafing at 9-5 routines and people who chafe at assembly line work and<br/>
so on.<br/>

will the &quot;official&quot; seal of the Commonwealth.  What is required for <br/>
graduation is mandated by the State.  There are presently (unless they changed it in <br/>
the last year or two) three different diplomas one can work towards for <br/>
graduation.<br/>
<br/>
There are online sources where you can order a High School diploma that looks <br/>
just like one that is issued at the schools, just doesn&#39;t have a State Seal <br/>
on it.  Comes in a nice leather folder and all.  Looks the same as the PS <br/>
version, you even get the small laminated versions to go along with it just like in <br/>
the Public Schools.<br/>
<br/>
If you want something tangible to frame or keep as a keepsake you can just <br/>
order one up.  They are like fifty or sixty dollars for the &quot;deluxe&quot; version <br/>
with the calligraphy and leather folder and miniatures.  You could also make one <br/>
on the computer for much less money.<br/>
<br/>
I know the community colleges in my area do not require transcripts nor a GED <br/>
to begin classes, so that is where my daughter plans on starting when she <br/>
turns 16 in the spring.<br/>

My younger son, Jon, had no diploma--we didn&#39;t bother with Clonlara that<br/>
time--but he moved to Austin, TX at 18 and a couple months, got several<br/>
(over time) good jobs, started going to college, and bought a house<br/>
before he turned 21.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get an actual high school diploma without actually going to school right? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a diploma from an accredited school.<br/>
But there are non-accredited private schools and always have been, so if you <br/>
make up a diploma it won&#39;t be any worse than one from a private school which <br/>
is not accredited.  In my experience, many Christian schools are not accredited <br/>
because they refuse to fulfill state requirements.  Still, they issue <br/>
diplomas.<br/>
<br/>
The right answer to &quot;Is this an accredited high school?&quot; is &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico (and other places, but maybe not all other places) the GED now <br/>
gets a diploma from the State.  It&#39;s a high school diploma issued by the state <br/>
of New Mexico, and is as good (legally speking) as from an accredited high <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
But my preference by far is the &quot;some college&quot; option, and writing <br/>
&quot;homeschooled&quot; on the high school line (of the hypothetical application form).<br/>

<br/>
I think it depends on the job.  I was hired to do test-scoring this <br/>
past year (scoring state proficiency tests) and they had to see the <br/>
diploma or else I had to pay for full transcripts.  That was because <br/>
their contracts with various states required degreed employees to <br/>
score those idiot tests.  Go figure.  But for many other jobs, of <br/>
course, no one is going to bother to check.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter just applied for a job at the library, a very good job <br/>
for a 16-year-old with better than average pay and very flexible <br/>
hours, (plus a great learning environment and a chance to meet cute <br/>
guys who come to the library).  They required references and they <br/>
actually phoned and checked with each one!  And they also require a <br/>
drug test.  Since she is home educated they did not require any <br/>
school references, however.  But the head librarian made an <br/>
interesting comment to my daughter about homeschoolers; something to <br/>
the effect that they usually do not do as well on the qualifying test <br/>
as public schoolers. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many homeschoolers have applied for jobs there?  The <br/>
qualifying test, by the way, had to do with putting books in order as <br/>
they would be placed on the shelves under the Dewey Decimal System.  <br/>
So the student has to know how to read the numbers and letters coded <br/>
on the books from the Dewey Decimal System.  This is not rocket <br/>
science, but apparently quite a few home educators do not bother to <br/>
teach their kids how the DDS works and how books are to be found on <br/>
the shelves.  Might be something to organize with a group of <br/>
homeschoolers at your local library. <br/>
<br/>
For those teens who are college bound that diploma or GED really do <br/>
not matter anymore.  The colleges that are homeschool friendly just <br/>
want a good detailed transcript.  And they want details about the <br/>
activities in which the student has participated.  That is way <br/>
important for homeschoolers.  They may require an essay and some will <br/>
require test scores, but not all.  They may also want letters of <br/>
recommendation.  So it really pays to shop around.  And there are <br/>
other ways to get college degrees these day that do not require ever <br/>
stepping foot in a college classroom, but still yield a solid fully <br/>
accredited 4-year college degree.  Check out Brad Voeller&#39;s book, <br/>
Accelerated Distance Learning, and his Global Learning Strategies <br/>
website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.globallearningstrategies.org/">http://www.globallearningstrategies.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
After reading his book I figured out that you could, theoretically at <br/>
least, get a fully accredited 4-year degree for under $700 by taking <br/>
three GRE tests at $130 a piece and earning credit for 5 other <br/>
courses through CLEP or portfolio presentation or military exams or <br/>
credit by examination.  The total for this could be as low as $700 <br/>
for the highly motivated self-directed learner.  Amazine!  And he has <br/>
so many great idea for different ways to do this that truly anyone <br/>
who wants a college degree should be able to get one.  And these are <br/>
good degrees, not just papermills.<br/>
