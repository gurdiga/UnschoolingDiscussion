&lt;&lt; Has anyone else been sent this site on an email??  Who thinks up this <br/>
stuff anyway?!  This and the ads on the radio for the videos that teach <br/>
manners.....geez - when will people get it that if they just live and love with their <br/>
kids these things are not a problem!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read through it.  Seems aimed more at people with foster kids or already <br/>
troubled kids.<br/>
<br/>
It occurs to me that some of the STERLING and really wonderful advice we <br/>
share here amongst ourselves would just be an irritation in a family in which <br/>
things have gotten SO screwed up that the kids can think of nothing much but <br/>
revenge or running away.    And in such places, if a kid is placed in a home and <br/>
that&#39;s the last stop before reform school or the street, it MIGHT be that <br/>
behavior modification is their very best hope of living together without violence <br/>
(in word and thought, if not all out).<br/>
