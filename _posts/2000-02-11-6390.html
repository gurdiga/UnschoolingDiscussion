(which I definitely did). Then when its time to be at home with the kids,<br/>

superwomen at home.  Just a theory.<br/>

much anyway, so when the time came to give up work, money was not an<br/>
issue.  I finally figured out that I missed the actual work, the attention<br/>
and the status.  When I figured this out, it became easier for me to make<br/>
decisions.  <br/>

I hope this makes sense, Wini<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102012970">I am a potter--my dh and I have a pottery studio/art gallery. I have not<br/>
been  working in the studio for a year.  I used to try to do it all--make<br/>
stuff,  do kids, , do the house. One November day(gray in NE Ohio), I found<br/>
myself sitting at the kitchen table, with newspapers, dishes, stuff, and my<br/>
energy piled up all over the place--we had been out all day and had arrived<br/>
home at about 6pm.  There i was, sipping Rescue Remedy, and realizing that<br/>
that was nuts!!!  I din&#39;t need to do it all. So my husband and I decided<br/>
that her would do the studio/business unlesss something was going to cost a<br/>
lot of money--then we&#39;d decide together--and i would do the home stuff. then<br/>
2 yrs ago my mother and grandmother were very ill at the same time(and died<br/>
within 5 weeks of each other).So that became our focus for a while.<br/>
 We often talk about parenting as the most important &quot;job&quot;--that years from<br/>
now, no one will care about the business--but the legacy of healthy kids<br/>
will endure.   Do I miss working in the studio? Sure I do at times.  But<br/>
I&#39;ve tried crazy and I don&#39;t like it at all.  My daughter and I made a<br/>
porcelain tile last year, which we called Generations--it represented the 4<br/>
generations of women that we had had in the family.  I&#39;d like to do moreo of<br/>
this kind of thing with my kids.<br/>
  Today we&#39;re going to an coop--I&#39;m going to explore hands-on art history<br/>
with a bunch of kids.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Do you think it&#39;s more &quot;natural&quot; for women to feel this<br/>
&gt; &gt;way than men?  Why is that?  Is it because we&#39;re programmed as caregivers<br/>
&gt; &gt;and fixers-of-whatever&#39;s-wrong from the time we&#39;re small?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-64183012">I&#39;m Sandra.  My children have never been in school and  are 1, 3, 5 and 7.<br/>
Before I had children I was such a careerist. I spent a decade in film and<br/>
tv production. I&#39;ve spent the last 8 years pregnant or nursing.  I&#39;m now<br/>
finding myself feeling ready to move back out into the world more. My older<br/>
children are starting to feel that way too I think. I&#39;ve put wordly<br/>
ambitions on the back burner and I&#39;m starting to feel like the walls of<br/>
this house are closing in on me at times.  (Could be the end of winter<br/>
cabin fever too)  I&#39;m now wondering if there is a way to begin stepping<br/>
back out into the world more as a family. Kind of like the Partridge<br/>
Family. Either through a family buisness or project that can serve others. <br/>
<br/>
        <br/>
We are all musically inclinded, my husband&#39;s a physician, my background is<br/>
in media and the healing arts.  So we&#39;ll have to see what evolves as our<br/>
family grows.  Are there any stories out there of families out there<br/>
living/working/learning together in freedom? <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you. And thanks for all the valuable<br/>
information and support through this list.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Sandra Greenstone<br/>
<br/>
PS. My husband and I just wrote a book called &quot;Healing at Home&quot;  that is<br/>
accompanied by a  companion  Healing Kit. We wrote it to help famlies like<br/>
our/yours become more self reliant and empowered in the healing process<br/>
combining alternative and conventional medicine. If your interested go to<br/>
www.antrhopress.org or www.amazon.com.  Take care.</div>
