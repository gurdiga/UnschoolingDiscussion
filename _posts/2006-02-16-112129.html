<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919879829">My MIL gave dd this book for her birthday last summer along with a set of<br/>
beautiful nesting dolls that were painted exactly like the ones in the book.<br/>
MIL is from Estonia and the illustrations reminded her of her girlhood. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is a sweet book called The Littlest Matryoshka, it is about<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the smallest sister in a set of Russian nesting dolls, she gets<br/>
<br/>
&gt; knocked off of the shelf in a toy store, gets washed down a gutter,<br/>
<br/>
&gt; buried by snow, picked up by a heron, etc. The rest of the sisters<br/>
<br/>
&gt; are bought by a little girl (for cheap, since the set is incomplete)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; who loves them. The littlest sister eventually makes her way to the<br/>
<br/>
&gt; little girl and reunites with her sisters. Very sweet story.<br/>
