&gt;As all in life, there is a continuum from one extreme to another.  I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t believe that seeing an occasional act of violence on TV will turn<br/>
&gt;someone into an ax murderer, but what possible good can come from seeing<br/>
&gt;hours of TV violence or reading lots of violent stories?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband loves &quot;action flicks&quot; and horror movies. Blood, gore,<br/>
decapitations -- bring &#39;em on. I don&#39;t know what possible good he gets from<br/>
them, but I know when it comes down to it, he remains a good man -- kind,<br/>
compassionate, not prone to violence.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I take it back -- I suspect what &quot;good&quot; comes from it in his case<br/>
is a chance to vent. Is it healthy? He appears healthy. He has made solid<br/>
and lasting relationships. Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck... is a<br/>
duck. Looks healthy, acts healthy... is healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Now me, I hate horror movies and can only tolerate action movies by covering<br/>
my eyes during the violent scenes until Wally taps me on the shoulder and<br/>
says, &quot;it&#39;s over&quot;. I don&#39;t appear to be less violent than he is. Not more<br/>
so, but not less.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s easy to blame television, but I don&#39;t feel &quot;desensitized&quot; in<br/>
the least. I ache on those few occasions I witness real-life violence. So<br/>
does my husband, though it&#39;s fun for him to watch Mel Gibson get beat up by<br/>
the bad guys and win the day in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Reality is reality, fantasy is fantasy, and when the twain meet, I look to<br/>
the character and health of the individual, not to the medium whether that&#39;s<br/>
television, radio, books, fireside songs or racial memory.<br/>
