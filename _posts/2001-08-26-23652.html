<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819522695">For those that were interested in more info, or who live within driving<br/>
distance of Phoenix, here is a nationally recognized museum that currently<br/>
has an exhibit that provides more verification about the whole boarding<br/>
school episode in the U.S.&#39;s history and documents that the first thing that<br/>
happened to the children was that their hair was cut!<br/>

PHOENIX (AP) -- It&#39;s the hair you remember, long after you&#39;ve left the<br/>
museum -- the strands of ebony piled around the barber&#39;s chair, some still<br/>
tightly braided.<br/>
When American Indians were forced to attend federally operated boarding<br/>
schools beginning in 1879, their long hair was lopped off immediately upon<br/>
arrival as part of the effort to &quot;civilize&quot; the natives. It was one of the<br/>
most devastating acts of the boarding school experience.</div>

length codes&quot;. Boys hair must be above the collar and<br/>
above the ears. Uniforms are becoming more popular,<br/>
too. <br/>

Same thing in Okinawa to &quot;modernize&quot;--and Samurai descendents were not to <br/>
have their hair cut.  The founder of the karate school Kirby goes to wrote an <br/>
autobiography, and confesses without much joy to having physically subdued <br/>
boys so their hair could be cut off.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think in either case they cut the girls&#39; hair, but I could be wrong <br/>
about the Indian boarding schools and female-haircuts, and I don&#39;t think <br/>
there were girls in the Okinawan schools.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559951326">I want to give my boys karate classes for christmas. How did all of you<br/>
find good teachers/ schools? What kind of questions did you ask? What should<br/>
I look for? And last but not least, how can I present it as a surprise?<br/>
Should I keep it secret or have them check thing out and chose??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307486960">My son had asked for karate lessons a year  before we found the<br/>
instructor we liked.<br/>
We went into it completely ignorant of martial arts.  We were lucky to<br/>
find such an amazing instructor.<br/>
You should attend a few classes without your boys, if you can.  Watch to<br/>
see if the older kids use self control when sparring with the younger<br/>
kids.  Do they have protective gear for the little kids.  Does the<br/>
instructor stress the point of self control?  Is one of the rules of the<br/>
dojo respect?  How do the students treat each other?  How is the<br/>
instructor with the other kids your boy&#39;s ages?  Do girls and boys spar<br/>
each other?  If not there may be and unconscious ( or not ) feeling by<br/>
the instructor that girls are not able to fight as well as boys, etc. and<br/>
do you want your boys to get this message?  Your observations will tell<br/>
you more than I ever could.  If you feel good about the teacher and feel<br/>
he/she genuinely likes and respects the kids, then he/she&#39;s the one.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of martial arts,  The harmonious development and eventual<br/>
perfection of human character.<br/>
<br/>
I was worried that my unschooling kid would have a hard time with a<br/>
regimented class.  <br/>
He didn&#39;t .  The hardest thing for him to remember was to raise his hand<br/>
before asking or answering a question, and having to ask to use the<br/>
restroom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035792145">All the schools cut hair on both boys and girls.  The degree of cutting the<br/>
hair of the girls differed from school to school.  At some point in history,<br/>
the guy who started the boarding schools must have read some history book on<br/>
the Chinese and the &quot;strength&quot; of the &quot;pigtail&quot; and converted that thinking<br/>
to apply to the American Indian children.  Some tribes had braids for both<br/>
boys and girls and it was those children, both boys and girls, who were<br/>
given the shortest hair cuts, the enfamous &quot;Buster Brown&quot; bowl cuts.<br/>
<br/>
After the first few years, the extremely short hair cuts for girls were<br/>
predominately used on the younger girls.  It is a little hard to see but if<br/>
you look at the younger girls in the &quot;after&quot; picture for the Apaches, you<br/>
can see that the two younger girls have very short hair.<br/>

<br/>
Later, most of the schools stopped cutting the girls hair really short but<br/>
they still were forced into &quot;white&quot; hair styles.  Two braids hanging in<br/>
front of the shoulders or long flowing hair were an absolute no no.  And,<br/>
those who have &quot;straight as a stick&quot; hair will understand the futility of<br/>
tying their hair up in rags or using curling irons.<br/>
<br/>
My aunt remembers one little girl that would cry herself to sleep every<br/>
night because she knew in the morning she would be punished because her hair<br/>
wouldn&#39;t curl.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669928203">Hi Barb<br/>
<br/>
Your boys do have to want to take karate, the lessons<br/>
might be gift that they don&#39;t want.  It is a<br/>
discipline, not a sport. However, one of the best<br/>
things about that is that with your practice you can<br/>
only get better and stronger. Even little bits of<br/>
practice!<br/>
<br/>
Make sure bogu (protective gear) is worn by EVERYONE <br/>
who spars, not just little kids. Little kids shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be participating in REAL sparring anyway. They just<br/>
learn bad habits and incorrect techniques if they do,<br/>
and maybe get the VERY DANGEROUS idea that they<br/>
(little kids) can actually FIGHT an large-size person.<br/>
We grownups are supposed to be vigilant so that little<br/>
kids never have need for such skills.<br/>
<br/>
Other listers said &#39;most everything else.<br/>
