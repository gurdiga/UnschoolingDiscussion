<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943237300">This was in a post from last January - I have something new to add to <br/>
it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I just recommended it &lt;Strunk and White&#39;s &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;&gt; to <br/>
Roya. She is a creative writer - an<br/>
outstanding writer. But her academic essays could be more polished and <br/>
she makes up the punctuation rules as she goes along, doesn&#39;t really <br/>
know why she makes the choices she does.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She never looked at it. Didn&#39;t have time. She DID write quite a few <br/>
papers for her college courses throughout the semester. She asked for <br/>
some proofreading and editing occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
She took the &quot;Writing Proficiency Exam&quot; that is required of all <br/>
students at her university. It gets scored by three professors - she <br/>
just got her scores. Each professor scores out of 6 points and she got <br/>
two 6&#39;s and one 5 for 17 out of 18 possible points.<br/>
<br/>
So - I guess her &quot;intuitive approach&quot; works pretty well. Never had a <br/>
single grammar, punctuation, writing, or spelling lesson.<br/>
