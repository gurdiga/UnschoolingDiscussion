<div id="ygrps-yiv-985427191">Hi all,<br/>
I just wanted to make a comment for future reference.  Because breastmilk is <br/>
so easily digest.  It is considered clear liquid.  I have read that once the <br/>
doctors find this out they lift the &quot;no nursing&quot; or make it &quot;no nursing for <br/>
2hrs before the surgery&quot;.  I am sorry I didn&#39;t realise you daughter was <br/>
having surgery, or I would have said something sooner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453745501">I had always been told that too, but the said it wasn&#39;t. It&#39;s so frustrating<br/>
that doctor&#39;s don&#39;t know about such things. What is really strange is that<br/>
it&#39;s only supposed to be clear liquids after the sugery too, but they said<br/>
breastmilk is ok then. UGH!. All doctors should be lactation consultants<br/>
too. Thank god my pediatritian is up on it and ok with the extended nursing<br/>
too. Then again, she hs too. What more could onw want.<br/>
