Kerry, What a meanie! :-)  Actually, we have a &#39;99 Expedition. But hear me <br/>
out. I bought it because we have four kids and their friends to cart around. <br/>
The alternatives were a Mercedes SUV and a minivan. I wasn&#39;t even 30 yet. I <br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly be expected to drive a minivan! Sorry, that&#39;s probably <br/>
terribly offensive to someone since we all have our sensitive skin on. In <br/>
reality, I applaud your simple living philosophy. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever <br/>
get there as a family unless we&#39;re forced to. I did live that way by economic <br/>
necessity many years ago, so I recognize both the challenges and rewards.  <br/>

&quot;<br/>
 It just seems silly to me to drive a vehicle that<br/>
GUZZLES gasoline when we are in short supply and the<br/>
price is so high. I know you have your reasons for<br/>
owning one, and I&#39;m not trying to put you down.<br/>
Besides, judging from your choices(all $20,000 and<br/>
up), you dont have the same concerns we do in our<br/>
family. (money)<br/>

I am with you! We are pagan as well. I actually was trying to keep it<br/>
quite to let people get to know me first but a woman went and told most<br/>
everyone in my old town and well it got ugly fast living in  New England<br/>
where some towns like to boost where they use to hang and drown the<br/>
witches in the old days. My worst expierance which has made me afraid to<br/>
go to things was I replied to a letter in Mothering Magazine and asked<br/>
if there were any pagan homeschoolers out there. I got some great<br/>
letters and have some wonderful penpals from it but...later I got a<br/>
phone call from a local homeschooling mom and an invitation to come up<br/>
to thier house later that afternoon. Seems it was come see the Pagan day<br/>
and try to convert her. I was so hurt from it and my kids were really<br/>
upset. I have friends who are christian and we all get along and don&#39;t<br/>
try to convert each other but this just really pushed me back into my<br/>
little shell for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Expeditions...gees those things are huge and if you can drive<br/>
one more power to you. My dh calls me his little tree hugging hindu<br/>
kitchen witch. Well he just recently bought a Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer<br/>
Edition. I am against things like this but he wanted a truck to tow a<br/>
small boat or to go to the home improvement store to pick up his lumber<br/>
since he builds furniture in his spare time. I have been giving him such<br/>
a time about calling him yuppie and all but well he loves his new (used)<br/>
truck and I have to admit...it is fun to drive. I have to say one of the<br/>
most wonderful women I have met who was into many of the same things I<br/>
am actually lives in this fancy old house and her and her husband have<br/>
his and hers Mercedes.  Tossed my thinking for a bit of a whirl. *L*<br/>

by flaunting it or just trying to be like someone else and buying what they <br/>
have to measure up)- and helping ourselves and others with it, having money <br/>
is good, and should get us the things we want. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539742741">Kerry, we have a Mercury Mountaineer (Ford Explorer sized vehicle), and I <br/>
struggle with the ethics of it because it is a gas guzzler. However, we <br/>
bought it two years ago to tow a small camper trailer which we use in the <br/>
summer and for long trips. You can&#39;t pull anything with a Geo, which we had <br/>
before, and marginally with a van. The struggle comes from wanting to be <br/>
more ecologically-minded and live more mindfully, and still go &quot;camping&quot;. I <br/>
know some people would say to use a tent instead of a trailer, and that RVs <br/>
are not mindful. Well, my husband is not a tent-camper and never will be; <br/>
the trailer actually encourages us to use less while travelling because it <br/>
has small waste tanks and you can&#39;t carry much. The other alternative for <br/>
travel would be to stay in a hotel, which is hard with a dog. Plus, <br/>
building a hotel requires cutting out huge chunks of ecosystem: we have <br/>
watched as my town has allowed an entire hill to be denuded in order to <br/>

we didn&#39;t have the camper, we would immediately sell the SUV.<br/>

ways, because we use less &quot;stuff&quot; than the average American by far. I would <br/>
love it if they could come out with a methane-powered or solar RV. Hey, DS <br/>
loves cars. I have been saying someday he will design and build one for us!<br/>
