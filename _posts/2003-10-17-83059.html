<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134617569">anyone else having this problem?<br/>
<br/>
when I want to respond to a specific post, I click on &quot;reply&quot; and get <br/>
a reply dialogue box, and type in my eloquent, pithy, wise comments<br/>
<br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
then click &quot;send&quot;<br/>
<br/>
then get a &quot;Can&#39;t access this page&quot; page.<br/>
<br/>
When I post directly to the messages, not as a reply but as my own <br/>
post (a la &quot;to tia&quot;)...it goes through okay.<br/>
<br/>
help? I CAN&#39;T do this list on my email, it&#39;d fry my minimal (free) <br/>
KB&#39;s for sure, as much as you folks like to POST around here :) I <br/>
gotta get on via the website, not email.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I used free juno internet/email for a long time and never exceeded any limits.  I liked the ability to sign on to the internet just long enough to download email, then I could read and write email at my leisure while off-line.  I know this list gets busy sometimes, but I can&#39;t imagine it exceeding any limits.  In fact, the limits I did have with juno related to how much time I could spend on-line, not how many emails I received.<br/>
<br/>
What is your KB limit?  The email of yours that I&#39;m replying to was 4 KB.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818191068">I&#39;m not smart enough to know how to fix your problem, but until you find<br/>
out, could you copy and paste the post you&#39;re responding to your e-mail<br/>
write screen and go from there?<br/>
<br/>
Not as convenient as having your reply automatically addressed but you&#39;d<br/>
get the benefits of spell check that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762141606">Yahoo just started glitching like this a few days ago.<br/>
Hopefully, they will have it fixed soon.  In the meantime-<br/>
type your email, copy & paste the reply into post.<br/>
Be sure to copy the Subject line and add your own re:  <br/>
if needed.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to only happen when you click on reply.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538692991">mine is hotmail, and I have 2 megabytes, and I&#39;ve gotten really close <br/>
to overdoing it, in the past, with a quite a bit slower list that <br/>
does come to my email. Like &quot;we&#39;re sending them back, because you&#39;re <br/>
too close to your limit&quot;<br/>
<br/>
now, I hope THIS one goes...<br/>
