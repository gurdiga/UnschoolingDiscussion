Here&#39;s a page that might get her back in the spirit:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyfun.go.com/crafts/buildmodel/feature/famf0100coldhouse/famf">http://familyfun.go.com/crafts/buildmodel/feature/famf0100coldhouse/famf</a><br/>
0100coldhouse.html .  It&#39;s not an igloo, but it&#39;s a fun snow fort.   We<br/>
bought cheap rectangular molds for our igloo making.  Nothing&#39;s caved in<br/>
on us yet.  Once she gets it made you can stock it with snowballs that<br/>
might accidently hit unsuspecting dream squashers as they walk by :0).<br/>

I will suit up and show her how I used to do it (if I can remember <br/>
how) and to protect her from all those people who would squash igloo <br/>
building attempts...<br/>
