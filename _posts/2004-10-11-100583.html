<div id="ygrps-yiv-141306072">Marty and I went to Pecos, New Mexico yesterday for a tour of the Glorieta <br/>
battlefield.  It was a van tour with a national parks volunteer, and we stopped <br/>
five places, where the soldiers had come and gone and met and run away over <br/>
three days&#39; time back then.  It was very cool.<br/>
<br/>
The tourguide was glad to know more, and two things were brought up he hadn&#39;t <br/>
thought of or known, and he told us a couple of things that aren&#39;t in books, <br/>
and it was just altogether inspiring and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I have been planning to go to Silver City (far SW N.Mex) and I was <br/>
looking at websites of historical sites in that area, and in a page on a <br/>
little town called Columbus, I found the following paragraph which I liked:<br/>
<br/>
-=- No write-up on Columbus  would be complete without a nod to Mrs. Susan <br/>
Parks Kendrick. On the morning of the famous raid, Mrs. Parks, a telephone <br/>
operator in Columbus, called for help and alerted several residents of the danger <br/>
from her switchboard. The switchboard is on display in the Columbus Museum, <br/>
only a few feet away from Pancho Villa&#39;s death mask -- two items one would never <br/>
expect to find in a room together. The distance between any two dissimilar <br/>
objects - like the border between two countries - can sometimes be remarkably <br/>
thin. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The author of that, David Pike, has a nice site on ghost towns in New Mexico. <br/>
 His writing style is sweet.<br/>

<br/>
But that reminded me of the whole exercise Thinking Sticks involves, which is <br/>
tying together disparate ideas.   <br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re going to go sooner than we had planned, because there&#39;s a <br/>
historical reenactment in Shakespeare on October 23.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really enjoying these times with Marty.   We were worried from the <br/>
beginning that he might feel very &quot;middle child&quot; in his life because Kirby&#39;s dynamic <br/>
and Holly&#39;s cute and he&#39;s in the middle, and so by trying to remember to make <br/>
Marty&#39;s life special, I&#39;m afraid sometimes he&#39;s going to leave the other two <br/>
in the dust in a way or two.  Luckily Holly has no cowboy/19th century <br/>
interest, and Kirby has no touristish inclinations, so we can go without feeling <br/>
guilty!  We invited Holly yesterday to the civil war tour, but she clearly wanted <br/>
to stay home instead.  Ah, the virtue of offering and then hearing, &quot;I&#39;d <br/>
rather not, but thanks for inviting me!&quot;<br/>
