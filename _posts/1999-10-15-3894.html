    Just wanted to say I loved what you had to say and agree wholeheartedly.  <br/>
I tend to NOT be a great hands on person and used to work in PR/sales type <br/>
jobs back when I was in the working for money world.  Yet I always felt like <br/>
my jobs were kind of meaningless or worse, sometimes like a drain on society. <br/>
 I wasn&#39;t really making anything or servicing anything, just another middle <br/>
person whose commission added to the price of a product or service.  However, <br/>
in helping with Matt&#39;s business, I use those PR skills to build up rapport <br/>
with customers and also some organizing ability to schedule jobs and make <br/>
sure people have ordered tile in time, etc., and NOW it seems worthwhile.<br/>
     There is something about hands-on jobs that seems more real.  I also <br/>
happen to be a lover of antiques and traditional architecture, which has <br/>
caused me to think about how much we love fine craftsmanship.  And I know <br/>
exactly what you mean about getting to meet and talk with a wide variety of <br/>
interesting people through your business.<br/>
     You are right on the mark about job security, as well.  People sometimes <br/>
think self employment is scary but we have found it to be so much more <br/>
reliable than many of the flakey companies we&#39;ve dealt with.  When I was in <br/>
sales, I worked for three  big remodeling companies in a row that went out of <br/>
business.  Matt had a &quot;solid reliable&quot; technical job when he first got out of <br/>
the Air Force.  One day he went to work and they said they had no more work <br/>
because they&#39;d lost their govenment contract and so they ended his position <br/>
on the spot.  <br/>
     I also hate the ridiculous &quot;tell me where you see yourself in five <br/>
years&quot; interviews that have nothing to do with who will be best at the job.  <br/>
The trades are so much more straight forward.  Your work speaks for itself.<br/>
     As for the money issue, some trades people make as much or more, <br/>
sometimes a lot more, than some of the college grad jobs.  And there is the <br/>
freedom to schedule yourself off when you want or need to rather than begging <br/>
for the time and hoping they don&#39;t hold it against you in the future.<br/>

be yourself and do the best you can.<br/>

I too loved your essay and it reminded me of the people who have come to<br/>
help me learn how to care for our new home.  (I&#39;ve lived in apartments all<br/>
my life and I have no clue re gardening, house stuff, etc. so I&#39;ve hired<br/>
people to come once to do some of the stuff so that I can learn how to do<br/>
it).  I&#39;ve had discussions with an artist about the paintings in our living<br/>
room and about mid-century modern furniture and flea markets around<br/>
here--the artist was repairing our thermostat; I&#39;ve learned so much about<br/>
trees and soil from the arborist who came out to show me how to prune the<br/>
stuff here, and the changing sociology of the area we live in (and a lot I<br/>
kind of didn&#39;t want to know about gun availability in NC) from a man who was<br/>
grinding down the stumps of fallen-over trees who also owned a gunshop.<br/>
<br/>
One further thought that comes to mind re your fabulous essay:  WHERE DO YOU<br/>
LIVE?  You must be a *great* carpet cleaner and we need our carpets cleaned!<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you lived in NC,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898218742">One other thing I thought about today:  I don&#39;t want to sound like I was <br/>
going too far to the other extreme on this issue.  My dad is a person who has <br/>
a natural gift for understanding and explaining history and philosophy.  He <br/>
never went to college and is retired from the Post Office.  My sister has a <br/>
B.A. in History and she says he knows a lot more history than she does.  <br/>
However, he has always felt inadequate because he is not at ALL mechanical or <br/>
construction oriented.  Maybe if he had the degree and had worked in those <br/>
fields it would be different (?) but at any rate, it really bothers him.  <br/>
    I think what it comes down to is that all types of learners should be <br/>
valued and that we should all find ways to do the things which seem to be the <br/>
right match for us at any given time.  My dad now works part time as a noon <br/>
duty aide at a middle school to supplement his retirement and although I&#39;m <br/>
not a public school fan, I have to say that he is making a great contribution <br/>
because he treats those kids with such a kind, reasonable attitude.  They <br/>
really like him.  He feels embarrassed at times about his job because it&#39;s <br/>
not prestigious and he has friends who are making a lot more money but I am <br/>
always telling him that what he&#39;s doing is really important for those kids.<br/>
    I think it&#39;s sad that so many of us feel inadequate because we focus too <br/>
much on which gifts we lack rather than on those that shine in us.  Also, we <br/>
need to get way past the idea that our talents are only utilized well if we <br/>
make a lot of money from them.  There are so many different ways to live <br/>
meaningfully.<br/>
