<div id="ygrps-yiv-443807475">Hello Everyone!<br/>
I am back from my vacation, and ready to dip into the New Year! (I vacationed <br/>
at home, but was online for under an hour per day!) <br/>
Just some news of the new millennium:<br/>
    Boris Yeltsin retired. He was a wonderful contribution to new Russia, and <br/>
I wonder what will happen to the country now.<br/>
    The terrorists that took an airplane overseas released all their <br/>
hostages. 155 of them. I have not read about what is happening, other than <br/>
they drove off and that the government okayed the release of the men they <br/>
were fighting for. One man (on his honeymoon) died, and I feel for him, as <br/>
well as his new bride/widow. That is indeed a tragedy in the folds. <br/>
    A woman in Allentown, PA. died 33 hours before seeing her THIRD century. <br/>
She died peacefully in a nursing home at age 119. WOW<br/>
    Australia and Hong Kong have both rang in the New Year. Both are reported <br/>
well and Y2K free (that is what they are saying)! <br/>
    AND... We have our FIRST BABY NEW MILLENNIUM! It is reported that a boy <br/>
is the first to be born in the New Millennium, at 12:01 in Auckland, New <br/>
Zealand! (6:01 EST)<br/>
    Well, that is what has happened to date. This century has been a very yo <br/>
yo one. We have seen a wall go up and come down. Miracles in medicine, <br/>
leaders, and faith. We have also watched peril, disease, war, and death. This <br/>
century will always be remembered, that is with certainty.<br/>
<br/>
    It is our prayer that everyone sees in the New Year without any mishaps.<br/>
<br/>
God Bless everyone- <br/>
