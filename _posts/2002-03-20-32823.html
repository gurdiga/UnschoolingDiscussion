Can you elaborate on this a bit? Or, do you have any book suggestions, or any other suggestions? I am really struggling with this right now too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254955595">I&#39;m not Bonni, but try &quot;Parenting with Love and Logic&quot;  By Cline and Fay.  They have a website too It&#39;s www.loveandlogic.com   The book is really well written and easy to read.  They advocate using natural consequences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508889055">Tia, here are some thoughts I came up with after considering your request<br/>
for elaboration.<br/>
<br/>
School at home was so meaningless to me, I always felt like I had failed<br/>
my son. I felt obligated to teach him what he was &quot;supposed&quot; to know, and<br/>
when he didn&#39;t learn I felt it was my fault. Still, it seemed like when<br/>
we were traveling or when I was ill my son learned more than when I had<br/>
&quot;my act together&quot;. It seemed to me that children learned things the same<br/>
way they learned to talk, on their own, when they were ready, and when<br/>
they had a good reason to. I had almost nothing to do with it. I kept<br/>
looking for information to show me what was going on. In the homeschool<br/>
section of the library I noticed a book whose cover I had been looking at<br/>
for years, but since I had no teens I hadn&#39;t read it.   (Grace<br/>
Llewellyn&#39;s book, The Teenage Liberation Handbook). After hearing the<br/>
word unschooling in that book, I looked it up on the net and found this<br/>
group. I&#39;ve also found books at the library and searched the net for<br/>
information that is helpful. One book that made a big impact was How To<br/>
Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk.<br/>
Not being controlling doesn&#39;t mean being out of control. <br/>
It means: <br/>
being free to be me and to feel and to think as I want without blaming<br/>
others;<br/>
letting others be and feel and think as they do without me feeling<br/>
responsible; <br/>
leading by gentleness and example rather than by harshness and coercion ;<br/>
speaking my mind without accusation or name calling; <br/>
searching for and learning new ways to live with others; <br/>
listening instead of demanding immediate compliance; <br/>
cooperating instead of commanding. <br/>
