Ds has issues about being touched at times.  So he has been adverse to <br/>
holding hands for a years.  He also has been a runner for a while. He thinks he is <br/>
initiating a game even though it has been explained to him many times about <br/>
safety, etc.  These and other challenges is why he had been in a full day special <br/>
needs program for the last two years.  What I meant to say was that it was a <br/>
BAD decision on my part to even try to bring him in a store like that.  I do <br/>
try to take him out even though his behaviors can be difficult.  Quite honestly <br/>
if I couldn&#39;t take him out unless he held my hand or consistently stayed by <br/>
me we wouldn&#39;t go out at all.  I will continue to try to look at the part I may <br/>
play in those dynamics (although he does exhibit similar behavior with <br/>
others.)  <br/>
