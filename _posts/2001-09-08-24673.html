What would it take to make the desserts a non-attraction? I know if I stuffed myself with them and got really OD&#39;d on sugar, I would probably not have any desire for more sweets for quite some time. (I can say this with confidence as I just *did* this over the holidays!).<br/>
So with tv, what would it take to make it a non-attraction? Some people are trying not having cable. Others are trying no tv in the house at *all*.  Still others are not setting any limits on tv to de-mystify it. In my house ( and speaking only for myself & family), I find that if I totally remove tv, then the first chance they get to *see* one, they&#39;re glued to it and fail to interact with the family we&#39;re visiting. So, we don&#39;t do tv limits for that reason.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378081024">I wanted to offer a bit of reassurance to those who are thinking of letting <br/>
go control of the TV. I used to limit TV strictly for my son -- an hour a <br/>
day or a video a day. He seemed to spend all his time begging for TV or a <br/>
video, as if sitting in front of the screen were the most sublime pastime a <br/>
person could ever wish for.  I was always saying &quot;no&quot; to TV. I had the same <br/>
attitude toward Nintendo (we didn&#39;t have one).<br/>
<br/>
Then I started reading on this unschooling list. I discovered a new attitude <br/>
toward TV, one that seemed to say that TV wasn&#39;t necessarily brain-rot. I <br/>
realized that some of the smartest, nicest kids I know had unlimited access <br/>
to TV and video games.  They don&#39;t spend all their time watching/playing. <br/>
And they never beg for TV. How much more pleasant a life.<br/>
<br/>
So now, watching TV and playing video games is my sons&#39; choice (I have two <br/>
boys now). They do watch, but I wouldn&#39;t say they watch a lot. They love to <br/>
draw, play ball, climb trees, take bubble baths, play board games like <br/>
&quot;Clue&quot; and &quot;Guess Who&quot; in front of the fire, cook simple foods, ride <br/>
scooter/skateboards/bikes, make up games outside. They love to be read to, <br/>
meanwhile drawing or playing legos.  They like to play with their cat and <br/>
guinea pigs. The 9yo likes to read, to himself and aloud to his brother.<br/>
<br/>
Today, they have had full continuous access to TV and video games any time <br/>
they wished. They have watched TV (nothing particularly &quot;worthwhile&quot;) and <br/>
played video games. They also have done all the things listed in the <br/>
paragraph above (along with meals, baths and a visit to a friend&#39;s house). <br/>
At the moment, because I wanted to look at my e-mail, the 9yo is on the <br/>
couch behind me writing a story on a laptop computer (&quot;Once there was a <br/>
mutant frog named Nicky...&quot;) and asking me how to spell words like laughed, <br/>
desert and knew, and the 4yo is playing a human-body game on another <br/>
computer (with our help). And there has been no begging for TV.<br/>
<br/>
I personally do not like most TV and I am baffled by video games. I can <br/>
sympathize with those who just don&#39;t like the racket in the background. But <br/>
I think this experiment has proven successful. I think that rationing TV <br/>
makes it seem more important or desirable than it otherwise would be.  And <br/>
some of the smartest and most successful adults I knew spent plenty of time <br/>
in front of the TV when they were kids.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share some of my experiences and also to thank other people <br/>
on this list who have opened my eyes to allowing kids to make their own <br/>
choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236991190">Annette - I just wanted to say that I loved your post. Your house sounds<br/>
almost exactly like mine. And you probably said better what I tried to say<br/>
earlier today about tv and the computer.<br/>
<br/>
I find that the less I limit about ANYTHING, the better it is for everybody.<br/>
Unless it has to do with obvious safety issues, we are all happier when I<br/>
say less &quot;no&quot; and more &quot;yes&quot;. I am really getting addicted to making my kids<br/>
happy. I try to be mindful of it. Because, when I do, I find that then, they<br/>
do things to make me happy. It&#39;s a wonderful cycle. And yes, I learned my<br/>
new attitude here and especially at unschooling.com.<br/>
Unschooling has truly changed our lives for the better.<br/>

The responses I got from most of the people on this list were regarding limits.  I agree with everyone that setting limits for or restricting our children can cause problems.  But, I think before we can come up with an answer for ourselves on what to do about TV, we need to answer the question- What is really wrong with TV anyway?  The book &quot;The Plug-In Drug: Television, Children, and the Family&quot; is listed under resources in Mary Griffith&#39;s book &quot;the unschooling handbook&quot; it is said to be a classic on why television is bad for children and for the family.  I have not read the book but I have come up with my own opinions.  Mainly the potential for the *over* exposure to outside influences that promote ideas that are destructive.  Ideas such as - happiness comes from buying things, that women should use their bodies to get what they want (instead of their minds), that there is no shame in promiscuity and sex is fun and there are no boundaries as long as it feels good.  My dh and I do use every opportunity to discuss  our values and to expose things on TV for what they are but I put too-much-TV in the same category as ps peer pressure.  I&#39;m afraid if there is *too much* exposure nothing I say will matter.  Which brings me to compare TV to ps.  In my mind there are similarities.  The children are captive audiences to some things that may influence them negatively.  Certainly there are many good things on TV as there can be some good things about ps.   Another thing that concerns me is the effect on the developing brain of a child.  Would the child&#39;s brain be better off (such as with breast milk) if there was a limit to TV exposure?  We have found that watching TV on the weekends only has worked for us.  The kids do not ask for TV all the time because they have found other things to do during the week and they do not miss it but they don&#39;t feel cheated either since they get to watch a fair amount.  Just with watching TV on the weekends (2-3 hrs. a night) my kids watch 4-6 hours a week.  That is still a lot but I think there is a balance.  Thanks for listening.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I definitely agree with you Dar.  I never talk about or offer my values <br/>
to my children unless it comes up in the form of an answer to one of <br/>
their question.  I don&#39;t like the idea of imposing my values upon my <br/>
children.  I like for them to figure things out for themselves.  I think <br/>
I offer them enough by modeling good behavior.  My values are shown by <br/>
my behavior and what I do as I live my life.  I don&#39;t need to teach them <br/>
values.<br/>

As far as TV is concerned, I think, if we are involved with out <br/>
children, we have much more of an ifluence on them than  TV does, no <br/>
matter how much they watch.  I don&#39;t restrict TV at all and don&#39;t really <br/>
feel a need to.<br/>

safety issue. Like letting your kids do drugs, or stay out all night, or<br/>
carry a weapon. Where does one draw the line, or does one?<br/>

BTW, Happy New Year to everyone; this is my first post to this list. We<br/>
homeschool here in Brooklyn, NY. Most of the people we hang out w/call<br/>
themselves unschoolers, but I don&#39;t really label myself as any one thing,<br/>
at this point (we&#39;ve been homeschooling for two years) I&#39;m open to<br/>
anything that works and am continually being surprised by son&#39;s<br/>
capabilities.<br/>

I guess it was your comment on how Bart Simpson is not educational <br/>
and that it&#39;s pure entertainment that caused me to post about tv.<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to explain how losing the word &quot;educational&quot; when <br/>
referring to a childs activities (even tv) limits them. If we are <br/>
fully supportive of any and all of our children&#39;s interests (barring <br/>
something truly destructive) it opens doors.<br/>
Labels like educational close doors.<br/>
YK?<br/>
Anyway, I think we understand each other.<br/>
And I&#39;m glad you had a Happy Birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Pat,<br/>
I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t take my post wrong.<br/>
I strive to be supportive, but I tend to be blunt at times.<br/>
I get frustrated when people pull these bizarre stories out of the <br/>
woodwork as though to equate unschoolers to negative outcomes.<br/>
A doesn&#39;t lead to B in this case.<br/>
We have to look at the variables.<br/>
Unschool parent&#39;s often get the finger pointed at them as though they <br/>
are neglectful also.<br/>
A neglectful family couldn&#39;t be more opposite from an unschooler that <br/>
gives their child freedom of choice.<br/>
I love something that was posted at another e-mail group about the <br/>
Buddha way of looking at it.<br/>
I can&#39;t write the whole thing because it&#39;s not in front of me but the <br/>
idea was that you don&#39;t ignore, you don&#39;t force, you are THERE. <br/>
Observing and aware, but letting the moment flow.<br/>
That is Unschooling to me.<br/>
Being aware, being involved. Not coercing and pushing your views.<br/>
I have such a hard time making it clear. Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
And thank you Karin for that Cheer!  That was sweet.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Out of context.  I&#39;m not interested in debating the positive aspects<br/>
 of using tv in place of time spent with another human being--if that&#39;s<br/>
 your bag with your kids, as I said, fine--that&#39;s not the issue I<br/>
 posted over.  I specifically mentioned that we don&#39;t have a tv so that<br/>
 we could talk about *other* suggestions, and yet that aspect is what<br/>
 has gotten the most response.  That&#39;s interesting. Is this list always<br/>
 this negative or do you ever see posts actually being answered in ways<br/>
 that are helpful to the poster? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the responses weren&#39;t negative. The only negative responses I read <br/>
are from you about tv and computer.<br/>
It&#39;s been proven to be detrimental to unschooling and to learning in general. <br/>
Maybe you could open your mind a little and see where your negative responses <br/>
are blocking the answers to some of your problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204423321">Ok, I am a hundred or so messages behind, but wanted to write a quick one. I used to <br/>
believe those studies about tv and we definitely limited it. What convinced me to <br/>
change my mind was realizing that the warnings to not let your kids watch more then<br/>
2 hrs/day were based on kids who were in school all day. Betw school and homework,<br/>
if kids were watching more then 2 hrs/day, they most likely were not doing much else.<br/>
For our kids, 2 hrs/day is really not much when you look at all the &quot;free&quot; time they<br/>
have. There is tons of time for them to do other things.<br/>
<br/>
We lifted restrictions on tv back in october and it has worked great. They definitely<br/>
watch more then the 1 hr/day I previously let them, but I have found that they<br/>
are now doing other things while watching (previously my oldest (6 yo) would<br/>
pretty much sit transfixed). Now he builds legos, bounces on his mini trampoline,<br/>
plays with his brother etc. Much of the time the tv is more background noise. I have<br/>
also noticed that they do use the tv to relax...after we have had a really exciting day<br/>
and also to transition to waking up in the morning (all 3 of us usually cuddle on the <br/>
couch and watch blue&#39;s clues). <br/>
<br/>
Things I have also noticed is that they don&#39;t fight when we have to go somewhere and<br/>
turn off the tv. When my ILs were visiting, they hardly turned it on at all (my ILs<br/>
love playing with the boys). It is pretty easy to get them involved in other things<br/>
(mainly with the tv on). The tv no longer goes on first thing when we get home and <br/>
Jason has started asking me to put on music. I have seen no loss in creativity...they<br/>
still like to do lots of stuff. It has cut back on arguments and I like that I no<br/>
longer make them feel bad for liking something &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The only downfall is that I have lost my &quot;never-fail&quot; option...before lifting restrictions<br/>
if I had to get something done (phone call etc) I could always let them watch tv...doesn&#39;t<br/>
hold the same attraction nowadays...<br/>

They both sometimes watch Jerry Springer.  It embarrasses me because I have <br/>
many poor southern relatives and I hate to think of the similarities.  But <br/>
that&#39;s my personal problem. &lt;g&gt;   They see it in several different ways, and <br/>
have <br/>
discussed why people would be the way they are.  They don&#39;t think those <br/>
people <br/>
are typical or sensible.  We&#39;ve talked about how lacking some people are in <br/>
the most basic of social skills and awarenesses, and what might help them be <br/>
better and that show is one of the most fascinating labs for what lack of <br/>
interpersonal intelligence can lead to.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t personally like courtroom shows, but years ago, when I was a kid, I <br/>
really did.<br/>
When the big &quot;scandal&quot; about a lot of Springer&#39;s shows being staged and <br/>
planned came out, I was not appalled. In fact, I found it reassuring.<br/>
<br/>
We watch Judge Judy pretty often. When my friend Melissa was preparing for <br/>
her Bar exam, we found we were able to answer most of the Civil questions <br/>
correctly, and knew WHY the decisions were the way they were. That was pretty cool.<br/>
