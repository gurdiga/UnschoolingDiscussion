<div id="ygrps-yiv-986187083">We too were almost ready to send our daughter to school. We just could not get her to &quot;do the work&quot;. She was miserable and told me she wanted to try school. We told her that if she really wanted to, next year we would enroll her in PS. Then we decided to just let her have the rest of this year &quot;off&quot;. I thought that I was no longer home schooling her. I did not know about unschooling as practiced by so many families until I got onto some unschooling lists. This is exactly what we are doing! It is working and she is so much happier. Last night we decided that she would not go to PS next year after all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-912147139">I was going to send my dd back to school this past Sept, but thank goodness I read a book that changed my life.  It was a fight just to get her to do 1/2 her math, read and answer a few questions in science or history.  Today we are still deschooling some, but our life is 100% better, I wouldn&#39;t change this for a milliion dollars.  For the first time my dd and I aren&#39;t fighting, we actually enjoy each others company.  Unschooling has permeated all areas of our life and peace abounds.<br/>
