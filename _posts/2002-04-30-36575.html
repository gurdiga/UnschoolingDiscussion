<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383132878">**When people loosen a longstanding TV limit, or video game limit, kids<br/>
binge<br/>
BIGTIME because (from accounts from the parents and kids, and from<br/>
general<br/>
knowledge of human behavior) they think it&#39;s a temporary lapse of the<br/>
rules.<br/>
It&#39;s a one-time special.  It&#39;s a festival.   They don&#39;t REALLY believe<br/>
their<br/>
parents are not going to stick the restrictions right back on.**<br/>
<br/>
Right.  They are feeding their previously repressed apetites, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
We had an interesting experience visiting teenage cousins for Easter.<br/>
Previous visits had involved lots of video game playing, but mixed with<br/>
rough-housing and chatting and outside play.  However, the 3 teenage<br/>
boys were just wrapping up their Spring break, after having had Nintendo<br/>
restrictions for several school weeks.  They knew they were going back<br/>
to restricted use, so they were pedal to the metal all day and evening<br/>
with the Nintendo.  In the future, I need to remember that this isn&#39;t<br/>
the most enjoyable day to visit them because they are SO preoccupied.<br/>
