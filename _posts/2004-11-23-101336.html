 </span></blockquote>Honestly I&#39;m not entirely sure...I know a friend of a friend who <br/>
currently works as a freelance editor although I&#39;m not entirely sure <br/>
how she got started (I&#39;ll try to remember to ask her when I see her). <br/>
However, one specific way I know of (and yes, it requires a bit of <br/>
school) is a certificate program at a university. The link below is <br/>
for the University of Washington program, but I&#39;m sure there are <br/>
others.<br/>
