<div id="ygrps-yiv-163080487">Hi ,<br/>
My name is Robin ,I am new to this list.I have 4 children and a wonderful husband.<br/>
We have been homeschooling for 4 years now,and have struggled every since we started.I have never been able to find the perfect curriculum,i just figure its not out there.<br/>
I have heard of Unschooling many times ,but have always thought how can you do that and call it school.I read unschooling .com and have talked to a women in my homeschooling group and I am excited to start this in our homeschooling.I have 1 teenager ,he is in 9th grade.My question is is how do I use unschooling with a highschooler?Also how do you do grades and transcripts?<br/>
I do have so many questions,if any one can help I would appreciate your advice.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings Robin<br/>

  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] CHARGE syndrome<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I can&#39;t help you, but now you&#39;ve got my curiosity going.  What&#39;s a <br/>
  &gt; CHARGE <br/>
  &gt; syndrome child?<br/>
  &gt; Tia<br/>
<br/>
  CHARGE is an acronym for a set of birth defects,  the letters coming from<br/>
  some of the most common features.<br/>
  C  is for coloboma ( cleft of the eyeball ), causing vision loss or<br/>
  blindness and cranial nerves a kind of facial palsy, swallowing problems,<br/>
  nerve damage, etc.<br/>
  H  heart defects<br/>
  A  artresia of the choanae, (nose and throat passage<br/>
  deformities)affecting breathing.<br/>
  R  retardation of growth development <br/>
  G genital and urinary abnormalities<br/>
  E  Ear  abnormalities and hearing loss.<br/>
<br/>
  There are usually other problems but these are the most common.  It is<br/>
  genetic.<br/>
  It occurs in about 1 in 12000 births, affecting all races, boys and girls<br/>
  equally.<br/>
<br/>
  A little boy with CHARGE syndrome may be coming to live with us.  I&#39;m<br/>
  taking a crash course.  He&#39;s seven and has no effective way to<br/>
  communicate that his care givers now can understand.  ( I don&#39;t know why<br/>
  he doesn&#39;t sign,  and since he&#39;s  deaf,  doctors may have incorrectly<br/>
  diagnosed mental retardation. )  He&#39;s been in the hospital most of his<br/>
  young life.  Unschooling will be the way to go as the ps  system has said<br/>
  they won&#39;t take him.  He was described to us as having severe behavioral<br/>
  problems.  We&#39;re scrambling to learn as much as we can.  I&#39;m finding a<br/>
  great deal of information actually, just wondered about personal stories.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
  Deb L<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297553171">Read The Teenage Liberation Handbook and Real Lives, both by Grace<br/>
Llewellyn. She also runs a Not Back to School Camp, a year-round program<br/>
(maybe ten weeks long?) and some sort of newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
Grades and transcripts depend on your local legal situation and what your<br/>
son thinks he might do in his adult life. These books describe a lot of<br/>
options. One of them is Clonlara School, which has an extremely flexible<br/>
program distance-learning program leading to a high school diploma (from a<br/>
private school, which may avoid the stigma sometimes carried by the GED).<br/>
Some kids go directly to college, sometimes first taking a course or two at<br/>
a local community college with an open admissions policy. Some go freestyle<br/>
into adult life Â– no diplomas at all. Read Dawn by Robin Graham, a teen who<br/>
sailed around the world alone. Keep your mind open to the endless<br/>
possibilities. Volunteer work is a big one.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re required to do grades and transcripts in order to <br/>
comply with your state&#39;s homeschool law. If you&#39;re not, then of <br/>
course the answer is that your high schooler doesn&#39;t need a grade!  <br/>
If you are required to give grades, then imo, if you think that he is <br/>
doing a good job of learning (and if he&#39;s unschooling he will be!), <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460756762">You don&#39;t have to do anything in California except send in the R4.  Although<br/>
they &quot;say&quot; you have to do this, that or the other thing, they do not check.<br/>
<br/>
As a &quot;just in case,&quot; over the years we have had a bank box for each year and<br/>
the kidlets throw in whatever they want to keep that might be considered<br/>
&quot;schooly.&quot;  They also like to keep a list of the books they have read (so<br/>
they don&#39;t rebuy the same books at the library sales and used book store)<br/>
and we throw a copy of that list in.  Also a copy of the stuff that they<br/>
buy, like youngest loves workbooks (not that she does them like workbooks<br/>
&lt;g&gt;), next to youngest is a science and space nut and if he buys anything<br/>
that I think some school type person might consider educational we through a<br/>
copy of that in too (like they just built a weather station and a rain<br/>
gauge).  And we take photos of stuff they want to remember.<br/>
<br/>
Besides which they like to go back and look through all the things they have<br/>
made over the years.<br/>

What does your dd want to do?  What are her goals?  Does she want to go to<br/>
school?  Does she want you to &quot;teach&quot; her?  Does she want to look for a<br/>
mentor in an area in which she is interested?  Does she want to volunteer?<br/>
Does she want a job?<br/>
<br/>
As long as you follow her lead, you will be doing the right thing.  She may<br/>
decide to skip college, or attend later.  She may be interested in traveling<br/>
or working first.  It is her life and as long as she is following her own<br/>
goals and dreams, she can&#39;t do it wrong.<br/>
