&quot;Well, if you are looking at primary sources of a historical event, <br/>
then you sort of have to sort through and figure out which version <br/>
(or middle version) makes sense.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-- then I will be putting my own biases into it.  What &quot;makes sense&quot; <br/>
to me is more likely to be the conservative version, whereas someone <br/>
else might think the liberal version &quot;makes sense&quot; more to them.  See <br/>
what I mean?  (or insert &quot;white person&quot; version VS. &quot;minority&quot; <br/>
version or &quot;woman&#39;s view&quot; VS. &quot;man&#39;s view&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;But in  most of these cases we are talking about the &quot;text book&quot; <br/>
version or the &quot;popular culture&quot; version.  In that case, go to the <br/>
primary sources.  Or even secondary sources.  Read a good book <br/>
written by someone who DID look at the primaries.  Or better yet, <br/>
read two or three books like that.  Compare what they chose to look <br/>
at when they have a discrepancy.  Or where they are coming from.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-- OK, so I&#39;m admitting I&#39;m coming from a place of ignorance.  &quot;Text <br/>
book version&quot; I get.  But &quot;pop culture&quot; version?  I wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
that if it hit me in the head.  *G*  {And me with a Bachelor&#39;s Degree <br/>
in English/ Secondary Teaching.  Just goes to show you how useful <br/>
book-lernin&#39; is!  *wg*}<br/>
Anyhoo  so WHERE do you get these primary sources?  Like Columbus&#39; <br/>
journal would be primary, right?  And a text about his journal <br/>
written by some historian who&#39;s read it would be secondary, yes?  Are <br/>
these laying around in the library?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only just in the past coupla years gotten really into the non-<br/>
fiction books in there.  Used to just go check out trashy novels <br/>
until I started researching education after quitting teaching for 4 <br/>
years.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
And you all do this with every issue that comes up with your kids?  <br/>
or only in the subjects (i know, schooly term) that you suspect might <br/>
be biased?  or you just point out to the kids that there may be more <br/>
than one story on that and let them decide how to research it?? <br/>
<br/>
The lazy side of me is thinking how COMPLICATED this could all get.  <br/>
You&#39;re right when you (the general &quot;You&quot;) say that just sticking the <br/>
kids in school is the easy way out.  Am I up for this??<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885428312">Tate dear  :::::breath:::::  It&#39;s going to be ok!  &lt;g&gt;  Your litle ones are <br/>
so little!  You have lots of time to deschool, deprogram, depanic!  I can&#39;t <br/>
help you with the cultural literacy thing.  It pretty well goes over my head <br/>
too.  Right, where DO you look for accurate information??<br/>
<br/>
As far as your little ones are concerned...you have enough time to relax and <br/>
watch them learn so unschooling will just be a natural extension of that <br/>
observation and exploration.  It really is that simple!<br/>
<br/>
What is your baby girl doing these days?  Learning how to stand, walk, talk? <br/>
  Are you teaching her how to do those things?  If you hear a yes in your <br/>
head or catch it bobbling to and fro, then I ask, are you using a book or <br/>
curriculum to do it?  I imagine you sit by nervously as she attempts her <br/>
first steps, allowing her to tumble and get back up on her feet again.  Then <br/>
the big moment comes and she ventures out on her own two wobbly feet.  <br/>
Sometimes, you hold her little cherubic hand and guide her along, praising <br/>
her and loving her and others, you stand a few feet away so she can come to <br/>
you on her own.  This is what unschooling feels like.  Offering them the <br/>
freedom to explore, experiment, observe and absorb whilst you sit on the <br/>
sidelines, sometimes cheering, sometimes calming your butterflies, other <br/>
times offering a supportive hand.  Understanding it all in the beginning can <br/>
be complicated.  Allowing it to happen and watching your children blossom <br/>
and grow isn&#39;t!  That&#39;s great news!<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, wishing I had found this path when my older kids were tiny little <br/>
learning beings. :(<br/>

I trust that just about every piece of information I expose my kids <br/>
to is not all it was or all it will be. I tell what I know and where <br/>
I learned it. When I learn something new, I tell them that too. It&#39;s <br/>
a continuing process, this unschooling thing. The questions are <br/>
important. The answers change a lot. That&#39;s life.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely.  That&#39;s the best we can do since we weren&#39;t there.  THe best<br/>
kind of historian is the one who understands this and tries to account for<br/>
it as she/he interprets the sources.<br/>
<br/>
-- But &quot;pop culture&quot; version?  I wouldn&#39;t know<br/>
that if it hit me in the head.<br/>
<br/>
The Columbus discovered the Americas, the Indians were thrilled to see him,<br/>
etc. is a &quot;pop culture&quot; version.  Think of it as being comprable to the<br/>
&quot;bible stories for children&quot; where all the context and sex are taken<br/>
ut.  -grin-<br/>
<br/>
--Anyhoo - so WHERE do you get these primary sources?  Like Columbus&#39;<br/>

<br/>
Well, getting your hands on the primary is sometimes tough, althought they<br/>
are sometimes reproduced and you can look at facsimilies.  And yes, many<br/>
many of both are &quot;laying about in the library.&quot;  I love libraries.<br/>
<br/>
---And you all do this with every issue that comes up with your kids?<br/>

<br/>
I do it in an age appropriate way, but yeah, I&#39;ll mention it.  And if they<br/>
ask a question I&#39;m careful about what sources I lead them to.  It&#39;s not the<br/>
at I won&#39;t let them see &quot;wrong&quot; ones, but I&#39;ll take the chance to show them<br/>
why it&#39;s wrong.  BUt then, I worked in a research library for over ten<br/>
years.  It&#39;s second nature to me to check sources, etc.<br/>

<br/>
It really does become second nature.  You do it naturally when you talk to<br/>
people, don&#39;t you?  There are just some folk you take with a grain of salt.<br/>
For most American history---take a salt lick when you look at what we got in<br/>
grade school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tate<br/>
<br/>
I have William Bradford&#39;s history of Plimoth Colony, written in 1647. <br/>
It&#39;s a reprint of a 1901 publication, and it is &quot;excerpts&quot; which <br/>
would evidence a bias, wouldn&#39;t it? What did the editors choose to <br/>
leave in, and what did they leave out? hmmmm. In fact, reading it <br/>
yesterday, to see what actually DID happen with the Pilgrims and the <br/>
First Thanksgiving...I did not see a mention in there about any such <br/>
feast, to my own surprise. I didn&#39;t read it super thoroughly though. <br/>
Just skimmed along looking for a mention of a feast and didn&#39;t see <br/>
anything. And the editors are conservative, so they&#39;d be likely to <br/>
leave in a feast.<br/>
<br/>
there was a bit in there about how things fell apart when they tried <br/>
a communal economy, with everyone pooling all their resources and <br/>
everyone sharing all the work evenly. Didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder where one would find primary documents in their entirety. <br/>
Maybe online! ;)<br/>

<br/>
Often they&#39;re online (at least excerpts).<br/>
<br/>
And there are several books like &quot;Eyewitness to History&quot; which are <br/>
collections of first-hand reports of historical incidents.  Those are good <br/>
for getting a snapshot moment without trying to read 400 pages of scholarly <br/>
documentation of anything.   <br/>
