Your suggestions are good.  A home equity loan will not work - neither one of us has the finances (I make $10.30 an hour for 3 people...) and neither one of us has credit for it anyways.  Also, since I am moving in January it wouldn&#39;t make sense to get a loan that I would be responsible for and unable to pay while paying rent, etc...  Additionally, I don&#39;t want any legal troubles with my father since the house is in his name and her name.  He is currently incarcerated and when he gets out my mom plans on divorcing him.  I don&#39;t want him suing me because I signed for a loan etc...  Lastly, I will be getting married in about a year and do not want to take anymore debt into my marriage than I already have.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair to do to my fiancee.<br/>
<br/>
My mother refuses to consider renting out... she&#39;s afraid of people ruining the house, smoking, etc.  ALSO it is in no condition to have anyone there.  We have paths through all her stuff (which I have tried to clean but she refuses because she claims SHE needs to go through it all).  Heck... you have to dump water in the toilet tank to flush it because it isn&#39;t hooked up to water lines, we only have 1 working phone jack, and the electrical is something to be desired between missing light fixtures and non-working outlets...  I try, but there&#39;s only so much I can do at a time.  I think it&#39;s all a mental thing for my mom, and there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.  It&#39;s getting worse, not better.  It has begun to negatively affect my daughter and I don&#39;t want that at all for her.  The whole thing is a mess.  <br/>
<br/>
Assisted living would be nice, but she&#39;d also do fine in a small apartment of her own where she didn&#39;t have to worry about anything.  It&#39;s just getting her to consider those options that seems impossible.  <br/>

It is obvious that your daughter *needs* more<br/>
attention from you.  What does she do/where is she<br/>
when you are working?  <br/>

My daughter is with my mom right now.  I don&#39;t know what I will do when I move.  I am not sure my mom is &quot;healthy&quot; for her to be with anymore, and I don&#39;t know if I can afford child care while I am working.  I am looking into potential assistance, but I may not qualify for much with my income.  I am trying to find something that I may be able to do from home as far as work goes.  I find it hard to focus on my daughter with the 101 things going on at home that need done and the constant voice of my mother in my head (or my ears...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mom has a hard time seeing me as an adult too, and I feel like a kid being ordered around by her all the time.  I have even begun to feel like I have no say in my daughter&#39;s life and care.  Nothing I ever do is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;good&quot;.  There is always something wrong ro missing that is all my responsibility according to mom (i.e. I feed Bekka too much corn and peas which makes her overweight - but never mind my mom feeds her bologna and hotdogs for lunch all the time...).  There are gigantic boundary issues, and it gets worse.  It&#39;s beyond frustrating.  We used to have a good relationship, but between all the stuff she&#39;s dealing with emotionally and us living on top of each other it has become impossible to maintain a well-defined relationship.  I have often thought that maybe things would be different if I had my own place.  Even if she eventually moved in, it would be &quot;MY&quot; place, and perhaps I would have more of a backbone when it comes to finances, house, child, etc...  <br/>

Well this is clearly a more complex situation than I understood when I made<br/>
the loan suggestion, and the taking in borders suggestion. To be honest I<br/>
think waiting to get your daughter out of a situation that is not only<br/>
undermining unschooling, but is probably having a deleterious effect on your<br/>
relationship with your daughter and her personal growth, is a shame.<br/>
Daughter&#39;s needs for freedom outweigh grandmother&#39;s needs to be in charge in<br/>
my philosophy. My fear is that your mother can&#39;t be trusted to not be<br/>
undermining you constantly with your daughter. It could be making her<br/>
stressed and conflicted.<br/>
<br/>
It may not be your house, but it is currently your home, and your income is<br/>
evidently making it possible for your mother to stay in her home. It may not<br/>
be your house, but your daughter is still legally and morally your<br/>
responsibility, not hers. If your mother can&#39;t treat you with respect as a<br/>
daughter, maybe she should treat you with respect as a guest. Or perhaps as<br/>
her employer - in a sense you are paying her to be a childcare provider.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kinda hesitant to say this but I will anyway ;) - I suppose there is a<br/>
genuine and top priority reason why you aren&#39;t marrying sooner, like at<br/>
once? What is magic about January to move, instead of, say, tomorrow. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We used to have a good relationship, but between all the stuff she&#39;s<br/>
dealing with emotionally and us living on top of each other it has become<br/>
impossible to maintain a well-defined relationship.  I have often thought<br/>
that maybe things would be different if I had my own place.  Even if she<br/>
eventually moved in, it would be &quot;MY&quot; place, and perhaps I would have more<br/>
of a backbone when it comes to finances, house, child, etc... &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a pessimist about people changing emotionally and spiritually when there<br/>
is no internal reason for doing so. I bet she would be exactly the same,<br/>
except that she might call her interference &quot;advice&quot;. Chances are you would<br/>
feel even more put upon because it is your house. But as I said, I&#39;m a<br/>
pessimist.<br/>
<br/>
Would your mother do any reading about respectful parenting or unschooling?<br/>
I have had some success with my mother sending her articles from the kind of<br/>
sources on the internet she respects about different issues. She may<br/>
continue to disagree, but at least she knows I am not just making this stuff<br/>
up out of the air.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With all that stuff, you could probably quit your job and spend time <br/>
selling it all on ebay and make some good money for quite a while. <br/>
Spend your afternoons holding up objects for your Mom to say &quot;sell&quot;, <br/>
&quot;give to so-and-so&quot;, etc.  Maybe a live auction if you don&#39;t want to <br/>
sort it  yourself?  If your Mom understands the financial situation <br/>
properly, she might be game for something like this (and she would feel <br/>
like she is contributing!).<br/>

There was a Dr. Phil episode aired this summer about a family dealing <br/>
with a grandma with a hording OCD behavior.  It looked unbearably hard <br/>
to deal with.  On the drphil.com website there might be resources and <br/>
discussion about this topic (linked to this episode). <br/>
<br/>
It seems that people who keep really broken down trash have something <br/>
going on in their brains that impairs their judgement.  Likely, it is <br/>
not possible to reason with them.  So, please don&#39;t blame yourself when <br/>
your mom won&#39;t let you help.<br/>
