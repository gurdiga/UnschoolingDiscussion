1. WHAT&#39;S NEW ON THE NEUROSCIENCE FOR KIDS PAGES<br/>
<br/>
IMPORTANT NOTICE:  As of July 1, 1999, the &quot;Neuroscience for Kids&quot; web<br/>
site has a new address:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html</a><br/>
<br/>
This new address will make the web site faster and more reliable...at<br/>
least that is what the University of Washington Computer Center told me.<br/>
If you try to access the Neuroscience for Kids pages with an old address,<br/>
you will be guided to a new address.  The web site will look the same, but<br/>
if you find something that doesn&#39;t work properly, I would appreciate it if<br/>
you would let me know.<br/>
<br/>

2. NEUROSCIENCE FOR KIDS &quot;PAGE OF THE MONTH&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Neuroscience for Kids &quot;Page of the Month&quot; for July is<br/>
&quot;SandlotScience.com&quot; at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandlotscience.com">http://www.sandlotscience.com</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;SandlotScience.com&quot; is filled with great visual illusions, many of which<br/>
are hands-on and interactive.  This site contains the best collection of<br/>
illusions that I have found on the Internet.  Choose from impossible<br/>
objects, ambiguous figures and after-effects to explore the world of<br/>
vision and the brain. There are also many games and puzzles to try.  Make<br/>
sure your browser is &quot;java-enabled&quot; for maximum enjoyment of the site.<br/>
Then dive right in and don&#39;t worry about getting your hands dirty in the<br/>
sandlot!<br/>

3. THE UPS AND DOWNS OF TRAMPOLINES<br/>
<br/>
In last month&#39;s Neuroscience for Kids newsletter you read about the<br/>
potential for head injury while playing golf and in a previous newsletter<br/>
you may remember an article on soccer-related head injuries.  Other sports<br/>
and sports equipment also pose risks to our heads and brains.  In fact,<br/>
trampoline jumping is one of these risky sports.  Now, I don&#39;t want to<br/>
sound like your mother or father (&quot;Put on your seatbelt!&quot;  &quot;Don&#39;t forget<br/>
your bike helmet!&quot;), but protecting your brain is important.  Brain damage<br/>
can have devastating consequences and recovery from such injuries can be<br/>
difficult.<br/>
<br/>
In a policy statement released in May 1999, the American Academy of<br/>
Pediatrics (AAP) estimated that in 1996 there were 83,400<br/>
trampoline-related injuries.  Of these injuries, two-thirds were to<br/>
children between the ages of 5 and 15 years old.  Although injuries to the<br/>
leg, foot, arm and hand were most common, 14% of the injuries were to the<br/>
head or face.  About 15% of all head injuries involved fractures,<br/>
concussions and internal head injuries.<br/>
<br/>
Fatal trampoline injuries are rare.  Nevertheless, six trampoline-related<br/>
deaths have been reported since 1990.  Most of these fatalities occurred<br/>
when people fell off of the trampoline and injured the upper part of their<br/>
spinal cords.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the high risk of injury associated with trampoline use, the AAP<br/>
has recommended:<br/>
<br/>
A.  &quot;The trampoline should not be used at home, inside or outside.&quot;<br/>
B.  &quot;The trampoline should not be part of routine physical education<br/>
classes in schools.&quot;<br/>
C.  &quot;The trampoline has no place in outdoor playgrounds and should never<br/>
be regarded as play equipment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

4.  EINSTEIN&#39;S BRAIN...BACK IN THE NEWS<br/>
<br/>
The incredible intelligence of physicist Albert Einstein continues to<br/>
capture the interest of the public and scientists alike.  On June 19,<br/>
1999, the British medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; (vol. 353, pages 2149-2153)<br/>
published the latest study concerning Einstein&#39;s brain and the possible<br/>
connection with his genius.<br/>
<br/>
The researchers found that compared to normal brains, the brain of<br/>
Einstein was wider and had a shorter groove on the parietal lobe of the<br/>
cerebral cortex.  This area of the cerebral cortex is thought to play a<br/>
role in mathematical abilities and spatial reasoning.  The researchers<br/>
think that the characteristics found on Einstein&#39;s brain permitted better<br/>
connections between neurons important for these functions.<br/>
<br/>
Although these results are interesting, it must be remembered that this<br/>
study had only ONE subject in the experimental group...Albert Einstein. It<br/>
remains to be seen if other mathematical geniuses also show these<br/>
distinguishing brain characteristics.  Moreover, the study did not<br/>
investigate the brain at a microscopic level.  In other words, they did<br/>
not look to see if there were differences in how neurons were connected<br/>
and of course, could not tell if there were differences in the way the<br/>
neurons functioned.  Further research using modern brain imaging<br/>
techniques (MRI/PET) that look at the anatomy and function of the brain in<br/>
living geniuses may help solve some of these questions.  For more on<br/>
Einstein&#39;s brain, see:<br/>

5.  BOOK REVIEW<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Phantoms in the Brain : Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind&quot; by V. S.<br/>
Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee, New York, William Morrow & Company,<br/>
1998, 320 pages.<br/>
<br/>
[This book review was written by Ira Surolia, second-year medical student,<br/>
B.R. Ambedkar Medical College, Bangalore, India]<br/>
<br/>
Ramachandran, a neurologist from the University of California, San Diego,<br/>
has written a highly readable book about the human brain.  In my opinion,<br/>
&quot;Phantoms in the Brain&quot; is most appropriate for high school students and<br/>
adults who are not experts in neurology.  The book, written in a clear,<br/>
story-like style, starts with an introduction to the brain and continues<br/>
with stories of people who have unusual neurological conditions. These<br/>
conditions include phantom limbs (people feel the presence of a body part<br/>
that has been amputated), false pregnancies (women feel sure they are<br/>
preganant when they are not), scotomas (people are blind only in parts of<br/>
their visual field), neglect (people ignore parts of their bodies), denial<br/>
(people refuse to believe something is wrong with them), and epilepsy<br/>
(people have seizures).<br/>
<br/>
Ramachandran starts each chapter with the description of a particular<br/>
problem, then follows with ideas about the underlying cause of the<br/>
disorder.  These theories are then supported or thrown out, depending on<br/>
the evidence that doctors find when examining the patients or by doing<br/>
experiments.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the book, readers are treated to Ramachandran&#39;s clever ways of<br/>
thinking about neurology, including:<br/>
<br/>
A. You don&#39;t always need expensive or state-of-the-art equipment to make<br/>
important discoveries.  Rather, keen observation and questioning of<br/>
patients often help to solve some neurological puzzles.<br/>
<br/>
B. If you study the normal functioning of the brain and then figure out<br/>
what can happen if this is interrupted, you will see how neurological<br/>
disorders come about.  For example, in a chapter called &quot;Knowing Where To<br/>
Scratch,&quot; Ramachandran suggests an explanation for pain or sensation in<br/>
arms and legs that have been amputated (&quot;phantom limbs&quot;).  He describes<br/>
how changes in the normal structure and nerve connections in the cerebral<br/>
cortex could cause such sensations.  In a chapter called &quot;God and The<br/>
Limbic System,&quot; he discusses how some people with epilepsy become overly<br/>
involved in religion. This may be explained by neurological problems in<br/>
the temporal lobe, which is involved in emotions and is often damaged or<br/>
abnormal in people with epilepsy.<br/>
