As to difficulties with differences in parenting between father and mother, that is a marital issue that you will have to work out together through compromise.  Also not related to Unschooling.  But I do wish you the best of luck, as it can be a very sticky issue to resolve.  <br/>

My suggestion would be anger management counseling for you husband and perhaps a class on creative parenting that the two of you could take together, to help give you ideas and help you reach a resolution.  Two individuals with very different backgrounds and histories trying to mesh that into a single child rearing philosophy can be very difficult.

We have very compatible philosophies and are always ready to learn from one another, and from our kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019859773">I&#39;m not meaning to continue a battle of wits here, but I will state that<br/>
I think any and all parenting issues absolutely ARE related to<br/>
unschooling.  Isn&#39;t that the whole point of home/unschooling?  Being<br/>
good, INVOLVED, emotionally available parents to our children, providing<br/>
a solid vessel for learning?  Not limiting ourselves or closing doors on<br/>
opportunities to learn?  Aren&#39;t we supposedly broadening our learning<br/>
base?  If this list is so structured about &quot;kosher&quot; topics open for<br/>
discussion, how are we any different from the restrictions of a typical<br/>
public school classroom?<br/>
<br/>
And besides, parenting issues affect our success and how we unschool. <br/>
How is &quot;dealing with discipline&quot; any less legitimate a topic for<br/>
discussion than &quot;how do I keep Johnny interested in books?&quot;...aren&#39;t<br/>
these topics related?  However squeemish we may feel we have to keep<br/>
these lines of communication open.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, like a few others, I don&#39;t think that corporal punishment is an<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling issue, it is a parenting issue and a very volitile one!  <br/>
&gt;Also,<br/>
&gt; &gt; each and ever discussion of corporal punishment on all but one<br/>
&gt; &gt; home/unschooling list I belong to has gone down hill into at the least,<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; next thing to a flame war.  AND, that includes this list!  So, as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; courtesy to all of us who are, quite frankly, tired of the topic raising<br/>
&gt; &gt; its head every 6 months or so, please keep the same subject line so we <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt; &gt; delete and get on with the business of unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

Shirley says:<br/>
<br/>
One of the interesting parts of homeschooling/unschooling is that everything<br/>
becomes a part of it, in that lots of things affect it. Wasn&#39;t that the<br/>
point--to take learning out of the box and make it part of the real world??<br/>
In the real world, when you have discipline issues in your home, it DOES<br/>
affect your homeschooling. I don&#39;t have any real personal interest in<br/>
discussing discipline at this time, but someone who is trying to homeschool<br/>
is finding her efforts affected by this issue. Couldn&#39;t we just settle for<br/>
allowing those who want to discuss it to do so and the rest of us just to<br/>
delete it?? I was deleting hot and heavy a few days ago when birthday<br/>
presents were the topic and  I wasn&#39;t interested. But I didn&#39;t feel that<br/>
whoever was looking for suggestions was out of line to seek them from people<br/>
she trusted.<br/>
<br/>
I still say that liberal use of the delete key is the appropriate response.<br/>
Multiple threads can and will exist. That&#39;s what makes the list so valuable<br/>
to us newbies. Please don&#39;t cut us off at the knees &#39;cause you&#39;ve already<br/>
been where we&#39;re going. We need your patience, your help, and your<br/>
experience as we try to negotiate this land that has no map, with countries<br/>
that have no boundaries.</div>

It might be helpful if everyone who hasn&#39;t been through it once knows that a <br/>
list discussion on spanking usually becomes very controversial and outraged.  <br/>
Such a discussion is likely to TRIPLE the volume of posts on the list for a <br/>
couple of weeks and include some rather startling ranting and raving.<br/>
<br/>
But people who like to kick rotten logs, turn rocks over, and poke <br/>
rattlesnakes with sticks may enjoy some of those aspects. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents,<br/>
