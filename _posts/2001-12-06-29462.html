You are so creative!  This offers a great way t o get perspective on this<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
Susan,  who will have to wait &#39;til kidlets bedtime to get my thoughts out on<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, I think as list owner, you have every right to ban individuals from<br/>
the list. I know you don&#39;t want to be police chief and I understand that&#39;s<br/>
the whole gist of this list... no monitoring.<br/>
Let&#39;s say you own a bookstore and you sell all kinds of books (not that you<br/>
*like* all these kinds of books.. just that they are available to everybody<br/>
interested). You have tons of repeat customers... for years. You job is to<br/>
stock the store, etc. but you don&#39;t have to police the patrons... they&#39;re<br/>
folks who have come to your store with a purpose...to get information or<br/>
(buy books). All of a sudden, a new person enters the store and starts going<br/>
up to each patron and criticizing what they&#39;re reading. Some of them ignore<br/>
this person. Others walk away in a huff. One of them goes next door and<br/>
starts her *own* book store and takes some of the original patrons with her.<br/>
But there you are, still owner of the bookstore and watching it go down in a<br/>
pile of dust.. fast. This store has meant a lot to you in the past and you<br/>
recoginize it&#39;s also meant a lot to other people in town.  Do you just sit<br/>
back behind the register and let this go on or do you ask the person(s)<br/>
causing the rukus to leave? IMHO, you have a job to do *if* you still care<br/>
about your &#39;store&#39;.....<br/>
<br/>
or are you looking for a reason to shut it down? (I&#39;m hoping not!)<br/>
