<div id="ygrps-yiv-540263426">The thread about eating and monitoring behavior based on a mother&#39;s beliefs hits home <br/>
here. One of the dangers with &quot;imposing&quot; a viewpoint on children is that you leave yourself <br/>
little room to evolve or grow. Kids take what their parents say and do as true - right, <br/>
correct, logical. Ask any child who to vote for in the next election and the name of the <br/>
parents&#39; choice will pop out.<br/>
<br/>
Adults spend time choosing their beliefs. They make decisions about health, politics, the <br/>
environment, education and religion based on reading, life experience, dialog, facts and, <br/>
let&#39;s face it, their personal neuroses! &lt;g&gt; So often we think that once we have come to our <br/>
personal belief conclusions, that we&#39;ve &quot;arrived&quot; at some point of clarity or insight that is <br/>
immovable or will remain correct for... ever.<br/>
<br/>
So we short circuit the process of investigation or exploration for our kids, telling them <br/>
what took us years to &quot;conclude,&quot; and we get a little testy or anxious when our kids don&#39;t <br/>
automatically understand things the way we do (or we take undeserved pride in a child <br/>
who &quot;turns down sugar&quot; as though he did that for the same set of reasons we don&#39;t eat <br/>
sugar).<br/>
<br/>
But what happens when one day we realize: &quot;Hey, I no longer believe that&quot;? What if <br/>
someone changes faiths, stops believing that the rain forests are being depleted by my <br/>
fast food habit, decides not to be vegetarian any more, changes from traditional schooling <br/>
to unschooling, goes back to work after staying home, uses a bottle in addition to breast <br/>
feeding?<br/>
<br/>
What happens to kids who have been told repeatedly what is right and what is wrong, only <br/>
to have a parent change her mind?<br/>
<br/>
They become disoriented because they haven&#39;t developed a philosophy that says they <br/>
must grow, change and decide for themselves, too. They were used to taking a parent&#39;s <br/>
conclusion as the euqivalent of truth.<br/>
<br/>
My objective with my kids now is to live my life, my values, in front of them; to share what <br/>
my process is, but to also remind them that they are free to make their own choices. They <br/>
will have my love - gay or straight, Christian or non, unschooled or public schooled, breast <br/>
feeding mother or bottle feeding, vegetarian or carnivore...<br/>
<br/>
When I found my faith in a tailspin, I learned with firsthand experience how important it is <br/>
to be loved while growing, changing and learning - what it means to have my process <br/>
honored, even if it causes discomfort and upheaval. And my kids saw firsthand that I don&#39;t <br/>
have all the answers for everyone, for them, not even for myself.<br/>

<br/>
As each of my kids separately, in his or her own time, asked who the first <br/>
person on the planet was, or where people first came from, I told each kid-level <br/>
versions of two stories:  Adam and Eve, and evolution.  I told them &quot;A lot of <br/>
people think X because [it&#39;s in the Bible/researchers have found...].   Each <br/>
kid asked me which one I believed.  I said nobody knows for sure what happened <br/>
and they should figure out what THEY believe, as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
They all objected to my answer. &lt;G&gt;   That&#39;s okay.  That&#39;s an easy one not to <br/>
get attached to, because I don&#39;t think it matters.  (I did tell them that, <br/>
that I don&#39;t think it matters, which would have been an answer if they knew more <br/>
theology.)<br/>
<br/>
Some parents are eager to tell their children exactly what happened.  Too <br/>
many of them don&#39;t qualify the statement with WHY they think that&#39;s what <br/>
happened.  It becomes part of teaching kids not to think.  Schools do that too often.  <br/>
People shouldn&#39;t do it at home.<br/>

That&#39;s really sweet.<br/>
I&#39;ll have trouble with a bottle-feeding thing if it comes along, but the rest <br/>
are fine with me.<br/>

Happened here. VERY hard to readjust.<br/>
 <br/>
Homeroommom, parents&#39; board, graduate----all adds up to &quot;how could my mom  <br/>
change her beliefs that much?&quot;----a complete turn-around. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure Cameron was quite befuddled. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t find out  sooner.<br/>

ever, really. Just gave in, more or less. But, he used to complain all <br/>
the time, too, about the work I did as PTA treasurer and school site <br/>
council member, etc.<br/>

Yeah, except you&#39;ll likely have daughters-in-law whom you have no control  <br/>
over, and your ability to influence will have to be earned.  There&#39;s too  much <br/>
good to come out of fostering a good in-law relationship with my son&#39;s  wives <br/>
