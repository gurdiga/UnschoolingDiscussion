<div id="ygrps-yiv-232533191">Ah, my most favorite thing. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OK, let me try again.  Does unschooling teach a child to recognize the<br/>
&gt; mathematic symbols used in textbooks?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; a child anything.  They learn, which is different.<br/>
<br/>
But do unschoolers learn the mathematic symbols used in textbooks?  Sure,<br/>
if they have a reason to do so.  If they want to be able to communicate<br/>
math concepts, then yes, they&#39;ll need to learn standard notation, just like<br/>
if they want to write to someone and have it understandable, they need to<br/>
learn how to write in the language they speak.  Same thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From the unschoolers I&#39;ve known math<br/>
&gt; is mostly mental math - which is great - yet I don&#39;t see where they<br/>
&gt; experience the math sentence and different layouts of mathematic problems<br/>
&gt; on paper.  I would think this could potentially cause a problem at some<br/>
&gt; point would it not?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is an interesting thing to think about.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, you may be right.  I think unschoolers do a lot more mental<br/>
math than school kids do.  They *start* with mental math, and may or may<br/>
not do it on paper until much later, instead of starting with written math,<br/>
and *not understanding it* until later.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But again, I think it&#39;s like learning any language-  it is more natural to<br/>
learn to speak before learning to write.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem.  They learn to write it down when they need<br/>
it that way.  They also see written math quite a lot, at least my kids do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OK so what is Real Math?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Math is a language.  It is what we use to describe things and their<br/>
relationships to each other very precisely.<br/>
<br/>
Math is far more than numbers.  It is shapes, patterns, connections,<br/>
changes, movement, color, music, art, logic...<br/>
<br/>
Everything can be translated into or expressed in mathematical concepts-<br/>
look at artificial intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Arithmetic is the manipulation of numbers.  It&#39;s a basic part of much math,<br/>
but nowhere near the entire thing.  It&#39;s just the part that schools seem to<br/>
focus on, at least until you get to graduate level.<br/>
<br/>
Algebra is the art of taking the information you know, and using it to<br/>
figure out the information you don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Geometry is boring... no, wait. &lt;g&gt;  Geometry has to do with shapes and<br/>
sizes, angles and connections.  Things.  Objects.<br/>
<br/>
Trigonometry is very cool, once you figure out what it really is used for.<br/>
Waves.  Frequencies.  Vectors.  Very compact ways of expressing things that<br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
And calculus, that beautiful thing... how incredibly cool that you can<br/>
figure out so much about things that are only dreamt of, by understanding<br/>
the theories of how they must be.<br/>
<br/>
fractals... infinite series... infinity itself, what a concept<br/>
<br/>
and on and on.  All things of fascination, of beauty.  Of TRUTH, in its raw<br/>
form.  Where else but in math are things proven facts, irrefutable, perfect<br/>
forever?<br/>
<br/>
:::sigh:::<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling, getting emotional.  I have friends who laugh at me because I<br/>
have to put math books down after a while, I get too excited to keep<br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So you are saying that ages 13-14 is where math should begin?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Math begins before you are born.  Is, was, and always will be. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Understanding math begins at birth.<br/>
<br/>
A babies first mathematic concept:  am I, or am I not, the same being as my<br/>
mother?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thus  entering into the algebras, trigs, geometry, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These also begin very young, they are concepts, much to think about and<br/>
explore with long before any sort of &quot;formal&quot; education begins.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Then where is the<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s base?  Math like any other subject must have a foundation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And it does.  Life.  Life itself is the base of math, or is it the other<br/>
way around?<br/>
<br/>
Where is a child&#39;s foundation in language?<br/>
<br/>
Human brains are designed to use and understand math and language.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  When  did they learn multiplication (note I didn&#39;t say memorize the entire<br/>
&gt; multiplication table) and division, fractions, decimals, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All along.  Time is a big math concept motivator, as is money.  Body parts-<br/>
two of some ten of some, why?  Why are bodies mostly (but not totally)<br/>
symmetrical?  Why do some things fit together, others don&#39;t?  Why do some<br/>
stacks of things balance, others don&#39;t?  Why is it that if you want to<br/>
build a lego thing that is twice as tall and twice as wide and twice as<br/>
long as the one you have, it takes 8 times as many blocks?  Why is it that<br/>
two glasses can be different heights, but hold the same amount?  Why isn&#39;t<br/>
a taller one always &quot;bigger&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Notation starts when they realize that making a dot for each thing, or<br/>
using an object to represent a thing, gets a bit tedious after a while,<br/>
surely there must be an easier way?<br/>
<br/>
Concepts are learned as we need them, as we wonder about them, as we come<br/>
across them.<br/>
<br/>
What amazes me is the number of people who think there is no math in their<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
As far as more advanced written math- they&#39;ll either need to learn it, and<br/>
embrace it, or they won&#39;t need to learn it. If they don&#39;t need it, they<br/>
don&#39;t need it.<br/>
<br/>
How much of the school math that you &quot;learned&quot; do you still use, really?<br/>
Only those who have a need or an interest retain it.  Most people will not<br/>
need anything beyond basic algebra, some don&#39;t need even that.<br/>
