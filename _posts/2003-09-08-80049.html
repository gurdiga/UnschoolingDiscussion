<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295230545">I&#39;ve been receiving a bunch of phone calls lately from folks who have <br/>
received letters announcing that their homeschooled child has been <br/>
selected to be a Student Ambassador to such-and-such a place (all <br/>
different places in different letters).  The letter states that a <br/>
teacher usually recommends these students for this &quot;honor.&quot;  Folks <br/>
called me because I maintain my state teaching certification just so <br/>
I can do home ed portfolio assessments for those who choose that as <br/>
their annual assessment method.  They wondered if I had sent in their <br/>
child&#39;s name.  <br/>
<br/>
I had never heard of this program.  I looked them up online and found <br/>
this URL for the main web site:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.studentambassadors.org/">http://www.studentambassadors.org/</a><br/>
And I found a whole bunch of side sites for Art Ambassadors, Sports <br/>
Ambassadors, all kinds of ambassadors.  This seems to be a real wide <br/>
attack advertising blitz program.  I also found something about loans <br/>
for Student Ambassadors, but only found one site that talked about <br/>
four $500 scholarships available each year.  <br/>
<br/>
This has me very curious.  Does anyone know anything about this <br/>
program?  Has anyone else received these kinds of letters promoting <br/>
these programs?  Or indicating that their child has been chosen?  Has <br/>
anyone ever gone on one of these trips?  Or known someone who has?  I <br/>
would like to find some real information about this to put out to <br/>
folks in our home ed community before they spend thousands of dollars <br/>
to send their kids off to another country on one of these programs.  <br/>
Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks.<br/>

We know some people who o have gone on these trips.  They seem to be good but <br/>
expensive.  They are fairly well structured and supervised.  At least I have <br/>
heard good reports from the two families that I used to know who sent their <br/>
kids (this was a while back when my older son was in PS)  We have never been <br/>
able to afford this kind of experience.<br/>

It did look very expensive to me, too.  But if folks have the money <br/>
to spend and most folks have good reports on their child&#39;s experience <br/>
then it is up to them how they spend their money.  I know that when <br/>
we took a family trip to Europe when my daughter was younger it only <br/>
cost us about $4,000 for all three of us to go, to stay with hosts in <br/>
Servas host homes (a world peace traveler and host program).  And <br/>
that included airfare, Eurailpass, other train and bus travel in <br/>
Switzerland and France, Museum Pass in Paris, Metro passes in Paris, <br/>
and food.  But if cost is not a problem then this looks like a good <br/>
program.  Anyone else have any experience with this?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100658604">Yes, Norma!  I received one of these for my daughter.  Trip to Australia.  I<br/>
looked up the website but as I&#39;m always leery of these types of things, I<br/>
didn&#39;t put too much thought into it.  I told my dh that my dd wasn&#39;t going<br/>
to get to go to Australia without us anyway!!<br/>
I&#39;ll be curious to hear what this is all about...<br/>

<br/>
The programs can help the families with information on soliciting <br/>
sponsorships and fund raising to help pay the costs. If a lot of kids in one area are <br/>
trying to go it can make it hard to get sponsors but easier to do things like <br/>
spaghetti dinners and such.<br/>
<br/>
A schooled youngster from my working class town just came back from Australia <br/>
on the People to People program. He was able to raise enough money from <br/>
fundraisers and sponsors that his family could afford to send him. <br/>

My now 15 year old son, Cameron, went to Australia three years ago with <br/>
People to People as a Student Ambassador. It was a GREAT experience!<br/>
<br/>
I think that it was a bit &quot;exclusive&quot; for many years, but since the terrorist <br/>
attacks, I&#39;m guessing that interest is down. They are probably looking for <br/>
other outlets---thus, homeschooling. We were VERY vocal (surprise, surprise! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;) about Cameron&#39;s homeschool status, so maybe they are specifically targetting <br/>
homeschoolers.  ???<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be more than happy to discuss our experience with P2P with you. I can&#39;t <br/>
say enough about it!<br/>

I never saw my response to this---but yahoo seems bound and determined to be <br/>
messing with me lately. I&#39;ll post it again, just in case.<br/>
<br/>
My now 15 year old son, Cameron, went to Australia with People to People as a <br/>
Student Ambassador three years ago. It was an incredible experience, and he <br/>
says the highlight of his life so far. They were treated royally and got to see <br/>
the whole east coast of Australia with snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef, <br/>
an opera in the Opera House, a farm-stay and a home-stay among MANY other <br/>
experiences. He made life-long friendships and is truly happy for the opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that, due to the terrorists attacks, the program may be <br/>
suffering a bit. Folks aren&#39;t keen on sending their children overseas right now. That <br/>
may be why they&#39;re specifically targetting homeschoolers. Also, I was VERY <br/>
outspoken  (odd---me, outspoken! &lt;G&gt;) about homeschooling when Cameron was <br/>
interviewing and applying. They also got another dose of me later the next year. I <br/>
guess Cameron and the other homeschoolers they had that year were &quot;acceptable&quot; <br/>
enough to start considering! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As parents, we can&#39;t say enough about the program---it&#39;s outstanding. <br/>
Expensive, but out-standing! &lt;G&gt; And worth every penny! I&#39;d be happy to talk to you <br/>
more at length if you have specific questions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640044114">On a whim I just looked up the IFYE Program for travel to Japan that <br/>
is sponsored by Ohio State&#39;s 4-H International Opportunities <br/>
program.  They not only have a wide variety of programs available for <br/>
travel to Japan, but at about half the cost of the Student Ambassador <br/>
Program.  And in Ohio you do not have to be a 4-H club member to take <br/>
part in these programs.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the web site for the Ohio program:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ohioline.osu.edu/4-H/fguide00/4h_29.html">http://ohioline.osu.edu/4-H/fguide00/4h_29.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And here is the link for the larger organization, IFYE and all its <br/>
different programs:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ifyeusa.org/home.html">http://www.ifyeusa.org/home.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And then there are the YFU (Youth For Understanding) exchange <br/>
programs:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yfu-usa.org/">http://www.yfu-usa.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
Their prices are high too, I think, but they are for a summer, or a <br/>
semester, or an academic year, or a full year, not just three weeks.  <br/>
And they have been around a long time, too.  Their exchange programs <br/>
are with many different nations, not just English speaking ones for a <br/>
real opportunity to experience a different culture. <br/>
<br/>
The AFS is another program that has been around forever and that has <br/>
many different programs in dozens of different countries.  Prices are <br/>
steep, but comparable to YFU&#39;s prices, and for longer time periods <br/>
than the Student Ambassador Programs.  <br/>
<br/>
And last, but not least, many churches, religious organizations, and <br/>
other youth groups sponsor foreign travel opportunities for youth.  <br/>
These can be for various purposes.  Some are religious and some are <br/>
community service type trips, and some are strictly educational.  But <br/>
any of these would be worth investigating.  Local universities often <br/>
have well-organized trips, too, with college credit.  I mean, if <br/>
you&#39;re going to spend the big bucks up front you might as well go for <br/>
the college credit, too.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some other groups to check out:  American Youth Hostels, The <br/>
Friendship Force, Amnesty International, the Sierra Club, American <br/>
Friends Service Committee, Planned Parenthood.<br/>
<br/>
But the die-hard unschooler, like my daughter, will probably prefer <br/>
to do-it-herself, planning her own trip and staying where she wants <br/>
to stay.  She will use Servas, hostels and a couple other travel <br/>
networks we belong to through organizations to link up with hosts in <br/>
different countries.   These kinds of groups cut the costs down to <br/>
half or less what the more organized programs cost, allow for much <br/>
more freedom to decide where you want to go, what you want to see, <br/>
and when, and the flexibility to change things if the weather or <br/>
political circumstances change suddenly. <br/>
