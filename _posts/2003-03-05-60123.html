<div id="ygrps-yiv-811571612">Hi,<br/>
I understand that FlyLady is not for everyone, but she does have some <br/>
principals that work. The thing I like about it is that you are never <br/>
behind, you just start where you are. I have three kids that don&#39;t really <br/>
&quot;clean&quot; yet. If they do try to clean their rooms it is never how *I* would <br/>
do it and I have found that *that* is OK. I do not obsess over their rooms <br/>
or over my house. I do my *zones* so that it never gets totally out of <br/>
control (like not being able to see yourself though the toothpaste splatters <br/>
on your bathroom mirror). The 27 fling bogie worked for me for a few months <br/>
(I had a lot of junk I did not really like)and after that I just quit doing <br/>
that part. Like FlyLady says you can delete the e-mails at will. You don&#39;t <br/>
have to do them if they do not fit into your lifestyle. There is no whining <br/>
about that, just delete and do what is right for you. It is working for me <br/>
because I really needed routines, and needed to know when it was time to <br/>
wash my dishes because for some reason I was not built with that internal <br/>
clock that let me know until it was to late...lol (until I had no clean <br/>
dishes and no place to stack anymore if I did have them)! Anyway, FlyLady <br/>
has worked for me and my family only because I have adapted her ideas into <br/>
*our* lives. I do not live to do housework, but my house (now) is <br/>
presentable if someone just happens to knock on the door, and I like that <br/>
feeling!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also hated fly-lady.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First her stance, no bitching. Well, if you couldn&#39;t bitch about problems <br/>
&gt;with her system that meant her system went unchallenged. Either it works or <br/>
&gt;you didn&#39;t work, one or the other. Second, it was all up to whoever was <br/>
&gt;reading the emails; mostly women. The system was suppose to make the family <br/>
&gt;members help. HA! I went on this kick for awhile, cleaning so that when I <br/>
&gt;did the living room I was washing the floors with wood soap (Wood floors) <br/>
&gt;each week....by hand, it was so clean, and no one really helped all that <br/>
&gt;often.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Half my problem is not my stuff but others. She leaves you two choices; <br/>
&gt;leave it or toss it, if it is the kids. Well, I&#39;m not tossing the <br/>
&gt;children&#39;s stuff, or dh&#39;s and my own stuff, basically if I keep it I want <br/>
&gt;it. The boogies (27 boogie) meant I was either tossing things I may have <br/>
&gt;wanted or I was tossing bit of paper etc. But the house is not going to <br/>
&gt;look clean if my dh doesn&#39;t do the recycle, doesn&#39;t want me to do it (he <br/>
&gt;has a particular way) and the recycle keeps flowing out of it&#39;s area and <br/>
&gt;into the rest of the house. The house isn&#39;t going to stay clean if five <br/>
&gt;minutes after I&#39;ve put everything away, the kids take out their toys and <br/>
&gt;spread them on the ground.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After awhile all my attention was focused on trying to keep the house clean <br/>
&gt;and i was becoming bitter and angry. I ended up working all the time to <br/>
&gt;keep it clean, feeling like a dishrag, and hating the house, the family <br/>
&gt;etc. etc. And then I would get sick, or have some other obligation that <br/>
&gt;kept me from doing my routines; the house would just collapse and become a <br/>
&gt;mess, and no one was pitching in. It just didn&#39;t work for us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe we have too many people with too much stuff for the size of the <br/>
&gt;house, but FlyLady just left me angry, not happy, and made me feel like a <br/>
&gt;person who is always on a diet, where they can think of nothing but food.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;be well, Rachel Ann<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;[Unschooling-dotcom] Intro<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My flylady rant: I was subscribed to flylady from last May until just after <br/>
&gt;Christmas. The house was much cleaner but I was also *so* much more <br/>
&gt;conscious of it. I mean, all day long, reading message after message about <br/>
&gt;clutter and how bad it is. It made me feel like all of our stuff was <br/>
&gt;clutter. I was busy &quot;fling boogie&quot;ing things left and right because, you <br/>
&gt;know, &quot;you can&#39;t organize clutter&quot;. Rather than make me more relaxed, it <br/>
&gt;made me more anxious. After all, if 150,000 other women now have spotless <br/>
&gt;homes thanks to the system, why is mine uncontrollable? It made me think of <br/>
&gt;my children&#39;s belongings as clutter. After a series of flylady messages <br/>
&gt;about throwing away kid&#39;s stuff because they don&#39;t need that much anyway <br/>
&gt;and etc, I pulled out a trash bag and decided to get rid of some stuff. My <br/>
&gt;son was absolutely horrified, and I came to my senses and realized it&#39;s not <br/>
&gt;my decision to make. And it&#39;s not helpful to constantly get emails telling <br/>
&gt;me that the kids&#39; stuff all over the place is a bad thing. Also, I was in a <br/>
&gt;lot more pain when I was doing flylady. I injured my back three years ago <br/>
&gt;and it usually doesn&#39;t hurt. But setting a timer and cleaning everything I <br/>
&gt;can for 15 minutes straight made me want to cry. She says &quot;you can do <br/>
&gt;anything for 15 minutes&quot; but honestly it was causing a lot of back pain to <br/>
&gt;clean for 15 straight minutes. Maybe I sound lazy, admitting I can&#39;t clean <br/>
&gt;house for 15 minutes at a time. But it&#39;s true and I&#39;d always be lying on <br/>
&gt;ice afterwards, or I&#39;d get the living room picked up and then my husband <br/>
&gt;would vacuum for me while I sat down and took aspirin. So yes, my home is <br/>
&gt;much messier since I unsubscribed, but I&#39;m much more at peace about it <br/>
&gt;without her nagging me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341356032">Have you ever had a look at it?<br/>
<br/>
There is something about reading all those emails that gets you worked <br/>
up (or at least some of us). I thought it was GREAT at first- I made <br/>
BIG huge progress - got areas all cleaned out and kept some parts of <br/>
the house clean for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
But - there was also that other effect that people have mentioned. It <br/>
was exactly like being on a diet and, thus, having food on your mind <br/>
all the time. And I did start seeing everybody&#39;s stuff as &quot;junk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know there is an in-between.<br/>
<br/>
I know how to do housework and how to organize - I don&#39;t see it as a <br/>
matter of not knowing how to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do it naturally AT ALL!!!! The dirty dishes don&#39;t call my name, <br/>
but my computer does - so does a good book or a good tv show or a <br/>
friend on the phone or the kids wanting to play a game or go somewhere <br/>
or talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m distractable and very very very easily sidetracked. Then I regret <br/>
it later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193818355">I agree, some people don&#39;t know how to look past what they know will not <br/>
work and just take the good and leave the rest. That goes for all <br/>
professionals out there who &quot;tell&quot; us what is best for us. One, we don&#39;t <br/>
know unless we try (not saying you should try everything, somethings are <br/>
just stupid to try), but if we try and it didn&#39;t work why go back and do it <br/>
again or feel like you have to? It is up to you it is your life and in this <br/>
case your e-mail and your home. It&#39;s not like FlyLady lives with you! She <br/>
can sometimes just be the gental reminder that I *might* need to do <br/>
something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871226891">**I don&#39;t do it naturally AT ALL!!!! The dirty dishes don&#39;t call my<br/>
name, <br/>
but my computer does **<br/>
<br/>
I can see the new kitchen from my computer, which *may* help me improve<br/>
my habits.  I suppose if I can smell the kitchen from my computer that&#39;s<br/>
a powerful motivator.  ::: makes a face :::<br/>
<br/>
I have half of the cleanliness thing going for me.  (Obviously, not the<br/>
wash-the-dishes half!)  I kind of like to &quot;tidy&quot;, but I never like to &quot;scrub&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When I see items on the floor or misplaced objects I actually *have the<br/>
desire to put them away*.  I feel like the left shoe WANTS to be with<br/>
the right shoe and the books tossed next to the couch WANT to be on the<br/>
shelf.  Putting them in the right place is satisfying for me.  (It may<br/>
be a neurological thing and not something one can fake.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying, now, to convince myself that the dishes WANT to be clean. <br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that dirty dishes can&#39;t call to one in a persuasive way,<br/>
but I&#39;m trying to listen for the siren call of *clean* dishes.<br/>
<br/>
So far, it isn&#39;t happening, but that&#39;s my strategy.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a bias in favor of adopting messy people as my friends.  There<br/>
may be super-clean people who are relaxed, but it seems like a fairly<br/>
large percentage of them are too tense to be much fun.<br/>
