<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077842849">Hope it&#39;s OK to post, I just rejoined the list, but was on it for a couple  <br/>
of years and took a break for a few months.  I didn&#39;t want this post  to slip <br/>
by as it&#39;s so specific and pertains so much to us.  <br/>
 <br/>
We have adopted 3 boys, now ages 12, 13, and 15 (first got them in foster  <br/>
care when they were 7 1/2, 8 1/2, and 10), and have 2 foster kids (g-10,  b-17). <br/>
 We still have 2 bio kids at home too (b-17 and g-15).  <br/>
 <br/>
I too, would like to talk with others who have adopted and unschool their  <br/>
kids.  It is a whole different ball game with a child who has not been  raised <br/>
in an unschool/homeschool, or even just a nurturing environment.  A  kid who <br/>
has not been raised being read to, pretend playing, or even just  provided with <br/>
their basic needs has a whole bunch of other issues that need to  be tended to <br/>
first.  One of our boys could not play.  It was almost  like he had scraped <br/>
and scrapped for everything for so long, and was forced to  grow up sooo young, <br/>
there just wasn&#39;t any play in him.  Hard to  explain.  Doing much better now.<br/>
 <br/>
How old is the child you are adopting?  Just letting them get to know  you <br/>
and feel safe can take 6 months or more, I believe that&#39;s why being home is  SO <br/>
important with adoptive kids.  It takes this gigantic monkey off the  kids <br/>
back (school) which most foster kids struggle with anyhow, and lets them  focus <br/>
on relationships and learning how to function in a regular, permanent  family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199701495">Kathryn,<br/>
   <br/>
  Two of my children were adopted.  At the time we were more eclectic or relaxed home schoolers.  It is actually my seeking the best way to meet their needs that led us to find unschooling.  It has been an absolute thrill to find out how wonderful it is for ALL of my children.  I credit unschooling for being the reason my birth children have developed such a great sibling relationship with the children we adopted.<br/>
  One of the things that has really become true for our family is that we have five kids.  Some are biological, some are adopted.  I just can&#39;t seem to remember which is which.<br/>
  It took some time to get to that place.  While it&#39;s definitely not magic, unschooling is a huge help.  One thing to be aware of, if you are adopting out of foster care or institutionalized care, I found I needed to go slow.  They were accustomed to rigid routines and seemed to find a certain amount of security in a predictable environment.  I had to go slow or they would seem to think mom and dad don&#39;t care what we do.  I had to transform that thinking into mom and dad care deeply, but you get to choose.  It took time for them to be able to choose without it causing frustration.  They also needed to test to see if we really were interested in what they care about.  It took them a lot of time to find out who they are.  To a certain extent, they needed a chance to lean how to play.  Feel free to email me off list if you want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805417366">Hi Nancy...<br/>
<br/>
My three were also adopted through foster care at the age of 5, 8 & <br/>
11. They&#39;re now 7, 10 & 13. They&#39;re siblings and had been in foster <br/>
care for 4 years. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to chat more off list (I don&#39;t want to get off topic <br/>
talking about adoption here) so feel free to contact me. I run a <br/>
community for adoptive & waiting parents, the link is in my <br/>
signature (when you get to the site, click &quot;forums&quot;) if you&#39;re <br/>
interested. <br/>
