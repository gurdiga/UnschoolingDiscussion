This is my recollection... so don&#39;t quote me!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that too--that in the town squares of little towns there would be <br/>
boxes around, or someone would get up on a crate in front of a store and make <br/>
a speech.  They didn&#39;t have microphones, so getting up higher than the crowd <br/>
helped the voices carry too.<br/>

So now more about the soap boxes themselves.  Was the soap stored in wooden<br/>
crates when brought for sale to a general store?  (For some reason I thought<br/>
there was some mysterious &#39;soap box&#39; that I&#39;d never seen.)<br/>

Just about everything was in crates.  Cardboard wasn&#39;t a going thing yet <br/>
(except for flat paper-kind-of uses).  [Anyone know when corrugated cardboard <br/>
came on the scene?]   I don&#39;t know why people gave speeches on &quot;soap boxes&quot; <br/>
instead of &quot;fruit crates&quot; or &quot;oatmeal boxes,&quot; though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161876598">1871 for corrugated &quot;paper&quot; as it was known then.<br/>
<br/>
Soap boxes were used because they were solid.  Crates were slat sided and<br/>
not as sturdy.  Grains came in gunny sacks and canvas bags.<br/>
<br/>
There use to be a site with pictures all about soap boxes that the kidlets<br/>
discovered a few years ago (they wanted to know why soap operas were called<br/>
soap operas but they found lots of cool sites that had to do with soap) but<br/>
when I went to find it the link didn&#39;t work.<br/>

high school (we all left skid marks in the halls beating a path out of the<br/>
