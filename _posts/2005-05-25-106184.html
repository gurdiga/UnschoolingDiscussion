<div id="ygrps-yiv-39313011">I was looking for a homeschooling blogring I had seen, and found some other  <br/>
stuff that was more fun:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Homeschoolers are FREAKS, and DORKS! All they do is wear bonnets and churn  <br/>
butter...then get a so called &quot;education&quot; from their mommys...the TOTAL lack of <br/>
 sociallity makes them wierdo&#39;s...GET THEM AWAY FROM ME! DOWN WITH  <br/>
HOMESCHOOLING!!<br/>

in sociallity,  webring-wise.)<br/>

Now I know there&#39;s quite a bit of blogs for  homeschoolers, but what about <br/>
the fair weather homeschoolers?  Those, &#39;it&#39;s the greatest thing since sliced <br/>
bread&#39; days can easily turn to the  I&#39;m so sick of being trapped in this house <br/>
I&#39;m going to kill my invisible cat!&#39;  days. So if you&#39;ve ever wondered and <br/>
wanted to discuss how the other evil half  (known as public-schoolers) live, or <br/>
maybe just want to mock them, come  join.<br/>

This bloggring if for  the few non-nerdy homeschoolers out their. Consider <br/>
yourself a  nerdy homeschooler if: 1. You have any posters in your room of  <br/>
Harry Potter and or Lord of the Rings. 2. You think girls have &quot;cooties&quot;.  3. Your <br/>
mom moved you ahead three grades in school. 4. You have a Star  Wars <br/>
backpack. 5. You think an I-pod is a type of car. You think Jump 5 is  the coolest <br/>
band. 6. You placed 1st in the local spelling bee. 7. You&#39;re a  teenager and you <br/>
still wear light up shoes.<br/>

[I like that one.  I WISH they had  light-up shoes my size.  I mean... <br/>
teenagers&#39; sizes.  (yeah...  that&#39;s what I meant...)]<br/>

<br/>
My two cents is that our kids are natural and school kids are warped.<br/>
<br/>
The bonnets and butter churns show some imagination, but a kind of loose grasp on reality.  I hope when this kid gets out of school she can have a fulfilling career as a comedian.  A sense of humor is a great thing to have.<br/>
<br/>
Normally I want to smack anyone who disses *mommies*, but our life is full of sunshine and chocolate and burritos and playdates and swimming pools (ok, wading pools) and C. S. Lewis and Star Wars that I know I&#39;m blessed and the way zany wisecracks roll right off.<br/>

PS  But I am a dork, because I was just going to log on to the &#39;net to see if anyone had written some good L. M. Bujold fan fiction.<br/>

PPS  My husband has been fighting bronchitis and has a bad cough that sounds like a wookie in a blender, and yet we&#39;re still having a happy afternoon.</div>

OK, I&#39;m as big a dork, but an incredibly uninformed one!!!  Where do you<br/>
find Lois McMaster Bujold fan fiction???<br/>

I was just hoping for some, so went out looking (after forgetting twice).<br/>
<br/>
I had to change my Google search string a couple of times, but found <br/>
some fic linked on her official webpage.  (I thought it was a little <br/>
unusual to find such on the author&#39;s official page.)  Here&#39;s the subpage:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dendarii.com/inspired.html">http://www.dendarii.com/inspired.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I just found it and haven&#39;t read any of it yet, so I can&#39;t speak to the <br/>
quality.  Her next book to be published is a fantasy novel to be set in <br/>
the country of Challion, not a space opera on Barrayar.  I&#39;d rather have <br/>
the latter, hence the fanfic search.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are a few on fanfiction.net.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/l/804/3/0/1/1/0/0/0/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/l/804/3/0/1/1/0/0/0/1/</a><br/>
<br/>
Fanfiction.net is called &quot;the pit&quot; because of all the really bad Harry <br/>
Potter fanfiction there, but you can find some gems and this may be a <br/>
more mature fandom so the stories might be better.<br/>
I noticed there is a crossover where Snape meets Mark Vorkosigan at <br/>
Hogwarts. I love crossover with my favorite Potions Master---off to read.<br/>

Also a firefly crossover<br/>

Serenity comes out.<br/>

him ;-)<br/>
