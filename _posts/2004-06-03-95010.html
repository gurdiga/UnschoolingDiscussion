I rightly assume, and am willing to act on my reasonable assumption. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;But past events tell a different story! :-( &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people just don&#39;t know what they want.  I refuse to believe anyone would <br/>
accidentally stumble in here and stay very long but still not know what the <br/>
topic of discussion involved.     And anyone who CAN or has done so is (in my <br/>
opinion) not analytical enough in a philosophical way to be a good unschooler <br/>
anyway, and there&#39;s no sense blaming the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
Is it wrong, y&#39;think, to assume that participants here (those who choose to <br/>
post, I mean) are intelligent adults?   It amazes me when someone will say &quot;you <br/>
don&#39;t treat me like you treat your children.&quot;   Maybe they mean &quot;you don&#39;t <br/>
let me fart around for six years, confident that I&#39;ll learn what I need.&quot;   But <br/>
I think more often it means &quot;You expected me to be an adult.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be much less respectful to treat people like they were <br/>
fragile or slow-witted.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m off the topic, but probably that&#39;s okay.  The world is full of <br/>
topics and facets thereof, and the past, presents and futures of those aspects, <br/>
and the connections of those to the badillion OTHER topics with their <br/>
umpty-dimensional realities.   <br/>
<br/>
Connections.<br/>

Some people are resistant.   Some people aren&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
       Couldn&#39;t it also be asked in an unschooling sense, as in why don&#39;t we <br/>
share unschooling with new adults using the same principles we use so <br/>
successfully with our children? <br/>
<br/>
       Others touched on this question, Sandra I think with the irony of <br/>
sharing unschooling in lecture form, to neat rows of note-takers. And I&#39;ve been <br/>
wondering why I for one am endlessly patient and much more likely to respond <br/>
with humor to people who already &quot;get&quot; it than to people who don&#39;t seem to get it <br/>
at all. You&#39;d think the latter would be more like children needing the best <br/>
I&#39;ve got to offer.<br/>
<br/>
       And having rules, not taking people&#39;s feelings seriously when we think <br/>
they are &quot;wrong&quot; and sometimes just saying &quot;because I said so, and if you <br/>
don&#39;t like it, you need to leave.&quot; I am NOT saying these things aren&#39;t necessary <br/>
in online adult conversation. But I&#39;m uncomfortable to realize that learning <br/>
about unschooling can feel pretty authoritarian, if not like school then an <br/>
awful lot like professional experts or maybe church.<br/>
<br/>
       That kind of thing. Can unschooling be unschooled?<br/>

about something. <br/>
<br/>
I worked at a computer help desk for years and even when I was <br/>
supposed to be doing something else, still got asked questions <br/>
because I gave nicer answers than some. <br/>
<br/>
For a while, my dh and I were both working at A Famous University and <br/>
we&#39;d see one of &quot;our&quot; professors on the news, as the world&#39;s leading <br/>
expert in such-and-such and we&#39;d giggle about his/her inability to <br/>
find the on/off switch on his/her computer while being a genius in <br/>
other areas.<br/>
<br/>
So now I give people the benefit of the doubt that they are generally <br/>
intelligent and just haven&#39;t used their brain enough in one <br/>
particular area, or haven&#39;t been exposed to some ideas, like <br/>
unschooling, or are so afraid (e.g., of having WILD children) that <br/>
they can&#39;t open their brains and see the button on the screen that <br/>
says &quot;click here&quot;. <br/>

Sometimes I&#39;m wrong, that&#39;s for sure. <br/>

<br/>
And there is just a lot of information on unschooling that is <br/>
inaccurate so people think they are unschooling when they are not (that <br/>
was me).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my take anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Julie B<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I came here initially for resources - you know, good ideas for <br/>
strewing. I had no idea that what I did wasn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; unschooling. It <br/>
took a month of reconsidering my entire parenting philosophy to &quot;get <br/>
it&quot; and I felt a bit chagrined on several occasions.<br/>
<br/>
But the good news is that the constant affirmation that kids thrive <br/>
when respected, loved and attended to won the day. And my understanding <br/>
of unschooling expanded to include every aspect of parenting. I think <br/>
that&#39;s where the rubber meets the road.<br/>
<br/>
I read on another site the other day: &quot;We do classical schooling in the <br/>
mornings but unschool in the afternoons.&quot; Clearly there&#39;s lots of <br/>
misunderstanding of what unschooling is out there.</div>

different ways?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
       I don&#39;t know. Would it be useful to think of the ways that what we do <br/>
to help people unschool successfully IS like unschooling itself?  For example, <br/>
seems to me all those intriguing little hints and mentions in various <br/>
encounters could count as the strewing principle. &lt;grin&gt;   JJ<br/>

 </span></blockquote>==========================================<br/>
<br/>
Gee, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s unschooling in a nutshell. My kids do things all<br/>
the time that could appear quite schooly and go far towards &quot;fulfilling the<br/>
requirements of school.&quot; Those are exactly the kinds of things I talk about<br/>
for my portfolio reviews. Of course, my kids are still young so that could<br/>
change, but I kind of doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
This morning for instance, Emily wanted to play a game where we tried to<br/>
come up with all the words that start with D. So, we were all calling out as<br/>
many D words as we could think of over second breakfast. Not long afterward,<br/>
she wanted to know what 9,999 + 203 was. She&#39;s fascinated by numbers and is<br/>
constantly asking me things like that. I don&#39;t know about hers, but boy,<br/>
have my math skills been sharpened over the past year!<br/>
<br/>
What makes this unschooling is that I had nothing to do with either game. I<br/>
didn&#39;t sit the kids down and tell them that these were &quot;good&quot; things for<br/>
them to do and that they should really spend their time doing this rather<br/>
than playing x, y or z. I didn&#39;t make them do all the C words yesterday, the<br/>
B words the day before and the A words the day before that. We&#39;re not going<br/>
to do all the E words tomorrow or the next day unless that spontaneously<br/>
comes up in our living. I also didn&#39;t tell Em to go look the D words up in<br/>
the dictionary or to get a pencil and paper and figure out the addition<br/>
problem for herself. Those might have been very schooly responses. I did,<br/>
however, tell her later in the day after another addition lob that the neat<br/>
thing about number is when you add two even number or two odd numbers, the<br/>
answer is always even. But when you add and even plus an odd, then the<br/>
answer is odd. She thought that was pretty cool because she&#39;s interested in<br/>
evens and odds now. Come to think of it, I need to show her how to do the<br/>
evens/odds finger throwing game...<br/>
<br/>
Back to my point: My youngest daughter is really into writing. She<br/>
painstakingly writes out all her favorite character&#39;s names in her diary,<br/>
loves to write with the quill she bought down in Colonial Williamsburg. I<br/>
figure the number of times she does this per month of her own accord go much<br/>
further toward her learning to write, spell and have good penmanship than<br/>
all the curriculum touted in the country and enforced on children today. My<br/>
kids are learning tremendous amounts every day, some of which is schooly<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that along with all the other wonderful, fun, amazing<br/>
things we do on a daily basis, several things &quot;fulfilling the requirements<br/>
of school&quot; emerge without fail and without force.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe because we all spend SO much time with our children we are impatient <br/>
with other adults who want to be treated like children?     <br/>
<br/>
Although I have a lot of confidence that my kids will learn what they need, <br/>
there are situations in which they need to be as alert as possible and do what <br/>
they went to do.  Marty, when he played ice hockey.  They need him to do his <br/>
best right then, or he&#39;s wasting the other kids&#39; time and the coach&#39;s time.   <br/>
Kirby, at karate.  It&#39;s not okay to stop during a class and go look at the <br/>
photos on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
-=-       And having rules, -=-<br/>
<br/>
Like guidelines for this list?<br/>
<br/>
Holly has kids over.  One left a can in the den.  If it&#39;s still there in a <br/>
few hours, I&#39;ll ask him to go get it.  It&#39;s not a rule, it&#39;s a principle.  I <br/>
imagine, though, that someone else will pass through there later and bring it <br/>
upstairs.  Or when these guys decide it&#39;s time to crush cans (we&#39;ve saved cans <br/>
this week for them to crush because they like the can crusher we have mounted on <br/>
the wall), they&#39;ll probably remember it&#39;s down there.  <br/>
<br/>
Is that &quot;a rule,&quot; that I think cans should be crushed and put in the <br/>
recycling?  Probably.  Maybe.  If they want to continue to have overnighters here, <br/>
they&#39;ll do best not to waste time or be tacky.  But they&#39;re not tacky, because <br/>
they like to be here.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But I&#39;m uncomfortable to realize that learning <br/>
about unschooling can feel pretty authoritarian.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nobody needs our permission, or our certification, or our ANYTHING to <br/>
unschool, or to learn about unschooling.  They just need to be cooperative enough if <br/>
they want to stay on this list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Can unschooling be unschooled?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Though I can point back to lots of things through the years that contributed <br/>
to my own understanding and ease with unschooling, when I decided I wanted to <br/>
do that, I had already looked at both unschooling and structured homeschooling <br/>
families.  I subscribed to Growing Without Schooling.  I bought and read a <br/>
copy of &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
In those days, there was nothing like this available.  People can learn as <br/>
much in a month now as took a year or more in those days.  But they don&#39;t HAVE <br/>
to do that.  They have tons of options, including asking around, subscribing to <br/>
HEM or Life Learning, reading Holt...<br/>
<br/>
If people want to take a long time to get there, they can.  If they want to <br/>
take a couple of giant steps and get there this week, they can.  If they want <br/>
to waste a bunch of my time and insult me as they maybe think about getting <br/>
there, or say they&#39;ve been there since their kids were born, or that they don&#39;t <br/>
have to listen to us, nanny-nanny-boo-boo,  that&#39;s not okay with me.  They can <br/>
go away and NOT waste my time; that&#39;s fine.  But to stay in the faces of <br/>
unschoolers who just honestly want to discuss it on a more analytical level is <br/>

 </span></blockquote>As one who came to unschooling very late - and mindful parenting <br/>
(which I think is different from unschooling) even later - it was a <br/>
slow - and sometimes painful process.<br/>
<br/>
Partly because I was trained as a teacher (that&#39;s why the<br/>
unschooling <br/>
part took so long), partly because I had always been<br/>
&quot;admired&quot; (or <br/>
something - can&#39;t think of a better word - &quot;looked-up-to&quot; <br/>
or &quot;respected&quot; maybe?)  as a really &quot;good&quot; mom by<br/>
both friends and <br/>
family, it took alot to shake those firm beliefs that I was doing the <br/>
RIGHT thing - the best thing. I realize now that it was my kids <br/>
ability to adapt to me that made me look so good.  I controlled it <br/>
all - bedtime(curfew), food, videos, we didn&#39;t  even have a TV, <br/>
schoolwork after we started homeschooling - and still  my children <br/>
were respectful, happy (mostly), and &quot;successful&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
THEN<br/>
<br/>
I found out that my boys - at 19 (while not living at home anymore) <br/>
and at 16 were making some choices that I was surprised at. I guess <br/>
surprised is too mild  - devastated more like. The thing they were <br/>
doing wasn&#39;t horrible, or mean, or even unusual, but to me it was <br/>
devastating. I felt betrayed.  I had done everything &quot;right&quot;<br/>
- how could this be? <br/>

analytical enough in a philosophical way to be a good unschooler <br/>
anyway, and there&#39;s no sense blaming the rest of us.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem was not seeing that traditional parenting <br/>
interferes with unschooling in a very big way.  The biggest way. <br/>
<br/>
I really think that as long as a child has a mindful parent, they can <br/>
sail through anything - that includes school. It&#39;s not ideal but <br/>
mindful parenting is the key.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  Well, we TRY to discourage people from learning from big mistakes, <br/>
e.g. messing up the first kid badly and then deciding to raise the next <br/>
kid completely differently.  BUT I think there are fine and valid <br/>
reasons for discouraging that kind of learning.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes we don&#39;t want people who are hemi-semi-demi-unschooling to <br/>
give us the credit for the (poor) outcome that we think they might <br/>
have.  So they do get kind of &quot;disavowed&quot;.  They aren&#39;t told they must <br/>
change their ways.  But they are told not to attribute their practices <br/>
to this list if we think their practices aren&#39;t sound.  So to some <br/>
extent, this list tends to discourage the starting to unschool by <br/>
dipping your toe in slowly and then stopping method.<br/>

and by FAR the most important - taking the plunge and learning how <br/>
unschooling works by DOING it.<br/>

I love the bike riding analogy - and have to say that no matter how <br/>
many articles one reads about bicycling or how much time spent watching <br/>
people ride bikes, you just can&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; bike riding until you <br/>
ride a bike. Unschooling is truly the same way.<br/>

they are young, the school requirements are primarily intended to help <br/>
kids learn skills - reading, writing, basic numerical concepts. Well - <br/>
most of what young kids DO is helping them learn those things so it <br/>
isn&#39;t hard to see that they actually ARE fulfilling the requirements.<br/>
<br/>
But - when the kids are older, the requirements are more specific. <br/>
Eighth grade is American History. If the kid is into Magic, the <br/>
Gathering, skateboarding, and Russian novels &lt;G&gt; it is hard to call <br/>
that fulfilling the American History requirement.<br/>

getting what they &quot;need.&quot; They aren&#39;t focused on watching the learning process unfold and <br/>
then quantifying it for a year end assessment.<br/>

They are following a child&#39;s natural interests for some of the day and then using a <br/>
workbook for math. Or they are teaching an 8 year old how to read using a phonics <br/>
program, but are following a child&#39;s desires for non-essentials.<br/>
<br/>
And you are right. As kids get older, anxiety grows. Moms want to be sure their kids aren&#39;t <br/>
missing anything that would be important. So instead of letting kids set the agenda, mom <br/>
tries to find better kid-friendly materials or allows the child to structure his day or she <br/>
uses a minimum of curricula with most of the day free.<br/>
<br/>
All of these approaches are seen as unschooling in some circles. It was easier for me to <br/>
ignore school requirements when my kids were little. But the pressure to &quot;prepare for <br/>
college&quot; undid much of my early unschooling enthusiasm. <br/>
<br/>
The only way I was able to make the shift myself was to completely give up fulfilling <br/>
college admissions requirements. I really had to face down my fears and admit that I was <br/>
still enmeshed with the education model that school offered me.<br/>
<br/>
Once I let that go, I really did find unschooling to be something totally different than the <br/>
both/and model I had tried to make work before.<br/>

They do stuff all the time that doesn&#39;t look like &quot;school stuff,&quot; but<br/>
they&#39;re still learning. I just don&#39;t believe it&#39;s possible to live in this<br/>
world and not learn. It honestly doesn&#39;t matter to me what they choose to<br/>
learn about or do as long as they are happy, growing and loving their life.<br/>
My kids go days without doing something that looks schooly, but invariably,<br/>
it pops up again. After the Survivor final show, the girls were writing all<br/>
kinds of names down on slips of paper and asked me for a pottery jug like<br/>
the one used in tribal councils. They played their own version of Survivor<br/>
for a week, writing names down on slips of paper every day. Writing.<br/>
Couldn&#39;t&#39;ve, wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve made &#39;em do it, but they did it on their own.<br/>

But - when the kids are older, the requirements are more specific.<br/>
Eighth grade is American History. If the kid is into Magic, the<br/>
Gathering, skateboarding, and Russian novels &lt;G&gt; it is hard to call<br/>
that fulfilling the American History requirement.<br/>
=================<br/>
<br/>
See, there&#39;s the rub. Maryland has this really annoying legal wording<br/>
&quot;regular and thorough instruction in the subjects usually taught&quot;--that&#39;s<br/>
what really gets me going. Why in the world, should a person have to learn<br/>
American History or anything for that matter just because someone else says<br/>
that it&#39;s time to do that? ARGH! That is my biggest, biggest beef with the<br/>
MD hsing law and with curriculum in general! Everything Pam named that the<br/>
child might be interested in offers wonderful learning opportunities. That<br/>
child, pursuing Magic, skateboarding and Russian novels, is learning a<br/>
tremendous amount, much of which could relatively easily be translated into<br/>
schooly terms though it likely looks nothing like school. The only thing<br/>
that has changed is that some arbitrary person has laid some arbitrary time<br/>
table over top a child&#39;s life and judged them unworthy.<br/>
<br/>
Damn if I&#39;d want someone to do that to my life! My passion for several years<br/>
has been learning all about gardening, landscaping, plant identification,<br/>
Latin names, etc. Now, I&#39;m learning about chickens, heirloom breeds,<br/>
layers--chickens, for heaven&#39;s sake! Never would&#39;ve predicted that! Point<br/>
is, I&#39;m learning all the time about different things that fit no one&#39;s<br/>
timetable or agenda but my own (chickens don&#39;t even fit dh&#39;s, but we won&#39;t<br/>
go there *g*). But my life is rich, fulfilling and worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
Once we remove artificial timetables and expectations, kids learn. Many of<br/>
them even learn despite those things, but they shouldn&#39;t have to.  Kids<br/>
learn all the time about all kinds of things in a way that&#39;s broader and<br/>
richer than any contrived curriculum could be. I honestly believe that. If I<br/>
can see all this in my children now and trust them to find their own path<br/>
through their world, then as they get older, that trust is the same. My<br/>
children may look different and their path may have changed, but my trust<br/>
and faith in them should be the same if not stronger because it has so many<br/>
years of foundation under it. That&#39;s what I hope for myself and my children<br/>
anyway. Time will tell.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m with you. It&#39;s hard work to make the shift. I shift, then I take it back, then I shift some <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest help in changing, though, has been working with teens who aren&#39;t my kids. <br/>
I&#39;ve been amazed at how many are comfortable lying about who they are to please their <br/>
parents. (And these are kids raised with religious convictions...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848137222">** I love the bike riding analogy - and have to say that no matter how<br/>
many articles one reads about bicycling or how much time spent watching<br/>
people ride bikes, you just can&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; bike riding until you<br/>
ride a bike. Unschooling is truly the same way.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or to go back to a really old analogy, you can&#39;t learn to swim sitting <br/>
on the side of the pool chatting.<br/>
<br/>
--Betsy    (who learns many other types of things from chatting)<br/>
<br/>
Oh!!!  Maybe that&#39;s the confusion.  When I&#39;m reading here and writing <br/>
posts here, and chatting, I feel like I&#39;m &quot;learning&quot; a lot about <br/>
unschooling because I&#39;m thinking and I&#39;m picking up ideas.  So some <br/>
learning is clearly happening.  But I&#39;m NOT learning about MY son from <br/>
being online and batting words around.  (He&#39;s asleep now, but other <br/>
times I&#39;m tuning him out when I&#39;m on the computer.)  I&#39;m not &quot;walking <br/>
the walk&quot; or &quot;riding the bike&quot; &lt;g&gt; or seeing how my child lives and <br/>
learns when I&#39;m here in front of the computer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a lot like the difference between &quot;classroom learning&quot; (no offense) <br/>
and &quot;life learning&quot;.  It&#39;s certainly the difference between secondhand <br/>
studying and firsthand experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540690946">I think what happens when people who come to this list and jump right in, with out reading and getting a good feel for the &quot;tone&quot; of the group, get offended. They want everyone to be sweetness and light. Then they post and their &quot;tone&quot; tends to be confrontational and snarky and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed tends to set people off more than enything. <br/>
<br/>
Then you have those that come in and read for a while and then ask a question, and the &quot;tone&quot;-intent if you will-is different and it does come across, and they are much more likely to get a better, more open, response.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to believe that every one that come to this group is coming with the intent to be an intelligent adult :), but I don&#39;t think that has always been the case, some come spoiling for a fight, and the longer and more you&#39;ve read you can tell by the end of the first post what&#39;s going on. <br/>
<br/>
I think that  if you come to unschooling with an open mind and an open heart you are able to get more from these exchanges and you are more likely to embrace every thing that tends to fall into place with unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
If you come with fear and doubt, and everyone that is trying to help has to break through all the doubts and fear with each new concept, it takes longer, and may never happen as fully as if you can let go and let it happen.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve strayed waaayyy off topic here, but it is something I&#39;ve notice, as a long time lurker and seldom poster in this forum, that the intent, tone, meaning what ever you want to call it, does come through and people respond to that and then everything seems to escalate.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Is it wrong, y&#39;think, to assume that participants here (those who choose to <br/>
&gt; &gt; post, I mean) are intelligent adults?   It amazes me when someone will say <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;you <br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t treat me like you treat your children.&quot;   Maybe they mean &quot;you don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; let me fart around for six years, confident that I&#39;ll learn what I need.&quot;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; But <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think more often it means &quot;You expected me to be an adult.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think it would be much less respectful to treat people like they were <br/>
&gt; &gt; fragile or slow-witted.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;        I really do wonder about this, and have before. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;        Couldn&#39;t it also be asked in an unschooling sense, as in why don&#39;t we <br/>
&gt; share unschooling with new adults using the same principles we use so <br/>
&gt; successfully with our children? <br/>
