<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899000085">Hi Sheila,<br/>
 <br/>
I have had the same issue that you describe with your daughter with my son.<br/>
My oldest son 13, goes for days without a shower. Being that he has reached<br/>
puberty, for me it has been not as much of an issue as it has been for my<br/>
husband.<br/>
 <br/>
He also USED to be with way with brushing his teeth. He would go for days,<br/>
weeks even sometimes without brushing. <br/>
 <br/>
My husband would constantly nag him about it to the point when he would just<br/>
tune him out kind of like it seems that your daughter does to you from what<br/>
you wrote. For me, I let it go and never pressured him about any of it,<br/>
because I did not and do not want brushing and showering to be made to feel<br/>
like a &quot;punishment&quot; because if it is, then the resistance is much worse. It<br/>
is kind of like being in &quot;school&quot; and being forced to learn what we never<br/>
wanted to learn in the first place, we resist that to because we choose to<br/>
learn what, where, when, why and how we wish to learn, which is why we<br/>
unschool is it not?<br/>
 <br/>
There are times now where he will surprise me and my dh and shower. I<br/>
remember a time a few weeks ago when my dh and I went grocery shopping<br/>
(Chris being 13 will stay home and watch his two younger brothers ages 6 1/2<br/>
and 8) and when we returned, I had noticed he had changed his clothes, but<br/>
did not say anything. Later, Chris had announced that while we were gone, he<br/>
had showered. I said great honey I am glad. I try not to make too much of a<br/>
deal of whether he showers or does not shower simply because I know if I do,<br/>
it will make showering seem like a good/bad &quot;thing&quot; to do and I want him to<br/>
shower because HE wants to and he enjoys it and keeping himself clean, not<br/>
because it is good or bad to do or not to do.<br/>
 <br/>
The only thing I will do is every once in a while give a gentle reminder<br/>
here or there if his brothers have bathed or if I have just gotten out of<br/>
the shower, I might say something like &quot;The shower is all yours Chris&quot;. I<br/>
never tell him about how bad he may or may not smell. To him, this is a blow<br/>
to his self esteem, because it makes him feel as if he is not &quot;good enough&quot;<br/>
or &quot;not good enough for me or others to be around him&quot; simply because he is<br/>
dirty or smelly. Not to mention the fact that what may seem like smelly to<br/>
us, may not be offensive to them simply because they do not know what their<br/>
own bodies threshold is for smell. I know for Chris, it will take until he<br/>
can physically smell himself as smelly or dirty before he will shower or put<br/>
deodorant on. Me or anyone else merely reminding them of the fact that they<br/>
smell, not only makes him feel self conscious and bad about themselves, but<br/>
it also does not enable them to find their own threshold to know. Just like<br/>
when you feel you need a shower, it is not because someone has told you you<br/>
are smelly, but it is in fact, because you yourself can feel or sense or<br/>
actually smell that you are not clean.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, you modeling the behavior of showering, putting on deodorant everyday<br/>
can help tremendously. It may not seem like it, like it conveys alot, but it<br/>
does. If you show your daughter daily that you take pride in yourself, your<br/>
appearance, and your body, then she is more likely to see that and take<br/>
pride in herself. This could be why she was interested in showering if you<br/>
did her toenails afterwards. She needs someone to show her how to be pretty<br/>
in a way she feels comfortable with, and modeling that in that way does go a<br/>
long way. Maybe you could have a &quot;make over&quot; date just you girls, where you<br/>
shower (separately if she wishes her privacy, and then do each others hair<br/>
and makeup, and maybe even let her play dress up with some of your<br/>
clothes!:) <br/>
 <br/>
Rather than talking down to my kids about how good it is for them to be<br/>
clean, I would rather want to make it an activity to enjoy. I want my kids<br/>
to find enjoyment in loving and caring for their bodies, not it being a<br/>
something that they &quot;have to do&quot;. So I say he USED to do this with teeth<br/>
brushing up until 6 months ago, because one day about 6 months ago, he came<br/>
to me and asked me &quot;Mom, can we go to Walmart today?&quot; Of course, I am<br/>
thinking he wants the newest computer or electronic gadget right? He<br/>
continues&quot;because, I would like to pick out my own toothpaste and my own<br/>
toothbrush because I do not like the toothpaste here in the house and my<br/>
toothbrush hurts my teeth and I want to have something of my own&quot; WHOA!!!<br/>
Blew me over with a ton of bricks! :)<br/>
 <br/>
Needless to say, he had &quot;deschooled&quot; toothbrushing and was ready to move on<br/>
in life. And I dropped everything and immediately took him to Walmart,<br/>
quietly celebrating on the inside. What Chris needed was the time and space,<br/>
WITHOUT nagging and pressure to see the value of keeping his teeth healthy<br/>
all on his own because HE wanted too, not because someone was telling him<br/>
too! Patience and time was what was needed on my part, something as a parent<br/>
which is much easier for me to do than most. I think that for me it is<br/>
because I am in tuned with my kids rhythms and movements through life more<br/>
and I have no problem giving them as much time as needed to work through<br/>
whatever it is they need to.<br/>
 <br/>
Most parents, like my husband, are so into the fact that they have to be<br/>
neat and clean that they forget that our children are individuals and need<br/>
to be respected enough for them to figure out the value of something and<br/>
that in doing so it takes ALOT of time and patience.<br/>
 <br/>
So now, every night I hear his toothbrush twirling (he got one of those<br/>
Crest electric ones!:) and I smile on the inside. Chalk one up for life. NOW<br/>
.....onto the showers!:)<br/>

Had he taken a shower, he would have been doing nothing but rolling over and <br/>
doing what someone else was wanting him to do.  In power struggle terms, if he <br/>
showered he lost.  If he showered his dad won.<br/>
<br/>
I still sometimes set something up like that with one of my kids about <br/>
something I really want them to do, but I notice it more quickly than I used to.   <br/>
It helps more to give them some data and possible outcomes and let them decide. <br/>
 But it the information is too thinly veiled direction, they might take the <br/>
possible eventual negative consequences over the immediately negative loss of <br/>
freedom and choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507949917">I totally understand what is being said about the power struggle of <br/>
wanting kids to bathe when they don&#39;t want to and letting go of that. <br/>
But where do you all draw the line of being considerate of others?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I am in favor of giving children more than the conventional <br/>
amount of freedom, but what if it (the smell) is REALLY bothering the <br/>
rest of the family? Do they all just have to endure it indefinitely? I <br/>
have a 15 yo sister, a 13 yo brother and an 11 yo sister and if any one <br/>
of them goes more than a day or two without bathing they get really <br/>
stinky.<br/>

Seriously asking, not trying to be difficult.<br/>

Were they unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
I think it matters.<br/>
For this list it matters.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a what if unless an unschooling family has a real situation.   <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here have a child who has been living in an unschooling <br/>
environment for at least three years, who is now in that new-puberty phase, and who has <br/>
not started taking baths after a few months?<br/>
<br/>
I have three who shower daily.<br/>
<br/>
When they were younger and just getting there, I bought them deoderant, and <br/>
put deoderant soup in their showers and whatever kinds of soap and shampoo they <br/>
might like.  Occasionally I remember reminding Kirby, before he was going <br/>
somewhere, or if he was just hanging out and I could smell him, I&#39;d ask him if he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind taking a shower before dinner, or whatever.   Because it wasn&#39;t <br/>
an ultimatum, it wasn&#39;t a power struggle.  Because they know they can say <br/>
&quot;No, I&#39;d really rather do this other thing,&quot; they&#39;re easily willing to say yes.  <br/>
Lots.  I say yes to them a lot, they say yes a lot.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519242626">i have an 11 year old and she is in the phase of not taking showers. it <br/>
actually started with the teeth brushing (which i did try to control too <br/>
much) and then went to the shower. for years she showered or bathed every <br/>
day and brushed her teeth like a million time (ok maybe less) a day. then <br/>
she said she didn&#39;t feel like it. it started at about 9 and then it wasn&#39;t <br/>
so bad because she didn&#39;t smell bad even after a week. now in the past maybe <br/>
8 months she does. i usually let it go and she will eventually take one when <br/>
she is ready and then she is in there playing until she runs out of hot <br/>
water. if it goes too long and she starts smelling i ask her to shower <br/>
because she sleeps with us a lot and i don&#39;t want to smell her. most times <br/>
she&#39;s okay with doing so. i am really confident that she will out grow this <br/>
phase. her friend who is a year older has just started caring about this.<br/>
<br/>
one suggestion for people who have a yard and a hose: give them a bottle of <br/>
shampoo and the hose (in the warmer weather) and let them go outside and <br/>
spray off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249601575">My oldest, 13, was a bit reluctant to shower about 1<br/>
1/2 years ago but as soon as a friend commented on her<br/>
body odor it all changed.  She showers every day now. <br/>
I don&#39;t remember a big struggle, I just left it alone<br/>
and only mentioned that I could smell her once in a<br/>
great while.  She made the change on her own,<br/>
somewhere along the way.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest, 6, is more reistant but if I mention a<br/>
bath and give it time he&#39;ll usually change his mind. <br/>
Of course, I really enjoy my showers and baths and<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that if I tell him that if he&#39;s not ready<br/>
*I* will be going in, he jumps at the chance to be<br/>
first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551887939">My just-turned-12-y.o. is not keen on taking showers. If I ask him if he <br/>
wants to take a shower he will say yes and then forget. Usually if I get <br/>
the bathroom ready for him by putting down the bathmat, getting a clean <br/>
towel, staarting the water, etc., he is happy to go in. I think it&#39;s not <br/>
that he doesn&#39;t want to shower but that he doesn&#39;t have the internal <br/>
motivation yet to shower himself, so I still help him. I think he wants the <br/>
mom-care that comes with the help, too.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t yet smell like a puberty boy. I know what they smell like <br/>
because they visit here plus I had three younger brothers :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322123500">This topic is so interesting to me! My stepson (as I&#39;ve said before on <br/>
the site) LOVES to shower, will shower 3 times a day at times but NEVER <br/>
brushes his teeth. His breath is HORRID! His teeth are caked in plaque <br/>
- not pretty! We&#39;ve mentioned this to him as straightforward as <br/>
possible but it really makes no difference and we&#39;ve pretty much given <br/>
up. (When our daughter was 3 she told him his breath smelled awful - <br/>
the way she said it had us laughing inside! She was so blunt!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, We figure one of his girlfriends will let him know eventually! <br/>
And you know how peers can be much more convincing than parents, <br/>
especially to schooled kids (which he is, by choice)!! I hope someday <br/>
he realizes how gorgeous his smile is and will want to take care to <br/>
keep it that way!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309635522">Heyas all,<br/>
<br/>
These issues run deep as those of you who are dealing with them may <br/>
know since teeth came up I will share my life experience here;<br/>
<br/>
When I was a toddler/preschooler I was addicted (only slightly <br/>
hahaha) to AIM toothpaste I remeber eating it heheheheheheh as well <br/>
as teeth brushing with no trouble.<br/>
<br/>
One day there was is that Colgate the red hot tooth paste? I forget <br/>
but the taste was HOT and different I was not impressed. Later that <br/>
day (I don&#39;t know if maybe my mom noticed I hadn&#39;t liked it or was <br/>
just noticing it was in there and maybe didn&#39;t like it either* she <br/>
was telling my dad he should have bought AIM if only for my sake <br/>
seeing as the tooth paste was hot).<br/>
<br/>
When I got AIM back I was happy but something was different. Years <br/>
later I hated toothpaste so much I wouldn&#39;t brush until teen hormones <br/>
hit then I did for the sake of kissing or the desire to be kissed. <br/>
But I hated the taste of toothpaste wouldn&#39;t leave it lingering in my <br/>
mouth wouldn&#39;t kiss anyone who tasted like it etc.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult being single I went back to not brushing my teeth because <br/>
well I could. But as the WHITE celebrity teeth have become so <br/>
outstanding I started to want a brighter smile and by accident <br/>
stumbed upon Arm and Hammer dental powder. WOW a tooth &#39;soap&#39; I can <br/>
tolerate. Through using it and some bouts with Thrush etc I have <br/>
learned I have a sensitive mouth and typical tooth pastes irritate it <br/>
that&#39;s why I have been avoiding them. <br/>
<br/>
Plus my dentist told me to brush sans any paste or powder is better <br/>
than not brushing so I can brush with just water sans guilt when I am <br/>
without dental powder which is hard to find.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we as humans are just being stubborn and rebelling for no <br/>
reason but many other times there are reasons for the things we are <br/>
rejecting that once uncovered can explain if not explain away why we <br/>
are acting as we are acting.<br/>
<br/>
Take care<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There might be internet sources.<br/>
<br/>
My dad used Pepsodent dental powder, always, never switched to toothpaste.<br/>
When he ran out, he would use salt and baking soda.  I use that sometimes <br/>
myself, just as a change.<br/>
<br/>
Just as using a new shampoo seems WAY different  after the same shampoo <br/>
twenty or thirty times, changing toothpaste seems to feel better to me, so we&#39;ve <br/>
come to keep a basket of various toothpastes and people can switch out and try <br/>
them.  <br/>
