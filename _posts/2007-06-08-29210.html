<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520226920">Funny, what memories I have of the show.  My Mom used to have me help with<br/>
dusting  the living room on Saturday mornings, and my job was always to pick<br/>
up our little color TV so that she could dust the entertainment center under<br/>
the TV.  I never, ever saw any actual dust under the TV, but oh well...that<br/>
was my job, and it wasn&#39;t much, so I didn&#39;t complain.  My Mom was of the<br/>
mindset that she&#39;d rather do all the cleaning, and have me help in very<br/>
minor ways, so she could be assured that &quot;it was done RIGHT&quot;.  Anyway, seems<br/>
like I always held the TV against my chest when the Smurfs were on.  That&#39;s<br/>
a weird memory.<br/>
<br/>
I *never* liked the show, personally, but I wonder if my kids have ever even<br/>
heard of them, or seen them.  Shelby, maybe (she&#39;s 13).  One of the reasons<br/>
I first subscribed (years ago) to the Cartoon Network was so I could<br/>
re-live some of those really great cartoons with my girls:  Bugs Bunny,<br/>
Droopy the Dog, Huckleberry Hound, Tom and Jerry, Garfield and Friends.<br/>
Alas, it&#39;s really hard to find those on now...maybe I could check<br/>
Netflix.The Gargamel/Smurfette thing triggered a memory, though.  I thought<br/>
it was referenced in a Kevin Smith film (we really like Smith&#39;s films), but<br/>
I googled it and found it here:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;First of all, Papa Smurf didn&#39;t create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was<br/>
sent in as Gargamel&#39;s evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf<br/>
village, but the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed<br/>
her.&quot;<br/>
~from *Donnie Darko*, 2001<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a little more, here (from IMDb), but I didn&#39;t want to get too<br/>
raunchy.  Funny stuff, though. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-272302296">Funny that Smurfs have come up, because I cleaned out the garage just<br/>
the other day and found MY old Smurf set--about a dozen of the figures<br/>
and the little mushroom house. My kids went wild. They&#39;ve only<br/>
discovered Smurfs recently themselves; my husband saw it on the cable<br/>
guide and recorded a bunch of episodes on the DVR. The kids have been<br/>
watching it on Saturday mornings, and hubby and I are there going OH I<br/>
REMEMBER THAT ONE! and stuff. <br/>
<br/>
One episode launched a great discussion about &quot;fairness&quot;--whether<br/>
something the Smurfs did in response to Gargamel was &quot;fair&quot; or not. It<br/>
was a great conversation. My 8yo especially was quite animated over<br/>
the whole thing, almost outraged that the &quot;good&quot; guys (Smurfs) were<br/>
doing something she considered not good, not fair. This led my 12yo to<br/>
all kinds of questions about if the good guys do something bad to<br/>
achieve a good end, is that still &#39;good&#39; or not. Eventually we wound<br/>
up talking about the war, Iraq, all kinds of political stuff--by then<br/>
the 8 and youngers were back to watching the show, but the 12yo is<br/>
very interested in politics and world events, and it became quite a<br/>
deep discussion--all from Smurfs. <br/>
<br/>
And I kid you not--this was before my &#39;return to unschooling mindset&#39;<br/>
epiphany that I wrote about the other day in my &#39;saying yes&#39; post, and<br/>
before I had any thought of rejoining this list--I thought &quot;this is<br/>
one of those moments Sandra Dodd&#39;s always writing about.&quot; LOL!! Maybe<br/>
that&#39;s what sparked the idea (weeks later) to start poking around<br/>
Sandra&#39;s site again, and to come back here. I really don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say being back here is sort of an unsettling experience,<br/>
like jumping into deep water and finding out if you still remember how<br/>
to swim. I have swallowed a lot of water these past few days--am<br/>
seeing more and more small moments, tiny exchanges between me and the<br/>
kids, where I have (had) shifted into a more controlling, even rigid,<br/>
person, and am now trying to unclench. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Charlotte Mason stuff, letting it go, is where I&#39;m having trouble. There is a part of me <br/>
that connects so much to what she has to say, the vision she presents. But I recognize that <br/>
it&#39;s an ideal, and the reality has not been quite so idyllic. Again, not TERRIBLE, not <br/>
miserable kids, but, if I&#39;m honest with myself, not wholly happy either. <br/>
<br/>
I cannot escape the plain truth that when I am doing CM stuff, tension comes into my <br/>
home. The 8yo resists: &quot;I don&#39;t like that book. I hate narrating.&quot; The toddlers start to <br/>
squabble with each other because I&#39;m kind of ignoring them so I can read to the older <br/>
kids. The 12yo sits patiently waiting, suppressing her frustration with the rising noise <br/>
level, the interruptions, her sister squealing because someone&#39;s foot strayed one inch into <br/>
&quot;her&quot; territory. <br/>
<br/>
And I look at it this way and wonder what I&#39;m clinging to? Some imaginary picture? I mean, <br/>
when I write it out like this it sounds stupid. If anyone else described to me a scene like <br/>
the above, I&#39;d say, Well obviously you need to ditch that. And if the person said, but that&#39;s <br/>
just a bad day--there are lots and lots of good days, great days even, I&#39;d be thinking, But <br/>
the bad days are what the kids will remember.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if I approach it from the viewpoint of saying YES as often as possible--well, right <br/>
away it&#39;s clear that even in our best times, CM stuff involves a lot of me saying &quot;no, not <br/>
now,&quot; etc. Saying no sweetly & cheerfully is still saying no. It&#39;s still saying, what YOU want <br/>
is not as important as what *I* want. :::sigh:::<br/>
<br/>
I get it, I really do. The thing I don&#39;t get is why there&#39;s ANY part of me that&#39;s reluctant to let <br/>
it go. Hmm...deschooling was easy the first time (ten years ago), because I was coming <br/>
from a background of my own frustrating public school experience. This time, deschooling <br/>
from this idealized CM vision, it&#39;s way harder. <br/>

Deschooling, if it had taken, should have kept you from falling for  <br/>

You already know that this CM program is interfering with the joy in your <br/>
family. Since it is you who is enjoying the vision, you can still do the <br/>
reading alone. Maybe treat her program as nothing more than a recommended <br/>
book list for yourself. Perhaps join an online book discussion club for the <br/>
classics - Barnes and Noble have moderated online book discussion forums <br/>
that may fill your need to have discussions about great books, that will <br/>
free your kids from having to fulfil that function for you. I wonder if you <br/>
have the niggling notion that it is self-indulgent to use some time to enjoy <br/>
reading material that interests you alone (or just you and your dd if that <br/>
is how it transpires). Really it doesn&#39;t need the veneer of being for the <br/>
kids to be allowable for you, presuming that you aren&#39;t ignoring requests <br/>
for attention or help.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right, it didn&#39;t take. Maybe I looked at homeschooling catalogs too soon. Those <br/>
things are like crack. ;) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a few quotes on your site, Sandra, where people describe totally *getting* <br/>
unschooling as an experience similar to a religious conversion. Not that it&#39;s a religion, but <br/>
it&#39;s such a total paradigm shift & lifestyle change that the experience is something akin to <br/>
embracing a religuous faith.<br/>
<br/>
Which makes me think of the parable about the seed falling on rocky soil, thorny soil, etc. <br/>
There are seeds that fall but don&#39;t take root, seeds that get choked by thorns (my <br/>
homeschooling catalogs??)...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, like the people in that parable who are full of zeal at first but fall away later on.<br/>
<br/>
But then, I never did cross the bridge all the way. My take was: I&#39;m all for unschooling, but <br/>
you&#39;ve got to make them do their chores. You&#39;ve got to make them write thank-you notes <br/>
when appropriate. Etc etc etc---the et ceteras multiply until one day you realize they&#39;ve <br/>
moved right into school-at-home territory.<br/>
<br/>
So I have to say, now I&#39;m reading these posts & quotes from a new perspective. <br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying the bejeebers out of my ever-growing YES list. My husband is all, &quot;My aren&#39;t <br/>
you a chipper bunch these days.&quot; It is FUN being a yes mom. I was not having fun before. <br/>

Wow!  Big Wow!  Thank you so much for posting  that.  For years, I viewed <br/>
childhood as exactly that: a rehearsal for  adulthood.  (my poor son can attest t<br/>
o that.)  Although I&#39;ve moved far  beyond that point now, I never actually <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605132838">Hi, Sara<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought from somebody who had to google Charlotte Mason to <br/>
find out who she was.<br/>
<br/>
As I read something about her at Wikipedia, I had flashbacks to the <br/>
days of the British Empire and colonial types forcing &#39;civilisation&#39; <br/>
onto primitive dark skinned people. Maybe that&#39;s just me.<br/>
<br/>
But, since she lived 1842-1923 in any event, I&#39;d say her ideas about <br/>
how to educate children relate to a world that no longer exists.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt she had some positive attitudes toward children and their <br/>
development, but, personally, the rest of it makes me cringe to think <br/>
that this little red schoolhouse approach is apparently being touted <br/>
as a basis for a useful 21st century education. <br/>

&gt; kids. The 12yo sits patiently waiting, suppressing her frustration <br/>
with the rising noise <br/>
&gt; level, the interruptions, her sister squealing because someone&#39;s <br/>
foot strayed one inch into <br/>
&gt; &quot;her&quot; territory. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I look at it this way and wonder what I&#39;m clinging to? Some <br/>
imaginary picture? I mean, <br/>
&gt; when I write it out like this it sounds stupid. If anyone else <br/>
described to me a scene like <br/>
&gt; the above, I&#39;d say, Well obviously you need to ditch that. And if <br/>
the person said, but that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; just a bad day--there are lots and lots of good days, great days <br/>
even, I&#39;d be thinking, But <br/>
&gt; the bad days are what the kids will remember.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, if I approach it from the viewpoint of saying YES as often <br/>
as possible--well, right <br/>
&gt; away it&#39;s clear that even in our best times, CM stuff involves a <br/>
lot of me saying &quot;no, not <br/>
&gt; now,&quot; etc. Saying no sweetly & cheerfully is still saying no. It&#39;s <br/>
still saying, what YOU want <br/>
&gt; is not as important as what *I* want. :::sigh:::<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I get it, I really do. The thing I don&#39;t get is why there&#39;s ANY <br/>
part of me that&#39;s reluctant to let <br/>
&gt; it go. Hmm...deschooling was easy the first time (ten years ago), <br/>
because I was coming <br/>
&gt; from a background of my own frustrating public school experience. <br/>
This time, deschooling <br/>
&gt; from this idealized CM vision, it&#39;s way harder. <br/>

<br/>
My wife and I had a lesson plan for our son when he quit school that <br/>
he&#39;d agreed to as a prerequisite for being home educated. But, <br/>
in retrospect, I can see that it was really for our benefit and to <br/>
keep the school happy, so we could all be comfortable that we were <br/>
doing &#39;the right thing&#39; as far as the Department of Education was <br/>
concerned (the Department of Schools as I call it these days).<br/>
<br/>
The lesson plan lasted all of two weeks before we dumped it. <br/>
<br/>
At the time, we were far from convinced that we&#39;d done the right <br/>
thing. We&#39;d acted simply because we wanted our son to be happy and he <br/>
wasn&#39;t happy with anything that reminded him of the school classroom, <br/>
no matter how informal we made the lessons. Interestingly, it was <br/>
what then happened with our son&#39;s reading that ultimately persuaded <br/>
us we&#39;d made the right decision.<br/>
<br/>
In his second and final year at school (Year 1), Pat had been in the <br/>
remedial reading class. They didn&#39;t call it that, but that&#39;s <br/>
essentially what it was. I was a parent helper in the school&#39;s <br/>
reading program both years my son was there, so I knew first hand how <br/>
exciting the reading classes were. Mostly you got to read inane <br/>
little stories about things that were of no interest to you. <br/>
Especially if you were a boy. And you got to read them over and over <br/>
again. One of the things my son was required to do was bring a book <br/>
home every school day and he was supposed to read this to me and I <br/>
would make notes on his reading performance in a file that would then <br/>
go back to his teacher with the book the next school day. It took <br/>
only a few weeks to get through the school&#39;s entire stock of books at <br/>
that particular reading level and he could read them all just fine. <br/>
In fact, he could have read them backwards and upside down. But he <br/>
wasn&#39;t moved up to a higher level or even taken out of the remedial <br/>
reading program. He was still bringing home the same books over and <br/>
over. So I&#39;d just sign the form with some useful comment or other and <br/>
tell him to do something more useful with his valuable time.<br/>
<br/>
After Pat quit school, he refused to read a book. He hates them. <br/>
Thank you school for teaching my son to hate reading books. My son <br/>
has never read a book since school and that was five years ago. He&#39;s <br/>
had not even one minute of a reading lesson since school. Yet his <br/>
reading is excellent. He developed his reading skills from reading <br/>
videogame manuals and web pages of cheats and walkthroughs and from <br/>
videogames themselves, some of which have an enormous amount of text <br/>
in the gameplay that you need to be able to read to play at all. <br/>
<br/>
Pat&#39;s motivation for developing his reading skills came not from <br/>
being told it was something he needed but from his own understanding <br/>
of how it would help him get what he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no more powerful form of motivation, probably.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682122999">Cool. He was seven.<br/>
<br/>
We played a lot together in the first couple of years. Old games on <br/>
the Nintendo 64 (he started on that when he was three); mostly Super <br/>
Smash Bros and WWE Day of Reckoning on the Game Cube; dozens of dinky <br/>
little games we turned up on the internet. We also played Pokemon and <br/>
other card games together - Yugioh was very big for ages. Then <br/>
Runescape was his big passion on the PC for a long time. And Empire <br/>
Earth. I did play those a bit myself, but they&#39;re not really my kind <br/>
of game. I&#39;m definitely &#39;old school&#39;. Pat prefers the complex games <br/>
that require more sophisticated thinking and tactical skills. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s left me completely behind since he got his Xbox 360 for <br/>
Christmas and plays online mostly these days (which has added new <br/>
interpersonal skills). The game we play most together at the moment <br/>
is Tony Hawk&#39;s Project 8, which is totally awesome.  <br/>
