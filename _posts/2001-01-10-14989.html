<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410862146">-=-I see it to some extent currently with my son (only 2<br/>
years). When ever we go anywhere with a piano he is<br/>
drawn to it. So do we bite the bullet and figure out<br/>
how to get one?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Get an electronic keyboard, with all kinds of other-instruments&#39; voices.  <br/>
They can be very inexpensive, and you can get a full-sized keyboard or a <br/>
smaller one.  If you get a small one the kids can still experiment with tunes <br/>
and learn lots about basics from experimentation.  If you get a full-sized <br/>
four octave or five octave (rarer), you yourself can play lots of &quot;real&quot; <br/>
piano music (I sometimes go off the top end with Bach, and I don&#39;t really <br/>
like 19th and early 20th century stuff, so that big range isn&#39;t a problem for <br/>
me personally).<br/>
<br/>
You can act with your kids, playing around--doing impressions.  For a child <br/>
conscious of &quot;making faces,&quot; maybe get for her, or point out, videos with <br/>
people doing facial stuff.  Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson).  Carol Burnett.  Lily <br/>
Tomlin.  Steve Martin.  The Marx Brothers.  Jim Carrey.  Dana Carvey.  <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to pay for acting lessons or buy a horribly expensive real <br/>
piano to see whether a child wants to pursue something.  You can expose them <br/>
to more examples and you can provide them with materials/ideas/experiences <br/>
very inexpensively at home.  If they get to the point that they MUST do and <br/>
have more, they&#39;ll definitely let you know.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my opinion, really, truly.  Some kids grow up and say they were <br/>
glad to have been pushed to do something against their will.  Others grow up <br/>
vowing never to TOUCH that violin or tennis racket or those ballet shoes, nor <br/>
anything remotely resembling them, ever again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963607269">I second the suggestion to buy a keyboard for your ds interested in the<br/>
piano. I have one that&#39;s currently on loan to my 7-year-old niece who is<br/>
taking lessons, but we also have an upright piano here at home that we<br/>
bought for $80. I love having the full size piano for my own enjoyment, but<br/>
I know at this point my daughter would have just as much fun banging away on<br/>
a little keyboard with tons of other gizmos.<br/>
