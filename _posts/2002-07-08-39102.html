            You know, Tia, I have been reading this tag line of yours for a while now, but it just struck me again how truly appropriate it is -- that and your other one, &quot;What you think of me is none of my business&quot;!   Debi<br/>

actually the title of a book.  I can&#39;t remember if I ever finished the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970623348">well, it is a simple statement.. but one that is SO important.. too bad it took me about fifty years to figure it out.. i remember as a self concious teen realizing that what other&#39;s thought did not really affect me.. .. but it took another forty years for that to really sink in.. <br/>
<br/>
That will be one of my new mottos..-- What you think of me is none of my business!! <br/>
in fact think i&#39;ll put it on a tshirt.. it is a surprising way to put such a basic truth.. <br/>
