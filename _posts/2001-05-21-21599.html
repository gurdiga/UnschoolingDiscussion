here who have never steered me wrong,<br/>
and let it sit next to the TV for a while. :) I haven&#39;t seen it in the video<br/>
store yet.<br/>

We rented and watched Island of the Blue Dolphins last week, also, which<br/>
proved to fit extraordinarily well with The Education of Little Tree movie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994236202">Chiinaberry Book Catalog has a good review of the book/movie and the<br/>
controversy surrounding the discovery it was not a completely factual story.<br/>
For me, finding out the speicfic charaters were not factual did not destroy<br/>
the meaning of the story.   That could be because I live in that part of<br/>
Alabama which is/was Cherokee Country and have a couple of relatives with<br/>
Cherokee heritage.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a reference book, called _Through Indian Eyes_, that compiles<br/>
reviews of books (mostly fiction) with Indian / Native American characters.<br/>
 I found it pretty helpful.  I can&#39;t speak for the credentials of the<br/>
authors, but they are allegedly authentic.  The reviews generally point out<br/>
what&#39;s offensive, or stereotyped and praise what&#39;s detailed or goes beyond<br/>
stereotyping.  (i.e. characters in the book have real and varied<br/>
personalities.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recall if it has a review of Little Tree, though.  At the time I<br/>
didn&#39;t notice.<br/>
