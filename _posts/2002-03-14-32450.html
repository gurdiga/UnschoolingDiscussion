I would do whatever it took to NOT work outside the home, in a regular full<br/>

during that time.<br/>
I would sell Tupperware, Longaberger baskets, pampered chef, Stampin&#39; up! or<br/>
one of the many direct marketing businesses out there. It involves a lot of<br/>

I would even do more than one of the above, kind of like having a couple<br/>

I would look for ANYthing that would keep my children out of the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076222305">I am so sorry to hear of your financial stress.  I<br/>
have had my fair share.  Who am I kidding, I still get<br/>
my share.  I expected to return to work 1 year 1/2<br/>
ago( I had no intention on unschooling).  I put my son<br/>
in school and what a disaster!  He is a real good boy<br/>
who has plenty of creavtivity.  Thank goodness to John<br/>
holt and other alternative educators that I realize<br/>
that the school system was not for our family.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t go back to work which put us in a financial<br/>
bind.  If you have alot of credit cards consolidate<br/>
them before they go delinquent or if they do this<br/>
asap.  You won&#39;t be able to use them anymore, but your<br/>
credit will stay good.  The payments will be extremely<br/>
low which will give you extra money.  If you have to<br/>
apply for financial asistance at the welfare office<br/>
until you can get on your feet. There is heating<br/>
asistance also.  There is no reason your child should<br/>
have to go through the trauma of school.<br/>
I wish you the best of luck <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally, I would choose an alternative school, but that would depend <br/>
upon what your definition of LD is, some alternative schools are not <br/>
equipped to handle very special cases.<br/>
<br/>
There is always off-hour jobs if you have support around to watch him <br/>
while you are gone. I was a waitress for 18 years and worked nights. I <br/>
worked all through high school, put myself through college and supported <br/>
my entry level pay until I worked my way up enough to command a good <br/>
salary. The restaruant/bar business is a great way to work off hours. Or <br/>
even work a breakfast/lunch shift, be home by 3.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe try to find some more daycare kids and reopen?<br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823168356">I just thought I would share what I do so I don&#39;t have to work outside the home... not that these particulars are the same as would be for your particular situation...<br/>
<br/>
I work for two different professors assisting with on-line classes in web design, and the internet. I am not necessarily fabulous with web design, but I am good at organizing grades, writing and grading tests etc. and assisting with student questions.<br/>
<br/>
I also sell Longaberger baskets, where I often happen to have a party at just about the time when I need to pay a bill - like the car insurance or something. I find Longaberger has a better profit margin because the product is expensive and therefore sales are higher in general. <br/>
<br/>
I also am a distributor for Starlight International, which makes all natural, herbal products. My girlfriend found out about them from her nurse practitioner, when her 1 year old was constantly sick, and medical science seemed unable to figure out why. She gave him these children&#39;s antioxidants, which helped his system overall... and he stopped being sick continually. I decided to use some of their overall female wellness products, and my husband was using their weight loss program, as well as my kids taking the children&#39;s antioxident as well, so it became cheaper to become a distributor and buy the items I use at cost. Others have asked about them - and it has just grown from there. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, this seems too long - there are many options out there... as well as working part time or different shifts, I think the key is find out what you are good at - and make it work for you. Can you offer a class in - photography, sculpture - whatever to other homeschoolers? (or schooled kids for that matter) - are you good at crafts? Try making things and selling them on Ebay...  <br/>
<br/>
None of these in themselves may be enough - but a combination may help you out of your spot. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this was helpful!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
