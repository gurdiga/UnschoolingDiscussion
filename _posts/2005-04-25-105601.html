<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139324491">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of thoughts re. follow-ups on the<br/>
follow-ups ;*)<br/>
<br/>
-Mary B.<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, you are welcome to post anything I have posted<br/>
re. CPS, anywhere that you believe it will be of use<br/>
to �unschoolers�/�homeschoolers<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that arriving at the advice I have<br/>
given is a result of : speaking with an attorney that<br/>
specializes in �homeschool� advocacy, approx. 40 hours<br/>
of research focused entirely on dealing with CPS and<br/>
�homeschoolers,� and a completely positive outcome<br/>
that ended with no entry to my home, no interviews<br/>
with my self, my husband or our 4 children and no<br/>
further contacts with CPS.<br/>
<br/>
The anger that Katy is now feeling is part of<br/>
grieving. The emotional turmoil this event causes<br/>
truly is the death of security for an unschooler�. The<br/>
majority of my online unschool time was filled with<br/>
legislative �homeschool boards for 2 years after this<br/>
incident occurred.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about being nice or polite or &quot;appearing&quot;<br/>
innocent. It&#39;s about ending the investigation as<br/>
quickly and completely as possible.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE, take the documents to the worker. DO NOT open<br/>
the door for her, or any other government authority,<br/>
without a search warrant.<br/>
(Which, her having the documents should prevent being<br/>
issued.)<br/>
<br/>
If your home met the standard for &quot;neglect&quot; I would<br/>
assume she would have moved to remove your child at<br/>
the time. However, if she was coming back for a second<br/>
look-see, I would spend my time putting all the<br/>
furniture back in place, sweep, mop, vacuum, whatever<br/>
might be viewed as &quot;messy&quot; on the slight chance that<br/>
she does decide to return with a warrant.<br/>
<br/>
There are parents who have made that invitation and<br/>
had the child removed on the spot. Rare? Yes. But not<br/>
if you are the one it happens to. Then it&#39;s a 100%<br/>
rate of occurrence.<br/>
<br/>
Below are the comments to which I am referring.<br/>
Please do not mistake my additional entreaties as<br/>
pushiness. It&#39;s just that- having experienced this<br/>
situation, I am painfully aware of the sticking<br/>
points. -Those being the ones that will get you Stuck<br/>
in a Great Big Mess.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned before, I too did the &quot;polite&quot; thing.<br/>
Though I denied her entrance into my home, I called<br/>
and set up an appointment for her to come a few days<br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
I did that out of fear and arrogance. She&#39;d threatened<br/>
to burst in with the police- causing Fear. And, I Knew<br/>
that MY home and MY children were far above any CPS<br/>
standard- Arrogance.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you have nothing to hide ... &quot; This is the naive<br/>
posture that keeps most �homeschoolers� feeling safe.<br/>
It&#39;s like the flotation device, aka seat cushion, in<br/>
an airplane. Has anyone Ever been saved by one of<br/>
those things? I seriously doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
Being upright, caring, loving, committed, responsible,<br/>
responsive and willing-to-die for your children will<br/>
NOT prevent CPS from showing up at your door and<br/>
deciding that you are in need of intervention.<br/>
 <br/>
The fact that she showed up has confirmed the first<br/>
half of that scenario. It is your job to eliminate the<br/>
possibility of further consequences.<br/>
 <br/>
CPS is not generic. For all practical purposes, It is<br/>
one individual, with her own beliefs, preconceived<br/>
notions, limited education and 5 inch thick department<br/>
manual, who has the authority to traumatize your<br/>
entire family. The prerogative to use that power may<br/>
be why she took the job. Or maybe not. What is certain<br/>
is that inviting her in like a neighbor foolishly<br/>
ignores the reality of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
KATY,<br/>
Getting over your rudeness from breaking your date<br/>
with her will happen much more easily with your child<br/>
safely at home. Do you really care about disappointing<br/>
this woman&#39;s plans more than preserving the integrity<br/>
of your family?�<br/>
<br/>
She is not coming for tea. She is making a second<br/>
visit to interrogate you, your child, your husband and<br/>
to see if you&#39;ve had Hazel come and make your place<br/>
shiny and clean enough to warrant her approval. <br/>
<br/>
You know that she has not yet judged you &quot;fit&quot;.<br/>
Otherwise, she would not be returning.<br/>
 <br/>
As for the educational issues, the NM law with which<br/>
you are in compliance seems to cover that.<br/>
<br/>
As your follow-up mentions, she was not there to<br/>
investigate educational issues- at all. Don&#39;t offer<br/>
any information in that area. <br/>
<br/>
THIS is why you should have been given a report with<br/>
specific charges denoted. She&#39;s fishing ... which<br/>
makes her an antagonist.<br/>
<br/>
As for her &#39; &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; give me a copy until the<br/>
investigation was complete. &#39; This is b--- s---.<br/>
This is a tactic that is used to keep you in the dark<br/>
and fearful. I would call the state attorney&#39;s office<br/>
and ask them what the legal procedure entails. Does an<br/>
individual being investigated have the right to know<br/>
what the allegations against them are?<br/>
<br/>
Your cop friend knows what &quot;neglect&quot; in a home looks<br/>
like. It&#39;s not your house, or she&#39;d have removed your<br/>
son at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend who suggested complying is giving you the<br/>
&quot;company line&quot;.  It comes from a place of employee<br/>
loyalty. It is not good legal advice.<br/>
<br/>
Stay strong, refute the charges and the result should<br/>
be in your favor.<br/>
<br/>
I will assemble the best �homeschool� legal � sources<br/>
with which I am acquainted and post asap. I don&#39;t know<br/>
of any &quot;Complete&quot; resource. Though, I do know that<br/>
�NHEN� was attempting to create one.<br/>

&gt; Also,  just as you don&#39;t want to invite in<br/>
&gt; authorities<br/>
&gt; without a <br/>
&gt; warrant,  likewise, I would not offer anything<br/>
&gt; beyond<br/>
&gt; that which <br/>
&gt; proves you&#39;re  legal and that your child is healthy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; CPS has no business evaluating  your records. <br/>
&gt; Should<br/>
&gt; they do <br/>
&gt; so and decide that they aren&#39;t  sufficient, then<br/>
&gt; another Pandora&#39;s <br/>
&gt; box could be opened.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ===========<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s all true.<br/>
&gt; It maybe be that if she agreed for them to come<br/>
&gt; back, they&#39;re coming back,  <br/>
&gt; though.<br/>
&gt; Depends on the state, the county, whether she signed<br/>
&gt; something maybe.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I would DEFINITELY ask for the records in advance. <br/>
&gt; There might be  something <br/>
&gt; in there that lets you know who reported it, and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s possible that  would <br/>
&gt; help.  If it&#39;s an ex-anything (boyfriend, in law,<br/>
&gt; husband, best  friend) it <br/>
&gt; could be harrassment, and all KINDS of government<br/>
&gt; workers are  familiar with being <br/>
&gt; used as pawns in other people&#39;s personal vendettas,<br/>
&gt; and they  don&#39;t like it <br/>
&gt; any.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s a neighbor just being irritated that kids<br/>
&gt; are there in the daytime,  <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s a different kind of complaint again.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; The family I know best who got visits didn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; them for  homeschooling.  <br/>
&gt; They had adopted three kids and so they were already<br/>
&gt; a case  file with agencies. <br/>
&gt;  Homeschooling was just one more thing for them to<br/>
&gt; ask  about.<br/>

&gt; I have always been told that if they show up at my<br/>
&gt; door to not let <br/>
&gt; them in.  I do not have to invite them in my home. <br/>
&gt; HSLDA will have <br/>
&gt; some good advice for you but I think you have to be<br/>
&gt; a member?  I would <br/>
&gt; be careful at this point because you did o.k. a home<br/>
&gt; visit and if you <br/>
&gt; now say they aren&#39;t allowed they will think you have<br/>
&gt; something to <br/>
&gt; hide.  It&#39;s a nervous thing to think about and I<br/>
&gt; hope all turns out <br/>
&gt; well for you!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The officer interviewed me and Richard, and will<br/>
&gt; be back next week <br/>
&gt; to tour my house.  I am a little worried, because I<br/>
&gt; tend to freeze up <br/>
&gt; when confronted, I am not very good with words.  I<br/>
&gt; think I explained <br/>
&gt; what we do pretty well though. <br/>

&gt; Subject: [Unschooling Discussion] re: CPS<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wrote most of this last night, and then<br/>
&gt; accidentally sent it to a list member instead of the<br/>
&gt; list!  Sorry Mary Ellen, and thanks for letting me<br/>
&gt; know.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for all of your responses.  I am a little<br/>
&gt; calmer now, though still scared and confused,<br/>
&gt; wondering who would do this.  Actually this morning<br/>
&gt; those feelings are fading and I am getting more and<br/>
&gt; more angry...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am in New Mexico.  <br/>
&gt; In NM we have to submit a form by April 1 every year<br/>
&gt; notifying the state that we are homeschooling,<br/>
&gt; maintain immunization records, maintain records that<br/>
&gt; you have a diploma or GED,  and it is SUGGESTED that<br/>
&gt; you keep a &quot;school&quot; calendar.  <br/>
&gt; I  have done all of these things, I am fully legal,<br/>
&gt; though the calendar is really just my little day<br/>
&gt; planner, it does have all of our trips and stuff.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I wrote before, the report stated that Richard<br/>
&gt; has never been to school and that I am not<br/>
&gt; registered (I am), but it also stated that we live<br/>
&gt; in &quot;filthy&quot; conditions with &quot;clutter and clothes&quot;<br/>
&gt; all over the place that you can hardly walk around. <br/>
&gt; It said that my house stunk and that it was a fire<br/>
&gt; hazard because of all the clutter.  This is<br/>
&gt; considered personal neglect, which is why CPS is<br/>
&gt; involved, and not dept of Education, though they<br/>
&gt; certainly had a lot of questions about our<br/>
&gt; homeschooling!<br/>
&gt; My house is cluttered, but certainly not a fire<br/>
&gt; hazard!  I am in the slow process of painting the<br/>
&gt; bedrooms, so most of the stuff from my bedroom is in<br/>
&gt; the front room.  At the moment we don&#39;t go in there<br/>
&gt; (the front room) at all, as there are two living<br/>
&gt; areas.  The process is so slow because I work full<br/>
&gt; time and I spend as much of my time off with<br/>
&gt; Richard, not on house-related stuff.  So yes, I<br/>
&gt; admit it is messy.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know someone in another branch of the Children<br/>
&gt; Youth and Families Department who gave me the<br/>
&gt; impression that it was better to comply with letting<br/>
&gt; the officer into my home, now I question that<br/>
&gt; decision.  :~(  Her thought was that I had nothing<br/>
&gt; to hide, so don&#39;t act like it.  I have gotten all of<br/>
&gt; my paperwork together, and am going to put together<br/>
&gt; a &quot;curriculum&quot; (thanks for the link Sandra).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When she first showed up, I had just gotten done<br/>
&gt; with 3 night shifts.  I don&#39;t usually work nights,<br/>
&gt; but I was covering for someone who was on vacation. <br/>
&gt;  So when the officer showed up I was sleeping.  She<br/>
&gt; looked around and informed me of the complaint, and<br/>
&gt; said that she would come back for her formal visit. <br/>
&gt; I immediately went to the childcare and while I was<br/>
&gt; there she showed up to talk to Richard, so she<br/>
&gt; talked to him with me there.  I was told that in<br/>
&gt; cases where child safety is concerned they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to allow the parent to sit in the interview<br/>
&gt; with the child.   She was surprised that the police<br/>
&gt; had not already contacted me, she said that in cases<br/>
&gt; of suspected child neglect the police will come and<br/>
&gt; inspect the property.  I have a friend who is a cop<br/>
&gt; who happened to come by tonight, so I asked him<br/>
&gt; about it.  He said yeah, your house is messy but it<br/>
&gt; is not what they are looking for when they suspect<br/>
&gt; neglect.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My thinking now is that as Roslynn and Sandra<br/>
&gt; mentioned I did pretty much say it was ok for her to<br/>
&gt; come back, so if I were to not let her in now it<br/>
&gt; would look bad.   I did ask for a copy of the<br/>
&gt; report, and was told that she &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; give me a<br/>
&gt; copy until the investigation was complete.  She said<br/>
&gt; that the report was anonymous, and when I looked<br/>
&gt; over her shoulder there was no name where the<br/>
&gt; reporter would go, but I guess that really doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mean anything.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You know, before this happened to me, when I would<br/>
&gt; read about things like this happening to other<br/>
&gt; people I would think, well, there must be something<br/>
&gt; else going on.  There must be some &quot;real&quot; reason for<br/>
&gt; them to be investigated.  I am appalled at my<br/>
&gt; thinking now.  <br/>
&gt; Thanks for all of your support and responses,<br/>
&gt; Katy<br/>

&gt; I was wondering if it would be okay for me to<br/>
&gt; forward your email to my local<br/>
&gt; homeschooling group? It was full of great advice.<br/>
&gt; One of our members also<br/>
&gt; recently had a run in with DCF here in FL. She too<br/>
&gt; let them in out of fear.<br/>
&gt; I have also always heard to never let anyone in you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I would like to send your email on so that<br/>
&gt; those who think it could<br/>
&gt; never happen to them can at least be aware of what<br/>
&gt; to do if.<br/>
