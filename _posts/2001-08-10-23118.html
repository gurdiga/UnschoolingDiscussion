<div id="ygrps-yiv-216033258">circumcision was never an option for us. i did do the research, i think <br/>
mainly to tell other people with complete confidence why we weren&#39;t going to <br/>
cut the tip of our son&#39;s penis off. <br/>
<br/>
on the vaccination issue, i&#39;d like to say that most people i know who don&#39;t <br/>
get these shots don&#39;t just not get vaccinations and hope they never get <br/>
diseases. they&#39;re generally educated about health, natural foods, exercise, <br/>
etc. and some use homeopathic routes, some parents use daily swedish massage <br/>
as a natural immune booster.<br/>
<br/>
and yes, this all began as a subject of choice. most people don&#39;t know they <br/>
even have one. <br/>
