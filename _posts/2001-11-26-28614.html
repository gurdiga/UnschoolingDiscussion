<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694076378">we have a Neti pot and I&#39;ve used it with some success. You warm up water into whicn you&#39;ve added a pinch of kosher or canning salt and perhaps a pinch of baking soda--we also add a drop or grapefruit seed extract. Then--this is the hard part--you tip your head into the sink and slowly pour the water into one nostril--if you do it right, the water will come out the other nostril. you&#39;ve irrigated your sinuses and rinsed out pollen and other irritants.  I must say, though, that using the neti pot took practice. My kids loved to watch me so they could chuckle.<br/>
