opinions and thinking about them.  Those tons of responses were mostly<br/>
telling him to go take his agenda elsewhere, where there would be a positive<br/>
reception.  His posts felt like spam to me.  So Yol, would you be happy if<br/>
the list were also opened to spammers?<br/>
We have lots of religious discussions, but as far as I know, people aren&#39;t<br/>
allowed to come on here and start trying to convert others to their<br/>
religion.  That&#39;s what a lot of Ned&#39;s posts sounded like to me.  Should we<br/>
open the list to religious proselytizing?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-729246329">**The quality was different. Ned appeared to neither<br/>
respond to the opposing ideas nor to the objections to his ideas. He<br/>
attacked people personally and basically just repeated what he&#39;d said before<br/>
as though others just weren&#39;t listening to him.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is my perception as well.<br/>
<br/>
If Ned came back to this list, I would just auto-delete him.  Which I&#39;m<br/>
sure is preferable to me getting really pissed and screaming at him.<br/>
<br/>
If he didn&#39;t repeat himself so much, I would actually take the time to<br/>
read his posts.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t even know this Ned person or what he had to say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And to make any meaningful judgements on a particular incident it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; imperative that someone have been there and been trying to use the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other people&#39;s perception of that period will be entirely different than<br/>
&gt; Foxglove&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, my perception of that period was different than Foxglove&#39;s.<br/>
I don&#39;t post much at all, but I read everything that comes through here.<br/>
When Ned first joined the list, his posts were so inspiring and I truly<br/>
respected his sage wisdom and advice about unschooling. His words come<br/>
through loud and clear with much confidence, especially since he has a<br/>
successful and grown son who has been unschooled all his life. I looked<br/>
forward to reading things he had to say about various subjects that came up.<br/>
<br/>
However, after a while, Ned&#39;s posts were all about how school and moreso,<br/>
the government, are so evil and out to get us. People responded<br/>
point-by-point to his posts, but he rarely addressed the questions asked of<br/>
him and continued with more anti-government talk. I didn&#39;t know what I was<br/>
supposed to do with the information he was trying to get across to people on<br/>
the list. How was it helping me unschool my kids? And how was it  helping me<br/>
feel good about anything? It came to the point that reading his posts were<br/>
actually depressing me and the sheer volume of responses to his posts were<br/>
extremely overwhelming. He was also criticizing people who asked him to tone<br/>
down - I basically lost a lot of respect I had gained in him previously.<br/>
<br/>
Although it was very sad, in a way, when it came to the point that he had to<br/>
be silenced, in another way it was a huge relief.<br/>
<br/>
I saw him and Luz speak in SC and I did regain my respect for him. He is a<br/>
wonderful speaker and seems like a knowledgable source for anything<br/>
unschooling. I often give out his website to friends or family members who<br/>
want to learn more about unschooling (and Sandra&#39;s, too!) because it&#39;s<br/>
written with such confidence and understanding about unschooling, and seems<br/>
to be geared towards beginner unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; From my point of view as moderator whose task it is to keep the list<br/>
 </span></blockquote>useful<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for unschooling discussion, it had ceased to be useful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree completely.<br/>
Joyce, you do such a wonderful job of moderating.<br/>
I am in awe of your patient and tactful skills.<br/>
And your unschooling posts are gems, too.<br/>
Thank-you for being here. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stop talking about Ned now and go back to lurking - it&#39;s how I learn<br/>
best!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432818285">**Would he just keep posting to &quot;deaf ears&quot;?  Hmmm, well, <br/>
he might.. lol.. but if he was blocked, how would you know?**<br/>
<br/>
Um... in my case I did eventually figure out how to block him, but<br/>
people replying to him would quote his most incendiary paragraphs and I<br/>
would think &quot;Holy, Hannah!  I can&#39;t BELIEVE he said that, and get all<br/>
fired up again.&quot;<br/>

proselytizing related to their unschooling, then you should allow that too. I <br/>
would simply exercise my delete key option more frequently---or perhaps I&#39;d <br/>
read their posts when the mood strikes me. Who knows? I might learn something <br/>
new!<br/>

Sandra who closed any doors.  It was the owner of this list, after trying<br/>
many other ways to solve the problem without success.  I would do the same<br/>
