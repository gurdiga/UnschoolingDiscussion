Rodents&#39; teeth grow continually, and if they&#39;re lucky, they have lots of<br/>
roughage to eat and normal teeth and they wear naturally and you don&#39;t have<br/>
to trim them. If they&#39;re not, and they have a slight overbite or crossbite<br/>
or their teeth don&#39;t wear normally, then their teeth grow long and must be<br/>
trimmed. It&#39;s a major hassle!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674245282">I&#39;m back from the dinner!  It drives me nuts that I get nervous over<br/>
making a silly 3 minute award presentation speech, but it went well<br/>
anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks Karen for giving a better explanation of guinea pig teeth than I<br/>
could have.  I wonder what Shyrley&#39;s secret is.  After many successful<br/>
years with many species of animals, we weren&#39;t terribly successful with<br/>
guinea pigs.<br/>
 <br/>
In regard to rats, we had hooded rats - white with black, brown or gray<br/>
&quot;hoods&quot; around their heads and a stripe going down their back to their<br/>
tail.  Lest people think I&#39;m completely nuts, there&#39;s a reason we had 33<br/>
rats at once.  We got two with the intention of having a litter.  Very<br/>
quickly we had a litter of nine.  We kept all of them because everybody<br/>
seemed grossed out by the idea of pet rats, so we couldn&#39;t find homes<br/>
for them and I wasn&#39;t comfortable with the idea of having a pet shop<br/>
sell them.  We separated the two original rats so we wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
another litter, but they managed to get together through the wire of the<br/>
cages when she was loose!  3 weeks later we had a litter of 14!  We<br/>
decided to take those to a really reputable pet shop for homes, but just<br/>
before they were weaned and ready to go, we discovered that we&#39;d left<br/>
the first litter together a bit too long (they can conceive really<br/>
young!), and we had another litter of 8!  We only had the 33 for about a<br/>
week, after which the litter of 14 was ready to go to the pet store.  We<br/>
kept one from each of those 2 litters, so we ultimately ended up with<br/>
13.  <br/>
Rats come in over 30 colors, including Dalmatian (yeah!), and I&#39;d like<br/>
to eventually get some of the more exotic colors, but they&#39;re hard to<br/>
get around here.  Most of the really interesting ones are bred in CA,<br/>
but it&#39;s very expensive to have them shipped.  The rat people sometimes<br/>
smuggle them by going through airport security with the rats in a zipped<br/>
jacket pocket, then transferring them to a container in the airplane<br/>
bathroom and put them in a carry on bag for the ride.<br/>
 <br/>
Good Dalmatians?  It&#39;s all about finding a really reputable breeder that<br/>
breeds for show purposes and makes a high priority of health and<br/>
temperament, testing all puppies for congenital deafness, euthanizing<br/>
the deaf puppies and neutering the unilateral hearing puppies.  All<br/>
three of our Dalmatians have really nice temperaments, though the breed<br/>
really does belong in families who like their personality traits -<br/>
silly, bouncy, demanding, kissy high energy, and very allergic to<br/>
sleeping on hard surfaces!  Interestingly enough, after the second<br/>
movie, the Dalmatian clubs did such a good job of educating people about<br/>
the breed that it plummeted in AKC registrations.  It was good that<br/>
people didn&#39;t rush out to get them, but the rapid drop in popularity was<br/>
really hard on reputable breeders and show people.<br/>
 <br/>
Out homeschool theatre group is called YPT (Young People&#39;s Theatre) and<br/>
was started several years ago by 2 moms.  One moved to Arkansas, and<br/>
still runs a branch there.  The other director has rehearsals at a<br/>
church in Lakeridge, VA, and we hold our performances at Lazy Susan<br/>
Dinner Theatre.  We do 2 performances a year, and sometimes a summer<br/>
show.  This is our 3rd season with the group.  We&#39;ve done The Little<br/>
Prince, Little Women of Orchard House, and now Fiddler, Jr.  Next season<br/>
we&#39;ll be doing Annie.  The quality is truly amazing.  Our director<br/>
attends to every little detail and the shows are incredibly<br/>
professional!  We&#39;re quite addicted!<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, my next species is going to be a parrot, much to my husband&#39;s<br/>
consternation.   Anyone have parrot experience?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226000165">Guinea Pigs worked really well for my family when the younger two kids were <br/>
little. They were bigger and could handle the little guy, 2 at the time, who <br/>
sometimes squeezed a bit.. They squeaked to let him know, loosen up your <br/>
grip. I was afraid mice would not make it and rat babies too. I agree that <br/>
piggies are a special friend and we truly enjoyed them in our life. We are <br/>
ready to try rats soon. Just lost a pet chicken to a clever racoon. I hope <br/>
the repairs on the coop keep the racoon away from our remaining hen. I have <br/>
enjoyed all the personal stories regarding pets lately. Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200263054">The &#39;coons (down here, anyway) are often big, and<br/>
mean, too. Need dogs to watch out for things.  Several<br/>
dogs, and one, at least needs to be big. &#39;coons also<br/>
are a reservour for rabies. If there is a marauding<br/>
one, it may not be healthy. Make sure the dogs are<br/>
vaccinated and be ready to provide back-up for them.<br/>
It is not unusual for a &#39;coon to hurt a dog. <br/>
<br/>
On the Florida Gulf Coast &#39;possums were a problem. <br/>
They latch onto whatever part they bump into first and<br/>
start gnawing. Chew chew chew, won&#39;t let go just<br/>
burrow in. Nasty. The chicken doesn&#39;t die right away,<br/>
just screams, unless the &#39;possum starts on the neck.<br/>
He slips in at night, and starts on a sleeping bird.<br/>
Shotgun is the only cure we found. Some people eat<br/>
&#39;possum.....???????  <br/>
<br/>
We put wire over the chicken pen, here and haven&#39;t had<br/>
any problems, except egg eating snakes, occasionally.<br/>
Silly things go through the chicken wire, eat a bunch<br/>
of eggs and can&#39;t get back out!! &#39;Til the eggs digest<br/>
some. I catch them in 5 gallon buckets (they are easy<br/>
to trick) and DH takes them away from the house.  <br/>
<br/>
What kind of rooster do you have Tia? The most<br/>
ferocious one I ever had was a barred-rock. XDH (the<br/>
karate instructor) broke his toe trying to kick the<br/>
rooster!! Oooo that was one bad bird!! Nobody went in<br/>
his territory! <br/>

it.  I whack him across the chest with it when he starts looking like he&#39;s <br/>
