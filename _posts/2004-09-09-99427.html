<br/>
&lt;&lt; Letting go of &quot;expectations&quot; helps, I think. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree deeply.<br/>
<br/>
But I need to apologize to Julie about one thing.   I was pissed off before <br/>
she was, and posted without thinking long enough.   <br/>
<br/>
My Granny used to say sometimes &quot;I expect so.&quot;  She usually said &quot;reckon so,&quot; <br/>
which is still in common mainstream use in England, but not the U.S.   If <br/>
someone asked if Papaw would be home before dinner, she might say &quot;I expect he <br/>
will be&quot; (emphasis on &quot;will&quot;) or &quot;I expect so.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Still, if she had said &quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to bring me a present,&quot; I would <br/>
take it as sweet.  If she had said, &quot;I expect you to mop that floor,&quot; it <br/>
would&#39;ve been the same as &quot;I&#39;m going to go do something else, and when I get back <br/>
that floor had better be mopped.&quot;  There was an entire use of the word that <br/>
wasn&#39;t very negotiable.   expect ya&#39;ll to clean them fish for dinner.&quot;   The fish <br/>
would probably have<br/>
Z been cleaned by the person who was addressed.<br/>
<br/>
The in between of those is someone saying to other moms without saying to her <br/>
kids &quot;I expect my kids to...&quot;   In that case it&#39;s ambiguous enough that <br/>
different readers will see it as &quot;reasonably hope&quot; and others might have &quot;or else&quot; <br/>
memories stirred.<br/>
<br/>
But even without specific  memories, even in the most neutral of cases, to <br/>
expect something leads to either &quot;I told you so&quot; or a failure.   Compliance (or <br/>
expectation meeting) is the mom getting her way.   The kid gets his way by NOT <br/>
complying.<br/>
<br/>
If this is too subtle a point to be worth pursuing, I&#39;m willing to let it go <br/>
on by.   If it gets discussed any more after early Friday morning, I&#39;ll be <br/>
gone five days anyway, and miss it.<br/>
<br/>
Julie, I&#39;m sorry I was so cranky about it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that I&#39;ve annoyed people sometimes for tending to pursuit <br/>
subtle points.<br/>
But while things like the meaning of &quot;expect&quot; seem like little, nit-<br/>
picky things, I&#39;ve found that for me, examining the little things <br/>
can actually have profound effects.<br/>
It&#39;s like a tiny pebble making bigger and bigger ripples.<br/>
(Or something.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another pet peeve of mine- someone disguising their needs as <br/>
someone else&#39;s.<br/>
It was done to me as a child and is *still* sometimes done to me by <br/>
my mother even as an adult.  (&quot;You need to call your brother.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something I&#39;ve had to work on- for example rather than saying <br/>
to my boisterous older boys &quot;you need to be quiet now&quot; I&#39;ll try to <br/>
remember to say &quot;*I* need some quiet now&quot; or even &quot;your brother&#39;s <br/>
sleeping, could you please keep it down?&quot;<br/>
That &quot;you need&quot; thing... YUCK.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

week, in Peabody).    Schools think their needs are your needs.  They&#39;ll say &quot;You <br/>
 need to be in here on time,&quot; and &quot;You need to finish your paper by Friday.&quot;  <br/>
There&#39;s an implied &quot;or else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, I will remind my husband to call his mom.  &quot;You need <br/>
to send that card by Tuesday&quot; [or else it will be there late].  It seems, <br/>
between us, to be less irritating than &quot;Did you send the card yet?&quot;   Personal <br/>
situation.   He knows that I know what he needs to do as regards his mom, but <br/>
asking over and over seems naggish.<br/>

annoying, and it&#39;s when it&#39;s genuine and informational rather than a <br/>

<br/>
My husband was helping me learn to surf this summer (my husband and <br/>
sons surf and I figured joining them would be more fun than always <br/>
being the spectator) and he&#39;d say things like &quot;you need to catch the <br/>
wave first before you try to stand up.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s a subtle difference, sort of like the expectations thing.<br/>

<br/>
I will remind kids to eat, and if they&#39;re planning to leave the house without <br/>
me on some exciting outing, I might say &quot;You need to eat before you go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean I want them to eat to make me feel better.  It means they  <br/>
might not have realized how long they&#39;ll be gone and that they&#39;re going away <br/>
from food, not toward it.<br/>
<br/>
Or I might say &quot;grab some food&quot; or I might put some food in a bag for all of <br/>
whoever&#39;s going to share on the way.<br/>

Ohhhhhh boy.  I just realized I use this with my kids way too often.  I<br/>
never ever thought about it in the context you described.<br/>
<br/>
I learned it, amusingly enough, when I was in college, majoring in<br/>
elementary education, volunteering with children at a low income housing<br/>
after-school project.  The teachers in charge of the program trained all of<br/>
us (helpers) to say &quot;You need to&quot; at the beginning of every request made to<br/>
the children.  They told us by making whatever we wanted into a need for the<br/>
child, we were more likely to get compliance from them.  When I read your<br/>
email I had a lightbulb moment.  I don&#39;t want my kids to automatically<br/>
comply with anyone, so why do I use this phrase with them?  Habit I guess.<br/>
A bad one that needs to be broken.<br/>
<br/>
Urgh.  You&#39;ve just given me a LOT to think about.  Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747044816">I&#39;ve found myself starting sentences with &quot;I need you to...&quot; and <br/>
then I&#39;ll stop and think, &quot;Do I?  Really?&quot;  Maybe it&#39;s more of an &quot;I <br/>
would really like it if you...&quot;?  I do try to distinguish exactly <br/>
who has the need/want, but then I get all caught up with trying to <br/>
determine whose need is most important, and why, and how to meet <br/>
everyones need while still respecting boundaries...sigh...and then I <br/>
just feel stupid and trapped by my own psychosis;)  My children are <br/>
very young (5, 2, and 15 months) and so I struggle with guiding <br/>
them, modeling behavior for them and then outright telling them WHAT <br/>
IS BEST (ha).  &quot;I need to change your diaper&quot;, &quot;I need to wipe your <br/>
nose&quot;, &quot;I need you to help me carry the library books...&quot;  But there <br/>
are many times when my needs and their needs are polar opposites.  <br/>
They need to have hands free to pick up leaves and sticks and bugs <br/>
along the library sidewalk.  They need to finish stacking blocks and <br/>
don&#39;t care that their diaper is giving off clouds of green gas.  And <br/>
a runny nose?  Well, they need to own their face and lick off that <br/>
snot.  It&#39;s theirs, isn&#39;t it?!  See how I just run in circles with <br/>
all of this?  I drive myself batty.<br/>
