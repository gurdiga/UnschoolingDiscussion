&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t<br/>
 recall people here talk about hitting or anything of the sort, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Stick around, that topic will  surface again most likely. The last time <br/>
people were getting riled up, it was the spanking debate.<br/>
These topics come up over and over as new people join.....and interestingly <br/>
enough, some leave when people won&#39;t change their opinions on spanking for <br/>
them, nor stop questioning. But other people&#39;s lives are changed.<br/>
I think some people post very bluntly, that does not equal an attack in any <br/>
way.<br/>
Other people, like yourself, will post more gently.<br/>
That&#39;s ok. <br/>
Everyone should quit worrying about how other people post and just post in <br/>
the style they feel is best.<br/>
