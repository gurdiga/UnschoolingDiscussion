Arguing to help people understand unschooling is the purpose of this list, <br/>
not disrupting with crazy examples designed to... designed to WHAT!?   <br/>
<br/>
If I decide to unschool but I&#39;m not very good at it,  is that like driving a <br/>
car without a license?  And if I run over someone does it matter if I saw them <br/>
or not?   Sheeeeesh.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about REAL things, helpful to children&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
I  know that extreme analogies can help clarify thinking, but to take <br/>
something benign and happy and compare it to assault is no longer analogous in a <br/>
useful way.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this discussion is helping people understand unschooling. I<br/>
think if it&#39;s shut down and the questioners are shooed off the list,<br/>
less learning about strewing and unschooling will happen. <br/>
<br/>
If there are people out there who are seriously worried that strewing<br/>
is or can be manipulative, wouldn&#39;t it be more productive to keep<br/>
talking about how to do it (as people have been, I know, and it&#39;s been<br/>
great) so it&#39;s not manipulative, rather than dismiss the concerns of<br/>
the worriers as nonsense or crazy or personally offensive?<br/>
<br/>
I know from being on other lists that &quot;strewing (or some forms of<br/>
strewing) is manipulative&quot; is an idea that&#39;s out there. Should we not<br/>
acknowledge that some people think that, or should we argue against<br/>
it, so there&#39;s an argument out there to counter the idea? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Expect your ideas to be challenged.&quot;<br/>
&quot;If you don&#39;t want it discussed, don&#39;t bring it up.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t tell the rest of us that you think so-and-so is being rude and<br/>
don&#39;t bother trying to help them improve their manners.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ignore what you don&#39;t like, it might be something others like a lot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those are all self-proclaimed &quot;rules&quot; of the list. Do they apply to<br/>
list owners, too, or just the rest of us?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to take a little break from the list myself. It&#39;s been<br/>
brought to my attention that I could stand to do a little more strewing.<br/>

<br/>
Well then it&#39;s even worse.<br/>
<br/>
Hit with the door is hit with the door, regardless of intent.  A purposeful <br/>
hit isn&#39;t always harder than an accidental one.<br/>
<br/>
But in the case of a GOOD outcome--kid sees a streetmap of his own town for <br/>
the first time--it doesn&#39;t matter where he saw it (filling station, school, <br/>
home) as long as it was fascinating for him.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, there are wrongheaded ideas about unschooling out and about.<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t a catalog of those.  It&#39;s to help people who do want to <br/>
understand to understand it better. It&#39;s to help those who are on the path move <br/>
further along the path.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Expect your ideas to be challenged.&quot;<br/>
&quot;If you don&#39;t want it discussed, don&#39;t bring it up.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t tell the rest of us that you think so-and-so is being rude and<br/>

<br/>
Three of the most vocal posters are on moderation, and moderators are letting <br/>
those posts through.   If there was no intent to discuss it, the conversation <br/>
would&#39;ve mysteriously ended yesterday morning.  The suggestions to discuss it <br/>
more clearly and less wildly are intended to help others understand <br/>
unschooling better.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re quoting the rules (not self-proclaimed, carefully composed  by <br/>
the listowners with the advice of others, and posted in two places so people can <br/>
find them more easily even after they&#39;ve received them in the mail when they <br/>
join), please don&#39;t forget the purpose of the list.  If a discussion is no <br/>
longer serving the purpose, it&#39;s time to move on.<br/>

respectful relationships with our children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that this conversation has fit the list purpose <br/>
beautifully.  Several people have said onlist (and several offlist) <br/>
that this conversation has been helpful and enlightening to them.  <br/>
One person insisting that it HASN&#39;T been helpful won&#39;t change that <br/>

<br/>
And if there are people who want to know more about what is meant by <br/>
&quot;strewing&quot; and why it is often suggested as something unschooling <br/>
parents can do, then feel free to ask. Otherwise, I think it is pretty <br/>
clear that we&#39;ve all heard that Holly and Dar are critical of strewing, <br/>
at least under some conditions, and others have defended it and we&#39;ve <br/>
all had a chance to hear both sides. I trust that people having heard <br/>
it will make up their own minds.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also sure that Sandra, Joyce, and I and others will continue to <br/>
suggest &quot;strewing&quot; things in the paths of children as a way for <br/>
unschoolers to create a rich learning environment!<br/>

This thread helped me to realize how far I&#39;ve come with  &quot;strewing.&quot;  I have <br/>
one child who &#39;strews&quot; for me as much as I do for  her.  This morning I got up <br/>
to find the words from an Indigo Girls song by  the coffee pot to read.  Last <br/>
night, she called me into her room to listen  to the song and I had a hard <br/>
time understanding the lyrics.  It was cool to  wake up and see why she was so <br/>
taken with the song.<br/>
 <br/>
My son has interests that are so different than anything I would ever be  <br/>
drawn to but I learn so much as I find things that he might enjoy.  Lately  it&#39;s <br/>
been origami, robot making, and lots of computer sites that he shares with  <br/>
me.  Late last night we were playing with the voice activation on the  computer. <br/>
 So often, I see something on one of the unschooling sites and it  becomes a <br/>
new adventure for us all.<br/>
 <br/>
When I was first starting to &quot;strew&quot; it was just not natural.  I would  look <br/>
into the closet or go into stores and try and find &quot;Things to Strew.&quot;   I just <br/>
kept at it until now it&#39;s something that is a natural progression from  <br/>
conversations or something one of us reads or sees on TV.  That&#39;s one of  the <br/>
coolest things about unschooling....not knowing what the day will bring but  <br/>
realizing that it will be fun.  For me, it&#39;s been just being open to  anything that <br/>
might come up and then just finding a way to explore it soon  rather than <br/>
thinking...&quot;I&#39;ll get that someday&quot; or &quot;We&#39;ll do that someday.&quot;   I try to get it <br/>
or do it now. <br/>

I have to admit - it really gives me a good feeling to think about all <br/>

unschooling just GRAND????!!!!!<br/>
