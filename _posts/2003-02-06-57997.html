<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time> 5 Feb 2003, at  7:05pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856021163">Ok on the TV thread, Joyce said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Is she happy watching TV? Or is she using it as a way to avoid something?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you just move or is there upsetness in the family?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a question along the same lines here.  My son said he wanted to go back to school.  He knows in order to be prepared he needs to learn some of the arithmetic they use in the school.<br/>
<br/>
We collaborated at the beginning of the year and decided that using the Saxon 7/6 book would be the best way to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, we have hit a wall at fractions.  He seems ok on most of the other mathematical reasoning skills but is unable to pay attention long enough to master each of the steps in doing fraction arithmetic (specifically converting fractions to add/subtract).<br/>
<br/>
Now he says &quot;forget it, I just won&#39;t go back to school&quot; and says he is &quot;stupid&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Not going back to school would all be well and good, except I know he really *does* at least want the *option* of going back to school.  He is letting his difficulty with arithmetic stop him from doing something he really wants to do.  He is afraid to go back to school because he thinks he is too &quot;dumb&quot; to go.<br/>
<br/>
He is also a perfectionist and believes that if it doesn&#39;t come naturally to him that he is just stupid and won&#39;t succeed so he avoids it altogether and as a result he avoids other things he wants to do that might involve anything he is weak in.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want him to give up on all the things he loves just because something along the way gets hard for him.  And I want him to have the option of going back to school without feeling any more foolish than he already thinks he is.  <br/>
<br/>
Any advice?<br/>
<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

If unschooling were working happily at your home why would he want to go to <br/>
school?  Can&#39;t you just drop the Saxon stuff, drop pressing to prepare him <br/>
for school (none of that is unschooling) and help him see that he is NOT <br/>
stupid?  Do things he likes, that he&#39;ll enjoy, from which he&#39;ll learn, and <br/>
you&#39;ll learn.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; He is letting his difficulty with arithmetic stop him from doing something <br/>
he really wants to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You told him he needed to know it to go to school.  Why do you say HE is <br/>
letting it stop him?<br/>
<br/>
YOU made the &quot;requirement.&quot;   Why were you convinced he really needed that?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; And I want him to have the option of going back to school without feeling <br/>

<br/>
How old his he?  If you know a kid who&#39;s in the grade he would be in, can you <br/>
invite that child over with his math book and have the kid show him what <br/>
they&#39;re doing?<br/>
<br/>
Or can you just make the unschooling environment so cool that he no longer <br/>

<br/>
  I *do* know *many* kids in that very class.  I have looked at their materials and spoken to most of them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; He seems ok on most of the other mathematical reasoning skills but is <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Not in high school they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt;&gt;I doubt he would be behind.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   According to the materials I&#39;ve seen his friends use, and the materials my daughter used at the beginning of this year when she went back to school briefly, he is stuck at fourth grade level math in some areas....fractions being one.  <br/>
<br/>
  He is going into 9th grade.  He wants to go to college and algebra and geometry both use a great deal of fraction and division applications, especially conversions. <br/>
   <br/>
  -=-Now he says &quot;forget it, I just won&#39;t go back to school&quot; and says he is <br/>
  &quot;stupid&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;If unschooling were working happily at your home why would he want to go to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  school? &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Because he misses his public school friends and is enticed by all the high school social stuff that happens: dances, clubs, sports, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt; Can&#39;t you just drop the Saxon stuff, drop pressing to prepare him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  for school (none of that is unschooling) and help him see that he is NOT <br/>
  stupid? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Saxon was HIS suggestion, something he CHOSE.  He wanted to do it. How is that not unschooling?  And he was very happy doing it UNTIL he got to something he couldn&#39;t do easily.<br/>
<br/>
  Is it unschooling to let someone abandon his dreams because he thinks he is terminally incompetent?  <br/>
<br/>
  Does that show respect for the child and his dreams? <br/>
<br/>
  Might that lead him to believe that I *agree* with his self assessment of being &quot;stupid&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
  Or is it unschooling to believe in that child and help that child *become* competent in an area that he *wants* to be competent in, so that he can pursue his dreams?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt;&gt;Do things he likes, that he&#39;ll enjoy, from which he&#39;ll learn, and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  you&#39;ll learn.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  That *is* what we do.  But its not enough because his friends are in school. He wants to be with them and he wants to go back to school knowing he can be successful in school. <br/>
<br/>
  The things he enjoys have not helped him to learn the language of arithmetic or fractions.  He does not want to go back to school worrying that he&#39;ll fail in front of his friends.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt; He is letting his difficulty with arithmetic stop him from doing something <br/>
  he really wants to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;You told him he needed to know it to go to school.  Why do you say HE is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  letting it stop him?&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I told him (and his friends confirmed) that in order to be prepared, he should know how to do basic arithmetic:  adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, fractions, decimals, percentages, and ratios.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;YOU made the &quot;requirement.&quot;   Why were you convinced he really needed that?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Because in 9th grade, he will be expected to know how to do basic arithmetic.   I&#39;m not comfortable sending him to 9th grade when he can barely do 4th grade level work.  That is setting him up to fail.  *HIS* solution was to work through Saxon 7/6.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; And I want him to have the option of going back to school without feeling <br/>
  any more foolish than he already thinks he is.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;How old his he?  If you know a kid who&#39;s in the grade he would be in, can you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  invite that child over with his math book and have the kid show him what <br/>
  they&#39;re doing?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve suggested that.  But it never came to fruition.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;Or can you just make the unschooling environment so cool that he no longer <br/>

  I could do that, but that would not help him feel competent in an area where *he* believes he *should* be competent.<br/>

It doesn&#39;t matter how he learns fractions.  I don&#39;t care how he learns it.  And since he wants to be competent in it, I have come up with all kinds of different ways to try and help him learn it, from text books of his choosing, to hands on, to cooking, to baking, to building.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58873941">But at this point, if you were using saxon math for a year to help him go to <br/>
school, the topic isn&#39;t really unschooling anymore, is it?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I understand what you mean Sandra.  We started using Saxon in September.  We took a break in November and went back to it this week after re-evaluating whether or not he still wants to go back to school.<br/>
<br/>
He says he &quot;doesn&#39;t know&quot;.  Knowing him as I do, he means that he wants to but doesn&#39;t know if he can handle the work.<br/>
<br/>
Its like a vicious circle.  He says he wants to, I try to help, he gets frustrated and wants to quit, he abandons his real desire to go back to school (blaming me and also saying he is too stupid), and I let it go in order not to reinforce a bad experience.  Then a little while later, he wants to go to school, and the whole thing starts over again.<br/>
<br/>
I think he really wants to go, and he really wants to learn this stuff, but he wants it to be so easy that he won&#39;t have to work at it.  The reality is, if he wants to be competent he&#39;s going to have to work at it.<br/>
<br/>
Right there is where the problem is I think.  A combination of his *want* to know and his misperception that it should be easy just because he wants it.  I don&#39;t know how to help him overcome that misperception and accept that its OK to have to work at something to be good at it.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that &quot;school at home&quot; (even in one subject), and &quot;going to school&quot; are not unschooling, but I don&#39;t understand how its not unschooling if this is something that is his choosing and I&#39;m facilitating what he wants to do.<br/>

else, spelling or history, etc) yet we manage to do things like graduate<br/>

<br/>
Maybe the fear is that people will look down on your family&#39;s homeschooling<br/>
because fractions are hard for him?  I do have that sort of fear in the back<br/>
of my mind - that people will judge me or homeschooling based on what my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-964294939">&quot;How about hiring a tutor?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actually we did do this awhile ago.  But it was a bad experience all the way around, even beyond math. She was always waxing eloquently about the Bible and what it says about children respecting parents (she misunderstood my son&#39;s relationship with me) and she had a very fundamentalist Christian point of view, which we did not share, but that she felt compelled to preach.  <br/>
<br/>
I have thought about having one of his former teachers tutor him..one that he really liked.  I&#39;ll be honest though and say that I&#39;m afraid she will sit in judgement of my &quot;laxness&quot; in not forcing him to do academics every day and blame me for the fact that he doesn&#39;t understand this stuff. She thought I was nuts to take him out anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Since she still works for the district and the superintendent has a lot of power here, I don&#39;t want to take any chances.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard of any other tutors around here but I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m a bit gunshy after the last experience.<br/>
<br/>
On a few occasions his one friend tried to help him through some of it, but it didn&#39;t help and seemed to make things worse.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, Kristen.  Just a &quot;drive-by&quot; comment, as it were, when I *ought* to be <br/>
working  {smile}.  I&#39;ve been hearing this sort of thing a lot recently <br/>
about kids blaming their moms for not teaching them or forcing them to <br/>
learn something or taking them out of school and ruining their <br/>
lives.  There are two things that occur to me.  First, it might be good for <br/>
son to understand that there are countless folks who have gone all the way <br/>
through school, including college, and never learned or grasped an awful <br/>
lot of the subject material they were exposed to, fractions chief among <br/>
them!  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re already quite aware of this, but sometimes it&#39;s good <br/>
to be reminded.<br/>
<br/>
Second, it may be good for you to remember (so you don&#39;t beat yourself up <br/>
too much) that it&#39;s some small comfort for us to have someone to point the <br/>
finger at when we feel things aren&#39;t going so well, whether it&#39;s true or <br/>
not.  I had this dentist one time who was going to do a great deal of work <br/>
in my mouth, and I knew I&#39;d be hurting later.  When he saw me in the <br/>
waiting area, he called out to me in a friendly way, &quot;Hi, how&#39;re you <br/>
doing?&quot;  I called back, &quot;Fine!  But I guess you&#39;ll see to that.&quot;  That was <br/>
a pretty dark response that I had.  It certainly wasn&#39;t his fault that my <br/>
mouth was in the shape it was.  Anyway, I felt badly that I had said <br/>
that.  But, when I got into the chair a little later, he said that he <br/>
didn&#39;t mind my saying it.  In fact, he said that if it helped me in some <br/>
small way to feel a little better about my predicament, he was glad I had <br/>
said it (of course, that made me feel worse!).  I had quite a while to sit <br/>
in that chair and think about what he had said and how generous he was to <br/>
absorb my bad feelings in the hopes it would help me in some way.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think if a dentist can do that for a relative stranger, can&#39;t I <br/>
do that for my kid?  Sometimes, it helps my son to have me as a &quot;whipping <br/>
boy&quot; (sorry about that nasty term, but I can&#39;t think of another on short <br/>
notice) where he can deflect his negative feelings about himself onto <br/>
me.  I&#39;m strong and I can take it.  I don&#39;t know for sure, but I hope it <br/>
helps him.<br/>
<br/>
I also think (not scientifically at all, just a guess really) that when <br/>
some kids reach those teenage years, they need to start the separation <br/>
process from their folks, and it can get a little contrary and ugly.  It <br/>
may be part of a rite of passage.  There are lots of kids that I know who <br/>
don&#39;t seem to need to do this, but I&#39;m guessing that this could be *part* <br/>
of the reason for some of that antagonistic stuff that goes on at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s three things, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Well, there&#39;s my post for the month!  Back to working/lurking for now.<br/>
<br/>
Love and peace to everyone,<br/>

Why should you tell him whether he can or not?<br/>
Why not just let him go to school and see?  Maybe he can do the schoolwork <br/>
fine.  They only do it one day at a time.  Maybe with that real reason, he <br/>
WILL catch up.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that by you telling him what he will need (which is only what you <br/>
think he might need) and him not having fun learning it however it&#39;s <br/>
happening at home, you&#39;re doing school-style damage without school-style <br/>
benefit (if he&#39;s wanting to go to be with other people).<br/>
<br/>

He can&#39;t successfully unschool OR want to go to school the way things are <br/>
now.  <br/>
What&#39;s happening is doing more damage than good.<br/>

The lumber yard doesn&#39;t use Saxon math.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  Is it fair to him to let him give up whenever he is avoiding something he <br/>

<br/>
Is it fair to go on and on about schoolstuff when we&#39;re trying all kinds of <br/>
ways to help you see that fractions exist in the real world?<br/>
<br/>
He wants to work at a lumber yard, but he&#39;s never measured or bought lumber?  <br/>
Really?<br/>
<br/>

he said that if a kid came to a sticking point in math, the best way to get them<br/>
beyond it was to move forward. Go on to the higher math and when they see the concept<br/>
being used, they will more easily understand it. Not sure if I am explaining it well, he <br/>
did a much better job! I can&#39;t seem to find my issue though...<br/>
<br/>
I can empathize with you on the stopping if he does not get it on the first try. My <br/>
6 yo is like that too. He does not write because his letters are not perfect (I&#39;m<br/>
not pushing him) and he does not draw for the same reason. But what I have figured<br/>
out is that this is part of his learning style...basically he waits and watches and<br/>
when he is good and ready he does it overnight. He does this with most things...he<br/>
learns by watching. Even with computer games (which have been a great way for him to<br/>
learn that he does get better as time goes on), if it is too hard, his dad or I will<br/>
play it so he can watch.<br/>
<br/>
Probably not much help, but it does seem like you hitting your head against a brick wall.<br/>
Can you look at another approach...maybe you could sit down and do the worksheets while<br/>
he watches (don&#39;t &quot;teach him&quot; but rather just think out loud while doing it), use real <br/>
world examples etc. Or just wait. There was a woman on our local hsing list whose<br/>
son was having a devil of a time doing long division. He could do it in his head, just<br/>
could not write it out on paper. She figured that was good enough and backed off. A year<br/>
later, he came and asked her to show him how to do long division. She explained it and<br/>
in 15 mins he got it perfectly. Maybe just explain to him that he is not ready to &quot;get it&quot;<br/>
now and it has nothing to do with him  being stupid or you not teaching him. That lots<br/>
of friends in school don&#39;t get it either. That just because he does not get it now, does<br/>
not mean that he will never get it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that I hope that my kids learn by being unschooled is that they can never be<br/>
stupid. If they don&#39;t know something it is just because they have not learned it yet. <br/>
School teaches that there are certain things that you are supposed to know by a certain age<br/>
and if you don&#39;t know it or get it then you are stupid. What baloney.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, something else just came to me...if he wants to go to school for the social aspect, <br/>
does it matter what his math grade is? <br/>

  Maybe.  After I thought about his persistance in video games (in spite of his loud way of dealing with his frustration)....I thought maybe his avoidance of fractions, etc was probably *not* an indicator of what he would do with other dreams after all.<br/>
<br/>
  And after I asked him if he really wanted to go back to school and he said he liked being so &quot;wanted&quot; by his friends, but didn&#39;t know if he really wanted to go back, it became more clear to me that he really DOESN&#39;T know if he wants to go back.<br/>

I didn&#39;t know if he really *wanted* to learn something and needed me to be there to help him through the tough stuff *because* he gives up so easily (or so I thought).  But after thinking about the video game example, I don&#39;t think he *does* give up so easily.  <br/>
  What he actually needed was to talk about what he really wanted in regard to school.  And at the moment, he really doesn&#39;t know.<br/>

<br/>
  Well, its definitely about me trying to figure out what my role *should* be in helping him reach a goal he has.  But my mistake was not understanding what the goal actually was.<br/>
<br/>
  He hasn&#39;t even *really* decided if he *wants* to go to school in the first place.  And although he doesn&#39;t want to look imcompetent in school, it seems that is *not* the deciding factor in whether he will go.  I was wrong about that.<br/>
<br/>
  And that would definitely explain why I&#39;m having a panic attack about math preparedness, while he doesn&#39;t see the urgency of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331398844">Stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for this post.  This is exactly where I&#39;ve been at for the longest time...just trying to figure out if I should go back and prod or not.<br/>
<br/>
I totally understand the idea of &quot;moving forward&quot; in math.  What you described below is exactly the way my son learns (long break and then gets it overnight) And I agree with you completely what baloney it is to require certain things at certain times or otherwise be labeled &quot;stupid&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The whole panic button came in when he said he wanted to go back to school, knowing what *they* were going to be expecting and how different that is from the freedom of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter to *me* what his math grade is, but it might matter to him.  And it will matter to him what his friends think,  and what they think could affect the social atmosphere. <br/>
<br/>
But that is assuming of course, that he is not motivated to do anything about it, which now that I&#39;m thinking about it, does not make sense.  (If he isn&#39;t motivated to do anything about it, then he isn&#39;t going to care about the consequences and if he *does* care about the consequences, he will be motivated to do something about it.)<br/>
<br/>
Right now though, I&#39;m going to let it alone I think.  I&#39;m going to let him decide about school *first* and we&#39;&#39;ll deal with the math issue *after* that, if he even decides to go.  If and when we do deal with the &quot;math issue&quot;, I&#39;m sure he will have already come up with a plan that he&#39;s comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to keep reminding myself of his persistance with the things he *does* like that *are* difficult...and remind myself that this is only ONE thing he avoids in his life, instead of thinking that it applies in a global way.<br/>

  School teaches that there are certain things that you are supposed to know by a certain age<br/>
  and if you don&#39;t know it or get it then you are stupid. What baloney.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh, something else just came to me...if he wants to go to school for the social aspect, <br/>
  does it matter what his math grade is? <br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time> 5 Feb 2003, at 11:41pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289820165">I thought I had posted a reply, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be here.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the quick version:<br/>
<br/>
I took your suggestion and asked him about some different things.<br/>
<br/>
According to him:<br/>
<br/>
He is not happy unless it comes naturally (his words).  <br/>
<br/>
I pointed out his persistance in video games and skateboarding (and the good feeling he gets when he finally &quot;gets it&quot;) and explained it might be the same kind of thing with fractions.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding school:  He says about 50 of his friends have been telling him how much they want him to come back.  I acknowledged that it must be nice to be so wanted and he smiled sheepishly and said  &quot;yeah&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Then I asked him if going back was what HE really wanted and he said he doesn&#39;t know.  <br/>
<br/>
In the past he has said he wants to go back to see his friends but doesn&#39;t want to do all the work...so I guess he&#39;s still weighing it out.<br/>
<br/>
Guess we&#39;ll hold off on the math panic until AFTER he decides what he wants to do about school.  If he decides to actually go back, maybe *then* he&#39;ll be motivated to &quot;catch up&quot;.  And if not, maybe he won&#39;t care about the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
I only worry that he&#39;ll care about the consequences but discount his own ability to catch on.  Guess we&#39;ll have to cross that bridge if we get to it.<br/>

  &gt;   Sure I can.  But can he really do the things *he* wants to do without <br/>

  Perhaps he&#39;ll be able to grasp the concept when it&#39;s not so abstract but <br/>
  when he has a real need to know it.  That&#39;s been the story of my life so far.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;   Can he successfully complete high school when he can&#39;t add or subtract <br/>
  &gt; fractions with unlike denominators or convert a fraction to a decimal <br/>
  &gt; when its not obvious whether its &quot;tenths&quot; or &quot;Hundredths&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
  Of course!  People do it all the time.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;   Is it fair for me to tell him not to worry about it when pre-req <br/>
  &gt; courses require basic arithmetic and the lumber yard where he wants to <br/>
  &gt; work part time deals routinely in the use of fractions?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Is it fair to him to let him give up whenever he is avoiding something <br/>

<br/>
  I think these are questions you might want to ask him.  It may be helpful <br/>
  for both of you to put your cards on the table  about just how much pushing <br/>
  he *wants* from you.  And, it might be helpful for him to hear what your <br/>
  honest feelings are about pushing him or not.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;   Does that mean I should give up at the first sign of struggle?  Or keep <br/>
  &gt; going?  I just don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
  Ask him.<br/>

he&#39;ll go there and be out of communication with the real world, or unable to <br/>
get help.  And that way he&#39;ll have a real need to know, not a speculative, <br/>
theoretical need to know.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s also possible that that particular math teacher will just click for <br/>
him, or the book will be clear or just his style (odds are small, on math <br/>
books, in my experience, but it&#39;s possible...)<br/>
<br/>
There are math help websites too, if he gets stuck on a particular concept.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I understand that &quot;school at home&quot; (even in one subject), and &quot;going to <br/>

if this is something that is his choosing and I&#39;m facilitating what he wants <br/>
to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s not natural learning, and it&#39;s not trusting that he will learn <br/>
what he wants to learn when he actually wants and needs to.  It&#39;s about <br/>
school&#39;s schedule.  But worse, it&#39;s about a mom&#39;s personal fears and <br/>
perceptions of what MIGHT happen.  And if it keeps being  about extinguishing <br/>
his confidence and joy, I think it&#39;s too stressful a topic for this list.<br/>
<br/>
We could ask our neighbors to tell us school stories about homework and kids <br/>
feeling stupid.  Personally, I find that to be more sorrow than I want to <br/>
handle.  I&#39;m trying to turn away from school sorrow toward the joys of <br/>
learning.<br/>

it very gently, presenting patterns for kids to make the discoveries<br/>
themselves. (Like in the early books similar addition and multiplication and<br/>
subtraction and division problems are mixed together so that their<br/>

<br/>
Can he skip over the fractions and move on? Though some chapters build on<br/>
the previous chapters, not all of them do. Sometimes they start on something<br/>
unrelated.<br/>

  I&#39;m new here, and been just reading for awhile as told to  : ) However, I had one suggestion for this boy, if it has not already been tried? My 14 yo son was helped TREMENDOUSLY by the &quot;KEY TO&quot; fractions workbooks. Before using them he also just did not &quot; get it&quot;  They start out so simply that  my 8 yo could do it, but, if your son does not feel foolish going back that far, ..I would recommend it : ) Take it or leave it!!!

<br/>
The whole topic of math gets more difficult if both you and your son<br/>
feel ashamed of what did or didn&#39;t get learned already. Can you work<br/>
through that and let that go?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that I believe that grinding away at math will improve your<br/>
son&#39;s comprehension.  I really think that there does have to be that<br/>
epiphany that he&#39;s expecting.  When a student is interested and not<br/>
confused, and material is not too difficult, then learning really should<br/>
be enjoyable and feel nearly effortless.  (I get the feeling that this<br/>
may not be something that you believe deep down in your gut about math.)<br/>

Can anyone comment on Frank Smith&#39;s book about learning math, The Glass<br/>

Hi, Kristen --<br/>
<br/>
I can see that there is a lot of thought in your posts.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be radical here (again) without being alarming.<br/>
<br/>
In school, in math, lessons always proceed at a certain pace, whether<br/>
kids are actually succeeding in learning the material or not.  That<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean this is the right way to learn.  Understanding doesn&#39;t come<br/>
to students at a steady rate, even though the class goes tromping along.<br/>
Being able to stop and regroup when confused is a big advantage of<br/>
homeschooling.  It may  seem wrong, based on what we are used to, but it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I gather that your son has come to a full stop, and that doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
you like it&#39;s going to work.  Um, maybe not.  But slowing way, way down<br/>
and looking for alternative methods sounds good.  Removing the first<br/>
source of confusion sounds good.  Getting a tutor for a short time might<br/>
be good, if that&#39;s what your son wants.<br/>
<br/>
It might also be possible for a freshman to take a remedial math class,<br/>
and catch up to the college prep track later, in summer school or junior<br/>
college.  (Would that upset you or your son?)<br/>
<br/>
If you are tired of buying books, there are some interesting websites<br/>
online that demonstrate math concepts (that may be better than books). <br/>
I think animated illustrations of math are particularly enlightening.<br/>
(My husband needed to understand a little bit of trigonometry for a<br/>
class he was taking, and found good illustrations and explanations online.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could skip the fraction reduction part of the math text and go<br/>
on to the next lesson that doesn&#39;t use it?  Eventually you&#39;ll find<br/>
places where those techniques ARE needed, but it may click better for<br/>
your son to see what the techniques are used FOR.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I have a young adult friend who is taking math at the Junior<br/>
College, math that is mostly review for him, and he still has to rant<br/>
and rave and vent a lot of emotional frustration in order to get through<br/>
the homework.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;d say yes he could &quot;Unchoose&quot; it.  But he&#39;s already been through 6<br/>
different kinds of books,<br/>
all his choosing,...and always wants to switch when he gets to something<br/>
he doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand, instead of just working his way through it.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter how he learns fractions.  I don&#39;t care how he learns<br/>
it.  And since he wants<br/>
to be competent in it, I have come up with all kinds of different ways<br/>

doesn&#39;t understand<br/>
(usually fractions) he panics and gives up.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that fractions are not going to be easy for him to<br/>
learn if he really wants<br/>

in order to finally<br/>
understand it.  But he believes it should come to him like an epiphany<br/>

I&#39;m going to talk to him some more today.  Yesterday, in spite of his frustration he *did* get it and completed a single problem.  Maybe what I&#39;ll do is just slow down enough for him to just work one problem each day.  That would not be nearly as overwhelming to him.<br/>

  be enjoyable and feel nearly effortless.  (I get the feeling that this<br/>
  may not be something that you believe deep down in your gut about math.)&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I *do* believe that, but because of his desire to go back to school, I was worried about the time factor and how that might conflict with the timing of an epiphany.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time> 6 Feb 2003, at 10:23am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015289467">&lt;&lt; I have thought about having one of his former teachers tutor him..one that <br/>
  he really liked.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  How long was he in school?<br/>
  Could you give us another run-down of his school and homeschooling history <br/>
  please?<br/>
<br/>
  He was in school through 4th grade.  He liked his fourth grade teacher a lot (she taught him in both 3rd and 4th grades).<br/>
  He started homeschooling in 5th grade.  We started out doing a relaxed &quot;school at home&quot; but his resistance to math and writing led me to unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
  Then off and on he would say he wanted to go back to school and so I would try to help him prepare, only to have him get upset so then I would stop.<br/>
<br/>
  We took a year off from any formal stuff at all. And then at the beginning of this year he wanted to do something formal to get ready for high school.<br/>
<br/>
  So we started again, and things were going very well.  Then we took a 3 month break and since we&#39;ve gone back it, we&#39;ve coincidentally come up against fractions again...the stuff where he always gets frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
  Assuming he wanted to go back to school and did not want to feel incompetent in math, I was panicking about what to do.<br/>
  But it turns out he really doesn&#39;t know if he wants to go back.  So we need to deal with that decision first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130646544"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Has he tried the Keys To workbooks?&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, he did the entire set and at the end, he still didn&#39;t understand how and when to apply converting denominators to add and subtract, mainly because there are too many steps to it.<br/>
<br/>
The real problem is that he gets distracted multiple times throughout the entire process of solving a single problem (this is as I&#39;m showing him how to do it).  <br/>
<br/>
He interrupts me to talk about other unrelated things, or tease the dog, or get a drink, or get something to eat, or *all* of these things...right in the middle of a single problem.   Then he comes back to it after each interruption and forgets what I was trying to explain. <br/>
<br/>
As a result of all the interruptions, he doesn&#39;t retain the steps to solving it and can&#39;t apply them to the next problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Can he skip over the fractions and move on?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m thinking about doing either that or just slowing down and doing one problem per day (if he still wants to, I have to talk to him first).<br/>
