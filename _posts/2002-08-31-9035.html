&gt; Dress code violators get special T-shirts at South Carolina high<br/>
&gt; school<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; EASLEY, S.C. (AP) -- Students who violate the dress code at Easley<br/>
&gt; High<br/>
&gt; School are given something new to wear: T-shirts with the words<br/>
&gt; &quot;Tomorrow I<br/>
&gt; will dress for success.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other side of the shirt reads, &quot;Today I did not meet the SDPC<br/>
&gt; dress code<br/>
&gt; policy for proper attire,&quot; with the letters standing for the Pickens<br/>
&gt; County<br/>
&gt; school district.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Easley High Principal Betty Garrison said the shirt saves time.<br/>
&gt; Students who<br/>
&gt; broke the code in recent years could wait up to an hour for parents to<br/>
&gt; bring<br/>
&gt; a change of clothes, she said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Students can still call home for a change of clothes if they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to<br/>
&gt; wear the shirt, Garrison said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;To me, it&#39;s a very positive statement. The T-shirt is dull gray. It<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; black lettering. We intentionally selected something that would be low<br/>
&gt; key,&quot;<br/>
&gt; she said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many dress code violations involve clothing that features profanity or<br/>
&gt; items<br/>
&gt; illegal for students to have, such as beer or marijuana. Another<br/>
&gt; problem<br/>
&gt; area is the ban on midriff-baring shirts, tank tops and those with<br/>
&gt; narrow<br/>
&gt; spaghetti straps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pickens County trustee Shirley Jones said she has gotten &quot;an enormous<br/>
&gt; amount&quot; of phone calls from parents upset about the T-shirt policy.<br/>
&gt; One<br/>
&gt; parent, Randy Newman, said, &quot;I think the T-shirt is good if they make<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; kids wear them who need to wear them.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980327985">I was just thinking today how glad I was to be unschooling because my kids <br/>
can dress how they want.  I explained the meaning of the word &#39;arbitrary&#39; to <br/>
my 7 yo nephew and helped him understand how to use it appropriatly in <br/>
conversation with his teacher at school.  I also explained &#39;insubordination&#39; <br/>
as that is what he will be punished for when he uses that word with his <br/>
teacher :)  *sigh*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283934315">** I was just thinking today how glad I was to be unschooling because my<br/>

<br/>
This brought back a great memory for me.  When I was 10, in 1969, the<br/>
school rule was that we girls could wear pants to school only on cold<br/>
days.  (Prior to that, girls couldn&#39;t wear pants at all.)  There were a<br/>
lot of cold mornings followed by warm afternoons.  The vice-principal<br/>
came up to me on the playground and told me that I shouldn&#39;t be wearing<br/>
pants.  He was mean about it and I cried.  When I got home my mom phoned<br/>
him and gave him an earful about the &quot;arbitrary&quot; and &quot;capricious&quot; rule.<br/>
<br/>
(A great vocabulary lesson as well as a nice model of how to stick up<br/>
for oneself against institutional bullying.)<br/>
