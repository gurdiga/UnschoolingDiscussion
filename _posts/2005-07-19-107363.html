<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067381909">This is the end . . . really!  Thank you to all who have read my <br/>
messages and for the wonderful comments and empathy for Noelle.  <br/>
<br/>
As painful as this whole episode was, I had a feeling that something <br/>
bigger was going on.  One of my local homeschool buddies made the <br/>
comment that school and work can break the bond between parent and <br/>
child and that seems to have happened in this case.  She also said <br/>
that growth sometimes comes through tension and that this situation <br/>
was creating a lot of tension in Noelle.  And in me!<br/>
<br/>
While Noelle was still watching &quot;Star Wars&quot; with the kids at church, <br/>
her mother (my sister-in-law) called.  I started our conversation by <br/>
repeating what I had told my BIL:<br/>
<br/>
Me:  Noelle&#39;s really very unhappy here and wants to come home.<br/>
<br/>
SIL:  I don&#39;t get it.  She wanted to go and she made the <br/>
reservations and about 2 days before she threw this huge fit and <br/>
said we were making her go and that she didn&#39;t want to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  And you still decided to send her?<br/>
<br/>
SIL:  Well, it just seemed so weird and out of nowhere.  We thought <br/>
it was PMS or low blood sugar.  We told her she needed to go because <br/>
she had a commitment to you.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  I wouldn&#39;t have cared.  I would rather have known.  We just <br/>
want her to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
SIL:  I wanted her to go and have some experiences.  She just sits <br/>
at home and does nothing while I&#39;m at work all day.  I know those <br/>
are my values I&#39;m putting on her.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  It may seem like nothing to you but it is something to her.  <br/>
She IMs her friends and talks to them on the phone and they make <br/>
plans together.  Plus, maybe she is laying low and gathering her <br/>
energy to start at that new school in the fall.  <br/>
<br/>
(Note:  Noelle is going in to high school. She is not going to the <br/>
public high school with all of her friends but to a private college-<br/>
prep school where she doesn&#39;t know anyone.  Her parents are making <br/>
her take marching band and band camp which she told me she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to do.)<br/>
<br/>
SIL:  We thought that might be it--that maybe she is stressed out <br/>
about the move to the new school.   <br/>
<br/>
Me:  Well, she said she wasn&#39;t sure what she wants to do about <br/>
coming home early so you need to ask her to be sure, but I think she <br/>
wants to come home and that would work best for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
SIL:  Has she been giving you any lip?<br/>
<br/>
Me:  We&#39;ve had words, but that is between us.  I don&#39;t want her to <br/>
get in trouble for that.  She wants to come home but is afraid to <br/>
because she says she will be in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
SIL:  Well she says what she thinks. What time is she coming home <br/>
tonight?<br/>
<br/>
Me: 9 o&#39;clock<br/>
<br/>
SIL:  I can&#39;t talk to her tonight because I go to bed early for <br/>
work.  Tell her I will talk to her after work tomorrow night.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  OK (although I planned to have Noelle call no matter what time <br/>
it was!)(I was also flabbergasted that, knowing her daughter was in <br/>
pretty severe emotional distress, SIL wasn&#39;t willing to stay up past <br/>
her bedtime to do whatever she needed to do to help her daughter.)<br/>
<br/>
Noelle called her parents that night and the short version of the <br/>
story is that my husband ended up changing her reservation and <br/>
charging the fee on our credit card because her dad was balking at <br/>
the fee.  Her parents have since sent us a check.<br/>
<br/>
This all happened on a Wedsnesday and Noelle left late Saturday <br/>
afternoon.  The next 3 days Noelle was pretty peaceful and happy <br/>
because she was going home.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I told Noelle that we weren&#39;t sending her home <br/>
because we were angry with her but that we wanted her to be happy.  <br/>
She said she knew and understood but on Friday I overheard her say <br/>
to Olivia &quot;your Mom&#39;s mad at me.&quot;  I told her that I wasn&#39;t mad at <br/>
her but at her parents.  That they should have listened to her.  <br/>
That none of this was her fault.  At the airport I hugged her and <br/>
just said &quot;have a safe trip&quot;--that&#39;s all I could think of at the <br/>
time. Noelle said, &quot;Sorry for the inconvenience.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
End of Story, really!  (I&#39;m going to try to do another post with a <br/>
collection of Noelle&#39;s comments about homeschooling.  I hope I can <br/>
remember them all.)  Thank you to all who have read this far. <br/>
<br/>
 I felt it important to post this as the whole episode made me even <br/>
more committed to unschooling. It underscored for me that it is <br/>
important for my children to have choice and be respected and have a <br/>
voice in our family. I hope to have a close relationship with my <br/>
children when they are 14.</div>

When I used to have doubts about unschooling or our parenting, a trip <br/>
to my in-laws was all I needed for reassurance! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now, my children&#39;s experiences with their friends are a great <br/>
reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan just told me last week, cuddled up in my arms &lt;g&gt;, that he felt <br/>
sorry for his friends. They all had bad lives. Parents that yelled at <br/>
them. Spanked them. Shamed them. Just didn&#39;t seem to care. Or sent them <br/>
to school! He wished they all could liive with us! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s friends have all asked for info on unschooling for their <br/>
children and future children. I guess they think he turned out OK! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
