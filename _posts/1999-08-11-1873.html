&lt;&lt;&lt;I can&#39;t accept a family where the<br/>
parent allows the child to disturb / annoy / physically hurt / emotionally<br/>
harm<br/>
others without any intervention, because &#39;it&#39;s just the way he is / he can&#39;t<br/>
help<br/>
it / it&#39;s just part of his giftedness / he&#39;s spirited / he&#39;s got to be free<br/>
to<br/>
express himself....&#39;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just love what you said here!!  My oldest son (Tim is 10) is ADHD...and<br/>
also considered &#39;gifted&#39; (the public school labeled him gifted, not I).  I<br/>
see him as an incredibly intelligent young man bursting with energy!!<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, he is also very socially immature...there is no way I would ever<br/>
allow the behaviors you described in your email!  Many times, Tim has to be<br/>
in &#39;charge&#39;, and is very bossy...but he is never physical...I do NOT allow<br/>
it.  I also would never allow him to use his &#39;giftedness&#39; as an<br/>
excuse/reason for being rude.  Even the ADHD is never allowed as a reason<br/>
for any misbehavior.<br/>
<br/>
If I see him behaving inappropriately, I remove him from the situation.  I<br/>
also role play a LOT with him...to help him learn how to act/respond in<br/>
social situations.  And sure, while people with ADHD cannot help that they<br/>
have the disorder, they CAN be taught how to cope with it!!<br/>

You&#39;ll all be welcome at my place any time - as I said, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t<br/>
like the children because they are gifted / spirited / ADHD or anything else.<br/>
It&#39;s families that do nothing about unacceptable behaviour that really bug me.<br/>
And I enjoy many spirited / gifted / ADHD children, who are, I find often among<br/>
the most interesting.<br/>
