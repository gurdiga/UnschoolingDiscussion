Subject: on tv and consumerism<br/>
<br/>
&lt;SNIP&gt; my son will have a powerful tool, which is the ability to<br/>
recognize that those things may be fun but they will never bring him<br/>
happiness.  with this understanding and perspective he will be able to<br/>
foster discernment.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	I think that&#39;s great! Similar to what we do, which is help our children<br/>
understand the *reason* for the ads. We discuss: at whom the ad is<br/>
targeted; what the ad is implying; whether we know, out of the hundreds<br/>
of people we know, *anyone* who looks like the perfect actor in the ad;<br/>
whether we can believe the advertisement.<br/>
	My kids will often laugh at even &quot;serious&quot; ads, saying, &quot;Look! That ad<br/>
is trying to tell us that if we buy that car we will be sophisticated,<br/>
sexy, and popular.&quot;<br/>
	After viewing a series of cigarette billboards, in which individual<br/>
cigarettes were substituted for people in scenes (all making cigarette<br/>
smoking seem pleasurable, of course), my then-7 y.o. made a series of<br/>
counter ads. They showed the same cigarette characters, but with arms and<br/>
legs, smoke coming out, and slogans like, &quot;Don&#39;t be a butt head.&quot; I think<br/>
she&#39;s got it.<br/>
