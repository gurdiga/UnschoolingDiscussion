You can use sidewalk chalk on the drive way and write the numbers.  Use<br/>
the same color for the &quot;two&#39;s&quot; if you want to work on twos or the<br/>
&quot;fives&quot; if you want to work on fives... then have the kids jump from one<br/>
to the next and call out the number.<br/>

they do get to hear the numbers this way and jumping around is sure fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331700509">Actually Mara the Waldorf philosophy believes it is very meaningful for<br/>
children to do learning with their bodies. They have entire courses on it. I<br/>
took  a short  general one for ps teachers who were training at Sunbridge<br/>
College the Waldorf college in NY a few years ago and although as an adult I<br/>
stunk at it as I have not been comfortable with my body for a long time!<br/>
Kids really do learn a lot and can retain even more from rhythmical games<br/>
etc. They call it Eurythmy. Can anyone tell more about this here? I enjoyed<br/>
following but not comfortable leading as I march to the beat of a different<br/>
drum and my memory doesn&#39;t seem attached to my body anymore. Yes there are a<br/>
few cool  ps out there that do teach Waldorf style. It is still teacher<br/>
directed though and that is where I get confused as I am not sure it is<br/>
considered unschooling if it is teacher directed? Anyone want to comment on<br/>
that?<br/>

Not only Waldorf.  <br/>
One of the buzz phrases in language teaching circles nowadays is &quot;Total <br/>
Physical Response.&quot;   :-)<br/>
