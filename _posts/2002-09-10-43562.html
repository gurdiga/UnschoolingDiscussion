<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking about since the most recent round of <br/>
discussion about letting kids make their own food, sleep, etc. choices.  <br/>
There seems to be at least majority agreement that with babies and young <br/>
kids, we as parents follow their cues and take them to bed when they seem <br/>
sleepy and feed them when they seem hungry.  But what&#39;s the transistion from <br/>
that to taking responsibility for themselves?  This has become very <br/>
contentious for us.  If  Sam&#39;s grumpy and we suggest maybe he&#39;s hungry or <br/>
that he didn&#39;t eat anything very solid lately, he gets really mad.  How (what <br/>
words, tones, etc.) do people talk to kids about paying attention to their <br/>
body signals,  or their moods, or about nutrition in general?<br/>
<br/>
I definitely know from my own experience that making certain foods taboo <br/>
backfires horribly.  And yet I get influenced by all those research finding <br/>
about exercise and nutrition that the S.F. Chronicle has on the front page at <br/>
least once a week (because they want to hide the corporate scandals on the <br/>
third page).  I also read &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; recently and have been on the <br/>
rampage against foods containing added natural and artificial flavorings <br/>
because I hate the idea of our taste buds being manipulated by chemical <br/>
factories in New Jersey.   Same with trans-fats.  So I talk about this to my <br/>
kids (well, the older one) and  explain why I don&#39;t want to buy this stuff.  <br/>
So then of course I&#39;ve wound up depriving them and then they do binge on the <br/>
M&Ms (peanut, so we can&#39;t blame the lack of protein!) that I bought because <br/>
after all that talk about M&Ms, even with diarrhea talk added, I wanted some! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t know.  I feel confused.  I really understand the point that <br/>
deprivation and labeling things &quot;junk&quot; can make all of us desire them more <br/>
and turn the joy of those things to guilt.  I also think that some foods are <br/>
healthier for us than others.  Should I ever communicate that to my kids?  <br/>
Maybe I should say, have I totally blown it in having communicated that <br/>
belief to my kids, since I already have?  <br/>
<br/>
I never said anything to my oldest about nutrition until he was about six, <br/>
just bought my usual mix of lots of fresh and relatively unprocessed foods <br/>
along with sweets.  I very distinctly remember going out to lunch with three <br/>
other families who had rules about eating so many bites of this before you <br/>
were done and sweets only on treat day and dessert after half the sandwich.  <br/>
I had no rules.  I bought him what he wanted.  The cookie was next to the <br/>
pasta salad and whatever else there was.  My friends all looked at their kids <br/>
balking at their lunches and looked at Sam and said, &quot;Sam&#39;s the only one <br/>
eating without complaining.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t have rules.  But I fear I&#39;ve done as much damage in talking <br/>
about this being less nutritious than that as my friends did in having all <br/>
those rules.  How do others handle these kinds of issues?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps it&#39;s sounding like you&#39;re saying you know him better than he does.<br/>
What about bringing out a treat without it being tied to his behavior. Then<br/>
at some later date when he&#39;s calm ask him about what he&#39;s feeling when he<br/>
acts grumpy. Tell him some people find a lack of protein or just hunger in<br/>
general makes them grumpy. Or what does he think might be causing it. Just<br/>
let him ponder that because it might *not* be a lack of protein causing it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But what&#39;s the transistion from<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If that&#39;s your semi-conscious goal, then you&#39;re probably sending that<br/>
message and he&#39;s going to feel pushed. Which will make him pull back if he&#39;s<br/>
not ready to go. Make him feel like you&#39;ll be there forever and he&#39;ll feel<br/>
secure pulling away when he&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also think that some foods are<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would tell them in an informational way to help them understand why you<br/>
make the decisions *for yourself* that you do.<br/>
<br/>
People are not dropping dead of trans-fatty acids or artifical colors. Or<br/>
maybe they are! ;-) but it isn&#39;t a sure thing like poison and it takes years<br/>
and years and years. A few bags of junk or even a few dozen bags isn&#39;t going<br/>
to kill them. If you let them make the choices they want while modeling the<br/>
behavior you feel is right for yourself, the message will be there loud and<br/>
clear.<br/>

We also talk to our kids about what *we* think are unhealthy things to eat <br/>
(most sugar), and sometimes it&#39;s in the house, and sometimes not. For us, <br/>
them knowing that they have the choice to eat something or not works. YMMV. <br/>
Luckily for us, our kids don&#39;t really have a &quot;sweet tooth&quot; per se, but do <br/>
enjoy those things at times. Kind of the &quot;everything in moderation&quot; theory :-D<br/>
