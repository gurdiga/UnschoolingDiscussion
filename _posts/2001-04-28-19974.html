<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168915293">Thanks to everyone for all your help.  I&#39;m heading to the health food store next week.  There must be something in the issue about dairy products.  I&#39;ve heard so many negatives about consuming dairy products, and wheat too.  The dairy would be easy to get out of my diet, but the wheat.....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.  ambersand</div>

That sounds helpful.  Please send the info.  The wheat is still going to be a hard one.  I tried to stop eating wheat products for a few short days a couple of months ago... failed.  I&#39;m more motivated know, for obvious reasons, so I&#39;m going to try it again.  Though my 5yo loves to help me make bread (sad face).  Can I make another type of bread or do they all contain wheat?  Or should I avoid all grains?  I&#39;m  sure I&#39;ll find the answers to my questions with a bit of research.  Thanks again.<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t needed to eliminate wheat that I know of but I know there are<br/>
several kinds available at the health food stores.  They are made of<br/>
rice, rye, spelt and others I can&#39;t remember.  It would probably take<br/>
relearning the bread making art but it&#39;s doable.<br/>
<br/>
I have been collecting bread recipes and I think I may have gotten one or<br/>
two that are wheat free.  I will look and then post them here.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859626444">I don&#39;t have any recipes on hand, but you *can* get<br/>
some very good rice stuff from the grocery/healthfood<br/>
stores now... there are cookies and pudding cups and<br/>
crackers and brownie mixes, among other things, that<br/>
are fairly decent, and Rice Dream makes some very good<br/>
&#39;ice dream&#39; that tastes very much like a good quality<br/>
icemilk in lots of good flavors, and they mostly don&#39;t<br/>
have sugar... the rice itself provides the sweetness. <br/>
Rice milk (Rice Dream makes cartons of this, which<br/>
pretty much keep forever until you open them, after<br/>
which they need to be refrigerated) is very good as<br/>
well, comes in plain, vanilla and chocolate, enriched<br/>
with calcium and D... great with cereal etc, though it<br/>
does not bind the way milk does if you use it for<br/>
cooking, it acts more like water. If you want<br/>
something creamier, there are lots of soy products,<br/>
though my family has problems with soy as well as with<br/>
wheat, dairy and corn...<br/>

Hi Mary<br/>
<br/>
I am SOOO bummed.  I just discovered that about 2 years worth of<br/>
INTENSIVE reciple saving has been wiped out!  *heavy sigh*<br/>
<br/>
I tried to save them to a file storage service on line but it didn&#39;t<br/>
work.  I restored them all to my hard drive but something went wrong and<br/>
they are just GONE.<br/>
<br/>
I DID have recipes that would have fit the bill.<br/>
<br/>
I live practically next door to Natures so I see if they have any &quot;wheat<br/>
free&quot; recipes I can send on.<br/>
<br/>

We tasted a new soy ice cream product recently that was very good, I&#39;ll<br/>
look for the name of it the next time we&#39;re at Natures.  My kids love<br/>
Rice Dream but I think soy makes a better milk replacement.<br/>
<br/>
Dang, it&#39;s hard finding replacements for foods we like due to our habit<br/>
of consuming animal products!  I wish I had been raised eating the foods<br/>
I SHOULD like.  Then again, our bodies are wired to like fat and sugar so<br/>
we might discover we would have preferred these foods anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-162806402">Strawberries are reknown for causing rashes particularly if when ones eats<br/>
them one has had any oranges, lemons, etc.  Strawberries also cause citric<br/>
acid allergies which cause rashes and hives.<br/>
<br/>
Been there done that when I was in grammar school.  The school nurse<br/>
insisted that I had measles or chicken pox or some other terrible thing.  I<br/>
got to the doctor&#39;s office and he asked what I had eaten for the last<br/>
week--lots of orange juice and lots of strawberries the day before.  Bingo,<br/>
no more unlimited orange juice and strawberries and no more rashes.<br/>
