<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve read responses about so called fluff books here and how<br/>
&gt; books by<br/>
&gt; Shakespeare and Dickens wrote the pulp fiction of their day. How<br/>
&gt; about Chaucer? I had an English Lit professor in high school call him<br/>
&gt; the Larry Flint of his day!<br/>
&gt; On to my question... Does anyone limit or restrict books their<br/>
&gt; children read? I ask this because my Mom always kept a fairly good<br/>
&gt; eye on what I read as a child.(until I was about 14 or so.)For<br/>
&gt; example, when I was about 11 I wanted to read `The Thornbirds&#39; and<br/>
&gt; when I was about 12 the book in question was Steven King&#39;s `It&#39;, and<br/>
&gt; she wouldn&#39;t let me. She did explain what her reasons were any time<br/>
&gt; she did this. Usually it was something like I know you can read the<br/>
&gt; book, but I don&#39;t think at this time in your life you will understand<br/>
&gt; the issues and themes in the book... or something like that. So far,<br/>
&gt; I have not done anything like this to my children, but have been<br/>
&gt; wondering what I would say if Moly (8) should come to me with one of<br/>
&gt; my books and ask if she could read it. Then again, I don&#39;t see my<br/>
&gt; child bringing one of my books and asking if she could read it. I see<br/>
&gt; me finding her wrapped in a blanket on the couch half way through it!<br/>
&gt; I guess it all boils down to, if you have an 8, 10, 12 year old with<br/>
&gt; reading abilities far advanced, do you take into consideration their<br/>
&gt; emotional advancement as well?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why do you think children would read something they aren&#39;t emotionally ready<br/>
for?<br/>
<br/>
If he read Jurassic Park and found it upsetting do you think he&#39;d feel<br/>
compelled for some reason to keep reading or to not skip over the upsetting<br/>
parts? Why?<br/>
<br/>
Do children lack the ability to recognize uncomfortableness and to stop what<br/>
they&#39;re doing?<br/>
<br/>
Society may treat them so, but it seems to me children are a *lot* better at<br/>
that than adults are! ;-)<br/>

If he&#39;s seen the movies, IMHO, he can handle the books.  FWIW, mine <br/>
saw the Jurassic Park movies as they came out.  Wyndham was 1 when it <br/>
was in the theaters.  He probably had seen it on VHS at home by the <br/>

fantasy, I think it is okay to let them see.<br/>

Shawn has seen all 4 Jurrasic Park movies and The Mummie and The Mummie<br/>
Returns. He will get up and do other stuff during the movies, although he<br/>
hasn&#39;t said it&#39;s because he&#39;s scared, whereas he has left during portions of<br/>
the Land Before Time movies...go figure. It has led to wonderful<br/>
conversations about real vs. pretend. Tommorrow, due to his interest in<br/>
cannons I will let him watch Patriot with me so he can see what they do (we<br/>
regularly have discussions about guns and why mommy doesn&#39;t like them). We<br/>
will also go on the internet to find out how to make a volcano, make a list<br/>
of items, go shopping for them and begin making the volcano tommorrow. A<br/>
pretty fun filled day for all, don&#39;t you think???<br/>

I feel it&#39;s my responsibility to prepare them, warn them if it seems <br/>
appropriate, or to be willing to bail (turn the video off, leave the theatre, <br/>
stop reading) if they really get upset about something in the story or <br/>
presentation.  But that goes for boredom or to them being offended socially, <br/>
morally or intellectually as much as for emotional danger.<br/>
<br/>
When the parents will be there nearby and the child can ask questions and get <br/>
some direct and personalized responses, not the brush-off, not blame for <br/>
having watched/read, not belittling &quot;don&#39;t be a baby&quot; stuff, then there&#39;s not <br/>
so much danger of trauma and much potential for growth and learning.<br/>

Wyndham doesn&#39;t get scared during the movies.  He saves his irrational <br/>
fears up for more intrusive things like the kite that hangs on the <br/>
back porch which he can see at night and freaks out over.  (just one <br/>
of the many reasons my son is going to a psychiatrist!)<br/>

My dh wants a cannon for our front yard.  It would go nicely with the <br/>

out of the neighbors yard makes it really easy to give directions to <br/>
my house!)<br/>

eruptions it is rather spectacular.  It acts somewhat like a stromboli <br/>
eruption.  If you add a bit of dishsoap to the solution the eruption <br/>
is more steady (and I can&#39;t think of the name of that type of eruption <br/>
to save my life right now!) like Mt Kilowea (I suspect that is spelled <br/>
wrong)<br/>
We build ours on a plywood base out, with a chicken wire frame and <br/>
that plater wrap stuff they sell in the craft stores - looks like the <br/>
stuff they used to make casts out of.  They we painted it with acrylic <br/>
paints and sealed it with polyurethane sealer.  It lasted for years!<br/>

paris mountain.  When it was set, we put it in the sink and ran water in <br/>
something like a half inch at a time.  Each time the water stopped, we drew <br/>
a line on the mountain all the way around.  When it was done, we took it <br/>
out and photographed it from directly above.  What we had then was a <br/>

 </span></blockquote> For this one I will come out of lurking mode. <br/>
 I think kids can read things they are simply not ready for especially if you <br/>
have a child who reads and understands very well.<br/>
 My son read the Horrible Histories, History with all the Bad Parts left in. <br/>
The Rotten Romans upset him SOOOO much, (he read them when he was 8 or so) he <br/>
spent the next three years of his life denying his humanity and swearing he <br/>
was a giant river otter. When he read Where the Red Fern Grows, he cried for <br/>
a couple days and said that book should be torn up. We took it out in the <br/>
backyard and burned it. Shilo upset him but not all that much.<br/>
 The main thing we look out for are Newberry Prize winners. I read Walk Two <br/>
Moons. OH MY GAWD I cried for three days. I finished that book at night and <br/>
cried and the next morning we went out to breakfast and I sat at the table <br/>
and cried. Everyone you love dies in that book. IT WAS HORRIBLE. <br/>
 I do think that some kids are so sensitive and have so much humanity that <br/>
they cannot cope with great injustice or sad things until they are older. My <br/>
son at almost 16 (I remember when Kirby was just 8!!! OH MY GAWD Sandra) can <br/>
handle anything now. He gets sad but he quit falling apart. <br/>
 My daughter was and still is not nearly as affected by things happening to <br/>
people but gets really upset by things happening to the environment. <br/>
 Ok I said some stuff, back to lurking....<br/>
