<div id="ygrps-yiv-296231309">Well, it&#39;s beginning to look like many, if not most of us, have or do call <br/>
our children odd nicknames.  Julian sometimes idly ponders whether we actually <br/>
remember his given name. <br/>
<br/>
He is often called Puff, which is short for Juli-Puff, from a long ago <br/>
interest in Pokemon, when he gave himself the name. (He also gave Beth the name <br/>
Beffy-boo when he was little, and she is still his Beffy-Boo. Interestingly, <br/>
other, close family friends also often call her Beffy-Boo, which is a little odd, I <br/>
guess. He also gave her the name Fluff. I am rarely anything other than <br/>
Mama.) Other names include Pokey, Bubbles, and other things.  He likes them, but we <br/>
are all clear that we be careful not call him those things in front of his <br/>
friends. (At youth group which Beth advises she called him sweetie once, and <br/>
everyone just pretended she was talking to the other Youth Adviser LOL)<br/>
<br/>
In utero he was Ignatius.<br/>
<br/>
Should we all be taking out Trust funds for future counseling?<br/>
