<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As I was reading the following e-mail, my dh came 
to me with the news that a number of his clients have lost their computers due 
to a new virus.&nbsp; He started warning me about the LOVELETTER attachment and 
the ILOVEYOU subject.&nbsp; Apparently, this virus is so new that McAfee, Norton 
and other anti-virus software updates don&#39;t yet detect it or have a fix for 
it.&nbsp; Therefore, just knowing about its existence in advance, not opening 
the file when/if it is received, and deleting it immediately from your system, 
seem to be the safest proactive actions possible for now.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I hope this information helps others.&nbsp; 
Forewarned is forearmed, as they say!</font></div>

WARNING<br><br><br>&#39;I Love You&#39; Bug Hits Computers<br>Virus Delivered by E-mail 
Spreads Quickly<br><br>By BRUCE MEYERSON<br>.c The Associated Press<br><br>A new 
software virus spread quickly around the world today, swamping 
U.S.&nbsp;computer networks with e-mails entitled &#39;&#39;ILOVEYOU&#39;&#39; after 
crippling&nbsp;&nbsp;government and business computers in Asia and 
Europe.<br><br>Experts said they were stunned by the speed and wide reach of the 
virus -&nbsp;&nbsp;which struck members of U.S. Congress and British parliament 
- and warned&nbsp;&nbsp;computer users not to open the &#39;&#39;LOVELETTER&#39;&#39; attachment 
that comes with&nbsp;the&nbsp;contaminated e-mail.<br></span></blockquote></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&#39;&#39;It appears to be the same sort of class of virus 
as Melissa,&#39;&#39; the&nbsp;e-mail&nbsp;virus that overwhelmed computer systems 
around the world about a year ago,&nbsp;said Bill Pollack, spokesman for the 
CERT Coordination Center in Pittsburgh,&nbsp;a government-chartered computer 
security team.<br><br>But the new virus, which uses the Outlook e-mail program 
from Microsoft to&nbsp;spread, also may infect other types of files stored on 
desktop computers and&nbsp;network servers, CERT reported on its telephone 
hotline. According to other&nbsp;reports, the virus may rename or damage those 
files.<br><br>By midday Eastern time, a virus scanning system provided on the 
Internet by&nbsp;the Trend Micro computer security company had already detected 
more than&nbsp;500,000 infected computer files around the world, including more 
than 350,000&nbsp;in the United States.<br><br>In Britain, about 30 percent of 
company e-mail systems were brought down by&nbsp;the virus, according to Network 
Associates, another computer security firm.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">In Sweden, the tally was 80 percent.<br><br>Much 
like Melissa, the &#39;&#39;love bug&#39;&#39; spreads by infiltrating a computer 
user&#39;s&nbsp;address book and sending copies of itself to that person&#39;s 
contacts.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;the new virus also seemed to be using instant 
messaging or &#39;&#39;Internet chat&#39;&#39;&nbsp;systems such as ICQ to spread, Computer 
Associates reported.<br><br>The virus appeared in Hong Kong late in the 
afternoon, spreading throughout&nbsp;e-mail systems once a user opened one of 
the contaminated messages. It later&nbsp;moved into European parliamentary 
houses and through the high-tech systems of&nbsp;big companies and financial 
traders.<br><br>&#39;&#39;I have to tell you that, sadly, this affectionate greeting 
contains a virus&nbsp;which has immobilized the House&#39;s internal communication 
system,&#39;&#39; said&nbsp;Margaret Beckett, leader of Britain&#39;s House of Commons. 
&#39;&#39;This means that no&nbsp;member can receive e-mails from outside, nor indeed 
can we communicate with&nbsp;each other by e-mail.&#39;&#39;<br><br>In the United 
States, the &#39;&#39;love bug&#39;&#39; shut down the Florida Lottery Web site&nbsp;and e-mail 
system, said lottery spokesman Leo DiBenigno.<br><br>In Asia, Dow Jones 
Newswires and the Asian Wall Street Journal were among the&nbsp;victims. The bug 
affected only e-mail and did not prevent Dow Jones Newswires&nbsp;from 
distributing financial information to traders. The Asian Wall 
Street&nbsp;Journal would have no problems publishing, officials there 
said.<br><br>But the e-mail systems went wild.&nbsp;<br><br>&#39;&#39;It crashed all the 
computers,&#39;&#39; said Daphne Ghesquiere, a Dow Jones&nbsp;spokeswoman in Hong Kong. 
&#39;&#39;You get the message and the topic says ILOVEYOU,&nbsp;and I was among the 
stupid ones to open it. I got about five at one time and&nbsp;I was suspicious, 
but one was from Dow Jones Newswires, so I opened it.&#39;&#39;<br><br>Once the message 
was opened, Ghesquiere said, it began sending the virus to&nbsp;other e-mail 
addresses within the Dow Jones computers, blocking people&#39;s&nbsp;ability to send 
and receive e-mail. Victims sometimes received dozens of&nbsp;e-mails, all 
contaminated.<br><br>&#39;&#39;I have no idea how it got through the firewall,&#39;&#39; 
Ghesquiere said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s&nbsp;supposed to be protected.&#39;&#39;<br><br>The virus posed 
its biggest threat to corporate users, because it apparently&nbsp;had the 
ability to spread to the first 300 e-mail&nbsp;addresses in 
affected&nbsp;accounts, virus expert Ross Wilson said.<br><br>&nbsp;&#39;&#39;It&#39;s not 
pretty,&#39;&#39; said Wilson, the Singapore-based Southeast Asia director&nbsp;of 
Symantec, a U.S.-based company that makes anti-virus software. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s 
got&nbsp;the capability of spreading very, very quickly.&#39;&#39;<br><br>In Denmark, 
the parliament, telecom company Tele Danmark, channel TV2 and 
the&nbsp;Environment and Energy Ministry were all affected starting this 
morning.<br><br>&#39;&#39;We have no clue how it got in,&#39;&#39; said Hugo Praestegaard of the 
Environment&nbsp;and Energy Ministry.<br><br>The virus hit the Swiss federal 
government computer network late in the&nbsp;morning, said Claudio Frigerio of 
the Federal Office for Information&nbsp;Technology in Bern. The system was 
switched off immediately to stop the virus&nbsp;from spreading.<br><br>Bank, 
hospital and national television e-mail networks in Switzerland were&nbsp;also 
affected, Frigerio said.<br><br>AP-NY-05-04-00 1225EDT<br><br>Copyright 2000 The
