<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132550657">Hi everyone... I am just popping in here to ask a quick question <br/>
about something that happened months ago (hopefully on this list :) )<br/>
Please bear with me...<br/>
<br/>
There was some discussion (unfortunately I don&#39;t even remember the <br/>
topic) and some scientific study or another was being used as <br/>
evidence... someone responded by saying that she thought we create <br/>
our own reality anyway and so the studies have no relevance to her <br/>
(please forgive my paraphrasing).  If this person is reading this, <br/>
please e-mail me off-list.. I feel the same way and have a few <br/>
questions I would like to ask you (if you don&#39;t mind, that is :) )<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me interrupt!!<br/>
Tori<br/>
