<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579479306">I belong to another group that seems to have mostly schooly type <br/>
homeschoolers.  One mom was recently bragging how she was planning <br/>
on starting &quot;lessons&quot; on Tuesday, but her kids had taken out their <br/>
school books and were sitting at the kitchen table insisting they <br/>
start today. &lt;Gag&gt; I don&#39;t know whether to admire these children or <br/>
to feel sorry for them.  I also don&#39;t know whether to believe her. <br/>
<br/>
I would seriously be worried if my kids acted like that.  That can&#39;t <br/>
be normal.  Has she turned them into little robots, or were they <br/>
born that way? <br/>
<br/>
She is also doing her &quot;lessons plans&quot; for next month when they will <br/>
be in the Carribean.  They will be taking most of their school <br/>
books. &lt;double gag&gt;  Poor kids.  They won&#39;t know what to do with <br/>
themselves in the Carribean unless mom is spoonfeeding them some <br/>
grammar exercises.  Sad.<br/>
<br/>
The same mom has critized unschooling in the past. <br/>
<br/>
I unsubscribed from that list.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d come and post here to people who I know will <br/>
understand.  I love this list.  It is such an inspiration to me, I <br/>
love my free-spirited, self-motivated, creative children.</div>
