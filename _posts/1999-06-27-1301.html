<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427669251">Welcome, Joyce!<br/>
<br/>
Your story is interesting. Did your homeschooling decision precipitate<br/>
your husband&#39;s midlife career change and your &quot;former life?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
In my case ~ and I understand that this is not at all unusual ~ once we<br/>
made the decision to homeschool/unschool, it seemed to give me, the<br/>
&quot;adult,&quot;  the courage to change some things in *my* life, as well. For<br/>
one, I quit my job to be a stay-at-home wife/mom/grandmother; and I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed that my thinking on some other issues (spiritual, mostly) have<br/>
become much more ... shall I say ... &quot;radical&quot; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/>
<br/>
I think it boils down to the fact that I now unschool myself, as well.<br/>

 <br/>
&lt;A little birdie (hi Linda!) told me the list had calmed down and was no<br/>
longer a danger to my poor overstuffed mail box :-) &gt; Here&#39;s my intro: <br/>
I stumbled across unschooling in AOL&#39;s homeschooling forum about 5 years<br/>
ago and my almost 8 yo daughter Kathryn has been benefiting ever since.<br/>
We live not far from Boston.  I was a software engineer/technical writer<br/>
in my former life and now I spend a lot of time playing on the computer.<br/>
My husband decided to make a midlife career change and is going back to<br/>
school for Athletic Administration.  And my daughter is busy exploring<br/>
Nickelodeon after mining Cartoon Network for a couple of months, in<br/>
between drawing, writing, playing, talking and generally being a kid.<br/>

<br/>
No, I&#39;d say they were all pretty independent choices.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve noticed that my thinking on some other issues (spiritual, mostly) have<br/>
become much more ... shall I say ... &quot;radical&quot; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But this is definitely true.  :-)  Actually it&#39;s been participating on <br/>
homeschooling message boards that has forced me to think coherently about <br/>
what I believe in so that I can explain it to others.  It&#39;s made me realize <br/>
there was a radical beneath my fuddy-duddy mainstreamness.  <br/>
<br/>
Friends of ours bought a home in a neighborhood with a covenant.  That means <br/>
there&#39;s certain standards about how everyone maintains their home.  They <br/>
can&#39;t park a pop-up camper in the driveway or have an above ground pool.  Any <br/>
changes to the house need to be approved by the neighborhood.  (He said they <br/>
always do.)<br/>
<br/>
I think at one time that type of thing might have appealed to me.  It would <br/>
be safe and controlled and predictable.  Now, just thinking about it gives me <br/>
the willies and I&#39;d get the urge to paint the house flaming pink.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484077324">I have a friend who teaches history at a Canadian university.   He has one <br/>
son who, at the age of 12, quit liking school, and the rest is homeschooling <br/>
history.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, in the course of telling him what I knew and believed about <br/>
homeschooling, he became sold on unschooling.  After the semester got going <br/>
again he wrote and said, &quot;You know you&#39;ve ruined me.  I can&#39;t teach the same <br/>
way I did before.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked him to clarify and he said that he tells students that unless they <br/>
actually have an interest and a desire to be in the class that they should <br/>
drop out, and he talks about learning as opposed to teaching.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought a time or two of going back to teach writing in the public <br/>
schools, but I think I&#39;m ruined too.<br/>

Guess it&#39;s time for my intro cos I&#39;ve GOT to respond to this.  :-D<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have the nosy neighbor from H*LL - he calls the city with <br/>
complaints WEEKLY.  It&#39;s always stupid things (like calling 911 <br/>
because my car - in my driveway! - was blocking the sidewalk!! - it <br/>
was only blocking part of it and it was easy to go around).  One <br/>
couple bought the house on the other side of this guy and moved <br/>
out after only a month because they couldn&#39;t handle the <br/>
harrassment.  (I outlived the old fart before him, I&#39;ll outlive this guy, <br/>
too.   :-D )    Well, . . . .     He called and complained that my <br/>
house needed to be painted.  The inspector came out and ***OH <br/>
MY GOODNESS!!!***  the paint had some CRACKS in it and a <br/>
couple of spots were actually beginning to flake!!   We got a notice <br/>
from the city that we couldnt&#39; have doors and fascia on our house.   <br/>
:-D    (Idiots only typed half of the complaint.)  So the inspector <br/>
came out, looked at the notice and said he&#39;d have to put it back <br/>
through - it was supposed to be that I needed paint or varnish on <br/>
the doors and fasccia.  Well, the fascia WAS painted and the door <br/>
WAS varnished, BUT  little cracks do count for the city.   :-P<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, we HAD planned to paint that summer anyway, <br/>
but I have a real problem with Big Brother telling me what to do, SO <br/>
. . . . .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We waited until the day before the inspector was due back, then <br/>
painted it all PURPLE!!    :-D  :-D   (They can tell you to paint, but <br/>
they can&#39;t tell you what COLOR to paint.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK - quick intro:   I&#39;m Debbie Mitchell, wife of RHett (15 1/2 years), <br/>
mom of Ariane (14 year old, about to be 15, girl) Gabrielle (11year <br/>
old girl), Nicholas (6 year old boy) and Zachary (10 month old boy), <br/>
three dogs and one cat.   We&#39;re in Alabama - homeschool for nine <br/>
years.  I&#39;m President of the North Alabama Home Educators and <br/>
manage the Unschoolers&#39; Circle and Alabama Unschoolers lists.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nice to be here.   :-D<br/>

As far as I know such things aren&#39;t very wide spread.  On a message board we <br/>
were discussing not taking care of lawns and one person did mention her town <br/>
(or community) had an ordinance about lawn care  :-P  Not my cup of tea.<br/>

America&#39;s mighty big and incredibly diverse.  You can find just about <br/>
anything somewhere within its borders!<br/>
