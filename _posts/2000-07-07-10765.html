Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] honesty (was homesty - was discipline) OT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Okay, normally I can ignore typos but I had to change the subject line on<br/>
&gt; this one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is it just my warped mind, or did anyone else keep opening these messages<br/>
&gt; thinking that they would contain discussions about really messy houses? I<br/>
&gt; thought homesty was a clever word. Obviously derived from pigsty and<br/>
perhaps<br/>
&gt; peoplesty would be technically more accurate, but homesty just had a good<br/>
&gt; sound to it. Oh well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry if I mislead you into reading this message and thinking I had<br/>
&gt; something to contribute about honesty.<br/>

Very funny Billy... I did keep looking at it and wonder if it was suppose to <br/>
be honesty or some new unschooling word that I wasn&#39;t familiar with.<br/>
