It&#39;s  confusing sometimes for me to figure out what is<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
A natural consequence is something that would happen if you, the mother,  <br/>
didn&#39;t exist.<br/>
 <br/>
Lay your hand on a hot stove, your skin gets burned, whether mom is there  or <br/>
not.<br/>
 <br/>
Lay your hand on a hot stove, your skin gets burned and mom scoops you up  <br/>
and takes you to the sink and runs cold water on it....everything after the word <br/>
 &quot;burned&quot; is not a natural consequence.  It&#39;s a reaction mom had to  seeing <br/>
her child get burned.  <br/>
 <br/>
Mom slapping the hand away or saying spitefully, &quot;SEE!  That&#39;s what  happens <br/>
when you touch a hot stove!&quot; is NOT a natural consequence.  It&#39;s  spitefulness <br/>
and meanness and stating the obvious and treating the child like  they don&#39;t <br/>
have a brain.  <br/>
 <br/>
Natural consequences can be way more complicated than my simplified  example. <br/>
 The idea is to go for the principles behind cause and  effect.  The <br/>
principle is about being empowered to make choices that will  lead to the desirable <br/>
consequences.  You don&#39;t have to let your child  suffer consequences of their <br/>
mistakes.  It&#39;s better to help them recognize  and think ahead what the <br/>
consequences might be, to interact with them to help  them make their choices, while <br/>
optimizing good consequences and minimizign the  negative ones.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. If DS gets frustrated and throws a toy at the wall and a <br/>
piece breaks off, there&#39;s no need for me to add a &#39;punishment&#39; or <br/>
something in the &quot;I told you so&quot; line - the toy is broken, that is <br/>
the consequence of throwing it against the wall. But, as part of <br/>
being mindfully present with him, I would try to notice when he is <br/>
starting to get frustrated and help him with that before it got to <br/>
the throwing stage. I might even remind him (especially important <br/>
for youngish children) that he can just put it down or I can help or <br/>
whatever because it seems to me (from my perspective) that it might <br/>
get broken at the rate things are going. If he chooses to continue, <br/>
throws it and breaks it, I&#39;ll commisserate over the feelings that <br/>
brings (sadness etc) and see what we can come up with to repair the <br/>
toy (if it is reparable). The discussion of feelings and working to <br/>
repair what can be repaired also carries over into discussing <br/>
feelings and repairing relationships as well. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mom often gleefully hoped we would suffer from not doing what she said we <br/>
should do.<br/>
If she could, she helped the &quot;natural consequences&quot; along herself.   If she <br/>
said &quot;you&#39;ll lose it&quot; sometimes she helped it get lost.     If her dire warning <br/>
didn&#39;t come true, she was visibly miffed.   <br/>
<br/>
Because of that, because she created such an antagonism , and was so clearly <br/>
NOT &quot;on our team,&quot; we were happy for her to be wrong.   She was happy when we <br/>
were wrong.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not such a great use of happiness.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s way better to be partners.   I love Liz&#39;s point.   If the point of a <br/>
coat is to keep a person from being cold, then the prevention of cold is the <br/>
goal.   A coat isn&#39;t the only way, and it might not be as cold as the adult thinks <br/>
it will be, or the child who&#39;s running and jumping might not feel as cold as <br/>
an old-lady mom standing around would.   <br/>
<br/>
If the mom cares about the child being warm, the mom should take a coat and a <br/>
blanket and a hat, and not make a big deal about it.   If they&#39;re needed, <br/>
they&#39;re there.   If they&#39;re not needed, the mom can learn to judge a little <br/>
better, or just not mind always being over-prepared.   I like to be over-prepared <br/>
myself. &lt;g&gt;   That way the children are never under-warm, nor under-loved, nor <br/>
over-guilted. <br/>
<br/>
Much better than when I was little and felt a little like if I had died of <br/>
pneumonia my mom would&#39;ve leapt with joy at the big &quot;I told you so&quot; to be carved <br/>
on my tombstone.   (A natural consequence of ignoring a mean mother, <br/>
perhaps.)<br/>

We&#39;ve recently moved to a new area, and we don&#39;t really know anyone well.  However, our daughter has made friends with several of the local girls, which is good.

them go out in whatever they felt comfortable wearing, but I used my <br/>
vast life experience to pack along what I knew they&#39;d need eventually. <br/>
Once at a friend&#39;s house the kids were all outside playing, mine without <br/>
coats.  Someone was aghast that I would let them out in their <br/>
shirtsleeves instead of forcing the coat upon them, I assured her they <br/>
would be back for the coats as soon as *they* got cold -- sure thing, <br/>
they did and they were so grateful for a mom who thought ahead and <br/>
brought coats, instead of resenting a mom who forced her will upon them. <br/>
The &quot;you&#39;ll see&quot; nastiness that my parents had towards anything they <br/>
&quot;knew better&quot; than me didn&#39;t make them any smarter in my eyes, it made <br/>
them ucky and not someone I wanted to be around.  (aha! a natural <br/>
consequence right there &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It IS a natural thing to do.   If kids came to play here, I would absolutely <br/>
invite them in and feed them and let them sit next to the fire and play video <br/>
games and watch movies.<br/>
<br/>
Abuse can happen outside, for one thing.<br/>
Leading kids to believe that abuse comes from entering buildings is wrong <br/>
nineteen ways.<br/>
<br/>
Helping kids practice saying &quot;NO&quot; and letting them know how to get help, <br/>
telling them to stay with the other kids, telling them it&#39;s okay to scream and run <br/>
home if they EVER feel afraid.... lots of things work better than rules and <br/>
grounding.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who were grounded have gotten pregnant, run away, and murdered their <br/>
parents (not all at the same time, as far as know).   Grouding someone isn&#39;t <br/>
safer or better than giving them information and freedom.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Going into a house isn&#39;t dangerous.   If you&#39;re telling her that as a truth, <br/>
she will soon come to doubt other things you say.<br/>
<br/>
This might have some ideas for you.   The first two (or three?) links on the <br/>
left are really good:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did you have the same issue at your old house? I&#39;d bet that you <br/>
didn&#39;t because you knew the folks involved. So... How about go along <br/>
and meet the families? Get to know the kids and the parents. Invite <br/>
them over to your house to play. (Holidays, BTW, are good because <br/>
you have a built in reason to take a plate of cookies over and say <br/>
Happy Holidays, chat a bit, and scope out the situation some). Find <br/>
out who is home when (are a bunch of 8 yr olds roaming around in a <br/>
garage with lots of chemicals and sharp stuff and no supervision or <br/>
is the garage more of a big empty play space where they can play <br/>
jacks and jump rope when it rains? Or are we talking 14 yr olds <br/>
sitting around listening to the stereo and making up dance <br/>
routines?). If you&#39;re grounding her out of fear of what might <br/>
happen, it&#39;s definitely going to be pretty limiting all around and <br/>
very likely she&#39;s going to start not trusting what you say because <br/>
she goes to 9 houses and nothing happens so when you say &#39;all&#39; are <br/>
dangerous and 9 aren&#39;t she&#39;s set up for that 10th house that might <br/>
be a problem. It also is a great way to encourage &#39;sneaking out&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
How about empowering her to know what is and isn&#39;t safe, maybe give <br/>
her a prepaid type cellphone so she can call home if she needs help, <br/>
etc. and if you really feel it necessary, a short course in self-<br/>
defense moves (of course most self defense courses start with <br/>
trusting your gut to know what is and isn&#39;t a safe place to be).<br/>
<br/>
There needs to be a balance here which seems to be missing (from <br/>
what you posted) - it seems like it&#39;s currently an all or nothing <br/>
situation - all houses are dangerous so you can&#39;t go to any. Strike <br/>
a balance somewhere - discuss what seems reasonable to each party <br/>
and find a middle ground - perhaps open to the world areas (open <br/>
garage, all-windows/screens out front enclosed porch, etc) okay, <br/>
inside closed spaces to be evaluated (for example, if the mom and DD <br/>
are the only ones there, dad at work, no sibs - odds pretty good <br/>
that what you fear won&#39;t occur, ok; if mom and dad at work and teen <br/>
brother is &#39;supervising&#39; the girls, then maybe it needs more <br/>
time/investigation; etc). <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How old is your dd?  Different ages will bring different advice :) <br/>
Even at a very young age, I talked with my kids about trusting their <br/>
gut, that little tingle or voice that warns of &quot;something hinky&quot; in the <br/>
environment, and to remove themselves and come back to me.  Hannah (9, <br/>
now) has done it a couple of times, just returned from friends&#39; homes <br/>
because it &quot;didn&#39;t feel right&quot; -- no specific behaviors or <br/>
conversations, just that inkling and she left (even as young as 6).  <br/>
Hayden (7, now) has called and requested I pick him up from my parents&#39; <br/>
home for the same reason, nothing overt, just general &quot;not feeling <br/>
good&quot;-ness going on.  I respond, support and I&#39;m open to talking about <br/>
it... mostly they&#39;re glad to know they can trust me to trust their <br/>
instincts.<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with requesting that you know where <br/>
she is and to be alerted to her entering someone&#39;s home, nor is it <br/>
improper for you to meet these people and gage your own reaction to them. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The &quot;natural consequence&quot; would be irreversible, and so, we&#39;ve been implementing unnatural consequences (grounding), which feels wrong to me, but I can&#39;t think of anything better.

&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m thinking that the unintended lesson being taught here is &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>
tell my parents or they&#39;ll punish me&quot; instead of giving her a life skill <br/>
to add to her tool box for life.  Someday (already here!) she will need <br/>
to trust herself, to be able to judge for herself which situations are <br/>
unsafe and she *doesn&#39;t* need an &quot;I-told-you-so&quot; parent waiting for her <br/>
at home.  If she has a great time, she should be able to share that with <br/>
you and know you&#39;re happy for her joy; if she has something traumatic <br/>
happen, she should be able to share that with you knowing  you&#39;ll be <br/>
supportive and loving to her; if it&#39;s just another day in the life, she <br/>
wants to know you&#39;re okay with that, too. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really *NOT* dangerous to go into someone&#39;s home, porch or garage <br/>
-- you&#39;re lying and she knows it.  It&#39;s far more dangerous for her not <br/>
to trust herself and even MORE dangerous that you&#39;ve played an <br/>
adversarial role in her life.  Stop fear mongering now and be on her team. <br/>

&gt; shirtsleeves instead of forcing the coat upon them, I assured her <br/>
&gt;they <br/>
&gt; would be back for the coats as soon as *they* got cold -- sure <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember going to my sister&#39;s house for a family gathering last <br/>
year. Mid-summer, lovely day, beautifully manicured lawn with kid <br/>
pool and playscape. DS decided not to wear his sandals at all - so I <br/>
just grabbed them and carried them along. He played merrily and DH <br/>
and I chatted and relaxed. Meanwhile, SIL and bro spent half their <br/>
time scolding their two boys (both are younger than DS who was 6 at <br/>
the time) and putting the kids&#39; shoes and socks back on them. <br/>
Somewhere late in the day, as the sun headed west and the grass got <br/>
cool, DS came and asked for his sandals so we went and got them from <br/>
the spot I had stashed them and off he went back to playing merrily.<br/>
<br/>
We had such a nice day and SIL meanwhile finally said &quot;Fine whatever <br/>
you never listen to me anyway&quot; sounding frustrated and resentful <br/>
toward her kids and the kids were probably frustrated already <br/>
because they kept trying to get their shoes and socks off and kept <br/>
having them put back on. (BTW I could understand if they were <br/>
running around in just socks - I&#39;d probably ask DS to either remove <br/>
the socks or add the shoes, his choice, because of the nasty grass <br/>
stains - but then again I wouldn&#39;t likely suggest shoes and socks <br/>
for a summertime picnic anyhow - sandals all the way for DS for as <br/>
much of the year as possible here in New England).<br/>
<br/>
Same kind of strife over food and just about everything else for <br/>
them that day. Telling the kids they couldn&#39;t go back on the <br/>
swings/playscape until they ate x amount of hot dog. We just let DS <br/>
know that hot dogs were ready, he decided he didn&#39;t want any right <br/>
then. Later on, when he felt hungry, wanted a break, he came and we <br/>
got him food. Throughout the event, we&#39;d check in and see if he <br/>
needed water, food, a quick break to rest a bit in the shade (it <br/>
wasn&#39;t particularly hot though), etc. <br/>
<br/>
DH knows that after that kind of family event, I&#39;m going to <br/>
eventually overflow and unlock my tongue and pour out the <br/>
frustrations...<br/>

&gt; &gt; To her, it seems like a natural thing to do, but I&#39;m worried about <br/>
&gt; &gt; potential abuse situations, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It IS a natural thing to do.   If kids came to play here, I would absolutely <br/>
&gt; invite them in and feed them and let them sit next to the fire and play video <br/>
&gt; games and watch movies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  I think our main problem, as Deb pointed out in another response, is that we&#39;re not familiar with the families, and we need to remedy that situation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Abuse can happen outside, for one thing.<br/>
&gt; Leading kids to believe that abuse comes from entering buildings is wrong <br/>
&gt; nineteen ways.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not exactly saying that &quot;going into buildings&quot; is dangerous, but that being in a place that is hidden from view, with people we don&#39;t know is potentially dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Helping kids practice saying &quot;NO&quot; and letting them know how to get help, <br/>
&gt; telling them to stay with the other kids, telling them it&#39;s okay to scream and run <br/>

&gt; grounding.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very good points.  I will work with her on these points.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kids who were grounded have gotten pregnant, run away, and murdered their <br/>
&gt; parents (not all at the same time, as far as know).   Grouding someone isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; safer or better than giving them information and freedom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Going into a house isn&#39;t dangerous.   If you&#39;re telling her that as a truth, <br/>
&gt; she will soon come to doubt other things you say.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been stating it as an absolute truth, but maybe she&#39;s not hearing it that way.  I do want her to be able to trust us.<br/>

Hi, Kevin!<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t remember how old your daughter is.<br/>
 <br/>
Instead of such an ineffective unnatural consequence, how about an  effective <br/>
one?  Supervise her more closely.  If she wants to meet  someone new, go over <br/>
and introduce yourself and check things out for  yourself.  Or invite the new <br/>
person over to your house, instead.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe she goes in because she&#39;s invited and it&#39;s cold outside.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think grounding is a good idea.  I wouldn&#39;t even mention the  word.  <br/>
Just be with her outside more.<br/>
 <br/>

Been a while since the L&L!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t remember how old your daughter is.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do go out with her, but most of this happens while I&#39;m at work.<br/>
Part of the problem is the fact that we&#39;re still moving into our house, and most of her toys are still not yet unpacked, so there&#39;s not much for them to do inside our house.<br/>
