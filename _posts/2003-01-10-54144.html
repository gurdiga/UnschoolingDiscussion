<div id="ygrps-yiv-422031541">I wonder if folks have any suggestions for me and my 7 yo. facing a lot of dental work.<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, we have now been to 4 dentists in her short life, two of them in which fillings and an extraction were done (with varying degrees of understanding and empathy, but plenty of coercion) and now my daughter is facing at least 7 fillings in her baby teeth.  Her current dentist (empathetic, goes slow, will not force anything if the child does not want it) suggested we go to a pediatric specialist to have the work done under anaesthetic, so as not to traumatize her with more needles etc.  She wants to then build up her trust bit by bit, so she can just clean her teeth (Michelle is sensitive to noise, is frightened of anything that sounds like a drill and is loathe to have anyone touch her mouth most of the time, including me.)  I have always been reluctant to force her tooth brushing and flossing (she won&#39;t do the flossing and only occasionally will let me do it for her), but the consequences are beginning to show.  She seems unaffected by any logical arguments I can come up with, nor complaints about her bad breath (she just breathes harder in my face LOL.)<br/>
<br/>
I am a little worried that the appointment to do this will be traumatic enough, because it&#39;s another new face and another new procedure.  I can give her plenty of information beforehand (which she likes to hear to help her prepare) and in the past, she&#39;d say she&#39;s ready, but we&#39;d get there and she&#39;d be terrified.  I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll end up not getting this done and have more rotten teeth to pull, though.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone faced this and how did you handle it?  I&#39;m trying to find a way that will respect her, yet deal with the health issue.  I know *I* have issues about dentists myself - I was slapped across the face by my dentist from 3 yo. on if I cried about getting a needle.  My mother was horrified when she heard this - she wasn&#39;t allowed  in the room in those days.  Of course, I thought it was my fault and didn&#39;t realize until, oh, in my 30&#39;s, that it was not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I keep putting it off and I think I need some wise advice.<br/>

I can&#39;t dissolve a cough drop in less than several hours, and when I was a <br/>

<br/>
I thought the same when she had her first cavities.  But one of them<br/>
got so bad, it had an abscess and had to be pulled and a spacer put in.  At<br/>
least, I felt I didn&#39;t want her to have more pain.  Her current dentist was<br/>
more than willing to do as little as possible, but she showed me the x-rays<br/>
and the decay is going down the root.  She wanted to avoid her having<br/>
another abscess and another tooth pulled, hence the suggestion to have them<br/>
looked after at the specialist.<br/>
<br/>
And I think you are right about the resistance.  After her first fillings,<br/>
her desire to brush well was reduced.  Not that she ever wanted to from the<br/>
beginning, when I used to insist on it.<br/>

<br/>
Well, this is the trick.  With her reluctance to have anyone touch her<br/>
teeth, including herself &lt;sigh&gt;, it&#39;s an uphill battle.<br/>
<br/>
My son had a crack in his front tooth from<br/>
&gt; a fall and we held onto that tooth for three years before it really<br/>
started<br/>
&gt; to show in the front and become a problem.  We have the best pediatric<br/>
&gt; dentist though.  She just kept an eye on it and we kept it really clean.<br/>
But<br/>
&gt; when it started to become a problem we did have to have it taken care of<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; used nitrous oxide which helped a lot.  He was scared going in and we<br/>
talked<br/>
&gt; about everything ahead of time and I told him it was OK to be scared, I<br/>
would &gt; be there with him holding his hand.  But he soon relaxed with the<br/>
nitrous<br/>
&gt; oxide. And everything went smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
This is heartening.<br/>
<br/>
 Our dentist explained to me that the<br/>
&gt; baby teeth have no nerves like secondary teeth.  So you don&#39;t need<br/>
Novocain.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, her first 3 fillings were done without needles, but still with a metal<br/>
clamp that went over her teeth, which was painful.  I had no idea that was<br/>
going to happen.  And this one and the dentist who pulled her abscessed<br/>
tooth both insisted she have Atavan, so that she would forget the<br/>
experience. Ha.  For the extraction, she had Novocaine and pliers and<br/>
blood.....she remembers *everything* from both visits.  And she was<br/>
adversely affected by the Atavan the second time.  Her current dentist<br/>
thinks Atavan is a bad idea (thank goodness.)<br/>
<br/>
Argh.  My remembrances of dentists (mine and hers) has my palms<br/>
a-sweating.  And yet, I subjected her to all the things I hated, thinking I<br/>
was doing the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyway your child may have a more serious problem than we have dealt with<br/>
so  your situation may be different.<br/>
<br/>
It would seem.  But I already have some fresh ideas on what to do.  Just a<br/>
bit of perspective from folks here so far has helped. And I&#39;ve been talking<br/>
it over with daughter as I&#39;ve received these replies and she&#39;s willing to<br/>
try some new strategies, such as brushing more often as long as I brush my<br/>
teeth with her.  Maybe my teeth will get better, too LOL.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I agree on the second opinion thing. I have seen 4 dentists in the last <br/>
month for that reason alone. I want to be comfortable with the decision I <br/>
make based on what I&#39;ve heard. I&#39;m not sure about filling baby teeth. It <br/>
does sound a bit strange though considering her age right now. So far all my <br/>
kids are cavity free from age 2 to 17. If I had to deal with this, I would <br/>
get 3 opinions if need be until I felt sure. You don&#39;t sound all that <br/>
comfortable with what they are suggesting to do. If they still suggest <br/>
filling, I would go for the anesthesia. I had to have 6 teeth pulled at once <br/>
when I was about 10. They put me out and it was so stress free. I wish they <br/>
would put me out for the work I need to come. Can&#39;t talk them into it <br/>
though!!!<br/>
<br/>
As far as dental treatment in the future if your daughters is prone to <br/>
problems......I would do whatever it took. Dealing with what I have to do <br/>
now, I&#39;m very aggressive in letting my kids know how important it is for <br/>
them to take care of their teeth so they don&#39;t have to deal with what I do <br/>
now. I went out and bought everyone recommended toothbrushes and watch now <br/>
how they brush. I even watched my husband tonight and gave him tips!!!! I <br/>
won&#39;t do that every night now but I will keep up with it. I&#39;ll read to them <br/>
about tooth problems and gum disease. I&#39;ll show pictures if I have to. It&#39;s <br/>
just not worth it. I also made my daughters boyfriend tonight promise to see <br/>
a dentist as he has a toothache.<br/>
<br/>
Okay so another thing to be anal about. At least it&#39;s a bit more important <br/>
than my clean floors!!!<br/>

My dentist also told us to brush with just water after snacks to help prevent <br/>
further decay of the crack my son had.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13123958">My experience with the dentist and my youngest, the only one to really have<br/>
dental problems, went like this:<br/>
<br/>
When she was about 18mns old I noticed a bit of chipping, or what looked<br/>
like chipping on her front teeth.  Called the dentist, we had been going to<br/>
this guy for years, and he looked at her teeth, declared them very decayed,<br/>
and told us he would have to tie her down, for about 1 1/2 hrs while he did<br/>
work on the three front teeth.  Maybe he would have to go back later.  She<br/>
would probably cry. Possibly for the whole 1 /12 hrs, but maybe she would go<br/>
to sleep. He smiled as he said this, and my stomach dropped out. We could do<br/>
it in the hospital under general, but we had to do it, and we didn&#39;t want to<br/>
put her under general did we?  What could we do for her? Couldn&#39;t we do it<br/>
one tooth at a time, to see how she was feeling? Since one tooth would take<br/>
about 15mins or so, and then work on the next tooth? No.  Best to do all<br/>
three at once.  Wasn&#39;t there something else?  He suggested a cocktail for me<br/>
  I wanted to knock his stupid teeth out his smile made me so sick. He<br/>
implied if we didn&#39;t have the work done great catastrophes were in store for<br/>
us. We made an appointment for a month later, and I got to work.<br/>
<br/>
I called around and got another or rather several opinions. Finally took my<br/>
daughter to the dentist I use who was billed as a family dentistry practice.<br/>
 One dentist came out to the waiting room to look at her teeth as they didn<br/>
t take children that young into the room itself.  Everyone there, the<br/>
dentist, nurses etc. kept saying, we just let the teeth rot and fall out.<br/>
<br/>
Okay...she at that point wasn&#39;t in any pain.<br/>
<br/>
Later she was in pain and another tooth looked bad;  I took her back to the<br/>
dentist.  Another dentist, the one I had usually seen and who owned the<br/>
practice, said she needed to be looked at by a pediatric dentist, and gave<br/>
me some names.<br/>
<br/>
More calling till I found a dentist who was willing to work on her without<br/>
her screaming for 1 1/2.  <br/>
She was gentle, talked to my child, funny, friendly, courteous, and was<br/>
willing to work with us to make Tehila happy,  or as happy as she could be.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up having her sedated and gave a bit of gas, and had the four front<br/>
teeth pulled. She fussed a minute or so while getting the gas, but<br/>
afterwards was fine.  She has done fine in eating and nursing; hasn&#39;t missed<br/>
the dentist at all.<br/>
<br/>
The dentist has made it a good experience for her; friendly, loving, smiling<br/>
etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
Really, I think the trick is to never put your child in that dental chair<br/>
unless and until you have a doctor who isn&#39;t a sadist, who in fact actually<br/>
likes children and is willing to work with you and your child for that child<br/>
s comfort.<br/>
<br/>
The first doctor btw was a sadist.  Several other people I met and talked<br/>
with later complained about his disrespectful ways with children, insisting<br/>
they weren&#39;t in pain when they were, getting angry at a child because she<br/>
kicked him (not deliberately) when she reacted in pain etc. etc.<br/>

ease her into it.  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s something that absolutely has to be done, I&#39;d insist that they do it <br/>
all at once, under general anesthesia, and get it over with.  No return <br/>
visits for invasive procedures, nothing like that.  <br/>
<br/>
And I might make an appointment where all she has to submit to is sitting in <br/>
the chair.  The dentist won&#39;t touch her at all, there won&#39;t be any busy-ness <br/>
of the assistant behind the chair, no noises and perhaps the dentist can just <br/>
interact with her for 15 minutes or so.  Let him hand her a balloon or a toy <br/>
and let her hop down and leave.  <br/>
<br/>
My son had a needle related trauma when he was 3, and I&#39;ve often wondered <br/>
what I&#39;d do if he HAD to have something done.  The first thing I promised <br/>
myself was to question and question to make sure this thing ABSOLUTELY, <br/>
POSITIVELY had to be done, and what the consequences would be if we did or <br/>
did not.  I think that&#39;s where I would start in your daughter&#39;s situation.  <br/>
She&#39;s about to start losing her baby teeth anyway.  Question everything.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

anesthesia.  General anesthesia requires that it be done in a hospital, a lot <br/>
more involved than chloral hydrate in the dentists office.  The chloral <br/>
hydrate s called conscious sedation.  The child is very sleepy and usually <br/>
doesn&#39;t remember.  More than nitrous oxide.<br/>

That&#39;s for sure.  I would have preferred her current dentist do the work,<br/>
but she (the dentist) is cautious of traumatizing her further and therefore<br/>
suggested the general anaesthetic (or possibly gas) which she doesn&#39;t do.<br/>
She has filled one of her teeth, when the previous filling fell out, without<br/>
problem and without needles.  She was mostly concerned about the extent of<br/>
the decay, perhaps leading to more abscesses and pulled teeth.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I could wait for that.  But I think I&#39;d rather save her the pain.<br/>
She&#39;s not in pain right now and if we could get the teeth fixed without<br/>
trauma, the hygiene we can work on more diligently.  A light went on when<br/>
Sandra mentioned the saliva thing.  I think I&#39;ve been hoping for the best,<br/>
but not doing what&#39;s needed, given the circumstances.<br/>

&gt; I agree on the second opinion thing. I have seen 4 dentists in the last<br/>
&gt; month for that reason alone. I want to be comfortable with the decision I<br/>
&gt; make based on what I&#39;ve heard. I&#39;m not sure about filling baby teeth. It<br/>
&gt; does sound a bit strange though considering her age right now. So far all<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; kids are cavity free from age 2 to 17.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky them!  Probably good genes and hygiene.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to deal with this, I would<br/>
&gt; get 3 opinions if need be until I felt sure. You don&#39;t sound all that<br/>
&gt; comfortable with what they are suggesting to do. If they still suggest<br/>
&gt; filling, I would go for the anesthesia.<br/>
<br/>
Good advice.<br/>
<br/>
 I had to have 6 teeth pulled at once<br/>
&gt; when I was about 10. They put me out and it was so stress free. I wish<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; would put me out for the work I need to come. Can&#39;t talk them into it<br/>
&gt; though!!!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;ve asked for the same thing and keep getting turned down.  And now<br/>
Novocaine isn&#39;t working as well for me.  I need at least 4 needles per tooth<br/>
to get the nerves to freeze.  I know sometimes you get what you need to deal<br/>
with, but this is too much!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as dental treatment in the future if your daughters is prone to<br/>
&gt; problems......I would do whatever it took. Dealing with what I have to do<br/>
&gt; now, I&#39;m very aggressive in letting my kids know how important it is for<br/>
&gt; them to take care of their teeth so they don&#39;t have to deal with what I do<br/>
&gt; now. I went out and bought everyone recommended toothbrushes and watch now<br/>
&gt; how they brush. I even watched my husband tonight and gave him tips!!!! I<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t do that every night now but I will keep up with it. I&#39;ll read to<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; about tooth problems and gum disease. I&#39;ll show pictures if I have to.<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just not worth it. I also made my daughters boyfriend tonight promise to<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; a dentist as he has a toothache.<br/>
<br/>
I try not to scare her as she has enough fears as it is.  But stepping up<br/>
the hygiene and assistance from me will be a good start.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay so another thing to be anal about. At least it&#39;s a bit more important<br/>
&gt; than my clean floors!!!<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree!<br/>

&gt; us. We made an appointment for a month later, and I got to work.<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh, Rachel Ann.  I know what you mean.  I had the same experience with her<br/>
first dentist (mine also).  I felt manipulated.  He even said, &quot; if she were<br/>
my daughter, I would do it.&quot;  This is when we were facing the pulled tooth.<br/>
When I wanted to think about it, he basically ignored me the rest of the<br/>
time we were there.  I wondered afterward about his big house, pool, horses<br/>
and expensive cars and thought how we were buying them with my daughter&#39;s<br/>
trust.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I called around and got another or rather several opinions. Finally took<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; daughter to the dentist I use who was billed as a family dentistry<br/>
practice.<br/>
&gt;  One dentist came out to the waiting room to look at her teeth as they<br/>
didn<br/>
&gt; t take children that young into the room itself.  Everyone there, the<br/>
&gt; dentist, nurses etc. kept saying, we just let the teeth rot and fall out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay...she at that point wasn&#39;t in any pain.<br/>
<br/>
The second dentist was a hip young thing, who was into high tech stuff and<br/>
had a really nice assistant.  They were both women and this seemed to make a<br/>
difference to my daughter.  But they made some serious mistakes in my mind.<br/>
Threatening her with turning off the tv, taking away her treat if she didn&#39;t<br/>
submit, telling her it couldn&#39;t be that bad, stop crying.  This after<br/>
fitting her spacer, then being unable to get it off to put the &quot;glue&quot; on it<br/>
(yeah, my daughter&#39;s going to want glue in her mouth) and coming at her with<br/>
pliers.  And then she couldn&#39;t get it off anyway.  It was awful.  We were<br/>
both absolute wrecks afterward.  And it&#39;s still there after 1 1/2 years.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Later she was in pain and another tooth looked bad;  I took her back to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; dentist.  Another dentist, the one I had usually seen and who owned the<br/>
&gt; practice, said she needed to be looked at by a pediatric dentist, and gave<br/>
&gt; me some names.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; More calling till I found a dentist who was willing to work on her without<br/>
&gt; her screaming for 1 1/2.<br/>
&gt; She was gentle, talked to my child, funny, friendly, courteous, and was<br/>
&gt; willing to work with us to make Tehila happy,  or as happy as she could<br/>
be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We ended up having her sedated and gave a bit of gas, and had the four<br/>
front<br/>
&gt; teeth pulled. She fussed a minute or so while getting the gas, but<br/>
&gt; afterwards was fine.  She has done fine in eating and nursing; hasn&#39;t<br/>
missed<br/>
&gt; the dentist at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The dentist has made it a good experience for her; friendly, loving,<br/>
smiling<br/>
&gt; etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is what it has been like with the new dentist, finally.  And she<br/>
is the kind of person who advocates a wait-and-see approach.  Dd&#39;s front<br/>
bottom adult teeth came in in back of her baby teeth.  The first dentist<br/>
(whom I saw and decided to ask his opinion when I was in the office for<br/>
hygiene) would have pulled them, sight unseen.  The new dentist is letting<br/>
them fall out when they are ready (one is still there - dd looks like a<br/>
shark &lt;g&gt;.)   So, I&#39;m feeling more trusting of her advice.  And she really<br/>
wants Michelle to be comfortable, hence the suggestion of general<br/>
anaesthetic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Really, I think the trick is to never put your child in that dental chair<br/>
&gt; unless and until you have a doctor who isn&#39;t a sadist, who in fact<br/>
actually<br/>
&gt; likes children and is willing to work with you and your child for that<br/>
child<br/>
&gt; s comfort.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.  I didn&#39;t trust my instincts until too late for the most part.  I<br/>
think I&#39;ve found the right dentist for her.  And in spite of the difficulty<br/>
Michelle&#39;s had with her visits (frightened and uncooperative), *she* still<br/>
wants to go back to her because she&#39;s gentle and courteous.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it&#39;s up to me to be her advocate in advance now.  I&#39;ve been too<br/>
willing to take what they say as the &quot;truth&quot; until it all goes bad.  Time to<br/>
be skeptical and proactive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The first doctor btw was a sadist.  Several other people I met and talked<br/>
&gt; with later complained about his disrespectful ways with children,<br/>
insisting<br/>
&gt; they weren&#39;t in pain when they were, getting angry at a child because she<br/>
&gt; kicked him (not deliberately) when she reacted in pain etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how people like this stay in business.  I think there aren&#39;t enough<br/>
parents who are willing to question because of their own experiences, like<br/>
me.  It&#39;s tied up with approval-seeking for me - I&#39;m finally beginning to<br/>
extricate myself from that.  Argh.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am a little worried that the appointment to do this will be traumatic<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough, because it&#39;s another new face and another new procedure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think they can give you a sedative to give her before you go that will<br/>
help<br/>
&gt; ease her into it.<br/>
<br/>
I think that was the idea behind the Atavan.  It does nasty things to<br/>
Michelle up to 24 hours afterwards (vomiting, wobbly legs, just wierdness.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s something that absolutely has to be done, I&#39;d insist that they do<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; all at once, under general anesthesia, and get it over with.  No return<br/>
&gt; visits for invasive procedures, nothing like that.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  I think that&#39;s the way I&#39;m going.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I might make an appointment where all she has to submit to is sitting<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the chair.  The dentist won&#39;t touch her at all, there won&#39;t be any<br/>
busy-ness<br/>
&gt; of the assistant behind the chair, no noises and perhaps the dentist can<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; interact with her for 15 minutes or so.  Let him hand her a balloon or a<br/>
toy<br/>
&gt; and let her hop down and leave.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I&#39;ve been thinking to do, also.  She needs some time to feel<br/>
comfortable and so do I.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son had a needle related trauma when he was 3, and I&#39;ve often wondered<br/>
&gt; what I&#39;d do if he HAD to have something done.  The first thing I promised<br/>
&gt; myself was to question and question to make sure this thing ABSOLUTELY,<br/>
&gt; POSITIVELY had to be done, and what the consequences would be if we did or<br/>
&gt; did not.  I think that&#39;s where I would start in your daughter&#39;s situation.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s about to start losing her baby teeth anyway.  Question everything.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
I have to say I&#39;ve been lucky in this area (apparently the only area up<br/>
until now &lt;sigh&gt;)  Both my dh and I have been welcomed into the treatment<br/>
rooms at all four dentists.  In fact, I only know of one dentist who doesn&#39;t<br/>
allow it - my friend takes her daughter there (though I have no idea why.)<br/>
But I&#39;m afraid<br/>
Pam is right.<br/>
<br/>
I had a conversation with another friend whose child has experienced what we<br/>
may be about to and we talked about this.  She felt one of the reasons we<br/>
seem to have such trouble finding gentle, careful, empathetic dentists is<br/>
that they are less accustomed to children like ours (hers and mine and<br/>
perhaps others.)  They are sensitive, aware, emotional and attached instead<br/>
of children who have been in daycare and school since day one.  She felt<br/>
they had been &quot;toughened up&quot; from those experiences and more likely to &quot;obey<br/>
authority.&quot;  It had a ring of truth to me.  It might account for the<br/>
willingness of parents to hand their children over to an &quot;expert&quot; as they do<br/>
with school, thus the dentists do not expect to have to accommodate parents<br/>
like us.  Well, they&#39;re wrong.  I&#39;m getting quite a head of steam up over<br/>
this...&lt;g&gt;<br/>

children, not sure if that helps.  But she is so understanding.  I go in with <br/>
the boys and a couple of years ago my youngest would have me sit at the foot <br/>
of the chair and hold his hands and talk to him while she counted teeth.  She <br/>
would ask him if they could clean his teeth today and he would say yes or no <br/>
and that was OK.  After a couple of years he finally said yes and he even <br/>
asked that I just stand at the side.  He still won&#39;t let them take X rays.  <br/>
Next visit he has agreed to watch his brother get them.  Baby steps.  She <br/>
always takes about 5 minutes to ask them about their pets and let them talk. <br/>
(we have quite a few pets).  That really helps.<br/>
Anyway I guess I was rambling but just wanted to say look around.<br/>

My son (almost 15) has braces and dental work at the same dentist.  The<br/>

was okay.  I found out a few months ago, that whenever I wasn&#39;t there a<br/>
certain dental tech was just plain mean when she put bands on and stuff, not<br/>
gentle at all.  So what we do now is I go back with him until I cannot stand<br/>
up any longer and then I go sit down (they do not have chairs for the<br/>
parents back in the rooms).  When I go back with him, the &quot;ungentle&quot; dental<br/>
assistant never, ever works on his teeth.  It is always the nice one.  It<br/>
could be coincidence, but I doubt it, since before this he often got the<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been told by 3 different dentists that there is almost no<br/>
&gt; &gt; reason to fill a baby tooth - though pediatric dentists make a<br/>
&gt; &gt; killing doing it.  I do believe I would get a second opinion,<br/>
&gt; &gt; given that these baby teeth are about to go by the wayside<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway.  As to how to deal with a cavity prone kid with bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; dental hygiene, dunno - except to suspect that there is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; relationship between the prior dental pressure and treatment and<br/>
&gt; &gt; current resistance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I thought the same when she had her first cavities.  But one of them<br/>
&gt;got so bad, it had an abscess and had to be pulled and a spacer put in.  At<br/>
&gt;least, I felt I didn&#39;t want her to have more pain.  Her current dentist was<br/>
&gt;more than willing to do as little as possible, but she showed me the x-rays<br/>
&gt;and the decay is going down the root.  She wanted to avoid her having<br/>
&gt;another abscess and another tooth pulled, hence the suggestion to have them<br/>
&gt;looked after at the specialist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And I think you are right about the resistance.  After her first fillings,<br/>
&gt;her desire to brush well was reduced.  Not that she ever wanted to from the<br/>
&gt;beginning, when I used to insist on it.<br/>
