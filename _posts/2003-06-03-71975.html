<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t everyone do-able?  Or have I just had too much wine?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All this talk about who is doable, it&#39;s a coincidence, because yesterday <br/>
Landon and I were talking about something similar.   &quot;What would you do for $1 <br/>
million?&quot;  We had a nice, long, interesting discussion about it.  We both pretty <br/>
much agreed what limits we had to things we would do for $ 1million.. <br/>
Basically, anything except eat shit, commit a heinous violent crime like rape or <br/>
assault, or kill an innocent person.  We talked alot about killing someone for <br/>
$1million.. If it was an evil, murderous person who had killed people themselves.. <br/>
we could do it.  Landon  was a little more OK with the killing a murderer <br/>
than I was.. But, say, for $1million dollars to kill Saddam Hussien.. yeah, I&#39;de <br/>
do it.   As far as sex, we both said we would have sex with anybody, man or <br/>
woman, in the world for $1million.. Then, I thought a while.. and I said.. <br/>
well... the WHOLE world.. ANYBODY?? that could be some horribly nasty no toothed <br/>
stinking greasy 500 pound man or woman.. ughghg.. And then I thought.. about all <br/>
of the horrible evil folks that I said I would kill for $1million ,, would I <br/>
also be willing to have sex with them???  What about sex with a pedophile who <br/>
was fantasizing I was  kid????  OK, so then we re-thought the having sex with <br/>
anybody for $1million..<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, $1million to us is a LOT of money.. more than we can really <br/>
even imagine.  As a family that struggles financially sometimes, and we often <br/>
have to give up stuff we REALLY want, the thoughts of $1million is very VERY <br/>
attractive..  I&#39;m sure the wealthier someone is, the less they would be willing to <br/>
do for the $$$..  To some folks $1million is chump change.. like me going to <br/>
spend $20 at Wal-mart.   <br/>
<br/>
Also along these lines of discussion,  Landon and I had another good <br/>
conversation this morning about a magazine article I read about Kentucky horse <br/>
breeding.    I said that it is so unbelievable that folks will spend millions of <br/>
dollars on a horse, but a baby on the black market will do go for thousands.   <br/>
Also, comparing the prices for these horses to the price of a human life in terms <br/>
of insurance money or law suits.. It just does not compare.  But, Landon <br/>
said, folks who will sell thier children are desperate, usually poor people, that <br/>
a few thousand dollars seems like a fortune.  I love these talks with him.  I <br/>
have had to drive him to work the past two morning cause  one of our cars is <br/>
out of commission ( hmmm, another reason $1million would come in handy..lol.. <br/>
just think.. ACTUAL WORKING VEHICLES!..)  I used to drive him to catch a <br/>
carpool to school 35 mins away every morning.  We had lovely talks for those couple <br/>
of years.  I hadn&#39;t realized how much I missed our &quot;drive time&quot; since he got <br/>
his liscense.  <br/>
<br/>
 We do still talk alot, but it seems when its just two folks in the car, the <br/>
conversation environment is ripe.  I&#39;ve got pulled over for speeding a few <br/>
times because I was so deep in conversation I wasnt paying attention.   Once, I <br/>
got pulled over, the officer said.. &quot;Ive been following you for 5 miles, you <br/>
never checked your rearview mirror once!&quot;  I said .. &quot;Oh, officer, I am so <br/>
sorry, I was talking to my sister(she was in the car with me), we were in a deep <br/>
conversation&quot;  He looked at me like that was the sorriest excuse he had ever <br/>
heard.. LOL. But to me, it seemed very reasonable..  :-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I could kill anyone for any amount of money. Not sure I would<br/>
want to. Now if someone was hurting my kids or husband, they would be dead<br/>
for free if I had to.<br/>
<br/>
As far as sex goes, I talk a lot about who I would do, fact is I&#39;m faithful<br/>
as they come and would seriously have to consider what&#39;s at stake and what<br/>
is to be gained before I would bed anyone for any amount of money. That&#39;s a<br/>
very personal thing I would be giving up.<br/>
<br/>
And as for a million being a lot. I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s before taxes or<br/>
after??? If it&#39;s tax free, then I think that&#39;s a lot. If it&#39;s after taxes,<br/>
then to me it isn&#39;t a lot at all.<br/>

Oh Teresa...I have had such a rotten day...your email really made me laugh.  <br/>
<br/>
I love conversations with my son too...he gets me to laughin&#39; so hard.  Car <br/>
time is the best.  Especially these &quot;what if&quot; conversations.  Sometimes we get <br/>
so deep in them it takes a couple of minutes to come back to earth when we&#39;re <br/>
done. :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad that gave you a little smile... What you said also reminded me of <br/>
another &quot;phenomonon&quot;  .  Have you ever been driving alone, deep in thought, then <br/>
you sort of snap out of it. .and  ???!?!?!?!?!?   you have arrived <br/>
somewhere.. maybe not even your orignal destination, and you don&#39;t have a clue how you <br/>
got there??  Its like a time warp or something.. BAM, you are on auto pilot!.   <br/>
I have done this a few times.. Get in the car to go somewhere, then all of <br/>
the sudden, realize I am in my mother driveway, or at the grocery store..   Once <br/>
my daddy did this.. he was on interstate coming home and he was deep in <br/>
thought and missed his exit. . What was so funny was his way of telling us about <br/>
it.. He said  &quot; I was on my home, coming down I-40, then all of the sudden, I <br/>
just come to, ( as in, &quot;come to&quot;, like from passing out), and I was plumb on the <br/>
other side of Statesville&quot;  LOL.. it was so funny, like he had blacked out or <br/>
something.. He drove about 50 miles out of the way during his &quot;time warp&quot;<br/>
