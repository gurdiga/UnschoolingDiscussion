<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734188526">I was just about to put my sub on no-mail because of a very heavy schedule, but ran into some posts in my digest version that scream at me:<br/>
I have started a list of things I do not know. I have never heard of the Ideal Gas Law...Does it have anything to do with Beano?<br/>
Also, breastfed her too long is impossible if shes only 7 now.<br/>
About a clingy son, who a few years ago, he was going to live next door to me, but come home to sleep in my bed at night, well, my clingy son lives with his wife and 7 children and I dont get to see any of them often enough. <br/>
Other people love to critique our raising of children, don&#39;t they? That&#39;s OK. At least they are giving some thought to it. I like serious impersonal and objective discussions of child-rearing. I cannot stand the one who tells me what I ought to do.<br/>
I am going to look up &quot;The Nurture Assumption&quot; and Gordon Neufelds attachment parenting ASAP.<br/>
We all love &quot;I&#39;ll Love You Forever&quot; here at Grandma&#39;s house, too. We were just talking about it yesterday.<br/>
Gotta run. I have a very busy home-place list that I keep up with. I appreciate all of you on this list, too. I think I will keep on keeping up for awhile!<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Yes, Nanci, I&#39;m in Richland.  Do you ever get over this way?  DKFL is<br/>
Dorling-Kindersly Family Learning and I&#39;m one of those annoying people<br/>
who wants you to host a book party in your home so you can get free<br/>
books.  I did it mainly to get free books myself and am doing about a<br/>
party a month, but making NO $$ bc I keep getting more books!  They are<br/>
primarily nonfiction with great photography and dd does pull them off the<br/>
shelf to look at.  She especially loves &quot;Children Like Me&quot; that<br/>
introduces children from all over the world showing how they dress, what<br/>
they eat, etc (and of course where they go to school!!)<br/>

LOL!  I love this and all the other posts that were similar!  My Mom<br/>
talks about wanting to come live with us and the thought is terrifying<br/>
(even though we get along pretty well).  Wonder if I&#39;d feel differently<br/>
if I&#39;d been raised in an attachment parenting way?<br/>
Guess parenting is a great human experiment over and over, but it sure<br/>
makes sense to me to that dh and I be the primary caretakers and most<br/>
important people in their early lives!!<br/>
Sorry, this isn&#39;t exactly unschooling, except that it&#39;s life which is all<br/>
learning! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654141934">Just to let you know Gordon Neufeld has very little writing.  He took a sabbatical this last year and in theory was going to spend some time writing stuff. I am taking a workshop from him with my wife in October, once a week for eight weeks.  I will<br/>
keep you posted.  He really is absolutely fascinating and offered some of the most perceptive observations about child rearing that I have heard since I first read John Holt, Paul Goodman, Alice Miller and the like.  I don&#39;t know if he has broken new<br/>
ground or whether he just has a great way of talking about obvious truths.<br/>
