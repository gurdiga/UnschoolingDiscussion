to death by asking to return to school in the fall.  He&#39;d been having a GREAT <br/>
time unschooling.  Took to it like a fish to water.  <br/>
<br/>
The first thing I did was try not to panic, or to show that I was failing, in <br/>
my expression.<br/>
<br/>
The second thing I did was validate his request.  He had a reason for asking. <br/>
 I just didn&#39;t know yet what that reason was, but I couldn&#39;t jump to any <br/>
conclusions or make or pass any judgements.<br/>
<br/>
The third thing I did was keep my mouth shut about it for several days, until <br/>
HE wanted to talk about it again. That was hard.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that he was feeling two things.  A little lonely, and in need of <br/>
a little structure.  <br/>
<br/>
We dealt with each of those things individually, and voila&#39;!  No more talk of <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
His desire to go back to school wasn&#39;t so much about school as it was about <br/>
perceived unmet needs.  I needed to help him figure out a way to identify and <br/>
meet his own needs.  It turned into a great object lesson for the both of us.  <br/>
If I&#39;d run off half-cocked, in a panic and enrolled him right away in school, <br/>
what a disaster that would have been.<br/>
