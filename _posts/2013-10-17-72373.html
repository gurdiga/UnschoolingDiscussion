<div id="ygrps-yiv-460611476">I had an e-mail from someone with a five-year-old girl who is wanting to ride the bus to school.  I suggested other bus rides, maybe a lunch box, as a possibility, but also  mentioned that a child without a choice to go is the same as someone in school without the choice to leave.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my second response (and because I don&#39;t want to do one-on-one advisement, I&#39;ve brought it here so others can read and contribulte).<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re seriously asking me that? :-)<br/>

<br/>
Without a choice, she is powerless.<br/>
Without a choice, you are controlling her.<br/>

<br/>
If you really, truly, can&#39;t even consider letting her choose to go to school, then you better make your homelife SO GLORIOUS that school looks drab.<br/>
But every unschooler should do that.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I better put this in public. :-)<br/>
I won&#39;t use your name.<br/>
