<div id="ygrps-yiv-86879243">Hello all,<br/>
This is an amazing speech! This is why we  unschool! So our kids can express their <br/>
creativity and not be surpressed by the public schools! I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t silence her microphone. Good for her speaking her mind!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004084">It was an impressive speech but it came from a public schooled kid.  She wasn&#39;t an example of anything being suppressed.  She spent nearly 10 minutes bashing the system she gamed and from the looks of it, everyone sat there and smiled politely.  She credited her &quot;new&quot; perspective on a teacher.  Then she finished by talking about how to make the system better.  If anything I thought it showed how kids can turn out just fine in public school.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, it also illustrated how a person feels when they realize they&#39;ve wasted so many years of his/her life in a broken system.  I suspect the message was probably lost on pretty much everyone there.  <br/>
