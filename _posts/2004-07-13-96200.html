<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949617791">Some of you may have seen this site before, but I just discovered it<br/>
while looking at something completely unrelated to school or<br/>
unschooling. Anyway, it is an anti-school site hosted by a teenaged<br/>
girl from South Africa. Lots of interesting opinions and stories<br/>
and how-to&#39;s, like how to effectively protest your school, and<br/>
such. Pretty impressive fight against the machine!<br/>
