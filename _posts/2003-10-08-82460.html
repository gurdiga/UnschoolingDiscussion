&lt;&lt; Hi...Is there a kid&#39;s chat today?  My 10  year old son would like to <br/>
participate..does anyone know the details?  We are on Eastern time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
OK, I think I have this figured out.  I just did a test with someone outside <br/>
of my home and we managed to make it work.  I hope it works tomorrow!<br/>
<br/>
Interested kids are invited to an AIM buddy chat Wednesday, Oct 8, 11 AM <br/>
Pacific time.<br/>
<br/>
The chat will be called KidsChat<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t find the chat, send an AIM to melonary and I will AIM back an <br/>
invitation.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who would like to be invited at the beginning of the chat, send your <br/>
AIM screen name to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nellebelle@...">nellebelle@...</a> with KidsChat in the subject line.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have AIM, you can download it free at AOL.com<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723954625">The kids chat is going on now.  I know Pam didn&#39;t *predict* that there would be a problem, but just before 11 am my power blinked off just long enough to turn off the computers and make them run a scan disk.  AArrggghhh!<br/>
<br/>
I hope I got everyone on who present AIM screen names.<br/>

Moly just got off the kids chat. She had a blast. I had to type for her the <br/>
first two times she had something to say, just so she could see how to send. <br/>
After that she was a pro. I want to thank you for setting this up. She told me <br/>
all about another child who had a yu-gi-oh (I know that isn&#39;t how it is spelled <br/>
sorry) screen name who kept saying he/she (?) was stealing everyone&#39;s shoes. <br/>
Apparently Moly found that very funny. She asked me; &quot;Mom, why don&#39;t kids like <br/>
these live near us?&quot; and wants to know if this is going to happen again soon. <br/>
I was busy writing some over due thank you notes and all I heard was <br/>
laughter. It really means a lot to her to get to know other unschooled kids. This was <br/>
a great idea!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471968486">Erica was on too.  I asked her if she was the one stealing shoes cuz it sounds like something she&#39;d do-lol, but she said no, it was someone else.  She asked me how old Moly is.  <br/>

Matters not to me who it was, I loved that Moly had a good time! Moly only <br/>
wanted to know if the shoe stealer is a girl or a boy. I asked if it mattered, <br/>
nope I just wanna know Mom. &lt;g&gt; Moly is nine, she will be ten in January. She <br/>
is fired up about that. I&#39;m gonna have a 10 party for her. 10 presents, 10 <br/>
treats, 10 kids (if I can find 10 kids :/), 10 everything. She doesn&#39;t know yet, <br/>
maybe I will make it a surprise too.<br/>
