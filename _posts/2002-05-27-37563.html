 </span></blockquote>Probably not, Julie.  But I *can* tell you how to permanently put them off<br/>
museums.  My parents were very successful at doing that, and I&#39;m just now,<br/>
at 32 getting back into museums.<br/>
<br/>
Your docent was on the right track.  You must make sure that your children<br/>
are LEARNING, and learning in the *appropriate* way, at every single<br/>
exhibit.  Oh, and remember, museums are to LEARN.  You should not be having<br/>
fun under any circumstances.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I tell people that sometimes I think I was homeschooled, I just went to<br/>
school, too.  My mother was bound and determined that my entire life be<br/>
educational, no matter what.  She thinks I&#39;m nuts these days.  (Hmmm, maybe<br/>
I am!  But I&#39;m having fun being nuts!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I loved the part in one of Nancy Wallace&#39;s books where she skipped out of <br/>
high school to go to the zoo.  She used to watch the little kids being <br/>
interested in anything and everything there, and sometimes even the <br/>
animals.  &lt;g&gt;  It really bugged her when the parents tried to direct their <br/>
attention from the candy wrapper on the path to the animal they were <br/>
supposed to be looking at.<br/>

The first time Marty was old enough at the zoo to get around on his own some <br/>
and to express what he was interested in, he was interested in the BIG rope <br/>
put between people and the cactus and other plants which were between us and <br/>
the chain link fencing enclosing big cats.  Not the cats, the cage, the <br/>
plants---the rope.   And there was a crow.  <br/>
