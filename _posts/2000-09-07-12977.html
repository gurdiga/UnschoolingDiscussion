<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548461297">We live in an urban area in Maryland, but we are lucky to have houses only on <br/>
one side of the street and the street dead ends into an expanse of county <br/>
owned  &quot;nature area&quot;.  Our back yard is really big too.  It goes up on an <br/>
incline which has never been landscaped, so it is all natural.  But where I <br/>
really want to be is western Maryland where all of my extended family lives.  <br/>
I remember summers there that I spent as a kid.  Just breathing the air makes <br/>
me think better! One of my aunt and uncle have 10 acres of woods.  They <br/>
cleared 1 acre for their  house and barn.  Other than that it is all woods <br/>
complete with a stream.  Plenty of room for their two ponies!  When we <br/>
visited 3 weeks ago, I kept thinking what a great place for a kid to just run <br/>
around all day!  Another aunt and uncle have similar acreage and when we were <br/>
there the kids got to see the deer that come into their yard looking for corn <br/>
cobs. Sometimes 20 or more will show up.  If dh didn&#39;t need to be in the city <br/>
for his job, we&#39;d relocated in a minute!<br/>

Bliss!!<br/>

<br/>
Why is it that rural life and unschooling just seem to go so well together?  <br/>
It&#39;s nice being in a city with lots of resources, but why do I long to take <br/>
my kids out the back door and down to the pond to do some bug watching, or to <br/>
the neighbors to pet the horses, or out to the garden to weed the carrots?  <br/>

sigh.  Over and over.<br/>

living - family life sounds better - less stress - no hustle and <br/>
bustle - less distractons - *home made* bread - fresh milk and eggs <br/>
straight from the chicken and that wonderful country smell - my <br/>
daughter calls it *manure* - actually she doesnt call it manure - <br/>
but  I thought it sounded better !!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688897959">me too!  (to the husband and lifestyle bit) we live in a large-ish <br/>
village, right on the edge, and I can smell the fields from here, but <br/>
not really see them.  I want to have a small-holding and do <br/>
something like farming alpacas for the wool, chucks, maybe a <br/>
goat or three.  Dh says he couldn&#39;t live with the muck and the <br/>
smell.  What a snob!  oh, well, it&#39;s do what I want and get <br/>
divorced or stay where I am and stay married I&#39;m afraid.  *sigh*<br/>
