<div id="ygrps-yiv-297025311">In one of my previous posts, I was looking for a word to describe my <br/>
parenting style and said noncoercive parenting.  Sandra asked that I <br/>
not use that term and I&#39;ve seen her say that about other terms as <br/>
well.  I didn&#39;t realize that term was something specific so I googled <br/>
it and now see what she means.<br/>
<br/>
On this list, I understand that the ideas of unschooling are discussed <br/>
but I&#39;m curious if unschooling is a parenting style or not.  Can <br/>
unschooling be discussed without including elements of parenting?  <br/>
<br/>
My parenting style has always been way different from anyone else I&#39;ve <br/>
met until I met another true unschooling family.  I said true <br/>
unschooling because I don&#39;t count the families I met at homeschooling <br/>
park days who considered themselves unschoolers because they allowed <br/>
their kids to follow interests only in afternoons or one day per <br/>
week.  There were lots of those families.<br/>

<br/>
Not on this list, it can&#39;t.   There are other unschoolers other  <br/>
places (I don&#39;t hang out there and I don&#39;t read their stuff) who  <br/>
claim that unschooling is ONLY academics and other aspects of life  <br/>
don&#39;t need to change.  That&#39;s not what has worked for the people I&#39;ve  <br/>
respected online and whose families I have met and been impressed by.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago there communications problems because people would say  <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; about all manner of more lightly-structured   <br/>
homeschooling.  The arguments lessened when one group decided to call  <br/>
theirs &quot;eclectic homeschooling&quot; (because they felt they were using  <br/>
some unschooling and some structure, which some unschoolers  <br/>
considered &quot;not unschooling&quot;).   Because I was coming from such an  <br/>
attachment parenting background (the way we were living before we  <br/>
thought about homeschooling at all), and because much of what I had  <br/>
discovered about how children can learn and be peaceful came from our  <br/>
food freedoms and not having &quot;a bedtime,&quot; I called what I was doing  <br/>
&quot;radical unschooling.&quot;  The term had been used before, some, meaning  <br/>
totally unschooling, even math and reading.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These discussions were around 1985, I think?  (Others will remember  <br/>
numbers and dates better than I do.)<br/>
<br/>
Through lots of daily untangling of what people thought unschooling  <br/>
was, the full-on academic unschooling got &quot;unschooling,&quot; the partial- <br/>
kind-of-unschooling got &quot;eclectic&quot; and the also-includes-parenting  <br/>
got &quot;radical unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my best recollection.<br/>
<br/>
A few years later there were a couple of people who were heavily  <br/>
involved in NCP, &quot;non-coercive parenting,&quot; which came out of some [I  <br/>
don&#39;t know the terminology for it] kind of libertarians from the  <br/>
U.K.   Their ideas had to do with arranging for kids to do whatever  <br/>
kids wanted to do and to never coerce.  They considered persuasion to  <br/>
be coercion, it seemed.  Were they good parents?  Were their kids  <br/>
doing well?  None of our business; they wouldn&#39;t even say how old  <br/>
their kids were.  It was top secret confidential information.  The  <br/>
philosophy should suffice; no proof was needed.<br/>
<br/>
Having come from La Leche League, where moms nurse babies in front of  <br/>
other moms and you know the real names of those moms and babies, and  <br/>
you trusted the information because  you saw the proof all around  <br/>
you, and you saw the evidence of the failures, the only way I wanted  <br/>
to share my stories was openly that way.  I was candid and  <br/>
forthcoming about what had worked and had  not worked.<br/>
<br/>
When NCP people showed up and criticized the fact that we were naming  <br/>
our children in public, I was not at all inclined to feel ashamed.  I  <br/>
was also not inclined to help them spread a message they were  <br/>
spreading on a wholly theoretical level.  Although a few people did  <br/>
go to their sites and pick up ideas they liked and used, to overlay  <br/>
that on the unschooling discussions that were already going on wasn&#39;t  <br/>
helpful.  They weren&#39;t going to mesh.<br/>
<br/>
I dug a magnet up in my yard the other day.  It was stuck to the  <br/>
shovel. It was two inches long, and thick--half of an old ring  <br/>
magnet, and had probably been there thirty years.  It had lots of  <br/>
little pieces of iron stuck to it--the iron that&#39;s just in the dirt  <br/>
here, where water has run, and our house was build where water used  <br/>
to run.<br/>
<br/>
After many years of the idea and the criticism of unschooling being  <br/>
out in the discussions of the world, it has lots of little pieces of  <br/>
other things stuck to it.  When critics describe unschooling they  <br/>
pour on the &quot;child-led learning&quot; (which might have come from &quot;child- <br/>
led weaning, now that I&#39;m thinking of influences and cling-ons) and  <br/>
&quot;non-coercive&quot; and other phrases that are particular to something,  <br/>
but which have baggage in the form of negative history and  <br/>
unsupportable underpinnings.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really interesting.  I have heard those terms within the past <br/>
6 years which is all the time we&#39;ve been homeschooling.  With these <br/>
divisions, we&#39;d be considered radical unschoolers.  I wasn&#39;t really <br/>
sure.  <br/>
<br/>
When my first child was old enough for school, neither my ex (her <br/>
father) nor I wanted her in traditional school.  Her father <br/>
was/still is a public school teacher.  We put her in a Montessori <br/>
school and then into a Quaker school which was still similar to the <br/>
Montessori style.  I hated when he put her in public school for 3rd <br/>
grade.  He had just married another teacher with 2 kids in the p.s. <br/>
system so Claire had to be treated like the others.  Then when my <br/>
son (from 2nd marriage) was old enough for school, I was so unhappy <br/>
and wanted to keep him home.  At that time, neither my DH nor I had <br/>
even heard of homeschooling (this was in 2001).  Halfway through <br/>
Kindergarten, I met a homeschooling family at a hardware store and <br/>
it changed our lives!  <br/>
<br/>
When we first started homeschooling, it still felt weird because we <br/>
were recreating school at home.  It didn&#39;t feel natural.  Then when <br/>
I learned about unschooling, I knew right away that it was our <br/>
style.  But I&#39;ve yo-yo&#39;d between what feels natural and following <br/>
the traditional path.  It&#39;s been quite a journey so far.  <br/>

<br/>
It might be better to describe how you do parent vs trying to find one term<br/>
that fits.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I still don�t know exactly what people are looking for when they ask me what<br/>
I �do� as a parent because I have great kids that enjoy life, enjoy being<br/>
helpful, have a mind of their own�etc.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What do I do? � I am with them!� I unconsciously model what it is to be<br/>
helpful, thoughtful, empathic, to enjoy learning new things. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of my daughters was in a curling bonspiel and curled very well & her<br/>
team won. Other parents said to her, �Awesome, way to go, you won, etc.� She<br/>
looked at them and said, �It doesn�t matter that I won, I played my best and<br/>
had fun and that is all that matters.� Then she went over to the organizer<br/>
(we know her well) and she gave her a big hug and said, �Jane, thanks for<br/>
all the hard work you put into the bonspiel, I really appreciate it.� One of<br/>
the parents said to me, �How much did you have to pay her to say that!� I<br/>
told them I had absolutely nothing to do with it, that she had said that all<br/>
on her own. Then the questions are, �What did you do to have a kid like<br/>
that?!� Another parent was concerned that because my kids don�t play to win<br/>
that they wouldn�t do well in �competition�. How silly. Two of my kids were<br/>
in the older age group & won the South-Eastern Ontario Championships, then<br/>
two of my kids in the younger age group won in their age group as well. The<br/>
first time the same club had kids win in both age groups. First time 4 of<br/>
the winners were from the same family. When they were asked to be in the<br/>
next year, they said, �No thanks, it was fun but we have other stuff we want<br/>
to do instead!�<br/>
<br/>

I just do what I do!!<br/>

I treat Kirby as I would like to be treated if I were Kirby.    If  <br/>
I&#39;m going to buy  music for him, I buy music he would like instead of  <br/>
music I would like.<br/>
<br/>
Once parents have been really attending to their children&#39;s interests  <br/>
and needs for a while, I think that becomes second nature.<br/>

So when someone says &quot;I have something *better* than &quot;the Golden  <br/>

<h4>Gold Standard</h4>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was going to respond to another subject line, but this made me think of it<br/>
too...the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; and &quot;Platinum Rule&quot; discussion earlier. While<br/>
platinum can be seen as a cold, hard metal (it is warm in warm temperatures<br/>
though ;oP ), and gold as softer and more pliable, the principles stated for<br/>
each are what resonated very strongly with me. Many years ago, the Golden<br/>
Rule shifted my thinking from more selfish and self-centered thinking to a<br/>
broader view of people and life. When I began parenting, making the switch<br/>
from parenting how I&#39;d like to be parented, to parenting my kids the way<br/>
they individually needed me to parent them, was really important to all of<br/>
our well-being. Especially having children who were so different from me in<br/>
so many ways...I HAD to stretch to respond in ways that weren&#39;t natural for<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
That said, the Golden Rule is expected in our home...respect people,<br/>
animals, things, etc., which transfers to not hurting others, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of treating others as they would like to be treated seems like a<br/>
little higher-level concept. I think my kids each have a different level of<br/>
understanding of it...it has come about through having discussions about<br/>
human behavior and why people do the things they do. It has surely helped me<br/>
in life and probably has/will them too.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was a light bulb! I had a get-together of unschoolers at my house a<br/>
couple years ago. Most of us had never met each other in person, though some<br/>
had. A bunch of kids were in the pool with a couple of parents. I joined<br/>
them. I was playing with a couple of the kids and noticed that one boy was<br/>
in the big blow-up ball where four people can get in. He wouldn&#39;t let in a<br/>
girl who was trying to get in. I saw his mom right there so I hung back,<br/>
assuming she would help in some way. She watched with a smile and never said<br/>
a word, as the girl, who was shy, started quietly crying. The boy said<br/>
things like, &quot;You&#39;re not coming in! I don&#39;t like you!&quot; while the mom<br/>
continued to watch and not say a word.<br/>
<br/>
I went over and said happily, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; The girl quietly said she&#39;s<br/>
been waiting a long time to get in and he won&#39;t let her in. I told the boy<br/>
that I noticed that my new friend here was looking upset and what was going<br/>
on with him and he said, &quot;I don&#39;t want her in here,&quot; and turned away. I<br/>
moved so that I was in front of him again and said, &quot;How come?&quot; He<br/>
immediately acted like I was a huge inconvenience. He didn&#39;t want to talk to<br/>
me. I said, &quot;Are you wanting to be in there alone?&quot; He nodded, I think<br/>
seeing that this was an easy way out. Then I said, &quot;I understand you want to<br/>
be in there alone, it&#39;s really fun! I had this big ball in the pool for<br/>
everyone to share, so how much longer would you like to have in there before<br/>
we give someone else a turn?&quot; He didn&#39;t answer and turned away. I said,<br/>
&quot;Well, I know Suzie&#39;s really wants a turn, so how does 5 more minutes<br/>
sound?&quot; (he was 10 years old). He got out without a word. Had no interest in<br/>
working anything out. He clearly didn&#39;t want my presence there, didn&#39;t give<br/>
a hoot about the upset girl...just knew what he wanted and that was all that<br/>
mattered. I pleasantly said to the girl, &quot;Looks like he&#39;s done! Do you want<br/>
me to come in with you?&quot; And she said yes.<br/>
<br/>
I really had no intention of taking sides or setting up animosity...I&#39;m<br/>
really good at helping work things out so everyone&#39;s happy! I was so puzzled<br/>
by the mother&#39;s lack of interaction and the child&#39;s lack of connection to<br/>
anyone. I later learned the parents were libertarian. I didn&#39;t know anything<br/>
about libertarianism...still don&#39;t know much...not really an interest of<br/>
mine, though now I&#39;ll be googling...and I certainly wouldn&#39;t box all<br/>
libertarians into one place, but your mention of this history suddenly<br/>
brought clarity to that whole situation. Or potential clarity anyway :o)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that mom was servicing her son very well in that moment.<br/>

I consider myself a non-coercive parent and I just blogged about that<br/>
topic. But it&#39;s not a movement, it&#39;s an idea. Coercion is about using<br/>
force and manipulation in my book...persuasion and personal boundaries<br/>
aren&#39;t necessarily coercive. <br/>

I agree.<br/>
Because when you consider the underlying philosophy of treating people<br/>
how you want to be treated, it&#39;s about kindess and respect and<br/>
esoteric things that are translated into doing what that person<br/>
needs/wants.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m going to treat my children with kindness, that will look<br/>
different for each of them. They are unique and therefore it varies<br/>
quite a bit. It&#39;s still about treating them the way *I* want to be<br/>
treated....<br/>
kindly<br/>
respectfully<br/>
generously<br/>
graciously<br/>

You&#39;re right, Ren.  When I was writing that I knew they had another  <br/>
organizational name, and then I spaced looking it up.  thanks for the  <br/>
clarification.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider myself &quot;coercive,&quot; but I don&#39;t want to argue with  <br/>
people about whether persuading one of my kids (or my husband, or a  <br/>
friend) to QUICKLY do something I will explain in full later is  <br/>
coercive. &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;ve come to trust me and I hardly ever play that  <br/>
card, but once a year or so I do.<br/>
<br/>
The other principles by which we live have caused a very non-coercive  <br/>
home, but that&#39;s not the focus of our lives.  It&#39;s a by-product.<br/>

Yes, I think so.  It&#39;s like there&#39;s a rudimentary, Sunday-school  <br/>
version (tag it with the minimum recitation or understanding or Bible  <br/>
quote to &quot;prove&quot; you &quot;know it&quot;--very school-grading style), and then  <br/>
there&#39;s the REAL &quot;know&quot; it, proven by demonstrating it effortlessly  <br/>
in real-life situations.<br/>
<br/>
Someone can read about unschooling every day for a week and be able  <br/>
to name names of prominent authors and speakers, and quote some  <br/>
quotes, and write a summary, and in school that might be worth  <br/>
&quot;credit,&quot; and might be called &quot;knowing,&quot; but unless that same person  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877094135">For the Taking Children Seriously people, coercion is defined as &quot;the  <br/>
psychological state of enacting one idea or impulse while a  <br/>
conflicting impulse is still active in one&#39;s mind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
An example of coercion would be me asking my daughter to turn down her  <br/>
music and her doing it to be courteous and kind to me, while still  <br/>
wishing she was listening to it loudly.<br/>
<br/>
To me, that is simply my daughter being her gracious, generous self -  <br/>
not demanding her own way at all times. But to the TCS people, I  <br/>
coerced her because I was the cause of putting her into the position  <br/>
of doing one thing while still holding a different desire in her head.<br/>
<br/>
For years, there was a lot of NCP talk on the old AOL message boards,  <br/>
particularly. Sarah Lawrence, now Sarah Fitz-Claridge, changed the  <br/>
name to Taking Children Seriously and started the discussion list. I  <br/>
was on it for years and participated some, but it is very  <br/>
philosophical and esoteric in nature, not based on personal  <br/>
experience, and, to me, not a &quot;natural&quot; way of sharing our  <br/>
experiences, thoughts, feelings, to help each other be better parents.<br/>
<br/>
NCP and TCS were used pretty much interchangeably for a long time -  <br/>
but, officially, Taking Children Seriously is the name of the specific  <br/>
body of thought promoted primarily by Sarah Fitz-Claridge and David  <br/>
Deustch. Interestingly, they met up through Growing Without Schooling  <br/>
- Sarah kept nagging the editor, Susannah Sheffer, because they didn&#39;t  <br/>
screen the submissions enough to filter out anything that talked about  <br/>
coercing children. Susanna introduced Sarah to David Deutsch who had  <br/>
developed a formal philosophy of noncoercive parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I got a lot from reading their stuff. Gave me food for thought. I  <br/>
didn&#39;t adopt their extreme version - didn&#39;t find it reasonable and I  <br/>
found it very guilt-inducing when I couldn&#39;t make it work in real  <br/>
time. Those days, it was referred to, typically, as NCP. I don&#39;t think  <br/>
the name was changed to Taking Children Seriously until the mid to  <br/>
late 1990&#39;s. I found the proponents to be extremely frustrating to  <br/>
talk to - they were rigid in their thinking, expressed themselves in  <br/>
their own made-up vocabulary which often involved making up their own  <br/>
definitions for common terms. And, bottom line, they refused, on  <br/>
principle, to talk about their own personal experiences at all -  <br/>
without that, I found them, quite honestly, too boring. I don&#39;t think  <br/>
many of us learn well through abstract philosophical discussions - we  <br/>
learn best by sharing stories of our real lives.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, man, was she trying to coerce her?&lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
I take my kid seriously.  It&#39;d be hard not to.  He&#39;s a deep thinker, more intellectual than his parents.  When your kid&#39;s intelligence and maturity surpasses your own by the time he&#39;s talking, you pretty much have to take that seriously. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I try not to coerce him and if I have been guilty of it (and I can&#39;t think when or if I was) he&#39;s been kind enough not to point it out or shame me about it.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought of coerce and manipulate as the same thing.  My mom was a great manipulator.  She used guilt to get us to do what she wanted us to do.  I&#39;ve tried hard not to do that.  So, I didn&#39;t say stuff like my mom would have said, &quot;It&#39;d be nice for you to rub your grandmothers feet.  You don&#39;t know how hard it is to be old but you&#39;ll find out someday....And cut her toenails too, you know she can&#39;t do it.    ( I once asked my brother to hit my hand with a big rock so I wouldn&#39;t be asked to trim yellow skyscraper old lady toenails.) (gag.) <br/>
<br/>
But I have also assumed Dylan wanted to do good and helpful things so I never hesitated to ask him to grab a bag of groceries and carry it into the house.   We have the kind of relationship though, where I just wouldn&#39;t have asked if his hands were already full and he would have said if he couldn&#39;t do it for some reason and we&#39;d both be ok with that. <br/>
<br/>
I read some of the TCS stuff seven or eight years ago and found it mostly disgusting.  I think it&#39;s much more disrespectful of kids to assume they can&#39;t be talked to and treated like real people who are going to live on planet Earth with other real people their whole lives.<br/>
<br/>
The non coercive parenting stuff I&#39;ve read recently seems more reasonable to me but some of it still bugs me.  The stuff about assuming no one person&#39;s needs are greater than any other person&#39;s need bugs me.  My mom, who&#39;s had two hip replacements and who&#39;s losing some of her mobility for other reasons has a greater need to sit in the higher, firmer chair than anyone else.  So we hop out of that chair when she wants to sit.  Someone who&#39;s sick has a greater need to flop on the sofa than someone who&#39;s not sick so when the sicko comes into the room we move to a different spot.  That&#39;s ordinary courtesy and assuming kids don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t be courteous doesn&#39;t seem very respectful of kids.<br/>

that people should have the liberty to choose for themselves without <br/>

liberty as possible with as little government as necessary.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the situation you described, I would say that was *not* a <br/>
Libertarian issue at all. That was a parenting issue! (A very hands-off <br/>
parenting issue.)<br/>
<br/>
I have never heard of libertarianism as anything other than a political <br/>
party or social ideal, and especially not a parenting style. But as a <br/>
Lib, I always thought that unschooling seemed to be a perfect fit (for <br/>
me/us). But I don&#39;t think being an involved parent would conflict with <br/>
my childs liberty or right to choose. LOL I find it sad if a Lib parent <br/>
uses Libertarianism to become uninvolved in their childs life. <br/>

My daughter just asked us for a ride over to her friend&#39;s house.  <br/>

She said, &quot;I need to get going now.&quot; My husband looked at me and I  <br/>
looked at him. Both of us occupied with something - both kind of  <br/>
wishing the other would jump up and do it. I said, &quot;Please?&quot; He said,  <br/>
&quot;Yeah, okay, I&#39;ll go.&quot; It was just a moment - he did it to be nice to  <br/>
me. He would have liked to have kept doing what he was doing. So - to  <br/>
the TCS people he was just coerced. To me, that&#39;s part of daily life -  <br/>
give and take - compromise a little, do things for each other.<br/>

I was a member of the TCS online group for a while about four years<br/>
ago. There was a thread one time about picky eaters. Various parents<br/>
were seeking reassurance that it was okay to allow their children to<br/>
eat whatever they liked. I posted a reply in which I described the<br/>
then exceedingly narrow range of foods my son preferred to eat and<br/>
wrote that he was healthy anyway. I got a very stern email from one of<br/>
the group administrators telling me I&#39;d &quot;violated&quot; the TCS rule that<br/>
we don&#39;t talk about our children.<br/>
<br/>
So I wrote back to this woman, told her I thought &quot;violated&quot; was a<br/>
most extraordinary choice of word, and that, if she expected me to<br/>
talk about raising children in an abstract way without ever mentioning<br/>
my own children and their lives, I thought that idea sucked and I<br/>
wasn&#39;t interested in being a member of the group.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I was rather rude to her, but there you go. You win some,<br/>

<br/>
I have always thought of manipulation as that way of saying something that leaves the other guy feeling like he&#39;s a bad person if he doesn&#39;t do what you want.  It works because it&#39;s shame or guilt inducing.  <br/>
It&#39;s the &quot;I work and I slave and what thanks do I get&quot; kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Just asking for something isn&#39;t manipulation if the other guy can say yes or no without feeling like a sack of crap. <br/>
<br/>
Moving furniture is pretty easy because we don&#39;t have to think how the footstool will feel about being shoved over yonder but people almost never feel good about being pushed around, emotionally speaking.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I think kids who are coerced by grownups at home are at *HUGE* risk to be<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, and probably more likely to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous bosses or coworkers or roommates. <br/>
<br/>
***The same with<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t read much of that nvc stuff but what I did read made me want to kill someone.&lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m thinking, &quot;If I&#39;m not punctuating my sentences with a machete blow, I&#39;m being pretty darn peaceful.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

The TCS definition of coerce is broader. Coercion happens every time<br/>
some ever does anything while still sort of wishing they weren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
This idea is interesting (and by interesting I mean ridiculous) to me.  I just attended a talk <br/>
given by Gordon Neufeld, who wrote Hold On To Your Kids, and he pointed out that a huge <br/>
leap in development is evidenced by a child being able to experience and hold the <br/>
awareness of conflicting emotions, and that all of the &quot;higher&quot; states such as compassion, <br/>
courage, etc. are the result of a conflict between caring and something else.  (i.e. Courage <br/>
= caring + fear.)  It resonated for me that to have a state of conflict is such an important <br/>
human condition.  I&#39;m wondering if TCS might be a misunderstanding of that state, and <br/>
that there might be a belief there that people should always be left to resolve those <br/>
conflicts alone?  But that&#39;s just not how the world is.  Even if I strove to never enter into <br/>
that process, how can I set things up so that their friends don&#39;t, or other adults in their <br/>
lives don&#39;t?  I just don&#39;t see how it would be possible without pretty serious sheltering.<br/>
<br/>
To move beyond single impulse and into the ability to maintain complex relationships is <br/>
fraught with conflict, and reward, and learning.  It&#39;s all about give and take, and I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
want to take the beauty of conflict and resolution away from my children--that would be <br/>
a serious disservice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read &quot;How to Talk&quot; so many times, though, to help me get the idea of  <br/>
communicating more clearly, more succinctly, more efficiently, etc. I  <br/>
never used their scripts - I never really thought they were there for  <br/>
me to use as written, but to give really concrete examples of the kind  <br/>
of communication they were recommending.<br/>
<br/>
I really think NVC (Nonviolent Communication) was intended that way,  <br/>
too - not for people to end up all sounding scripted and alike, but to  <br/>
inform their own personal communication with the ideas of NVC. But,  <br/>
the people involved in it don&#39;t seem to much value maintaining their  <br/>
own personal communication styles, they practice talking in the NVC  <br/>
style. I can always tell when someone is reading Marshal Rosenberg  <br/>
(NVC) stuff by how they sound.<br/>
<br/>
So - yeah - I do recommend these as ways to stimulate new thinking  <br/>
about how to talk to our children. I, for example, learned from the  <br/>
&quot;How to Talk&quot; book to use way fewer words - just one word is often  <br/>
enough. I learned not to keep telling kids things they already know. I  <br/>
learned the &quot;give them in fantasy&quot; idea - which has been really great  <br/>
fun in my family for many years. This is when a kid wants something  <br/>
that you just can&#39;t immediately provide - like when we&#39;re driving  <br/>
through the desert and a kid wants to buy a cold soda - during the  <br/>
time it takes to get to the next stop, I might say, &quot;I don&#39;t just  <br/>
want  normal soda, let&#39;s get a GIANT soda! Let&#39;s get one as big as  <br/>
this car.&quot; and so on.<br/>
