Keith (MY husband) has done SCA for nearly 30 years, and keeps up  <br/>
pretty well with  swordfighting styles and forms (he went to some  <br/>
trouble to obtain a book about a questionably ancient form on some  <br/>
little island around Scotland or some such  (he&#39;s in a meeting at  <br/>
work and I couldn&#39;t find the book in his office).  He wrote this,  <br/>
about the note above when I sent it saying &quot;I hadn&#39;t heard of this&quot;:<br/>

Looks like someone opened a dojo for �western� fighting arts.  I�ve  <br/>
not heard of it before this.  All google hits were in the NC area so  <br/>
I�m not convinced about the �all over the country� statement.<br/>
  ==============<br/>
<br/>
There have been a couple of SCA guys who have done seminars for other  <br/>
SCA guys for money which was a very strange change in the way all  <br/>
that was taught.  (Well...  one I know of for sure did &quot;mundane&quot;  <br/>
seminars, and one sold a book of his personal technique, but I don&#39;t  <br/>
think he taught it outside of SCA events.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting how a tradition will jump ship like that.  I&#39;m sure  <br/>
the Okinawan guys were king of surprised/appalled the first few times  <br/>
a westerner opened a karate school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569316537">Sorry if I was being confusing...I didn&#39;t mean to imply that there <br/>
were EMAA schools all over the country.  The one here is the only <br/>
one by that name.  My husband just told me that European or Western <br/>
Martial Arts schools were starting to pop up all over the place.  If <br/>
you do a google search for &quot;Western martial arts&quot; or &quot;European <br/>
martial arts&quot; you can find some academy listings.<br/>
