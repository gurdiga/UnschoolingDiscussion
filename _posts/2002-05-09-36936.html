 </span></blockquote>Hi all:<br/>
<br/>
Am I the only one who interpreted this to mean that you would not be able to<br/>
work for the state government or get a state issued professional license<br/>
(among the types issued are for architects, barbers, hair dressers, real<br/>
estate sales and brokerage, etc.) without an accredited school&#39;s high school<br/>
diploma? If that is the correct interpretation, it is indeed reason to be<br/>
concerned. As a close to home example (my husband is an architect), an<br/>
architect usually has a Bachelors degree and experience working under a<br/>
licensed architect before receiving a state license. Since you have to pass<br/>
a state licensing exam, too, it seems that having the additional requirement<br/>
of a high school diploma from an accredited school is ridiculous. Passage of<br/>
bills like these could limit our kids&#39; choices. We have tried to discourage<br/>
our two from going into architecture (considering it an expensive hobby),<br/>
but there are plenty of other state licensed occupations that they might<br/>
choose to pursue?<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What it said was IF a high school diploma is required, it should be a real <br/>
one OR one equivalent.<br/>
<br/>
And a GED is equivalent.<br/>
