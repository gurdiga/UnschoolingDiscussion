You are right, it is silica.  But then I wasn&#39;t really &quot;listening&quot; and it sounded like silicone.  But thanks for more information that I ever wanted about the space shuttle.  ;&gt;)  And while I guess it sounded like it, I didn&#39;t mean that the entire shuttle was made from byrillium...I will be sure to tell my partner about all this interesting info.  Thanks<br/>

&gt; I think he probably said silica. That&#39;s what the heat tiles are made of.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re spun glass basically. (90% of the tile is air!) (The adhesive used<br/>
&gt; is maked of silicone.) (One site says the heat dissapates from them so<br/>
&gt; quickly that they can be touched *seconds* after being removed from a 2300<br/>
&gt; degree oven.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The shell of the shuttle is made of aluminum and then covered with tiles and<br/>
&gt; other insulation that keep it from getting above 350 degrees.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a more flexible blanket that&#39;s put over the top side of the shuttle<br/>
&gt; which is also made of silica by a different process that only needs to take<br/>
&gt; heat up to 700 degrees.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The tiles on the nose and wing tips are &quot;Reinforced Carbon-Carbon.&quot; (One of<br/>
&gt; the substances used in it is rayon cloth! There&#39;s more about the process at<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eng.iastate.edu/explorer/topics/spacecoat/RCC.htm">http://www.eng.iastate.edu/explorer/topics/spacecoat/RCC.htm</a> And down that<br/>
&gt; the bottom of that page are links to the other insulation substances on the<br/>
&gt; shuttle.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I found out beryllium is very light and used to make alloys that are both<br/>
&gt; light and strong so that makes it attractive for the space shuttle. Some<br/>
&gt; sites did mention beryllium is used in the shuttle, but when they got more<br/>
&gt; specific, the only parts mentioned as being made of it are: windshield<br/>
&gt; frame, brake discs, support beams, and other structural components of the<br/>
&gt; space shuttle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, the internet is amazing! :-) It would have take <br/>
&gt; *hours* to find out<br/>
&gt; just a portion of that stuff even 10 years ago.<br/>
