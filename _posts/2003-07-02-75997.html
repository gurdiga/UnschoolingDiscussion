<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445919632">&quot;Statistically, most of the really bad stuff happens between 4 and 6 <br/>
p.m. in the afternoon.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
EXACTLY!!<br/>
I never understood why my parents had the attitude that there was only trouble to get into after 11pm or so. Like we were not going to drink or do stupid stuff before that, HA!<br/>
I always say that more must happen during the daytime because more people are out and about, so more chances for crime. But try and tell that to a fearful parent.<br/>
Some of the most fun happens when the world is quietly sleeping and you can hang with your friends in that quiet and calm. There&#39;s nothing like getting some waffle sticks at Burger King at 4am after being up all night. :)<br/>

Tara and her friend just love the beach late at night. Or I should say early<br/>
in the morning. They like to go and throw down a blanket and just talk and<br/>
listen to the waves. It&#39;s so peaceful then. Tara says usually around 1:00 or<br/>
so they watch all the drunk people staggering the boardwalk making fools of<br/>
themselves. Then the commotion dies down and they relax. By the time they<br/>
come home, the nuts are long gone from even driving.<br/>
