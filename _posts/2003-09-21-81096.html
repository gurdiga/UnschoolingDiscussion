<br/>
First of all I&#39;m so happy to see a sizeable La Leche contingent on this<br/>
list! I think the groups philosophy (trusting your body to fulfill its<br/>
natural function, paying attention to your baby instead of the clock or what<br/>
society tells you is&quot;normal&quot;, loving guidance instead of punishment, people<br/>
before things, etc.) is very much in accord with unschooling.<br/>
I would strongly suggest attending meetings during pregnancy, especially if<br/>
you had any problems breastfeeding before or think you migyht be<br/>
uncomfortable nursing in public, are concerned about nutrition, sleeping<br/>
arrangements, etc. It is just such a confidence builder to be around other<br/>
moms and their gorgeous, healthy  breastfed kids, and know that you can do<br/>
it too!<br/>
 About nursing in public......I had my &quot;lightbulb&quot; moment on the Tokyo<br/>
subway when my son was about 4 months old (and yes nursing constantly! Some<br/>
babies indeed, are just like that and it does not mean you aren&#39;t producing<br/>
enough milk). I glanced around as he started fussing for the breast, and<br/>
noticed that the man next to me was reading a pornographic manga with lots<br/>
of booby pictures and more(very very common in Japan, they&#39;ll read them on<br/>
public transportation because they are ashamed to take them home and upset<br/>
their wives!) At that moment I just decided that if he could look at women&#39;s<br/>
bodies in a sexual context in a public place and no one around us batted an<br/>
eyelash,<br/>
I certainly had the right to feed my baby. Never looked back. I&#39;ve gotten a<br/>
few stares but no negative comments, Once when a dirty old man was staring<br/>
at me in a park I smiled and said loudly &quot;Wait your turn!&quot; and he was so<br/>
embarrassed he disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Much later I was in a restaurant and a woman had a baby who just cried and<br/>
cried while she got ready to nurse him. She had this big beach towel which<br/>
she fastened around herself with a clothes pin, and since it ws dark, hot,<br/>
and uncomfortable under there, the baby kept  crying and it took forever to<br/>
latch on. It was so much more conspicuous and disruptive to the other<br/>
patrons than if she had just lifted up her<br/>
shirt and continued eating her lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and Olga, my take on &quot;Where to look when a baby is breastfeeding&quot; is<br/>
whereever. If the mother is comfortable enough to nurse in front of you she<br/>
most likely won&#39;t mind if you happen to see a bit of boob.<br/>
