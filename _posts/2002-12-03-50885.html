<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959268478">I have 5 kids, 3 under 7, and I definitely get &quot;touched out&quot;.  What I try to<br/>
do, sometimes better than others, is to truly be in the moment with the kids<br/>
when I AM with them, really focused, really attending.  Then about 3 hours a<br/>
week (I teach karate and help with the teen drama group) I am completely<br/>
focused on what I am doing, on just me, as a separate entity from my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I found that if I do not take some time for myself that I begin to resent<br/>
the kids and that is most certainly not fair to them.  I work to make sure<br/>
that the kids enjoy themselves during the times that I&#39;m gone (a fun<br/>
babysitter that likes walks and crafts or game time with dh).  So far, so<br/>
good.  It also helps that my oldest (12) adores her younger siblings and<br/>
enjoys one-on-one time with them.  So when I&#39;m reading to Danny, she may be<br/>
painting toenails with Michelle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117363576">We had a neighbor who was twelve years older than Holly, and so... Seven <br/>
years older than Kirby.  She used to come over for $2 an hour and just be <br/>
there, play with the boys, or carry the baby around, and that helped lots.  <br/>
Helped me AND her, because she had younger sisters and if she hadn&#39;t been <br/>
doing it for money at my house, she&#39;d&#39;ve been doing it for free at her own, <br/>
up the street.  They were homeschooling too,  but not unschoolers.<br/>
