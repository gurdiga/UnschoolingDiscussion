would never ask such a thing. Just warn me as to where those slimy creatures <br/>
are and I will divert myself in the opposite direction. Although I have to <br/>
admit to gagging seriously when you mentioned turning them over. Yuck!!!<br/>

None the less though, you are awesome to compost. I wish I could stomach the <br/>
idea, because it&#39;s usage is so great. I have these major stomach issues, so <br/>
it doesn&#39;t take much to make me hurl.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, I&#39;ve heard that orange peels are no good, but that could be because <br/>
they take a long time to be eaten.  Melon rinds take a long time too, even <br/>
when you cut them small.  Same with asparagus ends.<br/>
<br/>
Coffee grinds are great.  Leftover cheerios are happy there.  Lettuce, melon <br/>
seeds, blueberries.  Small things go quicker.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what they like, I&#39;ve never heard any burping or anything!<br/>
