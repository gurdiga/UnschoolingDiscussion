<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341468282">On the other hand, parents WITH such difficult-to-be-around kids have a <br/>
social responsibility, to their friends and to strangers around them, <br/>
too, to not disrupt their lives unreasonably. <br/>
<br/>
***************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a difficult-to-be-around child, but I see that it&#39;s <br/>
about the same as anything we do which is non-mainstream.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things our family does that probably would irritate <br/>
someone if they were around us.   So is it my &quot;social responsibility&quot; <br/>
to not do anything around anybody else that might irritate them?  <br/>
<br/>
If I believe in extended breastfeeding, is it my social <br/>
responsibility to not breastfeed in public or around other people <br/>
because it might bother them?  No, my child needs to be fed when they <br/>
are hungry, and I am going to honor that need no matter where I am.  <br/>
I don&#39;t care if others are bothered.  <br/>
<br/>
If I believe in not immunizing my children, does that mean I should <br/>
keep them away from all other children because some parents may <br/>
believe mine will infect theirs?  No, I won&#39;t do that.  They are <br/>
misinformed, my child is actually more in danger of being infected <br/>
from theirs than they are from mine.  <br/>
<br/>
If I believe in unschooling, and parents object to my kids talking to <br/>
theirs because it might give their kids ideas about quitting school, <br/>
am I going to tell my kids they can&#39;t talk to the other ones if they <br/>
see them in the neighborhood?  No, my kids can talk to whoever they <br/>
want to.<br/>
<br/>
Because I don&#39;t teach my kids that drinking, cussing, dancing and sex <br/>
are wrong, some parents don&#39;t like their kids to be around mine, <br/>
because they might get bad &quot;ideas.&quot;  So, it is socially responsible <br/>
for me to make sure that my kids aren&#39;t around anyone that might be <br/>
offended by our beliefs?  No, that&#39;s not my responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people feel that our beliefs and way of life are disruptive <br/>
to theirs.  It&#39;s not my job to keep my kids away from them because <br/>
the way I am raising them makes somebody uncomfortable.  I live in an <br/>
area where kids are thought to be rude if they don&#39;t say yes sir and <br/>
no sir, and where you don&#39;t contradict an adult and you don&#39;t talk <br/>
back.  But I have taught my kids they should question everything.  <br/>
That makes some people uncomfortable, and they say we aren&#39;t teaching <br/>
our kids right.  Does that mean I should tell my kids that they have <br/>
to say yes sir and no sir when they are around these people?  No, <br/>
it&#39;s not our job to cater to other people&#39;s narrow beliefs or <br/>
misunderstanding of what we do.  And I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s the <br/>
responsibility of parents of difficult kids to apologize for their <br/>
behavior or to make sure they aren&#39;t disrupting anybody&#39;s lives.  <br/>
<br/>
If somebody is disrupting my life, I make up my mind to be <br/>
understanding, or I just leave.  I don&#39;t ask that person to change on <br/>
my account.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136024093">Although, it is evident that folks who have children with explosive tempers <br/>
DO understand &quot;how it works&quot; when a kid gets out of control.   It is also <br/>
obvious that some folks continue to think the child&#39;s behavior is a direct result <br/>
of how or how &quot;not&quot; the child has been parented.    <br/>
<br/>
In the situation with JP in the van.. getting frustrated over the game... and <br/>
he blamed mine and Anna&#39;s talking on his messing up.   If you read the post <br/>
carefully, you saw that I first tried to help him, talk him through it.. He <br/>
only became more enraged.  He felt my talking was the &quot;problem&#39;  continuing to <br/>
talk would only give him more fuel to become frustrated.  By being silent, he <br/>
could no longer &quot;blame&quot; his anger on our talking.   It worked.. although he did <br/>
chose something else to focus his anger on.. my driving.   And I did calmly <br/>
explain that I was driving as carefully as I could.. which irritated him because <br/>
I talked again.   But ultimately, he laid down on the back seat and started <br/>
sucking his thumb and calmed himself down.     <br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that other folks came forward to say that their children have <br/>
similar outrages.  When a child gets that frustrated and out of control, they <br/>
really can&#39;t be reasoned with rationally.  And they are sorry after thier rage <br/>
subsides and typically, they are loving, happy children.    Other folks shared <br/>
that they use basically the same tactics.. Waiting it out.. offering comfort, <br/>
safety, talking and accepting the child are all good suggestions.  <br/>
<br/>
I still did not see any specific examples of &quot;not tolerating&quot; or setting <br/>
personal boundaries for this kind of behavior.   Why is using strong language <br/>
considered stepping over some invisible line?   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407782718">I think I&#39;ve missed some of this thread, I haven&#39;t received any of my own posts in my inbox, so I&#39;ve probably missed others&#39;, so forgive me if I&#39;m not clear on this.<br/>
Strong language from him or from you? No reason, really for asking, I just got confused is all. (lol)<br/>
My now almost 13 year old &#39;raged&#39; and &#39;threw tantrums&#39; from 18 months of age until about a month into beginning homeschooling a year ago. He had been spanked, timed-out, ignored, reasoned with, medicated, belittled, punished, consequenced, isolated, restrained, removed from my care, placed in a secure facility and then in a series of foster homes, returned to my care--nothing had changed--counselled, threatened, grounded, bribed, you name it, we--or someone &quot;acting on our behalf&quot;--tried it. The *only* thing that changed anything was taking him out of school and taking him off of the medication, out of the counselling, and having him safe at home.<br/>
They don&#39;t always just grow out of it, and it&#39;s not always about the parenting, necessarily.<br/>
Anyone who saw me during one of his episodes between 1991 and 2002 would have sworn I was doing nothing to help him or to instruct him in the appropriate ways to express one&#39;s anger. They would not have known about the abuse counselling the whole family has endured, the play therapy, art therapy, talk therapy my son had had to sit through, the parenting classes I had gone to, the clinics, the drugs, the behaviour mod. school programs, the b.a. classes, etc, etc, etc. <br/>
It&#39;s incredibly easy NOT to see what a parent is doing to try to live with and even love their &#39;raging&#39; child.<br/>
As a bit of an aside, as it turns out, my son was not &#39;raging&#39;, he was panicking. These were anxiety attacks, these tantrums. School was a nightmare for him, social situations were a nightmare for him (birthday parties, fun? Not for him), and he would panic and didn&#39;t know how to get out of the situation in which he was &#39;trapped&#39;. So he freaked. And man, did he pay for that!<br/>

&quot;The sheeplike tendency of human society soon makes inroads on a child&#39;s unsophistications, and then popular education completes the dastardly work with its systematic formulas, and away goes the individual, hurtling through space into that hateful oblivion of mediocrity. We are pruned into stumps, one resembling another, without character or grace.&quot; --- NC Wyeth, father of Andrew Wyeth, Artist/Painter, who was home educated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have explosive children - one in particular. Its not my fault they&#39;re <br/>
explosive - although I could have beaten it out of them, I&#39;m sure, <br/>
through tough-love punishments.<br/>
<br/>
But - to say that it isn&#39;t parenting that MADE them that way, is not to <br/>
say that parenting isn&#39;t critical in how they eventually come to terms <br/>
with their own temperament and how they mature into, not just knowing <br/>
how to control their temper and behave in a socially functional way, <br/>
but learning how to use this gift for extremely strong emotion in the <br/>
service of humanity in their own unique ways.<br/>
<br/>
So - my discussion of parenting in regard to explosive children is <br/>
aimed in that direction, not in blaming the parents for it being <br/>
difficult to be around their kids.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, parents WITH such difficult-to-be-around kids have a <br/>
social responsibility, to their friends and to strangers around them, <br/>
too, to not disrupt their lives unreasonably. Where that line is drawn <br/>
depends totally on the situation and relationships between the people <br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
Teresa keeps saying that nobody is giving concrete ideas of how <br/>
boundaries can be set.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I said this, but I&#39;m having email trouble and maybe it never <br/>
went through.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to, I would use my position as the adult - my voice or even my <br/>
physical strength and control, the minimum necessary, to keep my child <br/>
from putting other people&#39;s safety in jeopardy. I&#39;d use my voice to <br/>
demand that he/she go into another room. I&#39;d use my understanding to <br/>
know what kind of voice and expression would work best with that child. <br/>
I&#39;d send other kids OUT of the room if that was an option. If not, I&#39;d <br/>
pick up a child who was flailing and hitting and even pin his her her <br/>
arms tightly to protect myself if I had to. If they wouldn&#39;t stop <br/>
screaming vulgarities and spewing nasty stuff at other people, I&#39;d do <br/>
the same - move them somewhere or move the others somewhere. But - I <br/>
would do all this calmly - this is MY child and I&#39;m on her side. I&#39;d <br/>
appreciate it if my husband did the same for me if I had a meltdown in <br/>
front of others - helped get me out of it somehow - if he recognized <br/>
that I  had completely lost control, I&#39;d want him to help me!! If we <br/>
were in the car and there was screaming and swearing at people and so <br/>
on - if it got to that point - I would certainly stop the car - that <br/>
level of rage would mean we would definitely not just &quot;carry on&quot; as if <br/>
things were okay. If we had to just sit and wait, I pull over near a <br/>
place where the other kids could get out of the car and play - on a <br/>
playground or something. I mean - there is no telling what the <br/>
situation would look like right then - hard to say what I&#39;d do when I <br/>
don&#39;t know the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
I know one thing - that the parent of these kids OFTEN has to sacrifice <br/>
doing what they want to do. Often has to let the other kids be with <br/>
other families in a restaurant while we sit in the car with the kid who <br/>
can&#39;t maintain control well enough to be in the restaurant. If it was <br/>
predictable, we wouldn&#39;t take them in the first place, of course.<br/>
<br/>
AND - there are those parents I&#39;ve known who have PARENTED their kids <br/>
into being disruptive, tantrum-throwing, inconsiderate and obnoxious. <br/>
So, yes, I do believe that this is not always temperament - that it IS, <br/>
in fact, sometimes simply the way the kid was parented that led to them <br/>
not getting past normal 2 or 3 year old behavior by the time they are <br/>
10 or older.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that anybody here is one way or the other (except for a <br/>
couple of you, whom I know really well and KNOW the great parenting <br/>
your kids have gotten - temperamental by nature or not).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s also a distinction between a child &#39;abusing&#39; someone and a <br/>
childhaving an uncontrollable rage. My kids fight and call each other <br/>
names sometimes and I deal with that in a completely different way to <br/>
how I deal with the rage. With true &#39;nastiness&#39; I step in immediately <br/>
and tell them that its not acceptable (I&#39;m not talking sibling bickering <br/>
but when it gets nasty). I aslo talk to them afterwards. With &#39;rage&#39; I <br/>
do leave the park/house or wherever I am cos I am embaressed and <br/>
stressed and afraid of bothering other people. When the child has <br/>
emerged from the other side we talk and on the whole the child is <br/>
actually more sorry for the &#39;rage&#39; than for being nasty to a sibling.<br/>
My mother advocates spanking for both cases. She says a child should be <br/>
broken and is unconcerned that the apparent good behaviour is through <br/>
fear. Despite this attitude and many beatings she managed to control the <br/>
every day behaviour of my brother and me but not our &#39;rages&#39; They are <br/>
generally as uncontrollable as depression or anorexia or autism. My <br/>
brother and I both left home at 16, the day we were legally able too.<br/>
My Unschooling and TCS philosophy doesn&#39;t allow me to take the <br/>
&#39;beatings&#39; path or to humiliate or shame the child in order to break <br/>
them however easy it would be and to be honest &#39;abusive&#39; behaviour is <br/>
rare. I can&#39;t recall a time when any of them said something nasty to me <br/>
out of nastiness or meaness. It is the uncontrollable rages the child <br/>
experiences where neither beatings nor TCS seem to help (not that I&#39;ve <br/>
tried beatings...). I also find myself helpless against the depression <br/>
that H is beginning to suffer, at the same age I developed it. My own <br/>
depression led to anorexia, self harm and attempted suicide and years of <br/>
obnoxius doctors and drug therapy.<br/>
<br/>
This problem with her friend which stemmed from somthing she couldn&#39;t <br/>
control is leading her deeper into depression yet people are treating <br/>
her like both are her fault and that she chooses to rage or be <br/>
depressed. Being a homeschooler in a way makes things worse. Generally <br/>
parents have to get on for the kids to be friends. If they were at <br/>
school then parents wouldn&#39;t even come into it, the girls would meet at <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m going to end my participation in this topic here. I can&#39;t <br/>
cope with the situation, am stressed beyond belief and think that I <br/>
should isolate my kids from all others.<br/>

But that&#39;s a loving, nurturing thing.<br/>
<br/>
A child spewing &quot;fucking bitch&quot; isn&#39;t doing a loving, nurturing thing.  <br/>
A parent ignoring that isn&#39;t being loving or nurturing either.<br/>
<br/>
A kid playing with a ball without breaking things isn&#39;t a offensive thing.  A <br/>
kid throwing a baseball purposely through windows or at sculptures or lamps <br/>
or dishes is not doing a loving, nurturing thing.<br/>
<br/>
If the principle is consideration for others, then you look at each situation <br/>
and see whether there&#39;s consideration.<br/>
<br/>
I nursed in public lots, but I wouldn&#39;t consciously nurse in front of a bunch <br/>
of older men who weren&#39;t used to it and were uncomfortable.  It would be <br/>
rude.  If they came to MY house, they&#39;d have to live with it, but if I went to an <br/>
Elk&#39;s meeting where I was the out of place visitor, I would adjust my actions <br/>
to their comfort and expectations.<br/>

<br/>
An unimmunized kid isn&#39;t getting into another person&#39;s space or disturbing <br/>
their peace.<br/>
Kirby had lots more shots than Holly, and they&#39;re both capable of being <br/>
courteous in other people&#39;s houses.  If I believe in not immunizing my children, <br/>
does that mean I should <br/>
keep them away from all other children because some parents may <br/>
believe mine will infect theirs?  No, I won&#39;t do that.  They are <br/>
misinformed, my child is actually more in danger of being infected <br/>
from theirs than they are from mine.  It&#39;s a whole different topic.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I believe in unschooling, and parents object to my kids talking to <br/>
theirs because it might give their kids ideas about quitting school, <br/>
am I going to tell my kids they can&#39;t talk to the other ones if they <br/>
see them in the neighborhood?  No, my kids can talk to whoever they <br/>
want to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can they say whatever they want to without regard to the personal or social <br/>
consequences?   I talk about unschooling most of the time.  I don&#39;t when I&#39;m <br/>
with someone I KNOW has to work, who has relatives (especially stepchildren) <br/>
they can&#39;t even begin to consider homeschooing, let alone unschooling.   If they <br/>
want information it&#39;s there.  If they ask about my kids, I tell them stories.  <br/>
But even my kids know when their freedom isn&#39;t the most polite topic of <br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Because I don&#39;t teach my kids that drinking, cussing, dancing and sex <br/>
are wrong, some parents don&#39;t like their kids to be around mine, <br/>
because they might get bad &quot;ideas.&quot;  So, it is socially responsible <br/>
for me to make sure that my kids aren&#39;t around anyone that might be <br/>
offended by our beliefs?  No, that&#39;s not my responsibility.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do your kids cuss and have sex indiscriminately?<br/>
I doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
Would your kids know that a poker game is a better place to utter &quot;son of a <br/>
bitch&quot; than a funeral might be?<br/>
I bet they do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Lots of people feel that our beliefs and way of life are disruptive <br/>
to theirs.  It&#39;s not my job to keep my kids away from them because <br/>
the way I am raising them makes somebody uncomfortable. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends where the people are.  Are they in their own home?<br/>
<br/>
In our house, if one of my kids is walking around singing songs from the <br/>
South Park movie, nobody in the family cares.  If we have company, they&#39;re not <br/>
likely to do it.  If they&#39;re visiting Christian friends, they definitely won&#39;t <br/>
burst into &quot;Step one, &#39;stead of ass say buns, like kiss my buns or you&#39;re a buns <br/>
hole.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sin.<br/>
I do think there are times and places, and if a child is told that he can say <br/>
fuck anywhere he wants to and to anyone he wants, that&#39;s a great disservice, <br/>
and when he&#39;s grown he could have legal problems with it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s the <br/>
responsibility of parents of difficult kids to apologize for their <br/>
behavior or to make sure they aren&#39;t disrupting anybody&#39;s lives.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We had unschooling get-togethers for years.  Often they were at our house.  <br/>
One family could (and a couple did) keep others from returning to the group.  <br/>
That wasn&#39;t cool for their kids or mine, or the other families who no longer <br/>
felt comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
In a park, I could move away from them.  When it was my house, I could ask <br/>
them to leave or let them stay and disturb the peace of others who were there.  <br/>
Usually I just dealt directly with the child and bypassed the mom if the mom <br/>
wasn&#39;t interested in keeping the peace of others.  It was my house, it was my <br/>
peace to keep.<br/>

Not other people.  Although her daughter was there and he was blaming their <br/>

were suggesting that no one should have to put up with this not even her and <br/>
she should set personal boundaries.  Not boundaries for him or between him and <br/>

I do not recall reading your post before.. I could have missed it, or maybe <br/>
Yahoo ate it.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with everything you said.  And,  we have stopped our car many times.. <br/>
 Sometimes just pulling off the road for a minute is enough.. and yes, <br/>
sometimes it takes several minutes.. And occasionally, a temper will calm down after <br/>
we stop only to flare back up a few miles down the road.  Gosh, I have taken <br/>
trips that should have taken 30 minutes turn into an hour and half.    In the <br/>
case with JP, Anna and I.  I was on a long stretch of Interstate.   He was not <br/>
inhibiting my driving, he was not hitting Anna or me.. he was just screaming <br/>
and cussing, and kicking my seat occasionally.   In this instance, driving <br/>
along for 20 minutes had the same effect as stopping for 20 minutes.  As well as <br/>
I can recall, I don&#39;t remember seeing an exit I could have stopped at.. But, I <br/>
also know that I did not feel stopping was necessary.  Now, if Ethan had been <br/>
in the van with us. I would have HAD to stopped.   I could not drive safely <br/>
because they would have been bouncing off of each other and need to be <br/>
seperated til JP calmed down.     Oh. Dh just honked the horn for me. .. we are going <br/>
over to my mil&#39;s..  I &#39;ll catch up on email later<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081830604">I have to say that one thing sticks out at me with this discussion of <br/>
screaming/cussing/kicking fits in cars, and that is: How safe is <br/>
this? The last few times I&#39;ve been on the interstate, I&#39;ve had the <br/>
unhappy luck to see the results of fatal accidents involving <br/>
minivans, and sometimes I wonder &quot;what was happening in that car at <br/>
the time?&quot; Perhaps a driver distracted by fighting siblings or <br/>
screaming child. I know how distracting it can be, and only for a <br/>
second or two, but those seconds count. <br/>
<br/>
I personally have a low noise threshold and low tolerance for <br/>
screaming. If my kids scream in the car, they know without a doubt <br/>
that the car will be pulling over until the screaming has stopped. I <br/>
remind them that my first job is to love them, and my second job is <br/>
to keep them safe. It&#39;s not safe to drive while someone is screaming, <br/>
and I absolutely wouldn&#39;t drive with the rage/kicking/screaming <br/>
described here, just for the safety of myself, my children, and the <br/>
other people on the road. I am also fine with children <br/>
screaming/getting out rage in appropriate ways that do not endanger <br/>
our health and safety. It&#39;s fine to scream outside the car, or to <br/>
scream inside the car (sometimes I will get out, &#39;cuz I just can&#39;t <br/>
stand it). Fortunately, this is an extremely infrequent occurrence. I <br/>
don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because my kids outgrew tantrums at a reasonably <br/>
young age, or because they know we aren&#39;t getting anywhere if we have <br/>
to sit by the side of the road.<br/>

amazingly - when we see that the parents are working to help the child <br/>

I haven&#39;t had good luck with other parents talking to my children under <br/>

My mother used to have a bamboo cane at the ready for whenever she felt <br/>

---actually, she did and it involved us and the cane.<br/>
<br/>
I hear your pain and I feel like, with anything else, what we are <br/>
talking about here is establishing a practice, a daily practice of <br/>
where you want to be with not just yourself but the world around you. <br/>
There is a lot of your past there that needs to be worked on before you <br/>
can effectively cope with your child&#39;s rages. Actually, if you think <br/>
about it, having kids puts us at a crossroads --we either repeat <br/>
history (our pasts with all its pain) or we live as who we want to be <br/>
in the now. So your plight is just a glimpse of what we have to deal <br/>
with as parents.<br/>
<br/>
There are several practices that have helped me throughout the years <br/>
and I keep coming back to four: Yoga, the Tao Te Ching,  Landmark <br/>
Education&#39;s &#39;Curriculum for Leaving&#39; (which is heavily into cognitive <br/>
psychotherapy) and that little ditty that I like even if I have <br/>
renounced all religions: Do unto other&#39;s what you would want others to <br/>
do unto you. This last one, is soooo simple and it&#39;s in its simplicity <br/>

that one can really appreciate its brilliance.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Recently I received the Newsletter from my old High School, a Church of<br/>
England Girl&#39;s school. The School Chaplain has an article in each<br/>
newsletter and in this issue she dealt with the Golden Rule. Her<br/>
research revealed that Jesus in the New Testament is the only religious<br/>
or spiritual leader to express it just this way as above. All the other<br/>
religious traditions express it thus: Do NOT do unto others what you<br/>
would NOT like to be done to you. The Chaplain unsurprisingly preferred<br/>
the Christian interpretation. However I am not so sure.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My personal problem with the Golden Rule is that it would set me up as<br/>
the arbiter of what other people want - and expects me to be a mind<br/>
reader to boot. Suppose that I would want someone to come up and hug me<br/>
when I am upset, but the other person desperately prefers to be left in<br/>
solitude to think, cry or perhaps pray when they are bothered by<br/>
something. My responding to them with what I would want is likely to<br/>
create even more misunderstanding. I wish I could have the expectation<br/>
that everyone could simply say clearly, &quot;I need thus and such right now<br/>
from you&quot;, without rancour. However I don&#39;t think that is likely even if<br/>
it is desirable. Another saying springs to mind. &quot;The Road to Hell is<br/>
Paved With Good Intentions&quot;. I think it could be better to ask other<br/>
people what they need from me. Gee I Hope I remember to implement that<br/>
sound notion here at home!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also prefer the Witch&#39;s Rede as mentioned by another Pagan. &quot;An it<br/>
Harm None, Do What You Will&quot;. It was my mother who actually pointed out<br/>
to me that the &quot;None&quot; should also include myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50269974">Shonen Jump is a cool mag!   Tons of stories and pictures,  its huge!<br/>
<br/>
We picked one up on our way down to the conference and my dd really liked it.  She loves all the anime stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I watched a Rurouni Kenshin movie with her a few months ago.   The politics and government history in it was really interesting.   We are sad now though,  Cartoon Network is hardly showing the series.<br/>
<br/>
Watching these shows have sparked interests in Japan, all Asian countries,  martial arts, (she started Tai-Kwon-Do a few months ago) and she also wants to try and learn Japanese now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just went to the site that Joyce posted,  if you subscribe now, you get a 13th issue free.<br/>

  If your kids haven&#39;t already discovered it, Shonen Jump, which claims to be<br/>
  &quot;The Worlds Most Popular Manga&quot; is available in America now and it&#39;s lots of<br/>
  reading for a little. (325 black and white pages (and a handful of color)<br/>
  for $5 every month. But if you subscribe it&#39;s only $2.50 an issue.) Each<br/>
  issue has 3 or 4 issues of 7 different titles. Shonen Jump is where many<br/>
  popular anime got started: Dragonball Z, Yu-Gi-Oh, Rurouni Kenshin, YuYu<br/>
  Hakusho.<br/>
<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shonenjump.com/">http://www.shonenjump.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
  I suspect what the US is getting is several years behind what the magazine<br/>
  has in Japan but my guess is that like in Japan, the magazine is a cheap way<br/>
  for kids to try out a lot of different titles before they invest in the more<br/>
  expensive book versions that Viz is also releasing.<br/>

is going to turn 16 this week - and she is still a rather &quot;smoldering&quot; <br/>

meltdowns there - they find her to be delightful and especially easy to <br/>
work with - follows directions cheerfully, is solution-oriented when <br/>
there is a problem, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But - people who knew her when she was younger and had meltdowns in <br/>
public, still act like they&#39;re scared of her.<br/>
<br/>
She still melts down at home over minor incidents - when she&#39;s tired or <br/>
stressed from too much activity/people interaction. But - she gets <br/>
angry, her face darkents, she glares at people, says usually one or two <br/>
quick complaints - (I&#39;m SO TIRED OF THIS - or whatever) and goes off in <br/>
her room and usually falls asleep.<br/>

This is great. Jacob (7yrs) my hot tempered one is trying really hard to<br/>

heard him saying to his brother a couple of days ago, &quot;Breathe, just breathe<br/>
and walk away.&quot; It was so cool.<br/>

Reading all these great posts have helped me heaps. We have had a Knights &<br/>
Castles activities book from the library and yesterday we read about the<br/>
code of chivalry. We decided to make our own code of honour to help keep the<br/>
peace. We have included a few ideas from the thread. The boys especially<br/>
like the idea of a code word when they need instant help. Our code word is<br/>

Breastfeeding is reasonable in every place I can think of.  Where isn&#39;t <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t have a difficult-to-be-around child, but I see that it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;about the same as anything we do which is non-mainstream.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are lots of things our family does that probably would irritate <br/>
&gt;someone if they were around us.   So is it my &quot;social responsibility&quot; <br/>
&gt;to not do anything around anybody else that might irritate them?  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s your responsibility to avoid doing irritating things &quot;in-your-face&quot; <br/>
to people you should know it will annoy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If I believe in extended breastfeeding, is it my social <br/>
&gt;responsibility to not breastfeed in public or around other people <br/>
&gt;because it might bother them?  No, my child needs to be fed when they <br/>
&gt;are hungry, and I am going to honor that need no matter where I am.  <br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t care if others are bothered.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s rude to flop it out in public--breastfeeding discretely is pretty <br/>
reasonable most places. Even so, there are times and places that most <br/>
sensitive people could predict it would be best avoided if possible.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If I believe in not immunizing my children, does that mean I should <br/>
&gt;keep them away from all other children because some parents may <br/>
&gt;believe mine will infect theirs?  No, I won&#39;t do that.  They are <br/>
&gt;misinformed, my child is actually more in danger of being infected <br/>
&gt;from theirs than they are from mine.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t send them out in t-shirts that advertise their immunity <br/>
status. The point is not that you should live your life for others, just <br/>
that discretion is often a good plan.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If I believe in unschooling, and parents object to my kids talking to <br/>
&gt;theirs because it might give their kids ideas about quitting school, <br/>
&gt;am I going to tell my kids they can&#39;t talk to the other ones if they <br/>
&gt;see them in the neighborhood?  No, my kids can talk to whoever they <br/>
&gt;want to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re not talking about *can* but should. If your kids have consistently <br/>
had a problem bringing up unschooling with certain friends, they might <br/>
want to learn to talk about other things instead. It&#39;s about tact, not <br/>
rubbing people&#39;s noses in things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Because I don&#39;t teach my kids that drinking, cussing, dancing and sex <br/>
&gt;are wrong, some parents don&#39;t like their kids to be around mine, <br/>
&gt;because they might get bad &quot;ideas.&quot;  So, it is socially responsible <br/>
&gt;for me to make sure that my kids aren&#39;t around anyone that might be <br/>
&gt;offended by our beliefs?  No, that&#39;s not my responsibility.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But it *is* your responsibility to let your kids know that some people <br/>
are offended by those things, and that by doing those things around <br/>
certain people/groups, they may limit their options.<br/>
<br/>
We may not agree, but I do think it&#39;s my responsibility as a mom to <br/>
model socially responsible behavior, including removing my child from a <br/>
situation where they&#39;re screaming or hitting others. I want my kids to <br/>
have the option to hang around others, not to be excluded from groups <br/>
because they feel they have a &quot;right&quot; to cuss where it&#39;s not OK or keep <br/>
doing things others find objectionable.<br/>
