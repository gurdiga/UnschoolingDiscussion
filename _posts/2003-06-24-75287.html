&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t even know how to get a midwife plus I&#39;ve heard horror stories <br/>
about forced caesareans (I want a VBAC) and forced vaccinations and circumcision. <br/>
I&#39;m tempted to fly home where its all familiar! &gt;&gt;<br/>

My American friend just had a baby in London (having had two here before) and <br/>
was WAY happy with things there, compared to here.<br/>

I have found that UK medicine isn&#39;t as &#39;nanny-like&#39; as here. With Rhodri I didn&#39;t see a Doc until I was 8 months along. He just sighed but my family doc here says I must an obstetrician (I&#39;ve never seen one of them. Back home they are for high-risk pregnancies only) and go reguarly etc etc plus the chances of me being *allowed* a vaginal birth after 3 C-sections is remore. *Allowed*???<br/>
<br/>
Grrrrrrrr<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not saying this makes the practice right, but -- though maybe it&#39;s<br/>
becoming less true with all the immigrants moving to England -- England is a<br/>
more uniform society. The common wisdom you share and how you go about<br/>
passing it on doesn&#39;t encompass as many styles. And if some new information<br/>
comes out, it will be harder for someone to not hear it because no one can<br/>
move that far away in England from someone who knows the truth.<br/>
<br/>
But not so in America. We can easily escape new wisdom. America is *vast*.<br/>
Our common wisdom is pretty spotty. And we don&#39;t have a common method of<br/>
passing anything on. Probably because we&#39;ve had so many cultures mingling so<br/>
we&#39;ve sort of devolved to a set of family practices that will offend the<br/>
fewest people. Which leaves us with not much of anything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting in Britain it&#39;s far rarer for a doctor to encounter someone who<br/>
is totally clueless about what to do during pregnancy. But I bet that&#39;s not<br/>
so in America. Doctors here, because of lawsuits, are kind of backed into a<br/>
corner of protecting everyone from the stupidity of far too many.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-268621232">I highly recommend a list right here on yahoo called empoweredchildbirth.   Most on the list do unassisted homebirths I believe but they are very knowledgeable and are respectful if you decide have a midwife or even give birth in a hospital (not always the case on some lists I&#39;ve heard).  I&#39;m almost sure I remember a few members from your area of the states too.   <br/>
 <br/>
Congratulations!<br/>

<br/>
And in England they don&#39;t jump to the most expensive option very easily <br/>
because of government health.  So for situations in which the mom WANTS <br/>
simple/natural/non-invasive, England&#39;s system is an advantage.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Got to chip in here - I found  UK system VERY nanny-like. Was ordered about<br/>
by an OB/GYN and lectured for being &quot;so stupid&quot; as to fall pregnant with #4<br/>
after having 3 C-Sections. Was told &quot;NO WAY&quot; to even trying for a normal<br/>
delivery and wouldn&#39;t even consider epidural anaesthetic. I wasn&#39;t &quot;Allowed&quot;<br/>
a say.......<br/>
Midwife was the same, ditto GP and second opinion I sought. No-one was<br/>
prepared to risk delivering vaginally after so many sections - they even<br/>
threatened me with the Mental Health Act!!!! ( where I could be &quot;sectioned&quot;<br/>
for endangering my life and forced to accept treatment and held in hospital<br/>
for up to 6 months pending psychiatric review)<br/>
<br/>
So I guess poor treatment can happen anywhere :(<br/>
