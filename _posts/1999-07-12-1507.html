<h4>下川　誉志彦</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-878965991">No one understood why I was so reluctant to attend grandmother-in-law&#39;s <br/>
funeral here.  Everyone (even the children - though the children are <br/>
becoming less and less welcome) sits around watching the body burn, and <br/>
then pass the bones around using long chopsticks.  Sorry - I barf at <br/>
the sight of roadkill, and can not eat fish with the head still on.  <br/>
Just the thought of watching a body burn, and then toughing it - even <br/>
with a chopstick - is just too much.  But it&#39;s just normal culture <br/>
here.  When one of my friends died (she was an older lady), I was kind <br/>
of sad.  I mean, I was grateful her suffering had ended (she had <br/>
Parkinson&#39;s as well as some other problems), but certainly I&#39;ll miss <br/>
her.  But others who were even better friends with her than I just <br/>
shrugged it off - it was just her time.  Then we get into religion - <br/>
which I will not get into on this list.  But just the different view of <br/>
death, I guess I wanted to share.<br/>
