<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501877200">He said &quot;Holly, I like your haircut.  Most girls your age wouldn&#39;t be brave<br/>
enough to have their hair that short.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly smiled and shrugged and was friendly, and I said, &quot;She&#39;s not in<br/>
school. That helps.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago my daughter cut her long blonde hair short also (not<br/>
as short as Holly&#39;s, but short like pixie or Peter Pan).  She is 10 and<br/>
often mistaken for a (cute) boy.  She smiles and says I just cut my hair or<br/>
I&#39;m a girl. She has no problem with it at all, although she has decided she<br/>
will probably grow it back.  I have had many folk say how brave she is<br/>
(myself included as I have long hair also and am much to attached to<br/>
it/afraid to lose it).  I have found it interesting though how she doesn&#39;t<br/>
really care what people think, or that they even mistake her for a boy!<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday we were in a fancy toystore, little place, one room, and Holly was <br/>
buying something for a birthday gift.    The owner, a man in his 60&#39;s, said <br/>
&quot;Are you ready, buddy?&quot; and dealt with all her check out business.  I had walked <br/>
over to the music section, to keep from snickering, and when we were leaving, <br/>
Holly said not only did he not know she was a girl, but he said two other <br/>
things he would only say to a boy, ending with &quot;Thank you, young man!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
WHY?<br/>
That&#39;s what I don&#39;t get.  What&#39;s the point of treating a male customer <br/>
differently from a female character?<br/>
<br/>
My dad used to complain in the 60&#39;s that with boys wearing long hair and <br/>
girls wearing jeans and boots, he couldn&#39;t tell is someone walking on the street <br/>
was male or female.  I asked him why he cared?  He said it mattered in how you <br/>
treated them.  I suggested he could treat them the same way.   But he was <br/>
raised to shake hands with a man, to give a female the right of way on the <br/>
sidewalk and open doors for her, etc., and his very everyday behavior needed him to <br/>
know male from female.<br/>
<br/>
Mine doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s a behavior change at least in some parts of the population in two <br/>
generations.  It&#39;s foreign to Holly, it was common to my dad, and I see both <br/>
sides.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college in the 70&#39;s the question of who opens doors was BIG.  <br/>
Some women were used to just standing there knowing a male person would open <br/>
the door for her.  Some women started being vocally insulting if males opened <br/>
doors for them.   Lots of people were advocating anyone opening the door for <br/>
anyone else who was carrying something, seemed frail or small or old.   Some <br/>
older men, though, would be insulted if a big strong college girl opened a door <br/>
for him.   I remember a long series of letters in the campus newspaper about the <br/>
possibility of changing traditional etiquette, and how to act.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, it seems to have settled around here to whoever gets there first <br/>
opens the door but goes in and holds it for the next few people if they&#39;re near <br/>
enough.   The door-holding is relinquished to the next &quot;head of party&quot; or <br/>
strongest-fastest kid of a group, or  a gentlemanly looking man who seems eager to <br/>
take over door-holding.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty case-by-case, but I also live where strangers do tend to make eye <br/>
contact and to greet each other.<br/>
<br/>
At UPS, people with packages get the door held by anyone who&#39;s near.<br/>
<br/>
Is that common everywhere?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My boys are often mistaken as girls.  They are treated more tenderly, I <br/>
think, sometimes.  People treat them as sweet, caring and kind.  They are all of <br/>
those things but by just meeting them in a store or on the street you might not <br/>
see it as you would if you had a chance to talk with them.  Also my boys can <br/>
go in either restroom without a second look.  And at the age of 9, my oldest is <br/>
at a stage where sometimes he wants to go in the men&#39;s room, but if it is a <br/>
crowded place he wants to go in the ladies room with me, I feel more <br/>
comfortable with that as well, and no one takes a second look.  <br/>
<br/>
My boys are used to being called girls.  They just correct the person and <br/>
usually explain that it isn&#39;t the first time someone has made that mistake.<br/>
<br/>
There have been two times, both in restaurants, where the waitress, has said <br/>
girls and the boys have corrected them.  Then she said &quot;oh...we&#39;re boys today <br/>
are we.&quot;  The boys just looked at them like they were crazy.  <br/>
<br/>
Once a waiter called the boys as girls and the boys corrected him.  He looked <br/>
at me and asked if they were really boys.  I said yes...they would know.  He <br/>
then looked at a friend who was with us and asked her if it was right.  She <br/>
answered that the mother should know if they are boys or not.  We all laughed.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when my oldest was about 6 and some kid in the grocery store made <br/>
a comment about if Dallen was a boy or a girl and Dallen said boy and the boy <br/>
laughed at Dallen.  Dallen was hurt and of course I was hurt that my son was <br/>
hurt.  Dallen then told me he wanted his hair cut.  We talked.  We looked <br/>
around and I pointed out all the men who had long hair.  We talked about what he <br/>
liked and why he wanted it cut etc.  I told him to think about it and if he <br/>
still wanted it cut I would do it for him.  He thought for a few days then told me <br/>
he really wanted it long and was going to keep it that way.  I was proud of <br/>
him but totally understand what it is like to be picked on. It has never <br/>
happened again. <br/>
<br/>
Enough for me for one day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister was in town from New York over Christmas, as she is every year.  We <br/>
went to a shop the day after to catch a sale and get gifts for people we <br/>
didn&#39;t&#39; see before the holiday.  I had a lot more stuff that she did, getting a <br/>
head start on next year&#39;s Christmas list.  She waited outside as they rang me up <br/>
and hunted for shipping boxes and such.  When I came out, I felt a need to <br/>
apologize for the delay, as she had an impatient look on her face.  She said she <br/>
had forgotten about the chitchat factor.  Her 10 year old son said all he <br/>
ever gets asked in the store is if he wants to buy a lottery ticket.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, it&#39;s probably not everywhere.  But in suburban Chicago, and even in <br/>
the city when I lived there, people tend to greet each other and treat each <br/>
other nicely.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Holly&#39;s hair and treating male and female customer&#39;s differently, I <br/>
can completely relate!  My five year old boy tends to wear his hair long -- <br/>
he&#39;s mistaken for a girl a lot, even now that it&#39;s shorter.  I think I&#39;ve told <br/>
the story here before about how a woman commented on my beautiful girls at the <br/>
grocery store and he proudly said &quot;Yes, but I have a penis!&quot;  It doesn&#39;t&#39; <br/>
really bother him, but he doesn&#39;t&#39; get it either.  Everyone makes a fuss over him <br/>
at ballet/tap class because he&#39;s the only boy.  He just loves to dance and <br/>
couldn&#39;t care less about the distinction!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215990255">My big boys both have long hair.  The 2.5 year olds is just a little too<br/>
short to go behind his ear and the almost 8 year old has hair most of the<br/>
way down his back.  It&#39;s gorgeous.<br/>
<br/>
The big one gets the &quot;girl&quot; stuff all the time.  Kids seem to take a while<br/>
to shift gears and call him &quot;her&quot; for a while, but the don&#39;t seem to care<br/>
one way or the other.  Grown ups seem a little embarassed or confused.  I<br/>
just say, &quot;His dad wears his hair long, too.&quot; and they seem to get it.  I<br/>
did have one older man say, &quot;But James is a boy&#39;s name.&quot;  Poor James just<br/>
nodded and waited for him to get it.  He didn&#39;t, I had to say something!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m considering getting both of them T-shirts that read &quot;Long Haired Hippie<br/>
Freak in training!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People seem to think that&#39;s funny.  -smile-<br/>
<br/>
As for the door thing, it seems to be getting to what Sandra said--people<br/>
hold it if they get there first or if you are clearly in need of help.<br/>
People will help me when I have the stroller.  And they are charmed when the<br/>
2 year old does it.  (Hell, so am I!)<br/>
<br/>
I never got the boy thing when my hair was supper short.  But it was after<br/>
puberty and the boobs were a dead give away!  -smirk-<br/>

In Boston it&#39;s iffy. Probably mostly depend on how rushed they are and how<br/>
