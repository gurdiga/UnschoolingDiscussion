Great to hear that! I&#39;d heard that there were unschoolers in Louisville! <br/>
Are there? (I mean enough to have a group--I can *see* that there are <br/>
*some!) We were hoping to find some. We&#39;re in Lexington, and would find <br/>
it extremely worthwhile to drive to Louisville to meet people.<br/>

I wish I could tell you more about unschoolers in Kentucky.  I personally have not met<br/>
anyone else in my area.  The groups that I have tried to participate in are either<br/>
religious or &quot;home&quot; school related.  I haven&#39;t met anyone on this list from Kentucky<br/>
either.  Until now.  Again, I wish I could tell you more.<br/>
