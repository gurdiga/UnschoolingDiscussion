I grew up in that area.   If you want to go to Chicago to see the fabulous<br/>
museums and all that, great.  But just for routing past it, I wouldn&#39;t get<br/>
anywhere NEAR the city if I had any other way to go around it.  Traffic is<br/>
awful unless you&#39;re passing through in the dead of the night.  And even then<br/>
it can be snarled with construction!<br/>
