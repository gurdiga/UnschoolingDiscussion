Did you know the trail of the comet we passed through last night was left <br/>
there in 1866?<br/>

My hubby and I were out at 2:00 a.m. We saw nothing. There were lots of <br/>
stars but also lots of clouds at times.  My friend went out at 4:00 and <br/>
caught a good show. We were just way too tired. It wasn&#39;t a total waste. My <br/>
honey and I both snuggled in my 29 year old daisy sleeping bag under the <br/>
stars and clouds on a 60 something degree night was heaven!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557576255">We saw the show last night!<br/>
I set the alarm for 3:15 a.m. and woke up at 3:12 a.m. to turn the alarm<br/>
off. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Then dh & I woke up Ben and Jon (who are 11 & 9) and we all went outside.<br/>
We spread a blanket down on the grass to lay on and snuggled up under<br/>
blankets.<br/>
I was worried that we wouldn&#39;t get much of a show because of light pollution<br/>
(we live in Phoenix, AZ) but we actually saw a lot of action! It was very<br/>
cool.<br/>
If anyone has ever had a peripheral vision eye test at an eye doctor,<br/>
watching for the meteors reminded me of that test!<br/>
A great experience that we&#39;ll always remember.<br/>
I&#39;m also so glad we&#39;re free as homeschoolers/unschoolers to do cool things<br/>
like this that most school kids probably couldn&#39;t do.<br/>

am really fed up with this, every interesting astronomical event and it&#39;s <br/>
flipping cloudy! :(  The next big show from the leonids should be 2034, I&#39;ll <br/>

 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re here every year, but just not as spectacular as some years.  I don&#39;t <br/>
even consider myself an amateur astronomer, but I like &quot;events&quot; like meteor <br/>
showers.  So, what I know about the Leonid may be wrong in some way.  The <br/>
Leonids are a result of the Earth passing through the dust trail of a comet <br/>
(something T...-Tuttle, I think).  The comet circles the Sun every 30 years, <br/>
but the Earth passes through the dust trails every year.  So the one we&#39;re <br/>
passing through this time was left by the comet on  its pass by the Sun in <br/>
1866.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, I think, was supposed to be the peak for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reminded about a book by Mary Chapin Carpenter, called &quot;Halley Comes to <br/>
Jackson&quot;, about a grandmother remembering when she saw Halley&#39;s Comet the <br/>
first time, and it coming back again in what?  1995 or something?  I remember <br/>
it.  There&#39;s also a song and an audiotape attached to the book.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707767666">Well if you still lived in Arkansas you would have see them. For once it was clear as a bell. Saw a few at 11:00but the real show was from about 3:30 am 4:45 am. &quot;OMG Julie&quot; your thinking &quot;you actually got up before the sun?!!!!&quot; For once I did and it was worth it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93252285">We had such a good time with this.  We have friends who are really into<br/>
astronomy.  They invited about 30 homeschoolers over to camp out in their<br/>
back yard.  They had a couple of big telescopes set up and had lots of<br/>
information from NASA.  Kids were free to join in or not (mostly, anyway,<br/>
some parents wanted to make sure their kids LEARNED something).  We froze to<br/>
death trying to get some sleep and then got up at 4:00 for hot chocolate and<br/>
french toast.  We watched the wonderful meteors with little Marsie snuggled<br/>
in a sleeping bag in my lap.  Hearing her &quot;oooh&quot; and &quot;aaah&quot; made freezing<br/>
definitely worth it.<br/>
