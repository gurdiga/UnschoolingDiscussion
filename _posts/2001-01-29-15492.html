<div id="ygrps-yiv-966094537">Thanks so much for the info!  Lynda, your friend hit on one thing I&#39;m noticing the more I research - I&#39;m getting a strong feeling of exactly what she said - lots of fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers.  I&#39;ve actually run into that here in NJ - doesn&#39;t seem to be any &quot;formally&quot; organized groups that aren&#39;t also religious.  It&#39;s gotten old fast.  Anyway, pls thank your friend and I think I will contact her!  Ann</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937672762">I wish you weren&#39;t leaving NJ Ann!  I have also had the same problem and am <br/>
still looking for a group, although I think that we will end up being loners <br/>
in the end.<br/>

&gt;Thanks so much for the info!  Lynda, your friend hit on one thing I&#39;m <br/>
