<div id="ygrps-yiv-891912482">&lt;&lt; The list has steadily been growing since Sandra and Joyce and I <br/>
took over ownership and we&#39;re up to over 1700 people &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Typo or mixed up with another group.<br/>
We have 1272  So there&#39;s a 7, that&#39;s true. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s enough to have good discussions, either way, definitely.<br/>
<br/>
And this is an embarrassment for New Mexico.  In the words of a homeschooling <br/>
mom local to me:<br/>
===================<br/>
They just said the NM 4th graders are in 50th place in the US with their<br/>
<br/>
math scores. They showed the number 50 very large on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They tied for 50th with Mississippi........<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it any wonder!?!?!?!!?!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think this is so damn funny but sad.... not the scores, the 50th<br/>
<br/>
statement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OMG!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mel<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
I can see tying for 49th... <br/>
But HOW can we tie for 50th?  (Maybe Puerto Rico scored better and they&#39;re in <br/>
there...)<br/>

conviction to homeschool for this very reason! Though at that time <br/>
(1999-2001) I believe NM was ranked 47, still tying with Missippi or <br/>
Kentucky or some such state.<br/>
<br/>
I loved Albuquerque, though, and would have stayed if things had worked out <br/>
that way. I still miss Taco Sal&#39;s chili rellenos!<br/>

<br/>
For those not in the know, taco Sal was a hole in the wall New Mexican <br/>
food place that was just to die for....<br/>
<br/>
I hear they aren&#39;t so good now... they changed owners or something.<br/>
