<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939453945">Hello, all! I just joined the group yesterday, and thought I&#39;d introduce myself. <br/>
I&#39;m Raine, wife to J for 12 years, homeschool mom to Alex, age 12, and Ashlyn, age 10. We live in Bakersfield, CA. <br/>
We&#39;ve homeschooled the past 7 years, not real strict, but still with some text/work books and such. Every once in a while I come back to an unschooling website, but I think I&#39;ve been too uptight and perfectionistic to take the plunge, up to this point. <br/>
I joined the group to get workable ideas on how to integrate some, or all, of the child-led approach with my kids. The thought has struck me that... I&#39;m losing time with them. I want the last 6-10 years to be something that really builds them as people, before they step out into the world. I&#39;m tired of focusing on their brains. They&#39;re both smart, they can pick up anything they need to know with little effort, when they need to know it. <br/>
From the e-mail I&#39;ve read already, this is the place for me!! <br/>
Shalom,<br/>
Raine<br/>

People are more than their brains - funny how an institution doesn&#39;t recognize that.  (Also medicine???)  I think you&#39;ll find that it can exceed anything you forsaw as a possible result.  I have.  They are REALLY neat PEOPLE!  Even at 2 minutes old, I found with #4 who was born at home.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping the continuity of life-givers/life-learner (parents/child)has been very special with him as he&#39;s never been to school.<br/>
