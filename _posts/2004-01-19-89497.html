<div id="ygrps-yiv-39013911">LOL he&#39;s glad I&#39;m not sheltering myself only among other believers anymore...I did that for awhile trying to be the perfect Christian..didn&#39;t work..If I was really that perfect I&#39;d have to be crucified for it and well, that&#39;s just not going to happen. I&#39;ve loosened up and we&#39;re all alot happier.<br/>
