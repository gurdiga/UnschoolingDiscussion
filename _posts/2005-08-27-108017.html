<div id="ygrps-yiv-858182758">This is one of those areas where all I&#39;m sure of is that I want it <br/>
to be different than how it was when I was a child...<br/>
<br/>
My mom always has had lots of negative things to say about <br/>
everybody. When I was growing up, she shared lots of info about <br/>
people that I wasn&#39;t ready for and didn&#39;t ask for. I remember one <br/>
time when I was probably 7 or 8. We were headed to a party and she <br/>
told me, in regards to some people I probably wasn&#39;t going to even <br/>
talk to, that if anything came up about the woman&#39;s maiden name <br/>
being the same as her married name, don&#39;t ask why, because she had <br/>
married her first cousin. Too much info!<br/>
<br/>
I remember feeling so conflicted about my dad&#39;s family because I <br/>
loved them so and yet heard all these terrible things about them. <br/>
They also gossiped a lot about each other and my mom had always <br/>
sworn me to secret about everything she told me, so I felt weighted <br/>
down by all of it.<br/>
<br/>
I Wanted To Do Things Differently long before I had kids, thought <br/>
about homeschooling, and learned about unschooling. Then my oldest <br/>
son came along. He has never been shy about telling people what he <br/>
thinks of them and their actions. From a 2 year old who would say &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t want you to pick me up&quot; to a 4.5 yr old who started telling <br/>
his friends&#39; parents not to yell at their kids. (That&#39;s a whole <br/>
other story...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to start actually approaching my point, I&#39;ve just been <br/>
avoiding saying anything negative about people for a long time now! <br/>
I&#39;m afraid he&#39;ll repeat it to their face. And I don&#39;t want to burden <br/>
him with things he&#39;s not supposed to talk about to people&#39;s faces.<br/>
<br/>
But I feel like I&#39;m being less than honest with him. One of his <br/>
friends has been very angry lately. I didn&#39;t like how much this boy <br/>
has been yelling at other kids and had one of those &quot;is it just me <br/>
or is C really angry a lot&quot; talks with another mom. Then C was over <br/>
and yelled at my 2 yr old and tried to close the door on her. I <br/>
didn&#39;t say anything about it to Mikey, but just didn&#39;t bring up the <br/>
idea of playing with C much. Of course Mikey was well aware of how C <br/>
was acting and mentioned the other day about this noise C makes when <br/>
he&#39;s really angry. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m missing opportunities to talk about things because I&#39;m not sure <br/>
how to approach it and would love to hear how people without hang <br/>
ups actually talk. (Well, without hang-ups re this topic--don&#39;t want <br/>
to limit the conversation too much!) Or how you&#39;ve dealt despite <br/>
your hang-ups...It&#39;s past time for me to get over this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788810675">I have the opposite issue.  :) I&#39;ll be interested to hear what people have<br/>
to say on this issue.   My parents never said anything negative about<br/>
anyone.  (for the most part)  And we weren&#39;t expected to say negative things<br/>
about people either.  Gossip was seen as very bad and I think that was a<br/>
good thing in many ways.    But it also crossed over that you really didn&#39;t<br/>
feel comfortable venting about anyone either or just talking about what<br/>
happened between you and a friend.  If you didn&#39;t feel comfortable talking<br/>
about things that happened between you and your friends, you also couldn&#39;t<br/>
bring issues to the table to talk about how to work through them.  <br/>
<br/>
I have always wanted my kids to feel comfortable talking with me about<br/>
anything.  But I do get tired of hearing them complain about people<br/>
sometimes.  I know I am overly critical of it, in my mind, but I try to keep<br/>
those thoughts to myself.  The fear is that my children will grow up to be<br/>
intolerant of people&#39;s differences, but that is not justified.  My kids are<br/>
kind to other people and just vent their frustrations at home where they<br/>
feel safe.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did when the girls were littler that helped them talk about<br/>
issues they have with other kids without my interpreting it for them, was to<br/>
say something that validated their feelings to them after their complaint.<br/>
That opened the door to them talking about it more without my judgment.<br/>
Usually these topics came up in bed at night.  They might say something<br/>
about what a kid had done that was mean and I might say boy, that sounds<br/>
frustrating to deal with.  We might talk about how they responded that time<br/>
and how they might respond differently next time if it didn&#39;t work well.<br/>
Actually, we still do this, but now they really vent how they felt and it&#39;s<br/>
hard to hear sometimes.  I do try to focus on helping them solve the problem<br/>
though.  I want them to feel empowered and not victims of other people&#39;s<br/>
behavior.  <br/>

I would have talked to C directly, reminded him of how he needs to act in <br/>
your home, and maybe ask him if he wanted to talk.     If you grew up being told <br/>

life, about what factors he&#39;s dealing with and about how some people react <br/>
when they&#39;re afraid or angry.    We&#39;ll talk about what my child might do to make <br/>
things easier, or whether avoidance is the best option.    <br/>
<br/>
Instead of telling him &quot;Well, their parents are divorced and his dad&#39;s <br/>
fooling around,&quot; you could say &quot;Maybe he misses his dad and doesn&#39;t know how to act. <br/>
  Maybe his mom is angry and that keeps him from feeling like he has a safe, <br/>
quiet place to be.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, and much of it was wrapped up in the whole medical profession <br/>
taking over from midwifery period of history. A &quot;gossip&quot; was one of the <br/>
women present during another woman&#39;s lying-in, or child-bearing, and the <br/>
month-long period after which the new mother stayed in her room/ <br/>
home.The gossip was likely the one to fetch the midwife when the time <br/>
came. Once that month long period was over, the new mother went for her <br/>
&quot;churching&quot; a kind of purification and re-entrance to the community and <br/>
her gossip was often the one to reintroduce her to the community. The <br/>
&quot;gossip&quot; or &quot;God-sib,&quot; literally God-sibling, was an intermediary <br/>
between the new mother and the larger community during this time. She <br/>
held a very important role in the female circle surrounding child birth.<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of a couple of centuries &quot;gossips&quot; and midwives and <br/>
medicinal women were slowly demonized and denigrated by other forms of <br/>
power--the church, the rising medical profession, etc.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really interesting because one example I started to give and decided <br/>
to write less &lt;g&gt; was the way in which women learn about childbirth, from other <br/>
women sharing their stories with pregnant women.    Pregnant women hear the <br/>
kinds of stories that just aren&#39;t told otherwise, and they&#39;re hugely valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I have some male friends with some interpersonal skills, and they have <br/>
discussed with me the differences between the ways women typically share information <br/>
and the way men do.   It&#39;s not a women vs. men division so much (I think, at <br/>
this point, having not thought about it enough to have a conviction) but is <br/>
between people with high inter- and intra-personal intelligence and the <br/>
relatively clueless.   <br/>
<br/>
The prevailing traditions of school were likely developed by very verbal and <br/>
bookish people who thought others were just not very bright (if their talents <br/>
were physical or musical or artistic, I mean), and dismissed any evidence that <br/>
didn&#39;t support their books-and-words-are-everything theories.    Similarly, <br/>
the prejudices against &quot;gossip&quot; were probably solidified by people who just saw <br/>
no value in knowing about the neighbors.   <br/>
<br/>
Yes, if they don&#39;t need or use information about people, and wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
what to do with it if they had it, there&#39;s no reason for them to know.<br/>
<br/>
When I get involved in long discussions about who and what and why, I try to <br/>
be aware of who might be there who is NOT really prepared to hear those <br/>
things.   I know one woman who only uses such information to needle people or to <br/>
prove she knows something others don&#39;t know.   She&#39;s socially worthless.    She <br/>
gives gossip a bad name.    Years ago I quit telling her anything useful or <br/>
real.<br/>
<br/>
I was involved in the SCA at corporate level for years, and there were people <br/>
who LOVED to know me because they liked telling their friends what they had <br/>
learned from me.   I figured out a trick I&#39;m sure politicians must all know.    <br/>
I would answer some of their questions and tell them a few stories (of what <br/>
current problems or issues were, or what had happened at the last board <br/>
meeting).   I would tailor my little info-feeds to their interests, and sometimes I <br/>
could give them something their audience needed to know, that would benefit <br/>
their region or corner of the SCA.   I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;That&#39;s just part of what I <br/>
know,&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t tell you anything REALLY juicy.&quot;   that would&#39;ve been cruel. <br/>
   I would tell them something that would be fun for them to know, and <br/>
socially valuable, but something that wouldn&#39;t hurt anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t have that discernment.   They think they have to tell <br/>
everything they know or nothing.   Balance and judgment.<br/>

and I was proud of her courage and compassion.   They weren&#39;t in homes, but <br/>
had she been booted from a house for objecting, she wouldn&#39;t have minded.   I <br/>
think she has wished a couple of times she had said something at one particular <br/>
house, but she just wandered off and quit hanging around there instead.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s talked about one incident of a neighbor she played with just a few <br/>
times.   Once they were at a third neighbor&#39;s pool (housesitting, the other <br/>
family) and it was two girls and the other girl&#39;s uncle.   They were in the pool and <br/>
the other girl wanted to get her towel, or to just get out for a while and <br/>
the young uncle simply said &quot;NO, stay in the pool.&quot;   No good reason, just to be <br/>
in control.   Holly just climbed out and got the towel and walked it around <br/>
to the girl without even looking at the uncle.   He was (she knew clearly) not <br/>
authorized to tell Holly to stay in a pool.   She quit hanging around there; <br/>
the uncle died (natural causes or drugs, we don&#39;t know which) and that&#39;s just <br/>
that.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s not passive, though.   If she does decide not to express herself in <br/>
the moment, she will express herself at length and in depth later. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

supported stand, baby. Their house had not changed since pre baby times. <br/>
It was immaculate, still with plants and ornaments on the floor and low <br/>
tables. I commented and was told that the toddler didn&#39;t touch anything. <br/>
I must have looked surprised (I had 3 kids, one the same age as theirs, <br/>
plus a 3yo and a 5yo) and was told that if the baby touched anything his <br/>
hand was smacked and he soon learned. Dh & I sat feeling stunned, not <br/>
knowing what to say, but our 5yo ds didn&#39;t hesitate: &quot;Babies are NOT for <br/>
hitting. If you don&#39;t want him to touch things you should put them where <br/>
he can&#39;t reach them.&quot;  Their turn to be stunned! We didn&#39;t go back and <br/>
visit for a very long time.<br/>
<br/>
You gotta love him. Mind you I think it was easier for him to say that <br/>
back then, than it is for him to do it now he has 2 beautiful, amazingly <br/>
energetic, adventurous, curious, active, exhausting children of his own!<br/>
