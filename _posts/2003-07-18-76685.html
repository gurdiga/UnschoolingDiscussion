<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404597180">We did our second garden this year.  Kids harvested the lettuce, now <br/>
2 pumpkins are in the house, picked blackberries and blueberries, <br/>
investigated the brand new sprouts in the cucumbers, tomatoes, and <br/>
watermelons.  That is not even touching the flowers that were all <br/>
planted with seed.  They made a strawberry pie.<br/>
<br/>
We visited the K-9 training center and had a great FIELD TRIP!!! <br/>
Watched and learned all about dog grooming, the kennels, cattery, and <br/>
the grounds/equipment that is used.  Also, on the front page of one <br/>
of the local newspapers, unbeknownst to us, was a feature of a family <br/>
that is attempting to persuade a neighboring county to invest in a K-<br/>
9 unit.  AWESOME &quot;reading&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here in Missouri??<br/>
