<div id="ygrps-yiv-85741636">Okay, i have been trying to take in the advice i&#39;ve been given. I had<br/>
a good cry the other night, and have been reading more articles, and<br/>
had long discussions with my husband. We have decided to try the no<br/>
more punishment thing. I am scared though, of what might happen if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t work or i break down and can&#39;t handle it. I&#39;m afraid of not<br/>
being consistent with my children and them resenting me more for it.<br/>
But maybe if i can ask questions as they come up, and as i learn more<br/>
about the way you all are with your families i might get the hang of<br/>
it. I&#39;ve realized it&#39;s true that i don&#39;t have to let it upset me when<br/>
my kids break THEIR things, that the things become THEIRS when i give<br/>
them to the kids and the things have to be THEIRS for them to ever<br/>
learn how to care for THEIR things. And maybe i should find things to<br/>
give them just so they can break them if that&#39;s what they like to do.<br/>
It&#39;s true also that the value I put onto books is MY value, not<br/>
THEIRS, and shouldn&#39;t be impossed on them if i want them to learn to<br/>
think freely. I should let them learn THEIR OWN value for things like<br/>
books and whatever else.<br/>
The not throwing and runing in the house thing will be hard because i<br/>
offer my kids alternatives like playing in the backyard and they<br/>
always act as though they are being punished if i say &quot;Go outside if<br/>
you want to wrestle, or rough house, run, throw, etc.&quot; Or i might say<br/>
&quot;Why don&#39;t you guys go play baseball or hide and seek?&quot; But sometimes<br/>
they just refuse my suggestions and continue being high strung<br/>
indoors. So i have had a rule that if they won&#39;t calm down inside i<br/>
make them go out back. They respond to this like a punishment.<br/>
It&#39;s easy to say &quot;Well why don&#39;t you go play baseball with them?&quot; I<br/>
suppose that&#39;s possible some of the time, but solutions like that<br/>
aren&#39;t workable in reality 100% of the time. I&#39;m currently nine months<br/>
pregnant, and can&#39;t leave food on the stove cooking, for instance, to<br/>
go play baseball.(My kids like to run and yell in the house when they<br/>
know i&#39;m busy with something hard to walk away from like cooking or an<br/>
important phone call.) I also have so much to do preparing for the new<br/>
baby that can be and is put off to do things with them sometimes, but<br/>
it can&#39;t always be that way. Yesterday, for instance, we played out<br/>
back with water bombs and water guns all afternoon instead of me doing<br/>
the things i know i need to get done and now i&#39;ll have a heavier load<br/>
today. But, i am willing to try.<br/>
Yesterday was our first day trying not to tell the kids what to do<br/>
constantly, and with no punishments and i already have a billion<br/>
questions.<br/>
What do you do when your four year old wants to climb on the fence and<br/>
it is sharp at the top? I felt i NEEDED to tell him not to do it.<br/>
Or what if they want to drink the whole container of juice boxes in<br/>
one day and you know they will cry for the rest of the week that there<br/>
aren&#39;t anymore? Or what if they want to eat the things i buy<br/>
specically for my husband&#39;s lunches at work?(I do buy them their own<br/>
treats.)If they want to play in the pool, but you know it&#39;s not warm<br/>
enough outside should you just let them do it anyway, and hope they<br/>
learn from it when they are cold? This is going to be so hard for me<br/>
to learn. Also what do you do about them respecting YOUR things? They<br/>
play with my stuff, and jump on my bed, climb on the car, and get into<br/>
my husband&#39;s tools. By the way, i did not exaggerate about things<br/>
getting broken. My children have broken three or four windows within<br/>
the past year, and a ceiling fan, a floor fan and a light fixture.<br/>
That&#39;s aside from the books, toys and videos i throw away every time i<br/>
clean their room. It&#39;s not that things MIGHT get broken at my house.<br/>
Things DO get broken. And alot of times it&#39;s MY things. We have had a<br/>
rule that if it&#39;s not yours don&#39;t play with it. I don&#39;t know what to<br/>
do about that. So if you all haven&#39;t given up on me because of my<br/>
negativity yet please help me figure some of this out.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Lilith mother of Tristan Michael(7), Danikan Amadeus(4), and soon to<br/>
be Jude Onyx</div>

<br/>
And from your next post:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This reminds me of a hurtful argument my mother and i had about me<br/>
quitting smoking last week. She really offended me by making a remark<br/>
about me leaving my children without a mother. I can see her point<br/>
better now after reading this, though i feel she could have stated<br/>
things differently and less harassingly. I have tried to quit smoking<br/>
  several times throughout the past year, and i felt she was being<br/>
harassing as though i don&#39;t realize how important it is to quit. But i<br/>
just wanted to share that i noticed this philosophy can be applied to<br/>
anything we need to do to better ourselves, not just our parenting. It<br/>
could become &quot;too late&quot; for me to quit smoking, and i think maybe<br/>
that&#39;s all my mother was trying to explain to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m just guessing here that you smoked during your other pregnancies <br/>
as well.  Have you considered that your two boys may have physiological <br/>
conditions that are causing their behavior?  Upon reading the details <br/>
you&#39;ve posted, I&#39;ve begun to suspect that your boys are behaving <br/>
abnormally.  What does their pediatrician say about their behaviors?  <br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be mean or hurtful or judgmental, but you came to <br/>
this list asking for help from more experienced unschoolers, and I&#39;m <br/>
probably not the only one who&#39;s thinking along these lines.  You may <br/>
need medical intervention, rather than parenting advice.<br/>

Smoking During Pregnancy Increases Conduct Disorders<br/>
<br/>
SOURCE: Archives General Psychiatry, 54:670-676, July, 1997<br/>
<br/>
More evidence on the connection between a mother&#39;s smoking during <br/>
pregnancy and increased risk of having a child with behavior disorders. <br/>
Below is a direct quote of the summary of the 1997 journal article <br/>
report in the Archives of General Psychiatry, 54:670, 1997.<br/>
<br/>
Background: Previous animal and human studies have indicated that <br/>
prenatal exposure to nicotine isassociated with adverse reproductive <br/>
outcomes, including altered neural structure and functioning,cognitive <br/>
deficits, and behavior problems in the offspring. Our study extends <br/>
previous research onhumans by controlling a broad range of correlates <br/>
of maternal smoking during pregnancy todetermine if smoking is <br/>
associated with behavior problems in the offspring severe enough to <br/>
qualifyfor DSM-III-R diagnoses. <br/>
<br/>
Method: Subjects were 177 clinic-referred boys, ages 7 to 12 years at <br/>
the time of the first assessment, who underwent longitudinal assessment <br/>
for 6 years using annual structured diagnostic interviews. Correlates <br/>
of maternal smoking during pregnancy and previously identified <br/>
demographic, parental, perinatal, and family risk factors for the <br/>
disruptive behavior disorders were controlled in logistic regression <br/>
analyses. <br/>
<br/>
Results: Mothers who smoked more than half a pack of cigarettes daily <br/>
during pregnancy were significantly more likely to have a child with <br/>
conduct disorder (odds ratio, 4.4; P=.001) than mothers who did not <br/>
smoke during pregnancy. This association was statistically significant <br/>
when controlling for socioeconomic status, maternal age, parental <br/>
antisocial personality, substance abuse during pregnancy, and <br/>
maladaptive parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusions: Maternal smoking during pregnancy appears to be a robust <br/>
independent risk factor for conduct disorder in male offspring. <br/>
Maternal smoking during pregnancy may have direct adverse effects on <br/>
the developing fetus or be a marker for a heretofore unmeasured <br/>
characteristic of mothers that is of etiologic significance for conduct <br/>
disorder.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I know.  It&#39;s really easy to dismiss any possibility that <br/>
unschooled kids could have behavioral problems related to physical <br/>
conditions because studies are always done using the far-more numerous <br/>
school kids.  Homeschooled kids aren&#39;t subject to the kind of <br/>
evaluations schooled kids are, so I think it&#39;s possible learning <br/>
difficulties, hearing problems, vision problems, etc. may be missed <br/>
unless we *parents* are aware.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You should be aware that the kids will test you a LOT to see if you  <br/>
will change your mind and start punishing again. If they are  <br/>
accustomed to you setting limits and then reinforcing them, they are  <br/>
going to go as far as they possibly can to see if you will revert. I  <br/>
just wanted to warn you, so that you don&#39;t break in the middle and  <br/>
mess up. If that happens, you will go even further back than you are  <br/>
now, because they WILL resent and not trust you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a punishment to them, because not only are you sending them  <br/>
away from you, but you are doing it in the spirit of frustration.  <br/>
I&#39;ll bet if you said, &quot;Let&#39;s go outside to play&quot; and then go out with  <br/>
them, they would love it. I&#39;ll bet they LOVED the waterballoon fight.  <br/>
And there is no reason why you shouldn&#39;t do that every day. It sounds  <br/>
exhausting, but it is your job, and after a while, they won&#39;t need  <br/>
you as much because they will trust that you&#39;ll be there when they  <br/>
need you. And soon they will grow up and not be so intense. You don&#39;t  <br/>
have to play hard, but sometimes your presence to validate them is  <br/>
all they need. Sitting in a lawn chair and saying &quot;WOw! You can run  <br/>
really fast&quot; or &quot;I didn&#39;t know you could throw the ball so high&quot;, or  <br/>
play as long as you can and say in an exaggerated manner, &quot;Sheesh!  <br/>
You guys have a lot of energy...mommy needs to sit down and rest the  <br/>
baby&quot; That&#39;s what I usually wind up doing (and I&#39;m pregnant a LOT  <br/>
lol!) But then I&#39;m sitting there and being involved.<br/>

&gt; go play baseball.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy to turn the food off to play with your kids, it&#39;s easy to  <br/>
make foods that you don&#39;t have to attend to, you just have to make  <br/>
the choice to do it. I have seven kids, one of whom has a severe  <br/>
disability, several of whom have moderate issues, and two of whom  <br/>
have serious food allergies. If I can do it pregnant...so can you.  <br/>
It&#39;s just a matter of turning off the &#39;what if&#39;s?&#39; and choosing to  <br/>
live this life and be happy doing it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (My kids like to run and yell in the house when they<br/>
&gt; know i&#39;m busy with something hard to walk away from like cooking or an<br/>
&gt; important phone call.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because they know it&#39;s the best way to get your attention!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also have so much to do preparing for the new<br/>
&gt; baby<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Babies don&#39;t need anything but mom and love. Maybe diapers, but not  <br/>
all moms do that. They don&#39;t need a crib, they don&#39;t need toys, they  <br/>
don&#39;t need a fresh coat of paint. Take this time when you can&#39;t be  <br/>
doing everything to choose to spend time with your kids. It will make  <br/>
all the difference. I just did this myself, and came fully to  <br/>
unschooling when i was on three months bedrest with my last baby. It  <br/>
was awesome to let all that stuff go!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that can be and is put off to do things with them sometimes, but<br/>
&gt; it can&#39;t always be that way. Yesterday, for instance, we played out<br/>
&gt; back with water bombs and water guns all afternoon instead of me doing<br/>
&gt; the things i know i need to get done and now i&#39;ll have a heavier load<br/>
&gt; today.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What heavier load? Laundry is laundry, dishes is dishes, dust is  <br/>
dust. It will always be there, but your kids won&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What do you do when your four year old wants to climb on the fence and<br/>
&gt; it is sharp at the top?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let him do it. Trust that he has the brains to know when he&#39;s gone  <br/>
too far and be willing to help him out without scolding or saying &#39;I  <br/>
told you so&#39;. Encourage him. Don&#39;t yell because it throws him off  <br/>
balance and the worst thing you could do is undermine his self esteem  <br/>
by fretting.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Or what if they want to drink the whole container of juice boxes in<br/>
&gt; one day and you know they will cry for the rest of the week that there<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t anymore?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get more. Or offer something else cool to drink. Chocolate milk.  <br/>
Homemade lemonade. Water with ice cubes that have plastic bugs frozen  <br/>
in them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or what if they want to eat the things i buy<br/>
&gt; specically for my husband&#39;s lunches at work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get them the same stuff you buy dh. Or pack theirs up like you pack  <br/>
his. Or make something new and different for lunch. edible playdough,  <br/>
pizza rolls, pigs in a blanket, sandwiches cut into shapes. Picnic  <br/>
outside.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; )If they want to play in the pool, but you know it&#39;s not warm<br/>
&gt; enough outside should you just let them do it anyway, and hope they<br/>
&gt; learn from it when they are cold?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep. They will play in it for about ten minutes. Or they might  <br/>
surprise you and play longer because to them it DOESN&quot;T feel that  <br/>
cold. Or they might stand on the side and splash or get cups of water  <br/>
to make mud. have big warm blankets to snuggle them in when they do  <br/>
get cold. and hot cocoa is always nice ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also what do you do about them respecting YOUR things? They<br/>
&gt; play with my stuff, and jump on my bed, climb on the car, and get into<br/>
&gt; my husband&#39;s tools.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I ask the kids to treat my things with respect. I redirect. I ask  <br/>
them again. I redirect. I ask them again. I redirect. Sounds simple,  <br/>
but if they are jumping on the bed, it&#39;s either because they need  <br/>
that input or that they need my attention. They aren&#39;t jumping on it  <br/>
just to destroy it. Now, if you made a big deal about how they will  <br/>
destroy it, and that&#39;s the attention they get, it might turn into  <br/>
that. And some kids just need longer to learn than others. My kids  <br/>
have their own tools. They climb on the walls outside. They jump on  <br/>
their own beds, and sometimes they jump on mine. Sometimes *I* jump  <br/>
on mine. It&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; By the way, i did not exaggerate about things<br/>
&gt; getting broken. My children have broken three or four windows within<br/>
&gt; the past year, and a ceiling fan, a floor fan and a light fixture.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve lost a ceiling fan, a sliding glass door and two screens. It  <br/>
was accidental each time, they just wanted to see what happened and  <br/>
now they now. They didn&#39;t get a lecture about breaking things or  <br/>
destroying things, so that&#39;s not their focus. They&#39;ve learned that  <br/>
they can ask me for help. The fan was the funniest thing, because  <br/>
they thought they could swing around like cartoon characters do.  <br/>
Well, they didn&#39;t ;-) I&#39;m just thankful they didn&#39;t break their necks  <br/>
or pull the whole thing out of the ceiling on their heads.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s aside from the books, toys and videos i throw away every time i<br/>
&gt; clean their room. It&#39;s not that things MIGHT get broken at my house.<br/>
&gt; Things DO get broken.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids have lots of energy. They need to have lots of mommy too. Some  <br/>
kids need more sensory input than others and they have to play as  <br/>
hard as possible just to feel real. The alternative is to have a  <br/>
spacey kid who is a vegetable. Meds can do that for you. We do lots  <br/>
of heavy work, we dig holes to china. we dig tigger traps. we build  <br/>
stuff (lots of hammering and sawing). we jump alot, we climb alot of  <br/>
trees.<br/>
I know you&#39;re tired. i feel that you are uncertain of where you are  <br/>
going. I was there not so long ago. I&#39;m still there sometimes. But we  <br/>
have a job as parents to make better choices, to know where we are  <br/>
going. You CAN do this, and you took the first step by admitting you  <br/>
need help to get there. Make the choice now to keep going. To trust  <br/>
in your kids and support them, the same way you did when you married  <br/>
your husband...<br/>
hope this is okay</div>

This is a really helpful page in getting past having rules.<br/>

suggestion to them if you included yourself in the mix.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s easy to say &quot;Well why don&#39;t you go play baseball with them?&quot; I<br/>
&gt;suppose that&#39;s possible some of the time, but solutions like that<br/>

&gt;pregnant, and can&#39;t leave food on the stove cooking, for instance, to<br/>
&gt;go play baseball.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, but you can turn off the stove and go outside with them if they <br/>
really need you.  Baseball playing is probably not the thing for you <br/>
to do right now, but since it&#39;s apparent that they really want you to <br/>
be with them, all you have to do is be there.  With them.  Talking <br/>
and listening and laughing and being your wonderful self who they really love!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

really *have* to do, anyway?  Babies really only need the arms of their moms.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Give him information (in a loving, supportive way) that he can use to <br/>
make a good decision about climbing the fence.  See if there&#39;s a way <br/>
you can help him do what he wants to do rather than just telling him <br/>
he can&#39;t.  If you can give him information in the right, supportive <br/>
way, he&#39;ll reach the conclusion that works best for him.<br/>

juice boxes and then is sad that they&#39;re all gone, comfort him, the <br/>
way you would any friend who was sad.  Don&#39;t rub salt into the wound <br/>
or say, &quot;I told you so.&quot;  He&#39;ll get it.  Or, just make sure you get <br/>

they can be seen and consumed right away!<br/>
<br/>

does.  When I&#39;m cold, he&#39;s really not.  I would not make him wear a <br/>
jacket when he&#39;s not cold, and I would hope he wouldn&#39;t prevent me <br/>
from wearing a jacket if I were cold.  So, if they want to play in <br/>
the pool and it&#39;s too cold for you, let them reach the decision based <br/>
on their comfort.  &#39;Cause if you prevent them from doing it, they&#39;ll <br/>
want to do it all the more regardless of their personal comfort or safety.<br/>

me, and I don&#39;t leave &#39;em out (except one or two) where they can get <br/>
hurt.  The one or two that I do leave out are fair game.  If there&#39;s <br/>
stuff that you have that would make you sad if it got broken, <br/>
consider putting it away for a while until your kids are older and <br/>
can be more respectful of your things.  If you can do this in a <br/>

stuff out of harm&#39;s way.  And, consider rearranging your home so that <br/>
it&#39;s less convenient for them to run, if you don&#39;t want them running <br/>
in the living room, say.  Replace all the breakable stuff with <br/>
unbreakable stuff (for now), and realize that you&#39;re sharing your <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927587698">I started going through this and responding to each point, but I <br/>
realized that there was an overall feel to your post, your need, your <br/>
exhaustion that I wanted to respond to. You sound so tired. You write of <br/>
being afraid of what will happen if you step away from timeouts and <br/>
countdowns to spankings. You write THEIRS in shouting capitals and write <br/>
i in lower case tiny letters.<br/>
<br/>
You sound so tired and so angry. When I was pregnant with Linnaea, my <br/>
second child, I was tired. I was grouchy. I didn&#39;t have a lot of <br/>
patience. I was working part time when I was pregnant which felt like <br/>
the only time when I got a break. And I felt horribly guilty for <br/>
enjoying the break. For enjoying being able to go over to the cafeteria <br/>
on the Fridays when I went into the VA and get a coke and just sit at my <br/>
computer and work without any distractions. It was lovely to be all on <br/>
my own. I&#39;ve never really felt that way at any other time. I&#39;ve enjoyed <br/>
the luxury of walking quickly to the shops or of not having to be <br/>
slightly vigilantly aware of where everyone is when going somewhere <br/>
else, but I enjoyed the &quot;just me time&quot; when I was pregnant with Linnaea <br/>
more than I ever have before or since. I&#39;m not suggesting that you need <br/>
&quot;me time&quot; with your pregnancy in the same way that I did, but maybe you <br/>
are tired. Maybe, as this parasitic growth inside you gets closer and <br/>
closer to birth, and is taking more and more from you to support her <br/>
life, you have less to give to your other dependents. Maybe you need to <br/>
schedule in your day pick me ups, little energy boosts of a banana <br/>
milkshake or an energy bar or 10 minutes of you and a cup of tea and <br/>
some cookies. Maybe you need to think about what really needs to get <br/>
done in a day. Maybe you could fix a bunch of freezable meals when your <br/>
husband is around that you could just pop in the oven or microwave for <br/>
the days when he isn&#39;t around, so that you don&#39;t have to choose between <br/>
being with your children and standing at the stove. Maybe you could get <br/>
a crock pot and cook dinner all day and not have to spend a particular <br/>
time stuck to the stove. Maybe if you have to cook you could set up <br/>
something for the boys to do while you are cooking, a video or a game or <br/>
time on the computer or something that would keep them entertained so <br/>
that you don&#39;t have to feel pulled in to many directions. Maybe you <br/>
could order pizza on the nights when you just can&#39;t cope anymore. Or buy <br/>
a few frozen ones to have as back up for when baseball was too <br/>
distracting to keep you standing at the stove.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what you &quot;have&quot; to do. I don&#39;t know what things in your <br/>
house are piling up from one day to the next. If I don&#39;t get done what I <br/>
want to on one day it doesn&#39;t feel that bad to address it the next. Are <br/>
there ways that you can make your required labor less intense. Buy some <br/>
boxes on wheels to toss toys into when you need to clean up the living <br/>
room. Soak dishes overnight and do the dishes in the morning. Try and <br/>
minimize how much you feel you need to do.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t good that they are breaking windows or that they are breaking <br/>
things that are yours. Maybe if you give them something they can play <br/>
with in the house when they are trying to use something that will break <br/>
or will break other things they won&#39;t respond so angrily. Simon just got <br/>
an indoor frisbee &quot;called a Superang&quot; for his birthday. Pillows are <br/>
usually pretty good, oh, Simon discovered a while ago that a tam, little <br/>
round knitted hat that lies flat when it isn&#39;t worn, makes a great <br/>
indoor frisbee. You could talk to them about why it isn&#39;t okay to play <br/>
with certain things in the house. Simon got this cool electronic circuit <br/>
building set for Christmas that has, among other things, a spinning disc <br/>
that you build a launcher for. One of the paintings in our house got <br/>
chipped by the disc, and so it isn&#39;t something that we use in the living <br/>
room unless I&#39;ve draped a blanket over the painting.  If something is <br/>
important to you that it not be broken you might want to make sure that <br/>
it isn&#39;t accessible. If they want to go in the pool when you think it is <br/>
too cold, get lots of towels and be prepared to warm them up, make some <br/>
hot chocolate or give them a nice warm bath or shower when they are <br/>
done. Maybe you could take them to a heated indoor pool. A friend <br/>
mentioned that a Holiday Inn near us (in Newcastle, so I don&#39;t know if <br/>
you can do this in the U.S.) lets you use their pool and jacuzzi for 5 <br/>
pounds a person, or something, maybe you could go there. Or maybe you <br/>
could book a night at a local hotel and stay over, watching new <br/>
television and swimming in the pool and enjoying the continental breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
Juice boxes, buy more. Buy more when you go shopping so that they have <br/>
lots and lots to drink. If you can&#39;t afford to buy more, than make that <br/>
something that you talk about. Have them help you figure out what to buy <br/>
at the grocery store. If they choose to splurge on the exciting new <br/>
foods you just got from the grocery store, that is pretty normal. All <br/>
the good fruit goes really quickly around here. And fresh bread is <br/>
always more appealing than day old bread. And when it is gone you can <br/>
write it on the list for the next grocery run. At some point the thing <br/>
that was an exciting splurge will change. Chips last far longer than <br/>
strawberries around here. Chips are common, strawberries, good spring <br/>
strawberries, are rare, and so get eaten very, very quickly. Artichokes <br/>
and edamame and good apple juice and soy milk at the moment are things <br/>
that disappear, but we have a box filled with tic tacs (cinnamon which <br/>
I&#39;ve only found in one place here, so we bought the store out) and <br/>
starbursts and hohos (cadbury mini rolls really) and gum and coke bottle <br/>
candy and wine gums and a bunch of other stuff that has been there for <br/>
at least a month and that I&#39;ll have to go through soon to throw out what <br/>
is stale or melted or gross. Phish food ice cream goes pretty quickly, <br/>
but the Fossil Fuel just hasn&#39;t moved. But it takes a while to trust <br/>
that what you like will be there when you want it. And if you have <br/>
equated being good with getting a certain treat, like juice boxes or a <br/>
candy bar, than those things taste of more than just a candy bar or a <br/>
juice box. And it may take a while for that unintentional raise in value <br/>
to dissipate, for food to taste like food instead of like praise or <br/>
punishment. Linnaea is right now, this very minute, playing with her <br/>
friend for whom chocolate is the most amazing food. She isn&#39;t allowed <br/>
free access to chocolate. So when she comes over we stock up, and <br/>
Linnaea, for whom right now, this very minute, fitting in is very <br/>
important, will try and mirror her consumption of chocolate. But she <br/>
can&#39;t. She just doesn&#39;t need it in the same way as her friend needs it. <br/>
So, she eats what she can and then gets to share what she couldn&#39;t and <br/>
didn&#39;t want to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I think, though, the first thing I would look at if I were in your shoes <br/>
is how much being pregnant has made you weary. I would think about how <br/>
big and how heavy I felt and how feeling that way might be coloring my <br/>
vision of the rest of the world. Being pregnant is hard work, and its <br/>
constant and it doesn&#39;t help you to sleep at night. Try and give <br/>
yourself permission to let go of housework and other things right now. <br/>
Try and take the time to breathe and relax and not feel everything <br/>
mounting around you in some sort of Sarah Sylvia Cynthia Stout who would <br/>
not take the garbage out kind of way <br/>

Try to live in the middle with how you characterize your kids and  <br/>

they will like to do 800 things.  You need to find a few every day.   <br/>
And if they are interested in opening up an old wind-up alarm clock,  <br/>
cool!  That doesn&#39;t mean they like to break all clocks.   You can  <br/>
help satisfy their curiosities and keep them provided with  <br/>
interesting things to make, touch, explore without labelling them as  <br/>
kids who like to break things.<br/>

if you&#39;re going to say it about your children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So i have had a rule that if they won&#39;t calm down inside i<br/>
make them go out back. They respond to this like a punishment.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
It is a punishment.  It will help you sort through your feelings if  <br/>
you will really look at what you&#39;ve been doing and what you&#39;ve been  <br/>
calling it to make yourself feel better about all your rules.  If you  <br/>
have a rule that says if you won&#39;t do X, you cannot have Y, that IS a  <br/>
punishment.  Your kids are right and you&#39;re fooling yourself (and  <br/>
trying to fool us, because you&#39;re writing things down that you  <br/>
haven&#39;t really looked at clearly yourself).<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s easy to say &quot;Well why don&#39;t you go play baseball with them?&quot; I<br/>
suppose that&#39;s possible some of the time, but solutions like that<br/>
aren&#39;t workable in reality 100% of the time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere between 0% and 100% is where you need to be, and if you&#39;re  <br/>
not going to be with them at all, maybe send them to school where  <br/>
they can find people to run and be with.  Seriously.  If you&#39;re going  <br/>
to unschool you will HAVE to dedicate time and energy to it.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not just having kids at home and ignoring them until they piss you  <br/>
off enough to yell at them, as some people seem to believe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m currently nine months<br/>
pregnant, and can&#39;t leave food on the stove cooking, for instance, to<br/>
go play baseball.(My kids like to run and yell in the house when they<br/>
know i&#39;m busy with something hard to walk away from like cooking or an<br/>
important phone call.) -=-<br/>
<br/>
First, being pregnant doesn&#39;t make food cook differently.<br/>
Maybe playing with your boys should come first and THEN cooking  <br/>
next.  If they boys always come last, they will remain needy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My kids like to run and yell in the house when they<br/>

<br/>
When you&#39;re ignoring them, they find ways to occupy themselves.  You  <br/>
don&#39;t like the things they choose, so you get angry.  That wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
have happened, though, if you hadn&#39;t ignored them in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your boys should come first and THEN phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What do you do when your four year old wants to climb on the fence  <br/>
and<br/>
it is sharp at the top?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Find him something safe to climb on or stay right there and let him  <br/>
climb up 2/3 of the way, not to the sharp part.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What do you do when your four year old wants to climb on the fence  <br/>
and<br/>
it is sharp at the top? I felt i NEEDED to tell him not to do it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your need was to help him do what he wanted to do and help him not  <br/>
get hurt.  It felt like you needed to tell him no, but what you  <br/>
needed was to keep him safe.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-Or what if they want to drink the whole container of juice boxes in<br/>
one day and you know they will cry for the rest of the week that there<br/>
aren&#39;t anymore?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &quot;know they will cry.&quot;  To set up a scenario like that and  <br/>
then respond to it is neither being aware of your children in the  <br/>
moment nor living now.  It&#39;s seeing the world as a mass or horrible  <br/>
outcomes that can only be prevented by controlling the children.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere between &quot;one juice box a day&quot; and &quot;Drink them all right  <br/>
now&quot; is a nicer way to be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Or what if they want to eat the things i buy<br/>
specically for my husband&#39;s lunches at work?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Put those aside, put them in a brown paper bag or something, tape  <br/>
them up, don&#39;t even let them know they&#39;re there.  Or buy enough of it  <br/>
that they can have some and there&#39;s still enough for the work lunches.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If they want to play in the pool, but you know it&#39;s not warm<br/>
enough outside should you just let them do it anyway, and hope they<br/>
learn from it when they are cold?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The way you asked it sounds harsh, like you hope they&#39;re cold, and  <br/>
you hope they learn their lesson.  What if they&#39;re not that cold?   <br/>
What if they don&#39;t mind?<br/>
<br/>
My mom would be really angry when she made a dire prediction and it  <br/>
didn&#39;t come true.  If she said &quot;You&#39;ll get sick&quot; and I didn&#39;t, she  <br/>
was pretty grumpy.  She WANTED me to suffer.  She wanted to be right,  <br/>
but her assertions and theories were extreme and wrong and mean.<br/>
<br/>
Guys swim in ice-cold water in some parts of the world.  In some  <br/>
places they go between natural hot springs, or saunas, and ice-cold  <br/>
water.  It&#39;s not so crazy to just want to play in a pool that would  <br/>
be too cold for you.  Maybe they&#39;ll just want to get in a little bit  <br/>
and get right back out.  Would you feel the need to talk to them  <br/>
about it  if they did, and say &quot;I told you so?&quot;  If you could say  <br/>
&quot;Okay,&quot; and then &quot;Was it fun?&quot; when they get back, that would be  <br/>
nice.  Kids play in the snow, and then they come in to sit by a fire  <br/>
and drink hot chocolate.  If you think it will be too cold for them,  <br/>
maybe you could have towels to wrap up in and a nice DVD to watch  <br/>
while they get warm.  That wouldn&#39;t be too much work, but might seem  <br/>
like a party to them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also what do you do about them respecting YOUR things? They<br/>
play with my stuff, and jump on my bed, climb on the car, and get into<br/>
my husband&#39;s tools. -=-<br/>
<br/>
What I did was respect my children and their things from before they  <br/>
could remember, so they&#39;ve been pretty good about my things.  You  <br/>
can&#39;t expect kids to know what you know.  Years ago, Kirby broke the  <br/>
hardwood pointer that was my souvenir of being a teacher. I used it  <br/>
as a prop the first time I ever spoke at a conference.   He didn&#39;t  <br/>
know it was any more important than any old dowel or stick around the  <br/>
house.  I cried and he felt bad.  I didn&#39;t punish him.  It wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
have brought the stick back, and it wouldn&#39;t have made him care more  <br/>
about me or my things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My children have broken three or four windows within<br/>
the past year, and a ceiling fan, a floor fan and a light fixture.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re leaving them to take care of each other too much.   <br/>
Unschooling will work well if you do things with them, lots, or with  <br/>
one of them, or with all of your kids.  And fewer things will get  <br/>
broken if you&#39;re there and they have something better to do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-That&#39;s aside from the books, toys and videos i throw away every  <br/>
time i<br/>
clean their room.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you throw away things that aren&#39;t broken?  Maybe they don&#39;t  <br/>
respect your things because you don&#39;t respect their things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We have had a rule that if it&#39;s not yours don&#39;t play with it. I  <br/>
don&#39;t know what to<br/>
do about that.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Too many rules.  There&#39;s a link up above that looks like it&#39;s about  <br/>
rules but it&#39;s about principles.<br/>

who smoked during pregnancy anyway.<br/>

And by that I mean their WHOLE group was people who chose to smoke  <br/>
even though they knew smoking was bad for them, pregnant or not.  And  <br/>
they chose to smoke during pregnancy.<br/>

Maybe even if tobacco had never existed, parents who make choices  <br/>

&gt; We used to go to thrift stores and get toys that didn&#39;t really work,  <br/>

&gt; And if they are interested in opening up an old wind-up alarm clock,  <br/>
&gt; cool!  That doesn&#39;t mean they like to break all clocks.   You can  <br/>

Not wanting them to be cold would be my reasoning for not wanting them<br/>
in the pool in the first place. I just really don&#39;t appreciate that<br/>
type of response. I have been staying home since my first son was<br/>
born, and i have been an attentive parent. A window can get broken<br/>
when you are in the room. And my point about being pregnant had<br/>
nothing to do with cooking, it was an example of a way that i&#39;m<br/>
limited right now in what i can do with my children. My doctor would<br/>
tell me not to lift them, that is a limitation. I don&#39;t think letting<br/>
myself get hit in the stomache with a baseball or bat by accident<br/>
would be a good idea either. I really wish you could just keep harsh<br/>
assumptions to yourself. I want my children to learn and grow, and<br/>
everything about my parenting does not revolve around my ego as you<br/>
seem to assume it does. I didn&#39;t ask those questions sarcastically<br/>
just to test the responses i would get. I asked about things that were<br/>
real concerns of mine yesterday when i started trying to do this.</div>

I&#39;m asking you questions so that you can really examine why you&#39;ve  <br/>

<br/>
You have chosen your own words.  You picked the stories to tell, the  <br/>
words to use, the tone, the punctuation, and you decided to hit &quot;send.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now stop insulting people who read what you wrote and interpret it  <br/>
through the lens of their more gentle lives.  Telling me I&#39;m wrong  <br/>
doesn&#39;t make me wrong.  Telling me I&#39;m wrong doesn&#39;t make you right.   <br/>
You need to BE right, not just throw more words at it.<br/>
<br/>
I am not &quot;making it out as though&quot; you don&#39;t spend enough time with  <br/>
your kids.  I have two boys, two and a half years apart in age.  I  <br/>
know how long it takes to break a heater or a fan, and I know it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen when the mom is in the room.  You want to be cooking  <br/>
in one room while your kids are doing something peaceful and quiet  <br/>
and safe in another room.  That&#39;s not happening.  I&#39;m not assuming  <br/>
it&#39;s not happening, you&#39;re assuring us that it&#39;s not happening.  You  <br/>
want to discover TWO WEEKS after something is broken that it&#39;s lying  <br/>
in your own yard in pieces, and then get mad at your child.  You  <br/>
didn&#39;t spend much time in your yard during two weeks, or am I making  <br/>
a ridiculous assumption about that too?<br/>

Yes it can.  Were you in the room when any of those windows got  <br/>

&gt; I&#39;m asking you questions so that you can really examine why you&#39;ve  <br/>
&gt; chosen to write what you&#39;ve written.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have chosen your own words.  You picked the stories to tell, the<br/>
 &gt; words to use, the tone, the punctuation, and you decided to hit &quot;send.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now stop insulting people who read what you wrote and interpret it  <br/>
&gt; through the lens of their more gentle lives.  Telling me I&#39;m wrong  <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t make me wrong.  Telling me I&#39;m wrong doesn&#39;t make you right.   <br/>
&gt; You need to BE right, not just throw more words at it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not &quot;making it out as though&quot; you don&#39;t spend enough time with  <br/>
&gt; your kids.  I have two boys, two and a half years apart in age.  I  <br/>
&gt; know how long it takes to break a heater or a fan, and I know it  <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t happen when the mom is in the room.  You want to be cooking  <br/>
&gt; in one room while your kids are doing something peaceful and quiet  <br/>
&gt; and safe in another room.  That&#39;s not happening.  I&#39;m not assuming  <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not happening, you&#39;re assuring us that it&#39;s not happening.  You  <br/>
&gt; want to discover TWO WEEKS after something is broken that it&#39;s lying  <br/>
&gt; in your own yard in pieces, and then get mad at your child.  You  <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t spend much time in your yard during two weeks, or am I making  <br/>
&gt; a ridiculous assumption about that too?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-A window can get broken<br/>
&gt; when you are in the room. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes it can.  Were you in the room when any of those windows got  <br/>
&gt; broken?  (You don&#39;t need to tell us, you need to consider whether  <br/>
&gt; your statement &quot;A window can get broken when you are in the room&quot; has  <br/>
&gt; anything to do with YOUR windows getting broken.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here is an example of you making an incorrect assumption:<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;You want to discover TWO WEEKS after something is broken that it&#39;s<br/>
lying in your own yard in pieces, and then get mad at your child. You  <br/>
didn&#39;t spend much time in your yard during two weeks, or am I making  <br/>
a ridiculous assumption about that too?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If&#39;ll you&#39;ll look back at my previous post what i said was:<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;I bought my kids big plastic magnifying glasses and a bug house, so<br/>
they could observe bugs. A couple weeks later i found one of the<br/>
magnifying glasses destroyed in the backyard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You are reading alot into this statement that isn&#39;t there. I never<br/>
said it was broken for two weeks before i found it. I said i found it<br/>
broken two weeks later. For all i know it happened that day. I had<br/>
seen the glasses in use between the time i bought them and the time i<br/>
found one broken. I never said i didn&#39;t. I had seen it just laying out<br/>
there on the table before it was broken too. One day i walked out and<br/>
saw it smashed all over the ground. That day was about two weeks after<br/>
i had bought them. <br/>
<br/>
Just because a person doesn&#39;t state every detail of a situation<br/>
doesn&#39;t make it correct to imply details that aren&#39;t there.<br/>
It just seems to me that you do this with almost every statement i<br/>
make. Implying details that aren&#39;t there doesn&#39;t tell you anything<br/>
more truthful about me or my situation that what i have actually said<br/>
whether you feel there is a lack of detail or not.<br/>
<br/>
If i had meant that it had been broken for two weeks and then i found<br/>
it i would have stated it that way. But that isn&#39;t what i meant.<br/>
That&#39;s what you incorrectly assumed i meant.  <br/>
<br/>
And as far as being insulting goes, i feel you are being insulting to<br/>
me. So we both feel insulted by each other, and that isn&#39;t a matter of<br/>
being right or wrong. Feelings are irrational processes and rational<br/>
thought like concepts of right and wrong don&#39;t invalidate them. We are<br/>
both valid in feeling insulted. I don&#39;t care about trying to prove<br/>
who&#39;s right or wrong. What i would like is to talk to you about these<br/>
issues without us insulting each other over misconceptions. I would<br/>
like for you to understand the things i say. That&#39;s my goal, not just<br/>
to make you feel like i&#39;m right about something and you are not.<br/>
<br/>
And to clarify, when i say you incorrectly assumed, what i mean by<br/>
that is that your assumption is not the truth of the way the situation<br/>
actually happened.</div>

it (yellow food coloring makes him susceptible to symptoms from <br/>

bedwetting) or he turns it down. <br/>
This isn&#39;t the original topic/toxin, but it is another example of where <br/>
parenting styles really do make a difference in behavioral studies and <br/>
especially with boys between those ages (7-12) -- I&#39;ve seen lots of boys <br/>
between those ages and, indeed, there are HUGE differences between <br/>
schooled & unschooled.  Not a judgment, an observation. <br/>

If it hurts your feelings to hear that your children need you more,  <br/>
that&#39;s not a bad thing.<br/>

Feelings are not irrational processes.  There are reasons that  <br/>
children feel their parents are being mean or are spending more time  <br/>

them than just BEING with them.<br/>

wouldn&#39;t like to get hit with a baseball accidentally, pregnant or <br/>
not, but I&#39;m not going to sequester myself from my son&#39;s activities <br/>
just in case.  What kind of life would that be?!  For that matter, I <br/>
should give up driving the car in case I get into an accident, stop <br/>
walking up and down the stairs in case I fall, stop cooking in case I <br/>
burn myself, stop ... well, you get the idea.  I refuse to live my <br/>
life based on fear of what *could* happen.  Or, based on lack and <br/>
limitation.  I don&#39;t want my son to, either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be facetious (I *am* facetious!). :-)  I&#39;m really <br/>
trying to help you see how you may be operating from a place of fear <br/>
rather than a place of joy.  Joy is way better than fear.<br/>
<br/>
But, you have to be willing to look at yourself and see where your <br/>
fear is.  And then, push through it.<br/>
<br/>
For my whole life before my son was born I had a morbid, intense fear <br/>
of spiders.  (In fact, as a little kid I was afraid of nearly <br/>
everything:  dogs, cats, birds, butterflies, bees, and even feathers <br/>
for a while.  All those fears gradually fell away as I got older, but <br/>
the spider fear hung on.  **I guess the fear served me well.**)   It <br/>
was intense, and even into my 30s, if I saw a little spider on the <br/>
wall way across the room, I would freak out and I would need to have <br/>
someone &quot;get rid of it&quot; for me (it was like I was taking a contract <br/>
out on the poor guy, whose only crime was looking like a spider.  I <br/>
had lots of guilt around that!).  Then, our son was born, and we <br/>
moved into a little cottage in the woods.  Lots of spiders.  Big, big <br/>
ones.  I began to see that fear as a luxury I couldn&#39;t afford.  I <br/>
thought that if I was irrationally afraid of spiders, Liam could <br/>
catch my fear like a virus!  So, I stopped.  Each time I saw a spider <br/>
I made the conscious choice to allow my fear to move through me and <br/>
leave.  Whenever we saw spiders or anything (I really was not that <br/>
afraid of anything else, just spiders), like snakes or bees or some <br/>
other creepy-crawly, we would both quietly observe it.  And, I got to <br/>
the point where I could trap a big spider (without fear) and just <br/>
escort the guy out of the house and into the woods.  Liam does have <br/>
some small trepidation about spiders and bees, but nothing like what <br/>
I had as a kid.  And, because we&#39;re together a lot, I have to <br/>
opportunity to help him calm himself about it.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to be sure that he could see an adult living a life <br/>
that was not based on fear.  But, I also really wanted to be a person <br/>
who does not operate out of fear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re absolutely right. I have a lot of fears, a lot of insecurities,<br/>
and i&#39;m very sensitive right now. I am afraid my child will be cold in<br/>
he gets in the pool, afraid he will get cut if he climbs on the fence,<br/>
and afraid of not making the right choices as a parent. You guys<br/>
sharing your personal experiences and suggestions with me is<br/>
benefiting me greatly in learning to let go of fears and think<br/>
differntly. For instance, i saw that they choose not to get in the<br/>
pool and played with water balloons instead stopping to come get<br/>
wrapped in a towel when they were cold. I saw that my four year old<br/>
climbed on the fence over and over and didn&#39;t cut himself. And<br/>
although he had three juice boxes in a row the first day he only asked<br/>
for one yesterday. I had a talk with dh last night about it. My son is<br/>
no more likely to cut himself on the fence than to cut himself or<br/>
break an arm for that matter, falling out of a tree, off his bike, or<br/>
off of a tramoline. But i don&#39;t tell him not to climb trees or ride<br/>
his bike. My worries about his safety are still the same, but i cope<br/>
with them internally and watch him do what he has fun doing. I need to<br/>
learn to handle the things that have been less excepted in my mind the<br/>
same way. It&#39;s just hard to see at first that things you previously<br/>
thought were good parenting techniques in fact are not. From my<br/>
previous point of view i would be being a neglectful mother to let my<br/>
children do things i thought i knew better about. This is because i<br/>
don&#39;t want my children to suffer. It&#39;s taking time to see that they<br/>
may be suffering more because of the limitations i put on their lives<br/>
to help me cope with my own fears. There are still just a lot of<br/>
things about this that seem confusing to me, and i feel it doesn&#39;t<br/>
help when one person will just post over and over again that my kids<br/>
need me more. I realize they need me more. What i need help with is<br/>
understanding how to do that and make it workable in life. I feel that<br/>
sometimes Sandra cuts down my questioning, and lack of understanding<br/>
as though the answer is so straightforward and simple. Okay, they need<br/>
me more, i get that point. But sometimes the answers seem to<br/>
contradict each other. For instance, how does a woman manage to turn<br/>
off the cooking and go play when she has seven kids that may all want<br/>
something differnt for dinner? Not that i have seven children myself,<br/>
but i do have two and dh to make dinner for at night, and i can see<br/>
how solutions like pop some frozen dinners in the oven is a workable<br/>
solution for me, for certain times, but what if everyone is crying at<br/>
you that they all want something different, they are hungry now, and<br/>
they don&#39;t want to let you alone long enough to make it. I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine how an amazing lady with seven kids manages. It&#39;s not that i<br/>
just don&#39;t want to accept the answers, it&#39;s just that i am confused,<br/>
and afraid of how it will actually work out in practice. This is new<br/>
and strange to me and i feel that i benefit more from others sharing<br/>
how they manage to do it than being told my children need me more. I&#39;m<br/>
already trying to be here for them more and in new ways. I do greatly<br/>
aprreciate ALL of the suggestions EVERYONE has made so far that relate<br/>
to helping me figure out how to change. I already realize i need to<br/>
change, that&#39;s not the part i need help with. I do think you&#39;ve put a<br/>
finger on a large part of it for me. I need to get past my fears and<br/>
not project them onto my children and other people.</div>

Don&#39;t make it about me.  Let&#39;s talk about the simple answer.<br/>
<br/>
The simple answer is to set your priorities so that your children  <br/>
come first.  Not their future or imagined safety, but them NOW.   <br/>
Feelings and communications NOW.  What do they want or need NOW?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re living in a flurry if imagined disaster and woe, you&#39;re not  <br/>
even here now.<br/>
<br/>
Simply stop the other things and be with your child directly, eyes to  <br/>
eyes, without a thousand thoughts in your head about what else you  <br/>
could/should/might be doing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How does a circus manager turn off cooking when an elephant is loose  <br/>
and the train is coming and the bill collector is at the door?<br/>
<br/>
Making up a hypothetical worse story might seem to make your own  <br/>
situation simpler and more justifiable, but it&#39;s a way for you to do  <br/>
something besides be with your child, directly and calmly and simply  <br/>
attentive in the moment.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Are they doing that?  You&#39;ve slipped into another stressful &quot;what if&quot;  <br/>
scenario.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has had direct and personal attention, he won&#39;t be hungry  <br/>
and wanting something different at the same time everyone else, the  <br/>
imaginary seven kids, the elephant and the bill collector all want  <br/>
something else at the same time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
<br/>
There are the typical days many unschooling moms sent in.  Lots of  <br/>
them wrote about little kids.  I don&#39;t think many of the days  <br/>
involved automobile travel.<br/>
<br/>
Those are examples of how it works out in practice.<br/>

Very often people come here thinking they know what they need or what  <br/>
will help them, only to find in retrospect that if they had stopped  <br/>
writing so much and taken some of the earliest advice they received,  <br/>
they would have started making progress days or weeks or months  <br/>
earlier.  It happens frequently.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That is exactly the part you need help with.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I need to get past my fears and<br/>
not project them onto my children and other people.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That is the change you need to make.   But before you work on getting  <br/>
past your fears, and as a part of that work, be with your children.   <br/>
 From what you see working with them, and from the changes you see in  <br/>
them, your fears will start to dissolve.<br/>
<br/>
Here are two things on how people &quot;got it,&quot; got unschooling and the  <br/>
things they were reading but not understanding.<br/>

<br/>
Put your children first even right now, as you&#39;re angry with me for  <br/>
what you somehow see as keeping you from getting what you need.    <br/>
This is about your kids, not about you, or me.  Your children need  <br/>
you to be a gentle, peaceful, attentive, mindful way.  You can do it,  <br/>
but not while you&#39;re arguing about whether you can do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616356513">That would be me...LOL! I appreciate the descriptive, but amazing  <br/>
probably isn&#39;t the way it really is. Last night we ate dinner at 9pm.  <br/>
The kids were fine, they were happy because I had spent the day with  <br/>
them, and they had snacks to help them wait. I have a ton of  <br/>
solutions for how to cook for a large family on a different type of  <br/>
schedule, cleaning, etc, if you&#39;re truly interested. I can email you  <br/>
privately if you really want suggestions, or should we take up space  <br/>
on the board with it? maybe it would make a good set of posts for  <br/>
reference (Sandra, you&#39;re the list owner, what do you think?)<br/>
And I can honestly say that we have never had an instance where all  <br/>
seven kids want something different. On days when it&#39;s heading  <br/>
towards that, we have buffet night, with bowls and platters of  <br/>
leftovers or taco makings or burger and hotdog stuff. My toughest  <br/>
thing has been changing our meals to deal with a wheat allergy and a  <br/>
corn allergy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not talking about you here - this is what I went through.  Maybe you can<br/>
see some of yourself here - maybe not.  I saw a lot of me in what you wrote.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I quit working when my oldest was 6 and her sister was 4 to be a full-time<br/>
mom.  I was home all day with them - 24/7.  They slept in our bed.  We were<br/>
always together.  I did things with them - mostly always things I liked to<br/>
do.  I love books so I read to them.  I liked coloring so I colored with<br/>
them.  I drew pictures with them.  (A lot of I&#39;s there)  But there were lots<br/>
of things they liked to do that weren&#39;t &#39;my cup of tea&#39;.  They loved Power<br/>
Rangers - I didn&#39;t.  They loved digging up bugs - I didn&#39;t.  They loved<br/>
playing make believe games - I didn&#39;t.  But I thought that way okay - they<br/>
needed to learn to play on their own - they couldn&#39;t always depend on me to<br/>
provide entertainment.  Plus, I had a house to run, and keeping the<br/>
household running smoothly and clean was fundamental to us being a happy<br/>
family  But, still, I was with them all day and I did do things with them.<br/>
I was always within earshot.  But what I wasn&#39;t doing was really, truly<br/>
engaging with them.  Even when I was reading to them or coloring with them,<br/>
my mind was on what &#39;needed to be done&#39;.  Did I take meat out of the<br/>
freezer?  The laundry needed folded.  Dishwasher unloaded.  There wasn&#39;t<br/>
enough hours in the day, and I was tired.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was there physically but not mentally.  I was pre-occupied with everything<br/>
I thought was so important, so necessary.  And you know what, kids know<br/>
that.  I think they figured out that the housework, etc. was more important<br/>
than they were.  Of course, if asked, I would have said my kids were way<br/>
more important than housework or whatever, but that wasn&#39;t what I was<br/>
showing them.  I couldn&#39;t understand why they were so loud, rambunctious,<br/>
unruly, destructive.  I was there.  I was home.  I was doing the right<br/>
thing.  I made the big sacrifice to quit a good job and stay home.  But<br/>
being with them physically in the same house, even playing with them if your<br/>
mind is on what isn&#39;t getting done,  isn&#39;t the same as being mindfully,<br/>
wholly present with them, truly engaging with them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What is fundamental to a happy, healthy family is making sure their needs<br/>
are being met.  Yes, they need fed, and clean clothes and sheets and the<br/>
floor not so dirty you stick to it when you walk across it.  But, you know<br/>
what I found out?  Once I started putting their emotional needs, their<br/>
feelings first - really being there for them when they need me - dinner<br/>
still got on the table, the laundry still gets done, the floor isn&#39;t any<br/>
dirtier than before.  It gets done.  Now if my twins (5 yrs old) need me<br/>
while I&#39;m cooking, I put it on simmer or I put them up on the kitchen<br/>
counter so we can talk while I finish up.  I cover the meat with foil to<br/>
keep it warm and go see what they want to show me - those worms she<br/>
collected right now might not be important tomorrow - they&#39;re important<br/>
today.  Most of the work (understanding that if you&#39;re deep frying<br/>
something, that is immediate) will wait.  But children don&#39;t.  There are<br/>
only so many hours in a day, and we never get them back.  I&#39;m sorry for<br/>
every hour I missed with my older ones.  I&#39;m sorry for the things that they<br/>
could have taught me, but I was too busy worrying about everything else that<br/>
could go wrong.  I&#39;m so sorry for the times I snuggled with them but I was<br/>
thinking about that damn laundry.  We&#39;re okay now.  Not perfect but getting<br/>
better all the time.  Even when they&#39;re 16 and 14 when they need you, they<br/>
need you then - not tomorrow - at that moment.  Sometimes that&#39;s at midnight<br/>
with a cup of tea and some pie crust cookies.  I just sleep later the next<br/>
morning.  (My babies are 5 now so I don&#39;t have to get up as early.)  It<br/>
passes so fast.  What a joy it is to be able to be their partner, to help<br/>
them get where they want to go, to see the excitement on their face when the<br/>
climb the big willow tree and I&#39;m there to keep them safe so they can do it.<br/>
Such a privilege.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is where I&#39;ve been.  If it helps, good.  If not, please don&#39;t<br/>
be offended.  Just my ideas.<br/>
<br/>

choose to be here now with them in their world things will become<br/>
better than they are right now. I am really quite a bit the way you<br/>
are talking that you used to be. I might be reading books or playing<br/>
with flash cards, but i am thinking about the laundry and the dishes.<br/>
Sharing of personal experiences like this really helps.</div>

Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] putting my feet in the water<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I started going through this and responding to each point, but I <br/>
realized that there was an overall feel to your post, your need, your <br/>
exhaustion that I wanted to respond to. You sound so tired. You write of<br/>
<br/>
being afraid of what will happen if you step away from timeouts and <br/>
countdowns to spankings. You write THEIRS in shouting capitals and write<br/>
<br/>
i in lower case tiny letters.<br/>
<br/>
You sound so tired and so angry. When I was pregnant with Linnaea, my <br/>
second child, I was tired. I was grouchy. I didn&#39;t have a lot of <br/>
patience. I was working part time when I was pregnant which felt like <br/>
the only time when I got a break. And I felt horribly guilty for <br/>
enjoying the break. For enjoying being able to go over to the cafeteria <br/>
on the Fridays when I went into the VA and get a coke and just sit at my<br/>
<br/>
computer and work without any distractions. It was lovely to be all on <br/>
my own. I&#39;ve never really felt that way at any other time. I&#39;ve enjoyed <br/>
the luxury of walking quickly to the shops or of not having to be <br/>
slightly vigilantly aware of where everyone is when going somewhere <br/>
else, but I enjoyed the &quot;just me time&quot; when I was pregnant with Linnaea <br/>
more than I ever have before or since. I&#39;m not suggesting that you need <br/>
&quot;me time&quot; with your pregnancy in the same way that I did, but maybe you <br/>
are tired. Maybe, as this parasitic growth inside you gets closer and <br/>
closer to birth, and is taking more and more from you to support her <br/>
life, you have less to give to your other dependents. Maybe you need to <br/>
schedule in your day pick me ups, little energy boosts of a banana <br/>
milkshake or an energy bar or 10 minutes of you and a cup of tea and <br/>
some cookies. Maybe you need to think about what really needs to get <br/>
done in a day. Maybe you could fix a bunch of freezable meals when your <br/>
husband is around that you could just pop in the oven or microwave for <br/>
the days when he isn&#39;t around, so that you don&#39;t have to choose between <br/>
being with your children and standing at the stove. Maybe you could get <br/>
a crock pot and cook dinner all day and not have to spend a particular <br/>
time stuck to the stove. Maybe if you have to cook you could set up <br/>
something for the boys to do while you are cooking, a video or a game or<br/>
<br/>
time on the computer or something that would keep them entertained so <br/>
that you don&#39;t have to feel pulled in to many directions. Maybe you <br/>
could order pizza on the nights when you just can&#39;t cope anymore. Or buy<br/>
<br/>
a few frozen ones to have as back up for when baseball was too <br/>
distracting to keep you standing at the stove.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what you &quot;have&quot; to do. I don&#39;t know what things in your <br/>
house are piling up from one day to the next. If I don&#39;t get done what I<br/>
<br/>
want to on one day it doesn&#39;t feel that bad to address it the next. Are <br/>
there ways that you can make your required labor less intense. Buy some <br/>
boxes on wheels to toss toys into when you need to clean up the living <br/>
room. Soak dishes overnight and do the dishes in the morning. Try and <br/>
minimize how much you feel you need to do.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t good that they are breaking windows or that they are breaking <br/>
things that are yours. Maybe if you give them something they can play <br/>
with in the house when they are trying to use something that will break <br/>
or will break other things they won&#39;t respond so angrily. Simon just got<br/>
<br/>
an indoor frisbee &quot;called a Superang&quot; for his birthday. Pillows are <br/>
usually pretty good, oh, Simon discovered a while ago that a tam, little<br/>
<br/>
round knitted hat that lies flat when it isn&#39;t worn, makes a great <br/>
indoor frisbee. You could talk to them about why it isn&#39;t okay to play <br/>
with certain things in the house. Simon got this cool electronic circuit<br/>
<br/>
building set for Christmas that has, among other things, a spinning disc<br/>
<br/>
that you build a launcher for. One of the paintings in our house got <br/>
chipped by the disc, and so it isn&#39;t something that we use in the living<br/>
<br/>
room unless I&#39;ve draped a blanket over the painting.  If something is <br/>
important to you that it not be broken you might want to make sure that <br/>
it isn&#39;t accessible. If they want to go in the pool when you think it is<br/>
<br/>
too cold, get lots of towels and be prepared to warm them up, make some <br/>
hot chocolate or give them a nice warm bath or shower when they are <br/>
done. Maybe you could take them to a heated indoor pool. A friend <br/>
mentioned that a Holiday Inn near us (in Newcastle, so I don&#39;t know if <br/>
you can do this in the U.S.) lets you use their pool and jacuzzi for 5 <br/>
pounds a person, or something, maybe you could go there. Or maybe you <br/>
could book a night at a local hotel and stay over, watching new <br/>
television and swimming in the pool and enjoying the continental<br/>
breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
Juice boxes, buy more. Buy more when you go shopping so that they have <br/>
lots and lots to drink. If you can&#39;t afford to buy more, than make that <br/>
something that you talk about. Have them help you figure out what to buy<br/>
<br/>
at the grocery store. If they choose to splurge on the exciting new <br/>
foods you just got from the grocery store, that is pretty normal. All <br/>
the good fruit goes really quickly around here. And fresh bread is <br/>
always more appealing than day old bread. And when it is gone you can <br/>
write it on the list for the next grocery run. At some point the thing <br/>
that was an exciting splurge will change. Chips last far longer than <br/>
strawberries around here. Chips are common, strawberries, good spring <br/>
strawberries, are rare, and so get eaten very, very quickly. Artichokes <br/>
and edamame and good apple juice and soy milk at the moment are things <br/>
that disappear, but we have a box filled with tic tacs (cinnamon which <br/>
I&#39;ve only found in one place here, so we bought the store out) and <br/>
starbursts and hohos (cadbury mini rolls really) and gum and coke bottle<br/>
<br/>
candy and wine gums and a bunch of other stuff that has been there for <br/>
at least a month and that I&#39;ll have to go through soon to throw out what<br/>
<br/>
is stale or melted or gross. Phish food ice cream goes pretty quickly, <br/>
but the Fossil Fuel just hasn&#39;t moved. But it takes a while to trust <br/>
that what you like will be there when you want it. And if you have <br/>
equated being good with getting a certain treat, like juice boxes or a <br/>
candy bar, than those things taste of more than just a candy bar or a <br/>
juice box. And it may take a while for that unintentional raise in value<br/>
<br/>
to dissipate, for food to taste like food instead of like praise or <br/>
punishment. Linnaea is right now, this very minute, playing with her <br/>
friend for whom chocolate is the most amazing food. She isn&#39;t allowed <br/>
free access to chocolate. So when she comes over we stock up, and <br/>
Linnaea, for whom right now, this very minute, fitting in is very <br/>
important, will try and mirror her consumption of chocolate. But she <br/>
can&#39;t. She just doesn&#39;t need it in the same way as her friend needs it. <br/>
So, she eats what she can and then gets to share what she couldn&#39;t and <br/>
didn&#39;t want to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I think, though, the first thing I would look at if I were in your shoes<br/>
<br/>
is how much being pregnant has made you weary. I would think about how <br/>
big and how heavy I felt and how feeling that way might be coloring my <br/>
vision of the rest of the world. Being pregnant is hard work, and its <br/>
constant and it doesn&#39;t help you to sleep at night. Try and give <br/>
yourself permission to let go of housework and other things right now. <br/>
Try and take the time to breathe and relax and not feel everything <br/>
mounting around you in some sort of Sarah Sylvia Cynthia Stout who would<br/>
<br/>
not take the garbage out kind of way <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597716575"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You are still making it out as though you assume i don&#39;t spend time<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with my kids and i just like to throw their mistakes up in their<br/>
faces. No, i wouldn&#39;t hope they got cold. That&#39;s ridiculous to assume.<br/>
Not wanting them to be cold would be my reasoning for not wanting them<br/>
in the pool in the first place. I just really don&#39;t appreciate that<br/>
type of response. I have been staying home since my first son was<br/>
born, and i have been an attentive parent. A window can get broken<br/>
when you are in the room. And my point about being pregnant had<br/>
nothing to do with cooking, it was an example of a way that i&#39;m<br/>
limited right now in what i can do with my children. My doctor would<br/>
tell me not to lift them, that is a limitation. I don&#39;t think letting<br/>
myself get hit in the stomache with a baseball or bat by accident<br/>
would be a good idea either. I really wish you could just keep harsh<br/>
assumptions to yourself. I want my children to learn and grow, and<br/>
everything about my parenting does not revolve around my ego as you<br/>
seem to assume it does. I didn&#39;t ask those questions sarcastically<br/>
just to test the responses i would get. I asked about things that were<br/>
real concerns of mine yesterday when i started trying to do<br/>
this.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I agree that Sandra and some others can be harsh, assuming, and<br/>
accusing.  <br/>
I try not to post very much and just read, because I get too personally<br/>
offended.<br/>
