LOOKING BACKWARD AT THE RISE OF THE PUBLIC FAMILY<br/>
<br/>
Looking back over the last century, most scholars would<br/>
assign the rise of the Public Family System to the<br/>
early decades of the 21st century. Although a number of<br/>
developments in the 20th century forshadowed the Public<br/>
Family--especially the Public Education System and<br/>
widespread daycare--it was really the economic changes<br/>
surrounding the Second Energy Crisis of 2010-2013 that<br/>
caused a cascade of events, in which it is possible to<br/>
discern the true rise of the Public Family.<br/>
<br/>
Early in the century, a series of rolling blackouts<br/>
forced businesses to move to a 3 shift, 24-hour<br/>
economic model. Many families with two wage earners<br/>
found husband and wife both working at night. No<br/>
longer able to work, sleep, *and* care for their<br/>
children, many families turned to the burgeoning<br/>
Nightcare industry to provide parenting expertise. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parental authority&quot;, already undermined by public<br/>
education and displaced by the public servants<br/>
(educators and advertisers) who managed the child&#39;s<br/>
peer group, was joined by &quot;parental affection&quot;, which<br/>
was now confined to a few hours of visitation a week.<br/>
The interest of children in their biological parents<br/>
changed to fit the societal realities of their lives.<br/>
Although the &quot;Family&quot; lived on in public mythology, the<br/>
reality was that approximately one-third of a whole<br/>
generation of children grew up who had been raised<br/>
almost entirely by public servants.<br/>
<br/>
A two-tiered economic system developed, in which middle<br/>
class couples worked two jobs in order to pay for<br/>
private daycare, education, and nightcare, while poorer<br/>
families managed as they always had, using an informal<br/>
network of family and friends to get by less and less<br/>
well--with occasional tragedies involving children<br/>
confined to their cribs and left alone by desperate parents.<br/>
<br/>
During the 2020s, a series of crises transformed the<br/>
emerging Public Family system. A wave of hysteria<br/>
followed the highly publicized case of a child<br/>
affectionately known to millions as &quot;Baby Theresa&quot;.<br/>
Baby Theresa&#39;s biological single mother worked two<br/>
shifts and the third as a hooker to pay for their<br/>
one-room apartment and to support her amphetimine<br/>
habit. The Energy Independence Act of 2015 had already<br/>
introduced government-subsidies for Nightcare. In the<br/>
Baby Theresa case, the combined public fears of<br/>
widespread addiction to amphetimines among workers and<br/>
a fear of unfit mothers led to the legal placement of<br/>
Baby Theresa and other children in the government<br/>
system, and the establishment of &quot;parental standards&quot;<br/>
comparable to those in effect in the government-<br/>
regulated Nightcare/Daycare industry.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the 2020s and early 2030s, government<br/>
regulation increased for both Public and Private<br/>
Families. Richer families employed new categories of<br/>
professionals such as parent-evaluators alongside the<br/>
long list of tax accountants, lawyers, teachers,<br/>
doctors, and so forth already needed to run a household<br/>
and raise children. The burden of raising a Private<br/>
Family and demostrating compliance with parental<br/>
standards increased so that the practice began to<br/>
decline. Wherever private parents met, jokes about the<br/>
horrors of &quot;portfolio audits&quot; were exchanged.<br/>
Enthusiastic private parents joined their local Parent-<br/>
Government Partnership Program (PGPPs).<br/>
<br/>
Private Families still continued to be common among<br/>
some conservative Catholics and the more radical<br/>
Protestant churches. But mainstream churches, by and<br/>
large, tended to support pro-Family policies. These<br/>
churches had long been effectively arms of the<br/>
government, as they administered the charity programs,<br/>
pastoral care programs, and church-run<br/>
Daycare/Nightcare centers needed to support three-shift<br/>
working families. These programs, administered by the<br/>
Department of Faiths, provided government matching<br/>
funds to churches that complied with government<br/>
guidelines on hiring practices, inclusivity standards,<br/>
revised their scriptures and teaching to be compliant<br/>
with hate-suppression guidelines, and had a certified<br/>
pro-family policy.<br/>
<br/>
During the troubled 2030s, &quot;The Great Rollback&quot;, social<br/>
tensions increased alongside agitation for expanding<br/>
the Public Family System. President Al Bush-Kennedy (a<br/>
scion of several famous political families) and his<br/>
wife &quot;Tupper Bird&quot; were the first husband/wife team to<br/>
serve four consecutive terms from 2033-2048. During the<br/>
third Bush-Kennedy administration, their comprehensive<br/>
social program, called &quot;The New Cradle,&quot; finally made<br/>
the advantages of the Public Family System available to<br/>
all, whether economically disadvantaged or not. <br/>
<br/>
Orphanages, Juvenile Delinquent homes, &quot;Totalcare<br/>
Centers&quot; (Daycare/Nightcare/School/Hospital/Nursing<br/>
Home), were all merged and rationalized in a single<br/>
administration, The Department of Family. The Family<br/>
Security Tax was introduced to allow all workers to<br/>
contribute to the support of children. In return, the<br/>
government sent parents pictures and letters from<br/>
&quot;their&quot; children. Parents could apply to the Department<br/>
of Family to receive children matching their<br/>
specifications as closely as possible.<br/>
<br/>
The New Cradle required bypassing the opposition of the<br/>
now discredited U.S. Supreme Court, where a cadre of<br/>
conservative justices tried to block the new pro-Family<br/>
Reforms. But, as supporters of the New Cradle pointed<br/>
out, a legal system based on Common Law was inherently<br/>
Anti-Family, so it could hardly be expected to reform<br/>
itself. The U.S. Constitution was amended so that a<br/>
two-thirds majority of both Houses, with the<br/>
concurrence of the co-Presidents, could override any<br/>
court decision. These years also saw the demise of the<br/>
hated Electoral College system, and the integration of<br/>
&quot;Local&quot; and &quot;State&quot; governments and their respective<br/>
courts into departments of the Federal government. The<br/>
reduced waste and redundancy greatly improved the<br/>
efficiency of governing.<br/>
<br/>
During the Great Rollback and Second Gulf War that<br/>
followed it, it became commonplace for spouses to work<br/>
in different parts of the country.  Competing in a<br/>
global economy was tough, but America rose to the<br/>
occasion by creating the most mobile economy in the<br/>
world.  Without children, parents could work anywhere,<br/>
anytime.  The 2050s are looked on as a sort of Golden<br/>
Age, in which happy Public Families worked hard and<br/>
patriotically to make American Corporations once again<br/>
the most profitable in the world.<br/>
<br/>
But behind the glowing happy faces in the holo-movies,<br/>
trouble was brewing.  Spouses who never saw each other<br/>
and had no children were beginning to doubt their<br/>
identification with the social values and constructs<br/>
known as &quot;parenting&quot;.  For at least a generation,<br/>
the primary relationship between spouses had been over<br/>
the Net.  One of the key reforms of The New Cradle had<br/>
been 20 minute conjugal breaks for life-partners who<br/>
had not seen each other in at least 7 days due to work<br/>
schedules, both of whom were employed by companies with over<br/>
50 workers.  (Conjugal breaks were not conducted in<br/>
person, of course.  Sex in person was no longer the<br/>
norm, as most persons used Personal Companion Devices<br/>
[PCDs] connected to the Net.)<br/>
<br/>
The suicide rate, hidden drug addiction, and<br/>
psychological disorders were symptoms of a deeper<br/>
underlying problem--the self-image of Parenthood<br/>
imposed by society on its members. After a series of<br/>
powerful books, such as _The Parental Mystique_ and<br/>
_Silent Crib_, the Parent Liberation Movement was born.<br/>
Bonding Partners were to let go of the confining social<br/>
roles implied by an unattainable ideal of parenthood.<br/>
The movement stressed that Parenthood was not an ideal,<br/>
but a trap that denied the essential personal autonomy<br/>
of the partner, and insisted on an unfair, unattainable<br/>
role model of self-sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
The 2060s saw a number of countercultural movements.<br/>
The &quot;Back to Bed&quot; movement, commonly known as &quot;The<br/>
Humpers,&quot; attempted to re-introduce same-place sex.<br/>
Although they added a certain ambiance to the decade,<br/>
the Humpers had little impact in the long run, as their<br/>
ideals were impractical and two-parent child rearing<br/>
did not leave enough time to earn the income to make it<br/>
feasible. Few corporations were prepared to hire<br/>
workers who wished to remain together, or who were<br/>
unavailable on demand because they were raising<br/>
children in their spare time. The Humpers did, however,<br/>
develop an underground network of mid-Nannies to assist<br/>
in homeparenting, and also The Semen League to assist<br/>
with artificial insemination for parents who were<br/>
forced to return to work in separate cities before<br/>
starting their families.<br/>
<br/>
A more enduring impact of the 2060s came from the<br/>
non-violent Family Rights movement, which addressed the<br/>
inequalities between the Public Family System and the<br/>
Private Family System. The triumphal &quot;Great War on<br/>
Elitism&quot; was eventually followed, in the 2070s, by<br/>
Affirmative Parenthood, in which the remaining private<br/>
families (the richest 10% of the population) were<br/>
obliged to send some of their children to the Public<br/>
Family System, unless they agreed to forgo the Governement<br/>
subsidies for Private Families. Most private families<br/>
who could chose to pay the Family Security Tax and<br/>
forgo the subsidies, but keep their children.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of the upheavals of the 2060s and 2070s, a<br/>
new movement begain to coalesce. At first it was<br/>
largely illegal, but slowly gaining support. The<br/>
&quot;homefamily movement&quot; advocated &quot;taking back our kids&quot;<br/>
and raising them in a parented home. Two rather<br/>
diverse groups pioneered the homefamily movement. On<br/>
the one hand there were religious fringe groups like<br/>
Neo-Roman Catholics** and some extreme Protestants, who<br/>
had always covertly raised children, often while the<br/>
government turned a blind eye to the practice. The<br/>
other group giving initial support to the homefamily<br/>
movement were leftovers from the &quot;Natural Family&quot;<br/>
movements of the 2060s. They were commonly derided as<br/>
&quot;Kid Huggers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
** To be distinguished from the more numerous and<br/>
government-approved American Catholics.<br/>
<br/>
The 2080s are mostly remembered for the return of the<br/>
Public Family System to the private sector. Private<br/>
enterprise has always been more effecient at raising<br/>
children than the Government could be. After her<br/>
landslide victory in the election of 2080, President<br/>
Hunt-Rockefeller (&quot;The Great Liberator&quot;) started a<br/>
program of privatized parenting. Corporations, which<br/>
had already contributed to the daycare and nightcare of<br/>
infants and ran the privatized &quot;public&quot; schools,<br/>
brought the efficiency of the marketplace to parenting.<br/>
Biological parents received vouchers for their children<br/>
allowing them to place the children in any corporate<br/>
program they wished, provided the child met the<br/>
standards for and was accepted by that program.<br/>
<br/>
The profound interest of private business in the<br/>
outcome of childrearing--today&#39;s children are<br/>
tomorrow&#39;s workers--guaranteed the best upbringing for<br/>
all children. Companies were able to achieve<br/>
unparalleled loyalty in the workplace, as well as<br/>
efficient assignment to jobs. After all, with access to<br/>
the best testing technology and years worth of<br/>
documentation for each potential worker, they could<br/>
hardly make mistakes. A lively marketplace also<br/>
developed whereby companies could exchange workers in a<br/>
fair and economically efficient way, for whatever the<br/>
market would bear. This benefited both the workers, who<br/>
were placed in the job most fitting their talents, and<br/>
the company, which could manage cost reduction<br/>
flexibly.<br/>
<br/>
As we look forward to the 22nd century, from our<br/>
vantage point in the late 2090s, a number of trends are<br/>
apparent. The natural trend of societal evolution<br/>
suggests that we have travelled from Public Education<br/>
to Public Family. I would like to suggest that beyond<br/>
this lies an even more glorious system, the Public<br/>
Individual. In both the case of Public Education and<br/>
the Public Family, the government supplied the critical<br/>
first steps, eventually turning the job over to the<br/>
private sector. Public policy could be brought to bear<br/>
so that harmful and dissident individuals, especially<br/>
those supporting the homefamily movement, could be<br/>
reformed and made to support socially productive goals.<br/>
Clearly the government cannot stand idle and allow<br/>
certain individuals, who have no proper training and no<br/>
economic stake in the future worker, to continue to<br/>
harm even one child and deprive industry of even one<br/>
worker by raising them improperly in--God forbid--their<br/>
own home. A Child is a Terrible Thing to Raise.<br/>
<br/>
Redistribution permitted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708812637">Helen, this was an interesting story.  It does make you think about the <br/>
direction of things in our society and wonder whether we&#39;re heading into a <br/>
better time or a worse one.  But homeschooling does give me hope...seeing it <br/>
catch on more and more with people who at one time thought it was bizarre.<br/>
     One other question...I&#39;m not getting any email from the group today and <br/>
I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s something I should do to make sure I wasn&#39;t <br/>
accidentally taken off (or it could just be more weirdness from AOL).  I did <br/>
get one private email...can someone email me directly and tell me if it&#39;s <br/>
just a quiet day on the list?  Thanks...<br/>
<br/>
