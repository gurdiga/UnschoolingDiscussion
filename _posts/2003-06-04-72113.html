<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538911162">Oh, We have a poster of Sully. Love that mountain man!!! Another is that cute <br/>
guy in Knight&#39;s Tale. Nita my oldest isn&#39;t here, so can&#39;t ask his name....we <br/>
watched that movie all winter! Ended up attending a Renaissance Faire because <br/>
of that. Boy did we get a good taste of history there. Like stepping back in <br/>
time! The food, music, all the clothes, games ,even the dialect... so cool. We <br/>
were really interested in the weapons.  We have done re-enacting, <br/>
colonial/pioneer Tennessee at the time of the first Govener,1796. The kids really got into <br/>
it.<br/>
