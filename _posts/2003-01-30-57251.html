<div id="ygrps-yiv-237465509">Hi!<br/>
  Wanted to share about a new website by Karen M. Gibson which features <br/>
various homeschooling articles (including one from me!) It&#39;s called Leaping <br/>
From the Box and the home page says <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; Articles and resources to assist home educators and homeschoolers who <br/>
&gt;&gt; desire to move beyond the &quot;cookie-cutter box&quot; mentality. Experience <br/>
&gt;&gt; learning and education as it should be!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The address is www.leapingfromthebox.com. It&#39;s a pretty new site and I&#39;m sure <br/>
Karen would love to hear from other unschoolers.<br/>
