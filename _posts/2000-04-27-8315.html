<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442465298">Hi Robyn and all<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I will jump in with you guys, Im 39 I have 7 children and we are driving <br/>
a <br/>
 Dodge Caravan, we definetly need a bigger van. I like the Astro or Safari&#39;s. <br/>
 Even better an Expedition. ( Ohh just dreaming.......)  Robyn<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You sound just like me, Robyn.  I&#39;m 38 with 7 children.  We have a big old <br/>
full-size Chevy van.  But, I repeat, it&#39;s VERY OLD and the driver&#39;s side <br/>
floorboard is rusting through and it has over 140K miles.  So, we&#39;re looking <br/>
too but everything is SOOO expensive and I hate pouring a lot of resources <br/>
into a vehicle!  But, I guess it&#39;s a necessary evil.  Especially when you <br/>
live in a rural area, like we do.  We also have a Honda Civic for commuting <br/>
which gets used a lot more than the van!  Take care!<br/>
