unschooling not to damage your kids the way schools do.&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Hey, I DID write an essay that&#39;s sort of on this topic! (Here&#39;s the <br/>
shameless self-promotion part ;-)) I&#39;m not sure what the phrase &quot;reinforce <br/>
dysfunction&quot; means, but I did write an article about my former attitudes <br/>
towards school, the damage done to my son, and the healing that unschooling <br/>
has brought. It&#39;ll be in the Nov/Dec issue of HEM. &lt;&lt;shamless plug, <br/>
shameless plug, shameless plug&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And yet, I still don&#39;t want to get into a *school sucks* discussion here. I <br/>
like to focus on the joy. THAT was the final point of my article.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
