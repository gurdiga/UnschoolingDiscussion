<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244994995">My 11 yr. old son has some minor speech problems (bad habits) and goes to<br/>
speech therapy once a week.  We practice at home about 4 times a week.  He<br/>
was making excellent progress unti we took a vacation and didn&#39;t practice<br/>
for several weeks.  He has lost some of the skills he had acquired and is<br/>
not making much progress.  His main problem is with  &quot;s.&quot;  He sticks his<br/>
tongue out between his teeth when he says it.  He needs to practice not<br/>
doing so.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is that he&#39;s not trying.  He doesn&#39;t seem to perceive<br/>
there is a problem,though now that he&#39;s regressed adults have a hard time<br/>
understanding him.<br/>
<br/>
My question is &quot;how can I help motivate him?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have decided I will no longer interpret what he says to adults.  My idea<br/>
is for him to experience their not understanding him so he realizes he has<br/>
a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Any other ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
