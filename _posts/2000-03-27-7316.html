<div id="ygrps-yiv-423423030">This is a very belated thank-you to all those kind souls who responded<br/>
to my request for HELP.  I had solicited advice and opinion regarding my<br/>
daughter&#39;s ongoing and seemingly benign cramps of the gut.  Though I am<br/>
aware that there don&#39;t seem to be solid answers to our problem, it is<br/>
very encouraging to hear others have been through it, no worse for wear.<br/>
Thanks for all the support!  I really appreciate knowing there&#39;s some<br/>
place to turn when you think you&#39;ve exhausted all other venues...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks EVERYBODY who came to my rescue!</div>
