<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633532558">Hi everyone,<br/>
 <br/>
This is my first time posting to the group.  I&#39;m in my 4th year at UC<br/>
Berkeley and I&#39;ve been wondering what I&#39;ll do when I get out.  I&#39;m<br/>
totally interested in alternative approaches to education - Sudbury<br/>
schools and unschooling, especially - so much so that I&#39;m facilitating a<br/>
student-led class entitled &quot;Never Taught to Learn&quot; this semester.  Also,<br/>
I love working with kids - I was an instructor at camp this summer which<br/>
confirmed that fact - and it&#39;s hard to imagine pursuing any other line<br/>
of work.  So, I got the idea a few days ago that a cool thing to do<br/>
after college would be to live with an unschooling family and act as a<br/>
mentor-brother.  My responsibilities would be to act as a role-model and<br/>
friend, primarily; beyond that I could take kids on neat trips like<br/>
museums or the zoo or out to town, I could play with them for hours on<br/>
end, I could help them find resources they need for whatever they are<br/>
pursuing, and on the whole become a part of the family.  It seems like<br/>
there could be a need for such a person since often both parents (or the<br/>
single parent) are away at work all day.<br/>
 <br/>
Does anyone know if live-in unschooling mentors exist, and if so, how<br/>
successful they are?  Is anyone looking for such a person?  How could I<br/>
find such a family?  Let me know-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127589421">Blake, I know an unschooler in Texas who is looking for someone exactly like you to live in as a nanny while she works.  If you know anyone in Texas who would like to do what you proposed, email me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-317797592">Blake, please don&#39;t take offense and we&#39;ll chalk this up to you being young and not <br/>
having children of your own and so not realizing the kinds of things parents often <br/>
must be concerned about, but, as one of the list owners, I feel the need to mention <br/>
that caution should be foremost in parents&#39; minds when somebody indicates a desire <br/>
to enter your home and get close to and care for your children. This is an email list <br/>
where anybody can say anything they want and pretend to be anybody and anything. <br/>
<br/>
I probably didn&#39;t need to say anything, but we tend to be a trusting bunch and &quot;I met <br/>
him on the unschooling list&quot; might sound like a recommendation if you passed this <br/>
along to another homeschooler, for example.<br/>
<br/>
So - just a little reminder to take reasonable care.<br/>
