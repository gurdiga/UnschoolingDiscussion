hanging out with you guys (uh, girls - sorry Ned)... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Anyway, I don&#39;t handle articles for HEM any more; haven&#39;t for 3-4 <br/>
years now. We have an articles editor, an excellent editor, but she&#39;s <br/>
been having some serious family medical difficulties this summer and <br/>
fell behind in replying to the enormous number of submissions we <br/>
receive. She&#39;s been working hard to catch up, but her sister gave her <br/>
and her husband a trip to Europe as a break from the stressful <br/>
medical situation, and they&#39;re over there right now, hopefully <br/>
relaxing and recuperating. I know she didn&#39;t get all the articles <br/>
reviewed before she left, but she&#39;ll be home after Labor Day and back <br/>
to going through the submissions. I assume your article is part of <br/>
that backlog, Mary, especially if it was submitted within the last <br/>
6-8 weeks.<br/>

&gt;more than I could handle. ;-))<br/>

please let me know and I&#39;ll check into it for you. And don&#39;t worry, <br/>
if Kim can&#39;t use it she&#39;ll send a kindhearted reply, and possibly <br/>
even offer to help you make it useable with suggested revisons, a <br/>
different angle, or some other ideas. She&#39;s really, really good at <br/>
working with writers, which is why she works for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-854483112">Mary,  I love reading your posts, was wondering if you would send me a copy of your article on video games and such.  I&#39;m new to this group but I&#39;m getting so much out of it!  I have to tell you, I quoted you, &#39;Life is good&#39;, on another board; I just feel like since we&#39;ve been unschooling it is so true!  Thanks.<br/>
