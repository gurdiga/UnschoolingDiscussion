<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062271575">We have to share with you that this AM our first ever peacock egg<br/>
hatched.  So exciting.  We have never tried this before.  We have<br/>
chickens, and ducks, but we&#39;ve never tried to incubate the eggs.  Some<br/>
friends have peacocks, and brought us these eggs.  The hen had pushed<br/>
them out of her nest, and while they were still warm, they brought them<br/>
to us and put them in the incubator.  We really didn&#39;t think they&#39;d<br/>
hatch.  We can hear peeping in another egg, so by tomorrow we should<br/>
have another.<br/>
There are six more eggs that won&#39;t be ready until mid month, as well as<br/>
some of our hens eggs.  You should have seen my kids faces.  They<br/>
discovered the baby, and they were so amazed.  Well, so was I!!!<br/>
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Unschooling at it&#39;s finest.  Isn&#39;t it great!<br/>
