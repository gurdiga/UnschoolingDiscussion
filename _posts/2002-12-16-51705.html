<div id="ygrps-yiv-581854150">Joyce, <br/>
<br/>
I find your advice valuable and useful.  I also think that you have the most <br/>
tact and courtesy of anyone who holds views opposing my own ( even though, I <br/>
think in reality, my views are at least 90% in agreement with other <br/>
unschoolers)  May I ask how you feel about how some of the others have <br/>
expressed thier views and opinions?  Do you not agree that some comments have <br/>
been WAY out of line? I offer you kudos for moderating this group. I know it <br/>
takes time and effort.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512203594">Just asking for a bit of advice re my MIL.<br/>
DH has invited her over from the UK to stay with us after Xmas. I&#39;m <br/>
dreading the whole thing. She is a high school teacher of physics <br/>
and thinks physics and maths is the pinnacle of academic <br/>
acheivement. As you can imagine she doesn&#39;t approve of <br/>
unschooling in any way, shape or form and thinks I&#39;m damaging my <br/>
kids and depriving them of oportunities to reach their full &#39;potential&#39; <br/>
in physics (ahem)<br/>
When I first took the kids out of school she said it wasa good idea <br/>
as I could then concentrate on their maths and physics as, in her <br/>
opinion, schools don&#39;t teach physics well enough for my kids to do <br/>
a physics degree. i did pick my jaw up from the floor and point out <br/>
that maybe they didn&#39;t want to become physicists but she accused <br/>
me of saying that just to be m,anipulative. So there the situation <br/>
stands.<br/>
She hears nothing that I say, continually &#39;tests&#39; the kids with <br/>
questions etc etc, not respecting their rights or my opinions. <br/>
Personally I wish she&#39;d never darken my doorstep again (she also <br/>
goes on about my weight, my unfashionable clothes, my hair) but <br/>
DH is eager for her to visit and she is his mother and the kids <br/>
grandmother.<br/>
Any tips for dealing with this ordeal (apart from duct taping her <br/>
mouth and sticking er in the closet....)<br/>
How have others answered relatives this thick-skinned?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Any tips for dealing with this ordeal (apart from duct taping her <br/>

How have others answered relatives this thick-skinned? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would fortify the kids with some practiced responses, tell them it&#39;s just <br/>
the way she is, and to just be nice to her and things will be back to calm <br/>
when she goes home.<br/>
<br/>
It might not bother them nearly as much as you&#39;re afraid it will.  (Or it <br/>
might, but they probably won&#39;t have the emotion and anxiety you have about <br/>
it.)<br/>
<br/>
My kids are kind of amused by their grandparents&#39; responses to them.  Most of <br/>
the tension is in my own irritation and resentment.  (Over the years, they <br/>
backed off.)<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely have some John Holt or Gatto for her to read, if she <br/>
&quot;seems interested&quot; (which can mean &quot;if she&#39;s being critical&quot;), and if she <br/>
refuses to read it, you can remind her, if she starts in on it, that if she&#39;d <br/>
read that she would understand your point of view better.<br/>

<br/>
My opinion is that it&#39;s my job to keep this list useful for listmembers. I<br/>
serve as a reminder to help people keep focused on what they presumably want<br/>
themselves: discussing unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I trust that people are self-aware enough to see what they&#39;ve done to derail<br/>
that goal and mature enough to self-correct. They do it on their own because<br/>
they want the forum to stay useful, not because they fear some punishment<br/>
from the authorities.<br/>
<br/>
There are people here I&#39;ve known on lists and message boards for years -- in<br/>
a professional unschooling volunteer capacity you might say :-). I know from<br/>
the quality of what they say and the hours they volunteer saying it that<br/>
they *are* here to discuss unschooling and help others unschool. I know they<br/>
aren&#39;t here to deliberately hurt people and trust that if they have said<br/>
something hurtful that they recognize their mistake and don&#39;t need someone<br/>
to pushish or reprimand them. I also am aware that some people&#39;s posting<br/>
styles get repeatedly misperceived as personal attack when it is, as they<br/>
say, discussion of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there are people who have goals other than or in addition to<br/>
discussing unschooling. So another part of my job is to look for patterns of<br/>
disruptive behavior that indicate goals that conflict and interfere with the<br/>
listmembers&#39; goals.<br/>
<br/>
Though as a moderator I can control *who* posts, none of us can control<br/>
*what* people post or *how* people post. I can only control what *I* post.<br/>
If someone posts something nasty -- or something I interpret as nasty -- I<br/>
get to choose how I respond. I can stoop to their level or I can be more<br/>
mature.<br/>
<br/>
I know the people here and they are really truly trying to be helpful and<br/>
are not making personal attacks and are discussing ideas. I also know<br/>
everyone is human and they make mistakes. But presumably we&#39;re all here to<br/>
discuss unschooling so we should refocus on that and get back to it. :-)<br/>

<time>16 Dec 2002, at  6:10am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829415594">How to deal with her depends on what you want:<br/>
<br/>
- If you want to force her to approve of you, then by all means<br/>
go at it hammer and tongs to prove to her that you are right<br/>
(though those convinced against their will are of the same<br/>
opinion still).<br/>
- If you want a peaceful and minimized conflict holiday season,<br/>
you might practice some gentle, deflecting comments - &quot;how<br/>
interesting that you think that&quot;  &quot;My, my, you don&#39;t say&quot; -<br/>
strategize with the kids too, emphasizing that this in not a<br/>
mission in making an old lady miserable, but a way of avoiding<br/>
tension<br/>
- If you want a closer relationship, with more respect, you might<br/>
plan a run out for coffee or some such early in the visit and a<br/>
frank, respectful conversation, full of &quot;when you do &quot;x&quot;, I feel<br/>
&quot;y&quot;&quot; rather than comments about how &quot;you do &quot;x&quot;, because you want<br/>
me to feel &quot;y&quot;&quot;  Practice with your husband who knows her better<br/>
than you do for likely gambits.<br/>
- If you want your husband to know just how much you are<br/>
suffering to be a &quot;good wife and D-i-L&quot;, play up every single<br/>
comment that could be seen as in anyway critical.<br/>
- and so on....<br/>

she badgers DD to stay thin (DD is really skinny and MIL is <br/>

Yeah,  Winter Carnival should be going at that time.   Although hopefully it will get colder or the Ice Palace will be a slush palace,  its been up in the 40&#39;s lately,  my snow is almost gone.      Done in Mpls/St.Paul there isn&#39;t any snow right now.   We need a dump!<br/>

&gt; Personally I wish she&#39;d never darken my doorstep again (she also <br/>
&gt; goes on about my weight, my unfashionable clothes, my hair) but <br/>
&gt; DH is eager for her to visit and she is his mother and the kids <br/>
&gt; grandmother.<br/>
&gt; Any tips for dealing with this ordeal (apart from duct taping her <br/>
&gt; mouth and sticking er in the closet....)<br/>
&gt; How have others answered relatives this thick-skinned?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here are some things that have worked for me, ymmv.<br/>
<br/>
For the testing of the kids, teach them in advance to take a turn asking a <br/>
question after she does.  She&#39;ll ask &quot;Can you tell me Newton&#39;s Laws?&quot;  <br/>
They&#39;ll either answer yes or no and then ask her something they are <br/>
interested in, like &quot;Have you ever seen what can happen to a marshmallow in a <br/>
fire?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When she goes on about you, just turn it back to her.  My sister is a pest <br/>
about a lot of things, primarily lately about my mending ankle.  She went on <br/>
and on yesterday about how she had broken her foot twice and how I really <br/>
needed to be doing this and that and why hadn&#39;t I gotten the doctor to do <br/>
this and that and yada, yada, yada.  I interrupted her with a short answer <br/>
and then said &quot;And how are YOU.&quot;  She loves talking about herself.  Ask you <br/>
mil how she does this or that and let her ramble on while you tune out.  If <br/>
she starts in on the nagging again, turn it back to her again.  She may never <br/>
get it, but you can learn to manipulate it.<br/>
<br/>
You could also conduct a discourse on the many positive influences of Allan <br/>
Rickman in your life...<br/>

that week. Y&#39;all can come ;-)**<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s brilliant!  Multiply the targets and drag in as many<br/>
allies as you can find.  With enough kids running in circles around her<br/>
she may get too dizzy to cause trouble.  And you are unlikely to attempt<br/>
to murder her in front of so many witnesses.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

**He&#39;s agreed to give her list of topics she may not broach which <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem the answer for me.**<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could spin this in a more positive way -- same list, but<br/>
change the title to &quot;topics guaranteed to start a fight w. Shyrley&quot;. <br/>
Then the ball is really in her court as to whether or not she wants to<br/>
fight.  It becomes more of a &quot;warning&quot; and less like a &quot;restraining<br/>
order&quot;.  With luck she&#39;ll decide that she PREFERS to have a pleasant visit.<br/>
<br/>
**(DD is really skinny and MIL is <br/>
jealous) filling her head with shit about overweight people being <br/>
scum.**<br/>
<br/>
Does this educated woman know anything about anorexia?  I recently read<br/>
some good articles (I think in back issues of Rosie).  One was about a<br/>
woman who had fertility treatments and gave birth to twins while<br/>
undereating.  The list of medical problems those children have is truly<br/>
tragic.  The same issue had an anorexia article about Jamie Lyn Siegler<br/>
(sp?) on the Sopranos.  Maybe the articles are available if you search<br/>
online?  If your mil won&#39;t *read* them, then roll them up and whack her<br/>
over the head with them!  Really!</div>

and she was jealous. Told me I looked better like that cos I was so <br/>
fat before (135 pounds)<br/>
My hair was falling out etc etc.<br/>
