I believe sometimes they get them at home. Also a lot of shootings are <br/>
accidental. My daughter had a friend in Santa Fe who was in a wheelchair <br/>
because she had been shot as a child by a brother or cousin fooling around <br/>
with a gun. Good guys vs. bad guys??? Just last month in Oakland, Ca. a <br/>
police officer was killed by two fellow officers by accident while he was <br/>
undercover.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405453323">Wellllll, I don&#39;t think anyone needs automatic weapons or handguns.  It is<br/>
interesting that folk who own guns are 22% more likely to injuried with a<br/>
gun.  And folks that have guns for &quot;protection&quot; are 75% more likely to be<br/>
injured by their own gun than by the supposed bad guys they are protecting<br/>
themselves from.<br/>
<br/>
One of the problems with guns is that we don&#39;t enforce the laws we have AND<br/>
we don&#39;t put rules on the books that will make a difference.  Folks who sell<br/>
guns illegally get a slap on the wrist, so why should they care if they are<br/>
providing guns to gang members and bad guys.  The number of illegal guns<br/>
coming over the borders is enormous!  Deal with that.<br/>
<br/>
AND, I won&#39;t shout but really want to, what about IDIOT police departments<br/>
that take the guns they have confiscated and then turn around and sell them!<br/>
Some of those guns have been traced through 3 or 4 criminal acts after being<br/>
sold by police departments!<br/>
<br/>
Also, the real origin of lots of guns used by the bad guys is the same folks<br/>
that bought them to protect themselves and then they were stolen.  Folks<br/>
don&#39;t do enough to keep guns safe and that includes safe from theft.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  Guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people; rage kills people. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, but if people with rage can&#39;t get guns they can&#39;t kill with them.<br/>
It<br/>
&gt; takes a lot more energy to kill some other. more physical way. -Amalia-&lt;&lt;<br/>
