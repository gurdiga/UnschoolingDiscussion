&gt; &gt; So being that I am new to the unschooling thing, is there anything else <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; I can do to help them to make the most of this trip?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julian has LOVED the Ranger programs we&#39;ve done at ational Parks. There are <br/>
also programs where you buy a little book and do some activities and go on a <br/>
program or two, and the kid gets a patc. These have been wonderful, because <br/>
each time the Ranger really acknowledges the kids. We&#39;ve really loved those.<br/>
