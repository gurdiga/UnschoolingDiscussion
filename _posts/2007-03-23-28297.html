<div id="ygrps-yiv-438336997">There&#39;s a name for God (Thor or Odin, I was going to ask my husband  <br/>
but he&#39;s not at his desk; how can he not be available whenever I need  <br/>
an answer about Norse mythology!?) from a thousand years ago,  <br/>
&quot;Allfather.&quot;  It&#39;s a cool word.    I like it.    And I thought of  <br/>
that when I wrote &quot;all-smart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other day Holly asked me what an average IQ was.  I said &quot;by  <br/>
definition, 100, but 95-105 is considered average, I think--but IQ  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean much anyway,  it&#39;s only measuring language, and...&quot; and  <br/>
she said &quot;Because my IQ is 101.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;No it isn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I realized I had stepped into where I didn&#39;t want to be.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So we talked about IQ a bit, and then I tried to extricate myself  <br/>
from it. &lt;bwg&gt;  She had taken some online IQ test.  I talked about  <br/>
multiple intelligences (which I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be doing until I die).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I bought a book<br/>
classical works produced by William F. Buckley, which uses the method<br/>
he found worked for him: every black-key note is printed in red.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s kind of  horrible!<br/>
<br/>
And it speaks to the idea of IQ.<br/>
<br/>
William F. Buckley is a virtuoso at word use.  It doesn&#39;t stop him  <br/>
that others don&#39;t know what those words mean, he just continues for  <br/>
the effect of intimidation, more than communication.  There&#39;s an  <br/>
element of The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes to it; if you can&#39;t see what he  <br/>
means, then you&#39;re an idiot.  If you say &quot;You&#39;re only talking to  <br/>
yourself, because no one else understands you,&quot; then you&#39;re a  <br/>
Philistine, ignorant, jealous.   So...<br/>
<br/>
So...  he&#39;s wealthy and he plays piano and he feels he&#39;s plainly,  <br/>
flatly, smarter than anyone around him (because he was always a  <br/>
verbal prodigy, and verbal is where it&#39;s at, IQ-wise).  So he thinks  <br/>
it will help everyone to have... black keys, really?  Not just all  <br/>
sharps and flats in a given key?   printed in red, like the words-of- <br/>
Christ-in-red editions of the Bible &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Musically, though, to have some notes in red will be confusing.  The  <br/>
red notes would still be on the same scale, the same proportions, the  <br/>
same relationships to the other notes.  So setting them apart like  <br/>
that will ONLY be a clue for piano, and not for any other  <br/>
instrument.  It&#39;s vandalistic to notation.<br/>
<br/>
But when I&#39;m playing something, if there&#39;s a note I keep missing  <br/>
because its a C sharp, for instance, and I&#39;m forgetting, I get a  <br/>
pencil and draw a diagonal line through the note.   Later I might  <br/>
erase it if it&#39;s distracting me or if I have it so well I just don&#39;t  <br/>
want others to think I was a baby and needed lines through my notes.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  (I&#39;ve rarely erased them, but could if I wanted to, because it&#39;s  <br/>
pencil.)<br/>
<br/>
It would make more sense to reprint books with all the silent letters  <br/>
in red, or something.  I think &quot;learn to read and stop whining,&quot;  <br/>
that&#39;s what I think.  If someone were to learn to read music by a  <br/>
method like that, they would be handicapped for reading the notation  <br/>
of the past 300 or however many years.<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re not accidentals when that&#39;s part of the key in which you&#39;re  <br/>
playing.  It&#39;s an accidental if you&#39;re in G and there&#39;s a C-sharp.   <br/>
If  you&#39;re in A, a C-sharp isn&#39;t an accidental.  It&#39;s &quot;a black key&quot;  <br/>

I didn&#39;t do it to other people&#39;s books.<br/>

reader.  And it ruins the book for others.<br/>

I don&#39;t mind getting a dictionary sometimes, and I LOVE words. The  <br/>
first book I ever bought with my own money was a dictionary.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I have to think that William F. Buckley isn&#39;t being  <br/>
an arrogant prick when he expects a million people to get a dictionary.<br/>

It&#39;s made me feel really icky, abit like how I feel if I know what my real weight is. Although very different because I know that IQ tests are not a gauge (I&#39;ve forgotten how to spell that word) on intelligence. Phew!<br/>
