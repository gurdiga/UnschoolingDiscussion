<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057770763">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
I am new here. We have two little ones 4 & 1 1/2. We are planning on <br/>
keeping them home. I have read several of the Holt books and saw a <br/>
post about some other recommended readings - it was within the text of <br/>
a response with a different title. I can&#39;t find it now. Can anyone <br/>
suggest some additional readings for a newbie? Thanks, Tonya in Boston</div>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling.info has a list on the main page, and then a folder with books <br/>
listed, some with reviews and commentary.   That forum is owned by Pam <br/>
Sorooshian, who is also one of the owners of this list.   There might be others here <br/>
who were unaware of these resources, so I&#39;m glad the question was asked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571184367">Nooo! I am looking away. I did not see a link to more books on <br/>
unschooling! More books on unschooling do not exist and are merely a <br/>
figment of my book addicted imagination.I am not going to have to live <br/>
in a tent in the garden. <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of insightful stuff on Sandra&#39;s website:<br/>
<br/>
www.sandradodd.com<br/>
<br/>
With a couple of kids, I figure reading one article at a time could be <br/>
easier than a whole book.  (And cheaper!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right.   Most of them are about learning or parenting.<br/>
You don&#39;t need ANY books on unschooling, anyway.   Just do it and if you have <br/>
questions read at Joyce&#39;s page or unschooling.info or come here and ask <br/>
questions.<br/>
