<div id="ygrps-yiv-53924994">Hey, all! The new episode is now up on the newly redesigned site! I&#39;ve<br/>
also added a blog to add links to articles, sites and programs I find<br/>
while surfing around, and a place for folks to sign up for email updates.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to try out more with the animation idea - something a<br/>
little simpler than my original idea to start with. Has anyone seen<br/>
the new show &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;? Basically, they record real people<br/>
talking about a topic. No scripts, just different groups sharing their<br/>
real opinions. Then they take the voices and add animated clay animals<br/>
speaking the words. I&#39;d like to try something like that.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids (of any age) are interested, have them send me a sound<br/>
file where they talk about their favorite game -- be it a board game,<br/>
sport, card game, video game, whatever! They can talk about WHY it&#39;s<br/>
their favorite game, or they can describe what it&#39;s about or explain<br/>
to others briefly how to play it. Hopefully this will provide some<br/>
good results and be a fun experience for the kids who are part of it,<br/>
as well as entertaining to those watching.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who has visited! Hope to hear from you soon!<br/>
