Public and Private Schools and Homeschooling (PPSP-H) is a <br/>

to public and private school programs which are directed at and <br/>
marketed to homeschooling families. This is an open list, welcoming <br/>
participants from all sides of the issue. Please respect differences <br/>
of opinion.<br/>
