<div id="ygrps-yiv-929866283">I definetly would have bought it! Still would! Unschooling for us in the <br/>
beginning was soooo hard because we had already been conditioned by ps.<br/>
WE are still going through the deschooling, but everything seems to be <br/>
falling into place without much effort, and I dont worry as much :). I leave <br/>
that to my parents and my sisters :)<br/>

Carrie, I suppose it would depend if the book agreed <br/>
with my POV on the whole thing!  And it&#39;s always hard <br/>
for parents, for example, to tell someone who might be <br/>
objecting to say &#39;here, read this,&#39; at least I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
want to tell someone else what to read!  It sounds a <br/>
good idea in principle, but might have a very limited <br/>
audience, perhaps.  Actually, I&#39;m going tomorrow to a <br/>
book &#39;launch&#39; (it&#39;s third :-) ) for a book published at <br/>
the end of last year called Free Range Education, it&#39;s <br/>
British, the website&#39;s www.free-range-education.co.uk<br/>
<br/>
I suppose if you think it&#39;s a worthwhile project, then <br/>
just keep plugging away until you find someone who <br/>
agrees with you!  Or do a &#39;Gatto&#39; and publish it <br/>
yourself...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077711402"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Carrie --
<br>
<br>I think the book idea sounds great. I would find it useful even now -- &nbsp;
<br>especially now, actually! &nbsp;As we&#39;ve made our way through seven months of 
<br>homeschooling (my 6 &amp; 8 year old daughters), I have moved steadily towards 
<br>unschooling, almost without realizing it. &nbsp;It works for us and it definitely 
<br>works for my daughter with ADHD. &nbsp;It absolutely evolved and was not my 
<br>initial plan, so I, too, look for something to offer to friends or family 
<br>members who don&#39;t seem to get it, are genuinely curious or disapprove (I run 
<br>into all three.)
<br>
<br>Good luck -- and keep us posted.

<div><font face="Pooh">Actually I think its a wonderful Idea. You know many 
publishing companies don&#39;t see it that way. However, How big is your manuscript? 
Would you like to try making limited copies of your own instead of sending it to 
a publishing company? If so, make the copies at kinkos, add cardstock that has 
been stamped and have them bound either at kinkos or buy your own binder machine 
which isn&#39;t that expensive anyway and charge a reasonable fee for the books. And 
there ya have it. </font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552297138">I think it&#39;s a great project! Such a book would be very useful to me now. I <br/>
just started homeschooling this year and my grandmother(I&#39;m fourteen)really <br/>
doesn&#39;t like the homeschooling idea at all and she doesn&#39;t even get <br/>
unschooling. She&#39;s always talking to me about how great high school will be <br/>
and all the stuff I&#39;ll be doing and reminding me to do my &quot;homework&quot;. She <br/>
means well and I love her very much, but it drives me crazy!<br/>
  Sometimes it takes ages to find a publisher. My favorite author(who has <br/>
written over forty books)said she could paper walls with the rejection slips <br/>
she&#39;s gotten.<br/>
So don&#39;t give up!!<br/>
Love, Erin<br/>

I loved what I read of the book so far. I am looking forward to reading the<br/>
rest. What I did read tonight made me cry. It really helped me with<br/>
something I was having a problem with in wanting things for my kids that<br/>
they didn&#39;t want. Just posted about it actually. Thank you and<br/>
