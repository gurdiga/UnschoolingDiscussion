<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434557874">&lt;&lt;when there are shows you prefer they not watch&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, this depends at our house.<br/>
<br/>
With a younger child, I might ask them if they wanted to play a game or go<br/>
to the park or help me wash dishes, etc..  If the child really seriously<br/>
wanted to watch the show and I just thought the characters were rude or<br/>
whatever, I would just say &quot;I don&#39;t like that show because I think Lizzie is<br/>
really quite selfish&quot; or whatever and go on about my business.  If I thought<br/>
the show was seriously problematic, like &quot;Halloween&quot; or something, I would<br/>
sit and watch it with the child and see how they are handling it, talking<br/>
with them about it, etc..<br/>
<br/>
With my older kids, I simply tell them how I feel about shows.  My son loves<br/>
&quot;Real TV&quot;.  I think its horrible, about people getting hurt, etc..  He used<br/>
to watch it daily, now I don&#39;t remember the last time I saw he had it on.<br/>
<br/>
If I think a show might scare them or whatever, I tell them but they decide<br/>
if they want to watch it.<br/>
