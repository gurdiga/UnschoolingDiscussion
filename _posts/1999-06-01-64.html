&gt;<br/>
&gt;Evening<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
&gt; And what would this Golden Rule be?  Just for future reference purposes...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ah, the one that says treat folks like you would like to be treated. ;)  Some<br/>
<br/>
&gt;lists have rules about posting this or that or fowarding stuff.....and <br/>
&gt;sometimes folks get upset and sound very tense.  Email can be hard at times,<br/>
<br/>
&gt;since we are doing without tones of voices and body language.  So, if we <br/>
&gt;remember to read as if our best friend were the one writing and we treat each<br/>
<br/>
&gt;other the way we want to be treated we won&#39;t have a contentious flame war.<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;don&#39;t know about you all, but I don&#39;t have time for those things. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;As for brainstorming, sure!  I&#39;d love to.  You may be sorry you asked! <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I would love to see a permanent listing (perhaps on the Web site?) with all<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the pertinent information about each list member, such as: geographic<br/>
&gt; location, ages/genders of children, interests, hobbies, and/or anything<br/>
&gt; else that might prove useful.  While it is lovely to have folks include<br/>
&gt; this information in their intro messages, I find I cannot remember all of<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it, or who matches which information.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Onelist has a great number of accessories we can use.  Many people are <br/>
&gt;careful about the kind of information that is posted, but everything here <br/>
<br/>
&gt;would be limited to just the people on this list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;I<br/>
&gt; How about the idea of swapping or timesharing or just plain sharing lodging<br/>
<br/>
&gt; for travel purposes?  I think travel is a wonderful aspect made possible by<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the freedom from madated school schedules that homeschooling, and<br/>
&gt; Unschooling in particular, provide.  We have a 2,000 sq. ft. home with a<br/>
&gt; couple of extra bedrooms and/or couch space and we happen to live within an<br/>
<br/>
&gt; hour of Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks!  Anyone interested in group<br/>
<br/>
&gt; trips, get togethers, summer cookouts, or anything else of that nature in<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Idaho or the surrounding area?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is so much fun! Over the years I&#39;ve gotten together with a great number<br/>
<br/>
&gt;of online friends. Matter of fact I spent 8 days of May in ABQ New Mexico <br/>
<br/>
&gt;with an online friend.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt;Le&#39;ts define education then.. what do you see them doing in order to <br/>
&gt;*become <br/>
&gt; &gt;educated*?<br/>
&gt; Boy!  That&#39;s a tall order! <br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;need to have good reading, writing and math<br/>
&gt; skills.  That includes the ability to function well in the world with daily<br/>
<br/>
&gt; math skills, being able to communicate their thoughts articulately and in<br/>
<br/>
&gt; an intelligent manner in writing, and being able to read anything<br/>
&gt; non-technical (and some things that are) that interest them without feeling<br/>
<br/>
&gt; unable to comprehend or decipher it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We could talk for hours about what constitues *good* and *fuction well*. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
&gt;Most of what you write I hope happens for my children. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;It is also important for them to have an understanding of the sciences;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Biology, Chemistry, Environmental, Astrological, etc... and how they affect<br/>
<br/>
&gt; their daily lives and the world at large.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I love knowing the things I know, but there are a great many people <br/>
<br/>
&gt;living wonderful, full, productive lives who have not one factiod about <br/>
&gt;chemistry stored in their brain..... that is stored as *chemistry* .  :) <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;They should have a pretty good<br/>
&gt; idea what the history of our Nation and the world are, both celebrated and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; shameful events/circumstances. They should understand how ours, and maybe<br/>
<br/>
&gt; some other major political systems operate, and their place in them. They<br/>
<br/>
&gt; will need a woking knowledge of computers and their trappings as well.  A<br/>
<br/>
&gt; thorough education should also include an appreciation of, and perhaps<br/>
&gt; experience creating, the fine arts, a healthy dose of multi-cultural<br/>
&gt; experiences and some theology. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would agree that these things are important, but I&#39;m not sure that each and<br/>
<br/>
&gt;every person needs to touch on these things in order to be *educated*.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;.  Also remember, this is the<br/>
&gt; opinion of a single, fallible individual, and I may be leaving something<br/>
&gt; out. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We all leave something out!! I have no interest in knowing so many things.<br/>
 <br/>
&gt;Ancient Chinese History just holds nothing for me...... but to another it <br/>
<br/>
&gt;could be life changing.  Now ask me about babies, midwifery, unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;some theology, politics....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt; What a wonderfully generous offer, Thank you!  It is always nice to find<br/>
<br/>
&gt; new avenues of support and information. &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s what we&#39;re here for.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rambling is good. We stumble onto some of our best stuff just by rambling <br/>
<br/>
&gt;around at this house.  Actually you could say that by rambling around like<br/>
<br/>
&gt;this with good friends is how I became educated. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Rule.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what would this Golden Rule be?  Just for future reference purposes...<br/>
<br/>
As for brainstorming, sure!  I&#39;d love to.  You may be sorry you asked!  <br/>
I would love to see a permanent listing (perhaps on the Web site?) with all<br/>
the pertinent information about each list member, such as: geographic<br/>
location, ages/genders of children, interests, hobbies, and/or anything<br/>
else that might prove useful.  While it is lovely to have folks include<br/>
this information in their intro messages, I find I cannot remember all of<br/>
it, or who matches which information.  It is unwieldy to try to preserve<br/>
all of these messages, and both impractical and inconvenient to try to comb<br/>
them for references when you want to verify your facts.  But I think it is<br/>
invaluable info to have on hand for the purposes of networking/connecting<br/>
with Unschoolers who may face similar situations as you do, have kids the<br/>
same ages, are in your area, etc... If people are concearned about privacy,<br/>
we could have the Web site email a password to the listing to all list<br/>
members...? <br/>
<br/>
How about the idea of swapping or timesharing or just plain sharing lodging<br/>
for travel purposes?  I think travel is a wonderful aspect made possible by<br/>
the freedom from madated school schedules that homeschooling, and<br/>
Unschooling in particular, provide.  We have a 2,000 sq. ft. home with a<br/>
couple of extra bedrooms and/or couch space and we happen to live within an<br/>
hour of Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks!  Anyone interested in group<br/>

Idaho or the surrounding area?<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Le&#39;ts define education then.. what do you see them doing in order to *become <br/>
&gt;educated*?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy!  That&#39;s a tall order!  I will do my best to descibe what I,<br/>
personally, believe &quot;a good education&quot; comprises, but cannot speak for my<br/>
husband or anyone else for that matter.  This is over and above what a<br/>
person needs emotionally and psychologically to function as a happy and<br/>
productive member of our society and the world.  Please feel free to<br/>
translate this OUT of EduSpeak.  Obviously, having completed a primary<br/>
education, a young adult would need to have good reading, writing and math<br/>
skills.  That includes the ability to function well in the world with daily<br/>
math skills, being able to communicate their thoughts articulately and in<br/>
an intelligent manner in writing, and being able to read anything<br/>
non-technical (and some things that are) that interest them without feeling<br/>
unable to comprehend or decipher it.  <br/>
<br/>
It is also important for them to have an understanding of the sciences;<br/>
Biology, Chemistry, Environmental, Astrological, etc... and how they affect<br/>
their daily lives and the world at large.  They should have a pretty good<br/>
idea what the history of our Nation and the world are, both celebrated and<br/>
shameful events/circumstances. They should understand how ours, and maybe<br/>
some other major political systems operate, and their place in them. They<br/>
will need a woking knowledge of computers and their trappings as well.  A<br/>
thorough education should also include an appreciation of, and perhaps<br/>
experience creating, the fine arts, a healthy dose of multi-cultural<br/>
experiences and some theology.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, more specialized areas will arise in every persons education,<br/>
dependent upon their individual or family tastes and interests, and there<br/>
are far too many fields to go into here.  Also remember, this is the<br/>
opinion of a single, fallible individual, and I may be leaving something<br/>
out.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nanci says:&gt; &lt;&lt;.  However, we  were not counting on falling in love with<br/>
the listing for an 8 year old little girl in Foster Care!  Well!  This<br/>
changes everything!  Hopefully she will turn out to be a good match for us,<br/>
once our homestudy is completed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and we are able to get more details about her and her history.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lisa&#39;s response:  &gt;You can come here to the list and talk all about what&#39;s<br/>
going on with her and we can help find materials and ideas for the two/five<br/>
of you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderfully generous offer, Thank you!  It is always nice to find<br/>
new avenues of support and information.  I Hope you can find something<br/>
usefull in this huge message, and I wasn&#39;t just rambling, which is how it<br/>
felt.<br/>
