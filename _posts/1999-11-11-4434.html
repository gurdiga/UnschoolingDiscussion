<br/>
Could you elaborate a bit as to the harmful ways in which we manipulate our<br/>
children?  I am in the throws of developing discipline practices that are<br/>
successful for my toddler boys (20 months and 35 months) and will soon need<br/>
to start all over again when our older adopted girl(or girls) come home, as<br/>
I am positive they will be dealing with attachment, trust and abandonment<br/>
issues, at the least.<br/>
<br/>
I generally use time outs in his bedroom (2-5 min) for my almost three year<br/>
old about once a day (on average, some days less some days more) for series<br/>
problems like purposefully hurting his brother and refusing to apoloize,<br/>
tantrums, refusing to desist in an activity despite numerous warnings, etc.<br/>
 This usually has fairly good results, and is always followed up by a quiet<br/>
lap conversation about the offending behavior and what he should have done,<br/>
and often an apology to anyone who was hurt by his behavior (like brother,<br/>
or me or Daddy.)  Usually he is raring to go and wants to run off and play<br/>
afterward, but occassionally he needs calming after a tantrum and so I will<br/>
cuddle with him and pet him and give him lots of reassurance for a while,<br/>
until he is ready to get down and play.  I never strike my boys.<br/>
<br/>
The Baby (1.5 yr. old) has only ever had three time outs, for about a<br/>
minute each, for purposefully pushing and disobeying in a dangerous<br/>
situation after numerous warnings (like playing with the electrical cord<br/>
while Daddy is vacuming) but he is generally really easy.  I try not to<br/>
even raise my voice with him, as he is so sensastive that it usually makes<br/>
him cry if I look or sound cross.  I try to make things into a game and use<br/>
humor to teach him, as he does not get upset and is much more receptive to<br/>
that.  He has a very gentle personality and does not respond well to<br/>
agression, and also cries when his brother gets too rough in play (a<br/>
frequent problem, with my rough and tumble, sports loving older boy!)  We<br/>
refer to our &quot;little&quot; guy as our gentle giant, because he is so very<br/>
gentle, and quiet but he is the same size as his brother and both wear size<br/>
2 or 3 clothes.  <br/>
<br/>
On a side note, he has a really interesting personality.  Even though he is<br/>
shy, people are attracted to him in an irresistable way.  My older son is a<br/>
BIG flirt and has a magnetic personality, dimples, red hair and blue eyes<br/>
with long thick lashes.  I KNOW why people are drawn to him, he is cute and<br/>
talks incessently to everyone and is not the least bit shy.  His brother,<br/>
however, is shy and hides from strangers (although he has recently started<br/>
waving and saying &quot;Hi&quot; to people) but he has the most amazing affect on<br/>
people.  Everyone he meets wants to hold him and kiss him and he has this<br/>
incredible calming effect on them.  People have described feeling washed<br/>
over with peace when they hold him.  When he was an infant, everyone who<br/>
held him fell asleep!  It makes me wonder about him, his purpose, or since<br/>
I believe in reincarnation, I wonder if he has previously been some kind of<br/>
a healer.  I look forward to seeing who he will grow to be.<br/>

there&#39;s a book by Barbara Colorosa....I can&#39;t think of the name just now.  I<br/>
really like her perspective in general.<br/>
    One principle I remember is about controlling children.  Regardless of<br/>
methods,  if parents expect their children to make no or few choices of<br/>
their own and be always &#39;obedient&#39;,   then they are more likely to rebel as<br/>
adolescents.<br/>
    BTW,  I&#39;m not knocking &#39;obedience&#39; per se.  It&#39;s a matter of trying to<br/>
control or not.  Some parents discourage thinking for oneself through<br/>
certain typye of obedience (&#39;Because I&#39;m the mom/dad and I say so&#39;,  etc.)<br/>
    I haven&#39;t gotten any impression that you&#39;re like this,  Nanci.<br/>
regarding timeouts specifically,  I try to use the not as punishment,  but<br/>
as reasonable times to take a break from a situation,  get emotions in<br/>
check,  and return to the situation with a clearer head.  I hope to teach<br/>
them that time outs are healthy for adults, too.<br/>
Gotta run,  toddler needs attention!<br/>

i can identify with the developing discipline for the little ones.  our boys <br/>
are 3yrs and 17mos.  i am conscious of the manipulation and control that i <br/>
exert bc it gets results. and for me somedays getting thru the day-to-day all <br/>
day long sometimes yearns for just results, despite the higher ideals i might <br/>
have!<br/>
<br/>
we use distraction and redirection mostly for the younger one.  the 3yr old <br/>
pushes the limit much more and i have most satisfying results when i am able <br/>
to figure out what the motivation for his misbehaviour is.  for eg. when he <br/>
was pulling his older sisters hair, it took me (too long!) several times to <br/>
see the pattern of her first yelling or overbearingly telling  him something <br/>
(&quot;bossing&quot;).  he got to the point that when she came toward him or opened her <br/>
mouth to say anything he would lash out already!  so it took working from <br/>
both ends: talking to dd about her attitude towards him & why she was getting <br/>
this response, and also helping ds find words to communicate his feelings and <br/>
talking to him about controlling his hands...  it dissipated after that!<br/>
<br/>
the 3yo &quot;bugs&quot; the toddler just by touching or chasing or running away, doing <br/>
the opposite of what the toddler wants, why?  i hate to say (which i find <br/>
myself doing lots) the ineffective &quot;leave him alone&quot;  or &quot;keep your hands to <br/>
yourself...&quot;  other ideas here?<br/>
