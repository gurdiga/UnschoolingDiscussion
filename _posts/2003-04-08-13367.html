&lt;&lt; And since you are all probably annoyed with an anti food thread on This <br/>
List,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather have an anti-food thread here than anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
(Not sure what all that *means* &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>

That was really REALLY funny.  I was laughing out loud and Marty was saying <br/>
WHAT?<br/>
but I&#39;ll just send it to him.  Very funny.  But they misused &quot;akimbo.&quot;  It <br/>
means hands on hips or waist, elbows out.  That guy wasn&#39;t akimbo.<br/>
<br/>
So I stopped laughing.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad for me that I&#39;m so anal about errors like that.  Good thing my kids <br/>
won&#39;t be!<br/>
