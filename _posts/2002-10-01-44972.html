<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822150562">Several posts back, someone mentioned about vaccinating/not <br/>
vaccinating pets.  Does anyone know of a website that lists the legal <br/>
requirements for pet vaccination?  I know that with children there is <br/>
often a difference between what is recommended and what is a legal <br/>
requirement, and I would imagine it&#39;s the same with pets.  <br/>
<br/>
My cat has been very sick and is being treated by a homeopath.  She <br/>
is improving a lot, but her body isn&#39;t quite ready to endure the <br/>
shock of vaccinations.  I don&#39;t want to give her anything more than <br/>
is absolutely legally required.  <br/>

Not sure if there is such a site. Just call a local vet and ask what the <br/>
laws are. Or the Humane Society in your area or even the twon or city hall.<br/>
<br/>
I know here in FL the rabies vaccine is required by law. I never had my dogs <br/>
done before. These two now have the rabies vaccine because we take them out <br/>
to dog parks and beaches where they need to have the tag to get in.<br/>
