I have tried and tried to recreate your greens recipe.  They were so good<br/>
and Adriane really enjoyed them.  I just can&#39;t get it right.  If you are<br/>
ever in the mood to share your secrets........<br/>

About 2lb ( a mess) fresh, WASHED, locally grown<br/>
collards (local may be the difference), cut up with<br/>
most of the thick center vein removed. Cover with<br/>
water in a pot big enough to hold them all, add a glop<br/>
of vegetable oil (fat back or bacon  is<br/>
traditional....but so is arteriosclerosis), I use<br/>
canola. Salt, black pepper, and about 1 quarter cup of<br/>
sugar (honey has a nice flavor, too...bet your thyme<br/>
honey would be good and would make it yours). Stir it<br/>
all together and boil, reduce heat, simmer until they<br/>
are how as tender as you prefer.  I like mine with<br/>
vinegar (various kinds) DH likes his with corn-bread<br/>
crumbled or broken in chunks and salsa and LOTS of<br/>
Seminole Seasoning (a salt substitute with salt in<br/>
it)or hot sauce and Seminole Seasoning. Roy, and his<br/>
brothers, and most kids, like theirs, as is.  Left<br/>
overs can be frozen in the juice and zapped later, or<br/>
heated on the stove top.  Old country folks save the<br/>
pot liquor (the juice) and drink it as a beverage. <br/>
Collards are high in everything, including calcium,<br/>
iron, anti-oxidants, B vitamins, ruffage (give some<br/>
folks gas, but it is the same people who get gas with<br/>
brocoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and all the rest) and<br/>
other good stuff I don&#39;t really know about...a little<br/>
K and ????<br/>
<br/>
Adrian had a good appetite! and secure enough to be<br/>
willing to try new foods. <br/>
