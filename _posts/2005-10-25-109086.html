<div id="ygrps-yiv-48207123">I don&#39;t post often, but we&#39;ve run into an issue that I could really <br/>
use some help with.<br/>
<br/>
My kids (8 and 6.5) came home from school last February. We&#39;ve never <br/>
limited food and I&#39;ve always tried to avoid saying no <br/>
automatically.  The only thing left, really, was bedtimes.  <br/>
Not &quot;getting&quot; how to do it gradually, I told them they could go to <br/>
bed when their bodies told them they were tired.  I asked them to <br/>
please be respectful of the people in the house who were sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it worked some nights and not others.  They&#39;d be downstairs <br/>
watching TV and playing games, getting too loud.  I&#39;d wake up <br/>
numerous times through the night, tell them that they are waking me <br/>
up.  My dh would wake up and turn the tv off and tell them to go to <br/>
bed, they&#39;d get upset and stomp to their rooms.  Sometimes, they&#39;d <br/>
decide to stay up and go in seperate rooms.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately, it&#39;s just not working.  We&#39;ve talked during the day about <br/>
how everyone needs sleep, I will mention I&#39;m grouchy because I&#39;m <br/>
tired cause I woke up so many times because of the noise.  My dh <br/>
won&#39;t have energy to play/roughhouse after work because he&#39;s tired <br/>
from being woken up, too.  Not in a condescending mean way, just as <br/>
the reason why we are not up for something.  And not all the time, <br/>
just when that really is why.  <br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t have a problem with them being up very late.  It <br/>
actually works out quite well, my younger two fall asleep with my <br/>
dh (usually around 9ish), I clean up around the house for the night <br/>
and then I get to play <br/>
games, read, watch shows with the bigger kids that I&#39;m not able to <br/>
do when the little ones are up.  I go to bed when anywhere from <br/>
midnight to 2am and get <br/>
some time with the little ones before the big ones get up.  (they <br/>
stay up after me even, though.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve recently decided together that after 9pm it&#39;s &quot;quiet time&quot; - <br/>
cards, <br/>
computer, movies, whatever - just quietly.  I read how Sandra <br/>
says &quot;Yes, you can...if you (whatever)&quot;.  I&#39;ve told them &quot;you can <br/>
stay up, if you&#39;re quiet&quot;.  So, my question is, after you talk about <br/>
why, come up with ideas and they&#39;re still having a hard time being <br/>
quiet, what do you do?  If they can be quiet they can stay up...so <br/>
if they&#39;re not quiet, they can&#39;t.  How do I enforce that?  We&#39;ve <br/>
said before, &quot;okay you&#39;re not being quiet, lights out&quot;.  But I feel <br/>
like I&#39;m punishing them.  Is that okay because its something we all <br/>
agreed to?  Sometimes they groan, sometimes they agree and sometimes <br/>
they come up with another idea (seperating or whatever).  We&#39;ve <br/>
tried talking about it before bed, what will help you be quiet?  <br/>
Lights out and a movie together?  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I&#39;m rambling, last night was one of those nights!  I know <br/>
they need time to get used to that freedom and I realize I didn&#39;t <br/>
start it off on the right foot by throwing away bedtime, but it has <br/>
been almost a year and the issue isn&#39;t really that I want them to go <br/>
to sleep, it&#39;s more about consideration, I guess - we need our <br/>
sleep!  I really feel like I&#39;ve tried everything...any advice or <br/>
suggestions please.  Constructive criticism welcomed :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132530215">A couple of thoughts - <br/>
<br/>
are there ways to make it quieter in general? for example, can the <br/>
TV be moved to the family room rather than the living room if the <br/>
family room is farther from the sleeping areas? can the doors to the <br/>
sleeping areas be closed? add quilts and wall hangings to the walls <br/>
to add sound proofing? can you get headphones for the TV (with <br/>
splitter so two can use them at one time)? stuff like that. Oh, and <br/>
look for a TV with self-regulating volume, that way it <br/>
doesn&#39;t &#39;suddenly&#39; get loud when a commercial comes on or the <br/>
channel or program changes (I hate it that some programs are really <br/>
quiet and then the next program starts and blasts out).<br/>
<br/>
and, if the discussion and agreement were made by the family as a <br/>
whole (the kids had full input on the subject), then there needs to <br/>
be a follow up saying &quot;this is what we discussed and agreed on. the <br/>
current arrangement isn&#39;t working. here are the problem areas. what <br/>
can we do about these things?&quot; Maybe set in place specific steps - <br/>
if they get loud and you or DH go out to them, they get a warning. <br/>
If it happens again, they need to change what they are doing. If it <br/>
happens a 3rd time, they need to head to their beds. Something like <br/>
that - work out amongst you what is reasonable for all concerned. <br/>
Since you tend to stay up later with them, maybe it would be <br/>
reasonable for your family that when you (mom) head to bed, the kids <br/>
who are still awake need to head to their rooms for &#39;quiet time&#39; - <br/>
perhaps a TV in their room where they can watch quietly if it would <br/>
be less disturbing than the one in the main room(?). We don&#39;t <br/>
generally have this issue since DS (7) is an only - if he wants to <br/>
stay up, that&#39;s fine, he watches TV downstairs and it doesn&#39;t <br/>
generally disturb us upstairs (on rare occasions, we pop down and <br/>
ask to have the volume lowered but that is more related to the <br/>
program or channel issues rather than him suddenly making it louder <br/>
himself).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the second waking-up, if you allowed for a third one they walked over you <br/>
worse than you would walk over them by setting a by-the-clock bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
A rule that says they can only stay up if they&#39;re quiet is NOT an arbitrary <br/>
rule, it&#39;s a for-good-reasons, real deal that they make with you to stay up.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My dh would wake up and turn the tv off and tell them to go to<br/>
bed, they&#39;d get upset and stomp to their rooms.-=-<br/>
<br/>
One single upset-and-stomp is enough to call the whole deal off, in my <br/>
opinion.   IF they want to go to bed when they want to instead of when you say to, <br/>
THEN they need to do it without disturbing ANYone else (you, neighbors, the <br/>
dog...).<br/>
<br/>
-=-My dh would wake up and turn the tv off and tell them to go to<br/>
bed, they&#39;d get upset and stomp to their rooms.  Sometimes, they&#39;d<br/>
decide to stay up and go in seperate rooms. -=-<br/>
<br/>
At that point, I wouldn&#39;t have left it to their decision.   If someone was up <br/>
more than ONCE, turned off a TV and said &quot;go to bed,&quot; how was it they decided <br/>
to stay   up?<br/>
<br/>
-=- We&#39;ve talked during the day about<br/>
how everyone needs sleep, I will mention I&#39;m grouchy because I&#39;m<br/>
tired cause I woke up so many times because of the noise.  My dh<br/>
won&#39;t have energy to play/roughhouse after work because he&#39;s tired<br/>
from being woken up, too.  Not in a condescending mean way, just as<br/>
the reason why we are not up for something.  And not all the time,<br/>
just when that really is why. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you put the kids in charge of the house, but someone is still in <br/>
charge of the house, and it&#39;s not you.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t move toward mindfulness, you threw out rules and the wound-up-kids <br/>
launched themselves fast and far.   <br/>
<br/>
-=- I read how Sandra<br/>
says &quot;Yes, you can...if you (whatever)&quot;.  I&#39;ve told them &quot;you can<br/>
stay up, if you&#39;re quiet&quot;.  So, my question is, after you talk about<br/>
why, come up with ideas and they&#39;re still having a hard time being<br/>
quiet, what do you do?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then I tell them to go to bed, and the next night I might (depends on various <br/>
factors) ask them to just stay in their rooms instead of being in the den or <br/>
library the next night, so I could make up missed sleep.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If they can be quiet they can stay up...so<br/>
if they&#39;re not quiet, they can&#39;t.  How do I enforce that?  We&#39;ve<br/>
said before, &quot;okay you&#39;re not being quiet, lights out&quot;.  But I feel<br/>
like I&#39;m punishing them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re not keeping their deal, they&#39;re not keeping their deal.<br/>
How is it a punishment if you say If..then and they botch &quot;if&quot;?   <br/>
Then-not should kick in without you even having to say so.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  Is that okay because its something we all agreed to? -=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids can stay up because Keith and I said they could. <br/>
They can go to sleep whenever they want to; we&#39;re not MAKING them stay up.   <br/>
But it&#39;s our house, and we have more obligations to be places at certain times <br/>
(except the boys&#39; jobs, now), and we can take back privileges and freedoms we <br/>
granted.   We&#39;ve rarely done it, but we&#39;ve never said &quot;Gosh, we don&#39;t have <br/>
the right to tell you what to do.&quot;   We say &quot;Do your parents&#39; friends let them <br/>
do X?&quot;   The answer&#39;s usually &quot;no,&quot; and with that reminder they remember to <br/>
appreciate the VAST freedoms they have.<br/>
<br/>
-=- We&#39;ve<br/>
tried talking about it before bed, what will help you be quiet? <br/>
Lights out and a movie together? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If they can&#39;t figure it out, they might not be old enough to make the <br/>
decision, then.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I really feel like I&#39;ve tried everything...any advice or<br/>
suggestions please. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t seem to have tried &quot;I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE YOU WOKE ME UP AGAIN! GET IN <br/>
THE BED RIGHT NOW.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, they&#39;re walking on you.<br/>
<br/>
It was easier for us, starting gradually from birth, but even now, if they <br/>
wake me up irresponsibly and inconsiderately, I&#39;m not going to ask them any <br/>
polite questions about what I can do to help them calm down.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t wake them up rudely, and because of that they don&#39;t wake me up rudely <br/>
either.   <br/>
<br/>
There have been times when there were latenight gaming sessions and other <br/>
kids were over and they&#39;d get loud more than once and I&#39;ve told them and company <br/>
too to get to a stopping place and go to sleep (other boys were staying over) <br/>
and if they woke me up again, the game would have to be at [whichever other <br/>
kid&#39;s] house the next time.   They did NOT want to go to the other kids&#39; house, <br/>
because the mom would&#39;ve made them stop by midnight and go home, so because <br/>
they WANTED this location, they got very, very quiet the couple of times I set <br/>
the ultimatum on them.<br/>
<br/>
-=--=-ds8, dd6.5, ds3.5, -=-<br/>
<br/>
These kids are very, very young to be letting them stay up.   I&#39;d be more <br/>
likely (especially if they had had bedtimes before) to let them listen to music <br/>
or watch a movie FROM A BED (floor bed or in a room), or play on the computer, <br/>
but that would be about all.   If you&#39;ve done it for a year, tha tmeans you <br/>
told a five year old to stay up til whenever?   And a seven year old?<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of steps between relaxing arbitrary inflexible rules and <br/>
having total anarchy.<br/>

I should&#39;ve seperated those two sentences.  The second one was more <br/>

I wrote mine before I saw how very young they are, though.<br/>
While it&#39;s true my kids were up and down and not on a sleep schedule even <br/>
while they were little, it developed as gradually as everything else in their <br/>
lives, as they got old enough   to do things for themselves and to make binding <br/>
deals (like &quot;yes, I&#39;ll be quiet&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Gradually it got bigger and looser and freer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221581772">Pondering this a bit more and thought about something else....during <br/>
that time when you are still awake and DH and the littlest ones are in <br/>
bed, are you making it a transitional, gradually quieting down time or <br/>
is it business as usual, cleaning, talking, playing, etc? Maybe <br/>
creating a wind down time would be helpful rather than going from <br/>
daytime activity and noise level to quiet rapidly. For instance, at <br/>
our house, even though DS can choose to stay up, he generally wants to <br/>
spend some time snuggling with me before I fall asleep (I&#39;m first to <br/>
bed since I&#39;m the one who gets up for work in the morning). He may <br/>
snuggle and fall asleep or he may snuggle then get back up as I fall <br/>
asleep. Either way, we&#39;ve done some winding down from the day so it is <br/>
just easier to relax and be quiet. Might be a way to rein things in a <br/>
bit without going back to set bedtimes.<br/>
<br/>
It was kind of interesting when we got back from the conference since <br/>
DH and I brought the flu back with us. So, we were falling asleep way <br/>
early and DS would turn off the TV in our room, turn out any lights, <br/>
and take himself off to his room whenever he was ready. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking last night too, and Deb&#39;s ideas are good.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose a big part of why my kids have gone to sleep when sleepy but not <br/>
been wildly crazy is because every time they stayed up it was a one-shot (in a <br/>
way, when they were little).   They would say they didn&#39;t want to go to bed <br/>
yet, when I was going to sleep with the nursing baby.    Nursing a baby to sleep <br/>
isn&#39;t something you have to SAY (&quot;Go to bed.&quot;)   They Want to nurse, and they <br/>
fall asleep.   Often the older sibling will fall asleep then too, because <br/>
there&#39;s soft music or a book being read, and that&#39;s EASY.   But when one gets old <br/>
enough to want to stay up, and you make a deal with him, know what he&#39;s going <br/>
to be doing, and he knows if he isn&#39;t cool and mature he might be told no the <br/>
next time, then he&#39;s cool.   And gradually from that developed the days when <br/>
Kirby might still not be home at 3:00 a.m. but I was sure he was being cool and <br/>
quiet, somewhere, and that he wasn&#39;t doing something crazy and irresponsible. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Because it came gradually, there was no celebratory WOOHOO!!!! moment when <br/>
the old bedtime passed the child was FREE!   Free to celebrate being awake at <br/>
11:00 p.m.!!!<br/>
<br/>
So in a small model of exactly WHY it&#39;s good to give kids freedoms while <br/>
they&#39;re kids, so that they don&#39;t escape their bonds at the age of 18 (or whenever <br/>
they leave for college or whatever) and fly as far and crazily AWAY from what <br/>
their families made them do or forbade them to do that they Juse Go <br/>
CRAZY!~!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
To avoid &quot;crazy,&quot; they need to be making lots of decisions earlier.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid food binge and irresponsibly rejecting all vegetables and salads <br/>
because now they don&#39;t &quot;HAVE TO&quot; eat them, let them turn them down earlier.   Let <br/>
them eat ice cream for breakfast if they want to now, and they&#39;ll probably <br/>
really never imagine that it might be a cool act of maturity to eat ice cream <br/>
for breakfast. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To avoid adult avoidance of books and learning, don&#39;t make it a powerless <br/>
kid-thing to &quot;have to&quot; study from books and to prove learning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better for an eight year old to be wild at night than an eighteen year <br/>
old.   But still, if you can make clearest above all else that nighttime needs <br/>
to be a quiet time, and that they can ONLY stay up if they maintain that <br/>
quiet, only then can they really start listening to their own bodies to see if <br/>
they&#39;re asleep.   If sleep had been something children &quot;had to&quot; do and now they&#39;re <br/>
told they &quot;don&#39;t have to,&quot; they&#39;re &quot;being adult&quot; by staying up.   <br/>
<br/>
Their motive is not to be up because they want to be, but because the gate <br/>
was lifted and they rushed out.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-313021025">We did have bedtime for DS when he was littler (toddler to almost <br/>
age 5). It was one of the last bits of stuff we mulled over and <br/>
discussed (me and DH) and one of the few &#39;rule based&#39; things anyhow. <br/>
When we decided to drop bedtime, we just went about things like <br/>
usual in the evening and at about my usual time, I said I was <br/>
heading off to bed but I&#39;d probably be awake reading for a little <br/>
while. DH headed up with me. DS was watching TV and said he wanted <br/>
to watch more because there were back to back episodes of whatever <br/>
it was. We said OK just turn out the light and turn off the TV when <br/>
you come up. An hour or so later, he came up. Those first couple of <br/>
nights of us saying OK, he did stay up later by about 2 hrs. Then he <br/>
started coming up with us more of the time. A whole dynamic changed <br/>
when we got a TV (w/cable) for our bedroom and moved the DVD player <br/>
in there. Now he can watch TV and snuggle with me while I doze off <br/>
so he doesn&#39;t have to be downstairs alone. Next on the agenda for <br/>
this winter is a TV for his room (we&#39;ll likely move the TV, DVD/VCR <br/>
and PS2 from the basement to his room for the winter - basement is <br/>
nice and cool for summer but barely heated in winter).<br/>

this time with them without the little guys around.  (Plus, I get <br/>
the morning with the younger two.)  Lights are off or low, when I go <br/>

When they first came home from school, they&#39;d stay up REAL late.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; that time when you are still awake and DH and the littlest ones <br/>
are in<br/>
&gt; &gt; bed, are you making it a transitional, gradually quieting down <br/>
time or<br/>
&gt; &gt; is it business as usual, cleaning, talking, playing, etc?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was thinking last night too, and Deb&#39;s ideas are good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose a big part of why my kids have gone to sleep when sleepy <br/>
but not <br/>
&gt; been wildly crazy is because every time they stayed up it was a <br/>
one-shot (in a <br/>
&gt; way, when they were little).   They would say they didn&#39;t want to <br/>
go to bed <br/>
&gt; yet, when I was going to sleep with the nursing baby.    Nursing a <br/>
baby to sleep <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t something you have to SAY (&quot;Go to bed.&quot;)   They Want to <br/>
nurse, and they <br/>
&gt; fall asleep.   Often the older sibling will fall asleep then too, <br/>
because <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s soft music or a book being read, and that&#39;s EASY.   But <br/>
when one gets old <br/>
&gt; enough to want to stay up, and you make a deal with him, know what <br/>
he&#39;s going <br/>
&gt; to be doing, and he knows if he isn&#39;t cool and mature he might be <br/>
told no the <br/>
&gt; next time, then he&#39;s cool.   And gradually from that developed the <br/>
days when <br/>
&gt; Kirby might still not be home at 3:00 a.m. but I was sure he was <br/>
being cool and <br/>
&gt; quiet, somewhere, and that he wasn&#39;t doing something crazy and <br/>
irresponsible. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because it came gradually, there was no celebratory WOOHOO!!!! <br/>
moment when <br/>
&gt; the old bedtime passed the child was FREE!   Free to celebrate <br/>
being awake at <br/>
&gt; 11:00 p.m.!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So in a small model of exactly WHY it&#39;s good to give kids freedoms <br/>
while <br/>
&gt; they&#39;re kids, so that they don&#39;t escape their bonds at the age of <br/>
18 (or whenever <br/>
&gt; they leave for college or whatever) and fly as far and crazily <br/>
AWAY from what <br/>
&gt; their families made them do or forbade them to do that they Juse <br/>
Go <br/>
&gt; CRAZY!~!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To avoid &quot;crazy,&quot; they need to be making lots of decisions earlier.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To avoid food binge and irresponsibly rejecting all vegetables and <br/>
salads <br/>
&gt; because now they don&#39;t &quot;HAVE TO&quot; eat them, let them turn them down <br/>
earlier.   Let <br/>
&gt; them eat ice cream for breakfast if they want to now, and they&#39;ll <br/>
probably <br/>
&gt; really never imagine that it might be a cool act of maturity to <br/>
eat ice cream <br/>
&gt; for breakfast. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To avoid adult avoidance of books and learning, don&#39;t make it a <br/>
powerless <br/>
&gt; kid-thing to &quot;have to&quot; study from books and to prove learning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s better for an eight year old to be wild at night than an <br/>
eighteen year <br/>
&gt; old.   But still, if you can make clearest above all else that <br/>
nighttime needs <br/>
&gt; to be a quiet time, and that they can ONLY stay up if they <br/>
maintain that <br/>
&gt; quiet, only then can they really start listening to their own <br/>
bodies to see if <br/>
&gt; they&#39;re asleep.   If sleep had been something children &quot;had to&quot; do <br/>
and now they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; told they &quot;don&#39;t have to,&quot; they&#39;re &quot;being adult&quot; by staying up.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Their motive is not to be up because they want to be, but because <br/>
the gate <br/>

<h4>Stacy Sargent</h4>
<p><small><time>27 Oct 2005, at  1:40am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124511572">I could use some input from you wonderful folks on a related issue at <br/>
my home: my older DS (7 1/2) goes to bed when he&#39;s ready- usually it&#39;s <br/>
2:30 am or later.  My younger DS (5 1/2) almost always goes to bed when <br/>
I do (which is around 11), and we snuggle and read and fall asleep <br/>
together.  Sometimes my DS will come read with us, then get back up if <br/>
he is not ready for sleep.  He is very considerate of noise and keeps <br/>
the tv volume low, turns out the lights and then crawls in bed with us, <br/>
or sometimes gets in his own bed after snuggling for just a little.  <br/>
Sometimes he&#39;ll fall asleep in front of the tv (which is in the living <br/>
room) and my husband will carry him into bed.<br/>
<br/>
This has been going fairly well, except on the nights younger DS wants <br/>
to stay up late with older DS- then they are loud.  I have pretty much <br/>
said, since we started this, that younger DS needs to come to bed when <br/>
I do.  Sometimes he&#39;ll really want to stay up, especially if he&#39;s had a <br/>
late nap, so I usually stay up later too, then entice him into bed with <br/>
a story and he usually comes to bed without complaint.<br/>
<br/>
I started questioning myself, though, when reading some of the posts <br/>
related to Jill&#39;s question.  Was I giving them too much choice at too <br/>
young of an age?  I think I got my answer to that question when my <br/>
younger DS said, &quot;but you said we could do whatever we wanted to do&quot; in <br/>
response to my telling him it was time to go to bed last night.  I need <br/>
to work on gradually letting them have more and more choices, with the <br/>
understanding that those choices might be reduced if certain conditions <br/>
aren&#39;t met.  I let go of bedtimes and tv restrictions last February, in <br/>
an abrupt way, and I now know I could have been more gradual about it.  <br/>
Also, I know it is me that has fostered this environment where they <br/>
think they can do whatever they want, and this has led to other <br/>
problems away from home (when trying to leave the park or a friend&#39;s <br/>
house, or unacceptable behavior in stores- roughhousing, being too <br/>
loud, and when I say stop they don&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
Back to the bedtime issue, older DS rarely remembers to brush his teeth <br/>
before he goes to bed.  I need to help him more in the morning and <br/>
during the day to remember to brush, so at least he&#39;s brushing at least <br/>
once a day.  Also, he often does not want to eat when he first gets up, <br/>
so he&#39;s eating his first food of the day often at 1 or 2 pm, then is <br/>
hungry all evening, and eats a lot after I&#39;ve gone to bed.  He selects <br/>
popsicles, popcorn, snacky stuff, and I&#39;m concerned about his food <br/>
quality, especially when I&#39;m not awake to help him get something he <br/>
might prefer if someone were up who could fix it for him (he eats <br/>
really well, usually, in terms of veggies, fruits, etc., and can choose <br/>
whatever he wants).  Or, he asks me to cook him food at 10 or 11pm, and <br/>
I&#39;m just not in the mood to cook when I&#39;m tired and ready for bed.  <br/>
He&#39;s not confident with the microwave yet, so won&#39;t heat up food by <br/>
himself.  Also, I&#39;m concerned that when he stays up really late he gets <br/>
8 to 10 hours of sleep, usually on the lower end of this range, but on <br/>
the nights he has gone to bed before midnight, he&#39;ll sleep 11 hours or <br/>
so, which has been his normal sleep amount for a couple of years (and <br/>
before we let go of bedtimes; he has always needed a lot sleep).  Also, <br/>
if he&#39;s falling asleep in front of the tv and not getting himself to <br/>
bed, is he really listening to his body about sleep?<br/>
<br/>
So, last night I told him he needed to come to bed when I did, the <br/>
situation was not working due to the toothbrushing and food and sleep <br/>
amount issues!  I wish I had not changed things so abruptly, and with <br/>
no family discussion or input from him on the matter- my big screwup.   <br/>
I said the same thing tonight, and he seemed fine when we made sure we <br/>
recorded his shows that were on late at night and he would be missing.  <br/>
He slept 12 1/2 hours last night, and fell asleep tonight about 10:30 <br/>
with little trouble.  He still ate his first food at about 1 pm today, <br/>
and then had a good dinner and late snack.  We were busy with Halloween <br/>
costume making today and tonight, so I did not do as good as job as I <br/>
could have getting him some extra food in there during the day.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing to throw in- my DH really does not like it that older DS <br/>
stays up late- he feels he misses out on being with my son so much, as <br/>
DS is usually asleep all morning (my DH is semi-retired, so is home two <br/>
days of the workweek), and then stays up hours after my DH goes to bed <br/>
around 10 or 10:30.  He very much would like us all to be going to bed <br/>
around the same time, so his sleep and the sleep of my older DS match <br/>
up better.  Also, my DH and I enjoy going to church together, but this <br/>
is really tough when older DS has been up very late, and then <br/>
can&#39;t/won&#39;t get up at 8:30 to get ready for church.  He really does not <br/>
enjoy church right now, but the rest of us do, and one of us ends up <br/>
having to stay home with older DS.  I&#39;m not expecting him to go every <br/>
Sunday, but once a month would be nice so DH and I could go together.<br/>
<br/>
We are planning to look into Tivo, so we can more easily record the <br/>
shows he enjoys and make sure he doesn&#39;t miss his faves.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve read this far, thanks!!!!  I know this is terribly long.  Did <br/>
I yank back his self-regulating bedtime too abruptly, and should I let <br/>
go of that again,  or would it be best to go with the bedtime for a <br/>
while, see how the recording of shows, toothbrushing, etc., goes, then <br/>
gradually let go of the bedtime (even if that is over the next couple <br/>
of years?)  Any thoughts and input would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Stacy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>==============<br/>
<br/>
Lots of adults read themselves to sleep, or watch late night TV and turn the <br/>
TV off when they wake up later. &lt;g&gt;   I don&#39;t think it&#39;s immoral.    <br/>
<br/>
When my kids were younger they were quite likely to fall asleep during a <br/>
movie, on the couch or on a futon in front of the TV.   When they got older, 12 <br/>
and so, they really wanted their own beds, but Holly still falls asleep to a CD, <br/>
and Kirby has a timer on his TV.   Marty used to watch TV, but now just turns <br/>
the lights off and goes to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I said the same thing tonight, and he seemed fine when we made sure we<br/>
recorded his shows that were on late at night and he would be missing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That made a big difference with us in lots of ways, recording things.   Kids <br/>
were willing to risk being out of the house &quot;too long&quot; if we had set whichever <br/>
favorite show to record.   And after a while they got to the point they might <br/>
not even watch the tapes at all (me too, for my own favorites a few years <br/>
back) and as they got older and more confident there would be reruns (and now, <br/>
confident they can see it on DVD later), they cared less.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One more thing to throw in- my DH really does not like it that older DS<br/>
stays up late- he feels he misses out on being with my son so much, as<br/>
DS is usually asleep all morning (my DH is semi-retired, so is home two<br/>
days of the workweek), and then stays up hours after my DH goes to bed<br/>
around 10 or 10:30. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you talked to your son about that?   On the day before his dad&#39;s going <br/>
to be home, do you remind him to go to sleep earlier so he can hang out with <br/>
his dad?<br/>
<br/>
-=- Also, my DH and I enjoy going to church together, but this<br/>
is really tough when older DS has been up very late, and then<br/>
can&#39;t/won&#39;t get up at 8:30 to get ready for church.  He really does not<br/>
enjoy church right now, but the rest of us do, and one of us ends up<br/>
having to stay home with older DS. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Can you get someone else to stay with him?   If not, I&#39;d just say &quot;Until <br/>
you&#39;re old enough to stay home alone, you need to go with us, because dad really <br/>
wants to go.&quot;   And on Saturday night, count back eight hours from when he <br/>
would need to get up and go to church, and tell him to go to bed then.   If he&#39;s <br/>
too sleepy, he&#39;ll learn to go to sleep earlier.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s something scheduled, that should take priority over sleeping <br/>
whenever.   There ARE reasons to sleep, and reasons sometimes to plan ahead about <br/>
sleeping.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could tell your son that staying up as late as he can is as <br/>
arbitrary and inflexible as a 9:00 bedtime, and he&#39;s disrupting your life the same <br/>
way a traditional by-the-clock bedtime would disrubt his.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-  I&#39;m not expecting him to go every<br/>
Sunday, but once a month would be nice so DH and I could go together.<br/>
-=-   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Would be so nice&quot; sounds so wistful for a thing you should JUST DO, I think. <br/>
    It seems that making dibs on certain things you REALLY want to do as a <br/>
couple or as a family and telling him he just needs to go with you is not at ALL <br/>
unreasonable.   Does he have scheduled things he goes to? (Lessons, scouts, <br/>
something you always take him to?)     He shouldn&#39;t leave you hanging until the <br/>
last minute and have control of whether you get to go or not.    You wouldn&#39;t <br/>
do that to him, would you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-  Did I yank back his self-regulating bedtime too abruptly, and should I <br/>
let<br/>
go of that again,  or would it be best to go with the bedtime for a<br/>
while, see how the recording of shows, toothbrushing, etc., goes, then<br/>
gradually let go of the bedtime (even if that is over the next couple<br/>
of years?) -=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me more than just a question of sudden or gradual.   I don&#39;t <br/>
think moving to unschooling gradually is a good idea when the question involves <br/>
reading lessons or a curriculum or forced math.   But in either case, I don&#39;t <br/>
think the parents (or ANY adults) should do something so drastic without really <br/>
understanding it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In the early stage of the idea of relaxing bedtimes, I think it starts with <br/>
people coming to discussions like these all tense and frustrated because they <br/>
can&#39;t control their kids, and saying &quot;How can I make them go to bed on time?&quot;   <br/>
And the questions and suggestions might involve &quot;Why?&quot; or &quot;You don&#39;t HAVE to <br/>
have a time,&quot; or &quot;Which is more important--rules or your relationship?&quot;     <br/>
All those ideas are good to consider, but to just register &quot;some people don&#39;t <br/>
have a bedtime&quot; and declaring that now YOU don&#39;t have a bedtime seems to me to <br/>
be replacing one &quot;rule&quot; with another.    <br/>
<br/>
Your rule now seems to be that parents won&#39;t tell your older child when to go <br/>
to sleep.   His &quot;right&quot; to stay up is the priority, more important than <br/>
church, more important than being with his dad.<br/>
<br/>
(On the other hand, does his dad do cool things with him on those days home?  <br/>
 To expect a child to be up and available just in case dad takes the notion <br/>
to hang out with him doesn&#39;t seem sufficient reason to get up.)<br/>
<br/>
Our staying up always involved the child being old enough to stay up safely <br/>
and quietly, or staying awake, but being in a bed (or having the bed all made <br/>
and available and close by) and having a long video and some drinks and snacks <br/>
at hand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470188485">** I think I got my answer to that question when my<br/>
younger DS said, &quot;but you said we could do whatever we wanted to do&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
My answer would include &quot;... as long as you are considerate of other <br/>
people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Being able to see things from the point of view of a different person is <br/>
a skill that some kids develop earlier than others.  Practice probably <br/>
helps.  Perhaps if a child is too young to understand how other people <br/>
feel when they are woken up (or other problems), they are too young to <br/>
make some of these behavior choices independently.<br/>
<br/>
Even older kids and teenagers need guidance from parents.<br/>
<br/>
** Back to the bedtime issue, older DS rarely remembers to brush his teeth<br/>
before he goes to bed.  I need to help him more in the morning and<br/>
during the day to remember to brush, so at least he&#39;s brushing at least<br/>
once a day. **<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old is more of a night person than I am, but he usually <br/>
doesn&#39;t stay up more than an hour after I go to bed.  We encourage him <br/>
to brush his teeth and take his medicine when we are doing our teeth and <br/>
medicine.<br/>
<br/>
**Or, he asks me to cook him food at 10 or 11pm, and<br/>
I&#39;m just not in the mood to cook when I&#39;m tired and ready for bed.  **<br/>
<br/>
I relate to that.  I&#39;m not enthusiastic about cooking after 10, because <br/>
10 is the time I like to go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
** We are planning to look into Tivo, so we can more easily record the<br/>
shows he enjoys and make sure he doesn&#39;t miss his faves.**<br/>
<br/>
We really like being able to record TV shows on a PVR thing like TiVo.  <br/>
It&#39;s handy.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>

it&#39;s simply a desire for my focused attention more than food need (and <br/>
sometimes it&#39;s food and sometimes it&#39;s both). Some things we have <br/>
done: <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll &#39;announce&#39; when I&#39;m going to sleep and that if anyone wants <br/>
anything, now is the time to ask. I&#39;m the wage earner in the family so <br/>
I need to be up early (I&#39;m usually at my desk around 7:45 am), DH and <br/>
DS can sleep however long they want generally, so DS knows that when I <br/>
say I&#39;m going to sleep, I am. If I&#39;m heading to bed but planning to <br/>
read or watch TV, I&#39;ll note that as well since I&#39;ll be awake a while <br/>
longer. Once I&#39;m asleep, I&#39;m asleep - unless there&#39;s vomiting or <br/>
bloodshed or something going on.<br/>
<br/>
We keep readily available foods handy - snack size puddings are a <br/>
current favorite, other popular things include blocks of cheese and a <br/>
manual wire slicer (the wire slicer is nice since it can&#39;t cut skin, <br/>
just cheese), single serving boxes of dry cereal, pre-cut chunks of <br/>
melon in single serving sized ziplocks, baby bel cheese, graham <br/>
crackers with or without peanut butter. In the last 6 months or so, <br/>
he&#39;s gotten more comfortable with the microwave so he can reheat pasta <br/>
or mac & cheese or make an omelette (our microwave has a setting <br/>
called Omelette so we don&#39;t have to worry about properly cooking the <br/>
eggs)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, especially if he has eaten a bunch since dinner, I&#39;ll <br/>
double check with him on his hunger level. I might postpone going to <br/>
get food with him until a commercial or end of a chapter or something <br/>
reasonably short, definite time (not random indefinite &#39;wait&#39;) - <br/>
sometimes he&#39;s still wanting food then, other times he&#39;s gotten <br/>
involved in something else *with* me (snuggling, talking, reading, <br/>
watching TV, playing a computer game with DH, etc) and drops the food <br/>
request because what he was &#39;hungry&#39; for was the attention, not the <br/>
calories.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes DH will go take care of it if DS wants food and I&#39;m asleep <br/>
or almost asleep. So that&#39;s another alternative - it doesn&#39;t always <br/>
have to be you getting up (if you&#39;ve got a spouse or SO that is).<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that there are more ways to address this than saying No <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918897591">Thank you so much for the replies.  I need to work to be sure he has <br/>
some good snacks readily available, and yes, my DH will help out, but <br/>
he is  the wage earner in our family so he needs to be asleep before I <br/>
do most nights.<br/>
<br/>
I have mixed feelings about the church issue- I do not want to force <br/>
church on either of my children, but I think I&#39;ve gotten out of balance <br/>
on the issue of choice.  His refusal to go means I or my husband can&#39;t <br/>
go at this point (we don&#39;t have anyone available to stay with him on a <br/>
regular basis Sunday mornings).  So, I can see letting him know we are <br/>
going as a family, and as Sandra suggested, until he can stay home <br/>
alone he needs to go with us.  This is the only regular family activity <br/>
we do that we don&#39;t all enjoy- our other family outings are things <br/>
everyone loves (camping, movies, parks, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We encourage him<br/>
to brush his teeth and take his medicine when we are doing our teeth and<br/>
medicine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He will brush with me, no problem.  It&#39;s when he stays up several hours <br/>
after I do and snacks that he forgets.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;On the day before his dad&#39;s going<br/>
to be home, do you remind him to go to sleep earlier so he can hang out <br/>
with<br/>
his dad? And on Saturday night, count back eight hours from when he<br/>
would need to get up and go to church, and tell him to go to bed then.  <br/>
  If he&#39;s<br/>
too sleepy, he&#39;ll learn to go to sleep earlier.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried this, and he will say he is just not sleepy.  I can <br/>
understand this- if I am used to going to sleep at a certain time, say <br/>
11 pm, often times I am just not sleepy earlier in the evening.  In his <br/>
case, after several nights of staying up until 2 or 3 am and then when <br/>
I ask him to go to bed at 11 pm or midnight, he will say he just isn&#39;t <br/>
sleepy, will lie in bed a while, I&#39;ll give him a backrub and lay with <br/>
him, but most of the time he will get back up.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your rule now seems to be that parents won&#39;t tell your older child <br/>
when to go<br/>
to sleep.   His &quot;right&quot; to stay up is the priority, more important than<br/>
church, more important than being with his dad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right, Sandra.  Again, I think in my zeal to let go of <br/>
controls on him, I have let the pendulum swing completely to the <br/>
opposite end (I don&#39;t know if you remember, but you were gracious <br/>
enough to correspond via email with me last February when I was <br/>
struggling with tv and letting go of controls on it.  Along with <br/>
dropping the tv controls, I dropped the bedtime controls.).  While he <br/>
is still young and needs someone home with him and fixing him the <br/>
majority of his meals and making sure he&#39;s keeping up with oral care, <br/>
he probably needs to be more in sync with us on the sleep times.  I <br/>
know also he misses being with me and his dad, and would love for me to <br/>
stay up and watch with him.  With a younger child who wakes up early <br/>
and wanting to be with my husband, I just don&#39;t want to do this on a <br/>
regular basis.  He has wanted to stay up all night, until the sun comes <br/>
up, and the other night I said let&#39;s do it.  We made it until 4 am, and <br/>
then he said let&#39;s go to bed.  I kind of had my second wind by that <br/>
time and I think I could have made it, but I readily agreed.  We <br/>
snuggled a lot that night and I got to watch some of his favorite shows <br/>
with him and we both really enjoyed being together.  So, I know he <br/>
really needs this time with us, and he is not getting it when he is <br/>
alone and awake hours after the rest of the house has gone to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Any other thoughts?  I guess I am still sorting out in my mind to some <br/>
extent the issue of control versus family lifestyle/rights, needs, and <br/>
wants of everyone being considered.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
Stacy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We -always- have DS&#39; &quot;Church bag&quot; - it contains his Gameboy (with <br/>
headphones and the a/c adapter, we sit near an outlet in the back), <br/>
sketchpad, markers, pens, lined paper notebook, a couple of misc <br/>
items depending on what he wants to bring (maybe a book or two or a <br/>
pair of matchbox cars, or whatever), plus a bottle of water and some <br/>
snacking materials (like baby bel cheese or cut out cheese shapes - <br/>
provolone slices and mini cookie cutters work great - maybe cookies <br/>
or snack bars or fruit snacks or graham crackers, we discuss what to <br/>
put in and I&#39;ll also put in the occasional extra surprise item as <br/>
well). And, too, we stop someplace for lunch each week - not always <br/>
his favorite place but we usually pick someplace that is reasonable <br/>
for all, sometimes a favorite sometimes it&#39;s just &#39;ok&#39; (mostly <br/>
because we do this every week and we all like a bit of variety now <br/>
and again - DS would happily go to the same place every week but DH <br/>
and I would get a bit tired of it, so we discuss and discuss and <br/>
come to agreement - often it&#39;s not the place, it&#39;s a specific item <br/>
DS is wanting and as long as he can get that, he&#39;s okay anywhere). <br/>
And sometimes one of us will stay home. Sometimes it&#39;s a matter of <br/>
habit (or getting out of the habit) - we were away at the conference <br/>
for one Sunday then home with the flu the following Sunday, and the <br/>
next Sunday, DS said he didn&#39;t want to go to church. I sat and <br/>
talked with him, giving him info on my feelings, finding out what he <br/>
was thinking/feeling, and since he can&#39;t stay home alone at this <br/>
point, coming to church would have to happen - but we then moved <br/>
right to him choosing what to pack in his bag and discussing where <br/>
we&#39;d go for lunch and all instead of dwelling on the negatives OR <br/>
trying to argue him into changing his feelings. He still didn&#39;t -<br/>
feel- like it, but he recognized that he couldn&#39;t stay home alone <br/>
and we did as much as we could (snacks, playthings, etc) to make it <br/>
as comfortable for him to come along as possible - and making <br/>
specific plans for lunch and afternoon activities (playing Age of <br/>
Empires with DH for instance).<br/>

When our children were babies and others would ask &quot;when does he go to bed?&quot; <br/>
Keith used to say &quot;About half an hour after he goes to sleep.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
For the first MANY years of their lives, our kids fell asleep being nursed, <br/>
or being held or rocked by dad or mom, or in the car on the way home from <br/>
something fun.   They slept because they were sleepy, not because we told them to.  <br/>
 So when they got older, they would fall asleep near us, happily.<br/>
<br/>
We never minded putting them in the bed after they were asleep.   It was rare <br/>
they went to sleep in the bed.   They would wake up there (or in our bed, or <br/>
on the couch or on a floor bed) knowing only that they had been put there and <br/>
covered up by somone who loved them.<br/>
<br/>
Going to sleep wasn&#39;t about &quot;going to bed.&quot;<br/>
