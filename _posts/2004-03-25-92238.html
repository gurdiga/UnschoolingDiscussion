<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107037319">Hi, everyone,<br/>
<br/>
We recently lost two beloved pets under tragic circumstances, and I&#39;m hoping <br/>
someone can recommend some books on mourning a pet for a four year old.  If <br/>
this is OT, you can send it off-list.<br/>
<br/>
We had some strays in the neighborhood, and there was a dogfight with two of <br/>
our three dogs.  My Schipperke &quot;lost&quot; and we had him sewed up, had the strays <br/>
taken to the Humane Society.  Then six weeks later, for some reason I cannot <br/>
fathom, our husky/lab mix (who was always very gentle and would bark a special <br/>
bark when our Schipperke had a seizure), attacked the Schipperke again.  In <br/>
front of my four year old son.  <br/>
<br/>
Two days later, the Schipperke died, moments after I left from spending <br/>
almost two hours with him.  Because we have young children and due to the <br/>
unexplained attack, we made the difficult decision to take our husky/lab mix (white, <br/>
with one blue eye and one brown eye) to the Humane Society.  We would never have <br/>
gotten rid of him, but were concerned he would attack our remaining dog.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, we are grieving.  Both pets had been life long companions to our <br/>
children, and the Schipperke was my &quot;baby before the human babies.&quot;  Any <br/>
juvenile literature to help my children through this tough time would be <br/>
appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614384454">Though not necessarily pet loss specific, a wonderful book is _All I <br/>
See Is Part of Me_ by Chara M. Curtis.  I&#39;ve seen it recommended in <br/>
Mothering magazine for grief of losing a parent so I&#39;m sure it would <br/>
help with the loss of a beloved animal companion too.   Sorry to hear <br/>
about your loss.  HTH<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473789206">&lt;&lt;Hi, everyone,<br/>
<br/>
We recently lost two beloved pets under tragic<br/>
circumstances, and I&#39;m <br/>
hoping <br/>
someone can recommend some books on mourning a pet for<br/>
a four year old.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry for your loss, and that I don&#39;t have any<br/>
resources for you.  <br/>
<br/>
I lost one of my pets yesterday.  She was a fish, but<br/>
still, we had had her for years, and she was my last<br/>
goldie.  My husband cleaned out the tank because I<br/>
couldn&#39;t do it.  <br/>
<br/>
Share your grief with your child, and let your child<br/>
do the same.  Don&#39;t expect the grieving to be over<br/>
even when it seems to be.  Things will come up to<br/>
remind you all over again of your loss, and that&#39;s the<br/>
way we sometimes process grief.  <br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem your child may experience is a<br/>
feeling of lack of control over the world, that death<br/>
brings.  I would be open to discussing that bad things<br/>
happen, and that it&#39;s our reaction to things that<br/>
count in life, even when we have no say in the matter<br/>
of death, we can still keep our hearts open and love<br/>
freely.  That loss is not the end, there are new<br/>
beginnings, as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
~Aimee</div>
