<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314478825">Excuse me if I am speaking out of turn as I am still fairly new to <br/>
this list. (not to unschooling, we have been unschooling for ten <br/>
years)  I am wondering if some other newbies are feeling the same <br/>
way that I do about other posters being &quot;jumped on&quot; whenever they <br/>
speak out on subjects they are passionate about.  I read Ren&#39;s post <br/>
or Bob&#39;s post or Ned&#39;s post and I think how wonderful it is that <br/>
they feel so strongly about something, and the next thing I know <br/>
someone is telling them they are rude or that they are &quot;off-topic&quot; <br/>
and basically they are asked to &quot;shut-up&quot; if they can&#39;t stay &quot;on-<br/>
topic&quot;.   I am confused.  I thought &quot;unschooling&quot; meant learning all <br/>
your life, and can&#39;t we learn all our life, right now as parents, <br/>
even from those who don&#39;t speak quite the way we would like them <br/>
to.  I learn from the posts on rap music even though I already know <br/>
I don&#39;t want any of that kind of music being listened to by my <br/>
children.  I learn from Ned&#39;s anti-school posts because, heck, I am <br/>
pretty anti-school myself.  Isn&#39;t everyone who UNschools?  (because <br/>
if we weren&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t we just call it homeschooling or school at <br/>
home?)  I hated grade school, it was a living hell for me, but I <br/>
loved high school and was very popular, but I still believe school <br/>
is the worst place to LEARN in almost all cases!  If Ned comes <br/>
across as rude to some, if someone thinks Bob is personally <br/>
attacking them, there are others of us (I can&#39;t be the only one!) <br/>
who really don&#39;t see it that way when we read a post.  If someone <br/>
brought up immunizations (and I will in a minute in a different <br/>
post) or abortion, I would be frantically typing with my very strong <br/>
and passionate views on these two topics, and in my frentic typing I <br/>
might come across to some as being &quot;rude&quot; only because these are <br/>
topics are so very close to my heart.  The institution of government <br/>
school is obviously a very important topic to Ned.  So what if you <br/>
don&#39;t like what he has to say about it, you are tired of it, or it <br/>
gets &quot;too political&quot;?  It is still about unschooling, right?  Or am <br/>
I wrong?   Isn&#39;t anything related to school topics naturally related <br/>
to UNschool topics?    Am I the only one annoyed (and a little <br/>
scared that it will happen to me, too, if I post) when someone takes <br/>
another person&#39;s post and picks it apart from one end to the other, <br/>
taking little pieces of it and responding as if it was written only <br/>
to annoy them, and trying desperately to tear their thoughts apart <br/>
in a way that makes it seem like they only want them to just SHUT-UP <br/>
already?<br/>
Ned, DO you have an agenda when you talk about the public school <br/>
system?  Do you want our votes?   OR, is it just me that thinks <br/>
these kind of discussions are healthy for adult unschoolers, and <br/>
that controversy is part of an unschooler&#39;s life?   This mother at <br/>
home with five children likes a little jump-start to her gray matter <br/>
each morning over her first cup of coffee.<br/>
My point is, and I do have one, why exactly do we keep jumping on <br/>
Ned and Bob and anyone else who seems to have very strong feelings <br/>
one way or the other on subjects that seem to me to fit very neatly <br/>
into an unschooling discussion?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057383519">Because, Mary. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve taken a class in university on the arts, or culture, or literature; <br/>
or if you&#39;ve attended a lecture by, say, David Hackett Fischer, or E. O. <br/>
Wilson, you might have found that many folks will not carry forth a rational <br/>
argument, much less *listen* to someone attempting so much. Instead, they <br/>
shout down, or throw food (or blood, in Wilson&#39;s case) at whomever is saying <br/>
what it is they don&#39;t want to hear. They cover their ears. This has been <br/>
happening on campuses all across America for two decades now. It goes on <br/>
today, and it is killing democracy.<br/>
<br/>
I too checked back in at this list a few months ago hoping to get a little <br/>
enlightenment. Really. I find unschooling attractive, haven&#39;t the guts to <br/>
completely become one, but use the ideas as best I can. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never once posted anything serious at this list with the hope that <br/>
people would agree with me. I was almost sure that they wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;ve read <br/>
people&#39;s posts here over the years (and at the old HEM list), and have got a <br/>
good feel for who and what resides. We don&#39;t agree on much.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, I believe that if someone has something that they think is <br/>
important and relevant, they have almost a duty to write it, or tell it, to <br/>
others. This is the only way democracy will ever move forward. <br/>
<br/>
But democracy requires a few other things as well, and, unfortunately, one of <br/>
the marks of democratic civilization has almost disappeared, and that is <br/>
listening: Listening to words on a page, the voice coming from the person <br/>
next to you, from across the auditorium, or on the screen in front of you. <br/>
<br/>
By &quot;listening,&quot; I don&#39;t mean &quot;agreeing with.&quot; I mean making the attempt to <br/>
understand, which requires taking words and sentences for what they say. <br/>
Weighing and evaluating, bringing up mistakes if you find any, validating <br/>
truth, all with the intention of moving civilization forward. <br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t much listening going on at this list. Lots of reacting, but very <br/>
little listening.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your courage to say what you think. I doubt you even agree with <br/>
the things I said, but you listened to them, and others.<br/>
<br/>

I think hundreds of people read everything that is written here.<br/>
I think civilization is not beholden to any one person&#39;s or group&#39;s opinion <br/>
of the direction in which it should move.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are changing the world.  Some people would like to stop that.  <br/>
Even many other homeschoolers would just like us stopped, right here and <br/>
right now.    They think we&#39;re being unAmerican, no doubt, because we&#39;re not <br/>
making our kids pledge allegience each morning.  They think we&#39;re not helping <br/>
move civilization forward.  They think we&#39;re neglectful and our children will <br/>
never be able to take tests, hold jobs, or go to college.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard those things for many years.  I really listened, but that didn&#39;t <br/>
make the people right.  And I understand where they&#39;re coming from, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I respect them any more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407170014">I, for one, appreciate your words here, Bob.  Even I have been guilty of what you have stated here, I will admit.  I am brand new to this group, but the diversity of thoughts and ideas here was the big attraction, I admit.  I don&#39;t see much more than &quot;follow the leader&quot; going on anywhere else I&#39;ve been.  I don&#39;t think that type of mental attitude holds democracy in place.  It&#39;s a surefire recipe for disaster, as a matter of fact.  I find it to be a &quot;let&#39;s all follow the pied piper over the cliff&quot; type of attitude.  Going a different direction may not be the easiest path in life, but it might get a person alot farther than playing &quot;follow the leader&quot;.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure you realize just how square on the head you have hit the nail. <br/>
Yes! Freedom IS killing democracy: Freedom without the accompanying &quot;ought&#39;s&quot; <br/>
and &quot;should&#39;s.&quot; &quot;Ought I listen to this person and take them seriously and <br/>
try to understand them?&quot; &quot;Should I say such and such a thing in response?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ought I listen to and possibly engage David Hackett Fischer -- possibly the <br/>
most important cultural historian of our time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Should I pay attention to what E. O. Wilson -- possibly one of the most <br/>
important sociobiologists of our time -- is saying?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Or should I throw food or blood, shout them down so others can&#39;t hear, or <br/>
plug my ears?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right, the plugging ears part is a private issue. Foolish, yet <br/>
private.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, Sandra, you haven&#39;t shut me down, or thrown food. Nor have you <br/>
prevented others from listening to me. But what exactly do you mean by &quot;If <br/>
people democratically decide something is OK, then darned if it isn&#39;t OK?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029963614">Ms. T...I don&#39;t know if this will clarify at all, but when Ned first started posting,<br/>
I found his take on thing very interesting. I loved his unschooling posts and found<br/>
his anti-schooling posts thought provoking. The problem is (for me) is that I heard <br/>
him the first time and the second time and the third and the fourth. I have no <br/>
problem with people speaking up with strong held opinions, but my problem is that Ned<br/>
seems to constantly try to pull the conversations back to his anti-schooling. It makes<br/>
it hard to talk about the day to day. I also do not like the &quot;preaching&quot; aspects of<br/>
his posts...I feel talked down to and I do not feel as if he listens to anything others<br/>
have to say (I&#39;m not saying that he needs to agree with them, just acknowledge that <br/>
others on this list exist). <br/>
<br/>
I find the politics of unschooling/schooling interesting, but to be honest with you it<br/>
is not helping my journey towards complete unschooling. If I wanted politics I would<br/>
join the a hsing political list. Ned&#39;s posts (after the umpteenth time reading them come<br/>
off more as propaganda against schools...well, I have already decided to reject<br/>
schools for my boys...I want to move on)<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is that week that I joined (before Ned) there was a huge argument over <br/>
some people&#39;s interpretation of what unschooling really was. There was a lot of <br/>
bickering and going back and forth. People even left the list and formed a more<br/>
&quot;gentle unschooling&quot; list (which I joined and eventually resubbed because I wasn&#39;t<br/>
really learning much). But at least during that arguing and bickering I was able to<br/>
really read a lot about what unschooling was/was not and I learned a lot. This<br/>
bickering with Ned does not even give me that benefit, since we are not really debating<br/>
unschooling! To be honest with you, I am not sure why he sticks around here if it is not<br/>
what he wants it to be. There are so many lists out there that I have found if I am not<br/>
getting something from it, I go and find another list that suits my needs better.<br/>
<br/>
Still not sure why I am jumping in, except that I really do miss the ebb and flow of topics<br/>
and information that was here before Ned started posting. Nothing personally against Ned,<br/>
but I am just tired of it. Luckily my delete key works....<br/>

that for those who DO read them, they ought to read them with the intent of <br/>

Go back and reread my original email in reply to Pumpkin&#39;s post. I will not <br/>
spend another moment defending myself over it. If you think it&#39;s racist, or <br/>
insulting, or unkind, or has no place at this list, then kick my ass off. <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I intend to continue to pay attention to others&#39; posts, as <br/>
long as I&#39;m allowed.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, all the quotes in my original email were from a cultural critic <br/>
named Stanley Crouch. Do a google search on him if you like, then call him <br/>

truth.<br/>

paying much attention. I for one am getting very tired of the patronizing <br/>
schoolmarmish and frequently nasty attacks by the oldies against newbies and <br/>
those who are admittedly sitting on the fence about unschooling, or those who <br/>
have already grown children. I would think that the oldies would be <br/>
attempting to keep the posting lively and fresh by welcoming new and <br/>
different opinions, and by reaping the wisdom of those who&#39;ve been there. Any <br/>
people who might be trying to gather the courage to embark on unschooling, <br/>
and also those who just wish to be enlightened are going to head for the <br/>
hills in disgust while being convinced that unschooling is just another dead <br/>
end to discussion, controlled by 3 or 4 women punch drunk on a virtual power <br/>
trip.<br/>
<br/>
When anyone acts like big brother and tries to control what I hear, see or <br/>
say, I feel strongly that my intelligence is doubted. Aren&#39;t you other 780 <br/>
people insulted by the idea that 3 or 4 people think they are soooo smart <br/>
that they know what&#39;s good for you, and what&#39;s not?!<br/>
<br/>
I am a big girl who is not afraid of any knowledge, because I am perfectly <br/>
capable of separating the wheat from the chaff. I also have faith that most <br/>
of my fellow adult human beings, can do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be discouraged Bob, you are not alone in your quest for intelligent <br/>
discussion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Seems to me some people new to the list could maybe stand to reap the <br/>
wisdom of folks who have been on this and similar discussion lists a <br/>
long time and who really do have a basis for not wanting the list to <br/>
turn into a lot of anti-school tirades. Maybe the new folks could <br/>
read back in the archives for a couple of months and see what the <br/>
moderators have been dealing with. I seldom post but I&#39;ve been on <br/>
this list since the first month it started...long enough to know that <br/>
the list owner and moderators are being incredibly patient, hardly on <br/>
a virtual power trip. Wouldn&#39;t the term &quot;power trip&quot; better fit the 1 <br/>
or 2 men who seem to want to change the list to fit their agendas? <br/>
Especially when there are lists just for the kind of posts they want <br/>
to make? List that they&#39;ve been directed to and on which at least one <br/>
of them already posts? Why do they want so much to change this list <br/>
to fit their vision of what it should be? Sounds like a power trip to <br/>
me.<br/>

what I decided I needed to do when the volume on this list got turned <br/>
up again; instead of replying (reacting) to every post I decided to <br/>
just stop and read and try to make sense of what was happening, who <br/>
was saying what - and why they were saying it, paying special <br/>
attention to words, phrases, and people that seemingly rubbed me the <br/>
wrong way.<br/>
<br/>
Back to reading now.<br/>
