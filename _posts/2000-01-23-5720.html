<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118866081">John, can I pick your brain &lt;g&gt;  The kidlets love &quot;The Shining&quot; and want to<br/>
stay at the hotel it was filmed in.  I understand it is at Hood Mountain,<br/>
do you know if this is true or not???  It was back in the dark ages that I<br/>
lived in Portland and only remember that you head north from CA and hang a<br/>
right when you reach Portland.  Guess I won&#39;t get a job too soon as a<br/>
navigator %-}<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that is a sorry excuse and terribly unclear %-{  I should have said<br/>
that we will be traveling up your way in about 2 to 4 weeks and that was<br/>
why we were interested.  :::sigh:::  I didn&#39;t come by the title of &quot;CAM&quot;<br/>
without lots of hard work!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  Is is o.k. to print out your essays??   The kidlets hate to read<br/>
things on the computer and instead like to carry them around and dig<br/>
through books or look at maps when they are reading about some place. <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard that as well.  I didn&#39;t see the movie though, so I don&#39;t have any<br/>
more specific information.  While you&#39;re in Portland, you may want to stop<br/>
at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.  Children usually love to go<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>

you&#39;d like.<br/>
