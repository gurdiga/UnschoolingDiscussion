<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935500547">&quot;Favorite curriculum-We had parents bring some of their favorite <br/>
curriculum to<br/>
show and talk about what they liked best about it. Including <br/>
websites.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is an unschooling support group?  Why would unschoolers be <br/>
comparing any kind of curriculum?<br/>
We don&#39;t do &quot;parent meetings&quot; ever, the kids are always welcome.<br/>
