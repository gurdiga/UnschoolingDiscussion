<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084451684">This &quot;study&quot; as I understand it was funded several layers down by the drug<br/>
companies.  This has been done several times in the past when the scripts<br/>
for Ritalin have fallen off or too many studies have come out giving the<br/>
&quot;bad&quot; info about Ritalin.  Also, it must be remembered that the drug<br/>
companies are just about to release a new &quot;better&quot; form of Ritalin!  Each<br/>
time a new drug comes out there are lots of studies to prove just how much<br/>
it is/will be needed.<br/>
<br/>
There have been studies done that show that the school environment (both in<br/>
teacher/student/other student relationships and the physical environment as<br/>
in &quot;sick&quot; buildings) is harmful and that students did much better and<br/>
without many types of drug therapy, not just Ritalin, when removed from the<br/>
ps environment.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted, researchers<br/>
<br/>
             have found that the drug Ritalin, the subject of sharp debate <br/>
<br/>
for three<br/>
<br/>
          decades, was more effective than behavior-modification therapy in<br/>
<br/>
          treating children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. &quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course no one studied whether getting kids out of a noisy, stressful <br/>
