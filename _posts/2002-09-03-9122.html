 </span></blockquote>Just recently my conservative MIL asked my boys (9 & 11) if they knew the<br/>
Pledge of Allegiance and they didn&#39;t really know it. She challenged (bribed)<br/>
them to learn it by telling them that if they could say it by memory when<br/>
they saw her next, she would pay them some money - a whopping $2.50 each! My<br/>
boys almost didn&#39;t do it because they said $2.50 was not enough to go<br/>
through the trouble of memorizing it - but they did it anyway to please her,<br/>
mostly, and just to prove to themselves and her that they could do it. They<br/>
did memorize it - it took about an hour with me helping them. They recited<br/>
if off perfectly for her - she was VERY impressed and gave them the money.<br/>
Oh yeah, they started to recite it for her at first and didn&#39;t have their<br/>
hand over their heart and she stopped them and said it didn&#39;t count unless<br/>
their right hand was over their heart. Now - about a month or two later -<br/>
they both still DO remember most of it. I remember every word of it from<br/>
when I was in school. My feelings are that I just went along with it all<br/>
figuring that saying something against it would do much more damage than me<br/>
keeping my mouth shut. At least they don&#39;t have to say it every day, when<br/>
class starts, looking at the flag, like I did when I was a kid, not really<br/>
even knowing what I was saying.<br/>
