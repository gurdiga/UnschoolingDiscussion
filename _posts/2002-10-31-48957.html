&lt;&lt; If I were to remarry now or in the future (like if Keith died today), I&#39;m <br/>
49 <br/>
 years old.  I have no business being a 70-year-old mother of a 20 year old.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was part of my decision making process too.<br/>
Although I don&#39;t believe my dh will ever want to have more childrern, he <br/>
wasn&#39;t wanting to commit to that. He just doesn&#39;t want any more with ME!! Lol<br/>
I, on the other hand, am very sure that no matter what happens in life, <br/>
including losing him, I don&#39;t ever want to have another baby.<br/>
So that did weigh into the decision.<br/>
I think dh would only have another child with someone if we all died....and <br/>
even then I don&#39;t think he would even though he&#39;s just 38.<br/>
But you never know.<br/>

such a hurry because he figured I would probably try to talk him into having <br/>
one more baby and that I wouldn&#39;t consider getting myself &quot;fixed.&quot; I had been <br/>
advised by our doctor not to have more babies so I reluctantly agreed with <br/>
his decision. Now that our dd is 3, my dh has even remarked that it might <br/>
have been nice to have one more. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885712301">There is more than a calendar to natural family planning now -<br/>
and probably always has been among folks in tune with their<br/>
bodies.  After a few months of using NFP, you will find which of<br/>
the multiple indicators of fertility are easiest for you to keep<br/>
up with.  My daughter-in-law swears by basal temperature; I am<br/>
more of a cervix and mucus kind of girl (especially with peri<br/>
menopause beginning to rear its head); my mother was blessed with<br/>
reliable mittelschmertz, which gave her a fool proof half of the<br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
...and ya know, we each are pretty happy with the number of kids<br/>
we have - though my mother lost a number to miscarriage, and my<br/>

Of course if you were using NFP, you would know you&#39;d ovulated early.  NFP is <br/>
very effective if used correctly.  Avoiding intercourse around day 14 in a 28 <br/>
day cycle is not very effective at all. Kimme</div>

Calendar method doesn&#39;t work.  That&#39;s one reason Catholic families tend to<br/>
be big.  I conceived Heather when my period was due in 3 days.  And I had<br/>
always been bang on regular.  That was<br/>
back when I didn&#39;t know about temps or cervical mucus.  Oh well, she&#39;s<br/>
always known she was the best mistake I ever made.<br/>
