<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743959362">(as if ALL children aren&#39;t special in their own ways!! ANYWAY)<br/>
 <br/>
I was thinking...if one of my children had Down&#39;s Syndrome or something, we wouldn&#39;t be seeking to do anything but help them to be their best, to encourage them every step of the way, etc. We wouldn&#39;t be expecting them to do ANYTHING before they are 100% ready to do that...<br/>
 <br/>
So why can it be so hard to do the same for our children who are &quot;normal?!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
It has had me sitting back and re-evaluating EVERYTHING which is good I suppose...<br/>
