&gt; Unfortunately I see that same self-rightiousness rearing it&#39;s head in the<br/>
&gt; &quot;let them watch whatever they want&quot; camp.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not much of a camper :) but sure, I suffer from self-righteousness as<br/>
much as the next human. Nobody&#39;s immune.<br/>
<br/>
That brings us back to everyone thinking their way is better, or they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be doing it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;let them watch whatever they want&quot; camp. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But here&#39;s the difference:<br/>
Those who are complaining of discord, frustration, unhappy kids, allergies <br/>
are those who are defending limits.<br/>
<br/>
Thos saying &quot;we don&#39;t have those problems&quot; are suggesting removing the <br/>
limits, and have success stories to go with their decisions.<br/>
<br/>
In the course of offering suggestions of things which have worked well for <br/>
us, we&#39;re being insulted by those totally unwilling to consider doing that, <br/>
sure that we&#39;re nuts.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s exactly like structured families and school-using families&#39; analysis of <br/>
unschooling.  It will never work, how will they learn to read, how will they <br/>
learn math, they&#39;ll never get a job, they won&#39;t write unless you  make them, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
The food thing works like unschooling works, and for many of the same <br/>
reasons.  Humans are organisms with the inborn need and ability to grow and <br/>
learn.   Controls often backfire.<br/>
