<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688663880">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;m pondering where my food issues may stem from, I keep coming back to the Naturopath(s) I have seen as a mother, after my children were born, that seemed to scare the bejeezus out of me when it came to my children&#39;s health.  They talked about not absorbing nutrients, ruined intestinal villa, not enough &quot;good&quot; bacteria, food allergies until we were eating only rice, etc.etc. etc.  I was led to believe my kids were quite mortal......has anyone else had to detoxify from this kind of experience with naturopaths/natural health advisors? <br/>
<br/>
 BTW, their health didn&#39;t improve until we let go of all those incredibly restrictive inane diet beliefs and allowed all foods into our diet along with some intuitive energy medicine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We also see naturopaths, but I really only see them<br/>
for actual problems--my 7 yo has been once in his<br/>
life.  I had one naturopath that was the scare-crazy<br/>
lunatic that you discribe, but I saw her only once and<br/>
saw another after that--I don&#39;t need anyone telling me<br/>
that my breast-feeding child will be brain damaged<br/>
because I&#39;m not getting enough protein or whatever-the<br/>
heck.  But believe me that there are better<br/>
naturopaths out there and they are not all so<br/>
fear-mongering!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040339035">It&#39;s not naturopaths or any one type of health system that is to blame I don&#39;t think.  I think it&#39;s anytime anyone of them tells you to approach something from a position of fear instead of a position of trust.  I have seen that naturopaths  can cause people to look at the world as a scary, fearful place and make them worried that they can&#39;t trust themselves to know what they should eat.   I think fear is one of the worst things we can do for our health.  So yes, I agree, but I also think that more mainstream doctors are full of fear.  It&#39;s just that (as a generalization) mainstream doctors are afraid of germs and can&#39;t trust the body, and naturopaths are afraid of toxins and can&#39;t trust the body.  Kind of like schools can&#39;t trust the mind to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also found that intuitive energy medicine is more in line with what I&#39;ve learned about natural learning through unschooling.  When my homeopath talks about trusting your instincts it&#39;s just like hearing an unschooler talk.  The philosophies fit very nicely together for me.  <br/>
