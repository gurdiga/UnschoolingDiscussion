<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326309344">This mom wrote directly to me but quoted herself from a different list, and <br/>
she isn&#39;t on this one.  Maybe some of you can help her, though:<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a short introduction first:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Satu, an unschooling mother of two (4- and 6 years) from Helsinki.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re probably the only unschooling family in Finland, so you can <br/>
<br/>
just imagine the overwhelming support... :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Been lurking on this list quite awhile, but never got around posting <br/>
<br/>
anything. And now I&#39;ve landed into a little problem, hoping you might <br/>
<br/>
be able to help: Last winter I ran accross an american unschooling-site, <br/>
<br/>
in which there was a page including a &#39;form&#39; or such, meant to be <br/>
<br/>
used as a model, if any family needs to give reasons for their choise <br/>
<br/>
to unschool, in case there&#39;re problems with the state or with the school <br/>
<br/>
district, when a more curriculum-based approach is demanded etc. <br/>
<br/>
The whole concept of unschooling was very well and closely argued, <br/>
<br/>
as well as was the position of parents as the best possible &#39;teachers&#39; <br/>
<br/>
for their own children. I didn&#39;t bookmark the page at the time, and now <br/>
<br/>
I could really make a use of it (I&#39;d like to use the format and the model as <br/>
<br/>
the basis for my own letter: I&#39;m putting together some papers for our school <br/>
<br/>
officials, and I want to do it so well the first time they won&#39;t have a <br/>
reason to <br/>
<br/>
bother us afterwards - I know, I know, I&#39;m a born optimist...) :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember excactly where that particular page was, but <br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling, it was put there by a small support group or such, <br/>
<br/>
which could have been on the east coast... But I&#39;m not definate, <br/>
<br/>
and I don&#39;t seem to find it with any search engine either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would really really appreciate your help, if you happen to know <br/>
<br/>
what site I&#39;m referring to. Or if you know any similar pages or <br/>
<br/>
such, please, give me a hint! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Satu <br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
I sent her a link to Carol Narigon&#39;s curriculum, in case that&#39;s what she had <br/>
seen (and for the benefit of anyone else who hasn&#39;t seen that, it&#39;s at http:/<br/>
/expage.com/CarolNarigonCurriculum , and what it is is a description of <br/>
unschooling in terms a school district might relate to).<br/>
<br/>
If any of you know of other such forms or summaries, please post them to this <br/>
list and/or send them directly to Satu (who isn&#39;t on this list) at:<br/>
