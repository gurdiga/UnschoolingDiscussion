Home-School Diplomas Nullified by Proposed Legislation<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By Zan Tyler<br/>
Editor of the Crosswalk.com HomeSchool Channel<br/>
May 03, 2002<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Watch out for legislation like this in your state. As home schoolers we can<br/>
never relax!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Crosswalk.com HomeSchool Channel - The Alarming Saga of House Bill 3364<br/>
(A special thanks to SCAIHS&#39; attorney Ken Wingate and HSLDA attorney Dee<br/>
Black for their collaborative efforts in composing this article.)<br/>
<br/>
The Discovery of House Bill 3364<br/>
<br/>
The home schooling community in South Carolina has a team of people who are<br/>
committed to the process of protecting parental rights in the South Carolina<br/>
General Assembly. We have legal counsel in Washington, legal counsel in<br/>
South Carolina, grassroots activists, and home schooling advocates who<br/>
constantly monitor and analyze pending legislation. In addition, many of us<br/>
work diligently to maintain a positive and visible presence at the state<br/>
capitol.<br/>
<br/>
Several weeks ago Tandy Collier (home schooling mother and support group<br/>
leader from the Upstate) asked me to take a look at a bill, which had<br/>
already passed the entire State House of Representatives and was currently<br/>
residing in the Senate Education Committee.<br/>
<br/>
As I read through the text of H. 3364, I was amazed, flabbergasted, and<br/>
appalled at what I was reading. I took a deep breath and read the bill<br/>
again, thinking that somehow it would become more palatable with a second<br/>
reading. It was worse. I called Dee Black with Home School Legal Defense<br/>
Association (HSLDA). He was deeply concerned. I called Ken Wingate, the<br/>
South Carolina attorney for SCAIHS, and he echoed the concerns of HSLDA.<br/>
Others that I contacted voiced similar concern-including Lee Safley,<br/>
president of the South Carolina Home Educators Association (SCHEA).<br/>
<br/>
The Text of House Bill 3364<br/>
<br/>
The bill is short, and you should read it in its entirety.<br/>
<br/>

TO AMEND THE CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, 1976, BY ADDING SECTION<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s no big deal, is it really?  Especially for unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
If people want accreditation, they have always had to go to an accredited <br/>
school.  Schools have many of their strictures in place to maintain (or gain) <br/>
accreditation.<br/>
<br/>
Many private Christian schools are not accredited, and that&#39;s been the case <br/>
over the years, and they KNEW it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-IF ANY STATE LICENSING, APPOINTMENT,<br/>
ELECTION, ADMISSION, EMPLOYMENT, OR OTHER PROCESS REQUIRES THE APPLICANT TO<br/>
POSSESS A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR ITS EQUIVALENT-=-<br/>
<br/>
So what does that actually amount to in South Carolina?   State licensing <br/>
like what?  To serve alcohol?  To groom dogs?  Be a barber?  Seriously--what <br/>
kind of state licenses?<br/>
<br/>
Appointment and Election?  To hold office or to be a notary public?<br/>
<br/>
Admission and employment, we already have that problem just about everywhere. <br/>
 Either a college will let you in or they won&#39;t.  And if that bill goes <br/>
through, it might be easier to talk places into changing their policy (IF <br/>
necessary--it might not be necessary in many cases already) to &quot;highest level <br/>
of education&quot; (instead of &quot;high school diploma, it could say high school <br/>
diploma or higher, and &quot;some college&quot; usually qualifies as &quot;higher&quot;) and do <br/>
the &quot;some college&quot; route, OR what&#39;s already being done in most places:    get <br/>
a GED.<br/>
<br/>
IF there are non-accredited schools in the state already, that&#39;s likely who <br/>
they&#39;re after--trying to raise the standards of those schools, or try to give <br/>
public schooled kids an advantage.    <br/>
<br/>
Do they intend the phrase &quot;any state...&quot; to refer to the entire list?  State <br/>
employment as opposed to ANY employment?  It seems so to me, but just a <br/>
clarification on that could help.<br/>
<br/>
Do people really want the law watered down to the point that any parent can <br/>
print off a diploma at any point along the way and have it be just as real as <br/>
that of an accredited school?   <br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think the issue here is so much how WE feel about the diploma, but <br/>
how our kids are going to approach not having one when they reach the age of <br/>
needing one.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Every homeschooler has thought of that already, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But nevertheless there&#39;s still the obstacle of overcoming the age-old <br/>
tradition of having that piece of paper from the STATE.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And homeschoolers, not being the state, never were going to give their kids <br/>
one anyway.<br/>
<br/>
They can sign up with Calvert or American School and get a diploma, or they <br/>
can get a GED.  Legislation in South Carolina changes NONE of this.<br/>
<br/>
Accreditation of schools is where you should be reading, I think.  If we want <br/>
to be accredited, we&#39;ll be back to the requirements some states used to have <br/>
that one parent had to have teacher training, or that a homeschooling parent <br/>
had to have a college degree.    <br/>
<br/>
-=-We had between 650-1000 homeschoolers show up at the State House yesterday<br/>
by 9am, from all over the state.  This bill was shot down in short order.-=-<br/>
<br/>
So legislatures rolled from pressure from potential voters?<br/>
<br/>
There are more professional educators than there are homeschooling parents.  <br/>
Maybe they&#39;ll show up next time, and their union actually has some money!<br/>
<br/>
-=-*REAL*???  Isn&#39;t this what we as homeschoolers are trying to overcome???  <br/>
The fact that people think the only REAL thing in education is what the state <br/>
hands down?!?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you talking about learning or are you talking about a certificate?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do &quot;education,&quot;  btw--it&#39;s too structured and tainted.<br/>
I deal in learning.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is a reality nobody can take away from you.  The things a person <br/>
knows and the way he learns those things have nothing to do with any state or <br/>
national jurisdiction.  The laws cannot keep a person from learning.<br/>
<br/>
A state accredited institution has the authority to give a binding, official <br/>
diploma.  That is a legal reality I chose to have nothing to do with.  My <br/>
children will NOT have a state diploma.  They might take a GED at some point, <br/>
but although I can creat impressive and flowery diploma text and print them a <br/>
jazzy diploma with their names in GOLD metallic foil on a $2 diploma blank, <br/>
it will not be the legal equal of a diploma from an accredited institution.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I think what we&#39;re facing here is the state allowing homeschool but then <br/>
underminig the efforts of parents by refusing to acknowledge the childs <br/>
education as genuine.-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, I think you were unrealistic if you thought that having children at home <br/>
was going to equal a diploma.  If they&#39;re enrolled in a correspondence school <br/>
or using a curriculum, is that course the equivalent of the state&#39;s <br/>
curriculum?  Probably.  If so, no problem.<br/>
<br/>
If they are NOT enrolled or using a curriculum (unschooling or eclectic or <br/>
whatever), then they knew they weren&#39;t on the path to a diploma.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants a high school diploma, they&#39;re giving them out at all the <br/>
public high schools.<br/>
<br/>
If someone chose not to want one, why act surprised later on?<br/>

<br/>
They are not likely to get involved in anything like this. They won&#39;t usually take it personally. We, homeschoolers, take it personally whenever legislation threatens our &quot;way of life&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It&#39;s fairly typical of the type of thing HSLDA sends out. Every thought that goes through a legislature is seemingly a potential disaster for<br/>

<br/>
I would have to disagree with you on this one. HSLDA, tries to &quot;see things coming&quot;. They have done a great deal of good for homeschoolers. The truth is, in many cases, we should be thanking them. They aren&#39;t afraid to get their hands dirty for us. For instance they are right now fighting quite hard for FLORIDA parents... not just homeschoolers. There is currently a bill waiting for Gov. Bush to sign or veto, well known for being the &quot;Government Nanny&quot; bill. It is quite a scary thing that is in the balance. Anyone of you in Florida, should be aware of this one. Let&#39;s just say that if this bill passes, life for families in Florida will never be the same again.<br/>

<br/>
On the other hand, let&#39;s talk about unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same way regardless of local law.  The way people learn <br/>
doesn&#39;t change with political action and the way people learn doesn&#39;t change <br/>
by where you live.  There are some biological and psychological realities <br/>
which transcend law and even religion.<br/>
<br/>
It seems (I could be wrong) that those posting about SC law and HSLDA are not <br/>
regulars on this list.  I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It seems (I could be wrong) that discussion about diplomas and HSLDA is not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282531794">For those who might not know why pushing HSLDA on this list is an idea that <br/>
makes me cranky, here is an excerpt from an article on HSLDA, and a link to <br/>
the full article, which is filled with links to their sources.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The group&#39;s pervasive political focus leads some critics to charge that in <br/>
addition to acting as a home-school advocacy group, the HSLDA is actively <br/>
pursuing the goals of the religious right. Says Mark Hegener, co-founder of <br/>
Home Education Magazine, the HSLDA is &quot;part of a socially conservative <br/>
constituency network using home schooling as a way to further its political <br/>
goals.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
-=-Adds Chip Berlet, analyst at Political Research Associates and longtime <br/>
observer of the Christian right: &quot;HSLDA shares the same goal with many other <br/>
groups that want to make schools -- whether public classrooms or home-based <br/>
ones -- a lot more conservative and fundamentalist Christian.&quot; The efforts of <br/>
HSLDA and similarly motivated organizations, says Berlet, are major players <br/>
behind recent efforts to mandate creationist curriculum and attack <br/>
environmental education, sex education and multicultural classroom material. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146197615">We recently just battled a new bill proposed in CT - which currently is a state with pretty free homeschooling laws. Between that bill and the ones such as this diploma thing - I think it has nothing to do with the state making sure we have correctly educated our children - because it is clear that homeschoolers tend to be better educated than their public school peers. It is merely a matter of control. By requiring a specific diploma from an accredited institution they are trying to gain control. This was the same with the issues in CT. The legislatures were stating that their intent for their bill was to keep homeschoolers from using older siblings to babysit younger ones - or taking in foster children for the same reason. It was ridiculous. It has nothing to do with achieveing proper standards in education - because as is clear homeschoolers far surpass the state standards, it is all about CONTROL. Think how bad it makes them look when parents can pull their kids from the public system and succeed, while the public system is floundering - and they want to regulate us...go figure!<br/>

    I don&#39;t think the issue here is so much how WE feel about the diploma, but how our kids are going to approach not having one when they reach the age of needing one.  <br/>
    IMO meeting a standard at LEAST as high as the state&#39;s is no problem.  Most homeschooled kids have surpassed that by leaps and bounds.  But nevertheless there&#39;s still the obstacle of overcoming the age-old tradition of having that piece of paper from the STATE.  <br/>
    I know a lot of people are aware of the quality of education that a person gets from homeschooling by far exceeds the state&#39;s efforts, BUT this is still going to be an issue that we have to deal with.  I can see the concern of those of us who homeschool and KNOW that our children are better educated that anything the state has turned out, yet are going to be turned away by many because the STATE has not sanctioned it.<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re already regulated.  Always have been.<br/>
Even in Texas, which seems like NO laws and requirements, the legal <br/>
assumption is that the children are receiving an education equivalent to the <br/>
state&#39;s requirements.  OR that the parents have settled for sub-standard <br/>
non-accredited, which religious families have been doing for years and years.<br/>
<br/>
State accreditation is based on such things as which classes are offered, <br/>
which are required, what the educational and certification level of the <br/>
faculty is (parochial schools can have non-certified teachers; public schools <br/>
can&#39;t, except on provisional bases while they get certification (something <br/>
which is sometimes abused, but goes on the school&#39;s stats--they can only have <br/>
so many provisionals, and that&#39;s usually a special exception for some reason, <br/>
like they didnt&#39; have a reading specialist so an English teacher took that <br/>
position while they looked for one, or some such--a non-certified music <br/>
teacher for a year or something like that), how current the textbooks are--I <br/>
don&#39;t know what all these days, or what it might be in South Carolina.<br/>

Obviously this is a touchy topic with you. I am sorry if I have offended you by my opinions. I just really value parents having the right to make decisions regarding their children freely, and without intimidation.<br/>

  1.. S.B. 88, the Senate version of H.B. 1435, creates a new big government program called &quot; Learning Gateway&quot; and will involve &quot;developing strategies for offering hospital visits or home visits by trained staff to new mothers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  2.. Upset by the defeat of H.B. 1435, Senate Majority Leader John McKay has pushed S.B. 88 into a fast track. He has pulled it from committee and sent it directly to the floor by &quot;special order.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  3.. The purpose of S.B. 88 is to &quot;screen&quot; children from birth to age 9 for &quot;biological, environmental, and behavioral risks,&quot; and &quot;learning problems.&quot; Furthermore, Learning Gateway providers will conduct &quot;intake with families,&quot; conduct &quot;needs/strength-based assessments of families,&quot; and &quot;make referrals for needed services&quot; and &quot;developmental monitoring.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  4.. This will all be done in &quot;collaboration&quot; with the Florida Department of Children and Family Services and numerous other big government agencies and programs.<br/>
<br/>
( Ok, if you don&#39;t live in Florida you may not be aware of what Florida Department of Children and Family Services is capable of)<br/>
<br/>
Recently like a little over a year ago, they &quot;misplaced&quot; a 5 year old girl in South Florida... only they just realized they don&#39;t know where she is... They regularly place children in homes where the &quot;Foster&quot; family, who is supposed to be screened, but often is not, severely hurts or kills the child... there&#39;s more but I think you get the idea. But this is the dept that will head this up.<br/>
  1.. S.B. 86 and 88 mandates automatic referrals of high-risk newborns to the local Learning Gateway through the Office of Vital Statistics. Who determines what is considered &quot;high risk&quot;? There is no parental consent required for this referral. What happens if the parent chooses not to follow up on this referral?<br/>
<br/>
  2.. S.B. 86 and 88 direct that screening processes be developed and tested to address social/emotional/behavioral indicators which could be signs of future problems. Will the Florida Department of Children and Families take the child away if the parent chooses to follow his own doctor&#39;s advice instead of the government&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
  3.. S.B. 86 and 88 require that an electronic data system be developed to track children who are screened, assessed, and referred for services. Will parents be able to remove the child from the government programs once the initial screening is done without their consent?<br/>
<br/>
  4.. S.B 86 and 88 create a huge, expensive bureaucracy, with the intent of expanding the program statewide. The pilot project is $6 million the first year for only three counties---what will it cost taxpayers to fund this program for the whole state?<br/>
<br/>
This bill is currently known as S.B. 1844 and is sitting on the Gov&#39;s desk waiting for his decision. I am sorry if legal issues are not interesting to you. They are to me. I want to help insure that we, parents and homeschoolers like are free to raise our children the way we see fit. I want the freedom to refuse unnessasary medical treatment for my children. You really need to see the whole picture with the state and children. Not just Florida but the US. They already think they own our children, and that they are allowing us to take care of them for a while... this is looking like just another step towards their desire to control our children.<br/>

   I laughed because it seemed to be a funny thing to get<br/>
  upset about. (the diploma itself). It strikes me as one of those sky is<br/>
  falling things. But if anyone feels that I am misunderstanding, please let<br/>
  me know how *you* feel.<br/>
  ~Elissa Cleaveland<br/>
  I don&#39;t think the issue here is so much how WE feel about the diploma, but how our kids are going to approach not having one when they reach the age of needing one.  <br/>
  IMO meeting a standard at LEAST as high as the state&#39;s is no problem.  Most homeschooled kids have surpassed that by leaps and bounds.  But nevertheless there&#39;s still the obstacle of overcoming the age-old tradition of having that piece of paper from the STATE.  <br/>
  I know a lot of people are aware of the quality of education that a person gets from homeschooling by far exceeds the state&#39;s efforts, BUT this is still going to be an issue that we have to deal with.  I can see the concern of those of us who homeschool and KNOW that our children are better educated that anything the state has turned out, yet are going to be turned away by many because the STATE has not sanctioned it.<br/>

the fact that this bill did in fact pass the House and we didn&#39;t even know<br/>

  *REAL*???  Isn&#39;t this what we as homeschoolers are trying to overcome???  The fact that people think the only REAL thing in education is what the state hands down?!?   I think what we&#39;re facing here is the state allowing homeschool but then underminig the efforts of parents by refusing to acknowledge the childs education as genuine.<br/>

services.<br/>
They don&#39;t come out to your home, they don&#39;t go around looking for <br/>
homeschooelers.<br/>
They do have social workers to evaluate people for food stamps and other <br/>
government assistance programs.<br/>
They have a load of high risk families coming to them, so these tactics for <br/>
screening are really nothing new.<br/>
They already have in place methods of screening these high risk applicants. <br/>
They offer (don&#39;t force, OFFER) these types of programs to families.<br/>
It&#39;s just a tweak of what is already happening. It has NOTHING to do with <br/>
homeschoolers, sorry.<br/>
Yes, there are gross misjudgements and overstepping of boundaries by some of <br/>
these governmental groups. <br/>
Still, we are talking about people that are using Children and family <br/>
services, not all homeschoolers. It&#39;s not going to affect you as an <br/>
unschooler.<br/>
And it isn&#39;t going to change a single FL law about homeschooling.<br/>

talk about state legislation. (Try <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NHEN-Legislative@yahoogroups.com">NHEN-Legislative@yahoogroups.com</a>) There <br/>
are 50 states in this country and there is new legislation going on all over <br/>
the place. If we start talking about legislation here, this list will <br/>
completely lose its focus. <br/>

Accepting views I don&#39;t agree with as well as I accept those I DO agree with <br/>
would make me an idiot, wouldn&#39;t it?  HSLDA has its own website and <br/>
propaganda machine.  I tried to point out something by a totally neutral <br/>
outfit--I didn&#39;t post Cheryl&#39;s site, or HEM&#39;s article--I went for the middle. <br/>
 HSLDA supporters think they ARE in the middle.  They&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;HSLDA HAS done much to further homeschooling in the US legally.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure, just ask them.  Their own claims make it seem that homeschooling was <br/>
illegal before they came along and that is a full-on lie.<br/>
<br/>
 They don&#39;t intend to help unschoolers, and this IS an unschooling list.<br/>

not regulars on this list.  I could be wrong.&quot;<br/>

That was my suspicion.  Please join and read a  while to see what&#39;s being <br/>
discussed before telling us the sky is falling but HSLDA could save us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-312857617">&lt;&lt; Let&#39;s be open-minded and accepting of all views, not just the ones you agree with. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have always been one who believes that everyone has the right to express their own opinions. We don&#39;t all have to agree with what another person says. But I think that we should all be tolerant of each other. We are all individual. We all have our own reasons for what we believe. If you disagree with what is said, that is great. But don&#39;t get angry when you haven&#39;t changed the mind of the person you disagree with. Instead lets try to understand, we all come from different places in life. Maybe you know something we don&#39;t. Great! Share that. I know that I have learned a great deal today through this discussion. As much as it has been said that this discussion doesn&#39;t belong here... I think it does. We are here to learn, to gain knowledge from those who have traveled this road before us. I can honestly say, that I have gained more today than you can imagine. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Accepting views I don&#39;t agree with as well as I accept those I DO agree with would make me an idiot, wouldn&#39;t it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps... but accepting peoples right to different views won&#39;t make you an idiot. It will make you tolerant. It reminds me of prejudices. &quot;If you aren&#39;t what I am, or believe what I believe, then you are wrong!&quot; That is a dangerous attitude, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<br/>
I intend to follow the links that were provided. I also intend to do some more research on my own about HSLDA. If I gave the impression that I was promoting them, I am truly sorry. I was simply replying to what another post was about. The only reason I gave the more detailed information about the issue in FL is because I was &quot;requested&quot; to do so. I didn&#39;t originally go into it, because I didn&#39;t think this was the place to discuss FL law. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442809948">&lt;&lt; Still, we are talking about people that are using Children and family services, not all homeschoolers. It&#39;s not going to affect you as an unschooler. And it isn&#39;t going to change a single FL law about homeschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, this is not talking about people who are &quot;using&quot; Children and Family services... we are talking about every woman who delivers a baby. This first contact / interview will take place in the hospital. The child/ren will be followed until age 9. Recommendations for health, educational, and other services will be &quot;recommended&quot;. If you don&#39;t comply or want this, you have no choice. There is nothing in this that allows for a family to opt out. That last part is what bothers me. Just for the record to be set straight, I didn&#39;t first hear about this from HSLDA, I just know that they are trying to stop it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Please, please, please...do what many of us here have done and read more about the truth of these issues and how they will ( or won&#39;t in this case) affect you. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This case will affect me as a FL resident. It will affect anyone living in FL.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve read about them for years, since I started homeschooling.  At first they <br/>
sent me all their applications and scare-mail.  I asked around about whether <br/>
we should join.  I read their literature and the opposing stuff.  I decided <br/>
against it.   <br/>
<br/>
Later I met Cheryl Seelhoff online and heard some horrible things, and <br/>
started watching again more closely, for another round.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I was simply replying to what another post was about. The only reason I <br/>
gave the more detailed information about the issue in FL is because I was <br/>
&quot;requested&quot; to do so. I didn&#39;t originally go into it, because I didn&#39;t think <br/>
this was the place to discuss FL law. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I overreacted then.  What I saw was two people whose names I didn&#39;t <br/>
recognize leaving scare stories here, and the Florida summary without detail <br/>
matched almost exactly some of the HSLDA tactics.  We were told when Clinton <br/>
was first going to run for president that if we voted for him we would <br/>
probably lose our right to homeschool, and our daughters would never be safe.<br/>
<br/>
Those kinds of political &quot;advisements&quot;  [VOTE FOR THIS OR YOUR LIFE WILL <br/>
CHANGE HORRIBLY!!!!] are irritating, and even more irritating is the fact <br/>
that there is apparently a small army of people who respond to it.  When <br/>
HSLDA sends out a state advisory to call your representatives and congressmen <br/>
TODAY and say THIS:  and gives the script, or a form letter, or an e-mail <br/>
form letter, I suppose some people gasp and run to do it.    The effect of <br/>
that must be to make legislators think homeschoolers are easily-panicked <br/>
sheep.<br/>
<br/>
Being neither a blind follower nor easily panicked, I&#39;m ashamed of the <br/>
association.<br/>
