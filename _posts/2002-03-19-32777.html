<div id="ygrps-yiv-738524877">I have been wanting to post, but just haven&#39;t found the time lately. I <br/>
haven&#39;t even been able to keep up with reading all of the posts and have <br/>
deleted a lot, but I did get to read the various posts about unparenting.<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling our sons since September (7 yo) and February (9yo). <br/>
It was their choice to leave school. It took the 9 yo a little longer to <br/>
decide. We are basically spending this time deschooling. Although I <br/>
occassionally worry about progress, I believe unschooling will work.<br/>
<br/>
Our difficulties come with other issues. The boys don&#39;t have a bedtime. They <br/>
like to watch &quot;Gargoyles&quot; which comes on from 11:00-12:00am. The problem is, <br/>
they can be very noisy and wake us up, and probably the neighbors as well. <br/>
(We live in a townhouse.) I feel that they are not respecting our needs and <br/>
I have told them so.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is that they never want to go out. Occassionally I need to <br/>
run errands or would like to participate in a local group (Families for <br/>
Natural Living). I don&#39;t get to because they refuse to go out unless it is <br/>
something they want to do. I don&#39;t want to bribe or threaten, so we end up <br/>
staying home and I miss out on needed adult contact.<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly is the issue of the clutter. Last night my s.o. fell down the steps <br/>
and seriously injured his knee because of the toys left on the steps. Do <br/>
they care? Hell, no. This morning I tripped over toys trying to get to the <br/>
laundry closet. I&#39;m pregnant and my center of balance is changing, so it is <br/>
more difficult to manuever the obstacle course. My s.o. and I are neat. The <br/>
main level (kitchen, dining, living and office area) is typically clutter <br/>
free as is our bedroom. Dishes and laundry are done. (I don&#39;t buy into <br/>
flylady that if we are clutter free and follow our routines, our children <br/>
will too!) I have conceded to the clutter in their rooms. Their bedrooms are <br/>
a half level up from our bedroom and the uppermost level in the townhouse, <br/>
so I don&#39;t have to see it. I won&#39;t put their laundry away. I put it in a <br/>
basket and they take it to their room. The problem is with the basement <br/>
level. It contains a family room and laundry closet. This is their area. <br/>
There is a wall of shelves for their toys. There is a tv, game cube, videos, <br/>
and computer. The room is always trashed. My sewing maching is also down <br/>
there, but I rarely sew, because of the condition of the room. It is a <br/>
constant battle to try and get them to clean up. I don&#39;t expect it to be <br/>
perfect, but I want to be able to get to the laundry closet and to the <br/>
sewing maching. I hadn&#39;t thought about an allowance system based on chores, <br/>
but that just doesn&#39;t seem right.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has found a solution to any of these issues, I would love to hear <br/>
them. Sorry this is so long.<br/>
<br/>
In rereading before sending, I realize that a lot of this has to do with <br/>
respect, or lack of. I don&#39;t understand. I hadn&#39;t heard the term Taking <br/>
Children Seriously until recently, but that has always been my philosophy. <br/>
This is not a dictator, we always consider our children&#39;s desires, and often <br/>
change accordingly. But they have little respect for us. What am I doing <br/>
wrong?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333418319">This is so definitely about parenting!!!<br/>
There is no way to put a positive spin on &quot;unparenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Our difficulties come with other issues. The boys don&#39;t have a bedtime. <br/>
They <br/>
like to watch &quot;Gargoyles&quot; which comes on from 11:00-12:00am. The problem is, <br/>
they can be very noisy and wake us up, and probably the neighbors as well. <br/>
(We live in a townhouse.) I feel that they are not respecting our needs and <br/>
I have told them so.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see no problem with telling them the only way they can stay up later than <br/>
you do is if they are REALLY quiet.  Especially with adjoining walls to other <br/>
families.  It&#39;s probably more than a need, there might be a legal requirement <br/>
to keep quiet after a certain time.    Tell them they CAN&#39;T be really noisy, <br/>
even if they were adults.  <br/>
<br/>
If the neighbors complain, you could be dealing with social services.  Tell <br/>
them that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
Another problem is that they never want to go out. Occassionally I need to <br/>
run errands or would like to participate in a local group (Families for <br/>
Natural Living). I don&#39;t get to because they refuse to go out unless it is <br/>
something they want to do. I don&#39;t want to bribe or threaten, so we end up <br/>
staying home and I miss out on needed adult contact.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The TLC people would disagree with me, but when a family&#39;s working as a team, <br/>
sometimes one member of the team needs to be somewhere at a certain time and <br/>
the rest need to go too.  But the nicer you are to them about doing things <br/>
you don&#39;t want to do, and the clearer you make to them that you really want <br/>
to do something, the more cooperative they should (theoretically) be.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know how much prior resentment there is to overcome.  What&#39;s wrong with <br/>
making the trip attractive to everyone?  If my husbandted to stop for food or <br/>
ice cream, should he say &quot;NO, that would be a bribe&quot;?   Is it a reward for <br/>
doing something unpleasant?  If so, so what?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve bribed kids from time to time and I don&#39;t feel a bit guilty.  I have <br/>
vivid memories of my mom telling me what and how to do and NOW because I SAID <br/>
so.  That&#39;s wrong.  But no one member of the family should hold the rest <br/>
hostage.  And the one with the power and money has the ability to distribute <br/>
power and money for the good of the group.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Thirdly is the issue of the clutter. Last night my s.o. fell down the <br/>
steps <br/>
and seriously injured his knee because of the toys left on the steps. Do <br/>
they care? Hell, no.-=-<br/>
<br/>
YOU should care.  Did they leave toys on the stairs after you went to sleep?  <br/>
They will care about what they care about, and if they&#39;re too young to <br/>
understand that toys can&#39;t safely be left on the steps, then they&#39;re too <br/>
young to play on the steps.  If it were me, I would them that if they can&#39;t <br/>
take the toys away with them, you need a no-toys-on-steps EVER rule.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t had a problem with stuff on stairs except for me leaving <br/>
to-be-filed books leaned up against the wall on steps on the way to the <br/>
library (and I know of no incidents of them falling over or of people <br/>
stepping on them) or me putting other people&#39;s &quot;take it downstairs&quot; stuff on <br/>
the top of the banister.  Marty left skates too near the bottom step last <br/>
week.  I put them on his bed.<br/>
<br/>
If there are safety issues and legal issues, talk to the kids about that.  If <br/>
they&#39;re not mature enough to begin to concern themselves with safety or <br/>
legality, limit their ability to be a threat.<br/>
<br/>

Hi Stacy,<br/>
You say the family room in the basement is their area. That is where all their stuff is and the room is always trashed. You also said that you allow them to keep their rooms as they like, but you don&#39;t mind it as much because you don&#39;t have to see it. So, it seems to me like they feel the family room is just another extension of their room (with toys and games in it) and since they can keep their rooms messy, the feel comfortable enough to keep their &quot;area&quot; messy, too. I understand that you must also use the family room for laundry and sewing, so the mess really bothers you.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could explain how much this bothers you (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already done that :-) and that you&#39;d like them to help you come up with a solution. Maybe they have some ideas of their own in this situation? If it were me, I would suggest a day, maybe once a week, where you and your kids go down to the room and clean it up together. I always find that when I&#39;m doing it with them, everybody is much happier and willing to help. If they are participating in some of the cleaning, they may be more willing to keep it cleaner in the future. But, at least it would be cleaned once a week so it might stay relatively clean.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with this!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138618129">Stacy,  I keep recommending a book called How to Talk So Kids Will Listen<br/>
and How to Listen So Kids Will Talk because it has helped me enormously. <br/>
It helped me to be able to communicate with my kids without blame or<br/>
recriminations.  It was at the library.  I have notes from the book and I<br/>
look them over frequently to remind myself.  If the kids are keeping you<br/>
awake late at night and you are pregnant, that&#39;s gotta be bad for you. <br/>
Maybe you could ask the kids to help you find a solution, like to video<br/>
tape the show and watch it the next day?  I own these silly-putty-like<br/>
earplugs that help me get to sleep at night when my husband and kids stay<br/>
up late.  About not wanting to go out, perhaps ask them to help you find<br/>
a solution, like they get to go somewhere they want after you go to your<br/>
stuff.  About the laundry/sewing/stairs area, something we have done when<br/>
there is an ongoing problem of the kids not respecting my boundaries is<br/>
that I discuss possible solutions with each child individually, then we<br/>
decide all together which solutions to keep and what not to keep, then we<br/>
write it down in a family agreement book and everyone signs it.  It is<br/>
amazing.  The first time ever that my children have stopped eating on my<br/>
bed while watching tv.  They follow it more strictly than I do.  They are<br/>
proud of their agreements.<br/>
Remember, you are not in a war.  Your children and you are not<br/>
adversaries.  You are not a victim, and it is not necessary to get<br/>
control of your children.  You will find wonderful methods in that book<br/>
for just the kinds of things you described.<br/>
I just have to say, and I hope I&#39;m not sounding too offensive in this,<br/>
but, you might want to start putting their clothes away, picking up the<br/>
stairs, and clearing the area in the sewing/laundry part that gets in<br/>
your way.  Change is progressive, and they may not be ready to change all<br/>
the areas you&#39;ve mentioned at once.  So until that time comes, you may<br/>
want to do what is necessary to help you live safely.  After all, seven<br/>
and nine is really not that old.  They may be overwhelmed by the mess. <br/>
If it overwhelms you, I&#39;m sure it overwhelms them.  Try sitting in the<br/>
middle of the messy room and saying, &quot;Hand me this, hand me that, now,<br/>
where should this go?&quot;  That&#39;s what I do with mine when they are feeling<br/>
overwhelmed with a mess.  Even my fourteen year old gets overwhelmed when<br/>
his room is messy now and then.  Also, fresh air and exercise is great<br/>
for making kids tired at night.  You might want to go for a walk every<br/>
afternoon or something like that to use up some of their energy.<br/>
All right, I&#39;m done finally.  I know you are not me and you need to<br/>
figure out and weigh out your own ideas.  Maybe these suggestions will<br/>
spark your imagination to come up with some of your own creative<br/>
solutions.<br/>

&gt;I did get to read the various posts about unparenting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Stacy, You seemed to have posted at a very dynamic time on this list! <br/>
And since I&#39;m one of the parents that have no negative issues with the <br/>
term unparenting.. I&#39;m going to also respond to your concerns from my <br/>
viewpoint. I&#39;ve also seen some great info come your way from other ppl <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I believe unschooling will work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you *know* it will work at the core of your being? If you do, the <br/>
&#39;unparenting&#39; part is a bit easier to deal with. It becomes a sense of <br/>
security.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Our difficulties come with other issues. The boys don&#39;t have a bedtime. They <br/>
&gt;like to watch &quot;Gargoyles&quot; which comes on from 11:00-12:00am. The problem is, <br/>
&gt;they can be very noisy and wake us up, and probably the neighbors as well. <br/>
&gt;(We live in a townhouse.) I feel that they are not respecting our needs and <br/>
&gt;I have told them so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You (as in plural, family) are a community. In any community there are <br/>
guidelines. These guidelines/rules are there SOLELY for the purpose that <br/>
others in that community can also enjoy their freedoms.<br/>
<br/>
If not, it then has to become a dictatorship, in order to keep boundaries <br/>
from getting overstepped.<br/>
<br/>
This is a boundary issue. And you may need to look into your past to see <br/>
why your community is able to overstep so easily into your boundarys. <br/>
Please take this as it comes.. or not. It is not meant to assume or <br/>
analyze the issues. I can only write from my POV.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Another problem is that they never want to go out. Occassionally I need to <br/>
&gt;run errands or would like to participate in a local group (Families for <br/>
&gt;Natural Living). I don&#39;t get to because they refuse to go out unless it is <br/>
&gt;something they want to do. I don&#39;t want to bribe or threaten, so we end up <br/>
&gt;staying home and I miss out on needed adult contact.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Somewhere between bribing and threatening, there just &#39;is&#39;. Again, a <br/>
boundary issue.<br/>
If they are too young to legally stay alone and you give them their <br/>
opportunities to pursue their activities, they need to show you that same <br/>
respect.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I say I&#39;m an unparent in this regard. We are a democratic <br/>
community and everyone does what they do best to keep it from turning <br/>
into a dictatorship. Some of us have more experience, but we all process <br/>
information the same way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; his knee because of the toys left on the steps. Do <br/>
&gt;they care? Hell, no. This morning I tripped over toys trying to get to the <br/>

&gt;more difficult to manuever the obstacle course. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>
<br/>
Unacceptable in a community. There is no reason that one person&#39;s <br/>
pleasure should put the safety of the others at risk.<br/>
<br/>
Thats how you present it, thats how you have to believe it in your self.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Their bedrooms are <br/>
&gt;a half level up from our bedroom and the uppermost level in the townhouse, <br/>
&gt;so I don&#39;t have to see it. I won&#39;t put their laundry away. I put it in a <br/>
&gt;basket and they take it to their room. The problem is with the basement <br/>
&gt;level. It contains a family room and laundry closet. This is their area.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>
<br/>
Can you take a step back and think hard about rearranging the way things <br/>
are laid out so you don&#39;t see their mess? Maybe even using dividers in <br/>
the basement if necessary?<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s room stayed unwalkable for almost a year. Finally he asked for <br/>
help cleaning it up and then was so happy that he had access to toys he <br/>
totally forgot about. After that, he asked that if he set a rule, if I <br/>
would help him follow it by reminding him. He said he is young and <br/>
sometimes gets excited and forgets. His rule is to clean up one thing <br/>
before going onto the next. This epiphany didn&#39;t happen overnight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This is not a dictator, we always consider our children&#39;s desires, and often <br/>
&gt;change accordingly. But they have little respect for us. What am I doing <br/>
&gt;wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stacy, tis a fine line one walks when balancing everyone&#39;s interests and <br/>
freedoms. Lest us not forget that there are rules to democracy, and these <br/>
rules guarantee the freedom of the entire community, not just a selected <br/>
few.<br/>
<br/>
Be prepared to set family guidelines/rules or Laws. Whatever term you <br/>
feel happy with. And also be prepared to follow them yourself, and for <br/>
your husband.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book that is coming to mind.. I can&#39;t remember the authors.. a <br/>
couple.. &quot;Living Joyfully with Children&quot;. They had some good ideas about <br/>
community.. you may want to pick it up.<br/>

I just asked my son. He says &quot;Gargoyles&quot; is on Toon Disney. We live in <br/>
Northern VA and have Directv satellite service.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Our difficulties come with other issues. The boys<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have a <br/>
&gt; bedtime. They <br/>
&gt; &gt; like to watch &quot;Gargoyles&quot; which comes on from<br/>
&gt; 11:00-12:00am. The <br/>
&gt; problem is, <br/>
&gt; &gt; they can be very noisy and wake us up, and<br/>
&gt; probably the neighbors as <br/>
&gt; well. <br/>
&gt; &gt; (We live in a townhouse.) I feel that they are not<br/>
&gt; respecting our <br/>
&gt; needs and <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have told them so.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; How old are your boys?  My oldest 7  stays up late .<br/>
 </span></blockquote> He is a night owl , of course so am I.  Did you stay<br/>
up when you where their age?  I know my son gets it<br/>
from me.  When I was his age I can remember many<br/>
sleepless nights.  My son is more active at night<br/>
also.  Personally my self I was more alert in the<br/>
afternoon, night then early morning.  Of course now I<br/>
am adult and I can function all hours of the day.  <br/>
It might not be a respect issue, it might be that they<br/>
just can&#39;t sleep<br/>
