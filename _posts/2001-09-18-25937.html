<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253447842"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   IMO politeness will promote more offering of opinions because people won&#39;t be worried about<br/>
&gt; being attacked if they post something.  This list has something like 500 members. Look at how<br/>
&gt; many of those members regularly post. Do the numbers look a little bit skewed to you? Wonder<br/>
&gt; why *the rest* of those members don&#39;t post....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As one of the silent members, let me assure you that the reason I don&#39;t post here has nothing to do with a fear of being attacked.  It&#39;s simply about time for me these days.  I used to be vocal on several big lists, some of them fairly contentious.  These days I&#39;ve dropped off all homeschooling lists but this one, and most of my<br/>
writing lists because these days I don&#39;t have the time to participate fully.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t unsubbed from *this* list because so many of the people who DO find time to continue writing here have so much to say that is worth my time to read.  I&#39;m more interested in hearing from people who have enough conviction or passion to speak than from the ones who are cowed or intimidated into silence for fear of<br/>
stepping on toes or having their statements questioned.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with using my delete key either, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for speaking up here, guys.  It&#39;s invaluable.<br/>

P.S.  If we somehow end up with all 500 speaking I&#39;ll have to unsub here too.  &lt;g&gt;  Every large list I&#39;ve ever been on had more people who&#39;d come to take than give.  I know when I&#39;ve gone to topica or yahoo looking to join it was because I had something to learn, and I&#39;ve been grateful every time I found a list offering what I<br/>
was looking for.</div>
