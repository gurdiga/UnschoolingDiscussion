I think the concern was that when you daughter asked you the next day ( <br/>
tomorrow) if it was tomorrow yet, you told her, &quot;no, its today&quot;.    That is <br/>
not fair to her.   In essence, you were saying &quot;tomorrow never comes&quot;.    I <br/>
don&#39;t even know how old your daughter was when she asked about smoking, I <br/>
didnt read the entire thread from the beginning.   And, in all liklihood, she <br/>
did just forget about smoking.<br/>
<br/>
  What about when she got old enough to recall those events and she thought  <br/>
&quot;HEY, you tricked me!&quot;  Maybe you&#39;de get  lucky and  she wouldn&#39;t care.. <br/>
maybe she would even think it was funny.. But, maybe she would think.. Gee, <br/>
how much other stuff did she try to put over on me??... It seems you took <br/>
advantage of her innocence and niatevte by not just admiting, the next day <br/>
when she asked about smoking again, that yes, it is &quot;tomorrow&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Glena, I know how things get picked over and scrutinized.  I know how it <br/>
feels to hear  things that make you feel like folks are saying you are a bad <br/>
mother.    The way you dealt with the smoking question was ( IMO) not the <br/>
absolute best way to handle it..But, that incident does NOT make you a bad <br/>
mother. It means that you handled a situation in a way that seemed right to <br/>
you, and it seemed to work.  But, others have said that to them, it didnt <br/>
seem like the BEST way to handle it.  Maybe it would help just to stop and <br/>
think about WHY folks feel you could have handled it differently.  Instead of <br/>
being insulted, use the questioning and &quot;critisicm&quot; as a means to examine <br/>
better ways of dealing with similar situations.  <br/>

Great insight, Teresa. Thanks. I hope we can now let this float on <br/>
by. I think it&#39;s been discussed to death.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
