<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631182512">Well, I&#39;ve taken Sandra&#39;s advice and for the past few days, I&#39;ve <br/>
been &quot;riding the bike&quot; or in other words, unschooling instead of <br/>
thinking about unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I unsubscribed for a day thinking I needed to spend my time thinking <br/>
of things to do with my kids instead of thinking of how to respond to <br/>
others&#39;posts.  I had withdrawal symptoms and my dh suggested I go no <br/>
email so I don&#39;t have to worry if I get behind on messages.  <br/>
<br/>
It has been a great few days of unschooling.  Friday, I showed the <br/>
kids a book I had gotten out of the library called Janice VanCleave&#39;s <br/>
Geography for Every Kid.  There are some mapping projects in there <br/>
and we decided to each make a map and hide something in the yard.  <br/>
That was a lot of fun and led us to want to do some orienteering <br/>
which we plan to do in the next few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, we went ice skating.<br/>
<br/>
This morning we were sitting around the breakfast table talking about <br/>
stuff and one thing led to another.  Allison decided she wanted to <br/>
make a trivia game for us to play.  She set up a poster board with <br/>
category pockets to hold questions, along with a spinner.  I gave <br/>
her a copy of the library dewey decimal system and she chose her <br/>
categories from that.  We pulled out all our reference books and <br/>
played a few rounds.  (I swear I never told her about Sandra&#39;s family <br/>
using reference books to play trivia)<br/>
<br/>
After the girl&#39;s basketball game they wanted to go to the library to <br/>
get more books for the game.  Allison got so many books it was hard <br/>
to carry all of them.  Now I have stacks of books all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
We played a few more rounds of the game, it was fun. <br/>
<br/>
I told the Allison I was not going to spend so much time reading my <br/>
emails.  She said &quot;but mom, you learn so much from them.&quot;  I said &quot;I <br/>
know, but I&#39;m spending too much time doing that&quot;.  She said &quot;what <br/>
will you do instead?&quot;  I told her I would do more things with her.  <br/>
She liked that!<br/>

P.S. The only problem with posting without email is I won&#39;t have my <br/>
spell checker.  Oh no!</div>

<br/>
One of our best quiz books is the Top Ten of Everything book.  Almost <br/>
everyone will get at least one right, and nobody really cares if anybody gets <br/>
ANYTHING right!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds fun, making a trivia game.  I have a piece of advice--people shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be too strict about the answers.  There are errors in some of the games out <br/>
there, and sometimes answers change, or questions are worded in an ambiguous <br/>
fashion.  So instead of fighting about &quot;wrong&quot; answers, maybe find a way to <br/>
consider more than one answer right.  More winners means more winning!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too!<br/>
I was at the store yesterday and bought a two pack of cards, plus 5 <br/>
dice, set.   We&#39;ve played dice and cards games lots here, and needed <br/>
a fresh deck, but I also included some poker chips in the purchase.<br/>
I&#39;ve been &quot;dealer&quot; all morning with my boys, playing &quot;Inbetween&quot;.<br/>
We&#39;ll move onto blackjack next.(Jack will like that one!) Jack (5) is <br/>
now playing &quot;rich guy&quot;.  The chips are his money, the cards are his <br/>
dollars and the dice are his jewels.  He just came over with a <br/>
handful of leftover birthday candles and whispered to me, &quot;you know <br/>
what these are gonna be?....the knives!&quot;  I just aksed him why a rich <br/>
guy needs knives, and he said, &quot;so he can cut his food&quot;  (duh)<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve been much more *present* here these days.  Reading <br/>
Redwall and Harry Potter in the middle of the day, we rented &quot;An <br/>
American in Paris&quot; and though the dancing is really good, I didn&#39;t <br/>
like it all that much.  The mentality toward women really struck me, <br/>
and I had to comment on a few things here and there, but otherwise it <br/>
was fairly entertaining.  I think Hello Dolly will always be Carly&#39;s <br/>
favorite.  She really relates to Dolly(scary, huh).<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say thanks for the inspiration!<br/>
