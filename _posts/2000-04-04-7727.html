<div id="ygrps-yiv-202420915">Kim--I completely agree on the trust issue.  I find myself struggling at <br/>
times.  It&#39;s like sometimes I feel it&#39;s a parenting decision, then other <br/>
times I think that maybe I should be more trusting of my child.  For example, <br/>
my 5yo made instant oatmeal this morning.  He got out the bowl, spoon, and <br/>
pkg of cereal.  Poured milk in it, stirred , and cooked it in the microwave.  <br/>
I was still in bed!  He has never done this before, and has never asked if he <br/>
could use the microwave by himself.  He just did it.  He came down to tell me <br/>
about it, and was SO EXCITED about having done this.  While I was feeling <br/>
proud of him for the accomplishment, I also felt a little taken aback by his <br/>
&quot;not asking&quot; first.  So, I shared in his happiness, and we hugged, but then I <br/>
told him that from now on he needs to tell me first when he wants to use the <br/>
microwave, as there are some things that do not go in it, etc.  I don&#39;t want <br/>
to &quot;bust his bubble&quot;, but the parent in me needed to tell him about using it <br/>
safely.  So, I felt like I handled it right, but there are times that I will <br/>
look back and think that I could have and should have handled something <br/>
differently.  So, yes, as I drone on and on, trusting is a difficult hurdle <br/>
to jump- at least for me! :)                                                <br/>

&gt; put &quot;unschooling&quot; into <br/>

&gt; sense of confirmation that <br/>
&gt; what we are doing is right, as every once in a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know when I first started this home/unschooling<br/>
journey I was still &quot;programmed&quot; to do this the<br/>
&quot;school way&quot;. But I soon realized that when my DD asks<br/>
&quot;how do you spell&quot;.... All I had to do was tell her! I<br/>
no longer had to say &quot;go look it up&quot;. Besides I always<br/>
hated it when my step-mother said that to me! It was<br/>
so freeing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488985212">Hi Kim,<br/>
I read your response, and I too have a difficult time to &quot;know&quot; when to draw <br/>
the line. Sometimes I&#39;m way too strict and other times I just let something <br/>
slide on by-------------just like that. And then I wonder for 3 days if I <br/>
made the right choice. Even about the silliest things. Oh well as they say <br/>
&quot;Live and Learn.&quot;.<br/>

Thanks for your heartfelt post! I have those doubting moments when the house <br/>
is a 3-ring circus and I blow up at everybody b/c of the preconceived picture <br/>
 I bring to home life of what an unschooled family life should be: no sibling <br/>
rivalry, following own interests, encouraging one another, and not crying for <br/>
tv!LOL!<br/>
