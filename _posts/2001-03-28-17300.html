<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249147859">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s really interested in Egyptian stuff.  In fact he often signs<br/>
his name in ancient Egyptian.  He&#39;s building a pyramid for the history<br/>
fair.   Where do you get the Pharaoh&#39;s game?<br/>
<br/>
Also one of my favorite authors is Vonda N McIntyre.  I&#39;d recommend her<br/>
book &quot;Dream Snake&quot;.  Some may be more  appropriate for 10 years and<br/>
up.   Dream Snakes deals with a woman healer who heals with snakes.  I<br/>
would read any of them to my near 7 year old son.  We are currently<br/>
reading Harry Potter book 4.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking of Parenting styles and relating them to Unschooling<br/>
families.  I think that some people may think of us as permissive<br/>
parents.  I think most of us are flexible parents because we are not<br/>
worried about sticking to a rigid set of rules.<br/>
<br/>
How many of you out there have two homeschooling groups in your area?<br/>
One Christian and one non-denominational.  Our area has just experienced<br/>
that split.  I&#39;m somewhat one of the leaders of non-denominational.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and Success,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-222648883">Hi Sherry,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where they got Pharoahs, but I just picked up a game called <br/>
Pyramids from Barnes & Noble last weekend.  It says, &quot;master the tools and <br/>
secrets of ancient Egypt&quot;  It does have a violence rating on it because <br/>
human&#39;s are killed, I&#39;m guessing they mean in the building of the pyramids.  <br/>
I found it in the bargain section for $4.98.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>
Bonnie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-179233996">GAME info below.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; How many of you out there have two homeschooling groups in your area?<br/>
One Christian and one non-denominational.  Our area has just experienced<br/>
that split.  I&#39;m somewhat one of the leaders of non-denominational. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even non-denominational suggests Christianity, just not one strictly defined <br/>
type of Christianity.  If you mean to welcome non-Christians, the buzzword is <br/>
&quot;inclusive&quot; (as opposed to exclusive or &quot;statement-of-faith&quot; (if the <br/>
Christian group required people to sign a statement).<br/>
<br/>
Senet is the name of that game you want, I think.<br/>
The sites below have either a game for sale, a laout of the board, or a <br/>
picture or something.  There&#39;s another game called &quot;jackals and hounds&quot; which <br/>
people are shown playing in the movie &quot;The Ten Commandments.&quot;<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I personally think that is sad. I am a Christian, 
but have learned lots from people who do not believe the same as I do. I think 
we need to be wise about the influences of our lives, Christian or not, but that 
doesn&#39;t mean we cannot work together. I have also heard a lot of dumb ideas put 
forth as &quot;Christian Education&quot;. As homeschoolers we all have the common vision 
of the best for our families and need to support each other in the&nbsp;freedom 
of choice we have, not restrict each other. That is one of the reasons we left 
public school.&nbsp;My right to&nbsp;choos is just as valid as

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50027923">Hi Sherry,<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of the pharoah&#39;s game.  We have a game book called &quot;Ancient <br/>
Board Games&quot;.  It has Senet, Mehen, Hounds and Jackals, and The Royal Game <br/>
of Ur.  It comes with all the pieces and the 4 boards in bookform.<br/>
I thought your son and you might find it interesting.  It is published by <br/>
Welcome Rain.  We received it has a gift, so I don&#39;t know where you can buy <br/>
it.<br/>
