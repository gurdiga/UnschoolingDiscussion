I have been thoughtfully reading the discussion about<br/>
canvases and cleaning (I had thought that it was on<br/>
the AlwaysLearning list, but was mistaken! LOL), and<br/>
thought I would take it to heart yesterday.<br/>
 <br/>
I went into my 12yos room and started cleaning and<br/>
organizing his work space, where he paints his LOTR<br/>
figures for his gaming.<br/>
 <br/>
I put all the figures into shoe boxes, or old gundam<br/>
boxes, put the paints all in an empty baby wipes<br/>
box, the brushes in a cup, cleared off the clutter<br/>
without throwing anything away that wasn&#39;t obviously<br/>
trash, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
I laid a big piece of red posterboard down on the<br/>
desk and duct-taped it down, and arranged his paints<br/>
and brushes and put a shoe box lid down to put the<br/>
painted figures to dry.<br/>
 <br/>
He came in and was so excited.  He said, &quot;Oh momma,<br/>
thank you!  Now I just want to PAINT!&quot;  And pulled up<br/>
his chair, turned on one of his G.A. Henty audiobooks,<br/>
and settled in for the afternoon.<br/>
 <br/>
What a great feeling!<br/>
 <br/>
Later on, I went back up there and started really<br/>
cleaning, and he came up and joined me and kept<br/>
thanking me over and over for helping him clean his<br/>
room.  I told him he didn&#39;t have to help, that I would<br/>
do it just because I enjoyed it, but he loved being<br/>
there with me and helping so we did it together.<br/>
<br/>
It was a a good day.<br/>
<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>
