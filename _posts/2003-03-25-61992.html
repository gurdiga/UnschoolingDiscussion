I used to have this bias. It&#39;s incredible how people will say this about tv, <br/>
but if it&#39;s ANY other item, the kids are simply &quot;focused&quot;.<br/>
If your child was really, really into a book and you couldn&#39;t get their <br/>
attention, would you say they are turning into &quot;little zombies&quot; or simply <br/>
very interested in what they&#39;re doing?<br/>
If they were experimenting with flour and water and you couldn&#39;t get their <br/>
attention, would they be &quot;zombies&quot; or learning something incredibly important <br/>
for them at that moment?<br/>
It&#39;s silly to think that something very interesting to a child, that focuses <br/>
their attention would be considered bad.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
