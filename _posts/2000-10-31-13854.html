<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801484650">When we first started to homeschooling, my family was concerned, like your<br/>
is.  I took my children out of school (the oldest two, the other five hadn&#39;t<br/>
started yet)  because of the rebellion I was seeing in my oldest daughter.<br/>
Unfortuantly, it was too late for them, and they made a lot of bad, life<br/>
changing decisions that they are still living with today.  However, the<br/>
younger children are now older, and the difference in them and my neices and<br/>
nephews is so startling, that the other day my father said to me, &quot;I thought<br/>
you were ruining those kids when you started this, but now I wish you<br/>
sisters had homeschooled their kids!&quot;  That was quiet a confession for<br/>
him!!!!!<br/>
Although we unschool, I do require my children to do a certain amount of<br/>
&quot;learning&quot; every day.  At least an hour.  They can do computer, workbooks,<br/>
regular books, whatever interests them in whatever subject they feel like<br/>
doing.  They enjoy the computer programs I bought them so much, they usually<br/>
end up doing much more than an hour, even trying each others grade!!  I try<br/>
to buy new ones on a regular basis to keep their interests up.<br/>
That&#39;s how we do it.  Some are over their grade level, and some are under.<br/>

Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] The Parent&#39;s Essential Active Role in<br/>
Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; I have been reading all the posts on active rolls on unschooling. Let me<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; say that I took my daughter out of school last December, we started off<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; school at home. That was a nightmare!! My daughter goes in two directions<br/>
&gt; either she catches on real fast and then gets bored  to death or she has a<br/>
&gt; hard time and gets really frustrated and starts with the poor me , Im so<br/>
&gt; dumb, or Im stupid. The latter part of it really bothers me. So began the<br/>
&gt; unschooling journey, I have read and reread all the books I can get my<br/>
hands<br/>
&gt; on (lucky for me I love to read.) Any way it was very hard for me to see<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; big picture and still is , we started officially unschooling in April of<br/>
last<br/>
&gt; year and all seemed well in the beginning ..After reading the books again<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; reading the posts on the list , I felt confident to go with it. I have<br/>
spent<br/>
&gt; the last 6 months watching my daughter sit in front of the t.v. or play<br/>
&gt; gameboy(Im with the mother who said she would like to throw gameboy out<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; window)some days she does nothing but eat all day. Let me just say I think<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; this point I have very little tongue left as I have bitten right off<br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; to keep my nagging mouth shut. Everyone says this is the de-schooling<br/>
stage<br/>
&gt; and I should let her be. So I have. I have spent many sleepless nights<br/>
&gt; wondering if what I feel in my heart could truely be what is right in my<br/>
&gt; head. I love the idea of unschooling but the schoolish part of me needs to<br/>
&gt; see results. We are required by law in NH to test once a year. We did that<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; July with the PASS Test from Hewitt Resources. I JUST recieved the results<br/>
&gt; Friday. She did really good. 90th% on the nationals  ( with no help from<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; other than organizing the pages)<br/>
&gt; I am so sorry to go on but this week has been very difficult for me.<br/>
Before<br/>
&gt; we started unschooling my daughter loved to read , draw, make concoctions<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the kitchen. (which I hated) Now when she says shes bored and I suggest<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; read one of the million books I have bought for her, she replies with &quot;Mom<br/>
,<br/>
&gt; I dont want to do school work.&quot;  when the &quot;school&quot; year started this sept.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; thought I would be prepared for ALL the great things that would happen so<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; ordered all kinds of books  like Cartooning for beginners and Easy drawing<br/>
&gt; lessons  and How to draw animals. She has not touched them. I bought  The<br/>
Big<br/>
&gt; Book of How. and other reference materials , nothing specific , just stuff<br/>
&gt; that she could use if she had a motivation. I DID NOT push them on her ,<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; let her know they were there if she wanted them. I have mentioned music<br/>
&gt; lessons and theater(shes a Drama Qween)  She takes Riding lessons  and<br/>
loves<br/>
&gt; that but shows no interest in the two horses that we own. She is an only<br/>
&gt; child and is lonely sometimes but when I bring up a support group (we even<br/>
&gt; went to one) she shrugs it off. When I suggested 4-H  she had no interest.<br/>
Or<br/>
&gt; she replies with &quot;Mom , that is so queer&quot; Truthfully at this point I am at<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; complete loss .Now I am having a problem with family members. I had<br/>
mentioned<br/>
&gt; to my sister that Kearstins test results came in and she did really good<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; them. She said that was great. But while we are on the subject I wanted to<br/>
&gt; talk to you about this homeschooling thing. (None of my family members<br/>
&gt; supports me on this , except my wonderful husband.) So of course I was a<br/>
&gt; little on gaurd. She said that my family had a &quot; Family Discussion&quot; about<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; and that they felt that homeschooling was not in &quot;The Best Interest of<br/>
&gt; Kearstin&quot; as there is no  structure and every kid needs stucture!!! I was<br/>
&gt; livid at first . My reaction was who the hell are you to discuss my family<br/>
&gt; and who do you think you are telling me that I might unknowingly hurt my<br/>
&gt; child . My poor sister was elected by the family to have this talk with me<br/>
&gt; because she is the most likely to be open and compassionate.??? She said<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; is was discussed that maybe someone should make a phone call to child<br/>
&gt; services so that I would comply with my familys wishes and send my<br/>
daughter<br/>
&gt; back to school where she will recieve stucture!!!  You will be happy to<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; that I did not lose control.,...... or my temper I did not even raise my<br/>
&gt; voice. I talked it out with my sister I put myself in there shoes and<br/>
thought<br/>
&gt; how I could explain my views and hopes. She felt aweful and asked me if I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; mad at her. I said no Im not mad. I am hurt and disappointed that nobody<br/>
&gt; called me to ask me in the first place . That if they were so concerned<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; would have gone to the bookstore and read up on homeschooling and<br/>
unschooling<br/>
&gt; and tryed to see where I was coming from. That really it was none of their<br/>
&gt; business how I bring up my daughter, but because they said they were<br/>
&gt; concerned I would try to help them understand.  I asked my sister that if<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; brought her some books , would she read them and try to at least get an<br/>
idea<br/>
&gt; of unschooling. Then at least even if she dosnt agree she will know why<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; dosnt agree. I told her I wouldnt change my mind about unschooling because<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; believe in my heart that its the right thing to do. But that I would keep<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; family updated on her progress. (as soon as I figure that one out.)<br/>
&gt; So I left there feeling very unsure of myself and found myself questioning<br/>
&gt; yet again if I really knew what I was  doing. I talked with my husband (<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; just about went through the roof when I told him of the family discussion)<br/>
&gt; But he assured me that we were doing fine and we should keep waiting for<br/>
&gt; Kearstin to show signs of Motivation. If any kind soul would like to send<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; some advice or reassurences. I would be most grateful as I turn to the<br/>
lists<br/>
&gt; for my support.  Thank you all for reading this very long post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252000258">For the younger children, under 6th grade, we use Reader Rabbit, Jump Start<br/>
(those are the best, by far), and I just look through the computer section<br/>
whenever I am at a store that has one.  I found some at WalMart the other<br/>
day called &quot;school zone&quot;.  For my older son, I bought him a GED program that<br/>
he has really enjoyed.  He liked seeing where he was, and how far he could<br/>
go.  He loves reading encyclopedia&#39;s on the computer or otherwise.  I spend<br/>
money on these on a regular basis, because always having new ones really<br/>
keeps their interest up.<br/>
They like this so much, I have to scedule times on the computer for them so<br/>
they won&#39;t fight over it.  I don&#39;t ever buy games that don&#39;t teach, you<br/>
know, the video type games.  I try to make everything they have access to in<br/>
our house a learning experience.<br/>
They are not bored, and seem to be keeping up pretty well.<br/>
