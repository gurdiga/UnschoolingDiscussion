<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943262395">Have to agree with the other two posts. Can&#39;t see the harm in classes even if it is due to past learning issues. Might be a way to work it out. Classes can be very different than school. My daughter is doing a Chinese water colour painting class. She learns very well from books on her own but really has taken to this. I think there is something else she is getting from it.This one is with adults and she is 14. Loves it.So who knows.He will likely be best to know even if it takes a bit of experimenting to find out.<br/>
