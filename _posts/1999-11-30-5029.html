early and fussy from naps, probably because laying down made her ear <br/>
hurt more.  As it progressed she would get lethargic and run fevers.  <br/>
That said - my son also had ear infections and never acted this way.<br/>
He would just act downright mean and grumpy.  Good luck - hope he&#39;s <br/>
better soon!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014228747">Hi there all.  I know there are some medical folks on this list, as well as<br/>
more experienced parents, so I need a little help with my baby (20 months.)<br/>
 I am on my first day of recovery, feeling slightly better, from a VERY<br/>
nasty cold, with upper sinus congetion, cough, etc.  Alex (the baby) who<br/>
sleeps in our room, woke up this morning fussy and whiney (very unlike him,<br/>
who usually wakes with a smile) and has been running a fever, had diareah<br/>
(sp?), is coughing a little, has been fussy some and lathargic some.  <br/>
<br/>
He has not eaten much today, but has eaten some, and he has run around and<br/>

and obviously uncomfortable.  He is running a fever of 102 (on the<br/>
thermoscan) and has been lying in my lap, lathargic, not &quot;speaking&quot; or<br/>
moving much except his eyes for about an hour now.  I gave him some<br/>
ibuprofen to get his fever down, any other suggestions?  Just thought I&#39;d<br/>
ask.  It&#39;s not like he and his brother have never been sick before, but I<br/>
usually call the doctor for advice, and of course they always tell me to<br/>
come in (and spend 50-100 bucks) and we are in the process of looking for a<br/>
new doc. as we are not real happy with our current one.  So I thought I<br/>
would ask you all instead.  Hope someone is listening!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467820555">When someone has a shower, take him with 4 steam. Give him any clear liquids<br/>
he will take or some fluid replacement liquid that they sell in stores 4<br/>
sick little ones to keep him from getting 2 dehydrated.   Also Olbas oil is<br/>
good for clearing sinus congestion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235149520">I&#39;m NOT a medical expert!  My friend mentioned spinal meningitis.  If it<br/>
hurts him to bend his head forward (to touch his chin to his chest) get<br/>
help fast!  (At least that&#39;s what my friend said)<br/>
Otherwise, I hope it&#39;s a viral thing that passes quickly.<br/>
Also, breast milk does count as a clear liquid.<br/>
