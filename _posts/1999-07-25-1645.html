<div id="ygrps-yiv-460377437">Just a little further south (less than 30 minutes) is Venice Beach - famous <br/>
for shark&#39;s teeth!  You can just walk along the beach and practically scoop <br/>
them up. We haven&#39;t been in a few years (We live in Cape Coral, a little <br/>
further south yet), but I hear that it&#39;s still like that.<br/>
<br/>
Mote Marine is also in Sarasota, a great marine research facility.  Again, <br/>
it&#39;s been years since we&#39;ve been, but the public school kids do field trips <br/>
there, and I&#39;m sure it would be possible to set something up - a tour, or <br/>
maybe they&#39;re open to the public.  If you can&#39;t find anything about it, let <br/>
me know and I&#39;ll see what I can do from this end.<br/>
<br/>
Now you&#39;ve got me wanting to make a drive up to Sarasota!  We go every March <br/>
to the Rennaisance Faire, and occasionally to St. Armand&#39;s Key (which is a <br/>
wonderful little &quot;roundabout&quot;, full of exclusive shops and restaurants, and <br/>
the best place to walk around and windowshop!), but it&#39;s been awhile...hmmm, <br/>
let me know when you&#39;re going to be there, Sandy, and maybe we could meet <br/>
somewhere?  <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I can help any more from here :)<br/>

re: Ringling Museums.<br/>
Wow!  Now we have to try and plan this out to see a lot! Should be lots of<br/>

<br/>
The one in Sarasota is the first weekend of March (Thursday - Sunday), on the <br/>
grounds of the Ringling Museum, right on Hwy. 41.  There&#39;s another one in <br/>
Largo (near St. Pete) in April, and it runs for like 5 or 6 weekends. We&#39;ve <br/>
never been to that one, but have heard it&#39;s really good.  The Sarasota one is <br/>
our absolute favorite thing to do - we love it!!! <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a site with a listing of Renaissance Faires all over the country - and <br/>
I have a ton more sites, if you&#39;d like them; just let me know and I&#39;ll share <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we&#39;ll meet in Sarasota next year!<br/>

Hey! I don&#39;t know what we are talkin about, but if it is getting together, <br/>
and we can figure out where, remember you are talking to a woman who has NO <br/>
sense of direction and has nightmares about getting lost on the interstate!  <br/>
I am ready!!!  go for it<br/>

Have you been to the one in Miami?  It is at   Viz Caya, an Italian villa     <br/>

Festival at Vizcaya<br/>
&lt;/A&gt;  This is the most beautiful, elegant festival,  All the people connected <br/>
with the festival wear costumes and the King and Queen walk through the <br/>
grounds until the plays begin.  They do dances of the period, sword fights, <br/>
live chess game, and tie it all together as one theme.  We went last year for <br/>
the first time, and the boys can&#39;t wait for the next one.<br/>
