If you like to work from writing prompts here are some questions to get you going:<br/>
 <br/>
What are some of your favorite late night adventures?<br/>
Ever had your kids want to do or talk about something late at night? <br/>
Did you transition to &quot;no bedtimes&quot; or did it all flow naturally?<br/>
How and where does everyone sleep? Family bed? Musical beds?<br/>
How do you and your spouse get &quot;quality time&quot; together? <br/>
How do you get your personal needs met when kids are &quot;up all night&quot;? <br/>
When visiting family and friends, do you get questions or unpleasant comments? How do you deal?</div>
