&lt;&lt; I wanted to ask if you were still good with bringing that plate for Kelly,<br/>
or if it might be easier for you to mail it, and I&#39;ll just pay you when you<br/>
get here? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
La la la  (Shhhhhhhhhhhh.  That wasn&#39;t private e-mail.)<br/>
Yes, Keith the greatest packer has packed it up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YIKES!  Stay safe. <br/>
<br/>
We had a night like that once when we lived in a somewhat seedy apartment<br/>
complex in Columbia.  We were out on our balcony relaxing when five cops<br/>
came across the lawn with their guns drawn asking for building 333.  We were<br/>
like, &quot;Uh, that&#39;s this one.  Listen, we&#39;re, uh, going inside now!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to ask if you were still good with bringing that plate for Kelly,<br/>
or if it might be easier for you to mail it, and I&#39;ll just pay you when you<br/>
get here?  I don&#39;t want you to feel overloaded.  It occurred to me later<br/>
that you&#39;ll have boxes of tapes and maybe thinking sticks, and presentation<br/>
stuff, too.  Sorry I saddled you with this.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re staying with Kelly&#39;s mom now.  It&#39;s better, Tim and Duncan just didn&#39;t<br/>
work out together.  I had a great time up in Greenville with my friend from<br/>
Germany who moved to SC.  Tim says he&#39;s definitely going to marry her<br/>
daughter now.  :)<br/>
<br/>
See you later this week.  Maybe I&#39;ll be done ranting at Deniz by then....&lt;g&gt;<br/>
