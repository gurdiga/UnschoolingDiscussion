Evidence Of Jesus Written In Stone<br/>
Ossuary Of Jesus&#39; Brother Backs Up Biblical Accounts<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The new find is also significant in that it corroborates the <br/>
&gt;existence of Joseph, Jesus&#39; father, and James, Jesus&#39; brother and a <br/>
&gt;leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. The family <br/>
&gt;relationships contained on the new find helped experts ascertain <br/>
&gt;that the inscription very likely refers to the Biblical James, <br/>
&gt;brother of Jesus (see, for example, Matthew 13:55-56 and Galatians <br/>
&gt;1:18-19). Although all three names were common in ancient times, the <br/>
&gt;statistical probability of their appearing in that combination is <br/>
&gt;extremely slim. In addition, the mention of a brother is <br/>
&gt;unusual--indicating that this Jesus must have been a well-known <br/>
&gt;figure.<br/>

This is cross posted to this AND unschooling.com (and I don&#39;t know what all <br/>
else).<br/>
<br/>
I cross posted my broken leg, but let&#39;s leave biblical archeology out of this <br/>
list, if that&#39;s okay with others here.<br/>
