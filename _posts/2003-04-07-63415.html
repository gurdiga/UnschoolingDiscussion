&lt;&lt; Thanks for the help dispite the sarcasm. I don&#39;t get to the bottom of the<br/>
<br/>
emails as I find them petty and self serving. And I must add truely<br/>
<br/>
disappointing. K &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HUH!<br/>
<br/>
At least we were writing about unschooling.<br/>
This and the first one were about Karen/kgiuffre and how disappointed she is <br/>
and how she, Karen/kgiuffre needs help to get off the list.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a TOTAL waste of time.  So I&#39;m adding to it, but doing it in the name <br/>
of the sadly disappointed Karen/kgiuffre.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve needed a place for a rant and I shall append it here.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, writing that every e-mail has instructions for leaving the <br/>
list isn&#39;t sarcasm.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m to be accused of sarcasm, I&#39;d much prefer it to be by someone who <br/>
knows what sarcasm is.<br/>
<br/>
THIS is not sarcasm:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At the bottom of every single e-mail there are instructions for getting<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>off the list, which means that will appear at the bottom of this e-mail, and<br/>
<br/>
was at the bottom of the e-mail saying &quot;help me get off the list.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And now my little complaint, starting with a compliment.<br/>
<br/>
There are people here whose kind and patient generosity shines with the <br/>
sweetest light.  People will ask us whether there really ARE lists for <br/>
ecelctic homeschooling, or where to find more information on unschooling, or <br/>
what we mean by this thing, or that thing, or who some author or writer is, <br/>
or something.<br/>
<br/>
And someone will patiently answer.<br/>
<br/>
And here is where the answers come from:<br/>
<br/>
google.com<br/>
or<br/>
yahoogroups<br/>
<br/>
Someone will go to those webpages and open them, type in the search word, <br/>
look through the first list offered, find a good one, cut and paste it or <br/>
find a URL, after checking to see if that&#39;s a good example, and then come <br/>
back to the message board or e-mail list and offer it sweetly to the person <br/>
who asked.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll do it if the thing is interesting to me, or was hard to find. <br/>
<br/>
But if it&#39;s something the person could have easily found herself, I start to <br/>
get edgy.<br/>
<br/>
Asking people who know is a reasonable way to get information, but if <br/>
someone&#39;s being an unschooling mom, I think she should start moving toward <br/>
being a model of resourcefulness for her children.   At least to the point of <br/>
using search functions at yahoogroups or a search engine.<br/>
<br/>
At least to the point of looking at the bottom of an e-mail to see if it <br/>
tells how to get off the list, without blaming the people on the list for <br/>
boring her too much for her to be willing to get her own information.<br/>
<br/>
I do remember being new to the internet and it being a pretty weird and <br/>
inefficient place.  But nowadays it&#39;s very efficient.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to ask a librarian where a book is instead of looking it up, I <br/>
suppose, and that&#39;s probably basically what&#39;s going on.  But the librarian <br/>
applied for that job and is being paid to do it.  To just go in and ask the <br/>
other patrons to find your books seems a little breezy to me.  <br/>
<br/>
And if someone&#39;s paying by the minute to be online, they can&#39;t goof around <br/>
with google for free.  I understand that, and am willing to help somone if <br/>
they&#39;re new or don&#39;t have a free dial-up or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has never used www.google.com should go there and just goof with <br/>
it.  Throw your own name in.  Your dog&#39;s name.  The name of the <br/>
funniest-sounding city you ever heard of.   Your favorite cartoon.   A <br/>
president.   <br/>
<br/>
Kings of France.  There is a really cool list of those here:<br/>

<br/>
And there&#39;s music.   That song is commonly called (these days) &quot;Ding Dong <br/>
Merrily on High&quot; because someone put Christmas words to it, but it was a <br/>
dance piece before that, called &quot;Official Bransle&quot;---very  nice tune, and <br/>
that&#39;s a great midi of it, too!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll start a new thread for people to show us the interesting webpages <br/>
they&#39;ve come across in their wanderings.<br/>
