BREAKING NEWS from CNN.com<br/>
<br/>
NEW YORK (CNN) -- Terrorists struck the United States Tuesday morning <br/>
in harrowing, widespread attacks that included at least three <br/>
commercial jet crashes into significant buildings.<br/>
<br/>
In the first attack, a plane hit the north tower of the World Trade <br/>
Center in Manhattan shortly before 9 a.m., followed by another plane <br/>
into the second tower about 20 minutes later. Both towers later <br/>
collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
About an hour later, a plane crashed into the Pentagon, part of which <br/>
later collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
American Airlines told CNN that it lost two planes in &quot;tragic <br/>
accidents:&quot; Flight 11 from Boston with 81 passengers and 11 crew <br/>
aboard and Flight 77 from Washington Dulles airport with 58 <br/>
passengers and six crew aboard. Both planes were en route to Los <br/>
Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
United Airlines Flight 93 airliner headed from Newark, New Jersey, to <br/>
San Francisco, crashed near Somerset, Pennsylvania -- police said <br/>
initial reports indicated no survivors. United also confirmed the <br/>
crash of Flight 175 from Boston to Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
The Pentagon, the White House, the State Department, the Justice <br/>
Department, the Capitol, the CIA and all other government buildings <br/>
in Washington evacuated.<br/>
<br/>
President Bush cancelled an appearance in Florida to return to <br/>
Washington, calling the crashes &quot;apparent terrorist attacks&quot; and &quot;a <br/>
national tragedy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the first ever national ground stop of aircraft, all flights <br/>
nationwide have been stopped at their departure airports. All <br/>
international flights were diverted to Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, said in <br/>
reaction to the news of the terror attacks that &quot;we want to tell the <br/>
American children that Afghanistan feels your pain and we hope that <br/>
the courts find justice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In New York, more than 10,000 rescue personnel rushed to the scene. <br/>
The entire downtown area of Manhattan was evacuated as far north as <br/>
Rockefeller Center, according to an official at an emergency command <br/>
post.<br/>
