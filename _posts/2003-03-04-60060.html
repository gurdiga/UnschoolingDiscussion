 </span></blockquote>I totally agree.  So having said that...what would you say to the mother that <br/>
said the girl couldn&#39;t come back if she didn&#39;t clean up?<br/>
I couldn&#39;t believe someone would say that.<br/>

should be modelling for our kids.<br/>

<br/>
  True.  I&#39;m an adult and when I stay with someone else, I try to minimize whatever work I create for them by offering to help or bringing my own stuff, or whatever.  I try to make that obvious to my kids and I encourage them to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
  Of course, the results often depend on age and maturity, but I do want my kids to know that the polite thing to do is help out.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So having said that...what would you say to the mother that <br/>
said the girl couldn&#39;t come back if she didn&#39;t clean up?<br/>
I couldn&#39;t believe someone would say that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would just help the kids clean up, speaking really sweetly to the girls <br/>
(not the mom) the whole time, and remind my daughter on the way home that <br/>
different houses have really different rules, and that when she&#39;s a mom she <br/>
will get to decide what kind of rules to make at HER house.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly really enjoys the differences in different houses and families.  She <br/>
thinks some of them are weird or not too bright, but it gives her a lot to <br/>
think about and I have no doubt she&#39;ll choose to be like the best of them and <br/>
for really good personal reasons, instead of some parotted, kneejerk thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe this mom thinks playdate rules are school rules.  Kids clean up before <br/>
the bell rings or something.  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
