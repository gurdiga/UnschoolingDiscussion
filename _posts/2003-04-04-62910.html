old he is) affiliating himself (volunteer, part-time job, or some other <br/>
kind of apprentice relationship) with your local cable company.  They <br/>
almost always have a production component (producing ads for clients and <br/>
also a public access  station).  The other thing is poring through the <br/>
phone book and trying to establish some similar kind of relationship with a <br/>
local video production guy.  There are loads of these kinds of guys these <br/>
days who have an office/studio in their basement or garage and shoot videos <br/>
for weddings, etc., and other kinds of video projects.  Finally, my husband <br/>
works in the TV studio of a community college.  Again, I imagine that his <br/>
age would make a difference here, but he has seen a number of serious <br/>
students emerge from the college and go on to careers in the video/film <br/>
industry.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439321529">In addition to endorsing Marji&#39;s ideas which focus on the video<br/>
production aspect, I have a couple of suggestions. BTW, for the last 20<br/>
years I have been everything in technical theater from stage manager to<br/>
Set, Lighting and Costume Designer, at every level of professional,<br/>
amateur and community theater.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would suggest getting involved in your local college or community<br/>
theater initially. Usually they have way more people interested in<br/>
acting than in technical production, and someone wanting to work in<br/>
production will be just about overwhelmed with gratitude. The person to<br/>
see is the Technical Director, who will know which departments need the<br/>
greatest assistance. In this type of theater there are usually a number<br/>
of people on staff, heading departments, with visiting directors and<br/>
often visiting designers. If your local theater is well established<br/>
sometimes the designers can be highly placed, or members of the faculty<br/>
of design/theater schools.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you register at  www.playbill.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.playbill.com/">http://www.playbill.com/</a>&gt;   you<br/>
will find they have job listings seeking workers, including interns and<br/>
summer stock positions, in theater all over the country. I love this<br/>
site. Also they sometimes advertise for teachers at college level, which<br/>
can be a good starting point for investigating colleges.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A good magazine to get is &quot;Entertainment Design&quot;<br/>
www.entertainmentdesignmag.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.entertainmentdesignmag.com/">http://www.entertainmentdesignmag.com/</a>&gt;<br/>
. This magazine focuses on technical theater and design, and sometimes<br/>
has job listings, as well as lots of info about the newest gear.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
General skills you can bring to the stage: carpentry, painting,<br/>
organization, sewing, architectural drafting especially CAD, research<br/>
skills, model building.<br/>
<br/>
The special skills in technical theater are easily learnable - ie the<br/>
jargon, the equipment, design skills, stage management. Beware that not<br/>
everyone in every community theater does things the way they do in fully<br/>
professional situations ;)<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to try and audit some university classes in technical<br/>
theater - this will save you some time instead of learning everything<br/>
over time on the job.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It can be immensely time consuming to work in theater, but also<br/>
immensely rewarding and fun.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>
Robyn Coburn<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
PS Don&#39;t mention the Scottish Play inside a theater - some people are<br/>
very superstitious, especially actors. They can get almost hysterical.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-581597649">also try your local community theatre. They always need tech people, and <br/>
ours tapes all their productions. He would get a ton of experience. My <br/>
12 yo dd is involved in our community theatre, as an actor, and she has <br/>
learned a great deal.<br/>
