<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324406895">I returned a post and then I felt bad about it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the main part:<br/>
<br/>
 We have a penpal database <br/>
for kids, teens, and moms looking for a penpal. In order to <br/>
be a part of this group you MUST exchange a <br/>
postcard/greeting card each month. And you must follow <br/>
through once you sign up. We don&#39;t want any hurt children <br/>
waiting for a card that never arrives!<br/>
<br/>
The address of the site:<br/>

<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t anyone blame this list if your family doesn&#39;t have a perfect <br/>
experience.  There are no  perfect experiences.  Maybe this group has figured out <br/>
brilliant ways to overcome the problems inherent in such exchanges both for families <br/>
from heavily populated areas and those from sparse places.<br/>
