To everyone who slammed Karol   You really oughta be ashamed of yourselves.<br/>
did i miss some e mail?  i only remember comments about the letter.<br/>
personally i&#39;m never ashamed i just learn from my mistakes.  could you point<br/>
out what exactly people should be &#39;ashamed&#39; of?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Read, and decide for yourselves what you think.&quot;<br/>
and that&#39;s exactly what people did and they passed their opinions on to the<br/>
group.  sorry if it wasn&#39;t as &#39;pretty&#39; and polite as you would like but to<br/>
&#39;slam&#39; others for &#39;slamming&#39; seems abit odd, to me it would be interesting if<br/>
you discussed the letter (as i feel other have been doing- unless i missed<br/>
something)  rather than &#39;defend&#39; someone who is really not being attacked.   i<br/>
feel that everyone has a right to express themselves like someone said hit the<br/>
delete- everyone has one.<br/>
<br/>
there is nothing wrong with people disagreeing, to me differences of opinion<br/>
are critical for a healthy community - just think how boring life would be if<br/>
we all agreed:)   also i do not recall any personal comments against karol<br/>
just opinion stated about the letter- and again this has virtually nothing to<br/>
do with pokemon but is about the judgmental, aggressive, and exclusive tone of<br/>
the letter which karol merely passed on - she did not write.  now she knows<br/>
what a number of people think.  maybe a different take on the letter will<br/>
prove to be interesting.   i know if i sent something i personally would enjoy<br/>
a different take hence &#39;do on to others as you would have done on to you&#39;.<br/>
we read it and some of us decided the position and argument was seriously<br/>
flawed - that does not mean anyone is or is not endorsing pokemon.   in fact i<br/>
believe those of us who did have negative interpretation of the letter stated<br/>
that the problem we saw with pokemon was the commercialism - hardly glowing<br/>
support.   and i don&#39;t remember  anyone suggesting that karol no longer<br/>
participate - it would be silly to do that,  just that the topic was not<br/>
appropriate and to be fair the letter has a &#39;fire and brimstone&#39; preaching<br/>
tone which is not exactly what this group is about.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not force-feeding anyone anything.  Maybe you personally didn&#39;t<br/>
appreciate her post, but some of us did.<br/>
nor is anyone forcing you,  karol or anyone to read our comments,  if you<br/>
found something good in the letter hold on to it and pass it on if you are so<br/>
moved, each individual voice is important.<br/>
<br/>
Speak for yourself and yourself only.  You are one among many.<br/>
did someone speak for the whole group or did they express what they felt the<br/>
group was about?<br/>
<br/>
How does it look when we, as homeschoolers, can&#39;t even get along amongst<br/>
ourselves?  United we stand, divided we fall.<br/>
the iroquios have a saying &#39;unity through diversity&#39;  so why can&#39;t our<br/>
diversity be accessible? what&#39;s wrong with just commenting on a topic without<br/>
it being taken as a personal attack?  to me this is real strength.   why is it<br/>
that feedback can&#39;t be accepted if it&#39;s perceived as &#39;bad&#39;?   i, for myself,<br/>
learn a lot from failures, different points of view etc. and i thought that&#39;s<br/>
what this is about-a forum to express ourselves and to hear other perspectives<br/>
within the context of unschooling.  i don&#39;t feel the spirit of this has been<br/>
lost and would encourage more people to introduce concepts that they find<br/>
intriguing and ask other members for their take on it.<br/>
<br/>
God Bless. (If that offends anyone, TOUGH!)<br/>
how could your personal beliefs be offensive?  that would only happen it you<br/>
tried to force me to believe what you believe.  may you find some peace and<br/>
compassion good luck to you<br/>

<br/>
How does it look to whom?  Frankly it&#39;s insulting to be told to sit down<br/>
and be quiet because we are rocking the boat, or some such notion.  Who<br/>
cares what we &quot;Look Like&quot;?  I thought we were among friends.  Or is there a<br/>
discretionary committee of judgemental, superficial &#39;old women&#39; peeping<br/>
through the curtains at us who are going to gossip to the neighbors?<br/>
The initial address of the letter in question &quot;As Christian<br/>
Parents/Grandparents..&quot; does, as someone else already mentioned, completely<br/>
lump everyone together on this list as Christian. I take exception to that,<br/>
not being Christian, as do a number of other list members.  As others have<br/>
mentioned, this is an INCLUSIVE list.  There are plenty of lists out there<br/>
that are slanted towards particular religious views, and in particular a<br/>
large number of Christian Homeschooling lists.  I would like to see this<br/>
list remain open and welcoming to those of all faiths.  <br/>
