<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889621510">I&#39;m a newbie here and am coming out of lurking mode to chime in.  I have a 10 yr old whom I pulled out of public school to homeschool 3 years ago.  We started with &#39;playing school&#39; via prepackaged curriculums and fell from there.  After months of agonizing frustration on both our parts, and admitted laziness on mine, we fell into unschooling, before I actually *knew* the definition.  We are now at a point where my family is pressuring both myself and my daughter because she doesn&#39;t know her multiplication tables &#39;like all the *normal* kids her age&#39;.  Among other things kids her age *should* know.  Dd has actually cried because she thinks she is dumb.  I feel like this is a direct result of Gramma&#39;s remarks.  I asked her what she would like to do about it and she said she wanted a math book to learn how to multiply.  We had tried games with acorns, pennies, tried cooking, etc. but she didn&#39;t feel like that was the *right* way to learn how to multiply.  So we bought a book she found interesting.....Making Math Meaningful Level 4.  She plunged in and plowed through the first chapter in one day.  She was so proud of herself, but on day two, she had no interest.  She said she was bored and tired of working.  Today she is content to play with her siblings, bowl with a local homeschoo league and read.  By experience, tomorrow could very well be another teary day.  This seems to be a pattern with us.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having the exact same problem??  with my 5 year old and reading.  She is aching to read, asks how things are spelled all the time, tries to read books and is either pleased at her progress or becomes increasingly frustrated when she can&#39;t, but clams up and turns away when we try any sort of &#39;formal work&#39; (at her request).  This child begs to do her &#39;homework&#39; all day long!<br/>
<br/>
My question is, how do you cope with a child who is so intent on &#39;playing school&#39; when you prefer a more natural way of learning..and *teaching*....and yet that same child loathes the whole &#39;school&#39; process once it is implimented at her request?  I am admittedly not where I would like to be in my unschooling thought processes.  I am shamefully still allowing my families fears to cause fears in my own abilities to allow my children to follow their own leads.  To make matters even more frustrating, now my husband, who once supported me fully, is beginning to have doubts.  He was fine when we were &#39;playing school at home&#39; but is now doubting me himself because he doesn&#39;t think they are up to par with all the other kids.    <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry this is so long winded but I sure would appreciate any words of wisdom/encouragement!<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer<br/>
  Frustraton and unhappyness have a deeper root than reading or math. Its <br/>
  usually centered around the ego, or lack of a healthy one. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;That is how I talke much of<br/>
  &gt;the philosophy espoused here . . . ignore the problems, leave the kids<br/>
  &gt;alone, they will learn when they want to.  Whether that&#39;s what you<br/>
  &gt;(general) mean to say or not, that is how it often sounds . . . and not<br/>
  &gt;just to me - others have told me they hear the same thing here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Theres a difference between ignoring and creating. As soon as you have <br/>
  expectations or lables, then problems begin.<br/>

she&#39;s aching to be read to.<br/>
<br/>
The best you can do is do your &#39;damdest&#39; to reiterate that societal <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This goes back to learning styles or if she really &#39;wants&#39; and doesn&#39;t <br/>
feel pressured from watching or listening to others. <br/>
<br/>
If she needs to learn a different way than you are teaching. See how she <br/>
interacts with other people. Try to see what style she seems to &#39;sparkle&#39; <br/>
with and cultivate that.<br/>
<br/>
It ain&#39;t easy, but its rewarding!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A friend of mine pulled her boy out of school after a couple of disastrous <br/>
years.  He had become quite traumatized over math, and she had learned to <br/>
just leave him alone about it.  Any attempt at explanations or anything <br/>
would have him getting all worked up.  &quot;I just don&#39;t get it!&quot;  After <br/>
several months, one night he pulled a math book off the shelf.  His mother <br/>
kept her mouth shut.  He opened the book to the middle and started <br/>
in.  Pretty soon his mother heard the familiar, &quot;I just don&#39;t get <br/>
it!&quot;  Again she kept her mouth shut.  After a while, he turned to the <br/>
beginning and began working.  He got through about half the book that <br/>
night.  He worked at it off and on for a few weeks and then stopped.  A few <br/>
weeks later, I visited and heard the latest math news.  He had started a <br/>
project of doubling numbers.  1+1+2, 2+2+4, etc.  This was all on his <br/>
own.  He had to ask his mother what came after trillions and they had to <br/>
look up together what came after quadrillions.  He stopped somewhere in the <br/>
quintillions!  That boy went on to become a very good professional <br/>
pianist.  Go figure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594537245">It&#39;s hard as heck when your spouse doesn&#39;t support you. IMO, I&#39;d sit down with him and explain *why* you feel this route is the best for your children. Point out that you&#39;ve done your homework and *know* what you&#39;re doing. Explain in a John Holt sort of way how children learn. Perhaps your dh didn&#39;t enjoy school???? Use that as an example that you don&#39;t want your kids to feel that way, too and that you want them to love learning because it&#39;s a lifelong process, especially in today&#39;s climate where technology is constantly changing. <br/>
About multiplication tables.. my 15.5 yr old dd never formally learned her tables either yet she&#39;s teaching herself Algebra from Harold Jacob&#39;s Elementary Algebra.  Just understanding what multiplication *is* can go a long way. Now, my dd knows the tables but only because she&#39;s used them over and over again in her use of this book. IMO, Miquan Math is one of the *best* products on the market for showing math concepts over drill and kill methods. It&#39;s for the younger set, though... not teens.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This desire to do something she may not be developmentally ready for may<br/>
just be something she&#39;ll have to work past on her own. Is this part of her<br/>
personality that she wants to keep pushing at something she can&#39;t do?<br/>
<br/>
It could be she&#39;s a natural sight reader and the formal rules won&#39;t make<br/>
sense to her. It can be frustrating when she&#39;s trying to figure out the<br/>
rules for herself  and English breaks so many of them.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book called Games for Learning by Peggy Kaye that has lots of<br/>
reading games that supposedly give kids whatever key it is they&#39;re missing<br/>
in decoding reading. Do them as fun games rather than formal lessons.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time you can do less formal things like labelling everything and<br/>
then mixing up all the labels. Read rhyming poetry so she can see the<br/>
connection between words that sound the same. Perhaps she&#39;d enjoy a book on<br/>
homonyms -- or whatever the words are that sound the same but are spelled<br/>
differently. If she&#39;s a list type person you could get a rhyming dictionary<br/>
and show her the lists of words that sounds the same. If she asks why<br/>
something is spelled the way it is, then look it up in the dictionary for<br/>
her and find out where the word came from. (The American Heritage I think<br/>
has good word histories.) She might enjoy some reading programs for the<br/>
computer. How about books on tape that come with the book so she can control<br/>
the pace of hearing and reading. There are also the Living Books series of<br/>
software (Arthur&#39;s Reading Race, Just Grandma and Me and a slew of others)<br/>
that will read it for her, or read the parts she clicks on.<br/>
<br/>
Few of us learn in one way so the more and varied ways she encounters words<br/>
and reading, the better.<br/>

(http://www.unschooling.com). There are also articles that you could print<br/>
out for him or email him. There are also the message boards which you could<br/>
pull bits and pieces from.<br/>
<br/>
You need a polite way of getting him to see that there&#39;s more to learning<br/>
that he believes. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s certain he has a full picture of what kids<br/>
need in order to learn, but he doesn&#39;t. You can gently point out that you&#39;re<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461854739">&lt;&lt;Is this part of her<br/>
personality that she wants to keep pushing at something she can&#39;t do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  She is very bright, especially mathematically....she is only 5 and already understands the concept of multiplying and dividing and loves to set the table so she can figure out how many forks and spoons everyone gets, etc.....but this leads to perfectionism and competitiveness, since her older sister struggles mathematically.  <br/>
<br/>
The girls often play school together, with my oldest teaching her how to read, but my oldest won&#39;t go for the 5 yr old teaching her math.  lol  She has expressed that since she knows math so well, she should be able to read as well.  I think most of the struggle is helping her to understand strengths and weaknesses, without making her feel weak, does that make sense at all??<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;What do you mean by her request? Is she saying she wants book work and then<br/>
you choose what to do and she doesn&#39;t like what you choose? I&#39;m not getting<br/>
a sense of the dynamic involved. Does she choose her own books from the<br/>
store? Do you have a teacher&#39;s store or even better an educational toy store<br/>
where she can see a broader range of learning resources.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When she requests book work, we shop together...whether from our own personal library, the public library, or a local homeschool store.  I try to pick out what I think may help her while she picks out what she likes.  We then sit down with both our selections and I let her chose what she wants.  Sometimes, she&#39;ll stick with her choices and others she may chose mine, but the final decision is always hers with no intervention on my part.  Sometimes that means a Pre-K book that is too simple, which she bores quickly with or a book that is too difficult, which frustrates her.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; That could be part of the problem too. She may be picking up those signals<br/>
that she isn&#39;t good enough.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Highly probable, especially considering my family has no qualms in telling her how MUCH smarter she would be if she were in *real* school.  There are many public school teachers in my family, which, I believe, is a big part of all the criticism.  Perhaps they feel like *I* don&#39;t think *they* are good enough.  Sort of a catch 22 there, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Will he read? You need a polite way of getting him to see that there&#39;s more to learning<br/>
that he believes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just had this discussion a few nights ago.  I offered him print materials, as well as net and he wasn&#39;t interested in reading either.  He feels threatened by the fact that our children might actually learn in a more natural and maybe even better?  way then he or I did as ps children....I mean, hey, we turned out fine, didn&#39;t we?  This is a very hard subject to move around in politely.  The odd thing is, he sees how happy they are, how bright they are, yet he still holds to the fact that they would be just as bright in EVERY subject if they were in public school, or at least learning what ps children learn.  He is NOT opposed to homeschooling, he is highly doubtful of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this clears up any confusion.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819361769">&lt;&lt;This is a different issue and a tough one to boot. I don&#39;t have the <br/>
answer. When the support isn&#39;t there outside the family, its one thing. <br/>
But when the support isn&#39;t there inside the family, its another.&gt;&gt;<br/>

I don&#39;t know if this will help your situation at all, but I did sit down and talk with him and as politely as I could explained that if he wishes to read and gain a better understanding, then I will sit down and objectively discuss it with him.  I didn&#39;t put it across as threatening, just assertive.  He agreed to disagree for the time being.  But he still refused to do the reading.  In our past experience, that basically means either he agrees with me, but won&#39;t admit it, or he&#39;s just being lazy and gave up trying to change my mind.  Sad, I know, but that&#39;s where we stand.<br/>

&gt;I offered him print materials, as well as net and he wasn&#39;t interested in <br/>
&gt;reading either.  He feels threatened by the fact that our children might <br/>
&gt;actually learn in a more natural and maybe even better?  way then he or I <br/>
&gt;did as ps children....I mean, hey, we turned out fine, didn&#39;t we?  This is <br/>
&gt;a very hard subject to move around in politely.  The odd thing is, he sees <br/>
&gt;how happy they are, how bright they are, yet he still holds to the fact <br/>
&gt;that they would be just as bright in EVERY subject if they were in public <br/>
&gt;school, or at least learning what ps children learn.  He is NOT opposed to <br/>
&gt;homeschooling, he is highly doubtful of unschooling.<br/>

ps. I left him for two years over it and we did great. Unfortunate <br/>
circumstances brought us back. :-(</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810826710">&lt;&lt;If she&#39;s &#39;aching&#39; to read, it will click. Unless the &#39;ache&#39; is a reaction <br/>
to outside influence. Places you might not expect it to come by. Maybe <br/>
she&#39;s aching to be read to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it does have a lot to do with outside influence.  She feels pressured by my family for sure....not sure how to handle that one, but we do read together a LOT.  I feel like she is doing a great job where she is, but she always wants MORE.  I feel certain that things will click any day now as she requests the same books over and over and retains more and more each day.  She reminds me of a certain someone I&#39;m married to who doesn&#39;t give in until he gets it right.....even though he&#39;s screaming mad during the process. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It ain&#39;t easy, but its rewarding!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, I couldn&#39;t have said it any better myself!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
