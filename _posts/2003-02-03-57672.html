<div id="ygrps-yiv-96804818"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There are millions of mean Christian parents who don&#39;t even homeschool who<br/>
&gt; would consider &quot;the sovereignty of children&quot; to be blasphemous.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you.  I don&#39;t care what you call them.  Just please define them more<br/>
narrowly than &quot;Christian&quot;, since what it does mean is:<br/>
<br/>
a person professing belief in Jesus as the Christ, or in the religion based<br/>
on the teachings of Jesus.<br/>
(Webster&#39;s New World Dictionary of the American Language, Second College<br/>
Ed., p. 253)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hope there are also millions who wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> The REST of us &quot;who wouldn&#39;t&quot; are entitled to call our chosen faith<br/>
Christian.  I refuse to give up that name.  Yes, it&#39;s a sore topic for me.<br/>
But it&#39;s one that affects an awful lot of people.<br/>
