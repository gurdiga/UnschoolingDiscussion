&gt;&gt; Subject: Redwoods<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; You guys are making me homesick! I used to live (before kids) in Guerneville<br/>
&gt;&gt; and would walk or ride my bike under the redwoods in Armstrong Woods.. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; lived (and worked) in Healdsburg for a short while too...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I still miss it, Nina. When I was really little we lived in Deer<br/>
&gt; Park, on the road to Armstrong Redwoods State Park, and then we moved<br/>
&gt; across the road to a bigger house, and my parents bought the place<br/>
&gt; next door for my Grandma. She lived there for 30+ years... worked as<br/>
&gt; a cook at that big red & white restaurant on the corner in town...<br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t remember the name of that place. I remember sitting on the<br/>
&gt; beach down at the river and watching the pageant where they&#39;d throw<br/>
&gt; burning coals over a cliff into the river... I think they quit doing<br/>
&gt; that tho...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In Healdsburg my other Grandma spent her last 40 years on the north<br/>
&gt; side of town, I think they built a Safeway store on top of her old<br/>
&gt; orchard... She&#39;s buried up on Fitch Mountain. I always loved the<br/>
&gt; drive between my two Grandma&#39;s houses, over the old Dry Creek Road<br/>
&gt; between Healdsburg and Guerneville... It was so pretty, winding<br/>
&gt; through vineyards and orchards and redwoods and along the river!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good places. Good times. Sure is different now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Small world! You certainly have some history in the area!!<br/>
<br/>
I lived on Fitch Mountain and bought some great Merlot at that Safeway in<br/>
Healdsburg... it&#39;s where I met my husband (no, not the Safeway..) and we&#39;d<br/>
go bike riding along Dry Creek Rd... sigh<br/>
<br/>
We lived on Neeley Road - on the other side of town... in the last big flood<br/>
Neeley all but disappeared - a big chunk of it slid away... I can&#39;t remember<br/>
the name of that restaurant either... I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re talking about the<br/>
one next to the gas station that was only open during the &#39;season&#39;. They had<br/>
great fish and to die for strawberry shortcake!<br/>
<br/>
We moved from there over the hill from Calistoga into Lake County<br/>
(Middletown) where we shriveled up from 100 plus degree summers for the next<br/>
ten years.... what were we thinking???<br/>

people into what&#39;s now Sonoma County; his homestead was where the <br/>
Santa Rosa airport is now. Burke Hill Road, somewhere up north on Hwy <br/>
101, is named for him. When it got too crowded around Santa Rosa he <br/>
sold the homestead and took the first wheeled wagon into some big <br/>
valley up by Ukiah.<br/>

Have you been to the main branch of the Sonoma County library?  They now<br/>
have a historical room which has all the original homestead info and lots<br/>
and lots of old pictures.  It is really interesting for anyone who had<br/>
family there back when.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, when I&#39;ve been down there we&#39;ve usually preferred to hang out <br/>
with family or friends, or over at the coast or up in the <br/>
redwoods.... This last trip, for the first time ever, I finally got <br/>
to see the Exploratorium! What an awesome place! I loved that it was <br/>
in the old Palace of Fine Arts - I can remember my Mom taking me <br/>
there to feed the swans when I was about 5 or 6 and Dad worked at the <br/>
Presidio!<br/>
