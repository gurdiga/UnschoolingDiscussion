<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580902512">I did my psychology Master&#39;s thesis on whether the University of Houston&#39;s<br/>
selections criteria for their undergraduate psychology students predicted<br/>
success in the program (graduation).  I found zero correlation between SAT<br/>
scores, GPA, whatever and graduation.  I was thrilled to debunk the system.<br/>
I got called for an interview with the Dean for my troubles.  He was less<br/>
than thrilled.<br/>

Cool story!<br/>
<br/>
I think the whole way that research has to please the university power<br/>
structure for a researcher&#39;s career to flourish is problematic.  It&#39;s<br/>
hard for me to imagine why any Dean would ever promote truth over the<br/>
status quo.  I don&#39;t see this environment as being very supportive of<br/>
new ideas.  In fact, it&#39;s hard to imagine a way to organize that could<br/>
be any quicker at squelching ideas and dissent.<br/>
