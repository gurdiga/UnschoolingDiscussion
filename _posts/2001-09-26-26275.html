<div id="ygrps-yiv-516290885">I will throw this out and perhaps someone can show me a different way to look at it.<br/>
<br/>
I teach a karate class that is full of homeschoolers.  I started the class so I would have someone to play with  :)  I have taught karate for almost 10 years at a school in Houston I was attending.  Kids started at 5 there, but in the entire time I taught there, I know of maybe 3 or 4 kids who started so young that didn&#39;t simply find the class frustrating.  We would have additional &quot;helpers&quot; to assist the younger kids but it was simply very difficult for them to do what was being asked of them, balance-wise, attention-wise, strength-wise, etc..<br/>
<br/>
When I started my little class after we moved away from my school, I said &quot;ages 9 and up.&quot;  I would be the only teacher, no assistants available.  I would be starting with all beginners which takes a tremendous amount of time and energy in the best of circumstances.  My style is a very hard style and I am not interested in watering it down (that&#39;s why I&#39;m not attending the local schools).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880307789">Is there another school you respect enough to send those you don&#39;t think are <br/>
ready or serious enough for your own class?<br/>
<br/>
If so, maybe you could have a try-out and if they have the stamina and <br/>
balance and attention span and understanding you want (whether they&#39;re eight <br/>
or ten) you could accept them, and if they don&#39;t (whether they&#39;re nine or <br/>
not) you could recommend that other school.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids mature earlier than others.  Saying &quot;nine&quot; won&#39;t necessarily get <br/>
you what you want, and will bar some talented eight-year-old, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby started when he was nine and was the oldest and biggest in the kids&#39; <br/>
class he was in (for beginners, anyway).  Of those he started with, only one <br/>
is still there after nearly five years.  That boy was six or seven then and <br/>
is twelve now.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s fair or if &quot;fair&quot; can be accomplished, but I see what <br/>
seems unfair.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand states and federal governments not making exceptions for <br/>
drivers&#39; licenses, employment, visas and passports, etc. (although they DO <br/>
make exceptions in some cases), but a small group advertised for <br/>
homeschoolers has extra reason to be flexible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But what would you have done if I had come to you and said that my 8 year<br/>
old, or my 7 year old, was interested in the class, that my child was<br/>
more focused than most kids her age and had successfully particpated in a<br/>
number of physical activities with older children, and that I was willing<br/>
to hang out while she tried it on a trial basis to see if it was a good<br/>
fit. Or, conversely, what if you ended up with a 9 yr old who wasn&#39;t very<br/>
strong, had rotten balance, and got distracted easily?<br/>
<br/>
I think generalities are fine - &quot;This class is generally best-suited to X<br/>
to Y year olds, because it requires skills A, B, and C.&quot; I think<br/>
generalities will apply to many kids, but not all of them. Cacie is in<br/>
two dramam classes now, one for 8-10 yr olds and one for 6-9 yr olds.<br/>
She&#39;s 8...and the 6-9 yr old class isn&#39;t a good fit, because most of the<br/>
kids are a lot less focused than she is, and she gets frustrated a lot<br/>
because of it. The 8-10 yr old class, though, is much better. I really<br/>
think she&#39;d fit into the next class up from the 6-9 yr old one, which is<br/>
for 10-12 yr olds (this is singing-dance-acting, whereas the 8-10 one is<br/>
straight acting). Unfortunately, it meets on Saturday mornings (why do so<br/>
many things happen on Saturday mornings), and the soccer season has just<br/>
begun, with games every Saturday. But after soccer, I think I&#39;ll see if<br/>
she can try it...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193505453">Hi Julie.  Sounds reasonable to me. If you are the<br/>
Sensei you can teach whomever you please.  Lots of<br/>
teachers flat refuse to provide instruction to<br/>
children. It takes a mature teacher to know what they<br/>
can handle as far as class size, age, and skill level.<br/>
You can also refuse to provide instruction for<br/>
whatever reasons you choose, and you don&#39;t have to<br/>
tell anyone. It can be something as private as a bad<br/>
feeling or odor or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what all the hulabaloo about ages was<br/>
related to!! Karate&#39;. Who knew? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861706496">Hi Julie,<br/>
I realize you may have resolved this but I wanted to tell you about my<br/>
son&#39;s karate class. <br/>
There is one instructor for a small class, about twenty students.  The<br/>
students range in age from 6 to 52.  ( no age requirements )  Usually one<br/>
or two of the higher ranking students help, either leading the exercise<br/>
while the instructor gives someone personal attention, or giving that<br/>
personal attention themselves. ( Highest rank is green belt )  There are<br/>
some times when the little kids would rather roll around on the floor and<br/>
the instructor just over looks it.  He tries to grab their attention, but<br/>
if he can&#39;t,  he just reminds them to be quiet if they become disruptive.<br/>
 Typically one of the other students will engage the little ones in some<br/>
activity (often another beginner, but older ) <br/>
like practicing counting in Japanese, or break falls or something and<br/>
after a little while they&#39;re usually interested in joining the class<br/>
again.  Everyone just sort of understands this is how it is, and the<br/>
older people really love these little kids.  <br/>
Kids who really aren&#39;t interested in being there don&#39;t last that long,<br/>
parents tend to catch on that their kids could be rolling around at home<br/>
for free.  <br/>
You said your style is hard and you are faithful to it, so maybe this<br/>
approach wouldn&#39;t work for you.  It may sound like this isn&#39;t a very<br/>
disciplined class, but really it is.  There is just a kind of freedom<br/>
within it for students to help each other.  <br/>
I personally think this works beautifully.  Older students who are<br/>
struggling with some new technique can look at the little kids having fun<br/>
and say,  &quot;Ok,  I don&#39;t need to stress about this, if he/she can do it so<br/>
can I.&quot;   And little kids can see an adult struggling with the same thing<br/>
and realize it&#39;s hard for everyone, not just kids, and it builds<br/>
confidence.<br/>
An added bonus is everyone really loves this teacher and he gets lots of<br/>
birthday and Christmas presents.  = )    (I know you&#39;re not trying to win<br/>
a popularity contest, just my lame attempt at humor)<br/>
Maybe with your students, class size or style this wouldn&#39;t work, but it<br/>
works here and everyone seems to be happy with it.  <br/>
I think it&#39;s wonderful that you share what you know and love with these<br/>
kids. I can&#39;t tell you how much it means to us that we found a class in<br/>
our little town, someone willing to give their knowledge and time to the<br/>
kids here.  <br/>
