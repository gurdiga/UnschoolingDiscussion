<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054858938"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Just in passing I don&#39;t even consider the idea of &quot;subjects&quot; as belonging<br/>
&gt;even deep in my consciousness, but rather actively purge it with the<br/>
&gt;opposing concept of connections and gestalt learning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly why we never joined a charter, no matter how many perks it <br/>
paid for.  And I&#39;ve watched friends in charters have those perks grow less <br/>
and less each year as the state (I&#39;m in CA too) cracks down on <br/>
charters.  More and more testing is required too.  But the big issue for me <br/>
was what it would do to my mind and how I would look at what my kids are <br/>
doing.  I like thinking about where they are and where they might go with <br/>
whatever they&#39;re doing, not what little subject box I could stick this <br/>
activity in.<br/>
