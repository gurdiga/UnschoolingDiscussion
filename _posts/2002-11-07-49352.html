<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127898152">We consider ourselves Christian but most Christians wouldn&#39;t  (Dd has a<br/>
Bible and a book of spells, go figure).  We celebrate Christmas but we also<br/>
celebrate Winter Solstice.  We spend an afternoon walking around wooded<br/>
areas looking for just the right log and then decorate it with berries,<br/>
leaves, grasses, etc..  On Winter Solstice, we don&#39;t use any lights.  As<br/>
evening comes, the house gets darker and darker.  I have usually made some<br/>
kind of comfort  food dinner.  Then we burn the Yule log and all sit around<br/>
the fireplace, talking and laughing.  It is so calming.  We have done this<br/>
for several years and the kids really look forward to it.<br/>
