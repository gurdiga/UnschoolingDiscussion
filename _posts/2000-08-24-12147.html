<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411201505">Hi all, I&#39;m relatively new to the list and I am only in the information <br/>
gathering stages about homeschooling.  I&#39;ve been getting books from the <br/>
library to better educate myself on the subject of homeschooling.  If anyone <br/>
has a MUST READ book, I would love to hear what it is.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I took the book I was currently reading with me to the dentist and you <br/>
can&#39;t (well, you probably can) believe the criticism I got and the comments.  <br/>
&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have a teaching degree?&quot;  &quot;I could never take on the <br/>
challenge&quot;, etc., etc.  Anyway, I congratulate all of you for doing the work <br/>
you are doing and sticking with it -- I sense it is going to be yet another <br/>
battle of wills within my family and around my circle of friends (many of <br/>
whom are teachers -- great!).<br/>
<br/>
One question I have does not relate directly to homeschooling but will <br/>
probably make or break my decision -- how do you deal with behavior issues?  <br/>
I&#39;m talking about your day to day tantrums and non responsive behavior?  My <br/>
dd is 3yo and my ds is only 7mo but I feel like I&#39;m on a roller coaster with <br/>
my daughter&#39;s behavior and not sure how to deal with all the conflicts.  I <br/>
have read many books but nothing seems to click for her (or me).  I do NOT <br/>
believe in any type of physical correction (hitting, smacking, flicking, <br/>
etc.).  If anyone has suggestions on books to read or websites, or lists, <br/>
please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly (I think!) I was very interested in the posts about the reading, <br/>
spelling, etc.  My dd always wants to know what letters start which words and <br/>
will constantly aske me &quot;what does ________ start with?&quot;  She too wants to <br/>
learn how to write the letters and I&#39;m not sure if there is a specific format <br/>
or method that I should look into about making sure I teach her how to <br/>
correctly write the letters (or is this even necessary).  I find myself <br/>
writing the letters and then wondering if I&#39;m doing it right!!  Also, she is <br/>
the ONLY person in my whole family that is left handed but she has no problem <br/>
following my hand when she watches me write the letters -- I thought that was <br/>
sooo neat!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, thanks for allowing me to be a part of this list -- I THOROUGHLY enjoy <br/>
the insight and information regarding homeshcooling in general and <br/>
unschooling specifically.<br/>

as difficult as they think it is. You can do in 15 min at home what <br/>
it takes the ps to do in an hour. Besides, 5, 6, 7, etc...year olds<br/>
need to be outside exploring and playing and learning in Mother <br/>
Natures class room more than the class room of the govn&#39;t. I don&#39;t <br/>
always word it quite that way but that is the basic jist of it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a 5.5yob and 3.5yog. Neither of them really spoke until they <br/>
were right around 3. What I mean is that they didn&#39;t speak anything <br/>
anyone other than me understood. At 3 and even at 4 and after they <br/>
have their language skills they don&#39;t understand how to verbalize <br/>
their feelings. Tantrums are the only way they know how to express <br/>
their feelings. What I did was to let them have their tantrums when <br/>
and where they were untill they began to gain strong verbal skills.<br/>
(what I mean by strong verbal skills is that they can be easily <br/>
understood by those who are not around them on a daily basis.) Then <br/>
when they can be more easily understood I still permit them to have <br/>
their tantrums but not in public and at home they have to go to their <br/>
bedrooms till they are finished. I always make sure that when I send <br/>
them to their rooms for a tantrum that I use a calm voice so they <br/>
don&#39;t feel that they are in trouble. I also explain to them that they <br/>
are more than welcome to express their feelings in this way in the <br/>
privacy of their room. I also talk to them about their feelings and <br/>
give names to them and tell them that it is okay to tell me how they <br/>
feel. I also begin putting rules on their tantrums like you&#39;re not <br/>
allowed to kick, hit or throw anything other than your own <br/>
posessions, this does not include furniture or toys shared by other <br/>
siblings, and the floor. This has seemed to work out well. My 3.5yog <br/>
will be 4 in Dec. Her tantrums are far and few between. My 5.5yob <br/>
still has one once in a while. He did today which surprised me and I <br/>
told him he had to stop or go to his room and that he was too old to <br/>
act that way. If there was a problem we could discuss it, but he was <br/>
not allowed to have a fit about it. It wasn&#39;t even a tantrum in the <br/>
traditional sense but more of him whining and yelling and carying on <br/>
because he didn&#39;t get what he wanted.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> My ds is into words that rhyme (did I spell that right) He will pipe <br/>
up out of the blue and say two words then state that they rhyme. <br/>
Sometimes he is correct sometime close and sometimes completely off. <br/>
He loves to do this. Ya know I just thought of a rhyming game to play <br/>
with him. I will have to try it next week. (They are going out of <br/>
town for the weekend.) I wouldn&#39;t worry about your technique of <br/>
showing her how to write her letters. If she is learning to write the <br/>
letters and is content with her own progress you are doing a great <br/>
job. I used to feel this also but I would think that because ds <br/>
wasn&#39;t doing it yet that I wasn&#39;t doing a good job. I have been <br/>
excited for him to start writing and learn his numbers so we can move <br/>
on to more advanced games. I get bored with such simple games over <br/>
and over and over.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just have to say as a lefthanded person that it is very important <br/>
to cater to her left hand. I will be 32 this year and still have a <br/>
problem telling the difference when I am looking at other people. To <br/>
me I see them as a mirror image, their rightside to me is the left. <br/>
It has been the past few months that I have finally been able to see <br/>
their right side as their right side without thinking so hard about <br/>
it. It was interesting the other night I was talking to my mil, the <br/>
ps educator who supports hsing, and she was talking to me about the <br/>
midline and how important it is. I told her this about myself and she <br/>
said that someone at some point must have tried to force me to use my <br/>
right hand. I relayed a story to her that I still remember as if it <br/>
were yesterday about when I was a child learning to cut. We lived in <br/>
Connecticut at the time and I was no more than 4yo. It took me <br/>
forever to learn how to work the scissors because they were right <br/>
handed. My mom couldn&#39;t find any lefthanded scissors till we moved to <br/>
Texas when I was nearly 5. I have never forgotten the frustration I <br/>
felt when she came home with these lefthanded scissors and I couldn&#39;t <br/>
make them work because I had learned to cut with my right hand. The <br/>
only other time someone tried to force me to do something in a <br/>
righthanded manner was in 3rd grade when my teacher tried to make me <br/>
write with my paper straight up and down. This does not work with a <br/>
lefty because you can&#39;t see what you are writing. Also whenever I do <br/>
something for the first time I have to figure out which hand to use. <br/>
In high school I took Cosmetology. It took me about a week to figure <br/>
out which hand to hold the scissors with and which hand to hold the <br/>
comb with. It was confusing because I wanted to hold them both with <br/>
the same hand wether it was the left or the right. I even made the <br/>
decission to cut with my left hand but gave it up bacause the <br/>
instructor showed me everything righthanded. Anyway, can you tell <br/>
that I still have some frustration over the whole thing. I don&#39;t <br/>
usually make a big deal about it but sometimes I wish that I had been <br/>
cattered to more as a lefty. Now about all I do lefthanded is use the <br/>
mouse and write. Fortunately, dh doesn&#39;t have time to use the comp <br/>
but when he did he would have a fit when I would switch the buttons <br/>
on the mouse so they worked for my left hand. I got tired of <br/>
switching them and started using my right hand for the mouse or I <br/>
would use my lefthand and had to remember not to use my index finger <br/>
to click with.<br/>
