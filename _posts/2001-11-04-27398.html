<br/>
Nuttier than a bag of nuts at a nut festival, Michael Franks (a member of<br/>
the Texas Republican Executive Committee) earns a spot on the list this week<br/>
with his interesting take on the evils of. um, school textbooks. Apparently<br/>
the conservative group &quot;Texas Citizens for a Sound Economy&quot; have got a beef<br/>
with the Texas State Board of Education over some ideas about global warming<br/>
and acid rain which have cropped up in new middle-school science textbooks.<br/>
Yes, it would seem that those evil scientists will stop at nothing to<br/>
indoctrinate our kids with environmentalist whacko thinking. And horror of<br/>
horrors, they even found a teacher&#39;s guide which suggests that students<br/>
write to their congressional representatives about environmental issues, if<br/>
you can believe that. At a recent hearing, one of the speakers ranted,<br/>
&quot;These kids are not qualified to advise on national energy policy or to<br/>
write their congressman, for God&#39;s sake.&quot; Yes, allowing kids to think that<br/>
their representative should actually represent them could be a surefire<br/>
disaster for this country&#39;s future. So how does Michael Franks fit into all<br/>
this? Well, he thinks that the books should be gotten rid of. And how?<br/>
Franks said, &quot;I think we&#39;ve found the alternative fuel source that everyone<br/>
is looking for and that is burning these.&quot; Mr. Franks, Hitler would be<br/>
proud.</div>

<br/>
I think Texas is one of the states where the state board of education<br/>
chooses the textbooks for the whole state so someone who can convince those<br/>
doing the choosing can influence a whole humongous state -- and the thinking<br/>
of a whole passle of future voters.<br/>
<br/>
Environmentalism is a hot point with conservatives since conservatives are<br/>
generally for strong local government and minimal national government. And<br/>
environmental policies are generally a national government issue. So more<br/>
environmentalism means more national control.<br/>
<br/>
As for the kids not being qualified, he has a point. Are the kids being<br/>
presented with opposing viewpoints on environmental issues so they can<br/>
decide for themselves or are they being fed a single viewpoint?<br/>
<br/>
To someone who feels environmentalism is too obvious to be questioned,<br/>
presenting kids with the causes of acid rain and the effects of acid rain<br/>
would seem to be giving them a complete picture. (Of course, since schools<br/>
divide information into neat compartments, it *is* a complete *science*<br/>
picture. Since it&#39;s a science class they can&#39;t discuss the economic or<br/>
political aspects of the issue. Those must be confined to separate classes.)<br/>
<br/>
But if the kids were being presented with an obvious conservative point in<br/>
government class, such as gun ownership is a constitutionally mandated right<br/>
clearly stated in the second amendment, and it was suggested they all write<br/>
to their congressional representative about preserving that right, I suspect<br/>
liberals would find it appalling. It would look like mind control. It would<br/>
look like a state trying to mold an entire generation of future voters<br/>
towards a single viewpoint. It wouldn&#39;t look at all like kids asking their<br/>
congressional representative to represent them. It would look like someone<br/>
getting all the kids in the state to follow a single political agenda. It<br/>
would look really really scary.<br/>
<br/>
But anytime kids are fed a single viewpoint it&#39;s scary. Unfortunately<br/>
schools weren&#39;t designed to offer information with more than one view point.<br/>
How many viewpoints can their be to 5+12 and here&#39;s how to spell &quot;cat&quot;? They<br/>
weren&#39;t designed to teach kids how to think, how to weigh issues, how to<br/>
come to their own conclusions. The were designed to give kids a basic<br/>
framework of practical math, reading, writing, some history.<br/>
<br/>
The information schools impart has expanded well beyond that, but the &quot;just<br/>
memorize the facts&quot; approach and mentality hasn&#39;t changed.<br/>
<br/>
And I bet you were expecting a slew of &quot;Boy, I agree with you, what a nut<br/>
case!&quot; ;-)<br/>

weren&#39;t designed to teach kids how to think, how to weigh issues, how to<br/>
come to their own conclusions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have sometimes thought my own school experience might have been freakishly <br/>
good, but we WERE taught more than one viewpoint.  We were told not everyone <br/>
believes in evolution, and that not even all scientists consider it <br/>
scientifically proven, so it&#39;s an ongoing investigation.  In math we were <br/>
doing &quot;twelve&quot; in all its permutations, above and below.  (20-8, 8+4...)  And <br/>
several of my teachers, but 7th grade math especially, went into other number <br/>
systems and said base 10 was fairly arbitrary, except for people&#39;s fingers, <br/>
but that base 12 was all around us too, in dozens and grosses and geometrical <br/>
60&#39;s and 180&#39;s.  And we used to goof with base 2, binary.  (I was pretty <br/>
grumpy when I got put out of the 6th grade regional spelling bee for spelling <br/>
&quot;woolly&quot; the Brit way, which was the way it was on my &quot;Animal Rummy&quot; deck of <br/>
cards.)<br/>
<br/>
I do understand the objection, though--both Joyce&#39;s and the Texas dad&#39;s.  <br/>
Baptist families invest a lot in telling their kids what simply IS and they <br/>
don&#39;t want to have to fight over homework and teachers&#39; assignements and <br/>
textbooks which tell other ways.  <br/>
<br/>
I read in an old Utne reader the other day about a letter that some <br/>
environmentalists (Ralph Nader&#39;s name was on it, I think, for name <br/>
recognition) which had gone (some years back) to thousands of churches <br/>
offering them information on ecology in hopes that they would become more <br/>
involved and teach the kids in their churches about it.  It was designed to <br/>
support ecology with Biblical teachings.  They mentioned the creation and <br/>
naming the creatures, and they mentioned Noah&#39;s Ark.   They were proud of the <br/>
high number of positive responses, in the form of requests for the full info <br/>
packet.<br/>
<br/>
I know the Baptist point of view on those.  For one thing they would want <br/>
NOTHING of liberal, non-Baptist interpretation of any Biblical texts.  And <br/>
both those stories are used to teach man&#39;s supremecy over animals.  Animals <br/>
are NOT respected on the same level with humans.  Man is in God&#39;s image; <br/>
animals are for man to use (God told Adam).  And the point of the flood was <br/>
that Noah&#39;s family would re-people the earth and use the animals God had <br/>
arranged for them to save, and never would God destroy the world by water <br/>
again which is the promise of the rainbow.   When Jesus comes again and the <br/>
world is destroyed, it will be by fire.<br/>
<br/>
So the conclusion of all that is that to care about the physical state of the <br/>
world shows a lack of faith in God.  It&#39;s God&#39;s world, God is all-powerful <br/>
and his will prevails.  It is the job of people (i.e. Baptists and other <br/>
right-thinking people) to bring more souls to Jesus in preparation for the <br/>
time that Jesus will take them straight to heaven.   This planet is temporary <br/>
and expendable, and animals aren&#39;t going to heaven.<br/>
<br/>
To spend time and money on the &quot;theory&quot; that the world is old and will be <br/>
here after we&#39;re going is tantamount to blasphemy.<br/>
<br/>
For the benefit of people new to this list, I don&#39;t personally believe this, <br/>
but I have relatives who do, and Texas is a BIG place with lots of people, <br/>
maybe half or more of whom feel that way.<br/>

textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is fed deliberately limited information, even if they ask the<br/>
right questions, they&#39;re going to get a limited answer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some may not like it, but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; certainly not the best argument for not taking children seriously.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I take even more seriously is the concept that school is the place to<br/>
be fed the information one needs to know. (Obviously not a widely held<br/>
concept here! ;-) But we&#39;re discussing schooled kids and public school<br/>
parents.) Parents -- and probably a lot of educators too -- treat school as<br/>
if that were true. Kids come to believe it.<br/>
<br/>
I respect whatever opinion children come up with. They often (though by no<br/>
means always) are operating on limited information that has wandered into<br/>
their lives by chance. (Adults do too!) Just because an opinion is based on<br/>
limited information doesn&#39;t mean the thought that went into arriving at it<br/>
is to be denigrated.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s a different thing when that information is *deliberately* limited<br/>
by someone with special interests and presented as though it were complete.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, I think it&#39;s a positive thing for the kids to be encouraged to<br/>
write their congressional representative. From their point of view they have<br/>
looked fully at the issue, thought about it and come up with an opinion on<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
From an objective point of view, the process of feeding kids a limited body<br/>
of information from *any* special interest view point, leading them to a<br/>
predetermined conclusion and then encouraging them to write based on that is<br/>
a power that could be exploited. *That&#39;s* what this guy is seeing.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, as Sandra pointed out, he&#39;s also seeing a point of view presented<br/>
to the kids that is counter to and undermines his own so he&#39;s not objecting<br/>
on purely philosophical grounds as I&#39;m trying to do ;-) But I think if we<br/>
perceive those we disagree with as operating purely from a selfish position<br/>
(and we, of course, are purely objective and seeing both sides) then we are<br/>
destined to misunderstand and underestimate them. We will see them as myopic<br/>
and ignorant of the real issues. (Though that is true of many people on both<br/>
sides of any issue!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would it really be so incredibly horrible if we all remembered we are not<br/>

&gt; planet?  The other view point being, if we can all make a little money,<br/>
&gt; we have the right to do anything?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I&#39;m not defending or opposing either the liberal or conservative<br/>
view on the environment. I am defending being upset because someone<br/>
perceives that there is a single point of view being fed to all the children<br/>
in the state.<br/>
<br/>
Of course *his* solution isn&#39;t to give the kids more points of view but to<br/>
eliminate the idea he disagrees with which would allow the prevailing<br/>
attitude in Texas to continue.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think kids do. I also think lots of kids eventually learn not to. It isn&#39;t<br/>
cool to show interest. Too many instances of questions set aside (We&#39;ll get<br/>
to that later, We can talk about that after class if you like, I meant<br/>
questions about the topic, There&#39;s some really good books in the library if<br/>
you want to persue that further and so on.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who realizes that process and can gain access to the power to control<br/>
it, can exploit it for their own interests. Having one group of people<br/>
decide what all the kids in the state (and I think it&#39;s also true in<br/>
California?) will learn is an incredible power. From a liberal point of<br/>
view, having the kids learn about acid rain is giving them the complete<br/>
picture. From a conservative point of view it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And you may be assuming a science teacher wouldn&#39;t say,  &quot; why, do you<br/>
&gt; think &quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think lots of teachers would love to do this. I also think that time<br/>
pressures to get through a set amount of material in a limited period of<br/>
time don&#39;t allow them the time for questions that could pull the focus off<br/>
topic.<br/>
<br/>
In an ideal world, schools would be places of exchanging ideas, where<br/>
teachers and students could talk about anything from all points of view, go<br/>
in any direction that fired their imaginations. But schools are assembly<br/>
lines. They&#39;re designed to get kids from point A to point Z. If point F is<br/>
more of a fuzzy area it still needs treated as a point.<br/>
<br/>
And that design allows anyone with the power to decide what gets taught to<br/>
have their viewpoint as just another point to pass through.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a good example of fuzzy areas being treated as points is science<br/>
treated as mechanical processes, causes and effects. Vinegar + baking soda<br/>
yield carbon dioxide. It&#39;s treated abstractly like math problems. If you do<br/>
this, that happens. But real science *does* impact life in numerous ways.<br/>
It&#39;s perhaps a trivial example but every time the experiment is done, the<br/>
CO2 level rises, the processes that brought the vinegar and baking soda to<br/>
your kitchen have impacted the environment and economy in a variety of ways,<br/>
and the end result needs disposed of and will impact the environment. If we<br/>
had to think about all that everytime we did anything, we&#39;d never get<br/>
anything done, of course ;-) But because that *type* of global thinking,<br/>
less trivial of course ;-) isn&#39;t integrated into the teaching of science, it<br/>
isn&#39;t a part of the thinking of science.<br/>
<br/>
Science isn&#39;t just about finding solutions to problems that exist. The<br/>
results and practice of science itself have impacts. The thinking about what<br/>
the impact is isn&#39;t integrated into sciecne teaching. If it gets discussed,<br/>
it&#39;s a separate course in college. And if it&#39;s separate in teaching, it<br/>
won&#39;t get integrated in practice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It happens all the time.  Kids here have been taking hunter safety<br/>
&gt; courses, which teach them about the constitutionality of owning guns.<br/>
&gt; The timber industry has &quot; forest stewardship&quot;   classes at the schools, a<br/>
&gt; whole weeks worth,  where they show videos of the wonderful things the<br/>
&gt; timber industry does for the world.  The cattleman&#39;s associations has<br/>
&gt; their turn,  they get two days a year to convince little kids killing<br/>
&gt; stuff is their great American right, and their duty to the world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those are all special interest groups and it&#39;s a useful skill for kids to be<br/>
able to perceive the bias behind the information.<br/>
<br/>
Which is the point. Schools are *percieved* as places where the information<br/>
being fed to kids is unbiased. I think the overall prevailing atmosphere for<br/>
the kids learning is that they don&#39;t need to question what they&#39;re being<br/>
told. I think what schools provide is a rough structure of what there is to<br/>
know but it gets perceived as the full picture. Not because kids are too<br/>
dumb, but because of the atmosphere of &quot;do what we tell you to do and we&#39;ll<br/>
get you where you need to go&quot; that kids (and parents) absorb that message.<br/>
<br/>
You can tell kids numerous times they should question everything but if the<br/>
whole atmosphere is structured otherwise, actions do speak louder than<br/>
words.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s also possible that since you&#39;re drawn to fuzzier stuff, as literature<br/>
is generally presented, and I&#39;m drawn to &quot;right answer&quot; stuff, as math and<br/>
science is generally presented, then perhaps the things from school that<br/>
made the most impression on each of us is what matched what we were looking<br/>
for. I do remember those types of things being presented, but my impression<br/>
of how they were presented is more process oriented: do this, this always<br/>
happens. Did the fuzzier kid sitting in the same room come away with a<br/>
totally different impression? It would be interesting to know!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I read in an old Utne reader the other day about a letter that some<br/>
&gt; environmentalists (Ralph Nader&#39;s name was on it, I think, for name<br/>
&gt; recognition) which had gone (some years back) to thousands of churches<br/>
&gt; offering them information on ecology in hopes that they would become more<br/>
&gt; involved and teach the kids in their churches about it.  It was designed to<br/>
&gt; support ecology with Biblical teachings.  They mentioned the creation and<br/>
&gt; naming the creatures, and they mentioned Noah&#39;s Ark.   They were proud of the<br/>
&gt; high number of positive responses, in the form of requests for the full info<br/>
&gt; packet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a Green Christian (fundamentalist) movement I&#39;ve stumbled across<br/>
every once in a while. Christian environmentalism on Google turns up some<br/>
pro information. So environmentalism isn&#39;t just for pagan tree huggers<br/>
anymore :-)<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes the teacher doesn&#39;t know the answer, or it&#39;s too complicated, or <br/>
the other kids wouldn&#39;t be interested in it and so &quot;classroom order&quot; would be <br/>
disrupted.<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty stubborn  myself, but I remember lots of &quot;why?&quot;  or &quot;How do they <br/>
know this?&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s this good for?&quot; questions being answered with &quot;That <br/>
won&#39;t be on the test,&quot; and &quot;you&#39;ll cover that next year&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s just how <br/>
it is.&quot;  If I were on the edge of discouragement, that could have taught me <br/>
not to ask.  <br/>
<br/>
And some families and schools have worse put-downs and insults for kids who <br/>
are &quot;smart-alecky&quot; enough to question simple plain truth.   It&#39;s talking <br/>
back, disobedience, disrespect, wasting the time of people more important <br/>
than they are, etc.  <br/>

Some kids learn not to be smart.<br/>
