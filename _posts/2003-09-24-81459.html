<div id="ygrps-yiv-616233487">Thanks for sharing your day Heidi!! Sounds like my kind of perfect day....Middle Earth feasts and all, how COOL.<br/>
<br/>
What cookbook did you use? I&#39;d like to try that one, it sounds really interesting. And your Haiku style poetry, really great words! Good visual for me.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you lived closer you creative soul you...<br/>
