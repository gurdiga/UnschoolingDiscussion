&gt;&gt;AND lots of those new in-development machines (unmanned <br/>
&gt;&gt;this&#39;n&#39;that--howitzers, spy planes) could be EASILY controlled by lots of <br/>
&gt;&gt;unschoolers I know if they would design the controllers to match an N64 <br/>
&gt;&gt;controller.  Or Gamecube.   Monkeyball could be military training in <br/>
&gt;&gt;disguise.   The aptitude tests could ask which game systems the recruit <br/>
&gt;&gt;was proficient in.&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, it has been noted by the military (Air Force in particular, I <br/>
think) that the recruits coming in since video games have an easier time <br/>
adjusting to the technology. They have no problem mastering flight <br/>
simulators and subsequently real control systems. High tech weapons don&#39;t <br/>
scare them (well learning the controls at least). And the idea of working <br/>
several systems at once or wearing goggles with a small screen in them comes <br/>
easily.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that&#39;s not what Conor is preparing for. :-/<br/>
