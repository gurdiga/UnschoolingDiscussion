<div id="ygrps-yiv-754622817">hi,<br/>
<br/>
Do you like this mag?  More info please!  Is there a website?<br/>
<br/>
yes!  it&#39;s right up my alley.  though philosophically my natural<br/>
inclination is unschooling i like this mag because it covers main<br/>
different angles of learning (hence the name:)<br/>
<br/>
you can get a free sample copy (which has the holt article among other<br/>
very interesting ones) @ <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.great-ideas.org/paths.htm">http://www.great-ideas.org/paths.htm</a>  it covers<br/>
lots of fascinating topics: free schools, democratic education,<br/>
&quot;not-learning&quot;, zen buddhism, an article by a 15 year old unschooled<br/>
girl, another one by a rabbi, etc.  this is all from their free sample<br/>
issue.  we subscribed but have not yet received the next issue,  though<br/>
this one is really packed with lots fodder for good discussions.  i<br/>
highly recommend,  at the very least, to sign up for their sample<br/>
issue.  if you do and want to discuss anything covered in it i would be<br/>
happy to participate:)<br/>
