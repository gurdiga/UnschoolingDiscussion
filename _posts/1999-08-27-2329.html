 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really really big on the idea of apprenticeship or mentoring.  <br/>
Apprenticeship used to be big in this country too.  Does anyone know the <br/>
history of why that changed?  Maybe the industrial revolution?  And does <br/>
anyone know of any kind of fledgling apprentice movement (I&#39;ve talked to many <br/>
other people who also like the idea) or apprentice opportunities or a book on <br/>
same?<br/>
