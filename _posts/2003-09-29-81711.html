&lt;&lt; You have a tattoo of a rooster?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my prior experience, a person with such a tattoo is building up to saying <br/>
&quot;Do you want to see my cock?&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a guy at a bar one night ask whether I wanted to see his carpet....<br/>

Did he want you to go home with him or is this a tattoo joke too <br/>
sophisticated for me?  <br/>
Did he have a really nice toupee?<br/>
Hairy back?</div>

Sandra you are so funny. ;o) BTW Kelly, it was probably the same guy who once <br/>
told me he had a beautiful ceiling, and would I like to see it. <br/>
