<div id="ygrps-yiv-209823631">Hi,<br/>
  What a difference a little preparation makes.  I witnessed this Monday <br/>
night at Toys R Us:  One mother, alone in an aisle, lets out a whistle.  <br/>
Immediately she recieves an answering whistle from nearby.  I thought that <br/>
was very cool.  Sometime later, I&#39;m checking out a woman who looks around and <br/>
can&#39;t find her son.  She begins running around frantically, sends her younger <br/>
son to help look for the older one, I make an announcement, the cop gets <br/>
involved, dad comes in and helps look, finally the boy arrives at the <br/>
register, with mom scolding and asking the policeman to advise junior on the <br/>
dangers of not staying with mom.<br/>
  As for me personally, I&#39;d have the young child(ren) stay in a cart if I had <br/>
shopping to do.  I usually pick up something (or bring a favorite) to keep my <br/>
son occupied while I shop.  If he&#39;s getting antsy, I may need to cut the trip <br/>
short.  Other times are for leisurely shopping, and my son can look all he <br/>
wants.  Sometimes the trip is expressly so he can  stay and play with the <br/>
Thomas the train toys.  I let him know in advance which kind of trip it&#39;s <br/>
going to be.<br/>

my mouth (think Ellie Mae on Beverly Hillbillies, but one-handed, and <br/>
louder).  It&#39;s the signal I use to attract attention from my husband and <br/>
children if we are separated in a store or the fair or wherever.  They don&#39;t <br/>
whistle back, because I don&#39;t whistle unless I have them in sight.  But they <br/>
always turn toward the sound and pick me out of the crowd, though.  :)<br/>
