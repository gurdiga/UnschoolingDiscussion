<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068935935">We get Mathmania,  also by highlites,  my 9 yo LOVES this!!  We&#39;ve received<br/>
it since she was about 7.5.  I love it also... :-)<br/>
    Spider is another  *FAVE* at our house - it&#39;s literary;  but I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed they&#39;re starting a new line of magazines for science and<br/>
history....thinking the sci one may have some math/logic stuff.<br/>

&gt; heard of this as a subscription, and if so, do you have any links or a ph#<br/>
&gt; where I can get more info?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or do you have any other magazine suggestions for a 7yo boy?<br/>
