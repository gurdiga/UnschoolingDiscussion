<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333643363">I know I have written before on food, but this is a different story.  Background: My children (now 6 and almost 8) have been allowed to choose what they want to eat since they started eating solid food.  <br/>
<br/>
This story was relayed to me from my husband and children. About 1 year ago three siblings of a student of mine went to play with my children during a lesson. (these kids were about 9, 6 and 4). In the playroom the children found one of those M&M containers that have a little character and a fan on them.  I have no idea how long that had been sitting there, as although my children like M&Ms they had asked for this because of the little character and fan.  <br/>
<br/>
One of visiting children opened the tube and M&Ms went all over the floor.  My children stood there as the three children (who I found out later were not allowed candy) dove on the floor and began eating the M&Ms as fast as they could. <br/>
<br/>
A very similar scenario happened as well a few weeks agodifferent location and food, but similar. <br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a discussion on what kinds of food can be considered nutritious or not.  It is about the freedom of being able to choose what we put in our own bodies.  Children may not understand that a green cupcake is not as nutritious as a green vegetable, but by limiting the green cupcake we have made it more desirable than the vegetable. <br/>
<br/>
Coming from someone who had strict limitations on everything growing up, I feel good that my children already at this age do not have to grow up fighting food, or anything else because they are already more in control than I am at 41. <br/>

The last time I sent this link to someone on the side, she wrote (within seconds) and asked why I was sending it, because we weren&#39;t talking about TV.<br/>

Dear every single person:  Kneejerk defenses are inappropriate on this list.  At least *PRETEND* to take the time to think before responding.  There is no possible way to read a little, try a little, wait a while and watch when the &quot;Yeah, but&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t agree&quot; response comes in less time that it would have taken to read the page.<br/>

Had I not let those pro-limits, defend-the-term-&quot;junk&quot; posts through, the authors would have thought I was afraid, and they were right.  There is benefit in others reading the exchange, even if the authors can&#39;t reconsider their positions.  <br/>
<br/>
But Rachael (quoted above about cupcakes and vegetables) is right.  And Pam Sorooshian (who teaches economics and has unschooled for 20 years) is right.  And anyone who wants to think &quot;No, they are WRONG&quot; without reading what Pam wrote is insufficiently interested in learning about unschooling to remain in the discussion.<br/>

&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear every single person: Kneejerk defenses are inappropriate on<br/>

&gt; There is no possible way to read a little, try a little, wait a while and<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; As the person whose use of the term &quot;junk food&quot; spurred the last thread<br/>
&gt; about food and food choices.  I wanted to say that I initially didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; respond because to Sandra because she was right and sending an apology to<br/>
&gt; the list or even a clarification wouldn&#39;t have served the discussion of<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  I did not feel a need to &#39;prove&#39; that I understood or that I<br/>
&gt; agreed and so I left things the way they were.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that the thrust that my unschooled kid was making choices based on<br/>
her own desires and evaluations and not a parental dictum was useful and<br/>
Sandra&#39;s correction clarified my poor choice of term.  I should have said<br/>
&quot;less nutritious&quot; or &quot;sugary&quot; or &quot;corn syrup laden&quot;; all of which would<br/>
have been more clear, less dismissive and less emotionally charged than<br/>
&quot;junk&quot;.  I should have known better and I do apologize to Sandra and the<br/>
list for the lack of clarity and so potential to be less helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I do try to read and think before responding.  To examine my response to<br/>
posts is what actually brings value to me from this list.  This examination<br/>
makes me think about principles and unschooling in life with my family.<br/>
 Sandra provides a forum for ideas to be presented, discussed, and<br/>
clarified.  She isn&#39;t hitting us in the head and forcing us to use these<br/>
ideas, she is just giving us really &quot;nutritionally dense&quot; food for thought.<br/>
 :)<br/>
<br/>
For this I give a hearty &quot;Thank You!&quot;<br/>

You made me laugh, and that made me cough, and I&#39;m old. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe something I ate today increased phlegm and that made me cough, and old people could cough and die.  I was at a Chinese restaurant.  It was probably MSG.   [I&#39;m joking; people cough for all kinds of reasons.  I&#39;m old, though, and that did make me laugh.]<br/>
<br/>
Today in a side conversation someone in India mentioned letting her little girl have ice cream even though the little girl had a cold, and people there believe that milk products can cause or exacerbate colds.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote:  <br/>
___________<br/>
People here, too, say milk causes phlegm, but why would it? They also used to tell pregnant women (even as lately as the 1970&#39;s) that they &quot;HAD&quot; to drink milk so they could make milk.<br/>
<br/>
It seems any sort of bodily mucus was made of milk, in someone&#39;s mind, somewhere back there.<br/>
<br/>
We can both blame England and set it all aside maybe (whether it&#39;s fair or true or not; just this one time I think we should be irrational).<br/>
