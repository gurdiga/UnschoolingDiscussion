<div id="ygrps-yiv-38396573">The only thing I know for sure about Montessori, is that she was a woman<br/>
who helped (learning-disabled?) children make wonderful progress.  Every<br/>
&quot;Montessori&quot; school will be different, based on what they think is<br/>
important about M&#39;s work.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a neighbor whose son attended a &quot;good&quot; local M preschool.  She<br/>
thought it was good that the school made sure that the kids knew when<br/>
something that were being told was fantasy.  Her 5 year old had a huge<br/>
argument one day with mine, because mine was playing a magic game and<br/>
said magic was real.  He was insistent that magic isn&#39;t real and was<br/>
really getting mad about it.  He is a very analytical boy anyway, and<br/>
maybe it had nothing to do with the school&#39;s policy on &quot;realness&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I took my oldest dd to a cooperative preschool.  What I liked was that<br/>
the kids were allowed to choose their own activities for all but the<br/>
first few minutes, last few minutes, and snack time.  (Now I would even<br/>
see that part different - why should a kid HAVE to participate in snack<br/>
time?  Oh, I just remembered why.  Because before snack time, everyone<br/>
helped pick up so we didn&#39;t want anyone getting toys back out then. <br/>
Anyway...)  But in between the child could do ALL art or NO art or any<br/>
other variation of the activities that there were to choose from.  Also,<br/>
all the parents were allowed to stay and the parents took turns as<br/>
classroom aids, so there was a high adult/child ratio.<br/>
<br/>
Once I had a second child, getting one to preschool seemed like too much<br/>
effort for me!  Then I started learning about homeschooling, then<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
