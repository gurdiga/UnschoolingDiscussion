<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I had a twinge of that lately, being the end of the year with graduations <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; such.  I got back to the idea of how absolutely ridiculous it is that we <br/>
&gt; require and expect schools to  &quot;teach them everything they *might* ever need <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; know&quot; and then society blames the school for not making it happen, failing <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; understand that not only is that a useless expectation, but impossible as <br/>
&gt; well<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve also seen the usual onslaught of graduation announcements turning up in <br/>
my mail lately and wondered if there is any kind of ceremony that unschoolers <br/>
participate in to acknowledge any certain milestones.  I know that it would <br/>
not be grade related or probably not even learning related but maybe a special <br/>
18th birthday that&#39;s extra big or special?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just the usual beach week that they all go to? (around here anyway)<br/>
<br/>
I know the kids get lots of presents and lots of cash and encouraging words <br/>
and cards when they reach that &quot;milestone&quot; of high school graduation and if <br/>
your child had never been exposed to that, it&#39;s probably not a big deal at all.  <br/>
Those who&#39;ve had other children in school or homeschooled and attended those <br/>
graduation ceremonies what would you do, if anything for the unschooled child <br/>
to celebrate THEM and their journey through life?<br/>
<br/>
I realize it might just be buying into societies need to recognize and hold <br/>
their children out for the world to see how &quot;great they are&quot; but I also <br/>
recognize there is some tradition to this rite of passage as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never really even thought of it before now and was just wondering what <br/>
others thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-743190299">There is a person who does a historic graduation ceremony in Gettysburg here.  I&#39;m thinking we might do that if the kids want to.<br/>
<br/>
The parents give their own diplomas to their kids (if they want).  And everyone is dressed in historical garb I think too.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds original and unique, something that would be our style.<br/>

would imply moving out?<br/>
<br/>
My older girl had a HUGE sweet sixteen, practically like a wedding (and about <br/>
cost as much), the younger one is already making plans for hers (the boys had <br/>
parties too but not &quot;formal&quot; events, which was their choice).<br/>
<br/>
It was really a celebration of life and for each year someone lit a candle <br/>
and said something special about her and what happened during that particular <br/>
year of her life that they recalled.  So it was really nice.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m wondering (and I of course have a while to wonder) what would be <br/>
appropriate for the unschooled child?  A celebration of their years?  A big party <br/>
with a beach theme just because?  I know there are many options, I just <br/>
wondered if anyone had approached this situation in their lives or how they might be <br/>
planning to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely wouldn&#39;t want it to reflect anything seeming to mean it was time <br/>
to move out and on.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your responses.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On my 45th birthday, my daughter called to wish me happy birthday.  I forget<br/>
just why I said, &quot;I guess I&#39;m on my way somewhere.&quot;  My daughter answered,<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re halfway to 90.&quot;  So I was halfway to 90 all that year.  I loved it.<br/>
