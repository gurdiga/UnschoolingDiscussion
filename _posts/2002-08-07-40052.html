<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815877527">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to ask your opinion on my 13 yo son&#39;s swimming <br/>
class.  He is enrolled in Bronze Medallion, and isn&#39;t sure he wants to <br/>
continue with it.  He thought it would be more of a balance between swimming <br/>
and lifesaving than it is.  He is small for his age and probably the <br/>
youngest in the class, so is having difficulty with some of the carries.  <br/>
Also he&#39;s the only boy and is feeling pressure from the instructor (also <br/>
male) to be better than the &quot;girls&quot; (this is a totally foreign idea to my <br/>
family).<br/>
My problem is that I was raised with the idea that if you start a course of <br/>
some kind, you&#39;d better finish it (or else...!).  I&#39;m pretty new to the idea <br/>
of unschooling, and feel like if we&#39;re really unschooling, we should just <br/>
let him quit.  OTOH, we also have paid $115 for the class, and money is <br/>
pretty tight, so I&#39;m reluctant to see that money wasted.  I would like an <br/>
opinion (or two) of how I should handle this.  I forgot to mention that the <br/>
instructor told the class today that if the exam was today 2/5 would <br/>
probably fail. (and not long after the class was told that my son & the <br/>
smallest girl were doing &quot;ok&quot; and the others were doing &quot;excellent&quot; and <br/>
&quot;good&quot;).<br/>
So, have any of you had any experiences that you&#39;d like to share?  The class <br/>
is everyday this week, ending on Sat (Aug 10).<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Lesley<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078644527">Lesley, is it at Grant MacEwan?  We have had problems there too.  How much of the course has he already taken?  Enough that it is worth it to reschedule the remainder for another time?  Is he the only hs kid there?  We found that the courses as they stand are weighted far more heavily to so-called &quot;safety&quot; than actual stroke improvement.  We found it best to gather up two or three kids of similar swimming ability and have &quot;private lessons&quot;  (They will schedule &quot;private&quot; for as little as three kids at fairly reasonable rates).  You can even try to schedule your own hs bronze in the fall -- I know that Susan Mallandaine is looking for someone for her private, and I think Sarah is 12-ish, and passed all the aquaquest levels.  I am in a similar situation, and made my kids finish out the course, and now they are adamantly refusing to register for any more.  In hindsight, I would have given up more than a hundred dollars to have not biased them against swimming.  We are going to take an &quot;unswimming&quot; approach in the fall, and just go to the pool a couple of times a week until they feel the need to improve their strokes in a more formal way.  Just my humble and new-to-unschooling opinion.   Debi   You can email me privately if you like    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:debiwatson@...">debiwatson@...</a>   <br/>

If what you get for your money is the knowledge that he didn&#39;t want the class <br/>
that much, that&#39;s okay.  Disappointment and more free hours this week are a <br/>
better package for the money than disappointment and three more trips to the <br/>
pool where he&#39;ll be frustrated and maybe worse. <br/>
<br/>
I would say cut your losses.<br/>
<br/>
If you paid $100 for a bottle of something it turned out your kid was <br/>
allergic to, would you pour out the rest of the bottle when you discovered <br/>
it, or would you say &quot;Hey--we paid $100 for this--you drink it!&quot;  ? <br/>
<br/>
Depending on the situation and your personality and all, you *might* want to <br/>
talk to the administrator of the pool or program and say you&#39;d like to wait <br/>
until another season and another teacher, as this one isn&#39;t a good match for <br/>
your child.  Maybe they&#39;ll give you credit or partial credit.  Or you might <br/>
be in a small town where another teacher is not on the horizon.<br/>

I did something similar with my 13 year old daughter<br/>
and horseback riding lessons.  She has loved horses<br/>
since she was young and was taking lessons before we<br/>
moved with a free spirited teacher who really wanted<br/>
her to enjoy as well as learn. but no pressure.  When<br/>
we moved we signed her up with a woman who was very<br/>
stern and required written tests.  I  didn&#39;t find this<br/>
out until after we signed up and my daughter worried<br/>
more about the test than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
I made her finish up the lessons that I had paid for<br/>
and now she doesn&#39;t want anything to do with horseback<br/>
riding lessons. Her love of learning was totally<br/>
squashed when it came to horses.  I think maybe<br/>
somewhere along the way she will pick it back up.  But<br/>
killing that joy wasn&#39;t worth any money.<br/>

I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get many opinions on staying with/dropping out of things,<br/>
and finishing but not worrying about passing but just learning, etc.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have to say that the two statements above set off alarm bells in<br/>
my head.  First, your email is dated Tuesday night in my digest.  If that&#39;s<br/>
correct, your son has had this class for 2 days, and has 3-4 more.  He&#39;s<br/>
less than half done, so of COURSE he doesn&#39;t know how to do it all yet.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that he approach the instructor with his concerns?  To let<br/>
the instructor know that he does want to pass, and would appreciate his<br/>
support learning the things he&#39;s finding troublesome?  That in his mind,<br/>
it&#39;s not important to be better than the girls?  Is his size an issue, since<br/>
the other small person is also having trouble -- he can&#39;t change his size,<br/>
but can he change his stance, etc.?  If he is uncomfortable talking to the<br/>
instructor alone, maybe you can join him.  But the above statements gave me<br/>
the impression that with a fair chance, and some support, maybe he could<br/>
make it work.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, figure the $$ are gone at this point, and consider with your son<br/>
whether sticking with it and trying, but not stressing about passing is<br/>
worthwhile, or if continuing would be an emotional loss as well as a<br/>
financial loss.  His heart will always be more important than money.<br/>

He wants to quit, but I&#39;m not sure that this is the right decision.  I have <br/>
this idea ingrained in me that he should finish, no matter what.  He was the <br/>
one that got me to write to all of you, wondering what your perspective <br/>
would be.<br/>

<br/>
I think you should let him quit.   He can take the class again or later.  But <br/>
you will have bought $43 worth of his trust if he doesn&#39;t have to go Thursday <br/>
or Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes parents would love to give $5000 to earn their kids&#39; trust when <br/>
they&#39;re older and the relationship is messed up, but you can&#39;t really buy <br/>
trust with money.<br/>
<br/>
You can, though, earn trust by listening to your child instead of to the <br/>
guilt-messages imbedded in you from your own childhood.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*Anyone* can learn to stick with something. You just stop thinking and<br/>
feeling and muddle through to the end.<br/>
<br/>
The *real* trick is learning when to stick something out and when to cut<br/>
your losses. To learn to assess when something is providing less than what<br/>
it&#39;s taking.<br/>
<br/>
Is a few swimming lessons worth the price your son is paying in feeling he<br/>
is being held prisoner by money, you, the teacher, society&#39;s thoughts of him<br/>
as a quitter?<br/>
<br/>
What if you decided to take a class and you felt half way through that you<br/>
weren&#39;t getting enough out of it and it was draining too much from you?<br/>
There&#39;s a *huge huge* difference between you deciding you want to stick it<br/>
out so as not to waste the money or become a quitter and your husband saying<br/>
you must stick it out for those reasons.<br/>
