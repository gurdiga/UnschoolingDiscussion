 Ren your &quot;it finally happened&quot; thread was very helpful. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
I think if you&#39;re going to go through some stress, it ought to be beneficial <br/>
in some way!! :)<br/>
And it ended up not being stressful really at all. Lucky for us.<br/>
<br/>
About your positive reaction to homeschooling....I tend to get more of that <br/>
now than I did even a mere eight years ago. It is becoming more common and <br/>
generally more acceptable in mainstream society now that more homeschoolers <br/>
are getting media coverage.<br/>
BUT, unschooling is another story. I have yet to get very many good reactions <br/>
when I try to describe that! <br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
