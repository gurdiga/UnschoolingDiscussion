<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148423879">Hi,<br/>
   I also have an 8 year old daughter. History, geography  are easy subjects<br/>
to pick up just about anywhere one goes. Hikes, walks around town, trips to<br/>
the zoo, science centers, historical monuments, the news, American Girl<br/>
books,any historical story book, etc.<br/>
 Grab a map at the zoo, mall, museum, amusement park, wherever. If you are<br/>
using directions to go somewhere, see if she will help you by reading the<br/>
directions as you drive. I print maps at mapquest.com when I go places, and<br/>
my daughter likes to help read and get us to where we need to go. Scavenger<br/>
hunt around the neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
A favorite game at my house lately- I take prisoners, usually a stuffed<br/>
animal, so the young spies (I also have a 6 year old) can go to work.  I<br/>
usually tie up a teddy bear,or hide a surprise, and make a map and clues.<br/>
<br/>
At the request of my husband, I tested my daughter last year, and with no<br/>
formal instruction, she scored very well just from living.<br/>
I hope this makes some sense, I am so sleepy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have an 8 yr old daughter, too, and one of the things that I try to<br/>
remember is that she doesn&#39;t have to learn any history or geography this<br/>
year, or next year, or for a long time.... I finally learned where all<br/>
the US states are a couple of years ago, when we found this game at the<br/>
thrift store called State to State  that she wanted to play over and<br/>
over... <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that Cacie seems to learn what would traditionally be  a few<br/>
year&#39;s worth of knowledge  in the schools all at once, or at least in a<br/>
big burst. A really simple example - I know that in the state standards<br/>
for ths state where we live, they have a standard in 1st grade for adding<br/>
2 digit numbers with regrouping, then in the 2nd grade it&#39;s 3 digit<br/>
numbers, then I think the 4th is 5 digit numbers... maybe the third is<br/>
when they add 3 different multi-digit numbers... I don&#39;t remember<br/>
exactly, but it was all chopped up. So, Cacie figured out how to add<br/>
numbers in her head when she was pretty little, like 4 or 5, and she<br/>
could easily add any 2 digit numbers, and if she was motivated she could<br/>
add any 3 digit numbers that way, and sometimes she used tricks to do<br/>
larger numbers but basically, something like 45,678 + 32,967 would be<br/>
beyond what she knew or wanted to attempt. It wasn&#39;t really a problem,<br/>
except for scorekeeping in games, especially games with big number, like<br/>
Life. But, okay, I scorekept those.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago she started getting curious about the way I added the<br/>
numbers - the traditional way, carry the tens, all that. She asked me to<br/>
show her what I was doing - she already understood the basic idea,<br/>
because she added in her head, so when I explined that this one meant one<br/>
ten, and all that, she got it. Still, writing down anything was not<br/>
something she wanted to be doing, so she never really tried it herself.<br/>
Then in September, we spent a looong time in an airport, and we were<br/>
playing 5 Crowns and she asked to  keep the score. I saw her carefully<br/>
writing out the numbers and then adding &quot;my way&quot;, carrying the tens over,<br/>
rather than doing it all in her head. On the way home, she asked me to<br/>
write some more &quot;plusses&quot; for her to figure out, and I would write 2 or<br/>
3, and she would gleefully solve them all and ask for bigger ones, harder<br/>
ones. By the end of the trip I was writing 10+ digit numbers for her to<br/>
add, and she had it down pat. I also started writing 3 or more numbers<br/>
for her to add, to see if she could figure out that sometimes you would<br/>
carry a 2, or a 3, and she had no problem with it. <br/>
<br/>
So, here she was at 8, starting out at the beginning of the week doing<br/>
what kids in first grade are expected to do, and ending the week by doing<br/>
things a lot of schoolkids her age wouldn&#39;t be able to do. That seems to<br/>
be how it goes with a lot of things, she gets interested and learns<br/>
things in big chunks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been sitting here thinking should be added! Kids learn kind<br/>
of like they grow. They stay sort of the same and then eat everything in<br/>
sight and shoot up--not at all like the charts in the doctors&#39; offices. They<br/>
tend to learn like that, too--sit and read, or build, or draw--whatever they<br/>
do--for months and then suddenly multiply, write, read (if they hadn&#39;t) or<br/>
whatever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738629404">I get the digest version of Unschooling, and I save<br/>
them til I have a block of time to read , so I&#39;m<br/>
catching up for December--now that it&#39;s Jan. 1!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you&#39;ve already found this out, and I missed<br/>
the loop, but hsing in Maine is not difficult. I live<br/>
in Waterford, ME, and I unschool my 13 yo and will be<br/>
&quot;official&quot; next year when my 6 yo becomes 7, the legal<br/>
age for schooling in Maine.<br/>
<br/>
Maine does not require testing. It is optional at<br/>
grades 4,8, and 11. Most of the hs groups(and there<br/>
are secular and religious, curriculum oriented and<br/>
unschooling groups) have a certified teacher review<br/>
whatever the parent/child chooses to submit as<br/>
evidence of &quot;educational progress&quot; and sign a letter<br/>
to that effect. Most of the time at the &quot;annual<br/>
review&quot; is spent trading ideas about what the children<br/>
have been enthusiastic about. <br/>
<br/>
175 days of &quot;learning&quot; are required between Sept. 1<br/>
and Aug 31 of the following year. You submit your<br/>
&quot;letter&quot; after the porfolio review, along with your<br/>
application for the following school year. This year,<br/>
I lost my application so I just downloaded it. <br/>
<br/>
Melissa may write privately if I can be of further<br/>
help,so as not to bog down the list. <br/>
