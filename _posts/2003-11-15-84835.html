<div id="ygrps-yiv-643593021">VERY SORRY for duplicate posts.  Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Meant to clarify this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For a while we had an outhouse too, but my dad filled it in with four <br/>
teenaged girls and one bathroom, no shower, just bathtub.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Revised:<br/>
<br/>
At the same time he had four teenaged girls, one bathroom, no shower, just <br/>
bathtub, my dad inexplicably filled in the outhouse (hole) with dirt (and tore <br/>
down the building itself).<br/>
