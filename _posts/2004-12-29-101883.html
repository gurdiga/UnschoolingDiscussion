Happy Birthday to Rowan. I&#39;m glad she was born!<br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly, totally clueless about HomestarRunner, but I&#39;ll ask the girlfriend,  <br/>
Carly tonight for ideas.<br/>

Awww...<br/>
 <br/>
We have all the Strongbad e-mails on DVD (all up to some point) as of  <br/>
Christmas, and the CD of weird songs.  There&#39;s a great a cappella techno  thing.  If <br/>
you were closer...<br/>
 <br/>
You could have the kids draw pictures of dragons and then watch Trogdor, or  <br/>
watch Japanese Cartoon and then put on a Japanese anime movie as background  <br/>
music.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty&#39;s our resident expert.  I&#39;ll try to ask him.<br/>

Marty suggests they could do reenactments of the holiday cartoons (not the  <br/>
e-mails, but where it says toons.  Or just play the music.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty says you might serve &quot;pie-monade&quot; which was pie and ice cream stuck  in <br/>
a glass.<br/>
&quot;Bub&#39;s 50 cent deal,&quot; which is chicken with just the bones and skin, and  <br/>
half-eaten bread.<br/>
But he doesn&#39;t recommend you serve that at a party, just saying that it&#39;s  <br/>
another strongbad food-thing.<br/>
 <br/>
He wants to play Halo now, though, and not help me help you.  <br/>
Can he DO that?!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837825290"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Happy Birthday to Rowan. I&#39;m glad she was born!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**Me too!  She smiled big when I read that to her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Marty suggests they could do reenactments of the holiday cartoons<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**Good idea!<br/>
<br/>
We have the 3 DVD set, so we can do that too.  I LOVE the idea of<br/>
Piemonade - I think she&#39;d flip. If I use a chocolate cream pie it&#39;ll be<br/>
yummy, too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Can he DO that?!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**I&#39;m a bit far away to stop him, and he&#39;s quite a bit bigger than me<br/>
anyway, so I&#39;m going to go with &quot;sure&quot; :0).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Kelly and Marty and Sandra.  ~Rue<br/>

How about having them make sock puppets and put on a puppet show?  I <br/>
bet they could cook up some pretty great homestar-esque skits.<br/>

www.makingfiends.com is great too.</div>
