<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079920155">My first child was totally oblivious to her body functions until she was<br/>
past 3 1/2.  She didn&#39;t know she had to go until she went.  She is also the<br/>
type of kid to get so involved in something that she blocks out everything<br/>
else.  She wore cloth diapers but it didn&#39;t matter to her that she was wet.<br/>
She finally potty trained at 3 years 7 months, when she was ready.<br/>
<br/>
My son just trained last week, and he&#39;s just a few weeks shy of his 3rd<br/>
birthday.  He has known for many months what to do, has been very aware of<br/>
his body functions for a while, had been able to hold it, has woken up dry<br/>
many mornings.  He just wasn&#39;t ready to do it himself until last week.  He<br/>
has had other health issues so I didn&#39;t push it.  He wore disposables for<br/>
the past year (since he got sick).<br/>

think our babies are numb from the waist down or something.  They are<br/>
actually keyed in to communicating about their elimination needs- just like<br/>
nursing- but because we arent looking for it- we don&#39;t see it.  They learn<br/>

finally &quot;DUH!&quot; and I take him to pee.  When I am really in tune- I can<br/>

<br/>
The reason it seems that older children &quot;don&#39;t have any awareness&quot;- is<br/>
because in order to manage a very uncomfortable icky situation (diapers)<br/>
they have had to &quot;turn off&quot;, because they don&#39;t have a choice.  Then later,<br/>
they find it a challenge to turn back on and control those muscles.<br/>

The reason I am going on about this is because if I had even heard one<br/>
person say they did this- It would have opened a door for me with my other<br/>
children.<br/>

This is my daughter as well. She is 3 1/2 and has just potty trained in the last month.  She has an older brother that was trained by 2 and a younger brother that will go in the potty or not, he is still 20 months and not really bothered if mom has to blot up after him...<br/>
<br/>
I used cloth, let her go naked, let her pick out panties, you name it.  She just was NOT ready and could care less if she peed on herself, her clothes, the floor...She was the same way with talking-she did not say a word until she was almost 3.  Then she had so much to say that it was almost scary all the chatter coming from my mute child.  <br/>
<br/>
She used the potty 3 weeks ago and has had one accident since.  It all depends on the child and the way they learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710921886">One of mine was the oblivious sort, and he also wet the bed at night until he <br/>
was... well I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s done, but he&#39;s down to less than once every <br/>
week or two.<br/>
<br/>
I was the oblivious sort in that even in 4th grade when kids would ask if I <br/>
needed #1 or #2 I wasn&#39;t sure.  I don&#39;t remember wetting myself at school at <br/>
all, but I was vague on what was going on with my body.  Still am sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Holly just got it overnight this way too: -=-She used the potty 3 weeks ago <br/>
and has had one accident since.  It all depends on the child and the way they <br/>
learn.-=-  She was two, but it&#39;s been so long I don&#39;t remember if young two <br/>
or older.  One day she wasn&#39;t knowing or caring and then she did.<br/>

Ok :-)  Um yeah, he doesnt ever wear diapers.  But alot of &quot;westerners&quot; who do this do wear diapers, and just take them off when the baby needs to go. WHen he goes to the bathroom I hold him in a squat with his back against my chest over the toilet (or ground, or whatever..) but there are other positions too.  Basically, when he has to poop, he sort of grunts and looks at me- also I know that he has to go usually in the morning- so I try to be aware.  He also has times when he always has to pee- like right after naps.  When we are out side, he just pees in the grass. Inside my daughter and I go about our business and he does various things to let us know he needs to go.  He fusses, looks at us, pauses with a blank stare, crawls toward the bathroom, he even sometimes makes the ASL sign for toilet!- we just get a feeling. This is a learning experience and it seems each developmental phase brings its new aspect to EC (elimination communication). When we are out, he wears clothes and is usually in a sling- he won&#39;t pee on me, so even if I am in wild conversation- he will get my attention.- then I go to a bathroom, and he pees there.  In parks, I will pee him in a bush sometimes.  If I am going somewhere I offer to pee him- and he will push what he has out, or say with subtle body language that he doesnt have to go.<br/>
<br/>
At night i sleep with a silky naked baby- (worth missing a pee- let me tell you!)  I hardly ever get wet- when he was younger, he would pee every couple hours, and now he holds it till early morning- he gets restless, I take him to the bathroom, he goes, and then we go back to bed. (there are many options to all of these things- this is just what I do)<br/>
<br/>
Now he is walking and I got some tiny plastic potties- and put them around.  I don&#39;t think he knows what they are for yet, and I am not sure about them.  It feels so crazy- like if I was breast feeding in the fifties- who would I ask if i had a question?  But I have a e-list that gives lots of help and there is the fabulous book &quot;Diaper Free&quot; by Ingrid Bauer (an unschooler I believe!)-it just got accepted into LLL&#39;s book list- a very rigorous process. there is also another book, but I haven&#39;t read it yet-but plan to.<br/>
<br/>
I did this wacky thing because of the way my baby resonded when I tried it because my diapers were in the drier.  Just like Diane said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;ll never forget the joy on my 7-month-old daughter&#39;s face <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the first time I let her go in the potty. She seemed so relieved that I had <br/>
finally caught on!&gt;&gt;<br/>
