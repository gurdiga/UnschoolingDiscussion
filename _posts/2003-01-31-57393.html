reasons other than home education I am not a big fan <br/>
of &quot;Cincinnattitude,&quot; but as far as an area that is rich in self-<br/>
directed learning resources, I&#39;d put the Greater Cincinnati Metro <br/>
Area way up there.  A large tri-state metropolitan area with <br/>
everything and anything available, a good deal of it for FREE!  One <br/>
drawback....no decent mass transit, so mom is primarily chauffeur.  <br/>

Dh and Dd both work at the Cincinnati Museum Center in the 1930s art <br/>
deco Union Terminal where they have an excellent youth volunteer <br/>
program, so we know it well.  And we dash between there, Indiana <br/>
(Lawrenceburg) for skiing, Oxford (Miami University) for theatre and <br/>
workshops and lots of sports, Dayton (tons more great stuff to see <br/>
and do!), Newport (Kentucky, on the Ohio River front, with its new <br/>
big Aquarium that has a great teen volunteer program and lots of <br/>
development going on), Covington (also in KY with parks and museums <br/>
and great cheap art classes for home educators at the Baker Hunt <br/>
Foundation). <br/>
<br/>
In northern Cincinnati Dd volunteers in an historical village, <br/>
studies dance and movement, piano, and trains for figure skating <br/>
daily.  Both Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky are training up some of <br/>
the top up and coming figure skaters in the country.  With a fine <br/>
fencing school and every imaginable kind of martial arts training <br/>
center, as well as its Olympic gymnastics training facilities, <br/>
several good climbing gyms, and all kinds of other physical fun <br/>
opportunities from unicycle training to horseback riding, period <br/>
dance troups, and more.  <br/>
<br/>
Dd attends lots of great teen activities and events at our branch <br/>
library (teen drama club, chess club, writing club, knitting club, <br/>
book club), and others in the large downtown library facility, too.  <br/>
Known for its hills and beautiful parks Cincinnati provides a great <br/>
variety of volunteer opportunities and tons of nature related events <br/>
and activities, some especially for home educators.   Not to mention <br/>
the symphony, the ballet, lots and lots of theatre, jazz, concerts of <br/>
all kinds, art galleries galore.  We often go to great free concerts <br/>
or free theatre presentations where only a handful of people show <br/>
up!  Go figure.  <br/>
<br/>
Cincinnati has a whole bunch of colleges and universities, too, with <br/>
all the great freebie learning and cultural opportunities that they <br/>
often sponsor.  The new architecturally acclaimed Contemporary Art <br/>
Center downtown, the Taft Museum (currently undergoing renovation), <br/>
and the soon to open National Underground Railroad Museum will add <br/>
even more options for those who live in this area.  And we also enjoy <br/>
a very active and diverse home education community with lots of <br/>
different home ed support groups, something for everyone.  Okay, <br/>
that&#39;s it for my Cincinnati spiel.  With all its other problems we <br/>
have thoroughly enjoyed mining its unschooling riches!  <br/>
