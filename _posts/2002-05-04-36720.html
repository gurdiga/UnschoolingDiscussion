<br/>
MEA CULPA!<br/>
<br/>
I hate when I have to do this! Last month I ran the wrong ad for one <br/>
of my advertisers, Headsprout Reading (http://www.headsprout.com). <br/>
Unfortunately, the ad misled subscribers into thinking Headsprout&#39;s <br/>
entire reading program is free at their website. It&#39;s not free <br/>
(because they spent $5 million developing it and they can&#39;t afford to <br/>
give it away!), but they are generously offering 5 free lessons so <br/>
you can try the program before you buy it. That&#39;s more than enough to <br/>
ensure you&#39;re buying a high quality reading program, which actually <br/>
adapts to your child&#39;s needs as your child uses it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what one of our own subscribers, Ruthie Chatton, had to say <br/>
about using Headsprout: &quot;We loved Headsprout. More importantly, when <br/>
asked if reading was hard, my son responded, &#39;No, reading is easy!&#39; I <br/>
think that in itself says the most for your program. I felt it was <br/>
very effective in teaching my son to read, plus the reinforcement has <br/>
given him confidence....I am so impressed! It&#39;s a great program that <br/>
makes something thought as one of the hardest things to master <br/>
incredibly fun and easy. I tell other parents how enjoyable the <br/>
program is and then have my son show them how well it worked.&quot; You <br/>
can read more testimonials at http://www.headsprout.com/testimonials<br/>
<br/>
So please take a look at Headsprout&#39;s website. You&#39;ll be glad you did <br/>
and maybe I can get off this hook! ~CN~<br/>

&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
For learning to take place with any kind of efficiency students must <br/>
be motivated. To be motivated, they must become interested. And they <br/>
become interested when they are actively working on projects which <br/>
they can relate to their values and goals in life.<br/>
~ Gus Tuberville, president of William Penn College ~<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
FROGS<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One of my most memorable activities as a kid was watching one of <br/>
Mother Nature&#39;s most amazing transformations: the development of a <br/>
tadpole into a frog. I remember being absolutely thrilled as the hind <br/>
legs began to emerge from the tadpoles. Next, the forelegs slowly <br/>
grew while at the same time the tadpole&#39;s tail started disappearing! <br/>
This was a rather slow process as it takes about 2 to 3 months for <br/>
the tadpole to develop completely in to a frog. Even at this slow <br/>
pace, it was exciting to watch.<br/>
<br/>
You can scoop up some tadpoles from a pond, make them at home in an <br/>
aquarium and watch their development. Or you can buy a frog hatchery <br/>
from a place such as Insect Lore. This hatchery includes a <br/>
certificate for live from embryos so you can watch the tiny embryos <br/>
change into tadpoles and then see the tadpoles develop into frogs.&quot; ~ <br/>

current issue, stop by our website at www.home-ed-magazine.com.<br/>

<br/>
MORE FROGS<br/>
http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/go/frog<br/>
<br/>
If you get really interested in frogs and you&#39;d like to see what <br/>
makes them tick, why not try a virtual frog dissection? My <br/>
animal-loving daughter was repulsed with the idea of even a virtual <br/>
dissection, but she soon took over the mouse after I started cutting <br/>
away with the virtual scalpel. This site has links to other virtual <br/>
dissections as well. I can&#39;t quite bring myself to try the cat yet, <br/>
but virtual dissection certainly beats the smell of formaldehyde and <br/>
the feel of frog guts.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
ASK CAROL<br/>
<br/>
Every other month, I ask people to send me questions, and I promise <br/>
to answer as many as I can in future columns. Although I don&#39;t answer <br/>
them in this newsletter, I do answer them in every issue of Home <br/>
Education Magazine, the original print version where homeschoolers <br/>
have found support for over 20 years. A couple of them are online <br/>
(http://www.home-ed-magazine.com), but most of them you have to read <br/>
in the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I really like to get your questions-any questions at all, even if you <br/>
think your question is too stupid and you&#39;re the only one who has <br/>
your particular problem (probably not true). So, don&#39;t be shy; don&#39;t <br/>
procrastinate; send me your questions. I even have a special email <br/>
address: askcarol@... . Of course, I don&#39;t promise I <br/>
can answer every question in the magazine (especially if you don&#39;t <br/>
send one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use it for a <br/>
column or not. What are you waiting for? (~ CN ~)<br/>

<br/>
UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is a whole lot harder to talk about what unschooling looks like <br/>
in practice, because it is totally absolutely and completely <br/>
different for every family. And it isn&#39;t easily described by a list <br/>
like schooling is - it isn&#39;t an alternative method of schooling like <br/>
doing unit studies is, for example.<br/>
<br/>
It takes time to read about unschooling and really &#39;grok&#39; it - it <br/>
takes reading LOTS of people&#39;s anecdotes and reading their <br/>
philosophies and how they apply it in their lives and thinking about <br/>
how that philosophy might apply in your own family&#39;s life while <br/>
understanding that it will LOOK really different in your family, even <br/>
if the underlying principles are the same.&quot; ~ Pam Sorooshian in a <br/>
conversation on the Unschooling-dotcom email list. ~<br/>

HOMESCHOOL WEBSITE OF THE MONTH<br/>
http://folc.homestead.com/FOLC.html<br/>
<br/>
The Family Oriented Learning Cooperative in eastern Prince William <br/>
County, Virginia offers a great website not only for Virginia <br/>
homeschoolers, but homeschoolers around the nation. You&#39;ll find the <br/>
usual resources, freebies and information on Virginia law, but they <br/>
also share a number of excellent commentaries on homeschool politics <br/>
and how-to articles on contacting state legislatures and finding a <br/>
homeschool group. It&#39;s a site worth looking at even if you don&#39;t live <br/>
in Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There exists a myth that the only way for a young person to be <br/>
accepted into college is through building a record for compliant <br/>
behavior in a secondary educational institution. This myth was <br/>
exposed for many of us when David and Micki Colfax wrote about their <br/>
boys being accepted into Harvard on the strength of their own efforts <br/>
and on the lives that they had put together for themselves, as <br/>
described in Homeschooling for Excellence.<br/>
<br/>
When David Illingworth, senior admissions officer at Harvard, spoke <br/>
to Maine families attending our statewide home education conference <br/>
some years ago, he assured them that even Harvard does not require a <br/>
high school diploma for admission to a degree program. He suggested <br/>
that Harvard was more interested in the lives of home educated kids <br/>
and in how they presented themselves than in whether or not they had <br/>
high school diplomas, documents which are not extremely rare.<br/>
<br/>
Since then we have read many accounts of young men and women being <br/>
accepted into colleges and universities on the strength of their <br/>
independent learning and the interesting and productive lives they <br/>
have led. We are accustomed to seeing letters in the home education <br/>
media from admissions officers encouraging home educated kids to <br/>
apply to their colleges. In fact, as more than one admissions officer <br/>
has stated, all else being equal, many colleges tend to choose <br/>
homeschooled kids for their motivation and for the diversity that <br/>
they bring to the campus community.&quot; ~ Excerpt from Earl Stevens&#39; <br/>
article &quot;The Door is Open ~<br/>
<br/>
As graduation rolls around, homeschoolers field more questions about <br/>
whether our children will be able to go to college some day. This <br/>
website contains a number of articles on homeschooling teens and <br/>
beyond, including the rest of the article quoted above.<br/>

BUMPER STICKERS<br/>
<br/>
After reading last month&#39;s request for homeschool bumper sticker <br/>
ideas, Brad Withers sent along his favorites, copied from the bumper <br/>
of his car:<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers Work Smarter Not Harder<br/>
Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Homeschooling<br/>
Proud Parent of a Homeschooled Child<br/>
Educate at Home<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Brad. I think it&#39;s important for the world to know we&#39;re out <br/>
there and we&#39;re proud to be homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anne Ohman even has some she&#39;d like to sell. She says, &quot;There&#39;s a <br/>
picture of happy children with their arms around each other, and it <br/>
says:<br/>
<br/>
Free to Think, Learn, Do and BE<br/>
Learning through Life, Joyfully!<br/>
Unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
E-mail me if you want to see the picture, or if you want to buy one <br/>
to help spread the word...plant the seeds!!&quot; You can email Anne at <br/>
ohman@... if you&#39;re interested in buying one.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
TREE ID<br/>
http://treelink.org/whattree<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a neat site for all you tree lovers out there who want to <br/>
identify spring and summer trees. You&#39;re given a series of questions <br/>
about the leaves on your tree. Follow the link for the best answer to <br/>
the next set of questions and continue until you&#39;ve identified your <br/>
tree. When you&#39;re done, you might want to go to the Amazing Picture <br/>
Machine (below) and see if you can find a picture of your tree there.<br/>
<br/>
The National Arbor Day Foundation sponsors this site. If you follow <br/>
the link to their home page, you&#39;ll see that Priscilla Anne Fisch, a <br/>
homeschooler from Idaho, won second place in their 2002 poster <br/>
contest. Congratulations, Priscilla! You can see who won the contest <br/>
in your state and find information on entering their 2003 contest.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
The Amazing Picture Machine<br/>
http://www.ncrtec.org/picture.htm<br/>
<br/>
This is the coolest website! The Amazing Picture Machine searches the <br/>
Internet for links to pictures based on a keyword. For instance, if <br/>
you input the word &quot;horse,&quot; you&#39;ll get a list of 18 choices from an <br/>
old fire engine to a Peter Paul Reubens painting to a wild mustang. I <br/>
didn&#39;t get an overwhelming number of choices for most of the words I <br/>
tried; &quot;frog&quot; gave me 7 and &quot;tree&quot; gave me 81.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of all kinds of ways to use this website. When my artist <br/>
daughter wants a picture of a particular object, animal or person to <br/>
draw, she can use this site to get several examples and perspectives. <br/>
I even set the tree frog as wallpaper on my desktop. ) To change your <br/>
wallpaper on a PC, let the picture fully load, right click your mouse <br/>
and choose &quot;set as wallpaper.&quot;) Bookmark this site. I know you&#39;ll <br/>
return to it many times.<br/>
