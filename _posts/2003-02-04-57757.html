&gt; THE MISUNDERSTOOD CHILD<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;            I am the child that looks healthy and fine.<br/>
&gt;            I was born with ten fingers and toes.<br/>
&gt;            But something is different, somewhere in my mind.<br/>
&gt;            And what it is, nobody knows.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;            I am the child that struggles in school,<br/>
&gt;            Though they say that I&#39;m perfectly smart.<br/>
&gt;            They tell me I&#39;m lazy - can learn if I try -<br/>
&gt;            But I don&#39;t seem to know where to start.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;            I am the child that won&#39;t wear the clothes<br/>
&gt;            Which hurt me or bother my feet.<br/>
&gt;            I dread sudden noises, can&#39;t handle most smells,<br/>
&gt;            And tastes - there are few foods I&#39;ll eat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;            I am the child that can&#39;t catch the ball<br/>
&gt;            And runs with an awkward gait.<br/>
&gt;            I am the one chosen last on the team<br/>
&gt;            And I cringe as I stand there and wait.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;            I am the child with whom no one will play -<br/>
&gt;            The one that gets bullied and teased.<br/>
&gt;            I try to fit in and I want to be liked,<br/>
&gt;            But nothing I do seems to please.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;            I am the child that tantrums and freaks<br/>
&gt;            Over things that seem petty and trite.<br/>
&gt;            You&#39;ll never know how I panic inside,<br/>
&gt;            When I&#39;m lost in my anger and fright.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;            I am the child that fidgets and squirms<br/>
&gt;            Though I&#39;m told to sit still and be good<br/>
&gt;            Do you think that I choose to be out of control?<br/>
&gt;            Don&#39;t you know that I would if I could?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;            I am the child with the broken heart<br/>
&gt;            Though I act like I don&#39;t really care.<br/>
&gt;            Perhaps there&#39;s a reason God made me this way -<br/>
&gt;            Some message he sent me to share.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;            For I am the child that needs to be loved<br/>
&gt;            And accepted and valued too.<br/>
&gt;            I am the child that is misunderstood,<br/>
&gt;            I am different - but look just like you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
