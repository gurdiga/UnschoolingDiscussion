Also  - if you cut out the individual egg-cups of the styrofoam ones, you can decorate them with faces, put each one on top of an ice cube, and make nifty little bug-people who will zoom around on your kitchen floor (until the cube melts, then you have to get another one).  <br/>

OH!  We did this and the dog stomped the bugs and snatched up the ice<br/>
cubes and ran away with them!&lt;G&gt;<br/>
Pretty damn silly business. <br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>
