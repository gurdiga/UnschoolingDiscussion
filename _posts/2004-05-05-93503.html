<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469149060">Well, <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the information I got:<br/>
<br/>
What we attended was an informational meeting for a Community 4H club, which is a club that offers multiple projects with multiple leaders.  <br/>
<br/>
The first come first serve thing might be re-evaluated.  The coordinator wasn&#39;t totally aware of this practice, and the state office has never heard of such a practice.<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to the national site&#39;s &quot;enroll any time of year&quot;, the community project club is a specific enrollment, and enrollment is once/year mainly for the convenience of the leaders who are volunteers.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, and the most important piece of information:  there is such a thing as project clubs, which is what you all are describing.  <br/>
<br/>
There are only 4 or 5 project clubs in the county:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Pygmy goats<br/>
2.  Seeing Eye Dogs<br/>
3.  Horse Clubs<br/>
4.  Livestock (which includes Dairy, or Dairy is the 5th club, I&#39;m not sure)<br/>
<br/>
She said there is such a thing as a &quot;self determination project&quot;.  THATS probably what I&#39;ll do...as this most resembles &quot;unschooling&quot;, but I want to see what all they have to offer.  I am also going to call another nearby county and see what they have because I&#39;m already a Girl Scout leader, and I don&#39;t know if I can take on 4H too :o).<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had known all this before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a general meeting once a month for everyone (some months <br/>
skipped), a yearly fair, and at least  50 projects, everything from <br/>
dairy to beef, rabbits, cats, dogs, horses, chickens, sewing, <br/>
woodworking, gardening, flowers, decorations, electricity, computers,  <br/>
baking, canning,  almost anything you can imagine.<br/>
Some projects have little time commitment (easy projects & young <br/>
children), and others involve more time (usually age 13 on up).<br/>
You do not have to live in the country to be in 4-H.  Even some &quot;city&quot; <br/>
people show a cow from a nearby farm.  Many cities allow rabbits or <br/>
female chickens (which make no noise, only roosters are noisy)<br/>
Walking thru the various displays in the sheds is a favorite family <br/>
activity every summer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;insert&gt;many clucking and crowing sounds, grins, smiles, and fresh eggs.<br/>
<br/>
How true, some hens are more &quot;proud&quot; than others.  They do not &quot;cluck&quot; <br/>
until they are old enough to lay, which varies by breed, average 4 <br/>
months.  After the fair you could sell the chicken or give it away, <br/>
before it makes noise.  The roosters noise volume is considerable <br/>
louder however, where a neighbor might not mind clucking, crowing is <br/>
quite a bit different (see the movie &quot;Hook&quot;)  I can hear my neighbors <br/>
roosters, but the hens are not even detectable.<br/>
Keith - who has something to crow about :)</div>
