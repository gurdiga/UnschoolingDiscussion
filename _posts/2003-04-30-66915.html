<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749799084">I&#39;ve watched Oprah for a total of about 5 minutes in the last year, but in that 5 min was a little old lady that said she had been trying forever to get tickets over the phone and was never able to, but then she went online and got them right away, so you may want to check that out.<br/>

Actually, they only do last minute tix online, I guess to take the place of <br/>
the people who can&#39;t make it. (It&#39;d work out fine for those who live close!)  <br/>
  Thanks though! Lara........</div>
