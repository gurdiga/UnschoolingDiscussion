<div id="ygrps-yiv-523629203">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
My family and I currently live in California, but are considering a <br/>
move to Colorado.  Do any of you have any information or first-hand <br/>
experience with unschooling in Colorado?  In particular, my main <br/>
concern in the state mandated testing.  We have none of that in CA <br/>
and the thought of subjecting my kids to standardized tests is quite <br/>
bothersome!  Any info is much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
TIA - Susan</div>
