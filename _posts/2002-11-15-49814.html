<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The funny thing is that once you get past the korean<br/>
&gt; features she actually looks a heck of a lot like my friend...same shaped face,<br/>
&gt; same <br/>
&gt; sparkle in her eyes. Definitely the same mannerisms.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My sister and I are both adopted, from different families.  We both have<br/>
brown hair and glasses.  The resemblence stops there.<br/>
<br/>
She is short and cute, with green eyes, olive skin, wavy hair, and a round<br/>
face with high cheekbones.  I&#39;m almost 6 feet tall, have straight hair, a<br/>
long face, brown eyes, fair skin, etc.<br/>
<br/>
All our lives people have told us we look alike.  It&#39;s the mannerisms and<br/>
the speech.  We gesture alike and have the same slightly &quot;off&quot; accent that&#39;s<br/>
typical to our family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This too has happened to me all my life. People say to my Mother and I, &quot;You <br/>
too look so much alike! She has your smile!&quot;<br/>
We actually forget the small detail that someone else conceived, carried and <br/>
gave birth to me. It&#39;s pretty insignificant. I believe that the me that is Me <br/>
would have still had the same parents as I do, I just came into the family in <br/>
a different way.<br/>
