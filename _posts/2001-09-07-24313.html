<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202430006">Ok, if everyone&#39;s so relaxed about bedtimes, what about bathing?<br/>
<br/>
My 3yo hasn&#39;t had his hair washed in weeks, literally. He bathes daily but <br/>
refuses to get his hair wet. Really doesn&#39;t even like to in the pool.  The <br/>
last time we washed it, it  was a screaming fight, me washing, him screaming. <br/>
I did this for several nights, thinking he&#39;d get used to it and didn&#39;t. I <br/>
couldn&#39;t keep it up. He loathes it, and I loathe forcing him into something <br/>
he hates. We&#39;ve even come up with some really fun stories about bugs nesting <br/>
and mice coming and cats and so on, sort of like the &#39;swallowed a fly&#39; song. <br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<br/>
I think that is pretty normal.  My four year old isn&#39;t crazy for it either. <br/>
Sometimes<br/>
we can convince him sometimes not.  Some how or another his dad got him<br/>
to wash his hair in the shower tonight.  I don&#39;t think little kid heads have <br/>
to be<br/>
washed all that often anyhow.  Especially once the weather cools down.  I <br/>
have given super fast hair washes under protest, but only after like you <br/>
mention, weeks have passed LOL.  This doesn&#39;t really go away when they<br/>
are older either.  My kids often forget to wash their hair.  I don&#39;t much <br/>
care,<br/>
and my dd&#39;s hair is a lovely shade of cholrine green from hotel swimming <br/>
at the HSC conference (yes still that was over 3 wks ago!) and she <br/>
touched it up this past weekend at another hotel swimming pool we were<br/>
at LOL.  I also don&#39;t require that she brush her hair unless its very <br/>
important-to me(she has long hair), although when we do go out I reqest that<br/>
she please put it in a ponytail.  She hates brushing her hair although she<br/>
is rather vain about it?  Go figure.  Oh well I don&#39;t mind, it means she is<br/>
still a little girl : )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778934406">How about a bar of soap at the creek?<br/>
We used to take a bath in the lake in WI.  It was so much fun.  Use<br/>
Ivory it floats!<br/>
My kids swim in the pool almost everyday too...this usually sort of<br/>
cleans them off.<br/>
We have also hosed them off with soap and shampoo in the wash stall in<br/>
the barn, and in the yard.<br/>
Ha, ha, ha...<br/>
But, my kids love to take baths and showers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-812968053">We have three children, each of which went through the &quot;I shall scream if you <br/>
wash my hair, and the neighbors might call 911&quot; phase.<br/>
<br/>
First, there are ways to wash hair which do not involve the tub or the <br/>
shower.  Be creative.<br/>
<br/>
With smaller children we had great success with kid in shower on dad&#39;s hip.  <br/>
Dad sweettalks kid into one pass through the water (washcloth covering eyes <br/>
in extreme cases).  Dad turns to where mom shampoos the hair with the most <br/>
tear-free baby shampoo available, head-massage, scratching if the kid likes <br/>
that, all smiley and happy, and dad passes the kid through the water again <br/>
(washcloth on eyes?).  Rub it some more.  Maybe pour water on with a cup <br/>
while the kid looks at the ceiling.<br/>
<br/>
Final pass through the shower and into the towel-draped arms of mom.<br/>
<br/>
Too coddling?<br/>
Do you want them happy or not?  Do you want their hair washed or not?<br/>
<br/>
When the kids are too old to ride dad&#39;s hip in the shower, maybe you have a <br/>
long kitchen cabinet where they can lie on the cabinet with their head on the <br/>
edge of the kitchen sink.  MAYBE you even have a sink sprayer, or can find an <br/>
attachment for the tub with one.  If the kid is lying down, head back, you <br/>
can very gently wash hair and pour water on hair only and they get no water <br/>
in their eyes or face.  <br/>
<br/>
If your sink is on a short cabinet and there is no possible way the kid can <br/>
fit, maybe you can make a similar hair washing station with a table, and a <br/>
tub (like a baby bathtub) on a chair under the kid&#39;s head.  Pour warm (not <br/>
too warm) water with big plastic cups.<br/>
<br/>
You need a towel-pillow under the kid&#39;s neck, a washcloth in the kid&#39;s hand <br/>
for defense from accidental water-in-face, and something sweet and peaceful <br/>
to do after the trauma&#39;s over.<br/>

Sandra, SO happy all three will wash their own hair in the shower now!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150399056">How about him doing the washing with fun soaps. Make a trip of it so he can<br/>
choose the one that &quot;belongs&quot; to him.  There are all kinds of colored ones,<br/>
scented ones and ones that come out looking like whipped cream.  Get one of<br/>
those plastic mirrors and use suction cup thingys to hold it on the wall so<br/>
he can see what he is doing.  Let him spike his hair and do silly things.<br/>
Get him laughing.  Sit him in the tub without water and let him play with<br/>
the soaps and maybe those write on the tub wall soap crayons.  Then let him<br/>
decide when it is rinse time and do it a little bit at a time with him<br/>
propping himself up, kinda leaning back with his arms behind him.  I&#39;d use a<br/>
cup of water because it is less threatening than one of those attachments<br/>
and just do a little bit at a time.  make a game of it.  Let him fill the<br/>
cup/glass and ask where he wants that one poured.  Put a whole stack of wash<br/>
rags on the tub edge and tell them they are his emergency weapons against<br/>
any nasty ol&#39; soap that tries to escape down his face.<br/>
<br/>
My little sister was hysterical about it for the longest time and this might<br/>
also be another way to do it.  My gramma turns on the water to low in the<br/>
tub and had my little sister play puppy and crawl around the tub on all<br/>
fours and stick her head a little bit at a time under the running water.<br/>
Then the fun part was to shake like the puppies do.<br/>
<br/>
#1 son went through a stage where he was hysterical about the whole shower<br/>
thing and water in his face.  We use to haul horses and everywhere you went<br/>
showers were the only recoarse you had.  So the adults would carry him in<br/>
and made a game of it.  Piggy back rides or on the hip or even up on the<br/>
shoulders with him &quot;directing&quot; the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868307637">Kirby had a set of plastic dishes with a drain tray he really liked when he <br/>
was little.  <br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t like baths.<br/>
<br/>
I would ask him if he wanted to wash his dishes, and he did.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d give him a plastic dish pan with soapy water (&quot;Baby Magic&quot;  or bubble <br/>
bath, not real dish soap) and leave the water running warm, but not stop up <br/>
the bathtub.  So he was in there naked with running water and soapy water and <br/>
a sponge and a bunch of dishes, so every time he got at least his hands and <br/>
feet really clean.  And it made the tub a place with some good memories and <br/>
not just a scary place.<br/>

&gt; &gt; First, there are ways to wash hair which do not involve the tub or the<br/>
&gt; &gt; shower.  Be creative.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i would think those of us who are presently going through this are Very<br/>
&gt; creative. . .  i have tried it all, or i should say we have. . . quinton<br/>
&gt; hates it all. . . so we wait several weeks until it really has to get<br/>
done. .<br/>
&gt; . my daughter never had this issue with it. We just end up doing it as<br/>
quick<br/>
&gt; as possible usually, and he is fine as soon as we are done.<br/>

I used to give Kirby nighttime haircuts.  One side and then I&#39;d go away until <br/>
he turned over, and get the other side. &lt;g&gt;  He had the back really long and <br/>
the front a bowl cut, for years.<br/>
