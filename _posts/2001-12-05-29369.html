<div id="ygrps-yiv-956743534">I have a question for you:<br/>
How do you balance the need for one of your kids to be places at <br/>
certain times (school) with the rest of the family&#39;s freedom?  We <br/>
have an exchange student this year and he goes to school and is on <br/>
the basketball team.  This schedule thing is killing me!  I am soooo <br/>
not used to having to do things on time everyday.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628277062">Hi..<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had some good suggestions, but all my kids are little and entirely reliant on me getting them everywhere they want/need to go, and it&#39;s just me every day until after 5pm. We have two vehicles, and dh does things after he works, but during the day, we&#39;re on our own. I work from home full-time, so it does get hectic. I don&#39;t like being stuck to a clock much, though there are days where I feel I do nothing but check the time. Between meetings, projects at work, activities I take the kids to, well-baby checkups, etc., the scheduling can get really hectic. There are days where I feel like I&#39;ve not done much other than keep the house relatively okay and changed diapers, but then we talk about the day, and they amaze me at what they&#39;ve learned throughout it all. I think they have to learn that life doesn&#39;t work around us, so maybe it&#39;s a good thing they understand it already. Having a big family, they best learn it now ;)<br/>
