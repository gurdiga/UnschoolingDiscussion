<div id="ygrps-yiv-816337099">Hey Tracy, I very rarely sleep through the night. I have always woken, had a<br/>
drink, lain awake for a while planning the next day, reflecting on the last,<br/>
whatever, and gone back to sleep. The only difference between me and those<br/>
kids &#39;needing&#39; sleep training is that I don&#39;t wake anyone else up - I have<br/>
learnt to be an independant waker.<br/>
<br/>
Well, usually. Lately the wind has been pretty strong and gusty, esp. at<br/>
night, and we are living in an uninsulated shed while we build our house so<br/>
it is very noisy in the wind *and* I happen to know that dh hasn&#39;t nailed<br/>
the flashing down properly yet, so I tend to dig him in the ribs, demanding<br/>
&quot;Are you SURE the roof&#39;s not going to blow off?&quot; Perhaps I need to attend<br/>
the sleep training programme? &lt;g&gt; Is my need for comfort any greater or less<br/>
than all those poor wee children on the programme?<br/>
<br/>
Get writing, Tracy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295980624">Thanks for the encouragement &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m wishing you a peaceful <br/>
night, and if it&#39;s too windy, stop eating those beans!!!<br/>

Tracy<br/>
PS  In case anyone&#39;s wondering, I&#39;ve just watched two episodes <br/>
of Sex and the City, and feeling rather Carrie Bradshaw (except I <br/>
don&#39;t have a laptop, or permed hair...)<br/>
