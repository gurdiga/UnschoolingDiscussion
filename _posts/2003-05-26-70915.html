already about the dire consequences that will ensue.  Very patronizing on<br/>
one hand, and oh so threatening on the other.  As if giving tickets instead<br/>
of jail terms to young kids with a couple of joints in their pocket is going<br/>
to have *any* effect at all on the good old U. S of Hay.  In fact, outright<br/>
legalization is unlikely to have any effect, considering the amount that&#39;s<br/>
crossing the border now.  But we&#39;ve been told we&#39;d definitely better think<br/>
over the possible consequences . . . sigh.<br/>

No not Amsterdam. I know it was in Canada somewhere. It was a tv show that<br/>
showed people lighting up in smoke shops with no hassles. My husband<br/>
remembers it too. Man!!! I wonder what we were watching or what we were<br/>
on!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, there *are* smoke shops that allow people to light up.  And they<br/>
sometimes go a long time without being busted.  But there is no policy or<br/>
law that prevents the police from busting people in those shops, and<br/>
eventually they usually do.<br/>

It&#39;s all about control on the Administration&#39;s part ( surprise!) , and I hope <br/>
the Canadians do what&#39;s best for their citizens, and the Hay with the <br/>
US....lol<br/>
