<div id="ygrps-yiv-796975477">Dear Brooke,<br/>
<br/>
Like you, I live in a rural area, where we receive two broadcast networks<br/>
(poorly) and cable is still not available.  So when I had the opportunity to<br/>
get a dish, I jumped at the chance.  There are wonderful educational<br/>
offerings on some of the channels, but a lot of junk to sift through, also.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how satellite television differs in Canada from here in the<br/>
States, but our dish has several different packages at various prices.  I<br/>
think the smallest package includes Discovery, Learning Channel and the<br/>
History Channel.  Also Animal Planet, which my youngest adores.  If you get<br/>
the network package, it includes public television.  And for my older<br/>
children, the Independent Film Channel has foreign language movies, so they<br/>
can listen to French and Spanish.  A caveat, however, many of those movies<br/>
are NOT suitable for children--we watched a French comedy the other day<br/>
which I thought was hysterically funny, but I sent my youngest out of the<br/>
room.<br/>
<br/>

service, completely free, and the price is comparable to all the others.  I<br/>
looked into DISH network because they were offering free replacement, but<br/>
that&#39;s only on one box, one TV, after that it costs plenty--would have been<br/>
about $400 for me to switch over.  Primestar has now been bought out by<br/>
DirecTV, we are waiting for the changeover.  And we&#39;ll continue to lease,<br/>
not own the dish (so that means free service still).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry your experience was so bad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672482064">We live in a rural area and we can only get 1 station here unless I<br/>
subscribe to cable which is about $45 Cdn. a month. I would love to see the<br/>
Learning Channels and the Discovery and History  ones as well...however, I<br/>
refuse to pay for cable being that we rarely watch TV (maybe once or twice<br/>
a month).  It seems an exorbitant sum to pay for a few stations. <br/>
<br/>
IS there a dish you can get which allows you to pay for only the channels<br/>
you choose?? Any advise??   And which channels are worth having???<br/>

DishNetwork.  They used to allow pick and choose I think they&#39;ve gone to the <br/>
package thing though.  Anyway, they have a really good timer and lock out <br/>
system and the system itself the box and dish can be had for under $100.  <br/>
Plus, the pay per view movies are cheaper than the local video store.<br/>

I don&#39;t understand this...  I had primestar replaced by Dish, and it cost me <br/>
$200 for two television boxes.  I noticed that the system of a dish and one <br/>
converter is now under $100.  One of the other things I like about them is <br/>
that they offer the service of a free dish if you leave the dish you now own. <br/>
 Good practice since the next homeowner would already have their system <br/>
hooked up.<br/>

We have had Primestar for three years now without one single problem.  We<br/>
have called a few times with questions and the customer service has been<br/>
very polite and friendly.  We have complete control over channel lockouts,<br/>
rating lockouts, timers, etc.  By the way, our dish is fairly small.  It has<br/>
been great.  Maybe it has improved since you had it, Charlotte?<br/>

Wih these you have the advantage of hundreds of companies to get your <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>C-Band is also fondly known as &quot;BUD&quot; for Big Ugly Dish.  It&#39;s the kind of<br/>
satellite dish that originally was all there was, until just a few years<br/>
ago.  It moves, to point to whichever satellite you are choosing to watch<br/>
at the time (there are maybe 20 or so different ones up there).<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, the best thing about C-Band is what they call &quot;Wild feeds&quot;-<br/>
it&#39;s the way companies that sell programming to TV stations *get* the<br/>
programming to the stations.  The stations all have dishes and record<br/>
programming that way- and so can you.  Stuff comes on at very odd times,<br/>
though, so you have to try to figure out what is on when.  You can find<br/>
schedules, but they tend not to be up to date.<br/>
<br/>
The most fun wild feeds are not the regular tv shows- it&#39;s the news feeds.<br/>
Direct news feeds, the stuff that the networks use and stations cut down<br/>
for their own nightly news.  You get all of it, and if it&#39;s a big event,<br/>
you get nearly 24 hour raw footage coverage, unedited.<br/>
<br/>
You also get footage of &quot;off air&quot; stuff, which can be *very* funny.<br/>
Newspeople swatting bugs while waiting for the broadcast to officially<br/>
start, that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
You can get Canadian satellites, and in some parts of the country, you can<br/>
pick up the Mexican satellites, too (but not here).<br/>
<br/>
It costs more to get the system in the first place, but the programming<br/>
costs can be much less, and you get more stuff.  The wild feeds are all<br/>
free.  &quot;cable&quot; and premium channels still cost, as do networks.  There are<br/>
some restrictions on whether you can get the networks, a very odd law, but<br/>
that&#39;s an issue with the little digital dishes, too.<br/>
