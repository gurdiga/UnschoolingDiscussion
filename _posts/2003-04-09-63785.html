<div id="ygrps-yiv-532183575">I just wanted to share...<br/>
Kiele is really going strong with the Dinosaur thing, today we made a stegosaurus cake and later tonight we will be making our own fossils with some seashells that I have, they&#39;re going to come out so neat!  Yesterday we finished the dinosaur fossils that Nanna bought and it&#39;s the very first 19 inch Rainbow Tyrannosaurus Rex on our fridge! We have watched for the past 2 days walking with dinosaurs which if I have the money soon I will buy, because it really jumpstarted her interest,it&#39;s so real looking!  She has played in the bathtub with the dinosaurs, read about the dinosaurs, played and made her own dinosaur games, pretended to be numerous different dinosaurs, gone to the museum to see first hand how big the dinosaurs actually were, gone hiking on a trail full of fossils and geology (the study of the earth), found and brought home real fossils to examine, and right now is taking a nap with a pink stuffed dinosaur, maybe later I can help her to sew her very own stuffed dinosaur, just a thought....<br/>
    Now lets see all the &quot;academic&quot; stuff she has learned...<br/>
Reading about dinosaurs reading/spelling/grammar/literature/geography<br/>
Museum-field trip-/science/history/geography<br/>
Hiking on fossil trail-science/exercise/geology/<br/>
examining fossils-geology/paleontology <br/>
Baking a cake-math and home economics<br/>
sewing a dinosaur-math and home ecconomics<br/>
Playing dinosaur games and making her own- math, art<br/>
coloring dinosaur pictures-art, names of dinosaurs<br/>
Taking a bath with the dinosaurs- science( the dinosaurs float or sink)  personal hygene ( health)<br/>
counting dinosaur figures-math<br/>
pretending to be a dinosaur-acting<br/>
Watching dinosaur movies- learned the behavior, sizes, scientific names, geography of the land that they lived on and how they survived, how they died, when they lived, how they evolved, and oh what kind of food they ate.<br/>
I&#39;m sure she has learned more that I don&#39;t even know about, that&#39;s what I love about homeschooling, she&#39;s not bored with it and it&#39;s fun, not just some facts that someone is trying to spoon feed to her, but actually stuff that is interesting that makes her want to know, want to find out.  All of this just from dinosaurs, I love it!<br/>
