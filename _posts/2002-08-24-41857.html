 </span></blockquote>I was the one who asked him what he thought of your session and I did it <br/>
because I&#39;d been sitting next to him in the earlier &quot;Practicalities of <br/>
Unschooling&quot; session and I kept wondering what he thought.  He looked very <br/>
interested and he nodded a number of times (but he didn&#39;t laugh much - just <br/>
wry smiles).  And I was imagining that maybe he was having a major &quot;aha&quot; <br/>
experience about schooling in general.  He didn&#39;t say that though.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, he kept saying, &quot;I&#39;m not against schools; I&#39;m not against <br/>
homeschooling.&quot;  He said he was against the damage schools do but that <br/>
homeschooling parents could do damage too and maybe it would be even worse <br/>
because homeschooled kids wouldn&#39;t have other kids to complain to.<br/>
<br/>
That made me think a little.  I think most homeschoolers have in common a <br/>
desire to protect their family life.  But beyond that, as an unschooler, I <br/>
probably have more in common philosophically with Frank Smith, a <br/>
schoolteachers&#39; schoolteacher, than with school-at-home homeschoolers.  (And <br/>
that made me feel good because I loved Frank Smith&#39;s work when I read it <br/>
during my school teaching days.  Nice to know I was somewhat the same person <br/>
then as now.  And by the way, I was a teacher who did what I did for the <br/>
kids, as did many of my colleagues.  Frustrating system to work in but to <br/>
malign all teachers, Ned, no fair.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope, Sandra, that you did shift his thinking and that he gets it <br/>
about unschooling.  I&#39;m always a little impatient when I hear these great <br/>
progressive educators who are almost there but just don&#39;t seem to see the <br/>
little mind bridge they have to cross to unschooling.  (Alfie Kohn and Bev <br/>
Bos are two who come to mind.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Sandra, your workshops were great.  I really liked Peaceful <br/>
Parenting, both you and Richard.  Got to go mend a rift with my kid...(did <br/>
somebody say there was no screaming or hairpulling in unschooling <br/>
households?)<br/>

That&#39;s really true.  AND they won&#39;t have home as a haven after &quot;school&quot; is <br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But beyond that, as an unschooler, I <br/>
probably have more in common philosophically with Frank Smith, a <br/>
schoolteachers&#39; schoolteacher, than with school-at-home homeschoolers. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many times I&#39;ve gotten in trouble with politically-minded homeschoolers for <br/>
my unwillingness to &quot;band together&quot; (even socially, or philosophically on a <br/>
list) with all other homeschoolers.  Solidarity with school-at-home <br/>
homeschoolers doesn&#39;t appeal to me at all.  I feel my &quot;roots&quot; in open <br/>
classroom and freeschools and Socratic one-on-one inquiry (even in the most <br/>
formal Socratic sense of getting to a particular answer, which is some of how <br/>
I do my SCA mentoring, helping people move toward a specifically narrow view <br/>
of honor and chivalry, which isn&#39;t like unschooling my kids at all).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyway, I hope, Sandra, that you did shift his thinking and that he gets it <br/>

He came and talked to me, during the Peaceful Parenting talk.  I was out of <br/>
water and knew Richard was about to have a longish speech, so I went to the <br/>
water table.  I was reminded of this two days ago when I listened to the tape <br/>
of the talk with Richard Prystowsky.  At the end we didn&#39;t turn off the tape <br/>
recorder, so there&#39;s a bunch of chitchat near the podium, and I was telling <br/>
someone that he had come up and shaken my hand warmly and said he enjoyed my <br/>
talk.   <br/>
<br/>
About not quite getting unschooling, I think anyone who&#39;s still working in and<br/>
 with schools will have a hard time imagining unschooling for real, in <br/>
operation.  Their perspective is all bound up with &quot;schoolyears&quot; and &quot;behind&quot; <br/>
and &quot;ahead.&quot;  And even if the model could be made in one&#39;s head, in the <br/>
absence of really sinking into daily life with calm kids, could it be <br/>
imagined fully?<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s latest comeback is &quot;yeah, but...&quot; and although it&#39;s tiresome, I see <br/>
it as the way thinking works lots of times.  &quot;I accept the possibility, but <br/>
here are the immediate mental reactions.&quot;<br/>
