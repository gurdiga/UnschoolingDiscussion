 </span></blockquote>Peggy,  I agree.  I think maybe it does give them some empowerment to be able <br/>
to use the word casually.  But, I think that no matter how much they say it <br/>
among themselves.. when they get called the N word by a white person, its <br/>
painful.   And, yes, its shameful.   My dilema was trying to explain to my <br/>
children that it was OK for black people to say it, but not for white people. <br/>
 They had never heard it in a negative  way.  They had never heard a white <br/>
person call a  black person the N word out of hate or prejudice.  To JP.. <br/>
&quot;Nigger&quot; was an term, like &quot;buddy&quot;, &quot;homey&quot;  .. I really had to stress to him <br/>
that it was not nice.. it was downright ugly, hateful, when used by white <br/>
folks.  <br/>
