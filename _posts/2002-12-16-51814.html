&lt;&lt; Ethan is just 11.. Thats another factor in my feeling that he is not <br/>
&quot;ready&quot; <br/>
 for a go cart. . He has the NEED FOR SPEED &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But he feels ready, so couldn&#39;t there be compromise?<br/>
I would explain my concerns to my child and ask them how they could help me <br/>
feel more comfortable with a potentially dangerous vehicle.<br/>
I would find a go kart track, or somewhere he could have access without you <br/>
investing a fortune. Maybe even ask at a local track if he could hang out <br/>
with someone and learn about how it all operates....you never know where a <br/>
mentor could be found.<br/>
There are options always. It doesn&#39;t have to be all or nothing.<br/>

&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>
