<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715910771">O.K., the question is, how many folks are going to anti-up the intro $20 to<br/>
get their mail from this list sent to their Outlook Express or whatever Pop3<br/>
server and how many that aren&#39;t on web read are going to go to web read?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As far as I can tell from the Snopes site and Yahoo is that this is only <br/>
for people who use Yahoo email as in <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:leschke@...">leschke@...</a> and have been <br/>
getting it forwarded to a pop account.  I can&#39;t see anything in here that <br/>
says it applies to Yahoo Groups.  That&#39;s not to say it never will, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think the time is now.  Here&#39;s the Snopes article.<br/>
<br/>
Origins:   In mid-March 2002, those who had been availing themselves of <br/>
Yahoo!&#39;s free<br/>
        POP mail service received a shock in their inboxes, an announcement <br/>
from the<br/>
        company that as of 24 April 2002 those previously-free services <br/>
would continue to be<br/>
        available only to those willing to pay for them.<br/>
<br/>
        Beginning April 24, Yahoo! will charge $29.99 a year for this <br/>
feature. Those who sign up<br/>
        before that date can secure continuation of this service for $19.99 <br/>
per annum. Before<br/>
        anyone becomes overly confused on this point, remember that we&#39;re <br/>
talking strictly<br/>
        about POP (Post Office Protocol) e-mail accounts (a protocol that <br/>
allows desktop e-mail<br/>
        clients such as Eudora and Microsoft Outlook to download mail <br/>
messages from host<br/>
        systems to users&#39; PCs ). Non-POP e-mail accounts -- those accessed <br/>
by reading e-mail<br/>
        from Yahoo! via a web browser -- will still be free.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-19956616">Yes, I got an email from them because I do use their pop3 services for <br/>
my business acc&#39;t so I can get mail while traveling. I thought it also <br/>
pertained to the groups. I suppose for now it doesn&#39;t.. but time will <br/>
tell... <br/>
<br/>
Reading mail off of a yahoo account is a drag!!!<br/>

<br/>
The only annoying change I know about is the ads on one list I&#39;m on are now<br/>
at the top of each email rather than the bottom. Is that what you&#39;re talking<br/>
about?<br/>
<br/>
Digest eliminates those but of course adds it&#39;s own annoyances.<br/>
<br/>
You (general you) can eliminate the ones you send by setting preferences to<br/>
no HTML at the website and on the mail program you use. That doesn&#39;t<br/>
eliminate the ones other people send though. And quoting someone&#39;s email<br/>
with ads can on some email programs automatically turn HTML back on.<br/>

I read from the web with a 56K modem.  Maybe once a week I am annoyed <br/>
by something loading too slow, but for the most part it is not a <br/>
problem because I open several browsers and lists at once and rotate <br/>
across them.  That way, while I&#39;m reading one post, the others are <br/>
loading.<br/>
<br/>
It really is not that bad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321815574">Well, we&#39;ve used the POP3 at yahoo for years, but with this, and since we<br/>
already had cable modem and the included email accounts just sitting there,<br/>
we switched addresses. (Now <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kbmatlock@...">kbmatlock@...</a>, FWIW).<br/>
<br/>
But I often read off the web when I&#39;m away or to catch up. If you&#39;ll look at<br/>
the message archives, there&#39;s a spot to click &quot;expand messages&quot; and then you<br/>
can scroll and read as fast as you want without those horrible ads tripping<br/>
you up on your way to the message. Much easier, at least until they plug<br/>
*that* loophole.<br/>
