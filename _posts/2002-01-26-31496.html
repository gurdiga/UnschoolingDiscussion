<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288807922">I just want to say that I don&#39;t think TV has any effect on my children much<br/>
at all, other than exposing them to many things they wouldn&#39;t be exposed to<br/>
otherwise.  But I do think that long periods of sedentary behavior makes one<br/>
feel stiff, draggy, tired, etc..  When my oldest began moderating her TV, it<br/>
was more of adding in more fun stuff rather than simply turning off the TV.<br/>
She began to spend more time outside with her animals, working out, playing<br/>
games, etc..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032590668">I agree.  My  oldest two don&#39;t really watch much TV anymore at all.  <br/>
They read and play on the computer a lot.  Rachel especially needs to <br/>
make a conscious effort to get physical activity or she gets groggy <br/>
and dopey.<br/>
And I think that is true for most (but not all) people.  <br/>
