<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I do buy an advent calender for each of them, which they get a treat from<br/>
&gt;&gt; every day<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We get the coolest advent calenders in Germany.  The obvious chocolate ones,<br/>
picture ones, lego, playmobile, horses, cars, kindereier (chocolate eggs<br/>
with a very cool toy inside), all sorts of stuff.  Even got a free one from<br/>
McDonalds, which thrills Tim for reasons I don&#39;t understand.  The child is a<br/>
vegetarian and also hates french fries.  There isn&#39;t a thing at that place<br/>
he even eats!  Even the salads here all have mean on them.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re doing lego again this year, because Tim begged really pretty, but I&#39;d<br/>
prefer something a little more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll all go on sale after Christmas for really, really cheap.  Anybody<br/>
want me to look for one for them for next year?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found one a couple of years ago that had a different little books for each <br/>
day. My 13dd and 11ds love to hear the stories -- excerpts from Christmas <br/>
Carol, Little Women, folk tales, poems. It&#39;s one of those items that I&#39;ll <br/>
hand down one day.<br/>
<br/>
When we were stationed in Italy we get beautiful handmade calendars. My <br/>
sister still has some of them.<br/>
