even if it&#39;s 90 degrees, and that sucks.  <br/>
<br/>
My son is going to miss his friends!  He&#39;s been playing outside all day, <br/>
every day all summer.  He hates waiting for them to come home, watches the clock <br/>
like a hawk. <br/>
<br/>
But I LOVE the school supply sales....I bought glue and pencils and pens and <br/>
Mead Composition pads, oh my!  hee hee A drawing pad, construction paper, and <br/>
a corkboard....just too much fun, all that good stuff, to pass it up.  School <br/>
shopping was the only thing I ever liked about school.  ;-) No reason for me <br/>
to give that up, right? <br/>
