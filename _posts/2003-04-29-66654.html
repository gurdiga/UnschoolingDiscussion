<br/>
I would much rather you had not responded at all and done some of the other <br/>
reading and experimenting.  But the post you responded to had specific <br/>
recommendations of how I thought you could really show that you were paying <br/>
attention and appreciated the advice, and you blew that off to come and give <br/>
us more of the same same same same old same.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, it did seem argumentative.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to unschool?  Then you need to try some of the things we&#39;ve been <br/>
recommending.<br/>
Do you want others to be glad you&#39;re on this list?  Then don&#39;t post so much.<br/>
Do you want to just see your own words in writing?  Then keep a journal or <br/>
e-mail yourself.<br/>

part of the problem you are having here, Glena?<br/>
There is also a lot of yelling with capitals in your posts, make them seem a <br/>
little over the top. I am following this with interest, but find all the <br/>
emphasis with capitals hurts my head.<br/>
