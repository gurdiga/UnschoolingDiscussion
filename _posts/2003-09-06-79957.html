<div id="ygrps-yiv-494553637">The girls (age 8 ) have discovered the wonder of -Ordering books  on the interlibrary  computer (for lack of the correct terms :0))<br/>
For the past  few months  I  have been helping them  sort  out the nec. steps to find  books  by subject and to put in their library card no.  etc. Then the computer-voice lady phones our home -repeatedly and repeatedly-(we have the four of us ordering books-and being advised of overdues)  until we answer and hear  the  &quot;drone lady&quot; -for a long time it was a &quot;scary<br/>
 drone man voice and I understand some people were so freaked out at answering the phone and  hearing this that they changed it to  a female voice. <br/>
The first time that Stephanie answered the phone  and heard this (last year)  and didnt receive an answer to her inquiry she burst into tears.<br/>
  Going away last week meant  16  Library calls  on the call-display.<br/>
So now  &quot;going to the library&quot; means getting called back to spell words or help pin down a subject every time I try to sneak away  among the stacks. On Thursday Kara wanted to know how to order a book that would tell how to wash a white horse......:0)<br/>
Their last order included adult mysteries (found under the &quot;cats&quot; heading and books on Reining  from the horse section and an old book with photos of some rather  horrendous  skin diseases -obviously from the &quot;Dogs&quot; subject listing.<br/>
they are having a lot of fun with this-we presently have 9 Scooby  Doo  chapter books.<br/>
 We have great librarians  who are just observing  what they are doing and running some of the stranger  selections by me first.<br/>
They  are quite ok knowing they are just playing &quot;ordering&quot; and  cant really read much of most of them.<br/>
Going in with their own cards to pick up their &quot;orders&quot;  has lots of appeal.<br/>
When they hear a few parents  tell their kids-&quot;no, you  can&#39;t take anymore books -you already have two&quot; they just stare in amazement.<br/>
Anyway-like the lady said....they sure don&#39;t need any pushing to try using the  stuff out there  if it looks interesting  and they see other kids and adults  using  books-dictionaries-micro-fiche etc and   nec help is there if they ask for it.<br/>
