<div id="ygrps-yiv-335948553">Emily gets so much makeup for gifts, she has more than I do, And I&#39;m an Avon <br/>
Lady!<br/>
Just before I started as one, I realized that I wasn&#39;t paying enough <br/>
attention to my outside appearance, which for me is indicative of my inside. <br/>
So I started playing more with makeup and taking better care of my skin. The <br/>
new skin care regimen has done more for my feling good than makeup. I have <br/>
rotten skin so it&#39;s been nice to see it change.<br/>
I also like all the colors, purple eyeliner, seafoam green eyeshadow. It&#39;s a <br/>
blast!<br/>
I&#39;m so shallow. lOL<br/>
