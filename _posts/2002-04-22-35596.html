WOW! I just did! And I heartily suggest many here try the list out. There is<br/>
one discussion going on right now that many here would be very interested in<br/>
as it is about them!!! The thread is titled &quot;Structure&quot; and &quot;words and<br/>
definitions&quot;. It&#39;s all archieved.<br/>
Absolutely fascinating discussion. What was particularly interesting to me<br/>
was the failure of the listmembers to observe the very rules of Netiquette<br/>
that I was recently given such a hard time about violating on this list, by<br/>
them!<br/>

I can&#39;t agree with this. There are people here who are sabatoging any<br/>
attempt to create a sense of community by the list members. Purposely.<br/>
Why?<br/>

*Build* the community. *Don&#39;t* spend energy pointing out who doesn&#39;t appear<br/>

Let me judge and handle what is harming the building. Just because something<br/>
doesn&#39;t get said on the list doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not being handled.<br/>

You are right Joyce. and I don&#39;t know what is and isn&#39;t being addressed, I<br/>
just get angry when people who are here for the reason of being helpful get<br/>
maligned.<br/>

Netiquette.  That would be me.  And, obviously I was correct in my<br/>
