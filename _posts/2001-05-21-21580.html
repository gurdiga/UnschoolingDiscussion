<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197911147"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m at home with my 4 year old daughter .......do<br/>
&gt;worry about socialization. We also go to the park and<br/>
&gt;to story time at the library, so she does get <br/>
&gt;to interact/play with other kids, but there&#39;s not the<br/>
&gt;regular contact with a set of friends yet (we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;working on that).<br/>
&gt;--Pete<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a 3 year old and a 4 year old whom I am at<br/>
home with full time.  We used to have a regular<br/>
&quot;palygroup&quot; once a week, but we quit going for a<br/>
number of reasons, not the least of which being that<br/>
it was TOO MUCH socialization for both the boys.  My<br/>
shy and easy going child was overwhelmed, cried and<br/>
hid.  My outgoing and hyperactive child was<br/>
overstimulated and had melt downs.  Now we rely on<br/>
weekly visits with one other family of two kids, whom<br/>
we all get along with great, as well as occassional<br/>
visits to the park and neighbors, and multi year<br/>
visits with cousins.  <br/>
<br/>
Frankly I would not lament too much that there are not<br/>
more kids your daughter&#39;s age in the neighborhood if I<br/>
were you.  I have never been too impressed with the<br/>
public schooled neighbor kids behaviors around here.  <br/>
<br/>
Nor do I think an excess of socialization is required<br/>
for a child that age to be healthy and well developed<br/>
socially.  I think just a few friends with whom they<br/>
spend time occassionally is great for this age.  I<br/>
mean, kids this age are still mastering their social<br/>
skills and focusing mostly on family relationships. <br/>
Too many social encounters will leave a child that age<br/>
stressed and exhausted.  I know it does mine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498824354">I totally agree with Nancy.  One suggestion I have is I just found a girl scout troup on one of<br/>
the Homeschooling Sites I&#39;m a memer of that only meets twice a month.  My daughter is really<br/>
enjoying that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862024145">Ok, so maybe I&#39;m not the only one out there that is alone in a park actually<br/>
watching my dd&#39;s. I thought I was a scarry monster or something that people were<br/>
trying to avoid me. (and since I really never make the attempt to join a circle,<br/>
I usually can be found on the park bench alone) Makes me sort of happy that I am<br/>
actually given the time to watch them at play.  And I agree with you, I would<br/>
not let my dd&#39;s play with that child either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The homeschooled kids haven&#39;t impressed me much either at<br/>
times.  The dynamics of one group (unfortunately the one<br/>
where my children&#39;s friends are) is not one I really like.<br/>
The mothers of the children sit in a circle and talk; the<br/>
children play.  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter if their child is<br/>
2 or 12 - little adult supervision is provided!  I try to<br/>
stay near my children but with two it&#39;s hard to be in several<br/>
places at the same time.  It would be nice if there were more<br/>
adults in the playground area.  New mothers come to the group<br/>
and either leave or start sitting in the circle leaving their<br/>
littles to fend for themselves - or get groused at for needing<br/>
their mother&#39;s attention!<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago a 11 year old child tried to choke and<br/>
push an 8 year old off a fairly tall play structure (5 feet high<br/>
at least).  She was his best friend&#39;s sister and he seems to have<br/>
some issues - not the first time he&#39;s done things to his friends&#39;<br/>
siblings.  His mother went and talked to him - and then came back<br/>
to the circle and paid no attention to him the rest of the time<br/>
there!  Maybe I&#39;m an overprotective mother but this really, really<br/>
disturbed me.  I was talking to the 8 year old 10+ minutes after<br/>
the incident and she told me her neck still hurt.  My children will<br/>
not be near this child without me being there - ever!<br/>
