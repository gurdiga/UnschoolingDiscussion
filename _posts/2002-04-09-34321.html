<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191671415">&quot;She said she likes it when I <br/>
teach her things because I&#39;m smart and I know about a lot of stuff she<br/>
wants <br/>
to learn.&quot;<br/>
That sounds like unschooling to me.  I think if we present information or<br/>
a topic, but they aren&#39;t interested, and we force it, then it&#39;s not<br/>
unschooling.  If they come to us seeking knowledge about an area, and we<br/>
know something about it and talk about it with them and show them what we<br/>
know and refer them to outside sources, I would call that unschooling.  I<br/>
do not think requiring them to do it on a daily basis at a certain time<br/>
is unschooling.<br/>
Textbooks can be a great learning tool.  My boys use math textbooks. <br/>
Because they are interested in it.  But when they don&#39;t feel like it,<br/>
they aren&#39;t reprimanded or lectured.  I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; it the way they do<br/>
in school with practice sets and problems and speed drills.  But if they<br/>
don&#39;t understand something it says and come to me for help, I teach in<br/>
the sense that I guide them in a way that helps them to understand what<br/>
it is saying.  Mostly, they just come up with stuff I would never think<br/>
they would think of, and it leads us to search out more information on<br/>
it.<br/>
I&#39;m not that smart and I can&#39;t teach my kids about veterinary stuff.  But<br/>
I do know a vet who would allow my child to hang out and help at his<br/>
clinic.  He was a friend of my dad.  Hands on is so much more interesting<br/>
than books, at least for some children.  It depends how much the child<br/>
likes to read, I suppose.  (I love books, but my son would probably<br/>
prefer hands on-why not both?)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize that the kids ran the whole show in unschooling,<br/>
working <br/>
only on their own initiative and only with their own direction. Boy it<br/>
sure <br/>
would be appealling to my lazy side because I wouldn&#39;t have to do hardly <br/>
anything!&quot;<br/>
First of all, it is about the child taking charge of their own education,<br/>
but it is not about work, it is about passion.  If we have a job we love<br/>
and feel called to do, it does not feel like work, but like fun.  It is<br/>
the same for a child who is pursuing his interests.  As for being lazy,<br/>
how is it lazy to take time to listen to a child and help them to pursue<br/>
their interests, or allow them the time to finish studying or reading the<br/>
subject that pleases them without saying time to stop before they are<br/>
ready.  I find it takes a lot of energy, and is in fact now a way of life<br/>
for me to be so focused on my children.<br/>
&quot;After being on this list for a couple of weeks I see that my parental <br/>
philosophy is very much in conflict with unschooling.  It would be<br/>
useless <br/>
for me to state my feelings or beliefs here and, as said before by<br/>
someone <br/>
else the other day, it isn&#39;t allowed or appreciated.&quot;<br/>
Only two weeks?  Why wouldn&#39;t your beliefs be allowed?  Just because<br/>
someone else doesn&#39;t agree doesn&#39;t mean your opinion is not valid.  We<br/>
all have our reasons for doing what we do how we do it.  Maybe someone<br/>
here would have an idea you&#39;ve never really considered before.  If we<br/>
were all shy of offending others with our views, no one would get any new<br/>
information.  Sometimes our beliefs have to be challenged for us to<br/>
really understand why we are doing things the way we are.<br/>
&quot;ultimately we are all accountable for our own responsibility that God<br/>
entrusted to us when he gave us these precious gifts: our children.&quot;<br/>
I certainly agree with you there.  When I first came to this group, I<br/>
sort of felt the same way.  Everyone, it seemed, was fighting about what<br/>
was and wasn&#39;t unschooling.  It really turned me off to the concept, even<br/>
though I had read some books that intrigued me. However, after<br/>
homeschooling a while, I realized that the principles of unschooling made<br/>
sense and came to believe they were actually right for my children and<br/>
me.  I came back because I couldn&#39;t get enough dialogues on the other<br/>
groups to supply me with the kind of info I was looking for.  I talked to<br/>
my children about the ideas I was hearing, and they identified with them.<br/>
 These principles made sense to me according to the Bible, and opened my<br/>
eyes to completely new ways of raising my family.  I feel that I am more<br/>
of a Christian in the way I relate to my children now than ever before. <br/>
And all as a result of what I&#39;ve learned from unschooling.  One thing<br/>
I&#39;ve come to learn is that God exposes me to different ideas and concepts<br/>
and expects me to give them more than a cursory glance before making up<br/>
my mind.  I have tested this unschooling method by scripture and it has<br/>
been found weighty and true.  I have noticed scriptures that never meant<br/>
that much to me before, but now clearly reflect unschooling ideas.  One<br/>
of them is how to teach your children.  While sitting with them, walking<br/>
with them, etc.  One of them is how Jesus taught his disciples, while<br/>
walking, while eating, while visiting, etc.<br/>
Anyway,sorry you feel this way.  I wish you and your daughter the best of<br/>
everything.  God bless.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839970805">Dear Kristine:<br/>
<br/>
I believe the way you and your daughter are seeing to her education is right<br/>
for you and her.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, like Homeschooling or private schooling or public schooling is<br/>
the right thing for some people, not for all people.  I have known people<br/>
that have thrived in each and every one of those at some time in their<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you and your daughter all the best.  And I hope that in the future I<br/>
have the opportunity to hear what  you are doing or she is doing or some of<br/>
the insights you have picked up along your journey.  I am sure that there<br/>
will be all kinds of things that you could share with us, your joys, your<br/>
experiences, what are some of the things you both have learned or how<br/>
something has been learned.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that in public school, ISPs, Homeschooling or Unschooling there<br/>
is no right way or wrong way, everyone does it their way - just like<br/>
parenting and living and learning :).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your well wishes and I in return also wish you well.  I know<br/>
you will do the best for your daughter.  You obviously love her very much to<br/>
take the time to see to it that she gets the most out of her education.<br/>
<br/>
Fare the well on these seas,<br/>
<br/>
Joan<br/>

Stating your feelings or beliefs here would be allowed, of course, and <br/>
probably appreciated by some people and not by others &lt;G&gt;.  If you wrote <br/>
posts here, criticising unschooling, you&#39;d probably get some pretty strong <br/>
reactions defending it. If you asked questions, you&#39;d be more likely to get <br/>
honest but reasoned responses.<br/>
<br/>
 Even people who don&#39;t like the idea of unschooling and have no interest in <br/>
doing it themselves sometimes like to hang out with unschoolers because <br/>
unschoolers tend to be passionate and interesting (if sometimes rather <br/>
contentious) people who have LOTS of ideas. Unschoolers don&#39;t usually mind <br/>
other homeschoolers hangin&#39; out with them but don&#39;t like to have to defend <br/>
themselves and justify their unschooling and can be pretty sensitive to <br/>
insinuations that they are depriving their children of an adequate education <br/>
or are lazy, etc.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; She wants to be a vet and college is in her future.  That means she needs <br/>

<br/>
My unschooled 14 and 17 yo&#39;s both go to college now. The 17 yo has completed <br/>
60-something units and has a 3.8+ grade point average.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think you controlled her into saying it - I think she probably can&#39;t <br/>
envision how it would work, though. It is HARD to really catch that <br/>
&quot;unschooling vision.&quot; It is SO different than the way we&#39;ve always thought <br/>
about learning. For example, the idea that she would be prevented from <br/>
learning what she needs to learn to go to vet school is wrong. Truth is, if <br/>
she has a goal of vet school and knows that she needs to study certain <br/>
subjects to make that happen, then that is exactly what an unschooling kid <br/>
would do. And they&#39;d get help from parents and other adults to teach them or <br/>
help them get the resources they need to learn what they need to learn to <br/>
achieve their goals. Parents don&#39;t sit back and do NOTHING. They pay close <br/>
attention and interact and discuss and offer resources and information and <br/>
help and support.<br/>
<br/>
 It also sounds like she didn&#39;t think you could &quot;teach&quot; her anything if she <br/>
unschooled.  <br/>
<br/>
Just to help clarify that unschooling parents and other adults and other kids <br/>
often &quot;teach&quot; things, my kids and I spent well over an hour today with me <br/>
explaining our political system to them - in greater detail than we&#39;ve ever <br/>
done before - and they asked a lot of questions and I answered the best I <br/>
could and then came home and got on the internet and looked up more answers.<br/>
<br/>
And, my younger two kids and I went out to breakfast and we sat there for <br/>
over an hour talking about probability theory -- starting with one daughter <br/>
pondering how to figure out the probability that you&#39;d roll five dice and get <br/>
the same number on all of them (we&#39;d been playing Yahtzee earlier). I&#39;m a <br/>
statistician and I taught them all about probability, writing on napkins, and <br/>
then we moved on to hypothesis testing and got well into stuff that I teach <br/>
my college students. They were interested - I wouldn&#39;t have kept going if <br/>
they weren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is that I didn&#39;t plan this in advance - today wasn&#39;t scheduled <br/>
as the day for government and statistics lessons. It was scheduled as &quot;go out <br/>
to breakfast and talk about whatever comes up&quot; day &lt;G&gt;. And there won&#39;t be <br/>
any test. What they got out of it, they got. It&#39;ll add up with other stuff <br/>
they learn and they&#39;ll continue to amaze me with how well they connect things <br/>
and integrate new ideas. My daughter taught ME something today too -- she <br/>
gave me a nice lecture about Pluto and the debate about whether it ought to <br/>
be classified as a planet or asteroid. She knew a LOT and I had never even <br/>
heard of the debate. I also looked that up when we got home and her facts <br/>
were correct - there is stuff all over the internet about it, but I just had <br/>
never noticed. Teaching happens! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Kristine, if we didn&#39;t think unschooling was better, we&#39;d do what we DID <br/>
think was better, wouldn&#39;t we? You think your way is better, so you&#39;re going <br/>
to do that, right? Although this is a list where you&#39;re going to hear <br/>
unschooling defended, I&#39;m sure that there are people who think unschooling is <br/>
damaging our kids. Someone just TODAY told me they thought that unschooled <br/>
kids don&#39;t learn to take direction from others and that that will hurt them <br/>
in the future. I don&#39;t agree, obviously, but that&#39;s their opinion. It can be <br/>
discomfitting to read other peoples&#39; negative opinions about what we choose <br/>
to do, but there will always be people who disagree with our choices and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t hurt us to give them some consideration even if we continue to feel <br/>
confident moving in our own different direction.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;When we think that our way is the only way then we leave room for Big<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Brother  to step in and become the only way for all of us, even if it is <br/>
against<br/>
the  will of some of us.  That, to me, is public school in a nutshell.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t entirely follow this - I mean, no unschooler thinks unschooling is <br/>
the only way - we see other ways all around us all the time. Also, forcing <br/>
people to unschool against their will is a contradiction in terms. Can&#39;t be <br/>
done. If you meant that we might think it is the only RIGHT way - that is a <br/>
trickier question. For me, it isn&#39;t a matter of what is right or wrong, but <br/>
that I think unschooling is more in line with the nature of how most children <br/>
would learn best IF they started early and if the parents could handle it. <br/>
But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s realistic for most families and I would not say that <br/>
unschooling is the best way for everyone. What I would say is simply that it <br/>
is possible - that nobody HAS to do &quot;school-at-home&quot; if they don&#39;t want to. <br/>
It is possible to NOT do schoolish stuff and the kids can still live <br/>
wonderful, learning, enriched, stimulating lives and they can go on to become <br/>
happy, competent adults and achieve success in ANY way they define it <br/>
(including going to college and professional schools, etc, if that is their <br/>
goal). Nothing is ruled OUT by unschooling. <br/>

Learning things in text books is not against the unschooling <br/>
philosophy.  If a child wants to learn something or has decided on a <br/>
future goal;  any way they choose to follow up, should be respected.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My own child, without telling her how I felt about it, asked me <br/>
 </span></blockquote>first what I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thought of unschooling (we&#39;ve checked out some information <br/>
 </span></blockquote>together.)  She <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; felt like it wasn&#39;t what she would want to do.  She said she likes <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it when I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; teach her things because I&#39;m smart and I know about a lot of stuff <br/>
 </span></blockquote>she wants <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to learn.  I know that some of you will read this and think I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>controlled her <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; into saying this.&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you controlled her into saying that.  My kids like me <br/>
to teach them stuff too.  I offer all the time.  So does my husband <br/>
and my mom and lots of people who know things that they don&#39;t.<br/>
My dd wants to be an actor/director(among some other things).  I help <br/>
her in that goal, by finding plays in the area she can do, taking her <br/>
to performances, finding books she may like....as she gets older, <br/>
we&#39;ll start talking more about where she wants to go with this, and <br/>
I&#39;ll help her find other resources.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Doesn&#39;t matter to me because ultimately we are all <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; accountable for our own responsibility that God entrusted to us <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when he gave <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; us these precious gifts: our children.<br/>
&gt; I wish you and your children well in unschooling, just as I would <br/>
 </span></blockquote>think that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the people here who can &quot;trust the children to do the learning&quot; can <br/>
 </span></blockquote>also <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trust other parents to provide an excellent education by <br/>
 </span></blockquote>homeschooling and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wish me well also. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wish you well.  <br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;I sense though, after being onlist here for the time I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have been, that the posters I have read really don&#39;t believe my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>girl will get <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; an excellent education, that she will be damaged in self-esteem and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be robbed <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of a love of learning, and that is sad.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s sad if it&#39;s true.  <br/>
Many people think that about our choice of education.  I&#39;m confident <br/>
in what we are doing, and others opinions, especially ignorant <br/>
opinions, don&#39;t bother me.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When we think that our way is the only way then we leave room for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Big Brother <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to step in and become the only way for all of us, even if it is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>against the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; will of some of us.  That, to me, is public school in a nutshell.  <br/>
&gt; Kristine&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think &quot;we&quot; have nearly enough power to influence Big Brother,<br/>
but I certainly wouldn&#39;t mind if *more* people thought like I do.<br/>
It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t.  None of my friends think like I do either.  <br/>
I&#39;m use to it.<br/>
That&#39;s why I love this board and unschooling.com.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect a great deal of the frustration in these types of discussions<br/>
comes from not understanding how the term unschooling gets defined *here*.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unfortunate that unschooling gets used out in the general public<br/>
differently than John Holt used the word in his later books. (Just using him<br/>
as a point of reference rather than the final word.) So people arrive here<br/>
looking for support for what they feel is unschooling only to be told<br/>
they&#39;re wrong. :-/<br/>
<br/>
But the wrongness isn&#39;t in what they are doing! The wrongness is in not<br/>
being clear before someone joins about how unschooling gets used here.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is happily doing whatever they&#39;re doing, then it&#39;s annoying to be<br/>
bombarded with questions asking them to dig into the reasons for doing what<br/>
they&#39;re doing. I hope a new description of the list will be less misleading.<br/>
<br/>
(And just so it doesn&#39;t feel like we&#39;re doing nothing, I think we&#39;re down to<br/>
wrangling over one last sentence ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Which isn&#39;t to say we can&#39;t have a rousing good discussion about why<br/>
unschoolers do what we do and reject what we&#39;ve rejected :-) But it should<br/>
be done with people who are honestly questioning, not people who&#39;ve been<br/>
mislead into believing we&#39;re all using the same definition of unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
  Stating your feelings or beliefs here would be allowed, of course, and <br/>
  probably appreciated by some people and not by others &lt;G&gt;.  If you wrote <br/>
  posts here, criticising unschooling, you&#39;d probably get some pretty strong <br/>
  reactions defending it. If you asked questions, you&#39;d be more likely to get <br/>
  honest but reasoned responses.<br/>
<br/>
  Even people who don&#39;t like the idea of unschooling and have no interest in <br/>
  doing it themselves sometimes like to hang out with unschoolers because <br/>
  unschoolers tend to be passionate and interesting (if sometimes rather <br/>
  contentious) people who have LOTS of ideas. Unschoolers don&#39;t usually mind <br/>
  other homeschoolers hangin&#39; out with them but don&#39;t like to have to defend <br/>
  themselves and justify their unschooling and can be pretty sensitive to <br/>
  insinuations that they are depriving their children of an adequate education <br/>
  or are lazy, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t realize that the kids ran the whole show in unschooling, working<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt; She wants to be a vet and college is in her future.  That means she needs <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  to learn things that are in textbooks.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  My unschooled 14 and 17 yo&#39;s both go to college now. The 17 yo has completed <br/>
  60-something units and has a 3.8+ grade point average.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;My own child, without telling her how I felt about it, asked me first what <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I thought of unschooling (we&#39;ve checked out some information together.)  She <br/>
  felt like it wasn&#39;t what she would want to do.  She said she likes it when I <br/>
  teach her things because I&#39;m smart and I know about a lot of stuff she wants <br/>
  to learn.  I know that some of you will read this and think I controlled her <br/>
  into saying this.  Doesn&#39;t matter to me because ultimately we are all <br/>
  accountable for our own responsibility that God entrusted to us when he gave <br/>
  us these precious gifts: our children.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think you controlled her into saying it - I think she probably can&#39;t <br/>
  envision how it would work, though. It is HARD to really catch that <br/>
  &quot;unschooling vision.&quot; It is SO different than the way we&#39;ve always thought <br/>
  about learning. For example, the idea that she would be prevented from <br/>
  learning what she needs to learn to go to vet school is wrong. Truth is, if <br/>
  she has a goal of vet school and knows that she needs to study certain <br/>
  subjects to make that happen, then that is exactly what an unschooling kid <br/>
  would do. And they&#39;d get help from parents and other adults to teach them or <br/>
  help them get the resources they need to learn what they need to learn to <br/>
  achieve their goals. Parents don&#39;t sit back and do NOTHING. They pay close <br/>
  attention and interact and discuss and offer resources and information and <br/>
  help and support.<br/>
<br/>
  It also sounds like she didn&#39;t think you could &quot;teach&quot; her anything if she <br/>
  unschooled.  <br/>
<br/>
  Just to help clarify that unschooling parents and other adults and other kids <br/>
  often &quot;teach&quot; things, my kids and I spent well over an hour today with me <br/>
  explaining our political system to them - in greater detail than we&#39;ve ever <br/>
  done before - and they asked a lot of questions and I answered the best I <br/>
  could and then came home and got on the internet and looked up more answers.<br/>
<br/>
  And, my younger two kids and I went out to breakfast and we sat there for <br/>
  over an hour talking about probability theory -- starting with one daughter <br/>
  pondering how to figure out the probability that you&#39;d roll five dice and get <br/>
  the same number on all of them (we&#39;d been playing Yahtzee earlier). I&#39;m a <br/>
  statistician and I taught them all about probability, writing on napkins, and <br/>
  then we moved on to hypothesis testing and got well into stuff that I teach <br/>
  my college students. They were interested - I wouldn&#39;t have kept going if <br/>
  they weren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  The difference is that I didn&#39;t plan this in advance - today wasn&#39;t scheduled <br/>
  as the day for government and statistics lessons. It was scheduled as &quot;go out <br/>
  to breakfast and talk about whatever comes up&quot; day &lt;G&gt;. And there won&#39;t be <br/>
  any test. What they got out of it, they got. It&#39;ll add up with other stuff <br/>
  they learn and they&#39;ll continue to amaze me with how well they connect things <br/>
  and integrate new ideas. My daughter taught ME something today too -- she <br/>
  gave me a nice lecture about Pluto and the debate about whether it ought to <br/>
  be classified as a planet or asteroid. She knew a LOT and I had never even <br/>
  heard of the debate. I also looked that up when we got home and her facts <br/>
  were correct - there is stuff all over the internet about it, but I just had <br/>
  never noticed. Teaching happens! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;I wish you and your children well in unschooling, just as I would think<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  that the people here who can &quot;trust the children to do the learning&quot; can also <br/>
  trust other parents to provide an excellent education by homeschooling and <br/>
  wish me well also.  &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I wish everybody well. Honestly.<br/>
<br/>

  education, that she will be  damaged in self-esteem and be robbed of a love <br/>
  of learning, and that is sad.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Kristine, if we didn&#39;t think unschooling was better, we&#39;d do what we DID <br/>
  think was better, wouldn&#39;t we? You think your way is better, so you&#39;re going <br/>
  to do that, right? Although this is a list where you&#39;re going to hear <br/>
  unschooling defended, I&#39;m sure that there are people who think unschooling is <br/>
  damaging our kids. Someone just TODAY told me they thought that unschooled <br/>
  kids don&#39;t learn to take direction from others and that that will hurt them <br/>
  in the future. I don&#39;t agree, obviously, but that&#39;s their opinion. It can be <br/>
  discomfitting to read other peoples&#39; negative opinions about what we choose <br/>
  to do, but there will always be people who disagree with our choices and it <br/>
  doesn&#39;t hurt us to give them some consideration even if we continue to feel <br/>
  confident moving in our own different direction.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;When we think that our way is the only way then we leave room for Big<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Brother  to step in and become the only way for all of us, even if it is <br/>
  against<br/>
  the  will of some of us.  That, to me, is public school in a nutshell.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t entirely follow this - I mean, no unschooler thinks unschooling is <br/>
  the only way - we see other ways all around us all the time. Also, forcing <br/>
  people to unschool against their will is a contradiction in terms. Can&#39;t be <br/>
  done. If you meant that we might think it is the only RIGHT way - that is a <br/>
  trickier question. For me, it isn&#39;t a matter of what is right or wrong, but <br/>
  that I think unschooling is more in line with the nature of how most children <br/>
  would learn best IF they started early and if the parents could handle it. <br/>
  But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s realistic for most families and I would not say that <br/>
  unschooling is the best way for everyone. What I would say is simply that it <br/>
  is possible - that nobody HAS to do &quot;school-at-home&quot; if they don&#39;t want to. <br/>
  It is possible to NOT do schoolish stuff and the kids can still live <br/>
  wonderful, learning, enriched, stimulating lives and they can go on to become <br/>
  happy, competent adults and achieve success in ANY way they define it <br/>
  (including going to college and professional schools, etc, if that is their <br/>
  goal). Nothing is ruled OUT by unschooling. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kristine, this list has gone through some incredible upheavals in the <br/>
last few months, problems which at times have led some of us to <br/>
wonder if the list was worth maintaining. Happily - for me and I hope <br/>
for many others - we&#39;ve been able to work through the problems and <br/>
find common ground from which to rebuild community. It hasn&#39;t been <br/>
easy. If you&#39;ve only been onlist for a couple of weeks you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
know about any of that unless you read the archives, and much of what <br/>
goes on here, cloaked as it is in list history and baggage, might <br/>
give a person the wrong impression about some of us.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still working on rebuilding this list - right now the <br/>
moderators and I have been fine-tuning a new welcome message so <br/>
people have some idea what this list is about when they join it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I didn&#39;t realize that the kids ran the whole show in unschooling, working<br/>
&gt;only on their own initiative and only with their own direction.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a very fair analysis of unschooling. It <br/>
certainly doesn&#39;t fit my family&#39;s description anyway. Sounds more <br/>
like a recipe for &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I want more for my girl though.  She wants to be a vet and college is in her<br/>
&gt;future.  That means she needs to learn things that are in textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My unschoolers have learned *plenty* of things that are in textbooks, <br/>
but it&#39;s been in their own way, on their own timetable, and because <br/>
they *wanted* to. Our oldest son studied carpentry texts (the kind <br/>
they have on the job) and codebooks when he was working on steel <br/>
frame buildings in Alaska. He learned enough to be made foreman of a <br/>
20-man crew; quit to start his own business two years ago. Our second <br/>
son did the same thing when he decided to become an industrial <br/>
electrician - he&#39;s travelled all over the country with his wife and <br/>
two daughters for the past five years, primarily working these days <br/>
as a foreman on 15-20 man crews. He picks and chooses the jobs he <br/>
wants now, and works locally on the lesser-paying job of DNR <br/>
wildlands firefighter when he&#39;d rather stick closer to home (this <br/>
year they&#39;ve offered him crew chief with his own engine). I could go <br/>
on...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When we think that our way is the only way then we leave room for Big Brother<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone on this list would presume to say our way is the <br/>
only way. It&#39;s simply our way, and it works for us.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I didn&#39;t realize that the kids ran the whole show in unschooling, working <br/>
only on their own initiative and only with their own direction. Boy it sure <br/>
would be appealling to my lazy side because I wouldn&#39;t have to do hardly <br/>
anything! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And another responded:<br/>
&lt;&lt;Bravo!<br/>
The first voice of reason in this whole debate. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, it&#39;s not a debate, it&#39;s a discussion about how unschooling can work.<br/>
<br/>
And the suggestion that unschoolers are lazy is made as a parting shot by <br/>
many who don&#39;t want to look closely enough to understand it.  I&#39;ve heard it <br/>
for ten years, and no one who knows me in person or knows my kids says &quot;lazy&quot; <br/>
about our lives.  We go and do lots.  <br/>
<br/>
There are many unschoolers who admit that they once thought unschoolers were <br/>
lazy and wrong, but after leaving and trying structure and control, some have <br/>
come back saying &quot;You were right, that didn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s just that it works in some families and not others <br/>
or whether some of those who try structure give up and their kids go back to <br/>
school or what.  Some make it work through teen years.  Many find their <br/>
relationship with their kids is pretty messed up by trying to make them <br/>
memorize and report and test well.<br/>
<br/>
My kids will need to know things that are in textbooks too, but they will <br/>
NEVER need to take 18 weeks to go through a textbook, one unit a week with a <br/>
test on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
If the parents don&#39;t believe a person&#39;s interests can lead them to learn on <br/>
their own, maybe the parent hasn&#39;t looked at the things she has learned on <br/>
her own, without a supervising teacher.  And if the parent hasn&#39;t realized <br/>
what she has learned on her own, and so is telling the child &quot;you won&#39;t learn <br/>
on your own,&quot; than perhaps that combination of factors could keep the child <br/>
from even trying.  Or cause the child to discount what she learns on her own, <br/>
and value what she learns from a teacher or a textbook.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172585027">Guess I still was unclear.<br/>
I agree completely with everything you just said....I havent shared how we<br/>
&#39;unschool&#39; in my family, so there is little basis for anyone saying that I<br/>
am right or wrong in my approach....<br/>
<br/>
I do however tend not to read a lot of &#39;studies&#39; and the like, but pay<br/>
attention to my own childrens development. I put very little stock in some<br/>
professional defining for me how my children learn best, especially<br/>
considering that most of them are products of the very &#39;institution&#39; I have<br/>
intentionally seperated my family from.<br/>
<br/>
I may be totally off base about my methods, or lack thereof, for educating<br/>
my children. I do find value in this discussion list, and intend to continue<br/>
to take part here because I do believe that my way is defined as<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; however the way I go about it, or dont go about it..is my<br/>
business, and may only be right for my family, regardless of some study.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe we are all changing the world, every day. Our children are all<br/>
being given a much broader idea of what it means to grow and learn in this<br/>
world. I dont think the way to effect change in the world is to afix labels<br/>
and tell other parents they are causing damage, if I missed a reference to a<br/>
study then it is my mistake...but even then I dont think I would be<br/>
confrontational in my approach. I find, much like with my children, the<br/>
minute I start with &quot;you are wrong&quot; the ears close and I&#39;m changing nothing<br/>
but the pitch of my own voice.<br/>

How unschoolers *look* is what applies to individual families.<br/>
There is a basic philosophy that has been agreed upon and that is, <br/>
children do not need coersion, or manipulation to learn,however <br/>
subtle.  They were born to learn.<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are many here who have not done the <br/>
coercive/manipulative route at some point.  I can remember long <br/>
conversations with my dd about the importance of learning <br/>
multiplication and all of the ways I went about getting them inside <br/>
of her head.   <br/>
I have been a non unschooler.  I was public schooled myself and know <br/>
the effects.  Now I know what unschooling is about.  <br/>
It is letting go of all the &quot;shoulds&#39; and &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; and living a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m unclear on when anybody said that you were right or wrong in your <br/>
approach.  I just re-read the post from Sandra that you were responding to, <br/>
and I don&#39;t see where she said you were wrong.  This whole thing has been <br/>
about whether or not it&#39;s possible to partly unschool.  You haven&#39;t shared <br/>
how you unschool in your family, but you *have* shared that you only <br/>
unschool some things.  People said that what you are doing is fine if it <br/>
works for you and your family, but that it isn&#39;t unschooling.  Where&#39;s the <br/>
problem?<br/>

&gt;to take part here because I do believe that my way is defined as<br/>
&gt;&#39;unschooling&#39; however the way I go about it, or dont go about it..is my<br/>
&gt;business, and may only be right for my family, regardless of some study.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a really hard time understanding why it&#39;s so important to you to be <br/>
viewed as unschooling.  You&#39;ve said you&#39;re happy with your approach.  It <br/>
sounds like eclectic homeschooling to me.  What&#39;s so horrible about being <br/>
an eclectic homeschooler?  It doesn&#39;t make any difference to me how you <br/>
homeschool.<br/>

No one said I was right or wrong, I was speaking in general terms, I&#39;m not<br/>
having a problem with anyone on the list...I&#39;m simply having a discussion.<br/>
Thank you for your concern tho.<br/>
<br/>

  This whole thing has been<br/>

<br/>
No, I have shared nothing concerning my approach, perhaps you are mistaking<br/>
me for another poster :)<br/>
