<br/>
***I can&#39;t say whether literature alone can lead one to religion, whatever <br/>
religion they may claim. Many people use the written words of the bible, the <br/>
quoran, the torah, to support their choices in religions. But for me they could <br/>
be considered literature with good stories, just like &quot;Illusions&quot;. I don&#39;t <br/>
prescribe to any of the religions that people often base their faiths on those <br/>
books. Then again, I don&#39;t really claim to have a religion. <br/>
<br/>
Just like many other things in life, people get stuck in labels. For many <br/>
years I said I was a Gnostic Christian. It is kind of like when you say you&#39;re a <br/>
homeschooler, even though you know you don&#39;t school at home or school at all. <br/>
It&#39;s a label that can sometimes eleviate any questions you aren&#39;t up to <br/>
answering. In a group of Christians, all they needed to hear was that word and <br/>
little was asked about my beliefs from that point on. It wasn&#39;t untrue, it just <br/>
wasn&#39;t as cut and dry as they may have preferred it to be. On the occasions that <br/>
someone would actually ask me what Gnostic meant, I&#39;d cut that definition <br/>
short also, depending on how much I knew about their own belief system or <br/>
religion. If they seemed interested or asked for more detailed information, I would <br/>
happily share. Now, I don&#39;t really call myself anything when asked what religion <br/>
I am. I usually say I don&#39;t have a religion and somehow that always jumps the <br/>
asker to the conclusion that I am an Atheist. Back to labels we go. Sometimes <br/>
I&#39;ll explain, sometimes I&#39;m not in the mood, sometimes I don&#39;t care, just <br/>
depends. <br/>
<br/>
Overall, to each their own. If being a trekkie (and whatever that may <br/>
encompass) floats a persons boat, then cool by me.  It&#39;s about them and not about me. <br/>
The twins asked the other day, when a friend of theirs was asking them about <br/>
being &quot;saved&quot;, &quot;Mom, is there a wrong way to believe? And how do you know when <br/>
you are right?&quot;  My explaination to them was, &quot;Well, to me there is no wrong <br/>
about faith/philosophy/religion/beliefs. It&#39;s something personal, so personal <br/>
that I don&#39;t know any two people that agree on all of it. It&#39;s also something <br/>
earthly, so it&#39;s a concern of this plane. There are lots of groups of people <br/>
who see somethings similarly, enough to congregate, you know get together, and <br/>
they share many things based on having those things in common. As for knowing <br/>
who&#39;s right, I don&#39;t. But I don&#39;t think anyone else does. It&#39;s all about what <br/>
feels right to you, you have to choose. You may choose something totally <br/>
different than me, the way I have different beliefs than Grammy. All that I really <br/>
need you to always know, is that no matter what you choose, you will always be <br/>
my babies, I will always love you and I hope I never ask you to change those <br/>
beliefs for me. And if I ever do, remind me of this conversation and that it <br/>
has to be about you.&quot; I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be the last conversation we have about <br/>
it, but we have them all the time. A while back when my mom came over we <br/>
watched &quot;Cholcolat&quot; and Kass had me rollin though when she said, &quot;What if it <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter what we think, if when we die we all meet up again and then a whole <br/>
bunch of people are walking around saying, &#39;Oh, I never thought you&#39;d be here, <br/>
my bad!!!&#39; &quot; My mom smiled and said, &quot;Yep, she&#39;s definately your kid!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When a belief is brought to an unschooling discussion list that would make<br/>
it more difficult for someone to get unschooling, then it&#39;s helpful to some<br/>
who are trying to get unschooling for the list to hold those beliefs up and<br/>
examine the ramifications. That&#39;s what the list is for.<br/>
<br/>
Our beliefs, as Pam succinctly put it (but I can&#39;t find it now) and I took a<br/>
huge post saying ;-) are what we use to decide what are good and bad<br/>
choices. Part of the purpose of the list is to help people figure out how to<br/>
make the choices that will get them to unschooling and more joyful lives<br/>
with their families. And part of that process is examining the beliefs<br/>
people are using to filter their choices.<br/>
<br/>
But even on a larger scale, do you really mean &quot;whatever floats a person&#39;s<br/>
boat&quot;? So if I hear voices from God that tell me to murder people, that&#39;s<br/>
&quot;cool&quot; by you? If my beliefs lead me to believe that it&#39;s a mandate from God<br/>
that I swat my children for sinful behavior with an appropriately sized<br/>
dowel chosen from a chart by age, then that&#39;s cool too?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Mom, is there a wrong way to believe? And how do you know when<br/>

&gt; about faith/philosophy/religion/beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which sounds really pretty. What I assume you mean is that you are raising<br/>
your daughters in a moral atmosphere where murdering, stealing and generally<br/>
being hurtful are not good options. So, as long as their spirituality<br/>
doesn&#39;t cross those moral lines, then whatever they believe is cool with<br/>
you. Yes?<br/>
<br/>
Some of people will look at what you said and what I said and think &quot;Well,<br/>
*obviously* that&#39;s what she meant. And it&#39;s nitpicky to even question it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On a list where the only tool we have to get our ideas across are the words<br/>
we use, those words are very important. If we were talking about things we<br/>
were all well familiar with, like how to nurse a baby, then we could rely on<br/>
people filling in the gaps of where our words weren&#39;t quite right. But the<br/>
list isn&#39;t about familiar things. It&#39;s very often about ideas that many<br/>
people have never contemplated before. So the words we use need to<br/>
accurately convey what we&#39;re thinking.<br/>
<br/>
So, I definitely disagree and say there are wrong ways to believe -- wrong<br/>
for helping people get to unschooling, and wrong for a peaceful society of<br/>
differing beliefs. There are very definitely beliefs that won&#39;t help people<br/>
get where they want to go. There are ways that will turn people around from<br/>
where they want to go.<br/>
<br/>
This list is about getting to unschooling so signing onto the list is<br/>
implying where someone wants to get is unschooling. (Or to at least listen<br/>
in and absorb some of the process of those who are getting there for those<br/>
who want to pick and choose.)<br/>
<br/>
This list tries to help people see the ways of viewing the world that *will*<br/>
help them get where they imply they&#39;d like to go by joining an unschooling<br/>
discussion list.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Illusions is a good story, but it wasn&#39;t intended to be a religion.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, in another book, Bach writes about the dangers of putting one&#39;s<br/>
thoughts down on paper and having that taken to be the basis of a<br/>
religion.  Fortunately, Illusions wasn&#39;t mentioned with that in mind. <br/>
Merely, it&#39;s a reminder that we choose to agree to the physical<br/>
&#39;reality&#39; of this world.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There are people who get their religious urges out over Star Trek or<br/>
Star Wars.  My husband is enamored of the philosophies in Babylon 5.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Religion--which really doesn&#39;t exist in Star Trek (with the possible<br/>
exception of Chakotay (sp?) in Voyager) or Star Wars (can&#39;t speak to<br/>
Babylon 5 as I never watched it)--is a very different thing from<br/>
philosophy or morality or just plain values.  I guess I don&#39;t know what<br/>
you mean by &#39;get their religious urges&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Trekkie in the sense that I admire the shows as reborn in the 80s<br/>
(in fact, they are the only TV shows I watch). I admire the values,<br/>
issues, conflicts, etc they illustrate, but I don&#39;t go to conventions<br/>
and/or identify with characters beyond merely enjoying their<br/>
performances.  One of the best books around is _The Metaphysics of Star<br/>
Trek_.  I also greatly enjoy the Star Wars movies.  And I love _The Lord<br/>
of the Rings_, though I think the movies are disappointing.  I don&#39;t get<br/>
my religious urges from any of these, books or movies/TV shows, but they<br/>
do reflect many of my deeply-held values, which makes them more<br/>
enjoyable to me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Should literature serve as someone&#39;s strongly held beliefs?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I know what you mean here, either, but surely the Bible and<br/>
Koran are examples of literature providing religious beliefs, or<br/>
underlying those beliefs?  Going back to Bach&#39;s writing, his beliefs as<br/>
expressed in the books are not a religion.  But they have helped me<br/>
challenge the more or less Christian cultural upbringing I had, and<br/>
think more deeply about matters philosophical/religious/spiritual than I<br/>
might have otherwise.  His books don&#39;t &#39;serve as my beliefs&#39;.  His books<br/>
simply helped me clarify where I stand, what I believe about myself, my<br/>
existence after this life, etc.  Another person might take the books<br/>
more literally, and build a &#39;religion&#39; around them.  That&#39;s not my<br/>
choice, but who am I to deny that person his/her choice?<br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&lt;Should we treat the beliefs of a Trek-fan trekker/trekkie/trekoid) who<br/>
has read the Bible in Klingon and drinks blood and prune juice as<br/>
reverently as we treat those of a hard-working, sincerely believing<br/>
Catholic nun?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone suggested treating another&#39;s beliefs with<br/>
&#39;reverence&#39;.  The Holly I mentioned above once told me that if I didn&#39;t<br/>
go to HER church--not merely her sect, but her specific church building<br/>
with her particular minister--that I would go to hell.  I don&#39;t regard<br/>
such a belief with reverence by any means--in fact, I laughed at the<br/>
time, and laugh every time I remember the incident :)  Though at the<br/>
same time I feel slightly saddened that she&#39;s chosen such a narrow way<br/>
to view the world.<br/>
<br/>
But I respect that she has a right to her beliefs, as long as she<br/>
doesn&#39;t act on them in a way that harms me (my physical self--no one can<br/>
harm my spiritual self) or others I am responsible for.  If she does,<br/>
then I walk away.  If she follows, I take whatever steps I need to, to<br/>
protect myself and my loved ones.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the real issue here is an assumption that I, or anyone else,<br/>
would believe *all* beliefs are equally valid, equally worthy of respect<br/>
or &#39;reverence&#39;.  I can&#39;t speak for anyone else, but for myself, of<br/>
course I don&#39;t believe all beliefs are equally valid :)  If I did, I&#39;d<br/>
be in a right quandary, wondering whether the other Holly was right that<br/>
I was going to hell.  Against that, I&#39;d have to place another person&#39;s<br/>
beliefs--that person told me I was going to heaven whether I liked it or<br/>
not because at one point I was baptized.  Talk about a rock and a hard<br/>
place, particularly since I believe neither in heaven nor hell :)<br/>
<br/>
My personal point of view is that I have respect--even to those who harm<br/>
me--for the PERSON.  I don&#39;t have to respect the motivations, beliefs,<br/>
or actions and yet be able to respect the person.  By respect I mean<br/>
that I (do my best) to accept others where they are in their lives;<br/>
accept that they are doing the best they can in any given set of<br/>
circumstances; accept that their beliefs are different from my own;<br/>
accept that they, like me, in spite of appearances, are part of the Tao;<br/>
and accept the fact that sometimes the intersections of our lives will<br/>
be painful, while othertimes will be rewarding.<br/>
<br/>
So I accept your hypothetical Trekkie exactly as I accept your<br/>
hypothetical nun exactly as I accept Judie exactly as I accept you.  We<br/>
are all traveling in this physical life for a time, all struggling to<br/>
make sense of the inherent conflict between the &#39;reality&#39; we see and the<br/>
Reality we sense or remember, each of us groping toward a deeper<br/>
understanding of what physical life is all about.<br/>
<br/>
The question becomes, how judgmental do we need to be of each other on<br/>
this journey?  Does it help us each along, or hinder us?  Ultimately,<br/>
how much does it matter?  My physical self believes it matters a lot, my<br/>
spiritual self knows we are all &#39;dust in the wind&#39; and it matters not<br/>
one whit.<br/>
<br/>
And so the see-saw of life keeps teetering &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

***Actually, yes. Though the human part of me may not like it, the spiritual <br/>
part of my beliefs, would mandate that while on Earth, what you put out, you <br/>
get back, but even that is only at the human level. Therefore, my disdain for <br/>
something at the human level is not the same as my ability to accept even the <br/>
horrors of this life at my spirit level. <br/>
<br/>
For me at soul level, there exist no good or bad, while at the human level <br/>
there is plenty of both. And while I understand that conceptually it may be <br/>
difficult to accept by those who don&#39;t believe that, for me, I strive to classify <br/>
which things in this life are my lessons and what they mean, even the most <br/>
horrifc events. I think there has to be a reason for everything. I don&#39;t claim to <br/>
&quot;know&quot; what that reason is, but I don&#39;t understand how there would be good if <br/>
there were no bad. So, in essence, experiencing both good and bad is <br/>
something my soul chose to do.  For me, that would include the best of the best and <br/>
the worsed of the worsed. It goes back to the beliefs of lessons and desire to <br/>
have them while we are here. For me, everything beyond humanity belongs to a <br/>
greater existence. An existence that dosen&#39;t deal in good or bad. For I see <br/>
those as earth bound concepts. <br/>

*** No. I can only choose to share how important it is to put positive out so <br/>
that they receive positive back while they exist here. On the human level I <br/>
want their existence to be full of positive energy. I, like Judie, believe that <br/>
we contracted to experience specific events together on Earth. Therefore, the <br/>
events that we chose to experience, even the bad ones, were predetermined. I <br/>
don&#39;t say that in order to discount the tragedies we have in this life, nor to <br/>
be hurtful to those who have experienced tragedies. The humanity in me weeps <br/>
for the pain in this world, but the spiritual part of me knows that those <br/>
events happened for a reason. The outcomes and circumstances we experience in the <br/>
interim of those events, are where free-will is utilzed. So for my daughters, <br/>
while I cannot change the &quot;events&quot; they contracted to experience, I can give <br/>
them tools by which they can exercise their free will with positive energy <br/>
between those events.  <br/>

Lastly, I have a question to throw out there. Would those who both agree and <br/>
disagree with the concept that things happen for reason, be willing to share <br/>
why they think we experience tragedy/bad/evil. Not trying to bait anyone, just <br/>
trying to understand what others believe the purpose of those things to be.<br/>

I enjoyed this entire post. A friend and I were discussing existence, and <br/>
while I know my wording will not be anywhere near as eloquent as the discussion <br/>
was, I have another anaolgy which is similar to the Tao concept. <br/>
<br/>
My existence here and now is like that of a molocule of water, currently <br/>
separated from the vast sea. The molecule itself can exist without the sea, but <br/>
will someday return to the it. Ultimately, the water never disappears, it may <br/>
evaporate, but it just takes on new form of existence to become a cloud, which <br/>
in turn will one day rain. After the rain, the molecule may still not return to <br/>
the ocean, it may become part of a river, but ultimately that too will return <br/>
to the sea. For no matter what form the molecule may take, in the end it is <br/>
still water belonging to the vast sea. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think there&#39;s no meaning behind it. Bad events are merely chance.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in evil. I think some people are subjected to more than<br/>
their particular bodies can cope with to create a healthy person and they<br/>
end up with a brain full of harmful beliefs. Some people are born with bad<br/>
chemistry.<br/>
<br/>
I think that negative thinking can bring more tragedy into a person&#39;s life<br/>
because they&#39;re likely to make more negative choices or not see positive<br/>
ways out of something. That doesn&#39;t explain all bad things, of course.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s comforting to think that good things will come from bad. But<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen people use that line of thought to justify a stance that<br/>
everyone should be able to overcome adversity because a hard life builds<br/>
character.<br/>
<br/>
I think good things can come out of bad. And that people can even actively<br/>
seek good from bad. But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any cosmic reason for bad and<br/>
there&#39;s a greater good in eliminating as much bad as possible.<br/>

me, actually.  Not limiting the learning and exploring of spirituality to <br/>
designated church/temple/holy book.  <br/>
<br/>
       I am making a distinction between religion and spirituality, tho, to <br/>
be clear. <br/>
<br/>
       Altho, there does seem to be a Jedi religion forming, mostly in <br/>
Australia, and I *believe* it started out as a joke to screw up a census!  I would <br/>
hazard a guess that there are some who take it quite seriously.  I suppose if I <br/>
had a chance to talk with someone about it I would find it interesting, find <br/>
out more.  There are plenty of cool ideas in the Star Wars universe.  ;-)  <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  I think you were very clear and it was <br/>
helpful to read.  When I read or hear of someone who has committed a heinous <br/>
crime, I always wonder what brought them to that point.  I hate the act that they <br/>
have done but I always without fail wonder what that person has experienced in <br/>
life that made them feel it was something they HAD to do.<br/>
<br/>
Just like homeless people, lots of people cross the street, turn away or <br/>
ignore them.  I feel drawn to them.  Once I almost thought I got myself in trouble <br/>
in DC with a homeless man, but after I reacted kindly to him and offered him <br/>
my hand to shake, the man broke down and cried.  I KNEW my daughters and I <br/>
were about to be victims and I don&#39;t know how I managed to even think of <br/>
extending my hand to him and pretending like I thought he wanted to greet us instead <br/>
of rob us.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what Karmic thing changed that moment for me and my girls but it <br/>
could have been a horrible time, instead we ended up hearing for half an hour <br/>
about how this man had no human contact for five years of being on the <br/>
streets and when I held out my hand to him, he felt like I was recognizing him as a <br/>
human being when so many just don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So when I read posts like yours it makes me think about things way deeper <br/>
than my Baptist upbringing usually takes me.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

Thank you for sharing. I find it very intriguing to hear how others see <br/>
things. I was hoping maybe you could expand on some of it :-).<br/>

Joyce wrote:<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s no meaning behind it. Bad events are merely chance.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in evil.<br/>
<br/>
*** So are the tragedies people experience merely circumstance? Wrong place <br/>
at wrong time? So if one chooses to perpetrate trauma on another, is that also <br/>
about chance? If we choose to not believe in evil, then (conceptually speaking <br/>
of course) would that then mean that those who commit heinous acts not really <br/>
required to be punished, because by chance they victimized someone?<br/>
<br/>
Joyce wrote:<br/>

 I think some people are subjected to more than<br/>
their particular bodies can cope with to create a healthy person and they<br/>
end up with a brain full of harmful beliefs. Some people are born with bad<br/>

<br/>
*** Are these also by chance? If those people experience things that create a <br/>
brain full of of harmful beliefs or born of bad chemistry, are they just the <br/>
unfortunate people that were dealt a bad hand, and if so how can we hold them <br/>
accountable?<br/>
<br/>
Joyce wrote:<br/>
<br/>
I think that negative thinking can bring more tragedy into a person&#39;s life<br/>
because they&#39;re likely to make more negative choices or not see positive<br/>
ways out of something. That doesn&#39;t explain all bad things, of course.<br/>
<br/>
*** While I realized you qualified that it may not explain all bad things, <br/>
what about people who are positive, in both thoughts and acts, and still they <br/>
are encounter bad, that is chance also? <br/>

You are correct that I use them all and I recognize them as all being <br/>
different, but I am not switching back and forth. For me they are all interconnected <br/>
and why I asked if anyone would share how they see it. I&#39;m neither looking for <br/>
support, nor trying to change anyones mind. I am asking so that I might be <br/>
better able to understand how others operate. So for those who are willing to <br/>
share, I appreciate that openess and would more than likely have questions, if <br/>
something was unclear to me. So should anyone choose to, I would assume they <br/>
would be held to the same list guidelines, and my asking questions would be <br/>
looked at as my need to discuss those beliefs respectfully so that I might get a <br/>
better understanding of them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So are the tragedies people experience merely circumstance? Wrong place <br/>

<br/>
I make decisions in my life.  It&#39;s not chance that I didn&#39;t make dinner <br/>
tonight and we&#39;re having sandwiches, it&#39;s that the kids are scattered hither and <br/>
yon and I made brownies instead.   My cooking urge is done.   Maybe not a GREAT <br/>
decision, but neither is it just chance, and I&#39;m pretty sure it wasn&#39;t God <br/>
acting through me, nor was it decided between me and Keith before either of us <br/>
was born.<br/>
<br/>
Freud and God and Worf all would probably agree that sometimes brownies are <br/>
just brownies.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some people are born with bad<br/>
chemistry. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are these also by chance?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If an unstable person marries an unstable person (or just has babies, forget <br/>
the marriage part), the liklihood of those children being unstable is fairly <br/>
high, whether it&#39;s nurture or nature or combo both.<br/>
<br/>
Not many people have sex by chance.  <br/>
Not many people decide not to use birth control by chance.<br/>
Most babies nowadays are not born by chance.<br/>
<br/>
People make decisions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;are they just the <br/>
unfortunate people that were dealt a bad hand, and if so how can we hold them <br/>
accountable?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Accountable for bad beliefs?   <br/>
Accountable for actions, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;accountability&quot; in these instances is cultural.  A woman driving a car <br/>
or committing adultry isn&#39;t going to be stoned to death in Wyoming.   A dinner <br/>
guest eating with his left hand or showing the heels of his shoes isn&#39;t likely <br/>
to be sent home right then and there in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t have the social sense God gave a donut (if donuts fall <br/>
under God&#39;s dominion; they&#39;re not named in the Bible), and Howard Gardner says <br/>
that&#39;s how it goes with brains sometimes.  Do we hold them accountable for bad <br/>
social decisions?  <br/>
<br/>
Yes. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s harder for bad musicians to get jobs as musicians.  Sometimes <br/>
impossible.  Usually impossible.  That&#39;s okay.  Maybe they can be mechanics or lawyers <br/>
or football players or will look damned good in a UPS uniform.<br/>
<br/>
People are born somewhere.  The place has rules and laws and social <br/>
expectations.  Some do better than others.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;*** While I realized you qualified that it may not explain all bad things, <br/>
what about people who are positive, in both thoughts and acts, and still they <br/>
are encounter bad, that is chance also? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could you rephrase that?<br/>
I think you edited and something was lost.<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean to ask whether it&#39;s chance that a positive thinking person would <br/>
encounter some badness?<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever rolled dice?  Can anyone think positively enough to roll all <br/>
6&#39;s?<br/>
Where, on earth, would one live where nothing bad could happen?<br/>

you have attacked making known your want of the power to decide some truth for <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So then someone can ask me to clarify or define, but I can&#39;t ask the same? <br/>
And I think several times Sandra has mentioned not believeing people truly <br/>
believe certain things, I don&#39;t recall ever saying anything like that. If I did, <br/>
please point me to where I said such a thing. I would hate to be misunderstood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here &gt; you have attacked making known your want of the power to decide some <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; truth for <br/>
&gt; someone. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who have I attacked? I haven&#39;t ever needed the power you are speaking of, but <br/>
rather I am wanting to understand. Maybe you have my posts and Sandra posts <br/>
mixed up. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How does this help countless people who read here to get <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; unschooling? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** Well quite a while back when Judie had just left, I asked that too. But <br/>
several posts came through about the purpose of the list being to discuss <br/>
beliefs and that unless you were willing to stand by your beliefs you shouldn&#39;t <br/>
post them. Since I posted mine, here I stand by them, hoping to get to a mutual <br/>
understanding. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really think you have gone past the point of honest questioning and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; seeking knowledge to attacking and belittling. But then I am not a list <br/>
&gt; moderator, <br/>
&gt; and I am sure you would say that the same thing has been happening to you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~Nancy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you could point me to the post where I wasn&#39;t honest. And didn&#39;t you <br/>
begin this post by asking me who was I to decide about honesty? I&#39;d also like <br/>
to know who I have attacked or belittled, or if I was merely defending my <br/>
beliefs, exactly as the list guidelines say you should if you put your beliefs out <br/>
there for the list to see.<br/>

Sorry, missed the earlier one directed at me:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So are the tragedies people experience merely circumstance? Wrong place<br/>
&gt; at wrong time? So if one chooses to perpetrate trauma on another, is that also<br/>
&gt; about chance?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How can a choice be chance? The person who gets hurt because of another&#39;s<br/>
choice may be chance, but the person hurting decided to engage in the<br/>
hurtful behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If we choose to not believe in evil, then (conceptually speaking<br/>
&gt; of course) would that then mean that those who commit heinous acts not really<br/>
&gt; required to be punished, because by chance they victimized someone?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People aren&#39;t puppets controlled by some dice role. People who make hurtful<br/>
choices are responsible for the hurt those decisions cause.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *** Are these also by chance? If those people experience things that create a<br/>
&gt; brain full of of harmful beliefs or born of bad chemistry, are they just the<br/>
&gt; unfortunate people that were dealt a bad hand, and if so how can we hold them<br/>
&gt; accountable?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Accountable suggests that they need to pay back for what they&#39;ve done. I<br/>
think people need to be held responsible for their actions, even actions<br/>
caused by bad chemistry.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel compassion for the people who are being hurtful. They may have the<br/>
chemistry they do because of circumstances they had no control over. They<br/>
may have been born that way. A doesn&#39;t choose to be molested. A child<br/>
doesn&#39;t choose to grow up in a drug infested home with parents whose values<br/>
are warped by drugs and immaturity. Those environments will often create<br/>
someone who is a hurtful person.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they need punished since punishment by life circumstances is<br/>
often what created them. But they need to stop hurting others which<br/>
generally means putting them in prison. We need better tools to help them<br/>
but there&#39;s a big gap between what we need and what we have.<br/>
<br/>
But everyone is still responsible for the hurt they cause because<br/>
responsibility is a necessary social and psychological factor in learning to<br/>
make better choices. Making better choices and choosing a better point of<br/>
view will change brain chemistry. But some people won&#39;t be able to<br/>
internalize that feeling of responsibility and won&#39;t choose to or won&#39;t be<br/>
able to make choices that aren&#39;t hurtful, because of bad chemistry or<br/>
because we lack the tools to help them or because they choose to remain<br/>
stuck. So they need to be kept away from the rest of society. It&#39;s certainly<br/>
going to feel like punishment to them, but it&#39;s a better choice than<br/>
&quot;punishing&quot; the rest of society by setting them free.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *** While I realized you qualified that it may not explain all bad things,<br/>
&gt; what about people who are positive, in both thoughts and acts, and still they<br/>
&gt; are encounter bad, that is chance also?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course. And good things happen to bad people. Not everything in life that<br/>
happens has a reason behind it. To create elaborate stories for why chance<br/>
has brought two things together is to add layers of complication that then<br/>
need more explanations.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a tool in science called Ockham&#39;s Razor which basically says the<br/>
simplest explanation is generally the one that&#39;s right. That there is no<br/>
plan behind why we&#39;re here or what happens to us is as simple as it comes.<br/>
Some people need there to be a plan so have no problems adding in some<br/>
higher power. Some people need there to be a reason for everything and add<br/>
in all sorts of complicated explanations.<br/>

<br/>
There just HAS to be more to life/death/existence then the simplest of <br/>
reasons of mere existence.  I think there is overwhelming evidence that suggests <br/>
there are reasons for living other than simple existence due to no &quot;higher&quot; power <br/>
or &quot;plan&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s almost the same to me as taking literally the idea that EVERYTHING was <br/>
already decided so why bother.  This is all there is, nothing more, so what <br/>
does it matter in the grand scheme of life who we impact in this world or what <br/>
we do really?  Put out all the negative energy you want, doesn&#39;t affect <br/>
life... I don&#39;t buy that idea either.<br/>

<br/>
Being kind and helpful to others helps ourselves. <br/>
<br/>
If you are kind to your neighbor, take her cookies when she moves in,<br/>
offer to watch her kids (if you like them) let her borrow stuff and have<br/>
her in for coffee, you are much more likely to get the same kind of<br/>
treatment from her.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re mean and grumpy and complaining about her weeds, she might not<br/>
be so willing to overlook the fact that your dog barks at six AM and your<br/>
kids play noisily right outside her window when she&#39;s trying to watch her<br/>
favorite show and the old clunker you drive is an eyesore. <br/>
<br/>
Being kind benefits us right now and makes life easier.  You are much<br/>
more likely to get help when you need it if you are known as someone who<br/>
offers help to others.   <br/>
<br/>
*** Put out all the negative energy you want, doesn&#39;t affect <br/>
life... ***<br/>
<br/>
Harming others affects their lives.  And it affects the life of the<br/>
person who did the hurting.  If it was criminal he goes to jail.  It it<br/>
was just nasty others will know him for his actions and won&#39;t be as<br/>
willing to offer their friendship, help, or courtesy to him. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not even a reward or punishment you have to wait until you&#39;re dead<br/>
for.  It&#39;s a right now kind of thing.<br/>

<br/>
Some people add &quot;to serve God&quot; but if God&#39;s so powerful, why does he need <br/>
servants like people?  <br/>
<br/>
None of the systems ultimately explain everything, and since nobody knows for <br/>
sure, and since unschooling works the same (IF it will work) regardless of <br/>
what people believe, we can still discuss unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For a family which has as a priority the idea that children much be obedient <br/>
and the father must be the head of the family and the mother does the father&#39;s <br/>
bidding and the children follow the mother&#39;s commands, unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
likely to for them work because of their religion.<br/>
<br/>
If someone believes people all choose every detail beforehand, that&#39;s not <br/>
going to be a good match for helping other people learn to unschool.   If we&#39;re <br/>
not making choices now, e-mail lists like this are worthless.<br/>
<br/>
For those who ARE making choices now, and who are willing to see their <br/>
children as full people with minds and wills of their own, it can work fantastically <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Example (and somewhat a  subjectchange)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any children chose to be born and get spanked, for example.  I <br/>
think any parent who wants to build a nest in which natural learning can <br/>
thrive needs to not spank.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m living as though there were nothing else and I&#39;m happy and helpful and<br/>
people seem to like me. It&#39;s absence doesn&#39;t effect what I want and expect<br/>
from life. So it&#39;s certainly not a universal &quot;HAS to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what you mean is you really want there to be more because you find the<br/>
thought that there isn&#39;t more disturbing.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If the evidence were overwhelming then it would be as accepted as gravity.<br/>
<br/>
Here in the US it seems more people *do* believe in some greater power or<br/>
plan than don&#39;t. It&#39;s easy to extrapolte from the fact that most people<br/>
believe there is something more to the conclusion that there must therefore<br/>
be something more. All that belief must mean there&#39;s *something*. There was<br/>
Newsweek article &quot;Religion and the Brain&quot; Newsweek May 7, 2001 which I wish<br/>
I&#39;d read but I suspect from what I&#39;ve read about it that it discusses that<br/>
very thing: that the answers we come up with for The Reason For It All speak<br/>
more to a universal need in our brains for answers rather than to there<br/>
actually being something there.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re pattern loving creatures. We seek pattern in chaos. We can&#39;t help it.<br/>
And we *do* find plenty of patterns in nature and that&#39;s why we have science<br/>
and literature and art and so on. But it also causes us to be unsettled when<br/>
chaos is just chaos. We keep striving to find the pattern in it, and that, I<br/>
think, leads to a belief in higher powers and higher plans.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is all there is, nothing more, so what<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just wanting and needing something doesn&#39;t make it so. The laws of physics<br/>
don&#39;t care what we want spiritually ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Put out all the negative energy you want, doesn&#39;t affect<br/>
&gt; life... I don&#39;t buy that idea either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But negative energy does effect life. If we act selfishly, we&#39;re likely to<br/>
be responded to selfishly.<br/>
<br/>
Being negative and unkind makes a difference to us, to those around us and<br/>
to the environment we create around us. The kinder and more thoughtful and<br/>
joyful we are, the nicer people are to us and the nicer our little pocket of<br/>
society is.<br/>
<br/>
We get back what we give but we shouldn&#39;t give with that expectation. We<br/>
should help because the reward comes from the doing and the helping not<br/>
because we need some return.<br/>
<br/>
The words are pretty inadequate!<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re giving and no one wants the gift, then we&#39;re wasting our time. If<br/>
we&#39;re giving and *expecting* appreciation then we&#39;re likely to be<br/>
disappointed. (Though there&#39;s nothing wrong with reminding people if it<br/>
feels like they&#39;re taking what&#39;s given to them for granted.) If we&#39;re doing<br/>
what we want to do and feel good about doing it and we know it&#39;s something<br/>
that&#39;s needed, then we&#39;ll feel good about what we&#39;ve done and others will<br/>
appreciate it and that&#39;s it&#39;s own reward.<br/>
