&lt;&lt; The next day she went back to it and asked me:  so you<br/>
really don&#39;t care how I do on this?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do other people handle this kind of thing?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could make an additional level of math-learning out of it.  Get a <br/>
four-sided die from some D&D player, and tell her if she doesn&#39;t know, to roll that <br/>
and mark that answer (if it&#39;s multiple choice).  If when she rolls it the <br/>
answer doesn&#39;t look right, roll again.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;d probably do great if she did the whole TEST that way!  (And she could <br/>
try it out on some other test just for grins!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613991130">I like this idea...use the test for your own<br/>
purposes...I must be more school-brainwashed then I<br/>
thought as it never occurred to me to take the test<br/>
any other way than it&#39;s presented.<br/>
thanks!<br/>
