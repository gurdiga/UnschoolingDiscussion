 </span></blockquote>If you want to support him then you need to stop thinking that you know <br/>
that hsg is right for him. If it is, he needs to figure that out for <br/>
himeself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe I should let him decide <br/>

 </span></blockquote>An unschooling parent would adhere to this, in spite of how hard it would <br/>
be to watch a decision that you may know is inherently wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But I also know that <br/>
&gt;if he does, he will feel very bad about himself if he finds returning <br/>
&gt;was a mistake. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And then he can leave again. Sometimes one needs a few times to figure <br/>
out if their decision is the best one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have considered waiting to see how the rest of this <br/>
&gt;year goes and if he is not doing better at home, there is no way he <br/>
&gt;could cut it in ps and maybe I should make that decision (although I <br/>
&gt;hesitate to). <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he wants to go back. Let him. Also let him know that he has other <br/>
decisions. Such as unschooling. Its hard for a parent to step back, but <br/>
you need to at this point. Offer him his choices, you may even want to <br/>
sit down and write them out with him. Then support his decison and let <br/>
him know he can change at any point he wants and you will support that <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I want him happy and to get back his self-esteem. Maybe <br/>
&gt;we need to take more of an unschooling approach and let him make his <br/>
&gt;own decisions about learning. Eventually he may pick up a book again. <br/>
&gt;He&#39;s very bright and loves computer programming. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you are waivering, then hopefully someone on this list can  help you <br/>
push you over the proverbial edge towards unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If he loves programming, then make that one of his choices, he can stay <br/>
home and program all day if he wishes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;What can I do to make him feel better about himself the rest of this <br/>
&gt;year? He feels like he is failing academically at home and not <br/>
&gt;learning enough but he can&#39;t handle anymore than he is doing now, <br/>
&gt;which is very little. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Offer the choices and be prepared to take a leap of trust in him and in <br/>
yourself. And come running here when life gets overwhelming and get your <br/>
support from other parents that share your experiences.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I need to help him organize his time and structure his days better. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He needs to figure it out for himself. He&#39;s been &#39;damaged&#39; by control in <br/>
the ps system and needs to &#39;repair&#39; before he can put it all together. It <br/>
takes time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He wanted flexibility, but we saw what happened with that - nothing. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How so? Did you know that it takes about a year to undo the damage done <br/>
in ps and other oppressive schooling? Did you allow time for you and for <br/>
him to adjust?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He can&#39;t remember the simplest of things and to carry out everyday <br/>
&gt;tasks and he hates it when I remind him. I don&#39;t like reminding him <br/>
&gt;either. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he hates it and you hate it, then stop it. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve basically told him it is up to him to make things <br/>
&gt;happen. I will help him organize things, but I can&#39;t make him do it <br/>
&gt;if he refuses to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, its time to adjust. You sound like a very concerned and loving <br/>
parent. When the worrying stops, the best part of life will happen.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s frustrating for him and for me. Once we deal with these <br/>
&gt;issues, I think he&#39;ll be much happier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, this takes a leap of trust and TIME to de-school both of <br/>
yourselves.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;It was recommended by his dr. that he get one-on-one counseling and <br/>
&gt;also group counseling but I&#39;m not sure where to go. Also, do the ps <br/>
&gt;do anything to accommodate ADD students?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an issue I&#39;d best refrain from talking about. I don&#39;t like labels <br/>
and although I don&#39;t agree with neurological altering medications, I know <br/>
that some parents don&#39;t have a choice because of the way our system is <br/>
set up. My heart goes out to all of them. I wish Western science would <br/>
lose its ego and begin to heal.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry for all the questions and rambling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t be sorry. You came here as an option, or in desperation in trying <br/>
to do the best thing for your child.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, some of the responses will help and you both make a choice <br/>
that you are comfortable with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10082895">We started hsg this past April because my 14yo ds hated school and <br/>
was becoming depressed. I thought it was due to not being challenged, <br/>
as he was always a very good student - always saw the big picture. It <br/>
was the small things he sometimes missed. After a few months of <br/>
schooling to some degree at home, I decided we had to have him tested <br/>
for ADD, as I had wondered for quite some time if there could be <br/>
something else going on with him other than being underchallenged. <br/>
<br/>
He was just diagnosed with ADD - the inattentive type. He is easily <br/>
distracted and can&#39;t stay focused. He once loved to read but won&#39;t <br/>
pick up a book anymore. <br/>
<br/>
He has been given Adderall and since starting about 3 days ago, I&#39;ve <br/>
seen a difference. He hasn&#39;t said &quot;Huh?&quot; and made me repeat myself at <br/>
all, as I&#39;m accustomed to doing all these years. I have even tested <br/>
him by talking to him from another room and still he hears me the <br/>
first time. I&#39;m very happy about that. We found this past week while <br/>
on vacation that he is staying up until 3 a.m. and I wonder if the <br/>
2nd pill given to him later in the day could be contributing, so we <br/>
gave him only one pill yesterday. The test will come when we start in <br/>
again on academics next week, but I have a feeling that we can&#39;t <br/>
expect a great change. I don&#39;t know. Good and bad days still I&#39;m <br/>
sure. <br/>
<br/>
My concerns now are in the way that we hs. We wants to return to ps <br/>
next year due to missing friends, even though he participates in <br/>
sports. He says it&#39;s not the same, but he also says that he would be <br/>
getting F&#39;s if he were in ps now. I want to support him but I <br/>
honestly believe that hsg is right for him and I don&#39;t want him to go <br/>
through another depressing time in ps. Maybe I should let him decide <br/>
for himself and maybe he&#39;ll decide to hs again. But I also know that <br/>
if he does, he will feel very bad about himself if he finds returning <br/>
was a mistake. I have considered waiting to see how the rest of this <br/>
year goes and if he is not doing better at home, there is no way he <br/>
could cut it in ps and maybe I should make that decision (although I <br/>
hesitate to). I want him happy and to get back his self-esteem. Maybe <br/>
we need to take more of an unschooling approach and let him make his <br/>
own decisions about learning. Eventually he may pick up a book again. <br/>
He&#39;s very bright and loves computer programming. <br/>
<br/>
What can I do to make him feel better about himself the rest of this <br/>
year? He feels like he is failing academically at home and not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731776487">imo I&#39;d *immediately* rush out and buy Real Lives: Eleven Teenagers <br/>
Who Don&#39;t Go to School by Grace Lewellyn and I&#39;d either read it to <br/>
him or insist he read it. Period.   I believe that all the other <br/>
things you mentioned will fall into place after he gets a better <br/>
grasp of what unschooling actually is and yes, he may need your <br/>
assistance in some ways, but he should also strive to be control of <br/>
his own time, schedules (if he likes schedules) and his own <br/>
education. If returning to p.s. next year is still paramount, I think <br/>
you have to let him try it.... he *is* a teen, ya know and teens can <br/>
be so rebellious when a parent tries to control their lives.<br/>
<br/>
No comments about the medications because I&#39;m clueless except to say <br/>
that I *do* know dosages have to be adjusted for most any of them and <br/>
that might be something you could look into.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I snipped the rest of your post but am answering all of it.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are giving this issue lots of thought and that&#39;s <br/>
good.  Here are my suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Look for a local support group with kids and parents that you <br/>
BOTH like.  It took several tried for us but we finally succeeded <br/>
here and many of them are on this list too. {HI GUYS ;-)}<br/>
<br/>
2.  Don&#39;t be afraid to just let things go for a while.  Tell your son <br/>
it&#39;s okay to step back and look at the whole picture and take a <br/>
little time to figure out what HE wants.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Public Schools by and large handle ADD by medicating them into <br/>
conformity.  They are not equipped to treat students as individuals.<br/>
<br/>
4.  This is not a popular suggestion here but I&#39;m throwing out <br/>
anyway: If you find he is stuck in a loop of TV watching and video <br/>
game playing, see what happens if you limit it.  My son has lots of <br/>
problems but his flat out obsession with electronic stimuli is the <br/>
biggest one.  Video games, Nintendo 64 particularly, seem to fry his <br/>
brain.  TV spirals into constant watching (even stuff he admits he <br/>
hates to watch) unless we help him keep it in control.  Funny thing <br/>
is, now that we have recognized the problem and addressed it as a <br/>
problem, he is fine with the limitations.  HE, himself, realizes he <br/>
needs our help to keep it in control.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5.  Help you son find and explore his interests - - i.e. If he likes <br/>
trains, let him explore that exclusively if it makes him happy. <br/>
<br/>
6.  Tell him for me - - His job right now is to be a 14 year old.  <br/>
Most of that academic stuff he is worried about is meaningless.  The <br/>
things I need, I&#39;ve learned.  The things I &quot;learned&quot; in school that I <br/>
didn&#39;t need are gone.  He has his whole life ahead of him to learn <br/>
things.  But right now, he needs to learn to be happy!<br/>

do anything to accommodate ADD students?<br/>
<br/>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
I would like to respond to your last question.<br/>
<br/>
First, I just want to say that I believe that unschooling is, by far, <br/>
the best way to let your children grow.  I am the mother of 7-year-old <br/>
unschooling twin boys.  I am also a former public high school geography <br/>
teacher.   I have seen and experienced first-hand, the damage that years <br/>
of schooling does to children, including myself.<br/>
<br/>
Public schools &quot;say&quot; they accommodate ADD children, but let me tell you <br/>
it is impossible for them to do so.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for <br/>
them to accommodate *anyone* when teachers such as I are assigned a <br/>
student load of between 150 - 190 students!  Even an elementary school <br/>
teacher with a ratio of 1:15 can not accommodate all his/her students, <br/>
ADD or no ADD.<br/>
<br/>
At my high school I was what was called an Inclusion Teacher.  This <br/>
means that 2 or 3 of the 6 geography classes I taught were Inclusion <br/>
classes.  Inclusion classes are those with between 5-15 special <br/>
education students (these include ADD students) learning side by side <br/>
with the so-called &quot;regular&quot; students.  There was usually a total of <br/>
30-35+ students in the class.  Inclusion classes also have an extra <br/>
teacher (special-ed certified) present in the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
I was very outspoken about my ideas on inclusion.  I was the only <br/>
teacher in the whole school who was for it. I found it very offensive to <br/>
see special ed kids separated from the regular-ed kids.  Inclusion <br/>
receives a lot of resistance from the teachers because it makes them <br/>
work so much harder.  Unfortunately, this work I am talking about <br/>
includes lots and lots of documentation that has to be made to prove <br/>
that you have made the modifications for the special ed students.<br/>
<br/>
These are some of the modifications I used to accommodate my special-ed <br/>
students:<br/>
<br/>
	1.  Allowed them to have more time to complete their homework or <br/>
classwork, if they needed it (this meant I had to make a note to myself <br/>
to remember to ask for this work at a future date - remember, I&#39;ve got <br/>
150+ students, I can&#39;t keep this in my head!)<br/>
<br/>
	2. Shorter and easier assignments (This must be noted in my grade-book)<br/>
<br/>
	3. Use an easier-to-read atlas. (This is noted in their IEP <br/>
(Individual Education Plan))<br/>
<br/>
	4. Allow them to have their own book to take home if the regular-ed <br/>
kids must use the class-room set.<br/>
<br/>
	5.  Easier and shorter versions of my quizzes/tests, etc.  (this <br/>
means I have to type up 2 versions of everything.  I was also an ESL <br/>
teacher, teaching 5 different levels of ESL(English as a  Second <br/>
Language) students, so I actually had 6 different versions of all my <br/>
quizzes, tests, Classroom/Homework assignments so I could accommodate <br/>
every one, supposedly!)<br/>
<br/>
	6. Special ed kids usually get preferential seating, usually at the <br/>
front of the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
	7.  More contact with the parents.  I made it a point to call 3 <br/>
parents every day of the week.  On weekdays, I did this from home in the <br/>
evening, after school.  I would go down my long list of students <br/>
(special ed students were always at the top, so they got more calls) and <br/>
telephone the parents of students that needed extra attention.  Both <br/>
negative and positive calls were made.<br/>
<br/>
	8.  All of my students were given my home telephone number and <br/>
email address, in case they ever had an questions or concerns and they <br/>
wanted to communicate with me in the evenings or on weekends.  I made an <br/>
extra effort with my special ed kids and their parents to assure them <br/>
that I was always available.  I would also work in my classroom until <br/>
5PM every afternoon.  My door would be open to anyone who needed any <br/>
extra help in any subject, not just geography.  I also made myself <br/>
available during my lunch time since I usually ate in my classroom.  I <br/>
would allow them to eat with me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I loved and cared for my students very much and, in a way, I miss being <br/>
a teacher.  But, let me tell you, I worked very, very hard and tried my <br/>
best to accommodate every one, especially my special-ed students, and I <br/>
know, with all certainty, that in NO WAY did I come close to <br/>
accommodating ANY of my students the way that I know a loving, caring <br/>
parent can!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long but I want to say one more thing.  If your son <br/>
decides to return to public school and he has been labeled as ADD, he <br/>
may be classified as a Special Ed student.  From my experience with many <br/>
other teachers (but, not all) here in Houston, Texas, the term &quot;Special <br/>
Ed.&quot; has a negative connotation.  It is unfortunate that with many (but <br/>
not all) teachers, when they see that star next to a student&#39;s name <br/>
signifying him/her as special-ed, their reaction is immediately <br/>
negative.  Thoughts of disruptive behiavior and extra work for the <br/>
teacher immediately come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
  Like in any other profession, there are some very caring and good <br/>
teachers and then there are some bad teachers.  Even though those who <br/>
try their very best to give everything they can to as many of their <br/>
students as possible, they can not give to those children what their <br/>
parents can give them for those 8+ hours of every day.  This is how I <br/>
feel about things and these have been some of my experiences.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2480288">Thank you for voicing your opinion first-hand. I have a neighbor who is a teacher and she expresses some of the same complaints, so I know it must be true. It really is a shame that some people start out wanting to give so much to teaching and leave frustrated because the system doesn&#39;t allow it. I have enjoyed some very nice friendships over the years with some of my childrens&#39; teachers. I even considered going into teaching myself. I would have had a lot of the same frustrations.<br/>

telephone the parents of students that needed extra attention.  Both <br/>
negative and positive calls were made.<br/>
<br/>
      8.  All of my students were given my home telephone number and <br/>
email address, in case they ever had an questions or concerns and they <br/>
wanted to communicate with me in the evenings or on weekends.  I made an <br/>
extra effort with my special ed kids and their parents to assure them <br/>
that I was always available.  I would also work in my classroom until <br/>
5PM every afternoon.  My door would be open to anyone who needed any <br/>
extra help in any subject, not just geography.  I also made myself <br/>
available during my lunch time since I usually ate in my classroom.  I <br/>
would allow them to eat with me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I loved and cared for my students very much and, in a way, I miss being <br/>
a teacher.  But, let me tell you, I worked very, very hard and tried my <br/>
best to accommodate every one, especially my special-ed students, and I <br/>
know, with all certainty, that in NO WAY did I come close to <br/>
accommodating ANY of my students the way that I know a loving, caring <br/>
parent can!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long but I want to say one more thing.  If your son <br/>
decides to return to public school and he has been labeled as ADD, he <br/>
may be classified as a Special Ed student.  From my experience with many <br/>
other teachers (but, not all) here in Houston, Texas, the term &quot;Special <br/>
Ed.&quot; has a negative connotation.  It is unfortunate that with many (but <br/>
not all) teachers, when they see that star next to a student&#39;s name <br/>
signifying him/her as special-ed, their reaction is immediately <br/>
negative.  Thoughts of disruptive behiavior and extra work for the <br/>
teacher immediately come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
  Like in any other profession, there are some very caring and good <br/>
teachers and then there are some bad teachers.  Even though those who <br/>
try their very best to give everything they can to as many of their <br/>
students as possible, they can not give to those children what their <br/>
parents can give them for those 8+ hours of every day.  This is how I <br/>
feel about things and these have been some of my experiences.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Maybe I should let him decide<br/>
&gt;&gt; for himself and maybe he&#39;ll decide to hs again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; An unschooling parent would adhere to this, in spite of how hard it <br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; be to watch a decision that you may know is inherently wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; But I also know that<br/>
&gt;&gt; if he does, he will feel very bad about himself if he finds returning<br/>
&gt;&gt; was a mistake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And then he can leave again. Sometimes one needs a few times to figure<br/>
&gt; out if their decision is the best one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I have considered waiting to see how the rest of this<br/>
&gt;&gt; year goes and if he is not doing better at home, there is no way he<br/>
&gt;&gt; could cut it in ps and maybe I should make that decision (although I<br/>
&gt;&gt; hesitate to).<br/>
&gt; ============<br/>
&gt; If he wants to go back. Let him. Also let him know that he has other<br/>
&gt; decisions. Such as unschooling. Its hard for a parent to step back, but<br/>
&gt; you need to at this point. Offer him his choices, you may even want to<br/>
&gt; sit down and write them out with him. Then support his decison and let<br/>
&gt; him know he can change at any point he wants and you will support that<br/>
&gt; too.<br/>
&gt; ==============<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with your advice here, Kolleen.  He should be allowed to <br/>
make the decision of whether to go back or not.  I would make it <br/>
absolutely clear, however, that he can leave and come back home to <br/>
unschooling at any time.  I think your suggestion of writing down the <br/>
choices, is a very good one.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; =============<br/>
&gt;&gt; I want him happy and to get back his self-esteem. Maybe<br/>
&gt;&gt; we need to take more of an unschooling approach and let him make his<br/>
&gt;&gt; own decisions about learning. Eventually he may pick up a book again.<br/>
&gt;&gt; He&#39;s very bright and loves computer programming.<br/>
&gt; =============<br/>
&gt; If you are waivering, then hopefully someone on this list can  help you<br/>
&gt; push you over the proverbial edge towards unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If he loves programming, then make that one of his choices, he can stay<br/>
&gt; home and program all day if he wishes.<br/>
&gt; ================<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s wonderful he&#39;s into computer programming.  If that&#39;s all he <br/>
does all day long, that is very productive.  If you think about it, it&#39;s <br/>
much more active than reading a book.  I would be thrilled if my boys <br/>
took to programming in the future.  I believe there is a very high <br/>
demand for computer programmers in the market place also.  Perhaps he <br/>
could get some kind of a job in that field - eventually?<br/>

&gt; give so much to teaching and leave frustrated because the system doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; allow it. I have enjoyed some very nice friendships over the years with <br/>
&gt; some of my childrens&#39; teachers. I even considered going into teaching <br/>
&gt; myself. I would have had a lot of the same frustrations.<br/>

quit to do something else.  They couldn&#39;t handle the system.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to respond to your last question.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great post, Mimi.  I&#39;ve saved it in case my son starts talking about school <br/>
again.  He still hadn&#39;t made up his mind by the end of summer this <br/>
year.  We went to visit a cousin I hadn&#39;t seen since 1985.  At that time, I <br/>
was unschooling my older boy, and my cousin was quite negative about <br/>
it.  This time was different.  She&#39;s been a special ed teacher for many <br/>
years now.  Through dinner she was going on about all the kids that she <br/>
hasn&#39;t been able to help because of the system and because of various <br/>
power-tripping principals, etc.  At the end of dinner, she leaned over to <br/>
my son and said, &quot;I can&#39;t remember what your mother told me.  Are you going <br/>
to school this year?&quot;  He thought for a second and then mumbled, &quot;no&quot;.  I <br/>
thanked her later.  I&#39;d let him go if he really wanted to, but I think it <br/>
would be a disaster.  And now the teachers are on strike, which in this <br/>
province means they have to teach but they don&#39;t have to do any of the <br/>
volunteer things they usually do, like coaching teams, putting on concerts <br/>
and plays, supervising clubs, etc.  All the stuff that makes school <br/>
bearable for a lot of kids.  That pretty well takes away all the reasons he <br/>
wanted to go.<br/>
