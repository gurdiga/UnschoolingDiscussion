<div id="ygrps-yiv-781833464">I would hate to see the children arguing over who cares for pets, and one of <br/>
them  threatening to let an animal starve in order to prove he&#39;s in control <br/>
of his decision to care for them. It makes pet care seem like a chore on the <br/>
order of dusting, and animals seem like.. well... furniture.<br/>
<br/>
We have guinea pigs, fish and a cat. I don&#39;t ask the kids to take care of <br/>
them. I model loving care and offer to let the kids hold, bathe, feed, or <br/>
whatever. Obviously, I am in charge of which pets to get, though. The kids <br/>
(9 and 5) have often asked for a dog, but I don&#39;t want to take care of one <br/>
and to me, it&#39;s wrong to let the care of a dog turn into fodder for <br/>
bickering, blaming or guilt-tripping.<br/>
<br/>
My mother surprised our kids (and especially ME) with hermit crabs and they <br/>
slowly died in their terrarium, despite my best efforts, research on the <br/>
Internet, books from the library, etc.  It gave me nightmares, literally.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best way to teach kids responsibility toward animals is to model <br/>
it, showing  them that it&#39;s a responsibility for mature people .... like <br/>
driving a car or caring for younger kids.<br/>
