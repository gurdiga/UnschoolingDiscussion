<div id="ygrps-yiv-23891767">Thanks, everyone for the recommendations for this game! It came in today! Sarah, Logan, and I played for an hour tonight and had a great time! Logan started to recognize some numbers as we played. Sarah did well, and even beat me a couple times and was using all four modes of operation. <br/>
 <br/>
I think this is going to become a favorite! I also bought the &quot;Guess Who?&quot; game that Sarah&#39;s been asking for for awhile, although we haven&#39;t put it together yet. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761718902">Oh, that one is a lot of fun.  My 4yo DS love to play that game with <br/>
us.  He also love Toy Story Yahtzee Jr., Trouble, Jenga, Connect Four, <br/>
Parcheesi, and Chutes and Ladders.<br/>
<br/>
Countdown I&#39;ve seen at Toys R Us....I&#39;ll have to give it a better look <br/>
and maybe pick it up next time we&#39;re there.  :)<br/>
