<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063642587"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;But... but... I&#39;m not always thinking. Sometimes I&#39;m just reacting.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes it&#39;s a gut-level &quot;this feels right&quot; type of thing. If I had to<br/>
&gt;analyze what I do enough to explain it to someone else it would drive me<br/>
&gt;nuts. I do what I do and that&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone *asks* you for your ideas or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;advice,  why does it bother you if they accept or<br/>
&gt;reject or totally ignore your advice? They might *appear* to ignore me at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the time, but they&#39;ll often come<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;around a day or two later <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is hard to impossible to &gt;do anything unthinkingly. But I don&#39;t see any<br/>
reason to be constantly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;analyzing, agonizing, poking, prodding, checking, rechecking, and<br/>
&gt;critically examining what we do. For some people, it&#39;s probably a<br/>
&gt;necessity. For others, it&#39;s a damned nuisance. <br/>
&gt;In thoughtful good fun,<br/>
&gt;Helen<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Helen, the more I hear, the more I like.  I often look at the world and<br/>
those around me in an analytical way.  But then I let these thoughts<br/>
percolate for a while, and I do not feel the need to constantly qualify<br/>
them to anyone, even myself.  The mind works in mysterious ways, and when<br/>
they are ready to come to fruition, they do.  I don&#39;t &quot;force&quot; myself to<br/>
examine and dissect my views and beliefs or lifestyle more than I feel<br/>
compelled to, any more than I feel a need to &quot;force&quot; my children to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I guess Sandra&#39;s attitude seemed to me to be &#39;Prove you are an Unschooler<br/>
and prove you mean it.&#39;  Which put me on the defensive, as I don&#39;t like not<br/>
being taken at my word, or being asked to prove I am &#39;worthy.&#39;  Not that<br/>
she was talking to me specifically, and she might not even have been<br/>
communicating that but that us what I heard.  I don&#39;t like argument and<br/>
contention for it&#39;s own sake.  I can debate with the best of them when I<br/>
feel there is a need and I feel strongly about the issue, but I don&#39;t pick<br/>
fights with unwilling partners, nor do I seek debate.  In coming here I<br/>
seek to learn, grow and get/give support.  In that capacity I think Snadra<br/>
has some wonderfully educational things to say and I do enjoy learing about<br/>
the views and ideas of others.  I just don&#39;t want participation to mean<br/>
that I have to walk through the gauntlet every time I communicate here,<br/>
know what I mean?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I sure do, Nanci. I&#39;ve been enjoying the sharing on this list. I hope it&#39;s<br/>
meeting people&#39;s needs as a list addressing unschooling issues.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been meaning to ask: Did anyone receive the message from Lisa this<br/>
morning about the &quot;News from AHA-Networking&quot; and the Statement about the<br/>
recent Gentle Spirit Magazine lawsuit? My copy came through blank and I&#39;ve<br/>
been assuming it was just a glitch in my software, but since there have<br/>
been no questions or comments on this critically important case I&#39;m<br/>
beginning to wonder if it was a misfire.<br/>
<br/>
Just in case, I&#39;ll forward the message we sent to the AHA lists this<br/>
morning, with apologies to everyone who&#39;s seeing this on many multiple<br/>
lists as it spreads through the homeschooling community. &lt;s&gt;<br/>

&quot;I took the road less travelled by,<br/>
and that has made all the difference.&quot;<br/>
