<br/>
I thought you might enjoy being a part of this. Out of all of the <br/>
billions <br/>
of people that live in the world, there has got to be somebody born on <br/>
each <br/>
date of the year. To try to accomplish this task of seeing if we can fill <br/>
<br/>
the calendar up with a birthday on every day of the year, add your birth <br/>
date to the list below. If your birth date is already listed, put a star <br/>
next to it! And then send this list to all of your friends, plus back to <br/>
<br/>
the person that sent it to you! Let&#39;s see if we can do it!!!! <br/>
(Remember, copying and pasting this to a NEW Email will keep it clean and <br/>
<br/>
make it easier to read than just forwarding it. And PLEASE, delete the <br/>
names it has been sent from and to -no one wants to scroll down a list of <br/>
<br/>
names to get to the message - Thanks! and Happy Birthday! <br/>
