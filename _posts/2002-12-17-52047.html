What is more important is how one feels and physically, how one is able to<br/>

Yes, but Shyrley was describing a 5&#39;10&quot; person at 70 lbs.!!! <br/>
I don&#39;t think many  people at that height are going to be much under 135 and <br/>
be healthy...that&#39;s all. Obviously there are exceptions. <br/>
And you are VERY think Karin!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467458810">Wow Karin,    you and I will have to get together and compare sometime,  I&#39;m also 5&#39; 9&quot; and if I get under 160,  people tell me to put on some weight.<br/>
 <br/>
I had a hard time growing up with weighing so much,       everyone is built so differently.    Needless to say I was an awesome offensive linesperson on my college flag football team.   Aargh!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452979208">I so agree Rachel Ann,    I don&#39;t have a scale anymore and I think I actually got healthier that way!<br/>
 <br/>
Speaking of thinness,   is anyone else sick of seeing the e-diets ad!!!!!!!    I hate the one with the heavier lady shriveling up.<br/>
 <br/>
That kind-of thing is what really bent my mind when I was a teenager.    I thought I needed to look like those models,    <br/>

Kelli,     who hates diets and is working very hard on raising her daughters to not worry about size and weight and to focus on being healthy and happy.<br/>
