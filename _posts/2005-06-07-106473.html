Writing about it is exactly what I did, when my daddy died in November. I <br/>
have more to pour out still, but sitting down and detailing the events of <br/>
his illness and death (he got sick on October 18, and died on November <br/>
5...three weeks) and crying my eyes out over the death, and the bits of <br/>
life, helped tremendously.<br/>

&gt;Subject: RE: Need help/advice for someone I don&#39;t really know at all<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am involved in a cancer-related e-board and a woman<br/>
&gt;whose mother died 7 weeks ago has begun posting about<br/>
&gt;her 16 year-old son who has started cutting school. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am sure that parents of teens will have better suggestions for her and <br/>
&gt;her<br/>
&gt;son than I will have - or better ways of expressing the idea of letting him<br/>
&gt;be and letting him also mourn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However as someone whose mother died of cancer this last January I do have <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;suggestion that helped me with my mourning. I felt very &quot;blocked&quot; and heavy<br/>
&gt;and was having trouble thinking or communicating clearly - either on line <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;to the people in my life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I found that I gained great sense of relief and release by sitting down for<br/>
&gt;a long uninterrupted session with my laptop and writing all I could <br/>
&gt;remember<br/>
&gt;about my mother&#39;s life and my own childhood with her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In my case it was a process of getting rid of a lot of negativity and<br/>
&gt;releasing anger and resentments. However recording joys and recollections <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;closeness might also be as freeing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For me it was a case of getting this stuff out of my head, and onto <br/>
&gt;&quot;paper&quot;,<br/>
&gt;so that my thinking was released - my brain ceased feeling like it was<br/>
&gt;stuffed with marshmallow the second I hit the final period. I was able to<br/>
&gt;start talking to others, and thinking logically again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If this lady is mourning and is as blocked as I was, she may be relying on<br/>
&gt;old routines and conventions to help her feel secure. She may be simply<br/>
&gt;unable, yet, to accept new ideas of any sort. Her son needs his time to<br/>
&gt;mourn also, including being angry and going through a period of questioning<br/>
&gt;or feeling everything is &quot;pointless&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If she is trying to force him to be &quot;normal&quot; because of her need for<br/>
&gt;normalcy, his mourning may last longer (like short circuiting deschooling<br/>
&gt;with &quot;suggestions&quot;). I think he will fight for autonomy because of his need<br/>
&gt;to mourn in his own way. However perhaps they both feel if they can just<br/>
&gt;hold on in their different ways until the summer break, that may provide an<br/>
&gt;anticipated and comfortable change in routine that will let them both mourn<br/>
&gt;fully.<br/>
