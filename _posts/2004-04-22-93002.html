<div id="ygrps-yiv-948996558">Yardsaling last week, I picked up a Star Wars Play Station Game, knowing <br/>
full well it could mean my induction to the Mommy Hall of Fame...  Hayden, <br/>
5, is giddily showing it to his friends and comments, &quot;I&#39;m SO glad I&#39;m an <br/>
unschooler!&quot; I was beaming but confused, so I asked, &quot;What does one have to <br/>
do with the other??&quot; &quot;Look mom! It says *T* and I&#39;m NOT a *T* but I can have <br/>
this game anyway!  THAT&#39;S why I&#39;m glad to be an unschooler!!&quot;  (the same boy <br/>
who is happy to announce he&#39;s a college student when people ask about his <br/>
*grade*)<br/>

Hannah, 7, has earned a promotion in Tae Kwon Do.  She brings me the sheet <br/>
that explains the testing, etc, and proclaims, &quot;I get to write an essay on <br/>
Respect!!&quot; (I love to write and I doubt I&#39;ve EVER said it quite this way <br/>
&lt;bg&gt;)<br/>
