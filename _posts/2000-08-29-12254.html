<div id="ygrps-yiv-507785389">Thanks to you all for your support. I am (was)a very organised person.<br/>
A time and place for evry thing - even learning!  I am getting <br/>
better, though I still have days of doubt.  I have suggested we go to <br/>
the library in town instead of the local one - even visit the art <br/>
gallery, but I always get a very negative response. So I guess i will <br/>
have to hang in there and wait....<br/>
I enjoy reading this message board.<br/>
