<div id="ygrps-yiv-224639847">&lt;&lt; another book called The Pinball Effect, shelved with history).  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In spite of the overlaps, it helps us to locate things.In the section we <br/>
could call<br/>
math are only a couple of  &quot;fun with math&quot; type things that I bought when I <br/>
was supply teaching, and a textbook or two.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what &quot;supply teaching&quot; is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;but are there any writers who are able to let me in on their sense of <br/>
wonder, on their<br/>
AHA&#39;s and on what grips them in mathematics?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do they have to be &quot;real writers,&quot; or can they be people here?  Would you <br/>
feel better having a bought book in your math section than just actually <br/>
trying the ideas here?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Let me try it this way,--I am touched emotionally, sometimes moved to tears <br/>
by music, poetry, prose, paintings, photographs, films, dance, plays and <br/>
people&#39;s actions.  I&#39;ve not yet been touched by anything that I recognize as <br/>
mathematical, but I believe it to be possible.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people are touched emotionally by a really great football move.  <br/>
(bodily/kinesthetic)  <br/>
<br/>
Some are moved to tears by their own thoughts and new ideas. (intrapersonal)<br/>
<br/>
Some are mesmerized for hours or a lifetime by flowers and bees and birdsong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your list above covered all the rest except mathematical (&quot;the rest&quot; and &quot;the <br/>
all&quot; being Gardner&#39;s Multiple Intelligences).<br/>
<br/>
Some people are tone deaf.  Some get hives even thinking about walking in the <br/>
woods.  Some ignore all artistry in language--use it JUST as a tool and never <br/>
perceive art in the arrangement or sound or content of words.  Some think <br/>
sports is stupid, dance is a waste of time, and never in the least recognize <br/>
their friends at a distance by the way they walk.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not bad people, or lazy or ignorant people.    They just have <br/>
different &quot;intelligences,&quot; they&#39;re thinking of the world in the languages <br/>
that work best for them.<br/>
<br/>
Our culture has prized verbal and mathematical far above all the rest.  It&#39;s <br/>
officially okay for someone to be lacking in social skills as long as they <br/>
have a high SAT score.  It&#39;s okay to lack philosophy or grace as long as <br/>
you&#39;re a good test taker.<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s the library problem.<br/>
<br/>
I have a math/science section, but it&#39;s combined with oddity, trivia and <br/>
puzzles.  It flows into psychology and medical/biochemical issues.   I have <br/>
menopause, LSD, Prozac, puberty and the women&#39;s movement stuff all <br/>
surrounding math.   The public library probably doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
I have history books divided into Roman and medieval European and Renaissance <br/>
and  American and New Mexico.  There are books that straddle.  There are <br/>
books in religion that are all about history.  There are books on the shelf <br/>
with English that are all about history.   <br/>
<br/>
The original charge here that some libraries have no books on math is really <br/>
interesting.  Math doesn&#39;t come in words very well.  I have a couple of <br/>
&quot;books on music&quot; which have no written-out music, and have no CD or record or <br/>
tape, and have few pictures, just words.  They&#39;re WEIRD, even those I know <br/>
lots about.  They&#39;re not for reading through like a story, they&#39;re like giant <br/>
footnotes.  Some are the result and by-product of some guy getting a music <br/>
degree fifty or a hundred years ago.  Reading what someone thought about the <br/>
development of baroque melodic line and counterpoint is NOT fun reading.  And <br/>
it&#39;s no starting place, or ending place, for musicians.   Reading theories on <br/>
the collection of ballads in Scandinavia and Germanic-speaking lands is not <br/>
about music.  It&#39;s about culture and folklore.  Putting it on the shelf with <br/>
fairy tales isn&#39;t right though.  Maybe I should put it with math and science. <br/>
  To someone who doesn&#39;t know what a ballad is, though, it&#39;s not a book for <br/>
reading at all.  It&#39;s just nonsense out of context.<br/>
<br/>
So will having more books with words about math help a family in which <br/>
patterns don&#39;t jump out and dance?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Silicon Valley has a lot of people who are good in math skills and lacking<br/>
in most others.  Some of them are quite wealthy too!  A friend of mine<br/>
was talking about her husband&#39;s difficulties in getting along with coworkers<br/>
and bosses.  She seemed to think it was the norm and was surprised to hear<br/>
that my husband was able to be friendly with his coworkers. I remember <br/>
working with people who could hardly answer a &quot;hello&quot; but could spend hours <br/>
discussing their latest computer game or section of code.  Some of them<br/>
do eventually learn other skills and others don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Of course many might have a hard time thinking of Silicon Valley as the<br/>
&quot;real world&quot; - even some of us who live here!&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but do we want to measure success in the real world only in terms of <br/>
career success? I&#39;m thinking there are also all those hours spent outside of <br/>
the office. Those are the times where people may have to learn some other <br/>
skills if they want to &quot;succeed&quot;. Of course, lots of times people without <br/>
these skills don&#39;t care to have lots of friends, or think outside of their <br/>
own little world,  so it may not be an issue for them. It may be for their <br/>
immediate friends/family though.<br/>

inner anxieties about their kids inability to spell or spit out <br/>
multiplication facts. I have, in the past, found it a whole lot easier to <br/>
think this way about other people&#39;s kids. I think I&#39;m usually pretty much <br/>
there now, though, for my own kids too. It has taken years of rubbing <br/>
shoulders with people I could learn it from, though, and experience and <br/>
observation of people with these kinds of new thoughts in my head and lots <br/>
and lots of reading. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Quite wealthy in terms of money, I suppose you meant, right? But I think the <br/>
question is deeper than that. The question is more like: &quot;Schools highly <br/>
value certain skills - writing, math, and test-taking. Outside of school, <br/>
though, what makes for a &quot;successful life?&quot; What is &quot;valued&quot; outside of <br/>
school? Well - yeah - people with lousy interpersonal skills, no appreciation <br/>
of nature, little intrapersonal intelligence, a lack of interest in fine arts <br/>
or beautiful language --- those people can make a bunch of money sometimes. <br/>
But the real question is what kind of &quot;life&quot; do they live? Not how much money <br/>
do they make. What is highly valued outside of school? What HAS value? Do <br/>
they have friends and families who value them - do they feel loved and <br/>
cherished? Is their work of value to the world in some way - do they feel <br/>
they are contributing something important - does it add beauty or <br/>
understanding or help people to live better or ? What is valued outside of <br/>
school? My expert test-taking skills are of NO value in any sense - they <br/>
contribute nothing to the world that is of any value whatsoever. My ability <br/>
to sense when a child&#39;s feelings are being hurt and to be able to help them <br/>
work it out -- THAT is of actual real value in the world. What skills &quot;count&quot; <br/>
in the real world? In my own real world &lt;g&gt; it is clear that those  <br/>
intelligences not typically highly-valued in school count a LOT.<br/>
