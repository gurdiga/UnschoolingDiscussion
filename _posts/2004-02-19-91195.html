What I meant by this was that as a safety net, unless a child shows<br/>
physical signs of abuse (scars or bruises) the child would have to talk<br/>
about the abuse to someone.  If that child doesnt talk, there is no<br/>
net.  I dont like the assumption that going to school means you wont<br/>
be abused.  Even reasoning that the more people who come into contact<br/>
with an abused child will be able to detect the abuse, that does not<br/>
mean that a child who shows no physical bruising or scarring will even<br/>
be noticed just because he/she goes to school.   If a child is being<br/>
mentally abused, as was the case on this show, I dont believe just<br/>
going to public school would catch the abuse.  <br/>
 <br/>
Im not sure what you meant, Sandra, by saying that some Homeschoolers<br/>
use physical punishment related to schoolwork.  While being correct, Im<br/>
not sure how that related to what I was saying about schools being<br/>
safety nets.  <br/>

I know people throughout history have killed each other.  The line from<br/>

Its true that it would be better for the molester not to have his child<br/>
go to school  less of a chance of detection.  I get that.  I just dont<br/>
want the media and the schools saying that by homeschooling we are not<br/>
allowing our children the safety net of public schooling catching child<br/>
abuse.  What if the child is one of those kids who is never noticed much<br/>
by anyone anyway?  Is going to school going to catch the fact that she<br/>
is being molested?  Maybe, maybe not.  How many children who were<br/>
molested went through ps and graduated without anyone ever knowing the<br/>
truth?  Well probably never know.  I think that neighbors and others<br/>
are also an asset.  If you know that someone has a child and that child<br/>
is never seen outside the home and acts strange when you do see them  I<br/>
think that would be noticed.    <br/>
 <br/>
Abusers are going to abuse.  Keeping the child home under the guise of<br/>
homeschooling is something that happens, Im sure.  Im not sure what<br/>
the answer is, however.  I dont believe that more regulation of<br/>
homeschooling is the answer, though.  School or Homeschool, children are<br/>
always, as sick as it makes me, targets.   How do you fix the problem of<br/>
abuse itself?  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t forget that students can be abused at school.  Emotional abuse by <br/>
other students and teachers is especially prevalent.  When I went to school, I <br/>
had a fifth grade teacher who paddled students, and physical punishment was <br/>
not allowed in school in NY where I lived.  I&#39;m sure other teachers and some <br/>
parents were aware that this was against the law, but nothing was done about it.  <br/>
The teacher retired the next year.<br/>

<br/>
If you are not going to school because of fear of being shot at school, you<br/>
are being paranoid.<br/>
<br/>
The most dangerous place a child will ever be is in their car.  Most of us<br/>
place our kids in cars every day without even thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
Being shot by some nut seems much scarier than a car wreck but it is also<br/>
much, much less likely.  So unless people are willing to discuss not<br/>
allowing their kids in cars because of the danger as a pragmatic idea, I<br/>
think talking about not allowing kids in schools because of the danger is<br/>
outside the realm of rationality.<br/>
<br/>
Not aimed at anyone, just my thoughts on the subject.<br/>

common thing that I must protect my child from is just odd.  Its like the<br/>
people that won&#39;t fly on planes because of terrorist scares.  It is such an<br/>
unusual happening that it is irrational to be concerned about it happening<br/>
to you (general you).<br/>
<br/>
On the list of &quot;what is gonna get you&quot;, school shootings is way, way down<br/>
there.  We should be much more freaked out about cancer, HIV, car wrecks,<br/>
old age for pete&#39;s sake, and lets not forget that most people who are<br/>
murdered are killed by a family member.<br/>

This may have stemmed from my particular criticism of the show, in which the<br/>
school official and the teacher were saying that school provided two needed<br/>
safety nets � one being that they would catch abuse, and then the second net<br/>
(which speaks to the idea that teachers have to be trained experts) that<br/>
only the school staff would be able to discern learning difficulties or<br/>
emotional problems that would be missed by home educating parents (not only<br/>
abusing parents). This was a point that I expressed badly in my first email<br/>
on the topic. The assumption that hs�ers would be less competent than a<br/>
teacher and basically unobservant, was equally as annoying as the idea that<br/>
all homeschoolers should be at least suspected of some weirdness if not<br/>
abusiveness, until proven otherwise. The way the fact that this sad family<br/>
were homeschoolers was dramatically revealed, right before the commercial<br/>
break, with all the significant looks between the two cops � In any tv or<br/>
film narrative, the attitudes are not expressed only in the bare storyline,<br/>
but also in the structure and supporting artistry. Eg I liked the way all<br/>
the food was arranged with symmetrical precision in very high shelves (so<br/>
the youngest couldn�t get to it himself). I noticed that the product<br/>
placement people had nothing in this home. That means the food vendors<br/>
didn�t like the inference that only loony oddballs avoid preservatives in<br/>
their food. <br/>
<br/>
I was watching because dh wanted to for some reason, it�s not one of my<br/>
favorite shows. My favorite cop type show is Redcap � BBC America. Cool<br/>
English characters and different types of crimes � the redcaps are military<br/>
police, in this case on tour of duty in Germany � just layers of stuff in<br/>
every episode. New season just started :-)<br/>

<br/>
I know its true too, but I don&#39;t agree that increased regulation of homeschoolers is going to solve the problem of abuse.<br/>
<br/>
As has been stated, people have been killing each other (and abusing each other) for centuries.  Increasing regulation on homeschoolers is not going to change that even in the homeschooling population.  Regulating the many to catch the few is not going to eliminate abuse, or even minimize it.<br/>
<br/>
But it will take away the freedoms of parents who don&#39;t abuse their children.<br/>

  Responses to two different posts on the same topic:<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; If you are not going to school because of fear of being shot at school, you<br/>
<br/>
  are being paranoid. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  But if you take school shootings as evidence that school is pushing people to <br/>
  the point that they will snap, it might be worth not sending kids to school <br/>
  because of the cause, not the result.<br/>
<br/>
  And a car accident is usually the result of error.<br/>
  People who bring a gun to school knew they were going to, knew they did, and <br/>
  some of them decide on victims and some are just opportunists.<br/>
<br/>
  There are gun accidents, and there&#39;s Russian roulette.  They&#39;re not the same <br/>
  thing.  Being in a car to go to a fun place isn&#39;t the same as a kid saying &quot;I <br/>
  don&#39;t want to go to school, it&#39;s stupid,&quot; and the mom saying &quot;You HAVE to go <br/>
  to school, there&#39;s no option,&quot; and then that kid being killed in school by <br/>
  gunshot, hazing, being beat up in a bathroom, overdose of drugs, knife fight <br/>
  (can&#39;t think of other known deaths at school at the moment).   <br/>
<br/>
  Neither is just a statistical in-the-moment thing.  There are reasons and <br/>
  justifications and some are more reasonable and justifiable than others.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-What I meant by this was that as a safety net, unless a child shows<br/>
<br/>
  physical signs of abuse (scars or bruises) the child would have to talk<br/>
<br/>
  about the abuse to someone. -=-<br/>
<br/>
  Bruises are easy to explain away.<br/>
  The parents I&#39;m thinking of just used to keep the kids home a week until the <br/>
  bruises were gone.<br/>
<br/>
  What isn&#39;t as easy to explain away is when you ask a kid if everything&#39;s okay <br/>
  and his eyes fill with tears and he can&#39;t say a word.<br/>
<br/>
  -=- I don&#39;t like the assumption that going to school means you won&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
  be abused. -=-<br/>
<br/>
  Nobody said that.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-Even reasoning that the more people who come into contact<br/>
<br/>
  with an abused child will be able to detect the abuse, that does not<br/>
<br/>
  mean that a child who shows no physical bruising or scarring will even<br/>
<br/>
  be noticed just because he/she goes to school.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
  But he&#39;ll never be noticed at school if he never goes to school.<br/>
<br/>
  Taking it to the extreme in either direction isn&#39;t helpful.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure what you meant, Sandra, by saying that some Homeschoolers<br/>
<br/>
  use physical punishment related to schoolwork. -=-<br/>
<br/>
  Spankings.  Swats with rods.  For not doing work well or on time or not being <br/>
  cooperative or not being obedient.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-While being correct, I&#39;m<br/>
<br/>
  not sure how that related to what I was saying about schools being<br/>
<br/>
  safety nets.-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If professional educators know those families exist and ANYone says that it&#39;s <br/>
  ludicrous to think that any homeschoolers are keeping their children home to <br/>
  cover abuse, the educators are more in the right than the person who defended <br/>
  homeschooling on general principal in an extreme way.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-It&#39;s true that it would be better for the molester not to have his child<br/>

<br/>
  -=-How many children who were<br/>
<br/>
  molested went through ps and graduated without anyone ever knowing the<br/>
<br/>
  truth?  We&#39;ll probably never know. -=-<br/>
<br/>
  We definitely will never know.  But a school employee who knows of ONE case <br/>
  has reason to suspect there might be others.<br/>
<br/>
  A famous logic example is to consider whether all dogs have four legs.  No, <br/>
  some dogs for one reason or another only have three legs.  You only need to <br/>
  know of ONE three-legged dog to prove that not all dogs have four legs.  But <br/>
  having seen one three legged dog, it would be unreasonable to say &quot;All dogs except <br/>
  one have four legs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; How do you fix the problem of abuse itself?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Nobody ever will.  My concern in this discussion is the abuse of truth and of <br/>
  rational thought.  We can&#39;t stop that altogether either, but we can point at <br/>
  it when we see it.<br/>

Incest families tend to be very closed and enmeshed.  They interact less with other people, on average, than other families.  When a family is homeschooling it would naturally cause a red flag to go up for anyone who is familiar with this pattern.  Anytime a family has a shaming secret, such as abuse or addiction, it is going to be more difficult for the kids when they are cutoff from contact with outsiders.<br/>

 <br/>
My point was not that people like that didn&#39;t exist, just that the tone<br/>
of the show (which was what my original post was about and related to)<br/>
pushed the idea that hs&#39;ing was done more often than not to hide child<br/>
abuse and that ps was a better choice because a child would be noticed<br/>
more.  The truth is that some children are never noticed and although<br/>
kids are abused in hs and ps settings, making all kids go to ps just to<br/>
catch those that could possibly be abused is not the answer either.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-It&#39;s true that it would be better for the molester not to have his<br/>
child<br/>

 <br/>
-=-You know it&#39;s true but you don&#39;t want it said? How can you have<br/>
both?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I am not saying I didn&#39;t want it said.  I am saying that I don&#39;t like<br/>
the media pushing the idea that hs&#39;ing itself is done to hide child<br/>
abuse by a majority.  The point they push is that hs&#39;ers need to be<br/>
heavily regulated by the ps system and home visits and that would<br/>
prevent these problems (the safety net talked about in the show).<br/>
That&#39;s like saying if I put a 3-legged dog in a cage, I can keep an eye<br/>
on it to make sure nothing happens to it. If you take away the rights of<br/>
hs&#39;ers to hs without heavy regulation on the chance that some of those<br/>
hs&#39;ers are doing it to hide child abuse, what good does that do for the<br/>
others that are fine?  Using your example, does taking a child out of<br/>
school for a week due to child abuse mean that three other families need<br/>
to be investigated because they took their children on extended<br/>
vacations?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong of the media to share the good<br/>
stories and bad stories, I think there needs to be a better balance.<br/>
Between the news story that ran a few months ago and the Law & Order<br/>
show the other night, hs&#39;ers are not getting a balanced showing (for<br/>
lack of a better word).  I don&#39;t want extremes, my desire is balance.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-How many children who were molested went through ps and graduated<br/>
without anyone ever knowing the truth?  We&#39;ll probably never know. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
-=-We definitely will never know.  But a school employee who knows of<br/>

But <br/>
having seen one three legged dog, it would be unreasonable to say &quot;All<br/>
dogs except <br/>
one have four legs.&quot;-=-<br/>
 <br/>
My point was the same as yours in that there is never just one isolated<br/>
case for anything (abuse or 3 legged dogs).  You don&#39;t need to know that<br/>
child abuse exists to know that people of all walks of life are abusers.<br/>
Again, a balance.  I don&#39;t believe that more restrictions on how we hs<br/>
and having in-home visits (an idea I&#39;ve heard from ps teachers) is the<br/>
answer.  I do not propose to have all the answers as to how I would like<br/>
to balance it out.  <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; How do you fix the problem of abuse itself?&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>

When homeschoolers have a kneejerk reaction and deny any whiff of suggestion <br/>

<br/>
&quot;The media&quot; isn&#39;t doing anything.  Individual writers and directors and <br/>

is no big committee meeting at &quot;the media&quot; headquarters planning what their <br/>

<br/>
But if there is a person who thinks there are maybe a few questionable <br/>
homeschooling families and they are met with a seeming wall of homeschoolers saying <br/>
&quot;Get thee behind me, satanic media, there are NO questionable homeschoolers,&quot; <br/>
they&#39;re likely to think still that some homeschoolers are questionable and <br/>
that others are absolutely liars.  When people lie, it&#39;s assumed they have <br/>
something to hide.  And &quot;NO, ye demons, there are NO three legged dogs&quot; is a lie.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime there is a call for homeschoolers to get up a collective head of <br/>
defensive steam, I&#39;m going to stand on the side and remind people to be honest and <br/>
not just succumb to mob mentality.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The committee meeting is before the season when the story editor, producers,<br/>
possibly executive producers (although that person may just send a memo with<br/>
suggestions), head writer, and probably someone connected with marketing or<br/>
ad sales. Here the storylines for the season are decided, and then assigned<br/>
to the staff writers. With a show like L&A which tries to stay current �<br/>
�ripped from the headlines� � there is more leeway. Once a show is a hit,<br/>
the actors get more power too. They might come in with ideas � they�d like<br/>
to see their character show more softness, or have a love interest, or get<br/>
passionate about some issue that may parallel the actor�s interest. At the<br/>
end of the meeting the list of stories and issues gets sent to the legal<br/>
department, and research department, so that any problems will be caught<br/>
early. One thing research does is ensure that the names used for characters<br/>
don�t coincide with any well known individuals. Legal helps them walk the<br/>
fine line between being provocative and being sued � or worse losing<br/>
advertisers.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine the story conference about this one. �Let�s do one about those<br/>
starved kids in Jersey � Yeah but it needs a twist � what about a kid does<br/>
the killing � but it�s the mother�s idea �cos she�s paranoid � Great, keep<br/>
working on it and get research on to the homeschooling thing � Yeah this is<br/>
a really important issue, now on to the season finale, Fred has some great<br/>
opportunities for advertiser tie-ins if we add a character who�s been<br/>
abusing diet pills���<br/>
<br/>
BTW people get invited to send in spec scripts to the head writers all the<br/>
time. The chances of these being produced are slim. However they are seen<br/>
more as writing samples and writers may be hired on to the team. Most places<br/>
will not open an unsolicited script (fear of being accused of plagiarism and<br/>
sued).<br/>
