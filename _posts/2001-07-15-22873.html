<div id="ygrps-yiv-792942275">Hello...My 2 daughters and I will be visiting relatives in the <br/>
Phila.  &#39;burbs in mid-August...(hubby works too much this time of <br/>
year to go!)  I thought I&#39;d head out to Lancaster Co. for a mini-<br/>
vacation and figured I would ask anyone in that area for some good <br/>
ideas on where to stay or visit.  <br/>
We will probably hit Hershey Park, the heart of Amish Country (I <br/>
haven&#39;t been there in years!), the Sight & Sound Theater & Strasburg <br/>
Railroad...any ideas ?    <br/>
Any good books (ages 5 & 8) on the area you could recommend ?<br/>
   Thanks to all !  <br/>

We spent a few days in Pennsylvania last month, going to Gettysburg, <br/>
Hershey, and the Crayola factory (Easton).  Email me at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:RNorell@...">RNorell@...</a> if you would like me to email you the journal I <br/>
wrote during that part of our trip.  I will also include the journal <br/>
from when we went to Philadelphia for a couple days last fall.<br/>
<br/>
Other good areas - if you like trains, Strasburg is a must.  Amish <br/>
country is a wonderful option too.<br/>
