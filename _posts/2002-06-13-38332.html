<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056553825">All good answers --- are they &quot;expecting&quot; the radical unschooling point of <br/>
view? I&#39;m also giving a talk this week (along with someone else) to people <br/>
just considering homeschooling and we always struggle with how much to make <br/>
it unschooling-based versus how much to just be more objective and tell them <br/>
about all the different ways homeschoolers homeschool. In my case, they are <br/>
definitely NOT expecting an unschooling talk. They&#39;ve probably never heard of <br/>
such ideas. So, clearly, we&#39;ll talk about it -- but .....<br/>
<br/>
Some of your answers were kind of amusing --- especially this one: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;13. How do you choose which homeschool resources, books, and curricula to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>use, and where do you get them?<br/>
<br/>
A. It doesn&#39;t matter. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
And THIS is so important!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;HINT: It will never be algebra or french or social studies or etc,<br/>
etc. It will be airplanes, or dinosaurs or money or the sky or etc, etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THIS is something I think we forget to tell people -- I remember that it took <br/>
me forever to catch on that with unschooling, my kids were probably NEVER <br/>
going to say: &quot;Okay - now I&#39;m interested in social studies,&quot; &lt;G&gt;. In fact, <br/>
they were probably never going to say, &quot;I&#39;d like to study American history,&quot; <br/>
even. They&#39;d just DO it -- pick it up from everything going on around them - <br/>
from movies and reading and discussions and happenstance and music and so on. <br/>
What they&#39;d be passionately interested in would be very specific and <br/>
idiosyncratic such as Gilbert and Sullivan musicals or female folk singers of <br/>
the 1960&#39;s or how surfboards were made in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s or how guns <br/>
worked during the civil war period. Even those unschooled kids I know who <br/>
develop an interest in, say, &quot;American History,&quot; have a very very specific <br/>
kind of history they are interested in - military history, for example.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of people THINK we&#39;re telling them that, if they let their kids <br/>
have real freedom to choose, their kids will regain their love of learning <br/>
(which is true), and that they&#39;ll choose to learn the same kinds of things in <br/>
the same kinds of ways that schools try to teach (which is highly unlikely).<br/>
