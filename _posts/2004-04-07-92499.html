<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046965446">We&#39;ve been having an &quot;it works!&quot; week around here it seems.  My 3 1/2 yr old <br/>
son is currently building a huge castle with mega blocks in the living room.  <br/>
In the last few weeks he&#39;s gotten some books from the library and off ebay <br/>
about castles and medieval times.  Last weekend he even got grandma to sew him an <br/>
awesome knight costume with his help of course!<br/>
Yesterday, he was removing the cushions off the couch to build yes, a castle <br/>
out of them when he says &quot;Mom, there are 3 cushions on the couch, when I take <br/>
1 off, then there are only 2 left!&quot;<br/>
Then he wanted to make & play with index cards an alphabet and shapes <br/>
matching game.  Then we found when cleaning up the scrapbook supplies, a paint with <br/>
water castle & pirate book in my cupboard of old teaching supplies (former <br/>
career of mine).  Then he practiced writing his name and a few other letters on <br/>
his &quot;work papers&quot; for daddy and used rubber stamps to make  gift bags to put <br/>
them in.<br/>
Right now he&#39;s taking a break from building the castle to sort the megablocks <br/>
people into piles of police men, airport guys, and sorting the blocks by size <br/>
and color!<br/>
And people think that children&#39;s play is &quot;just play&quot;.<br/>
Anyways, just wanted to share.  I&#39;ve been trying to remember what sort of fun <br/>
&quot;learning activities&quot; go on around here during the day to tell my husband <br/>
about when he gets home.  Still working on convincing him about this, you see.  <br/>
Think I&#39;ll go play on the old but new (to us) BLUE piano that we just <br/>
purchased to have fun with!  <br/>
