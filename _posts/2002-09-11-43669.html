<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m just curious to know how college fits into the unschooling<br/>
&gt; philosophy in general and in the actual lives of your children. I<br/>
&gt; mean, I realize that an unschooling parent wouldn&#39;t coerce/push/bribe<br/>
&gt; (as in Sandra&#39;s humorous example) a child to attend college, or even<br/>
&gt; assume that college is a given for their child. But do children who<br/>
&gt; have been unschooled feel a need or desire for college? Do those who<br/>
&gt; decide on college need to do some preparation to &quot;get them ready&quot; for<br/>
&gt; the schoolish way of doing things (e.g. exams, papers, lectures,<br/>
&gt; etc.)? What has been your experience?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can give you our current experience with our unschooled kids:<br/>
<br/>
I teach part-time at a local community college and my kids have hung out at <br/>
colleges for their whole lives - we go to concerts and theater events there, <br/>
etc. So - it was very natural for them to want to do things there, too. My <br/>
oldest signed up for a voice class and a piano class when she was 13, almost <br/>
14. She loved it. The next semester she was invited to sing in a jazz singing <br/>
group and she took a psychology class and ceramics. After that she took <br/>
speech and got onto the forensics team and competed in debate tournaments, <br/>
etc. She took photography and had some large mural portraits displayed in a <br/>
student show in a gallery in Laguna Beach (artsy-fartsiest place in Southern <br/>
California &lt;G&gt;). She is now in her fifth year of taking classes there - she&#39;s <br/>
taken academic courses like history and math and composition and she&#39;s taken <br/>
lots of fine arts classes and she&#39;s had a blast, but she&#39;s now very restless. <br/>
She wants to move on to something &quot;more&quot; - but can&#39;t decide what. She has an <br/>
urge to &quot;just travel&quot; for some months - wants to visit all her unschooling <br/>
friends all over the US and Canada. Sometimes she wants to transfer to a <br/>
university. I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;ll end up doing. She also has a 30+ hours <br/>
per week job that she absolutely loves - at Laguna Clay Company which is a <br/>
very large manufacturer of glazes and clays and pottery equipment.<br/>
<br/>
She has very high grades, nearly all A&#39;s, and has had absolutely no trouble <br/>
at all in adjusting to taking classes and studying and taking exams, etc. It <br/>
is easy for her. She&#39;s also had no trouble adjusting to working - she&#39;s <br/>
responsible and a very-much-valued employee.<br/>
<br/>
But - now - here she is at almost-18 and taking ceramics, print-making, and a <br/>
math class and I think she&#39;s burned out on school and needs time off and away <br/>
from it.<br/>
<br/>
My second child is following the same path -- but is into music and theater <br/>
as well as computer programming. She&#39;s almost 15. No problems with handling <br/>
the college classes -- high grades and is enjoying it a LOT.<br/>

Thanks so much for your response, Pam! This is exactly the kind of<br/>
thing I was wondering about. I have *felt* that this would be the case<br/>
if unschooling was embraced fully, but I guess I have needed some<br/>
real-life examples to reassure me. The college question is one that<br/>
has come up in discussions with my husband about unschooling. (After<br/>
reading about some other husbands on this list, I feel so lucky that<br/>
he is *far* from reluctant about the issue--we have been researching<br/>
it together and he is very pro-unschooling.) I have a feeling that<br/>
many of our extended family members will bring that one up, too, since<br/>
higher education is a big priority in our families. I really<br/>
appreciate you sharing your experience with me--I think it will help<br/>
to offer &quot;testimonials&quot; like this to skeptical relatives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
