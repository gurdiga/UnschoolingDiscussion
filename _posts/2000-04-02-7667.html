&lt;&lt; It is absolutely the most superior wonder food in existence<br/>
 on the planet and no informed person could possibly deny that for their<br/>
 child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OK - this is what I was talking about.  Tracy (a LLL leader, and a firm <br/>
believer in the benefits of breastfeeding) emailed me off list and asked <br/>
about my reasons for feeding my children the way I do.  She presented her <br/>
question in a respectful, adult fashion.  Because of her attitude I was happy <br/>
to respond to her.  This, on the other hand, is nothing but inflammatory.   I <br/>
could respond to this post by explaining some of the valid reasons for <br/>
bottlefeeding, but I won&#39;t because you don&#39;t deserve my consideration.  You <br/>
established that with the tone of your post.  Clearly you decided not to <br/>
honor the request that I made about keeping this kind of attitude off of the <br/>
list, or even posting about breastfeeding under the subject line <br/>
&quot;breastfeeding&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
There ARE valid reasons for bottlefeeding.  Perhaps one might have to be <br/>
willing to expand one&#39;s viewpoint in order to understand them.  We should all <br/>
be familiar with that concept since we are unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
Get over yourself and your own opinions.    BTW, I was a licensed <br/>
breastfeeding consultant  and support leader for several years and therefore <br/>
am quite familiar with all the merits of breastfeeding, so you don&#39;t need to <br/>
go there.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to flame away - it will only further establish the fact that you <br/>
have a tremendous attitude problem and are judgmental and meddling.   How <br/>
other people feed their children is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  You can not pass <br/>
any kind of legitimate judgment on them.   I&#39;ll say it once again - get over <br/>
yourself.  Nobody placed you in charge of monitoring my children&#39;s nutrition. <br/>
 Geesh.</div>

&lt;&lt; imo <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sulan@...">sulan@...</a> could have said, if she was interested in a hearty<br/>
 discussion rather than a full blown fight: &#39;There ARE valid reasons for<br/>
 bottlefeeding. &#39;(quote from sulan&#39;s post) then added her personal reasons.<br/>
 it&#39;s too bad you didn&#39;t express these reasons it would have helped &#39;expand<br/>
 one&#39;s viewpoint in order to understand&#39; (another quote from sulan&#39;s post).<br/>
 then you could have politely disagreed stating that even though informed, <br/>
some<br/>
 people would still not chose breastfeeding and this decision does not reflect<br/>
 on a person&#39;s intellect.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
from this perspective the<br/>
comment that upset &#39;sulan&#39; makes sense but from the perspective of a person<br/>
who has chosen not to breastfeed, for whatever reason,  i can see the<br/>
statement as insensitive and possibly argumentative.<br/>
<br/>
Susan,<br/>
I think somehow it has gotten twisted around.  The above quotes that you have <br/>
attributed to sulan as argumentative were actually my words - I don&#39;t want <br/>
you to think that sulan was guilty when actually it was me!  Also, these <br/>
words WERE written from the viewpoint of a person who has chose not to <br/>
breastfeed.  It gets confusing with all the cutting and pasting.  <br/>
<br/>
Could my words be read as argumentative?  Yep, I admit it.  Was I angry?  <br/>
Absolutely.  Lynda suggests that it would have been helpful for me to state <br/>
what some of those valid reasons (for not breastfeeding) were.  But that is <br/>
my whole point - it is absolutely irrelevant what they were!  They are no <br/>
one&#39;s business and no one should pass judgment on my method of feeding my <br/>
child for ANY reason!  <br/>
<br/>
Notice that I never, EVER entered into a debate about whether breastmilk is <br/>
best for babies.  In fact, I stated that of course it IS best for babies.  <br/>
But some felt it necessary to argue the virtues of breastmilk and, taking it <br/>
a step further, compare formula to trash from a dumpster.  Why, in order to <br/>
show how good one thing is, is it necessary to state how bad another thing <br/>
is???  It&#39;s true - the dumpster comments were NOT directed solely at me.  But <br/>
they definitely called into question the judgment of people who give their <br/>
children formula.  The fact is, it was physically impossible for me to nurse <br/>
this baby.  If I followed the &quot;dumpster&quot; line of thinking and refused to use <br/>
formula, then my baby would have starved.  Am I making a ridiculous argument <br/>
here?  Yes, of course!  I wouldn&#39;t let my baby starve!  But it seems to me to <br/>
be ridiculously obvious that if you can&#39;t nurse, then you use formula, and <br/>
there&#39;s absolutely no sense in dwelling on its &quot;dumpster&quot;-like qualities.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t do anyone any good to hear about them, and it could easily be seen <br/>
(NOT just by me, but by numerous folks on the list who have emailed me) as <br/>
inflammatory, smug, and self-satisfied. <br/>
<br/>
I am not responding to your post in order to further this - I just wanted to <br/>
make sure that argumentative statements attributed to sulan were correctly <br/>
attributed to me.  Fair is fair, and I&#39;ll take the rap for my own words!  <br/>
Thanks for your thoughts on all this.  I love your posts, and look forward to <br/>
more.<br/>

&lt;&lt; hi kim,<br/>
 <br/>
 because there was no name at the bottom the only reference i could find was<br/>
 sulan...  at the top of the quoted stuff on lynda&#39;s post and i assumed that <br/>
was<br/>
 the person her comments were addressed to.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Susan, <br/>
I&#39;ve answered your post off-list to avoid dragging this tired topic out any <br/>
further.  <br/>
