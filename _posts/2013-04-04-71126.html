-----------<br/>
That&#39;s the surprising result of a new study that compared the food preferences and weight of babies who fed themselves finger food with those who were spoon-fed.<br/>
<br/>
Both groups of children had equal exposure to snack foods. But the babies who fed themselves preferred carbohydrates like toast, pasta or potatoes, while the spoon-fed children went for sweets when given a choice.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d think the children who controlled their own eating would be heavier, but not so. The spoon-fed crew was the one that was more likely to be obese as toddlers. Eight of the 63 spoon-fed children became obese, while none of the 63 self-feeding children were.<br/>

<br/>
Very nice. <br/>

<br/>
Maybe giving baby spoons as shower gifts is as bad as giving bottles.  Think of all the babies who open their mouths for foods they haven&#39;t yet smelled or looked at.  That&#39;s no way to learn about food!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was fed with a spoon some, but by the time Marty and Holly were around it was mash-with-fingers time, with real food, not baby food.  With Kirby we had a grinder, and dehydrated fruit flakes to add to malt-o-meal and cream of rice and such.   Too much work, and I learned better later.<br/>

Sofia (now 2,5) is self-weaned, she never had a pureed food in her life and<br/>
was never spoon-fed. Her first food was few florets of cooked broccoli.<br/>
Currently she has strong preference for fish, especially herring (Dutch<br/>
fermented one), meat, milk, cheese, soy sauce and berries. Bread, pasta and<br/>
potatoes are the least popular :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257436125">Excuse my English, I am not a native speaker. I just realized that<br/>
&quot;self-weaned&quot; has a very different meaning in American and British English<br/>
versions. I meant it as &quot;self-feeding solids&quot;� she is still breastfeeding :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524792282">I spoon-fed my 7 years old playfully on holiday at my parents in France <br/>
last month, and noticed out loud, smiling,  that I never ever did it <br/>
when he was smaller.<br/>
My dad answered that perhaps somthing important was missing in his <br/>
education !<br/>
My son winned himself, he helped himself from my plate at dinner time, <br/>
and tested lots of different things... never liked the puree style - <br/>
still doesn&#39;t (doesn&#39;t like mashed potaoes or apple compote)<br/>
But in France the child is winned by spoon... and you can never play <br/>
with your food !<br/>
