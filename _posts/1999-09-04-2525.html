<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011154600"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So you are saying that ages 13-14 is where math should begin?  Thus<br/>
&gt;entering into the algebras, trigs, geometry, etc.?  Then where is the<br/>
&gt;child&#39;s base?  Math like any other subject must have a foundation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had to respond to this very interesting discussion. I tend to wonder<br/>
about foundation information too, Laraine. I strive to be more<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; in my approach...and that is why I am on this list , but I<br/>
still struggle with leaving the math-learning to its own devices.<br/>
I have two friends who are unschoolers through and through. Their children<br/>
now are in high school or have gone to college. Both friends tell me that<br/>
they did not teach math from a text or from a workbook and they both regret<br/>
not keeping up with &#39;building blocks&#39; of learning math. Their children<br/>
struggled with math  when they went mainstream. The struggle was painful<br/>
and it took a long time to catch up. In other subjects they were on top of<br/>
the class but in math they were frustrated. They have advised me to<br/>
unschool in all subjects except in math.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?? <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you think?? <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Claiming ignorance from the get go, I still believe that the base must be<br/>
in place to build anything.  Haven&#39;t seen any buildings recently without<br/>
foundations have you?  Your report of the two hs unschooled kids who had<br/>
trouble in math only strengthens my concern on the issue.  I have one child<br/>
that wants to be a marine biologist/photographer type person - math seems<br/>
like a really big need to me - of course we all know that since she is only<br/>
10 that is probably going to change a dozen times, although she has been<br/>
saying this since she was 7 already.  Back to the issue - all things need a<br/>
foundation if you plan to build on them.<br/>
<br/>
History is about the only subject that I don&#39;t see this in - you can pick<br/>
any time frame and learn fine about it without a lot of build up - usually<br/>
- not totally.  Science is somewhat the same way although you must know the<br/>
basic outlines of the ocean before you will understand why photo plankton<br/>
live where they do and why Orcas live where they do.  English can be<br/>
approached kind of hodge podge after a basic understanding of sentences vs<br/>
questions and nouns vs verbs.<br/>
<br/>
So all things have foundations but some are easier to work with than others<br/>
without stressing the foundation.  Sorry to all you guys out there trying<br/>
to show me better - this is why I have trouble letting go with unschooling<br/>
- keep seeing the foundations.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling at our house happens on days when I simply cannot sit with the<br/>
children for one reason or another.  Then they do what they want (other<br/>
than watch TV).  It&#39;s beginning to sound like I don&#39;t unschool at all<br/>
doesn&#39;t it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This question comes up whenever my son wants to do something with math. The<br/>
other day he picked a game from Number Jugglers, a book of math-related card<br/>
games. He always picks the hardest game involving complicated equations, even<br/>
though he can only do simple ones (he&#39;s 6).  Then he gets frustrated and I get<br/>
frustrated trying to explain harder math concepts when we haven&#39;t done the<br/>
easier concepts yet. But he always picks the hardest things first and says he<br/>
can do them. Is he setting himself up for frustration ahead of time?<br/>
<br/>
This debate between linear vs. circular learning comes up all the time.<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s not difficult to backtrack to get &quot;foundation&#39;&#39; information. But<br/>
math, perhaps because of the way I was taught, seems to be harder (at least for<br/>
me) when it&#39;s not linear. (But math has always been hard for me because of the<br/>
way it was presented in school.) <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hard for me, because of the way I was taught in public school and<br/>
at home, to watch my son learn in a non-linear way because it seems so<br/>
haphazard...that he&#39;s not going to learn everything about a subject (but does<br/>
he need to?). That&#39;s more my problem than his. Of course, I suppose it&#39;s hard<br/>
to know what a person is learning because you can&#39;t actually see knowledge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459112317">Sure, everything has foundations when you look at the finished product. When<br/>
you are starting out, the problem is to look at what the proper foundation<br/>
is and when you need it.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids decide they want to build their own house in your backyard. You<br/>
get them books on basic carpentry and housebuilding. When they are ready to<br/>
start, you insist that they must first dig a trench and pour concrete for<br/>
the footing. That&#39;s how your house was built and your parents&#39;, and all of<br/>
your neighbors&#39; houses, and that&#39;s what the books recommend. &quot;But mom,&quot; your<br/>
kids complain, &quot;that doesn&#39;t make sense for a treehouse!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you need the same foundation for &quot;straw bale&quot; construction, a houseboat,<br/>
an RV? They are all houses.<br/>
<br/>
And when do you build that foundation? True, most conventional houses you<br/>
see are resting on firm foundations, but do you see builders going out and<br/>
putting in foundations all over the place because one day someone might want<br/>
to build a house on that site? No, usually the foundation isn&#39;t put in until<br/>
someone has made a firm commitment to put up their house. It can be a waste<br/>
of resources to build lots of foundations that may never be completed.<br/>
<br/>
You say math is different? There is only one kind of math, one right answer,<br/>
and one right way to get it? Not true. A lot of people are surprised that<br/>
the very first book in the Miquon math series introduces multiplying<br/>
fractions. Most traditional math programs don&#39;t even get into multiplying<br/>
for beginning math, much less multiplying fractions. Traditional math says<br/>
you can&#39;t work with fractions or multiplication until you build the<br/>
foundation first, but Miquon presents the concepts in such an easy to<br/>
understand way that it becomes part of the foundation.<br/>
<br/>
How do you get the answer to 3x9? Do you automatically spit out 27 because<br/>
you memorized the multiplication tables? How many people (like me) think of<br/>
the problem as 3x10 then deduct 3 (making the problem 3x10-3x1 because 9 is<br/>
1 less than 10). It seems less efficient, but it works better for some<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
There are different strategies for doing math and children can be encouraged<br/>
to develop those skills as they need them. Doing woodworking, sewing or<br/>
having an allowance can present ample opportunities and motivation for<br/>
learning math.<br/>

unschooling friends whose boys ended up going to high school  She never <br/>
insisted that her boys &quot;do Math&quot; although she did have a lot of Math games <br/>
she played with them, both computer and otherwise.  Her boys have completely <br/>
excelled in Math in high school, without having used any &quot;foundational&quot; <br/>
material except what I&#39;ve mentioned.  In other subjects, they haven&#39;t done as <br/>
well.  This, my friend feels, is because they are bored by the way these <br/>
subjects are taught.  <br/>
There are a lot of different opinions out there.  That&#39;s probably what makes <br/>
it so confusing for the rest of us...and what makes it more important for us <br/>
to rely on our own judgment and our children&#39;s needs than listening to <br/>
anybody else.<br/>

at a fabric store. By measuring and cutting fabric and trim I could<br/>
visually see what fractions looked like and could more easily manipulate<br/>
them in my head. The same with buying our house: I never had a better grasp<br/>
on geometry than when I had to figure out lot sizes and areas, and cost per<br/>
square foot. It was much more understandable when it dealt with practical<br/>
situations.<br/>

I feel the same way, I have the same problem letting go of math.  I can let <br/>
go all but reading writing and math.  The basics have to be laid down in some <br/>
way.  I am looking for the fun way for the boys, but, bottom line, I can un <br/>
