<div id="ygrps-yiv-767008038">I&#39;m way behind and have been trying not to reply to this thread, since <br/>
it&#39;s probably died off by now, but mention of Sleepy Dog got me. This <br/>
has got to be the dumbest book I&#39;ve ever seen--and my kids LOVE it! I <br/>
would have gotten rid of it right away if it&#39;d been up to me, but no! <br/>
They have to have it!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if a lot of the difference of whether kids like these really <br/>
dumb &quot;Bob&quot; type VERY easy readers has to do with how old the kids are <br/>
when they&#39;re learning to read. I&#39;m almost embarrassed on these boards to <br/>
say my kids are learning to read young, but they are, and they love <br/>
these very easy books. (Not the Bob ones, though. I found one in the <br/>
library about trains and it was the only train book Brian has ever not <br/>
loved.) My kids are not at all put off by the lack of sophistication in <br/>
these books. They liked Sleepy Dog and his ilk even before they started <br/>
learning to decode the words.<br/>

&gt;Reading his gameboy was my son&#39;s definition of when he could read.  Not when<br/>
&gt;he read Sleepy Dog, a very stupid (but much beloved) beginning reader that<br/>
&gt;my Mom sent which was his first book, or any of those easy books. <br/>
