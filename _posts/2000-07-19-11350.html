&lt;&lt; I have a question--I am highly allergic to flea bites. We were at the <br/>
Fairgrounds for 4H. and I was sitting on the ground w/my dd&#39;s club. I never <br/>
thought of fleas!!!  I got many many bites all over my legs and thighs. they <br/>
get red, hot  & painfully itchy.  does anyone know of any herbal o <br/>
homeopathic remedies for this?  I kept me up last night(along with the person <br/>
who called about homeschooling at 12:30am!!!!! but that&#39;s another story!)<br/>
  thanks<br/>
   Debra &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
you can stop the itch with egg white or ammonia... i don&#39;t know how to avoid <br/>
getting flea bites  though... maybe skin so soft?</div>

witch hazel (hamelaise &lt;sp?&gt;) in it. Witch Hazel may work just as well<br/>
and keep it in the refrigerator because it feels much more soothing and<br/>
nicer going on cold.<br/>

water. Also, something else that I stumbled upon is<br/>
tobacco tea. I broke open a cigaret and put the<br/>
tobacco in some water and heated it, the same way you<br/>
would make tea, and dipped a cloth in the tea and<br/>
dabbed it on the affected area. I did this for a bee<br/>
sting I had on he end of my second toe and the pain<br/>
and itching went away and never came back. I also did<br/>
this for my kids when they would get ant bites. One<br/>
time we at my neighbors and the kids were all rolling<br/>
in the grass. One of mine rolled into an ant bed and<br/>
was covered with ants. They were in her hair, shirt,<br/>
pants everywhere. She was screaming. After we got the<br/>
ants off her I made the tobacco tea and put it on her<br/>
and they didn&#39;t bother her much after that. Also, I<br/>
would recamend Avino oatmeal bath. Just be careful<br/>
because the tub gets VERY slick.  Corallyn<br/>

<br/>
yea, that&#39;s the tanic acid i think... there&#39;s a product called ivy dry that <br/>
has the concentrated tanic acid and alcohol in it that is great for poison <br/>
ivy... i use burrows solution on poison ivy ... and oatmeal baths... also the <br/>
best thing i&#39;ve used is that poison preventative called technu... if you know <br/>
you&#39;ve touched it, you can scrub your skin with it and it dissolves the <br/>
oils... if i don&#39;t have technu, i use dishsoap or turpentine... but i don&#39;t <br/>
know how any of this works for flea bites...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218616346">I&#39;ll remember this, if I&#39;m drinking red wine and get stung... if it&#39;s <br/>
the tannin, then it should have the same effect, though perhaps <br/>
RW vinegar would work better...<br/>
