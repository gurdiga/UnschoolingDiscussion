<br/>
&gt; Many of you wrote to me requesting a list of PAC donations made by <br/>
&gt; Monsanto. <br/>
&gt; An interesting event has occurred. Nearly one-billion dollars were <br/>
&gt; spent on <br/>
&gt; the elections, and Monsanto is aware that they are under the <br/>
&gt; microscope. Do <br/>
&gt; they stop giving, or do they give in different forms that are not <br/>
&gt; easily <br/>
&gt; observed? During the 2000 election cycle, Monsanto gave a total of <br/>
&gt; only <br/>
&gt; $63,350 to Congress...on the record. Nobody will ever know what <br/>
&gt; amounts were <br/>
&gt; invested in the form of soft money, cash money, party favors, and <br/>
&gt; gifts. The <br/>
&gt; $63,350 paid to 435 members of Congress and 100 members of the Senate <br/>
&gt; averages out to $118 per member. Sure. I believe that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The man receiving the second highest total dollars from Monsanto was <br/>
&gt; Larry <br/>
&gt; Combest (R-TX). He got $2000. Combest is the powerful chairman of the <br/>
&gt; House <br/>
&gt; Agriculture Committee. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Who got the most from Monsanto? The winner of the Monsanto <br/>
&gt; sweepstakes with <br/>
&gt; $10,000 was John Ashcroft, (R-MO). Ever hear of the man? You will in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; coming weeks during the Senate&#39;s confirmation hearings. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now...for those of you who are not regular readers of the notmilk <br/>
&gt; column, <br/>
&gt; let&#39;s review the Bush/Monsanto connection. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Monsanto&#39;s lawyer was appointed to the Supreme Court by George Bush, <br/>
&gt; Sr. The <br/>
&gt; deciding swing voter gave the election to George, Jr. That justice: <br/>
&gt; Clarence <br/>
&gt; Thomas, Esq. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SECOND <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, was president of Searle <br/>
&gt; Pharmaceuticals, purchased by Monsanto. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THIRD <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ann Veneman, Secretary of Agriculture, was on the board of directors <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; Calgene Pharmaceuticals, purchased by Monsanto. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FOURTH <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tommy Thompson, Secretary of Health, was a supporter of Monsanto in <br/>
&gt; Wisconsin. He received $50,000 from biotech firms is his election <br/>
&gt; run, and <br/>
&gt; used state funds to set up a a $317 million biotech zone in <br/>
&gt; Wisconsin. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FIFTH <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mitch Daniels, Director of the Office of Management and Budget. <br/>
&gt; Daniels was <br/>
&gt; the vice president of corporate strategy at Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical <br/>
&gt; Company. <br/>
&gt; Eli Lilly and Monsanto developed the genetically engineered bovine <br/>
&gt; growth <br/>
&gt; hormone. Lilly &quot;owns&quot; the European &quot;franchise.&quot; Daniels&#39; presence <br/>
&gt; insures <br/>
&gt; that the bovine growth hormone will one day be approved for use in <br/>
&gt; Europe. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SIXTH <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The House of Representatives Committee Agriculture Chairman, Larry <br/>
&gt; Combest <br/>
&gt; (R-TX), has named Richard Pombo to head Agriculture&#39;s dairy, <br/>
&gt; livestock, and <br/>
&gt; poultry sub-committee. Pombo will have enormous power in chairing <br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; committee. I remember Pombo as being a long-time member of Dairy, <br/>
&gt; Livestock, <br/>
&gt; and Poultry. In 1994, the approval process for Monsanto&#39;s genetically <br/>
&gt; engineered bovine growth hormone became the greatest controversy in <br/>
&gt; FDA <br/>
&gt; history. At that time, the Dairy Committee considered a bill that <br/>
&gt; would label <br/>
&gt; milk and milk products containing the genetically engineered hormone. <br/>
&gt; After <br/>
&gt; all, Americans had a right to know what they are eating...right? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Dairy Committee stalled the proposed bill until the 1994 <br/>
&gt; elections. When <br/>
&gt; the 1994 session of Congress expired, the bill died. It was never <br/>
&gt; even voted <br/>
&gt; upon. I began to investigate milk, milk hormones, and milk politics <br/>
&gt; at about <br/>
&gt; that time. I researched PAC donations, and learned that Pombo had <br/>
&gt; accepted a <br/>
&gt; total of $252,600 in PAC money that year. Remarkably, $84,385 waw <br/>
&gt; given to <br/>
&gt; him from private companies and groups doing business in Agriculture. <br/>
&gt; Talk <br/>
&gt; about buying votes! Even more remarkable was Pombo&#39;s relationship <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; Monsanto. I learned that this man had the audacity to accept money <br/>
&gt; directly <br/>
&gt; from Monsanto while voting on a bill that impacted Monsanto&#39;s future, <br/>
&gt; and the <br/>
&gt; future of biotechnology. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve called that PAC donation a bribe, and I continue to do so. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BRIBERY <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bribery is defined as the act or practice of giving or accepting <br/>
&gt; money or <br/>
&gt; some other payment with the object of influencing the action or <br/>
&gt; judgment at a <br/>
&gt; parliamentary hearing or other election. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; During the 2000 election cycle, Pombo accepted over $450,000. The <br/>
&gt; dairy <br/>
&gt; industry contributed $17,100, and groups with agriculture <br/>
&gt; interests &quot;donated&quot; <br/>
&gt; more than double the 1994 amounts. Now, Pombo runs the Dairy <br/>
&gt; Committee. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SEVENTH <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last, but not least. John Ashcroft, Attorney General. The one man out <br/>
&gt; of 535 <br/>
&gt; members of the House of Representatives and the Senate receiving the <br/>
&gt; greatest <br/>
&gt; amount of financial support from Monsanto. He received five times the <br/>
&gt; amount <br/>
&gt; of money as the congressman finishing second. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where do Americans finish in this stranger than fiction real-life <br/>
&gt; drama? <br/>
&gt; Last. <br/>
