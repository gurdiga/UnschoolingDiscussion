<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800215616">Alright, please don&#39;t anyone take offense here, but this is really starting to bug me. First off, my son, when asked why he&#39;s called lazybones, has in the past answered, because most times I like to stay put a lot more than getting up and doing a bunch of stuff. He has a very good grasp on the meaning we give, and the dictionary gives, &quot;lazy&quot;, and it is not negative in any way, shape, or form.  <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, these nicknames ARE positive to us, or we wouldn&#39;t be using them. (yes, we all have more than one, and lord knows I&#39;ll never mention them on here) By us I do mean all of us, not just me or whoever is using the nickname. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m saying that it doesn&#39;t hurt because I am the one here listening to my children&#39;s thoughts and wishes and following them. No one else is here and cannot make judgement calls about our family life. <br/>
<br/>
If you (general you) have life experiences that have caused you to believe that some words are negative no matter what, and that you disliked or were hurt by being called a nickname, then I&#39;m sorry. I promise I will never call you by a nickname. But those are your thoughts and feelings, not mine or my children&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not upset at the fact it was brought up that some things CAN be hurtful, but I am very upset at all of the insinuations that I do not know my own children, that they would not speak up and tell me things, that I do not take care of them right, and most of all, that you (again, general) know better than I how my own children think and feel. I devoutly pray I will never come down so judgementally on someone I&#39;ve never even met, and presume to know what goes on in their children&#39;s heads and hearts. No matter what kind of experiences or degrees or research one has done, they cannot know a child better than the mother does. <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll shut up now before I say something I really shouldn&#39;t and lose any friends I have here. (See, Sandra, I will come out and say something if it is what I really mean.)<br/>
<br/>
Myranda &lt;-- who has no hard feelings, and hope she has caused none<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Scene: two little boys sitting on front porch,<br/>
chatting and lounging. The day is hot.<br/>
Mom enters from the house.<br/>
Mom: Hey Guys.  (to son with affection)How&#39;s my little<br/>
Lazybones liking this heat?<br/>
Son: It&#39;s hot.<br/>
Mom - exits to garden.<br/>
Other Boy: Why does your Mom always call you<br/>
Lazybones. Are you Lazy?<br/>
Son: I don&#39;t know. I guess I am Lazy.<br/>
<br/>
This is how you want your son to think of himself?<br/>
Why is it hard to understand that calling someone a<br/>
negative thing results in them thinking negatively<br/>
about themselves? That&#39;s not something we made up,<br/>
it&#39;s been consistently found to be true.<br/>
We&#39;re not saying don&#39;t call him anything endearing or<br/>
affectionate, but why not something that is positive<br/>
(my little Go-getter)or even nuetral (my little<br/>
snickerdoodle)?<br/>
You&#39;re saying it doesn&#39;t hurt. We are all telling you<br/>
that it does. Why wait to find out when it&#39;s too late?<br/>

&gt;   Myranda,<br/>
&gt;   I think what many are trying to point out to you<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt;   that you ARE labeling, (ds1 is the lazy one, ds2<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt;   the curious one, etc) and that maybe your words<br/>
&gt; may be<br/>
&gt;   damaging in a way you have not realized. Think<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt;   what we are saying. We may be picking up on<br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt;   you are not aware of, showing you some of  the<br/>
&gt; words<br/>
&gt;   and phrases you&#39;ve been using and implications of<br/>
&gt;   those words.<br/>

I&#39;m not telling my opinion that it will not/does not hurt my children, it is fact. They want the nickname, they asked to be called the nickname, they are happy if we use the nickname, they get upset if no one uses the nickname. They say when they do not want to be called the nickname any longer. Can&#39;t get any clearer than that. <br/>
