Same thing, deeper.<br/>
You would like for people to treat you the way you would like to be treated.<br/>

Occasionally I meet a mother with a young child who instructs her child to <br/>
call me &quot;Mrs. Andrea.&quot; I am not Mrs. Andrea to anyone (except for <br/>
telemarketers and call centres :-) but the mother is adamant that I must be <br/>
called Mrs. Andrea, to show &quot;respect&quot; I guess. Respect to whom? I don&#39;t <br/>
think it is respectful to address someone by a name they don&#39;t want.<br/>

person is acquainted best with her own desires. I think most people <br/>
would desire to be treated compassionately and with courtesy. <br/>
Thinking &quot;How does that person want me to treat him in this <br/>
situation?&quot; is more difficult than thinking &quot;How would I like to be <br/>
treated in this situation?&quot; We&#39;re each inside our own heads, not the <br/>
heads of other people.<br/>
