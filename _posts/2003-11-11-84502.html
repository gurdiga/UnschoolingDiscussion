<div id="ygrps-yiv-147886576">Diana, isn&#39;t that something? i viewed it from a link on simple living <br/>
discussion board I visit.<br/>
<br/>
It woke me up to the way pork is &quot;produced&quot; in this country...and I&#39;m <br/>
not buying pork ever any more. It&#39;s virtually the same as veal, which <br/>
I&#39;ve never knowingly touched, due to the cruelty of producing it. I <br/>
mean, the sows are treated the same as veal, and who the HECK knows <br/>
why? <br/>
<br/>
ugh<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>
