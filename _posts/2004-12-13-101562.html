<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583374630">MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS!<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s official. The Live and Learn Unschooling Conference location for 2005  <br/>
has been changed to St. Louis, Missouri.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s very centrally located, and St. Louis is a gorgeous city with lots to  <br/>
do and see. I hope many of you will make a vacation out of this and spend some  <br/>
extra time in the Midwest. <br/>
 <br/>
St. Louis is five hours from Chicago, Kansas City, Nashville, and  <br/>
Memphis----LOTS to see! St. Louis itself is home to the Cardinals, Budweiser  Brewery, <br/>
The Bowling Hall of Fame, Grant&#39;s Farm, a lovely free zoo, a  children&#39;s <br/>
museum, a great science museum, Laclede&#39;s Landing, Riverboat  gambling, and of <br/>
course, the beautiful Arch (with its Lewis & Clark Museum  underneath). It&#39;s a <br/>
short drive to Hannibal, MO, childhood home of Mark Twain,  and Cahokia Mounds, a <br/>
Mississippian settlement that disappeared (and totally  peaceful---I love to <br/>
walk around and drink up the quiet energy).<br/>
 <br/>
The conference will be October 6th-9th. I was petitioned by a large group  of <br/>
attendees to extend the conference to five days, but we compromised with  <br/>
four---so we&#39;ll be starting on Thursday this year. We have some exciting  new <br/>
speakers as well as our popular standards, Sandra and Anne. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The website should be up before the end of the year. I&#39;ll point you in that  <br/>
direction as soon as it&#39;s up and operational.<br/>
 <br/>
The hotel contract should be signed by the end of this week: I&#39;ll get that  <br/>
out to you the day it happens, so that you can make your reservations as soon <br/>
as  possible. If I were to give it out now, y&#39;all would bombard them, and they <br/>
might  not have us in the system yet---so please be patient! &lt;g&gt; But we got  a <br/>
super room rate with several huge ballrooms, a great lay-out, and an  indoor <br/>
pool! There&#39;s an hotel restaurant and several within walking distance or  a <br/>
VERY short drive.<br/>
 <br/>
I have lots of great volunteers already, but if you have a talent you&#39;d  like <br/>
to share, please let me know.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to hosting the conference again---and VERY much looking  <br/>
forward to seeing you all in October!<br/>
