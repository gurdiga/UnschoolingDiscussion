&lt;&lt; I just don&#39;t want to pass those hang ups on to my son.  Hmm.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going with this, I guess that I just don&#39;t want to <br/>
shield him unnecessarily or, on the other hand, be neglectful.  I&#39;m hoping <br/>
for a healthy balance.  Is that possible??? LOL!  Thanks for all the <br/>
feedback!  I&#39;m open to any ideas. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids seem healthily balanced.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has some swimsuit-model thing on his computer as a desktop currently.   <br/>
He&#39;s never kept the same desktop very long, so I expect it to change in a <br/>
bit.  If I say something, it will make it more charged and important than if <br/>
I don&#39;t.  And there&#39;s nothing to say that&#39;s not kind of stupid or irritating <br/>
anyway.  It&#39;s not hurting anybody.     And he&#39;s not being sneaky, that&#39;s for <br/>
sure.  <br/>
<br/>
He has a girlfriend.  He&#39;s had other girlfriends.  This one is the plainest <br/>
looking, and one of his friends said &quot;I expected her to be prettier.&quot;  Kirby <br/>
rared back his head and gave the guy a look like it was tacky for him to <br/>
judge people by looks.   But this morning he was talking to me about what to <br/>
get her for her birthday.   Ideas were being rejected because he just doesn&#39;t <br/>
know enough about her, whether she has a CD player, says they have no DVD, <br/>
her dad rarely lets them get to the VCR because he watches racing al the <br/>
time.  I asked if she sewed.  &quot;Unfortunately, no.  She doesn&#39;t have many <br/>
interests.  That&#39;s a problem.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
He said it in such a way that the problem was way bigger than what to get her <br/>
for a birthday.  She&#39;s not interesting enough for him, not creative enough.   <br/>
He didn&#39;t care about looks.<br/>
<br/>
If he were an unbalanced kid, I think he would be totally going for physical <br/>
relationship if he could get it, but he&#39;s not (and he could) and he ends up <br/>
hanging out with her also teenaged brother as much as he does with her.   <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s treating her like a human, and thinking of her as a human.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
pick her for looks, but he probably won&#39;t marry her (figuratively and <br/>
literally speaking--it probably won&#39;t last a long time) because she&#39;s not as <br/>
interesting as some of his other friends.   (There has also been a twinge of <br/>
dishonesty, and that won&#39;t go far with him.)<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
Kids allowed to do and see whatever, treating young women NOT like sexual <br/>
objects.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the data from here.<br/>

<br/>
I have an 18 year old son, I know he&#39;s been in at least two sexual <br/>
relationships BEFORE he was 18, both were as long term as you get as a <br/>
teenager I guess (like a school year and a half?).<br/>
<br/>
If you allow them to know it&#39;s healthy and even if you tell them &quot;in a <br/>
committed relationship&quot; sometimes your idea of a committed relationship is <br/>
FAR different from what a teenagers point of view is.<br/>
<br/>
When they were VERY young and I was a &quot;mother looking out for her child&#39;s <br/>
best interest&quot; and screening everything I, well, screened everything.  No <br/>
Beavis and Butthead, I had a hard time with Bart Simpson (5-6 yr old boys) <br/>
even.  But before puberty was here, I had really relaxed and I wondered maybe <br/>
if it was TOO relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
But teenagers have sex, so the only battle to be won was to make sure they <br/>
were informed, respectful and above all as SAFE as possible.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how it worked here anyway.  Cait is not interested in dating or semi <br/>
dating even yet, so I guess I don&#39;t have to have those stressful thoughts, <br/>
not for today anyway, who knows what tomorrow will bring.<br/>

My kids have never been restricted from those things or South Park or any <br/>
other humor.  And while I think Kirby has had sex (Marty and I were just <br/>
talking about that while I shaved Marty&#39;s head just now), he&#39;s not having sex <br/>
because of something he saw or didn&#39;t see.  And the more information he has <br/>
about it, the better, as far as I&#39;m concerned.  I gave him a birth-control <br/>
reminder review (condoms aren&#39;t 100%) and he listened politely without <br/>
confirming or denying.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with that at all.  Just trying to say <br/>
that when my kids where younger before I knew about the joys of <br/>
homeschooling, let alone unschooling, I was this wicked mother that denied <br/>
them all the privileges other children supposedly had.<br/>
<br/>
Then suddenly to have the entire world opened up to you around the age of 11, <br/>
12 or 13, I guess you would want to take EVERYTHING in.  <br/>
<br/>
John had sex for the first time when he was 17 was it because of being <br/>
&quot;shielded&quot; as a child?  Was it because suddenly he became responsible for <br/>
himself?  <br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s to know for sure but I was just trying to say that I think it&#39;s <br/>
probably a part of every teenagers (no, not really EVERY teenager, but a <br/>
large part of them) passage into adulthood and for me the expectations became <br/>
for them not to remain virgins until married but the things that concerned me <br/>
most were saftey and respect of others.<br/>
<br/>
When my children were younger I would have said they BETTER NOT be having sex <br/>
in their teens.  But I grew and learned and things changed and I came to know <br/>
that I cannot control my children with my wishes, only allow them to become <br/>
the very best people they can be.<br/>
<br/>
AND I also kept reminding myself that I had sex for the first time when I was <br/>
17, just before I married their father...<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I was saying I don&#39;t know how much of a part it plays or whether <br/>
it is just the nature of humans that plays the biggest part of all.  I know I <br/>
trust my kids to know what is right for them.  I also trust them to be as <br/>
safe as possible and I know they are well aware of the consequences their <br/>
actions can bring if they are not careful.  I know they know how to respect <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s all a mother can really hope for, well of course i guess we <br/>
could hope they wait until the absolute love of their life shows up, but with <br/>
teenagers sometimes that happens two or three times before they find the REAL <br/>
absolute love of their life.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I suppose I&#39;ve only confused you even more with my rambling thoughts, <br/>
I think it&#39;s hard for me to say exactly what I want you to hear, but I hope <br/>
you get at least a part of what I&#39;m trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s all about the trust.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Was John ever homeschooled/unschooled? If so, how old was he when you<br/>
started? I think that has a lot to do with it. Peer pressure is incredibly<br/>
strong. And I must say in this day and age, I think it&#39;s even worse. Kids<br/>
are having sex now at 12 like no big deal. I think a lot of people would be<br/>
shocked to know actually how many (talking school kids here) that are doing<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Tara had no restrictions and I was very trusting of her, she had sex at a<br/>
young age but I really think it was her environment (school) that had a big<br/>
influence on her. She may have had sex earlier than some if she was<br/>
homeschooled, but I don&#39;t think it would have been as early as it was. Just<br/>
second guessing though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not confused in the least.  It IS about trust.  And I do trust <br/>
him.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s promiscuity I&#39;m so concerned about, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think so. The thing is that we really haven&#39;t shielded him from <br/>
sex ever, except on TV and in movies.  We have always been very open <br/>
with him about sex, drugs and everything else that he or we could <br/>
think of.  (That actually reminds me of something that happened <br/>
recently: about a year and a half ago, I took ds to a local museum <br/>
and on the way home we stopped at a shopping center to wait for dh to <br/>
pick us up...I don&#39;t drive...anyway, while there, the topic of <br/>
puberty was brought up by either ds or me and that led into a <br/>
discussion on wet-dreams and what to expect and when, etc...well, we <br/>
were there again recently, waiting on dh again, when my son looked <br/>
around, looked at me and said (none to quietly) &quot;oh yeah!  This is <br/>
where we talked about wet dreams, right?&quot;)  He is actually more <br/>
comfortable with sexuality than I am for him.  I just do not know why <br/>
the TV/movie thing unnerves me so much.  I really have to snap out of <br/>
it.  For goodness sakes, he IS 11.  When I was that age, I&#39;m sure I <br/>
was exposed to sex on TV.  Maybe not as intense as nowadays, but who <br/>
knows.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>John was was not homeschooled.  But you are very true in saying these kids <br/>
are having sex VERY young.  My daughter plays rec softball during middle <br/>
school years with say 15 or so girls.  During the year they were 11 one of <br/>
the girls was having sex, she liked to regal the others with the (what Cait <br/>
described) &quot;horrible&quot; details.<br/>
<br/>
Most of these girls thought it was horrible, they called this girl names, <br/>
they didn&#39;t socialize with her.  Near her 13th birthday the girl became <br/>
pregnant by the boy she was IN LOVE with.  The boy her mother let her have in <br/>
her room with the door shut and sleep together (but they were only SLEEPING). <br/>
 So her mother takes care of the situation and gets the girl a babysitter <br/>
after school.  She can&#39;t go anywhere, do anything, has to be monitored at all <br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
Mother calls me, asks me how come Cait is not like Tara? Apologizes that Tara <br/>
has exposed these kids to things their parents might not approve of.  <br/>
(annoucing her pregnancy to her friends they all had to find out why it never <br/>
progressed).<br/>
<br/>
I just took a deep breath and said, you know what?  I don&#39;t go out for drinks <br/>
after work and come home at nine or ten or later every night and fall into <br/>
bed.  I don&#39;t agree with Cait taking a boyfriend (she doesn&#39;t have one yet) <br/>
into her room to &quot;sleep&quot; at that age, especially with no one home.  I told <br/>
her this has been going on for a couple years, it&#39;s not something new to her <br/>
child.  She really wanted help, she wanted to know what she could do as a <br/>
mother to help her child see that she wasn&#39;t adult enough to go through all <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
How about not MAKING her the adult?  She comes home from seventh grade like <br/>
adults come home from work.  To an empty house.  She is repsonsible for her <br/>
own snacks and dinner.  She is repsonsible for doing any household work that <br/>
needs doing, she is repsonsible for her own bedtime her own everything.  <br/>
She&#39;s playing house all on her own.  Sometimes she will see you on Saturday <br/>
morning drag to her softball games, SOMETIMES.  Sometimes it&#39;s into the next <br/>
week before she see you at all.  She needs attention and she&#39;s going to find <br/>
it.  She needs love and nurturing and she will find it.<br/>
<br/>
That was to say that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all about peer pressure.  Some of it <br/>
is, but in this case peer pressure would have been against this behaviour.  I <br/>
think there are LOTS Of reasons kids have sex.<br/>
<br/>
These days I think 17 is pretty late from what I hear.  I guess just like <br/>
anything else in life there are so many reasons things happen it&#39;s hard to <br/>
make generalities.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a good question... what age do you think is an OK age to start having <br/>
sexual relationships?  Or is it when that person feels ready and can be <br/>
responsible?  Does a mother EVER think it&#39;s OK?<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Most of these girls thought it was horrible, they called this girl names,<br/>
they didn&#39;t socialize with her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well in that case good for them. From what I know and see here, 12 year olds<br/>
having sex is the norm. The ones who aren&#39;t having some kind of sexual<br/>
contact are the ones shunned and made fun of. It&#39;s pretty much a gimme that<br/>
by 13 or 14, if you haven&#39;t had sex with someone, you are weird. And let me<br/>
say that most kids start out with oral sex. See around here, oral sex ISN&#39;T<br/>
sex at all and the way to start out when experimenting. And this goes both<br/>
ways, for guys and girls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Here&#39;s a good question... what age do you think is an OK age to start<br/>
having<br/>
sexual relationships?  Or is it when that person feels ready and can be<br/>
responsible?  Does a mother EVER think it&#39;s OK?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it would be fair for me to put an age on it. It would depend<br/>
on the person and the circumstances. I love sex and it&#39;s a big part of my<br/>
marital relationship. It&#39;s always been a big part of my life. I haven&#39;t<br/>
always been careful about it and that has to do with me not getting any<br/>
information when I was young. I make sure not to do that with my own<br/>
children. But I think it&#39;s fun and not just for procreation. I have married<br/>
friends who complain about not enough, about too much. I have friends who go<br/>
weeks without sex. I know of some who actually go years. That would never<br/>
work for me.<br/>
<br/>
So with my attitude, how could I expect my children to not have sex until<br/>
they are legal adults or married. They might choose to do that, and that&#39;s<br/>
fine if it&#39;s their choice. If it&#39;s not, how can I complain about it?<br/>
<br/>
My oldest had sex earlier than I was comfortable with. Now she knows it was<br/>
way too soon for her also. Can&#39;t take it back and luckily there were<br/>
repercussions because of it. She&#39;s careful now about her decisions. I also<br/>
know her and her boyfriend now are having sex. And even though I had a<br/>
problem with how and when she started, I don&#39;t have any problems with her<br/>
now. She&#39;s responsible and she loves the kid. Not someone she will marry,<br/>
but I don&#39;t believe it has to wait for that anyway.<br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s not be telling a bunch of stories about kids in school.  We could all <br/>
do that but it&#39;s a waste of this list and our time.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Here&#39;s a good question... what age do you think is an OK age to start <br/>
having <br/>
sexual relationships?  Or is it when that person feels ready and can be <br/>
responsible?  Does a mother EVER think it&#39;s OK?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For some parents, never.<br/>
For few parents will they say &quot;Okay!  You&#39;re old enough, go for it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The best parents can do is have a good relationship with their children so <br/>
that the children are thoughtful, aware, mature and responsible.  They will <br/>
have sex without their mother&#39;s permission or approval at some point, and <br/>
it&#39;s none of her business in large part.   <br/>
<br/>
ANY sort of clinging and controlling will make it worse and more likely.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a homeschooling family I know where one of the daughters hated her <br/>
parents and her life so much she got married at fifteen to get out.  She <br/>
wasn&#39;t prepared to know anything about sex or having a family.  All she knew <br/>
was she wanted out of the one she was in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m aiming to give my kids a safe, comfortable place to be so they don&#39;t feel <br/>
like they need to cling to any person floating by to rescue them.   <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Marty was talking to a kid he&#39;s known for nine years, who started <br/>
homeschooling because of our family.  The kid&#39;s living far away now, and <br/>
calls occasionally.  Marty was summarizing the past year, and one of the <br/>
stories involved a mutual friend moving out of parents&#39; house into an <br/>
apartment, at 17.  &quot;He&#39;s an idiot,&quot; Marty said simply.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will cling desperately to others because their parents are unreasonable, <br/>
not because they saw waist-up acted-out sex on a movie.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
What are the odds the girl who had sex early had been abused, or mistreated <br/>
in some way so that early sex was better than what was going on around her?<br/>
<br/>
Is shunning and shaming her a virtue in others then?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; From what I know and see here, 12 year olds<br/>
<br/>
having sex is the norm. The ones who aren&#39;t having some kind of sexual<br/>
<br/>
contact are the ones shunned and made fun of. It&#39;s pretty much a gimme that<br/>
<br/>
by 13 or 14, if you haven&#39;t had sex with someone, you are weird. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AGAIN you aren&#39;t talking about unschoolers, so PLEASE make that clear.  1100 <br/>
people reading this, some new at any time, and you&#39;re making statements <br/>
without specifying you&#39;re talking about school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My oldest...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
who was going to school<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;... had sex earlier than I was comfortable with. Now she knows it was<br/>
<br/>
way too soon for her also. Can&#39;t take it back and luckily there were<br/>
<br/>
repercussions because of it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No it isn&#39;t a virtue, I meant it to sound just like you read it, as in &quot;poor <br/>
girl&quot;.  I also don&#39;t expect that 11 and 12 year old girls to sit and hear <br/>
about sexual escapades every chance this child had to share them so grandly <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
The child knew they didn&#39;t want to hear about it, she continued to flaunt it <br/>
in words as well as her looks and actions, so nothing left for them to do, <br/>
but ignore her.<br/>
<br/>
Her mother knew this was going on.  She called parents to see why here child <br/>
was so upset.  Parents told her because of her child&#39;s being so advanced in <br/>
some not so nice ways, it made their children uncomfortable to be around her.<br/>
<br/>
Her mother shrugged it off as jealousy, until the pregnancy anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But there really is little else that such young girls could/should do but <br/>
avoid a situation they are uncomfortable with, in my opinion anyway.  The did <br/>
talk to their mothers about it.  The only suggestions I made for my daughter <br/>
were to talk to her friend about her behaviours and the things she wanted to <br/>
share with others and let her know they were not comfortable.  The friend <br/>
didn&#39;t care, it was like a bragging thing to her, she shared explicit <br/>
details. So no one wanted to hang around her BUT the boys.<br/>
<br/>
What would you suggest that 11 and 12 year olds should do in a situation like <br/>
this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that is a given and the best answer is probably when the child is <br/>
ready and that doesn&#39;t really matter because it&#39;s going to happen when it <br/>
happens anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Like you said, they aren&#39;t likely to ask permsission (although some do bring <br/>
it up beforehand).<br/>
<br/>
Lots of things probably factor into a young person&#39;s decision and probably a <br/>
big part of it is how they were brought up and how the subject was dealt with <br/>
or not dealt with maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids probably do flock to others because their families are too <br/>
restrictive, some do it for other reasons.  I guess many times it&#39;s just <br/>
human nature that causes it, hormones, spring fever, being twitterpaited as <br/>
my children sometimes refer to it.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that the beauty of it all?  That we are so alike yet so very different? <br/>
 That we each find our own way in this world sometimes IN SPITE OF our <br/>
upbringings.  I hope my children find their way BECAUSE of the love and care <br/>
I&#39;ve tried to raise them with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058392773">I know some kids very close to me that have already had oral sex at the age of 10.  I was shocked when I heard about it.<br/>
<br/>
I immediately educated my kids on *all* of sex, which includes oral sex, etc.  We had talked about it all before, but this time I made sure they knew all the facts....like &quot;yes you CAN get pregnant before you have your first period&quot;.  Even my 14 year old didn&#39;t know that (which surprised me).<br/>
<br/>
We talked about birth control etc. I told my daughter that she should wait until marriage, but I&#39;m not naieve.  I told her that if she felt she could not wait until then, to come and tell me and I would take her for birth control.<br/>

<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Most of these girls thought it was horrible, they called this girl names,<br/>
  they didn&#39;t socialize with her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Well in that case good for them. From what I know and see here, 12 year olds<br/>
  having sex is the norm. The ones who aren&#39;t having some kind of sexual<br/>
  contact are the ones shunned and made fun of. It&#39;s pretty much a gimme that<br/>
  by 13 or 14, if you haven&#39;t had sex with someone, you are weird. And let me<br/>
  say that most kids start out with oral sex. See around here, oral sex ISN&#39;T<br/>
  sex at all and the way to start out when experimenting. And this goes both<br/>
  ways, for guys and girls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Here&#39;s a good question... what age do you think is an OK age to start<br/>
  having<br/>
  sexual relationships?  Or is it when that person feels ready and can be<br/>
  responsible?  Does a mother EVER think it&#39;s OK?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think it would be fair for me to put an age on it. It would depend<br/>
  on the person and the circumstances. I love sex and it&#39;s a big part of my<br/>
  marital relationship. It&#39;s always been a big part of my life. I haven&#39;t<br/>
  always been careful about it and that has to do with me not getting any<br/>
  information when I was young. I make sure not to do that with my own<br/>
  children. But I think it&#39;s fun and not just for procreation. I have married<br/>
  friends who complain about not enough, about too much. I have friends who go<br/>
  weeks without sex. I know of some who actually go years. That would never<br/>
  work for me.<br/>
<br/>
  So with my attitude, how could I expect my children to not have sex until<br/>
  they are legal adults or married. They might choose to do that, and that&#39;s<br/>
  fine if it&#39;s their choice. If it&#39;s not, how can I complain about it?<br/>
<br/>
  My oldest had sex earlier than I was comfortable with. Now she knows it was<br/>
  way too soon for her also. Can&#39;t take it back and luckily there were<br/>
  repercussions because of it. She&#39;s careful now about her decisions. I also<br/>
  know her and her boyfriend now are having sex. And even though I had a<br/>
  problem with how and when she started, I don&#39;t have any problems with her<br/>
  now. She&#39;s responsible and she loves the kid. Not someone she will marry,<br/>
  but I don&#39;t believe it has to wait for that anyway.<br/>
