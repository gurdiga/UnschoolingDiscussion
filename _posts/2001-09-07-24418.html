that I live a Christian life, meaning, I walk by faith in Jesus&#39; gift of<br/>
himself and by the power of God&#39;s Spirit in and through me to love and do<br/>
good.  I agree, we should be able to think about criticism without<br/>
feeling condemnation.  Iron sharpening iron and all that.<br/>

that Sandra, Joy and whoever else you are talking about shouldn&#39;t be giving <br/>
their opinions.  Of course all those &quot;good&quot; Christian women who do exactly <br/>
what their husbands&#39; &quot;tell them to do&quot; might want a polite list where there&#39;s <br/>
no fuel only a tea party.  Myself I love the writings of all those <br/>
opinionated women.  It makes me feel alive..... Shows me that being at home <br/>
with the kids all the time doesn&#39;t dull your brain or senses.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy your Christian T- List (yes I am slightly annoyed at your <br/>
Christian tone)<br/>

You may not like Christians, you may not like women who &quot;obey&quot; their husbands, you may not even like to drink tea........but I know one thing for certain, you DEFINITELY don&#39;t like...................... being polite!!!!!!!

Most likely because I never read the post about &quot;milking of goats&quot;.  Perhaps things hit us differently at different times and so one thing may hit a hot spot when at another time you may let it slide.  I guess my general problem is with people &quot;stereotyping&quot; and then secondly people poking fun at others expense to make themselves feel better.  I&#39;m sure plenty of people don&#39;t have a problem with either of these things........these just happen to be 2 of my buttons.<br/>

I, for one, am a pagan (sort of - I hate identifying with ANY group) who<br/>
completely respects your right to choose your own path.  If you are in a<br/>
Christian based marriage with a dominate male role and what is currently<br/>
viewed as a submissive female role, well, as long as you are there<br/>
voluntarily and happy, I say that&#39;s fine.  As long as you don&#39;t try to<br/>
insist I behave the same way, that is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dawn, (I think it was you)<br/>
<br/>
I understand where you are coming from too though.  I too have seen some<br/>
abusive relationships that were &#39;based&#39; on christianity.  But just<br/>
because they say they are christian does not mean that they really are. <br/>
They are just as misguided as the non-religios abusive spouses are.  Oh<br/>
yes, and the abuser is not necessarily the man.  I have a friend who has<br/>
been mentally abused by his wife for the past 23 years (in the name of<br/>
christianity too BTW).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458854471">Well, since you&#39;re still here :), why IS reading more important than tv?<br/>
How is assigning a certain amount of &quot;work&quot; in any way allowing a child to<br/>
direct their own education (aka unschooling)?  Wouldn&#39;t it be lying to<br/>
pretend something was broken if it wasn&#39;t?  I for one would be happy to<br/>
listen to what you have to say on these subjects.  I&#39;m a full-blown radical<br/>
unschooler, and I&#39;m sure I could still learn something from listening to<br/>
your point of view.  That&#39;s kind of the point, isn&#39;t it?  ~Rue<br/>

You must be kidding, Indiana Tami.  That is all that has been going on here<br/>
for the last week!  Go back and read again.  Everything from &quot;you are lying<br/>
to your kids by doing that&quot; to &quot;you aren&#39;t really unschooling if you do<br/>
that&quot; to &quot;if you require them to do anything, you aren&#39;t trusting them, and<br/>
trust is the most important thing&quot; to &quot;why is reading more important than<br/>
TV?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure Bridget can provide more examples - she&#39;s been put down as much as<br/>
I have.<br/>

Same here!  Everyone always uses the argument that kids are &quot;glued to the TV&quot; in a &quot;trance like state&quot; and that TOTALLY is not how we watch TV..........we talk, we discuss, and now that we have Tivo we stop the show to look stuff up and then start it up again when we are done.  To me TV isn&#39;t a solitary activity.......it is definitely family interaction at our house.<br/>

&gt; Interesting perspective. My older kids will often turn off the TV<br/>
&gt; (when we have one - we often turn off the satellite dish for months<br/>
&gt; at a time) and say they&#39;d rather just read quietly, that they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to have to put out the effort it takes to watch TV...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303841527">My sons and I were just discussing this point. One son commented he likes to<br/>
read the book first because how he envisions the story can often be very<br/>
different than the way a producer and director choose to portray it. Stories<br/>
have more depth to him that way.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Same here!  Everyone always uses the argument that kids are &quot;glued to the <br/>
TV&quot; in a &quot;trance like state&quot; and that TOTALLY is not how we watch <br/>
TV..........we talk, we discuss, and now that we have Tivo we stop the show <br/>
to look stuff up and then start it up again when we are done.  To me TV isn&#39;t <br/>
a solitary activity.......it is definitely family interaction at our house. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would have to say that it is the same here. No passive watching either. But <br/>
I do know a homeschool family that sometimes come out. The tv is usually <br/>
snapped on and those kids and their Mom do not utter another word but just <br/>
stare at the tv. If they have food they spill it. They just seem mesmerized. <br/>
I understand why her kids do not say anything, cause if they do their Mom <br/>
yells at them to shut up and stop being rude. Ok. :(   They usually sit and <br/>
watch a movie video we have, Mom included, while my kids go off and get <br/>
involved in something else. I have come to the conclusion that they just come <br/>
over to watch a video. <br/>
<br/>
This Mom also asked me recently what curriculum we are using. I explained <br/>
that we are unschoolers. She said, Oh that is neat. By the way what <br/>
curriculum are you going with?<br/>

LOL about the curriculum question........some people just don&#39;t get it!  I think you have to look at each child and family different when it comes to what they can handle and how they react to things....like TV.  As long as you are going with what you know your kids can do you can&#39;t go wrong.<br/>
