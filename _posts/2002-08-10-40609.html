<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140947646"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I spend a significant amount of time writing to a young man in prison for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>selling drugs.  His behavior led to the death of several people.  He<br/>
grew up<br/>
in foster care, was beaten, told he was stupid and would never amount to<br/>
anything.  Is he evil?  I can&#39;t judge him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I swear Jesus/Goddess/the Great I AM/Zeus must be wondering if we<br/>
will EVER<br/>
get it, EVER.  I know I do.<br/>

That is wisdom, Julie. Although I enjoyed Suzanna&#39;s post and wondered<br/>
which church said the rather different idea of hell she expressed, it<br/>
also occurred to me that worse than spending eternity in hell with evil<br/>
ones if you are evil, is spending eternity with evil people   when you<br/>
aren&#39;t.... Earth in other words. <br/>
Or spending eternity with evil people who are really good inside and<br/>
could possibly be really themselves, and we all have acted in an<br/>
aberrated way worse than we wished at times. <br/>
<br/>
Note: I say eternity and earth in the same sentence because I happen to<br/>
have the reality that there is not only one lifetime and we may have all<br/>
been doing this for a really, really long time.<br/>
<br/>
I just volunteered to write to inmates in a correspondence course for<br/>
prisoners.<br/>
