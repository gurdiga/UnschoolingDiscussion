<div id="ygrps-yiv-728293716">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let everyone know that my son started a yahoo group for<br/>
discussing movies, music, and tv shows. He loves talking about this, and is<br/>
hoping that others will join him in chatting. Here is the main page:<br/>

I see a potential problem with this.  It might work out fine, but why  <br/>
can&#39;t he go to the places where movies and music and TV shows are  <br/>
already being discussed and discuss it there?   IMDB has discussions/ <br/>
comment places, and the TV shows almost always have  discussion boards.<br/>
<br/>
On MySpace there are tons of musicians with sites and people leave  <br/>
comments.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of living surrounded by unschoolers, it seems to be more in  <br/>
keeping with learning from the world for people to live and learn in  <br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the advantage your son sees from having an unschoolers&#39;  <br/>
discussion?  (I have a few ideas, but not great ones--it might be a  <br/>
place to find other young kids who are watching R-rated movies.  You  <br/>
didn&#39;t say how old your son is, though.)<br/>

***************************<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been giving this some thought lately, about how some unschoolers just  <br/>
want to be with other unschoolers in *all* that they do.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s helpful to want to spend time with people having the same  <br/>
mindset and who are respectful to and who like their kids&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;, but  I am  <br/>
realizing  my kids need *more* of the whole world now, and  not just unschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m starting to think of us more as people living joyfully and just happen  <br/>
to be unschoolers. I seem to be less fixated on the label as time goes on.  <br/>
Perhaps that has to do with confidence.Does that make sense?<br/>
