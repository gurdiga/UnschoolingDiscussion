<div id="ygrps-yiv-767145681">&quot;Does anyone know of picture or story books about homeschooling or <br/>
unschooling families? I know my 3 children would enjoy reading about <br/>
children their own ages, who aren&#39;t at school, and I can&#39;t find any <br/>
titles anywhere. Even my librarians can&#39;t help, apart from <br/>
suggesting I write one myself!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any picture books...YET (I&#39;m working on that though), but a book we all enjoyed immensely, with an unschooler in it, is Skellig. It&#39;s written by David Almond, and is a beautiful shorter chapter book. Speaks to the heart, I love it.<br/>
Mina, the unschooler in it, is a total free spirit and is baffled by the fact that the main character has to go to school every day.<br/>
Very cool.<br/>

and her mother about schools.<br/>

been ages since I read it though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I finally found one.  Leo the Late Bloomer is about a little lion <br/>
whoses father is anxious for him to do what all the other little <br/>
animals are doing i.e. talking, reading, etc.  Leo&#39;s mom tells his <br/>
dad to just wait and he will bloom.  At one point she even tells him <br/>
as he spys on Leo that &quot;watched bloomers never bloom&quot;.  When Leo <br/>
starts talking he tals in sentences.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely Unschooling and definitely family.<br/>
