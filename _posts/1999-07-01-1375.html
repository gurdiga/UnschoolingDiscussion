<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844585813">My husband asked me to print out some things from websites to help him <br/>
learn better English (though, if you ask me, his English is REALLY <br/>
good), so I thought that I&#39;d sneak one or two homeschooling articles in <br/>
there.  He alternates between very anti-homeschooling (I haven&#39;t even <br/>
mentioned unschooling to him...) and just kinda figures he still has a <br/>
year and a half to convince me otherwise (the school year is different <br/>
here).  He asks me what about...  but when I answer him, he just says, <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re wrong&quot; and won&#39;t listen.  So, if I could sneak one - the very <br/>
best - the most convincing homeschooling article there is out there - <br/>
which one would it be?  Also, if somebody knows of one (or more) please <br/>
send me URL&#39;s on something educational I can print out for him as <br/>
well, that can prove that the internet is a good place to learn stuff - <br/>
and our kids won&#39;t be stuck with my limited knowledge alone.  Finding <br/>
out about unschooling is the best thing that could have happened to me.  <br/>
Even though ds is not yet school age, I have never enjoyed being a <br/>
mother more that I do now that I&#39;m not just waiting for him to go to <br/>
school and learn something.  DH says I&#39;m taking ds out of society by <br/>
not letting him go to school.  I could let ds go to school until he&#39;s <br/>
ready to get a real education, but I don&#39;t want to waste the time it <br/>
takes to detox.  And I know he&#39;s going to have a tough time because <br/>
he&#39;s different - he has a hard enough time without being in school.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m rambling.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Melanie in Japan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706664587">I am in my third year of unschooling my three dds, ages 10-1/2, <br/>
almost 8, and 6 y/o.  I joined the list a couple of years ago, but <br/>
switched to no-mail due to extreme stress.  My DH decided to divorce <br/>
me but did not want to leave me with the kids, especially since we <br/>
homeschool.  He became obsessed with removing the children from my <br/>
care (claiming mental illness) and placing the children in school.  <br/>
This is basically a jealously issue due to the time I have with the <br/>
children as a homeschooler and not working (I am disabled/military <br/>
retired, so will not be forced to work).  He attempted to enroll the <br/>
children in school and then split the nights and weekends between <br/>
us, to make things &quot;fair&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, DH (retired Marine) does not share my attitudes <br/>
about family, attachment parenting/tcs, unschooling, etc.  We had a <br/>
custody trial in February.  The judge made a temporary ruling for <br/>
only 6 months.  He is concerned about my ability to be a single <br/>
parent (I have fibromyalgia and CFIDS).  I have basically been a <br/>
single parent for 10-1/2 years anyway - it&#39;s actually EASIER now <br/>
that stress is lower from DH living elsewhere.  He also called DH an <br/>
autocrat - so he has concerns about that too.  Our case will be <br/>
reviewed at the end of six months, and a permanent decision will be <br/>
made at that time.<br/>
<br/>
On the witness stand, I never used the term &quot;unschooling&quot;.  I never <br/>
named a specific curriculum, but spoke of a humanities approach to <br/>
learning where we incorporate literature with art and history and <br/>
tie our field trips into the same study.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where I need help:  The judge ruled that I MUST submit in <br/>
writing the curriculum I will use annually.  I must also provide DH <br/>
regularly with samples of the children&#39;s schoolwork (to show <br/>
progress).  HELP!!!!!!!  I need help with wording - I do not want to <br/>
raise any red flags here.  Can anyone provide specific advice or <br/>
samples?  Do any of you have to submit something similar to your <br/>
state and county?  Would you be willing to provide samples for me?  <br/>
Do you have any books or web-sites that are particularly helpful <br/>
here? <br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooler from the inside out - I love it!.  My 10 y/o DD <br/>
is a Junior Girl Scout, but she hasn&#39;t worked on any badges <br/>
(intentionally).  Her friends have earned up to 50 badges.  So we <br/>
went through her book last night to see if there were any badges she <br/>
has earned just through some of her regular activities.  We were <br/>
stunned to see how much she has done on her own - not because a book <br/>
or a teacher told her to write a play and put it on or create a game <br/>
or maze for someone else, but because we live a learning lifestyle.  <br/>
What an encouragement!<br/>
<br/>
My weakness is organization, record keeping, and confidence in <br/>
myself to be able to pull this off.  I would be so grateful for any <br/>
assistance.  Thanks, mettenna</div>

There&#39;s an &quot;unschooling curriculum&quot; described by Carol Narigon on Sandra<br/>
Dodd&#39;s website.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers in New York, and I think Pennsylvania also submit progress<br/>
report type stuff to the school system, so if you google &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
with the name of either of those states you might find cool stuff.  The<br/>
&quot;meeting your state requirements&quot; folder on the unschooling.com website<br/>
might also help you find other people who are reporting to the state.<br/>

You could adapt Carol&#39;s.<br/>
Or you could sign up with Clonlara as correspondence students.  Costs money, <br/>
but takes the pressure off you.  Clonlara deals with ur pull it and edit it <br/>
the way you want it and print THAT).  Then when the kids do something <br/>
naturally that happens to be mentioned there you could <br/>
photograph/summarize/document that activity as &quot;progress.&quot;<br/>

That part isn&#39;t really that hard.  Like Sandra said take pictures when things <br/>
happen.  It isn&#39;t like because you are unschooling that learning doesn&#39;t <br/>
happen.  It just takes a little thinking to word it to fit &quot;school&quot; type <br/>
terms.  Cooking is math, manipulating fractions, adding, subtracting, <br/>
science/chemistry etc. You don&#39;t have to say we cooked today you just <br/>
translate that into something they want to hear.<br/>

Here&#39;s a link to the &quot;curriculum&quot; description that Carol Narigon <br/>
uses. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a>  This may be a <br/>
good place to start. Lots of people have used it to successfully <br/>
describe unschooling to a doubting authority.<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely! Casey is also a Jr. Girl Scout. She loves to earn badges, <br/>
but we always find that she&#39;s done at least half the requirements <br/>
before she even starts one. The &quot;Books&quot; and &quot;Write All About It&quot; <br/>
badges were completely done! Badge &quot;work&quot; would be a great thing to <br/>
show as demonstration of school type work. I&#39;d also keep copies of <br/>
any drawings, writings, museum stubs, photos of cool stuff you&#39;ve <br/>
done, etc. You can also keep the list from the library of books <br/>
you&#39;ve taken out.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My weakness is organization, record keeping, and confidence in <br/>
&gt;myself to be able to pull this off.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can do it! Just start keeping everything! Throw it all in a <br/>
folder marked for each month. When the time comes to show your <br/>
husband stuff, you can pull out what looks good. <br/>
<br/>
Remember, the learning *is* happening. The rest is just bookkeeping.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

There is a website about how to use girl scout activity to &quot;count&quot; as <br/>

that is WONDERFUL, that I no longer have all of that right at the tip of my <br/>
