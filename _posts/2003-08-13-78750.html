Over here in Brevard county I belong to a homeschool group that is made up mostly of unschoolers. So, we are &quot;remotely&quot; near you.<br/>

Where is Palm Bay in relationship to Cape Canaveral?  That&#39;s the only area I really know of Brevard.  My brother lives there.  Oh, yeah, and the zoo.......  <br/>
I am envious that you have a group of unschoolers.  I don&#39;t know any.<br/>
<br/>
Peace~<br/>
