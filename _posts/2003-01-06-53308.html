<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244850609">It&#39;s snowing!  It&#39;s snowing!  I can&#39;t believe it.  Germany used to get a lot<br/>
of snow, people tell me, but all we&#39;ve had has been rain, rain, rain.<br/>
<br/>
Tim is outside and LOVING it.  There&#39;s not another kid in sight.  I called<br/>
the other homeschoolers I know here, but they&#39;re busy doing school right now<br/>
and can&#39;t come out.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what they&#39;re learning that so much more important than snow?!?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829454076">Cool,  Brenda!      You would think those homeschoolers would be doing some weather study, huh?&lt;g&gt;      <br/>
 <br/>
I also wanted to mention,   my kids are having a ball with the coins you sent.  I don&#39;t know if people remember, but Brenda had offered to send Euros and other currency if anyone wanted.  We got some.<br/>
 <br/>
We ended up looking up conversions and all sorts of things, the kids really got a kick our of yen and that conversion. So much history in currency.   We would have done it longer, but then we had to go cross country skiing,   no ignoring snow here! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again Brenda,<br/>

missing from Massachusetts for coins/brochures/whatever from there?  You<br/>
can email me privately if you&#39;re interested.  Thanks ~Rue<br/>
