&gt; Today I have been cleaning for nearly the whole day. I&#39;ve been doing small<br/>
&gt; amounts each day  but I just had enough today and had to have a clean up. I<br/>
&gt; have felt guilty all day because I haven&#39;t spent much time with the kids but<br/>
&gt; I know if I had left the house I would have felt guilty all day for leaving<br/>
&gt; it in such a state, especially when Mark gets home to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard not to get caught up in cleaning all the time at the expense of<br/>
&gt; your kids once you get started. And it&#39;s hard to get motivated to kep your<br/>
&gt; house clean once you get involved with what you&#39;re kids are doing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone managed to strike a balance in this area? Or is it impossible?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s impossible to do everything perfectly all the time, yes. :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not impossible to say, &quot;The kids are more important than the mess in<br/>
the house&quot; most of the time, but when you get frantic for &quot;clear space&quot;<br/>
(living in a mess is painful to me) it&#39;s not a sign of Bad MotherHood and<br/>
Unschooling Failure to say to the kids, &quot;There&#39;s sandwich stuff in the<br/>
refrigerator, can you guys either find things to do or help me clean this<br/>
all up, because today is Cleaning Day until I can see what color carpet we<br/>
have again.&quot; (The &quot;or I&#39;m going to jump out the window&quot; should be left<br/>
unsaid. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
