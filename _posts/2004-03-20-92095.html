<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522883087">Hi all,<br/>
I tried to get there from several routes including google.  I get the same address but no go.  Does anyone know if the site is having tech difficulties or is it just me.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

If you can see anything at all, scroll down to the bottom and there&#39;s a link <br/>
to an alternative version.   On mine it doesn&#39;t show without scrolling down.<br/>
<br/>
If you have two browsers, try a different one.<br/>
<br/>
One of mine brings it up, the other doesn&#39;t.<br/>
