&gt;    My boys are into trains.  We went (two hours) to Strasburg, PA to <br/>
&gt; ride on the real Thomas the tank engine.  We visited the railroad <br/>
&gt; museum of PA.  We&#39;re going on a santa train ride, we&#39;re visiting <br/>
&gt; three other train museums.  They have every Thomas toy you could <br/>
&gt; imagine.  We&#39;re touring an engine shed.  <br/>

  Us too!!  We were there for two days in June and three days in September.  <br/>
We&#39;re skipping the December run but plan to go back next year.  We live about <br/>
a half hour from the Steamtown museum and have been there often.  We walk to <br/>
the tracks every day (about two minutes away) to see if there are any boxcars <br/>
waiting for the engine to come and take them away.  I put my dining table in <br/>
the kitchen and the kitchen table (with two leaves) up in the playroom.  We <br/>
are constantly making new setups with the tracks and buildings.  We need <br/>
another table and a bigger room!   Jimmy knows the names and personalities of <br/>
all the trains he has.  We watch the videos and read the books.  After many <br/>
disappointing trips to the library (those books are popular!) I just started <br/>
buying him his own Thomas library.  We travelled to Hershey for an MRI and <br/>
sat in the parking lot of the KFC and watched the trains coming and going.  <br/>
We went to ZooAmerica and his biggest thrill was the monorail going by!<br/>
  That&#39;s what unschooling means to us.  No animals (ok, one cat, and we <br/>
dog-sit fairly regularly), no farm, no back-to-nature good stuff, but lots <br/>
and lots of trains!<br/>
