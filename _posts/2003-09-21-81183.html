<div id="ygrps-yiv-347443057">Hi all needed to share my night..<br/>
<br/>
Last night my mom was remarried.  It was a great event and all went <br/>
wonderfully. The song she played for me was &quot;Child of Mine by Carol King&quot; (most of the <br/>
words are below)<br/>
<br/>
Over the years she and I have not seen eye to eye on adding children to our <br/>
family or HS/Unschooling. Though she has seen some of the notable changes in <br/>
our son and has told us so.  <br/>
No matter what she has said to me over the years I have always stuck by her <br/>
side and forgiven her for her anger which stems from her horrible childhood.  <br/>
She defended me as a child and left my dad for beating me..<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not often she voices support or has positive comments about my choices. <br/>
This song was pretty powerful to me last night. When we began to dance I was <br/>
talking cuz I was nervous and she tapped my shoulder and said <br/>
LISTEN................. Here it is...........................<br/>
<br/>
CHILD OF MINE  by CAROL KING<br/>
Although you see the world different than me... sometimes I can touch upon <br/>
the wonders that you see and all the new colors and pictures you <br/>
design..........................<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes sweet darlin, so glad you are a child of mine, child of mine.....child <br/>
of mine, oh yes sweet darlin so glad you are a child of mine......<br/>
<br/>
You dont need directions you know which way to go...,  i dont want to hold <br/>
you back .... i just want to watch you grow<br/>
your the one who taught me you dont have to look behind.<br/>
<br/>
oh yes sweet darlin, so glad you are a child of mine ............child of <br/>
mine, oh yes sweet darlin so glad..<br/>
<br/>
No bodies gona kill your dreams or tell you how to live your life......   <br/>
they&#39;ll always going to be people to make it hard for a while but you&#39;ll change <br/>
their heads when they see you smile<br/>
<br/>
The times you where born in may not have been the best.. but you can make the <br/>
times to come better than the rest.....  I know you will be honest though you <br/>
cant always be kind...<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes sweet darlin glad you are a child of mine, child of mine oh yes sweet <br/>
darlin so glad you are a child of mine.<br/>

What a beautiful thing for you.  The song brought tears to my eyes.  <br/>
My mom and me do not get along so I can understand some of your <br/>
sentiment.  I hope things continue to grow between the two of you.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091441331">Thank you.<br/>
I DL the song last night and cry every time I listen to it. When I herd it <br/>
come on at the wedding I kinda went ugh cuz I knew it was a song that would <br/>
bring tears to my eyes then my Mom came over to dance I began to ball instantly. <br/>
It is a song that always hit a soft spot in my heart. (that and Cats in the <br/>
cradle is my song that reminds me of my dad) Laura<br/>
&lt;&lt;Laura,<br/>
<br/>
What a beautiful thing for you.  The song brought tears to my eyes.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030856718">What a beautiful gesture, especially if she hasn&#39;t given you much clear support.  It must have been really moving.<br/>
 <br/>
This is a great song.  I love Carol King and have thought of this song many times in ref. to my kids.  <br/>
 <br/>
Did anyone ever see the Gap commercial last holiday season with Carol King and her daughter?  I know, it&#39;s an ad. But it made me weep every time.  Carol King plays the piano and her daughter (or was it Carol) sings &quot;So Far Away&quot; and then the daughter says, &quot;My first love... my mother.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-843775196">What a sweet sweet moment, Laura!!!<br/>
<br/>
I also sing that song to my kids, have since they were babies, and they <br/>
request it sometimes, even as teens who sing WAY better than I do - <br/>
when they&#39;re really sad or sick and I&#39;m comforting them!<br/>
<br/>
You just gave me the heads up that I should remember to include that <br/>
song in the video that we&#39;ll make for each child&#39;s 20th birthday (my <br/>
sister made one for each of her kids&#39; 21st birthdays and I plan to do <br/>
the same for my kids 20th - only a year away for our oldest, so I&#39;d <br/>
better get started).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank so much for sharing that Laura! It made me cry (in a good way ;-) ).<br/>
<br/>
Last nite while working on that horrible project I mentioned, my mom was <br/>
humming and I could&#39;ve sworn it was &quot;Que cera, cera...&quot; I asked her why she was <br/>
humming &quot;Que cera, cera...&quot; and she said she wasn&#39;t, she was just humming. <br/>
Perhaps I heard my own manifestation of that song since my mind was still partially <br/>
stuck here. She said she hadn&#39;t heard that song in years, but she remembered <br/>
how much I used to play it on my &quot;Donny & Marie&quot; recordplayer. I laughed that <br/>
she remembered that, but she asked why that song was on my mind. Not wanting <br/>
to even begin to get into philisophical discussions with my mom, who says I <br/>
wear her out sometimes when we do, I just told her I thought I heard it. <br/>
<br/>
I told her maybe I should google the lyrics, since of course we started to <br/>
sing it and kept getting stuck. She asked if it was easy to google lyrics and I <br/>
said, &quot;Yeah, last week I got the lyrics for &#39;Red River Valley&#39;.&quot; In perfect <br/>
synch, we said, &quot;remember rocking to sleep while you/I sang that song. We <br/>
started to get teary eyed all over song lyrics and we decided we should stop singing <br/>
and get back to working or the project was gonna be turned in with teardrops <br/>
all over it. It&#39;s funny to me that my mom always knows when I need a dose of <br/>
&quot;mommy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx again,<br/>
Rhonda<br/>

<br/>
Ooh...ooh...<br/>
Ooh...<br/>
Oh...ho...<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
If I could<br/>
I’d protect you from the sadness in your eyes<br/>
Give you courage in a world of compromise<br/>
Yes, I would<br/>
<br/>
If I could<br/>
I would teach you all the things I’ve never learned<br/>
And I’d help you cross the bridges that I’ve burned<br/>
Yes, I would<br/>
<br/>
If I could<br/>
I would try to shield your innocence from time<br/>
But the part of life I gave you isn’t mine<br/>
I’ll watch you grow, so I can let you go<br/>
<br/>
If I could<br/>
I would help you make it through the hungry years<br/>
But I know that I can never cry your tears, babe<br/>
But I would If I could<br/>
<br/>
If I could<br/>
In a time and place where you don’t wanna be<br/>
You don’t have to walk along this road with me<br/>
My yesterday won’t have to be your way<br/>
<br/>
If I knew<br/>
I’d try to change the world I brought you to<br/>
Now there isn’t much more that I can do<br/>
But I would If I could<br/>
<br/>
If I could<br/>
I would try to shield your innocence from time<br/>
But the part of life I gave you isn’t mine<br/>
I’ll watch you grow, so I can let you go<br/>
<br/>
If I could<br/>
