&gt; chicken and at that time they wouldn&#39;t let kids under 10 do it. Now<br/>
&gt; dd is 10 and wants to firewalk but I was beginning to think here in<br/>
&gt; lawyer-land I would never be able too. Glad to see they have<br/>

but they&#39;re so far flung that it&#39;s not financially feasible to get to most<br/>
of them.  There is a 2 day celtic festival near here in September though.<br/>
You&#39;ll never guess who&#39;s playing at it!  Fairport Convention (among others)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nooooooo!  Please don&#39;t do it.  For all the reasons that have been stated<br/>
already.  Way too much responsibility to land on their shoulders (even I<br/>
have a hard time not impulse buying in the supermarket!).  For almost every<br/>
expensive &#39;name brand&#39; cereal there is a cheaper generic equivalent.  Tamzin<br/>
and I make out a list and shop together (I&#39;m a single mom so she has to come<br/>
with me, even sometimes when she doesn&#39;t want to &lt;g&gt;).  When she asks for<br/>
something that is stupidly expensive the first thing we do is search for a<br/>
generic equivalent and if that cannot be found, I explain why it is not a<br/>
good buy and point out that we could buy x amount of another food that she<br/>
likes (I give a particular example to her here) for the same price.  It&#39;s<br/>
never been a problem in the store (ie: she doesn&#39;t get upset about it) and<br/>
she gets quite incensed at some of the prices (the other day she commented<br/>
about a particular brand of fruit roll-ups being &quot;a total rip-off&quot; &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
She&#39;s become quite the savvy shopper for her young years.<br/>
