<div id="ygrps-yiv-753932528">November is a good month for homeschoolers to learn how to be frugal<br/>
consumers. Of course, the shopping lessons, at least in our family,<br/>
occur year round, but November has a holiday specifically devoted to<br/>
this purpose, so we try to take advantage.<br/>
<br/>
There is neither a domesticated fowl nor a funny-hatted man with<br/>
silver buckles on his shoes associated with this holiday.  It is not<br/>
Thanksgiving.  In fact, it is a holiday without a name.  I write of<br/>
course of the day after Thanksgiving<br/>
<br/>
On the evening of Thanksgiving Day, after the turkey has hit the soup,<br/>
we gather up all the hundreds of pages of ads for the &quot;After<br/>
Thanksgiving Day Sale&quot;. Now in our homeschooling family, as Quakers,<br/>
we don&#39;t celebrate a traditional gift-giving Christmas, so some of the<br/>
heat is off. But the sales are good, I&#39;m told (though I&#39;ve often<br/>
suspected that the stores just mark up all the prices on their winter<br/>
goods and then take 40% off so that the prices are pretty much the<br/>
same.) We then decide what we &#39;need&#39; or &#39;want&#39;. There&#39;s usually one or<br/>
at most two items to be found in each of six or seven different<br/>
stores, the stores of course being scattered in various and sundry<br/>
parts of the city.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters and I arise at 6 a.m. - this is a special homeschooling<br/>
outing!  I having pressed upon them how important it is to arrive<br/>
early, and having convinced them of the compelling superiority of each<br/>
particular item in the store that is our destination. We arrive at the<br/>
first store a little before 7. Stand it line. Purchase item. Then on<br/>
to the next store, and the next. We are relentlessly efficient..<br/>
Sometimes we have to choose among colors, or designs, or whatnot. But<br/>
no tomfoolery - we know how to do this. We stick to the list. We don&#39;t<br/>
browse. We don&#39;t look at socks in the store where we buy jackets, or<br/>
ties where we get bedspreads. We don&#39;t get distracted by trinkets,<br/>
sale signs, Santa Claus, or handbills. We refuse to be distracted. By<br/>
11 a.m., we are home, like homeschooled big game hunters, having<br/>
bagged our limit.<br/>
<br/>
By 11:30, after surveying our cache over a second cup of coffee,<br/>
nausea sets in. I have convinced myself, and started to convince most<br/>
of the rest of the family (my wife, having conscientiously abstained,<br/>
doesn&#39;t need much convincing), that at least half the things we<br/>
purchased we really don&#39;t need, or they aren&#39;t particularly nice, or<br/>
they aren&#39;t any better than the same item we saw for ten percent of<br/>
the price we paid in the local thrift shop, and I don&#39;t like sleeping<br/>
under a blanket made by exploited women in Bangladesh or watching my<br/>
younger daughter run around in athletic shoes fabricated in<br/>
unventilated sweatshops in Indonesia (has anyone found a good<br/>
alternative for these?) And so my holiday will turn into a weekend of<br/>
returns! How do I communicate all of my thoughts and feelings about<br/>
these issues to my two daughters as part of our homeschooling experience?<br/>
<br/>
There is no question that I (like many Americans) suffer from a very<br/>
particular neurotic &#39;thought disorder&#39;, and I am now in recovery.<br/>
Teaching our children to become knowledgeable consumers is important,<br/>
even an essential part of our homeschooling efforts. But, to me,<br/>
liberating my children by providing alternatives to America&#39;s religion<br/>
of consumption (of which public education is a key component) and<br/>
helping them understand the non-material basis for a truly satisfying<br/>
life is central to my family&#39;s homeschooling efforts.<br/>
<br/>
And now I&#39;ve gotten some help. The day has been given an appropriate<br/>
name - &quot;International Buy Nothing Day&quot;! Check it out at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/">http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/</a>  Started about five years ago by a<br/>
Canadian magazine named Adbusters. BND, as it is now affectionately<br/>
known, was celebrated last year in more than 30 countries, including<br/>
France, Japan, Panama, Israel, South Korea, Canada, Brazil, and the<br/>
United States.  Billed as a &quot;global carnival of life in the face of<br/>
consumer conformity&quot;, BND has gone so far as to produce radio and<br/>
television spots to get their message across, though in most cases the<br/>
spots have been rejected by network executives [&quot;Contrary to the<br/>
function of advertising itself and against our ethics (sic),&quot; said<br/>
one)] only to make their appearance on the evening news.  On their<br/>
website, you can download &quot;Christmas Gift Exemption Vouchers&quot; to give<br/>
to friends and family, templates for buttons and tee shirts, and a<br/>
full range of posters and press releases. A celebration is likely<br/>
coming to a town or city near you. Your rebellious (or just socially<br/>
conscious) homeschooled teen or pre-teen will love it!<br/>
<br/>
Not quite ready for Buy Nothing Day? Well, then connect up with the<br/>
Center for a New American Dream&#39;s &quot;Kids and Commercialism Campaign&quot;.<br/>
You can find them online at www.newdream.org/campaign/kids/index.html.<br/>
 Download their excellent brochure, &quot;Tips for Parenting in a<br/>
Commercial Culture.&quot;  There is a website for kids full of fun,<br/>
non-commercial play ideas, advice from responsible consumption gurus,<br/>
essay contests, and links to dozens of groups who will keep you better<br/>
informed as you gird up your loins, take up your battle axe, and stand<br/>
ready to defend your homeschooling hearth and kin against the next<br/>
advertising onslaught.<br/>
<br/>
Holidays are an important part of our lives as homeschoolers. We can,<br/>
if we choose, use our holidays to reconnect ourselves with friends,<br/>
with nature, and with our playful, creative sides, with our<br/>
spirituality, and help rebuild communities that extend far beyond the<br/>
confines of the shopping mall parking lots. And, if we&#39;re really<br/>
smart, we can do that with our children every day. For me, that&#39;s what<br/>
homeschooling is all about.<br/>
<br/>
Make a poster with your kids emblazoned &quot;More Fun, Less Stuff!&quot; Try it<br/>
out as a homeschooling family slogan (you could even write a family<br/>
jingle!), and hang it in a prominent place. Next time you feel the<br/>
urge to shop coming on, look at the poster, and you&#39;ll know it&#39;s time<br/>
to clean out the garage. &quot;Hey, this could spell the end of<br/>
civilization as we know it,&quot; says my friend Anthony (I think he was<br/>
referring to responsible consumerism, not to the new era of<br/>
uncluttered garages across America.) <br/>
<br/>
Who said homeschooling is not a subversive idea??<br/>
