<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061779109">Dylan has learned how to snap his fingers.  <br/>
Every where he goes he snaps.  Mostly these quiet little snaps, snap,<br/>
snap, snap.  It sounds like we have termites.  Every once in awhile he<br/>
manages a big one and comes and announced that now he can REALLY snap but<br/>
then the next one is quiet, and off he goes.<br/>
<br/>
My friend called, all excited, and said her seventh grader is doing<br/>
algebra.  <br/>
I said DYLAN CAN SNAP HIS FINGERS!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He can also jump now and touch the pull chain for the ceiling fan in the<br/>
dining room.  He gets a running start in the living room and leaps for<br/>
it. BOOM, snap, snap, snap.<br/>

Isn&#39;t it wonderful!  My daughter has been doing that very same thing for about 1 1/2 weeks now.  She can now snap in circles, above her head, behind her back, etc...  She is also doing the same with whistling ....running to us when she accomplishes it, only to not be quite able to reproduce the sound in our presence.   :(  Practice, practice, practice!!<br/>
