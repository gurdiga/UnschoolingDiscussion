<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098700511">Something happened while I was at a playgroup with Jayn yesterday that has<br/>
gotten me thinking about when �treating children respectfully� becomes<br/>
�treating children like they are stupid�.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn and I had just arrived at Art Zone � a storefront art play house with<br/>
tables, innumerable craft supplies, and a wet room. We paused to greet one<br/>
of the families we were meeting, where the little girl (also 4.5) was<br/>
reading a book spread on the floor partially blocking the path.  She started<br/>
telling me something about the book and I made some appreciative comment,<br/>
and was about to move on when the moderator (for want of a better word) came<br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She got down on the floor beside Sophia, and in a very gentle voice launched<br/>
into a lengthy talk about how Sophia was blocking the path and look how your<br/>
friends can�t get past and we need this walkway and it must be a great book<br/>
but would you mind moving to another place or could you come up with another<br/>
idea? Blah blah in a very sing songy voice � you know the one � the �talking<br/>
to little kids so they don�t feel bad� voice.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was kind of caught by surprise, mostly because I didn�t need help getting<br/>
by. I had intended to speak to Sophia like she was a rational person and<br/>
just say �Excuse me� and pass. I think Jayn had already said that and run<br/>
ahead to meet up with her other friend. Sophia couldn�t get away fast enough<br/>
� and it was clear to me the book was no longer holding her interest and she<br/>
wanted to follow Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My thought is that this kind of sweetly excessive speech is almost as<br/>
disrespectful as bossing, in a kind of insidious creeping put-down way. I<br/>
know it really is better than embarrassing the kid with orders, but it just<br/>
seems so false. If it were an adult, wouldn�t you just say �Excuse me� and<br/>
expect that after a couple (or even one) of those the adult would look<br/>
around and notice � �Oh I�m in the way� - and shift? At most how about<br/>
calmly saying with a smile, �Sophia your book is blocking the path�.  I try<br/>
to avoid using that kind of �down to� talk. I find it maddening to have to<br/>
listen to it in others. Is it just me? Am I crazy?<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re not crazy, but it IS hard to discuss.  I&#39;ve always considered that <br/>
&quot;the poodle voice,&quot; the &quot;you like Schookums&quot; voice women used to (probably still <br/>
do) when they&#39;re talking to their poodle (and sometimes actually trying to <br/>
communicate with the people around them in that horrible bank-shot way).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something glorious from another list a few years ago (thanks again Dan <br/>
Vilter!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a French poodle.  It&#39;s horrible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At a park day, we were having a discussion about the usefulness of praise<br/>
and sincerity.  The unschoolers in the group were trying to point out the<br/>
fallacy of over and insincere praise, and indirectly about treating your<br/>
children as people first.  After much talk getting nowhere, one of the other<br/>
unschooling parents turned to me and in the French poodle voice started<br/>
thanking me for all the things I had done for the group that day. Something<br/>
like,&quot;Oh Dan, thank you for bringing the stove for hot cocoa. You did such a<br/>
good job setting it up and heating the water! You&#39;re so strong carrying that<br/>
big jug of water all by yourself!&quot;  Everyone had a good laugh and the point<br/>
was succinctly made.<br/>

==================<br/>
<br/>
See, I wouldn&#39;t call that woman &quot;respectful&quot; at all--I think that tone *is*<br/>
downright disrespectful, regardless of what she thought she was doing.<br/>
<br/>
But, with younger children, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d say something as vague as just<br/>
&quot;excuse me&quot; either. I&#39;d probably just say, &quot;Sopia, would you mind moving<br/>
over there with your book so people can get by?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m trying to say that there&#39;s a middle ground that I think is<br/>
important for younger children because it demonstrates the reasoning behind<br/>
the request. There&#39;s something in the middle of no information and drippy,<br/>
sweeet lecturing, if you know what I mean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975807068">Yes, I&#39;ve heard it called a mini-lecturein the book Living Joyfully <br/>
With Children. I can&#39;t stand to be on the receiving end and goodness <br/>
knows that I NEVER succumb to this myself. (Uh, trying not to squirm <br/>

These are people with really strong &quot;parent tapes&quot; who have to fight <br/>
their own automatic responses. It sounds forced and fake, but it is WAY <br/>
better to talk to a kid sweetly, even if it is sickeningly sweet, than <br/>
to hit them.<br/>
