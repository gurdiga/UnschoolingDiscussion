<div id="ygrps-yiv-957500790">Hi Shannon,<br/>
Ummm possibly in fact, probably water will end up everywhere! We were lucky<br/>
in that the base of our shower was quite deep ( I think they call it a<br/>
Shub(??) But still at least she would be happy, you would be clean and<br/>
smelling daisy-fresh (lol) and the bathroom floor would be clean!! Sounds<br/>
like a very unschool suggestion to me!! *evilgrin*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183197878">LOL! Yes, it is an unschool suggestion :-) Well, first I&#39;ll have to get<br/>
rid of the floor mats and then clean up all the magazines that are<br/>
stacked on the library, um, I mean bathroom floor. Otherwise we&#39;ll have<br/>
mushy floor mats, soggy issues of Mothering and drippy Woodworking<br/>
catalogs :-) Of course, first I&#39;ll have to get the hand held shower<br/>
thingy . . . . . <br/>

<div><font size="2">before we moved to our new house (1 bath, 2 showers, 3 
toilets, NO character!!) we used those hand-held numbers and we found that they 
worked for a while then eventually they started falling off the taps, but at 
only Â£3.50 a throw it wasn&#39;t so bad :-)</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830761406">Instead of those rubber ones that fall of the tops there are those &quot;proper&quot;<br/>
ones that kind of hook up like a regular shower and can also be unhooked and<br/>
held in hand (also great for singing in the shower!!!)<br/>
