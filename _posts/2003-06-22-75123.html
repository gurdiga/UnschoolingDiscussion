<br/>
When I was little and had to stay home from school because I was ill, my mom <br/>
always took me to her work with her. At the time my dad was still in law <br/>
school  and my mom could not financially afford to stay home. I didn&#39;t care where I <br/>
was when not feeling well, only that I was with my mommy. Anyway, before I <br/>
start to ramble about loving memories of my childhood, I&#39;ll get to the point. <br/>
hehehe<br/>
<br/>
My mom was a legal secretary and her work had this humongous (to a kid) <br/>
maroon leather couch.(Which BTW, we say maroon all the time in reference to <br/>
color.)I&#39;d lay on it and watch my mom juggle so many things at once. I always loved <br/>
how she answered the phone....&quot;Law office...&quot; with the most beautiful lilt in <br/>
her voice. It was so pretty how she said just those two words. After that, I&#39;d <br/>
hear...&quot;My I ask who&#39;s calling?&quot;...again with such a beautiful tone. To this <br/>
day she still answers the same way and I&#39;m 33. I say, &quot;May I ask who&#39;s <br/>
calling?&quot;, when a call is not for me and a person is specified. I would find it rude <br/>
to not be able to either give the name to whoever the phone is for or to not be <br/>
able to use their name in responding if the party requested is not here or in <br/>
unavailable. No one ever told me this is how you do it, I just knew by <br/>
watching my mom. So when someone calls and the party they are looking for is <br/>
unavailable, I&#39;d say something to the effect of, &quot;I&#39;m sorry John, Phil is not here, <br/>
may I take a message.&quot; I know a lot of people who may just reply, &quot;So & so <br/>
isn&#39;t here.&quot; Nothing more. I don&#39;t take offense, it&#39;s just different. <br/>

Oh I feel the same way.  If someone calls for Tara and I don&#39;t know them<br/>
well at all, (it&#39;s usually a boy) I feel it&#39;s fake sounding for him to make<br/>
idle chit chat. Now if it&#39;s someone I&#39;ve come to know, and that doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily have to be for a long time, just someone I clicked with, then<br/>
it&#39;s nice when they talk. But I certainly wouldn&#39;t expect it every time. And<br/>
being that I hate the telephone anyway, I&#39;d hate staying on longer than I<br/>
had to speaking with someone who wants to talk to someone else!!<br/>

See another thing I hadn&#39;t thought of. I always ask who&#39;s on the other end<br/>
if I don&#39;t know. Always have. I remember a girlfriend calling me when I was<br/>
like 11 or 12. As soon as my mom would answer the phone, she would just say<br/>
&quot;Is Mary there?&quot; My mom absolutely hated that. She told me I should say<br/>
something to my friend or she would. I did and it was taken care of. All my<br/>
mom wanted was a hello first and then &quot;is Mary there!&quot; So I guess learned<br/>
that it was important to be nice over the phone. And me handing the phone to<br/>
someone else in the house and none of us knowing who it is wouldn&#39;t seem<br/>
nice. Tara even always asks before handing over the phone. Maybe some people<br/>
wouldn&#39;t like a kid asking them such a thing. Not sure. But we all do it<br/>

  Mary, wow, I like your mom&#39;s style.  As a child, if I asked who was on the other end, my parents told me it was rude and none of my business, even when I said it nicely, like, &quot;may I ask who&#39;s calling, please?&quot;  <br/>
  And with the former instance of not saying hello to the other person.  Nobody ever did that when I was growing up.  I don&#39;t know why.  It was only when someone told me it was rude and showed no respect for the other person that I changed it in myself.<br/>
<br/>
  I usually do make a bit of small talk when I&#39;m calling someone, especially when kids answer the phone.  I think I make less small talk with adults, they&#39;re not as fun.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think I ever taught Margaux phone ettiquette, but I love the way she speaks when she calls someone.  It usually goes<br/>
  like this:<br/>
<br/>
  Hi!  This is Margaux.  Fine, thank you.  Can BJ come out to play?  mmhmm, Okay.<br/>
  pause.....<br/>
<br/>
  Hi BJ!  This is Margaux.  Do you want to come over?<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps I should tell her to ask for BJ or whoever, but she does the same thing with everyone, even her grandparents.  Usually the person on the other end figures out with whom Margaux wants to speak.<br/>
<br/>
  I think it&#39;s mostly regional or cultural, but I don&#39;t think it would ever offend anyone to say, &quot;Hi, this is Nichole, is Annette available, please?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Most of my daughters&#39; teenage friends don&#39;t usually do that though - <br/>
and these are very nice kids - they just haven&#39;t been told to do it and <br/>
haven&#39;t thought of it. When they call here, sometimes I don&#39;t ask who <br/>
it is, but when I call to my daughters to come to the phone, I say <br/>
(with phone uncovered so they can hear): &quot;I guess it is a mystery phone <br/>
call - they didn&#39;t say who it was.....&quot; Or some silly thing. Their <br/>
friends are friendly with me too - so they get the point and usually <br/>
when my daughter gets on the phone, she&#39;ll turn around and say, <br/>
&quot;So-and-so says hi and they&#39;re sorry they didn&#39;t say who they were.&quot; Or <br/>
something like that. I try to use humor when I find teenage friends <br/>
needing a little help in the courtesy department --- I hope parents of <br/>
my kids&#39; friends will do the same for my kids - not lecture them or <br/>
chastise them - but some little friendly good-humored reminders.<br/>

I also noticed that, after taking the receptionist job, I started to<br/>

You should say: &quot;Hi this is Nichole. How are you? How are the kids? Is <br/>
everybody well? Oh, I&#39;m sorry she has a cold and hope she feels better <br/>
soon. Please give my love to your son and daughter and your husband.&quot; <br/>
And you should respond to their similar small talk. Only when that is <br/>
all done can you say, &quot;I have something I need to talk to so-and-so <br/>
about, is she there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As Americans, they do cut us a lot of slack - this takes the form, <br/>
though, of basically expecting us to be a little rude and trying not to <br/>
hold it against us.<br/>
<br/>
It is VERY pleasing to them and shows a lot more respect for them if we <br/>
DO take the time to be courteous (courteous as it appears to them). It <br/>
isn&#39;t that much effort - gets to be a habit and is rather pleasant.<br/>

<br/>
Having guests from India, they decided to serve Indian food.  <br/>
<br/>
HOW DUMB!!!  And the chef was sick in bed so rest of the staff tried to make <br/>
things they  had neither seen nor tasted.<br/>
<br/>
They should have just served some really decent English food.<br/>

I had one single friend who used to hang up the phone without saying goodbye. <br/>
 He had nearly  no social skills and ended up killing himself.<br/>

My kids have pretty good phone manners.  The only thing I wish they would do <br/>
differently is to ask if they could please speak to someone, rather than <br/>
asking if he&#39;s home.  Whether he&#39;s home or not might be none of their business.  <br/>
And just because he&#39;s home doesn&#39;t mean he can talk.  Maybe the person on the <br/>
phone is in the midst of a long distance call.  Maybe the target person is in <br/>
the shower or asleep.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My brother-in-law (nice enough guys - rather aggressive and rooted in <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A friend of mine has taken to saying &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind a bit if I call him at work, and he says &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;  That <br/>
makes sense.   <br/>
<br/>
The dumb part is when he calls ME, when I&#39;m busy and minding my own business <br/>
with great intent and he interrupts me and says &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have just said, every time, &quot;I don&#39;t know.  You called me.  What&#39;s up?&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t really get it.  It&#39;s just a thing he says without thinking.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Simpson&#39;s episode where Bart sees the future, and he and Millhouse <br/>
are grown and housemates.  &quot;Smell ya later&quot; has become the standard closing <br/>
statement in conversations.  It has replaced &quot;good bye.&quot;  Even newscasters close <br/>
their broadcast with &quot;Smell ya later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Millhouse becomes so furious with Bart about something that he&#39;s moving out, <br/>
and that&#39;s that.  He says &quot;Smell ya later--FOREVER.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt;  As a child, if I asked who was on the other end, my parents told me it <br/>
was rude and none of my business, even when I said it nicely, like, &quot;may I ask <br/>
who&#39;s calling, please?&quot;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t ask.  If someone calls for my husband and he&#39;s home, I <br/>
usually just take him a phone, or say &quot;It&#39;s for you,&quot; and leave the room.<br/>
<br/>
He usually asks &quot;Who is this?&quot; if it&#39;s for me, but MADDENINGLY then just says <br/>
&quot;Sure, here she is&quot; and doesn&#39;t tell ME who it is.  He was just curious. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With the kids, if they&#39;re right there, I don&#39;t ask who it is.  If they&#39;re not <br/>
there and I think I know who it is, I&#39;ll say &quot;Is this Logan?&quot;  I&#39;m not always <br/>
right.  If I am, I say &quot;I&#39;ll leave him a note that you called.  Where will <br/>
you be about 6:00?&quot;    or I might say &quot;Who is this, so I can tell him you <br/>
called?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any of my business who it is, and sometimes I <br/>
just don&#39;t want to be in the loop.  I answer the phone and hand it off.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a good friend of MINE calls and asked for Keith.  Then I ask later <br/>
what the other person wanted.  (Sometimes they told me if I answered, like &quot;I <br/>
wanted to ask Keith about borrowing his saw.  Is he there?&quot;)<br/>

<br/>
    I wish my friends would do that more often.  They call me up on the <br/>
phone, and just start yapping.  They&#39;re at work, and I&#39;m at home.  It never occured <br/>
to them that maybe *I* was busy.  I&#39;m the only SAHM of all of us, btw.  <br/>
<br/>
    Does anyone else have that problem?  I did handle it pretty well, I <br/>
thought, I just explained to them that I understood they had a free moment at work, <br/>
but that I would appreciate the same respect I give them when I call them,  &quot; <br/>
Are you busy, do you have time for me right now?&quot;  They still forget <br/>
sometimes, but if I am busy, telling them so reminds them that just because I&#39;m home, <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m always available to talk.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There&#39;s a Simpson&#39;s episode where Bart sees the future, and he and <br/>
Millhouse <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s Ralph ( I can hear that squeaky voice...&quot;Smell ya later Bart, smell ya <br/>
later...forever.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I love that episode.  Lisa legalizes &quot;it&quot; for Bart.  lol <br/>
