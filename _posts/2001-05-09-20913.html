know, cellulose, the fiber that&#39;s in carrots that makes them so <br/>
crunchy?  I&#39;ve gotten them by mail from a company called 7th <br/>
Generation in the past.  We wash them out and re-use them.<br/>

How about sitting down and talking to him, and explaining that you <br/>
need to know where he is because what if somebody came by and <br/>
kidnapped him while he was outside, and you would never know it? <br/>
(use a little scare tactic here...after all, it is a legitimate concern).  <br/>
Tell him that you will get a bell (a loud one) and when you walk <br/>
outside and ring it, he needs to come just so you can see he&#39;s ok.  <br/>
Every time he comes when you ring the bell, he gets some kind of <br/>
token.  You could make it real money, or you could make it a <br/>
privilege that he really wants, or whatever.  Get a jar to put his <br/>
money or tokens in.  Tell him if you ring the bell and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
come, you will be calling the police to come and look for him, <br/>
because you will assume he has been kidnapped.  Also, if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t come, YOU get to keep the token, and put it in YOUR jar, <br/>
and then you get to go and do something without him (something <br/>
he&#39;d really like to do).  After a few times of doing this, actually <br/>
make a big deal one day of how you are leaving him with Dad and <br/>
little sister so you can go do a fun thing by yourself, and that he <br/>
absolutely CANNOT go.  Then, take a little holiday yourself and go <br/>
enjoy  it.  <br/>
<br/>
When he does come in, have something that he really likes but <br/>
doesn&#39;t get very often, available.  It might be a special food, it might <br/>
be an art project that is too messy or involved to get out while little <br/>
sister is up.  When there is something that I want to get my kids <br/>
interested in doing, it never works to say &quot;Come on over and do <br/>
this with me&quot; but if I just start doing to by myself and they see me <br/>
enjoying myself, they will often come over and want to do it too.  <br/>
Like, I&#39;d probably get a HUGE piece of butcher paper that would <br/>
cover a whole wall (even if I had to take the pictures off the wall and <br/>
everything to cover it).  Then I&#39;d have pots of paint and different <br/>
sponges and brushes, and when he came in, I&#39;d just be painting <br/>
away in one corner of the paper.  I know my kids wouldn&#39;t be able <br/>
to resist picking up a brush, especially if this paper covered a <br/>
whole wall and they could really get wild with their painting. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that just some stuff I would do.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000842431">Wellllll, we grew up in the Bay Area and my Dad was a health nut before it<br/>
was even a phrase (we are talking the early 50&#39;s here, the DARK ages &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
As to the &quot;not allowed then, addicted now&quot; syndrome (they have a name for<br/>
it), I never really experienced it.  I just really don&#39;t like all that<br/>
unnatural sweet stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the kidlets have the urge and some don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t have it in the<br/>
house and when they are feeling a real urge, we make something &quot;good&quot; sweet<br/>
like making our own &quot;frooze fruit.&quot;  I make some cookies but mostly unbaked<br/>
with lots of peanut butter, oats and raisens in them.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also found that you can get by with half as much sugar when you make<br/>
things like whipped cream using organic (read the label for the ones like<br/>
Organic Valley that only have cream on the label) cream and organic<br/>
unbleached sugar or honey.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also noticed that about half their urge to splurge is satisfied by<br/>
something sticky &lt;g&gt;  and that one or two of the finger licking, ooey-gooey,<br/>
sticky peanut butter cookies satisfies them where a whole box of store<br/>
bought wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and fruit leathers are another one they just love.  And homemade<br/>
smoothies!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228138970">That is when it is highest.  It is funny, when I was a kid my dad had a<br/>
lunchbox with a glass thermos and everything was either in old jelly jars or<br/>
wrapped in wax paper.  We are going back to that.  The kidlets decided that<br/>
they didn&#39;t want the jelly jars so they picked out some neat tins at<br/>
Christmas time and use them as their snack carry around holders.  In fact, I<br/>
think we have started a trend as I have noticed some other kids with the<br/>
metal tins *and* the not so nice looks from their mothers &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They each bough hemp bags, have their metal thermos bottles and their little<br/>
tins and that is what we take with us when we go exploring.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the neat part is that if they set them down we don&#39;t have the<br/>

a very distinctive tin that belongs to only them &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Teflon or whatever they are currently calling it, breaks down and flakes off<br/>
  in your food from day one.  Starts out, our chemist friend who loves to<br/>
  grose out the kidlets &lt;g&gt; said, like dandruf and gets worse with age until<br/>
  you have the embarassing big flakes you see in commercials.  Now, picture<br/>
  that and try to cook and eat something out of a non-stick pan &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  &gt; Although the plastic breaks down more drastically and<br/>
  &gt; quickly under the application of heat, even non-heated<br/>
  &gt; plastics shed into food over time.  As do non-stick<br/>
  &gt; materials, generally, though I think some<br/>
  &gt; manufacturers claim that this is not true of some<br/>
  &gt; specific coatings.  I certainly am not an expert in<br/>
  &gt; this area... Lynda?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045818091">I am one of those lucky folks that has environmental allergies.  We bought a<br/>
new mattress a few years ago and I&#39;m allergic to what&#39;s in it.  I can&#39;t use<br/>
foam pillows and can only use feather (the allergists either shake or<br/>
scratch their heads).<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had any problems with the really old-fashioned canning jars with<br/>
the old gasket type rubber seal thingys.  We&#39;ve also done the ceramic thing<br/>
where the kidlets made a bunch of elfs and stuff for the garden.  When they<br/>
did that I made ceramic canisters.  Those are great because I know exactly<br/>
what they are made of and what is in them.<br/>
<br/>
We are real lucky in that we live in a house that was built in 1903 and<br/>
everything is real wood, no particle board, no formaldehyde kinda crud<br/>
except some really old floor and counter stuff which we are gradually<br/>
removing.<br/>
<br/>
The best I can say about what all this has meant to us came from some<br/>
doctors.  Hubby had cancer (colo-rectal).  That is when I finally stop the<br/>
slow conversion and put my foot down!  Hard!  &lt;g&gt;  At first they said it was<br/>
going to require a colostomy.  I changed his diet completely, did my<br/>
homework on chemo and radiation and found a radiation oncologist that would<br/>
work with us. (The regular oncologist was a b*tt!) His tumor was reduced<br/>
from over 20 cm to about 1.5 inches.  He lost no hair, he lost no weight, he<br/>
had no adverse reactions.  AND, he did not have to have a colostomy!!!!  The<br/>
docs took reams of notes and admitted that the diet had a lot to do with the<br/>
results!<br/>
<br/>
Also, the kidlets are healthier looking and have more energy (o.k., so there<br/>
are some negatives &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Also, we are gradually going to all natural, unbleached cotton for bedding,<br/>
etc.  I noticed that since we started buying local honey and using cotton<br/>
bedding that all their little rash type allergy type things have gone away.<br/>
No more itching, no more red eyes, no more sneezing.<br/>

&gt;  Katie, my laptop fell while I was responding to your<br/>
&gt;  post, and now both my response and your post/address<br/>
&gt;  are lost... I want to respond, but don&#39;t know where to<br/>
&gt;  send it!  Write again, okay?<br/>
