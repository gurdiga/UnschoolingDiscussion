<div id="ygrps-yiv-659067989">I had to send this along, for it made me smile. Of course, I got it from a <br/>
different list. <br/>
Stephanie<br/>
Mommy to Tiffany, Martin, James and Stacie.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; A man observed a woman in the grocery store with a three year<br/>
 old girl in her basket.  As they passed the cookie section, the<br/>
 child asked for cookies and her mother told her &quot;no.&quot;  The little<br/>
 girl immediately began to whine and fuss, and the mother said<br/>
 quietly, &quot;Now Ellen, we just have half of the aisles left to go<br/>
 through; don&#39;t be upset.  It won&#39;t be long.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 He passed the Mother again in the candy aisle.  Of course, the<br/>
 little girl began to shout for candy.  When she was told she<br/>
 couldn&#39;t have any, she began to cry.  The mother said, &quot;There,<br/>
 there, Ellen, don&#39;t cry.  Only two more aisles to go, and then<br/>
 we&#39;ll be checking out.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 The man again happened to be behind the pair at the check-out,<br/>
 where the little girl immediately began to clamor for gum and burst<br/>
 into a terrible tantrum upon discovering there would be no gum<br/>
 purchased today.  The mother patiently said, &quot;Ellen, we&#39;ll be<br/>
 through this check out stand in five minutes, and then you can go<br/>
 home and have a nice nap.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 The man followed them out to the parking lot and stopped the<br/>
 woman to compliment her.  &quot;I couldn&#39;t help noticing how patient<br/>
 you were with little Ellen...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 The mother broke in, &quot;My little girl&#39;s name is Tammy... I&#39;m<br/>
 Ellen.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
