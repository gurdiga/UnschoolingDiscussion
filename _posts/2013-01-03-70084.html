<div id="ygrps-yiv-944417787">Last weekend at the ALL Unschooling Symposium there was a panel of moderators from this group, talking about the problem that sometimes new members complain that we won&#39;t just answer their questions directly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m being interviewed this afternoon, and in going through the exchange to remind myself what I&#39;m supposed to be prepared to discuss, I found this and thought some parts of it might be of interest here.  That&#39;s below.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I thought maybe some people who were in Albuquerque for this symposium could tell what they took from that panel (or panelists might want to expand on something or summarize something).  <br/>
<br/>
--------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-and honoring each member of my family as a free individual - free to decide how to spend time-=-<br/>
<br/>
The term &quot;free&quot; is problematical and I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t use it because it could take 45 minutes to discuss the problems with the concept of &quot;freedom.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But separate individual, whole individual, giving family members tons of choices, I can talk about that.  Choices can be given.  &quot;Freedom&quot; can&#39;t be.  If you want to do another whole podcast about that someday, I&#39;d be willing, but it might be better if you avoid asking me about  &quot; a freedom-based&quot; anything. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The rest of it is easily doable.<br/>
<br/>
-=- There was something about a mom teaching her kids to read packaged foods - to see what&#39;s in it. And she says, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m gonna need to learn to read.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t the mom read to the child?<br/>
No child can learn to read before she&#39;s capable, and there are many things that need to be in place before reading can happen.<br/>
No child can keep from reading once all those skills are developed, *unless* she&#39;s been pressured and wasn&#39;t ready and has been told or decided she&#39;s &quot;a non-reader.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Any talk of a mom teaching a child anything (reading or anything else) is going to lead me to this<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>
so if you want to stick with your other topics, avoid questions about teaching, too.<br/>
<br/>
If you WANT to go to that, I&#39;m willing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21743241">&lt;&lt; My child wants to learn to read, how can I help him pursue his interest until he is reading? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t reading be considered an interest? Or am I misunderstanding?<br/>
<br/>
What if a child wanted to learn how to hoop (fancy hula hooping)? Would we be talking about finding ways to distract the child from not knowing how to hoop yet, or pursuing interests despite not knowing how to hoop, protecting him from people who might embarrass him for not knowing how to hoop or hooping for him?<br/>
<br/>
What if *reading* is the interest?<br/>
<br/>
My kids all knew how to read when we started unschooling. So, I can&#39;t speak to unschooing nonreaders but I know as a kid *I* was obsessed with the written word and learned how to read before most of my peers. This was not necessarily because I was taught but because it was one of my biggest interests and had a strong desire to be like the adults that I was surrounded with. I was an only child with no young relatives. I felt like the written word was a secret language between adults and I didn&#39;t like the need for a translator. I wanted direct access to what felt like hidden information to me.<br/>
<br/>
I quite sure I would have been frustrated and felt patronized if I came to my mother with a desire to learn to read and she tried to distract me or instead tried to support some other interest/s she thought was more of - well - an interest. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099243598">They are asking how to teach a child to read because the child wants to<br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t answering that question because &quot;wanting&quot; to read isn&#39;t the same<br/>
as being ready to learn, first, and because teaching isn&#39;t necessary if the<br/>
child actually is ready.<br/>
<br/>
A child will learn to read naturally by living in a print-rich environment<br/>
with people who read for pleasure and for usefulness, who answer questions<br/>
sensitively, and help the child cheerfully when reading is needed.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re misunderstanding.<br/>
An interest in reading does not equal the ability to read.<br/>
When a child can read, the child DOES read.<br/>
When a child isn&#39;t ready to read, no amount of instruction can help.  It can only hurt.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If  a child who was too young, or too uncoordinated, or too weak to hoop wanted to, maybe I would distract him or her, or find other ways to play with a hula hoop.  Holly took care of a girl, fulltime, for a while, whose muscle tone was so lacking that she couldn&#39;t roll a ball.  We cut plastic gallons of water with a sword at the Monkey Platter Festival.  This girl could only swing the sword to touch the gallon.  When Holly asked a speech therapist friend of ours for advice about the girls difficulty speaking clearly, the questions that came up (from Pushpa, in case any of you might want to consider speech therapy from an unschooling mom  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/pushpa/">http://sandradodd.com/pushpa/</a> ) uncovered the connection in all of that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What if *reading* is the interest?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Many children want to ride bicycles before they&#39;re ready to do it.<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re talking about unschooling and unschooled kids who haven&#39;t yet learned, but who WILL learn, to read in their own natural and gradual (or kind of sudden) way, in the course of their unschooling.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a><br/>
There are dozens of stories there, in some detail, of the ways in which unschoolers have learned to read.  <br/>
<br/>
Interest and desire aren&#39;t factors.<br/>
Instruction and pressure can kill the interest and desire, though.  School does it all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers should NOT attempt to teach reading because a child has asked to learn to read, because they can do the same kind of damage school does, and in addition to that can harm the partnership/relationship between the parent and child.<br/>

to read,&quot; and mom would try to teach him/her before the child was<br/>
cognitively ready - leading to frustration and the child thinking she/he<br/>
was stupid (or being labeled as learning disabled)?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter how much a child wishes she could read - if she&#39;s not<br/>
developmentally ready then no amount of instruction will help and it can<br/>
hurt.<br/>
<br/>
If a 5-year-old child wants to fly an airplane, we can find ways to support<br/>
that interest for a while until the child is ready (developmentally) to<br/>
realistically consider flying lessons. Wanting to fly doesn&#39;t make the kid<br/>
ready to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Kids become ready to read at widely varying ages. But they often want to<br/>
read when they are not ready because their friends are being taught to read<br/>
in school and they&#39;re hearing about it. The teaching of reading in the<br/>
schools is a huge wasted effort and often damaging (probably the cause of a<br/>
lot of so-called learning disabilities). But the kids don&#39;t know that and<br/>
so they want to learn what their friends are learning. As they get older,<br/>
they can feel even more of that pressure. But that doesn&#39;t make them ready<br/>
to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46134894"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Interest and desire aren&#39;t factors.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I desagree with this. Learning to read isn&#39;t different from learning anything else, in that a child can have a desire to acquire a specific skill, and be willing to study or receive instruction to obtain that skill. Why wouldn&#39;t it be like that? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Unschoolers should NOT attempt to teach reading because a child has asked to learn to read, because they can do the same kind of damage school does, and in addition to that can<br/>
 </span></blockquote> harm the partnership/relationship between the parent and child.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand this viewpoint. It sounds very set in stone :)<br/>
Instruction isn&#39;t by definition causing damage. Unsollicited instruction is highly likely to, but that&#39;s something very different from help that is asked for. If my child asks for my help, even if that is &quot;mom, teach me to read please&quot;,  then I am not harming the partnership in any way, because I am invited to &quot;teach&quot; and as long as I don&#39;t take over the learning process and push it further or in another direction than what is asked for, then my child is still in charge of his learning project. <br/>
<br/>
Not everything has to be learnt by osmosis/autodidact. Imo, formal instruction has it&#39;s place in unschooling too, as long as it is wanted. I sometimes get the feeling that you think learning &quot;on your own&quot; is somehow superior to receiving instruction. Is this so? Or is it mainly with regards to reading you feel this way?<br/>

I obviously agree with this, but don&#39;t you think, that one can still decide to learn something one is not totally ready for? It might mean more work and a different approach, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is necessarily a bad idea or that the attempt will fail.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose son asked to learn to read (at around age 8). He wanted easy-readers and such from the library. So they worked with those. He really, really wanted to learn *now* because he was so frustrated that he didn&#39;t understand the foreign movies he was watching and couldn&#39;t read to catch the subtitles. He asked for formal instruction, and is happy as bunny now that he reads like a pro. <br/>

<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hooping is a thing. Hooping is an end in itself. Reading is a tool. It&#39;s a means to an end. Reading is about deriving information from the environment. It isn&#39;t the same as wanting to go to a cosplay event or the same as loving kookaburras. It is more like wanting to drive. And while there are ways in which driving is an end, race car driving for example or derby car, and while there are ways to meet some of a desire to drive before you are of legal driving age, like going to bumper cars or building a box car, mostly driving is a means to an end. And end that can be met in lots of different ways. You can have a driver. You can take the bus. You can walk. You can bike. Reading is more like that. You can have a reader. You can explore the world with other cues. Meredith mentioned in an a post about how she had to learn to read comics and graphic novels. She had to learn to derive information from the panels without words. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe hooping is like reading if hooping is being used as a means to an end. I watched Between the Folds the other evening and Dr. Erik Demaine said that he really folding paper. He started folding paper because he really like the math and the paper folding was a means to accessing that math. But in folding paper he discovered that he really liked folding paper. So maybe hooping is a means to accessing the people at the beach or the park who you really like. So it isn&#39;t the hooping that is really the goal. It&#39;s the other people. Or maybe you are interested in orbits. Or maybe there is something else and it isn&#39;t the hooping that is really what you want. <br/>
<br/>
And maybe hooping is like reading in that if you aren&#39;t a minimum size or a minimum coordination hooping is unlikely to happen. Maybe there is a threshold of mental and physical skills that must be met for hooping to occur. Like with reading. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What if *reading* is the interest?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If reading is the interest. If it is the act of solving the puzzle that is the written word, than other puzzles might also appeal. There is no way to get someone to read before they are ready. But you can come up with alternatives, other things that are parallel, perhaps, to reading. If reading is in it and of itself the interest looking at why that is interesting. I have a fair few books about different writing systems because Simon was interested in hieroglyphics. He knew Braille before he could read and we wrote notes in Braille together. He liked code. And he didn&#39;t need to read to play around with that. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you teach anything? How you do you teach reading, for example? I don&#39;t know how I read. Even when I come upon a word I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve read it before I am aware of reading it. There is no point in the process where I am aware of the process. So how do you break down that process into a teachable course? Like anything else. I can show people what I do. I can read to them. I can make it easy to be around the written word. But I haven&#39;t the foggiest idea how to teach reading. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If my child asks for my help, even if that is &quot;mom, teach me to read please&quot;,  then I am not harming the partnership in any way, because I am invited to &quot;teach&quot; and as long as I don&#39;t take over the learning process and push it further or in another direction than what is asked for, then my child is still in charge of his learning project.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you are lying to your child. Or so I argue. You are telling them that you hold the key to doing their learning project. I&#39;m referencing Between the Folds again, because there were so many lovely moment of insight in that documentary about origami. Eric Joisel, a French origami artist whose work is amazing, said that when someone asks him to teach them how to make his origami they are asking him to give them 30 years of his life. 30 years it took him of exploring art and paper and ideas and living and moving through the world to be able to make figures like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sweet-station.com/blog/2008/12/eric-joisel/.">http://sweet-station.com/blog/2008/12/eric-joisel/.</a> Learning is not something that can be handed to you. It is something you do. It is incremental even if it looks like it is occurring in leaps and bounds. Learning to read is a process that varies by individual. But it is always a process that occurs within the individual in response to their environment. So, I suppose, if Simon or Linnaea had<br/>
 asked me to teach them to read I would have offered to read to them. I would have bought them more comics and more graphic novels and more pokemon cards and more video games and more of the things that they were already interested in, all of which had the written word as part of the experience. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Not everything has to be learnt by osmosis/autodidact. Imo, formal instruction has it&#39;s place in unschooling too, as long as it is wanted. I sometimes get the feeling that you think learning &quot;on your own&quot; is somehow superior to receiving instruction. Is this so? Or is it mainly with regards to reading you feel this way?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Formal instruction has it&#39;s place where the thing can be instructed. So, using Eric Joisel&#39;s statement about 30 years being asked for when someone asked him to teach them his origami, my guess is that he could certainly show them the basics. That he could give them a step into origami. He could talk about the specifics. But was derived from the discussion and where that discussion took the listener would have only a very tangential amount to do with Eric Joisel. <br/>
<br/>
I play ukulele. I bake bread. Both things are skills and in both of those arenas I could have sought out formal instruction. I didn&#39;t learn to play ukulele by osmosis. I didn&#39;t learn to bake bread by osmosis. I played ukulele. I baked bread. When I failed, as I did regularly, I would seek out information about how to not fail in the same way the next time. So I have books on baking bread and on playing ukulele. I have watched videos on baking bread and on playing ukulele. I have sought information that has incrementally improved my understanding and my skill. I&#39;m not terribly good at ukulele. I&#39;m fairly good at baking bread. But I&#39;ve been baking bread a lot longer than I&#39;ve been playing ukulele. Nobody taught me how to play ukulele or how to bake bread. I derived those skills by filling my environment with ukulele players and bread bakers via the amazing tool that is the internet. <br/>

If someone came to the list and asked, &quot;My child wants to fly planes how do I support that.&quot; I think it would be considered a legitimate interest and you all would offer up suggestions (visit with pilots, get a flight simulation game, tour planes, etc) as opposed to suggesting the focus be on other interests that are more attainable. <br/>

I don&#39;t know how to swim.  I can play in water.  I can bounce and bob a bit, but I can&#39;t go anywhere, and I panick if I lose my footing or if my head goes under water.   I&#39;ve taken swimming lessons, once as a kid and once in college.  It didn&#39;t take.  I am a non-swimmer.  A couple of individuals, certain THEY could teach me, have also failed.  One was my husband.  So I try to stay out of situations where swimming is important.<br/>
<br/>
My husband swims well, and knows how to dive.  (I would say &quot;can dive,&quot; but with two shoulder surgeries, he probably couldn&#39;t do it &quot;right&quot; anymore.)<br/>
<br/>
Of our three kids, the best swimmer is Holly.   She learned informally, and is brave and confident.  The boys can swim.  Marty is better than Kirby.  He has done it more than Kirby, and in different environments�pools, lake, &quot;hole&quot; (The Blue Hole in Santa Rosa, one of those bottomless little pools connected to caves) and ocean.<br/>
<br/>
We know it&#39;s not true that instruction creates the ability to swim, and that lack of instruction keeps one from swimming.  Even if our family were the only data points, we know it&#39;s not true.<br/>

<br/>
Nothing is learned by osmosis.  Even if it seems so, it&#39;s learned by observation, or observation/discussion/conversation.<br/>
Everything is learned inside the learner.  Every single thing of any sort that is learned is learned by and within the learner.  <br/>
<br/>
When a parent believes that formal instruction is or should be a part of unschooling, then the children will probably believe that (or be told that).  Karate is one thing that probably needs instruction.  Ballet.  Playing baseball is not, nor is riding a bicycle.  When someone is studying ballet or karate, though she&#39;s not unschooling in those subjects.  She&#39;s learning in a traditional, formal environment.  That would be the same whether she goes to school or not outside of those activities.  <br/>
<br/>
Attachment to the idea that formal learning doesn&#39;t hamper unschooling will (itself, the idea) hamper unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I stay near the edge of the pool.  In rivers or the ocean, I don&#39;t go past where I can stand up with my head safely out.   I can&#39;t claim to be swimming, even if I were to stay in water for many hours every day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877355796"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you teach anything? How you do you teach reading, for example? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> <br/>
For example, when you explain the mecanism of phonics, when you sound out words together you are &quot;teaching reading&quot;. You are passing out tips or tools that can help someone learn. That&#39;s teaching.<br/>
 <br/>
There is a negative association with the word teaching today (and rightly so) but it needn&#39;t be that way. When someone who knows more than me is explaining me stuff or showing me how to do something, teaching is going on. That doesn&#39;t belittle me or deprive me of my own learning experience and project. As long as I want the teaching, it is tool, a ressource for me, like so many other things. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But you are lying to your child. Or so I argue. You are telling them that you hold the key to doing their learning project.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> <br/>
I desagree. Why would I tell them (overtly or implied) I am &quot;holding the key&quot;? Why would they need to get that impression? If the instruction is wanted and is offered in a respectful and useful way like any other help , it is just that; a welcomed help.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Learning is not something that can be handed to you.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> <br/>
Sure. But tools and tips can be handed, aka teaching :)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Learning to read is a process that varies by individual.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> <br/>
Precisely. Some individuals will enjoy and benefit from teaching and others won&#39;t ;-)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody taught me how to play ukulele or how to bake bread.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> <br/>
But would it have been any less legitimate or valuable if someone had? If you had chosen to take ukulele lessons for instance, would your skill be any less fine just because someone had dispensed some kind of &quot;teaching&quot; to you? <br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s important is not how someone obtains a skill or knowledge, what&#39;s important is that the process and experience is owned by the individual and tailored to his needs and wishes.<br/>

Probably. But there is a third possibility, that formal instruction *can* be a part of unschooling. That is neither is or should. Should is probably a bad idea ;-)<br/>

This I don&#39;t understand. How?<br/>
 <br/>
We agree that noone can fully or exclusively *teach* someone something. Learning is interior, yes. But someone can definitly teach someone else SOMETHING and that something can be a smaller or larger part of the learning and of bigger or lesser importance to the learning process.<br/>

What would you say about Gymnastics? Our 6yo son wants to take Gymnastics classes. He&#39;s taken trial classes with 2 of the gyms in town, one he likes more than the other. It does seem friendly, not overly judgmental and not as rigid as the other one. We will be getting him his own trampoline soon, too. But I figured there are other things he can learn in a class and equipment we can&#39;t give him at home.<br/>
<br/>
I hear you on swim lessons. We tried a number of those, and my son still can&#39;t swim. He loves to be in the water, loves to hang on to my shoulders and swim with me, jump off the edge into my arms. But he also panics if his face goes under water. No amount of instruction is going to help him get over that. Maybe more experience, maybe as he gets older, or maybe not at all. Took me a while to realize that he didn&#39;t need a better teacher. He&#39;s just not ready!<br/>
<br/>
---Last weekend at the ALL Unschooling Symposium there was a panel of <br/>
moderators from this group, talking about the problem that sometimes new members complain that we won&#39;t just answer their questions directly.---<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post to the group (*loving* it, btw!!). I&#39;m a lifelong horse person, so I often relate what I know from studying them all my life. My most favorite horse gurus (some still alive, some dead) do the same thing. They almost never answer a question directly. They have an uncanny ability to look past what the person thinks they need to know, and what is really at the heart of the matter. Most people are only looking at the surface. They see the symptom as the thing to solve. But that&#39;s not what the good instructor will want to address - they want to go much deeper. I&#39;ve seen a lot of students quit the guru and find someone else that says what they want to hear. Or give them a cookie-cutter system to follow. Of course this only brings temporary relief, so they&#39;re back to square one in no time. But, hey, they didn&#39;t have to challenge themselves to really change. Sound familiar?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You suggested that when a kid says they want to learn to read we should<br/>
offer Hooked on Phonics.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, we offer to read for them, read to them, we create an environment<br/>
around them that includes a heck of a lot of reading. We play games, we<br/>
sing songs and say rhymes and play with words. We do all those things that<br/>
help kids be ready to read when the time is right for them. One of the<br/>
things I&#39;ve often suggested is to ask the child for a few words they&#39;d like<br/>
to be able to read. Write those words on cards and keep them. Sometimes<br/>
that helps a child feel better if they know they have a few words they<br/>
&quot;can&quot; read.<br/>
<br/>
But we don&#39;t tell a parent how they can get a kid reading now just because<br/>
a kid wants to read. Because the world if filled with print and if an<br/>
unschooling child is ready to read, they&#39;ll do it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I might offer books, reading programs liked hooked on phonics or the<br/>
&gt; phonics game, simple (subjective I know) books like early readers, closed<br/>
&gt; caption TV programs, labeling things around the house etc. These things as<br/>
&gt; well as continue to read aloud (if the child wanted - some might find this<br/>
&gt; frustrating).&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would never ever offer a reading program like hooked on phonics or the<br/>
phonics game because I&#39;ve seen the damage that those programs can do to a<br/>
kid who either isn&#39;t developmentally ready or for whom a phonics approach<br/>
is not right.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the child is ready, then a phonics program is unnecessary.  The world is<br/>
filled with phonics! If they are not ready, a phonics program can cause<br/>
real harm to their future learning ability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Pam: &gt;&gt;&gt;It doesn&#39;t matter how much a child wishes she could read - if<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s not developmentally ready then no amount of instruction will help&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kelly:&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t agree with this.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are certain brain developments that have to happen before reading<br/>
readiness exists - and they happen at different times for different<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and it can hurt.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I do strongly agree with this and that is why I&#39;m not advocating<br/>
&gt; instruction only options/offerings.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I think it can be equally hurtful to underestimate a child as it can be<br/>
&gt; to overestimate.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Underestimating meaning not giving them Hooked on Phonics? Unschoolers are<br/>
not underestimating the child. If the child could read, she&#39;d be reading.<br/>
<br/>
Do you also think the same thing about walking and talking?<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest daughter was 10 months old we went to Europe and stayed with<br/>
relatives. Her cousin was exactly 2 months older. He started walking while<br/>
we were there. My daughter wanted to walk SO much! She&#39;d crawl after him as<br/>
fast as she could and pull on him. She&#39;d cry when he got up and walked<br/>
away. She&#39;d try really hard to pull herself up and walk. But she couldn&#39;t<br/>
do it yet. Not ready. Should I have bought her some kind of lessons - some<br/>
how to walk equivalent of Hooked on Phonics?  There was no way to get her<br/>
walking before she was ready (physically) to walk, no matter how much she<br/>
wanted to walk. And when she was ready, she walked.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, we played and had fun and distracted her from her<br/>
unhappiness at not being physically able to walk.<br/>

Of course, if someone keeps explaining it and the kid eventually reaches<br/>

teaching it.<br/>

But if they keep explaining it and the child goes a year or two without<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nobody could have taught me to play ukulele. Teaching is a weird term. It implies that by getting the presentation just so someone else can&#39;t help but derive the knowledge that you are imparting. It implies that the burden of learning is on the teacher and not the learner. Even if I gone to someone seeking ukulele instruction, if I had put myself forward as a ukulele novice to some ukulele master they could only impart the knowledge that I was prepared to learn. No matter how well they taught, how skilful their ability to make something understandable, my learning is entirely dependent on my ability to engage with the material. They wouldn&#39;t have taught me anything. They would have facilitated my learning. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;For example, when you explain the mecanism of phonics, when you sound out words together you are &quot;teaching reading&quot;. You are passing out tips or tools that can help someone learn. That&#39;s teaching.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s talking about phonics. It&#39;s having a conversation. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/teaching/">http://sandradodd.com/teaching/</a> explains better than I can. But to teach is a verb without a clear action. Presumably teaching is only teaching in the presence of someone actually learning what you are teaching. So, if you talked about phonics to someone who didn&#39;t give a toss, or couldn&#39;t really understand what you were explaining, than are you teaching or are you just talking to yourself, mostly? <br/>
<br/>
How do you read? Again, I seem to be a sight reader. I only very occasional reach for phonetic pronunciations of words, if ever. And that&#39;s probably a secondary grab. I read by sight first. So if someone stressed phonics to me, I would be unlikely to grasp their meaning. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But you are lying to your child. Or so I argue. You are telling them that you hold the key to doing their learning project.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I desagree. Why would I tell them (overtly or implied) I am &quot;holding the key&quot;? Why would they need to get that impression? If the instruction is wanted and is offered in a respectful and useful way like any other help , it is just that; a welcomed help.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a child came to you and said &quot;teach me to read&quot; and you said okay you are implying that you are capable of teaching them to read. I don&#39;t believe you are. I believe that by suggesting that you can teach somebody how to read or how to play ukulele or how to bake bread you are owning their learning in a way that is a lie. You can say I can help. You can say I can show you what I do. But I don&#39;t think you can teach someone how to read. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra mentioned ballet and karate as things that need clear instruction. So, let&#39;s assume that is true. Let us imagine a ballet instructor teaching a class how to do the 5 basic ballet positions. They aren&#39;t really teaching it. They are demonstrating it. An instructor will probably even go around the classroom and put people into the right position if they are out of line. They will work to get the kinetic memory in place. But they will only be able to go as far as that person is interested in going. Or capable of going. Teaching only exists in the presence of learning. And sometimes learning isn&#39;t possible. The 5 basic ballet positions aren&#39;t possible if you can&#39;t walk. You can, possibly, do an adapted version. But if you are trying to teach a pre-walker how to do the third position, well, they aren&#39;t going to learn it. No matter how good a teacher you believe you are. No matter how well you know the third position and can express the third position to<br/>
 other people. <br/>
<br/>
Teach is an awkward idea. Formal instruction is different from teach. But, again, it only works when someone is interested in learning what is being instructed. And even then the instruction may not go out, may not be applied precisely as intended. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251995835">****If reading is the interest. If it is the act of solving the puzzle that<br/>
is the written word, than other puzzles might also appeal. There is no way<br/>
to get someone to read before they are ready. But you can come up with<br/>
alternatives, other things that are parallel, perhaps, to reading. ****<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Part of how I think of reading is like bike riding.  Someone can<br/>
theoretically know how to balance, pedal, steer, etc.  They can practice<br/>
each of those things independently, read books about how to do those things,<br/>
get instruction from others in how to do those things.  But there&#39;s a<br/>
certain magic that comes in putting it all together, which a person&#39;s body<br/>
and brain simply can&#39;t do until they - personally themselves - are ready.<br/>
Until suddenly it all clicks and they can make the magic their own and use<br/>
it to get that bike moving in a straight line down the road.  That part<br/>
can&#39;t be taught - it Needs to happen, and it Won&#39;t happen until it Can - no<br/>
matter how expert a teacher is standing on the sidelines shouting out<br/>
instructions.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Similar, reading.  You can surround a child with printed materials, read to<br/>
them, show them how phonics work by sounding out some words as you&#39;re<br/>
reading along in a book, point out words as you&#39;re reading that don&#39;t follow<br/>
the standard rules of phonics and therefore sound differently than one might<br/>
think when seeing them in writing, give them picture flashcards with printed<br/>
words on the flip-side of each one, play rhyming games, label everything in<br/>
your house. but they will not read until they - personally themselves - are<br/>
ready, and they make the magic their own.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Teaching reading interferes with the process and tries to get ahead of the<br/>
magic - it tries to break it down into little steps and it tries to<br/>
prescribe things like &quot;you should read little words like cat before you can<br/>
read big words like catastrophe&quot; and &quot;easy readers are for kids and the Wall<br/>
Street Journal isn&#39;t something your barely-reading-self is ready for yet&quot;<br/>
and such.  Teaching often makes something of a mess where there could have<br/>
been a beautiful experience.  It puts the Learner in a passive role, rather<br/>
than an active one.  I&#39;ll be forever grateful that my son had the experience<br/>
of learning to read without the interference of Teaching :-)<br/>

Of course, if you&#39;re in a school setting or doing some sort of school-at-home type of instruction. But this wouldn&#39;t be the way an unschooling family would use a phonics program. Certainly not the ones I know, or even myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-368691936"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Nobody could have taught me to play ukulele. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wrote that and as I was making Simon a corned beef sandwich I thought about it. Nobody could have taught me to play ukulele not simply because learning is an internal thing, but because I struggle to follow someone else&#39;s agenda. If I had gone in the first couple of months of my ukulele experience to a teacher to be shown how to learn I would have quit, almost undoubtedly, playing ukulele. I would have grown bored of the whole linear nature of the teaching and would have just fallen off. My relationship with the ukulele has jumped all over the place. It&#39;s been driven by different focuses. But it has been mine. If I let someone else tell me what I needed to learn in order to master the ukulele, if I had taken someone else&#39;s path to learning how to play, I would have walked away from the ukulele like I did with all the instruments I tried as a child. And that&#39;s probably a personal failing. I guess that&#39;s my conflict of interest in this discussion. But<br/>
 that perspective isn&#39;t mine alone: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://brennamcbroom.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/why-i-dropped-out-of-college/">http://brennamcbroom.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/why-i-dropped-out-of-college/</a> is Brenna McBroom&#39;s discussion about why she dropped out of college. There is something fundamentally right with defining your own relationship with learning. I think looking to other people for knowledge is absolutely part of learning. I think the problem arises when you let them decide things like phonics is the core understanding needed for learning to read or you must play classical music for 4 years before you can begin playing rock guitar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114495027">****I desagree with this. Learning to read isn&#39;t different from learning<br/>
anything else, in that a child can have a desire to acquire a specific<br/>
skill, and be willing to study or receive instruction to obtain that skill.<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t it be like that? ****<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a saying about &quot;when the student is ready, the teacher will appear.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what this is intended to mean vs. the way I hear it :-) but the<br/>
way I hear it is as something of an ironic statement, because it says to me<br/>
that no one can learn anything until they&#39;re ready - not reading, not<br/>
Japanese, not knitting - nothing.  But when a person is ready - personally,<br/>
within themselves - suddenly there are teachers everywhere.  Not only<br/>
teachers in terms of People Who Teach, but also teachers in terms of books,<br/>
experiences, videos, etc. - all the things and people and examples from<br/>
which one can learn, that were probably around before the learner was ready,<br/>
and that now suddenly have relevance and importance to the Process since<br/>
they have the information the learner is now ready to intake, process, and<br/>
use.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - clearly formal instruction IS sometimes part of an unschooling kid&#39;s<br/>
life. Sandra mentioned Kirby and Rosie (hers and mine) both doing Karate.<br/>
They&#39;ve both been martial arts instructors while being unschooling kids,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling concerned that some people are interpreting us to be saying<br/>
that parents should never explain things to kids or that kids should never<br/>
be allowed to get formal instruction. That&#39;s a misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
Learning happens in the learner is not a trite comment - it is an insight<br/>
that few people really have. Most people think teaching is needed for<br/>
certain things because they are taught in schools. A friend (quite<br/>
seriously) asked Rosie how she learned to tie her shoes if she didn&#39;t go to<br/>
school. Rosie thought that it was funny to think they&#39;d teach that in<br/>
schools and that her friend would think that teaching was necessary. But<br/>
that IS what people think these days. Nobody thought that when I was a<br/>
child in the 50&#39;s because kids didn&#39;t go to school until they were six and<br/>
mostly had already learned to tie their shoes. So now there are a zillion<br/>
preschool and kindergarten teachers out there who discuss different ways to<br/>
teach kids how to tie their shoes and take full credit for the kids<br/>
learning it.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is saying you shouldn&#39;t show a kid how to tie shoes. We&#39;re saying<br/>
that if the child doesn&#39;t have the small motor coordination yet, that you<br/>
can&#39;t get him to tie shoes because &quot;teaching&quot; isn&#39;t the same as learning.<br/>
 In the meantime, do other things - get pull-on shoes, velcro, go barefoot,<br/>
distract with something fun while you tie them.<br/>

Gymnastics uses a lot of specialized equipment. So a class is useful for that. (Though the floor stuff can be done in the yard. It&#39;s where the neighborhood kids and I learned. And learned pretty well! :-) <br/>

And get him to various playgrounds too so he can try out things on his own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109726568">I was &quot;taught&quot; to read in school. I did not learn to read till after I graduated. In school I was labeled dyslexic. I was terrified to read in class. The first book I read was what to expect when you expecting. I spent every night during my pregnancy reading that book. It was painful slow going. I think I thought I couldn&#39;t read because of all the anxiety I felt. I did not read to my older children. I was to self consous. My Mom and Mother in law read to them. Once I got the hang of it I read lots of books. I love reading now. We began homeschooling when my 3rd child was kindergarten age. I got a hooked on phonics set. I could not understand it at all. My son complained that it was way to boaring. He took the little books a read them all without instruction. I was amazed. My youngest son has had no instruction and he has learned to read. Thankfully none of my kids has the fear I was bogged down with for so long. My daughter has brain damage and she has a<br/>
 hard time with lots of things but even she does not seem bothered by not knowing something. She shouts out &quot;how do you spell this or that&quot;, and someone will just tell her. It does my spirit good to see her not being shamed for something she can&#39;t do yet.<br/>

Before the brain is ready -- if the child and parent believe instruction will help -- instruction will be frustrating and will potentially lead the child to believe there&#39;s something wrong with him because he still can&#39;t read.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787990085">I&#39;ve deleted three pending comments from this topic because they were going WAY the wrong direction.  They were promoting, defending and justifying using phonics programs and teaching. <br/>
<br/>
There are thousands of places online to discuss that, to read those recommendations, and to promote misunderstands of  unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the posts I removed had this.  I don&#39;t want the author to claim it or defend it.  It&#39;s a quote from the middle, and I&#39;m bringing it for the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;okay, I will teach you to read&quot;. I would say &quot;sure I&#39;ll<br/>
help you&quot; and to me that is equivalent to me doing some kind of teaching. I&#39;d<br/>
never suggest that I could entirely teach someone to do anything, but I can<br/>
certainly teach them (show, tell etc) a part of something, the basics of<br/>
something, or some specifics of something - and that wouldn&#39;t be owning their<br/>
learning at all. That would be teaching them what I know and let them go from<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;d agree that there is a problem with the words and the meaning of the words. I<br/>
have read Sandra&#39;s page and I agree totally with the importance of getting<br/>
detached from the idea of &quot;teaching&quot; as it is commonly understood.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Until someone understands that learning can happen without teaching, unschooling cannot begin to work.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m unwilling to spend my volunteer time helping people *not* understand unschooling.<br/>
I am unwilling to provide and maintain this discussion group for people to justify things that will not help anyone move nearer to understanding how unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;d agree that there is a problem with the words and the meaning of the words. I<br/>
have read Sandra&#39;s page -=-<br/>
<br/>
My page?  The page on Teaching vs. Learning, maybe?   That&#39;s ten pages long with links to other pages, with links to others...<br/>
<br/>
The reading section would print out to 51 pages.  There are stories of many kids learning to read, and the things that helped them, and the dozens of ways they were helped without anyone &quot;teaching&quot; them anything.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important.  <br/>
<br/>
Without recovering from the desire to teach and the belief that it&#39;s crucial, or even helpful, unschooling will not flourish.  It can&#39;t become the kind of unschooling this discussion was created to promote.  <br/>

Discussion here by people who haven&#39;t successfully had a child learn to read naturally isn&#39;t as useful as ideas from the many here whose children have unschooled wholly and richly for many years.<br/>

One of the posts I let through, I would ordinarily have blocked.  When I saw that the author joined on December 20, I thought it was a full year ago, but it was less than two weeks ago.  I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t read more carefully.<br/>
