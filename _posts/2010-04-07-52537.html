<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342036120">Can I share one baby step  in mindful parenting for me - start saying YES.<br/>
Somehow the &quot;no&quot; habit has become a natural response - yuk!<br/>
<br/>
I made a big sign for myself on the kitchen wall today with YES written on it.  I made several acrostics (sp?) of yes, branching out from the word<br/>
You&#39;ll Excell - Seriously<br/>
Your Example Shines<br/>
Yippiee Exciting Stuff<br/>
You&#39;ll Eliminate Sulking<br/>
You&#39;re Earning a Smile<br/>
 etc.......<br/>
<br/>
This led to a really great discussion about accrostics (spelling!?) and the kids  making up funny ones of their names etc<br/>
<br/>
I think I can, I think I can, I think i can..........<br/>
