<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907912286">When I began posting to this list (all of two weeks ago), I thought I knew <br/>
what &quot;unschooling&quot; was.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought that it was &quot;homeschooling without a lesson plan.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not what it is.  I still had an &quot;agenda.&quot;  I still knew what I wanted <br/>
my children to learn, and ideas about how I wanted them to learn it.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought that I was &quot;unschooling&quot; because I did not use store-bought <br/>
curricula, or &quot;lesson plans,&quot; or a structured schedule.<br/>
<br/>
I was not &quot;unschooling.&quot;  (Nor am I &quot;unschooling&quot; at this point in time <br/>
either, I don&#39;t think.)  But I am exploring unschooling and the concepts <br/>
underlying unschooling, and  I believe that unschooling can and does work.<br/>
<br/>
I almost unsubscribed from the list as a result of perceived personal <br/>
&quot;attacks&quot; on myself.  <br/>
<br/>
I am glad that I did not.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad that I &quot;hung in&quot; there.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that the more I understand of unschooling, the more I understand <br/>
the reason that tempers flare on this list.  On the one hand, this list <br/>
comprises many devout, dedicated, and longtime unschoolers.  Those <br/>
individuals belonging to that &quot;group&quot; have the benefit of experience, and, I <br/>
think, are being supportive when they call attention to the use of <br/>
&quot;schoolish&quot; words, like &quot;lessons,&quot; &quot;required reading,&quot; or other such <br/>
buzzwords.  Orwell, I think, said &quot;Who controls language, controls thought.&quot;  <br/>
Words are key in creating perception and understanding.  Only when these <br/>
buzzwords were called to my attention (as a result of my own prior posts) did <br/>
it dawn on me that what I thought was unschooling was not, in fact, <br/>
unschooling.  It was &quot;homeschooling without a lesson plan.&quot;  I was properly <br/>
labeled (yuck) an &quot;eclectic homeschooler.&quot;  And, though I am not happy to be <br/>
labeled, I can think of worse labels than that!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we have people who approach this list with their own <br/>
perception of what unschooling is, and woe unto them if they use the <br/>
buzzwords and do not understand that the acrimony directed at the use of the <br/>
buzzwords is NOT directed at the user of the buzzwords.  <br/>
<br/>
We are all rebellious here.  Were we not, we would be conforming with the <br/>
societal standards of education and shooing our children off to public school <br/>
five days a week.  We all are outspoken.  We all are intelligent.  We all are <br/>
open-minded.<br/>
<br/>
And we all want to be right.  (Okay, I&#39;m speaking only for myself here, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think I am so very different from anyone else -- I mean, does anyone <br/>
really WANT to be wrong?!)<br/>
<br/>
In any event, it is truly understandable that the newbies&#39; diction elicits <br/>
some corrective diction from the oldies, which, in turn, gives rise to <br/>
defensiveness, hostility, and impassioned diction from all.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t happen to mind any of it anymore.  Personally, I think that observing <br/>
the arguments, or debates, or discussions, among the newbies, the oldies, and <br/>
the in-betweenies is, in fact, contributing to my understanding of <br/>
unschooling, the language of unschooling, and the zealous manner in which <br/>
unschooling proponents will defend both.<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, will miss the dialogue when (or if) it is moderated out.<br/>
