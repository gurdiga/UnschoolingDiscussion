&gt; I know I&#39;ll be asking you a lot of questions.  I think of Unschooling as a<br/>
&gt; choice in lifestyle and not how people school.  I am very interested in how<br/>
&gt; families live who make a choice to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IMHO, this is an extremely sensible interest. :) I think it&#39;s at least a lot<br/>
harder, if not impossible, for unschooling to actually happen in a family<br/>
with rigid bedtimes, or exact meal requirements, or timed television<br/>
viewing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Once you dangle freedom in one area at them, the little opportunists start<br/>
to think it&#39;s their life and not ours! Shocking. ;)<br/>
