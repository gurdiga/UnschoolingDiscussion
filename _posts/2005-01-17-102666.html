<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644143380">My almost-14-yr old unschooling (this is our 3rd year) daughter has become more and more bored, and more and more lonely, over the past year. This seems to be a result of a few different things (getting older, outgrowing her little (11yrs) sister, growing apart from the friends she had from her school years, her older brother going away to school, reaching a new level of maturity and depth of thought, interest in boys....) I have offered some ideas (getting a job, joining clubs, starting clubs, looking for friends online, starting projects, etc) but so far none of my suggestions have really appealed to her. I am wondering if this is a typical &quot;entering adolescence&quot; phase that many unschoolers go through.  Here she has arrived at an age where peers are so important, yet for us it seems that true peers (other unschooling independent and powerful young people) are so very difficult to find. We don&#39;t know any other unschoolers (in person) at all. In past years this wasn&#39;t a problem, the kids had each other and their (school) friends in the neighborhood, but it is starting to feel like a very lonely life (esp for her).  Funds are severly limited, so signing up for classes is a very big stretch for us.<br/>
I have posted some queries on my local unschooling lists, and have some more ideas to follow up on. In the meantime, I would love to hear if anyone has had similar issues with their own children, and how you might have dealt with it.  Perhaps the hardest part for me is the fear of failing my children, the voices of inadequacy and doubt. I&#39;d appreciate any suggestions or words of encouragement you may have to offer.<br/>
<br/>
thanks, amy (from philadelphia)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I have offered some ideas (getting a job, joining clubs, starting clubs, <br/>
looking for friends online, starting projects, etc) but so far none of my <br/>
suggestions have really appealed to her.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Classes are cheaper than medical treatment or psychotherapy.<br/>
If it seems truly necessary for her to get out and meet people, you might <br/>
just need to spring for those class fees.<br/>
<br/>
If you were using a homeschooling curriculum, that would cost a few hundred <br/>
dollars a year.  If she were going to high school, you KNOW there there would <br/>
be school-required expenses (fees and $5 here and $20 there) PLUS the cost of <br/>
supplies and cool clothes and special shoes and whatever all else.   So don&#39;t <br/>
do unschooling so cheap that you fail to fulfill your obligation.  Some things <br/>
cost money.<br/>
<br/>
But there are clubs that don&#39;t cost money.<br/>
<br/>
What you might need to do is go with her.  Don&#39;t send her off to join a <br/>
quilting group or a gardening club.  Find a hiking club or history society or <br/>
geology club that you both could enjoy and maybe she&#39;ll love it and be willing to <br/>
go to some things without you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  Philadelphia.  Scratch that geology club.  I&#39;m in a desert/mountain <br/>
neighborhood where the rocks stick out.<br/>
<br/>
Try to find a way to be where other people are.  Maybe babysit (not just her, <br/>
but both of you, at your house, maybe), and she might meet other families, at <br/>
least, like that, and have things to keep her occupied and get her enough <br/>
money to get out and do something a little more independently.  <br/>
<br/>
How is she musically?  Are there choirs she could join?  Folksinging <br/>
get-togethers?<br/>
<br/>
What about art?  Are there art clubs?<br/>
<br/>
Could she volunteer to help at a museum or zoo or some such?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All three of my girls went through very very difficult times socially <br/>
at exactly that age. (Number 3 is there right now - she turns 14 in a <br/>
couple of weeks and just pulled out of a year and a half of miserable <br/>
sadness over being rejected by former friends.) I don&#39;t know what that <br/>
means - but they all three had a very hard time with friends or lack of <br/>
friends - either way - right at that age.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to encourage her to try out some different activities <br/>
- don&#39;t ask her to make a commitment, but just to try something for a <br/>
couple of weeks - even if nothing appeals to her - ask her to give a <br/>
try to the thing which is the least unappealing. I admit that I coaxed <br/>
and cajoled my daughter into trying karate and I got lucky - she loves <br/>
it and has made some good friends there and it gives her a place to be <br/>
with other kids of all ages. When my oldest was 13, almost 14, I got <br/>
her involved in a singing group - again - it took some coaxing and a <br/>
bit of pushing on my part - but I knew that she needed something like <br/>
that - and it was wonderful for her. So - that&#39;s my best suggestion - <br/>
well that and have a GOOD time together - it is okay for her to hang <br/>
out with you and her siblings - but if she&#39;s not having a good time, <br/>
then maybe you can find ways to relate to each other that work better <br/>
for her - slightly more adult ways. Take up some hobbies together - <br/>
take some classes together - exercise together - join a book club - <br/>
whatever.<br/>

 <br/>
I think you&#39;re dead-on. I also think it&#39;s not abnormal. I think time and  <br/>
sleep will take care of a lot of it. I think hooking her up with other  <br/>
unschoolring teens would be extremely helpful.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
I think so---in many cases.  But I think it can be a  typical &quot;entering <br/>
adolescence&quot; phase that many CHILDREN go through! Not  just unschoolers. Some do; <br/>
some don&#39;t. I would keep offering, but not in an  exasperated, nagging way. <br/>
Travel is good. Movies are cheaper! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

person) at all.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
This is where the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference <br/>
(_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnconference.org/_">http://liveandlearnconference.org/_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnconference.org/)">http://liveandlearnconference.org/)</a> )  could come in! You <br/>
might be surprised how many unschoolers *are* in your  area----and you might <br/>
meet them for the first time IN St Louis! It&#39;s  happened before! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

But volunteering/bartering *can* be worked out! Think OUTside the  box!<br/>

 <br/>
Cameron went through this---the deschooling period was filled with days of  <br/>
*nothing* and his thoughts of inadequacies. Partly it was the recent departure  <br/>
from school. Partly chatter from friends about how he would amount to nothing <br/>
by  dropping out of school. Partly---well, it&#39;s the age: they can be <br/>
restless, yet  unable to make decisions. Needing friends, but not wanting to make the  <br/>
effort---thinking that everyone *else* has enough friends. Wanting to do  <br/>
something, yet afraid to fail or not live up to their expectations.<br/>
 <br/>
Time. Patience. Trust. Respect. Same ol&#39; same ol&#39;! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
I would keep offering (gently) and get busy yourself with some new project  <br/>
(One that may be harder for you than you&#39;d thought may give her hope! If she  <br/>
sees you struggle a bit,....). Rent movies and watch them with her. Play upbeat <br/>
 music--old and new. Go out to ethnic restaurants---or make your own with <br/>
recipes  from library cookbooks.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d be open enough to the possibility of depression too--just in  case.<br/>
 <br/>
Keeping yourself open to whatever she&#39;d like to talk about too--- Sandra&#39;s  <br/>
Leaning on a Truck would be some god reading...<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!<br/>

It&#39;s about side-by-side play, pretty much.  Kind of about living a <br/>
two-for-one life.  <br/>
No, it&#39;s about talking and sharing without pressure, and of being togetherd <br/>
in a heavy-on-the-BEing way, rather than the &quot;together in same place, checklist <br/>
that, did it&quot; way.<br/>
