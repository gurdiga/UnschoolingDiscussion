The Genetically Engineered Food Right to Know Act (HR 3377 and S 2080) are<br/>
currently before Congress.  More information on these can be found at<br/>

I&#39;ve included a suggested letter to send to your Senators and Congressmen.<br/>
<br/>

If Ignorance Is Bliss Why Aren&#39;t More People Happy?<br/>
<br/>
Dear Representative/Senator:<br/>
<br/>
I am very concerned that I am eating genetically engineered foods without<br/>
being told that fact.  I am writing to request that you co-sponsor (H.R.<br/>
3377 or S. 2080), the Genetically Engineered Food Right to Know Act.  This<br/>
legislation will ensure the right of Americans to know whether the foods we<br/>
purchase have been genetically altered in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Public opinion polls show the vast majority of Americans want these foods<br/>
labeled.  (81% in a January 11, 1999, Time magazine poll)  Yet the FDA is<br/>
allowing genetically engineered foods to come to market unlabeled arguing<br/>
these foods are no different than those produced by typical hyridization. <br/>
But studies show crops modified by genetic engineering may contain<br/>
increased levels of natural toxins and lower levels of valuable nutrients.<br/>
<br/>
The FDA states that if a genetically engineered food contains a known<br/>
allergen it must be labeled.  But what about the unknown allergens taht may<br/>
be created int hese experiemental foods?  Genetically engineered crops<br/>
often contain proteins that have never before been consumed by humans as<br/>
food.  Further, there are serious questions about the environmental safety<br/>
of these crops.  And many people have moral and religious concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Food manufacturers are selling potatoes and corn that have been genetically<br/>
engineered to contain the Bt toxin (Bacillus thuringiensis).  The Bt toxin<br/>
stays in the cell structure of the plants and is deadly enough to kill<br/>
insects.  We are being told that these foods are safe for human<br/>
consumption, but we have heard that before about DDT, EDB and many other<br/>
pesticides later shown to be cancer-causing.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want to eat genetically engineered foods that contain the Bt<br/>
toxin.  Nor do I want to eat &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; soybeans or other future<br/>
products such as tomatoes that contain the gene from a fish!  But without<br/>
labeling, I cannot avoid it.  So I am asking you to become a co-sponsor of<br/>
(H.R. 3377 or S. 2080), the Genetically Engineered Food Right to Know Act,<br/>
which will require the labeling of all genetically engineered foods. <br/>
Similar labeling legislation has already been passed in Europe, Australia<br/>
and Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Please write back to me and let me know if you intend to support this<br/>
important legislation.  Your decision in this matter is likely to influence<br/>
my vote in the November 2000 election.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
