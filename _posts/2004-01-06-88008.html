Ummm...not really .  <br/>
Rue, <br/>
I love your creative ideas. We came up with another one. He could even write <br/>
the words &quot;thank you&quot; with legos and K&#39;nex ( his favorites) , take a picture, <br/>
scan it, print it...and just write Love Chad. <br/>
<br/>
And as Emma mentioned, about the dread of thank you notes while she was <br/>
growing up, it brought back memories for me too. The drugery!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys! I LOVE this list!<br/>
<br/>
And from an unschooler&#39;s viewpoint..I guess I shouldn&#39;t &quot;worry&quot; about <br/>
spelling ...he&#39;ll spell when he needs... and wants to.  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915410682">And while I was thinking along the line of ...neat things kids can do other than handwrite thank you notes--in   poured. the ideas.....of course.<br/>
What works for us sometimes, is casually making a few suggestions  and asking if they had any neat ideas....I also try to get in how  the person who sent the gift  might have done it..thinking what  the child was like?  how the child might like  the shopping around to spend the gift certificate-maybe how what they buy might reflect what the giver likes -or wanted as a child- or?<br/>
<br/>
What  the girls usually do these days is pick out one of  the e-mail cards available on line;-all kid sites have them as well as dedicated sites...they use these a Lot. <br/>
Most of the writing they do is this way right now  as they play and the handwriting-which I almost never actually &quot;see&quot; is in the context of asking to spell words ...this morning  they were creating secret  &quot;vaults&quot; with passwords and codes for some cache of money.<br/>
This actually arose because of one of their friends absconding with about $30 of Karas money this summer from the playroom. I am pretty sure it was their cousin of the same age. the girls  used to treat their money-piggy banks etc. as &quot;toys&quot; and had no idea someone might take it. They just thought it was misplaced until fall-I just mentioned that maybe money should have a special place just for themselves and they might just use the change jar for games.<br/>
