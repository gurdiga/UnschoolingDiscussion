                -- Views from the world of learning in Japan --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the 30 March 2000 edition of KnoK (pronounced &quot;knock&quot;) NEWS, <br/>
an informal and periodic bulletin concerning issues of learning in Japan. <br/>
It is brought to you by the Covert family -- Kazumi, Kenya and Brian -- a <br/>
multicultural, homelearning family in Osaka, Japan.<br/>
<br/>
KnoK stands for *Kodomo no Kokoro*, meaning &quot;Heart of a Child&quot; in <br/>
Japanese. It is our belief that the heart of any child is indeed at the <br/>
center of true learning, wherever and however such learning may take <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[EDITOR&#39;S WELCOME: Greetings all, in these final days of March!  In this <br/>
edition of KnoK NEWS, we get down to some basics of homelearning in the <br/>
Land of the Rising Sun: What is learning at home like in Japan? What kind <br/>
of people are doing it? Why? And how many?<br/>
<br/>
We hope to answer a few of these kinds of questions by way of a two-part <br/>
Q & A list compiled by a Japanese homelearning parent, Tomiko Kugai. The <br/>
beginning portion of this list was originally compiled in 1997 by Ms. <br/>
Kugai to introduce the homelearning environment to the slowly (but <br/>
steadily) rising number of Japanese families seeking alternatives to <br/>
school. With Ms. Kugai&#39;s cooperation, KnoK NEWS has recently expanded, <br/>
updated and translated that original Japanese Q & A list into English so <br/>
that families in and out of Japan may get a clearer idea of what&#39;s <br/>
happening -- and what&#39;s at stake -- in the world of Japanese homelearning <br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Kugai, along with her partner, Mr. Junichi Ono, and their 14-year-old <br/>
daughter, Momo, have been doing homelearning for more than six years now. <br/>
Ms. Kugai also heads a support group called &quot;Home Schooling Network - <br/>
Himeji&quot; based in the city of Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, western Japan. Her <br/>
family and homelearning activities have been reported on Japanese TV, as <br/>
well as in Japanese newspaper and magazine articles -- most recently in <br/>
the Kyoto Shimbun, a major metropolitan daily newspaper in the city of <br/>
Kyoto, which has carried a few articles over just the past week or so <br/>
that are supportive in tone of home-based learning in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are interested, Ms. Kugai and her &quot;HSN Himeji&quot; support <br/>
group have a homepage up (in Japanese) at the following URL:<br/>

<br/>
And now a mention about the Q & A&#39;s to follow: In Part 1, we start out by <br/>
introducing the &quot;basic&quot; questions Japanese families seem to be asking <br/>
about homelearning in general (sound familiar?), then we slide into <br/>
questions that are more specific to current conditions here in Japan. We <br/>
do hope to take a more comprehensive look at legal and other related <br/>
issues in Japan in the future. For now, however, we offer this Q & A <br/>
overview in the spirit of honest, open information-exchange and <br/>
networking. As always, we welcome any thoughts you have about this. Feel <br/>
free to pass it around. --BC]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                  *  Q & A ON HOMESCHOOLING IN JAPAN -- Part 1  *<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q-1: WHAT EXACTLY IS HOMESCHOOLING?<br/>
<br/>
A-1: It is a way of &quot;shared upbringing&quot; in which the home, libraries, <br/>
museums, parks and so forth are used as learning resources for children <br/>
along with the support of grownups -- without the children attending <br/>
school. In Europe and the United States, the number of households <br/>
choosing this path as a way to meet the requirements for compulsory <br/>
education, both legally and socially, are increasing.<br/>
<br/>
Q-2: HOW DO YOU DO HOMESCHOOLING?<br/>
<br/>
A-2: There are various ways, depending on the household, but <br/>
homeschooling methods can generally be put into two categories: (1) <br/>
School at home, in which a set of educational materials and curriculum is <br/>
prepared in advance by grownups, and (2) Unschooling, which places <br/>
importance on children&#39;s hobbies or interests as a way to &quot;learn by <br/>
living.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Correspondence courses are also sometimes used, but even then at the <br/>
child&#39;s own pace. This is homeschooling&#39;s most favorable point. In <br/>
homeschooling, first and foremost, &quot;The child plays the leading role.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Q-3: DON&#39;T PARENTS NEED TO HAVE SOME SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE IN A SUBJECT? <br/>
ALSO, WE DON&#39;T HAVE ANY EDUCATIONAL EQUIPMENT AT HOME.<br/>
<br/>
A-3: Parents don&#39;t need any &quot;specialized&quot; knowledge. While parents <br/>
certainly do have a strong influence on their children, parents aren&#39;t <br/>
the only ones children learn from. It is enough that parents help their <br/>
children search for information, and broaden their experiences and human <br/>
relationships. That is to say, creating an environment is a vital role <br/>
for parents. Rather than parents leading the lessons, it is more <br/>
important that a shared learning take place, while moving forward in the <br/>
spirit of partnership.<br/>
<br/>
And no particular educational equipment is necessary. A kitchen in the <br/>
home serves sufficiently as a fun-filled laboratory. Beyond that, you can <br/>
use public facilities and any resources that other households may have <br/>
for the offering.          <br/>
<br/>
Q-4: DOESN&#39;T HOMESCHOOLING ISOLATE CHILDREN? AND WHAT ABOUT SOCIALIZATION?<br/>
<br/>
A-4: In Japan at present, the reality is that conditions exist under <br/>
which children may be isolated and face social pressure -- by a society <br/>
that largely does not recognize homeschooling and accepts school as the <br/>
only way. Therefore, homeschooling groups have been created at the local <br/>
levels, and by developing these networks they can exchange information <br/>
with homeschoolers from other areas, thus helping to avoid isolation.<br/>
<br/>
Through the activities of such groups and networks, a variety of <br/>
acquaintances and friends may be made; this is sufficient, socially <br/>
speaking, for bringing up children. Children who homeschool are not <br/>
forced, as they are in school, to compete against others of their age <br/>
group; this, in turn, reduces social exclusion and aggressiveness on <br/>
their part.        <br/>
<br/>
Q-5: WHAT&#39;S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOMESCHOOLING, AND *FU-TOKO* (AVOIDING <br/>
SCHOOL) OR *TOKO-KYOHI* (REFUSING SCHOOL)?<br/>
[The latter term, *toko-kyohi*, is usually associated with symptoms of <br/>
neuroses among schoolchildren. --Editor]<br/>
<br/>
A-5: While there are many cases of families choosing homeschooling <br/>
through *fu-toko* or *toko-kyohi*, such conditions of &quot;not going to <br/>
school&quot; are definitely NOT representative of homeschooling. We cannot <br/>
call it homeschooling if both children and parents oppose school in the <br/>
meantime but believe they must return to it eventually, as with *fu-toko* <br/>
or *toko-kyohi*. When the idea of school is completely put aside and <br/>
learning proceeds in the home for the family&#39;s own constructive reasons <br/>
-- and when children and parents choose this way as a separate form of <br/>
alternative education in and of itself -- then we can call it <br/>
homeschooling.       <br/>
<br/>
Q-6: ISN&#39;T THERE AN OBLIGATION FOR CHILDREN TO GO TO SCHOOL?<br/>
<br/>
A-6: No, there is not. Under the Constitution of Japan, children have the <br/>
&quot;right to receive an education&quot; [*kyoiku o ukeru kenri*], and people are <br/>
&quot;obliged to have&quot; [*hosho-suru gimu*] children receive an education. If a <br/>
child does not suit a school or if a child dislikes going to school, <br/>
she/he still has the right to an education, even if it is outside of <br/>
school. But this is made especially hard for large numbers of children <br/>
and parents because no systematic procedures are in place at the <br/>
administrative levels in Japan to deal with such situations.<br/>
<br/>
It becomes necessary, then, to stand up for the right &quot;not to go to <br/>
school&quot; -- and for society to recognize that right. Citizens groups in <br/>
Japan are already undertaking these very types of activities, and <br/>
homeschooling support groups are springing up in many areas.         <br/>
<br/>
[Editor&#39;s Note: The part of the Japanese Constitution pertaining to <br/>
education, Article 26, in two paragraphs, reads in its entirety as <br/>
follows: &quot;All people shall have the right to receive an equal education <br/>
correspondent to their ability, as provided for by law.  2. All people <br/>
shall be obligated to have all boys and girls under their protection <br/>
receive ordinary education as provided for by law. Such compulsory <br/>
education shall be free.&quot;]<br/>
<br/>
Q-7: BUT ISN&#39;T HOMESCHOOLING ILLEGAL IN JAPAN? DON&#39;T PEOPLE GET <br/>
PROSECUTED OR GO TO JAIL IF THEY HOMESCHOOL IN JAPAN?<br/>
<br/>
A-7: Under Japan&#39;s compulsory education system, an ordinary education of <br/>
nine years is guaranteed for children between the ages of six and 15. <br/>
Parents or guardians do have an obligation under the School Education Law <br/>
[*Gakko Kyoiku-Ho*] in Japan to see that their children attend school. <br/>
But there is no provision of the law directed at children themselves, <br/>
stating that children must attend a school to get an education. In other <br/>
words, the School Education Law addresses parental responsibility only, <br/>
and not a child&#39;s own decision about where to learn. Therefore, if a <br/>
child does not fit in with a school or if a child does not like attending <br/>
school, other ways of learning outside of school can be done. So, <br/>
homeschooling is DEFINITELY NOT illegal in Japan. And people in Japan are <br/>
not being prosecuted or going to jail because of their decision to <br/>
homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
[Editor&#39;s Note: While it is a fact that there is no law in Japan that <br/>
concretely provides *for* home-based learning, it is also a fact that <br/>
there is no provision under law at present that expressly prohibits it. <br/>
For those families in Japan who do pursue homelearning as an alternative <br/>
to school, the Ministry of Education generally does not stand in their <br/>
way. At this stage, the ministry neither discourages nor encourages <br/>
homelearning in Japan.]<br/>
<br/>
Even so, there are lots of people in society who believe that children <br/>
are required to attend school and many cases where boards of education <br/>
possess no understanding of what homeschooling is about. Thus we still <br/>
see cases, depending on the local area or district, of interference by <br/>
boards of education in trying to make children go to school. <br/>
<br/>
Q-8: IF WE CHOOSE TO DO HOMESCHOOLING, WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP SHOULD <br/>
WE HAVE WITH SCHOOL?<br/>
<br/>
A-8: For now, your child&#39;s *gaku-seki* [school register] will remain at <br/>
the school. You should nevertheless clearly inform the principal and <br/>
teacher in charge that: (1) You will assume the responsibility of <br/>
homeschooling in placing priority on your child&#39;s own wishes, and (2) You <br/>
do not want their excessive interference in this matter. It is also <br/>
important for you to add that if your child does happen to *want* to <br/>
return to school later on, you&#39;ll expect their official cooperation then <br/>
too.           <br/>
<br/>
Q-9: ABOUT HOW MANY HOMESCHOOLERS ARE THERE IN JAPAN?<br/>
<br/>
A-9: More than 120,000 children are reportedly avoiding school or <br/>
refusing school at the primary and middle school levels, according to <br/>
research by the Ministry of Education. It is hard to say how many of <br/>
these are homeschoolers, however, since the research is not divided into <br/>
cases of those actively learning outside of school versus otherwise. No <br/>
research anywhere has yet been done on how many homeschoolers are in <br/>
Japan, so the exact numbers are unknown. [Unofficial estimates place the <br/>
number of homeschooled children in Japan at around 2,000 to 3,000 <br/>
nationwide. --Editor]  In any case, the numbers of households that are <br/>
choosing homeschooling due to school not suiting their children are <br/>
slowly increasing.  <br/>
<br/>
Q-10: WHAT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FACING HOMESCHOOLERS IN JAPAN, AS A <br/>
WHOLE?<br/>
<br/>
A-10: The biggest problem is that homeschooling remains unknown by many <br/>
people in this country. Also, as homeschoolers in Japan are still few in <br/>
number, they may be isolated and find it hard to discover new friends, <br/>
even if they do create support groups. In cases when children do stay at <br/>
home specifically to avoid or refuse school, this is usually with the <br/>
idea that their parents will be sending them back to school again <br/>
eventually. Few parents are inclined to pursue learning at home.      <br/>
<br/>
Q-11: AMONG THOSE FAMILIES IN JAPAN THAT ARE CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVES, <br/>
WHY ARE MORE AND MORE TURNING TO HOMESCHOOLING?<br/>
<br/>
A-11: For one thing, confidence in schools is beginning to falter because <br/>
of physical punishment inflicted on students by teachers, bullying among <br/>
children themselves, and a host of other problems. Japanese education is <br/>
carried out in an environment where the concept of &quot;doing something <br/>
together&quot; is strong, and where there is a strong tendency to reject <br/>
differences rather than acknowledge them. At the same time, though, there <br/>
are also many parents who criticize such education and, in fact, many <br/>
children who are starting to stand up and say &quot;NO!&quot; to school.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, resources outside of school (such as libraries, art galleries <br/>
and museums) have become more abundant. It is also easier to get <br/>
information through television, the Internet and whatnot. Lots of <br/>
teaching materials are being published these days. Such conditions make <br/>
it easier to do homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This, of course, speaks to the motivations of those households that have <br/>
actually *chosen* to do homeschooling. As mentioned before, while the <br/>
numbers of households that choose homeschooling are known to be rising in <br/>
Japan, they still are relatively few in this country. <br/>
