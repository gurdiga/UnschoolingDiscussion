<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523858038">Hi<br/>
   I have a search about to see if I could find any unschooling <br/>
articles that might help with my problem. My dd aged 9 has a weight <br/>
problem in that she is very overweight. She is not a junk food kid, <br/>
although she likes it, she also likes all her veggies etc<br/>
<br/>
I find I am unable to let go my control over food. I&#39;m afraid if I <br/>
do my dd will balloon to a vast size.  She&#39;s really big already. <br/>
It&#39;s not what she eats but how much. Even when she was a baby and <br/>
breastfeeding (she was v v long term breastfed) she would suckle til <br/>
she was sick! It was overflow. She just doesn&#39;t  seem to know how <br/>
much is enough. She will eat adult portions and then some more food.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not made in to a huge deal but I do give her smaller portions <br/>
than us (sometimes she complains cos it&#39;s not fair).  I didn&#39;t <br/>
always do this and she would eat a whole adult sized meal, pudding <br/>
and then want fruit too. I also say if she is hungry she can have <br/>
unlimited fruit or other filling but low calorie food. Her meals are <br/>
still big!<br/>
<br/>
She is very insistent that we have breakfast, lunch, dinner and <br/>
supper. If say we get up late she insists she has breakfast then <br/>
lunch immediately after as it is lunch &#39;time&#39;. For her there is a <br/>
time for every meal, she likes knowing when things will be so if the <br/>
time is a bit off because we got up late or had dinner late she ends <br/>
up having 2 meals run together. For her it seems to be a cause of <br/>
anxiety that she might have 3 meals instead of 4.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure how to tackle it. I want to not enforce food <br/>
rules but I am also very concerned about her weight. Diabetes type 2 <br/>
runs very strongly in my family so carrying excess weight is a <br/>
worry. She does have very poor bodily co-ordination as well so <br/>
excess weight makes movement more difficult for her. <br/>
<br/>
She went on holiday with my mum and came back 6 pounds heavier this <br/>
year. She goes to her dads every weekend, last year she put 7lbs on <br/>
when on holiday with him and then more weight on holiday with my <br/>
mum. Her dad seems to have managed to stop putting weight on her but <br/>
my mum hasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I do talk to dd about weight and health, emphasis on the health. I <br/>
don&#39;t talk to her very often as I don&#39;t want to make it in to a huge <br/>
issue. I think her older sister (aged 19) and my mum might have a go <br/>
at her about it though.  She doesn&#39;t actually like being heavy. I <br/>
have said that she doesn&#39;t have to lose weight as she is a kid and <br/>
growing and to be a healthier weight she just has to stay the weight <br/>
she is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m doing this wrong. My older dd was a normal weight until <br/>
she left home and has now ballooned massively. I think it&#39;s my fault <br/>
as she wouldn&#39;t eat a healthy diet at all (still won&#39;t) and I made <br/>
it an issue and so did my mum as she gave her all junk food and I <br/>
said it was bad so she now thinks that not eating junk food all the <br/>
time is depravation, my fault. I am much more relaxed about food <br/>
with my younger one and she has never been faddy.<br/>
<br/>
She is very bright in a reading kind of way but is somehow  a <br/>
little &#39;different&#39;. She has had difficulty understanding social cues <br/>
and social &#39;rules&#39;. She was aggressive but isn&#39;t any more. Because <br/>
of her co-ordination difficulties  she finds writing really hard. <br/>
She&#39;s an adult level reader, self taught. I sort of feel <br/>
her &#39;difference&#39; is also connected to her eating but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard her say she is full, ever.<br/>
<br/>
Although I&#39;ve written a lot here I do try and keep these thoughts of <br/>
mine away from dd as I worry that it will make her more anxious or <br/>
feel bad. All these thoughts go around my head. I do worry a lot I <br/>
have to say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300749865">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any help to offer but just want to let you know that I have a similar concern <br/>
about my ds, 15.  He&#39;s been heavy since he was seven or eight.  I used to control food but <br/>
quit about two years ago.  He still eats sneakily, like slipping into the kitchen after dinner <br/>
to eat leftovers or waiting until everyone is out of the house to eat a snack.  I don&#39;t say <br/>
anything to him about it and I don&#39;t withhold food or voice value judgements about his <br/>
food choices.  I try to have easy to eat, nutritious food available and I bring it to him at <br/>
times.  I don&#39;t know how much he weighs because I don&#39;t ask him but I know he&#39;s gaining <br/>
lately.  I can tell by looking at him and his clothes aren&#39;t fitting.  He is not particularly <br/>
active, physically, but he does have a daily exercise routine that he&#39;s been doing for nine <br/>
months, of his own volition.<br/>
<br/>
His father and I are both overweight too.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas on what to do??<br/>

   thanks Deb.I&#39;m aware of Prader Willi syndrome. Definitely not <br/>
that. Prader Willi also comes with some learning disabilities and <br/>
often people will go in bins to get food. It&#39;s not as extreme as <br/>
that as she doesn&#39;t want to eat constantly, it&#39;s more the volume of <br/>
food.<br/>

Two tricks I&#39;ve read about are eating slowly with long breaks during/between <br/>
bites (conversation, reading, activities that involve her hands, maybe, during <br/>
meals?)   and eating out of a single small bowl, like a rice bowl, with no <br/>
refills until after some time has passed.     I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re *good* ideas, <br/>
but might be worth considering.   They say (whoever &quot;they&quot; are) that it might <br/>
take 20 minutes for the &quot;all&#39;s full&quot; signal to reach the brain.<br/>

chat with DH and DS at dinner (depends on what they&#39;re doing - if DS <br/>
is watching something and takes his dinner to the living room, I&#39;ll <br/>
often grab a magazine article to read). I have found that I will eat <br/>
less if I do this - don&#39;t know if it applies globally or not. And, I <br/>
know that DS, who has never had food regulation at all, tends to <br/>
stop when he&#39;s full regardless of whether he&#39;s just sitting and <br/>
eating or doing something at the time. So it could be a whole <br/>
combined ball o&#39; wax of physiology and psychology and other &#39;stuff&#39;. <br/>
I don&#39;t know how you&#39;d go about &quot;requiring&quot; something like this <br/>
though without it becoming a whole different type of battle. Maybe <br/>
simply putting an interesting magazine article or a catalog or <br/>
something beside her plate at meals?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-772208720">Hi<br/>
   thanks for the ideas. What I really don&#39;t want to do is replace one <br/>
rule with another,if you see what I mean. I&#39;m trying hard not to go <br/>
too far.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just ordered a mini trampoline and a wobble board.I&#39;m going to <br/>
use them but thought they might excite dd too. I told her I had <br/>
ordered them, she was very excited indeed. I think the wobble board <br/>
will help her with her co-ordination. So maybe more activity and more <br/>
drinks might help?<br/>
<br/>
I know she really likes stuff like carrot sticks and cucumber sticks <br/>
and things. I could make loads of them and put them ready for her in <br/>
the fridge.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some really lovely lunch boxes on US sites that have <br/>
seperate containers with lids, colourful too. That would be great in <br/>
the fridge for her to help herself to. Can&#39;t find a damn thing like <br/>
that here (UK). I&#39;m going to look for a food thermo flask too (again <br/>
not as nice as the ones in the US) so I can make her soup she can help <br/>
herself to, sure she&#39;ll love that :)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m similar in some ways to her. I&#39;m happier eating big meals <br/>
of low calorie food than small meals of calorie dense stuff. I&#39;d like <br/>
to eat HUGE meals of calorie dense food but it makes me feel terrible! <br/>
Just as well I really like wholefood stuff and veggies :)<br/>

<br/>
You can&#39;t know what will happen unless you do let go of the controls.  Sandra&#39;s general advice of gradually letting go of controls would apply here.  Don&#39;t just say &quot;you can eat whatever you want&quot;, but say yes more when she asks for food.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that your dd will be a heavier person, no matter what you do or don&#39;t do.  For the most part, good nutrition and physical activity are more important than body weight.  Also, between 8 and 12 is a normal time for kids to put on extra weight in preparation for a final growth spurt.<br/>
<br/>
Is she interested in nutrition?  My kids have recently become very interested in &quot;serving sizes&quot;.  They&#39;ve also off and on paid attention to the food pyramid and recommended #s of servings of various categories.  There are lots of websites on nutrition for kids.  Nutrition is simple and complicated at the same time.  There are so many unknowns.  Recomendations such as the food pyramid can only be very general guidelines, not exact precscriptions for everybody.  Recomendations change every few years too.  So, it makes more sense to help our kids listen to their own cues of hunger and which foods will satisfy them at any given time.  At 12 and 10, my kids still sometimes have food jags where they only want to eat a few certain foods for days or weeks at a time.  I was never very controlling about food, but I became aware of some ways I was controlling.  As I&#39;ve let go I find the kids making amazing choices and frequently turning down ice cream or soda, etc. - unless they really want it!<br/>

<br/>
Sound like it might be a huge deal to her.  What if you gave everyone smaller portions and let each decide whether they need/want more?  Or let each dish up their own?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I also say if she is hungry she can have <br/>

still big!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Fruit can be very &quot;fattening&quot;.  Many fruits are calorie dense.  Could you brainstorm with her on a list of foods she might choose from if she has eaten a meal and still wants more?  When she does ask for food, ask her questions like: sweet or salty? dry or wet? crunchy or soft? thirsty? play a game or do something active first, then see if still hungry?<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a difficult situation for your family.  Our society is rather paranoid about fatness.  Your daughter will not always have you there to control her food.  You can help her best by helping her gain that control for herself.<br/>

portions than   you do her.   Why should you have a bigger portion?<br/>
<br/>
If you limit her portions you are asking for dishonesty, shame, sneakiness, a <br/>
feeling of neediness...   <br/>
Nothing good will come of it.<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
Try not to think of it as control.   It WILL control her.   You&#39;re training <br/>
her to expect to be controlled. You control her now, food controls her later?   <br/>
Drop the word and the idea &quot;control.&quot;   <br/>

Good point.  Thanks for the reminder about using certain words.<br/>
<br/>
How about this: let her listen to her own cues of hunger and fullness and which foods will satisfy at any given time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819134862">Cally, I second you on this.  When I was growing up, my mother tried to <br/>
keep us from reading a lot...said it would create an  unrealistic view <br/>
of the world...so we could only really read if we were doing soimething <br/>
like eating.  I could and still can go through a whole box of cereal if <br/>
I have a good book.  It&#39;s like a co-addiction.  Since I&#39;ve been working <br/>
hard at getting a healthier body,  I&#39;ve completely refused myself to <br/>
read while I eat.  So be careful on presenting any reading material as a <br/>
distraction from eating.    One thing I&#39;ve done that&#39;s worked pretty <br/>
well is to have a list of 100 and 200 calorie foods and pace myself <br/>
throughout the day.  You can eat something every hour that way and still <br/>
only take in 1200-1500 or more calories for the whole day, and  mix up <br/>
the stuff so proteins, carbs, etc. are spaced out for even bouts of <br/>
energy and fullness.  I also try to drink one glass of water in between <br/>
eating every 1-2 hours to maintain my full feeling.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  And try to subtly assure your daughter how much you enjoy <br/>
her and are glad for her just as she is.  Her emotional confidence is <br/>
probably very fragile and is probably the first step to helping her be <br/>
healthier is to boost her own self-worth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490443891">I can&#39;t imagine not ever having felt full.  I think if Linnaea (5) or<br/>
Simon (8) had never felt full, and didn&#39;t have Prader Willi, I would<br/>
make dish after dish of food that I knew they loved and they could eat<br/>
until they were full.  The thought of always feeling hungry just makes<br/>
me feel unhappy.  And I would hate to think that Simon or Linnaea were<br/>
needing food in that way.<br/>
<br/>
In the UK there is a real focus on fat phobia.  Or, more precisely,<br/>
there is a phobic focus on weight.  With Channel 4&#39;s You Are What You<br/>
Eat, and BBC3&#39;s Honey We&#39;re Killing The Kids it is easy to get a sense<br/>
that the most important thing you can do for your child is to help<br/>
them be thin.  David (dh) was watching Honey We&#39;re Killing the Kids<br/>
last night and was appalled to hear them state that a diet of junk<br/>
food lead to a life expectancy of 66 years.  There are no studies that<br/>
prove that.  The message that junk food is bad is so important at the<br/>
moment nobody will argue the made up statistics that BBC3 produces.  <br/>
<br/>
If the most important thing for you is that your daughter isn&#39;t fat<br/>
than you need to address that. I don&#39;t know that controlling her food<br/>
will do that, smoking kept me thin for a long time, so maybe that<br/>
would work.  But smoking has it&#39;s downside too.  Maybe you could offer<br/>
going to your local leisure centre during lunchtime and go swimming<br/>
(we&#39;ve found our local is much emptier at lunchtime than at other<br/>
times).  I don&#39;t know where you are in Wales, but there are beautiful<br/>
beaches, aren&#39;t there? maybe you could go rockhounding on the beach<br/>
and get a walk in that way.  You could see if there is a climbing wall<br/>
nearby and she could try climbing, Simon and Linnaea both really enjoy<br/>
that. Maybe there is a fencing club or an archery group or something<br/>
that you and she could do that she&#39;d really like.  It might not change<br/>
her weight at all, but it might make her more interested in other<br/>
kinds of activities besides eating.  <br/>
<br/>
Let her eat.  Make food an area where she has no guilt and no<br/>
emotional relationship to increase her desire for it.  Pam wrote a<br/>
wonderful post on the marginal utility of anything and how denying<br/>
access to something increases its relative value.  I posted it on my<br/>
blog here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://waynforth.blogspot.com/2005/01/marginal-utility-or-marginal-value.html">http://waynforth.blogspot.com/2005/01/marginal-utility-or-marginal-value.html</a><br/>
(which I hope is alright, I never actually asked for permission to<br/>
quote you Pam). Maybe you should read that and see if you need to<br/>
change your perspective.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815912027">I&#39;m just not sure. She&#39;s 9 and weighs 9 and a half stone. Her height <br/>
is 4 feet 10 and half inches. She is probably going to be about 5ft <br/>
9 and a half inches. The shoes I&#39;m going to have to get her this <br/>
time are going to be a UK size 5. That&#39;s adult size here. She&#39;s got <br/>
massive shoulders and is very strong. I am tall 5ft 8 and strong too <br/>
and her dad is very thickly built with weight lifter type shoulders. <br/>
I guess she was never going to be petite :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It&#39;s not made in to a huge deal but I do give her smaller <br/>

<br/>
 &gt;It&#39;s not fair.   She&#39;s young and growing and hungry.Give yourself <br/>
&gt;smaller portions than you do her.   Why should you have a bigger <br/>
 </span></blockquote>portion?<br/>
<br/>
Because surely a 9 year old doesn&#39;t need a many calories as an <br/>
adult? Would I give a 3 year old an adult portion? I dunno, I&#39;m lost.<br/>
I feel I am already to blame for her weight by giving her too big <br/>
portions already.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought about this some more and I think this is much more <br/>
about me than dd really. :(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you limit her portions you are asking for dishonesty, shame, <br/>
&gt;sneakiness, a &gt; feeling of neediness... &gt; Nothing good will come of <br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s the difference between limiting portions and saying you can&#39;t <br/>
eat anything else for a set amount of time or having to eat from a <br/>
smaller bowl (as you&#39;ve already suggested)? I am a bit confused <br/>
about this. This is an honest question btw not any antagonism. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -0=-Our society is rather paranoid about fatness.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder how many issues are brought to the unschooling list by <br/>
parents thinking it&#39;s a problem with their child when it&#39;s really a <br/>
problem of their own?<br/>
<br/>
I am paranoid about fatness as it is a killer and also for other <br/>
reasons I&#39;ll list below. It is guaranteed to shorten life, <br/>
especially in our family. I also have personal hangups about fatness <br/>
which I think are clouding this issue. This issue has given me the <br/>
chance to think about it all more deeply.<br/>
<br/>
This is really hard and I think people may find my feelings about <br/>
this disturbing. I know I do. It&#39;s a mixed bag of feelings of <br/>
revulsion, shame and guilt.<br/>
<br/>
5 years ago I was really ill and put on five and half stone. <br/>
Entirely due to that weight and family predisposition I am now <br/>
glucose tolerance impaired. I have personaly now lost 2 and a half <br/>
stone but it is not enough. I have to lose weight or I will get <br/>
Diabetes. Being fat as a child (I wasn&#39;t,I was skinny) greatly <br/>
increases the chances of getting serious diseases. I am afraid.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it also plays in to my own personal disgust at fatness. I <br/>
really hope I haven&#39;t passed it on to dd (I try not to) but I sort <br/>
of feel being fat is immoral. That also means I am not a good <br/>
person. When there are so many people without enough the fact that <br/>
people can eat so much it affects their health is disgusting..I am <br/>
including myself in this. I am disgusting. I was also disgusting <br/>
when I was just a stone overweight.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it&#39;s repulsive, on me especially my self loathing knows <br/>
no bounds, but it does affect my feelings with my daughter. I am <br/>
embaressed (sp?) to have a fat child. What an awful admission. This <br/>
is a mess really. <br/>
<br/>
My mother has been fat her entire life and as a child I always <br/>
thought her body was repulsive and swore I&#39;d never get like that. It <br/>
may have been because I went to boarding school from the age of 8 so <br/>
mostly only saw other childrens bodies. I don&#39;t like my mother very <br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
I am embaressed to go out as I feel people are judging me because I <br/>
and my dd are fat. People really judge about fatness in children. I <br/>
am hyper sensitive to other peoples&#39; ideas. I am working on not <br/>
being that way.<br/>
<br/>
I am terrified of being judged. I worry constantly about how people <br/>
see me, this was handed down from my mother who only really cares <br/>
about what things look like not how they really are. I don&#39;t want to <br/>
pass this on to dd but how can I not? It must pervade everything. I <br/>
guess at least I am aware of it and working on it which is a good <br/>
start.<br/>
<br/>
Actually your writing (Sandra) about changing dials to sliders or <br/>
dimmers was very useful. When I start thinking people are thinking <br/>
I&#39;m a bad mother cos I am letting dd have an enormous dessert when <br/>
we&#39;re out I try and think SLIDERS! DIMMERS! get rid of that DIAL <br/>
that says ALL or NOTHING! They might be thinking what a polite <br/>
person she is or what a nice family we look. Or they might not even <br/>
be thinking about us at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87743964">Sometimes people eat in order to placate a sense of poverty (emotional or physical), or lack of control over their own lives.  My FIL, who is obese and getting more so, will sit at the table after dinner with a magazine, a bag of nuts and/or a carton of prunes and eat mindlessly.  He has a low self-esteem (perceived poverty of friends) and comforts himself with eating.  There are also control issues with his wife (over his eating and drinking, just for starters).  <br/>
 <br/>
If he were to de-school his eating he may go into a period of gorging (a la tv & kids), but over time would, in theory, even out.  Unfortunately, he&#39;s in his mid-sixties and may not have that kind of time.  <br/>
 <br/>
Is there some area of her life that is under stress that triggers a need to control an area of her life (eating)?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s the other way around.   Adults don&#39;t need as much as children.   <br/>
She&#39;s 9!   She&#39;s big.   She&#39;s growing.   She&#39;s coming toward puberty when <br/>
kids need LOTS of calories because their bodies are transforming from kid-version <br/>
to adult version.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Would I give a 3 year old an adult portion?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you think of food in terms of &quot;adult portions&quot; and you&#39;ve been <br/>
apportioning it, maybe that&#39;s part of the problem.   <br/>
<br/>
From the beginning my kids could choose what they ate and how much of it, or <br/>
how little of it.   My husband was a pudgy baby, born fat, and stayed big <br/>
always.   Our oldest is somewhat that way (not as big as his dad was) and the <br/>
other two aren&#39;t.   I was a scrawny kid, and until after I had the second baby, <br/>
was not big.    Food isn&#39;t used to try to control growth.   It&#39;s a resource, <br/>
like water, like soft places to sit, like things to read.   If you make it a <br/>
powerful, dangerous substance, you&#39;ll have problems.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel I am already to blame for her weight by giving her too big<br/>
portions already.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Try to get over the blame and guilt.   If it&#39;s not your fault, must it be her <br/>
fault?<br/>
Can fault be removed from the equation?<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s mom never blamed herself, she always blamed him, from the time <br/>
he was a baby, and she tried giving him less food, so he would sneak off and <br/>
eat elsewhere, and spend his money on food, and food is still his comfort <br/>
substance.   She would have done better to love him and feed him and maybe he would <br/>
have felt rich and full many years ago, instead of empty and unloved and <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What&#39;s the difference between limiting portions and saying you can&#39;t<br/>
eat anything else for a set amount of time or having to eat from a<br/>
smaller bowl (as you&#39;ve already suggested)?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say &quot;say you can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
You asked for input.   If SHE wants to find tricks to eat less you might <br/>
suggest that SHE get a special bowl, but I never once suggested that you control <br/>
her portions or you time her eating.<br/>
<br/>
Probably because of the way my kids are and my family is, I wasn&#39;t assuming <br/>
you wanted a new control plan, but a way to stop trying to control.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wonder how many issues are brought to the unschooling list by<br/>
parents thinking it&#39;s a problem with their child when it&#39;s really a<br/>
problem of their own?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
I am paranoid about fatness as it is a killer and also for other<br/>
reasons I&#39;ll list below. It is guaranteed to shorten life,-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is not logic, it&#39;s fear speaking.   It&#39;s bullshit.<br/>
Stress is a killer.<br/>
Shame and unhappiness are killers.<br/>
That they often go hand in hand with fat is a damned shame.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I suppose it also plays in to my own personal disgust at fatness. I<br/>
really hope I haven&#39;t passed it on to dd (I try not to) but I sort<br/>
of feel being fat is immoral.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well you didn&#39;t create that feeling yourself, it&#39;s deeply ingrained in our <br/>
whole culture and language and history.   Gluttony was one of the infamous seven <br/>
deadly sins of rhetoric-gone-by.   But what of people who are not <br/>
&quot;gluttonous&quot; but are naturally biologically larger than others?    <br/>
<br/>
Is being tall a sin?   Is being pale skinned a sin?   Is have large or small <br/>
breasts a sin?   Big hands?   Freckles?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe reading about genetics would make you feel better for a while here than <br/>
reading about disease and diet and obesity.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also think it&#39;s repulsive, on me especially my self loathing knows<br/>
no bounds, but it does affect my feelings with my daughter.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Get therapy then.   Find a help group of some sort.   Whose voice is in your <br/>
head saying you&#39;re disgusting?   Your mom?   Your grandmother? Friends long <br/>
gone?    Do you want YOUR voice to live in your daughter&#39;s head long after <br/>
you&#39;re gone, saying she&#39;s disgusting, her feet are too big, and she should be <br/>
ashamed?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I don&#39;t want to<br/>
pass this on to dd but how can I not? It must pervade everything.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Awareness is a good start, but do not take your time.   MOVE to change.   <br/>
She&#39;ll be twelve or fifteen before you know it if you take your time to change.<br/>
<br/>

especially in our family. I  also have personal hangups about fatness <br/>
which I think are clouding this  issue. This issue has given me the <br/>
chance to think about it all more  deeply.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
You&#39;re very brave to admit all that you did.  And that&#39;s a good start  to <br/>
getting past it.<br/>
 <br/>
I will admit that I wanted my last child to be a girl, but I was also  <br/>
desparately afraid that if it were a girl that she would have the genes of my  <br/>
husband&#39;s side of the family and look like my Amazon sister-in-law.  Well,  Will <br/>
wasn&#39;t a girl, and he did get those genes, and he looks a lot like his  father <br/>
in body shape--but also got my good eyes, and he&#39;s much more athletic  than <br/>
that side of the family and I&#39;m not too concerned about him becoming  overweight <br/>
or having thick jowls, as I would be if he were female.  My goal  for us, <br/>
because he does have that body type, is that we live a very active  lifestyle, <br/>
trying all kinds of sports together, and if he lives that life then  it will be <br/>
easy to continue it as an adult.  We currently mountain bike  together, and <br/>
canoe and hike and swim and play tennis (but my husband  doesn&#39;t).  I figure the <br/>
more I exercise, the more food I can enjoy!   ;)<br/>
 <br/>
So, I understand what you mean about having a fat daughter.  My dad is  <br/>
paranoid of it, too, and makes comments about my weight sometimes...but I let  them <br/>
slide off because I know I can bike 12 miles on a rooty mountain trail in  <br/>
spite of having a bad back, and he can&#39;t do that, even though he&#39;s thin.<br/>
 <br/>
I would like to recommend a book.  The Ultimate Weight-Loss Solution  by Dr. <br/>
Phil McGraw.  Say what you will about Dr. Phil (and I&#39;ve said plenty  about <br/>
his ideas about children), this is one of the books that has been most  helpful <br/>
to me about getting through the emotional aspects of why we eat and  are <br/>
overweight.<br/>
 <br/>
You really should get past it, for your daughter&#39;s sake.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905687549">I struggle with weight issues and more!<br/>
I can totally relate to your post.<br/>
<br/>
I feel I am already to blame for her weight by giving<br/>
her too big portions already.<br/>
<br/>
+++ I also feel responsible. We eat out too much. I<br/>
WANT to grocery shop, fix meals at home, and be able<br/>
to KNOW I&#39;m offering the best for my child/self, but<br/>
it never seems to end up that way.  It&#39;s like feast or<br/>
famine in my house.  Once I do shop, we all tend to<br/>
over eat because it&#39;s so great to have stuff at home. <br/>
Maybe I need to &quot;schedule&quot; weekly shopping trips so<br/>
I&#39;m not so overwhelmed by the process?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also think it&#39;s repulsive, on me especially my<br/>
self loathing knows no bounds, but it does affect my<br/>
feelings wh my daughter. I am embaressed to have a fat<br/>
child. What an awful admission.<br/>
<br/>
+++ I know I don&#39;t like being overweight as I no<br/>
longer enjoy things I used too.  Things like running<br/>
and hiking are physically exhausting to me.  I do<br/>
sense my son is very unhappy about his weight for the<br/>
way he looks.  He&#39;s always sucking in his gut and<br/>
telling me &quot;I just would like to look like this all<br/>
the time&quot; <br/>
Know what&#39;s strange?  I see myself in the mirror and<br/>
seem only a bit larger than my thin self...but then<br/>
see photos of myself and cry...I am huge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I worry constantly about how people see me, this was<br/>
handed down from my mother who only really cares <br/>
about what things look like not how they really are.<br/>
<br/>
+++ I do, too!   I&#39;m 5&#39;9&quot;, 260lbs.  My son is 11yo,<br/>
4&#39;9&quot;, 120lbs.  The world looks at us as though we have<br/>
nothing to offer.  LAZY is the word I hear in my mind.<br/>
 I feel lazy for not shopping, feeding us well,<br/>
exercising as I should.  As a kid I was teased for<br/>
being thin.  How ironic!!<br/>
My parents are especially critical of my son and me. <br/>
My athletic daughter is &quot;normal&quot; weight, therefore,<br/>
acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
I will say this: my son is now taking a fencing class<br/>
on Thursdays (1hr) and LOVES it.  Works up a sweat and<br/>
feels the burn of exercise and likes it.  We go to the<br/>
park after that and play for 2 hours with other<br/>
kids/parents in our homeschool group.  Total free<br/>
play.  Exercise isn&#39;t the goal (although it certainly<br/>
happens).  He seems less concerned with his appearance<br/>
lately.  I always try to stay neutral.  I just beat up<br/>
on myself, in my head, for not being more dedicated,<br/>
energetic towards HEALTH.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; 9 and a half inches.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could very well be she&#39;s gearing up.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn was about the same height and weight (if my math is right and  <br/>
a stone is 14 pounds that&#39;s about 120 pounds) at 12. Now she&#39;s 5&#39; 4&quot;  <br/>
and about 100 lbs. I can&#39;t totally use her as an example since she  <br/>
went for a regular check up and the nurse pointed out where she was  <br/>
on the height/weight chart and Kathryn wasn&#39;t pleased. So *she*  <br/>
decided to start moving. She also has a dad who&#39;s great at focusing  <br/>
on the positive and setting reasonable goals. So now she&#39;s an  <br/>
enthusiastic runner.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I even mention it -- since I can&#39;t package up the internal  <br/>
motivation and the running partner for others ;-) -- is that  <br/>
Kathryn&#39;s interest in sports may not be entirely related to weight  <br/>
since I&#39;ve noticed that the 11-13 age is a common age for formerly  <br/>
uninterested kids to become interested in sports. Kathryn joined the  <br/>
town softball team and we were silently concerned that all the girls  <br/>
would be a lot better than she and it would be discouraging for her  <br/>
but half the team had never played before. And my husband volunteered  <br/>
to coach the middle school cross country team (11-13 year olds) and  <br/>
most of the kids had never run before.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine&#39;s son was round also and is also now tall and thin.  <br/>
The interesting thing is that his formerly skinny  younger brother is  <br/>
now round and looks exactly like his brother did a couple of years ago.<br/>
<br/>
If your *daughter* wants to eat less, then drinking water and many  <br/>
small portions (as others suggested) rather than one large portion  <br/>
can be helpful. But if it&#39;s you that&#39;s trying to find ways to control  <br/>
her eating, her motivation is going to be towards figuring out how to  <br/>
get around your controls so she can get the food she wants.<br/>
<br/>
Does she eat a lot of carbohydrates? She may want to switch them for  <br/>
proteins and vegetables and whole grains. And thought is changing on  <br/>
low fat diets because fat helps us feel full and low fat diets can  <br/>
often leave us feeling hungry all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-242085553">My 9 almost 10 year old boy eats WAY more than I do.  During his growth spurts I LOVE all you can eat restaurants for him.  He eats 4-5 full meals a day, along with snacks when he is in his growing period.  He usually does that for about 3 months at a time, he puts on a little around the waist, then he shoots up, and slows down a little on the eating.  Then it starts all over again.  Even during his slow period he eats more than I do though, and he always eats 2 dinners, one early and one fairly late.  I guess that is what you consider supper and dinner?  Kids, especially as they near puberty, need more calories.  And girls who carry a little more weight often loose it after they start their periods, at least I did, and my niece has.  We were both a little chunky, then at around 13-14, when the periods started getting more regular the weight dropped off.   Speaking of my niece, she is 14 and in public school.  She comes to my house after school most days.  You should see how much she eats when she gets here, then has a full dinner.  They need the nourishment.<br/>
<br/>
And just as an aside, since you mentioned your daughter&#39;s shoe size, my son (remember he is 9) wears a US size 5 mens.  That is a US size 7 womens, which is what I wear.  It is a pretty average size for women, most women are between 7 and 9.  He is a tall, muscular kid, with big feet (like a great dane puppy &lt;g&gt;)  If your daughter is tall with wide shoulders and is muscular, she probably needs more nourishment than a small dainty 9 year old.  A muscular person burns more calories doing every day things than a person without a lot of muscle.  So they need to take in more calories.  <br/>
<br/>
I am what I consider a bit overweight, have been since having my son.  According to the medical standards, I am &quot;morbidly obese.&quot;  But you know what?  I can hike 20 miles in our desert mountains.  I do a cardio kick-boxing type workout 2-3 times a week.  I am pretty strong, whenever someone needs something heavy moved they usually come to me.  And my cholesterol is 115 and my blood pressure is low.  But I am fat.  Fat doesn&#39;t always equal unhealthy.  Things like cholesterol level and especially stress are much more important in terms of general health.  <br/>
<br/>
I have some food issues myself, so I know a little of what you are feeling, but those issues are mine.  I will not make them my son&#39;s.  My mom was a &quot;clean your plate, there are starving children in China&quot; kind of mom.  I got slapped for suggesting that we send the food to the starving children down the street, insubordination.  She has changed her views 180 degrees since then, but I still carry the guilt whenever I throw food away.  (I picture it stuck to my butt as more lumpy cellulite, that helps! &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
<br/>
Showing your daughter that you love her no matter what, that food is not an issue, would be helpful.  What I have learned from the people on this list is that the relationship with your kids is the most important thing.  So stop worrying about food and her weight and start working on building a good, strong, loving relationship with your daughter.  Focus on what SHE wants and needs, and the rest will follow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579509532"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Because surely a 9 year old doesn&#39;t need a many calories as an <br/>
&gt; adult? Would I give a 3 year old an adult portion? I dunno, I&#39;m lost.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 9 year old daughter currently weighs 63 pounds.  I convert that to <br/>
4.5 stone (I could be wrong on my conversion, thus I give the known <br/>
accurate, too).  Her whole life she has been able to eat whatever she <br/>
wants whenever she wants without artificial quantity or time constraints <br/>
(a la Unschooling).  I am a grown woman that weighs more than double her <br/>
weight and I eat the same quantity or less than her every single day (I <br/>
don&#39;t know precisely since I&#39;ve never measured out her food).  Why does <br/>
she eat &quot;so much&quot;?  Partially genetics and partially the fact that she <br/>
is a growing girl.  Her brain and body need a lot of calories to help <br/>
her grow and be strong.  I expect Zoë to gain a lot of weight and height <br/>
over the next couple of years.  I became my full adult size around 12. <br/>
She is going to need to eat a lot if she wants to grow that much in only <br/>
3 years.  I don&#39;t think that she even is aware of the fact that she eats <br/>
about the same amount as me, because I&#39;ve never brought it to her <br/>
attention in a positive or negative way.  It is just food, not a <br/>
contest.  We usually all start out with less than we are going to want <br/>
of a meal and get ourselves refills until we&#39;ve had enough.  I do start <br/>
my 5 year old out with a lot less, but when I see her having hungry <br/>
days, I offer her more food (or she just gets it herself :) ).  Neither <br/>
of my children have ever snuck food, as every food that we have is <br/>
always available to them at any time of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered going to some sort of Weight Watchers program with <br/>
her?  As a homeschooler it would be easy for her to tag along with you <br/>
to meetings and sit by you-- offer her a book or something to do during <br/>
the meeting times, don&#39;t require her to listen (or weigh in!).  I have <br/>
had weight issues in the past and reading a lot about nutrition and <br/>
having help with discovering what proper portion sizes look like helps a <br/>
lot.  Personally, I would make this about *you* and tell her that you <br/>
need her help (for all the reasons that you wrote this list -- be very <br/>
honest and open with your daughter, but not in a scary way, just a <br/>
proactive way).  She isn&#39;t necessarily in immediate danger, as she is a <br/>
growing girl and could do some major stretching over the next couple of <br/>
years.  She would be a super model at her current weight if she were as <br/>
tall as you predict that she is going to be.<br/>
<br/>
As I learned more about nutrition, I brought that information into my <br/>
family&#39;s diet (I cooked their meals!) and I talked about all the <br/>
interesting information that I was finding out.  I was shocked at some <br/>
of the lies that I had previously believed and I shared this information <br/>
with my husband and children.  I discovered that I had food allergies <br/>
and I found out how good that I could feel once I permanently took those <br/>
allergens out of my life.  Then, after all of this talking and <br/>
discussing your newfound interest, let the rest of your family make <br/>
their final decisions on their own regarding their diet.  Ultimately, <br/>
their bodies are their bodies.  My family&#39;s diet (including some <br/>
extended family) has changed dramatically for the better since I went on <br/>
a personal quest to get healthy.  I have never pressured them into <br/>
changing their diets.  Example really works, lecturing seldom does. <br/>
Live the life that you wish that your family was living.  Buy the foods <br/>
that are good for _you_.  Keep stocked up in overflowing quantities <br/>
(this is really important as it is easier to eat healthy foods if they <br/>
are actually available and ready to eat).  My 9 year old daughter, Zoë, <br/>
is a bigger advocate of healthy eating than I am!<br/>
<br/>
This is a tough issue and definitely an important unschooling one.  Food <br/>
  is necessary every day and can affects every aspect of how a person&#39;s <br/>
quality of life is.<br/>
