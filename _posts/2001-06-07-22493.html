 </span></blockquote>What kind of &quot;Special Needs&quot; does your son have Linda?<br/>
 Also, who is your friend counting on turning you in? <br/>
Is she going to turn you in?<br/>

withdrawing him from a special program -- and are those people giving you a <br/>
hard time?  Confusing.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058786034">I don&#39;t mean to be  confuaing. Erik is a delightful, happy,<br/>
challenging, active + little boy.<br/>
He has Fetal Alcohal Syndrme, with sensory issues. He has<br/>
an undiagnosed joint disorder and airway problems, Used to<br/>
have a trache. Lots of other stuff.<br/>
He has had a one on one aid up thru now, (4th grade) He<br/>
goes to the middle school this fall and they have decided<br/>
he does not need this one on one aid because he had a good<br/>
year last year. New school, new people all around, BIGGER<br/>
kids. I have decided to pull him for safety factors. I hope<br/>
this will also help calm him down some.<br/>
As far as my friend, she has had school officials call in<br/>
for educational neglect to CPS for kids with special needs.<br/>
We do have an IEP and he gets OT PT and speech  therapies.<br/>
Hope this answers questions to help make sense.<br/>
Linda<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi, I am planning on homeschooling my 10 yr special<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;needs son this fall. He needs some routine and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;structure, but not the sit at his desk and do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;worksheets all day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Also, I have been told by a friend, (cps worker) that<br/>

&gt; &gt; What kind of &quot;Special Needs&quot; does your son have Linda?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, who is your friend counting on turning you in?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is she going to turn you in?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nanci K.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And what does she think you are going to be turned in for?  Are you<br/>
&gt;withdrawing him from a special program -- and are those people giving you a<br/>
&gt;hard time?  Confusing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, sure.  Middle school.  That&#39;s the time when a kid would need LESS help.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stand these stupid bureacrats anymore and am going to go read a good <br/>
book instead!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me understand your situation, though.<br/>
