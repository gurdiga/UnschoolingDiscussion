<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I agree with you. It seems that there is a few people here that run the list <br/>
&gt; and they either completely ignore newcomers with their questions and <br/>
&gt; concerns, or they run them over. Sometimes I wonder if this is really an <br/>
&gt; &quot;open&quot; list or if it&#39;s &quot;moderated&quot; from within by the *unschooling police*.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had to say this, because I&#39;ve noticed the same trend you have.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The really cool thing about e-lists is that you can unsub at any time (check <br/>
the bottom of every post---directions!). No one is forcing anyone to remain <br/>
where they are uncomfortable. REALLY!<br/>
<br/>
As Frank Smith says, &quot;We learn from the company we keep.&quot; The majority here <br/>
LIKE the company more than 90% of the time---or we ignore it.<br/>
<br/>
I guess this group IS kinda the &quot;Unschooling Police Force&quot;. I LIKE that. If <br/>
you&#39;re not sure what IS unschooling---really unschooling---the unschooling <br/>
that leaks into parenting and into a lifestyle, you come here. Ask away: free <br/>
advice and neat real life stories just for the asking! I&#39;ve found the most <br/>
articulate, sensitive, and insightful folks I&#39;ve ever met HERE, in this forum <br/>
(and I&#39;ve even had quite a few of them in my back yard! WOW!).<br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re not happy, there are options. Several folks have started their <br/>
own unschooling lists after leaving Unschoolingdotcom in a huff. Those lists <br/>
don&#39;t seem to last long though!  And who wants a watered-down version of <br/>
unschooling? Well, I guess there ARE a few---and those lists are out there. <br/>
<br/>
And all lists that I&#39;ve found have a handful of &quot;regular&quot; posters and MANY <br/>
lurkers. What&#39;s this list up to? 8-900? How many post on a regular basis? <br/>
25-30? with 10 major &quot;leaders&quot;? Just like every other list I&#39;ve been on. The <br/>
&quot;leaders&quot; are those that have more experience, more knowledge, and better <br/>
ways of explaining things.<br/>
<br/>
Compassion? Well, that comes and goes! &lt;G&gt; How many times can one hear the <br/>
same lame excuses without getting a bit peeved? Some handle it better than <br/>
others, certainly. But newbies are advised from the get-go to sit back and <br/>
read a while, to comb the archives, and &quot;get the feel&quot; of this list before <br/>
jumping in. There is also the excellent resource of the unschooling.com <br/>
message boards---actually easier to read than the archives (those damned <br/>
pop-ups!) with many of these same posters and others who don&#39;t like e-lists, <br/>
(like AnneO). It&#39;s often (but not always) gentler there.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;tone&quot; of some posts may be bothersome---just as with any large group. <br/>
But if you read them with humor and laughter in your &quot;head-voice&quot;, it&#39;ll come <br/>
out better. I&#39;ve met MANY of these posters---they are VERY funny and maybe a <br/>
little sarcastic (you all know who you are! &lt;BWEG&gt;), but none of it&#39;s meant <br/>
in a mean way (well, unless they&#39;re attacked; then things can get mean).<br/>
<br/>
Keep the laughter button turned on in you &quot;head-voice&quot;, read/listen sweetly, <br/>
and keep an open mind--just like with your children!  There&#39;s gobs of info <br/>
here if you&#39;re willing to listen. And if not, there are other lists. <br/>

It doesn&#39;t work with the Search Archive feature, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-929861567">Thanks for pulling this out Ren. I missed it. ;-)<br/>
    I&#39;ve been tossing around starting an unschooler group here but I&#39;m kinda<br/>
apprehensive. Any sugestions? I&#39;m really not into debate or arguing. So many<br/>
people think unschooling is eclectic. I know it may be a step to it<br/>
but...Plus I just don&#39;t want to start it alone. Maybe after the conference<br/>
I&#39;ll be braver and more committed to community.<br/>

That&#39;s the beauty of it being a group YOU start. They will more readily <br/>
accept when you say &quot;we don&#39;t run things that way.&quot; After all, if they don&#39;t like <br/>
it, they can start their own group!!<br/>

MOST days, Kelly.  <br/>
If you read the implication that someone was saying that the list was active, <br/>
that was YOU reading into it.  Why don&#39;t you ask questions if you don&#39;t <br/>
understand?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(That was sarcasm.  When people suggest a list is healthily busy and it&#39;s <br/>
kind of a-snooze, that&#39;s a waste of this list&#39;s time, in my opinion.  But luckily <br/>
there are some unhappy people here who think this list is awful, and the <br/>
address of other, more peaceful lists, could give them a really peaceful place to <br/>
go.<br/>
