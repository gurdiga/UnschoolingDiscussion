<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087985732">OK, people, we&#39;re all wrong. I knew it had to be out<br/>
there somewhere:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Buttercup: You mock my pain!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Dread Pirate Roberts: Life is pain, Highness. Anyone<br/>
&gt;who says differently is selling something.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>DOH!  I knew that!  I didn&#39;t trust my own memory<br/>
because the &quot;Life is Pain&quot; line is repeatedly used in<br/>
another flick I like &quot;Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; and I<br/>
assumed that I was remembering wrong for Princess<br/>
Bride, so I followed the line that had already been<br/>
suggested.  Then of course, just to further confuse<br/>
things, there is the &quot;Life&#39;s not fair...&quot; speech that<br/>
Scar gives to the mouse in &quot;The Lion King.&quot;  Whenever<br/>
I don&#39;t listen to my intuition I am always sorry...<br/>
