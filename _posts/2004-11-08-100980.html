<div id="ygrps-yiv-351616165">or should I say that we&#39;ve decided to forgo the expensive curricula <br/>
we purchased, after pulling our 6yr. old out of private school, and <br/>
go back to learning by living.  I am often in doubt, however, that I <br/>
am providing enough of an atmosphere to guide her learning.  If she <br/>
were an only child, like when she was an only child, I would be <br/>
taking her to museums, etc., stimulating her interests further.  She <br/>
has two younger brothers, though, and trips of that sort have <br/>
resulted in nothing but frustration.  Just going to the library is <br/>
such a challenge.  I try to do things once my husband is home but <br/>
often I am exhausted by that point and need time to myself.  There <br/>
is so much pressure, from relatives (in-laws, especially)and society <br/>
in general, to measure her learning by teaching six hours a day, as <br/>
if she were in school.  I am often afraid that my mother-in-law will <br/>
call social services or something and that they&#39;ll find that I&#39;ve <br/>
been neglecting my children&#39;s education. Even worse, I worry that I <br/>
am.  How do you know when you are okay? Anyone in the same boat out <br/>
there and/or have any suggestions.  Thanks.  I feel blessed you all <br/>
exist and that I finally found an avenue for support.</div>

Hi Judy,<br/>
<br/>
You may also find more help at UnschoolingBasics, also at Yahoo groups, a<br/>
list more specifically designed for new unschoolers. I mean don&#39;t leave here<br/>
at all - they are really complimentary lists. Since you have younger<br/>
children in the home you might also be interested in AlwaysUnschooled at<br/>
Yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
Even a brief period of being in school can be damaging - and I&#39;m guessing<br/>
you saw some damage or you wouldn&#39;t have pulled your dd out. She will need<br/>
to spend some time de-schooling (also called decompressing). Just pretend it<br/>
is vacation for the time being, and let her relax and play.<br/>
<br/>
Also, with the holidays are coming up so soon, you have the perfect excuse<br/>
to tell your relatives that you are going to re-examine your schedule, or<br/>
some such vague yet true statement, after the new year. This will give you<br/>
time to do plenty of reading about Unschooling in the interim.<br/>
<br/>
For a good start try www.sandradodd.com/unschooling <br/>
<br/>
For a different format, but a lot of the same wonderful writers, try<br/>
www.unschooling.info  Everything organized into topics.<br/>
<br/>
For mindful parenting - especially of little ones - info try<br/>
www.naturalchild.org  <br/>
<br/>
Also John Holt. For relatives who still think schools are fabulous places<br/>
for every child, but want to learn more, try giving them some John Taylor<br/>
Gatto. <br/>
<br/>
I pretty much always leave dealing with his mother&#39;s negativity to my dh. He<br/>
prefers it that way also. If you have genuine fears that your MIL would do<br/>
something so disruptive to family unity as call CPS (or whatever it is<br/>
called in your state) I think the first person to talk to about that might<br/>
be your dh. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the journey. Don&#39;t forget to &quot;Breathe deeply&quot;.<br/>

Why dont you get the in-laws to take her on some trips and get involved in <br/>
aiding her in her teaching. If there so concirned, they should take some time <br/>
out of their life to be mentors or something.<br/>
(P.S. it dosent stop there, see if any family or friends with less on there <br/>
plate (young kids ARE really hard to travel with) want to help out...It could <br/>
be fun for both them and her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979658929">Hi Judy,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Unschooling! I would also suggest the AlwaysUnschooled group <br/>
*in addition*  to this group, as we talk a lot about younger children <br/>
(under 8) and moving towards Unschooling naturally.<br/>
<br/>
I also recognize your email from IRL, (waving here) and would encourage <br/>
you to come to the Life is Learning Unschooling Support group. We meet <br/>
the second Monday of the month, from 7:00--9:00 at the Safeway Starbucks <br/>
in Prince Frederick. You can check the SMHN calendar if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you approach unschooling with the need to prove to doubters that it works<br/>
it&#39;s going to interfer with giving your kids what they need.<br/>
<br/>
If you approach unschooling with confidence, knowing it&#39;s the best thing you<br/>
can give for your children, then you won&#39;t need to show people they&#39;re wrong<br/>
and you&#39;re right to get them to agree that what you&#39;re doing is right.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite analogies is Mother Teresa. She didn&#39;t need to prove to<br/>
anyone she believed she was doing right. She just did it. If people doubted,<br/>
she could give them information but their doubt was their problem to work<br/>
through. (At least that&#39;s the vision that a several-years-ago viewing of the<br/>
documentary about Mother Teresa has left me with!)<br/>
<br/>
If people bend over backwards trying to prove to others that they&#39;re right<br/>
they come across as being doubtful themselves. It feels from the outside as<br/>
though the &quot;I need to prove I&#39;m right&quot; people aren&#39;t sure about what they&#39;re<br/>
doing and they want to substitute agreement for confidence.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t an easy way to get to that confidence! It takes a lot of reading<br/>
and a lot of seeing the world through your kids eyes rather than seeing your<br/>
kids through the world&#39;s school colored glasses.<br/>
<br/>
Usually I don&#39;t mention unscholing. I just say homeschooling. If people ask<br/>
further about curriculum, I say I just follow her interests. If they ask if<br/>
she gets a break over the summer I say if she stops being interested in<br/>
things then we&#39;ll take a break but so far that hasn&#39;t happened ;-)<br/>
<br/>
What many people find helpful when dealing with relatives is giving them<br/>
books and saying that you&#39;ve done your homework on the subject and if they&#39;d<br/>
like to discuss it with you, then you&#39;ll be happy to once they&#39;re up to<br/>
speed.<br/>
