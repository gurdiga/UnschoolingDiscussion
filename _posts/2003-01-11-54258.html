I did find a few anti-HSLDA articles last year.  I could usually understand<br/>
the point of view being expressed, and generally agreed with some of the<br/>
criticism, tho not all.  I have heard of Cafi Cohen, maybe read a website<br/>
she has?, but have not heard of Karl Bunday.  I&#39;ll look him up.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907393190">A lot of good ideas about Beauty.  I also thought of a scavenger hunt,<br/>
either indoors or out (weather?).  Maybe give each group/team/ or just<br/>
everyone together a list of things to look for - not necessarily specifics,<br/>
but rather &quot;find something that makes you smile/happy/feel good/etc.&quot;,<br/>
&quot;something that might be beautiful to you/ your mom/boys/grandparents/people<br/>
from other cultures/etc.&quot;  Just let your imagination go!  Bonus:  No cost<br/>
(maybe paper)!<br/>
