<div id="ygrps-yiv-574450779">I just read this in the latest &quot;Gentle Spirit&quot;* issue:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The benefit for Patty Pink, which we announced in the last issue of Gentle<br/>
Spirit, has been canceled. No further plans for a benefit have been<br/>
announced. As of this writing, _Patty Pink&#39;s children have been returned to<br/>
her;_ however, her case is still in progress, she is not allowed to discuss<br/>
the case with anyone, and she remains in need of financial assistance. Pink<br/>
is a single mother whose twin sons were removed from her by Child Protective<br/>
Services for &quot;isolation due to homeschooling&quot;, even though she had satisfied<br/>
California homeschooling requirements, and even though her sons were<br/>
involved in many community activities. Donations for Patty Pink&#39;s legal<br/>
expenses, whish are substantial and ongoing, can be sent to her attorney as<br/>
follows:&quot;<br/>
