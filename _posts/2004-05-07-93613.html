<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786204416">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
What I love about our lifestyle is the freedom to eat when and what we want.<br/>
We often do the Hobbit thing of 2nd Breakfast. elevensees etc.  Here is my request.<br/>
I am looking for food ideas. <br/>
<br/>
First let me say that I am not real fond of being in the kitchen.<br/>
The kids seems to like different things and I end up being a short order cook on many days.<br/>
We have different eating styles as well.  Andrew, the early bird, is hungry right away and can eat anything (eggs, pancakes, French toast).  He does not like cereal cause he feels hungry soon after. (Actually, none of the kids do cereal.)  Jessica is slow to wake, slow to eat and more choosy.  Her favorite breakfast is chocolate chip cookies. These are usually left over from the night before.  Kerry will eat most things that are sweetish in the AM.like waffles, French toast, pancakes etc. No eggs for him.  He usually sleeps late.  One likes cream of wheat, the other oatmeal and the third neither.  They will all eat pancakes with chocolate chips so that is my only common denominator.<br/>
<br/>
So, with different tastes, schedules etc I need ideas.  Quick and easy, and certainly non-traditional ideas are welcome (especially those things that will &quot;stick to your ribs&quot;).  I have no creativity when it comes to food. <br/>
<br/>
Your help is appreciated.<br/>

<p><small><time> 7 May 2004, at  9:57am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128469992">I would suggest to start teaching these kids to cook their favorites!<br/>
My kids too have many different tastes, and they create their own breakfasts every morning.<br/>
They know how to make french toast, scrambled eggs (in the micro), and the usual breakfast type things.  Then sometimes they have leftovers from dinners.  This morning one of the boys is having &quot;astronaut food&quot; That is dried noodles in a styrofoam cup.  He can do that himself too.<br/>
<br/>
They are 11, 9 and 7(but I&#39;m almost eight!).  I&#39;m always nearby, so the use of the stove isn&#39;t an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of the kids would like to peruse the cookbooks at the library and find some ideas of things they would like to make.<br/>
On that idea, Molly Katzen has some wonderful cookbooks for kids.  Honest Pretzels and Pretend Soup.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is to think seasonally.  Right now strawberries are in season, and we are eating strawberries for every meal.  How many ways can you make strawberry shortcake anyway???  lol  Just wait until peaches get into season!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and happy cooking....(can you tell I love to cook?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305629835">Hi Beth,<br/>
<br/>
I can certainly sympathize, my three girls have different dietary needs and<br/>
schedules so all meal times can be challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Some ideas for breakfast that have worked for us.<br/>
<br/>
Make a large batch of :<br/>
<br/>
waffles<br/>
muffins<br/>
guick breads<br/>
donuts<br/>
bagels<br/>
<br/>
then freeze in individual wraps or packages. Easy to see, pull out and warm<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
Breakfast wraps. Wrap up scrambled eggs with various toppings in a soft<br/>
tortilla. A fun al a carte/ buffet breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
Fruit smoothies. Especially nice on really warm summer days.<br/>
<br/>
Hot cereal, oatmeal again with toppings. Such as fruit, maple syrup, jam ,<br/>
honey, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Make different pancakes. Favorites here are blueberry, banana and chocolate<br/>
chip.<br/>
<br/>
Quiche or oven egg bake with veggies.<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

things that will &quot;stick to your ribs&quot;).  I have no creativity when it comes<br/>
to food.<br/>
=====================================<br/>
<br/>
We do second breakfast here, too, but my kids are perfectly ammenable to<br/>
cold cereal for first breakfast. Then we do something bigger--eggs,<br/>
pancakes, waffles--for second breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
How &#39;bout getting yours more involved in making their own breakfast? I&#39;ll do<br/>
variations on a theme but generally not completely different breakfasts for<br/>
everyone. I&#39;m happy, for instance, to make eggs the way people like them and<br/>
give them whatever bread product they like best if we&#39;re doing eggs, but I<br/>
don&#39;t do eggs, waffles and french toast. Instead, we&#39;d make a compromise to<br/>
do everyone&#39;s favorites over a couple of days or something like that. Mine<br/>
are still pretty young (6, 5 and 4), so they can&#39;t really do the cooking for<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids *really* will only eat what they want and aren&#39;t up for<br/>
compromise, that sounds like a pretty tough situation. The best scenario<br/>
then would be for people to just make their own meal if no group meal can be<br/>
decided upon, I would think. Of course, you can always have toaster waffles<br/>
instead of fresh waffles. You and the interested child could make batches<br/>
once or twice a week to pull out and heat up if you wanted homemade. You<br/>
could keep batter in the fridge to just pull out and eliminate that step, at<br/>
least, for pancakes. Certainly, the kids ought to be able to make their own<br/>
oatmeal or cream of wheat, right?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re fond of bagels here, which you didn&#39;t mention. With cream cheese,<br/>
they&#39;re a complete protein and pretty filling. You can make egg sandwhiches<br/>
with bagels or english muffins--add a slice of cheese and bacon and they&#39;re<br/>
even tastier and more filling (imo). You could get those refridgerator<br/>
biscuits--grands or whatever--pull those out to make breakfast biscuit<br/>
sandwiches. We do cheese grits, which are very stick-to-your-ribs, but the<br/>
kids won&#39;t eat them--just dh and I. Hmmm... there are some really tasty egg<br/>
casseroles you can make up in advance and heat up during the week: scrambled<br/>
eggs, cheese and sausage is one of my favorites. You can also make up<br/>
breakfast burritoes in advance and put them in the freezer to pull out and<br/>
heat up individually. You could get the kids involved in making those things<br/>
too--kinda like having one big baking day. *shrug* That&#39;s all I can think of<br/>
right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133481086">Ok -- I have to say that I think that sounded like a zoombinis puzzle. <br/>
<br/>
My advice would be to premake stuff and have it on hand in the freezer.   Frozen waffles are fast and easy (we buy them, but you could make and freeze your own).  You can make pancakes or french toast in advance and reheat in the toaster or toaster oven also.  In the summer we also like frozen popsicles that we make out of juices or juice/yoghurt or juice/fruit/nutbutters.  Homemade granola is easy to have on hand.  Do you eat quick oats or steel cut?  For steel cut, you can put it on in the crockpot overnight and have it ready (and keeping hot) for whoever wants it all morning.  Quick oats/ cream of wheat are fast to make with water boiled in the microwave in a cup with a pour spout.  Boil some eggs (if your kids like them) and keep them in the refrigerator (they keep for at least a week). <br/>
<br/>
For breakfast recently, I have been eating either (1) plain yoghurt with garam masala, cinnamon, a little maple syrup and a handful of &quot;raw&quot; quick oats or (2) little balls made of almond butter, fig spread, cocoa and oats.  Very tasty with coffee, btw.   Both quick and stick-to-ribsy. <br/>

  Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
  What I love about our lifestyle is the freedom to eat when and what we want.<br/>
  We often do the Hobbit thing of 2nd Breakfast. elevensees etc.  Here is my request.<br/>
  I am looking for food ideas. <br/>

Definitely &quot;stick to your ribs&quot; type of food.  The sugar addiction is <br/>
hard to break however.  Honey, maple syrup, sorghum are used often <br/>
here, and sometimes a little sugar.  In particular I like lots of <br/>

issue...hydrogenated fats and store flour are the usual culprits.  <br/>
Store milk is also not good for people-see above web site. (I&#39;m also a <br/>
part-time dairy farmer).  Grain should be bought whole.  One family I <br/>
know well  is all sensitive to flour (store), but they all can eat <br/>
fresh ground flour (the spoilage in fresh flour causes sensitivities or <br/>
allergies)<br/>

Did you know that pancakes and such freeze well?  If I&#39;m going to make a <br/>
batch, I always make more and then freeze the leftovers in small serving size <br/>
bundles for the day that I&#39;ve just made something for one child and an hour later <br/>
another wants pancakes and I have to be somewhere in half hour.  I can just <br/>
take them out and reheat in the  microwave and they have those pancakes, whether <br/>
chocolate chip, blueberry or plain.<br/>
<br/>
There is also the instant packages of oatmeal and such, which helps out some <br/>
and comes in lots of flavors.<br/>
<br/>
One of my kids favorites and can be made the night before during kitchen <br/>
clean up is muffin cups.  You take your stale bread (probably works the same with <br/>
fresh) cut the crusts off, butter both sides, ( a pastry brush is good for <br/>
this) put it into a sprayed muffin tin, then add a slice of ham (or turkey or <br/>
whatever) crack an egg on top, then sprinkle shredded cheese on top.  You can <br/>
cover and store them in the fridge and then pull them out to bake in the AM.  If <br/>
your child isn&#39;t a big egg eater, you can either skip the egg, or what mine <br/>
likes is for me to slightly scramble the egg part by breaking up the yolk and <br/>
mixing it well with cheese.  <br/>
<br/>
Also a quiche is easy to make and easy to eat and reheat at different times.  <br/>
Pizza for breakfast is big around here too and this week, chocolate cake has <br/>
been the favorite!<br/>

<br/>
I never knew about steel cut oats until recently and they are great! <br/>
It&#39;s very important to me to get protein in the morning, plus some <br/>
fiber helps keep me from being hungry an hour later. So oats, esp. <br/>
steel cut (also called Irish oats) mixed with yogurt is great. I also <br/>
eat a ton of Kashi cereal because of the protein and fiber.<br/>

<br/>
Me, too! All of my former co-workers thought I was crazy, but every <br/>
morning at work, I&#39;d mix my oats into my yogurt and be good for the <br/>
morning. It beat my previous routine of needing to raise my blood <br/>
sugar with M&Ms at 10:30 every day!<br/>
<br/>
My son goes grocery shopping with dh and they always come home <br/>
with &quot;dinosaur oatmeal&quot; which is instant oatmeal with tons of sugar <br/>
and dinosaur eggs that hatch...and Sponge Bob strawberry waffles. I&#39;m <br/>
learning to keep my mouth shut about it and think about how great it <br/>
is that Mikey is learning that food is fun. Tis better for all of us <br/>
for me to smile about it, but it&#39;s a tough change for me.<br/>

saying to soak overnight...Breaks down helpful phytates and makes <br/>
nutrients more usable to the body.  They are then fast to cook in the <br/>
am.<br/>
Soak at room temperature.  I cover with a bread rising towel.<br/>
Water is better than nothing<br/>
Best to soak in homemade buttermilk or whey (made from raw milk)<br/>
I soak all my grains over night for making cookies, breads, etc.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I guess it depends somewhat on the ages of the kids. Mine are 7 and 4 <br/>
years old. Either one of them can get and pour cereal, make toast, or <br/>
dish up yogurt for themselves. The 7 year old can make pancakes by <br/>
himself, but likes for me to operate the waffle iron. If we make <br/>
pancakes or waffles, we usually mix up a double or triple batch. Put <br/>
the leftovers in baggies in the freezer, then either kid can heat one <br/>
up in the microwave if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
Ditto with oatmeal, make a big batch and put the rest in the fridge. <br/>
I like mine with shredded coconut and pecans or walnuts. My daughter <br/>
likes hers with diced apples and cinnamon. Son likes his plain.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids like &quot;Egg shapes&quot; - make a thinnish flat omelette and <br/>
use cookie cutters to cut it into fun shapes.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids like &quot;special eggs&quot; - we got this recipe from the <br/>
Sample Lady at Trader Joe&#39;s (my kids love the sample lady):<br/>
In a bowl, scramble eggs with milk (1 Tbs per egg). Add a scoop of <br/>
sun-dried tomato pesto and stir until mixed. Scramble eggs like <br/>
normal. When they&#39;re just about done, crumble feta cheese in and let <br/>
melt (My note: sheep&#39;s milk feta cheese is awesome, very smooth and <br/>
mild. Cow&#39;s milk feta tastes like old sweat socks to me. So if you or <br/>
your kids think you don&#39;t like feta, try the sheep&#39;s milk kind). <br/>
Garnish with chives. We grow our own chives and the kids love to take <br/>
scissors and cut them up into garnish-sized pieces.<br/>
<br/>
I like any kind of wrap made with scrambled eggs. Like:<br/>
 - Monterey Jack, bacon, and guacamole<br/>
 - Spicy sausage, cheddar, and salsa<br/>
 - Mushrooms, spinach, and Asiago cheese<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I can think of right now. I used to be a Hobbit-breakfast <br/>
person when I ate cereal or more carbs for breakfast. Now I&#39;ve been <br/>
trying a higher protein breakfast and find that I&#39;m not hungry an <br/>
hour or two later like I used to be.<br/>
