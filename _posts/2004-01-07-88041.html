Seems to me one of the etiquette ladies, maybe Miss Manners, said there&#39;s no<br/>
need to write a thank you note if you&#39;ve said thank you in person.<br/>
<br/>
Might be worth finding her book and copying the page! ;-)<br/>

I think this is the standard view.  In any event, Peggy Post (daughter-in-law and heir to Emily) says this in her book.  I have it around somewhere, I&#39;ll send you a copy of the page if you want.  A useful use of experts. lol <br/>

who are not so close to us for things (in person or in notes) but <br/>
sometimes we forget to a. thank those who are closest to us for things <br/>
we often take for granted and also to be thankful for the things we <br/>
have.  It&#39;s easy to go to someone elses house and see all THEY have that <br/>
YOU don&#39;t.  It&#39;s harder to look into our own lives and see how very rich <br/>
we are, even if it&#39;s not in the traditional way of being rich.  I don&#39;t <br/>
really make my kids write thank you&#39;s, but it&#39;s also not really <br/>
optional, it&#39;s just something that is done in our home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84830799">&lt;&lt; I&#39;m probably in the very minority here, but I think thank you notes are <br/>
important.  I did ask my kids to write notes to their grandma and to <br/>
Aunt Julie.  At girl scouts we talked about how we often thank people <br/>
who are not so close to us for things (in person or in notes) but <br/>
sometimes we forget. . . &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even before we had kids, Keith and I have always said &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank <br/>
you&quot; to the people around us.  When people give my kids gifts, they tend toward <br/>
effusion (&quot;This is so cool!  Thanks!  Let&#39;s go try it out right now!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
While I like to get thank you notes from adults, and am usually surprised and <br/>
grateful for them (instead of thinking &quot;Yeah, I earned this, and it&#39;s about <br/>
time,&quot; as some people seem to be about them), when I get one from a child I <br/>
always hope it didn&#39;t come under pressure and threat, because then I&#39;m afraid <br/>
they&#39;ve spent some time thinking negatively about me and the gift, and that it <br/>
might keep them from seeing writing as a fun thing.<br/>
<br/>
For kids who write pretty well and who really like the person they&#39;re writing <br/>
too, some of those objections would fall.<br/>
