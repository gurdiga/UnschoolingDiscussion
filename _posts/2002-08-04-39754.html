One more option -- Change DOVE (the bird) to DUV -- that&#39;s the way a child<br/>
would spell it, with perfect phonetic logic. (We&#39;re trying to solve problems<br/>
here, right?) <br/>
<br/>
In fairness to all, I think that because of usage (or evolution, if you<br/>
will), dove has come to be an acceptable (or accepted) form for the past<br/>
tense of dive. However, the discussion was about trying to make English<br/>
easier to learn. So in working with the list of sentences that included<br/>
words with two pronunciations for the same spelling, my purpose was to try<br/>
to make changes that would avoid confusions. Hey, if the language evolved,<br/>
and is still evolving, then we might as well participate...sure, this egroup<br/>
could go a long way to simplifying the language. We could make history,<br/>
right here, by ELIMINATING -- once and for all -- ALL IRREGULARITIES.<br/>
Children do it often, but they get *educated* out of much of their logical<br/>
usage.   So it&#39;s duv, right?<br/>
<br/>
Remember the book, a homeschooling classic: GNYS AT WRK (Genius At Work).<br/>
<br/>
I have long been bolstered by a book by the man whom many called the<br/>
smartest man in the world, Richard P. Feynman. His best known book is<br/>
called,  WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK?<br/>
