<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726873736">&quot;When my son gets loud and swears because he is being cool or gets <br/>
angry, the following process takes place:<br/>
     - fear<br/>
     - shame<br/>
     - anger<br/>
then:<br/>
     - I want to control him so I won&#39;t feel what I&#39;m feeling&quot;<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for the share, Tony.  I can relate.  The only problem is that the feeling is still there irregardless.  The key is to interrupt the Pavlovian response between the feeling and the thinking because thinking doesn&#39;t fix it.  I try to keep my awareness in my body where I can feel the tension and not on my thinking. I treat my thoughts in those situations as word bubbles, like from cartoons.  I don&#39;t grab them as they float by. <br/>
 <br/>
Thinking is addictive.  &quot;Just one more thought, then I&#39;ll have the answer, I&#39;ll solve the problem.&quot;  &quot;Just one more&quot; is the battle cry of the addict (I know from whence I speak, of course!)  It has never worked.  The only way out is right straight on through. <br/>
 <br/>
If I concentrate on fully experiencing the emotion, it evaporates.  It&#39;s that simple.  It&#39;s difficult to accept the process because it&#39;s so simple.  It&#39;s much easier intellectually to make it someone else&#39;s fault and keep doing what we&#39;ve always done.  When it becomes painful enough then we become willing to try some other way.<br/>

Actually, I&#39;ve had this work for me when I&#39;ve experienced emotional <br/>
triggers that made me feel like eating.  If I can just tolerate feeling <br/>
the emotion, which often doesn&#39;t last much more than a minute, the <br/>
desire to stuff food in my mouth goes away.  (Not if I&#39;m actually <br/>
hungry, but when I&#39;m only upset.)<br/>
