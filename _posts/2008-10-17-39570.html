Join unschooling families from around the country for a fun filled week at America&#39;s largest indoor waterpark in Sandusky, Ohio February 2-6, 2009.  <br/>

We&#39;ve now added a Winter Carnival as our kick-off event for Monday evening!  We&#39;ll have lots of fun arcade type games, face painting, stage for on-going comical/musical acts, etc...  It seems like the perfect way to have everyone start to get to know each other in a fun and casual atmosphere!<br/>
