<div id="ygrps-yiv-499722022">I&#39;m speaking in Hawaii (Oahu) on Friday and Saturday next week (once<br/>
for the Hawaii Home Ed. Association <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hawaiihomeschoolassociation.org">http://www.hawaiihomeschoolassociation.org</a><br/>
<br/>
and once at the Honolulu Friends Meeting), and was wondering if there<br/>
are any folks from Oahu on this list -- I always look forward to<br/>
putting faces with names, but I don&#39;t recognize any of you as being<br/>
from there (wish we had a map for everyone!) (you can e-mail me<br/>
privately if you like.)<br/>
