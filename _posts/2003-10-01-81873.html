<div id="ygrps-yiv-499492695">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Okay, before I posted too soon but this time I really have been on the group <br/>
for a week or so. &lt;g&gt;  And I&#39;ve been reading to get a feel for what <br/>
unschooling looks like, feels like -- to let my mind sift through it all and see what it <br/>
comes up with.  And what it has come up with is a question:  how are things <br/>
for your family on the social interaction front?<br/>
<br/>
My six-year-old is in first grade in a charter school, and he does say he <br/>
wants to unschool.  But every time we talk about &quot;how was your day?&quot; he has <br/>
positive things to say, especially about his friends.  It kind of feels like I&#39;m <br/>
trying to fix something that ain&#39;t broke -- I&#39;m nervous that I would pull him <br/>
out of school (losing his place at the charter, since they have a long waiting <br/>
list), and then he&#39;d hate it.  I think he would really miss playing with <br/>
friends during the day.  And when we have friends over, they tend to draw him into <br/>
things he&#39;s not as inclined to do by himself, such as play outside or play with <br/>
his pirate ship.<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking along the lines of starting an unschooling/homeschooling <br/>
co-op, where I trade off days with one or two families.  This would give me <br/>
time to write (I&#39;m trying to finish a novel, and I have to admit that it&#39;s much <br/>
easier to write when he&#39;s at school) and would give others to interact with <br/>
when and if he wanted to do so.  Or they could just hang out and do their own t<br/>
hing.  Does anyone have experience with or ideas about that?  <br/>
<br/>
I also think about making a business of it and starting a Sudbury Valley <br/>
school (http://www.sudval.org/ or http://www.sudburynetwork.org) which is <br/>
unschooling a bunch of kids, all ages above 4, in one big house with lots of grounds <br/>
to explore.  The benefit is that they hold a Student Meeting which makes all <br/>
school decisions -- including hiring and firing the teachers -- and get to <br/>
participate in democracy in action.  My husband&#39;s making noises about returning to <br/>
grad school, so I may need to fall back on this as an income source.<br/>
<br/>
Just some more info -- I do have one other child, but he&#39;s 4 months old -- <br/>
won&#39;t be a great playmate for Fisher for a while yet.  &lt;g&gt;  And if any one is <br/>
interested in joining one of these ventures, I&#39;m in Grand Rapids, MI.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks (in advance) for your input.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437221476">&lt;&lt; And what it has come up with is a question:  how are things <br/>
for your family on the social interaction front?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before the kids were &quot;school age,&quot; we were in a La Leche League-related (not <br/>
formally related, but based on those families) babysitting co-op and <br/>
playgroup.   The playgroup continued and became a homeschooling group, gradually, as <br/>
some of the LLL families sent kids to school, and other homeschooling families <br/>
found us.   Some of those kids are still in our lives.   Marty is over moving <br/>
furniture for one of those families right now, come to think of it!<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were younger, I took them out to where other kids were at least <br/>
once a week, or had a group of kids over.  We&#39;d find excuses for back-yard <br/>
play (wading pools and sprinklers were very popular with that group for a while, <br/>
and we had a good yard with a big concrete slab and good lawn in those days).<br/>
<br/>
Now they&#39;re older and they have friends who are schooled and some <br/>
homeschooled.  They find their friends from hobbies, mostly.  Friends of friends, and <br/>
their circles grow.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  And when we have friends over, they tend to draw him into <br/>
things he&#39;s not as inclined to do by himself, such as play outside or play <br/>
with <br/>
his pirate ship. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of hours in the week.  It doesn&#39;t have to be just during <br/>
daytimes that he has friends.  And school is in session 180 days, which leaves <br/>
more daytimes when school  kids ARE available than not.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that after a while you&#39;ll find irritations with kids who are <br/>
still in school, but at this age, it would be a way to wean him from that group <br/>
gradually instead of just cutting ties.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have been thinking along the lines of starting an <br/>
unschooling/homeschooling <br/>
co-op, where I trade off days with one or two families. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you just call it &quot;trading days&quot; or something less structured that <br/>
any-schooling co-op, there will be less to negotiate (fight) about.<br/>
<br/>
Even just having another child over will give you more time.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I also think about making a business of it and starting a Sudbury Valley <br/>
school (http://www.sudval.org/ or http://www.sudburynetwork.org) which is <br/>
unschooling a bunch of kids, all ages above 4, in one big house with lots of <br/>
grounds <br/>
to explore. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s running an alternative school.<br/>
It&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My husband&#39;s making noises about returning to <br/>
grad school, so I may need to fall back on this as an income source.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nearly impossible to make money with a private school on your own terms. <br/>
 And when people pay money, they want proofs/results, something.  The schools <br/>
which have survived a while have drawn students from far away--boarding <br/>
school situations.<br/>
<br/>
Having other kids over will have lots of benefits, and if you meet another <br/>
family with more than one child, having yours there might be a great benefit for <br/>
them!<br/>
<br/>
There are other families that really like having Holly, because she changes <br/>
the dynamics and tensions of their two or three kids.   I used to borrow <br/>
singular male children to mix with my two boys, same reason.<br/>

I forgot to say that for a six year old the question would be better put <br/>
&quot;Would you rather be home than at school?&quot;  If kids are home against their will, <br/>
it can be as bad as a child being in school against his will.<br/>
<br/>
(Not all homeschoolers agree with me.  I&#39;m putting on my little helmet.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d seriously look at that. You&#39;ve got too many goals mixed in there. If you<br/>
want to create a coop then your goal needs to be creating a great experience<br/>
for the kids, not a free time to write.<br/>
<br/>
Call it a regularly scheduled playdate and there won&#39;t be expectations<br/>
beyond the kids playing.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is time to write, then you need to remember that he needs to<br/>
know that his needs are more important than writing, for no matter how much<br/>
you love him and tell him he&#39;s number one, if your actions are often saying<br/>
he&#39;s interfering with what you really want to do, he&#39;s going to get the idea<br/>
that he&#39;s second to writing in your life.<br/>
<br/>
Some writers find time to write late at night or early in the morning.<br/>
Another idea is a weekly night out while your husband is at home with your<br/>
son at the library or maybe Barnes and Noble where you can curl up with a<br/>
cup of coffee and a laptop.<br/>
<br/>
Or playdates with other kids. I certainly find time to do computer stuff<br/>
whether my daughter is here or off at a friends.<br/>

there&#39;s a lot of stuff that it isn&#39;t occuring to you that will need to be<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
I think Sudbury Valley schools are great ideas. But great ideas for people<br/>
whose goal is to open a Sudbury Valley school, not someone whose goal is to<br/>
make money or free up her time or bring in playmates for her son.<br/>

carefully.  But isn&#39;t it also advantageous to kids when they see adults doing <br/>
their own work?  I&#39;ve always thought of my writing as a positive model for Fisher <br/>
-- he knows my writing group very well and often writes stories or draws <br/>
pictures for them when he knows that it&#39;s my week to host.  My writing and our <br/>
writing together really taps into an openness that allows us to have *great* <br/>
talks.  I already do write late at night or early in the morning, but the daytime <br/>
hours are great for revising, really figuring out the shape of plot and <br/>
character -- doing the big work of a novel.  I keep thinking there&#39;s some way to <br/>
strike a balance -- after all, doesn&#39;t unschooling have some historical roots in <br/>
life before schools, when kids learned from the adults around them as the <br/>
adults went about their normal day&#39;s work?<br/>
<br/>
Also, both you and Sandra (sorry, Sandra, I lost your email before responding <br/>
to it) had a different reaction to the word &quot;co-op&quot; than I did.  What is your <br/>
definition of an unschooling co-op?<br/>
<br/>
Your responses are really helping me to think this through -- thanks for <br/>
working with me!<br/>

<br/>
In homeschooling co-ops one person will &#39;teach math&#39; and another teaches <br/>
English, but if the families are unschooling what do they need a co-op for?   <br/>
<br/>
If your kids are staying at someone else&#39;s house part of the time, great!<br/>
If they&#39;re staying with unschoolers, better still!<br/>

just rotated between homes.  The host would *offer* what they thought was a <br/>
fun activity or two, like building a geodesic dome with newspapers or <br/>
something.  Usually the kids took part and liked it, but they could do <br/>
something else if they wanted.  And the parents stayed and did stuff with <br/>
the kids.<br/>
