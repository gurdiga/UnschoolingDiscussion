&gt; E-MAIL WRITING CAMPAIGN FOR HOMESCHOOLER&#39;S RIGHTS IN SWEDEN<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear Homeschoolers around the world,&lt;?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = O NS =<br/>
&gt; &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are a homeschooling family in Sweden with three children 6, 10, and<br/>
&gt; 12 who are having big problems with the local school<br/>
&gt; authorities. We are now facing a fine of 40 000 skr ($4500/£ 2700) if we<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t send our children to school right away. We are not<br/>
&gt; asking for your money, but rather for your help in emailing the<br/>
&gt; authorities in Sweden and asking them to withdraw the fines and let<br/>
&gt; people homeschool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the meantime we have been forced to flee our home to another school<br/>
&gt; district within Sweden where they hopefully are more<br/>
&gt; tolerant of homeschooling. But we miss our home and our life, and we<br/>
&gt; want to move back to our farm. And we are not alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Friends of ours have already had to move within Sweden. Homeschooling is<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; legal in Sweden and we have the same laws for the<br/>
&gt; whole country but they are just not interpreted in the same way in every<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; legal district. So people have to move to different parts of<br/>
&gt; Sweden because of their beliefs. Other homeschooling friends of ours<br/>
&gt; have just fled to the UK since they didn&#39;t feel safe in their own<br/>
&gt; home. We miss them a lot already.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Swedish Minister of Education has just, in a TV program, expressed<br/>
&gt; that she wants to make it even more difficult to<br/>
&gt; homeschool in Sweden in the future by changing the laws. This will mean<br/>
&gt; that we will see more refugees from Sweden because of<br/>
&gt; their beliefs as the interest for homeschooling increases.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So what we are asking you about is your support in helping us to protect<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; our right to homeschool in Sweden, and to guarantee every<br/>
&gt; Swedish child the right to homeschool if they desire, now and forever.<br/>
&gt; Please help the Sweden authorities understand that<br/>
&gt; homeschooling is an excellent way of educating children and that you are<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; aware of the persecution of homeschoolers in Sweden.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Below is a list of people or places you could email on our behalf with<br/>
&gt; some suggestions what to write about. A short but personal<br/>
&gt; note to one or all of them below is perhaps best. Please express your<br/>
&gt; feelings in a friendly and non-aggressive fashion. In all<br/>
&gt; messages please include something like:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;In Vingaker in Sweden, the Berkestam-Drysen family is being persecuted<br/>
&gt; for homeschooling. The school authorities are Barn- och<br/>
&gt; utbildningsnamnden, Box 133, 643 22 VINGAKER, SWEDEN. Please contact<br/>
&gt; them and ask them to withdraw their fines and let the<br/>
&gt; family live in peace in their home and according to their beliefs about<br/>
&gt; schooling.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You could write to the Swedish Minister of Education - Ingegerd<br/>
&gt; Wärnersson : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:registrator@...">registrator@...</a> and ask her to<br/>
&gt; please respect Fundamental Human Rights when they pass a new law on<br/>
&gt; homeschooling so that Swedish citizens don&#39;t have to be<br/>
&gt; persecuted and forced to flee due to their beliefs. Why not tell her<br/>
&gt; that homeschooling is rapidly growing worldwide, and that passing<br/>
&gt; laws that forbid homeschooling will just make more conflicts in the<br/>
&gt; future?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You could write to the Swedish Embassy in your country saying something<br/>
&gt; like &ldquo;why isn&rsquo;t Sweden respecting the<br/>
&gt; parents right to educate their children the way they see fit?<br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers are forced to be fugitives, fleeing their homes to avoid<br/>
&gt; further harassment by the authorities in Sweden.&rdquo; If you<br/>
&gt; don&rsquo;t get a reply, email them again and ask why they are not<br/>
&gt; replying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Swedish Embassy in the US: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ambassaden.washington@...">ambassaden.washington@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; , in UK is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:embassy@...">embassy@...</a> , Australia<br/>
&gt; and New Zealand is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ambassaden.canberra@...">ambassaden.canberra@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You could write to one of the major Swedish News papers telling them<br/>
&gt; what you think when a democratic country like Sweden is<br/>
&gt; violating individual&rsquo;s Human Rights in this way. Tell them that<br/>
&gt; homeschooling is growing around the world, and it&rsquo;s<br/>
&gt; part of the solution to problems in society, not one of the problems.<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:joachim.berner@...">joachim.berner@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Contact our local politicians and ask them to respect Human Rights and<br/>
&gt; to act in a more human and understanding way. Ask them<br/>
&gt; to withdraw their fines and work for a solution in respect of our<br/>
&gt; beliefs. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kommunstyrelsen@...">kommunstyrelsen@...</a> (Kommun in Swedish means<br/>
&gt; municipality).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You could also send the above message to our local newspaper. It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; small paper and they would probably appreciate getting this<br/>
&gt; kind of attention from the big world. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:redaktion@...">redaktion@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If there are any questions or if we can be of any assistance for other<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers in any way please contact us at<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:magnus.drysen@...">magnus.drysen@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your time and support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We love homeschooling!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Magnus Drysén & Maria Berkestam<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. Please pass this message on to as many other homeschoolers and<br/>
&gt; other people who you think could be of assistance to us in<br/>
&gt; anyway in this matter. We are sending this message to homeschoolers in<br/>
&gt; Sweden, USA, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Norway,<br/>
&gt; Australia and New Zealand<br/>
