&gt; I remember Skipper, Barbie&#39;s sad little flat, flat cousin (?) .  I always<br/>
&gt; was afraid poor skipper would grow up to be a serial killer, having those<br/>
&gt; huge bosoms flaunted at her all the time.  And what kind of name is that,<br/>
&gt; Skipper?  Poor thing. <br/>

brothers would have abused her.  Twisting a girls arm to make her breasts<br/>
grow?  Sounds like someone with deep psychological problems thought that<br/>
one up.  Do you think it would work for me?  ; )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489476326">I used to have one of those! At the time (aged 8, I<br/>
believe) I thought it was so cool! Now I think, how<br/>
sick and I&#39;m lucky I didn&#39;t get a breast complex ( I<br/>
was always small breasted until I had a child)!<br/>
My dd got a PREGNANT barbie for her 5th birthday! It&#39;s<br/>
actually one of those generic barbies. Her large belly<br/>
pops off and there&#39;s a baby inside (upside down). Then<br/>
you push on the edge of the inside of her belly (after<br/>
the baby&#39;s been taken out) and a new (spring loaded!),<br/>
flat belly pops into the hole where baby came out! Oh,<br/>
if only it were so simple. Of course, she got this in<br/>
the UK. I can&#39;t imagine anywhere in the US stocking a<br/>
pregnant barbie.<br/>

missing A LOT of aspects of the UK)<br/>
