<div id="ygrps-yiv-746040215">That is very funny...<br/>
<br/>
When they call me I say to them &quot;hold on a minute before you tell me what you <br/>
are offering I&#39;ll tell you what I want.&quot;  I then proceed to tell them &quot;I want <br/>
4 cents a minute to the United Kingdom 24 hours a day 7 days a week and 2 <br/>
cents a minute to anywhere else in the USA.&quot;  Usually the stunned script <br/>
speaker doesn&#39;t know what to say. So they go straight to their script and <br/>
start in with &quot;We are offering 10 cents a minute.....&quot;  I cut them off &quot;Maybe <br/>
you didn&#39;t hear what I said&quot; I say... &quot;I want... &quot;and I repeat the whole <br/>
thing again... They really have no idea how to deal with me... I then tell <br/>
them that of course they can give me this if they want to, it&#39;s their company <br/>
and they make the rules so if they want my business they will give me what I <br/>
want... I tell them to call me when they have considered my offer and then I <br/>
hang up.... I get a lot of fun out of this one.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I do (when I&#39;m not too annoyed is)<br/>
<br/>
Me: Hello<br/>
Sales Person :  Can I speak to Mrs. Flalbeidbemdiddjdjng (no that&#39;s no my <br/>
name, but they never pronounce it right and so I know they are sales people <br/>
and no body calls me Mrs anything in this day and age)<br/>
Me:  Yes can I help you...<br/>
Sales Person:  I wanted to tell you about......<br/>
Me:  Let me ask you something:  If you didn&#39;t have to think about earning <br/>
money, paying bills etc what you would do for a career?  Something you <br/>
absolutely love and would do for free? (this is something I use with all my <br/>
clients)<br/>
Sales Person:  Um... (and then they tell me and it&#39;s totally different from <br/>
making annoying calls to people)<br/>
Me:  So why aren&#39;t you doing that and you can&#39;t use money as an excuse?<br/>
Sales Person:  Start to think and then start to give me an answer to my <br/>
question.  When there is a pause in their speaking I tell them what I do and <br/>
tell them to take down my telephone number, tell them how much I charge per <br/>
hour and what they can get from me to enhance and change their lives.  I then <br/>
thank them for their time and hangup.   LOL LOL LOL LOL  I&#39;m very funny if I <br/>
may say so myself.....<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of things I thought would bring light and levity to the group.<br/>

a great telesales tool of it&#39;s own &lt;g&gt;  We got so many calls for <br/>
someone who wasn&#39;t us after we moved, someone had had the <br/>
same number before, didn&#39;t live here (it&#39;s a new house) I got very <br/>
skilful with my, &#39;this number doesn&#39;t belong to mrs......... <br/>

just want them to start thinking about what they are doing with their lives <br/>
