Please don&#39;t chit chat on this list.  Lists of ideas are great.   <br/>
Quoting two full posts isn&#39;t.  Saying &quot;ooh golly that looks fun&quot;  <br/>
isn&#39;t good.<br/>
<br/>
If we had twelve people on the list we could all talk about what our  <br/>
dogs are doing and what&#39;s for dinner, but PLEASE stay to topic, make  <br/>
your posts useful to lots of people, and don&#39;t forget there are way  <br/>
over 1000 readers.<br/>

<br/>
Speaking of dogs. &lt;grin&gt;  I don&#39;t post often these days but this spring I<br/>
posted on a topic about a child wanting a dog when the parent wasn&#39;t ready<br/>
yet.  I was against getting a dog until the whole family was committed<br/>
because you are dealing with an animal&#39;s life and there are so many dogs<br/>
that are neglected because it was more work than a family expected.  I still<br/>
stand by all that I said about it being a family decision because it&#39;s a<br/>
huge decision that affects the whole family and ultimately a dog&#39;s life.<br/>
Anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
It was shortly after that post that my husband decided that he was once<br/>
again ready to have a dog in the family.  I had been ready for a while but I<br/>
needed it to be a family decision.  It had been 9 years since we had had a<br/>
dog.  We now have a lovely puppy named Archie.  We got him June 1st.  He is<br/>
a black lab and he is a LOT of work but we all pitch together to care for<br/>
him and because everyone agreed and was willing and everyone loves him, he<br/>
gets all the care he deserves.  I walk him every morning.  The kids walk him<br/>
periodically.  The kids or I play ball with him whenever he gets wound up.<br/>
And we all enjoy his snuggles and loving.  My husband enjoys him too and he<br/>
will feel safer leaving us home alone when he travels for work (which he<br/>
does a lot) as soon as he is fully grown.  (And my don&#39;t they grown fast!)  <br/>
<br/>
I am so glad we said yes but I am also very glad we waited until it was the<br/>
right time for our family.  We have 2 horses, 2 rabbits, 2 cats, and now a<br/>
dog.  I love all of our animals but there is just something special about a<br/>
dog because they want to be with you so much.  We are his pack.  :-)  We are<br/>
avid Dog Whisperer watchers and we have learned so much about dog psychology<br/>
that we didn&#39;t know back when we had our last dog.  It&#39;s been a fun journey.<br/>

<br/>
Just wondering...what happens if one of the children doesn&#39;t do anything to<br/>
take care of the dog? Or numerous don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
I remember your original post about this issue months ago, and as I recall,<br/>
you wanted agreement that everyone would help. If you are still standing by<br/>
the idea that everyone has to agree to partake in the care taking, I&#39;m<br/>
really interested in what happens if it plays out that they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I take care of our dogs for days at a time...feeding, watering,<br/>
etc., and my kids are all older teenagers. Someone always takes care of the<br/>
dogs, and it is usually one of the kids, but they are very involved in<br/>
outside things in general right now, and there are times when they aren&#39;t<br/>
here much. And sometimes they are here and beat, or catching up with a show,<br/>
or some such thing. Since I&#39;m not trying to catch up on a show, or beat, I<br/>
happily take care of it. I don&#39;t say, &quot;It&#39;s your turn&quot;...in fact, I can&#39;t<br/>
ever remember saying that. I may say, &quot;Would you please feed the dogs?&quot; if<br/>
I&#39;ve got something else going on. And most every time the reply will be yes.<br/>
But if it wasn&#39;t, I would ask someone else, feed them later, or just do it<br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone feels supported and respected in this family. And from that<br/>
place, they take good care of the dogs most of the time. There is no<br/>
schedule, no duty that has to be done by a particular person at a particular<br/>
time (though if they wanted to do it that way for predictability reasons,<br/>
that would be fine too). I&#39;m the one to make sure the jobs are done everyday<br/>
by someone.<br/>
<br/>
If I am mis-remembering the post of months ago, my apologies. It&#39;s still a<br/>
great subject though!<br/>

 I think everyone feels supported and respected in this family. And from<br/>
that<br/>
place, they take good care of the dogs most of the time. There is no<br/>
schedule, no duty that has to be done by a particular person at a particular<br/>

that would be fine too). I&#39;m the one to make sure the jobs are done everyday<br/>
by someone.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Everyone in my family also feels supported and respected and in return they<br/>
generally respond in a like manner.  My kids aren&#39;t that little anymore and<br/>
they&#39;ve always been unschooled without the forced chores or random rules.<br/>
They are almost 12 & 14.  They are used to taking care of their animals<br/>
because we&#39;ve had horses for 4 years and cats and rabbits (off and on) for<br/>
as long as they can remember and they&#39;ve always participated in their care<br/>
because they enjoy it. (notice I said participated in, not took full<br/>
responsibility) They understood when we got the dog what kind of work it<br/>
entailed because they already shared in some big responsibilities with our<br/>
other animals.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I also knew that they were still kids and that they are often busy<br/>
and I knew the brunt of the responsibility would fall on me and I am willing<br/>
to do that because I really wanted a dog.  I didn&#39;t get the dog with the<br/>
impression that the kids had the whole responsibility to care for him and<br/>
they knew that.  They knew it would be a family thing and not once yet, (3.5<br/>
months) have they not gotten up from whatever they were doing and taken the<br/>
dog outside when I&#39;ve asked.  <br/>
<br/>
Having a dog inspires me to walk every day and sometimes one or both come<br/>
with me and often I walk him alone.  It&#39;s something I enjoy and I knew that<br/>
I would enjoy that going into it.  Occasionally the girls walk him alone but<br/>
less often since he was attacked by a dog.<br/>
<br/>
So, like you, there aren&#39;t certain responsibilities that they must do but<br/>
because they feel supported and respected and they did agree to help with<br/>
the work it takes to have a dog, they do it with a good attitude.  They love<br/>
him!<br/>
<br/>
I also enjoy mucking the horse&#39;s stalls and I do that most of the time while<br/>
Leigh my cat lover feeds the cats because she likes to.  Both girls take<br/>
care of the rabbits although my younger dd needs more reminding than my<br/>
older.  Both girls share in all the horse responsibilities but I muck much<br/>
more often than they do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375837976">I was having a dog conversation just yesterday with Holly&#39;s  <br/>
boyfriend.   Holly  housesat for friends of ours who have four dogs.   <br/>
I&#39;ve known the dad of that family since he in his late teens.  (The  <br/>
mom since her mid-teens, come to think of it, but I knew them  <br/>
separately and they weren&#39;t even in the same town.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known every dog he ever had, though I don&#39;t know the current  <br/>
ones as well as I knew earlier ones.  What I DO know is that the dogs  <br/>
are crazed, untrained, desperate for attention and destructive.  And  <br/>
they have a new dog who&#39;s chewing things up--books, dishes...   So  <br/>
Holly needed to stay there 24 hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
Her boyfriend was there with her a lot of the time, which made me  <br/>
feel better about her being in a big house with the owners clearly  <br/>
gone.   But he was talking about how the dogs are.<br/>
<br/>
By contrast, our dog is mellow and will guard the front door, but if  <br/>
we tell her someone&#39;s fine, she calms down.  Occasionally she&#39;ll nip  <br/>
at the heels of a male visitor if he&#39;s walking fast or she&#39;d rather  <br/>
he&#39;d leave, but she&#39;s never bitten for real.  Our cats adore her and  <br/>
one is usually lying touching her if she&#39;s lying down.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe our dog is a genius and understands English.  I don&#39;t think  <br/>
so.  Marty dropped out of puppy training because he didn&#39;t like their  <br/>
rough methods.  We&#39;ve just treated the dog gently and sweetly and let  <br/>
her know what wasn&#39;t okay to do.<br/>
<br/>
Our next door neighbors never say anything decent to their dogs.   <br/>
They yell at them all the time, so the dogs bark at other people all  <br/>
the time, and then the people yell at them more and the dogs bark more.<br/>
<br/>
At the house where Holly was, the dogs have medications, and have to  <br/>
be fed separately and given pills and the food is measured.<br/>
<br/>
She has housesat other dogs.  The less food she&#39;s instructed to give  <br/>
them, the worse the dogs behave.  Those who have more food are  <br/>
calmer.  Our dog, calmest of them all, has all the dogfood and  <br/>
catfood she wants.  But she&#39;s not fat.  The vet expressed nearly  <br/>
disbelief that she was given all the food she wants.    There&#39;s  <br/>
always food down, and she doesn&#39;t eat it unless she&#39;s hungry.<br/>
<br/>
All of that has to do with unschooling.  There are aspects of all of  <br/>
those things that can illuminate principles behind unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When a dog needs to chew, they need MORE things to chew, not fewer  <br/>
things.  Say yes to the dog, give him stuff to chew, and then let him  <br/>
know gently what&#39;s not okay to chew, and keep the best stuff up until  <br/>
he&#39;s older.<br/>
<br/>
Those dogs and their medications?  Holly doesn&#39;t see anything wrong  <br/>
with the dogs, but sure enough, three of them need medications.   <br/>
Why?  She doesn&#39;t know.  But the kids in that family need medications  <br/>
too, and the mom is on an ever-more-limited diet.  No doubt stress is  <br/>
a factor.  Deprivation can&#39;t be helping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About dog care, Marty helped me see that our dog has specialized  <br/>
expectations.  If the dog wants new or different food, she comes to  <br/>
me.  She hangs around when I&#39;m cooking.  She has a very food-specific  <br/>
expectant posture she takes with me, though she&#39;s good-natured if I  <br/>
tell her to go on.  She leave the room on &quot;Go on, Gudrun,&quot; and I  <br/>
don&#39;t say it meanly.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out she doesn&#39;t beg from the others (though it&#39;s not much  <br/>
&quot;begging&quot; anyway; it&#39;s subtle).<br/>
<br/>
If she wants to play, she goes to Marty.<br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s nearly sundown, she starts hanging around Keith in the  <br/>
&quot;going for a walk&quot; positions--near the back door, or near wherever he  <br/>
is and she looks at the door and jumps up if she thinks he&#39;s not  <br/>
understanding plain dog language.  She never does the go-for-a-walk  <br/>
stuff with me, even though I do take her sometimes.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been learning how to deal with aggressive dogs by watching The Dog<br/>
Whisperer and running away is one thing that Cesar Millan (The dog<br/>
whisperer) says not to do because it entices them to chase you like prey.<br/>
The day it happened my 13 yo dd was walking him and I was with her.  I saw<br/>
the dogs at the last second as we came around a corner.  They were in a yard<br/>
where there are not usually dogs. (the lady&#39;s dd was visiting from out of<br/>
town with 2 dogs and no collars on)  I tried to size up their body language<br/>
as they ran over and at the same time I was getting ready to ask the owner<br/>
who was standing there if the dogs were friendly, and before I had time to<br/>
even think, the dog was on our puppy,  growling, snarling, and biting.   It<br/>
didn&#39;t break the skin so it was more likely a show of dominance but it was<br/>
really scary and for a couple minutes after the attack our puppy sat in the<br/>
road whimpering.  I dragged the dog off  our puppy by the scruff of the neck<br/>
and back skin as the owner wasn&#39;t reacting very quickly.  I held onto him<br/>
until she took him from me and after that I started carrying a big stick.<br/>
(although I&#39;ve gotten lazy about that lately since those dogs are gone and<br/>
our route is familiar)<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, the puppy got over his fright pretty quickly and we moved on but<br/>
it was scary for me and I know it was scary for my dd too.  <br/>
<br/>
Our pup is delightful!  He gets walked every day and he has a million toys<br/>
to play with so he&#39;s good about not eating stuff he shouldn&#39;t.  (Although he<br/>
did snag a loaf of bread off the counter last night for the first time!)  He<br/>
loves to be outside and if he&#39;s starts to get mischievous, all one of us has<br/>
to do (if we don&#39;t feel like playing ball or something) is to sit on the<br/>
front porch while he entertains himself outside.  He&#39;s a pretty lucky chap<br/>
because one of us it typically around almost all the time except for a few<br/>
hours at a time occasionally.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re really enjoying him.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right, but if they&#39;ve just sprayed the dog with water, that  <br/>
will discourage him for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up rurally where dogs were loose to run.<br/>
<br/>
I live in a city now where dogs are never supposed to be out of a  <br/>
fenced yard or off a leash.  It makes a difference in behavior and  <br/>
reaction.<br/>
