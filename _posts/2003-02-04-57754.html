<div id="ygrps-yiv-228488432"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;     Thanks for the book recommendation. I reserved it. &lt;G&gt; I have and<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think, is rather good. I just wish he would talk to *me* more. I just<br/>
&gt; could be being selfish. He&#39;ll be 18 this Sept. He&#39;ll be moving out before<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; know it. :-( I&#39;ll miss him being here daily.<br/>
&gt;     I wish I could find my copy of Teen/ Parent Breakthrough. Gotta run.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re off to snowboarding today. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 15 year old son is like that.  He has never talked much, especially about<br/>
feelings and such.  I do wish I had known more about labelling feelings for<br/>
kids when he was little.  My daughter does that with her kids, and they&#39;re<br/>
developing large &quot;feeling vocabularies&quot;.  I think that would have helped.<br/>
What&#39;s been helping lately is things I&#39;ve picked up here.  Even though I<br/>
don&#39;t much like TV, I&#39;ve been watching a bit with him, and he seems to like<br/>
that.  He&#39;ll even pat the couch and tell me to sit down if I&#39;m standing<br/>
there watching something as I go by, so I assume he likes it.  I think I<br/>
posted before about starting to do things for him sometimes that I didn&#39;t<br/>
used to do because he could do them himself.  I&#39;ve made more of a point of<br/>
telling him I love him.  I have to do it on the fly, so to speak, because he<br/>
took to replying, &quot;No you don&#39;t,&quot; in a kind of joking way around puberty.<br/>
That was when I stopped saying it as much, until I realized I could &quot;ambush&quot;<br/>
him with it.  I think all of these things are coming together to produce the<br/>
kind of day we had Sunday, when I drove him to town to see the screening of<br/>
the film his class made.  He surprised the heck out of me by asking me all<br/>
kinds of questions, &quot;what do I think about this and that&quot;, kind of<br/>
questions.<br/>

    I was just telling ds that I was really missing the half hour drive back<br/>
and forth it took to get him to class every week. It&#39;s only ten minutes now.<br/>
:-( I really need to except that he is just not much of a talker.<br/>
