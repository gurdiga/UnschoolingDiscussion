<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784431690">My 8yo ds is fascinated with guns.  He has been since he was a toddler.<br/>
When we go to the library, he checks out the &quot;shooter&#39;s bible&quot;, basically a<br/>
catalog of all the different kinds of guns.  Rather than attempting to<br/>
dissuade him, we have helped him learn how to follow his interests in a safe<br/>
manner.<br/>
<br/>
We talk a lot about gun safety, he visited with a local gunsmith who talked<br/>
with him about how guns work and gun safety, he went to the local shooting<br/>
range and spent some time with an instructor, he is hoping to join the<br/>
shooting sports 4-H club next year.<br/>
<br/>
Zach has a BB gun with which he is very careful.  He only shoots at targets<br/>
and only in a specified safe area out back.  We have rarely even had to<br/>
point out minor safety oversights to him and he has never pointed it at<br/>
anyone or any living things.  But to see Zach with a toy gun is completely<br/>
different.  He is constantly &quot;shooting&quot; people, cars, animals, birds with<br/>
his toys.  Reason being that he is a normal 8yo and is very aware of the<br/>
differences between reality and play.<br/>
