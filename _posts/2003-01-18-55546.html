<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504261335">I got the Searching for Bobby Fisher video that was recommended here at the<br/>
video store yesterday and we watched it last night.  I thought my son would<br/>
like it because he likes chess and has wanted to join a chess club (but we<br/>
don&#39;t live anywhere near where there is one).  He didn&#39;t want to watch the<br/>
movie at first, so I just turned it on to watch it myself. Shortly, the<br/>
whole family was in the room, and we all really enjoyed it.  I had no idea<br/>
people could play chess that fast!  Well, the movie inspired my daughter to<br/>
pull out the chess board, but then nobody wanted to play (it was about<br/>
midnight, and I don&#39;t know how to play anyway).  She ended up playing the<br/>
Lego chess game on the computer, but still has the chess set waiting for<br/>
someone to play!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the recommendation!  I wil have to check on books too!<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>

A similar thing happened for us with  the Karate Kid DVD. The middle boys got really into karate - have had karate workouts out from the video store, borrowing books about martial arts and the history of these....But they don&#39;t want to join a class. Okay with me! Its just funny how many of our interests are sparked by films!...Leonie W. <br/>
