<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024815934">I just re-read a long post I sent regarding Brianna & day care. What was somehow cut off was the paragraph explaining that the reason Brianna was put outside of her classroom was because of the schedule, the routine. <br/>
It was a discipline mindset kind of thing.<br/>

Thanks friends, for being here, being cool......<br/>
