Check out! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to check out links just because someone brings them to a list <br/>
without comment.<br/>
<br/>
If you have something to sell, that&#39;s an improper use of this discussion list.<br/>
If you have found something on the internet that you think is interesting for <br/>
some reason, tell us yourself why it&#39;s interesting to you and then maybe <br/>
include a link.  <br/>
<br/>
Sending links without comment seems Spam-Like.<br/>
<br/>
But if this wasn&#39;t Spam, come back and tell us what&#39;s so cool about that <br/>
link, for unschooling families.<br/>
