<br/>
Yes. That&#39;s why it would be a good idea for those people that don&#39;t <br/>
like the way another person answers a post to keep their post aimed <br/>
only at answering the question instead of attacking the way an answer <br/>
is given.<br/>
I think we&#39;ve all been advised of this numerous times!! It gets very <br/>
wearying when I answer a direct question to read a bunch of posts <br/>
about how I SHOULD have answered. <br/>
How about just answer the person in your own style and not worry <br/>
about how another person answers? PLEASE!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So true, Vicky.  The moderator tries really hard to get people to stick to <br/>
issues and stay away from personalities and discussions of their posting <br/>
styles.  If everyone could do that, they probably *would* find that they&#39;re <br/>
not so far apart.  I know I&#39;ve learned a lot from the disagreements about <br/>
unschooling.  I think they have to happen for at least some of us to &quot;get <br/>
it&quot;.  It&#39;s the disagreements about the disagreements that get in the way.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I hope you&#39;ll stick around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It might help for any who are confused about what this list is about to read<br/>
the description of the list in the Welcome letter. It&#39;s been revised over<br/>
the past 2 weeks so some may not have gotten this particular letter. Helen<br/>
and I collaborated on the 2nd sentence in the 2nd paragraph and just added<br/>
that today.<br/>
<br/>
Questioning *is* a part of this list, eg, &quot;If they are both fun why would<br/>
you call one fun and one lessons?&quot; which I *hope* is clear from &quot;many<br/>
listmembers love a lively debate and questioning beliefs to their<br/>
foundations&quot; in the description. If the wording is misleading, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Personal attacks, eg, &quot;You&#39;re rude&quot; should not be part of list.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re finding the list -- minus the personal attacks -- is different<br/>
than what is described here, *please* let me know so we can describe the<br/>
list better.<br/>
<br/>
---- Unschooling-dotcom Welcome letter ----<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what<br/>
they need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent<br/>
is a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with<br/>
curiosity and enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what,<br/>
when, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to<br/>
Spongebob Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to<br/>
find out more about how video games and life in general are filled with<br/>
learning, come join us!<br/>
<br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is<br/>
*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>
learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in<br/>
unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in<br/>
mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways<br/>
designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>
unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>
&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>
debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations. If you have questions<br/>
about this list please feel free to contact list moderator Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
(jfetteroll@...)<br/>
<br/>
This list and the Unschooling.com site were created and are still supported<br/>
by Home Education Magazine: (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com); Helen Hegener<br/>
(HEM-Editor@...) is the list owner.<br/>

cookie cutter and e-mail is leaves out all the body language, etc., so what<br/>
we read may not be what the poster intended.  A simple, &quot;do you mean,&quot; or<br/>
&quot;could you explain that more fully, I&#39;m not sure I understood,&quot; or &quot;do you<br/>
mean&quot; might save a lot of the angst.<br/>
