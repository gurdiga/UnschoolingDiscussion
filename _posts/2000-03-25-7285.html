<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387947963">Hello everyone,                                                                 <br/>
            I am relatively new to unschooling;  I have been reading on it as <br/>
well as homeschooling for over a year now.  Recently I read an article <br/>
praising the Charlotte Mason method.  I am interested in learning more about <br/>
this, and I was wondering if anyone uses her techniques, and what your <br/>
thoughts are about it.  One thing I have heard about is a nature journal that <br/>
the kids would draw in-- my oldest son (5 yrs) really does not like to draw <br/>
very much, at least he does not spontaneously choose to sit and draw very <br/>
often.  Anyway, I would be grateful for any opinions you might have. Thanks!    <br/>

Karen<br/>
First what are the ages of your other children?<br/>
I have a 5 year old boy (Sam).<br/>
My first question is does anyone draw around him?<br/>
Do you draw or does he have older friends who draw?<br/>
My son does a lot of crafts, I also enjoy doing crafts.  He did not<br/>
draw all the time but, when we started being around some other kids<br/>
who love drawing, he will now get some paper and just draw and draw<br/>
and do some amazing things.  When he started this it was just a few<br/>
days latter that his drawings took on a new look.  First they were<br/>
sticks now they have faces and clothes in just one month.<br/>
This is a lot of the way I feel we homeschool, expose, expose and<br/>
more exposure.  I know when I was in school I loved the learning that<br/>
was experienced on a field trip.  So, we look at our days as field<br/>
trips, what can we experience today that will bring us enjoyment and<br/>
excitment to learn more.  We just moved to a farm from the city so we<br/>
are very excited to experience everything in nature.  The wild turkey<br/>
were in the compost yesterday and the dear have made great trails<br/>
through the woods.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062385011">Hi Karen,<br/>
We read a lot although I would classify us as unschoolers rather than<br/>
followers of Mason.  I just wanted to say that my son only began to like<br/>
drawing when he was 6+.  I&#39;m sure that it was because of the slow<br/>
development of all boy&#39;s small motor skills.  He didn&#39;t like coloring books<br/>
either.  He loved to paint as it is much easier holding those chubby<br/>
paintbrushes than even a fat pencil or crayon.<br/>
<br/>
He loves drawing now (he&#39;s 7 1/2).  He used to be somewhat bothered when he<br/>
would notice his cousins (girls same age) drawing & coloring & using<br/>
scissors so much easier than he could.  It&#39;s just developmental.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could get him a disposable camera...after the film is developed he<br/>
could paint at home.  I like the idea of pasting things in his notebook<br/>
also.  Can his whistle?  If so, help him learn to imitate some birdcalls.<br/>
My son always loved collecting things (still does).  You could begin a<br/>
nature box as well as a nature book....collect acorns, rocks and other<br/>
things that can&#39;t be pasted into a book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734456623">I, too, was intrigued by the idea of narration in my early days of<br/>
homeschooling.  I think it is far better than required writing for those who<br/>
do school, especially with kids who are not ready to do much writing.<br/>
<br/>
From an unschooling perspective, perhaps &quot;narration&quot; can remind us as<br/>
parents to really listen to what our kids DO say.  Perhaps we are the ones<br/>
who need to summarize what they say.<br/>

&gt; in giving children tests.  That&#39;s the &quot;good news&quot;.  The bad news is that<br/>
&gt; instead of giving tests, she had &quot;narration.&quot;  That is, the children<br/>
&gt; listen to a lesson and then say back what they learned.  This is<br/>
&gt; supposed to help them concentrate on the lesson.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I agree with you. I never did get what the purpose of narration would<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s for when someone is teaching other people&#39;s kids for money and <br/>
they  need to &quot;show progress&quot; or prove comprehension.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better than paper tests.  Less intrusive. More &quot;organic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still contrived, but if there are only two choices (that or traditional <br/>
school) that&#39;s way better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430158670">From what I read the narration was suppose to be very gentle, at least for<br/>
the young children, and fairly natural. Related an experience, talking about<br/>
a book they read, or something they saw, or a funny joke they heard, or<br/>
whatever, was narration.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t suppose to be a dry recitation. I picture it more as a<br/>
conversation at the start at least, with more and more of the conversation<br/>
given over to the child until the time they could write an essay about the<br/>
topic. (The end goal was writing an essay.)<br/>
<br/>
So, in effect, at least from my understanding, if you read a book to your<br/>
child an asked what they thought and then added some of your own questions<br/>
and understandings, you would be having your child narrate.  If your child<br/>
bounced in the room excitedly telling you about the birds in the nest and<br/>
that they were born, and they are so funny looking, that would be narration.<br/>
<br/>
I think most of us do this to some extent, it seemed to me she was<br/>
encouraging it as more normative practice.<br/>

<h4>MARK and JULIE SOLICH</h4>
<p><small><time>11 Mar 2003, at  5:33pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654501610">Up to several months ago, I used the Charlotte Mason approach for 2-3 years.<br/>
I also loved the idea of learning through living books and the nature<br/>
journals and narration. It worked well for us though there were areas where<br/>
we did our own thing like reading nine chapters of The Last Battle in a day<br/>
and not getting anything else done!!<br/>
<br/>
We still read lots of living books as the kids love them.<br/>
<br/>
 We have been continuing our nature journals but I have realized that I need<br/>
to give my boys the choice as to whether or not they continue with theirs.<br/>
It has been hard because I love to journal and they have a couple of really<br/>
amazing journals and I would love for them to take this one thing into<br/>
adulthood. BUT, it has to be their choice so I&#39;ve let it go and  I&#39;ll<br/>
secretly hope they join me when I journal.<br/>
<br/>
It still is very much parent directed learning though. Definitely not<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Living Books = books that are well-written and engaging---they absorb the<br/>
reader---the narrative and characters &quot;come alive&quot;; living books are the<br/>
opposite of cold, dry textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Twaddle = dumbed down literature; absence of meaning<br/>

She also felt that children could learn to read a multi-syllable word as<br/>
easily as a short word.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to state that.  There was a definite parental goal,<br/>
and, I suppose I oversimplified. The bouncing child would be considered the<br/>
first step. again, at least from my understanding. And mom and dad get to<br/>
pick the books, the art, the music etc. that the child is exposed to; I can<br/>
say with some assurance that Animae wouldn&#39;t make their list of recommended<br/>
books...<br/>
<br/>
 It can be useful though, just for the reasons you state; edu-speak. Always<br/>
handy to have on hand.  And, in my book, encouraging a parent to listen to<br/>
what a child says is a good thing. <br/>

the drawing- nature journals and copying famous artists.  My younger dd was <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Up to several months ago, I used the Charlotte Mason approach for 2-3 <br/>
&gt;years.<br/>
&gt;I also loved the idea of learning through living books and the nature<br/>
&gt;journals and narration. It worked well for us though there were areas where<br/>
&gt;we did our own thing like reading nine chapters of The Last Battle in a day<br/>
&gt;and not getting anything else done!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We still read lots of living books as the kids love them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  We have been continuing our nature journals but I have realized that I <br/>
&gt;need<br/>
&gt;to give my boys the choice as to whether or not they continue with theirs.<br/>
&gt;It has been hard because I love to journal and they have a couple of really<br/>
&gt;amazing journals and I would love for them to take this one thing into<br/>
&gt;adulthood. BUT, it has to be their choice so I&#39;ve let it go and  I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;secretly hope they join me when I journal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It still is very much parent directed learning though. Definitely not<br/>
&gt;unschooling.<br/>

It works with retelling books or movies.  I think if the recommendation is to <br/>
listen to people and discuss things, the same effect can be had in a more <br/>
unschooling way.  &quot;Narration&quot; just sounds like &quot;oral book report&quot; to me.  <br/>
Slight shift from assigned to voluntary makes all the difference.  And to <br/>
communication and dialog from narrator/teacher-judge.<br/>
<br/>
Because I don&#39;t read left to right but kind of swirly, &quot;Charlotte Mason&quot; <br/>
invariably looks first like &quot;Charles Manson&quot; and then I see it more clearly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795268188">I just sent a period as a whole e-mail.  I&#39;m really sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Meant to say, of &quot;living books,&quot; how subjective it is.<br/>
<br/>
Some book resonate with me, and that makes them full of life. Or rather, <br/>
between that book and my mind, lots of life is happening.<br/>
<br/>
But some books which might be considered valuable classics by other people <br/>
seem like life-sucking deathholes to me.<br/>
<br/>
So I think &quot;living&quot; is really always only happening in the human involved, <br/>
and for an outside entity to prescribe (pre-label) what is &quot;living&quot; and what <br/>
isn&#39;t hits on that issue of respecting differences.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe music is an easier analogy even than books.  Some music will make one <br/>
person cry with emotional depth, and another person cry &quot;Turn it off! What <br/>
irritating noise!&quot;<br/>
