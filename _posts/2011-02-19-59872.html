<div id="ygrps-yiv-319202969">I think it is important to remember that what is considered the &quot;pleasures of being a kid&quot; depends entirely on what each individual child finds pleasurable. It isn&#39;t the end of the world if a child does not ever play with Legos, etc.  I am sure they will eventually develop other interests, but if gaming and TV makes them happy, I personally do not see a problem with it. My son is 18 and still spends several hours a day playing video games. I see such excitement on his face when he beats a game or when a new game he has been looking forward to is released. He does have a few other interests, but gaming is important to him, therefore, it is important to me that he is able to engage in what he enjoys.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know that when you give in to that impulse to restrict what they  <br/>
love to do, your gaming reset button is back at zero? In other words,  <br/>
when you stop them from getting their fill, you&#39;ve emptied their cups  <br/>
and they&#39;ll try harder to fill them up before you put the brakes on  <br/>
again.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So there is something they enjoy besides games. There is no harm in  <br/>
offering other things to do. *You* can come up with all sorts of great  <br/>
ideas. The thing about strewing is that your kids have the opportunity  <br/>
to take you up on it or not. Their choice.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to offer things they&#39;re likely to be interested in though,  <br/>
not just what you think they should do instead. How about adding to  <br/>
their gaming experience by getting strategy guides, books to read,  <br/>
checking out game-specific sites, going to conventions, sewing them  <br/>
costumes, bringing them cool gamer food to eat, buying them t-shirts?  <br/>
Zillions of ways to support them and really make them feel like you  <br/>
understand how important it is to them, *right now*.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess ultimately I feel it&#39;s important for them to have a life  <br/>
&gt; outside of games.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, they will. If you don&#39;t keep stopping them from doing it now. How  <br/>
long have they been playing? How many times have you stopped them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  To live and experience life in the real world rather than life in a  <br/>

they&#39;re ready for the real world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although, I agree its super fun to play these games, it just seems  <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do you think?<br/>

best&quot;!! Choices, yes. Support, yes. Involvement, yes.<br/>

-Robin:<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate all the great suggestions you gave me.  Gaming food, conventions, gaming strategy guides, etc.<br/>
<br/>
You are so right that its learning.  One of my sons learned to read by playing video games, reading strategy guides and cheats online.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only let them play unrestricted for maybe a little over 2 weeks kind of off and on. Then I get worried about them not wanting to participate in pretending, fort building, lego&#39;s, etc. that I cut it off for a while and they have no other choice but to revert to non-gaming play.  Even though they still pretend to be the gaming hero&#39;s in their play.  Which I love to see them do.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking that what is stopping me from letting it sink in is a combination of things. Family & hubby pressure to homeschool rather than unschool and my own love of pretend play and crafts.  I think I really just need to get outside of my own fears and just go for it and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
My 9 year old WILL stop anything to cook with me and do crafts.  My 11 year old LOVES me to read to him and look up stuff on e-bay.  I guess I just need to get comfortable with my kids ability to make choices.  If I always make choices for them, I&#39;m kind of helping them to become robots or sheeple.  I am going to toss that question you asked me around in my mind for a while and see what really is stopping me from letting it sink in.<br/>
<br/>
I always end up coming back to this site looking for answers to gaming and how to make it work for my family.  Maybe I need to stop trying to make it work and just let it be.  See what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-644118671">2 weeks is a minor blip in a lifetime. 2 weeks is a moment when you notice that <br/>
something has changed and you don&#39;t know how long you&#39;ve got so you&#39;re gonna run <br/>
with it for as long and as hard as you can. Once 2 weeks has grown to a point <br/>
where your children are pretty sure it&#39;s not going to be rescinded they will be <br/>
more open to exploring the things that they enjoyed without limits before. It <br/>
may help you to read Pam Sorooshian&#39;s essay on marginal utility: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.">http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.</a> Maybe that piece will help the rest of <br/>
your family to understand what this moment of engagement is about. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know the musical Oliver? There is a song Food, Glorious Food where the <br/>
orphans in a working orphanage who are feed on gruel three times a day sing <br/>
&quot;rich gentleman have it boys, in-di-gestion.&quot; Your children are so used to being <br/>
told when they are done with something, they are so used to the control, that in <br/>
its absence they are enjoying all aspects, even the indigestion, so to speak. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Robin wrote strewing is good. Strewing is good. Offering something engaging is <br/>
good. Being open to them saying no is really important whenever you offer <br/>
something. It&#39;s also good to look to their interests to define the engagement. <br/>
If they like Halo, craft some groovy swords and hammers. Portal is one of the <br/>
most phenomenal games! You could show them Jonathan Coulton singing the credits <br/>
song: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxNmeMklFk8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxNmeMklFk8</a> and then stumble into the <br/>
amazing world of Jonathan Coulton songs. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Wy7gRGgeA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Wy7gRGgeA</a> is a good one and a cool machinima. <br/>
Or there is the amazing ukulele playing video of Jonathan Coulton&#39;s Mr. Fancy <br/>
Pants: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m4DDkMfol0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m4DDkMfol0</a> which has also been done in <br/>
machinima: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu71EAdnjQ0&feature=fvw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu71EAdnjQ0&feature=fvw</a> And maybe all <br/>
of that would lead to Oxhorn&#39;s videos like this one: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEWgs6YQR9A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEWgs6YQR9A</a> (more here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oxhorn.com/)">http://www.oxhorn.com/)</a> <br/>
or maybe instead of going down the Portal route you could go to Red versus Blue <br/>
stuff. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBxF4wAy44I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBxF4wAy44I</a> (there is a fair bit of <br/>
swearing so maybe not if you aren&#39;t comfortable with that, but it is funny).  <br/>
Rooster Teeth&#39;s webpage is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://roosterteeth.com/archive/?sid=rvb">http://roosterteeth.com/archive/?sid=rvb</a> for more Red <br/>
v Blue. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t work to disconnect them from their enjoyment, work to find more and more <br/>
things to engage them and for them to enjoy. <br/>

That video gaming section of my site isn&#39;t &quot;Sandra&#39;s articles,&quot; is it?  A small bit is by me, but most of it is by MANY other people, including psychologists and various researchers.<br/>
<br/>
And it won&#39;t &quot;sink in.&quot;   No learning &quot;just sinks in.&quot;  You either take parts of the information and process it into your own understanding, into your model of the universe, or you don&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
Is chess in the real world?  Football?  Tennis?<br/>
Are novels in the real world?  Poetry?  Music?  Movies?<br/>
<br/>
To separate gaming from &quot;the real world&quot; is false and it&#39;s rude.<br/>
It shows a lack of clarity and thought and awareness.<br/>
I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s about a parent who hasn&#39;t sat and watched people play Halo or Portal, or who hasn&#39;t read much about them, or tried them herself.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m tired, but it does seem that someone who is being that negative about her children&#39;s interests could use more attention to her kids, and maybe more life and experience in the real world AND in the fantasy/thought world of what could be better in her unschooling life, and in her partnership with her child.<br/>

&gt; -=-Some kids feel safer playing games than being in the real world,  <br/>
&gt; until<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t clear in my statement above.<br/>
<br/>
I think that for my daughter, she feels safer in the online social  <br/>
world (gaming, Facebook, etc.) than she does &quot;in person&quot;. She can take  <br/>
her time to work through situations and difficulties without losing it  <br/>
at her friends. She has space and time to understand relationships at  <br/>
her pace. She can calm down. Her hair-trigger emotionality is  <br/>
mitigated through not having to respond in the moment. She can  <br/>
practice deep-breathing, thinking before she speaks, being kind.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid has difficulty socially (like reading social cues or being  <br/>
sensitive to others&#39; emotions), gaming can be a way to understand and  <br/>
learn what is appropriate and what isn&#39;t. We talk all the time about  <br/>
rudeness and kindness and overreaction and doing the right thing, as a  <br/>
result of gaming. Senna used to think she was alone in her world (so  <br/>
many kids her age have left behind what she continues to love; she&#39;s  <br/>
felt &quot;different&quot; internally for a long time), but meeting people  <br/>
online who share her interests no matter what their age has been  <br/>
enormously helpful. She sees that she&#39;s not so different and that  <br/>
encourages her.<br/>
