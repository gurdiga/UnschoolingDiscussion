somethings to do/see.  We won&#39;t be there but for a couple of days.  I lived<br/>
in Alexandria as a child and would like to take the kids by there and see<br/>
the place again.  I also thought of driving through D.C. and stopping by<br/>
major landmarks - we don&#39;t have the time/money to do the museum<br/>
deal -BOO-HOO!  So, this will be a drive by vacation.  Any ideas on no miss<br/>
spots?  We will be picking up the girls in Williamsburg - but since dh and<br/>
the girls lived there and I saw it as a kid, none of us are interested.  I<br/>
think D.C. will be the major driveby and wave focus.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ho hum. We&#39;re going away for 3 months this summer. Without<br/>
&gt; &gt; DH. As I can&#39;t afford<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to fly home. I&#39;m chucking the tent in the car and heading out<br/>
&gt; &gt; into the US to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; how far I get.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone want a visit from 4 brits?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shyrley<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh yes please!!<br/>

that<br/>
&gt; far :-) and surprise everyone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a Holiday Inn in Reston. Reston is about 30 mins drive from parking<br/>
on the Mall or you can park at one of the Metro stations a bit further out from<br/>
Arlington and take the Metro straight to the Smithsonian museums on the Mall.<br/>
Check DC&#39;s metro online, it will tell you the stations from DC to Vienna and<br/>
then you could look up motels.<br/>
Driving into DC after the rush hour isn&#39;t too bad and before the summer its<br/>
usually easy to find somewhere to park near the museums although it&#39;s often<br/>
metered so you have to remember to feed &#39;em.<br/>
There&#39;s a great place for lunch in the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Ave<br/>
opposite the FBI headqaurters. It&#39;s a food court. Very cheap.<br/>
Alexandria is about 20 mins from DC (after rush hour)<br/>
When are you coming? Maybe we could meet up.<br/>

on spending at least 2 nights in the area.  It is so hard to cram in a years<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last time I was there, we took the Metro into DC.  We were staying in<br/>
Tyson&#39;s Corner, VA since that&#39;s where my DH&#39;s conference was.  Alexandria<br/>
is just across the Potomac from Washington, not sure how far as the roads<br/>
go though.  It&#39;s a neat city.  The Torpedo Factory was cool - it&#39;s an<br/>
old WW2 torpedo factory that has been changed into artist&#39;s studios. Some<br/>
of the artists just sell things there; others actually make their art<br/>
there too.  It&#39;s on the river.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a fabric person one of the best fabric stores in the world<br/>
is in Rockville, MD.  It&#39;s called G Street Fabrics - I visited it twice!!<br/>
<br/>
We flew in and out of Baltimore rather than Dulles or National - it<br/>
was cheaper and not that much farther away from where we needed to go.<br/>
<br/>
I like Washington a lot.  If you want to visit the Capitol or White House<br/>
contact your congress critter.  They can get you tickets for those without<br/>
standing in line once you get there (my experience is pre-9/11 though).<br/>
Also if anyone in your family is really, really into airplanes, there<br/>
are Saturday tours of the Paul E. Garber facility in Silver Springs, MD.<br/>
This is an annex to the Air and Space Museum and is where all the<br/>
restoration work is done on their exhibits.  We got to see the Enola<br/>
Gay as it was being worked on!  They also store some of their planes<br/>
there when they are being shown.<br/>
<br/>
We are trying to figure out what we want to do for travel this year.<br/>
It probably won&#39;t be until September since my DH&#39;s work schedule is<br/>
pretty tight still.  It&#39;s so hard to choose!<br/>

I put it on the message boards at unschooling.com.<br/>
I said we would meet in front of the Natural History Museum at 11:00.<br/>
I have our picture in the photo section here if you want to see what <br/>
we look like so we&#39;ll be easier to spot.<br/>
We look pretty much the same, except my son Jacks hair is quite a bit <br/>
longer now.  Mines just a little longer.<br/>
See you soon!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399622623">ok.. sticking my nose in without an intro..  I&#39;m not quite sure I<br/>
understand, maybe i missed something. Are you moving to the Gulport area or<br/>
???  If so I&#39;d be sooooooo happy to meet another unschooler! There isnt much<br/>
inclusive support here as it is, much less anyone that understands<br/>
unschooling. At least I havent been able to find them!<br/>

I know, but we only have x amount of days and x amount of money.  I figure<br/>
on spending at least 2 nights in the area.  It is so hard to cram in a years<br/>
worth of quality time with the girls, and to add something fun to do, do it<br/>
all with the limited time joe gets off work and money we have.  Plus, we<br/>
still have to save some money to get them back home - their new home will be<br/>
in gulfport mississippi - they will fly home, I am not riding in a car for<br/>
44 hours, I refuse.<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve been learning at not-school since ds Phil (18) finished first <br/>
grade.  Dd Cecily (14) never went.  Mothering has been my longest <br/>
held job, but I have done medical technology, public speaking and <br/>
training, and management consulting, during which time I got hooked <br/>
up with dh Tom.  Still do occasional public speaking  -- mostly <br/>
composting workshops and talks about homeschooling talks, and I <br/>
volunteer in several ways for the HomeSchool Association of <br/>
California.<br/>
<br/>
Midlife finds me amazed about Phil being away at college, our 13 y/o <br/>
dog being away forever, and being mom to Cecily, our teenage <br/>
girl/shopper/reader/dancer.  <br/>
<br/>
As Mary says, life is good.<br/>
