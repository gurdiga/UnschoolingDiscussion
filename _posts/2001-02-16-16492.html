&gt; Dont do anything drastic, yet. My husband is a<br/>
&gt; carpenter, and every part of my house is 1/2 finished.<br/>
&gt; He does beautiful work when paid, but here its more of<br/>
&gt; a hapless hobby, so beware! I hear this happens to<br/>
&gt; lots of women who think they have found the perfect<br/>
&gt; tradesman(husband,lol)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had to laugh at this one. My husband is in the cleaning business. He<br/>
cleans big corporate aircraft belonging to very rich mucky-mucks, and<br/>
apparently does an awesome job of it (he even got asked to clean Martha<br/>
Stewart&#39;s plane :-)<br/>
When asked to clean the bathroom at home, he swabs the washcloth around the<br/>
sink once or twice. Arrrrgh! Where is that spotless attention to detail he&#39;s<br/>
so famous for???<br/>
