&gt; Ya think? I&#39;m not sure I agree with that, or I would think that people<br/>
&gt; who feel that they need these things have been raised in a way that makes<br/>
&gt; then dependent on external structures like this, it&#39;s not an innate<br/>

conference. Her SIL was VERY upset that the teacher refused to tell her what <br/>
her child&#39;s &quot;class rank&quot; was after the teacher had shared that the child was <br/>
very bright, doing very well, and was a joy to have in her class.<br/>
<br/>
The child is in the second grade.<br/>
<br/>
The same SIL grilled a third SIL about HER child&#39;s &quot;class-rank.&quot; THAT child <br/>
is in Kindergarten.  There are lots of nutty parents out there.<br/>
