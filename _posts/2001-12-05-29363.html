&gt; she started detailing why she *had* to put her kids in school<br/>
&gt; (because she needed to take a job), how much they were enjoying the<br/>
&gt; alternative school, but *of course* it would never be as wonderful as<br/>
&gt; homeschooling had been, etc., etc., etc. By the time she wound down<br/>
&gt; and my friend changed the subject I was beginning to wonder if I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; unconsciously frowned at the word &#39;school&#39; or something to invoke<br/>
&gt; such a defensive reaction.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that it was you who invoked the defensiveness.  It seems to me that defensiveness comes from inside the person who&#39;s being defensive.  If I feel confident about a decision I&#39;ve made, you can say just about anything to me about it and I won&#39;t react defensively.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not the first time this has happened, of course. Just the most<br/>
&gt; recent. I&#39;m sure many of you have run into this odd phenomenon of<br/>
&gt; people reacting as though homeschooling were something they felt<br/>
&gt; guilty about if they weren&#39;t doing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We chose to send our son to school for grade 5 and part of grade 6 so that I could work.  He didn&#39;t yet feel confident about staying home by himself, we needed the money and I failed to come up with a way to earn it at home.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t want to go.  It was fairly unpleasant for all of us. I felt, and continue to feel, huge waves of guilt about it all.<br/>
<br/>
I  wish that we&#39;d been able to find a better way to get through those years.  I feel guilt about his unpleasant experience, about the loss of trust between us, about not being able to come up with a way of earning a hunk of money working at home.<br/>
<br/>
When I read about your experience, what I think I recognized was the guilt of the working mother (which happens even with mothers who happily send their kids to school), compounded with the guilt of someone who feels she hasn&#39;t made the best decision about a huge chunk of her<br/>
children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hadn&#39;t given the whole thing<br/>
&gt; much thought until yesterday, but this lady&#39;s intensity...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that the lady&#39;s intensity had more to do with her own inner conflict than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*                 *                  *                    *<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ...has been<br/>
&gt; making me wonder whether or not it&#39;s a good thing that homeschooling<br/>
&gt; is perceived as so... I dunno... wholesome? Unimpeachable? (Where&#39;s<br/>
&gt; that damn thesaurus when I need it? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Helen, I&#39;m interested in hearing some ways that you think it&#39;s a &quot;bad&quot; thing if people perceive homeschooling is &quot;the best&quot; ( I&#39;ll use it as a weak  stand-in for wholesome, unimpeachable, or ...?....).<br/>
<br/>
Is it something about people seeing us (the parents) as paragons of virtue and eyeballing us for signs of weakness and speaking to us from a kind of defensive, guilty, intense place because we&#39;re these paragons?<br/>
<br/>
My immediate reaction was that you meant something about people deciding that their families aren&#39;t good enough for them to plunge into homeschooling.   Or that they&#39;ll feel the kind of guilt that this lady seems to feel. Or just that they feel that deciding to homeschool is some<br/>
kind of irrevocable decision that they&#39;re not strong enough to make.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be a happier society if people just felt easy enough in themselves (and had the means) to do what they feel is right, and weren&#39;t expending so much energy flogging themselves because they aren&#39;t doing  &quot;the best thing&quot;? Or if we could just stop comparing ourselves to<br/>
other people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-515903179">I&#39;ve been reading here with growing dismay tonight - well, I guess <br/>
it&#39;s early morning now. Where does the time go?<br/>
<br/>
I, too, am growing tired of the continued bad vibes I&#39;m getting from <br/>
certain people on this list. I&#39;ve been watching the membership list <br/>
dwindle as people either unsub or set their subs to no mail in <br/>
increasing numbers. It saddens me to see what was once such a <br/>
friendly, helpful vibrant list become this sad shell of its former <br/>
self. And I&#39;m not amused by the increasing frequency of foul language <br/>
in posts. No, we don&#39;t monitor or police this list. We&#39;re not going <br/>
to unsub you for expressing yourself in flaming fullcolor. We rather <br/>
expect that you&#39;d behave less like an angst-filled teenager - no, <br/>
waitaminute, that&#39;s not fair to teenagers... sorry. Anyway, you get <br/>
my drift. I&#39;m sure we can all click on the latest junk email if we <br/>
want titilating language.<br/>
<br/>
So what do we do with this problem child of a list? I received an <br/>
emailing offlist tonight from a friend expressing outrage that this <br/>
list&#39;s behavior is reflecting badly on HEM&#39;s reputation (it is one of <br/>
ours, after all). I could only shake my head and agree with her <br/>
analysis, but how do we keep this list free and open and unmonitored <br/>
if people are just going to continue to behave like they&#39;ve been <br/>
doing for - gee, how long has it been now? Too long in my estimation.<br/>
<br/>
I keep wondering if we passed some kind of invisible balance point <br/>
with this list some time ago; let things slide too far in one <br/>
direction and now there&#39;s no way to find our way back to what we once <br/>
had. When I started this list I was so sure it didn&#39;t need monitors <br/>
and listmamas because surely unschoolers were &quot;different,&quot; they could <br/>
find and maintain balance and kindness and a higher purpose, couldn&#39;t <br/>
they?<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few people have asked for a return to peaceful discourse, <br/>
most of them much more eloquently than I feel capable of. To be <br/>
honest, I&#39;m still feeling pretty burned out by everything that&#39;s <br/>
happened this fall - it&#39;s been a rough one for our family, as well as <br/>
for our nation. That just makes it so much harder to come here - to <br/>
what was for so long a friendly port in life&#39;s storms - and find such <br/>
animosity and orneryness every day.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe this great unmonitored experiment of a list has failed, <br/>
after all. What do you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478867628">I think it&#39;s rather ironic that this nastiness should reach this point in<br/>
the midst of threads on labelling and name calling and whether these are<br/>
helpful or hurtful.<br/>
<br/>
One camp says it&#39;s helpful to children to have their negative behavior<br/>
pointed out to them so they can see it and correct it. And yet when others<br/>
see what they consider faults and call those spades spades, the technique<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be received with gratefulness and relief at having a trait<br/>
they hadn&#39;t noticed identified for them. Easy enough to say it&#39;s not the<br/>

than &quot;That&#39;s the way she behaves so that&#39;s the way I&#39;m going to treat her&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I think perhaps part of the problem is there&#39;s some resentment towards those<br/>
some feel are responsible for Sandra&#39;s leaving. They liked the list the way<br/>
it was and resent that it has changed. (I&#39;m not above that myself ;-) But<br/>
Sandra has a perfectly fine list going. (And it&#39;s probably going well<br/>
because the list is composed of people who &quot;get&quot; Sandra&#39;s style of<br/>
communication. If you don&#39;t it&#39;s best not to join since you&#39;d just be<br/>

Thanks for your thoughts. I don&#39;t think monderating would be a bad idea. I <br/>
belong to several lists, some of them very spiritual in nature, where you <br/>
would think they don&#39;t need moderating as well. However, there are people who <br/>
will join the list that will disrupt it no matter what the intent of the <br/>
list. Personally, I post the same way whether a list is moderated or not. . . <br/>
maybe I moderate myself mostly. So my vote would be to get the list back to <br/>
some kind of peacefulness to moderate it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-338658738">Dear Helen,<br/>
I agree with most of your thoughts on this problem. <br/>
IMHO, I think as list owner, you have every right to ban individuals from the list. I know you don&#39;t want to be police chief and I understand that&#39;s the whole gist of this list... no monitoring. <br/>
Let&#39;s say you own a bookstore and you sell all kinds of books (not that you *like* all these kinds of books.. just that they are available to everybody interested). You have tons of repeat customers... for years. You job is to stock the store, etc. but you don&#39;t have to police the patrons... they&#39;re folks who have come to your store with a purpose...to get information or (buy books). All of a sudden, a new person enters the store and starts going up to each patron and criticizing what they&#39;re reading. Some of them ignore this person. Others walk away in a huff. One of them goes next door and starts her *own* book store and takes some of the original patrons with her.  But there you are, still owner of the bookstore and watching it go down in a pile of dust.. fast. This store has meant a lot to you in the past and you recoginize it&#39;s also meant a lot to other people in town.  Do you just sit back behind the register and let this go on or do you ask the person(s) causing the rukus to leave? IMHO, you have a job to do *if* you still care about your &#39;store&#39;.....<br/>
<br/>
or are you looking for a reason to shut it down? (I&#39;m hoping not!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961287187">Joyce,  <br/>
<br/>
I see all of your points and agree with them for the most part.  I <br/>
know that I often come across as condescending and I know why and how <br/>
that happens.  A lot of it has to do with my writing style. And at <br/>
this point, here, some of it has to do with misperceptions of me.  I <br/>
was called everything from autoritative to a bad mother to a social <br/>
vandal here on this list.  There are those here who have yet to move <br/>
past that and it shows in their writing.  I&#39;ve reached a point where <br/>
I don&#39;t care what you (plural) say about me.  I join in on threads <br/>
when I have something to say. And I will continue to ask questions.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that this particular flame up happened because I asked <br/>
two specific questions . . .<br/>
1.  I asked Julie if she really wanted to get personal.<br/>
2.  I asked how her comments were not personal (as I was told by Dar <br/>
in answer to question #1 yet when I made nearly the same comment <br/>
about someone else it was personal bashing.  I have yet to get an <br/>
answer to that.  And it has absolutely nothing to do with Sandra at <br/>
all.  The question never did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bridget<br/>
<br/>
ps - FWIW - I never said Julie was incorrect in her assessment of <br/>
me.  I merely asked why it was okay for her to say it when similar <br/>
comments were not okay in the past.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927130080">Dear Cindy,<br/>
I&#39;m not clear on what it is you would like Helen to do... Could you spell it out for me? It *seems* like you&#39;re saying that without Sandra here, the list is not worth maintaining. And what do you mean about not renewing your subscription to HEM.... waiting till January? Are you waiting to see if Helen *does* something... like shut the list down or ????  It sounds like you&#39;re trying to make her an offer she can&#39;t refuse and I&#39;m sure I must be misunderstanding you.<br/>
Please clarify for me.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

  I left the list for a while and came back.  I&#39;m not sure I will<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568665482">Hi Helen,<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think the behavior of certain people on this list should be <br/>
considered a reflection of HEM. I don&#39;t consider it to be.  People&#39;s <br/>
posts should be a reflection of those particular people.  I believe <br/>
monitoring the list would be contrary to the philosophy of unschooling.  <br/>
That&#39;s my personal opinion.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m right or if I&#39;m wrong.  <br/>
I&#39;m a newbie and I think this should be your decision.  This is my input.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to say that I hope I have not offended anyone on this <br/>
list.  I usually just offer my opinions.  If I have, it was <br/>
unintentional and I was just trying to help or offer my opinion.  Or, <br/>
perhaps I was just trying to be funny and it backfired.  Please accept <br/>
my apologies if I have hurt anyone&#39;s feelings.  I am learning a lot from <br/>
this list and I hope it continues (hopefully, unmonitered).  I wish <br/>
everyone would just remember to be kind and stay away from foul <br/>
language.  I, personally, find it offensive.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been reading here with growing dismay tonight - well, I guess<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s early morning now. Where does the time go?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I, too, am growing tired of the continued bad vibes I&#39;m getting from<br/>
&gt; certain people on this list. I&#39;ve been watching the membership list<br/>
&gt; dwindle as people either unsub or set their subs to no mail in<br/>
&gt; increasing numbers. It saddens me to see what was once such a<br/>
&gt; friendly, helpful vibrant list become this sad shell of its former<br/>
&gt; self. And I&#39;m not amused by the increasing frequency of foul language<br/>
&gt; in posts. No, we don&#39;t monitor or police this list. We&#39;re not going<br/>
&gt; to unsub you for expressing yourself in flaming fullcolor. We rather<br/>
&gt; expect that you&#39;d behave less like an angst-filled teenager - no,<br/>
&gt; waitaminute, that&#39;s not fair to teenagers... sorry. Anyway, you get<br/>
&gt; my drift. I&#39;m sure we can all click on the latest junk email if we<br/>
&gt; want titilating language.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So what do we do with this problem child of a list? I received an<br/>
&gt; emailing offlist tonight from a friend expressing outrage that this<br/>
&gt; list&#39;s behavior is reflecting badly on HEM&#39;s reputation (it is one of<br/>
&gt; ours, after all). I could only shake my head and agree with her<br/>
&gt; analysis, but how do we keep this list free and open and unmonitored<br/>
&gt; if people are just going to continue to behave like they&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; doing for - gee, how long has it been now? Too long in my estimation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I keep wondering if we passed some kind of invisible balance point<br/>
&gt; with this list some time ago; let things slide too far in one<br/>
&gt; direction and now there&#39;s no way to find our way back to what we once<br/>
&gt; had. When I started this list I was so sure it didn&#39;t need monitors<br/>
&gt; and listmamas because surely unschoolers were &quot;different,&quot; they could<br/>
&gt; find and maintain balance and kindness and a higher purpose, couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; they?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quite a few people have asked for a return to peaceful discourse,<br/>
&gt; most of them much more eloquently than I feel capable of. To be<br/>
&gt; honest, I&#39;m still feeling pretty burned out by everything that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; happened this fall - it&#39;s been a rough one for our family, as well as<br/>
&gt; for our nation. That just makes it so much harder to come here - to<br/>
&gt; what was for so long a friendly port in life&#39;s storms - and find such<br/>
&gt; animosity and orneryness every day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So maybe this great unmonitored experiment of a list has failed,<br/>
&gt; after all. What do you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692255872">Okay, I&#39;ve read the 40 or so messages posted to this list, plus about <br/>
half that many sent privately offlist. My sincere thanks to everyone <br/>
who took the time to share their thoughts about this prickly <br/>
situation with me. It has helped tremendously, even if the conclusion <br/>
I&#39;m coming to isn&#39;t one I&#39;d have chosen on my own.<br/>
<br/>
I have to resignedly agree with those who feel this list&#39;s growing <br/>
bad reputation is reflecting on Home Education Magazine. I know there <br/>
are many on this list who probably don&#39;t even know what that is, and <br/>
that&#39;s fine, but it is my overriding concern in deciding to take a <br/>
hand in what&#39;s happening here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to make this a moderated list, and I deeply appreciate the <br/>
offers from those who&#39;ve volunteered to help in that department. <br/>
Interestingly, we&#39;ve been having something of a parallel discussion <br/>
on another list I belong to, which is directed at members of the <br/>
independent press, and they decided just this morning to invoke this <br/>
model:<br/>
<br/>
...monitor the list closely and *privately* remind, reprimand, and <br/>
eventually unsubscribe members who violate the established rules <br/>
(generally effective if done consistently, fairly, and the rest of <br/>
the list members let the moderators do their job instead of jumping <br/>
immediately on someone who missteps).<br/>
<br/>
I like the way that is worded, even if I don&#39;t like the idea of <br/>
list-police. But just as society in general needs police to keep the <br/>
hooligans from making life miserable for everyone, I guess lists with <br/>
as diverse a populace as this one enjoys will benefit from someone <br/>
keeping the problems in check.<br/>
<br/>
So how do we come up with acceptable rules of behavior? I&#39;ve seen <br/>
some good ones on other lists... FWIW, the independent press list I&#39;m <br/>
on came up with waaaay too many rules for me - I can live with them <br/>
under my other hat as a publisher, but not as an unschooling mom. I <br/>
think the simpler we keep things the simpler it will be for people to <br/>
remember and comply with them.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m open to suggestions in that department.<br/>
<br/>
And now I&#39;ll reply to a few posts individually.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, everyone!<br/>

I don&#39;t have any answers for this.  It isn&#39;t about Sandra, it&#39;s about<br/>
the nastiness.  Sandra is gone and I doubt if she will return but the<br/>
nastiness is still here.  My decision to remain or leave will be based<br/>
on whether or not the nastiness leaves.<br/>

been doing this. We run almost two dozen email lists, three <br/>
newsletters, and three websites in addition to publishing HEM. This <br/>
list was sort of my guinea pig, my ambitious attempt to give human <br/>
nature free rein and see where we ended up. In retrospect it was <br/>
probably a grave disservice to those good people who came here <br/>
looking for meaningful conversation and helpful advice, and I think I <br/>
own an apology to those folks who tried for so long to stick with it <br/>
through all the bad times, hoping for more good times. Sadly, many of <br/>
them are gone now and won&#39;t even read this, but perhaps if we build <br/>
this list back into what it can be we&#39;ll entice a few of them back <br/>
again? That seems like the least we - I - can do now.<br/>

considering unsubbing. It was getting to be something to dread, rather than<br/>

dreading opening each new email because of the language prevalent on the list.<br/>
Their attitude was &quot;we&#39;re far from mainstream so we can say whatever we want.&quot;<br/>
They *could* say it, but it was still offensive.<br/>
