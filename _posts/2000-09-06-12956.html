<div id="ygrps-yiv-185940003">&lt;&lt;Well, he is TRYING to<br/>
become more supportive...&gt;&gt;  weve gotta be happy about that...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am usually too chicken to use the &quot;unschooling&quot; word... maybe someday <br/>
I&#39;ll utter that &quot;u&quot; word in public. Ha, ha... When talking to other <br/>
homeschoolers I usually first assess their perspectives on learning before I <br/>
disclose our approach.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
glad to know i am not the only one.  i guess it is natural to be wary in a <br/>
society that is so school oriented, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I first think &quot;that&#39;s too bad&quot;, then I think<br/>
&quot;should I be doing that or my child will be uneducated in comparison?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
or, along a similar line, will my child be undiciplined, or unable to study, <br/>
etc?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Although I realize that wouldn&#39;t work for us anyway, even if I ever wanted<br/>
to schedule our lives like that. But I do experience these confusing and<br/>
conflicting feelings about our way of learning. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
oh darn.  was hoping for a quickfix i could whisk those feelings away.  <br/>
anyone else have remedies to keep the doubts away?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am afraid<br/>
he is like me: planning and shopping for educational supplies is more<br/>
exciting than actually using them!&gt;&gt;<br/>
i love this!  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess we all go through stages in our<br/>
lives when our need for structure ebbs and flows. At least with unschooling<br/>
you can allow yourself to ebb occasionally, whereas in school you always<br/>
have to go with their flow. &gt;&gt;  <br/>
wise words--  ty olivia<br/>

Oh, I never actually tell people we are UNschooling.  They just wouldn&#39;t get <br/>
it.  Not in the time I have to spend explaining, anyway.  Most people seem <br/>
content with &quot;no, we don&#39;t really use a set curriculum (that&#39;s ALWAYS their <br/>
first question), we do a combination of things.&quot;  <br/>
