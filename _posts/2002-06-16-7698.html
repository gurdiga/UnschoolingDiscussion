&gt; &quot;HOW OLD   DO YOU THINK I AM!?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not a great answer, since it caused me not to ask my grandmothers, and one <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; them had moved from Texas to New Mexico in a covered wagon, and my <br/>
&gt; grandfather on the other side had come from somewhere SE (northern <br/>
&gt; Alabama?) <br/>
&gt; to Oklahoma and then Texas the same way.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My mom SHOULD have said, &quot;No, but my dad did.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I never asked my dad&#39;s mom.  I found out years later.  She was still <br/>
&gt; alive.  But it would have been cool, when I was little, to have heard her <br/>
&gt; stories of moving when SHE was little.<br/>

she told me how as a young girl, my grandmother used to <br/>
get an occasional ride to school in Alexander Graham Bell&#39;s <br/>
covered wagon.  My grandmother grew up farm in Novia Scotia.  <br/>
