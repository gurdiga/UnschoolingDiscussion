&quot;A house becomes a home when you can write &quot;I love you&quot; on thefurniture.&quot;  I <br/>

case someone came over&quot;. Then I realized one day that noonecame over; they <br/>
were all out living life and having fun!  Now, when people visit, I find no <br/>
need to explain the &quot;condition&quot; of myhome. They are more interested in <br/>
hearing about the things I&#39;ve beendoing while I was away living life and <br/>
having fun. If you haven&#39;tfiguredthis out yet, please heed this advice.  Life <br/>
is short. Enjoy it!<br/>

 Dust if you must, but wouldn&#39;t it be better to paint a picture or write a <br/>
letter, bake a cake or plant a seed, ponder the difference between want and <br/>
need?  Dust if you must, but there&#39;s not much time, with rivers to swim <br/>
andmountains to climb, music to hear and books to read, friends to cherishand <br/>
life to lead.  Dust if you must, but the world&#39;s out there with the sun in <br/>
your eyes,the wind in your hair, a flutter of snow, a shower of rain. This <br/>
day will not come around again.  Dust if you must, but bear in mind, old age <br/>
will come and it&#39;s not kind. And when you go - and go you must - you, <br/>
yourself will make more dust!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
