i agree maryellen, and wonder what is really the point of that anyway?  like <br/>
who started that and WHY?  why not just leave the inspiration to stand on its <br/>
own?  o well!  erin<br/>

I also get annoyed at all the cutesy ones that say send this to everyone<br/>
you consider a friend, including the person who sent it to you.  Though<br/>
some of the messages are nice and worth reading, I wouldn&#39;t want<br/>
everything i send out to get sent back to me.  it&#39;s hard enough to keep<br/>
up already.<br/>
