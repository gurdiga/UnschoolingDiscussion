<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sang quoted me from an article: <br/>
&gt; -=-=<br/>
&gt; For some, this is their first real conversation with a person who isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; grown<br/>
&gt; to adulthood. My kids are used to being the first, in that way. They&#39;re used<br/>
&gt; to the look in people&#39;s eyes when they realize that here is a child who has<br/>
&gt; something to talk about and who will confidently and guilelessly speak.~~~&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then wrote: <br/>
&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt; Wow... That gives me hope that I&#39;m at least on the right track. Wyl has <br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; like that since he could talk-18 months? 2 years old?-People would look at <br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; baffled, questioning, uncertain. Until I read that, I had just assumed it <br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; a &quot;safety&quot; kind of issue, &quot;You&#39;re letting your toddler/preschooler talk to a<br/>
&gt; complete stranger without you guarding (hovering over) him?!&quot;. He&#39;s always <br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; a natural, voluminous talker, eager to share all that happened to him that<br/>
&gt; day, that week, this lifetime... :~) Glad to know we haven&#39;t inadvertently<br/>
&gt; stifled that in our bumbling to be the best parents we can be. Thanks for <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; little peace of mind.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That clarifies something for me and might be a good thing for further <br/>
discussion.   It IS comforting and calming, something about this ability to talk to <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
If someone tried to be abusive or inappropriate to my kids, my kids would <br/>
tell them so. <br/>
And later, my kids would not hesitate to tell others what happened.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something in &quot;be seen but not heard&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t talk to strangers&quot; <br/>
and &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear any backtalk&quot; and &quot;Be quiet, adults are talking&quot; and <br/>
ALL that layer of kid-hushing attitude and behavior that puts kids in danger.<br/>
<br/>
A kid who is told not to talk to strangers won&#39;t be prepared to tell a <br/>
stranger off.<br/>
A kid who has been shushed and belittled isn&#39;t likely to trust that he will <br/>
be heard and trusted if he has a serious offense to report.<br/>

I love that book.  I have never really told my kids not to talk to strangers<br/>
(because I do it all the time!), but I have told them that if something<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem right, it probably isn&#39;t, and you don&#39;t have to continue to<br/>
converse, or even be near, a person that makes you uncomfortable.  It&#39;s all<br/>
about listening to your instincts.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Consider your alternatives, and make a conscious, mindful choice about how to <br/>
advise your kids.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t talk to strangers&quot; is a rule.   <br/>
What   is the principle?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/benrules">http://sandradodd.com/benrules</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<br/>
If you ask us what you should let your kids do, you&#39;re asking for another <br/>
rule, a new and different set of rules.<br/>
<br/>
Dump all rules and go for underlying purposes.<br/>
<br/>
My mom said &quot;Never play in the barn with David &quot; (my nextdoor neighbor).   <br/>
She didn&#39;t say why.   She didn&#39;t say &quot;nor any outbuilding,&quot; it was &quot;the barn&quot; <br/>
and &quot;David.&quot;    David was never inappropriate with us, and I was unprepared for <br/>
whatever it was my mom was envisioning.    She didn&#39;t explain.   I couldn&#39;t <br/>
generalize it to other boys or other places.   And the sexual abuse that DID <br/>
happen in our family was female cousin a year older than my sister messing with <br/>
her.   My mom didn&#39;t prepare us for any real situations, just made a <br/>
magic-bullet rule which wasn&#39;t effective.   But for her own peace of mind, she had &quot;told <br/>
us what to do.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that was said to kids ALL THE TIME in those days was &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
take candy from strangers.&quot;   Huh.   What about Cokes?   Gum?   *Cash*?   What <br/>
about candy from known individuals?    Their intent was to advise children not <br/>
to be lured or bribed into a situation of indebtedness to a predatory man.    <br/>
That intent wasn&#39;t usually clear to children.   It was just a rule.    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes! I&#39;m sure they see you in the grocery store, and unless you&#39;re in a <br/>
very small town, the person you ask for directions is a stranger, as is <br/>
the meat man and the cashier; and yet you *seek them out* AND speak to <br/>
them! Your kids will pick up on how you&#39;re different with those you know <br/>
well vs those you&#39;ve just spoken to for the first time -- they will <br/>
emulate that and experiment on their own, if allowed the freedom to do <br/>
so.  Do your kids keep to themselves at the park or do they play with <br/>
whomever is close by?  My kids go thru stages of wanting only those they <br/>
know to play and then seeking out newbies to include.  I&#39;ve met more <br/>
than a few friends because my kids have sought out the children first <br/>
&lt;g&gt; (especially at the Live and Learn conference, where everyone is a <br/>
stranger the first day, but not so much by the last!). <br/>
<br/>
Your fears should remain just that: *YOURS* and not passed down to your <br/>
kids without serious deep thought to the consequences (of the FEAR, not <br/>
what you&#39;re afraid of)<br/>
<br/>
When my kids get stuck in a social situation, I&#39;m on hand to <br/>
coach/negotiate/interpret whatever is asked of me; I&#39;m also ready and <br/>
willing to help with prep (who&#39;s gonna be there, what to expect) for <br/>
specific situations and to decompress after a particularly stressful <br/>
situations (family members who are virtual strangers, but want to be <br/>
treated as *family*). <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a good situation for pondering: what to do when Gramma is the <br/>
stranger and demands the props of grandmotherhood?<br/>
It took a long time for my MIL to accept my children will not be forced <br/>
into intimacy, but will hug and kiss when they feel the desire to do <br/>
so.  She is much better at patience, as the genuine showing of affection <br/>
feels much better than the obligatory ones. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can remember talking to a guy in an alley near my cousins&#39; house in<br/>
Wichita.  I was with my younger cousin.  Apparently we were seen<br/>
speaking to this guy.  I got in big trouble later for talking to a<br/>
stranger with my younger cousin.  I can remember being told that as I<br/>
was older I should know better.  But the guy was nice and chatty, and<br/>
nothing bad happened.  And he didn&#39;t offer us candy, which I&#39;d been<br/>
warned about. And nothing happened, except that the adults got scared<br/>
and didn&#39;t know what to do with that fear except to make me<br/>
accountable for it.  I can understand the fear, but not really the<br/>
making me accountable for it--I was 8, I think.  It didn&#39;t stop me<br/>
later from getting into a car with a guy from a diner I worked in who<br/>
offered me drugs and then refused to take me and my friend home unless<br/>
we kissed him.  Nor did the knowledge that I shouldn&#39;t have taken a<br/>
ride from him keep me from getting me and my friend back home without<br/>
kissing him (she was going to kiss him--I threatened to turn him into<br/>
the police, I think my tactic was probably the better choice).  Nor<br/>
did it stop me from taking a ride from a guy on a moped when I was<br/>
waiting for a bus to get to an art gallery opening that the artist had<br/>
invited me to.  The moped rider turned up the wrong street after<br/>
feeling up my leg, slowing just enough on the turn for me to jump off<br/>
and flee for the bus which I caught before he came back for me. But,<br/>
them telling me not to talk to strangers kept me from telling my<br/>
parents about any of those things happening to me. I have a friend who<br/>
was raped who didn&#39;t tell her mom because she had been told not to<br/>
talk to strangers and the fear of hearing &quot;I told you so&quot; kept her<br/>
from being open when she could have used the support.  But it didn&#39;t<br/>
keep her from telling her friends at school about not accepting rides<br/>
from strangers. I guess what I am saying is that my parents rule about<br/>
not talking to strangers only kept me from admitting my conversations<br/>
with strangers to them and didn&#39;t keep me from having them.    <br/>
<br/>
As a side note The Jimmy Neutron movie is all about not talking to<br/>
strangers.  Jimmy sends a message into space that gets picked up by<br/>

now?!  And thank goodness for it, really.  I would not have grown nearly <br/>
as much as i have without the benefit of many of the posts here, written <br/>
by people unknown to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118554062">Instant messages and stranger danger:<br/>
<br/>
Someone IMed me years back saying we had the same birthday.   I could have <br/>
said &quot;get lost, creep&quot; or just closed it and turned off my computer, but instead <br/>
I made a friend with a man from northern Germany who has the same birthday I <br/>
do to the year.   He&#39;s been to visit me twice, and lives in the U.S. now, <br/>
married to someone from Texas. &lt;g&gt;   We&#39;ve talked each other through personal <br/>
dramas (more his dramas than mine, poor guy) and it&#39;s been really very nice for <br/>
both of us.<br/>
<br/>
A guy wrote once and asked me if I wanted to fool around.   He was very <br/>
polite about it.   I didn&#39;t want to, but I did have a friend who had told me the <br/>
week before that she would love to just have a casual fling with someone who <br/>
would not then want her to &quot;be his girlfriend.&quot;   I inquired in both directions, <br/>
asked some questions to satisfy my own mind so that I could feel that I wasn&#39;t <br/>
putting my friend in danger, and they saw each other several times.   Nobody <br/>
was hurt or sorrowful about it.   She was glad; I didn&#39;t check back with him. &lt;<br/>
g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Strangers have talked to me in grocery store lines and restaurants my whole <br/>
life, and some end up telling me about a death from which they haven&#39;t <br/>
recovered (maybe told lots of people, but for some reason people tell me their stuff). <br/>
  One man I met at a medieval banquet sat and told me his wife had died <br/>
trying to save their son from drowning.   Both drowned.   There wasn&#39;t anything <br/>
more important for me to do then and there but to let him tell his story, and <br/>
comfort him.   He didn&#39;t try to &quot;fool around with me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I helped an older woman who couldn&#39;t start her car one day outside <br/>
a Blake&#39;s.   She might&#39;ve been afraid for a big teenaged boy to offer to help <br/>
her, but maybe because I was there it helped make it okay.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have seen me not be afraid of strangers, and have seen me sometimes <br/>
wary in a situation too, and that&#39;s a better way for them to figure out how to <br/>
decide.    Then too, though, some people have a better sense of other people&#39;s <br/>
motives and intent, but no matter how good they are at reading people some <br/>
people have the sociopathic talent of   masking their ill intent very well.   <br/>
All that is good for kids to consider, as they get older and it comes into the <br/>
conversation.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an interesting point.... I&#39;m not sure Wyl would at this point (but he <br/>
IS only 6 1/2), but I&#39;m not sure he wouldn&#39;t, either... He thinks nothing of <br/>
telling an adult they&#39;re wrong when it comes to something he knows (dinosaurs, <br/>
space, etc.), so maybe THAT&#39;S a good sign... I know he WON&#39;T tell <br/>
Santa-at-the-mall anything negative... maybe its time to start countering some of that <br/>
general Santa negativity (be good/be NICE or Santa won&#39;t bring you toys) that is <br/>
so prevalent in society... books, t.v., cartoons, grandparents... Another one <br/>
of those &quot;reward/punishment&quot; things I&#39;ve started reading about in Alphie <br/>
Kohn&#39;s book, anyway... He DEFINITELY doesn&#39;t want to sit on Santa&#39;s lap, and seems <br/>
VERY uncomfortable about the idea. I&#39;ve never had a problem with my son not <br/>
wanting to sit on a strange man&#39;s lap!! Just that above line has given me a <br/>
whole new scope of things to think about. Good time of year to re-examine those <br/>
things, too. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
