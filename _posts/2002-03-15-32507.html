<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I remember either reading, or hearing on TV a mom saying that her 5yo saw <br/>
&gt; the 911 clips and said &#39;how cool!&#39; so she was upset and preceeded to tell <br/>
&gt; him of all the kids that lost their parents and the tragedy behind it etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This sounded wrong, IMNSHO, for the reasons that this child didn&#39;t need <br/>
&gt; to know this. He didn&#39;t need to bring it into his world YET. I felt very <br/>
&gt; sad for that child.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 3 kids reacted differnetly to it.....My 8 yr old son knew it was real but <br/>
did not imagine the scope of the loss til he saw more the following days. My <br/>
5 yr old tiwns: BOY: HOW COOL??????neeeeeeeeowwwww plane sounds followed. <br/>
Girl : MOOOOM!!! twirling around the living room. We SAAAW this before. I was <br/>
glad for their innocence. As time progressed, she noticed flags everywhere <br/>
and on cars esp. and commented everytime: Those are for the people who died <br/>
when the plane hit the bldg. It seemed to me that was the most horrific thing <br/>
they&#39;ve ever seen adn they let it in slowly as they could handle it and <br/>
reason it out. Im sure its still surreal to them as it was to me..........for <br/>
a very long time. THanks everyone for your tv opinions. I do guide the 5 yr <br/>
olds in tv watching becasue of their reasoning. I guess im wondering about <br/>
their older years and even though we dont have MUCH shoot em up games on <br/>
computer, some are. SO that subconscious thing is a valid point. Denise<br/>

&gt; couldn&#39;t handle seeing something such as 9/11 or even Monsters Inc., he is <br/>
&gt; just sensitive and gets scared easily. My older son however has seen <br/>
&gt; things, such as Star Wars or 9/11 and is able to process the information in <br/>
&gt; a different way. He talks through a lot of things. He to this day still <br/>
&gt; talks about the fire we had over a year ago, they are just different. For <br/>
&gt; us, it would have felt wrong to not let him know the truth (instead of him <br/>
&gt; just seeing that his mommy was upset and not knowing why).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Of course it does.  Anyone who says any different doesn&#39;t want to face<br/>
&gt; reality.  yes you can sit and discuss things with kids and supposedly that<br/>
&gt; helps them but if they see death in one form or another or violence in one<br/>
&gt; form or another on a daily basis, it desensitizes them to the real thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you see car chases on television and they are &quot;fun&quot; and everyone is<br/>
&gt; getting excited by them, &quot;wow, look at that,&quot; &quot;ooooh, they almost crashed,&quot;<br/>
&gt; etc., the real thing is not going to be as dramatic.  If you have never <br/>
&gt; seen<br/>
&gt; a car crash and witness one for the first time IRL, it is dramatic, no<br/>
&gt; punches pulled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One good example is medical personnel.  The first time they see someone<br/>
&gt; bleeding out or a dead body, it is traumatic.  A few years down the road <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; it is no longer as traumatic and for some folks not traumatic at all.<br/>

I&#39;ve got a friend who sees a Catholic psychic,  perhaps a psychicc who<br/>
happens to be in the Catholic church would be a better way to phrase<br/>
it......though I suppose that doesn&#39;t make sense for traditional or ultra<br/>
conservatives.<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell me more about your psychic gift....do you &#39;read auras&#39; or<br/>
somehow have a sense about people that comes from a spiritual realm?  Do you<br/>
comunicate with angels to get a gist of the person who comes to see you?<br/>
