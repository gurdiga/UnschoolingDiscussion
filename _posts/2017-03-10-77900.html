<div id="ygrps-yiv-853055591"><div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>I think struggling is a waste of resources. It is like spinning your tires in the mud. You burn gas and go nowhere. Now, you *might* eventually get out of the mud, but if you take the time to find a ramp, get a tow, or just have a cup of tea and wait for a better idea, what else can you do with the time you would have used to spin the wheels?<br><br></div>My observation of my kids is that they always, ALWAYS, pursue the things that give them joy. Sometimes they get frustrated and appear to be struggling, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening, I don&#39;t think. What&#39;s happening is that they KNOW they can do it, and the pace of their progress on the task they are choosing is not keeping up with their vision of where they will be when they master it. That disconnect is frustrating. They are not spinning wheels pointlessly; they are aware that they are getting there, just more slowly than feels happy right in that moment.<br><br></div>As a mom, I find that it is very difficult for me if I think my kids are struggling. I want to intercede; to help them get past that feeling. When they are working, and frustrated, I have found that the challenge for me is to support them rather than try to get them to stop so that *I* don&#39;t have to feel uncomfortable with their process. That&#39;s *my* work to do.<br><br></div>Sarah<br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-853055591gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-853055591gmail_quote">On Fri, Mar 10, 2017 at 10:43 AM, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:amberuby@...">amberuby@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-853055591gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

<br/>
I would say that what he’s really seeing is the backlash against struggling towards a goal *they increasingly don’t believe in* is increasing.<br/>
<br/>
With the greater emphasis on teaching to the test, school feels less and less relevant.<br/>
<br/>
At least in the past, for many kids, it felt possible to put up with school to get the grades and get into college. Now, after years and years of more and more work that feels less and less relevant, they’re understandably balking. They’re asking, “What’s the point?” and not being satisfied with an answer that was never satisfying to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
To invest time and effort into something, you need to believe the time and effort will pay off. <br/>
<br/>
That insular belief that schools provide what kids need, makes it easy to justify blaming the kids when the system doesn’t work.<br/>
<br/>
It’s like the person who asks, “Why is everyone so mean to me?” Is it everyone? Or might the root of the problem be in the common factor:  you?<br/>
<br/>
Kids are still kids. The thing that’s changed is school. And the expectations of parents that all kids will be going to college, whether they have any idea what they want to do in life or not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has spent time with kids playing video games *knows* that kids know that sometimes a lot of effort needs to go into reaching a goal. Sometimes the effort isn’t pleasant. But kids weigh the worth of the goal versus what it takes to reach it. If the goal doesn’t feel worth the effort, they’ll go find something that is worth their time.<br/>
<br/>
School feels like it’s wasting their time. If teachers keep dismissing that feedback as just kids being lazy, it’s only going to get worse for teachers and kids.<br/>

I had to learn it by doing each tiny part of the step a bit at a time and then the next part and then the next...  Then I would know what the step was supposed to be and I would have to practice it slowly, slowly day after day until I could get up to full speed. I had one other friend who had to learn the steps like this. We would practice together.

We both would be so proud when we would master each step. And with each step, our confidence in our bodies grew and our ability to learn new steps grew. In the end, my friend and I became very passable dancers who really loved dancing. No, neither of us would ever be dancing professionally, but I managed to do well enough to be a number of musicals and danced in each of them, keeping up with the folks who could dance circles around most of us.  </div><div><br></div><div>Now, playing piano is another thing that I did not take to naturally.

It seems essential if you want to master and excel, and whether you struggle or not is up to you. She could have struggled by trying to learn the way others do, or emulate another approach. But instead she knew what she needed and practiced that way, deliberately. Even people who are &#39;naturals&#39; will come to points that are challenging, though I don&#39;t think the struggle is inherent- we bring that energy ourselves.

But I also imagine that practicing, for many, is an enjoyable experience, not a struggle, and that’s why they keep at it.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p><span></span></p><p>Plus, the aspect of having a choice is key (noting that my friend used the term “have to” in regards to struggling). Are there times when someone might choose to struggle at something? When I go to open a jar with a stuck lid, I don’t keep struggling with it. I choose lots of other options – tap the lid on the counter, use a lid grip, ask someone else for help.</p><p><br></p><p>~Amber</p><div><br></div><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-559820174m_-3349700774773298930yui-cursor"></span></p><p></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825420607">-=-Anyone who has spent time with kids playing video games *knows* that kids know that sometimes a lot of effort needs to go into reaching a goal. Sometimes the effort isn’t pleasant. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the effort IS pleasant.  I saw my kids learn tons of things effortlessly, joyfully, while laughing and hanging out with friends.<br/>
<br/>
I’m pretty sure some of the same teachers who complain that kids won’t “struggle” are jealous and resentful of fun things, and of joy.<br/>
<br/>
I’m going back to my own last sentence.  &quot;I’m pretty sure some of the same teachers…” and parents and childless adults who WANT kids to struggle and suffer and sit down and shut up and stop having fun…..   <br/>
<br/>
I want to change “some” to “most” and guess that the numbers woud be over a billion if we could have a worldwide show of hands.<br/>
<br/>
I’m glad you sent your friend the link to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/battle">http://sandradodd.com/battle</a><br/>
<br/>
Another page he might possibly be interested in would be <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>
Maybe it’s not related, but I bet at least he would laugh and recognize some of the same energy.<br/>
<br/>
Depending what he’s teaching, and then regardless of what he’s teaching, the importance of EVERY child (or even a majority) engaging in a STRUGGLE is not important to every child, it’s only important for the teacher’s stats, so he can prove he “taught” so he can earn his pay.  That’s not something teachers want to look right at or think about (nor something most of them have even ever considered).<br/>
<br/>
Most of my teachers told me their class was the most important of all my classes.  But they didn’t know for sure that music, art, driver’s ed or typing weren’t the most important class I was taking.  Still, most of them truly believed it, or hoped the kids would believe it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202705078">-=-To invest time and effort into something, you need to believe the time and effort will pay off. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Any kids who are observant and actually DO understand some mathematical concepts will have figured out that grades are competition, and the skewed bell curve is a fixed reality, so that no matter how much some of the struggle, even if ALL struggled to the max, still not more that 15% will get an A, nearly that many will get D or F, and the others will be in the B and C range (depending on the names of the striations or the numbers associated with them, I mean).<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine worked in a private high school, after working in museums for a long time.  The first semester, she assigned grades as she knew was required and expected in public school, and the office called her in and explained that those parents paid a lot of money, and all the kids should get A’s and B’s.    She was indignant about it, but I was just amused (at my unschooling, kids nearly grown distance).  It was just another proof that comparing “gradepoint averages” is worthless, and that the angst and sorrow poured over the whole topic by parents and teens applying to universities and all that is a worldwide festival of sorrowful jackoff.  I’m making light of it because this is an unschooling discussion.  In many families it is NOT a light matter.  It is a matter of life and sometimes death.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930873450"><div dir="ltr">A friend of mine who attended a small private, college told me that there was a professor who was known to reward females for wearing a skirt and sitting in the front row of the classroom by giving them nothing less than a &quot;C&quot; in his classes. <div><br></div><div>She thought that it was funny, and was perplexed that I saw it as less than amusing. </div><div><br></div><div>As a child, I didn&#39;t care about grades. I usually got good grades because it was easier to do the work and get a decent grade than to not do the work and suffer the wrath of the various adults in my life (not the least of which were my parents). </div><div><br></div><div>When spelling tests were a part of school for me (elementary school?) my grades in spelling were lower (B&#39;s) than for most other subjects. I am mildly dyslexic (an imperfect term, to be sure, but it makes my point) and so I would inevitably reverse a few letters in a couple of words every test. I was apparently labeled as &quot;smart&quot; so several of my teachers would always explain this &quot;failure&quot; as me being &quot;lazy&quot; because I obviously did not work &quot;hard enough&quot; or I would have gotten a &quot;better&quot; grade.  </div><div><br></div><div>For whatever reason (I have been described as &quot;naturally contrary&quot; by relatives) I never really cared about what grades I got. My parents generally would ask more about what I did and how I liked things at school, not what grades I had received and so I didn&#39;t get a lot of pressure about grades. I think my parents may have worried or been upset if I got &quot;bad&quot; grades, but since a &quot;B&quot; isn&#39;t really bad, they didn&#39;t stress. I remember thinking that it was weird that my teachers seemed to be more worried about what grades I received than me or my parents.  As an adult, I realize that they had statistics to worry about and would have to answer questions about why a child who tested well was not getting good grades. I always did very well on standardized tests. </div><div><br></div><div>I truly believe that test taking is a talent that I was born with. I read about how to do well on tests like this (or it was read to me? I was very young and did not read &quot;early&quot;) and always did well on standardized tests. I have taught people how to do well on these tests. A coworker of mine had never taken a standardized test until she had to sit for her social work licensure exam. She did very poorly the first time she took the test. After I tutored her on testing skills, and she took a couple of practice exams, she more than doubled her performance and passed with a very good score. </div><div><br></div><div>I have met people who help to construct tests like the ones that they give children in schools and they honestly believe that the tests that they give these kids actually measure something other than the ability to take a certain kind of test. </div><div>Chris</div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1930873450gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1930873450gmail_quote">On Sat, Mar 11, 2017 at 12:36 AM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781354574"><div dir="ltr">My son was a &quot;late&quot; reader. I am not entirely sure that he wasn&#39;t reading some, but we read for him, he used audio books, etc and really got along quite well. When he was about 14, he just started reading--and his reading was at least &quot;on grade level&quot; or maybe a bit &quot;above&quot; grade level. Basically, I noticed that he was was reading the same stuff that his schooly friends were all reading so I guess that is what I mean by &quot;on grade level&quot;. And he would regularly read stuff that was from technical manuals for college level courses, which I am supposing is above the grade level that your average 14 year old would be. <div><br></div><div>Either way, we did occasionally talk about phonics through the years because I learned to read and spell using phonics and so I would share what I knew when the subject would come up as to why something was spelled the way it was spelled. I was just struck that most people probably don&#39;t talk about why things are spelled how they are or what languages words have come from. I guess we are a &quot;wordy&quot; crowd....  </div><div><br></div><div>Our home has always been full of books, we have always read out loud as a family or listened to audio books (the fully produced/acted ones are amazing) and we all use/used the written word on a daily basis. We never stressed about when anyone would learn to read or who was reading or wasn&#39;t... though my son did seem to feel that he was &quot;behind&quot; sometimes. I tried to reassure him that he would be reading one day and that everyone learns at a different pace. I would point out how many very complicated things he knew and could do already and that there were many kids his age that found those things difficult.  </div><div><br></div><div>Now that he is nearly 21, he still has some trouble spelling sometimes, but knows how to look things up or asks someone and is a happy reader who has no &quot;baggage&quot; around reading. He likes reading, he reads for pleasure, he reads for purpose... </div><div><br></div><div>This in contrast to my own process learning to read which I remember being painful and unpleasant and full of misery. The irony of this is that I am pretty certain that I wasn&#39;t a confident reader to somewhere around 14 when reading just made sense. My theory as to why this happened is that my brain just developed what it needed for reading to get easy. I think that the same thing happened with my son but he skipped the misery part.  Unschooling win!</div><div>chris</div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1781354574gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1781354574gmail_quote">On Sat, Mar 11, 2017 at 6:00 AM, &#39;Rinelle&#39; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rinelle@...">rinelle@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1781354574gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

<font color="#212121" face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:15px;">Same thing here - also with telling time. My son got an awesome Harry Potter pocket watch for his 10th birthday - and had never told time using an analog clock before that. We had a 10 minute
 conversation in the car about how each portion was five minutes, then he sat in silence for about 20 minutes, then he could tell time to the minute. Definitely no struggle.</span></font><br>
<br>
<font color="#212121" face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:15px;">Recently, he wanted to learn to tie his shoelaces. He&#39;s still 10, though closer to 11. I guess most people would think it outrageous&nbsp;a 10 year old didn&#39;t tie his shoelaces?! Anyway - we sat
 together with a spare pair of shoes and he copied me twice, then he could do it. I&#39;m pretty sure if we&#39;d tried that at 5 or 6 - when conventional parenting dictates, before his dexterity and hand-eye coordination was really ready, it would have been way more
 of a struggle, too.<br>
<br>
It seems the &#39;struggle&#39; only happens when you are trying to force kids to do something they aren&#39;t developmentally ready to do yet and/or aren&#39;t interested in.<br>
