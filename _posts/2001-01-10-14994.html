<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534601220">&quot;You don&#39;t have to pay for acting lessons or buy a<br/>
horribly expensive real <br/>
piano to see whether a child wants to pursue<br/>
something.  You can expose them <br/>
to more examples and you can provide them with<br/>
materials/ideas/experiences <br/>
very inexpensively at home&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with this. My seven year old was<br/>
drumming on everything, begging for a drumset. We<br/>
agonized over how to come up with the $ to get him a<br/>
set for xmass, finally deciding on Bongos as a<br/>
starter---- sort of a test to see whether or not it<br/>
was a phase or he was really into percussion. Well, it<br/>
seems we cured him of any interest in drums! Since<br/>
xmass, he hasnt drummed on anything, including the<br/>
bongos. Boy, am I glad we didnt spend hundreds of $ on<br/>
a drumset.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying your son wont play the piano if you get<br/>
one, but we really thought Jay was going to be a<br/>
fabulous drummer, and now we know better. He may still<br/>
play drums, after all - he&#39;s only 7 1/2, but I dont<br/>
think a drumset was the deciding factor for his talent<br/>
or ambition.<br/>
