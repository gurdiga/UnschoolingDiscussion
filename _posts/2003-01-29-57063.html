&lt;&lt; Are there others here that would be willing to host an unschooler for a <br/>
few weeks? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We could do it for about a week. We have a tiny house, but Sierra sleeps with <br/>
me anyway, so there&#39;d be a spare room.<br/>
As long as the unschooler could put up with one small bathroom and six people <br/>
in a small house, we&#39;d be happy to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979505592">My kids are 14, 10 (soon to be 11) and 7 (soon to be 8).<br/>
<br/>
The oldest is a boy.  He wants to go to Australia, to Sydney.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas as to how I can get him there?  Work camps or anything that will accept a 14/15 year old?<br/>

<br/>
Daughter (10):  Chatting, singing, writing, gymnastics, swimming (for fun..she&#39;s sick of the team LOL), fashion design, modeling, shopping, make up, interior decorating, riding bike<br/>

<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
