<div id="ygrps-yiv-973144474">Hi,<br/>
 does anyone else read their yahoo groups messages on the <br/>
website? If so, have you noticed the KWICK PICK  ad? I wondered<br/>
because it totally grosses me out! It is difficult for me to <br/>
read the messages, because as I am reading, there is a pick drilling<br/>
into a keyhole, that reminds me of an ear, so there is this constant <br/>
ear drilling thing going on.<br/>

As I was reading your post, there it was, the lock I had barely <br/>
noticed before, transformed into an EAR!! With that pick jabbing into <br/>
it!  LOL<br/>
