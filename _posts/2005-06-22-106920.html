Is  it  <br/>
important, for the sake of the younger child, in my case aged 7,  to  <br/>
intervene when the older child (14) is behaving more like a  same-aged  <br/>
sibling ie. bickering, correcting and controlling on a  regular basis?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s absolutely crucial for each person to feel safe and at peace  in <br/>
his own home.<br/>
 <br/>
If you would intervene if a stranger burst in the door and started arguing  <br/>
with or controlling your seven year old, why would you let anyone else do  that?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-He responds/reacts to every little word and action his  <br/>
sister  makes.  He choses every battle with her. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not choosing if it&#39;s a kneejerk constant.<br/>
Tell him if someone from outside the family treated him badly you would  step <br/>
in immediately, and so you need to do that for Zoe just as you would do it  <br/>
for him.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-At other times, especially when  <br/>
I feel like I&#39;ve been  intervening constantly, I back off and let the  <br/>
chips fall where they  may. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;ve been intervening constantly, Zach isn&#39;t getting the point.   Are <br/>
you maybe making rules instead of instilling principles?  Are you maybe  <br/>
&quot;intervening&quot; in such particular ways (&quot;give it back&quot; or &quot;Leave her alone&quot;) that  the <br/>
solution isn&#39;t applicable to the next situation ten minutes later?<br/>
 <br/>

and chose his &quot;battles&quot; carefully.  He called me on that  one.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Called you on it how?<br/>
There should be NO &quot;battles.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Is she keeping him from having space and privacy?  You need to guard  his <br/>
peace too.<br/>

How about moving toward treating them as people  rather than children,  so <br/>
they can treat each other as people, not &quot;as siblings.&quot;  He should be  treating <br/>
her the way he treats neighbors, strangers, friends.  Too many  families use <br/>
&quot;sibling rivalry&quot; as a license to ignore their  kids.  It&#39;s cruel and <br/>
neglectful.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
He shouldn&#39;t even be thinking of parenting.  He&#39;s not a parent. <br/>

<br/>
Michael (16) has done this with Alyssa (11). I think that as kids <br/>
get older, they watch a little more. They notice how effective our <br/>
parenting is. And, in our case, he thinks I&#39;m not being very <br/>
effective. &lt;g&gt; He thinks that Alyssa is &quot;getting away with&quot; all <br/>
kinds of things. And he thinks he can correct the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of during the heat of the moment, I pulled Michael aside and <br/>
said, &quot;I know you&#39;re trying to help me, but it&#39;s not really helping. <br/>
Instead, it makes Alyssa feel like we&#39;re ganging up on her, and then <br/>
we have another problem starting up. So, even though you think I&#39;m <br/>
not doing a great job, I need you to keep your thoughts to yourself <br/>
and come to me afterwards if you have suggestions or ideas. You&#39;re <br/>
her brother, not her parent.&quot; Like Sandra said, sometimes it&#39;s more <br/>
of a knee-jerk reaction on his part. And that just means it&#39;s a bad <br/>
habit that needs work.<br/>
<br/>
Something I just thought of... maybe I should have a conversation <br/>
with Michael about the coolness of being &quot;the big brother.&quot; How <br/>
younger siblings might be more open to older sibling advice at <br/>
quieter times. And, I would think it might have a big impact - maybe <br/>
even a great sibling-bonding kind of conversation. Although this <br/>
will have to wait, since Michael is in Japan for the summer. sigh.<br/>

Telling  her to hold his hand in the parking lot is one I like him  <br/>
chosing  but telling her not to sing out loud as we walk down a nature  <br/>
path  is not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Sounds to me like he needs some help in asking nicely.  <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t sing!&#39; or &quot;Hold my hand!&quot; are commands.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Susie, did you hear that woodpecker?&quot; or &quot;I feel we&#39;re safer when I hold  <br/>
your hand, Susie.&quot; are ways to ask for what he wants which also show her that he <br/>
 cares for her.  <br/>
 <br/>
When my youngest was a baby, I helped my older sons find ways to deal with  <br/>
the baby and get what they want without making him cry.  Sometimes the baby  <br/>
would pick up a particular toy they had just been using, say, a matchbox car,  <br/>
which they wanted back.  I showed them they could trade with him, not just  <br/>
grab it out of his hand or complain that Will had the toy.   They  learned to <br/>
give him something else, and not just some baby toy, to get the car  back.  They <br/>
also learned that the baby would interrupt them a lot, but if  they gave him <br/>
their full attention at that moment, he would soon lose interest  and they <br/>
could get back to what they were doing.  <br/>
 <br/>
To my oldest sons, it seemed like they were learning &quot;tricks&quot; at  first.  <br/>
They didn&#39;t want to make him cry, because they loved  him.  They soon realized <br/>
these weren&#39;t actually tricks and wouldn&#39;t  work for long because the baby <br/>
adapted and the boys had to learn new ways to get  what they wanted while they <br/>
played.  They couldn&#39;t be fake or obvious with  him, because they realized he <br/>
knew.  He amazed them with how much he knew  and could learn, and so they spent <br/>
time trying to teach him new things and  playing with him.  Kind of like he was <br/>
a toy, at first, but then it  became a relationship, as he started toddling <br/>
around.<br/>
 <br/>
I will say that my middle and youngest (9 years apart) reached a point  when <br/>
the middle was about 14 or 15 where they were like oil and water.  I  could no <br/>
longer allow them to be at home alone together.  I really can&#39;t  say the <br/>
younger one was an instigator, ever.  He was just being 5 or 6, but  the older one <br/>
couldn&#39;t take it.  Low tolerance.  It was an awful time  there for a while.  <br/>
I just kept them apart as much as possible until the  older one could mellow <br/>
out.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s a good idea to apologize to your son for the way you treated  <br/>
him earlier (I&#39;ve done that).  Have a good talk with him about how you see  <br/>
things now, and display that you&#39;ve had a serious, life-encompassing change of  <br/>
heart.  Talk about how it&#39;s never too late to do better, and that&#39;s what  you&#39;re <br/>
trying to do for him, and for his sister.  Listen to him, too.   Ask him why <br/>
he thinks it&#39;s okay to treat her that way; what&#39;s going through his  mind <br/>
which leads to the words, etc.  Demonstrate a loving relationship with  him, and <br/>
show him how to pass it on to his sister.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s worth it.<br/>

good reasons he told her to hold his hand, but...Why is he, instead of <br/>
you, responsible for her in the parking lot? Could you have told her <br/>
to hold his hand? Could you have held his hand while he carried <br/>
packages or whatever? I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s too much focus on <br/>
responsibility right now. Maybe you can try to remove a bunch of that <br/>
and let him figure out how to be more of a friend.<br/>
<br/>
You said you try to give him alone time, but what are you doing when <br/>
they are together? Does he think you should be doing more, telling her <br/>
not to sing loudly etc.? <br/>

her well being, physically and emotionally. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Isn&#39;t that asking too much of a sibling?  If it happens naturally,  great, <br/>
but to set it up so that if he doesn&#39;t love and care deeply for her he&#39;s  &quot;done <br/>
it wrong&quot; or been a bad brother doesn&#39;t seem fair.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s really not my job to care deeply for my sister&#39;s physical and  emotional <br/>
wellbeing.  Some seasons I do, and some seasons she&#39;s been  irresponsible and <br/>
irritating and I would rather not get involved with her  stuff.   But we&#39;re <br/>
grown.  When we were little I had even less  energy and ability to feel <br/>
responsible for her.  (Not that I didn&#39;t very  often end up being and doing more for <br/>
her than my mom did, but when it&#39;s  voluntary it&#39;s my choice.)<br/>
 <br/>
What I tell my kids is &quot;If you can&#39;t make it better, at least don&#39;t make it  <br/>
worse.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
With that as my preferred position for them to take, they most often DO  make <br/>
each others&#39; lives better voluntarily.<br/>

makes you feel that way?  Little brothers can be annoying...do you need some <br/>
time away?  Something along those lines.  It quickly became, my little <br/>
brother is a pest but I guess I love him anyway.  I think just knowing it <br/>
was ok to be annoyed instead being made to feel guilty, like she&#39;s done <br/>
something wrong (like when she says that type of thing in front of mil) made <br/>
it easier for her to spend so much time with him.  Which is good, because <br/>
most days she doesn&#39;t have a lot of choice in that particular area.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might try just reflecting and validating what&#39;s going on for both<br/>
children.  &quot;Were you worried about her in the parking lot?&quot; (And to<br/>
the daughter), &quot;Did you feel like you&#39;re old enough to look for cars<br/>
on your own?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again, on the nature path, &quot;Is the singing bothering you, or do you<br/>
just think she shouldn&#39;t do it here?&quot;  And to your daughter, &quot;You just<br/>
feel so happy that you&#39;re singing, is that right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you start there, then both kids&#39; feelings and needs are out on the<br/>
table, and that&#39;s a good place to start discussing and finding solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I can&#39;t find the quote now, but I thought that you said that<br/>
your son corrects your daughter because he doesn&#39;t think you&#39;re doing<br/>
a good enough job with your parenting, that you should control and<br/>
correct more?  Did I remember that right?<br/>
<br/>
If those were your words, I would try to *shift* out of this being a<br/>
reflection on your parenting -- it may not be about *you* at all. <br/>
Maybe your son just has a need for quiet and control, and having his<br/>
sister around all the time, in his home and in his private places, is<br/>
really challenging.  Maybe he needs lots of opportunity to express how<br/>
difficult that is, and to talk and vent about it in a way that doesnt&#39;<br/>
hurt your daughter (to you, privately), instead of trying to live up<br/>
to a (possibly unrealistic) expectation that he be loving all the time<br/>
like he is with people outside of the house.<br/>
