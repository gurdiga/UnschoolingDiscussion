&lt;&lt; Southerners made up the majority of officers in the Revolutionary War, the <br/>
War of 1812, and the War Between the States---because they had horses and <br/>
money and could fund the war effort. They also brought many of their servants <br/>
(not slaves) and farmworkers as aids and enlisted personnel because of trust and <br/>
duty. Kind of &#39;feudal&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think Southerners have always felt a bit more of a sense of duty to country <br/>
because so many of the &#39;big&#39; original settlers still held an allegiance to <br/>
the king---they were here not to escape tyranny, but to get MORE!&lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good analysis.  Makes sense.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right about the last resort take on the military in some <br/>
places.  A family was interviewed on the news the other night.  The dad was in the <br/>
military years ago (not a lifer), and one son just got back from Iraq, and <br/>
another&#39;s about to leave.  He was expressing pride in them.  It didn&#39;t sound <br/>
smart to me, or honorable.  I didn&#39;t call him or say so or anything. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One unschooled friend of ours really REALLY wants to join the marines.  His <br/>
dad was a marine and he wants to be too, but he&#39;ll  need to get 15 college <br/>
credits.  He&#39;s working on it, but some of us (in our dishonorable state) are <br/>
secretly cheering for life to distract him and give him another idea.   But that&#39;s <br/>
probably cruel, in a way, because if he wants it he wants it.  And he could do <br/>
well, and live there for 20 years.  Or he could die doing what he freely <br/>
chose to do and worked hard to obtain.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Southerners are also more comfortable with the chain of command and <br/>
deference to authority. BUT, because of the legacy of rank (granted by the king), I <br/>
think Southerners don&#39;thin the south, I think the heirarchy is still pretty <br/>
clear, and there are lessers all around, who might be addressed as &quot;sir&quot; but <br/>
it&#39;s a courtesy, and a condecension and a deigning, not an equal exchange of <br/>
&quot;sirs.&quot;    And when little kids are called &quot;sir&quot; that&#39;s just cute.   It scares me, <br/>
but I&#39;m so far away that my fear is not a factor. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is truly considered *honorable* to serve in the military here, as <br/>
opposed to in other regions of the country where it is often seen as a last <br/>
resort.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My dad had one honorable enlistment (WWII, war ended while he was on a troop <br/>
ship in the middle of the Atlantic, so he served in the occupation for a <br/>
couple of years) and one last resort enlistment (re-upped after he married my mom <br/>
and couldn&#39;t find a job he liked; he was a sergeant teaching people to drive <br/>
trucks, and repairing stuff, in Camp Chaffee, Arkansas).<br/>
<br/>
The class system out here was, in my parents&#39; childhoods and somewhat still, <br/>
landowners and hired hands.  Ranchers rank.  Farmers, iffier.  Sharecroppers <br/>
are luckier than itinerate workers, which is what my mom&#39;s family did--pick <br/>
cotton.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s dad (a Yankee, from Massachusetts) joined the navy in the late 30&#39;s <br/>
and was training pilots in Pensacola when Pearl Harbor was bombed.  Keith <br/>
thinks he joined because of the depression.  Last resort?  But he was cooler than <br/>
my dad, because he was college material and was a Captain.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling, but for those connecting dots, who knows what ramble might be a <br/>
missing bit to their evolving model?<br/>
