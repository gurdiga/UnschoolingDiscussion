<div id="ygrps-yiv-944493971">Hi all,<br/>
I thought I&#39;d add some NASA links to the pot.  My interest in space and<br/>
NASA led me to an interesting thing.  I volunteer to help the experts at<br/>
NASA answer email (the technical name is Smart Filter, still waiting for<br/>
the Smart part to kick in!).  I answer questions (or steer the kids in<br/>
the right direction) that are easily researchable through NASA sites and<br/>
other web sites.  If I can&#39;t find the answer I send it on to an expert. <br/>
I&#39;ve learned so much through this project!<br/>
<br/>
I am always amazed at the educational resources NASA has on the<br/>
internet.  I have a ton of them but I&#39;m only including a few.  The first<br/>
one isn&#39;t NASA but it&#39;s a great place to look at, and find just about<br/>
anything you want to know about the planets.  If you have any trouble<br/>
with the links, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I have participated in chats with NASA experts along with<br/>
watched live web casts with more experts.  You can also prepare for the<br/>
chats by reading the experts biography online and visiting any web sites<br/>
that pertain to their work.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in more NASA/Space links email me at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:stojoy@...">stojoy@...</a>, that&#39;s where all my links are and it would be a lot more<br/>
simple for me to copy and paste them there...okay, so I&#39;m lazy!  :-)<br/>
