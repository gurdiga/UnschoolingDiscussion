<div id="ygrps-yiv-146932930">On Sundays we have dinner with my dad, step mom, brother and my brothers girlfriend.<br/>
<br/>
Jaiden(5.5) always gets dressed up(he has a crush on my bro&#39;s g-friend) Last week he chose blue camo shorts and a orange, gray and black striped tribal shirt. And he spent a few miniutes spiking his hair. <br/>
<br/>
My stepmom made a snarky comment to him about his clothes and how maybe I should pick them for him. He looked at her and very sweetly told her that he was almost 6 and was prefectly capeable of picking out his own clothes and that if she couldn&#39;t say anything nice to him about his clothes than she didn&#39;t need to say anything at all. (the say something nice or nothing at all is a point she&#39;s been trying to make with him)<br/>
<br/>
She wasn&#39;t as amused as Jason and I were. :)<br/>
<br/>
Avery(3 next month) has been known to wear a button down shirt to dinner at grandparents house, but it&#39;s frequently all he has on. He hates to wear clothes and will strip down as soon as he can.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;At our Friday family dinner he wears a<br/>
button-down short sleeved shirt (he prefers those to tees), because he knows<br/>
it pleases his Dad and all the grandparents.&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
