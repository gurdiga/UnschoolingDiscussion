&lt;&lt; Does that mean we shouldn&#39;t *try*???  Does that mean we shouldn&#39;t just <br/>
help even one person?  What about the handful of children that *do* have <br/>
better lives because someone did something? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do that every single day of my life.<br/>
I help people unschool.<br/>
I help them realize where their negativity is harming their relationship with <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
So have you been doing, lately!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Surely there has to be a balance, even as imperfect as our results might <br/>
be.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Balance?  Probably  my husband thinks not.  <br/>
<br/>
Every single day.  The only days I miss are when I&#39;m at a conference doing it <br/>
in person, or when we&#39;re on a family outing and I&#39;m away from the computer.<br/>
<br/>
I pay for my website so it won&#39;t have ads, and so it will be easy to <br/>
remember, so people can get to it easily and without irritation.    I just <br/>
got this note from someone I helped by e-mail today:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Thank you for your speedy and incredibly helpful response!<br/>
You can&#39;t believe how much your message has helped me and at a time I need<br/>
it most.  Thank you for the insights and websites.  I look forward to<br/>
delving into them.  I will try to attend the conference as well.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the HSC conference, where I won&#39;t be, but the mom is in northern <br/>
California.<br/>
<br/>
I AM helping with peace in families.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not doing it by stirring up a cloud of negativity, though.  They&#39;re <br/>
moving already from negativity toward peace.  It&#39;s just a little assist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041312170">I agree Sandra.  I&#39;m glad you clarified that though, because it almost sounded different than what you intended, and I couldn&#39;t believe that was really what you meant.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m doing my darndest to be a positive influence here.  Its not always easy though, is it!<br/>

There are calms and storms, and we can no more prevent them than we can <br/>
prevent rain or snow.<br/>
