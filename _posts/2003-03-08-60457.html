<div id="ygrps-yiv-196361854">Hello,<br/>
  My daughter is a frdhamn at a public high school,and she is very <br/>
unsatisfied with her daily life there. She recently discovered the <br/>
unschooling theory and has been begging us to let her out. My husband <br/>
and I both have doubts about whether this is the right solution. I&#39;d <br/>
really appreciate any advice from parents of unschooling teenagers. <br/>
How has it affected their social life, what are the pros and cons, <br/>
how do you measure their mastery, etc. etc. Any stories or words of <br/>
wisdom you can supply would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
                     Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right solution for what?<br/>
<br/>
I know that sounds like a dumb question, but we send kids to school as<br/>
though school were some magical process that turns nothing into &quot;success&quot;.<br/>
And we do it automatically, without question. &quot;It&#39;s just what you *do*<br/>
because horrible things will happen if you don&#39;t!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How is she less than a perfect her right now? What problem are you trying to<br/>
solve? What is it she&#39;s lacking that you want to change in her?<br/>

You are actually at a *very* healthy place compared to many parents of<br/>
teens. You&#39;ve listened to her and taken her needs seriously. (So maybe you<br/>
don&#39;t even need the second book! :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How did you measure her mastery as a toddler learning English and walking<br/>
and feeding herself?<br/>
<br/>
The problem with school is that they teach skills and knowledge as though<br/>
the skills and knowledge were the goal. But they&#39;re not goals. They&#39;re tools<br/>
like a hammer. Teaching hammering as a skill separate from building things<br/>
would be pointless. Especially in an atmosphere where kids aren&#39;t allowed to<br/>
build.<br/>
<br/>
Think of how your daughter learned English. Did she learn English becaue<br/>
English was important? Or did she learn English as a side-effect of using it<br/>
as a tool to get what she wanted?<br/>
<br/>
*For KIDS* unschooling is as easy as learning English. :-) They pursue what<br/>
interests them naturally and, just as adults do, they learn what they need<br/>
to know to pursue their interests as they go along.<br/>
<br/>
For parents, though, &quot;getting it&quot; takes a lot of mental cleaning out.<br/>
There&#39;s so much we&#39;ve just accepted without question about how children need<br/>
to learn that it takes hours of reading and thinking to weed out the<br/>
falacies.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well said, Joyce!!  (As usual.)  In fact, your entire response was <br/>
excellent.  Would it be okay if I shared that with a friend of mine?  I was <br/>
attempting to explain unschooling to her, but I think your post is much <br/>
clearer and succinct than I can ever be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad I &quot;know&quot; you (as in, met you one time at a conference and <br/>
get to read some of the stuff that you write).<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My husband and I both have doubts about whether this is the right <br/>
&gt;&gt;solution.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The right solution for what? What is *your daughter* hoping to get out of <br/>
unschooling? What has made unschooling look like the best choice for *her*? <br/>
Sounds like she&#39;s been doing her research and made a decision based on what <br/>
she&#39;s learned. Do you trust her to make good decisions?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;d really appreciate any advice from parents of unschooling teenagers. <br/>
&gt;&gt;How has it affected their social life&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, my son&#39;s not trapped all day is a stressful situation learning all <br/>
sorts of negative coping behaviors. Therefore, he&#39;s able to socialize and <br/>
hold conversations with people of all ages. He doesn&#39;t worry about cliques <br/>
or fitting in. He&#39;s very proud of being Who He Is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;what are the pros and cons,how do you measure their mastery, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think in terms of mastering school subjects. I think in terms of my <br/>
kids creating their own internal model of the universe. They add to that <br/>
model each and everyday and are never behind themselves in their learning. <br/>
They have no fear of learning anthing that interests them. They pursue <br/>
knowledge for the sake of learning something they want/need to know. They <br/>
never approach learning as something to be forgotten after the test.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Any stories or words of wisdom you can supply would be greatly <br/>
&gt;&gt;appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Read here, at unschooling.com and sandradodd.com. Lots of us have shared <br/>
stories in all of these forums. Read with an open heart. Be open to what <br/>
your daughter is trying to tell you about her school experience. She&#39;s aking <br/>
to come home for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
