<br/>
This is interesting.  It&#39;s long, but here&#39;s a part out of the middle  <br/>
of it:<br/>
==============================================================<br/>
Whenever our low-tide times come around, I laugh at myself for  <br/>
forgetting how true are the words I wrote above: I find that the  <br/>
children catch more fish, so to speak, when the tide is out.<br/>
<br/>
A week or two ago, reveling in the richness of low tide, I got in the  <br/>
mood to read some Sandra Dodd. Sandra&#39;s website is one of the best  <br/>
educational resources on the &#39;net. She has been collecting wisdom  <br/>
from experienced unschoolers (including herself) for over ten years,  <br/>
and her site is a vast (really, I&#39;m not using the word carelessly� <br/>
there must be a hundred? pages there, at least) repository of quotes  <br/>
and anecdotes to inspire and edify anyone who is interested in how  <br/>
people learn. Be careful; you&#39;ll lose yourself there for hours.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;ll find yourself, too. Sandra always makes me think. She can  <br/>
be challenging, in the sense of &#39;one who challenges you to examine  <br/>
your assumptions.&#39; I&#39;ve lurked on her email lists on and off over the  <br/>
years (and not always lurking; I used to participate in the  <br/>
discussion, two or three younguns ago), and I sometimes found her  <br/>
almost painfully blunt. But now, ten years into my own home education  <br/>
journey, I think I understand why she doesn&#39;t mince words in  <br/>
conversation with other homeschooling/ unschooling parents. She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want them to lose precious time to friction and tension. She  <br/>
wants there to be joy and delightful connectedness between parents  <br/>
and children, always and as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t necessarily agree with her on every topic, but I appreciate  <br/>
the way she gets me questioning, pushing, pondering, learning. I like  <br/>
her emphasis on saying yes as often as possible. That one simple idea  <br/>
can effect HUGE changes in your relationship with your kids.  <br/>
Sometimes I get so busy, so caught up in the logistics of managing  <br/>
this busy household, that I drift into scolding mode. Ugh. Sandra&#39;s  <br/>
work reminds me not to scold, but rather to listen, and to smile, and  <br/>
instead of barking out a kneejerk &quot;No&quot; to the child who proposes  <br/>
something, to ask myself &quot;Why not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
====================================<br/>
<br/>
Now I need to go and count my webpages.  I thought last week maybe I  <br/>
should, and I don&#39;t know why I thought it.  But in that blog entry,  <br/>
Melissa guessed that i might have a hundred pages.  I&#39;m guessing over  <br/>
300, but I&#39;m going to count, out of burning curiosity, now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last week she talked about my connections page, and I linked her two  <br/>
pages from the bottom of that:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/connections">http://sandradodd.com/connections</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ALSO THERE, I&#39;m not sure if I announced to this list or not, is a  <br/>
link I got from Jocelyn Vilter of a page with links to all of the  <br/>
James Burke shows (Connections, The Day the Universe Changed) on  <br/>
YouTube.  VERY very (very) cool!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425454703">-=-Now I need to go and count my webpages.  I thought last week maybe I<br/>
should, and I don&#39;t know why I thought it.  But in that blog entry,<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
548, maybe as many as 556 (there were eight I&#39;d have to open to see  <br/>
whether they&#39;re unschooling-related or not, but I&#39;ll look later).<br/>
<br/>
I had hoped and thought that maybe when I got to 365 I could make  <br/>
some kind of annual rotation or something, but it&#39;s past that now.<br/>
<br/>
Some pages are short, and would really only be one page printed out,  <br/>
but some of those webpages are six or ten print-out pages long.  It&#39;s  <br/>
like an encyclopedia of unschooling.  Cool.<br/>
<br/>
The way I counted was to go to the file manager and print out the  <br/>
names of folders and files.  I opened each unschooling folder (such  <br/>
as reading, math, typical days) and counted how many files were in  <br/>
there (sometimes it was only three, sometimes 15, and I wrote those  <br/>
numbers next to the folders).<br/>
<br/>
I went through the list and crossed out anything that was personal,  <br/>
biographical/family, kid-pages, Holly&#39;s haircuts, SCA pages.  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t count any of those.  I didn&#39;t count the tumbleweed page or the  <br/>
pages of flowers in my yard.  I didn&#39;t count Dumbledore or David  <br/>
Bowie or the hot tub.<br/>
<br/>
What was left I tallied up, and was surprised when it passed 400, and  <br/>
almost embarrassed by my bad estimate when it passed 500.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to remember that number, for one thing, but it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
matter because I keep adding pages.  Kelly just sent me a typical day  <br/>
entry today (not one she wrote, but one posted to Unschooling Basics)  <br/>
and I have folders on my desktop of things I&#39;ve saved to put on  <br/>
pages.  Some will just be added to existing pages, but others will  <br/>
earn their own pages.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired of counting now and am going to go read People magazines  <br/>
and then fall asleep.  Early in the morning I take Holly to the  <br/>
airport so she can go to Rhode Island for nearly two weeks, and it&#39;s  <br/>
a scary mom-thing to do that.   She&#39;s going to visit Chris Trainor&#39;s  <br/>
family and she&#39;s really excited about it.<br/>

It started with DDR.  The newest version has a David Bowie song on it.  <br/>
A few days ago we were talking about people with different colored <br/>
eyes, after watching the new Nancy Drew movie, and David Bowie&#39;s name <br/>
came up.  Then the next day, I stumbled across Sandra&#39;s David Bowie <br/>
page, and then the same thing, about which movies he was in and all <br/>
that, and back to DDR.<br/>
<br/>
Other things were shared and it spun into other conversations, but my <br/>
kids both know a little about David Bowie now.</div>

Just this week :) Hayden and I reminisced about the rats at Sandra&#39;s house;<br/>
Sandra reminds us of her David Bowie letter; and a friend comments she had<br/>
rats, her favorite named Bowie!!  H is a big fan, especially since *Changes*<br/>
was in Shrek 2 :)<br/>

I have favorite analog clock times, too, but they&#39;re very different.   <br/>
I think 7:00 and 4:00 are both really attractive--graceful angles.   <br/>
3:00 is EXCITING on an analog clock for me, because most of my school  <br/>
years that was the &quot;Go home!&quot; time, but some years it was 3:10, so I  <br/>
get a little quick intake of breath when I see 3:10 (even a.m.) too.   <br/>
Pavlov was So RIGHT about conditioning like that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On analog clocks I don&#39;t like 12:00 or any of the other moments when  <br/>
the hands are in the same place.  It seems teetery and disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading &quot;Your Brain on Music&quot; (it will take me a long time,  <br/>
because it&#39;s not easy reading and I don&#39;t read like I used to), and  <br/>
I&#39;m thinking there are similar phenomena with other senses, so the  <br/>
visual clock joys and sorrows are probably among those things.  What  <br/>
patterns or angles are pleasing and which are uncomfortable?   <br/>
Sometimes it has to do with associations from the past, and sometimes  <br/>
it&#39;s something else altogether.<br/>

never notice stuff like this.  My dh and his mom both love to see the <br/>
odometer on the car turn over to numbers with lots of zeros; she, in <br/>
fact, will get upset if she misses it.  I never even thought about it <br/>
before I met them.  When homeschoolers online talked about Pi Day, I <br/>
had no idea what they meant, though I did know what pi was; I&#39;d just <br/>
never noticed before.  The minute my son was born, m-i-l noted that his <br/>
birth date was the same as his sister&#39;s (27, though in different <br/>
months), and it was she who remarked on Laura&#39;s numerically rhythmic <br/>
birth date when she was born (7-27-87).<br/>

WAIT!<br/>
Are you saying I&#39;m a &quot;mathie&quot;!?<br/>
Or that Non-Mathies like to see odometers roll to zeros (which I DO  <br/>
like, and it works on Neopets too, on which I&#39;m up past 6,000,000  <br/>
neopoints and look forward to it rolling over to 7,000,000...)<br/>

book for the first time, and I imagine I will miss much of it on the first <br/>
run through. I&#39;ll have to snag the disks when Simon has finished them so <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Over the years I have discussed favorite digital clock times with many<br/>
people because I will often mention when mine rolls around. It is<br/>
definitely one of those things that people either seem to appreciate<br/>
and understand (the ones who have their own favorite times) or find so<br/>
strange and have never given it a moments thought.<br/>
 <br/>
Mine has always been 7:21 - it is just so peaceful and satisfying. <br/>
And  it is during those beautiful times when I am least resistant in<br/>
my life that I seem to consistently look at the clock at precisely  7:21 <br/>
It is a little notice that I get reminding me that when I&#39;m tuned in -<br/>
paying attention flows effortlessly.<br/>

&gt; seemed like every night I would look at the clock and see 11:11.  I<br/>
&gt; worried for a while that it might be some sort of premonitory thing,<br/>
&gt; like something bad would happen to me at that time :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I find myself noticing something over and over - either a number<br/>
or a song lyric or whatever it may be - I sometimes wonder if there&#39;s<br/>
a message in there for me to understand. Either I&#39;m sharply aware of<br/>
the number and hyper alert to seeing it everywhere or I&#39;m just<br/>
continously noticing it coincidentally - either way, it gets me<br/>
curious.<br/>
<br/>
For about 5 months I saw the Blue Morpho butterfly *everywhere* -<br/>
usually about 8 or 9 times a week, in the most unexpected places. I<br/>
finally had to look up what it&#39;s suppose to represent in one of those<br/>
animal/totem guide books and was really surprised at how meaningful<br/>
the information was to my life.<br/>
<br/>
Now whether it was a subconscious thing for me to notice it because I<br/>
realized somehow that it represented an important aspect of my life,<br/>
or whether mother nature was truly trying to get my attention, I don&#39;t<br/>
know. But I am very fond of Blue Morphos now.  :)<br/>

A digital clock doesn&#39;t do it for me, only analog (on the school- <br/>
salivation responses, as it were).<br/>
<br/>
And 11:11 is beautiful on a digital clock, all symmetrical in every  <br/>
direction, but it&#39;s nothing pretty on an analog clock.  It&#39;s just  <br/>
something I find visually attractive, or conceptually attractive.<br/>
<br/>
Last week I walked into our bedroom while our big-numbers (to read in  <br/>
the dark without glasses) clock said 5:55 and I said &quot;good thing for  <br/>
some of the Christians clocks don&#39;t go to 6:66.&quot;<br/>

He knew exactly why I said it and what I meant, and that&#39;s why I love  <br/>
him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

us his tapes of 1 and Goblet of Fire, the last book he read.  I <br/>
listened to Goblet once, but it drove me nuts -- the narrator (must be <br/>
Jim Dale, &#39;cause I know it&#39;s not Stephen Fry) pronounces Voldemort <br/>
&quot;Volde-more.&quot;  Like Stephen Colbert, I guess ;-)  I&#39;d love to hear <br/>
Stephen Fry&#39;s version.  One of my favorite books on tape is John Cleese <br/>
reading C.S. Lewis&#39;s The Screwtape Letters.<br/>

My kids have always thought it cool that their septuagenarian Grandpa <br/>
was the one who introduced us to Harry Potter; he even went to a <br/>
midnight party for Azkaban.  The kids were young enough then that we <br/>
read the first three aloud; we&#39;ve since reserved two copies each time a <br/>
new book is released.<br/>

to Stephen Fry than I do to Jim Dale, so I think I prefer him as well.<br/>
<br/>
I love listening to the disks, and we have most of the books on cd now, I <br/>
think, one on tape, because Simon prefers to hear them when he wants to and <br/>
not when I can read to him. Stephen Fry and Jim Dale can read a lot more in <br/>
a go than I can. And they do voices consistently, neither Simon nor Linnaea <br/>
like it when I do voices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478964705">-=-How about reading it aloud together and each person take a page or 2<br/>
or even by chapter and each person read that so everyone get to know<br/>
what happens at the same time and everyone gets the time they need<br/>
for reading aloud and spending time together as a family.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Long ago, my sister and her very new husband, when neither of us had  <br/>
any children read The Lord of the Rings aloud to one another, often  <br/>
by firelight, one winter.  A couple of times I went there and took my  <br/>
turns listening and reading.    Very memorable.   I had already read  <br/>
it so I didn&#39;t mind that I wasn&#39;t always there, and sometimes one of  <br/>
us would be doing dishes or making food or splitting kindling while  <br/>
another read.<br/>
