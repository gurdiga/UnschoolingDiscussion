&lt;&lt; This time I told her I am not going to engage in it anymore. So of course <br/>
she <br/>
let her room get totally trashed. I started getting impatient waiting for her <br/>
to take responsibility. I told her to keep the door shut, and she is so <br/>
forgetful, she doesn&#39;t.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The more you used to enforce it, the longer and farther the pendulum will <br/>
have to swing.  She will show you the negative image of the positive image <br/>
you used to enforce on her first.  So maybe, kind of in penance and as a <br/>
learning opportunity, just see that clearly and breathe through it.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s room used to be a mess, but now she&#39;s 11, changed rooms, and that <br/>
room has not gotten messed up at all since she moved in six or seven months <br/>
ago.   Kirby&#39;s was cleaned thoroughly a month and some ago and is in better <br/>
shape now than when it was first cleaned!   Marty&#39;s is usually the neatest.  <br/>
At the moment it&#39;s pretty messy (for Marty), and so I expect that one day in <br/>
a week or two he&#39;ll hole up in there and listen to music and clean, clean, <br/>
clean.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I bitched her out and demanded she clean it. Over a book and towels <br/>
that really shouldn&#39;t matter. UGH! -=-<br/>
<br/>
Destruction of property&#39;s not cool.  I wouldn&#39;t want a book ruined.<br/>
<br/>
But you could have gone in and picked up towels or other public stuff instead <br/>
of (kind of) entrapping her in destruction of property.  (Or em-mildewing <br/>
&lt;g&gt;.  Contributing to the em-mildewization of property.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe I should offer to help? A lot of times in the past she would just <br/>
cry <br/>
and say she can&#39;t, and she needed help. She is used to me saying no. And I <br/>
have helped before, but then i take over and organize things to my liking, <br/>
and she doesn&#39;t want that either. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could help in spurts and bits.  Neither the &quot;If I help it will be <br/>
done my way&quot; nor &quot;It&#39;s your room, I&#39;m touching nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I will go in and get Kirby&#39;s laundry sometimes if I&#39;m in a laundry mood and <br/>
his isn&#39;t down the hole (there&#39;s a laundry chute from the bathroom in the <br/>
hall, and laundry goes &quot;down the hole,&quot; ideally).   If I&#39;m in there anyway <br/>
(to watch 24, or to hear a new song, or some other invitational social <br/>
reason) I&#39;ll take dirty dishes back out with me if there are any when I leave.<br/>
<br/>
I do the same for my husband and the other kids.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Middle ground, oh middle ground, where are you middle ground?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t want to be dependant on the opinions of unschoolers for every <br/>
parenting concern, but some insight would be appreciated, until I can start <br/>
doing things that work like I was born with the knowledge, without  second <br/>
guessing and re-living past mistakes. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Ang, I would apologize to her.  Somewhere besides in or around her room.  <br/>
Outside the house, for a soda or a walk or at the grocery store, strolling <br/>
down an aisle where you don&#39;t really need anything.   Tell her what you told <br/>
us, about wishing her dad hadn&#39;t said &quot;spank,&quot; and other stuff.  I would ask <br/>
her what would help.  Maybe she would like to have a five minute assist every <br/>
day or two.  Maybe not.  <br/>
<br/>
I think middle ground and getting over asking for help (which you don&#39;t have <br/>
to do; I still say &quot;help&quot; when I&#39;m fritzed about something with a kid, not <br/>
always on this list, but there are places I do)....<br/>
<br/>
Starting that sentence over.<br/>
<br/>
I think middle ground comes from philosophy and priorities.  If you can get <br/>
clear on what your goals and intentions are, THAT is where you go to check <br/>
what you should do.  If you have priorities in your head, and if peace is <br/>
more important than neatness, then when that second comes when you&#39;re <br/>
deciding whether to yell or walk away, you think &quot;peace or neatness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to clean up a room that&#39;s been messy for a year than to clean up <br/>
a relationship that&#39;s been getting moldy for even a week.<br/>
