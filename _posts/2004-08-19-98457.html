<div id="ygrps-yiv-367628783">Yesterday&#39;s (Wednesday 18 August) Newton (MA) Tab has<br/>
a<br/>
nice article on homeschoolers; it starts on the front<br/>
page and continues onto two more pages.  Concise and<br/>
respectful, with some debunking of myths.  They even<br/>
used the word unschooling once, although it was not<br/>
defined or elaborated upon.  Nice to see it entering<br/>
the consciousness a bit.<br/>
