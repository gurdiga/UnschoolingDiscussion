I guess I will have to. But it seems so senseless. <br/>

I&#39;m so sorry you feel that way--I truly have no experience to offer.  <br/>
I was born here, and have never spent any significant amount of time <br/>
in cold/snow.  Know that my thoughts are with you, and I&#39;ll be <br/>
sending you solar (soul-ar?) energy.<br/>
