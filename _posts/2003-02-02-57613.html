-=-I can&#39;t just let it go because there seems to be no natural consequence <br/>
for hitting. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told kids from time to time when it was fast and severe that if they do <br/>
NOT learn to control their tempers they could end up in prison or dead.  <br/>
Because just in brief, the natural consequences of being a violent adult are <br/>
often retaliatory violence or conviction of a crime.<br/>
<br/>
For little kids at home, I separate them.  A trick I learned as a Jr. High <br/>
teacher has served well.  To break up a fight, grab the loser and remove him. <br/>
 He WANTS to be saved.  If you grab the winning participant, you  might get <br/>
hurt.  If you remove the underdog, they both save face.  He can think he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have necessarily lost.  The winner still thinks he won.<br/>
<br/>
I talk to the apparent victim first.  Sometimes it turns out he wasn&#39;t such a <br/>
victim.  But In our case at home, with my boys, that has usually been Marty, <br/>
who&#39;s younger by two and a half years.  At the moment they&#39;re 16 and 14 and <br/>
physical problems might be over.  Kirby&#39;s learned enough karate that he&#39;s <br/>
developed the self control that ideally comes with being able to seriously <br/>
hurt someone.  And they&#39;re both verbal, so physical isn&#39;t their first <br/>
thought.  So what I&#39;m going to tell is a summary of various things over the <br/>
years when they were younger, in various stages.  <br/>
<br/>
What has worked best is taking the one away and letting him tell me what <br/>
happened.  While he&#39;s calming down and stating his case, I&#39;m asking him what <br/>
he did to try to make things better.  &quot;Did you think of doing this?&quot;  &quot;No,&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Yes, but it didn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So partly it&#39;s a session in possibilities.   Then that kid&#39;s calmer.  But I <br/>
remind them that I&#39;m responsible for seeing that BOTH of them are safe in <br/>
their own homes, and happy.<br/>
<br/>
Then I go to the other kid (usually Kirby) who&#39;s calm by then too, and ask <br/>
for his side.  He tells me the whole thing, and I ask him at the end (since <br/>
I&#39;m wanting his whole story to compare to the other whole version) whether he <br/>
doesn&#39;t think he could have prevented it by this or that.<br/>
<br/>
Then I say &quot;Marty says you said/did this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately in many of the scenarios, Marty had sneaked up close enough to <br/>
hear and jumped in with &quot;I DID NOT!&quot; so I have to go and deposit Marty <br/>
elsewhere and say later &quot;That really didn&#39;t help me convince him, y&#39;know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So Kirby tells me his version of the evils Marty contributed to the argument. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I remind Kirby he&#39;s older and has a responsibility to show some maturity and <br/>
set an example (as appropriate, if appropriate).  And I tell him yada yada, <br/>
Marty needs to be safe in his own home, and not feel like his life is ruined <br/>
because he has an older brother who&#39;s bullying him (if appropriate...)<br/>
<br/>
Finally I&#39;d go back to Marty and say &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me this part?&quot;   or <br/>
&quot;Kirby says you threw this/said this...&quot;  And I go through it again with <br/>
Marty.  <br/>
<br/>
I know lots of people say to let kids work out their own stuff but I think <br/>
it&#39;s lazy at best and sadistic at worst.  My parents raised two cousins of <br/>
mine and one was mean and violent and frustrated and hurt both me and my <br/>
sister.  There should have been more active supervision and peace making and <br/>
advisement.  <br/>
<br/>
I know some people believe each soul chose their family and they need to <br/>
learn to work out their own interactions.  I think it&#39;s random, personally.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think any one of my kids needs to be the material on which another <br/>
kid works out his karma unchecked anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So in the interest of helping them develop a set of alternative responses and <br/>
social skills, and keeping them safe, I let each tell his story in private <br/>
instead of in front of the other.  It cuts out arguments instead of turning a <br/>
little argument into a big one (Jerry Springer show style, in worst cases).  <br/>
And it lets each kid vent to me about his frustrations about the other one.  <br/>
They NEED to express that.  Better to me than to friends outside the family, <br/>
I think.  Because in this case they have a lot of mutual friends.  It&#39;s to <br/>
the benefit of lots of people for them to be sociably at peace.  And it lets <br/>
me commiserate with them about the flaws of the sibling and to tell them how <br/>
hard it is to be a parent and to love both kids but to see when one is being <br/>
hurt without me saying in front of one &quot;Yeah, I know it can be a drag&quot; in <br/>
front of the other one.<br/>
<br/>
That might not be clear.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;ll say to Marty &quot;Yeah, Kirby sucks, <br/>
doesn&#39;t he?&quot;  It&#39;s more like &quot;Marty, I really did want to have you.  I LOVE <br/>
you.  And things would be different if you were the oldest.  I&#39;m sorry it <br/>
frustrates you.  But I was an oldest and there are disadvantages to that <br/>
too.&quot;   It helps the relationship between me and each child for me to be able <br/>
to discuss the emotions and reactions in some depth with them.<br/>
<br/>
On verbal abuse, one thing that has worked here is to remind them that it&#39;s <br/>
their own reputation and self/soul that they&#39;re hurting when they&#39;re mean.  <br/>
If someone is cruel, it makes him a cruel person.  It might hurt the other <br/>
kid too, but it immediately hurts the one who was mean for meanness sake.  <br/>
And it disturbs the peace of the others around them.  If two kids are <br/>
fighting, the other kid isn&#39;t having peace either.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  I wish you could get back to San Diego and to the situation you <br/>
had before.  I hope things get better for you soon.  <br/>

<br/>
Thank you so much for posting this.  My own kids fight A LOT and I was also at a loss to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought to &quot;remove the apparent victim&quot; first.  I usually end up separating them, but then wasn&#39;t sure how to follow up.  I always felt like in order to be &quot;fair&quot; (and not knowing what really happened) I had to send them both to their rooms.   I&#39;ve had the talks like you describe, but was never sure what to do with the end result because the kids do lie to get each other in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
And I agree, showing empathy would probably help a lot, but thats an area I&#39;m really weak on because I had very little empathy shown to me, and even now I have very little empathy shown to me when I absolutely need it.<br/>
<br/>
My own needs drain me sometimes when I have no support and its not the kids&#39; fault, but sometimes I don&#39;t have anything left anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Kristen<br/>

That&#39;s when you give yourself a big hug and offer yourself empathy.  Try to<br/>
think of yourself as someone else who is in your position and think about<br/>
the empathy you would have for that *other* person.  That is the empathy you<br/>
yourself are due.  Sounds wacky, but it can help.<br/>
