Deschooling is a process.  You are still thinking in school mode.  In<br/>
school, in a classroom of 20 students, each step - of Math for example - has<br/>
to be learned in a specific order and everyone is expected to be on the same<br/>
step.  That&#39;s where trouble starts - you miss a step and it&#39;s bad news!<br/>
<br/>
Argh - A school memory just popped into my head - I was sitting in Algebra 2<br/>
Now, mind you,  I had spent Algebra 1 with my book propped up with a<br/>
Historical Romance inside it because it was so boring, and then had a year<br/>
of Geometry - so here I am in Algeba 2 and this teacher starts to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
I&#39;m TOTALLY lost.  I don&#39;t remember how I got through the year - maybe I<br/>
dropped the class :o) - I just remember that moment of terror!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to the point I wanted to make.  Kids out of a classroom can<br/>
discover bits and pieces on their own and then put it together in their own<br/>
way. My 7yo has figured out things that in school would be called<br/>
multiplication or division, but to him it&#39;s just things you can do with 4 or<br/>
6 or 10. And he seems to understand it in the abstract as well as with<br/>
objects.<br/>
<br/>
If your 10yo has &quot;Math Attitude&quot; she may need time to stand back and see why<br/>
math is important in her life - Real Math, I guess.  Or maybe if you have to<br/>
have math books try some of the fun ones like Math for Smarty Pants by<br/>
Marilyn Burns or try playing card games, etc and reminding yourself &quot;This is<br/>
math and EVERYTHING counts!&quot;  Or maybe a homebased business and savings<br/>
account - am I on a roll here or what!<br/>
<br/>
And remember, schools spend so much time on review and keeping the whole<br/>
class together that the material they cover in a year can be handled in much<br/>
less time one-on-one at home.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;Deschooling Our Lives&quot; edited by Matt Hern?  It&#39;s been<br/>
awhile, but I remember I enjoyed the book.<br/>
<br/>
We are hard core unschoolers here - we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Becky, this is so true. many of us are. we went thru the process and our<br/>
minds were taught to beluieve this and many of us stil think that way. i<br/>
know i am caught up in totally. we judge and loko at criteria accroding to<br/>
school, like that is the norm. That has only been the norm in very recent<br/>
history and many of us forget that.<br/>
<br/>
I constantly have to remind myself that I dont have to think in those<br/>
terms. I can look for other options and ideas that fit better with what i<br/>
want. more then that i have to keep reminding mysef that i think that cus<br/>
it was drilled into my head during years of indoctrination.<br/>

for me is: &quot;The Art of Education&quot; by Linda Dobson.  I highly recommend <br/>
reading this.<br/>
