<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700728990">Well, Cinderella 2 actually. We were watching it tonight on the Disney Channel. At one point, the ladies-in-waiting throw a metal hoop skirt over Cindy&#39;s head. Sarah asked if women actually wore them, and I said that yes, once upon a true time women who could afford to wore them, it was the fashion. She wanted to know more so we got out a book (Usborne&#39;s Living Long Ago) that discusses, among other things, clothing styles throughout history and I showed her.

childhood and teens immersed in fashion and costume. She has written about <br/>
how it took her daughter through many, many academic subjects just <br/>
following her interests. (The girl is now a straight A architecture student <br/>
in college.)<br/>

About hoop skirts . . . I used to usher at the San Francisco Opera in the <br/>
60&#39;s. One opening night, a woman showed up in the biggest hoop skirt you <br/>
can imagine. She couldn&#39;t get through the door from the lobby into the <br/>
actual theater and had to spend the whole evening in the lobby. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618762108">It really isn&#39;t that hard - put on a hoop and practice, LOL. You<br/>
basically tilt the back up an inch or two and while in the<br/>
process of sitting down.  Also scoot forward a little to fold<br/>
the hoops down.  I am not a fan of stick shifts, port-a-potties<br/>
and open campfires while wearing hoops,  but even those are<br/>
manageable.   I have never seen the full &quot;fly up nekkid to the<br/>
waist (except for pantalettes and chemise)&quot; result of having<br/>
them tip up, but you can get some interesting effects if you<br/>
don&#39;t put enough petticoats over them or get a feel for where<br/>
they are flexible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-273816434">From my understanding, either they sat on stools they could drape the dress over, or there were little catches in the back hoops that allowed them to collapse. I&#39;m really not sure though. Would be interesting to find out! <br/>

When I moved into the house I bought in AOL&#39;s homeschooling chatroom (another <br/>
story for another time), the previous owners left a pink brocade upholstered <br/>
chair.  The seat was round, with a short back (6-8&quot;) that only went about 1/4 <br/>
way around the seat.  When my mom saw it, she said it was a hoopskirt chair.  <br/>
<br/>
I suppose someone wearing a hoopskirt could sit on it and still have the very <br/>
back of their behind have a little support.  I suppose the back is low so a <br/>
bow or bustle or jacket tail could hang over the back.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom liked it and it matched her decor so I had it cleaned and gave it to <br/>
her.  Now her cat sleeps on it.<br/>

Only mildly interesting.  I used to hang out in that chatroom (Homefront <br/>
Hall--it&#39;s still there) years after it lost its luster.  So one night I&#39;m chatting <br/>
late at night and a new person comes in and through the chatroom conversation <br/>
we find out we&#39;re in the same town.  And her house is for sale.  And they&#39;re <br/>
homeschoolers and so are we and we&#39;re looking for a house in that area.  So I <br/>
meet up with her at park day and talk to her about the house and I end up <br/>
buying it a few months later after she&#39;s lowered the price by $20k.  ;)  I still <br/>
own the house as a rental property.  Hope to move back into it someday, maybe.<br/>
