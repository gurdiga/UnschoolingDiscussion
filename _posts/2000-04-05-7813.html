<div><font size="2">I found this while looking for an article to share on the 
subject of why breastfeeding is normal, not superior, but it serves a good 
purpose, and I can safely say that the contents can be turned around to say that 
if someone tells you that they haven&#39;t breastfed, take the time to find out why 
before you get high and mighty about it. :-)</font></div>

  <div><font size="2">Just to clarify, I&#39;m not a LLL Leader yet :-)&nbsp; I need 
  to make this clear, as any counsellor-type will know, so that no-one thinks I 
  talk about breastfeeding on&nbsp;LLL&#39;s behalf, yet.&nbsp; But I too groaned 
  when I read this post, not only because of its inflamatorry nature, but 
  because this is exactly the kind of superiority complex which puts some people 
  off breastfeeding.&nbsp; Breastfeeding is natural.&nbsp; Breastmilk is what 
  babies&#39; sytems are designed to deal with.&nbsp; That does not mean that 
  bottlefeeding, &#39;with safety and love&#39; as Bill and Martha Sears&#39; Baby Book 
  says, cannot meet the needs of babies who cannot be breastfed.&nbsp; 
  </font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font size="2">I think Stephanie&#39;s husband would read this message and be 
  more put off.&nbsp; It would be more helpful for him to talk to other fathers 
  who support their partner&#39;s feeding choices.&nbsp; My dh said, when asked how 
  many times dd2 woke in the night, &#39;I don&#39;t know,&#39; I don&#39;t wake up.&#39;&nbsp; A 
  major benefit for the co-sleeping, breastfeeding father!!</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font size="2">Dogmatics and rants don&#39;t change people&#39;s minds, nor can 
  they change the fact that some people physically can&#39;t breastfeed.&nbsp; 
  There&#39;s enough aggro in the world without adding to it.</font></div>
