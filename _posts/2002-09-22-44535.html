&gt; parents who are involved in their childrens education and lives<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
  Actually, it&#39;s more likely that they think we have something to hide.  I <br/>
have a special needs child who went to Early Intervention for two years, <br/>
recieved therapies at a local rehabilitation facility, and is followed by <br/>
MH/MR.  So although I&#39;m trying to fly under the radar, they know we&#39;re out <br/>
there.<br/>
  I just read in an autism newsletter that someone in a town a few miles from <br/>
me had a child taken away for, among other things, locking her child in.  <br/>
ANYONE with the slightest knowledge of these kids know that many of them feel <br/>
compelled to run.  Just last year an online friend lost her 10 year old son <br/>
to drowning when he searched out the keys, unlocked the door and got out.  <br/>
(The point of this paragraph is to point out that you can say &quot;don&#39;t worry, <br/>
they can&#39;t take your kid away&quot; when the reality can be very different.  Even <br/>
when WE know what we&#39;re doing is in the child&#39;s best interests.)  <br/>
  Virginia, I&#39;m wishing for you the strength to see this through.<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
Mary J<br/>
PS   the woman whose child was taken fought it, and her child was returned<br/>
