&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is quite interesting and understandable<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here are some facts about the 1500s:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most people got married in June because they took their yearly<br/>
&gt; bath<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; May and still smelled pretty good by June.  However, they were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; starting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to smell so brides carried a bouquet of flowers to hide the body<br/>
&gt; &gt; odor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence the custom today of carrying a bouquet when getting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>married.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baths consisted of a big tub filled with hot water. The man of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; house<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had the privilege of the nice clean water, then all the other<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; men,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then the women and finally the children-last of all the babies.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the water was so dirty you could actually lose someone in it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houses had thatched roofs-thick straw-piled high, with no wood<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; underneath.  It was the only place for animals to get warm, so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dogs,cats and other small animals (mice, bugs) lived in the<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it rained it became slippery and sometimes the animals would<br/>
 </span></blockquote>slip<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fall off the roof.  Hence the saying &quot;It&#39;s raining cats and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dogs.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There was nothing to stop things from falling into the house.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; posed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>

&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>

&gt; canopy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; beds<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; came into existence.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The floor was dirt. Only the wealthy had something other than<br/>
&gt; dirt.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence the saying &quot;dirt poor.&quot; The wealthy had slate floors that<br/>
&gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slippery in the winter when wet, so they spread thresh (straw)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; floor to help keep their footing. As the winter wore on, they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>kept<br/>

&gt; start<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slipping outside. A piece of wood was placed in the entranceway.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence the saying a &quot;thresh hold.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In those old days, they cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always hung over the fire. Every day they lit the fire and added<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; things<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pot.  They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much meat.They<br/>
&gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eat the  stew for dinner, leaving leftovers in the pot to get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>cold<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; porridge hot, peas  porridge cold, peas porridge in the pot nine<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; old.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes they could obtain pork, which made them feel quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; special.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When visitors came over, they would hang up their bacon to show<br/>
&gt; off.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a sign of wealth that a man &quot;could bring home the bacon.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;They<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt<br/>

&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the loaf, the family got the middle, and guests got the top, or<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; England is old and small and the local folks started running out<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; places to bury people. So they would dig up coffins and would<br/>
 </span></blockquote>take<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bones to a &quot;bone-house&quot; and reuse the grave. When reopening<br/>

&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inside and they realized they had been burying people alive. So<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought they would tie a string on the wrist of the corpse, lead<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;graveyard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shift&quot;) to listen for the bell; thus, someone could be &quot;saved by<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bell&quot; or was considered a &quot;dead ringer.&quot;<br/>

Too bad it&#39;s not true, it&#39;s such an evocative picture.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My mother counts modern plumbing as the greatest advance of the last century. <br/>
She was 8 years old in 1946 when the R.E.A. brought electricity to her home, <br/>
but there wasn&#39;t a plumbed bathroom in her parent&#39;s home until the year she <br/>
married and left it. She grew up taking baths in the kitchen, all the kids on <br/>
Saturday night - big tin wash tub, hot water added between bathers but still <br/>
last one got the dregs. In her family the order was first the oldest boy, <br/>
then the littler kids, and lastly her, the oldest girl. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-587110624">1) thanks to whoever posted the website where this email is discussed.<br/>
<br/>
2) thanks to whoever posted it, because I&#39;m going to use it, probably <br/>
today, if the kids want to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
The first one that struck me as odd was the &quot;baby/bath water&quot; one. <br/>
Really? So dirty that you could lose a BABY in it? LOL<br/>
<br/>
&quot;raining cats and dogs&quot; It&#39;s pretty believable that mice and other <br/>
small mammals might house in a thatch roof...but dogs and cats??? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to have the kids read through this and tell me how any of <br/>
them could be known to be wrong, by just common sense and knowledge <br/>
of history. Could turn out to be a fascinating discussion.<br/>
