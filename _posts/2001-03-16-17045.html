<div>Decided to try my other account on here. Its gonna be a busy day for us 
with an apartment inspection at 10:30 by the rental agency and then I think we 
will head over to either walmart or books and borders. Since both are in 
opposite directions from each other..like across town, it&#39;ll be one or the other 
today. Have a good day, my friends.</div>
