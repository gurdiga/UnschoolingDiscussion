<div id="ygrps-yiv-276923054">I&#39;ve just finished reading &quot;How to Talk so Your Kids will Listen and <br/>
Listen So Your Kids Will Talk.&quot;  It was great.  One thing it did is <br/>
really bring up for me a question I&#39;ve been wrestling with since <br/>
Morgaine could talk, and I would love to hear how others approach <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
1) How do you deal with your kids&#39; questions?  I dislike answering <br/>
all her questions (and she asks lots of big ones!) because I often <br/>
feel I&#39;m taking her process from her. Whether little questions <br/>
like &quot;how do you spell ... &quot; to big questions like &quot;What if <br/>
everything in the world broke?&quot; I prefer to leave it to her to <br/>
wrestle with and be a sideline facilitator of conversation, IYKWIM.  <br/>
However, she often really wants me to answer ... either she wants to <br/>
spell the word correctly or wants to know what I think, and if I try <br/>
to be more evasive and shoot the q. back in her direction, she <br/>
sometimes gets angry, even when I tell her it&#39;s one of those <br/>
questions nobody has a definite answer to.  Those I&#39;ll answer <br/>
with &quot;Well I can tell you what I think/believe, but other people <br/>
have different ideas.&quot;  Anyway, I go back and forth between <br/>
answering because she asks and not answering because I feel I&#39;m <br/>
taking away part of her discovery process. <br/>
<br/>
2) Some questions, of course, require outside resources.  Our <br/>
question place is usually the car when I&#39;m driving ... example, <br/>
yesterday she was asking about claws on bunnies and cats, and that <br/>
led to the differences including retraction.  She wanted to know <br/>
why.  We discussed looking for a book in the library or writing to a <br/>
vet.  Like most of these questions that require outside resources, <br/>
she hasn&#39;t mentioned it again.  My thoughts are that at this age she <br/>
may just enjoy exploring the questioning process, and that knowing <br/>
outside resources exist may be enough.  I feel that if she really <br/>
wanted an answer, she&#39;d explore it more once we got home or to the <br/>
library, etc.  How do others do this?  Do you encourage your kids to <br/>
follow through or simply let them be and assume they&#39;ll ask to <br/>
follow through when they want to? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that it matters but Morgaine&#39;s still very little; 4.5 <br/>
yrs.  We&#39;re also getting into the same questions with Orion, who&#39;s <br/>
just turned 2. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that the age doesn&#39;t matter much! Mine are eight and 15----and <br/>
41 and 43 (my husband and I! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we NEED the answers and now! Sometimes the answers can wait until <br/>
we can get home and look it up or ask someone who knows. Sometimes we really <br/>
don&#39;t want the answers----just thinking out loud. Sometimes they don&#39;t want the <br/>
answers, but it sparks an interest in me, so *I* look it up.<br/>
<br/>
Varied answers to varied situations, maybe?<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; 1) How do you deal with your kids&#39; questions? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All my kids have always asked tons of questions. I still shudder when I<br/>
remember all the questions Tara asked at 2 about Santa Claus and the<br/>
elaborate stories I came up with to make him real. (Oh I&#39;ve learned since<br/>
then!)  My son now is testing my patience more than I thought possible.<br/>
Joseph asks questions about everything. He never stops. I guess when we are<br/>
watching something or I&#39;m in the middle of doing something, it can be a bit<br/>
of a side track. But I always answer, unless of course I know the answer is<br/>
coming up, like in a movie or tv show. Then I will just say watch and see if<br/>
you find out. If not, you can ask me and I&#39;ll stop the movie.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a question about spelling something or what kind of bug is this, I<br/>
answer as well as I can. If I don&#39;t know, we will look it up. I will ask him<br/>
if he wants to know more. If that satisfied him, it goes no further.<br/>
Sometimes the quick I know answer is all he&#39;s looking for. If he wants more<br/>
info, we either look for it or make a date to go elsewhere to find the<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s spelling a word, I just tell him. If it&#39;s something with numbers, I<br/>
just tell him.<br/>
<br/>
Look at it this way. If you were to ask your partner or friend a question,<br/>
would you want them to ask you one back, or just tell you?? Asking a<br/>
question when one is asked seems to me to frustrate the child more. I would<br/>
think maybe they will get to the point where they stop asking. I remember my<br/>
school teacher mom telling me to sound out words evertime I asked her how to<br/>
spell something. I stopped asking. It was too much of a chore when I just<br/>
wanted an answer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; 2) Some questions, of course, require outside resources.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If my children want more info from outside sources, they will tell me and we<br/>
will get those sources if all possible. When I answer a question, sometimes<br/>
after I will ask something of them to find out if that&#39;s the end of it or<br/>
they really want to know more. If it&#39;s a hypothetical question, I will ask<br/>
what they think too. It interests me and the discussion can get very<br/>
imformative for both of us. There are many times we kick around *what if*<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t tell them to go look something up when they want to know from me. I<br/>
will help them if that&#39;s what they want, or just answer. Or again, ask if<br/>
they want more info I don&#39;t have right now. My kids are 18, 9, 8 and 3 and I<br/>
do the same with all of them when they ask something. And my oldest is quite<br/>
capable of getting her own information. Most of the time she does, so when<br/>
she asks me about something, I know she wants the quick answer.<br/>
<br/>
Even the middle two are able to get books from the house or get on the<br/>
internet and look for information. So always giving what is asked hasn&#39;t<br/>
hurt their ability to find out on their own. Answering their quesitons I<br/>
feel keeps that interest there and the questions coming.<br/>
<br/>
4.5 seems awful young to expect her to start looking stuff up on her own<br/>
when she asks you for the answers. She will start getting her own info when<br/>
she&#39;s ready. Just breath deep and keep on talking!!!<br/>

<br/>
Hi --<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really know what you mean.  I do see that you think it&#39;s <br/>
important for her to arrange information in her brain in her own way, <br/>
and I agree with that, in theory, but I&#39;d like to understand better why <br/>
you go to the extent of not answering questions.  Can you explain your <br/>
beliefs more fully?  How did you derive them?<br/>
<br/>
I can understand that a long answer may sometimes turn off a child, but <br/>
I would still (as an unschooler) always provide at least a short <br/>
answer.  Sometimes I give an honest &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; but I usually suggest <br/>
an alternate way to find out.   (&quot;Try asking your dad.&quot;) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think learning-from-other-people is a legitimate learning style.  <br/>
Especially if the questions come from the learner.  I have friends who <br/>
in their learning styles are definitely &quot;social learners&quot;.   (There&#39;s a <br/>
lot of &quot;social learning&quot; going on here, although I suppose this is also <br/>
a great forum for &quot;visual learners&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;d just try to put myself in her shoes. What if you were a <br/>
visitor in a foreign land, and were unsure sometimes about the <br/>
language, the customs, and didn&#39;t know how things worked. You had a <br/>
trusted guide with you. If you asked the guide questions, anything <br/>
from &quot;How do you say &#39;Where&#39;s the bathroom&#39;?&quot; to &quot;How does the <br/>
transportation system work here?&quot;, you would probably like your guide <br/>
to answer them. If your guide redirected them back to you &quot;How do <br/>
*you* think the system works?&quot;, I would imagine it would be <br/>
frustrating for you. You say she often really wants you to answer. <br/>
I&#39;d let that  be your guide, and assume that if she&#39;s asking, she <br/>
wants an answer. Kids are a bit like exchange students in a new <br/>
culture, and they want to know how everything around them works. If <br/>
my kids ask me how to spell something, I assume they want to know it <br/>
and I give them the answer. Often they don&#39;t, and they just invent <br/>
the spelling themselves (leading to some wonderful things that I&#39;ve <br/>
saved for posterity - a sign on my son&#39;s door that read &quot;Konstwukchen <br/>
Goen On&quot;, for instance!) but if they ask, I will definitely give them <br/>
the answer! I think kid&#39;s have plenty of discovery process finding <br/>
out everything around them. If they want an answer to a specific <br/>
question, I&#39;d say supply it.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2)  How do others do this?  Do you encourage your kids to <br/>
&gt; follow through or simply let them be and assume they&#39;ll ask to <br/>
&gt; follow through when they want to? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither? I don&#39;t really &quot;encourage&quot; them to follow through, but if <br/>
we&#39;re at the library the next day, or at home in front of the <br/>
internet a few hours later, I&#39;ll ask them &quot;Do you want to look up <br/>
that info about XXXX?&quot; For instance, my son (7.5) had a bunch of <br/>
questions after someone we knew got called up for jury duty. The next <br/>
time we were at the library, I mentioned that we could find a book <br/>
about it, which he wanted to do. A week or so later, DH and I watched <br/>
The Runaway Jury, and I mentioned it to DS the next day that it might <br/>
be something he&#39;d like to watch all or part of, as it shows the jury <br/>
process from start to finish. If he wants to follow through (he did <br/>
in both cases), he just does. If not, he just says &quot;no&quot;, which is <br/>
fine too. Some questions are more burning than others, of course. <br/>
It&#39;s the same for my daughter (4.5) - sometimes we follow up on stuff <br/>
immediately, sometimes it&#39;s at a later time when we have more <br/>
information available, sometimes it just isn&#39;t important. It&#39;s really <br/>
not that much different than how I treat my friends. A friend of mine <br/>
is very interested in real estate investing right now. If I saw a <br/>
quote online, or a book, or a video, or something on that topic, I&#39;d <br/>
email it to her or be sure to mention it to her the next time I saw <br/>
her. That&#39;s just being friendly and remembering my friend&#39;s <br/>
interests. She would clip an article or tell me about a movie that <br/>
she saw that she thought I was interested in. Heck, my own mom still <br/>
sends me about 3 clipped articles a month :-)  I think the danger is <br/>
if you start investing any of the questions with particular <br/>
importance in your own mind (as in &quot;Oh, he&#39;s asking about Christopher <br/>
Columbus, better go check out 12 American History books&quot;) - just go <br/>
with the flow of the child&#39;s interests and they&#39;ll let you know when <br/>
they&#39;ve had too much info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028587328">I agree with this. My son asks a TON of questions daily, and he is a <br/>
very straight forward &quot;just the facts&quot; type. He will get very upset <br/>
if I am not clear and to the point in my answers. So, if it is a <br/>
question that has a definate short answer, I will just tell him. If <br/>
it is more of a difficult question, or I don&#39;t know the answer <br/>
myself, we go an look it up together.  The only time I answer him <br/>
with another question is when the question is more of an opinion, or <br/>
subjective, like &quot;is broccoli good?&quot;. Then I would ask him if he <br/>
thinks broccoli is good, and then tell him what I think. Last night <br/>
he had a philosophical thought while we were falling asleep (he is <br/>
pretty much four) and he asked me if we are real. I asked him if he <br/>
thought we are real.  He said &quot;yes, I am real, you are real, <br/>
everything I see is real, I can touch it, right now, here. <br/>
Goodnight.&quot; And then he rolled over and went to sleep. We always <br/>
have really interesting conversations while going to bed. :) - Tara<br/>

give her too much info about things.  I&#39;ve read a lot lately on not <br/>
giving kids too much information, and that too much info can hurt <br/>
them in different ways.  Morgaine loves information and asks big, <br/>
detailed questions, and often we end up in long, detailed <br/>
discussions.  Perhaps I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m taking some of the magic of <br/>
childhood wonder?  I&#39;m honestly not sure -- I just wonder if I <br/>
should encourage her to explore more.  I don&#39;t have a problem with <br/>
giving answers, but I wonder if I&#39;m too quick to answer.  Or to give <br/>
my own opinions (and I try to distinguish what I *know* from what I <br/>
*think* when I&#39;m talking with her.)  Probably just insecurities of <br/>
mothering stemming from doing a fair amount of reading just now ... <br/>
books recommended on various AP forums, books mentioned here, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for leading me to question my own motivations a bit more!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  (There&#39;s a <br/>
<br/>
lot of &quot;social learning&quot; going on here, although I suppose this is also <br/>
<br/>
a great forum for &quot;visual learners&quot;.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WAY too boring for visual learners.  This is just words, words, words with no <br/>
pictures!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think learning-from-other-people is a legitimate learning style.  <br/>
<br/>
Especially if the questions come from the learner. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think all learning happens inside of the learner.<br/>
But I think while someone is rolling an idea around, turning it this way and <br/>
that to see if they like and and where it might fit, talking to other people <br/>
who will discuss it with them is the best thing in the world!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do you deal with your kids&#39; questions?  I dislike answering<br/>
<br/>
all her questions (and she asks lots of big ones!) because I often<br/>
<br/>
feel I&#39;m taking her process from her. Whether little questions<br/>
<br/>
like &quot;how do you spell ... &quot; to big questions like &quot;What if<br/>
<br/>
everything in the world broke?&quot; I prefer to leave it to her to<br/>
<br/>
wrestle with and be a sideline facilitator of conversation, IYKWIM.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know what you&#39;re saying, but I&#39;m not sure you have thought it through <br/>
enough.  Yet here you are, asking a bunch of people for input, so you SAY it&#39;s what <br/>
you prefer but you must not be fully settled.<br/>
<br/>
And I think in this case it&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do you deal with your kids&#39; questions? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I answer them.<br/>
Often the answer is &quot;I don&#39;t know, what do you think?&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not sure, I&#39;ve <br/>
never thought about it,&quot; or &quot;Why are you asking; what happened?&quot;  When they <br/>
tell me more, I can tell them more.  <br/>
<br/>
But if it&#39;s something like &quot;How do you spell rhinoceros?&quot; I will do two <br/>
things.  I will spell it (or look it up if I need to) and say &quot;The &#39;rhino&#39; part <br/>
means &#39;nose,&#39; like in &#39;rhinoplasty&#39; which is the medical name for nose-job.&quot;    <br/>
That gives them a connection and will help them spell something else better <br/>
someday.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;because I often<br/>
<br/>
feel I&#39;m taking her process from her&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re taking her process from her if she has chosen to ask a human an<br/>
d the chosen human declines to cooperate.<br/>
<br/>
Her &quot;process&quot; was discussion!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Whether little questions<br/>
<br/>
like &quot;how do you spell ... &quot; to big questions like &quot;What if<br/>
<br/>
everything in the world broke?&quot; I prefer to leave it to her to<br/>
<br/>
wrestle with&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do you spell&quot; isn&#39;t always a little question.<br/>
Why should she have to wrestle with spelling?  One of the coolest tools <br/>
around is the little dictionary Microsoft Word has.  There&#39;s a book icon on the <br/>
menu and if you click it you can start typing a word and it starts guessing. You <br/>
can see all the other words that start the same way in a box to the left.  It <br/>
has definitions, and it&#39;s FAST.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t leave a child to wrestle with spelling nor with any other simple <br/>
matters of fact.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;What if everything in the world broke?&quot;    That&#39;s a great question, but it <br/>
requires more information.  Why should she wrestle with that alone?  <br/>
<br/>
Discuss things like this with our children is at the heart of unschooling.  <br/>
It builds your relationship with them, that you have shared ideas, and you know <br/>
the level of their imaginative and analytical thought.   <br/>
<br/>
To discuss &quot;what if everything in the world broke,&quot; first you have to begin <br/>
to define &quot;everything.&quot;   Electrical appliances?   Water systems?  (What if all <br/>
pipes and dams broke?)   Natural laws?  (Does gravity still work, in the <br/>
scenario she&#39;s describing?)  Human thought still works?   &quot;Everything the the <br/>
world&quot; is quite an idea all on its own.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I remember my<br/>
<br/>
school teacher mom telling me to sound out words evertime I asked her how to<br/>
<br/>
spell something. I stopped asking. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is SO important.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that lives here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/aradicalthought">http://sandradodd.com/aradicalthought</a><br/>
<br/>
What you can do with your dictionary and encyclopedia...<br/>
<br/>
Never tell a child &quot;Go look it up.&quot; Parents, teachers, friends and <br/>
countrymen, how would you like it? <br/>
<br/>
When a child wants to know why flowers have a scent, they want someone to say <br/>
&quot;To attract bees&quot; not &quot;GO LOOK IT UP.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Go look it up&quot; tends to mean &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;I know but I&#39;m not going to <br/>
tell you.&quot; What&#39;s the advantage of that?<br/>
<br/>
Either a child will opt NOT to look it up (and the trust in the parent will <br/>
erode a little) or he will, under duress, perform this task which might be <br/>
difficult for him, or might take so long that he doesn&#39;t care anymore (and the <br/>
trust in the parent will erode a little).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT saying to discourage kids from looking things up. I never said not to <br/>
show kids how to look things up. I mean don&#39;t treat it like something parents <br/>
won&#39;t do, parents don&#39;t have to do, but that kids do, or that kids have to <br/>
do, because they are powerless kids.<br/>
<br/>
Encyclopedias should be alluring, not forbidding. Dictionaries should be a <br/>
playland, not a dark, scary place you dart into for one thing and slam shut <br/>
behind you. If you believe they ARE fun, you should look things up in front of <br/>
your children, often, and with enthusiasm. That will teach them how to use <br/>
reference materials, and will make them want to do so, because they will see it as <br/>
something useful and enjoyable that adults do. If you believe dictionaries and <br/>
encyclopedias ARE dark, scary and forbidding, why on EARTH would you send your <br/>
children there?</div>

<br/>
OK.  To me this kind of fits in the category of forcing independence (or <br/>
coaxing independence) before the child is ready to be independent.<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically, I believe in letting my child depend on me as long as <br/>
he thinks he needs it.  I have faith that he has the urge to be <br/>
independent.  I also believe that most kinds of pushing on my part <br/>
undermine his journey to independence.  I don&#39;t think they enhance it.<br/>

<br/>
Interestingly, there is criticism going around that by just telling people <br/>
how to homeschool or how to unschool that we&#39;re keeping them from discovering <br/>
their own way to do it.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it makes some sense to me.  Other times I remember that nobody can <br/>
learn how to unschool confidently by reading or talking or writing on lists <br/>
like this.  They have to see how it feels in real life, on a boring day and on <br/>
an exciting day.  They have to get to the point that it&#39;s effortless and is <br/>
happening even when they&#39;re not &quot;doing&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
But I think sometimes experienced unschoolers DO &quot;hold back&quot; some in the face <br/>
of questions.    Sometimes it&#39;s for the same reason parents should just <br/>
answer the question, maybe add a bit of trivia, or remind the kid where she saw a <br/>
rhinoceros (or whatever) and then wait for more questions.   <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not answering, there&#39;s answering simply, there&#39;s answering with more <br/>
detail, and then there&#39;s suffocating a person with information they&#39;re just <br/>
not ready for.<br/>

Well, here&#39;s one person&#39;s experience/assurance: Our experience so far <br/>
has been that the deep thinking does not take the magic out of <br/>
childhood at all. I too have a deep questioning kid (two actually) <br/>
and the deep discussions just get more and more interesting as they <br/>
get older, yet they maintain that magical childlike ability to <br/>
imagine, to play, to explore. I just have to remind myself that just <br/>
because my child could explain how a piston engine worked at 2 (hey, <br/>
he asked, and he kept asking until he understood it) doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
anything about the way he experiences the rest of the world. That&#39;s <br/>
just his quirky way, and the very next minute, he was down on the <br/>
ground making a toy bulldozer go Brrrrrzzzzgggggg across the carpet <br/>
being a basic 2 year old. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that the <br/>
deep inquisitiveness can live side by side with the magical child. I <br/>
know there are authors/&quot;experts&quot; who say otherwise, but that hasn&#39;t <br/>
been my experience so far.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son often asks a question just SO I&#39;ll ask him what he thinks or imagines. <br/>
He does so love to share his point of view, and sometimes that is his way of <br/>
getting me to ask it when he knows I have no idea that he is thinking along <br/>
those lines.<br/>
<br/>
If <br/>
my kids ask me how to spell something, I assume they want to know it <br/>
and I give them the answer. <br/>
I think he often asks me how to spell a word either to double-check himself <br/>
or because he is uncertain-being a new speller and all. I usually tell him to <br/>
sound it out, and if he needs any help, I&#39;ll help him. As soon as he needs <br/>
help, I DO provide the letter for him-I don&#39;t push him to do it himself or tell <br/>
him &quot;you know this!&quot;, I just wait until he asks, or gives me &quot;clues&quot; that he <br/>
really needs help (not just pondering) and I provide the letter he&#39;s looking for, <br/>
then let him continue until he next needs my help. He seems to be quite fine <br/>
with this arrangement. On occasion, when he&#39;s writing a note or a letter, I <br/>
will spell the word for him without having him sound it out, since I know he is <br/>
really interested in putting the sentences together into a cohesive unit, and <br/>
making him take the time in that situation would probably frustrate him. It <br/>
would me.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading along, and this is such an interesting thread! As I read I<br/>
have so many responses, but actually grabbing the time to formulate some<br/>
kind of coherent email response has been tough lately. So, I&#39;m thinking,<br/>
digesting, and wishing I had more time to jump in.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I like threes, maybe that number is just particularly relevant in my<br/>
life. I have 3 kids who each look for different things from me when they ask<br/>
questions. My youngest would ask me over and over &quot;Why is Buzz sad, mama?&quot;<br/>
when watching Buzz Lightyear, StarCommand, and it took me a few times of<br/>
trying to answer him to realize that what he really wanted me to say was,<br/>
&quot;Why do you think he&#39;s sad?&quot; Once I got the pattern down, things went much<br/>
more smoothly! *g* Like Sang&#39;s son, I guess, my guy really wants me to ask<br/>
him what he thinks, and he&#39;ll get mad if I break protocol.<br/>
<br/>
I also seem to have 3 basic kinds of responses: 1) provide the information<br/>
2) ask what they think and 3) say let&#39;s go look it up. The situations<br/>
dictate the kind of response, I think. Matter of fact questions like<br/>
spelling, where are we going, etc. are just asking for quick, easy<br/>
information. More philosophical questions, for me, seem to require a &quot;what<br/>
do you think?&quot; response and usually end up leading to really great<br/>
conversations that would have been shut down if I had just given my own pat<br/>
answer as if it were definitive in some way. Questions I don&#39;t know the<br/>
answer to off the top of my head require a curious and upbeat, &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
know. Let&#39;s look it up!&quot; They may or may not want to sit with me while we<br/>
look it up on the computer or a book; sometimes I&#39;ll just report back to<br/>
them or we&#39;ll ask their father when he gets home for science-related things.<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s a combination of all three: I&#39;ll share what little I know,<br/>
we&#39;ll speculate together and then look it up for more info.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I don&#39;t get too hung up over the questions. My kids are perfectly<br/>
capable of stopping me if I begin to ramble beyond their curiosity. ;)  Part<br/>
of this may be because they&#39;ve never been damaged by the school experience<br/>
of someone shoving unwanted information down their throats. I love that they<br/>
ask questions, and it&#39;s usually their questions that reveal how much they<br/>
know--not in a quizzing kind of way, but in a genuine give and take<br/>
conversation and speculation kind of way. I love hearing the way their minds<br/>
work and how they make connections. Information that they probably would not<br/>
recall if put on the spot in a test or by someone verbally quizzing them<br/>
just flows when the conversation and connections are there--that, to me, is<br/>
real knowledge, not just some regurgitated, isolated factoid.<br/>

Sometimes, especially with Holly, I&#39;ll give a two-phase answer, like &quot;When I <br/>
was younger I used to think this, but now I think this other thing.&quot;   Among <br/>
other things, I hope it give her confidence in her ideas AND the flexibility to <br/>
accept that they might change.<br/>
