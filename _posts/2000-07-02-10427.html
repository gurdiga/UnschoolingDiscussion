<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197472436">I am early on my journey as a parent (and in some ways as a <br/>
human spirit, but that&#39;s another discussion altogether) but my take <br/>
on the whole &#39;discipline&#39; thing is that punishment and rewards (both <br/>
equally) do not lead to inner discipline, but instead a reliance on <br/>
external pressure to show the way.  I know this is true in my case, <br/>
having been raised and schooled with the tradititional <br/>
punishment/reward system.  I am trying to rediscover the single-<br/>
minded-ness of purpose and inner strength I am told I possessed <br/>
as a young child, before the interference of school with it&#39;s 10-out-of-<br/>
10&#39;s and &#39;poor&#39; with it&#39;s peer-pressure and condescendence.  And <br/>
so I&#39;m unschooling, hopefully to not inflict those things on my own <br/>
children.  I said I&#39;d stay off the &#39;smacking&#39; theme, but there&#39;s one <br/>
quote I&#39;d like to add, from Adele Faber and Eileen Mazlish and I <br/>
forget which book of theirs it&#39;s from, or even the exact wording, but <br/>
it&#39;s something along the lines of how sad it is that even parents <br/>
with college-level education, supposedly intelligent people cannot <br/>
find a way to deal effectively with their children without using <br/>
violence.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use time-out or any other such form of punishment.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t remove &#39;privileges&#39; (what do people regard as privileges, <br/>
anyhow?  This is a serious question, btw, I&#39;ve never quite <br/>
understood this term) unless they were directly involved in <br/>
whatever, so that the &#39;removal&#39; was a direct consecquence of the <br/>
action, like when the kids wouldn&#39;t tidy up their stuff, so they put it <br/>
in bin-bags and I said it had gone to the dustbin-dragon.  That&#39;s a <br/>
direct consequence. and they chose to put their stuff in the <br/>
rubbish.  And I don&#39;t use star-charts or anything like that either.  If <br/>
anyone&#39;s interested in a good book on the subject of training, I <br/>
particularly like Don&#39;t Shoot the Dog, by Karen Pryor (I think)  I got <br/>
it from my local LLL group library.<br/>
