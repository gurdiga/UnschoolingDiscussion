Have you guys been in schools lately? I live in Chicago and they are pretty <br/>
pitiful. And we know lots of people going to them every day. Just as I don&#39;t <br/>
want to sacrifice my own kids by sending them to school so that I can help <br/>
fix a system that will take several children&#39;s lifetimes to fix, I happily <br/>
support my local public school so that the children I love can have a better <br/>
experience right now.<br/>
