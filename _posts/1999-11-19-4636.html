<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641853426">I sent this but I never saw it come out on my e-mail from the list...<br/>
<br/>
   I believe that it is so much better to treat children with respect and <br/>
care, to take the time to talk out a situation with them rather than just <br/>
using quick penalties/punishments, etc.  However one of the things that I <br/>
find hardest is that I don&#39;t know where to see that kind of <br/>
parenting/treatment of children modeled.  I believe in it but I feel like <br/>
it&#39;s so hard to live up to my ideals because I wasn&#39;t raised that way and I <br/>
don&#39;t see it in the people I know.  I know there are people out there, like <br/>
many of you on this list, and that&#39;s why this group is so much help to me but <br/>
I wish that I could really see it in practice.  <br/>
   I find myself instead looking to a few fictional characters, like the mom <br/>
(Marmy) in Little Women.  My kids know that she&#39;s one of my ideals and so <br/>
when I lose my patience and yell or whatever, they joke with me, &quot;That wasn&#39;t <br/>
very Marmy-like.&quot;  Anyway, just wondered if you struggle with this also and <br/>
what any of you may have done to find role models or learn new ways of being <br/>
and have them stick.<br/>
