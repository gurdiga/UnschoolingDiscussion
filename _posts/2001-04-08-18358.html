<div id="ygrps-yiv-473951294">I know a 10 year old who found strange photos of her own friends in her<br/>
dad&#39;s room.  She called 911 and her dad is now in jail for a looong time.<br/>
 Turns out he was giving them sleeping pills and molesting them during<br/>
sleepovers.  I never met this man myself, but everything I&#39;d heard about<br/>
him to that point indicated that he was a good father.<br/>

&lt;snip&gt;My mom told me early on, &quot;Always tell the truth, even if it were to<br/>
mean that <br/>
me or your dad would have to go to jail because of it.&quot;  <br/>
