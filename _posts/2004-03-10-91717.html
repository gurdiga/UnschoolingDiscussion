<br/>
I&#39;ve been browsing around your site and it&#39;s really fun and wonderful. <br/>
You should brag about it a little bit.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287290095">Heidi, I think, pointed out that she was having problems accessing my site. Well, I guess I&#39;ve learned why the free site is free. lol   Thanks for bringing it to my attention. Guess I haven&#39;t had many visits before.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve upgraded my site, but it will take a couple of days to go into effect. Once my domain is available, I&#39;ll transfer all my files from the free site (url below) to the new site, and there shouldn&#39;t be any more problems accessing it--and those pesky ads will be gone, too. No point in having a website that I want people to see if they can&#39;t see it.<br/>
