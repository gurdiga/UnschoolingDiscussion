<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting, but not really relevant to what I was saying. I&#39;ve seen <br/>
and heard stories like that from real life unschoolers (not just <br/>
supposedly made-up stories on a list), people who definitely embrace <br/>
an unschooling belief, but struggle with implementing it and <br/>
integrating it into a parenting style. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;But it doesn&#39;t mean that when I&#39;m half <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a straw man.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny, that kid didn&#39;t feel like straw at midnight, with his Star <br/>
Wars book in hand :-). Though his hair *is* straw colored...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To call it a &quot;free-for-all lifestyle&quot; reveals a prejudice. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it is simply a term I&#39;ve chosen for that lifestyle. It&#39;s not a <br/>
parenting style that I embrace, but it&#39;s another one out there. It <br/>
may work for some people and their kids, and if so it&#39;s neither <br/>
better nor worse than any other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You can probably <br/>
&gt; unschool and maintain that prejudice against other unschoolers, but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it won&#39;t <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; really benefit you emotionally to do that. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe I hold any prejudice against others that unschool <br/>
like that. If it works for them, great.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve never read when I needed to go to sleep.  I&#39;ve said, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>

 </span></blockquote>earlier.  It&#39;s do <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; things for real reasons, not arbitrary reasons.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we&#39;re saying very close to the same thing. The thing that I <br/>
was trying to get across to the original poster is that it&#39;s *okay* <br/>
to say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m too tired.&quot; She seemed to feel very <br/>
uncomfortable with setting any kind of personal limit like that, and <br/>
I think therein can lie the road to burnout, if you feel that you <br/>
always have to be doing things for your kids, beyond your own <br/>
personal comfort or boundaries. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Most of the homeschooling burnout comes from structure-using <br/>
 </span></blockquote>families.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d agree with that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Truly, those who have claimed &quot;burnout&quot; who are unschoolers and who <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have come <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and told us about it seem to be people who never really got into <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the flow of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; natural learning, but where hoping for it to happen during off <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hours, and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hoped for it to look like school structure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;ve seen something different, I&#39;ve seen people who do <br/>
embrace unschooling, but struggle with the issue I discussed above, <br/>
setting personal limits so they don&#39;t feel like they personally have <br/>
to be everything to everybody in the household.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our limits are philosophical and very real.<br/>
&gt; They just don&#39;t look like deadlines with rules and kids being <br/>
 </span></blockquote>grounded or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sent to their rooms for breaking rules.  It&#39;s a whole different way <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; looking at and living life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ditto. And that&#39;s what I was trying to get across, that you *can* set <br/>
personal limits, and that it is a very different thing from setting <br/>
arbitrary rules.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not the &quot;STYLE&quot; of being, it&#39;s the understanding behind it, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trust in human nature and goodness, and the respect for children as <br/>
&gt; individual people that has the effect some of us (I&#39;m not the only <br/>
 </span></blockquote>one) are <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trying to share.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to think you&#39;re not implying that I (or other people who <br/>
have discussed personal limits) *don&#39;t* have that trust in human <br/>
nature, goodness, and respect for children. I think it&#39;s completely <br/>
possible to respect your children and yet respect yourself, and I do <br/>
see people struggling with how to do that. It&#39;s not always easy to <br/>
implement, and it&#39;s a daily decision-making process. For instance, <br/>
I&#39;m working on a new novel, and that usually takes me out of the <br/>
house for 2 hours a day to write. But lately, my kids have been <br/>
getting stressed whenever I go to write (my husband is always here <br/>
with them when I&#39;m not, so they&#39;re not being left in arbitrary care). <br/>
So should I respect my children&#39;s signs of stress and stop going to <br/>
write? Or should I respect my own need to have creative outlet and <br/>
continue going to write? It doesn&#39;t work for me to write every few <br/>
days, I lose the flow of the novel. It also doesn&#39;t work to write <br/>
here in the house with the kids, and it doesn&#39;t work to write in <br/>
smaller increments than 2 hours. Right now, my answer was to quit <br/>
writing for awhile, but I&#39;d be lying if I said I&#39;m completely <br/>
thrilled with that. Still, the need of my children came first in this <br/>
circumstance. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an easy decision. There&#39;s a <br/>
constant gap in this place in my life where my novel lies, half <br/>
finished. That emptiness will remain until such time as I can work on <br/>
it again. Decisions like this happen every day, to real life <br/>
unschooling families. Those who respect their children, and yet <br/>
struggle with respecting their own needs as well.<br/>
<br/>
I think for any homeschooling parent, whether structured or not, <br/>
there&#39;s always a fine balance between giving the kids what they need, <br/>
and respecting your own needs for privacy, space, intimate time with <br/>
spouse, time to exercise or do something creative, read a book <br/>
uninterrupted, or whatever. As parents who are with their kids all <br/>
day long, we *do* have in common with more structured homeschoolers <br/>
this basic issue of time. Schooling parents simply ship their kids <br/>
off for 7 hours a day, but we make a choice not to do that. Finding <br/>
personal balance and setting personal limits are not issues that are <br/>
limited to structured homeschoolers. And for many of us whose <br/>
children are still quite young, it can be a big issue. I can see as <br/>
my kids get older that it will be less and less of an issue as the <br/>
years go by and they develop more of their own interests and an <br/>
ability to play independently.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well nobody used the word &quot;servant&quot; but you.<br/>
&gt; And your characterization of people &quot;doing whatever their children <br/>
 </span></blockquote>ask&quot; is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not a good picture of what&#39;s happening in those families where <br/>
 </span></blockquote>unschooling is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; working effortlessly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, nor was it intended to be. It was in answer to a lengthy question <br/>
posed by a parent for whom this is *not* working. And I&#39;d have to say <br/>
that I feel that unschooling works very well in our family (most of <br/>
the time!), so I was trying to share some things that I&#39;ve discovered <br/>
that help to make it work smoothly for us.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, if a parenting style works for someone, that&#39;s fine. Some <br/>
people may be much more inclined to follow their children&#39;s wishes <br/>
100% of the time. Indeed, I have friends for whom they feel that is <br/>
their life calling, to just be and do everything that their kids are <br/>
interested in. And they&#39;re great parents, and great unschoolers too. <br/>
They are perfectly happy playing dolls with their youngest, or <br/>
reading books to their tribe, or making up plays and puppet shows all <br/>
day long. They go to bed when their kids do, and wake up when their <br/>
kids do. That is precisely what they want to be doing with their <br/>
life, and this child-centered approach works very well for them. For <br/>
others, who may have outside interests of their own, there is <br/>
sometimes a conflict between what the parent wants and what the child <br/>
wants. Or even with no outside interests, there might be a difference <br/>
of goals. Like the parent wants to stay up for some intimate time <br/>
with their spouse, but one child doesn&#39;t go to sleep until midnight <br/>
while another one wakes up at 5:30 in the morning. Where does one <br/>
find time to sleep, even, in such a circumstance? These are the <br/>
things that parents, real true unschooling parents (whether they fit <br/>
your personal definition or no) struggle with. There is not *one* <br/>
answer that works for all these people, and there never will be. <br/>
There&#39;s not one way to go about parenting as an unschooler, nor one <br/>
decision that works for all. Sometimes even the best decision isn&#39;t <br/>
going to be the one that makes *everyone* in a family happy (as in my <br/>
example with my writing above).<br/>
<br/>
I think each parenting style brings its own gifts and deficits to a <br/>
family. While a parent who concentrates 100% on her kids all the time <br/>
has a special gift of unlimited time and energy with her kids, it <br/>
might have the deficit of her children not seeing her pursue any of <br/>
her own goals and plans. She might never take time for herself, and <br/>
her own needs. Whereas a parent who chooses to spend time pursuing <br/>
their own goals will have to do more problem-solving as conflicts <br/>
arise between the parents needs and the children&#39;s needs, they also <br/>
give their kids the gift of seeing a parent who loves to learn and <br/>
follow their own stars. There are, of course, many different styles <br/>
and many styles in between these two. I even know unschooling <br/>
families where both of the parents work and they hire a nanny to <br/>
unschool their kids. That&#39;s one extreme. I know another family where <br/>
they&#39;ve chosen to live in a bus so that neither parent had to work <br/>
much and they could spend all their time doing what their kids are <br/>
interested in. That&#39;s another extreme. Most families fall somewhere <br/>
in the middle, and thus have to learn (and maybe constantly re-learn) <br/>
how to balance the needs and wants of everyone in the family. <br/>
