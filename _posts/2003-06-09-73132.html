<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry Kelly, I&#39;m waiting on my sister and her dh&#39;s bonus!! I really, truly <br/>
can&#39;t afford the conference this year due to the work being done on my teeth (no <br/>
insurance and lots of money going out) BUT, my sis&#39;s dh might get a really <br/>
large bonus and she is willing to help us get up there if it all works out.<br/>
So we should know in a couple more weeks.<br/>
Hope for my bil to get a LOT!! :) hehe  I adore my sweet sister. Hopefully <br/>
we&#39;ll both be there with SEVEN kids between the two of us.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s almost an unschooler....still does math workbooks once in a while.<br/>
BUT, she&#39;s let up on tv, video games and the whole religion issues. Cool.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I have a fuzzy vision of her sitting in the hospital room, by the window, <br/>
&gt; with I don&#39;t even remember now one or two kids.  Either two and one was <br/>
&gt; climbing, <br/>
&gt; or one and who was climbing up and down and around.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not on painkillers anymore and would kind like to meet Ren standing <br/>
&gt; upright.  <br/>

<br/>
It was two kids and Jalen was climbing and grabbing the camera as I was <br/>
trying to take a picture of you and you said I was being patient with him, which <br/>
totally made me feel great! It wasn&#39;t easy with a busy toddler.<br/>
Another time I came with just Marty...that was much calmer. But I think more <br/>
drug induced. <br/>
