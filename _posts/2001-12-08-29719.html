<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765495291">I have a lab Dalmatian, and after about 10 years, he has calmed down. He<br/>
is a large yappy dog. This could be the Dalmatian influence.<br/>
He has always been great with kids, lots of fun, but quite challenging,<br/>
because he is not as easily trainable as some dogs. I think this is a sign<br/>
of intelligence, he sneaks around and does what he wants, but  he only does<br/>
forbidden things when he thinks I am not looking; for example, stand at the<br/>
counter and pick out what he would like to eat, or open doors with his nose.<br/>
He has a fondness for garbage despite the Tabasco, pepper, and all the<br/>
tricks that are suppose to discourage him. He has ruined our new carpet,<br/>
doors, shoes, furniture, but he is still around, and I am glad.<br/>
