<div id="ygrps-yiv-124691907">One of my favorite essays by Sandra is the one on teaching vs  learning---how <br/>
teaching can end up just being a song and dance if the  learner isn&#39;t <br/>
receptive.  <br/>
 <br/>
I was recently explaining something along the same lines and realized that  <br/>
it can be something even deeper.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve mentioned before about a parenting class I took at Cameron&#39;s  <br/>
school---way back when he was still in school. As usual, the people who attended  the <br/>
parenting classes (by choice) are the ones that need it the least!  &lt;G&gt; But <br/>
there were still a few....<br/>
 <br/>
One was Margaret. She had two daughters---like six and 11 or so. I forget  <br/>
ages exactly.<br/>
 <br/>
One of her examples of her child&#39;s disregard for her authority (!) was  that, <br/>
in the mornings, as they pulled out of the drive-way, she would &quot;ask&quot; her  <br/>
older daughter to get out and toss the newspaper on her elderly neighbor&#39;s  <br/>
porch. The daughter had NO desire to accomodate, but after threats and bribes,  <br/>
she&#39;d get out and begrudgingly pick up the paper and put it on the porch. It was <br/>
 a fight every single morning. Margaret wanted a way to get the daughter to  <br/>
pick up the paper *on her own*.<br/>
 <br/>
Withholding allowance, grounding, other punishments/threats were suggested.  <br/>
I offered that she should just go out, cheerfully place the paper on the <br/>
porch,  and get back in the car, and MODEL the behavior she was after---for a long <br/>
time.  She should also mention how much she likes Mrs. SoandSo and how hard it <br/>
is for  her to walk so far for her paper. Maybe how good it makes her feel to <br/>
be  doing something good for Mrs. SoandSo. She did---with good results,  <br/>
especially from the younger daughter.<br/>
 <br/>
My point is this: She was looking to TEACH her daughter that helping others  <br/>
is a nice way to be. What the daughter was LEARNING, on the other hand, was <br/>
that  bullying another person is the way to get what you want.<br/>
 <br/>
In school, my history teacher thought that he was TEACHING me about  <br/>
Elizabethan England. In reality, I LEARNED that history sucks! I actually love  many <br/>
periods in history, just not *his* favorite time period. By spending so  much <br/>
time there, he turned me off history altogether. Took me a long time to  <br/>
&quot;re-learn&quot; that history is fascinating.<br/>
 <br/>
Parents think that they are TEACHING respect and obedience by spanking  their <br/>
kids. In reality, what the children LEARN is that the bigger and meaner  you <br/>
are, the more power you can wield.<br/>
 <br/>
Parents think that TEACHING their children to do chores will result in  <br/>
industrious, responsible children. In reality, the children LEARN that they can  <br/>
make someone else clean ---or expect someone else to do it. By  watching you *do <br/>
for* them, they LEARN that cleaning/helping/doing is a  pleasant and joyful <br/>
thing.<br/>
 <br/>
What is TAUGHT and what is LEARNED can be two completely different  things.<br/>
