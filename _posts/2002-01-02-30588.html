<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They are good people, very bright, and <br/>
&gt;have high-paying jobs that make a difference in our community.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like all one could expect from a valued person in the <br/>
community. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On the other <br/>
&gt;hand, they could work harder. They could be doctors or teachers (as some of <br/>
&gt;their parents were) and they&#39;re not. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A dear r/l friend of mine has two daughters, both are doctors. And while <br/>
I&#39;ve met them and they are also wonderful people, I can&#39;t say they are <br/>
more of an attribute to society than say a farm worker. (Well, actually <br/>
personally I revere a farm worker far and above a radiologist, but thats <br/>
my own bias *smirk)<br/>
<br/>
Just today we were talking, happy new year and all, and she asked me if I <br/>
was &#39;just going to stay home and be just a mom now that I&#39;m back in <br/>
town.&#39;  *smile*<br/>
<br/>
She also stated that her daughter is going to return to work now that the <br/>
new baby is almost 3 months old. Her older boy is 2ish. She went on to <br/>
tell me that her daughter isn&#39;t the type to stay home &#39;because she needed <br/>
more of a challange than motherhood.&#39; Again, I smiled.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on top side of executive managment. I&#39;ve made some pretty big <br/>
bux in my life. And the most important and challanging work I&#39;m doing now <br/>
is staying at home. Its MUCH easier to go off to work somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
What a shame that anyone should perpetuate the downplaying of roles and <br/>
up-playing of classes in our society. A damn shame.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wonder if had they had watched less <br/>
&gt;TV growing up, would they be harder workers. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Annette, can you please explain what you mean by &#39;harder workers&#39;?<br/>
I know a lot of doctors and teachers that take the easiest way out to get <br/>
through the day, and are very unhappy people. These people are selfish <br/>
and not apart of the community in a way that deems them valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, being a &#39;harder&#39; worker doesn&#39;t make  you a &#39;smarter&#39; <br/>
worker or more valuable in any way. Like the expression of &#39;running <br/>
around like a chicken without a head&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If anything, from what I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;seen, watching TV makes people a bit more willing to lay back and relax. <br/>
&gt;Does anyone else think that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>TV is a major issue. Its something that can definately be bantered back <br/>
and forth.<br/>
Yet, I don&#39;t find &#39;laying back&#39; and &#39;relaxing&#39; anything but great <br/>
attributes of a lifestyle we all should aspire to.<br/>

home. I&#39;m taking on a new job as educational consultant, chef, <br/>
chauffer, counselor, physical activities coordinator, child nurturer, <br/>
etc. It&#39;s going to be such a rewarding job... I&#39;ll be influencing the <br/>
next generation!... the generation that&#39;s going to one day be taking <br/>
care of us!&quot;<br/>
