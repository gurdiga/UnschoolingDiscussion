<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114847714">I wanted to say that I absolutely loved your post! I have a lot of the<br/>
same issues and I really enjoyed reading your words. They make me feel<br/>
less alone in how I choose to parent. I too don&#39;t do things the<br/>
&quot;right&quot; way all the time (even most of the time) as &quot;they&quot; do them. It<br/>
is hard sometimes to be different than my neighbors/friends. Thank you<br/>
for sharing.</div>
