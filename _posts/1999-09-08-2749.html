&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been gone a couple days (dh is only home on weekends, sigh) <br/>
&gt; But, wanted to point out that I am not trying to criticize anyone<br/>
&gt; because they can&#39;t put math sentences on paper.  My thinking is that<br/>
&gt; we need to know how to communicate math problems on paper just as we<br/>
&gt; do the English language. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  but do we &quot;all&quot; need to know how to communicate math on paper?  and <br/>
if we don&#39;t, then what is the point of being forced to learn to do <br/>
so.  isn&#39;t it sort of a waste of time while we could be using our <br/>
time to learn other things that we feel we need to know at any given <br/>
moment in our lifetimes?  <br/>
<br/>
If we work with others that need to know<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how we arrived at our math answers and cannot communicate it in<br/>
&gt; writing we could be somewhat hindered could we not?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  but &quot;if&quot; we worked with others that need to know how we got there <br/>
and the method of presentation happened to be required on paper, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t we have ended up in that position by choice - a career in <br/>
engineering perhaps? - and in that respect knew we would need to know <br/>
and have a desire to learn to do so and chose to apply our efforts to <br/>
learn for that sake?<br/>
<br/>
  i had a funny feeling you were going to ask these questions and so <br/>
have been giving it some thought.  in addition to my above comments, <br/>
i can&#39;t honestly remember the last time i had to show a math solution <br/>
to anyone on paper - i think it was probably in high school for a <br/>
teacher!  but then my career choices have not included a calling for <br/>
much math in this capacity either.  wow, you&#39;ve just made me realize <br/>
how much time i wasted learning how to put it down on paper, never <br/>
use it, and then forget most of how to do it!  if i found myself <br/>
working in that capacity, i would have to reinvest lots of time with <br/>
a crash refresher course anyhow!  so i think the time spent on the <br/>
first go-around could have been much more wisely invested on something else <br/>
i would be using from day to day or just wanted to learn because it <br/>
was interesting!  <br/>

I agree with this totally.  I had an unschooled friend who decided, at about <br/>
age 17, that he wanted to go to college - having decided what career to <br/>
pursue.  He got a list of what he needed to know in order to get into the <br/>
school he needed to get into.....took 6 months to learn/review what he needed <br/>
to learn/review.....and got in!!!  It went much faster at 17 and accomplished <br/>
the same thing that years of boring work when he was younger would have.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  there&#39;s another aspect of this that i just thought of when you say <br/>
it went much &quot;faster&quot; at 17 compared to years.  in the traditional <br/>
ps, it seems as though an awful lot of effort and time is spent &quot;drilling&quot; <br/>
certain info into kids in an effort to make the kids &quot;get it&quot;.   i <br/>
can remember having difficulty with various subjects between grade <br/>
7-12 and just barely passing the tests in some cases.  it wasn&#39;t like <br/>
i didn&#39;t try.... i spent hours doing homework and trying to &quot;get it&quot;. <br/>
 later, i had to take some of the same subjects at a college level <br/>
and remember how i dreaded the idea.  but what was very interesting <br/>
is that right from the start, it all seem to make sense!  it all <br/>
&quot;clicked&quot;!  i loved the subject, had fun with it, spent mimimal time <br/>
getting the homework done, and looked forward to attending the <br/>
classes because i felt as though i could participate on a higher <br/>
level of understanding.  <br/>
<br/>
   h-m-m-m...  i think this may tie in with what we&#39;ve been <br/>
discussing off and on here about kids getting to subjects in their <br/>
own due time?  i think it certainly is natural for parents to be <br/>
concerned if a child doesn&#39;t learn certain basics by a certain time <br/>
but i think there is definately something to be said about the mind <br/>
being ready to accept and process that information easier when it is <br/>
ready - and that readiness happens at very different times for <br/>
everyone.  <br/>

And it seems like the ps schedule pushes more and more advanced math subject <br/>
on younger and younger kids.<br/>
