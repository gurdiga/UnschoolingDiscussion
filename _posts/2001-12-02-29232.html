 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m interested.  I&#39;d also like to hear more about your daughter, if that&#39;s <br/>
ok with her.  I&#39;m quite interested in the homeschooled/unschooled kids who <br/>
didn&#39;t go the academic route to a career.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133407606">I&#39;m so glad you posted! I&#39;m the mother of an 11 yo dyslexic -- we&#39;ve spent a great deal of time in occupational therapy, and we&#39;ve learned amazing things. I don&#39;t have personal experience with it, as you do, but I can speak to some of the wonderful things they&#39;re doing with young children now, too.<br/>
