 </span></blockquote>Hey think what you want.  I wouldn&#39;t ask a question if I truly didn&#39;t want to <br/>
hear responses about ways to handle it.  Why in the world would I open myself <br/>
up for such accusations?  This ISN&#39;T my idea of fun.  But, I am committed to <br/>
making the best decisions for my daughter that I can.  I&#39;ve committed myself <br/>
to unschooling and am working hard to that end.<br/>
<br/>
It still is important that I got responses because things might change.  <br/>
Right now she cannot attend either of the local community colleges at her <br/>
age.  They are turning high school graduates away for lack of classroom <br/>
space.  Well, they ADMIT them but a large portion never get registered for <br/>
classes because there simply are none open after the first few hours of <br/>
registration.<br/>
<br/>
They used to be fairly liberal with allowing homschooled students to attend <br/>
classes if they were 15 but they say they simply do not have the room for <br/>
them anymore.  This was determined after she went ahead and began to read and <br/>
fill out an application.  Then we made a phone call to the admit office.  <br/>
They were very short and plainly said it would not happen.  I also got <br/>
information from another homeschool list locally that tells me their children <br/>
were not allowed to take classes this past year either.  I know it has been <br/>
done in the past or I would never have asked you all about it. <br/>
<br/>
As for colleges far away, I&#39;m sure there is a college SOMEWHERE that would <br/>
admit a 14 year old.  My 14 year old is not ready to go away and be on her <br/>
own.  As for MIT, God bless them but my daughter is no where near the <br/>
abilities that are required to graduate from such a prestigious school at <br/>
such a young age.  She&#39;s never had a high school course in anything, (except <br/>
German) sure she knows A LOT but she&#39;s not ready for that.<br/>
<br/>
If things change in the future or she persuades a professor or provost that <br/>
she really can contribute and keep up, maybe they will change their minds, <br/>
maybe in a few months, or a year, it would still be going &quot;early&quot; and young <br/>
to college.<br/>
<br/>
The question was genuine, the responses I felt were sincere and I read them <br/>
carefully and saved them for future reference, no one&#39;s posts were &quot;just for <br/>
fun&quot; or to waste time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you felt that way.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re just making this stuff up.  This is chatter.<br/>
In the same day you said two different things and now a third thing.<br/>
<br/>
You have NO way to know &quot;a large portion [of high school graduates] never get <br/>
registered.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They used to be fairly liberal with allowing homschooled students to attend <br/>
classes if they were 15 but they say they simply do not have the room for <br/>
them anymore.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is stuff you&#39;re making up as you go.<br/>
You&#39;ve spoken for this group and now you&#39;re speaking for &quot;they&quot; the local <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; This was determined after she went ahead and began to read and <br/>
fill out an application. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
During reading and filling out an application that was &quot;determined&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The question was genuine, the responses I felt were sincere and I read them <br/>
carefully and saved them for future reference, no one&#39;s posts were &quot;just for <br/>
fun&quot; or to waste time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The question was inconsistent.  Your explanations were contradictory.  <br/>
The responses WERE sincere.  <br/>
No one intended to waste time, but your responses made it feel like a waste <br/>
of energy.<br/>
<br/>
Others probably got encouragement and ideas, but I don&#39;t believe you asked in <br/>
good faith, nor do I think you will understand what that even means.   I <br/>
think you were dishonest with your daughter or with us or both, and I wish <br/>
you would not post here because of that, because it&#39;s not the first time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459834498">I think I said in a previous post but in case you missed it, I live in VA, <br/>
Stafford.  There are two community colleges within driving distance.<br/>
<br/>
One, Germanna is about twenty miles away and the other, Northern VA Community <br/>
College is maybe 15 maybe 40 depending on which campus.<br/>
