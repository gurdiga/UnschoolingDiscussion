<br/>
diplomacy: a blessing and a curse.  i was trying to be cautious of faith&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
faith, pls. keep in mind that of course we are talking about the method & not <br/>
you.  <br/>

Children have to be themselves, not some picture that we (or any one else) would draw for them.  I guess that&#39;s why we&#39;re all unschoolers!<br/>
