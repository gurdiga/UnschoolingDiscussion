<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682971987">Hi Fellow Unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As the subject stated, my daughter Laurie was unschooled from birth. <br/>
She is now a senior in college with a 4.0 and absolutely loves <br/>
learning. I am in the process of writing a book about her life and <br/>
it&#39;s going quite well I might add. I&#39;m hoping to send it to a <br/>
publisher within a month. <br/>
<br/>
I am new to this group. I just thought I&#39;d see what the buzz is on <br/>
unschooling these days. I haven&#39;t really kept up with it for the past <br/>
ten years. I just followed my instincts and let life proceed <br/>
naturally. I would be happy to answer questions for anyone who is <br/>
just getting started with unschooling or having any doubts. <br/>
Unschooling my daughter has been the best accomplishment of my life. <br/>
There was never a doubt in my mind that I was doing the right thing. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter sent me the Time article yesterday. How wonderful that <br/>
the world is waking up to the benefits of this lifestyle. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989493804">Hi Marianne,<br/>
<br/>
You asked a perfect question. I used no workbooks or any structural <br/>
learning. Laurie was free to do as she chose at all times. My goal <br/>
was to let her instigate all of her learning. She had no rules except <br/>
that she could not hurt herself or anyone else. Everything else was <br/>
open to her. Most think this would lead to an irresponsible <br/>
undisciplined child. I found just the opposite to be true. <br/>
She &#39;studied&#39; only what she wanted to study and therefore enjoyed the <br/>
process of learning. She is like a sponge; she hears something and <br/>
remembers it. We both attended college and had quite a few classes <br/>
together. I would study for 3-4 hours to get an A or a B; she would <br/>
glance at her notes thirty minutes before class and make A&#39;s, often <br/>
100&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s difficult for some to realize that they can put total faith and <br/>
trust in their child learning what they need to know as they need to <br/>
know it. We don&#39;t have to &quot;teach&quot; them a single thing. <br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t named the book yet. We have ideas but nothing seems to <br/>
cover it all. It&#39;s about unschooling, parenting, and living a <br/>
lifestyle that would baffle many. I&#39;m trying not to degrade schools <br/>
too much but instead raise unschooling to the pedestal it deserves to <br/>
be on. I will let you know when the book is for sale as soon as I <br/>
know myself.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to ask anything. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Valerie<br/>
<br/>

Is your daughter an only one?  From your post I figured she is.<br/>
I have older children. All went to ps. But these children are much <br/>
older and have all left home now.  Toni is the only one left at <br/>
home.  She did go to school for 6 yrs.  I find it very hard for her <br/>
to be motivated to do much at all. At the moment she is doing *work <br/>
experience*.  Going to work with her dad most days!!  She loves this <br/>
and so does he. <br/>
Did your dd find it hard being an only child.  (I am presuming she is)<br/>

Yes, Laurie is my only child. I wanted more but it wasn&#39;t meant to <br/>
be. I did babysit other children the entire time she was growing up <br/>
though. We&#39;re still close with those kids. Laurie LOVED being an only <br/>
child. She was always content with a book or a computer and silence.<br/>
Laurie was seldom motivated to do much of anything. I thought she <br/>
might end up being totally without self-discipline, however I kept my <br/>
mouth shut and let her be. She is now one of the most self-<br/>
disciplined people I know. She does what needs doing, maintains her <br/>
own home, car, etc. She&#39;s never late for work or class; and always <br/>
has all of her work done ahead of time. Let Toni have fun (and her <br/>
dad). She knows what she needs at this time...trust her. :-)<br/>

     Valerie, I loved all of your posts!  Your book sounds wonderful and I&#39;m <br/>
so glad to hear the experiences of someone who&#39;s gotten all the way to <br/>
adulthood with unschooling.  My son is about to turn 17 and my other four <br/>
boys are younger than him so I&#39;m getting close to seeing my first one reach <br/>
adulthood.  He took the California high school proficiency test on Saturday <br/>
so that he could just start taking whatever community college classes he <br/>
feels like without having to worry about getting some school to sign off <br/>
giving permission (a requirement of some CA community colleges for kids under <br/>
18 without diplomas or the equivalent).<br/>
     I can relate to some of what you said about going it alone with your <br/>
unschooling because the homeschool groups didn&#39;t agree with your approach.  I <br/>
am glad that we have been fortunate enough lately to meet some like-minded <br/>
homeschoolers.  Your move to Canada sounds interesting!  We have talked about <br/>
moving to Canada ourselves at times but aren&#39;t sure if it would be a good <br/>
idea because we can&#39;t get residency and so our kids wouldn&#39;t be able to get <br/>
jobs there later on.  I wouldn&#39;t want them to have to leave an area they have <br/>
come to love because of that.  I wish they still had the option of <br/>
homesteading in certain areas.<br/>
     I look forward to reading your book when it comes out and I&#39;m so glad <br/>
you&#39;ve joined the group here!  <br/>

Thanks Marianne, and if it doesn&#39;t go on sale in New Zealand, I&#39;ll <br/>
ship one to you. Toss those doubts out. She&#39;ll learn just what she <br/>
needs to when she needs to. :-)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the thing, we are ordinary people who discovered unschooling. <br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooled people CAN turn out any other way but <br/>
extraordinary though. You unschoolers with older children may have <br/>
noticed this. The thought processes of a totally unschooled child are <br/>
so logical. They don&#39;t have all of the bs in their minds from years <br/>
of sitting in a desk and doing busywork. I&#39;m certainly no genius - I <br/>
was just blessed with a sil that gifted me with the book Summerhill. <br/>
I do think unschooling raises iq&#39;s. That&#39;s my opinion of course - not <br/>
a lot of research has been done on unschoolers. :-)<br/>

Absolutely!  My dd and I were talking in the car today and her ability to<br/>
reason was blowing me away.  We were discussing some fairly complex<br/>
issues and her processing of the information was keeping pace with mine. <br/>
It&#39;s a good thing *I&#39;m* learning to unschool as well, she&#39;d leave me in<br/>
the dust!  LOL<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We need more stories about unschoolers.  When has it succeeded and <br/>
when has it failed?  HAS it failed?<br/>
<br/>
Every once in awhile, my best friend and I rehash some opinions.  We <br/>
will forever disagree on some things, including abortion, country <br/>
music, and schooling.  She has repeatedly told me that the only <br/>
reason my upbringing worked was because I was already so smart and <br/>
that ordinary children need structured learning and discipline.  I <br/>
tell her that I&#39;m ordinary and my unschooling worked because <br/>
unschooling works.  I need to argue with her some more.<br/>
<br/>
This is something that she is absolutely sure of because she is about <br/>
to graduate with a bachelor&#39;s in Special Education and has watched <br/>
her very opinionated mother raise nine other children besides her <br/>
(don&#39;t panic, eight of them were adopted).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that part of her views on education come from her experience <br/>
with disabled children (the degree in Special Ed and the 8 special <br/>
needs adopted siblings).  It&#39;s very widely understood that special <br/>
kids, especially those with autism, need structure much more than <br/>
regular kids.  I&#39;ll grant that this is true until proven otherwise, <br/>
because I know of one autistic boy who is so routine-centered that he <br/>
gets upset if his father takes a different route while driving him to <br/>
his school or if his teacher deviates from the daily schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any parents of special needs kids in the group?  I&#39;m not <br/>
referring to dyslexia or ADD, but challenges like Down&#39;s Syndrome and <br/>
autism.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691476098">Kris...the ultimate dustbowl... I started college when Laurie did and <br/>
we took several classes together. She left me so far behind that she <br/>
would stand in my bedroom door at night with her hands on her hips <br/>
and say, &quot;Mom, have you done your homework?&quot; (no kidding) and I would <br/>
reply sheepishly, &quot;No, not yet.&quot; to which she replied, &quot;You are SO <br/>
going to embarrass me if you fail.&quot;  sigh.... :-)<br/>
<br/>
At age seven, Laurie started quoting facts and numbers having to do <br/>
with the new prospective superstores. I asked her where she learned <br/>
that and she said, &quot;It was in Time magazine.&quot; I said, &quot;You read Time <br/>
magazine?&quot;  She said, &quot;Well, it was the only thing in the bathroom.&quot;<br/>

Seriously though, she left me floundering in the dust so long ago. <br/>

thought. I&#39;m not criticizing or attacking here, merely asking. <br/>

a project that &quot;proves&quot; or disproves an unschooling theory. She is just <br/>
herself, and my job, as her mom, is to help her clear that path to <br/>
self-knowledge in any way I can.  <br/>

questioning my professors and their methods and was always met with &quot;we do it <br/>
that way because it has to be done that way, always been done that way&quot;, etc. <br/>
I could not in good consciousness finish my master&#39;s with the knowledge I now <br/>

would homeschool, and do something else for work. But educrats believe they <br/>
know everything and you cannot question them. . . I know I have several in my <br/>

  I just tend to look at the pictures!!  But the interesting thing about <br/>
this is that his two older sibs who did &quot;real school&quot; never had any time to <br/>
read anything other than the required reading or textbooks, but Sean will <br/>
pick up anything and read it... and has pretty good recall of just about <br/>
anything and everything he reads.  Amazes me..<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not talking about just the full size articles here, either.  I bring <br/>
him to work with me sometimes and we (some of my co-workers) got on the <br/>
subject of the pros & con&#39;s of long term breastfeeding and the next thing I <br/>
knew Sean was recalling an article (little tiny blurb in the back) in Time <br/>
the week before about the &quot;negative&quot; effects of long term nursing.  I was <br/>
flabbergasted to say the least.  Had to go home and find the issue to see <br/>
what he was talking about.  I&#39;ll never ever question those comments again.  <br/>
He was right on with what the article said.  &lt;shaking my head in amazement&gt;<br/>

 Hey Marianne :)<br/>
<br/>
Well, you know my love of other people&#39;s words:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And it&#39;s been a horrifying academic secret for decades that the children who <br/>
walk away with the highest formal honors, the valedictorians and National <br/>
Merit Scholars, have a horrendous performance record in later life.&quot;  John <br/>
Taylor Gatto<br/>
<br/>
There just different things to learn, right? My husband wasn&#39;t such a <br/>
terrific student, didn&#39;t care about grades, and didn&#39;t go to college (until <br/>
recently, in his 40&#39;s). But, the man knows how to do everything!! Cars, <br/>
building, chess, mountain climbing -- his lists of interests are endless. <br/>
(Lately he loves opera:) His job supports us all nicely.<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, thought learning was about getting a good grade, making <br/>
people proud of you. Impressing others. Once I got out of school, I <br/>
floundered. &quot;Who do I impress now?&quot; I still have trouble with motivation if <br/>
there isn&#39;t the carrot of someone telling me what a good job I&#39;ve done, how <br/>
exceptional I am. (At what, laundry?)<br/>
<br/>
Clearing the path to a true sense of self, whatever that &quot;self&quot; may become -- <br/>
my &quot;goal&quot; as a mom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99971083">I was told those same things Laura. When they told me &quot;you did a <br/>
wonderful job&quot; I would reply with, &quot;I left her alone. I didn&#39;t do a <br/>
thing.&quot;  I agree that our wording needs work. Laurie ended up in <br/>
college with a 4.0 which makes her a success in society&#39;s eyes. She <br/>
would have been a success to me no matter what path she took in life, <br/>
as long as she was happy. <br/>

You made a good point. What would constitute it NOT working?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-925959740">LOL Jeanmarie... and it gets better and better. I have learned so <br/>
much more from listening to Laurie than I EVER learned in school or <br/>
college. The wide variety of topics that catch unschooler&#39;s interest <br/>
is phenomenal. <br/>
<br/>
Laurie just told me on the phone tonight why there are so many <br/>
mosquitoes in Canada. It just never stops.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607959901">I graduated from high school with a 3.8, married at age 18, started <br/>
drinking A LOT seven nights a week, got divorced, started using drugs <br/>
A LOT, somehow landed a great job, found Laurie&#39;s dad at the great <br/>
job, quit the alcohol and drugs, got pregnant and discovered <br/>
unschooling. With unschooling, watching Laurie learn and grow...I was <br/>
finally able to feel like I had accomplished something. Academics are <br/>
not a measure of success, in spite of Laurie&#39;s 4.0 in college. It&#39;s <br/>
her happiness with learning that is important to me.<br/>
