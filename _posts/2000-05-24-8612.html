<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258399262">I&#39;ve gone to NO MAIL for the next two wks b/c dh is out of town AND <br/>
it seems I&#39;ve got the nasty KAKWORM virus ... we have the MacAfee <br/>
virus scanner, etc but it didn&#39;t pick this up ... I&#39;m basically <br/>
computer illiterate, that is to say, I don&#39;t know how to get rid of <br/>
this??? ... *ACK*, I feel SO VIOLATED!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Mara, if you&#39;re reading ~&gt; *YES* I&#39;d love the info about &quot;Growing <br/>
Without Schooling&quot; magazine ... thanks so much :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll return when I&#39;m DEBUGGED :}<br/>
