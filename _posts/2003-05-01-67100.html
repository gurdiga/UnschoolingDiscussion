<div id="ygrps-yiv-582868039">Hello <br/>
I wanted to post on somethng that has been nagging at me for days.  <br/>
I&#39;d like to hear others&#39; opinions.  I recently had a friend pull her <br/>
son out of school to homeschool.  She (mom)has always been self <br/>
conscious about her level of &#39;intelligence&#39;...low self esteem <br/>
basically.  Nevertheless, she is going to college just as I am and <br/>
all the while homeschooling.  She had a neighbor get quite absurd <br/>
with her when she found out that she had pulled her son out of <br/>
school and made the comment that &quot;That should not be allowed...only <br/>
people with college degrees should be allowed to teach children.&quot;  <br/>
Now I was not there, so I cannot say word for word what happened or <br/>
how it was perceived, but how would you respond?  I do not have a <br/>
college degree yet as it has taken 10 + years to get to three years <br/>
of college done and who knows when I will be done, but...I have yet <br/>
to find anything (in that college education)that has enabled me to <br/>
learn with my children better.  Nevertheless, how infuriating!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705272016">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
I think I might ask them to show me the data demonstrating that children of <br/>
people with college degrees are better learners than children of people <br/>
without college degrees.  Then, I suppose I would provide them with a list <br/>
of references so that they could better inform themselves about home-based <br/>
learning.  I would invite them to contact me when they have felt they have <br/>
digested that information, and I would be available for discussion on the <br/>
subject, if they would like.<br/>
<br/>
Absurd is right!  But, definitely misinformed!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573387080">Thanks Marji for your response...yes I think it would be pointless <br/>
to debate the issue until they were more informed and even then we <br/>
may still get nowhere.  I just felt for my friend...it was a <br/>
difficult decision for her and then to hear that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591589953">Yep yep...I agree and will certainly relay the supportive comments <br/>
to my friend.  It is a very skewed view to believe the four year <br/>
degree this person holds makes them more qualified or any other for <br/>
that matter above the (willing) parent.  This person has yet to <br/>
experience &#39;school&#39; as her child is a toddler.  I imagine at some <br/>
point in her child&#39;s schooling years...someone whom she deems <br/>
qualified to teach her child will fall off the pedistol and then <br/>
homeschooling may enter her mind if only for a moment and that is <br/>
enough for me :) Thanks<br/>

Tim...you&#39;ve made some very vivid points!  And I thank you for <br/>
that.  In my view, college does not teach you anything at all in <br/>
regards to learning with children...that comes when and only when <br/>
you take the time to experience it.  We all know the truth about the <br/>
great and powerful Oz...thanks for the posts...this allows me to <br/>
think out loud and perhaps offer some helpful thoughts to my friend.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d just blow it by.  <br/>
A college degree doesn&#39;t teach people to teach children.  Not even a degree <br/>
in education, really.  It can help people who already have the talent, desire <br/>
and inclination to hone their natural ability and proclivity to teach.  Some <br/>
people are just good teachers.   But a PhD in education wouldn&#39;t give someone <br/>
a single CLUE how to interact with another individual human if the PhD-person <br/>
had no interpersonal talent, no awareness of how to read whether the <br/>
&quot;student&quot; was getting what was being presented, and so forth.   There are <br/>
some very, very bad, clueless professional teachers.   And some very good <br/>
teachers who never finished high school, but can explain clearly and simply <br/>
how to do/make/be something, and customize the message for individual <br/>
recipients.<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s unschooling! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
But there&#39;s no sense discussing that with any hostile neighbors.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think I might ask them to show me the data demonstrating that children<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; people with college degrees are better learners than children of people<br/>
&gt; without college degrees.  Then, I suppose I would provide them with a list<br/>
&gt; of references so that they could better inform themselves about home-based<br/>
&gt; learning.  I would invite them to contact me when they have felt they have<br/>
&gt; digested that information, and I would be available for discussion on the<br/>
&gt; subject, if they would like.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Absurd is right!  But, definitely misinformed!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t you also benifit by learning what you are teaching your children.<br/>
If  I don&#39;t know about something by children are intrested in or should know<br/>
at their age I will research it and find out as much as I can about it. It<br/>
is impossible to know everything about what intrests them anyway. So whats a<br/>
degrree about something neither you or they are intrested in going to help. </span></blockquote></div>
