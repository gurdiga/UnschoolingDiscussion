<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989068858">Hi Everyone,<br/>
I know this is off topic but...... I need some prayers . I need to quit <br/>
smoking . Im gonna try for Monday. This will be my second time . Last year I <br/>
went to the Drs and he said &quot;Tamie, some people can smoke all their lives and <br/>
never really show any problems. You are not one of them!!!&quot; I quit using the <br/>
patch the following Monday. I quit for 5 months and felt great. Then had an <br/>
arguement with my mom and let it go down the drain.(bad excuse , I know) Now <br/>
my chest hurts all the time and the cough is embarrasing. Im only 29 and <br/>
sound like 80!!! <br/>
Thanks Everyone<br/>
I would like to hear other peoples quitting stories , if there are any. I <br/>
think it will help to hear Im not the only one to screw it up after 5 months.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886872222">Tamie, you have my thoughts.  When dh and I got together, he <br/>
was a 40-a-day man.  Before we met, he&#39;d worked in a situation <br/>
where they couldn&#39;t smoke in the store, so at breaks he&#39;d have 5 <br/>
in 15 minutes.  Apparently one couldn&#39;t see across the smoking <br/>
room.  He started coughing one morning, I told him he sounded <br/>
like my dad.  He stopped.  (well, he finished the packet first...)  9-<br/>
and-a-half years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a thought...  take the money you would spend on cigs <br/>
(nearly said fags there...) and save it up, then treat yourself to a <br/>
splash-out shooping spree, or a meal out, or a party when u have <br/>
enough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295450752">HI, I was just lurking, and caught this post.... and it touched me <br/>
because I missed out on my grandfather because of smoking.  He died <br/>
shortly after I was born.  There is one picture of him holding me and <br/>
that&#39;s it, all I have.  My mom says he was such a nice man, I really <br/>
wish I had gotten to talk with him.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Smoking will get you eventually.  Quit so that you will be around to <br/>
hug your grandchildren. <br/>
