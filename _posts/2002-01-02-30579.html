Ever read &#39;Real Boys&#39;? I glanced at it quickly and left it at a relatives <br/>
a few years ago. But I think there&#39;s something in there for this!<br/>

ps. funny thing. At I had this conversation last year with someone in <br/>
r/l. His wife&#39;s name was Jean. HE said her messiness was a big part of <br/>
their divorce. So when I asked if there was a messy &#39;gene&#39;, he screamed <br/>
out YES! there is a messy &#39;jean&#39; and I married her!</div>
