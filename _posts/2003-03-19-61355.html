owner has even homeschooled her kids at various times, though not <br/>
unschooling.  I think it will be great.  At 87, Mom is the &quot;kid <br/>
sister&quot; to the other two current residents who are 95 and 100!<br/>
<br/>
Anybody near Sequim who wants to meet, let me know.  I&#39;ll be going <br/>
down approximately once a month from now on.  I always like meeting <br/>
my email friends.<br/>
<br/>
I came home to my office all torn apart.  Lars had decided to do the <br/>
reno I&#39;ve been wanting for a year or so now, and wasn&#39;t finished with <br/>
it.  He finished it last night, hooked me back up, and now I&#39;m <br/>
plowing through *some* of my email.  What a sweetie my son is.<br/>
