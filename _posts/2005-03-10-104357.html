<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046653688">We&#39;re just getting over a particularly nasty strain of flu. Beth got it,  <br/>
then Julian, then me. Julian got the sickest, with a fever of 103.5 at one  <br/>
point. Pain in the butt, unpleasant, but...<br/>
 <br/>
Julian is 15, and pretty independent. One of the sweetest things this week  <br/>
has been that I got to take care of this very big boy. I brought him juice and  <br/>
tasty foods to nibble on, medicine and the tv remote. I covered him up in a  <br/>
comforter, and took his temp and brought him a cool washcloth. When he was  <br/>
feeling particularly awful, he snuggled into me on the couch and fell  asleep.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s hard when your kid feels so sick, but so nice to be able to take care  <br/>
of him.<br/>
