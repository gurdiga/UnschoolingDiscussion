&gt; week..AFTER she&#39;s finished reading the book :-) :-P *Maybe* then, <br/>
&gt; she&#39;ll either read it and learn or she&#39;ll stop the harassment. It <br/>
&gt; will at least put you in a position to have something *to* discuss <br/>
&gt; other than misled opinions about what you&#39;re doing ~or~ she won&#39;t <br/>

out. She in my guess would read them and come out against them and my ideas <br/>
even stronger. She thinks Montessori and Waldorf theories on children reading <br/>
later (around 8 ) is pure bullshit. &lt;her words. Now these and other theories <br/>
supporting it are very old but to her have no ground. There are windows and <br/>
if I miss them I have screwed up my child. @@ <br/>

We have the &#39;same&#39; mother. No amount of reading or talking will <br/>
change her mind.<br/>
