<div id="ygrps-yiv-420383878">Math anxiety is so real on college campuses.  I went to Penn State and there were always signs up for Math Anxiety seminars, Math Anxiety counseling, Math Anxiety brown bag lunch talks.<br/>
<br/>
I felt too embarrassed to even go.  haha.  But I made it through basic college math and 9 credits of college statistics.<br/>
