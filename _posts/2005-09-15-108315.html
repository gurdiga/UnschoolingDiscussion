<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087689272">And how do you deal with it?<br/>
My kids LOVE to talk to adults, but 9 out of 10 adults that my kids talk to<br/>
get really annoyed and frustrated and are sometimes just rude.  It is almost<br/>
like these people don&#39;t think that children are worthy to talk to them.<br/>
That is how they act anyway.<br/>
How would you deal with that?  I don&#39;t want to tell my kids not to talk to<br/>
adults, but I find myself telling them to &quot;come here&quot; or &quot;go play&quot; because I<br/>
don&#39;t want them getting their feelings hurt or even thinking that that is<br/>
how adults are.<br/>
I am in serious need of suggestions or ideas.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563739422">Oh, yes. And I think it is exactly that people don&#39;t think children <br/>
are worthy to talk to. <br/>
<br/>
I start by recognizing that I am not likely to change the person&#39;s <br/>
attitude, certainly not by lecturing them. Having said that, I will <br/>
say &quot;Meredith is talking to you&quot; to my sister-in-law, who seems to <br/>
feel that my daughter should always wait until the adults are done <br/>
before chiming in.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, though, I focus on giving the respect of listening to my <br/>
daughter *myself*, by saying &quot;excuse me&quot; to the adult (if I was <br/>
involved in a conversation with him or her) and &quot;yes, Meredith? I&#39;d <br/>
like to hear what you have to say&quot;, or some such, to my daughter. I <br/>
refuse to allow the other adult to engage me until my daughter has <br/>
had a reasonable conversational turn.<br/>
<br/>
If it is someone I wasn&#39;t already talking to, I come over and say <br/>
something like &quot;it doesn&#39;t look like s/he is interested in talking <br/>
right now&quot; (loud enough for the adult to hear, for sure) and maybe <br/>
follow up with &quot;what was that you were saying about dinosaurs?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In private moments, I sometimes remind my daughter that if someone <br/>
is being rude to her, she doesn&#39;t have to have a conversation with <br/>
them. I&#39;ve gently said that some people aren&#39;t good at talking with <br/>
kids, and that it&#39;s more fun to talk to people who are.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, it really frosts me when people try to pretend she&#39;s not <br/>
even there. But there you have it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The reason I ask is because once a few years ago I was at the <br/>
library typing at the computer with my baby and two kids came up and <br/>
I guess were interested in the baby, then started talking to me.<br/>
<br/>
They told me they were homeschooled and chatted with me a little, <br/>
which I didn&#39;t mind at first. But the boy kept telling me all kinds <br/>
of details about his trading cards or something, and kept going on <br/>
and on even after I thought he was done and I would smile, nod, and <br/>
go back to typing. I had no idea who he was, his parents were <br/>
nowhere in sight, and I was trying to get something done. (He was <br/>
about ten or eleven.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should have politely dismissed him at some point, but <br/>
honestly, at the time I thought to myself, &quot;Gosh, do all <br/>
homeschooled kids walk up to total strangers and talk on and on <br/>
about themselves, and the parent does nothing to intervene?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that&#39;s probably not what you meant, though?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If they&#39;re just walking up to random strangers at parks and in stores and <br/>
starting conversations, you might help them figure out how to gauge whether <br/>
someone is iterested.   Have they been watching them and smiling at them?   <br/>
Inviting interaction with non-verbal clues?   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At a park, if someone says &quot;Nice bike!&quot; that&#39;s a possible moment for a return <br/>
comment.   If someone is reading a newspaper or a book, that is NOT a good <br/>
person to start up a chat with.    <br/>
<br/>
In a case in which it wouldn&#39;t be cool for an adult to start a conversation <br/>
with another person, it&#39;s not okay for a child to either.     Even if all <br/>
adults did see adults and children equally (which we know they don&#39;t), it&#39;s not <br/>
okay for adults to &quot;love to talk to adults&quot; in a non-discriminate way.    <br/>
<br/>
The other day Keith and I were going for a walk, and a police car stopped <br/>
right by us and the guy got out, right by a bike path that goes along a drainage <br/>
ditch by our house.   We didn&#39;t know he wasn&#39;t wanting to talk to us, but it <br/>
wasn&#39;t likely.   He was going to talk to a homeless guy who was up on the side <br/>
of the ditch against someone&#39;s back wall.   He knew his name and all.   Keith <br/>
and I were just happening to be there.   That was really NOT a good time to go <br/>
and get into the conversation.   We did   greet the policeman and he made a <br/>
friendly comment of some sort and then went to talk to the guy.   <br/>
<br/>
Would a child know that was a bad time to ask questions?   Would a child know <br/>
it wasn&#39;t a good time to say &quot;I&#39;m Sandra and this is my dog Gudrun?&quot;   (We <br/>
did have Gudrun with us, and she wasn&#39;t on a leash, but nobody in the situation <br/>
cared.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just rambling, I think; sorry.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly has gone to visit other houses and there&#39;s not a set time to come <br/>
home, I&#39;ve coached her to watch for clues that they&#39;re planning to do <br/>
something else as a family, or fixing dinner or something, and come home then, when <br/>
the climate seems to change.   She was good at that.   Some people are better at <br/>
it than others.   Maybe some parents don&#39;t think to suggest it.   <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
We were in the grocery store the other day, Will and I.  I was in the  peanut <br/>
butter aisle, choosing some (not Jif!  Ha, cultural  reference!).  There was <br/>
a woman in a service-worker&#39;s uniform (McDonalds or  something) up ahead.  She <br/>
was talking on her cell phone.  I had  my back to her and I wasn&#39;t paying any <br/>
attention to her, choosing pb, but I  could tell she was about to end her <br/>
phone call because of what she was saying  that I couldn&#39;t help but hear.  <br/>
 <br/>
I picked up the pb and then turned to walk up the aisle with Will.  In  one <br/>
breath the woman on the phone said, &quot;Okay, I love you, Bye!  Is school  out <br/>
today?&quot;, as she closed the phone.<br/>
 <br/>
I was taken aback....was she talking to us?  As I squeezed by her  cart, I <br/>
looked at her strangely, concluding that she was, indeed now talking to  us, and <br/>
I said, rather curtly, &quot;We don&#39;t believe in school.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Undaunted, she said, &quot;Oh, you must be homeschoolers!&quot; in a rather  demanding <br/>
way, like, &quot;you must engage me in conversation because I&#39;m manic and  can&#39;t <br/>
help myself.&quot;  By then I was a good 10 feet away from her and  widening the gap. <br/>
 I stopped, turned around, looked her in the eye and  said, &quot;School is for <br/>
losers.&quot;, then turned on my heel and walked away.<br/>
 <br/>
This woman was rude and talking inappropriately to someone she didn&#39;t know  <br/>
and asking personal questions.  She didn&#39;t have the courtesy to address me  or <br/>
let me know she was addressing me.  Just asked her question like we&#39;re  <br/>
supposed to be in her brain and bend to her wishes.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t actually believe school is for losers.  It&#39;s a joke Will and I  have. <br/>
 But I don&#39;t feel the need to be polite to someone so rude and answer  her <br/>
questions.  I&#39;d much rather her think I&#39;m crazy than have such a person  think <br/>
I&#39;m open to speaking with her just because she speaks to me.  If she  had gone <br/>
on, I would have said something less rude and more direct, such as &quot;I&#39;m  too <br/>
busy to talk.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve had experiences with kids who wanted to talk and talk, and I think  <br/>
there are lots of people who need to learn when enough is enough and when it&#39;s  <br/>
appropriate to speak, not just kids.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044829246">Well, for example, we were at the doctors office where my son gets his light<br/>
treatments.  He was talking to the nurse that was prepping him and one time<br/>
he told her about his pokemon cards and she said absolutely nothing with the<br/>
rolling eyes attitude, and another time he had asked her if she saw a movie<br/>
that he had just seen and she replied in a very condescending way that &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t watch cartoons&quot; and he said that it wasn&#39;t a cartoon and she replied<br/>
&quot;whatever&quot;.  I was so appalled that I didn&#39;t know what to say for once in my<br/>
life.  And he has to see her 3 times a week!  I really want to tell him just<br/>
to not talk to her cause she is rude, but I don&#39;t know what to say.<br/>
Another time we were at the park and he had been playing with this ladys<br/>
child and he went up to her and told her that he enjoyed her sons company<br/>
and she just looked at him with an annoyed smile on her face and turned<br/>
around and ignored him.<br/>
Those are just a couple of examples of this rudeness, though, unfortunately<br/>
there are many more!<br/>

You are right about being too busy with children carrying on, If I notice<br/>
one of my kids giving TMI, I do redirect them, cause I wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
subject an innocent bystander to the details of our lives!  But I guess I do<br/>

even considered talking to me like that if I were to say something to them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; homeschooled kids walk up to total strangers and talk on and on <br/>
&gt; about themselves, and the parent does nothing to intervene?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder why you did not just tell him you were busy, since you <br/>
were.  I have had this happen a lot of times with my dd, who also <br/>
loves to talk to adults.  Many adults will just look at me like I&#39;m <br/>
supposed to get my daughter to stop talking to them before they even <br/>
respond to her!  It&#39;s like they are scared to talk to a child - it&#39;s <br/>
really weird to me.  I talk to kids at the park a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s different if my dd is about to interrupt someone who&#39;s already <br/>
talking to someone else.  I will let her know that she shouldn&#39;t <br/>
interrupt, and if someone is rude or just won&#39;t answer her or make <br/>
eye contact, I&#39;ll tell her that I don&#39;t think they want to talk <br/>
right now.  But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with her <br/>
talking to an adult at the park who is not already talking and <br/>
obviously not doing anything but watching his/her kids play.  <br/>
<br/>
So many adults seem so uncomfortable when a kid talks to them.  More <br/>
than once, one or the other of my daughters has approached a person <br/>
at the park with a dog.  They are right there at the playground <br/>
where there are kids playing, and when dd asks if the dog is <br/>
friendly, they say NO or that the dog doesn&#39;t like kids/strangers or <br/>
whatever.  Then why bring the dog to sit by the playground?  Do most <br/>
adults just think that kids should never talk to them or that it is <br/>
somehow rude?  I don&#39;t get it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280706742">-=-she replied<br/>
&quot;whatever&quot;.  I was so appalled that I didn&#39;t know what to say for once in my<br/>
life.  And he has to see her 3 times a week!  I really want to tell him just<br/>
to not talk to her cause she is rude, but I don&#39;t know what to say.-=-<br/>
<br/>
In cases like that I&#39;ve just said &quot;I don&#39;t think she is around kids much and <br/>
she probably just can&#39;t think of anything good to say.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If he really wants to talk to her, maybe he could talk about the office, the <br/>
treatment, something current (does she have friends or relatives in New <br/>
Orleans, something...).   Asking her if she has kids or is married probably is way <br/>
too personal.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Rude&quot; isn&#39;t informative.   One person&#39;s rude is another person&#39;s boundary <br/>
maintenance.   Some people lack social skills.   Some have been wounded too many <br/>
times and have become bitter.   Some just had a dog die or something and are <br/>
distraught.   <br/>
<br/>
Our neighbor is rude to us, rude to our guests, rude to her husband, rude to <br/>
her dogs.   She&#39;s had two of her grown children die and a house burn down.   <br/>
So she went out to Keith&#39;s mom who was in town for surgery and said &quot;We don&#39;t <br/>
like for people to block our driveway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I saw her go out there to talk, and I knew she was messing with the wrong <br/>
fellow-old-lady. &lt;g&gt;   Keith&#39;s mom said &quot;Well that&#39;s fine, we&#39;re not blocking <br/>
your driveway.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
She was right.   The truck was just parked in front of their yard, and not <br/>
even NEAR the driveway.   I just stayed in the house where it was safe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But what I tell my kids and their friends is &quot;Don&#39;t park in front of Betty&#39;s <br/>
house because she gets cranky.&quot;   That&#39;s informational.   I don&#39;t say &quot;Betty&#39;s <br/>
rude.&quot;   And I&#39;ve told them, too, that Betty&#39;s life has been really hard, and <br/>
that might be why she&#39;s harsh with   others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069510974"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So many adults seem so uncomfortable when a kid<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that is a key point -- some adults just don&#39;t<br/>
feel comfortable talking to children.  It may be<br/>
simple to many of us, but for many adults, talking to<br/>
a child is very difficult.  My husband can talk with<br/>
his own children (or even nephews, nieces, etc.), but<br/>
if a child comes up that he does not know, he always<br/>
feels akward -- he doesn&#39;t not do well with making<br/>
conversation with them, and even if he just needs to<br/>
give a one sentence response, it&#39;s still hard for him.<br/>
 He would much rather talk to an adult (but he is<br/>
still a bit shy with adults too).<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, feel extremely comofortable<br/>
talking to just about any child.  Any age child can<br/>
walk up to me and I feel that I am friendly and<br/>
responsive to them -- I ask questions (if appropriate)<br/>
and listen to them. I&#39;ve often had child see me again<br/>
-- at the park, at the store, wherever -- and remember<br/>
me and be excited to see me.  I can talk to children<br/>
much easier than I can with adults.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t think it is okay for adults to be rude to<br/>
a child.  No matter how akward it is for my husband,<br/>
he isn&#39;t rude in my opinion, but it is in the eye<br/>
(ear?) of the beholder, so maybe he does appear rude<br/>
to the parents of these children.<br/>

<br/>
I like to talk, so I&#39;m not uncomfortable.  But some kids ARE hard to <br/>
understand.  One of my best friends has a kid who whispers and mumbles.  <br/>
His voice is much much quieter than an adult voice, and fairly far away <br/>
from the adult&#39;s ears (if they are both standing).  Also, normal <br/>
childish pronunciation can be hard to understand.  Families get <br/>
accustomed to it and can comprehend stuff that isn&#39;t likely to be clear <br/>
to a random stranger.  When that happens, that can be unconfortable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have been trying to get over my anxiety of talking to kids. It <br/>
helps that, when in the play area at the mall, I let my 1yo toddle <br/>
over to other adults and look at them, play with fancy colored things <br/>
on their shoes, and only intervene if he starts to get upset. I <br/>
figure, they are sitting in a kid&#39;s play area, they must have a kid <br/>
(either theirs, or one they are watching) in here, so someone trusted <br/>
them with a child and they came out in public with h**, so they can&#39;t <br/>
be too bad.<br/>
<br/>
My anxiety comes from growing up with the &quot;never talk to strangers&quot; <br/>
mentality. Just a few years ago, my mom got upset at my 19 y/o sister <br/>
giving a ride to another teenage girl she barely knew. &quot;You don&#39;t <br/>
give rides to other people&#39;s kids... you just don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think I realize now that *I* am the stranger, and I get afraid that <br/>
some mother will see me talking to their child, instantly think I&#39;m <br/>
some molester/kidnapper, and either call the cops on me, or at least, <br/>
use me as the &quot;scary older man&quot; in some lengthy discussion later on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen parents who went ballistic if you gave their kid ANY <br/>
sort of directive, order or discipline. Is the kid who is talking to <br/>
me decides to start climbing on something nearby (which kids do), am <br/>
I supposed to just watch if he falls or breaks something (since I&#39;m <br/>
not responsible for them) or tell them not to climb on it and get <br/>
reamed out by a parent who tells me their kid does that all the time <br/>
and never causes problems, and how dare I discipline their child...<br/>
<br/>
It comes down to, when a child talks to me, I feel like I am going to <br/>
be punished by their parents (in some way) for letting the kid talk <br/>
to me. I try to locate their parent and look for reassurance, but... <br/>
I sometimes think it&#39;s worse being a male and talking to a kid, that <br/>
people trust you less with their child, for whatever reason.<br/>

<br/>
This has never happened to me, but that could be because Jayn and I frequent<br/>
park days with home- and Un- schoolers pretty much exclusively now. Not only<br/>
does she know almost all the adults, but I know almost all the kids, by<br/>
sight at least. <br/>
<br/>
When I am with other kids, especially those who are not HS, and they do<br/>
something iffy, I will often say something like &quot;That is worrying me because<br/>
it looks a little unsafe. Would your mom be happy that you are doing that?&quot;<br/>
or &quot;I think we should check with your mom about whether she would want you<br/>
to have that cake.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think the answer is to introduce yourself to the other parents, and point<br/>
out the child that is yours, so that they know you are a genuine parent and<br/>
not some lurking predator. Many of the parks we attend have &quot;no adults<br/>
unaccompanied by children&quot; rules in the playground areas.<br/>

 <br/>
My husband has the same fear.  There&#39;s a girl across the street, about  12, <br/>
who is very forward and when you open the front door she just comes right  in.  <br/>
It is NOT a good idea for my husband to be alone at home when she does  that. <br/>
 There&#39;s no telling what she or her mother might accuse my husband  of, just <br/>
to get money or attention.  I think it&#39;s wise in that case for him  to be very <br/>
clear to her that she&#39;s not welcome if Will&#39;s not home.  It&#39;s  hard for her <br/>
to get the message!  Sometimes he calls out to her from the  front door when <br/>
she gets to the gate, and she STILL walks right into the  house!  I think it&#39;s <br/>
wise for him to be that way, and I&#39;ve asked her not to  do that, and to leave <br/>
Charles alone when he&#39;s at home alone because he&#39;s so  &quot;busy&quot;.  Still can&#39;t <br/>
trust her not to come right in, though.<br/>
 <br/>
But, in a toddler play area, I can guarantee you, Jason, that most of the  <br/>
mom&#39;s there have already checked out that you have a little kid there with you,  <br/>
and that puts you in the &quot;safe&quot; category.  <br/>
 <br/>
As far &quot;helping out&quot; with other kids and fearing mama-wrath....maybe try  <br/>
some different words.  Instead of directives, say &quot;Oh, that&#39;s so  HIGH!&quot;  Talk to <br/>
the kid in a way you would like to be spoken to if you were  trying something <br/>
daring or dangerous.  Would you want encouragement or  warnings?  Talk only <br/>
to the ones who stumble into your personal space, and  introduce them to your <br/>
kid. <br/>
 <br/>
My husband suffers the same discomfort.  I feel for ya!<br/>

&gt;not<br/>
&gt;okay for adults to &quot;love to talk to adults&quot; in a non-discriminate  way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;~~~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We were in the grocery store the other day, Will and I.  I was in the  <br/>
&gt;peanut<br/>
&gt;butter aisle, choosing some (not Jif!  Ha, cultural  reference!).  There <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;a woman in a service-worker&#39;s uniform (McDonalds or  something) up ahead.  <br/>
&gt;She<br/>
&gt;was talking on her cell phone.  I had  my back to her and I wasn&#39;t paying <br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt;attention to her, choosing pb, but I  could tell she was about to end her<br/>
&gt;phone call because of what she was saying  that I couldn&#39;t help but hear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I picked up the pb and then turned to walk up the aisle with Will.  In  one<br/>
&gt;breath the woman on the phone said, &quot;Okay, I love you, Bye!  Is school  out<br/>
&gt;today?&quot;, as she closed the phone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was taken aback....was she talking to us?  As I squeezed by her  cart, I<br/>
&gt;looked at her strangely, concluding that she was, indeed now talking to  <br/>
&gt;us, and<br/>
&gt;I said, rather curtly, &quot;We don&#39;t believe in school.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Undaunted, she said, &quot;Oh, you must be homeschoolers!&quot; in a rather  <br/>
&gt;demanding<br/>
&gt;way, like, &quot;you must engage me in conversation because I&#39;m manic and  can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;help myself.&quot;  By then I was a good 10 feet away from her and  widening the <br/>
&gt;gap.<br/>
&gt;  I stopped, turned around, looked her in the eye and  said, &quot;School is for<br/>
&gt;losers.&quot;, then turned on my heel and walked away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This woman was rude and talking inappropriately to someone she didn&#39;t know<br/>
&gt;and asking personal questions.  She didn&#39;t have the courtesy to address me  <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;let me know she was addressing me.  Just asked her question like we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;supposed to be in her brain and bend to her wishes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t actually believe school is for losers.  It&#39;s a joke Will and I  <br/>
&gt;have.<br/>
&gt;  But I don&#39;t feel the need to be polite to someone so rude and answer  her<br/>
&gt;questions.  I&#39;d much rather her think I&#39;m crazy than have such a person  <br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m open to speaking with her just because she speaks to me.  If she  had <br/>
&gt;gone<br/>
&gt;on, I would have said something less rude and more direct, such as &quot;I&#39;m  <br/>
&gt;too<br/>
&gt;busy to talk.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve had experiences with kids who wanted to talk and talk, and I think<br/>
&gt;there are lots of people who need to learn when enough is enough and when <br/>
&gt;it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;appropriate to speak, not just kids.<br/>

know people generally mean well, but it seems like an awfully<br/>
personal <br/>
question to me. They have no idea if he is my son, if is father is in <br/>
the picture or i even know who he is, if he is adopted, and yet they <br/>
ask these questions right out there in the open, while shopping. Very <br/>
weird. Usually i&#39;m nice about it, and say &quot;Oh you know those<br/>
recessive <br/>
genes....we had no idea that great grandparents on both sides were <br/>
redheads!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seamus new little cousin has red hair just the color of seamus&#39;, and <br/>
he told her &quot;just wait, you are gonna get asked &quot;where&#39;d you get that <br/>
read hair&quot; ALL the time growing up so be prepared!!!&quot; Too cute. The <br/>
good thing is that despite all the public attention, Seamus likes <br/>
having red hair, and LOVES his freckles even more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269680584">We have two red heads. We get the &quot;Where&#39;d you get the red hair&quot; every<br/>
day of our lives.<br/>
<br/>
My son always replies: &quot;My mom ate spaghetti while she was pregnant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter says, &quot;We&#39;re Irish.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter thinks it&#39;s criminal that red heads aren&#39;t allowed to dye<br/>
their hair another color. Any time she brings it up to friends, they<br/>
say, &quot;Oh you can&#39;t dye your hair. It&#39;s red! It&#39;s such a lovely color.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So she dyed her tips black last year (the bottom six inches). :)<br/>
<br/>
Red heads also seem to collect around each other. My daughter has had<br/>
four best best friends over her 16 years and three of them have been<br/>
red heads. She meets them in lines, she talks to them at stores...<br/>
it&#39;s like they are drawn to each other.<br/>
<br/>
My red headed son&#39;s best friend is also a red head. Amazing.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are brunettes.<br/>

basic human behavior.   How would we act without all our cultural overlays, <br/>
without so many clothes on, if we had a natural way to be?<br/>
<br/>
It might not make you feel better, but some people touch pregnant women&#39;s <br/>
bellies.   Some ask first.   <br/>
<br/>
It seems there must be some grooming or learning thing going on with the <br/>
desire to touch unusual features.<br/>

is: Daddy on the outside, Mommy on the inside &lt;bg&gt;  Hannah was VERY dark <br/>
when she was born, the nurses kept looking at her then at Mitch, then <br/>
ominously warned me: &quot;kids get darker, ya know&quot; -- like what?? we should <br/>
put her back?? give her up to darker skinned parents??  HA! She got <br/>
*lighter* but is still far more tan than I ever hope to be &lt;bg&gt;  It&#39;s <br/>
often assumed that Hayden looks like me, because we have the same skin <br/>
tone... actually, he looks *exactly* like my mother-in-law, just far, <br/>
far lighter (same chocolate brown eyes &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
