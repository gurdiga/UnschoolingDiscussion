<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632370376">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching some TED videos lately and I find some very interesting;<br/>
thought provoking talks.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I loved Jane McGonigal about Gaming can make a better world<br/>

My point is, it would be nice to have a real unschooling voice out there on<br/>
TED. Sandra; would you be up for it? Or Pam? There is a form for anybody to<br/>
fill to nominate a speaker:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/nominate/speaker">http://www.ted.com/nominate/speaker</a> We could spread the word in the<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Claire.<br/>
<br/>
Theresa Larson nominated me in May because a TED session was being organized in Albuquerque.  So I filled in the online forms and got a couple of e-mails back but wasn&#39;t chosen.  That&#39;s really fine with me. I think (but am not positive) that it involves memorizing a talk and presenting it that way, word for word.   That&#39;s not a skill I have, learning a script like that.  They coach the people they choose.  So maybe someday.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m pretty content doing what I&#39;m doing, with Just Add Light and Stir every day, an online chat on Wednesdays, tootling around responding to online discussions, and speaking here and there now and then.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m flattered that you think it would be cool, though. :-)<br/>
There are good ideas there, and unschoolers can learn from all that without there being specifically unschoolers in there.<br/>
<br/>
I think Blake Boles might&#39;ve been working on one, or planning to.  He wasn&#39;t unschooled, but he&#39;s fascinated by and hanging out with unschoolers. :-)  He&#39;s also young and good looking.  <br/>

for you, that might help them see...<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the very limited time you have, ie: the whole talk is under 20<br/>
minutes, or even 10 minutes, you really need to craft the talk very<br/>
meticulously. It&#39;s good that they give coaching help.<br/>

I was fascinated by the process that happened with the TEDX event here last year. I talked with several of the speakers on our break, and one of them told me how helpful the coaching had been. Here&#39;s his talk:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TEDxCharlotte#p/u/17/4d7hAU9p11Y">http://www.youtube.com/user/TEDxCharlotte#p/u/17/4d7hAU9p11Y</a><br/>
<br/>
He said he had really been unsure of what the &quot;theme&quot; of his talk should be, and the coach asked him questions about how the public interacted with his work, and how the communities where his art was built were affected. If you watch his talk, you can see that&#39;s the main thrust of his speech: the community created and affected as his art is created. He said it gave him a whole new perspective on his art that he hadn&#39;t had before. I *love* that synergy and give-and-take. <br/>
<br/>
I do think being chosen for a local TEDX event is easier than being chosen for the main TED event; many of the speakers at the main event began by speaking locally. The speakers at the event here, even the ones who had not spoken publicly very much, all did a great job, because of the support available to them - and, of course, because of being inspired by what they were speaking about!<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a TEDX event in your town, or close to you, I encourage you to apply to attend! The whole thing was inspiring, and what was very interesting to me, is that most people attending here in Charlotte that I spoke to GOT an understanding of unschooling right away, even if they had never heard of it - unlike many people that I mention it to. The folks at the TEDX talk were enthused by it, and saw the possibilities in it.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the most popular TED talks, they are not all young good-looking speakers - this is one group that seems more focused on the message, rather than the messenger!<br/>
<br/>
Although, Sandra - I do think you&#39;re lovely!<br/>
