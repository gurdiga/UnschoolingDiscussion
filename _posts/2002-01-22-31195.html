-------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Karen Elizabeth Gordon is no ordinary grammarian, and her works (including<br/>
The New Well-Tempered Sentence, Torn Wings and Faux Pas, and The Disheveled<br/>
Dictionary)--are no ordinary books of grammar. A special edition of the 1984<br/>
classic, The Deluxe Transitive Vampire is populated by a wickedly decadent<br/>
cast of gargoyles, mastodons, murderous debutantes, and, yes, vampires (both<br/>
transitive and otherwise), who cavort and consort in order to illustrate<br/>
basic principles of grammar. The sentences are intoxicating--&quot;How he loved<br/>
to dangle his participles, brush his forelock off his forehead with his<br/>
foreleg, and gaze into the aqueous depths&quot;--but the rules and their<br/>
explanations are as sound as any you might find in Strunk and White.<br/>
Outlining the building blocks of the English language, from parts of speech<br/>
to phrases and clauses, The Deluxe Transitive Vampire goes on to exorcise<br/>
such grammatical demons as passive voice, fragments, comma splices, and<br/>
run-on sentences. At last, a handbook of grammar you will actually want to<br/>
read. In the words of Gordon&#39;s preface, &quot;Howling, exploding, crackling,<br/>
flickering with new life-forms, and drunk on fresh blood (some of mine is<br/>
certainly missing), this deluxe edition reminds us on every page that words,<br/>
too, have hoofs and wings to transport us far and deep.&quot;<br/>

And there are *lots* of interesting resources like this for *every* subject.<br/>
Dry, boring textbooks just aren&#39;t necessary.  For kids who like to read,<br/>
they can learn what they need to by reading books like this.<br/>
