<div id="ygrps-yiv-756589214"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;You know what?  I have often counseled other mothers who are overwhelmed <br/>
&gt;&gt;and feeling trapped in no-ville that they should find a way to say yes to <br/>
&gt;&gt;whatever their kids want at any given moment.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great counselling! :o) And when you start saying yes, you realize how <br/>
arbitrary those &quot;no&#39;s&quot; really were.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;When my oldest children were little, Dad would take them for a couple of <br/>
&gt;&gt;weeks at a time.  (I was single then, and he was giving me a break.)  He <br/>
&gt;&gt;always reported that they behaved perfectly and were happy and had a good <br/>
&gt;&gt;time.  They always came back completely centered and content.  He said <br/>
&gt;&gt;that was because he resolved when my eldest was born to never say &quot;no&quot; to <br/>
&gt;&gt;his grandchildren&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What a cool dad/granndpa! I have a similar experience with one of Casey&#39;s <br/>
friends. She&#39;s so used to tagging along with her mom and big sister&#39;s stuff. <br/>
She so used to be told no. I just try to let her get what she wants to do at <br/>
my house, even if it makes a mess, or uses up supplies, or whatever. This <br/>
kid is a doll! Never a moments  trouble for me. Helpful, cheerful, <br/>
agreeable, flexible. All the things her mom complains about.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624870476">Thank you so much for this conversation!  I&#39;ve just had 2 1/2 hours of NO <br/>
with my kids and needed to hear your advice...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list and have been reading for a while.  My kids just turned 4 <br/>
and 3 a few weeks ago, my husband and I are both firmly committed to <br/>
unschooling.  We live in Illinois, so have none of the restrictive laws and <br/>
reporting requirements I&#39;ve been reading about.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got to go kiss them and tell them yes before they drift off to sleep.  <br/>
It&#39;s nap time.<br/>
