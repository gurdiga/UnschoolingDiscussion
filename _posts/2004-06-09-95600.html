I know you have had some great suggestions for making a sling, and someone<br/>
offered you a Maya Sling, but I have a wonderful neutral colored New Native<br/>
sling, sized medium, that you can have if you want.  Just another option!  I<br/>
just loved using it for my last baby. I wore him quite a bit and it always<br/>
calmed him.  It was light, and I could move him around to the back when he<br/>
was asleep, which was really great for being able to have arms free for my<br/>
other children or for doing dishes/cooking, etc... Plus, it was even more<br/>
comfortable wearing him on my back. I&#39;ve been using the Ergo Baby Carrier<br/>
since Evan was able to sit up on his own and he started to<br/>
dislike being so wrapped up, so I don&#39;t really need the sling anymore.<br/>
<br/>
