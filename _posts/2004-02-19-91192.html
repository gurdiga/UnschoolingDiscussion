<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124026693">My daughter, Lanora, is looking for an email list for unschooled kids.  She is 13 and really wants to meet more kids who come from the same mindset and freedom that she has.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve heard at least one such type of list mentioned here but couldn&#39;t find it by searching the web.  If someone could help point us in the right direction it would be much appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062777886">I made a list for my children in mind to meat with other home schooled<br/>
children. It is not specifically for unschoolers. It is for children who<br/>
learn at home.<br/>
It is moderated by me and the parent has to send me a letter that they want<br/>
their children signed up. This way we could screen unwanted people on the<br/>
list.<br/>
The list is quite now but I think because we have not many children on<br/>
board.<br/>
