<div id="ygrps-yiv-700019757">This was REALLY really clear.  You&#39;re so good at clear!!!<br/>
<br/>
I disagree about buddhists to some extent.  There are some who can&#39;t separate <br/>
abortion from religion, nor diet from religion.  But in the <br/>
American-discussion-list-unschooling context, yes you&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
This especially was crystaline:<br/>
-=-Discussing abortion -- or age of the earth, or family<br/>
structure, or environmentalism, or just about anything else! -- with a<br/>
fundamentalist Christian is discussing religion.-=-<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this is perhaps the crux of the problem for many people. If a Hindu or<br/>
pagan or even a nonfundamentalist Christian shares how their beliefs are<br/>
incorporated into their lives then it comes across as no different than<br/>
someone sharing how their culture is incorporated into their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the sharing of other religions comes across differently to<br/>
fundamentalist Christians. I&#39;ve heard the grousing from fundamentalists that<br/>
other religions can share but (fundamentalist) Christians can&#39;t so maybe to<br/>
fundamentalists it feels like other religions are being shoved at them.<br/>
<br/>
But the huge difference is that other religions don&#39;t have the mandate to<br/>
proselytize. People of other religions are just sharing what their life<br/>
looks like with no pressure to help people see how their way of life is<br/>
right and the rest of the world is wrong. They don&#39;t have a mandate to tell<br/>
other people what decisions they should be making about their lives or<br/>
thoughts the Buddhist is no different than discussing it with<br/>
a Jew. They may each look to their religions for help on clarifying their<br/>
thoughts but the conclusions they come to are not dictated by their<br/>
religious teachings. Discussing abortion -- or age of the earth, or family<br/>
structure, or environmentalism, or just about anything else! -- with a<br/>
fundamentalist Christian is discussing religion. The views come straight<br/>
from the Bible. (Often with quotes!) That&#39;s not a criticism. It just is as<br/>
it is.<br/>
<br/>
The viewpoint of a Hindu is not a Hindu viewpoint. A viewpoint of a<br/>
fundamentalist Christian *is* a Christian viewpoint. They are one and the<br/>
same so any discussion that is based on Biblical viewpoints is going to look<br/>
a lot like proselytizing to many people.<br/>
<br/>
So the general feeling that Christians can&#39;t speak up is pretty accurate.<br/>
I&#39;m not seeing a way around that because the viewpoint of a fundamentalist<br/>
is a religious viewpoint. Well, one way around it is for someone to give up<br/>
their fundamentalist beliefs so they can express a nonreligious viewpoint! I<br/>
suspect that&#39;s not a trade most fundamentalists want to make.<br/>
<br/>
Now if someone wants to discuss how to reconcile fundamentalist Christianity<br/>
with unscholing, that&#39;s within the paramaters of an unschooling list. But<br/>
it&#39;s a nonreligious list and religion of any kind can&#39;t be a foundation for<br/>
decisons on what unschooling is or dictate how it&#39;s discussed.<br/>

&lt;&lt; okay, this may seem like an odd question, but does anyone else unschool <br/>
 religion? (unchurch?)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well.....we don&#39;t go to church if that&#39;s what you mean.<br/>
I am thinking about doing the Unity church some, I like their philosophies.<br/>
But we &quot;do&quot; our spirituality at home....talk about different beliefs and what <br/>
not but don&#39;t try to make our kids believe like us. <br/>
I do a lot of soul searching and questioning of beliefs and I share that with <br/>
my children.<br/>
When they question, I don&#39;t pretend to have the answers. I share different <br/>
viewpoints with them and what I personally believe to be true.<br/>
I think that&#39;s unchurching basically....or unschooling religion.<br/>
My children choose, that&#39;s the bottom line.<br/>
