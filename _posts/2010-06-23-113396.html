<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619877278">So THIS is the place where discussion happens.  :)<br/>
I joined a couple of other unschooling lists, and they are just so quiet.<br/>
Hi everyone, I&#39;m Jenn- SAHM to four wonderful people, wife to a Navy man.  Oldest is a teen,  youngest will be 5 in a couple of weeks.  <br/>
I feel like I&#39;m finally &#39;growing up&#39;. After years of feeling like a failure for NOT doing traditional school-at-home, after trying to MAKE myself use curricula, trying to do co-ops and such, I feel so free to do what feels right to me/us now.  I forget how important positive input is.  I used to be a fundie Christian, now I&#39;m an atheist.  I remember joining unschooling lists before but was &#39;scared away&#39; by all the &#39;extreme&#39; teen talk, and I remember seeing things as &#39;unparenting&#39;.  So I&#39;m slow, but eventually I &#39;get it&#39;.  :-)<br/>
I&#39;m embracing REAL life, letting go of other peoples expectations, and I am HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
I just want to thank everyone who puts themselves &#39;out there&#39; for folks like me to find.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually it&#39;s the place where discussion used to happen! :-) The  <br/>
archives are *huge*. And it can happen if someone brings up a question  <br/>
since there are loads of people still signed onto the list. But if  <br/>
someone is looking for lists where they can read ongoing discussions:<br/>

<br/>
(Do be aware that the lists get much quieter over the summer and on  <br/>
weekends.)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to check on a Yahoo Group&#39;s activity level before you  <br/>
join, go to the homepage and scroll down to the calendar like chart.  <br/>
It will show how many posts there are each month.<br/>
<br/>
And welcome! :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763017473">Welcome to the list Jenn :) It&#39;s an incredibly rewarding feeling when you<br/>
realize you&#39;re finally following a path you feel you were meant to travel,<br/>
no matter how many detours you take along the way. Besides, the detours are<br/>
usually where you find the most adventures!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

Doh!  Bad news.  This one is very quiet too, but there is another one  <br/>
that&#39;s recently pretty busy, if you&#39;re interested:<br/>

(I&#39;m a moderator on this list, so I give myself permission to direct  <br/>
people elsewhere.... maybe stay on this list too, because occasionally  <br/>
it perks up, and if you want to start a topic here, there will be  <br/>
people around to respond!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263273815">Yes, Doh! is right.  I saw the dates for the most recent posts after I<br/>
posted that little &#39;intro&#39;.<br/>
Anyway, I still say THANK YOU all for being &#39;out there&#39;.  :-)<br/>
I&#39;m joining the other lists too now.  Thanks for the direction.<br/>
