<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889273092">Caused extensive bruising and something else, I don&#39;t remember what.  They<br/>
still use them for some multiple shots for adults but generally don&#39;t use<br/>
them on children anymore.<br/>

Yes, these are still used in the Military, when my husband went overseas <br/>
while in the Marines, he was given all of his shots this way! He is a big <br/>
solid guy, arms are all muscle and he had huge bruises!  Those &quot;air gun&quot; <br/>
types are horrid! <br/>
