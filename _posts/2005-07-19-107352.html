You were a longterm babysitter.<br/>

Did they give you any money with this, to buy food or ANYthing?<br/>

didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
POOR THING, she had been totally lied to and about, as though she weren&#39;t a <br/>
sentient being, as though she&#39;d never find out, or ask, or care, or figure out. <br/>
   How will she ever trust her parents again?<br/>
<br/>
-=-We got in the car and I tried to talk with her more about what she<br/>
had just said.  (What a revelation!)  But she took out her iPod and<br/>
put the earphones in--ending any conversation we could have had.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
She probably was too embarrassed to discuss it further, especially in front <br/>
of the younger girls.<br/>
<br/>
This story is sad but enlightening, and I hope Noelle&#39;s time with you makes a <br/>
difference in the way she parents any children she might have.     At least <br/>
she was able to articulate her frustration.   That&#39;s pretty good for a kid with <br/>
that much reason to be in denial and confusion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123143268">Linda, I think you gave Noelle the best chance ever to<br/>
see there is another way.  Don&#39;t underestimate the<br/>
effect you have had, maybe even on her parents a<br/>
little.<br/>
<br/>
How heartbreaking to see someone so discounted, so<br/>
dismissed.  Many of us grew up the same way and that<br/>
daily struggle to act from love, not habit, can<br/>
sometimes be overwhelming.  But think how much better<br/>
the whole world would be if everyone at least tried!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to give her a hug, too.  I&#39;m sure you helped<br/>
her more than you know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, Sandra, I was amazed that Noelle can still think, at times, so <br/>
clearly and so well.  It was encouraging to see her make these <br/>
connections and express her feelings.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing she told me sticks with me, she said, &quot;I&#39;m not easygoing.  <br/>
My brother is but not me.  I&#39;m difficult and I like things the way I <br/>
want them.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My older daughter Sarah is kind of like that so we made that <br/>
comparison.  What I really think is that Noelle&#39;s stubborn nature <br/>
and her inability to be easygoing will help her get through the next <br/>
4 years or until she leaves home.  Her true self just seems to <br/>
scream out even when she is forced to do something she doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to do.  And her parents don&#39;t seem to have a clue as to how to <br/>
celebrate and encourage her the way she is.<br/>
<br/>
And no, they didn&#39;t give me any money--except to pay us back for the <br/>
fee the airline charged to change her flight.</div>
