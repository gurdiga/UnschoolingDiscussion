<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648799783">I&#39;m sorry, there have been so many posts over the past couple of days <br/>
that I lost track of the OP.  Anyway, there was a question posed about <br/>
unschooling and having some kids who had never spoken a word being <br/>
dropped off on an island and if left with books they wouldn&#39;t be able <br/>
to read them.  You all gave some great responses but the following <br/>
threw me for a loop....<br/>
<br/>
I think it was Ren who posted that they wouldn&#39;t be able to learn to <br/>
speak and a couple of more people agreed.  This kind of shocked me <br/>
coming from ya&#39;ll radical homeschoolers!  ROFL...  Afterall, hey, <br/>
maybe they wouldn&#39;t call a tree a tree but who would we be to say <br/>
that &quot;ugh-uh-buga&quot; isn&#39;t speaking?  KWIM?  <br/>
<br/>
Just food for thought.<br/>

Yes, you are right. Language of some sort would evolve---especially if there were more than just one child dropped off. <br/>
 <br/>
But it would be *highly* unlikely &lt;g&gt; that the language spoken would be English!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333437638">Goodness, forgot to say my whole point was that being that it is a <br/>
natural desire for humans to learn, I am sure that they would come up <br/>
with ways to communicate, be it a sound for a specific thing or type <br/>
of movement, perhaps drawing.  For instance: &quot;bwogha&quot; may sound like a <br/>
silly noise to us, but to humans left alone on an island, never having <br/>
been around another language before, in their language &quot;bwogha&quot; might <br/>
be what they come up with and others learn as passed down to mean <br/>
water.  They wouldn&#39;t learn our language but they certainly would <br/>
naturally come up with one of their own. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841604801">Hi<br/>
   on a serious note children who have not heard human speech by a <br/>
certain age fail to develop it. There have been quite a few published <br/>
studies of children who have been neglected or abandoned and had no or <br/>
extremely limited human contact, they don&#39;t learn to speak.<br/>
<br/>
However it appears there have not been any cases of several children <br/>
being abandoned together so no one knows for sure if they would <br/>
develop their own rudimentary language or not.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth pointing out that these children could not be &#39;taught&#39; how <br/>
to speak either.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s entirely different to unschooling and late readers etc as they <br/>
are exposed to text and written language all the time. It&#39;s the <br/>
exposure that counts not the teaching.<br/>

at one time or another started somewhere.  Even if it is a sound, to <br/>
one who has never heard language before, even if it took 50 years to <br/>

I thought the example was one human.<br/>

A group of raw humans (from infancy, some theoretical batch of <br/>
abandoned-on-safe-island-infants) would eventually learn to read too, wouldn&#39;t they?   <br/>
Otherwise, how did so many different writing systems evolve on earth?   &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183450480">When my partner was studying linguistics, children who were abandoned <br/>
in the wild or confined without regular human contact were regularly <br/>
discussed for what they reveal about language acquisition. Children who <br/>
do not have human contact don&#39;t acquire language and usually can&#39;t once <br/>
they&#39;re discovered. A girl named Genie was the most recent <br/>
highly-publicized case I&#39;m aware of; she was confined by her family <br/>
with almost no human contact until she was 13. The details are <br/>
harrowing so I won&#39;t say more. But here is a link to some information <br/>
about language acquisition in feral children for interested folks: <br/>
