<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749835948"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; My husband just said:well,ya know not developing everyday,<br/>
&gt; &gt; longterm friendships. He said he was in the first grade with<br/>
&gt; &gt; Jimmy matthews and in the 2nd grade with Jimmy Mattews.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; what do i say to that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, did he like Jimmy Matthews? What if Jimmy Matthews was a bully and had it in for your kid and your kid had to deal with him in first grade, second grade, third grade....etc. And where is Jimmy Matthews now? <br/>
<br/>
I have one friend currently that I also knew in grade school. Although, we attended the same schools from k to senior year, we didnt become close until late high school and then afterwards. Her &quot;best&quot; friend all thru high school suddenly stopped talking to her a few years ago. My best high school friend wasnt even all that nice and we email occasionally, but I dont think either of us are interested in actually getting together in person.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband says something like that, I try to find out what the underlying concern really is. Or even just saying it back to him so he knows  I heard him. <br/>
So to the question above, I&#39;d say something like...&quot;so you are concerned he wont make friends&quot;<br/>
and see what he says. If he kept going in that directions, I&#39;d say, &quot;yes, lets pay attention to that and see what happens and how we can help him meet kids. Do you  have any ideas?&quot;<br/>
