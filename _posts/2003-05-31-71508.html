What I mean is I have a Portfolio review and I have to &quot;show&quot; progress over <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799258164">We live in PA so I have to do a portfolio too. As much as I hate to think in &quot;subjects&quot; I&#39;m not sure how we can avoid it with the overbearing paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
I keep a transcript by subjects, and then just jot down what they&#39;ve done that would fall into those subject categories.<br/>
<br/>
Then, when I need papers to back up the transcript, I either look up websites we&#39;ve used and print them, or I find websites with similar content that we &quot;covered&quot; (talked about, went on field trips, stayed up late to play games, etc) and print them.  <br/>
<br/>
I also keep a list of books and other resources we&#39;ve used.<br/>
<br/>
Most people in PA turn in a daily log of instruction.  I don&#39;t do that anymore.  Whether or not its actually required by law is debatable but there is no court precedent either way.  I haven&#39;t turned one in in 2 years.<br/>

    First off relax. ;-) I know it&#39;s easier said than done.<br/>
Where are you again?<br/>
<br/>
    I make a list of computer, board, & vidio games we&#39;ve played that the<br/>
kids and I can remember. I take my calandar that has a lot of trips, groups,<br/>
play dates, and art,swim and gym, etc on it. Sometimes I make some note on<br/>
the daily pages. You could make a scapebook or if that&#39;s not your style it&#39;s<br/>
ok. I don&#39;t. Take ticket stubs, pictures, flyers, handouts, etc. I use the<br/>
box method. I put things in a box all year. Take pictures you have. Some of<br/>
the things your kids have made. Game scoring. Writings of any kind. Penpals,<br/>
cheat codes, stories, notes, etc. Notes of books read or like I do library<br/>
slips. I sometimes explain math stuff on paper to give a visual for me.;-)<br/>
Like this year we talked about place value. I needed a visual so I could<br/>
keep track. <br/>
<br/>
    Remember this is just a sampling of your year. Maybe something from the<br/>
begining of the year and then the end. The most important part is talking to<br/>
your reviewer. Seeing what they expect to see and that your ideas and theirs<br/>
mesh.<br/>
<br/>
    In our review it was more important to the reviewer to talk to the kids<br/>
and me than what we brought. I prompted the kids to think about things they<br/>
wanted to show her and talk about. Kinda a show and tell. My youngest(8yo)<br/>
took some Lego he made freehand. Jonathan (13) basically talked and had a<br/>
great conversation with her. She trusts us as parents to know our kids. The<br/>
paper she signs states that our child(ren) are working up to their<br/>
potential. <br/>
<br/>
    Try to have fun with it Laura. You may find a new friend in your<br/>
reviewer. Even more friend for your kids. Our reviewer is a hs Mom too. It&#39;s<br/>
nice to *socialize* with her. LOL!<br/>

The 2nd worst HS laws in the nation (after PA) are NY&#39;s. This Sept I <br/>
start the paperwork as well and your tips sound quite good to me.<br/>

I am totally blank.  I have been making lists but when it come to showing <br/>
progress all I can do is tell her.  I dont have sheets of paper for math and so <br/>
on we dont do that. Maybe a question here or there but I never save doodles.<br/>
He went to a few movies, monster trucks stores, friends, snowboarding, <br/>
surfing. All I have is ticket stubs from two of them.<br/>
As far as Art I am blank. He drew some Sponge Bob today but how do I show <br/>
progress if nothing prior to today. You know my only hope for the year was that <br/>
he would read more and our family would come closer and we did.  <br/>

    Sounds like you&#39;re good to go. :-) Also sounds like the group setting<br/>
may help you. If you don&#39;t get to freaked out with what the others have. Try<br/>
your hardest to not compare. Will it be you each individually talk to her?<br/>
    Earmark the pages that you like the most in your journal. The math can<br/>
be done that way too. That is the games list. We don&#39;t do worksheets. I<br/>
don&#39;t do that either. Telling her is good. Movies have a lot of value.<br/>
Monster truck stores. Sounds like math, science, history, art, social<br/>
studies, etc to me. You can do it! you can pull out whatever you need from<br/>
whatever you have there. You are prepared. Trust in yourself and your kids.<br/>
You&#39;ve accomplished your goals and desires. That&#39;s what&#39;s important.<br/>
    If it doesn&#39;t come out that way you want. Look for another reviewer. You<br/>
have time on your side. Anyone hav ea link to a teacher- ese site? Here&#39;s<br/>
one I got from another list I used to be on. It may help you work it out in<br/>
your head. ;-)<br/>

I needed that big time. I have been soo stressed this weekend.<br/>
I went to a couple of sites and they kept referring to worksheets. I was like <br/>
NICE!<br/>
Then I got thinking this am that I will have him whip out a few wkshts just <br/>
to make them happy but then I said screw that!<br/>
<br/>
I know what we are doing is helping him grow into a fine young man. Has had a <br/>
great year.<br/>
Who knows maybe I am on the rad side of things but I hate the fact that I <br/>
have to show anyone progress. I am fully responsible for his life and really <br/>
cannot stand having ANYONE tell me what i HAVE to do!<br/>
<br/>
I used to be a follower and just did what I was told to do but the older I <br/>
get the more I test the boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
You know its like I know where he is at. I have free testing from Sylvan <br/>
forever for him BUT I dont think I should have to mail it out to them. They <br/>
require the testing/Portfolio but you can black out the scores so why bother, I dont <br/>
get it? It would have been easier to test him but I didn&#39;t want to do that to <br/>
him right now he is one a roll and I didn&#39;t want to put any pressure on him.<br/>
<br/>
I just told the hubby I want to go move to some really remote area, live off <br/>
the land, maybe build a yurt (is that the name) and get away. I said am I <br/>
going through a mid life crisis he says ahh yeah I think so. Though he says he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind most of it. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

Really if you think about it, the standards are written like it&#39;s <br/>
something special, but the real goal is for a person who&#39;s a year older, <br/>
