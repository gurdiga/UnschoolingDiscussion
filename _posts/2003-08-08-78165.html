ripple. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ripple<br/>
<br/>
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine<br/>
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung,<br/>
Would you hear my voice come thru the music,<br/>
Would you hold it near as it were your own?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken,<br/>
Perhaps they&#39;re better left unsung.<br/>
I don&#39;t know, don&#39;t really care<br/>
Let there be songs to fill the air.<br/>
<br/>
Ripple in still water,<br/>
When there is no pebble tossed,<br/>
Nor wind to blow.<br/>
<br/>
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty,<br/>
If your cup is full may it be again,<br/>
Let it be known there is a fountain,<br/>
That was not made by the hands of men.<br/>
<br/>
There is a road, no simple highway,<br/>
Between the dawn and the dark of night,<br/>
And if you go no one may follow,<br/>
That path is for your steps alone.<br/>
<br/>
Ripple in still water,<br/>
When there is no pebble tossed,<br/>
Nor wind to blow.<br/>
<br/>
But if you fall you fall alone,<br/>
If you should stand then who&#39;s to guide you?<br/>
If I knew the way I would take you home.<br/>
<br/>
(Robert Hunter,<br/>
