<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703423260">Hi - I&#39;m relatively new to this list; I&#39;ve been trying to keep up with all <br/>
the posts, but it&#39;s been difficult due to time constraints lately even to <br/>
read, let alone respond. I&#39;m Linda, and I have a terrific <br/>
three-and-a-half-year-old daughter (Kalie). We decided to homeschool, and <br/>
since doing some research, feel unschooling is definitely the way to go - we <br/>
consider that we&#39;re already on our way! (A VERY unpopular, misunderstood <br/>
decision with friends and relatives, but it seems you all know all about <br/>
that!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I noticed that you mentioned, Ren, that you are working on your <br/>
children&#39;s urge to hit when they&#39;re frustrated. I&#39;d love to know what you&#39;re <br/>
doing and how you&#39;re handling this, and also how old Trevor and Sierra are. <br/>
Kalie has taken to doing this sometimes, especially when she&#39;s overtired (and <br/>
since she has never been a very relaxed sleeper, this is pretty often). She <br/>
hit another child on the head (several times, before they were separated) <br/>
with a toy at a playgroup recently(although she patted and hugged the other <br/>
girl immediately afterward), and will also try to kick sometimes. It was a <br/>
big incident at playgroup, and let&#39;s just say we don&#39;t feel very welcome <br/>
there anymore. Anyway, I want to help her through this the best way possible, <br/>
and could use some advice. Reading and talking to parents whose kids have <br/>
been through the &quot;threes&quot; leads me to believe this is not unusual, since this <br/>
age group can be easily overwhelmed and frustrated, but obviously we can&#39;t <br/>
let her go around bopping people. <br/>
<br/>
Help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Linda<br/>

&gt; Sierra just came to me crying, because Trevor had taken his skateboard back <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and she was having a ball with it.<br/>
&gt; He was irritated because he had asked her to leave it alone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;But I was having fun with it&quot; she wailed.<br/>
&gt; &quot;you really were, weren&#39;t you?&quot; <br/>
&gt; She nods in agreement.<br/>
&gt; &quot;I think you really need your own skateboard, don&#39;t you Sierra&quot;<br/>
&gt; She nods again then shouts &quot;yeah, my very own&quot;<br/>
&gt; Then wipes her eyes and says &quot;I KNOW, A Barbie one, then the boys won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; touch <br/>
&gt; it!!<br/>
&gt; Then we both laughed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She walked off a happy child, feeling heard, feeling understood. Not shamed <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for taking her brothers toy. Trevor got to keep his feelings of ownership <br/>
&gt; intact, and now we have something to search for, a Barbie skateboard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BIG improvement over my former methods.<br/>
&gt; Still working on the children&#39;s urge to hit when frustrated....baby steps.<br/>
