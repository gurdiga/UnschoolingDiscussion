<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233591178"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I do not hate my MIL, but I do pity her. I&#39;ve never met (I&#39;ve known her<br/>
&gt; for more then 20 yrs) a more unhappy person in my life. She makes<br/>
&gt; everyone around her miserable (she has always been like this dh says) <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; the point that none of her kids that live near-by want to visit.<br/>
&gt; It makes you wonder what her real story is....<br/>
&gt; I wonder if someday when she dies we&#39;ll discover old diaries from a<br/>
&gt; young woman who had dreams to go off somewhere and travel the world but<br/>
&gt; instead spent her life in a very small Kentucky town because she got<br/>
&gt; pregnant and had to marry a man who, though very wonderful, she did not<br/>
&gt; love. Or maybe there is some dark family secret from when she was young<br/>
&gt; that she has never gotten past....maybe my FIL was actually a<br/>
&gt; philandering husband who never gave her the love she needed but instead<br/>
&gt; held down a good job, provided well for her and helped her raise 4 <br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; sons. It could just be she wanted to work and was instead stuck by the<br/>
&gt; mores of the times at home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of the Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood.  If you <br/>
haven&#39;t seen the movie (I haven&#39;t read the book, so I don&#39;t know how <br/>
closely the movie follows the book) see it soon.  Ha, what if you saw <br/>
it with her!  That could be a trip!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293523672"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Can kids or adults really learn when they are bored?  Can they?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course we learn when we&#39;re bored.  Just not what the &quot;teachers&quot; want <br/>
us to learn!<br/>
<br/>
Being bored can be great for daydreaming - inventing - meditating...  <br/>
all wonderful learning experiences!<br/>
