<div id="ygrps-yiv-516453802">All of this discussion is important, but I just wanted to remind everybody <br/>
of some general guidelines to preventing virus infestation.<br/>
<br/>
NEVER open attachments unless you are expecting them. They come in all forms <br/>
and with all types of subject lines. As we have seen from this one, they can <br/>
come as replies to messages you send (thus no tell tale subject line) and <br/>
can have a message that seems like the sender might have written it (it may <br/>
be reasonable for someone on the group to point us to a pertinent web site <br/>
or attachment.)<br/>
<br/>
If you get an unexpected attachment, check with the sender before opening it <br/>
and make sure they meant to send it.<br/>
<br/>
If they did NOT, delete the message from your inbox and you deleted items <br/>
folder.<br/>
<br/>
You will not do any harm by reading the message, only by opening the <br/>
attachment.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes this can be a pain, but it&#39;s better to be safe.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to McAfee&#39;s tips:<br/>

<br/>
I might also add that you should avoid avoid leaving a floppy disk inside of <br/>
turned off PC&#39;s drive. Once turned on, your PC will look for the first <br/>
floppy&#39;s sector, and, in case of an infected disk, the virus will run. (This <br/>
happened to a friend of mine -- she lost everything on her hard drive.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270991178">Another thing that we can do is limit sending attachments.  If I get an<br/>
attachment that I really think is worth forwarding to someone, I will cut<br/>
and paste it into a new e-mail, rather than just forward the attachment.<br/>
<br/>
Juno has an option under e-mail preferences &quot;include file attachments in<br/>
forwarded messages&quot;.  I have this disabled (turned off) so that any<br/>
e-mail I receive with an attachment will automatically NOT include the<br/>
attachment if I decide to forward the e-mail to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t e-mail groups also be set up to NOT allow attachments?<br/>

<br/>
This virus sends the attachments all by itself.  It sends out an email to<br/>
addresses from &quot;unread&quot; email and attaches the virus files.  The person<br/>
who owns the &quot;from&quot; address doesn&#39;t even know it has been done.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY way to prevent becoming infected and thus the source of the<br/>
infection is to not open any attachments unless you know what they are<br/>
ahead of time.<br/>
