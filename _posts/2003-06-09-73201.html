I don&#39;t wear jumpers at all. Haven&#39;t owned one since I was 6 and mom made<br/>
them for me. What is it about jumpers and homeschoolers anyway??? I also<br/>

I don&#39;t wear them either... Jeans/shorts and a polo are just comfy for me.<br/>
Even when I was pregnant I could not bring myself to wear them. Bit too airy <br/>

When I see that I know I am in the wrong group. The group we are in now the <br/>
only jumper I have seen is when we had evaluations and the cert. teacher wore <br/>
one. The rest dress pretty much like me not really out to impress but clean and <br/>

I like who I am too. But I always wear makeup. Never go out without it.<br/>
Usually put it on first thing in the morning, er when I wake up!! Depends<br/>
where I&#39;m going as to what goes on, but it&#39;s always on. I have this skin<br/>
thing I&#39;m a bit not liking so that&#39;s one reason. Anyway, it&#39;s also who I am.<br/>
And the hair is always done and the clothes always match. I pretty much<br/>
dress like Tara, except no halters or belly shirts and well, the clothes are<br/>
bigger!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015881079">LOL, <br/>
I wear hubby&#39;s boxers also and started when I was pregnant also. Worked out <br/>
great cuz nothing fit me. I was 128 pre pregnancy and went all the way to 198 <br/>
pretty much hubby&#39;s weight. I wore some of his t-shirts and sweats.<br/>
I usually don&#39;t leave unless my hair is done but I will work in the yard <br/>
without it curled.<br/>
I used to wear the work boots I just liked them more. Now it&#39;s usually a pair <br/>
of sneakers or dock shoes. Loafers I think is what most call them. I want to <br/>
be comfortable tiz all. <br/>
I don&#39;t wear a bandana though I have thought about it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hey Miss Mary, you just made my day!  I never wear jumpers or Birks.  I<br/>
wear<br/>
 raggedy Walmart T-shirts, usually with spaggetti on the backs of the<br/>
 shoulders from carrying a messy kid and breast milk stains LOL, and run<br/>
down<br/>
 shorts with grimy hand prints and used-to-be white slide on tennies.  Does<br/>
 that mean I don&#39;t look like a Mom either!?!?!?!?!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay wait, I use to look like that too. And Tara remembers all too well. I<br/>
don&#39;t anymore though. Maybe THAT&#39;S why Tara thinks I don&#39;t look like a<br/>
mom!!!<br/>

<br/>
Maybe so! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was laughing out loud and Haleigh asked me what was so funny.  She&#39;s a <br/>
neat freak and has been known to actually cry if something gets on her <br/>
clothes while out in public.  I was asking her if I embarrass her when we <br/>
are out and I have kid grime all over me.  (I do actually *try* to wear <br/>
nice, clean clothes and make-up when out in public. &lt;g&gt;)  She made me cry!<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;No!&quot;  (Like I was dumb or something, lol.)  &quot;Why should I be <br/>
embarrassed?  If other people can&#39;t see 7 kids following you around and <br/>
understand, THEY should be embarrassed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said to her, after crying, &quot;you know, you&#39;re a pretty kick-ass kid, you <br/>
know it?&quot;  She gave me a huge hug and told me I&#39;m a pretty kick-ass mom. <br/>
&lt;BIG HUGE GRIN!&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WOW!!  I LOVE my kids!<br/>
<br/>

feel and look furry.  I don&#39;t much like the way they look but do like the<br/>
way they feel.  I shaved when we travelled with Lars&#39; ball team 2 summers<br/>
ago.  I thought he might get embarrassed by my &quot;fur&quot;.  In the end, we never<br/>
went swimming together, but I found that I was wearing skirts and shorts<br/>
more when my legs were smooth.  Now I shave during the hot weather and not<br/>
the rest of the year.<br/>

But have you noticed that if you let it go for a while, it doesn&#39;t grow so quickly or come in stubbly?  So you are actually just moving towards softer hair and less shaving in your future!  I am pushing the limits of this right now.  Told a friend of mine to send over her son who mows lawns to do the deed.  I do have light hair but in the sun and wind it is pretty obviously there!<br/>

<br/>
Thankfully, mine has never been really stubbly...hehe I like that word <br/>
rolling off the tongue...anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Mine is very light, although since I&#39;ve let it grow out, mostly a fat <br/>
thing...I turn purple when I bend over to shave, lol...I&#39;ve noticed it is <br/>
getting dark on the inside of my calves, which looks really odd and gives me <br/>
another reason to shave.<br/>
<br/>
I think my reasons for not shaving are pretty cut and dry:<br/>
<br/>
never get enough time in the shower to do it<br/>
can&#39;t much see it anyway<br/>
lack of oxygen from bending over<br/>
takes too damn long<br/>
<br/>
Although this is the longest I&#39;ve ever gone without shaving.  Maybe it&#39;s not <br/>
having ac and being so hot but it is really making my legs feel nappy.  I <br/>
talked my grandmother into bringing me a razor.  It will be gone by dawn!  <br/>
Oh...don&#39;t you just love slithering into clean cold sheets with freshly <br/>
shaven legs???  Guess I&#39;ll have to put my sheets in the freezer for a while <br/>
to cool them off but the thought actually sounds pretty good right about <br/>
now.....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so easily pleased it&#39;s pathetic!<br/>
