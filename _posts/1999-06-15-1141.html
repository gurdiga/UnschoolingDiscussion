<div id="ygrps-yiv-653341517">I have been lurking here for a few weeks (seems like a few months)<br/>
trying to get caught up enough to join the conversations. It will never<br/>
happen. I am learning to unschool 5 kids ages 2-7. It is still a new<br/>
concept to me and I was very excited about the idea of learning from<br/>
more experienced unschoolers.  Most of what I read on here is valuable<br/>
but I just can&#39;t keep up, I have been reading for over an hour this<br/>
morning (and did the same yesterday) and I am still not caught up from<br/>
the weekend. The kids will be up soon.  Before I unsub from this great<br/>
but very overwhelmingly large list I would like to see if there are<br/>
folks who are similarly minded and situated who may be interested in a<br/>
smaller, more intimate, manageable list. Specifically: Christian,<br/>
unschooler, attachment parenting(ish), into health and natural<br/>
alternatives to the chemical filled world, not into the materialistic<br/>
commercialism that surrounds us. If this sounds somewhat like you, e<br/>
mail me . <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Starfreedom@...">Starfreedom@...</a>  I am sorry to leave this list but I<br/>
need to get more specific with the small amount of time I have.   Thank<br/>
you.  Mary in Idaho</div>
