<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443099960">Hey all, jacli here :)<br/>
Whew!  I just cannot seem to keep up with all the email!<br/>
I always seem to be a bit behind with this list, sorry.<br/>
Anyway, I saw the movie the day it came out. (but once <br/>
is my limit, we know we&#39;re gonna get the dvd, paying for<br/>
the <br/>
movie again and again and again just seems silly)<br/>
I got the whole family up at 8 am sharp.<br/>
<br/>
I actually was the first one to read Harry Potter.<br/>
It was featured in a little featurette/novelette form in <br/>
Science Fiction Age before the book was actually published.<br/>
So when the books came out guess who got each and every<br/>
one?<br/>
I love the books.  I was a little concerned about letting<br/>
my daughter<br/>
read them to be honest.  There is a fair amount of scary<br/>
content and<br/>
in book 2 and 3  a couple of swear words to boot.  But all<br/>
in all I decided<br/>
to go slow and see what happens.  She loves them.  We have<br/>
the books,<br/>
the games, the cups.  We&#39;ve seen the toys and both daughter<br/>
and I declared them &quot;lame&quot;.   Sweatshirts are cool but  I<br/>
draw the line at bedclothes though.  I like Harry Potter,<br/>
LIKE.  I don&#39;t allow any movie/books to dictate home decor.<br/>
I made that clear with the inlaws who insisted on buying<br/>
Beauty and the Beast sheets.  And Pocahontas sheets.  And<br/>
Hercules, and well you get the idea...<br/>
<br/>
well just my two cents for the day!  Jacli &quot;the obsessed&quot;<br/>
BTW, for any of my fellow anal retentives out there there<br/>
is a Harry Potter <br/>
mention on the movie-mistakes.com site.<br/>
Go to:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.movie-mistakes.com/film.php?filmid=1654">http://www.movie-mistakes.com/film.php?filmid=1654</a><br/>
and of course the official Harry Potter site (<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/">http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/</a> ) has been in my<br/>
favorites list since early this year.!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So who has seen the movie yet? How many times (if at<br/>
all) have you or <br/>
your kids read the books? Is everyone getting the<br/>
official sheets/<br/>
toothpaste/action figures/toys/breakfast cereal for<br/>
the holidays? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365306681">We all went and saw the movie on Thanksgiving Day as a special treat.  <br/>
We had already read book #1 and now the boys can&#39;t wait to start #2.  We <br/>
were at Walmart yesterday and they saw the Harry Potter socks.  They <br/>
were not expensive, so I went ahead and bought them along with Scoobie <br/>
Doo slippers.  They needed both anyway.  I don&#39;t see anything wrong with <br/>
buying those items you mentioned below, if it will may my babies happy.  <br/>
Anything to make them happy!!  (Well, almost.  And, if I can afford it <br/>
also).  My only exception would be the cereal.  But they know I usually <br/>
don&#39;t buy cereal full of sugar like that.<br/>

  Ooooo #4 is very scary. My son was 8 when we read it and we both decided to read it only in the daylight! I began reading HP to him but I got hooked as well--sometimes I&#39;d continue to read after he fell asleep at night and then have to back track for him the next day. We&#39;ve read all 4 books and listened to 1 and 2 on audio as well. We are very impatiently waiting for #5 to come out. We saw the movie and thought it was well-done, but of course, much was left out so that was a disappointment. We don&#39;t (so far) have any of the &quot;stuff,&quot; though ds will be getting some Lego/HP items for Christmas. The children have their own money, which they are free to use on HP if they wish but so far the Legos are the only thing creating an interest here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>#4 is the scariest, but also the saddest. Cacie (who I guess was 7 when<br/>
she read that one) was much more sad than scared. <br/>
<br/>
Cacie has a Hogwarts t shirt (Dillards clearance) and I have a Hogwarts<br/>
purple canvas knitting bag (Target clearance - I think they called it a<br/>
tote bag ;-). They cost 3 or 4 bucks each... we&#39;re getting the Lego<br/>
Hogwarts for Christmas...technically she&#39;s getting it, but she knows how<br/>
I love to put lego stuff together and always shares the big ones.<br/>
