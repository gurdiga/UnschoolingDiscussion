<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956299759">I saved this from a few years ago because Helen said she really liked it.  I <br/>
wish I had found it when the deschooling question was first asked, but it&#39;s <br/>
still good a few days later. &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t remember who asked the original <br/>
questions; sorry.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; All in all this has been a great experience and we all agree HS is where <br/>
we want to be...but does any one have input on the motivation/curiosity <br/>
issue?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even before I read the rest of the post my question for you was whether <br/>
you&#39;re wanting their learning parcelled out evenly over the year, over the <br/>
week, over the day. &lt;g&gt;   Life is lumpy.   Like statistics, like chaos <br/>
theory, there are &quot;busy&quot; times and big loops which seem to be going nowhere <br/>
and actually have a destination.    Think &quot;leaps and bounds&quot; (with rests in <br/>
between).   Cats are certainly bright and curious, and they sleep more than <br/>
half of the time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do I just need to be encouraging and bide my time as the habits are <br/>
relearned?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s waiting.  And I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &quot;relearning&quot; or &quot;habits,&quot; <br/>
but until the school habits are forgotten.  It&#39;s always easier to cut <br/>
something off than for it to grow back, and school sometimes cuts kids off <br/>
from their natural curiosity and desire.    <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We (spouse and I) do want them to learn piano and math at a steady pace, <br/>
the rest we would like to leave for them to choose???  Comments???&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Steady pace&quot; jumped out at me.<br/>
<br/>
What if they have a great piano week where they practice two hours a day and <br/>
then are tired of it for the rest of the month?  It wouldn&#39;t all be lost and <br/>
over and ruined.<br/>
<br/>
What if, one day, they just GET some mathematical concept.  Will that reset <br/>
the level at which you want them to work steadily?<br/>
<br/>
Kids at school each &quot;get&quot; multiplication once, and after that they&#39;re just  <br/>
hearing the explanation over and over while the teacher rephrases and <br/>
re-introduces and reviews in hopes that all the other kids will &quot;get it&quot; that <br/>
day.   (Reminds me of singing an invitational hymn three times because the <br/>
preacher has his eye on one potential convert.)<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;steady&quot; pace schools simulate is 1) not real, and 2) not applicable to <br/>
homeschooling anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Having history&quot; 180 times a year is like trying to teach a pig to sing.   In <br/>
one hour an interested and curious (i.e. &quot;ripe&quot;) child might learn as much <br/>
about the Civil War or Apollo 11 as they would in a week at school (if ever). <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that the deschooling needed in this situation is more of the <br/>
parents than the kids.   I still have subconscious school-stuff to slough <br/>
off; it surfaces when I least expect it and I wrestle it, encapsulate it, and <br/>
try to forget it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978751930">Hi<br/>
I am new to this list and new to hsing (we are officially out of the school <br/>
today!).  I am timid about the next few weeks as we decompress from 3 years <br/>
in structured school to a relaxed approach.  My kids are so programmed to <br/>
how &quot;school&quot; works, I am wondering what I can do to ease the transition from <br/>
institution to home, from bell schedules to their own planning and <br/>
interests.  Any thoughts?  Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep - let them watch TV, read, sleep in, eat when they need to, play when <br/>
they need to.  Don&#39;t schedule anything - go with the flow of their rythms.  <br/>
Let them get totally into whatever it is that interests them (Yes, even if it <br/>
is all video games all the time or all TV all the time.)  YOU plan for some <br/>
little trips for yourself - &quot;I&#39;m going to the park today, anyone want to <br/>
come??&quot; if they say yes - great, if they say no - fine too.  I would be going <br/>
to museums, parks, shopping, book stores - whatever it is you like, and <br/>
always invite the kids along.  Never force it on them to participate - just <br/>
make sure YOU enjoy yourself.  Soon, the kids will catch on to the fun you <br/>
are having.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t set up a time limit for &quot;deschooling&quot; either.  Just watch your kids, <br/>
are they getting their sparkle back? Great - then make some suggestions about <br/>
a fun thing to do.  Are they appearing depressed? Withdrawn? Let them chill <br/>
if that is what they need.  <br/>
<br/>
It is going to be MOST difficult for you - because you are going to look and <br/>
say &quot;but what about the stuff they aren&#39;t learning???&quot; -- Look for what they <br/>
ARE learning.  Are they on the computer? They are strengthening reading and <br/>
writing skills.  Are they playing massive amounts of video games? There is <br/>
math and dedcutive reasonsing and all kinds of critical thinking in video <br/>
games.  Retrain yourself, without putting the pressure on the kids...<br/>
<br/>
Does this help?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-592374099">Hmmm... well if your kids really want to do the school stuff (which they<br/>
might not, depending) you could try more of a homeschool approach (ie. doing<br/>
some structured lessons). However, if they are not interested they probably<br/>
could use some &quot;deschooling time&quot;. How old are they? ~Eryn<br/>

Well said! All those years of schooling really do get into our subconscious <br/>
and it&#39;s harder for some to let go of the idea that learning is something <br/>
that takes place in school. Life is educational and as long as we are still <br/>
alive, we are learning. We learn what we need to know at the time we need to <br/>
know it. <br/>
