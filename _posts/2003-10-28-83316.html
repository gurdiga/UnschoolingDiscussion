&gt; Subject: homeschooling article<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I read the article (and I apologize for being so late----yahoo vs aol<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; SOOO infuriating, plus we were OOT for four days. So sorry), I saw the<br/>
benefits<br/>
&gt; of what he was trying to convey with the IDEA of living in the real world<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; opposed to schooling at home or HOMEschooling. But I cringed throughout<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; piece. It *could* be that I&#39;m an atheist in the heart of the Bible Belt.<br/>
&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
&gt; It *could* be that because of my geographical location I&#39;m just a bit more<br/>
&gt; hypersensitive to &quot;fundie-speak&quot; than the average Joe. Could be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But even as I read it, I knew that I could probably send it to my in-laws<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; that it might strike a cord with them. I won&#39;t, though. I couldn&#39;t in good<br/>
&gt; faith promote *anything* along those lines. Remove the bigotry, the<br/>
hatred, the<br/>
&gt; euphemisms, and the bold-face religious aspect, and it might work for me.<br/>
&gt; Like I said, the overall message is good---it&#39;s the underlying CRAP that<br/>
does it<br/>
&gt; in!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But this guy has an agenda. He also leaves his website available so that<br/>
&gt; unsuspecting folks will wander in and maybe &quot;see the light&quot; (just like<br/>
Sandra<br/>
&gt; does----it&#39;s not ALL evil! &lt;G&gt;). On the bright side, I guess it *could*<br/>
help the<br/>
&gt; fundies see that they DON&#39;T have to worship Bob Jones and Abeka and<br/>
Sonlight<br/>
&gt; and that it *could* help their children to have happier, more joyful<br/>
lives. So<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got to give him that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe that the article was written for *US*; his audience is<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; right-wing, fundamentalist Christians who (in my opinion) DO need to<br/>
lighten<br/>
&gt; up and see that learning exists in the great, big, wild, wide world<br/>
(although<br/>
&gt; he might argue that the world shouldn&#39;t be *that* great*, *that* big,<br/>
*that*<br/>
&gt; wild, or *that* wide!). But I&#39;ll give him credit for trying to open up<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; &quot;schooling&quot; world a bit!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;ll rewrite it to be more &quot;unschoolingly politically correct&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
You<br/>
&gt; notice he NEVER used that word, &quot;unschooling&quot;----it would put off too many<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; his audience members!  I&#39;ll work on that today and see whether it can be<br/>
&gt; fixed. Until then, I&#39;ll definitely refrain from sending it on!<br/>

&gt; Subject: intense focus<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can&#39;t understand why a child would claim to be addicted to<br/>
something,<br/>
&gt; unless they somehow got the idea from someone else that they shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; spending so much time on that activity or that that activity is somehow a<br/>
&gt; negative thing. Would any of us ever think that our child was addicted to<br/>
&gt; playing in the sandbox or riding their bike?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a lot of negative talk about &quot;addictions&quot; that aren&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; addictions---but rather intense focus. I believe whole-heartedly that<br/>
intense focus is<br/>
&gt; a GOOD thing. And that they can come and go, wax and wane. Addictions<br/>
aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My focal points have changed over the years---at different points in my<br/>
life,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been EXTREMELY focused on dogs: their breeding, training, grooming,<br/>
&gt; showing, judging. Horses: their training, handling, grooming, racing,<br/>
tack, and<br/>
&gt; showing. Travel. Food, parties, and entertaining. Remodeling and<br/>
decorating old<br/>
&gt; houses. Gardening. Ancient civilizations and sociology. Astronomy.  And<br/>
land<br/>
&gt; searching. And beekeeping and alpacas. Unschooling is my main focus<br/>
now---and I<br/>
&gt; had to throw myself into conferences for a while. Occasionally to the<br/>
&gt; detriment of other, more minor, things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Focus is HARD for many people. And I think that maybe THEY see focus as an<br/>
&gt; addiction. Could that be possible?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ben&#39;s  most recent issue of The Wine Spectator had a full page ad with a<br/>
hand<br/>
&gt; holding a trout. Underneath was this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;He never learned to fly-fish. Or play a trombone. Or waterski. Or learn<br/>
&gt; German. Here&#39;s to 90 years of focus!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Happy 90th bithday, Robert Mondavi!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Made my day! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Screw &quot;well-roundedness&quot;!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay so what was I - mother of the year - doing?  Sitting at the<br/>
computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing a stinking game while I was waiting for her to get her pjs on so<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could read to her in my bed.  At the time all I could/wanted to feel was<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; injustice of me &#39;having&#39; to pander to her every whim (let&#39;s not go there<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; now), of &#39;having&#39; to put up with her verbal and physical abuse (let&#39;s<br/>
not go<br/>
&gt; &gt; there yet either).  All I could/wanted to think about was how I deserved<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; break after driving around dropping off and picking up when I could have<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; &gt; home doing......what???  One correct answer is &#39;being with Megan and<br/>
loving this<br/>
&gt; &gt; child who right at this moment needed something other than a big fat<br/>
pinch<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the arm&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And another answer is doing something you love to do, like brewing a<br/>
strong<br/>
&gt; cup of coffee or reading a few pages of a book you love or yes, being at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; computer, venting a minute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In another post, Joyce asked me what personal boundaries I was trying to<br/>
set<br/>
&gt; -- this was in relation to the&quot; I&#39;m on the verge of requiring bedtimes&quot;<br/>
&gt; thread.  And what you&#39;ve (bravely and honestly) described here is the<br/>
situation I<br/>
&gt; need to avoid, because we&#39;ve been there before.  If I do too much for<br/>
others,<br/>
&gt; past the point where I have some internal resources left for myself, then<br/>
I end<br/>
&gt; up not being able to deal with the things that inevitably come up during<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; day.  Some alone time at the end of the day is one thing I need to do for<br/>
&gt; myself -- some time to think my own thoughts.  (The &quot;light times&quot; and<br/>
quiet times<br/>
&gt; seem to be a good answer to those particular concerns.)  I have gotten<br/>
*much*<br/>
&gt; better at talking to Fisher about what I need (negotiating) instead of<br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; to do everything that was &quot;on the agenda.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Elijah was the first homeschooling catalog I got when I started<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; out and I read it cover to cover. All that stuff! And the detailed<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; descriptions! &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One homeschooling family I knew through the SCA, I met when Kirby was one<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; their kids ranged from 2 - 12.  Five kid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Years passed, I liked the kids, one had the same birthday as I did, and<br/>
Kirby<br/>
&gt; got to be five and then didn&#39;t go to school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Years passed, and once they all spent the weekend with us and we had a<br/>
GREAT<br/>
&gt; time.  Part of the great time involved video games, on the cutting edge<br/>
system<br/>
&gt; the time, which was a Nintendo 64.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The mom had been homeschooling by then for maybe twelve years.<br/>
&gt; We discussed exchanging some of our information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I gave her some printouts from online discussions that I&#39;d really liked<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; then, a copy of the interview with me in Home Education Magazine (which I<br/>
&gt; thought would be fun because she&#39;d known me before I&#39;d ever considered<br/>
&gt; homeschooling) and a couple of little articles I had written.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She gave me an Elijah Company catalog.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That was it.<br/>
&gt; I was interested in the vast array of inexpensive illustrated history<br/>
books<br/>
&gt; (many of which I already had) but kind of appalled at the creationist<br/>
science<br/>
&gt; and the number of religious bios (all Protestant, which ended up skewing<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; history offerings around the Renaissance).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we next met to trade back our stuff (they needed their catalog back)<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; dad said very testily and privately to me:  &quot;We don&#39;t need YOU to tell us<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; to homeschool.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yah.  Well.  He had never been in on the original conversation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But not long after that they got a Nintendo system.<br/>
&gt; And they loosened up on their lessons.<br/>
&gt; And the mom eventually ran the dad off (to the other end of their rambling<br/>
&gt; hippie property, but off from the main house).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They had been living off his mental disability payments (and social<br/>
security<br/>
&gt; and welfare), but the kids came up with a very cool magic and juggling<br/>
act,<br/>
&gt; and some of you probably have seen them or will someday.   &quot;The Clan<br/>
Tynker.&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; At one time they had a webpage (an advertisement, not much more) but I<br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; find it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The girls&#39; real names were Sarah and Mary (Biblical) but they messed with<br/>
&gt; them (which is fine).  Rebekah is the one with the same birthday as mine.<br/>
Sam is<br/>
&gt; dating Sadie, one of the unschoolers I&#39;ve talked about here sometimes, who<br/>
&gt; has done two years of college and is off this year doing construction and<br/>

&gt; What you wrote is pretty much where I was at on it. Here many HSers do<br/>
follow<br/>
&gt; a religion and would benefit from relaxing and I agree this article was<br/>
&gt; saying just that to them.<br/>
&gt; I should not have forwarded it to this list and NO I dont think many if<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; on this list need the sting (to relax) from a religious end. I do however<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; that those who know others may benefit from some of the comments<br/>
especially<br/>
&gt; the curriculum part. It would have been misleading for me to pick the post<br/>
&gt; apart and send to the list but for others sake I totally would and did.<br/>

&gt; faith promote *anything* along those lines. Remove the bigotry, the<br/>
hatred,<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; euphemisms, and the bold-face religious aspect, and it might work for me.<br/>
&gt; Like I said, the overall message is good---it&#39;s the underlying CRAP that<br/>
does<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; in!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But this guy has an agenda. He also leaves his website available so that<br/>
&gt; unsuspecting folks will wander in and maybe &quot;see the light&quot; (just like<br/>
Sandra<br/>
&gt; does----it&#39;s not ALL evil! &lt;G&gt;). On the bright side, I guess it *could*<br/>
help<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; fundies see that they DON&#39;T have to worship Bob Jones and Abeka and<br/>
Sonlight<br/>
&gt; and that it *could* help their children to have happier, more joyful<br/>
lives.<br/>
&gt; So<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got to give him that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe that the article was written for *US*; his audience is<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; right-wing, fundamentalist Christians who (in my opinion) DO need to<br/>
lighten<br/>
&gt; up and see that learning exists in the great, big, wild, wide world<br/>
(although<br/>
&gt; he might argue that the world shouldn&#39;t be *that* great*, *that* big,<br/>
*that*<br/>
&gt; wild, or *that* wide!). But I&#39;ll give him credit for trying to open up<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; &quot;schooling&quot; world a bit!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;ll rewrite it to be more &quot;unschoolingly politically correct&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
You<br/>
&gt; notice he NEVER used that word, &quot;unschooling&quot;----it would put off too many<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; his audience members!  I&#39;ll work on that today and see whether it can be<br/>
&gt; fixed. Until then, I&#39;ll definitely refrain from sending it on!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Focus is HARD for many people. And I think that maybe THEY see focus as<br/>
an<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Screw &quot;well-roundedness&quot;!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AMEN!!!  I look at an addiction as something someone does repeatedly that<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; harmful to themselves, such as drugs, over eating, etc.  I read every day,<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; that an addiction?  Absolutely  not.  Sometimes I enjoy a book so much<br/>
that I<br/>
&gt; will read until I am finished, do nothing else except the<br/>
&gt; necessaries-bathroom, eating, etc.  Still, not an addiction.  A choice;<br/>
there&#39;s a difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And thank you for saying &quot;screw wellroundedness&quot;!!!  I feel the same way.<br/>
&gt; Why should I know the price in China when (a) I&#39;m never going there and<br/>
(b)<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t eat it anyway.  And there are many other reasons not to know the<br/>
price of<br/>
&gt; rice in China.  There are many things I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t feel less<br/>
of a<br/>
&gt; person for not filling myself up with a bunch of information that I will<br/>
&gt; eventually forget and never use anyway.  What I do know, I know well, and<br/>
what I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know, well, I have the internet and the library for that IF I<br/>
actually want<br/>

&gt; Here is some of what Phyllis Schlafly has to say about homeschooling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml">http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It takes uncommon commitment by parents to undertake a homeschool<br/>
&gt; regimen, but they soon discover they can do in a couple of hours what<br/>
&gt; takes all day at regular school.  Homeschooling parents can save lots<br/>
&gt; of time since there are so many courses they don&#39;t have to teach.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They don&#39;t have to teach multiculturalism, the peculiar notion that<br/>
&gt; other cultures should be preferred to our own, or teach a course in<br/>
&gt; Islam, such as is now taught in California schools.  Homeschooling<br/>
&gt; parents are free to teach that their religion and their country are the<br/>
&gt; best.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschooling parents do not have to teach political correctness, such<br/>
&gt; as the dogma that all academic subjects must be taught through the<br/>
&gt; prism of gender and race oppression.  They are free to teach that<br/>
&gt; America is not a land of victims but a country of freedom and<br/>
&gt; opportunity for all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschooing parents do not have to teach the androgyny demanded by<br/>
&gt; radical feminism.  They are free to teach boys and girls separately and<br/>
&gt; differently and let their boys enjoy plenty of recess to work off their<br/>
&gt; excess energy and avoid giving them Ritalin to make them behave like<br/>
&gt; girls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers do not have to take a course every year in Diversity, the<br/>
&gt; code word for gay rights, as is now mandated K-12 by the California<br/>
&gt; State Legislature.  Parent educators are free to teach that it is OK to<br/>
&gt; be judgmental about illegal and immoral acts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschooling parents don&#39;t have to teach revisionist history that<br/>
&gt; deletes mention of Washington, Jefferson and Franklin, as the New<br/>
&gt; Jersey State Department of Education tried to do, but had to back down<br/>
&gt; after a parental uproar.  Homeschoolers have academic freedom to study<br/>
&gt; the Founding Fathers and read the writings of the DWEMs (Dead White<br/>
&gt; European Males) who contributed so much to Western Civilization.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers do not have to study global education that is designed to<br/>
&gt; promote global interdependence and citizens of the world instead of the<br/>
&gt; U.S.A.  Homeschooling parents do not have to teach Environmental<br/>
&gt; Education fantasies such as that humans exist to serve the earth<br/>
&gt; instead of vice versa.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers don&#39;t have to study fuzzy math, whole math, new math, new<br/>
&gt; new math, or rainforest math.  They won&#39;t waste math time discussing,<br/>
&gt; coloring, playing games, or telling their parents how good they feel<br/>
&gt; about incorrect answers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschooled children will learn to read using authentic phonics as<br/>
&gt; their first order of business, so they won&#39;t have to take remedial<br/>
&gt; reading after three years of failure.  They won&#39;t be inflicted with<br/>
&gt; Whole Language, which fraudulently teaches children to guess at words<br/>
&gt; from the pictures, skip over difficult words, and substitute any words<br/>
&gt; that seem to fit the context.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers will save lots of time because they don&#39;t have to read<br/>
&gt; typical middle school assignments of depressing modern fiction by<br/>
&gt; &quot;nobody&quot; authors writing about drugs, violence, sex, runaway teens,<br/>
&gt; witchcraft, and other depressing subjects.  Homeschoolers can read<br/>
&gt; books about heroes and stories that build character, courage,<br/>
&gt; patriotism, and virtue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers won&#39;t have to spend time filling out nosy questionnaires<br/>
&gt; about sex, drugs and suicide.  The public schools are obsessed with<br/>
&gt; asking students impudent personal questions such as how many times have<br/>
&gt; you felt depressed and tried to commit suicide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are many more worthless courses taught in public schools on which<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers will not spend their precious time, such as courses in<br/>
&gt; murder (forensics is the latest fad), suicide, death and dying,<br/>
&gt; evolution, and self-esteem.  Homeschooled students won&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; problem with self-esteem because their self-esteem will be earned by<br/>
&gt; achievement in mastering the important truths of history, literature,<br/>
&gt; math and science.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   large number of cases like this are already having more oversight<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   most people. The Victoria Climbie case in the Uk was the same.<br/>

&gt; Didn&#39;t know that at all.  I&#39;ll have to look that up.  I was only looking<br/>
at homeschooling, public schooling and testing.  Interesting.  Maybe I&#39;ll<br/>
change my mind, Stepheny<br/>

&gt; Ohhhhh, standing corrected.  Very corrected, all that is too old mind<br/>
stuff.  My dd is very much too active to do dishes or cook or any &quot; girl<br/>
stuff&quot;  much like her mom.  Stepheny<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Here is some of what Phyllis Schlafly has to say about homeschooling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml">http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It takes uncommon commitment by parents to undertake a homeschool<br/>
&gt;   regimen, but they soon discover they can do in a couple of hours what<br/>
&gt;   takes all day at regular school.  Homeschooling parents can save lots<br/>
&gt;   of time since there are so many courses they don&#39;t have to teach.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   They don&#39;t have to teach multiculturalism, the peculiar notion that<br/>
&gt;   other cultures should be preferred to our own, or teach a course in<br/>
&gt;   Islam, such as is now taught in California schools.  Homeschooling<br/>
&gt;   parents are free to teach that their religion and their country are the<br/>
&gt;   best.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Homeschooling parents do not have to teach political correctness, such<br/>
&gt;   as the dogma that all academic subjects must be taught through the<br/>
&gt;   prism of gender and race oppression.  They are free to teach that<br/>
&gt;   America is not a land of victims but a country of freedom and<br/>
&gt;   opportunity for all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Homeschooing parents do not have to teach the androgyny demanded by<br/>
&gt;   radical feminism.  They are free to teach boys and girls separately and<br/>
&gt;   differently and let their boys enjoy plenty of recess to work off their<br/>
&gt;   excess energy and avoid giving them Ritalin to make them behave like<br/>
&gt;   girls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Homeschoolers do not have to take a course every year in Diversity, the<br/>
&gt;   code word for gay rights, as is now mandated K-12 by the California<br/>
&gt;   State Legislature.  Parent educators are free to teach that it is OK to<br/>
&gt;   be judgmental about illegal and immoral acts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Homeschooling parents don&#39;t have to teach revisionist history that<br/>
&gt;   deletes mention of Washington, Jefferson and Franklin, as the New<br/>
&gt;   Jersey State Department of Education tried to do, but had to back down<br/>
&gt;   after a parental uproar.  Homeschoolers have academic freedom to study<br/>
&gt;   the Founding Fathers and read the writings of the DWEMs (Dead White<br/>
&gt;   European Males) who contributed so much to Western Civilization.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Homeschoolers do not have to study global education that is designed to<br/>
&gt;   promote global interdependence and citizens of the world instead of the<br/>
&gt;   U.S.A.  Homeschooling parents do not have to teach Environmental<br/>
&gt;   Education fantasies such as that humans exist to serve the earth<br/>
&gt;   instead of vice versa.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Homeschoolers don&#39;t have to study fuzzy math, whole math, new math, new<br/>
&gt;   new math, or rainforest math.  They won&#39;t waste math time discussing,<br/>
&gt;   coloring, playing games, or telling their parents how good they feel<br/>
&gt;   about incorrect answers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Homeschooled children will learn to read using authentic phonics as<br/>
&gt;   their first order of business, so they won&#39;t have to take remedial<br/>
&gt;   reading after three years of failure.  They won&#39;t be inflicted with<br/>
&gt;   Whole Language, which fraudulently teaches children to guess at words<br/>
&gt;   from the pictures, skip over difficult words, and substitute any words<br/>
&gt;   that seem to fit the context.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Homeschoolers will save lots of time because they don&#39;t have to read<br/>
&gt;   typical middle school assignments of depressing modern fiction by<br/>
&gt;   &quot;nobody&quot; authors writing about drugs, violence, sex, runaway teens,<br/>
&gt;   witchcraft, and other depressing subjects.  Homeschoolers can read<br/>
&gt;   books about heroes and stories that build character, courage,<br/>
&gt;   patriotism, and virtue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Homeschoolers won&#39;t have to spend time filling out nosy questionnaires<br/>
&gt;   about sex, drugs and suicide.  The public schools are obsessed with<br/>
&gt;   asking students impudent personal questions such as how many times have<br/>
&gt;   you felt depressed and tried to commit suicide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   There are many more worthless courses taught in public schools on which<br/>
&gt;   homeschoolers will not spend their precious time, such as courses in<br/>
&gt;   murder (forensics is the latest fad), suicide, death and dying,<br/>
&gt;   evolution, and self-esteem.  Homeschooled students won&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt;   problem with self-esteem because their self-esteem will be earned by<br/>
&gt;   achievement in mastering the important truths of history, literature,<br/>
&gt;   math and science.<br/>

experience<br/>
&gt; this year.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just wondering about our members down there. Anybody in imminent<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just wanted to pass on the response I received from Kraft about<br/>
&gt; their advertising on the CBS Evening News.  Unfortunately they are<br/>
&gt; not supportive as the makers of Claratin were (so I, for one, will<br/>
&gt; use the power of my *purchasing dollars*!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for contacting us directly to tell us of your reaction to<br/>
&gt; the CBS Evening News segment.  It gives us the chance to express to<br/>
&gt; you the thinking that guides our advertising decisions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The issues involved are tough ones, full of controversy and<br/>
&gt; emotion.  We take your comments very seriously.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kraft is always concerned about the media environment in which our<br/>
&gt; advertising appears and we have rigorous policies governing the<br/>
&gt; placement of our ads.  We enforce ourpolicies to the best of<br/>
&gt; our ability.  From time to time, we are asked to use the power of our<br/>
&gt; advertising dollars to intervene in the editorial policies of the<br/>
&gt; media -- to influence newscoverage on this network or<br/>
&gt; drive a personality off the air at that station.  Each time, we<br/>
&gt; decline,explaining that viewers and listeners are the arbiters, not<br/>
&gt; advertisers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope this clarifies the situation.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I hate housework - I&#39;m bored to tears, sometimes literally, over<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m frustrated by it and I get cranky when I have to spend time<br/>
&gt; doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My house shows the effects of my bad attitude.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yep, me too.  Doing housework is BORING.  I think that&#39;s one of the<br/>
&gt; things I hate about it--the lack of mental stimulation.  One thing<br/>
&gt; that helps me sometimes is to get books on tape to listen to while<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m doing housework.  That way my mind has something to think about<br/>
&gt; while I&#39;m doing the boring, boring work.<br/>

&gt; Oh, I&#39;m appreciating this thread so much!  I&#39;ve read half way through<br/>
&gt; the thread and I&#39;m saving the rest for tomorrow.  I can&#39;t wait to<br/>
&gt; read the rest!  SO much wisdom here, and fresh perspective at just<br/>
&gt; the right time for me. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Something I haven&#39;t seen discussed on this list before is whether or<br/>
&gt; not anyone has ever considered hiring someone to help with<br/>
&gt; housework?  You can find people to clean for 5-10 dollars an hour.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been toying with the idea...if someone came once or twice a week<br/>
&gt; for a few hours at a time...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think about it and then I feel guilty, because I shouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; spend money on something that I could do myself.  And is that<br/>
&gt; teaching my kids that we don&#39;t have to clean the house ourselves, and<br/>
&gt; the fact that people might think we&#39;re snobs if we had a housekeeper,<br/>
&gt; and....   Any thoughts?<br/>

&gt; Math time. As opposed to what OTHER kind of time? Anytime, all time,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Something I haven&#39;t seen discussed on this list before is whether or<br/>
&gt; &gt; not anyone has ever considered hiring someone to help with<br/>
&gt; &gt; housework?  You can find people to clean for 5-10 dollars an hour.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been toying with the idea...if someone came once or twice a week<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a few hours at a time...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think about it and then I feel guilty, because I shouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; spend money on something that I could do myself.  And is that<br/>
&gt; &gt; teaching my kids that we don&#39;t have to clean the house ourselves, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the fact that people might think we&#39;re snobs if we had a housekeeper,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and....   Any thoughts?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sheila<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sheila,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have someone come to clean every other week for three hours and I love<br/>
it!<br/>
&gt; If I could justify spending the money, I&#39;d have her come weekly!  It WAS<br/>
&gt; hard though, at the beginning,  just admitting that I couldn&#39;t (or<br/>
wouldn&#39;t)<br/>
&gt; handle it myself.  I was brought up in a family where you never admitted<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; needed help of any kind.  After I had my babies, my parents would come<br/>
visit<br/>
&gt; for the day (to see the new baby) then go home.  Mom said to me; &quot;I know<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; a day or two you&#39;ll be back to your old routine.&quot;  So I always did what<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; expected:  Had my babies on Saturday, came home Sunday, rested on Monday,<br/>
&gt; then life as usual started on Tuesday.   But I regress....<br/>
&gt; Anyway, when my second was born, the oldest was 2 1/2.  My DH was working<br/>
60<br/>
&gt; hours/week and traveling a LOT.  After 2 months of trying to keep<br/>
everything<br/>
&gt; done, I started wearing socks around the house all the time, because I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t stand all the crud on the floor sticking to my feet.  DH finally<br/>
&gt; said; &quot;Why don&#39;t we just have someone come in to clean?&quot;  So we did and<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; never looked back.  I don&#39;t feel too guilty about it because the money I<br/>
&gt; spend saves me time that I can spend with the kids, and Maya gets more<br/>
done<br/>
&gt; in three hours than I could do in twice that time with all the kids around<br/>
.<br/>
&gt; Also, even if you have someone in to clean, there&#39;s still lots of cleaning<br/>
&gt; to be done by the family.  You might want to try just once a month.  It<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; gives you a week off and that could help with getting caught up with other<br/>
&gt; projects like cleaning out closets, or the refrigerator, basement, etc...<br/>
&gt; As for what other people might think.....you&#39;re an unschooler.  You have<br/>
&gt; already proven you can swim against the current.  If other people son&#39;t<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; it, they&#39;re probably just jealous!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Marjorie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  Around here the going rate is more like $20/hour.  Good luck finding<br/>
&gt; someone cheaper!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi to all you very wise women,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know this isn&#39;t my problem (right now) but I am connect so I<br/>
&gt; thought I would share this with all of you in hopes you could<br/>
&gt; enlighten me with some inspiring words.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband called his ex-wifes house to talk to the children. His ex-<br/>
&gt; wife was at the her the end of her ropes with the children (both<br/>
&gt; boys 15 and 11) who are doing horribly in school. She was looking<br/>
&gt; for my husband to rescue her and like I said many times before to<br/>
&gt; both of them is all I can do is offer to keep the boys with me to<br/>
&gt; homeschool (unschool)them with my 7 year old son. Of course they are<br/>
&gt; still trying to grasp the whole concept of homeschool so I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; scare them with the word unschool as of yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course my husband would want nothing more than to have them here<br/>
&gt; but his ex-wife is dead against it (right now anyway). She wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get all that lovely $$ support (another story - another list). As<br/>
&gt; for me I know they could benifit just from being out of the school<br/>
&gt; system and it would be a BIG ADJUSTMENT but I am sure it would be a<br/>
&gt; learning exsperoence for all. I would be willing to take on the<br/>
&gt; challange though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have gone through this before this many tmes and life just goes<br/>
&gt; on and on.  This time she said to my husband that she wants all four<br/>
&gt; of us to get together and talk. I say to my husband I whole<br/>
&gt; different philosophy on school and education why the hell would you<br/>
&gt; want to get together and talk with me or why would I want to talk<br/>
&gt; with you ???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I was wondering if you had any suggestions. I thought all I<br/>
&gt; can do is offer my life style and what I believe in and they can do<br/>
&gt; what they want with it.  Does anyone have any complicated blended<br/>
&gt; family stories to share about unschooling ?? Does anyone unschool<br/>
&gt; their stepchildren at all ?? I thought if she is desparate she might<br/>
&gt; take me up on the offer.  I know she would never dream of doing it<br/>
&gt; herself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you ,<br/>
&gt; Sonya<br/>
&gt;<br/>
