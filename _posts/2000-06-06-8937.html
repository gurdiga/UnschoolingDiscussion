<div id="ygrps-yiv-934492255">&lt;That&#39;s what my days look like with my 2 and 3 year olds.  Except you<br/>
left out the part about dirt, brushing dirt off them, &lt;wiping dirt off<br/>
them, shaking dirt out of their clothes, brushing dirt off me, washing<br/>
dirt off everyone with the hose, &lt;pounding dirt out of shoes, etc.  Maybe<br/>
that is just a circumstance of having boys though.  LOL<br/>

What - do you mean I am supposed to clean the dirt off my kids?  No<br/>
wonder we get so many strange looks...&lt;G&gt;<br/>
