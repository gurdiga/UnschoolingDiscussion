My oldest (only 6) knows that it is good to eat when you are hungry, but<br/>
to not eat when you aren&#39;t hungry.  She has understood this her whole<br/>
life.  I breastfed her on demand as a baby and she feeds herself on<br/>
demand now.  She understands her bodies cues.  If only we all did!  (I&#39;m<br/>
still relearning my own body cues.)  <br/>
<br/>
As for unhealthy ingredients (partially hydrogenated oils, etc.), if you<br/>
don&#39;t buy it, they can&#39;t eat vast quantities of it (while they are<br/>
little).  We buy lots of snack foods in this household, but my 6 yo<br/>
would rather have a piece of fruit.  The inevitable goldfish cracker (or<br/>
whatever) will show up around other people (Grandparents, Girl Scouts,<br/>
etc.) and I don&#39;t forbid it and I usually have a few myself, but we have<br/>
discussed it and consider those foods to be foods that are only eaten<br/>
once in a while (and not every day).  I &quot;forced&quot; my infants/toddlers to<br/>
have a vegetarian diet, but as soon as my 6 yo started asking about<br/>
foods that other people were eating, we allowed her to make that choice<br/>
herself (at first she thought that it was a joke that people ate meat,<br/>
she just couldn&#39;t fathom someone wanting to eat a chicken).  She has<br/>
chosen vegetarianism on her own and should she change her mind I will<br/>
voice my opinions, but it is her life ultimately.  (And I won&#39;t shame<br/>
her, afterall I ate all meats until just before she was born)<br/>
<br/>
It is our responsibility as parents to let our children know how we feel<br/>
about various issues, whether that be food, religion, schooling, or<br/>
whatever.  We cannot force our children to have the same views, but they<br/>
should be aware of why we are living the way we are (they have a right<br/>
to know what makes us tick!).  I don&#39;t lecture my kids, but they see me<br/>
looking at bags in the grocery store and ask what it is that I am<br/>
looking for and I tell them and they help find the alternatives that are<br/>
the healthiest for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that my children are at a huge food advantage over myself.  I<br/>
truly had no idea what a healthy diet looked like as a child and most<br/>
children nowadays still don&#39;t.  It is a shame since that information is<br/>
so readily available.  Funny story:  kids and adults were talking about<br/>
Ding-Dongs and Ho-Hos and Twinkies in front of my daughter.  She asked<br/>
what they were and we told her, she thought that it might be fun to try<br/>
them sometime.  So, next time we saw them in the store, we bought some. <br/>
She tried a bit of each and about gagged.  She thought the Twinkie<br/>
tasted like air and the Ho-Ho and Ding-Dong tasted like plastic.  She<br/>
wonders why anyone would want to eat things with virtually no flavor and<br/>
she immediately stopped eating them.  DH and I, however, remember how<br/>
these were the best food in our childhoods (and how they were rationed<br/>
out and made out to be SO GOOD).<br/>

subscribing to cable tv and only buying education videos, because you <br/>
don&#39;t think that tv is good for kids?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I&#39;ve missed some more buildup or some good responses.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable because it&#39;s expensive and we can get reception without <br/>
it.  We think TV is fine and dandy for kids.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t buy all the food in the whole store, but kids can request things.  <br/>
If I&#39;m willing to get them whatever they ask for, then what I choose to buy <br/>
in addition to that is bought because I know they&#39;ll eat it, it&#39;s good for <br/>
them, it&#39;s not expensive that week, whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Giving kids freedom doesn&#39;t require hauling every item on earth into the <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t just buy &quot;educational videos,&quot; because some of them are NOT <br/>
educational, they&#39;re boring and irritating and turn kids off to the subject <br/>
matter.  Any book or video that&#39;s called anything vaguely resembling &quot;History <br/>
can be Interesting!&quot; or &quot;Math doesn&#39;t have to Suck!&quot; does NOT make it into my <br/>
house, as they are predicated on the idea that history is NOT interesting and <br/>
math DOES suck.<br/>
<br/>
My kids like musicals and we have lots of them.  If they liked musicals and I <br/>
hated them (as my parents did) and I refused to have any, that would be tacky <br/>
on my part, and selfish, and non-productive.   But I&#39;ve known them their <br/>
whole lives and I know what they like.<br/>
<br/>
And to tie into just about every other thread for a week, one of the musicals <br/>
we have in our collection is &quot;South Park:  Bigger, Longer and Uncut.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never coerced them into watching it.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t force them to eat the food we have.  The way they signal us not to <br/>
buy it is not to eat it.  The way they teach us what to buy is by what they <br/>
eat.  Our regular &quot;staple&quot; quick kid-foods are individual pizzas, <br/>
chimichangas, hot pockets, hot dogs, and sandwich stuff.  Dr Pepper goes.  <br/>
Organic various-flavored stuff goes when there are big groups of kids, but <br/>
not for individual kids, so I guess they drink that stuff to show off for the <br/>
couple of health-food kids in the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere between saying &quot;NO, not in MY house&quot; and driving kids out to look <br/>
for crack and prostitutes is a happy medium.  <br/>
<br/>
If each desire or item or experiment is dealt with on its own merits, with <br/>
advice and discussion between the children and parents, I don&#39;t see it as <br/>
coercion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118779010"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But when you don&#39;t buy certain things that you know your kids would<br/>
&gt; like to eat, isn&#39;t that a kind of subtle coercion?  Kind of not<br/>
&gt; subscribing to cable tv and only buying education videos, because you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think that tv is good for kids?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see your point, but no.  I really don&#39;t think my kids would like<br/>
coffee, or whole cow&#39;s milk, or white bread, etc. (just examples that I<br/>
can think of off the top of my head).  Why would they like them?  I<br/>
don&#39;t.  I buy my kids every kind of food that I think that they would<br/>
like (sometimes they do and sometimes they don&#39;t and they NEVER have to<br/>
eat it) and we are always exploring new foods (some healthy, some not so<br/>
much, but none dangerous) to try to find new ones that we&#39;ll like.  I<br/>
buy a bunch of things that *only* the kids like, too.  However, they do<br/>
happen to be relatively heathy.  Would I buy cigarettes for my kids just<br/>
because they *might* like them?  Uh, no.  And, chances are, without<br/>
social forces to help them like bad things, they probably never will<br/>
(&quot;bad&quot;, of course, being very relative).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, we don&#39;t subscribe to cable tv.  I don&#39;t think that too much<br/>
television is good for anyone, and being that my children are only 6 and<br/>
2, it is my job as a parent to help them determine the quantity and<br/>
quality of the television and the food that the like.  There are many<br/>
sides to this, including finances.  I will, of course, admit to not<br/>
knowing every single television show or food item out there and I am<br/>
always open for suggestions to new ones (and my children are, too, but<br/>
they are quite good at walking away from the ones that they don&#39;t like).<br/>
<br/>
Does this make since?  I&#39;d really like to know if someone feels this is<br/>
not an unschooling approach and why.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks.<br/>

<br/>
Since you asked, :-) &quot;I don&#39;t think&quot;  and &quot;it is my job to <br/>
determine&quot; are not my idea of radical unschooling approaches. It was <br/>
never my job to say how much tv was good for Laurie or what food she <br/>
would like. Everything was available and she chose wisely. It&#39;s when <br/>
people censor what someone sees, says or eats that the curiosity <br/>
peaks and it becomes almost an obsession to obtain or see the <br/>
forbidden. And if they decide they want it, it then becomes a moral <br/>
quandary for them. Do I do what I want to do and hide it from Mom <br/>
and lie about it if I&#39;m caught?  Or do I just accept that Mom is the <br/>
authority that I dare not cross? Neither one creates trust and <br/>
friendship with your children.<br/>
love, Valerie</div>
