<div id="ygrps-yiv-83273704">+++&gt;As a religious belief - it&#39;s a nice one. Problem is, they claim it is science based on quantum physics.&lt;+++<br/>
<br/>
I think science is it&#39;s own form of religion. I don&#39;t know enough about quantum physics to make any kind of *educated* statement on it. Neither are of that much interest to me personally other than I&#39;m interested in why people are so interested in them. <br/>
<br/>

Maybe it is to them, that is not a threat to me...or what I or my family do. I just don&#39;t see it as a problem. Maybe it&#39;s easier for me to come to that point of view because I&#39;m newer to unschooling and I don&#39;t feel any kind of vested interest or ownership about what it means. Maybe not. <br/>
<br/>
I can certainly understand/get the perspective. I just don&#39;t share it. <br/>

===&gt;It&#39;s clearly not a threat to me - my unschooled <br/>

<br/>
But you are paid to speak about unschooling, yes? <br/>
<br/>
My children are currently unschooling. We do *not* do/invoke/whatever the Law of Attraction component. We do have friends that do, good friends. And they remain our friends and support us even though that piece is not a part of our life. <br/>
<br/>
===&gt;The problem is that people come across <br/>
radical-unschooling-law-of-attraction-style and think that is what <br/>
radical unschooling is. &lt;===<br/>
<br/>
Those are people who are only looking at the surface. There are also people, I&#39;m sure who come to unschooling *because* of the Law of Attraction component. It could be a gateway. I don&#39;t personally understand the connection (at all) but other people do. If it leads them to a more peaceful loving life with their children. That&#39;s great, from my perspective. What if one of your *kids* (I realize they are grown now) had a sudden interest in Law of Attraction? Would you honor that interest? <br/>
<br/>
===&gt;If they aren&#39;t interested in accepting the Law <br/>
of Attraction belief system, they can be turned off of unschooling.&lt;===<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s unfortunate but I would argue their interest wasn&#39;t that strong to begin with. And probably not open enough to *get* unschooling (at least the whole life unschooling) if they already have such a strong negative attachment to it. <br/>
<br/>
===&gt; In case you think that&#39;s not likely, I&#39;ve already had people tell me that <br/>
they would not unschool because it is associated with a bunch of <br/>
new-agey stuff.&quot;&lt;===<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s likely. I don&#39;t dispute you on that at all. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen that before. I am sure some of those people just were not open to unschooling at all and maybe that was just an excuse used to avoid discussing it further? <br/>
<br/>
I will say that although I call myself new to unschooling. I first joined an unschooling over four years ago. I have been a reading member of this list since the summer of 2008? I have only in the last year and a half embrassed the term unschooling for our family...however well before that I would say we are &quot;unschooly.&quot; We have been living without curriculum for over three years now and my kids are 15, 13 & 12. <br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest turn-offs for new unschoolers that *I* have seen (you have way more experience with this but I do actually meet a lot of almost unschoolers or interested in unschooling through my activism here in NH)...anyway....the biggest turn-off I&#39;ve seen and heard is about *unschooling dogma* or about judgments from other unschooling parents. <br/>
<br/>
===&gt;I think the point may have been misunderstood. I doubt anybody here<br/>
objects to people choosing to believe in anything they choose to believe<br/>
in, including the law of attraction, libertarianism, or anything else.&lt;===<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I have to say here is...libertarian thought/philosophy (again I&#39;m not talking about the Libertarian political party either) is just that it is *not* religion or a *belief system* it&#39;s a philosophy. It&#39;s not based on anything spiritual or supernatural or whatever. It&#39;s a philosophical perspective on governing people. Much like unschooling is a philosophical perspective on parenting. <br/>
<br/>
===&gt;I think it is unethical for people to go around identifying unschooling<br/>
with the law of attraction or with libertarianism or Christianity or any<br/>
other particular belief system.00&lt;===<br/>
<br/>
Unethical? Really...why? I am totally bewildered. And to stay on topic how does that make you a better unschooling parent? Is grouping it with mindfulness (and yes, I read the explanation on page 199 of Sandra&#39;s book), Attachment Parenting or La Leche League...unethical? <br/>
<br/>
I truly do not understand. I&#39;m open to hearing though...and I hope that I have not come of angry, upset or otherwise...I am enjoying the discussion (although, I&#39;m very concerned about being unintentionally hurtful - email can be a challenging medium in that way).<br/>

-=-&quot;selfish attitude&quot; ? because I *choose* to not allow other people&#39;s  <br/>

<br/>
No.  Not because of that.  Because you seemed to be saying that if it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t bother you, it shouldn&#39;t bother anyone.<br/>
<br/>
It might not bother an individual mom that the hospital gave her a  <br/>
case of free formula and her baby shower was mostly baby bottles, even  <br/>
though she intends to breastfeed.  She might give all that stuff away  <br/>
without another thought, and breastfeed without a problem in the world.<br/>
<br/>
That wouldn&#39;t change the fact that those &#39;gifts&#39; from the hospital,  <br/>
and that family-and-friends pressure is harmful to breastfeeding in  <br/>
general.<br/>
<br/>
Pam&#39;s kids are grown.  Joyce&#39;s daughter is grown.  My kids are grown.   <br/>
We&#39;re still helping other people understand unschooling.  Many others  <br/>
are here too whose kids are teens, who have been examining unschooling  <br/>
carefully, and sharing with others, for five or ten years or more.   <br/>
They can help more easily if the topic can be seen more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
If it doesn&#39;t hurt your unschooling, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s in no  <br/>
danger of keeping others from understanding unschooling as directly  <br/>
and clearly as possible, for the good of their children and of  <br/>
peaceful relationships in their family.<br/>

Selfish in the sense that you don&#39;t care if others might be misled, <br/>
confused, or deterred, as long as it doesn&#39;t affect your own family.<br/>

&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?  I sometimes have gotten to go to conferences without paying the <br/>
registration fee (always for me, sometimes for my family) and sometimes <br/>
they give me a hotel room for all or part of the conference. Sometimes I <br/>
get reimbursed for part of my transportation costs and occasionally some <br/>
food expenses. I don&#39;t think I  have ever even broken even - it has <br/>
always ended up costing me to speak at a conference.<br/>
<br/>
Did you picture unschooling speakers as out there making big bucks on <br/>
the speaker circuit? There are those who seem to be trying to do that, <br/>
but I doubt they&#39;re making much. I like it that unschooling is mostly <br/>
not being touted by people making a bunch of money off it. With no <br/>
vested financial interest, I&#39;m free to say what I want to say.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My children are currently unschooling. We do*not*  do/invoke/whatever the Law of Attraction component. We do have friends that do, good friends. And they remain our friends and support us even though that piece is not a part of our life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like people who have chosen to be as positive as possible. Makes them <br/>
nice to hang out with. But, so what? I have all kinds of friends with <br/>
all kinds of beliefs. We&#39;re not talking about who to be friends with.<br/>
<br/>
  I put a fairly large amount of time and effort into helping people <br/>
better understand unschooling. Some people promote their own brand of <br/>
unschooling (unschooling libertarians, unschooling through Law of <br/>
Attraction, unschooling Christianity, etc) in the news media,  to the <br/>
public, to people online, etc. and call it unschooling - as if their <br/>
personal belief system, philosophy, political agenda, or religion are <br/>
part and parcel OF unschooling, in general.  I don&#39;t like it and I think <br/>
they should make it clear that they are not, in fact, talking just about <br/>
unschooling. I think they muddy the waters and that it is already <br/>
difficult enough to talk clearly about unschooling and they make it <br/>
harder when they don&#39;t distinguish between what they, themselves, <br/>
believe in versus what unschooling is.<br/>

were having serious problems at school and parents considered <br/>
homeschooling, but the only homeschoolers they came across identified <br/>
homeschooling as something for Christians. That kept people from <br/>
pursuing homeschooling, sometimes for years.<br/>

care that I was clear about that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And to stay on topic how does that make you a better unschooling parent?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If someone claimed to be talking about unschooling, but instead talked <br/>
about attachment parenting, then yes. Most people involved in attachment <br/>
parenting don&#39;t even homeschool, much less unschool. If they claimed <br/>
unschooling was the same as breastfeeding? Huh?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have my own personal political and religious beliefs. I have shared <br/>
almost none of that on any unschooling lists. It isn&#39;t relevant to those <br/>
who don&#39;t share them with me and I&#39;m not here to persuade or argue <br/>
religion or politics.  If I wanted to talk with other unschoolers about <br/>
how unschooling relates to my own particular religious or political <br/>
beliefs, I&#39;d make it clear that that is what we were talking about and <br/>
they could choose to participate or not.  I don&#39;t NEED people to share <br/>
my political or religious beliefs in order to talk with them about <br/>
unschooling, though. If I say I&#39;m talking about unschooling, I don&#39;t <br/>
push my politics or my religion as if they are unschooling. I don&#39;t <br/>
claim that unschooling combined with my belief systems (political or <br/>
religious) is more advanced unschooling.<br/>

Some people promote their own brand of unschooling (unschooling libertarians, unschooling through Law of Attraction, unschooling Christianity, etc) in the news media,  to the public, to people online, etc. and call it unschooling - as if their personal belief system, philosophy, political agenda, or religion are part and parcel OF unschooling, in general.  I don&#39;t like it and I think they should make it clear that they are not, in fact, talking just about unschooling. I think they muddy the waters and that it is already difficult enough to talk clearly about unschooling and they make it harder when they don&#39;t distinguish between what they, themselves, believe in versus what unschooling is.<br/>

You see labels for different types of homeschoolers:  Secular homeschoolers, Christian homeschoolers, Eclectic homeschoolers, Classical homeschoolers, etc.  All of which give you a general idea of where they&#39;re coming from.  <br/>
<br/>
If you see someone who has entwined say, a firm belief in Zeus and daily worship rituals of him and his Mount Olympus pals with their unschooling lifestyle, and they called themselves Zeusite Unschoolers would that be a big enough distinction for you?  Or do you still think it would be misleading?  Because I think if I were unfamiliar with unschooling but read someone calling themselves a Zeusizte Unschooler I might google to see what other kinds of unschooling groups there were rather than just assume unschooling equaled praying to ancient Greek gods.<br/>

I know many homeschoolers crave some kind of title, some label - just so they can explain, in a tidy, neat way what they are about.<br/>

I just was reading through the Always Learning archives and I wanted  <br/>
to drop you a note to say your list is like a breath of fresh air to  <br/>
me. I spend a lot of time talking to unschoolers, and a decent-sized  <br/>
portion of them are caught up in moral panics and eco-panics and other  <br/>
things they stress over more than they analyze. Thank you for keeping  <br/>
the logic and the actual facts in unschooling, even if it irritates  <br/>
some people. I&#39;d be sad to see unschooling become only a fringe-y  <br/>
hippie thing, and I personally would never have started going to  <br/>
conferences or become friends with... [all the] awesome unschoolers I  <br/>
know, if I hadn&#39;t found your site and list first. The panicky people  <br/>
would&#39;ve driven me away real fast. So thank you!<br/>

On a different forum this week someone has recommended that a mom  <br/>
&quot;needs to&quot; have a vision of who she wants to become, and should cut  <br/>
magazine pictures out of people she wants to be like, but replace  <br/>
their head with a photo of her head.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s bullshit.   I think that would be setting a TERRIBLE  <br/>
example for one&#39;s children.  Should my kids be spending time trying to  <br/>
make themselves actresses or rock stars or rich people by magazine- <br/>
collage-magic?  My kids are all happy to be who they are, and that&#39;s  <br/>
healthy.  When I&#39;ve been wishing I would be different, here is exactly  <br/>
what I did:  I changed the way I was making decisions, and then I was  <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
Action, not magic.<br/>
Attitude and understanding, not wishing and hoping.<br/>
<br/>
 From the quote above:  &quot;... things they stress over more than they  <br/>
analyze&quot;--<br/>
Not everyone is analytical, that&#39;s true.  And no one unschools in a  <br/>
vacuum without any other influences or beliefs, hobbies, religion or  <br/>
politics.   But stress is bad for unschooling.  Fearful reactivity is  <br/>
bad for unschooling.<br/>

There is just each reader&#39;s capacity for recognizing integrity and  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838478751">For me, it would be more interesting NOT to label ourselves beyond the word<br/>
unschooling or unschoolers. That way there aren&#39;t MORE divisions to think<br/>
about. I would imagine a group that says it&#39;s LoA Unschoolers or Christian<br/>
Unschoolers ... well that would me anyone in that group would prefer NOT to<br/>
associate with unschoolers who aren&#39;t Christians or who aren&#39;t practicing<br/>
LoA.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing&#39;s wrong with that if we want to belong to sectioned off groups.<br/>
That&#39;s not unlike Christians who are so sectarian that they actually dislike<br/>
other types of Christians and won&#39;t associate with them.<br/>

people are doing it or not, but here are some notes on differences  <br/>
between unschooling and similarish things:<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s interesting!  Something that&#39;s bothered me more and more over the last couple of years, in unschooling discussions, is this idea that some parents are just afraid to do something &quot;wrong&quot; to or for their kids.<br/>
<br/>
It fascinates me that a mom or dad would panic at giving a child a suggestion thinking that it might be too coersive or too this or too that.  That&#39;s so weird to me!  My kids know exactly how I feel about things.  I don&#39;t hesitate to say &quot;no, bad idea.&quot;, but then leave the actual decision to my child.  Generally, they listen to me and take my advice.  Sometimes they have really good advice in return.  I see that as a direct relation to how I&#39;ve given my opinions and advice, that they can in turn do the same!<br/>
<br/>
If one of my kids was deeply troubled by something and my advice was to help them make a collage of wishful thinking, they&#39;d likely be really pissed with me.  What they want is an ear and honesty, straight from my heart.  In any conversation or at any time during any moment of any day, we can, each of us, wish for things and keep those wishes near and dear.  When you can keep them near and dear, they are much more likely to come to fruition, and when they don&#39;t, it&#39;s still nice to think about.<br/>

seen suggestions of additional ideas that a person might want to <br/>
consider. I&#39;ve occasionally seen someone say, &quot;That&#39;s not unschooling.&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s because there are people who say, &quot;We unschool, except I do make <br/>
the kids do math and I make sure they do some writing each day and blah <br/>
blah blah.&quot; Yeah, well, that really is NOT unschooling. Sometimes we <br/>
discuss whether people who have children who aren&#39;t school age yet <br/>
should or should not refer to themselves as unschoolers. No consensus on <br/>
that one - good points on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
I know people who identify as Christian unschoolers, Baha&#39;i unschoolers, <br/>
African-American unschoolers, Southern California unschoolers, and so on <br/>
- all perfectly happy to self-identify, and when they are talking <br/>
specifically about their own &quot;brand&quot; of unschooling, they are clear <br/>
about it. But there are just some people who don&#39;t have the sense or <br/>
courtesy or honesty or something - to do that. I don&#39;t know if it is <br/>
because they think &quot;their&quot; particular brand of unschooling is &quot;the&quot; <br/>
right one or they just don&#39;t care that it causes confusion and is <br/>
misleading or what.<br/>
