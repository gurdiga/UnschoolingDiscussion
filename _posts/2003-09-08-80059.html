<h4>The Burton Bunch</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102940444">We received a letter in the mail inviting ds to travel and study in Australia and New Zealand in 2004 with other &quot;outstanding middle school students&quot; eligible for People to People, an educational exploration program founded by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.......recommended for the honor by a teacher, former Student Ambassador or national educational listing organization.  Has anyone else received or know of this organization?  We also received a call recently from someone wanting us to host a foreign exchange student.....said we were a recommended family by our local school district.  My question, I guess, is this just a coincidence......mass mailing.......etc.?  We are NOT involved whatsoever with the local school district and haven&#39;t been since January 2000.  We are not well known in our community as we live in a rural area.....<br/>
Any help/info much appreciated!<br/>

We get things like that too. We also get mail from charter schools, <br/>
independent schools and such. The letters are mass mailed, I&#39;m sure. The charter and <br/>
independent school mail always has a catchy flier and a letter that always <br/>
starts out; &quot;Dear Homeschooler, We know you value your children&#39;s education. That <br/>
is why we feel our school is exactly what you are looking for....&quot; Darin asked <br/>
me this summer, after the fifth or so letters like this, if they thought this <br/>
was THE one that would lure us back. I said it wouldn&#39;t get us back, but it <br/>
might get some school-at-home types that are unsure back. The letters promise <br/>
you can retain your homeschooling status (falsely) and still use their <br/>
innovative program at home, that sounds grand to some folks. <br/>
<br/>
If you live in a state where you have to register, even like Kansas where the <br/>
registration is a one time thing, I think the state school board sells their <br/>
lists as well. So that maybe another place where places like this get our <br/>
names and addresses.<br/>
