<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142496617">Hi Valerie,<br/>
It is refreshing to have someone that&#39;s been-there, done-that!  I can&#39;t wait for your book to come out.  I know there are other books out there of successful homeschooled kids, but we need all the ammo and information we can get to support our cause (unschooling), and use as a reference to help alleviate our own misguided fears about unschooling.  And we can always use some tips! So, when is it coming out?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793871793">Hi Kim,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much! I had no trepidation sitting down to write this <br/>
book because I figured if no one was interested, then I would gladly <br/>
be spending the time writing it just for Laurie. <br/>
<br/>
How I wish I had someone like me to ask about unschooling when I was <br/>
actually doing it. For some reason, I never had any doubts or fears <br/>
about anything. Weird considering I felt like I was the only person <br/>
on the planet unschooling. PLEASE ask me anything.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure when it&#39;s coming out. Laurie and I are cleaning it up during <br/>
the last two weeks in May, then it&#39;ll go to the publisher. I have to <br/>
think of a name for it. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>

Not to be picky, but I&#39;m just so tired of subtitles on everything. It makes<br/>
it look like the TV movie of the week. I like just one simple title. Let the<br/>
book explain it.<br/>

Title, and just about sums up what we are all doing! <br/>
I am afraid that it might turn off those we wish to <br/>
(for lack of a better word) Educate!  The general<br/>
public tends to not understand what we are doing or<br/>
why.  I LOVE the Title, that is the way we all feel,<br/>
obviously, or we would not be unschooling.  But, for<br/>
those people who are not familiar with or comfortable<br/>
with unschooling, I think that it could turn them off!<br/>
It may come across as snooty or a We are Right you are<br/>
Wrong kinda thing!<br/>
<br/>
Just My Opinion! *smile*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-637657323">I&#39;ve also thought about using the words from my mom. After 18 years <br/>
of thinking I was nuts for unschooling, Laurie and I were sitting <br/>
with her at the dining table. Laurie was exuberantly talking about <br/>
how much fun she was having in classes. Mom just looked at me and <br/>
said, &quot;How did you know?&quot;   That validated it all for me. <br/>

&gt; Title, and just about sums up what we are all doing! <br/>
&gt; I am afraid that it might turn off those we wish to <br/>
&gt; (for lack of a better word) Educate!  The general<br/>
&gt; public tends to not understand what we are doing or<br/>
&gt; why.  I LOVE the Title, that is the way we all feel,<br/>
&gt; obviously, or we would not be unschooling.  But, for<br/>
&gt; those people who are not familiar with or comfortable<br/>
&gt; with unschooling, I think that it could turn them off!<br/>
&gt; It may come across as snooty or a We are Right you are<br/>
&gt; Wrong kinda thing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just My Opinion! *smile*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501911441">Hi Valerie,<br/>
Yes, I know what you mean about not having someone to ask about unschooling.  There are many homeschoolers now that provide support, but I think the unschooling movement is coming about too slowly!  But when I hear what you have done with your DD I think, &quot;Yeah, I did this right, or I was doing that right, I should continue!&quot;  Although I must admit, I am still having a hard time with the fact that my kids shouldn&#39;t help out with the housework!  They dirty up dishes just like the rest of the family, so they should have a turn washing them.  That is the least liked job around here!<br/>
I think I would be a lot more comfortable just letting my kids do whatever they wanted to all day long, if it weren&#39;t for my DH.  That is the real obstacle to the kids totally unschooling.  My oldest DD still makes out schedules and asks me to find out what she should be learning for her grade.  That is fine, she can learn what she wants when and how.  But the problem is, she is trying to do that with my younger DD, who hates schedules and curricula.  I have a feeling my DH is behind that!  How did you deal with your DH in unschooling?  Was he totally behind you in your unschooling endeavor with your DD?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, a title for your book?  It should sound something like a lifelong unfettered learning process.  I think the majority of the people are just now starting to embrace the virtues of homeschooling, but most are not ready to accept unschooling, even amongst homeschoolers!  Although I seem to see a trend in homeschoolers; First they start off with a duplicate curriculum of the ps system, then they trust themselves to do their own curriculum, then they proceed on to let the child direct their own curriculum, then they finally evolve to set their child totally free.<br/>
I can&#39;t wait for your book!<br/>

Hi Kim,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much! I had no trepidation sitting down to write this <br/>
book because I figured if no one was interested, then I would gladly <br/>
be spending the time writing it just for Laurie. <br/>
<br/>
How I wish I had someone like me to ask about unschooling when I was <br/>
actually doing it. For some reason, I never had any doubts or fears <br/>
about anything. Weird considering I felt like I was the only person <br/>
on the planet unschooling. PLEASE ask me anything.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure when it&#39;s coming out. Laurie and I are cleaning it up during <br/>
the last two weeks in May, then it&#39;ll go to the publisher. I have to <br/>
think of a name for it. Any ideas?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180074955">Yes Valerie, do tell about Dh recation to unschooling. My situation is similar to Kim&#39;s in that my oldes daughter requets schedules. I don&#39;t mind it for her because she wants it, but she often pressures her brothers to do what she thinks they should do. My husband has not completely agreed to unschooling and he asks what are the kids learning what oar you teaching questions a lot. <br/>

  Hi Valerie,<br/>
  Yes, I know what you mean about not having someone to ask about unschooling.  There are many homeschoolers now that provide support, but I think the unschooling movement is coming about too slowly!  But when I hear what you have done with your DD I think, &quot;Yeah, I did this right, or I was doing that right, I should continue!&quot;  Although I must admit, I am still having a hard time with the fact that my kids shouldn&#39;t help out with the housework!  They dirty up dishes just like the rest of the family, so they should have a turn washing them.  That is the least liked job around here!<br/>
  I think I would be a lot more comfortable just letting my kids do whatever they wanted to all day long, if it weren&#39;t for my DH.  That is the real obstacle to the kids totally unschooling.  My oldest DD still makes out schedules and asks me to find out what she should be learning for her grade.  That is fine, she can learn what she wants when and how.  But the problem is, she is trying to do that with my younger DD, who hates schedules and curricula.  I have a feeling my DH is behind that!  How did you deal with your DH in unschooling?  Was he totally behind you in your unschooling endeavor with your DD?<br/>
<br/>
  Hmmm, a title for your book?  It should sound something like a lifelong unfettered learning process.  I think the majority of the people are just now starting to embrace the virtues of homeschooling, but most are not ready to accept unschooling, even amongst homeschoolers!  Although I seem to see a trend in homeschoolers; First they start off with a duplicate curriculum of the ps system, then they trust themselves to do their own curriculum, then they proceed on to let the child direct their own curriculum, then they finally evolve to set their child totally free.<br/>
  I can&#39;t wait for your book!<br/>

  Hi Kim,<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you so much! I had no trepidation sitting down to write this <br/>
  book because I figured if no one was interested, then I would gladly <br/>
  be spending the time writing it just for Laurie. <br/>
<br/>
  How I wish I had someone like me to ask about unschooling when I was <br/>
  actually doing it. For some reason, I never had any doubts or fears <br/>
  about anything. Weird considering I felt like I was the only person <br/>
  on the planet unschooling. PLEASE ask me anything.<br/>
<br/>
  Not sure when it&#39;s coming out. Laurie and I are cleaning it up during <br/>
  the last two weeks in May, then it&#39;ll go to the publisher. I have to <br/>
  think of a name for it. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
