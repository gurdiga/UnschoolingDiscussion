<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214253212">While reading Curious George to my five year old son tonight, I realized what a metaphor it is for the natural inquisitiveness of children and the public school system.  George is a curious little monkey happy in the jungle until the man in the yellow hat (society) takes him away to &quot;civilization&quot; to live in a zoo(public school), ostensibly where he will be much happier.  George&#39;s natural curiousity continues unabated in the big city until finally the man in the yellow hat re-captures him and takes him to the zoo.   <br/>
  <br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think this book is a classic and my son loves it.  I think it struck me because when reading it again as an adult it just hit me how similar George is to my little boy who has weathered much in his little life and has yet to encounter public school.  I don&#39;t want to put him in the zoo.  I prefer the wilds of the jungle and all that it offers...<br/>

This is great! And George always gets into trouble because he is so curios, which is so like my children ;)  I love your analogy...<br/>
