<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786091429">When my dd was 9, she enjoyed anything I would read aloud, like The True<br/>
Confessions of Charlotte Doyle or Rifles for Waite.  She continues to enjoy<br/>
the Lemony Snickett books.<br/>
<br/>
When she was about that age, she read The Outsiders over and over again.<br/>

Harry Potter<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a dd who is intensely into Harry Potter, and I understand that<br/>
&gt; there are all kinds of literature from various countries woven throughout<br/>
&gt; the Harry Potter books.  Some are Norse legends.  So, I was curious what<br/>
&gt; your children are reading.  My daughter is 9, and I&#39;m looking for content<br/>
&gt; that would be appropriate for a 9yo&#39;s sensibilities although lately she<br/>
&gt; seems to be able to handle scary stuff, which most of history seems to<br/>
&gt; be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks, Ruth<br/>
