<div id="ygrps-yiv-567927171"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&#39;Twas the night before Christmas, when all thru the abode<br/>
&gt; Only one creature was stirring, & she was cleaning the<br/>
&gt; commode. The children were finally sleeping, all snug in their beds,<br/>
&gt; while visions of Nintendo 64 & Barbie, flipped through their heads.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The dad was snoring in front of the TV,<br/>
&gt; with a half-constructed bicycle propped on his knee.<br/>
&gt; So only the mom heard the reindeer hooves clatter,<br/>
&gt; which made her sigh, &quot;Now what is the matter?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With toilet bowl brush still clutched in her hand,<br/>
&gt;She descended the stairs, & saw the old man.<br/>
&gt; He was covered with ashes & soot, which fell with a shrug,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Oh great,&quot; muttered the mom, &quot;Now I have to clean the rug.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Ho Ho Ho!&quot; cried Santa, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re awake.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;your gift was especially difficult to make.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Thanks, Santa, but all I want is time alone.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Exactly!&quot; he chuckled, &quot;So, I&#39;ve made you a clone.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;A clone?&quot; she muttered, &quot;What good is that?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Run along, Santa, I&#39;ve no time for chit chat.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Then out walked the clone - The mother&#39;s twin,<br/>
&gt; Same hair, same eyes, same double chin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;She&#39;ll cook, she&#39;ll dust, she&#39;ll mop every mess.<br/>
&gt;You&#39;ll relax, take it easy, watch The Young & The Restless.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Fantastic!&quot; the mom cheered.  &quot;My dream has come true!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll shop, I&#39;ll read, I&#39;ll sleep a night through!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the room above, the youngest did fret.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Mommy?! Come quickly, I&#39;m scared & I&#39;m wet.&quot;<br/>
&gt; The clone replied, &quot;I&#39;m coming, sweetheart.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Hey,&quot; the mom smiled, &quot;She sure knows her part.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The clone changed the small one & hummed her tune,<br/>
&gt; as she bundled the child in a blanket cocoon.<br/>
&gt; &quot;You&#39;re the best mommy ever.  I really love you.&quot;<br/>
&gt; The clone smiled & sighed, &quot;And I love you, too.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The mom frowned & said, &quot;Sorry, Santa, no deal.&quot;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s my child&#39;s LOVE she is trying to steal.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Smiling wisely Santa said, &quot;To me it is clear,<br/>
&gt; Only one loving mother is needed here.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The mom kissed her child & tucked her in bed.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Thank You, Santa, for clearing my head.<br/>
&gt; I sometimes forget, it won&#39;t be very long,<br/>
&gt; when they&#39;ll be too old for my cradle & song.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The clock on the mantle began to chime.<br/>
&gt; Santa whispered to the clone, &quot;It works every time.&quot;<br/>
&gt; With the clone by his side Santa said &quot;Goodnight.<br/>
&gt; Merry Christmas, dear Mom, You will be all right.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes we need reminding of what life is all about.<br/>
&gt;Especially at times during the Holiday season, when all we seem<br/>
&gt; to do is clean and bake and shop and and and and and and and....<br/>
&gt; You get the picture, I&#39;m sure. So stop for a moment and hug that<br/>
&gt; little one so special, whether he/she is 2 or 22, or even older than<br/>
&gt; that. For they are the Gift that God gave us in life...and what a<br/>
<br/>
&gt; gift to be treasured, far above any other! May the real meaning of<br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving and Christmas be with you all this year, is my prayer.<br/>
&gt; And my love I also send with this holiday message. <br/>
&gt;To you, a friend I also treasure.<br/>
<br/>
