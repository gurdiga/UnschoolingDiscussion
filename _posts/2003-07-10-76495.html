<div id="ygrps-yiv-394862357">This reminds me of something I saw yesterday.  My neighbor was cutting grass <br/>
and turned under our tree and stirred up tons of dust.  As the dust was <br/>
moving I saw magical rays of sunlight shooting down through the tree.  They <br/>
were invisible before that.  It has been quite some time since I have been <br/>
excited to see such a thing.  I was amazed...I told the kids about it and <br/>
they did their usual &quot;wow, mom!&quot; but they didn&#39;t get to see it.  Wish I were <br/>
a painter, I would paint it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s easy to forget the sense of wonder that little ones have at what we<br/>
&gt; consider commonplace things. Everyday I go out to the chookpen to collect<br/>
&gt; the eggs. Everyday Mia (4) gets excited when we have eggs to bring in. <br/>
&gt; Every<br/>
&gt; time I bring home the shopping, the kids are clamouring to see what&#39;s in <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; shopping bags. It&#39;s the same when they watch a movie for the tenth time <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; get just as excited as they did the first time. They bring a sense of<br/>
&gt; newness to it.  Maybe it&#39;s that their senses haven&#39;t been dulled, they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; totally open.<br/>
