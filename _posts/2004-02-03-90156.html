&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       I&#39;ve seen this spelling of &quot;rein&quot; before, and thought I would comment <br/>
now because the present topic is subconscious meaning in the words we choose. <br/>
Spelling or word choice (as in homonyms) can reveal added meaning. <br/>
<br/>
       When parents see their job as &quot;reining&quot; then aren&#39;t they also setting <br/>
themselves up to &quot;reign?&quot;  If we don&#39;t wish to reign over our children like <br/>
monarchs, then perhaps we ought not center our parenting on reining in their <br/>
every move like horseback riders, either. The two concepts are congruent in a <br/>
subconscious way to me.<br/>
<br/>
       Also, posters here have referred to a &quot;mute&quot; point (the legal homonym <br/>
of  &quot;moot&quot;)  which in combined form nicely captures the idea of being silent <br/>
on a point about which further talk is useless. I had a colleague in financial <br/>
administration who used this homonym in meetings and always meant it <br/>
sincerely, pronouncing it &quot;mute&quot; -- mewt -- and imo using it correctly for his meaning! <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
       Another congruent combination I recall him coining was the word <br/>
&quot;lax-adaisical&quot; to combine lax and lackadaisical. That one always made me smile.<br/>
<br/>
       Anybody know any other word combinations with congruent meaning, from <br/>
your own experience? Enjoying this kind of thing is something unschoolers <br/>
particularly are good at imo -- just the kind of thing that standardized <br/>
curriculum and testing try to stamp out of our lives. <br/>
<br/>
       Btw, I also object to the way testing and standards ignore the <br/>
importance of a well developed sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
       I suppose there are a few folks who somehow thrive without a good <br/>
sense of humor, but it must be a real struggle! &lt;gg&gt;JJ<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have always considered my sense of humor an essential element in my life. I <br/>
don&#39;t know how I could have made it through raising six boys w/o it. I grew <br/>
up with three sisters, I do have one brother but our house was a woman&#39;s world <br/>
since we greatly outnumbered him. Having six sons has been an interesting, <br/>
hair-raising journey, it was the laughter that saved my sanity, LOL<br/>
