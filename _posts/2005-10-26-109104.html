<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941977018">Jackie has been drawing &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; pictures - 2 faces with one attractive and one not so.  She said that she keeps the eyes the same, so it will look like it is still the same person.  She was inspired by a TV show in which they stop someone on the street and redo their hair, makeup, and clothing.  We have noticed that they nearly always straighten curly hair and curl straight hair.  Whichever you happen to have is wrong.  Most people get a color job too.<br/>
