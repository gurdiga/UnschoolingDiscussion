Sure!<br/>

I love &quot;11:11&quot;--it&#39;s my favorite time (on a digital clock).<br/>
<br/>
IF someone walked in on you right now, that would be quite an invasion  <br/>
of your privacy and people are sleeping!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re imagining that you would feel judged, that&#39;s a whole wad of  <br/>
negative thinking.  Do something good with your time!   Look at them  <br/>
and how comfortable they are.  Read about the benefits of sleep, at  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724615728">I&#39;m learning more and more how I&#39;ve judged the holy-crap out of everything I<br/>
do and everything my kids do and so on.  So it&#39;s wonderful once again to<br/>
come on here and hear Sandra point out the whole &quot;WAD&quot; of negative thinking<br/>
that is.  The amazing thing about learning w/o limits is that we can do away<br/>
w/ so much of that.  Not easy by any means to do so but yes-definitely take<br/>
the time to think, contemplate, read up, do something especially opening to<br/>
counter that slew of judgment and negative head bashing while they sleep:-)<br/>
Mine are asleep right now because that;s the schedule we have - they are up<br/>
late reading, hearing books, watching good movies, playing..<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 I completely realize how long it&#39;s taken me to get over the mindset we have<br/>
that sleeping late is slacking-to see when it&#39;s not working for your life is<br/>
one thing but to feel automatic guilt and envision people coming over and<br/>
with alarm and shock perhaps call social services on you is another.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
this is funny, happened yesterday: I was in the shower at about 11 am and<br/>
kids were up , getting things done.. Door bell rings- *never happens*.. I<br/>
witness a certain amount of thoughts and behaviors for myself at this point<br/>
and I realize my kids will probably answer the door and one of the things<br/>
I&#39;m thinking( *BUT aware of it&#39;s fear-base*) Is&quot; What is it&#39;s Children and<br/>
Youth??- do my kids know enough not to let them in?&quot; (I&#39;ve had these<br/>
conversations w/ them)   After a few calls from the bathroom from me &quot;who is<br/>
it?&quot;,  I finally let it go.  My Daughter tells me then it was the neighbors<br/>
grown daughter coming to ask me about homeschooling.  Then, I am happily<br/>
envisioning how she may have gotten a small peak of what homeschooling could<br/>
look like : Fresh bread smells wafting from the kitchen, evidence of such,<br/>
mom getting shower at 11- kids politely answering door.. so that&#39;s the other<br/>
side of what our heads can do with judgment, lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12857744">My son was an early riser, winter and summer, until he became 13, now (18) he sleeps late every morning, unless he has an appointment. He wanted to sleep early in the evening as well (around 8 he was mostly asleep). My daughter was a late sleeper, more so in summer than in the winter, because she wants to sleep later in the evening and now ( 8) she goes to sleep between 10 and 12 and wakes between 8 and 10.<br/>
It helps to let them move in their own rhythm, their mood is much better during the day if the are allowed to wake in their own time.<br/>

<br/>
How can &quot;I get judged for that&quot;? be rephrased?<br/>
<br/>
I think people say &quot;people judge me&quot; as though there is a clear  <br/>
definition of the term.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes &quot;I feel self-conscious&quot; is stated as &quot;people judge me.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973019631">I feel the same when it comes to N&#39;s flexible sleep times. Its mostly about<br/>
how I should &#39;make&#39; him sleep earlier (among other things, like making him<br/>
in sit/stand to encourage sitting/standing, etc). I feel really defensive<br/>
and sometimes wish to act on those suggestions just to experience some<br/>
approval. I would like people to think nice things when it comes to my son,<br/>
see him as the wonderful child he is, rather than judge him as somehow<br/>
&#39;less&#39; because of something he does or doesn&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
In my saner moments, I know that if it isn&#39;t this, it will be that<br/>
(something else) and people who want to judge my parenting will find ways to<br/>
do it. I have a choice right here. Give up my hard-found authenticity and<br/>
begin selling out to bribe approval out of people or stay on my path and<br/>
remain open to a dialogue around beliefs and see if I end up learning things<br/>
that I can do without compromising values and convey the value I find in the<br/>
choices I am making. If nothing, I try to convey that it is not something I<br/>
do thoughtlessly, but a choice based on what I believe will be truly<br/>
empowering for him. It feels tough sometimes. When it feels like its too<br/>
much, I postpone the decision. Usually, I feel better in a while and the<br/>
problem doesn&#39;t seem as overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
I recognize this as my issue and discomfort, and let N live in peace,<br/>
according to how he is joyous and comfortable.<br/>

&#39;less&#39; because of something he does or doesn&#39;t do.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen more and more unschooled children I don&#39;t think reflect well  <br/>
on their parents or on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s someone I want to be around, or would prefer to avoid, I&#39;m  <br/>
not &quot;judging him&quot; so much as I&#39;m making decisions for my own life.   <br/>
It&#39;s possible for a person to choose and choose down into a hole where  <br/>
others aren&#39;t interested in hanging out.  Or to make too many choices  <br/>
toward doing EVERYthing anyone else wants them to do.<br/>
<br/>
There must be a balance, though.   People who can&#39;t or won&#39;t live with  <br/>
others become outcasts or hermits.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. Give up my hard-found authenticity and begin selling out to bribe  <br/>
approval out of people or ...<br/>
<br/>
TOO strong.  Too extreme.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve painted one end as &quot;authenticity&quot; (NOT a word I think people  <br/>
should move toward; it&#39;s not about clarity, it&#39;s about labelling and  <br/>
justifying), and the other as &quot;selling out&quot; and bribery.... that  <br/>
stance does not lead toward calm clarity.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If nothing, I try to convey that it is not something I<br/>
do thoughtlessly, but a choice based on what I believe will be truly<br/>
empowering for him.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Too much thought in a shrill or twisted direction moves further from  <br/>
empowerment and more toward living separate from the world around.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about learning in and from the world, not about seeing  <br/>
the world as the enemy.<br/>
