Hi!  I&#39;m in VA and would be happy to talk with you on or off-list.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been homeschooling/unschooling for 14 years here and have done it both under<br/>
the homeschool statute and with religious exemption.  I have helped lots of<br/>
people get started in whatever way they felt comfortable with (curriculum or<br/>
not, structure or not).  You can definitely learn a lot more about<br/>
unschooling from this list and the recommended websites, such as Sandra&#39;s,<br/>
than any one person could ever share.  But I can help you in understanding<br/>
VA law, alternatives to testing or alternative tests, and possibly answer<br/>
any questions that refer specifically to this state.<br/>
<br/>
Where in the state are you?  Some areas have more unschoolers than others;<br/>
most locales have support groups, but not all are very open to unschooling<br/>
ideas.  There are many groups that have a focus, such as various Christian<br/>
groups.  Have you met any homeschoolers/unschoolers in your area?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello Brenda Rose, I&#39;d appreciate the help.  We are in Hampton.  Where are <br/>
you?  We haven&#39;t really looked into a group, most I have heard of in the area <br/>
(VA Beach, Norfolk, Etc.) are homeschoolers but I never hear much about <br/>
unschooling.  There have been several outings but they are during his school hours, so <br/>
I haven&#39;t gone.  I guess I am so stuck on the decision to pull him out or let <br/>
him finish that I have been holding off on participating in anything because <br/>
I don&#39;t want to &quot;intrude&quot;.  I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m able to be a part of that world <br/>
until the decision is made.  You can email me off the list, I&#39;d appreciate <br/>
anything because I don&#39;t even know all the right questions to ask.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
