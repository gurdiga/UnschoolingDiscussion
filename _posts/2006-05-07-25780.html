There are even a few people other than me quoted there now :-)<br/>
<br/>
(I hope no one minds being quoted. If you do, let me know and I can  <br/>
remove your name or make it less identifiable. If I didn&#39;t identify  <br/>
you well enough, let me know that too! :-)<br/>

I wondered what the stars were!  Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, I had quoted you on a page too, something you put up there.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing at all for a great response to be  <br/>
available in two or three places (the original list or forum and  <br/>
another couple of &quot;best parts&quot; places.<br/>
<br/>
I like your title &quot;arguments against the arguments against TV.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to link some of your new pages to some of my old pages.<br/>
<br/>
I keep saying I just love your site, but I keep just loving it.<br/>
<br/>

and Marty going to get stuff were like jobs around the store and I  <br/>
was trying to picture Sandra and jogging and it just wasn&#39;t  <br/>
fitting .... ;-)<br/>
