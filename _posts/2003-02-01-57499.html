<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523646023">Hello everyone.  I am brand new here, joined tonight and just want to <br/>
introduce myself.  I am planning on lurking a bit before I jump into <br/>
any of the very interesting conversations I see going on or before <br/>
asking too many questions.  <br/>
<br/>
But to briefly tell you why I sought out this group I will just say <br/>
we have tried for so many years to bring school to our home with <br/>
Abeka and Alpha Omega curriculum and honestly have had minimal <br/>
success.  I am just so unstructured in my own life and that makes it <br/>
hard for me to &quot;hit the books&quot; everyday &quot;as scheduled&quot;.  So after <br/>
some struggles and thoughtful consideration, we are trying a <br/>
different approach.  <br/>
<br/>
I have no family support in this one-they are constantly on me <br/>
to &quot;have school&quot; so my kids don&#39;t end up &quot;dumb&quot;.  Well, I guess I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t even start that rant.  I could go on for hours about this <br/>
whole thing.  But to make it short, I think we may be able to find <br/>
some value in just making some materials available that will prompt <br/>
our interacts in what will lead to learning.  <br/>
<br/>
We are reading together The Little House in the Big Woods and we are <br/>
all really enjoying that time together without the pressure.  My <br/>
oldest daughter asked me after we read about curing the meat with <br/>
salt, where salt came from and I had to tell her I wasn&#39;t sure <br/>
exactly but that we could go on the internet and find out together.  <br/>
And from that we decided we would like to make a giant crystal <br/>
formation.  So that is on the agenda...  <br/>
<br/>
I am excited to have more interaction like this and less me screaming <br/>
about their school work not getting done and holding them prisoners <br/>
until it is.  I am sure you can all relate.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that leads me to my request for any used kids magazines you <br/>
all might want to part with.  I actually saw it in someone&#39;s post, <br/>
recommending using these as a spring board so I am looking for some <br/>
used ones since we are a single parent, work at home household and <br/>
the subscription rates to these things are just out of our budget.<br/>
  <br/>
I am looking for any used issues of titles like Cricket, Highlights, <br/>
Ranger Rick, My Big Backyard, Puzzlemania, Zillions, American Girl, <br/>
Kids Discover, Muse, National Geographic World, and more.  Please <br/>
just make sure they are in good condition with all the pages intact, <br/>
nothing you would put into the trash can.  <br/>
<br/>
I can send paypal. Please spam me directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:debsusedbooks@...">debsusedbooks@...</a>.  <br/>
And thanks for allowing me to be a part of your group.<br/>
