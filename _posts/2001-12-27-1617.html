&gt; &gt;Gads!  I left that list and now I&#39;m feeling sorry for you, Tia.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;thought my head would shoot off if I read too many more of those posts.<br/>
&gt; &gt;You are brave.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s been very quiet until yesterday.  Someone posted about a teenaged son<br/>
&gt; and how she was leaning toward unschooling.  Bridget had to post something<br/>
&gt; about how unschooling doesn&#39;t work for every kid and used her son as her<br/>
&gt; example.  A couple of people called her on it.  In her last post, she said<br/>
&gt; goodbye.  Usually I feel badly when someone quits a list in a huff, but in<br/>
&gt; this case I&#39;m hoping she makes good on her threat.<br/>
&gt; Tia<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ever since Bridget said this I have been wondering, how does unschooling<br/>
not work for every kid??  The essence of unschooling for me is that<br/>
the child is in control as much as possible.  It is focused on what the<br/>
child wants to do/learn/experience.  I can think of some things that<br/>
I might keep from my child from experiencing right now - safety things<br/>
like working with live electricity or playing on freeways or climbing<br/>
really high without proper safety equipment, etc.  I also hear from<br/>
time to time - &quot;we unschool except for _fill_in_subject_.&quot;  Is this<br/>
a misunderstanding about what unschooling is or what??<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; -- <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to say that I unschool except for math and Bible-based unit <br/>
studies.  Then I moved to saying that I unschool except for Bible <br/>
based unit studies.  Now I&#39;m finally a total unschooler.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that for me, I was very willing to not worry about things like <br/>
reading and history because those things are natural for me.  DD and I <br/>
are both good at language related stuff and I see dd reading <br/>
historical fiction so I don&#39;t see a need to worry about it.  Why would <br/>
I worry about teaching spelling if spelling comes so naturally to us? <br/>
<br/>
Math, however, is another story.  I never really understood math.  It <br/>
always seemed so complicated.  Even with a mom who is a math teacher <br/>
who spent hours with me at night getting me through my math homework, <br/>
I barely passed my algebra, geometry, and trig and I absolutely hated <br/>
it.  Even my basic math skills aren&#39;t the greatest.  So because I saw <br/>
math as this complicated monster, I figured we had to come up with a <br/>
&quot;good&quot; curriculum that would teach the &quot;basics&quot;.   I thought <br/>
that I certainly wouldn&#39;t be able to teach it naturally since I had <br/>
no natural ability in that area. I finally gave up after dd got so <br/>
frustrated that there was nothing more I could do for her, no matter <br/>
how good the curriculum or how clearly I explained.  Not long after I <br/>
&quot;gave up&quot;, she came to me asking for help figuring out how much more <br/>
money she needed to buy an American girl doll.  Everytime she earned <br/>
more money, she did math.  She learned double and triple digit <br/>
addition and subtraction, with carrying and borrowing, in a matter of <br/>
weeks. :)  <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who likes the idea of unschooling but worries that <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;not smart enough&quot;.  She said that &quot;smart&quot; people know  how to <br/>
answer their children&#39;s questions on the spot and know enough in their <br/>
own heads to point stuff out without planning ahead of time.  I do see <br/>
that she has a point.  Your child asks you what kind of insect is <br/>
crawling on a rock and you immediately tell her the name of the bug <br/>
and a really interesting fact versus telling her you will look it up <br/>
with her later, and either you forget to look it up or when you do, <br/>
she has lost interest.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes it works that way... more often, I might say something like,<br/>
&quot;Hmmm, it&#39;s got the same colors as a ladybug but it&#39;s a lot longer&quot; and<br/>
she would say something like, &quot;Yeah, but ladybugs are red with black<br/>
spots, this one is black with red spots.&quot; . Then we might theorize about<br/>
mutant ladybugs or  remember that bug we saw at Ardenwood that looked<br/>
kind of the same except it was yellow... and we might never figure out<br/>
the name for the bug, but that&#39;s okay, we could always call it &quot;The bug<br/>
we saw hiking at Tilden that day&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
When we got home later, I might say something like, &quot;Do you want to call<br/>
grandpa (entomology is one of his life-long hobbies) and ask about that<br/>
bug we saw?&quot; Or Cacie might say that... or neither of us will. Six months<br/>
later, maybe we&#39;ll be watching PBS and suddenly call out &quot;Hey, there&#39;s<br/>
That Bug We Saw at Tilden!&quot;. Or not. Or maybe she&#39;ll want to rush to the<br/>
nature center and ask them, and then check out a dozen books from the<br/>
library on bugs and go search for an identify hundreds of &#39;em. That<br/>
rarely happens.... sometimes, but rarely.  And it&#39;s all okay.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking lately that the measure of a person&#39;s ignorance (and I<br/>
don&#39;t necessarily mean that word negatively) is how little they think is<br/>
left to learn. When I was a kid, I thought I knew all of the animals in<br/>
the world - I&#39;d been to the zoos, I&#39;d read books, there were lions,<br/>
tigers, bears, etc., etc. Then one day I saw a llama. It really rocked my<br/>
world, shifted my paradigm. Now I see huge bodies of knowledge of which I<br/>
am almost totally ignorant, I can just see the outlines. My dad talks<br/>
about his butterflies and stamps, and both are really whole new worlds to<br/>
me - even though I&#39;ve been using stamps and seeing butterflies for years<br/>
and years. <br/>
<br/>
So, a kid may never learn what &quot;that bug&quot; was, but he may learn all about<br/>
stamp hinges and glues, or model trains, or human lactation, or weaving.<br/>
And it&#39;s all okay...<br/>

Oh!  Dar has a better angle on it:  -=-I&#39;ve been thinking lately that the <br/>
measure of a person&#39;s ignorance (and I don&#39;t necessarily mean that word <br/>
negatively) is how little they think is left to learn. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If the parent thinks she knows it all and so getting a curriculum is all it <br/>
takes for her kids to learn it all too, that&#39;s a detriment.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;A Zen story speaks of a learned scholar seeking the teachings of a Zen <br/>
master.  When the two finally met, the Zen master started pouring the scholar <br/>
a cup of tea.  He continued pouring the tea into a small cup, even after it <br/>
began to overflow.  The scholar pointed it out to the Master.  He replied: <br/>
&quot;Ah, to fill any cup, you have to empty it first.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I can say &quot;I don&#39;t have a clue.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I can also notice that my child seems to be developing an interest in <br/>
insects and I can notice that there is this insect exhbit at some museum and <br/>
I can make time to take her there. And I can get a little bug house thingie <br/>
and take her to the nature center and notice that they have a little workshop <br/>
about insects and I might even get her a book or at least show her that <br/>
section of the bookstore..... etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to know anything about insects to facilitate these things --- <br/>
and one thing will lead to another, maybe, and if my child REALLY is <br/>
interested in insects, we&#39;ll find ways for her to satisfying her desire to <br/>
learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120537101">My son and I went on a field trip ( there&#39;s that word) last August with a<br/>
group of what turned out to be mostly homeschoolers.  It was a geological<br/>
excursion offered by the MT. Bureau of Mines and Geology.<br/>
<br/>
On the way to the site folks were introducing themselves and explaining<br/>
their homeschooling.  When it came to us, and the inevitable &quot;What<br/>
curriculum do you use&quot; question popped (pooped?) up, I said no<br/>
curriculum, we&#39;re unschoolers.  <br/>
We might as well have said we were devils.  It was pretty cold and<br/>
silent. <br/>
Once we were all out wandering around the country side,  things warmed up<br/>
a little. Many of the people were taken with Dylan.  He&#39;s not shy at all,<br/>
very engaging.  He&#39;s articulate and knowledgeable.  When some of the<br/>
adults couldn&#39;t push there way in to ask the geologist questions, they<br/>
were soon coming to Dylan and he&#39;d say, &quot;wow, that&#39;s a beautiful smokey<br/>
quartz&quot;  or &quot; those are tourmaline crystals&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
People were much more friendly on the way home, and finally one woman<br/>
asked the - don&#39;t you have to be really smart to unschool -  question.  <br/>
I said, I think, -you only need to like your kid and want him to be<br/>
happy.   A few weeks later one of the women called me with questions<br/>
about unschooling.  I think unschooling is to the school at home bunch,<br/>
what homeschooling is to public school parents.  A kind of mysterious<br/>
land where you have to be a certified something or other to find your way<br/>
around.  <br/>
<br/>
Once on another list a mom kept insisting unschooling wouldn&#39;t work for<br/>
her kid.  He had 42 different diseases, compulsions and disorders and not<br/>
one thing was right about him.  And Dodd spoketh and said &quot; dost thou<br/>
likest thy child?&quot;,  and that was when the mom, when she was pressed, <br/>
came up with one or two nice things she could say about him.  So maybe<br/>
unschooling won&#39;t work for every kid, but it will surely work for the<br/>
kids whose parents find them to be wonderful, interesting people, no<br/>
matter how much TV they watch.<br/>

Here without dangerous quotations is a story I didn&#39;t write OR retell, but <br/>
borrowed whole from elsewhere:<br/>
<br/>
A Zen story speaks of a learned scholar seeking the teachings of a Zen <br/>
master.  When the two finally met, the Zen master started pouring the scholar <br/>
a cup of tea.  He continued pouring the tea into a small cup, even after it <br/>
began to overflow.  The scholar pointed it out to the Master.  He replied: <br/>
&quot;Ah, to fill any cup, you have to empty it first.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761787693">I&#39;ve been in a small (three families including us) co-op for about 18 <br/>
months. We&#39;re there for the socialization. &lt;g&gt; But it&#39;s also a speech and<br/>
craft and science project sort of thing, and the two other Moms,<br/>
structured-homeschooling-junkies to the core (one is a former teacher and<br/>
still sounds just like it) are very calm and relaxed about Brit being<br/>
off-topic consistently, or there just to play, or making her craft project<br/>
upside-down and backward. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The former teacher has been asking me a lot recently for ideas for her<br/>
middle child, her only daughter, who is brilliantly artistic and sensitive<br/>
and is frustrating the frijoles out of her mother by working to the lowest<br/>
possible level with all the &quot;schoolwork&quot; she is given, memorizing it long<br/>
enough to recite it, and then promptly forgetting it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to say this without sounding like I have a head the size of<br/>
Kansas, but here goes: We&#39;re good for other homeschoolers. Even if they<br/>
never completely grasp unschooling, they grasp relaxing a little, and then a<br/>
little more, and that can&#39;t be anything but good for their kids. They see<br/>
that SOMETHING is working for our kids, and it&#39;s impossible to deny that our<br/>
little humanoids ARE learning, AREN&#39;T eating with their toes, and CAN, by<br/>
golly, get into colleges that don&#39;t start with the word &quot;Remedial&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If a frazzled curriculum-using tv-denying Mom sees our kids happy, healthy,<br/>
learning in spite of (or, as most of us realize, BECAUSE of) Pokemon at 5<br/>
p.m., she can only shrug it off for so long and remain honest with herself.<br/>

People were much more friendly on the way home, and finally one woman<br/>
asked the - don&#39;t you have to be really smart to unschool -  question.<br/>
I said, I think, -you only need to like your kid and want him to be<br/>
happy.   A few weeks later one of the women called me with questions<br/>
about unschooling.  I think unschooling is to the school at home bunch,<br/>
what homeschooling is to public school parents.  A kind of mysterious<br/>
land where you have to be a certified something or other to find your way<br/>
around.<br/>

I kinda made that point, sort of, once speaking in Riverside.  I defined one <br/>
end of the stage area as &quot;Swiss Boarding School&quot; and the other end total <br/>
unschooling.  And I said that by the existence of those who stretch the <br/>
envelope, those in the middle can move more toward the radical side with more <br/>
ease.<br/>
<br/>
It was more physically presented, not those exact words.  But for those who <br/>
fear the edge, moving the edge further away gives them more safety.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ever since Bridget said this I have been wondering, how does unschooling<br/>
&gt;not work for every kid??  The essence of unschooling for me is that<br/>
&gt;the child is in control as much as possible.  It is focused on what the<br/>
&gt;child wants to do/learn/experience.  I can think of some things that<br/>
&gt;I might keep from my child from experiencing right now - safety things<br/>
&gt;like working with live electricity or playing on freeways or climbing<br/>
&gt;really high without proper safety equipment, etc.  I also hear from<br/>
&gt;time to time - &quot;we unschool except for _fill_in_subject_.&quot;  Is this<br/>
&gt;a misunderstanding about what unschooling is or what??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that she believes it works for her daughters because they are <br/>
turning out more or less the way she wants them to.  Her son isn&#39;t living <br/>
up to her expectations when making his own choices so they need to be taken <br/>
from him.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand people saying something like, &quot;We lean toward unschooling <br/>
but haven&#39;t quite been able to make the break in the math area.&quot;  Or <br/>
something like that.  But, &quot;We unschool except for....&quot; just doesn&#39;t cut it <br/>
for me.<br/>

children birdwatched, he would not tell them the name of the bird they<br/>
observed; instead, they would really *look* at it, its color, size, beak<br/>
shape, feet, behavior, etc.  He felt that once the thing was named, the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980387998">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Once on another list a mom kept insisting<br/>
unschooling wouldn&#39;t work for her kid.  He had 42<br/>
different diseases, compulsions and disorders and not<br/>
one thing was right about him.  And Dodd spoketh and<br/>
said &quot; dost thou likest thy child?&quot;,  and that was<br/>
when the mom, when she was pressed, <br/>
came up with one or two nice things she could say<br/>
about him.  So maybe unschooling won&#39;t work for every<br/>
kid, but it will surely work for the kids whose<br/>
parents find them to be wonderful, interesting people,<br/>
no matter how much TV they watch.<br/>

<br/>
Oh yes, I remember it well. <br/>
<br/>
It always amazes me when I talk to people about what<br/>
we &#39;do&#39; and they immediately say, &quot;it&#39;s alright for<br/>
you, you&#39;re college educated and intelligent&quot;. I laugh<br/>
and tell them, &quot;I haven&#39;t got a college degree. But<br/>
yes, I am intelligent and I&#39;m sure you are too, if you<br/>
want to be&quot;. There are so many questions that I don&#39;t<br/>
have the answers to, but that&#39;s why we have books,<br/>
libraries and the internet. I carry around a mini<br/>
notebook and when Tamzin asks a question that I don&#39;t<br/>
know the answer to, she decides if she wants me to<br/>
write it in the book to look up later. One or more<br/>
times a week, I read off the questions to her and she<br/>
decides which ones she&#39;d like to have the answers to<br/>
and we look them up. It&#39;s a very simple system and I&#39;m<br/>
learning so much alongside of her.<br/>
Speaking of TV, Tamzin&#39;s really into classics at the<br/>
moment. We went to the video store and she chose The<br/>
Wizard of Oz, The Little Colonel (Shirley Temple), and<br/>
The Little Rascals. She is obsessed with Shirley<br/>
Temple at the moment. She puts on puffy dresses and<br/>
dances around the house. Too cute! I&#39;ve got a Shirley<br/>
Temple LP from when I was a kid, but no LP player.<br/>
Does anyone know if you can get LPs transferred onto<br/>
CD?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depending on how many you want to do, I&#39;ll bet the cheapest way to go is to<br/>
burn [record or transfer] them yourself.  We have a $200 CD writer (you can<br/>
get them cheaper now) that is plugged into our 3 year old Mac. I bought the<br/>
program Toast Titanium for $90 (the product for the PC is CD Creator I<br/>
think, Roxio is the publisher) it comes with software that helps filter out<br/>
clicks and pops and background noise. They even include a cable to go<br/>
between the computer and HiFi.  The cheapest blank CDs I&#39;ve found is free<br/>
after a rebate bought at Office Max. If you can&#39;t find a good sale $.20 to<br/>
.35 is typical if you buy them quantities of 50 or more.<br/>
<br/>
So how many CDs can you buy for $290 or less?  If you can find them.<br/>
<br/>
You do have to listen to all those LPs you&#39;re transferring though. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
