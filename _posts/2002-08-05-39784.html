I&#39;ll post more on this, but I believe that much of our wrangling on this<br/>

root) fringe of a large and growing fringe group. We are the strong-headed<br/>
independent people among semi-independent, usually self-assured, types of<br/>

What matters is that the children are not in those cages of artificial life<br/>
and synthetic experience called schools.<br/>
<br/>
This group is truly leading the way out of the education dark ages. People<br/>
are much more intelligent than school gives them the opportunity to express.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825846819">well, i always called it.. .. the fun of learning new things.. schools teach the kids it&#39;s WORK to learn.. it&#39;s not work it&#39;s FUN it&#39;s PLAY.. natural play... watch animals.. their playing is learning what they&#39;ll need as mature animals.. look at the rainforest cultures by the amazon.. their kids just participate and learn as they go.. sounds good to ME...<br/>

<br/>
I hear almost every day from someone either pulling kids out of school or <br/>
switching from school-at-home to a more relaxed learning model -- and I&#39;m <br/>
amazed at how much more receptive to even pretty radical unschooling ideas <br/>
people are now compared to even just five years ago. Maybe it is more obvious <br/>
here in California, where our educational system has flip-flopped so <br/>
extremely in the last decade regarding what and how kids are taught/treated. <br/>
We went, for example, from NO testing and moving away from grades at all --  <br/>
to rigid and VERY high stakes standardized testing and rigorous high school <br/>
exit exams - in the last 7 years. Many people are just disgusted with <br/>
educators and are open to completely alternative possibilities. I&#39;ve been <br/>
giving considering-homeschooling workshops with a friend and, at first, we <br/>
thought that our unschooling approach might not be what people were looking <br/>
for - but the majority of people seem to be really thrilled and relieved to <br/>
hear about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849669197">All this trend toward testing testing testing.. goes right along with the obsession with the word ACCOUNTABILITY i keep hearing from politicians.. it just burns me up when i hear this.. listening to NPR i hear educators discussing how bad this trend is for the kids that are supposedly to be educated... .. <br/>
<br/>
I see it as a really good reason to get my kids OUT of the public school system.. <br/>
