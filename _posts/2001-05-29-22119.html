  I am not a quilted, but I am enjoying the posts, I find it inspiring to hear how others are inspired. It only seems natural that an endless amount of interests show up on this site. If you quilting enthusiasts would not have shared,  I would not have thought about quilting; the beauty, the art, the comfort, the people that I have known who are or were quitters. <br/>
