 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;The only thing we haven&#39;t unschooled is swimming. I&#39;m pretty adamant<br/>
that my kids know how to swim. We&#39;re around water all the time, and I<br/>
think it&#39;s an important thing to know. I&#39;ve told them that either I<br/>
will teach them or they can take lessons. My son just opted to drop<br/>
lessons and have me continue teaching him. As soon as they&#39;re<br/>
proficient swimmers, we&#39;ll stop. But I wasn&#39;t willing to wait until<br/>
whatever age they thought it would be good to learn to swim. I guess<br/>
because I&#39;ve pulled a 7 year old boy from a river where he would&#39;ve<br/>
drowned, I&#39;ve got strong feelings on this one. Everything else I&#39;m<br/>
willing to be patient with.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I almost drowned when I was 7 and we live in FL and we have a pool. But <br/>
I was adamant about unschooling swimming too!! Before this house we went <br/>
swimming often at my SIL&#39;s. Tara had learned on her own when she was about <br/>
5-6. My SIL (another one) that works in the school system was telling me <br/>
about swim lessons that were great. I listened and left it go at that. When <br/>
we moved into this house with a pool, she started up again. I asked Joseph <br/>
and Sierra if they wanted to go. I explained what it was and then they said <br/>
they didn&#39;t want to do that. THAT went over big with the SIL.  LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
So they wore their swimmies and we left them alone as far as teaching <br/>
anything in the pool. We moved in here in August of 2000 and by Oct. they <br/>
were swimming without the swimmies. Sometimes when they were tired they <br/>
would put them back on. The following summer they became fish.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s 3 and 1 to go. Alyssa is 2 and loves the pool and wears her <br/>
swimmies. We have a pool safety fence and the kids are well aware of what to <br/>
do if anyone gets into trouble in the pool. The children swim much better <br/>
than I do. Eventually Alyssa will also.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052260078">I don&#39;t swim.  Took lessons twice, couldn&#39;t get it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty took lessons.  Kirby hated the lessons, can swim but doesn&#39;t <br/>
do it for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Marty liked them, swims, not as well as Holly.<br/>
<br/>
Holly learned mostly from friends who have a pool at their apartment complex, <br/>
from playing games in the water.  She isn&#39;t afraid of jumping off high diving <br/>
boards (doesn&#39;t dive, just jumps feet first).  And when most of the extended <br/>
Dodd family got a pontoon boat and spent two days on a lake, Holly had no <br/>
fear of jumping off that boat into Elephant Butte Lake, which is deep.  Marty <br/>
wasn&#39;t afraid to ride a Jetski.  So they&#39;re both good for safety purposes.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith, who had all kinds of red cross and swimming training as a boy scout <br/>
and from just being that kind of guy has taught them a few things, just <br/>
informally, conversationally and playing games, about how to help someone <br/>
who&#39;s in trouble.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty says Hollys a better swimmer because she didn&#39;t learn it in swim <br/>
classes.<br/>

Sandra - Do you wish you could?  When I was thirty I realized that I was<br/>
really tired of watching other people swim and feeling like there was no<br/>
way I could ever learn and determined that I *would* learn that summer.<br/>
Swimming is one of the most amazing feelings for me!   ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
Keith tried to just play around with me in the water to see what my problem <br/>
was &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
He was pulling me along and I didn&#39;t FEEL like I was afraid of the water, but <br/>
Keith says I was acting like it.  So maybe my brain says it&#39;s okay but my <br/>
body&#39;s saying &quot;OH no, I&#39;m not cooperating.&quot;  I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
It DOES look wonderful.  <br/>
<br/>
I can harmonize several styles of traditional music.  I can write quickly and <br/>
I can sew.  <br/>
If I spend the rest of my life doing THOSE things and staying out of water, <br/>
I&#39;ll have lived with a little lack, but at least I won&#39;t drown!<br/>

 <br/>
My dad, who&#39;s in his 70&#39;s, is terrified of water.  He tenses up when<br/>
he&#39;s even near a pool, so he&#39;s convinced that his body is the one human<br/>
body that physically does not float.  This summer when he looked like he<br/>
was going to pass out in the heat I coaxed him into sitting on a big<br/>
step in our pool, and he was shocked to realize that when he didn&#39;t pay<br/>
close attention his legs floated up!  When I told him that if he could<br/>
just relax his whole body would float he looked at me like I was crazy.<br/>
Maybe next summer :0).  ~Rue<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My best friend is exactly  the same way.  She says she is OK but tightens up <br/>
and tenses when in the water over her hips.  She has basically accepted that <br/>
she doesn&#39;t swim and uses one of those big inner tubes to float all day.  <br/>
LOL.  She says she is coming over to the house to come float.<br/>
