<div id="ygrps-yiv-883956261">&lt;&lt;and not have all this Christianity attached to them&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have finally decided that Christian hs groups are just like Christain<br/>
vacation bible school and Christian basketball leagues and Christian<br/>
anything.  The point is not to provide support and fun.  The point is a very<br/>
specific religious agenda.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I thank all that is divine for our experience with the local<br/>
Christian support group.  I have discovered that I am actually Pagan.  I had<br/>
always thought I was a Christian, that I just didn&#39;t agree with most of the<br/>
teachings.  After the zillionth time of hearing about how I must do such and<br/>
such because that is what Christains do, I finally responded &quot;Perhaps I&#39;m<br/>
not Christian.  I always thought I was but maybe not because what I have<br/>
always had in my heart that I thought was God is nothing like what you<br/>
describe.&quot;  It caused a sharp intake of breath by the listener and it opened<br/>
a floodgate within me.  I started researching and finding that large groups<br/>
of people believe the same as me, see the world as I have always seen it.<br/>
It is so liberating.<br/>
