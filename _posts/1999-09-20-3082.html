&lt;&lt; My dh is happy to go to bed if I&#39;ll wake him up (Ahem) when I come to bed. <br/>
 I<br/>
usually would just like to decompress when I get in bed.  But, life in a <br/>
family is<br/>
compromise, so sometimes I wake him up, sometimes I decompress...... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  we use the same system!  it is good when we (spouses) can appreciate <br/>
each others needs (Ahem)-- and be adult enough to recognize whose are greater <br/>
at any paritcular time!  :)<br/>
compromise is sure vital!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I keep trying to remind myself the 4  yr. old won&#39;t be in my bed forever, <br/>
and that<br/>
soon no one will want to be in my bed with us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  <br/>
i, too, try to reflect often on how nice it is to be sooo loved and needed!! <br/>
when i find myself in need of a greater appreciation of all this loooove and <br/>
attention, i just try to imagine myself greatly missing it one day down the <br/>
road!!  it gets me more greatful, less wistful....<br/>

Yeah, this is a tough one.  I just want to be LEFT ALONE at the end of the day.<br/>

side of it.  Sometimes I don&#39;t succeed to well, but I try.<br/>
Guess this is just one of the family issues that we all deal with.<br/>

&gt; Oh boy, is this a big issue in our house right now! My 6yo doesn&#39;t go to<br/>
&gt; bed until after 10:00 almost every night. Then, by the time I get to use<br/>
&gt; the computer (DH is on until 11), and log in our days highlights and read<br/>
&gt; mail, it is midnight. Then I need time to myself to just wind down from the<br/>
&gt; day. Of course, this is the time that my husband wants my attention. Has<br/>
&gt; anyone found a solution to this type of situation? Late night is when my<br/>
&gt; son wants to read and play games with us, so I hate to miss this important<br/>
&gt; part of our unschooling. But my husband is not happy either. Is this a<br/>
&gt; common problem for home/unschoolers, when mom&#39;s time comes last at the end<br/>
&gt; of the day?<br/>

&gt; &gt;as i was reading your schedule with the laaaate nights i wondered about the<br/>
&gt; &gt;spousal agreeableness, then later you mentioned it!  i guess it is on my mind<br/>
&gt; &gt;because i often stay up late (like now) just to get some solitude after a<br/>
&gt; &gt;long day with the four children.  but hubby wishes i would snuggle in with<br/>
&gt; &gt;him....   all these needs to deal with (including my own!)<br/>
