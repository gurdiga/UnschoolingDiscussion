two or three classes away from a minor in three or four fields.  I <br/>
would have loved the opportunity to craft my own degree plan.  <br/>
However, I have found a major that I love (sociology).<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think one of the reasons Laurie enjoys college so much is because<br/>
 it&#39;s not repeated high school stuff for her.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     I actually didn&#39;t feel that college was just more of the same from high <br/>
school.  High school was so focused on discipline issues, controlling people, <br/>
writing them up for being late to class or smoking or listening to music on <br/>
cassette players we weren&#39;t supposed to have or dress codes, etc.  Also, high <br/>
school has to be so watered down as far as controversial issues.  College <br/>
teachers don&#39;t care about dress codes or smoking, they cuss in the class <br/>
themselves sometimes, and they delve a lot more deeply into controversial <br/>
issues, like things that took place in American history or are going on now, <br/>
for example.  It&#39;s not perfect and there are some teachers who are like the <br/>
worst of the high school teachers, but as a whole, I think it&#39;s a whole <br/>
different and better world than high school.  Maybe one big difference is <br/>
that it&#39;s not compulsory!<br/>

he can take Community College courses next year.  I think the requirement is <br/>
that you have to be 14 to do that and his b&#39;day is in June.  I&#39;m a little <br/>
amazed that he wants this, since he&#39;s been enjoying this past year of no <br/>
deadlines and relaxed learning, but if it&#39;s what he wants.....<br/>
<br/>
I wish I&#39;d been able to just take the courses I wanted to have instead of <br/>
all the &quot;required&quot; stuff!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416017617">I can only go from what those around me have done. None of mine are old <br/>
enough yet to find out. The homeschoolers I know of, both school at home and <br/>
unschoolers, have had no problem getting in to the colleges of their choice. <br/>
Some have GED&#39;s, some don&#39;t. Some have testing from previous years of <br/>
homeschooling and didn&#39;t have to submit them at all. Some of the children <br/>
did dual enrollment and had no problem from the colleges at all getting in. <br/>
One girl in particular, who I know is a true unschooler just took her SAT&#39;s <br/>
and was accepted into all 4 colleges she applied to just on that. She had <br/>
never been tested yearly at all during her unschooling years. She learned <br/>
what she needed to when she decided what she wanted to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583307034">Hi listmates-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on digest and still have a time keeping up with this prolific list!<br/>
Great sharing here recently. <br/>
<br/>
On the subject of college/unschooling -<br/>
There is a great resource in Clonlara School for unschoolers who want to<br/>
have a highschool transcript/diploma for whatever their reasons. Clonlara<br/>
will take the child&#39;s accomplishments, interests, dabblings, reading,<br/>
playing, sports, music, singing, computer time, video time, quiet time,<br/>
volunteering, working for pay - whatever - and help translate it into<br/>
credits. They are a very expansive group of educators, who see unschooling<br/>
as a viable and solid way up the mountain of learning. www.clonlara.org<br/>
<br/>
My son, Sky, decided that he wanted his four years or so of varied pursuits<br/>
honored by the &#39;mainstream&#39; as a &#39;highschool&#39; education. . . Clonlara<br/>
assisted him in making that happen. It was an interesting process. Now, he<br/>
is not so sure about college . . . travel and working and continued<br/>
independent studies in things he loves are happening for him now . . . but<br/>
he doesn&#39;t regret his path with Clonlara.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191421725">Back in 1963, I started my &#39;career book&#39;. It was on Egyptology. In fact, it was in hieroglyphics. It was two volumes. I spent two years on it. I had a translation on each page. It really was very well done.<br/>
It failed. The nun that required it had a problem with the &#39;reality&#39; of it.<br/>
<br/>
In any case - my mom believed 100% that I could do anything I wanted. (although - we had pretty much given up singing as a career)<br/>
At the time, my mom was a waitress near Brown University. She met a man from a university in Alexandria, Egypt. He was here on Sabbatical.  She showed him the book. He took it home with him when he went home for a bit. <br/>
Upon his return, he informed us that I had been invited to apply to the university in Egypt!! He had information regarding scholarships, etc.<br/>
By the time I was in the twelfth grade, there was - in writing - the promise of a full scholarship. I was to live with this man and his wife and children. There was grant for living expenses.<br/>
All of this w/o SAT&#39;s - because of my career book.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, the man I was to stay with ended up leaving Egypt (political considerations by that time there was full blown war w/ Israel) and my mom & dad were not comfortable sending me to live in Egypt w/o knowing one person there!! (We&#39;re from RI - very into roots and connections!)<br/>
<br/>
All w/o SAT&#39;s.<br/>

that right now.  It&#39;s not the blood or guts of it all.  I think it would be <br/>
the rotten stinky part that would get her to say &quot;no thanks&quot; if I brought <br/>
that in for her.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I could probably wait for some &quot;fresh kill&quot; but we don&#39;t often even <br/>
see ANY around my neighborhood and would probably have to venture to some <br/>
much more traveled highway and just wait.  OR maybe we would be &quot;lucky&quot; <br/>
enough to find some.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe I&#39;ll mention to her if she would like to do any of that.  But I <br/>
can promise I won&#39;t be encouraging the road kill, but then if she&#39;s <br/>
interested...guess I&#39;ll be finding the gloves...<br/>

More successful?  Or differently successful?  Did you set out to  meet the <br/>
same goals and you made it and he didn&#39;t?  Or were you on  different paths?  <br/>
Does he define success different than you?  Is he  content with his achievements <br/>
or does he feel he&#39;s standing in the shadow  of yours?  <br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine why a person would say they are &#39;more successful&#39; than  their <br/>
spouse.  It seems disrespectful, and at the very least buying into  the <br/>
societal definitions of success that are portrayed in the media (bigger,  better, <br/>
more than).  Weren&#39;t you on the journey together?  Didn&#39;t you  help and support <br/>
him while he went after his goals, and weren&#39;t you aware of the  reasons he <br/>
didn&#39;t meet them?  If he didn&#39;t?  Whose standard is he  living by?  Does he get <br/>
to define his own success?  And what right is  it of anyone else&#39;s to define <br/>
it for him?  What basis of comparison is  there between a person who goes to <br/>
school, joins the workforce and builds a  career, and a person who dabbles with <br/>
school, has babies, raises them and takes  a less traditional path?  <br/>
 <br/>

&gt;More successful?  Or differently successful?  Did you set out to  meet the same goals and you made it and he didn&#39;t?  Or were you on  different paths?

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m happy with what I do. Always have been. Ben has that MBA and has never used it (in the management sense that it was intended). <br/>
<br/>
Defining success is important. I LIKE what I do/have done. Ben&#39;s never been really happy at any job----military, food sales, wine & beverage business, pharmaceutical rep. They&#39;ve all been just jobs. I take my passions and play with them (and make a living at the same time).<br/>
<br/>
Financially, he makes more than I do, but only because he works more hours than I do. If I kept his schedule, I could make more----but I choose not to. Even if I didn&#39;t, that doesn&#39;t matter. I do what I like to do and am happy doing it. What I do makes a difference to me and to others. Ben doesn&#39;t get that warm fuzzy.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he feels as if he&#39;s in my shadow. I think he feels he hasn&#39;t made one. He&#39;s still searching for the sun.<br/>
<br/>
But success for both of us is in passion and joy and &quot;producing&quot; something. He hasn&#39;t found his niche yet, so no----he doesn&#39;t feel as successful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*He* gets to make that decision. He has a Master&#39;s degree that &quot;proves&quot; to many that he&#39;s successful. He doesn&#39;t feel that he&#39;s connected all the dots yet----he would still like to find something to do every day that makes a difference (outside of being a husband and father)---he wants a passion that can &quot;pay the bills&quot; too.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve supported him in each of his changes. And I&#39;m willing to do that again next month when he changes jobs again (into the Air National Guard  fulltime)----but this change is not *the* change he&#39;s looking for. It&#39;s just another stepping stone to hopefully get where he wants to go. <br/>

1985.  But once I got to college, I found pockets of students and <br/>
especially professors that questioned the definition of success -- <br/>
that it wasn&#39;t just about money and jobs.  Those who believed in <br/>
alternatives weren&#39;t apparent at first, but as I attended classes <br/>
and got to know people, I found lifetime friends and lots of <br/>
alternative viewpoints.<br/>
