<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020526172">My step-grandfather was Russian, and my mother gave my brothers and me<br/>
Russian names. It&#39;s actually of Greek derivation, originally, meaning<br/>
&quot;blessed&quot;. Thanks-I hope your daughter enjoys the name! There seem to be<br/>
more Kiras around of late, although when I was growing up, I was the only<br/>
one I had ever heard of!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; May I ask how you came to be named Kira? It&#39;s our daughter&#39;s name and was<br/>
from an Ayn Rand novel, We the Living. We read it about ten years before she<br/>
was born and decided that if we ever had a baby girl, Kira would be her<br/>
name!<br/>
