<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318941883">Well, my son Phillip (6 yo) today typed his first words by himself on the <br/>
computer.  He is not reading yet but the boys were playing some type of <br/>
multiplayer game.  Each was on his own computer and they were connected into this game. <br/>
 Anyway there is a feature where you can send messages to the other person on <br/>
the other computer.  My youngest typed &quot;kissing poop&quot; and then changed it to <br/>
&quot;pissing poop&quot;.  He thought that was quite funny.  Actually any bodily <br/>
function they consider funny.  This is the first time though.  Usually he asks how to <br/>
spell words and he types them in as I spell them, this one he did all on his <br/>
own.  YEA!!<br/>
