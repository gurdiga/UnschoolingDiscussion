<div id="ygrps-yiv-963859582">My daughter, Sarah (7) was watching a show called &quot;Avatar:  The Last <br/>
Air Bender&quot; and after it was over she started giving me a synopsis <br/>
of the episode.  The episode included a forbidden love and death and <br/>
wanting to be together forever.  <br/>
<br/>
I told her that reminded me of a Shakespeare play and I told her the <br/>
basic storyline of &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; She thought it was a cool <br/>
story and she went on and made a book for herself of the Avatar <br/>
episode.  Sarah doesn&#39;t write much yet but she draws pictures and <br/>
then narrates the story to me.  We have dozens of these books (I <br/>
save them all!).<br/>
<br/>
A few days later we were at the bookstore and she brought an Usborne <br/>
book to me and asked, &quot;Is this &quot;Romeo and Juliet?&quot;  And it was--a <br/>
wonderful version telling the story in short chapters and modern <br/>
language with wonderful illustrations.  We bought it and went home <br/>
and read it (and read it again and again).  I then told her that <br/>
Shakespeare wrote lots of plays and there are movies to rent and she <br/>
and her sister (age 5) began chanting &quot;More Shakespeare, More <br/>
Shakespeare.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, we are waiting for the movie with Olivia Hussey to arrive in the <br/>
mail tomorrow from Netflix.  Sarah ran out to the mailbox today and <br/>
was disappointed.  <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime we have watched the &quot;Standard Deviants&quot; dvd&#39;s <br/>
explaining Romeo and Juliet and an intro to Shakespeare.  We also <br/>
got a Jim Weiss cd of Romeo and Juliet for the car.  <br/>
<br/>
And Sandra, I really enjoyed reading your Shakespeare page at your <br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;ll do some McBeth next as they love the witches&#39; &quot;Double, <br/>
double, toil and trouble&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And all of this from watching TV!!</div>

Azkaban&quot;?  It includes a choir at Hogwart&#39;s singing those lines.  It&#39;s <br/>
my favorite of the soundtracks; lots of early music references :-)<br/>

Jayn Coburn set up Barbie dolls in beautiful scenarios, and it&#39;s  <br/>

When my kids were little I would play the videotape of West Side  <br/>
Story , but I would turn it off after a while, after Officer Krupke  <br/>
or so.<br/>
<br/>
One day I forgot.  I came into the living room and Marty and Kirby  <br/>
were standing in the middle of the room staring at the screen.  Maria  <br/>
was cradling Tony and crying.  They were staring and didn&#39;t even look  <br/>
at me.  That had never happened before (as far as they knew).  I  <br/>
think they were probably like four and seven or so.  I had to explain  <br/>
that I had been distracting them away from it before, and I was sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I hate the end of Romeo and Juliet.  It makes me mad every time.  I  <br/>
like to turn it off when their plan is in good shape.  They get  <br/>
married and things are all better.  Tony and Maria get on the bus  <br/>
and  move to Chicago or Albuquerque or somewhere.  I like my versions  <br/>
better.<br/>

because I hate the ending as well. I can&#39;t help but editorializing about the<br/>
idiocy of Friar Lawrence&#39;s plan. She staged the play with some friends and I<br/>
was tapped to be the narrator -- on the condition that I would do my<br/>
commentary. <br/>
<br/>
We also had great seats to see Damn Yankees! live last week, which my 10yo<br/>
and 8yo just loved. Are there any other good &quot;Faust&quot; myth movies?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935300995">The BBC did a few episodes of a cool show called &quot;Shakespear Shorts&quot;  where<br/>
they take a key scene from one of the plays and work on it as the actors and<br/>
director discusss process, language and motivation etc.  It&#39;s facinating and<br/>
it only runs 30 minutes so - very fast paced.  Because they only attempt one<br/>
scene at a time you get a deeper treatment.  We only stopped watching it<br/>
after it became clear we&#39;d seen all the episodes at least twice.  Wish<br/>
they&#39;d do more.<br/>
