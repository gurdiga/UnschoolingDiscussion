<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963957087">I was going to write that Holly learned to spell from IMs too, and then the <br/>
next e-mail was an instant message Holly sent me (for the dates).   This is <br/>
Holly chatting with Helena (her real name is in French, &quot;Heléne,&quot; but she uses <br/>
the anglicized version in New Mexico), the mom of the family she stayed with <br/>
there.   So Kent Helene is a woman of 40 or so with a Master&#39;s degree from York, <br/>
and her spelling is a good example of informal language use for this purpose.  <br/>
 (She is a great speller, and has edited publications, and so people can <br/>
choose their level of formality.)    <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s spelling is pretty good!   This is not writing written slowly, <br/>
checked, edited, re-read... this is real-time writing, type-and-send.<br/>
<br/>
Helena&#39;s an archeologist and was this week working on an episode of Time <br/>
Team, an English TV show hosted by Tony Robinson (who played Baldrick on Black <br/>
Adder--that&#39;s the way Americans might know him), so that&#39;s the Time Team <br/>
reference:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 kenthelene (2:21:22 AM): hello, i&#39;m here (not totally sure who i&#39;m chatting <br/>
with though--sandra? holly?)<br/>
BlazingOranges (2:21:32 AM): Holly!<br/>
BlazingOranges (2:21:38 AM): you guessed right :d<br/>
kenthelene (2:21:47 AM): okay, just checking...<br/>
kenthelene (2:22:06 AM): update on our travel plans or my last week filming <br/>
with Time Team?<br/>
kenthelene (2:22:17 AM): Prolly the travel thing right?<br/>
BlazingOranges (2:22:17 AM): everything<br/>
kenthelene (2:24:37 AM): okay, Time Team was TOTALLY AWESOME and they&#39;ve <br/>
asked me to come back and film one more episode with them! I am thinking we are <br/>
likely to be in Albuquerque by the 18th of October. We are having to get our <br/>
passports extended before we leave the country so that is the biggest hold up. <br/>
Hopefully that will happen on the 12th so we&#39;ll be good to go. I&#39;ll let you know <br/>
for sure when we buy the tickets. That will be in the next few days.<br/>
kenthelene (2:25:01 AM): and can i just say: TIME TEAM WAS AWESOME!<br/>
kenthelene (2:25:21 AM): I&#39;ve got pictures that i&#39;ll send out today...<br/>
<br/>
 BlazingOranges (2:26:33 AM): Oh wicked, I&#39;m glad the show went totally <br/>
amazingly AWESOME... and I&#39;m extra glad that ya&#39;ll are coming to visit<br/>
kenthelene (2:27:11 AM): hey is it early or late for you right now:-) ?<br/>
BlazingOranges (2:27:32 AM): hmmm late<br/>
kenthelene (2:27:43 AM): :-)<br/>
BlazingOranges (2:28:08 AM): But i&#39;ve been tryng lately to get up at noon <br/>
so... this is getting to be the latest<br/>
kenthelene (2:28:16 AM): oh, i saw one of your socks! but then it disappeared <br/>
into the depths of the living room again, but we&#39;ll find it again<br/>
kenthelene (2:28:28 AM): jazzy says hi!<br/>
BlazingOranges (2:28:34 AM): yay!<br/>
BlazingOranges (2:28:36 AM): and Hi!<br/>
kenthelene (2:28:53 AM): okay, sweet one i gots tah run...<br/>

And she said &quot;ya&#39;ll&quot;?  Do people in New Mexico use that term when  speaking?  <br/>
I can understand it being a contraction of &quot;you all&quot; in  IM.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I was growing up in Arkansas and we passed notes to each other in  <br/>
school, we always spelled it &quot;y&#39;all&quot;.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
It was just the songwriter/singer they chose who added the C&W music twang.<br/>
<br/>
But I have read (in history of English discussions and such) that the accent <br/>
existing in the southern U.S. has close roots to the English of when the <br/>
hillbilly factions left--1700&#39;s and before.   People there are inflexible and <br/>
didn&#39;t have as much in the way of schools or the written word for a long time, nor <br/>
as much mixing it up with other groups of people, and some of the phrases they <br/>
kept are OLD.   &quot;I&#39;m much beholden to you&quot; survived into the 2nd half of the <br/>
20th century, and others too.<br/>
<br/>
There are similarities between rodeos and medieval tournaments.   That I <br/>
didn&#39;t read anywhere, but have seen myself from going to rodeos and reading about <br/>
tournaments (and hanging out with those who do some of the research--Steve <br/>
Muhlberger especially--and corresponding with some others.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kinda creepy in a fascinating kind of way. &lt;g&gt;   Or wait.   I think I <br/>
mean it&#39;s fascinating, in a creepy kind of way.<br/>

Aircraft mechanics wear them in southern NM.  My dad was a helicopter pilot/mechanic and all of his mechanic cronies wore them.  Since they often had to work with the rotor blades moving, you wouldn&#39;t want anything that may become untucked and tangled!  That could be ugly.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<br/>
Teddy boys in the UK (50&#39;s 60&#39;s ?) used to wear &#39;drapes&#39; and &#39;crepes&#39;  <br/>
The drapes I think were the trousers (might be the jacket) and the <br/>
crepes (pronounced crapes) were the shoes as they had a very thick <br/>
crepe sole.<br/>

  I&#39;d never heard them called  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Coveralls.<br/>
&gt; In Minneapolis and such wintry places they have some that are REALLY <br/>
&gt;HEAVY, super warm, insulated.   People in New Mexico had never heard <br/>
&gt;of such a thing.  Keith brought a pair back for a friend of his who&#39;s <br/>
&gt;a mechanic. Very  exciting. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
