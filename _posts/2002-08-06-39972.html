eloquently pointed out tonight (sorry, I&#39;m just quickly scanning <br/>
lists and don&#39;t recall names) we&#39;re all learning, all the time. From <br/>
your post I learned about someone I hadn&#39;t heard of before, but if I <br/>
do run across his name and/or music now it will have some meaning for <br/>
me, and your description of &quot;string quintets and beautiful ballads&quot; <br/>
sounds like something I&#39;d go out of my way to seek out. I loved the <br/>
word pictures you drew with your description of your relationship. It <br/>
made me do some thinking about relationships in general...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, please don&#39;t concern yourself about being off-topic on this <br/>
list. I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s possible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure they already did a Behind the Music on him. My dh and I were <br/>
talking about it last night after I mentioned this thread. We never listened <br/>
to Winger or groups in that genre. We called it all &quot;Pretty metal&quot;. Not our <br/>
taste. I guess poor old Kip got lumped in with those hair flippin, bleached <br/>
bond, overly sexed bands of the 80&#39;s for us. Anyway, after seeing Behind the <br/>
Music we had way more respect for Kip and his music. It was clear that he <br/>
was more of a thinking guy than his marketing would have led you to believe.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Loved part of the song that was written for YOU - how very special.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now all you need to do is call VH1 and tell them a bit of this, and they<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611137514">what sort of musician is <br/>
your husband?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The dabbling sort. He plays drums (which we don&#39;t have right now), <br/>
guitar and keyboard and in the past has played trumpet. He&#39;s a true <br/>
dabbler though, has written some lyrics and some acoustic stuff but <br/>
never really put the two together. <br/>
He isn&#39;t the type to be in a band unless they were like minded <br/>
enough, which won&#39;t happen. He doesn&#39;t have any desire to make money, <br/>
cuz then he&#39;d have to do what other people want him to. He&#39;d get <br/>
together with some guys that like the same music he does, just to <br/>
play, but he&#39;s never found anyone that wants to do that.<br/>
He loves Yes, Kansas, Collective Soul, Journey, Peter Frampton, Creed <br/>
etc.....very eclectic, we listen to opera, new age, rock almost <br/>
everything.<br/>
I love it when he plays guitar on the bed while I&#39;m falling asleep, <br/>
hasn&#39;t done that in a long time...sigh.<br/>

I&#39;ll watch then - with renewed interest!<br/>
