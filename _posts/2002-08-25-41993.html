 </span></blockquote>Well, I think I got my idea from what&#39;s done outside of the US. And I&#39;ve<br/>
heard of people having problems with homeschooling and base commanders. (It<br/>
*might* have been outside of the US though.) And I recall someone posting<br/>
asking for input for the military on homeschooling policy. And probably more<br/>
pieces that I thought all fit together in the same area but were apparently<br/>
from different parts of the puzzle.<br/>
