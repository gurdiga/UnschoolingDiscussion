<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342884513">It has been a very weird week so far...Monday we went to get title and insurance for the car that was given to us and then Tuesday we went to the library...we sure got lots of books and videos (cable was finally turned off on monday since we can no longer afford it) and then last night Naomi decided she wanted to finally write to her best friend a letter...so she did that and we didn&#39;t get into bed until 2 am! lol!! She&#39;s still sleeping right at the moment...today is gonna be a bit more relaxed...we putter around the house somewhat and then go get the car this afternoon (it has to have the valves adjusted) then evening dinner and service at the church. I&#39;m so glad that I don&#39;t work and that we can have days like this. Other days we have appointments, etc and so its a lot more hectic. Naomi doesn&#39;t like to read as much as I do...but me being the bookworm that I am, I read everything I like...heck, I still like reading children&#39;s books and they are always coming out with something new...I could never read all the children&#39;s books plus the adult books plus whatever comes out in a lifetime! It would take me at least 5,000 years just to read everything and probably wouldn&#39;t even catch up then!! I just discovered yesterday by looking at one row of children&#39;s section just how many countries there are and states and ....history! Oh boy!! I&#39;ve always loved history...and I guess I always will...so to some extent I probably will be reading alot of those in the days to come...didn&#39;t pick up any this time, but will eventually.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95439929">No bedtime was one of the joys of unschooling. Laurie often stayed up <br/>
all night reading and slept half of the next day. I made blackout <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673282243">I, too, am a night person and had to change when my DD&#39;s were smaller.  My 15 yo DD has tried to go to bed early and get up, but it is just not in her cards to be a morning person!  She is a night owl like me!  My 11 yo DD tries to stay up with her sometimes, but she is definitely a morning person!  So I tried to explain that to her.  The only problem I have is changing that bedtime too often.  If the circadian rhythm gets messed up by changing bed times, you really feel rotten the next day and beyond for about two weeks.  If I explain this to them, it empowers them to make the decision on how they feel by their actions.<br/>
<br/>
I read an interesting study about teens and their sleep patterns.  It stated that because of the constant hormonal changes in teenagers, that their circadian rhythms were constantly in an uproar, so most teenagers could not get up early, or go to bed early.  And they did much better if allowed an extra hour to sleep.  One school district even changed the morning arrival time to an hour later based on that study!<br/>

  &lt;&lt;No bedtime was one of the joys of unschooling. Laurie often stayed up <br/>
  all night reading and slept half of the next day. I made blackout <br/>
  curtains for her room so she could sleep when she needed to. I never <br/>
  saw this as a problem. She had no trouble adjusting her sleep <br/>
  schedule when she started college. She still has nights without <br/>
  enough sleep, but so do most students.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I fretted over my dd&#39;s sleep pattern for a long time, then realized that<br/>
  the only reason I did was because it wasn&#39;t the &quot;norm&quot;.  I stopped<br/>
  fretting, she get&#39;s plenty of sleep and that&#39;s the point.  I realize now<br/>
  that, minus the needs of a 3 year old, I would probably stay up all night<br/>
  and sleep until early afternoon too.  She likes the time after he falls<br/>
  asleep to not be bothered by a little brother and who can blame her for<br/>
  that?  LOL<br/>
