<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409129191">The first time Kirby was around drunken adults who were &quot;conversing&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(insulting each other loudly) he was really afraid.  My sister&#39;s <br/>
kids were <br/>
<br/>
just calmy watching TV--they had obviously heard it all before. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Quite honestly, I wouldn&#39;t want my kids around any drunken adults, either. <br/>
As I mentioned in my last post, my husband is loud, and I am not. And at first, <br/>
that loudness did scare me--not just his, but when I saw it at work (Italian <br/>
boss at the time). But I&#39;ve learned now that it&#39;s just their ways. I will admit <br/>
to &quot;Please, calm down...please, lower your voice&quot; on occasion with hubby though. <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I am saying that if a mom says she would prefer not to have her young <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
children visit in a home in which the parents yell at their children (not <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;HEY, come eat ice cream!&quot; but &quot;YOU IDIOT!&quot; and I thought that was clear <br/>
from <br/>
<br/>
the beginning), that if another person says kids need to be exposed to <br/>
other <br/>
<br/>
families&#39; practices, that if &quot;other families&#39; practices&quot; goes from kind of <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
yelling to blatant sexual abuse or crack-house-management, I think EVERY <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
mother will draw her own line somewhere. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think that there should be a clear distinction between yelling and <br/>
shouting and verbal abuse. That&#39;s not to say that occasionally a voice raised <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen in correction, but IMO, it should never include name <br/>
calling. Can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve much appreciated some of the recent name calling <br/>
here, either. :(<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 Pam is being overly criticized for drawing hers at parents who <br/>
yell.<br/>
<br/>
Why is that line bad, but other lines are good? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure that Pam&#39;s intentions are necessarily what others are <br/>
interpreting--but even if they are, it is her decision. I know that if you are <br/>
not used to loudness, regardless of its origin, it can send your stomach into <br/>
your throat, and make your heart race. It does to me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 If no lines are bad, and kids should be exposed to other lifestyles, <br/>
should I <br/>
<br/>
send my kids to do volunteer work at the crack house now so they&#39;ll not be <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
surprised when they come across it later in life? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
IMO, children are like plants that need to be nurtured. When they are ready <br/>
they can be hardened off and transplanted, but if done to soon it can be <br/>
disastrous. I realize there are some flaws in this analogy, but I think most of <br/>
you know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 From Pam&#39;s quiet-family point of view, abusive-in-face yelling is a bad <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thing.  It seems (perhaps I am wrong) that people here are <br/>
justifying <br/>
<br/>
yelling, but they&#39;re not talking about marine-drill-sergeant <br/>
yelling.  If so, <br/>
<br/>
the argument is missing its point and the insults on Pam are unwarranted <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(something else I&#39;ve been saying). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Again, I that is just what I am wondering...sometimes I hear what you are <br/>
saying and what I hear is not what you are saying kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>

We are students of words; we are shut up in schools, and colleges, and <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
recitation rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a thing. <br/>
<br/>
--Ralph Waldo Emerson <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is in fact nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of <br/>
<br/>
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in <br/>
need <br/>
<br/>
of freedom; without this it goes to wrack and ruin without fail.&quot; <br/>
