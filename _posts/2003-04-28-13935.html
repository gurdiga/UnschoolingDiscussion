<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170634538">It is too bad that there is a need for a regulations telling that parents<br/>
should not to leave children at home alone.  This should have a been a<br/>
matter of good senses.  Say that you baby child has just slept and you<br/>
needed to go to the drugstore across the street. You go.  It will not take<br/>
more than 4 min. (It might not be a case of Cupertino in CA, where it is<br/>
unlike that you would live in a place that there is a drugstore across the<br/>
street!)<br/>
<br/>
When dd was 5 yo, I would let her home alone and go for groceries one block<br/>
fm our apartment.  I never left her alone while she was asleep.  I would<br/>
make sure that she were awaken and that she knew that I would go for the<br/>
errands.<br/>
<br/>
Now that she is 8 yo, she goes by herself to the supermarket, one block fm<br/>
our apartment. She goes on her bicycle to her piano lessons, 7 blocks fm<br/>
apartment.  She tells me that she is going out to play with xx friend and do<br/>
not come back until the 6 o&#39;clock nationwide chime. The loudspeakers  tell<br/>
children that it is time to go home and ask the nearby adults to remind the<br/>
children that it time to go home. (During the winter, the loudspeakers are<br/>
turned on at 5 PM.  It is nationwide and these loudspeakers are placed in<br/>
various public places.  It was set to serve as messenger in case of a<br/>
emergency, like earthquake, and the system is daily tested by these calls. )<br/>
<br/>
Here in Japan, parents are not allowed to take their children to elementary<br/>
school.  They are grouped and march to school by themselves.  And comeback<br/>
home by themselves too.  If they have to cross a busy road/street, parents<br/>
take turns in the mornings to help the children cross the busy roads.<br/>
<br/>
While at public daycare&#39;s centers parents are supposed to take and pick up<br/>
their children.  They will only registered people at the center to pick up<br/>
the children.   Though the very next day that these same children begin<br/>
attending the elementary school, parents can&#39;t be with them.<br/>
<br/>
At first it was a choke to me. In Brazil many parents take their high school<br/>
children to and fm school.  The city streets are to violent.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard for foreigners to understand why children here are left to run<br/>
around its neighborhood at the young age of 6/7 yo. It takes time to let its<br/>
own children to do the same, even if the children were 9 or 10 yo.<br/>
<br/>
This is Tokyo, capital of Japan.</div>

night.  I sat watching it think it is a great unschooling movie!  At <br/>
the same time, I sat thinking of all the terrible things that could <br/>
happen letting a 6 year old run around a hotel like that!  The people <br/>
that could grab her, drag her into their rooms or their cars, do all <br/>
kinds of horrible things to her.  <br/>
<br/>
I live in a small town in Pennsylvania, United States.  It&#39;s not a <br/>
big city. Crime rate is considered to be low.  Yet, a year or so ago <br/>
a little girl (seven?) was outside playing in the alley behind her <br/>
home and was kidnapped.  She had been raped and killed and her body <br/>
found in the woods nearby. I didn&#39;t know the girl but my daughter&#39;s <br/>
friend did, and for the longest time she was afraid to play in my <br/>
yard, and transferred some of that fear to my daughter.  Every time a <br/>
car drove by she came running inside or ran over to me.  If a car <br/>
stopped, she asked if I knew them and why I thought they might be <br/>
stopping their car.  <br/>
<br/>
I am just now getting to the point where I will sometimes let my <br/>
almost ten year old go to a bathroom in Mcdonalds by herself. (I&#39;ve <br/>
heard horror stories about that too!)  I do let her ride her bike <br/>
around the block by herself but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to let her go <br/>
past our block.  Her dad takes bike rides with her to the end of town <br/>
almost daily.  <br/>

I agree w/ you.<br/>

Brianna can&#39;t go around the block w/o me. We live behind the library. There&#39;s maybe - 15 -20 feet where I can&#39;t see her when she goes there. She takes the cell phone & I &#39;walk&#39; with her.<br/>

 Everyday, I see very young children out on sidewalks all alone and I <br/>
pray for their safety.  I know I&#39;m paranoid but it&#39;s justified, I think. <br/>
 A friend of mine was in a mall near here with her 4 and a man tried to <br/>
grab her dd and she was RIGHT THERE.  So how easy would it be to grab a <br/>
defendless child off a sidewalk or out of a yard?  The trick is what to <br/>

tell your kids about kidnappers and molesters?   HeidiC.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415874506">When Brianna was six, I left her for 20 minutes w/ a &quot;friend&quot; - Kevin Soucy - aged 26. I had met his parents, he knew I was affiliated with the local HA group (I booked bands into their parties and set up at their events AND had a great time at their parties!). He knew that I had defended - physically - my home from a couple of drug dealers (looking for $$$ my daughter owed them)<br/>
He was setting up our first web site - in exchange for stock and we fed him when he worked at our home.<br/>
I left Brianna w/ him for 20 minutes while I ran to get pizza. I had been talked into it - &quot;She won&#39;t be any bother&quot; &quot;Mom, I really want to stay and work on my puzzle.&quot;<br/>
I went.<br/>
Let me say that I was extremely uncomfortable the whole time.<br/>
Upon my return - everything was fine - it was exactly the way I had left it.<br/>
<br/>
That night, Brianna was &quot;off&quot;. For the first time - she didn&#39;t want to watch Xena.<br/>
Brianna slept badly - she was grinding her teeth in her sleep - something she hadn&#39;t done in ages.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, I rec&#39;d a confession from Kevin Soucy.<br/>
He had molested Brianna.<br/>
<br/>
It was 2nd degree - no penetration<br/>
<br/>
He had told her he loved her and wanted to marry her.<br/>
She told him he was touching her in a bad way and that she was going to tell me.<br/>
He told her that I would call the police and he would go to jail and we would never have any money. He fondled her and continued to describe how he wanted to marry her.<br/>
<br/>
As I said - by the time I got home - Brianna was at the table - well, everything was as I had left it.<br/>
<br/>
He - the pedophile - Kevin Soucy thought about everything - and decided that since Briannawas going to tell me - he would beat her to the punch - so he confessed or rather - he explained. It&#39;s a chilling letter.<br/>
<br/>
I did all the right things.<br/>
Brianna is okay.<br/>
He went to jail and is out now and on 21 year suspended sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Brianna knows there&#39;s evil. She knows there are monsters.<br/>
Brianna knows there are junkies and takers, abusers and liars.<br/>
<br/>
She knows because it&#39;s part of our world and we live in the world.<br/>
At work - when we set up somewhere - we have to be careful of thieves. We see how greed is rampart in our society and how it effects us - on a day to day level.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t make the evil go away. We can&#39;t slay all the monsters. Whether the evil is one of &quot;My needs - as a human - are more important that the gray whales&quot; or &quot;My goals, as an American - are more worthy than the goals of an Iraqi&quot; or even &quot;Myneeds are more important than yours&quot;<br/>
Whether the evil is a disease - alcoholism or egomania or pedophilia or whatever......<br/>
<br/>
Brianna also knows that not every dragon is a monster and that sometimes, really handsome people are ugly inside.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most important things Brianna knows is that her intuition can & should be heard.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d rather have her safe than sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I know kids that do not know anything of these matters. How then, will they recognize the monsters??<br/>

  &gt;  &gt; Here in Japan, parents are not allowed to take their children to <br/>
  &gt;  elementary<br/>
  &gt;  &gt; school. <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;  And parents are comfortable being told that they&#39;re &quot;not allowed&quot; to <br/>
  &gt;  go somewhere with their child?  <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;  &gt; It is hard for foreigners to understand why children here are left <br/>
  &gt;  to run<br/>
  &gt;  &gt; around its neighborhood at the young age of 6/7 yo. It takes time <br/>
  &gt;  to let its<br/>
  &gt;  &gt; own children to do the same, even if the children were 9 or 10 yo.<br/>
  &gt;  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;  &gt; This is Tokyo, capital of Japan.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;  I watched Eloise at the Plaza, a Disney movie, with my daughter last <br/>
  &gt;  night.  I sat watching it think it is a great unschooling movie!  At <br/>
  &gt;  the same time, I sat thinking of all the terrible things that could <br/>
  &gt;  happen letting a 6 year old run around a hotel like that!  The people <br/>
  &gt;  that could grab her, drag her into their rooms or their cars, do all <br/>
  &gt;  kinds of horrible things to her.  <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;  I live in a small town in Pennsylvania, United States.  It&#39;s not a <br/>
  &gt;  big city. Crime rate is considered to be low.  Yet, a year or so ago <br/>
  &gt;  a little girl (seven?) was outside playing in the alley behind her <br/>
  &gt;  home and was kidnapped.  She had been raped and killed and her body <br/>
  &gt;  found in the woods nearby. I didn&#39;t know the girl but my daughter&#39;s <br/>
  &gt;  friend did, and for the longest time she was afraid to play in my <br/>
  &gt;  yard, and transferred some of that fear to my daughter.  Every time a <br/>
  &gt;  car drove by she came running inside or ran over to me.  If a car <br/>
  &gt;  stopped, she asked if I knew them and why I thought they might be <br/>
  &gt;  stopping their car.  <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;  I am just now getting to the point where I will sometimes let my <br/>
  &gt;  almost ten year old go to a bathroom in Mcdonalds by herself. (I&#39;ve <br/>
  &gt;  heard horror stories about that too!)  I do let her ride her bike <br/>
  &gt;  around the block by herself but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to let her go <br/>
  &gt;  past our block.  Her dad takes bike rides with her to the end of town <br/>
  &gt;  almost daily.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126953554">I&#39;ve mentioned this book before, but I think it is worth the repeat: Protecting the Gift.  He also wrote the Gift of Fear, but Protecting the Gift is written for parents.<br/>
<br/>
Although child abduction by a stranger is a real risk, it is MUCH smaller than the risk of a child being abused or abducted by a family member or by a &quot;friend&quot; of the family.<br/>
<br/>
This book gives concrete, realistic advice on protecting ourselves and our children from harm.<br/>
<br/>
In his book, he says that humans are the only animal who talk ourselves out of our fear.  Animals will run or hide when they feel they are in danger.  Humans tend to try to convince ourselves that we aren&#39;t really in danger.  Trust your gut, but also inform yourself and your children on ways to stay safe!<br/>

molestation living in &quot;the 2600 block of Central Avenue&quot;. Well, *we*<br/>
lived on the 2600 block of Central Avenue. I checked the guy&#39;s name in<br/>
the phone book and it turned out that he lived right across the street -<br/>
he was the man we called &quot;the Santa Claus man&quot; because he looked like<br/>
Santa Claus... we stood out on the front porch the next day while he was<br/>
getting into his car and I pointed him out as he left his house, being<br/>
quite obvious about it. He stopped and turned and looked at us, and I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure he knew what was going on. I told Rain what he had done, told<br/>
her that if he came over when she was playing out in the (fenced) yard<br/>
she could come and get me... the thing is, she hasn&#39;t been taught to obey<br/>
adults, we&#39;ve talked about the tricky things adults can say to get kids<br/>
to do things, and she has a pretty strong, intact sense of her own<br/>
self-efficacy and strength. She wouldn&#39;t make a good victim. I know I<br/>
can&#39;t make her invulnerable, but I do think these things help.<br/>
<br/>
I was victimized repeatedly as a kid - it was like I wore a sign saying<br/>
&quot;Abuse me&quot;, and in a way I think I did. I was emotionally needy,<br/>
unhappy...all the thngs that Rain isn&#39;t. Sometimes shit just happens -<br/>
Rain may have been abused at a preschool when she was 3, it&#39;s a confusing<br/>

I read an article today about crime and the media.  There was a study done<br/>
in the last few years that found that crime *news* on network TV had<br/>
increased 83 per cent from 1990 to 1998, even while the *incidence* of crime<br/>
dropped 20 per cent.  Homicides fell by a third in that time period, but<br/>
coverage increased almost 5-fold.  Interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145885062">Dar, Thank you so much for your post.<br/>
I read something called - &quot;Raising Street Smart Kids&quot; or something like that.....<br/>
and of course, there&#39;s common sense.<br/>
One of the most important aspects of this crime was that Brianna told me. She told me after Kevin Soucy used her dreams against her.<br/>
&quot;If I go to jail, then you&#39;ll never have a web site and that means you&#39;ll never have any money to buy a horse. You&#39;ll always be poor.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still, she told me.<br/>
She trusted me. She knew that I would defend her. She has compared me to a mother wolf, a mother bear and of course, Mother Coyote.<br/>
<br/>
They trust us. We must teach them self defense - be it ; emotional, spiritual, physical and intellectual.<br/>

Keeping Children and Teenagers Safe (And Parents Sane) by Gavin De<br/>
Becker.<br/>
He is a safety expert in the true sense, having been professional in the<br/>
field for many years. He emphasizes listening to and responding to your<br/>
intuition regarding your safety and that of your children. I recommend<br/>
this book for any parent but especially for mothers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166507248">Janis,   putting it really truly behind you is the most important thing. <br/>
 My mother was sexually abused by her father, uncle, and grandfather. <br/>
 The fact that it happened is sickening but it has had such severe <br/>
consequences her whole life.  To this day, she&#39;s still buying Forgive <br/>
and Forget type books and then not reading them.  She&#39;s never been able <br/>
to let it go and because of it, those men, all long dead, still continue <br/>
to manipulate and control her.  I believe she will carry her pain to her <br/>
own death and it breaks my heart that she&#39;s never been able to get past <br/>
it.  I&#39;m so glad Brianna has your strength and wisdom to deal with this <br/>
now, in her youth, so she can get on and live her life free of the pain. <br/>
 She&#39;ll always have it in her memories, unfortunately, but she can be <br/>
free of the pain.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that abuse often is from someone the child knows is a very hard <br/>
thing to teach children to be wary of.  I&#39;m definitely going to buy that <br/>
book everyone recommended.  So far all I&#39;ve done on this topic with the <br/>
girls is always made them aware that they own their bodies and if ANYONE <br/>
makes them feel uncomforable, they can always tell me without me being <br/>
upset with them.  I&#39;ve also encouraged them to trust their own feelings <br/>
about others.  But they are so little.  So I will continue to arm them <br/>
and myself with whatever weapons I can find.  Better safe then sorry. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652790176">My mother was, I guess you could say, promiscuous after all the crap she <br/>
went through with her family.  She got pregnant when she was 15 with her <br/>
boyfriend and gave the baby up for adoption. She never had the support <br/>
of her mother, who prefered to act as none of it ever happened.  And to <br/>
this day the one person my mom blames more then anyone is her mother, <br/>
because she could have stopped it but she never even tried.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, when my mom told my sister and I about her getting <br/>
pregnant as a teenager she told us she&#39;d been raped.  Years later, when <br/>
my half-sister found my mom and contacted her, then we found out that <br/>
the whole rape thing was made up for our benefit.  We were teenagers and <br/>
I guess my mom didn&#39;t want us to know she&#39;s been having consentual (I <br/>
think that&#39;s the right word) sex. And she NEVER talked to us about sex <br/>
beyond telling us we had to wait until we were married.  The whole thing <br/>
really scewed her up.  Well, of course it did.  It&#39;s sickening!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve always maintained that my girls do not have trust family <br/>
members just because they are family.  Trust is earned and if the girls <br/>
say they don&#39;t want to sit on someone&#39;s lap or go visit their house the <br/>
answer is ALWAYS okay.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have sons, but I think you did right by talking to Marty about <br/>
it.  Men need to understand what can shape a woman&#39;s decisions about sex <br/>
and that those decisions often are based on her self-esteem.   And girls <br/>
need to learn how not to become a victim through rape or the mental <br/>
manipulations that can be used on them when they are most succeptable, <br/>
escpecially during the preteen and teen years when what their peers <br/>
think becomes so important.     HeidiC.<br/>

here in Japan, it is a &quot;school request&quot;;  aprents have gone to school in<br/>
groups and so does their child as did the children&#39;s granparents. Parents<br/>
that haven chosen to send their child to a school that were not assigned by<br/>
the city office take the child to and from the school, though.  I meant<br/>
that, as a rule here, children are to learn to be on its own in a young age<br/>
of 6.<br/>
<br/>
As for after school schooling or classes  such as piano, Japanese language,<br/>
English, Math ...etc. many mothers go with their children.  That is the same<br/>
for shopping.<br/>
<br/>
I hardly ever saw 1st, 2nd, 3rd graders on its own at supermarket or<br/>
bakeries.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I got one call fm the school district allerting parents of child<br/>
molesters in the neighborhood. Dd said she knows him and that everytime she<br/>
sees him, all the children run.  I have not yet heard of kidnapping and or<br/>
child abuse in our area or nearby area.  But there are many cases of both<br/>
here too.  It is not as frequent and you see in the news of US or Brazil.<br/>
But there are cases and day by day child&#39;s abuse cases have been<br/>
disclosured.<br/>
<br/>
As many big metropolitan, Tokyo is full of danger. If I lived in  Cupertino,<br/>
Ca where I lived 17 years ago, I would not allow dd to friends house on her<br/>
own.  When I am in my mother home in Sao Paulo, Br. I do not let dd go to<br/>
the bakery acroos the street on her own.  I let dd run aroung the neiborhood<br/>
for  3, 4 hrs here in Tokyo, because I feel the safety.<br/>
<br/>
I have told her that nobody are allowed to make her do anything that she<br/>
feels uncomfortable even her father. Nobody are to touch her  in parts of<br/>
her body that she does not feel comfortable.  Even hugging on hand shaking.<br/>
She can always refuse and she should run home or scream.<br/>
<br/>
One big factor that makes me feel comfortable here in my neighborhood is<br/>
that there are many elderly in the area fm early morning to sun set.<br/>
Because apartments are small, they tend to go out.  Or if living in big<br/>
houses, but with daughter&#39;s in law, many tend to stick in the parks for<br/>
talks.  Even if we do have not talked to many of them, dd and I know them<br/>
and they know dd.  We had spent most of the last 8 years outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
love and peace</div>

  As for after school schooling or classes  such as piano, Japanese language,<br/>
  English, Math ...etc. many mothers go with their children.  That is the same<br/>
  for shopping.<br/>
<br/>
  I hardly ever saw 1st, 2nd, 3rd graders on its own at supermarket or<br/>
  bakeries.<br/>
<br/>
  Last year I got one call fm the school district allerting parents of child<br/>
  molesters in the neighborhood. Dd said she knows him and that everytime she<br/>
  sees him, all the children run.  I have not yet heard of kidnapping and or<br/>
  child abuse in our area or nearby area.  But there are many cases of both<br/>
  here too.  It is not as frequent and you see in the news of US or Brazil.<br/>
  But there are cases and day by day child&#39;s abuse cases have been<br/>
  disclosured.<br/>
<br/>
  As many big metropolitan, Tokyo is full of danger. If I lived in  Cupertino,<br/>
  Ca where I lived 17 years ago, I would not allow dd to friends house on her<br/>
  own.  When I am in my mother home in Sao Paulo, Br. I do not let dd go to<br/>
  the bakery acroos the street on her own.  I let dd run aroung the neiborhood<br/>
  for  3, 4 hrs here in Tokyo, because I feel the safety.<br/>
<br/>
  I have told her that nobody are allowed to make her do anything that she<br/>
  feels uncomfortable even her father. Nobody are to touch her  in parts of<br/>
  her body that she does not feel comfortable.  Even hugging on hand shaking.<br/>
  She can always refuse and she should run home or scream.<br/>
<br/>
  One big factor that makes me feel comfortable here in my neighborhood is<br/>
  that there are many elderly in the area fm early morning to sun set.<br/>
  Because apartments are small, they tend to go out.  Or if living in big<br/>
  houses, but with daughter&#39;s in law, many tend to stick in the parks for<br/>
  talks.  Even if we do have not talked to many of them, dd and I know them<br/>
  and they know dd.  We had spent most of the last 8 years outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
  love and peace<br/>
