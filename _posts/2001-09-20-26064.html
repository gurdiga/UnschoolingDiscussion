Many people&#39;s mailreaders go back through  the archives and pull quotes<br/>
and append them?  Cool.  It wasn&#39;t just the header that was directed at<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to sound flippant.  But go read her whole post.  She is talking<br/>
directly to me just as I am talking to you.  Whether she intended the<br/>
list of suggestions only for me is up for questioning and I&#39;ll concede<br/>
that it is a general list and very useful.  <br/>

that the mail reader obviously did.  You gave that as one of the reasons <br/>
you believed it was directed at you.  I was just pointing out something <br/>
about mail readers that you might not know.<br/>

at you?  If they were useful, use them.  If not ignore.  Is all this really <br/>
going to matter in 5 years?<br/>
