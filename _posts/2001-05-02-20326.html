<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322941143">My son gets a horrible diaper rash every time he eats apples! <br/>
we have to be very picky about what sorts of juices we buy along with other things like cereal bars ect.. any apple really makes his butt blister badly!<br/>
what a rough thing to be sensitive to!<br/>

  Does your child eat tomatoes, they can cause a rash from the acid. My nephew <br/>
  gets one every time he eats one doesnt bother him as much as it does his mom <br/>
  :) We are growing pineapple tomatoes this year for him as they do not have <br/>
  as much acid. Just a thought :)<br/>

  &gt; &gt; I tried to stop eating wheat products for a few short days a couple of<br/>
  &gt; &gt; months ago... failed.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;We have doing an elimination diet for a week or so now. . . no dairy, <br/>
  &gt;wheat,<br/>
  &gt;etc. . . basically chicken, meat, fish, most vegetables and fruits, olive<br/>
  &gt;oil. . . and that&#39;s about it. I thought it would be so much harder than it<br/>
  &gt;has been. We are  trying to find the source of a rash my 21 month old has. <br/>
  &gt;I<br/>
  &gt;actually think for him it could possibly be strawberries. But for me, <br/>
  &gt;getting<br/>
  &gt;off the dairy and wheat has helped me tremendously in the way I feel. I <br/>
  &gt;have<br/>
  &gt;not had this much energy in a very long time.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Everyone in the family loves brown rice pasta that I got so that has helped<br/>
  &gt;out a lot. We are eating so simple and I really would like to continue. . .<br/>
  &gt;what we did to start out was we got rid of or boxed up everything that we<br/>
  &gt;could not have, like pretzels, popcorn, and snacks that we could not eat. <br/>
  &gt;We<br/>
  &gt;never could have done it otherwise. . . last night the little one was <br/>
  &gt;asking<br/>
  &gt;for &quot;cookoo&quot; (cookie) . . .I really want to find some kind of receipe&#39;s <br/>
  &gt;like<br/>
  &gt;that for him. . . any ideas Kris?<br/>

  &gt;If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and <br/>
  &gt;then<br/>
  &gt;make a change.<br/>
