&gt; lol If people are interested in a discussion on heaven and hell, then<br/>
&gt; it does teach something.  What it teaches depends on where the<br/>
&gt; conversation leads and what the posters needed to get out of it.<br/>
&gt; Then again, I didn&#39;t have a problem with political discussions<br/>
&gt; either. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another interesting aspect of the heaven/hell discussion is what to<br/>
&gt; do if you are firmly convicted that you have a responsibility to God<br/>
&gt; to teach your children about God and the Bible.  How do you do that<br/>
&gt; with unschooling?<br/>

<br/>
Sorry, but we don&#39;t disagree at all ( ?^))  I feel that those posts are<br/>
fascinating, too (although I often wonder how people manage to &quot;live&quot; with<br/>
beliefs that depend utterly on other people&#39;s opinion).  My only point was<br/>
that while my posts were vociferously portrayed as OT, even as they were<br/>
being defended and discussed, the reason given was they didn&#39;t pertain to<br/>
unschooling. That opinion has been dismissed, partly because, as you say,<br/>
the posts have led to much diverse conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a responsibility to God to teach your children about God and the Bible.<br/>
&gt; How do you do that  with unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe that&#39;s parenting, not &quot;schooling.&quot;  It&#39;s &quot;values,&quot; not education<br/>
in the secular, state-required sense. It&#39;s about morality, duty, personal<br/>
ethics and virtue, not academic knowledge or skill. Unfortunately, some<br/>
parents believe they have God&#39;s permission to beat their children....that&#39;s<br/>
another story, but relevant, of course.<br/>
<br/>
It also seem safe to say that a parent who is &quot;convicted&quot; will pass those<br/>
convictions to the child even without explicit instruction, and in fact that<br/>
is probably the best way -- simply to demonstrate virtuous behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known people who have done that -- simply demonstrated exemplary<br/>
citizenship, sportsmanship with forgiveness, clarity, fairness, and what<br/>
happens is that they attract people to themselves who often can&#39;t help but<br/>
wonder how they became such fine people. At that point, the person looks at<br/>
his/her feet and modestly says that, well, I just try to follow the<br/>
teachings of the Bible, or Jesus, or maybe it&#39;s Buddha or Krishna or Ghandi<br/>
or Kahlil Gibran or Einstein<br/>
