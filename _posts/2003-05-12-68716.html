I have been to the HSC conference many times, at least 5.  I always got something out of it even though it&#39;s not strictly unschooling.  You can pick and choose among a lot of different speakers and workshops.  The vendor hall has some curriculum which I always ignored, but there&#39;s lots of other interesting stuff too.  You could maybe go for just one day as well.  As far as getting your husband interested in unschooling you are lucky to be thinking about it when your daughter is so young.  You will find that what you are doing now is unschooing and you can just continue on with it, letting her learn at her own pace.  I would suggest reading as much as you can here, on unschooling.com and checking out some books like The Unschooler&#39;s Handbook by Mary Griffith (btw, she is usually a speaker at the HSC conference).  Hope that helps!  Welcome, Kristin<br/>

Hi everyone,<br/>
My name is Melissa, I am a SAHM to 2 year old Karen.  My husband and I<br/>
have made the decision to homeschool for a million and one reasons,<br/>
very similar to the ones you all have I&#39;m sure.  After doing A LOT of<br/>
reading on the different ways of homeschooling, I&#39;ve decided that<br/>
unschooling would work best for us.  But (here it comes) now what?  <br/>
<br/>
My husband is more unsure of unschooling than I am.  He still has this<br/>
idea that we&#39;re going to be sitting around the kitchen table learning<br/>
about math one hour and science the next.  When I try to explain to<br/>
him that unschooling is learning through living....he just looks at me<br/>
like yeah, when do the text books come into it?  :)  But, at this<br/>
point, he&#39;s willing to trust my judgement and go with the flow.  I&#39;m<br/>
hoping to get some support here plus I guess I&#39;m still trying to<br/>
figure it out myself.  I was brought up in the public school system<br/>
and am still wondering myself so....what do you do with you kids all day?<br/>
<br/>
I also have one other question.  We live in the Central Valley of<br/>
California (Fresno to be exact) and I was thinking of attending the<br/>
HSC conference in Aug.  Is anyone here going or have been in the past?<br/>
 My husband works nights and weekends so, in order for me to go, I<br/>
will have to leave my daughter with in-laws over night.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you and I look forward to the support offered here,<br/>
Melissa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083973685">Thanks Kristen,<br/>
I actually just finished reading the Unschoolers Handbook and have<br/>
left it in the bathroom....hoping that my husband will read it as<br/>
well!  :)  I am thinking that I might only go for one day because I<br/>
just hate to leave my daughter overnight.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input,<br/>
Melissa<br/>
