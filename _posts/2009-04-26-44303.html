<div id="ygrps-yiv-263426095">I know that deschooling has been mentioned quite a bit over the last few days.  And I gather that the principle is to deschool ourselves as parents as much (or more) than deschooling our children.  <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d like to ask is how this process combines with ongoing (semi-)structured activity that enables a child to pursue their own passions. <br/>
<br/>
The last few days have been very interesting in this respect.  Certainly, Jess spends a lot more time on WoW/Sims/reading manga than ever.  But on Thursday, Jess and I went along to a home educators&#39; art workshop at a local art gallery.  When we got there we realized it was a fairly heavily structured mask-making activity.  Jess had done this at school ... several times!  So we left shortly after the session started and instead went shopping for manga books and some nice new pencils for Jess&#39;s own manga drawings.  I hope my suggestion that we take a look at the art workshop was in the spirit of &#39;strewing&#39; ... and at least the confidence with which I said &quot;Yes&quot; when she asked to leave feels like a sign of a small change in my thinking.<br/>
<br/>
On Friday, we went to one of the local home ed groups that Jess has keenly wanted to become involved with: a creative writing workshop with a local author.  Although the session did seem fairly structured, Jess adored it - it helped her unlock some techniques to build a fantasy world that her characters can live in.  Almost immediately after the session, she voluntarily wrote some quite detailed background to this fascinating world and shared it with the online writing group. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve since had a weekend that responds to her love of baroque recorder, going to hear the fabulous, iconoclastic group, Red Priest ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.piersadams.com/RedPriest/index.html">http://www.piersadams.com/RedPriest/index.html</a> ), and then taking her to play in a recorder orchestra concert.  Watching her smiling face, both while she listened to others and while she was playing, brought home to me how intensely she engages with this music.  Developing in the way she wants and at the speed she wants really does seem to entail her attending specialist lessons.  <br/>
<br/>
Which brings me back to my query: when deschooling is mentioned, I feel like it&#39;s supposed to be a full-scale sabbatical from all things deliberately educational.  Do I have this wrong?  Can deschooling effectively happen so long as the few consciously educational activities that a child is following are in pursuit of their most passionate interests, and so long as there&#39;s a willingness to discard any activities that pall?<br/>

<br/>
This is important.  Unschooling will never take without it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What I&#39;d like to ask is how this process combines with ongoing  <br/>
(semi-)structured activity that enables a child to pursue their own  <br/>
passions. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It depends on how structured, who chose it, and maybe who&#39;s driving  <br/>
and what is said in the car.<br/>
<br/>
That process doesn&#39;t combine with anything, though.   It is possible  <br/>
to continue activities like dance classes or park days without it  <br/>
being a problem.  It is possible for it to totally put the brakes on  <br/>
it, because it&#39;s not the what so much as the why and how.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We&#39;ve since had a weekend that responds to her love of baroque  <br/>
recorder, going to hear the fabulous, iconoclastic group, Red Priest ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.piersadams.com/RedPriest/index.html">http://www.piersadams.com/RedPriest/index.html</a> <br/>
  ), and then taking her to play in a recorder orchestra concert.  <br/>
Watching her smiling face, both while she listened to others and while  <br/>
she was playing, brought home to me how intensely she engages with  <br/>
this music. Developing in the way she wants and at the speed she wants  <br/>
really does seem to entail her attending specialist lessons. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s something she wants and it&#39;s not pressure or requirement or  <br/>
guilt-fed, I don&#39;t see a problem.  If adults around her give her  <br/>
messages indicating that at least she has one worthy pursuit, or that  <br/>
maybe she can find a career in music, you might want to interject that  <br/>
she&#39;s doing it for fun, and smile.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Which brings me back to my query: when deschooling is mentioned, I  <br/>
feel like it&#39;s supposed to be a full-scale sabbatical from all things  <br/>
deliberately educational. -=-   For the parent, especially, it should  <br/>
be a firebreak between the past life and the future--an effort to  <br/>
cleanse one&#39;s thinking of ideas like what&#39;s &quot;educational.&quot;  If you can  <br/>
hear the words you use aloud, at first, and then the phrases you  <br/>
think, you can see all the ways in which you (because of schooling,  <br/>
because of the cultural norms and expectations) have divided the world  <br/>
and categorized objects and activities into &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;just  <br/>
for fun&quot; (or whatever phrases come to you as you consider this).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Can deschooling effectively happen so long as the few consciously  <br/>
educational activities that a child is following are in pursuit of  <br/>
their most passionate interests, and so long as there&#39;s a willingness  <br/>
to discard any activities that pall?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The language of the question is stiff.   If you save it and look back  <br/>
on it after two or three years of unschooling, you&#39;ll know what I  <br/>
mean.   All its edges seem solid.  It&#39;s filled with dichotomy and  <br/>
dualistic walls and barriers.<br/>
<br/>
If those ideas can become transparent, wispy, airy, the questions will  <br/>
disappear.<br/>
<br/>
If you begin to make decisions based on what provides joy and  <br/>
learning, rather than what is educational or irritating, the very same  <br/>
world will look very different.  You won&#39;t need to &quot;discard  <br/>
activities&quot; if you see them for what they are rather than what they  <br/>
were advertised to be.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s about choice.  If your child really is choosing these activities<br/>
free to stop or change course, then your on the right path.<br/>
<br/>
One of the really big things that I&#39;ve seen from unschoolers, is knowing<br/>
how to learn, that learning and teaching aren&#39;t the same thing.  One can<br/>
choose to take a class to learn something and indeed learn a great deal,<br/>
but the learning is about the learner, more than it is about the teacher<br/>
imparting wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Classes can be used as a crutch to real learning.  Classes can be<br/>
extremely eye opening and world expanding.  It really depends on how the<br/>
person taking the class is experiencing the class.  Knowing without a<br/>
doubt that classes and educational activities are tools, one of but many<br/>
different tools to learning things, will help to see it within the<br/>
context of deschooling and real life learning.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841889435">I&#39;d add - if their kid has an interest and the parents first response is <br/>
to think of &quot;taking a class&quot; - then they should challenge themselves to <br/>
think of a half-dozen other ways that they could follow up on that <br/>
interest. And, &quot;get a book on it,&quot; can&#39;t be the only other option. And <br/>
one of the options might be being willing to listen to the kid talk <br/>
about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366560997">Thaks to you all for your advice on this.  I&#39;ll do my best to take it  on <br/>
board.  Sandra&#39;s comment about the dialectical way I was pitching one  way of <br/>
thinking against another felt absolutely spot on - I just hope it  <br/>
gradually becomes easier to go with the flow and not see things as stark  opposites.<br/>
 <br/>
I would like to clarify the situation regarding &quot;classes&quot;.  The  workshops <br/>
I was referring to were things that Jess said she wanted to attend  because <br/>
her friends would be there and she wanted to spend some time with  them.  <br/>
Some live quite far away from us and these were perhaps  the only mutually <br/>
convenient venues and dates for a few weeks.  I knew  that the actual content <br/>
of one workshop would suit her (her words: she  &quot;couldn&#39;t wait to do creative <br/>
writing with a real author!&quot;) and  that the other might not, but it wasn&#39;t <br/>
really a question of offering to  take her to &quot;a class&quot;.  Rather than being <br/>
about &#39;educating&#39; her, it  was a chance to get out and about among people <br/>
she likes.  When she  wasn&#39;t enjoying the more &quot;schooly&quot; session and we <br/>
realized she didn&#39;t have much  chance to socialize there either, we came away.<br/>
 <br/>
As for the one-to-one music lessons... we talk a lot about music, we can  <br/>
appreciate lots of things together  and she can share her  enthusiasms with <br/>
me.  But, when it comes to developing the baroque  ornamentation, <br/>
articulation and use of vibrato (and suchlike)  that she personally and of her own <br/>
choice, wants to master, then it&#39;s  nice for her to get to this by playing her <br/>
music to an interested expert  observer who can then give her constructive <br/>
feedback and share their  understanding of what is a very specific technique.  <br/>
 We  could (and do) look this stuff up together, and we certainly enjoy  <br/>
listening to it together ... but she doesn&#39;t like playing it with me, as I&#39;m <br/>
too  grounded in other styles, and it&#39;s great for her to spend time with <br/>
people  who&#39;ve done it for real. I know that Sandra and a couple of others were  <br/>
asking if this interest is Jess&#39;s rather than something driven by a desire <br/>
to  please the adults around her.  I think it is.  She does  it out of <br/>
fascination and fun and because the music moves her.  She  does feel &quot;clever&quot; <br/>
when she gets something new, but not in a &quot;top of the  class&quot; competitive kind <br/>
of way.  Certainly, she doesn&#39;t feel - and is  not made to feel - that she <br/>
should do music because it&#39;s a potential  profession (probably the opposite, <br/>
because she&#39;s seen what it&#39;s like to  have 2 out of work musos as parents!). <br/>
 But she likes to figure this stuff  out, and she has eventually (by <br/>
process of elimination) found a couple  of inspirational adult mentors who help <br/>
her to do this at her own pace and  to suit her own style.  Which was where my <br/>
query came from - if she&#39;s  taking a holiday in order to deschool, what do <br/>
we  do about music, which is a major holiday activity for  her?    <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry, this is another long post, but it does feel like the devil&#39;s in  the <br/>
detail.<br/>

<br/>
If that never was school to her, don&#39;t worry about it.  If unschooling  <br/>
gives her more time to play and listen to baroque music, good!  If  <br/>
we&#39;re ever in the same place, ask her to let me play with her.  I love  <br/>
baroque music.  I&#39;m down to one decent alto recorder these days, but  <br/>
it&#39;s workable.   New Mexico&#39;s not ideal for recorders, it turns out.   <br/>
After 25 or 30 years, they dry out, and the cork falls off, and  <br/>
sometimes the wood cracks. &lt;g&gt;  I didn&#39;t know that until recently!<br/>
