&lt;&lt; you might check with your local ag extention<br/>
 office and see if their is a local 4-H&#39;er that would &quot;mentor&quot; your son when<br/>
 he first gets his rabbit.  The older kidlets had 4-H show rabbits and they<br/>
 mentored new rabbit owners. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just changed to digest as there are far too many e-mails for me to read but <br/>
did like the response about rabbits.  thank you I will check and see about <br/>
meeting some other kids that have rabbits before we embark on this epic <br/>
journey.<br/>

&lt;&lt; once again I&#39;m mega-fed-up with the <br/>
 whole tidying-up thing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Tracy:<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve gone to the &quot;twice a day clean up&quot;, just after lunch, before Max goes <br/>
down for his nap, we sing the &quot;clean up&quot; song and we put toys in crates and <br/>
containers, not necessarily back in their rooms and baby goes down for a nap. <br/>
 Zak can then get out whatever he wants, and he usually wants his train <br/>
track, although he&#39;s been building robots out of legos lately.  We build <br/>
while I&#39;m watching BBC America, Changing Rooms, to get some ideas on <br/>
decorating and I don&#39;t feel so stressed out.  Then hubbie does the 2nd clean <br/>
up with Zak just before Max goes to bed and then hubbie and Zak pull out <br/>
something to play with (I&#39;m not around for that part as I work in my office). <br/>
 Hubbie and I clean up any left overs when Zak goes to bed.  This seems to <br/>
have been working for us.  It&#39;s not perfect and I&#39;m learning that&#39;s ok, but I <br/>
at least feel it&#39;s somewhat tidy for some of the day, especially when I&#39;m <br/>
sitting with my tea watching Changing Rooms.<br/>
<br/>
The other problem of the hubbie is a different kettle of fish.  My husband <br/>
has a problem with me not cleaning the bathrooms.  I refuse to do it, so he <br/>
has to.  He&#39;s tried to go more than a week but can&#39;t so he ends up cleaning.  <br/>
I think it&#39;s who it means the most too ends up doing it, unless you both care <br/>
about it the same.  Hubbie likes a tidy house as much as I do so it&#39;s not a <br/>
problem.  However getting him to move things from the kitchen counter and <br/>
putting them in their proper place is another matter and as long as it <br/>
matters more to me than him I guess I&#39;ll continue doing that.<br/>
<br/>
When things get to where I&#39;m annoyed it&#39;s definately time for a sit down chat <br/>
with hubbie about how I&#39;m feeling.<br/>
