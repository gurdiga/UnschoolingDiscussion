I am generally a lurker here and have not even been doing thayt much lately<br/>
as we prepare for our fourth child&#39;s arrival.  I felt compelled to respond<br/>
to your post since our toddler has also had more than her share of croup<br/>
epoisodes.  And she has gotten it last summer as well as this summer!<br/>
    The virus causing croup is the same one that cause laryngitis in older<br/>
children and adults.  Because its a virus,  it will need to run its course;<br/>
though treating the symptoms is important!<br/>
    You are correct that cold air is one treatment and steam a second.   Our<br/>
physican explained that the reason cold air is the first treatment chioce is<br/>
due to the fact that it will reduce the swelling in the tracheal area of the<br/>
throat.  Steam (cool air, if possible....warm if need be)  can help also.<br/>
The difficulty lies in the fact that your child&#39;s airway can be potentially<br/>
blocked from the swelling,  making breathing impossible if not difficult.<br/>
For this reason,  the late night ER may be your best option.<br/>
    We try a cool humidifier for 10-15 minutes during summer months.   If<br/>
breathing remains labored and the barking cough is still present,  we zoom<br/>
th ethe ER.   Last summer,  our dd did require steroid treatment to reduce<br/>
the swelling  and keep her airway passage clear.<br/>
    Our dau also has tracheo-laryngeal malaysia,  a generally<br/>
non-threatening condition in which the thrachea and larnyx are not fully<br/>
open.  This condition is something which she will,  indeed almost has,<br/>
grown out of.<br/>
    The croup virus is particularly harder on her because of her smallr<br/>
opening.  The specialist who diagnosed her told us that many children have<br/>
this condition,  but it is often undiagnosed because it doesn&#39;t particulary<br/>
cause any problems or even strong symptoms.  (For dd,  her breathing as an<br/>
infant was &quot;too loud&quot; to me,  especially when she was asleep.  I was<br/>
insistent with our physician that this was &#39;odd&#39;  and,  had it checked<br/>
further because it related to such an important function as breathing!)<br/>
    Best of luck to you!  Summer croup is really scary!!<br/>

Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I need some good motherly (Or fatherly!) advice.  My 22 month old has<br/>
croup again.  My other two children never had it and in my family I grew<br/>
up in none of us ever had it, so I&#39;m not overly sure how to treat it.  I<br/>
know about the steam and taking the child out into the cold air trick<br/>
but this is summer so what do I do?  Also, when he&#39;s had it before (this<br/>
might be his 4th episode), it&#39;s always happened at night and by day he&#39;s<br/>
fine.  This time it started at 8 this morning and is continuing through<br/>
the day...is it going to get worse tonight yet?  He seems basically<br/>
fine, is not breathing with great difficulty, just wheezing alot.  We<br/>
all do have bad colds right now so it&#39;s extra tough for him breathing<br/>
when he&#39;s so congested.  Any advice, information or tips please?  I&#39;d<br/>
appreciate anything anyone has to offer.  A friend in the past told me<br/>
to try homeopathy and I did try a couple of doses this a.m. and it did<br/>
not seem to help at all.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

Sonia,<br/>
It sounds to me like this is more than a simple case of croupe. It sounds<br/>
like asthma. I would suggest you talk to your pediatritian about getting him<br/>
going on some asthma meds (prob. albuterol and cromolyn mix) via nebulizer.<br/>
I am an asthmatic mom of three asthmatic children and believe me when I tell<br/>
you, diagnosing and treating asthma at a young age can mean much less<br/>
treatment and probs. I was not dx&#39;d until this year and I have a lot of<br/>
damage to undo. All of my kids were dx&#39;d early on in life and 2 out of the 3<br/>
only need meds when they have colds . Please talk to your dr.<br/>
