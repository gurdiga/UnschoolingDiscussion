him to the chair? Inject him with Versed when he&#39;s not looking? Lie and trick <br/>
him?<br/>
Control over children is an illusion unless you are willing to break their <br/>
will. When you allow the small choices in life  when they are younger, they <br/>
will have the opportunity to *experience* the consequences of their <br/>
decisions, good or bad. They don&#39;t just have to take our &quot;wiser adult&quot; word <br/>
for it. They don&#39;t have to be punished to &quot;teach&quot; consequences. They LEARN <br/>
them.<br/>
Allow them the choices. TRUST in your children.<br/>
Don&#39;t just throw &quot;Well, What if this should happen&quot;&#39;s at us because we can <br/>
discuss What If&#39;s forever and never touch a fractions of all the variables.<br/>
Look at your children TODAY. Look at all the wonderful decisions they are <br/>
making, some because of your input, some in spite of it. Look at their <br/>
ability to learn. Not just academics, but people skills, personal boundaries, <br/>
body consciousness. All by making choices, big and small.<br/>
Trust them. If you love and respect and trust them, they will have all you <br/>
want for them.<br/>

<br/>
As the adult, I try to be really really REALLY careful about why and when I <br/>
predict the future, that I describe ALL the possible consequences and not <br/>
concentrate on what I fear, or worst cases, while ignoring possible good <br/>
outcomes. I try to make sure I truly understand the long term consequences <br/>
myself before I discuss them with my child. Usually, they&#39;re not all that <br/>
clear cut, as for instance in your examples so far. Any orthodontist who <br/>
tells you that your child will definitely have a certain condition in 20 <br/>
years with no current problems is lying. <br/>
<br/>
**How in the world are you going to force a child to have braces put on?**<br/>
<br/>
Say you do manage to force them. What would be the point? Any orthodontist <br/>
will tell you that without patient cooperation and motivation the treatment <br/>
will have questionable results and is likely to revert afterwards. I know <br/>
plenty of kids who didn&#39;t want braces, didn&#39;t use their bands consistently, <br/>
ignored brushing instructions and so had decay problems, and managed to lose <br/>
their retainers as soon as possible after getting them. Seems like a huge <br/>
waste of time, money, and energy to me. On the other hand kids who choose <br/>
braces seem to cooperate with the treatment and end up happy with their <br/>
results.<br/>
