P.S.  Sandra-I hope you don&#39;t mind me quoting you in my  tagline.  I just <br/>
found that what you said was so  profound;-)<br/>

==============<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t mind at all. <br/>
Cool! <br/>
 <br/>
-=- I really just don&#39;t like her to eat all of that junk that has all of  <br/>
these unnatural things in them. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Then don&#39;t buy it.  Find candy without a lot of unnatural  things.<br/>
