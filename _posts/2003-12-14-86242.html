<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes memory aids aren&#39;t straightforward but they&#39;re easier than what<br/>
&gt; someone is trying to memorize. Every Good Boy Deserves Favor, Roy G. Biv, --<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s one for the planets that I&#39;m forgetting -- don&#39;t have anything to do<br/>
&gt; with music, colors (or planets if I could remember it) but they&#39;re catchy<br/>
&gt; and help someone remember something that doesn&#39;t have an obvious pattern or<br/>
&gt; obvious visual or other relationship to what it&#39;s representing.<br/>

book -- the memorizer takes lists of unrelated items and creates vivid pictures <br/>
in his own mind (the weirder the better) and plugs them all into some <br/>
relationship between them (maybe seeing all the items hanging on a tree or positioned <br/>
along one street of houses or storefronts.) <br/>
<br/>
      But it&#39;s just one tool. I agree memory is way overrated in schoolish <br/>
thinking as the equivalent of learning. So imo, memory &lt; learning.  JJ<br/>
<br/>
p.s. mnemonic comes from the Greek root for &quot;remember&quot; -- didn&#39;t remember, <br/>
just looked it up. :)<br/>
