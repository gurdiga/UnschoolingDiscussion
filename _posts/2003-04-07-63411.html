&lt;&lt; More I am worried that *who* I am is not a good enough<br/>
example of this kind of learning.  That ultimately I am too well-trained<br/>
by our larger culture and its measures and definitions of achievement,<br/>
productivity, creativity and success to be able to model the kind of<br/>
self-motivated activity that unschooling is supposed to foster in<br/>
children.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Does this make sense? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure!<br/>
<br/>
If you have a child who was in school two years, the generally applied <br/>
formula says he&#39;ll recover from that in a couple of months.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you were in school from twelve to seventeen years.  Could be <br/>
more.  Maybe you were lucky, and it was not that long.<br/>
<br/>
That gives you at LEAST a year to recover.  More if you taught and so were <br/>
invested in providing and maintaining structured education.<br/>
<br/>
I think movies are the most productive thing for this switchover.  It&#39;s a <br/>
solid vein in a gold mine of ideas.    Just start anywhere and step from one <br/>
movie to another like walking on rocks in a shallow stream.    At the moment <br/>
we&#39;re on Charlton Heston movies.  We&#39;ve just watched two westerns, Will Penny <br/>
and The Big Country.  Next we&#39;re going to science fiction.  Historic epics, <br/>
we own and have known for years--Ben Hur, El Cid, The Ten Commandments.  <br/>
Soylent Green next.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that we&#39;re studying Charlton Heston, it&#39;s that we&#39;re using him as a <br/>
thread to decide which dot to jump to next.  For a while here it was Kevin <br/>
Smith.  LOTS of Kevin Smith in January/February (that&#39;s Silent Bob, to some <br/>
of you, maybe, and &quot;who!?&quot; to others).  <br/>
<br/>
And this Charlton Heston thing, it&#39;s mostly Keith (my husband) and me.  We&#39;re <br/>
not &quot;making&quot; kids watch with us.  They&#39;re in and out.  We&#39;ve shown Marty the <br/>
good parts, as he has a particular interest in westerns.   Charlton Heston <br/>
wrote in his autobiography that aside from jazz, the western movie is the <br/>
most uniquely American contribution to the arts.  (I&#39;ll look the exact quote <br/>
up if anyone really cares.  He said it better.)<br/>
<br/>
So if you start your own movie dot-to-dot, even if it&#39;s just one movie a <br/>
week, you&#39;ll start to see patterns and start to be conversant about details, <br/>
and that will lead to reading about the people, and maybe finding other <br/>
movies by the same directors, or with some of the other actors.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s WAY easier (and more useful, I think, for being so multi-faceted) than <br/>
assigning yourself to learn about ancient Chinese swords or Faberge <br/>
enamelling, where you&#39;ll be limited to books and maybe owning one or two <br/>
pieces (MAYBE) and the kids might not care.<br/>
<br/>
Movies have costumes, props, sets, MUSIC, dialog, speeches in the scripts <br/>
which can take your breath away and change your life, acting, stunts, <br/>
horses/tanks/fantasy contraptions.<br/>
<br/>
And they&#39;re relaxing, too.  And moms who are tense about learning NEED to <br/>
relax.<br/>
