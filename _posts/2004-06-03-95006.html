I love this analogy!<br/>
<br/>
I teach writing to homeschooling families online and often answer <br/>
questions like, &quot;How much writing should I have her do?&quot; and &quot;What <br/>
grammar program do you recommend?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The way I work with families who aren&#39;t unschoolers is to help them <br/>
tune into their kids more and more. When I first joined this list, <br/>
Sandra talked about gradually saying yes more often rather than saying <br/>
&quot;We&#39;ve removed all limits.&quot; She also talked about spending more time <br/>
with my kids and focusing on their interests rather than focusing on <br/>
mine for them. I do this with writing and language arts. I help moms to <br/>
shift their focus from teaching a subject to knowing their children and <br/>
seizing opportunities to encourage them in their writing.<br/>
<br/>
I took to unschooling partly because this is how I teach writing. I <br/>
help mothers to become more in tune with who their kids are. We don&#39;t <br/>
start with the assumption that kids need to be &quot;taught&quot; writing but <br/>
rather that our kids are interesting people whose thoughts deserve to <br/>
be recorded and shared (whether by them or for them by the mom).<br/>
<br/>
So when helping a homeschooling mom, to me the first step is to help <br/>
her become aware of her children. Instead of seeing them as willful or <br/>
as uncooperative or people to be taught, help her to see the ways that <br/>
her children are already bright, interesting, reasonable people. Help <br/>
her to see how she can nurture them, even if she is still holding onto <br/>
the security of following a program.<br/>
<br/>
If we help moms head in that direction (in the direction of seeing <br/>
their children as delightful people who love to learn), they will more <br/>
likely keep travelling down that road (and using jj&#39;s analogy, they <br/>
won&#39;t be content to stop at the horsefarms and highway, but will get to <br/>
DisneyWorld eventually). I&#39;ve had more moms share that the best thing <br/>
about changing how they see writing is that they have improved their <br/>
communication with their kids and know them better. Isn&#39;t that the way <br/>
to begin? We don&#39;t want moms to have to focus on whether their kids are <br/>
learning x, y or z (through unschooling or homeschooling), but on what <br/>
neat people they get to live with and grow with. Then the learning has <br/>
a chance to be transformed and will fall into place.<br/>

That&#39;s pretty sneaky.<br/>
I like it.<br/>
<br/>
(I know, it&#39;s not sneaky, but the effect of that shift of thinking won&#39;t stop <br/>
with writing!  Good for you!  Good for them.)<br/>
