 Since this is on the DNC site, it is obviously meant to be a negative <br/>
 attack on Bush, but it has the opposite effect on me. It makes it <br/>
 clear that the DNC must be in favor of more regulation and supportive <br/>

Has anyone seen an actual platform plank from the Dems spelling out their <br/>
position on hsing?  I have looked in several places but have not seen <br/>
anything that addresses hsing specifically. <br/>

Thanks.<br/>
