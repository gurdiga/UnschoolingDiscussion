think it important enough to spend the requisite amount of time on? <br/>
Unlikely for a historical event like that, but possible.  To me, it <br/>
just points out the need for parents to always question their <br/>
assumptions and <br/>
keep on learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing: as I posted, that very point occurred to me.  I taught <br/>
high school English for 4 yrs, and of COURSE students asked me things <br/>
I did not know the answers to  But I&#39;m still curious as to what <br/>
others will say!  <br/>
<br/>

Ok, here&#39;s my next issue: will I be a poor unschooler if I just don&#39;t <br/>
FEEL like learning right along with my kids?  It seems like you all <br/>
are just OUT THERE all the time, learning, volunteering, <br/>
researching.  If that&#39;s not one&#39;s personality, wouldn&#39;t it be better <br/>
to just homeschool or even *gasp* P/S?  Part of me loves learning and <br/>
researching, but then there are times when I get SO TIRED and don&#39;t <br/>
feel like doing much besides lurking on computer websites ;)  and <br/>
watching tv.  I don&#39;t sew, do crafts, or take classes on my own.  I <br/>
just cook regular dinners, nothing fancy or gourmet.  Sometimes <br/>
listening in on you guys makes it seem like you all are constantly <br/>
going to museums and fairs and volunteering and making tents (!) and <br/>
stuff!  Very intimidating to think about!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;SHEILA answered much the same way, &quot;gee now you&#39;ve got me <br/>
 </span></blockquote>curious&quot;  what if you just DON&#39;T CARE what the difference is between <br/>
a grasshopper and a cricket, for example?  I can already feel the <br/>
guilt!!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this may be because I just had my second baby in May and <br/>
I&#39;m thinking if I&#39;m this tired now, what will I feel like if I have 4 <br/>
or 5 kids??  *LOL*<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling will be better, and you will have a better time, if you do get <br/>
into the learning with them. But for me it didn&#39;t happen all at once. The <br/>
joy of learning and doing is contagious. I myself was completely damamged as <br/>
a recovering &quot;A&quot; student and college graduate. I had all the love of inquiry <br/>
sucked right out of me. My kids brought it back.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It seems like you all are just OUT THERE all the time, learning, <br/>
&gt;&gt;volunteering, researching.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not always. We all have our down times, it&#39;s just more fun to share the up <br/>
times I guess. Want to hear about last week when I was so fatigued that I <br/>
stayed in bed for 48 hours? ;-) There&#39;s also those weeks where no one seems <br/>
to have any cool ideas and so we just veg a lot with TV and movies. It comes <br/>
in cycles. It&#39;s part of life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If that&#39;s not one&#39;s personality, wouldn&#39;t it be better to just homeschool <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. Even in school they&#39;re only going 6 hours a day, 180 days a year. That&#39;s <br/>
NOT 24/7. And we all know how much wasted time there is in a supposed school <br/>
day anyway. And parading homeschooling materials in front of them might make <br/>
you feel beter for awhile, but wait until you feel like you have to force <br/>
them to come to the table and &quot;do this work!&quot; Talk about exhausting! How <br/>
much easier and productive to visit the library and bring home 20 cool new <br/>
books plus 3 new interesting videos, or to take a leisurely look through a <br/>
museum or botanical garden, or to bake a cake....<br/>

<br/>
You have your hands full! Give yourself a break. My kids are 8 and 13. I <br/>
assure you my posts would be much different if the kids were still babies. <br/>
You&#39;d hear a lot more stories about blowing bubbles, sidewalk chalk, <br/>
painting with water and SLEEPING. :o)<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
