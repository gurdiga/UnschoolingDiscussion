Come to So. Cal, my dh will let you climb up on the hook & ladder. In <br/>
fact, he loves to help the kids and the parents climb up there so they <br/>
can check it out.  He is very careful and helps them up there, but <br/>
loves to watch them get all excited about his love, being a fireman.  <br/>
My dd and I do all the time.  Sorry you missed out.<br/>
Kay</div>
