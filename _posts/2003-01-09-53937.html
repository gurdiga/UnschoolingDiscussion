&lt;&lt; Regarding hygiene, my kids are all big into showers, sometimes 2x day. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here!! My five y.o. dd has been taking up to three a day. The dialogue <br/>
around here is about not taking so many!! &quot;Sierra, I don&#39;t think you need <br/>
another shower today!! Could you PLEASE wait?&quot; is very commonly heard.<br/>

have take Kathryn&#39;s showers! No wonder she can only take a shower once a<br/>
week!<br/>

I KNEW there was a reason people shouldn&#39;t shower so much! <br/>
I&#39;ll tell Sierra to share the wealth....:)<br/>

bath to play in the water, and later a shower, and maybe another shower later <br/>
if she had played outside in the dirt.<br/>
<br/>
So last week when she kept announcing how many days it had been since she had <br/>
showered, and it got up to a week, nobody said &quot;eeyew!&quot;  We all just looked <br/>
at her and said &quot;Huh&quot; or &quot;Weird&quot; or &quot;why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She had never known what it would feel like just NOT to shower, and with <br/>
nothing much on the schedule, she was checking that out.  She had no fiddle <br/>
class or acting classes during the New Year&#39;s week, and so she just kind got <br/>
up every day and counted how many days.<br/>
<br/>
She took a shower to go somewhere on the 8th day.  <br/>
<br/>
Then she asked me to cut her hair.  Now it&#39;s a shower a day for hair-styling <br/>
purposes.  It&#39;s too cold for it to be fun to take more.<br/>

I suspect that Sierra is showering for the very reason that it&#39;s cooler now!<br/>
Our house is old and all  hardwood floors...it&#39;s made for the heat of FL and <br/>
isn&#39;t very warm on those cooler days and nights. A warm shower feels <br/>
wonderful, so I think she&#39;ll go back to less when it warms up again.<br/>
