 </span></blockquote>Nancy, I had my son vacc. regularly as an infant,  up to 18mos. at which <br/>
point he was asthmatic, and became very ill, actually sick for 10 weeks with thet <br/>
famous &quot;measle-like rash&quot; and finally suffering actual mumps from the vacc. He <br/>
is now almost 8 and has not been done since. However he gets verys  sick <br/>
frequently, not able to fight viruses etc., and after doing some reading, I <br/>
believe this is linked to being vaccinated. My daughter is  2, was never vacc&#39;ed and <br/>
has had 3 colds in her life, that is it!!! She is happy, healthy and I <br/>
believe that is due in part to not being done. Both children were exclusiviely <br/>
breastfed, my son till 5.5 years old, my dd is still a nursing fiend. Just my own <br/>
experience. <br/>
