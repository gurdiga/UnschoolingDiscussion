<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490947359">Hi Danielle,<br/>
I will be at the MD conference.  Look for me representing the local support group MAHE (Mt Airy Home Educators).  I am not sure where the unschoolers will hang out most of the day.  Seems like I remember a post about that...maybe Billy (of Fun books) will know.  See ya there.<br/>
Beth in MD (of course)<br/>
