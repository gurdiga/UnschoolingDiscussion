<div id="ygrps-yiv-377956214">I have a request for some of you. There is 15y.o. unschooled teen that is a <br/>
member of my support group and she is looking for hosts to stay with over the <br/>
next couple of months. She&#39;s heading out next week and just staying wherever <br/>
and traveling until she feels like coming home.<br/>
This is a very fun and interesting young lady. She&#39;s vegan and a peace <br/>
activist and into a lot of different hobbies.  We&#39;ve really enjoyed getting to know <br/>
her and I&#39;m sure she&#39;d make a great guest!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s mainly traveling around the Eastern half of the country (up towards NY <br/>
and the Carolinas and such) but may be heading out West to meet up with her <br/>
Mum in San Francisco. Her Mom is doing some traveling nursing this summer.<br/>
So if any of you would like to host her for a bit, please write me and I&#39;ll <br/>
give you her email addy. She&#39;s leaving next Thursday, so let me know soon if <br/>
you can.<br/>
Thanks all,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224015274">This response holds true for any unschoolers (and families) traveling<br/>
around. We are on the spectacular Hawaiian island of Kauai. . . we being<br/>
me, (mom-Lee), Sky (19 year old young boy-man), Nell (16 year old young<br/>
girl-woman) and Bay (12 year old boy-almost man). We adore hosting<br/>
unschooling teens. <br/>
<br/>
I know when I mentioned that Sky was antsy to get on the road some, several<br/>
kind souls posted that he had an invitation to visit. He still holds those<br/>
homes as options. His latest adventure is taking him to Nova Scotia for a<br/>
session at the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts this summer, and then across<br/>
Canada by train to return home. Any unschoolers enroute in Nova Scotia,<br/>
Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Lee,<br/>
<br/>
We are in Vancouver (well, a suburb, actually) and would love to meet <br/>
Sky.  My dd is 8, but we know some unschooled teenagers, if he&#39;d like <br/>
to connect with them.  I could put the word out on the local email <br/>
list and on the Vancouver website, if he would like.  When would Sky <br/>
be here, approximately?  And does he need a place to stay before <br/>
flying home?<br/>
<br/>
What a trip he&#39;ll have by train!  Some of the scenery is truly <br/>
spectacular. I moved to B.C. by train from Ottawa, Ontario in the <br/>
dead of winter years ago.  I hope to cross the country by train with <br/>
my family someday, but I think I&#39;d like to go in the late summer or <br/>
fall when the leaves turn.<br/>

with some unschoolers. If that is not a problem.<br/>

list as well. I am in Nova Scotia and would put a travelling unschooler up <br/>
for a bit. We live in the capital area (Halifax/Dartmouth). My family also <br/>
has a cottage close to Cape Breton where we spend some time in the summer <br/>
and fall.<br/>

 I think I&#39;m to late to respond to Ren&#39;s request, but I thought I would let<br/>
 Lee and everyone else know that we&#39;d definitely welcome any unschoolers who<br/>
 need a place to stay. We live in Hamilton, ON which is about 40 minutes<br/>
west<br/>
 of Toronto (if the traffic is good &lt;g&gt;). Most people, if they&#39;ve heard<br/>
 anything at all about our city, haven&#39;t heard anything good, but it&#39;s<br/>
 actually a pretty fun place to hang out. Oh, and we&#39;re hosting the World<br/>
 Cycling Championships this fall (Oct)-any cycling fans want to come visit??<br/>
 (My dh just can&#39;t wait to set eyes on Lance Armstrong!!)<br/>
