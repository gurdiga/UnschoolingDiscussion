That&#39;s nice, Sandra and others. I have been reading along and see what you <br/>
are intending. Good stuff imo. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I use the phrase &quot;have to&quot; in the standard way it is used in <br/>
English I mean it in the if-then way -- really it&#39;s how real life works for me. <br/>
If I want to pay the bills, I &quot;have to&quot; go put money in the bank. I could <br/>
ignore the bills. I could buy money orders. I could pay some in cash. But the <br/>
shorthand way people talk is to say &quot;I have to go to the bank now.&quot; It&#39;s not that <br/>
deep. Unless somebody wants to think that my bill-paying habits are something <br/>
worth deep contemplation. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH sometimes using the phrase &quot;have to&quot; may be a bad habit that needs to be <br/>
corrected in our thinking -- to help expand the possibilities. Sometimes <br/>
using the phrase &quot;have to&quot; is an everyday expression about how the day needs to go <br/>
to get from point A to point B. Two usages.<br/>
<br/>
The frustration I sense in this thread is coming from a failure to <br/>
acknowledge both meanings and usages. <br/>
<br/>
Heck, there are probably more than two, but if Johnny wants to get to point <br/>
B, he may &quot;have to&quot; pass through point A. He may be choosing both. Now I &quot;have <br/>
to&quot; go warm up the coffee -- because I choose to have another cup. :)<br/>
<br/>
Nance (who spent most of yesterday afternoon explaining hsing to an Uncle who <br/>
was truly nice and supportive but astonished -- the word &quot;unschooling&quot; was <br/>
mentioned, but really in passing -- just the idea of hsing was big news! :) )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right!!<br/>
<br/>
But if people here said &quot;You&#39;re choosing to go to the bank,&quot; I would say <br/>
&quot;Yes, you&#39;re right.  I want to go now because Kirby  needs the van at 11:30 and I <br/>
want to have cash this afternoon&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I need a few things before tomorrow when we&#39;re having company.  I&#39;ll ask <br/>
Keith if he needs to go to Costco, and if he&#39;s going I&#39;ll probably just ask him to <br/>
get these things too.  I could go and buy them myself.  I could call and ask <br/>
someone who&#39;s coming to pick them up and bring them.  Lots of choices.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have to go to the store.  And we don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; have these things.  I could <br/>
change the food plan a little.  It&#39;s SO much more relaxed seeing the world as <br/>
a set of choices than as a narrow path of have tos.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago Kirby was bugging me.  Nearly every thing he said was <br/>
irritating me.  I know the instincts are kicking in that will enable him to <br/>
move out.  They&#39;re coming in me too, but I don&#39;t want to rush him away, so I try <br/>
to breathe and be logical and sweet.   What I said was that I thought he might <br/>
want to work on his pull-down menus, Terminator style.  I told him it seemed <br/>
sometimes he wasn&#39;t thinking before he spoke, but just saying the first thing <br/>
that came to mind without regard to whether it was the best thing he could <br/>
have said.  I reminded him that if he considers two or three things and chooses <br/>
the best one, he&#39;s making a choice.  And if his pulldown menu only had two <br/>
things that wasn&#39;t the best he could do.   So I made it funny, with the <br/>
&quot;Terminator menu&quot; visual idea, but I was serious.  He wasn&#39;t making choices, except in <br/>
choosing not to choose.   <br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes people use &quot;have to&quot; in that way.  &quot;I had no choice.&quot;<br/>

This is all I have been saying.  But for some reason when I say something<br/>
like &quot;because Kirby needs...&quot; I get responses that life is all choices and<br/>
does he really &quot;need&quot; it.<br/>

despite the words we use. But this list is different.<br/>
<br/>
So I think it&#39;s a lack of understanding that on this list that using words<br/>
to precisely represent what we mean is important. (In fact it&#39;s so important<br/>
that we made it one of our posting suggestions.) When people use words<br/>
casually, discussions go on and on (as it did) because people aren&#39;t all<br/>
getting the same picture of what the situation is like and they can all be<br/>
discussing something different.<br/>
