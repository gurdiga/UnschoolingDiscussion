<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313604993">I just want to say , that I am disgusted with the way that people have been<br/>
acting over this &quot;great idea&quot; post! Let it go!<br/>
What I got out of the post was that there is a lack of morals in this world.<br/>
We as a society,IMHO&lt;EG&gt;, have aloud too much negative to happen all in the<br/>
name of free speech. I don&#39;t neccesarily agree with teaching bible in<br/>
school. That shoud be the parents job (as I have been told that it was the<br/>
bible states anyway).I don&#39;t trust the PS system that much, if I did my<br/>
child would be in PS. Instead she is here with me. And no I am not HSing<br/>
because of religous reasons.<br/>
I agree that there is too much profanity, sex, and violence on tv (for<br/>
example) that does not need to be there. Yes I know that I can turn the tv<br/>
off. Do you agree with the abortion issue? I think abortion should be legal,<br/>
but I want to know if my young daughter is thinking of having one. That is<br/>
alot  to place on a young girl without turning to her parents for help. Oh<br/>
I&#39;m sure you all will have something to say about that. &quot;What  about the<br/>
girl who can&#39;t turn to her parents.&quot;  What about my right as a parent! Is a<br/>
girl under the age of 18 really able to make that kind of decision on her<br/>
own?!<br/>
I think the bottom line is we have all let it happen! In one way or another<br/>
and not because of prayer in school. Parents (and the community) are not<br/>
involved with their childrens lives enough to know what is going on. No, not<br/>
all but ALOT of parents. How many latch-key-kids have you known? I myself<br/>
was one growing up. Both parents had to work to make a living.  So who is<br/>
there to raise the kids? I feel I have pretty good parents, but I also feel<br/>
that I sorta raised myself.<br/>
I have sooo...many thoughts flooding my head right now! I think the bottom<br/>
line here is lack of morals!<br/>
And as far as the &quot;great Idea&quot; post, maybe it shouldn&#39;t  have been posted.<br/>
She has already said she wouldn&#39;t have posted if she had know everyone would<br/>
have wigged-out! Who are you all to say what should and shouldn&#39;t be posted.<br/>
I have had to endure many a posts that I felt didn&#39;t belong on this list,<br/>
mostly by the ones who are *itching so much!<br/>
<br/>
And that is just my 2 cents!&lt;EG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497563309">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i too have been out of this discussion.  i&#39;ve been trying to catch up on my<br/>
backlog of emails.  i had randomly chosen one email from this thread because it<br/>
was so long and the email i chose was packed with bible quotes in the context<br/>
of out and out condemnation of non-christians.   so i chose other threads to<br/>
catch up on,  but this makes me want to find out what all the fuss is about.<br/>
<br/>
without knowing the specifics i would say, on the issue of free speech, speak<br/>
your mind but try and respect the rights of others.  do not preach, you can<br/>
and should express you world view (that&#39;s how we grow) but if one&#39;s intent is<br/>
to hurt or belittle another, one should think twice and try to speak without<br/>
trashing others beliefs (the one email i read did not foster this respect and<br/>
had a strong &#39;holier than thou&#39; tone that&#39;s why i stopped reading this thread).<br/>

I guess I probably showed a little anger in my post  than I had intended and<br/>
that is not like me! It was frustrating to see people get ,IMO, angry about<br/>
the article. The woman who posted it had said she wished she never would&#39;ve<br/>
posted it. I took that to mean she never meant to upset people by the<br/>
article, but yet several more angry posts were posted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675603735">hi,<br/>
<br/>
after reading this thread i went and read through the entire &#39;great idea&#39;<br/>
thread and really learned a lot about people and their particular take on<br/>
life.  personally i enjoyed reading the whole thing and didn&#39;t feel it was too<br/>
long or overly aggressive just interesting and informative.  i love free speech<br/>
and yes people abuse this right but if someone is being mean spirited it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean you have to accept it.  the iroquois have a saying about having<br/>
skin 5 thumbs thick (something like that) it is important to not take people&#39;s<br/>
points of view too personal - even if it is a direct attack.  like my nephew<br/>
said to me when he was very little &#39;make like a duck&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
one of the cool thing about being human is having beliefs and expressing them.<br/>
so in my opinion keep on communicating, two way streets are more fun then one<br/>
so post something and then sit back and see if anyone wants to run with it.<br/>
you just can&#39;t get upset if it goes in a direction you didn&#39;t intend.  one<br/>
thing i&#39;ve been learning of late is that your will has a time and a place and<br/>
if you over use it the world starts to become very jagged.  so express yourself<br/>
then see where it goes.</div>

Thanks for the recipes! You also sparked my interest in the OAMC. I had<br/>
tried it before but lately haven&#39;t given thought to it. I intend on doing it<br/>
more often, starting with my next shopping trip! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
