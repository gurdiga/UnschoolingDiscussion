<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439143962">I just found in the paper a colt for $100. I would like to know if this is an <br/>
ok price, or if it may be a price siting a problem with the colt! I am truly <br/>
excited, and have wanted a horse (the family). We have the extra money, and I <br/>
can do the boarding... Please, someone help! NO one is answering the phone <br/>
over there, so I am finding out while I wait! HELP!!!<br/>
<br/>
