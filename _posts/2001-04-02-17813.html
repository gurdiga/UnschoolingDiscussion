<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421251820">That brought back memories.  When I went to work for the city where we use<br/>
to live I found out all kinds of things I wished I didn&#39;t know!  And became<br/>
a storehouse of useless information in the process!  Anyone want to know how<br/>
many fire engine reds there are &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, who processed the bid for a new fire engine and now knows all kinds<br/>
of weird things about fire engines.<br/>

&gt; No, you&#39;re okay---<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not IN the water, but in the spaces around the pipes, in the tunnels,<br/>
between<br/>
&gt; pipes.  Manholes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not all cities, but Albuquerque.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s gross, and I temped for the city once coordinating something related,<br/>
&gt; being a dispatcher for the full-time anti-cockroach brigade, which is why<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; know more than I wish I knew!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think in some big, old apartment buildings they just live in the<br/>
buildings.<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve always lived in detached houses and usually had cats.<br/>
