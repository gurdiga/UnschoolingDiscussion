 </span></blockquote>This caught my eye because I&#39;m a consultant for Usborne (though a fairly <br/>
inactive one.) Most of the newer books that Usborne is coming out with are <br/>
decidedly less cluttered than the older ones which have the more cluttered <br/>
style. The books still present smaller, bite-sized bits of info with a high <br/>
density of photos/illustrations but lately I&#39;ve noticed that the accompanying <br/>
illustrations/photos are much larger than before.  Just musing that the <br/>
company was getting feedback from folks who felt that the books were <br/>
cluttered....<br/>

That&#39;s my favorite thing!  The one on time travel to Vikings is WONDERFUL <br/>
because one page can last half an hour, there are so many little things.  <br/>
It&#39;s like a &quot;where&#39;s waldo&quot; where every piece of art and text was solid, <br/>
interesting information.<br/>
