&gt; There was a good article in Consumer Reports this month, August 2001, on<br/>
&gt; vaccinations with a great deal more balanced information to draw conclusions<br/>
&gt; from than websites devoted specifically to convincing people vaccines are<br/>
&gt; bad (or convincing people vaccines are good for that matter).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the article was balanced. I looked at it carefully as well as <br/>
the web sites mentioned and they were sponsored by people with a financial <br/>
interest in the public getting vaccinations. Those web sites were very <br/>
definitely trying to convince me that vaccinations were what I should do. <br/>
Anytime you bring money/profit into the equation, things get a bit skewed.  . <br/>
. that&#39;s just the way business is.  I think the book published by Mothering <br/>
Magazine and some of the articles I have read in there are much more <br/>
balanced. One of the articles I read in there (I guess about 2 years ago) had <br/>
a panel of people from various professions concerned with the issue as well <br/>
as parents (coming from both sides)<br/>
<br/>
And actually we don&#39;t really know how many people&#39;s lives have been saved <br/>
and/or destroyed on either side. . . it&#39;s a guess on  your part to say that <br/>
much more have been saved.  . . . we really don&#39;t have that information. We <br/>
do know that there are casualities on both sides of the issue and that is <br/>
truly unfortunate. I have no vested interest in people getting or not getting <br/>
their vaccinations. What I do feel I have an interest in  is in letting <br/>
people know they DO have control and that vaccinations ARE NOT mandatory, and <br/>
that there are exemptions. I trust that people can make the decision that is <br/>
best for their own family when they are been able to get information from all <br/>
sides of the issue.<br/>
