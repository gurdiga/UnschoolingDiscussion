<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110573171">&lt;&lt; &gt; I also can&#39;t figure out (yet) how proponents of unschooling can<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; expect that their children will eventually figure out the best ways<br/>
&gt; to live their lives, but you see adults all around you who obviously<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t adopted the best ways.<br/>
 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When people live their lives in an &quot;us vs. them&quot; mode, they feel confident <br/>
that their team is RIGHT and all other action is WRONG.<br/>
<br/>
When there are no shades of gray and when there are not explanations given <br/>
other than &quot;I told you so&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s the way we do it&quot; or &quot;God wants it that <br/>
way,&quot; then here&#39;s what happens:<br/>
<br/>
They learn to hate &quot;the other.&quot;<br/>
They take pride in not BEING &quot;the other.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then if and when they begin to question their own side (say, for example, <br/>
they were in a very strict Church of Christ situation where the elders told <br/>
them what to do in every way, what to wear, what to bring for the potluck <br/>
dinner), they feel their only choice is to stay and be hypocritical and <br/>
dishonest, or cut the cords and be &quot;other&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;hateful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So young men who were raised to think that dancing, drinking, carrousing were <br/>
the work of the devil and that their only options were to go to a Christian <br/>
college, marry a girl from the same denomination, be a virgin at marriage and <br/>
treat his children JUST as he was treated--that is success and there is no <br/>
other success--if he departs from that, he&#39;s likely to go CRAZY and drink <br/>
LOTS and use bad language, look at nasty magazines, go out with loose women, <br/>
get stupid tattoos, whatever all he considers would bug his parents most.<br/>
<br/>
In for a penny, in for a pound.  If he is not the one (good Christian on the <br/>
narrow road) he must be the other (wild party boy who doesn&#39;t care).<br/>
<br/>
Those raised with the God and Satan model, if you&#39;re not for us you&#39;re <br/>
against us, seem to assume that without the same reasons for &quot;being good,&quot; <br/>
that everyone else must be totally debauched Satan worshippers.  If you don&#39;t <br/>
believe in Hell, why wouldn&#39;t you shoot heroine and abuse strangers in <br/>
alleys?  If you don&#39;t believe in God, how and why would your children learn <br/>
ANY morals?<br/>
<br/>
Because their model allows for nothing between being an uptight teetotaller <br/>
and being prison material, they don&#39;t see anything between the two.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, down another tangent.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899016021">Perhaps,  if you will allow me, I can give an example of how Us vs Them can lead to sad consequences, from a personal experience. I admit the harm isn&#39;t great...this isn&#39;t loss of limb in the case I am about to go into.  But it caused pain.<br/>
<br/>
Esther started penpalling, to make more friends because of a dearth of homeschooling children in this area (there is one whom she adores, but they can&#39;t always be together.)  We found on a list a posting from a child who stated she had no friends.  My daughter has the biggest heart...as soon as I mentioned that she decided to write the child.<br/>
<br/>
We got a letter back, along with a cross (crusifix, not sure which.)  and an angel.  Esther wrote back, thanking her for the gift, explaining that we are Jewish and don&#39;t use crosses etc, telling her we passed it on, and again, thanking her for the thought.<br/>
<br/>
She also made a little bracelet, and sent her stickers and maybe one or two other paper items.  <br/>
<br/>
It has been about a month, and I think we have given up on hearing from her.<br/>
<br/>
What can we conclude? Oh, possibilities abound, but the most likely scenario is we are Jewish, and therefore, in this child&#39;s eyes, or at least the eyes of mom or dad, pariahs.  <br/>
<br/>
Luckily she does have other penpals (letters to penpals from this list went out last night!) And these friends will hopefully be true.  She is also going to meet one of her penpals Wednesday (at a pizza parlor... I&#39;m not totally naive!) So she is a bit sadder but wiser....<br/>
<br/>
Wish the other family could be wiser and happier....Esther is a true friend.<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter Maribeth (age 9) has made friends with two girls her age <br/>
from a nearby family.  They play both at our house and their house.  <br/>
One time at our house the TV was on and the announcer mentioned <br/>
Jesus.  One girl shut off the TV quickly (they are Jewish) and made <br/>
some comment like &quot;we don&#39;t believe that.&quot;  Play continued and has <br/>
continued for months since then.  <br/>
<br/>
They have a club with a fourth girl (from a non-religious family) and <br/>
they meet every Sunday afternoon.  That is our Sabbath and family <br/>
time but we try to be home so Maribeth can join the club meeting.  I <br/>
am sorry that your girl&#39;s penpal experience turned out differently.&#39;<br/>
