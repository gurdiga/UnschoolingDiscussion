<div id="ygrps-yiv-275001796">Hi,<br/>
I do house work the Fly Lady way (www.flylady.net), it has really improved <br/>
our household. I have three little ones 6,4, and 2 and they all have chores <br/>
they have to do. They have to keep their rooms clean, help with laundry.My <br/>
oldest has other chores she does: feed the animals, help set the table and <br/>
help clear it after every meal. She does not get allowance for doing her <br/>
bedroom and laundry, but she does get $0.25 a week for the rest of the <br/>
stuff.<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
Carrie<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lauren. I joined this list quite awhile ago but never<br/>
participated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 34, married, and have 4 kids. Our boys are almost 17, 10 and 21<br/>
months. Our daughter is 3 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
We are a very unstructured, unconventional family, but I&#39;m not sure<br/>
if this is actually working for us now. Our home is constantley<br/>
tettering on the edge of disaster. Household help is not given<br/>
unless I give a very specific request. Things that need to be done<br/>
are done at the last minute, and so on ...  I am curious about what<br/>
other unschooler&#39;s &#39;routines&#39; or scheduals are like.<br/>
<br/>
I am also interested in what other opinions are on how much<br/>
housework/chores should be expected of 17 & 10 year old boys who are<br/>
not spending 8 hours or more a day at a school.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Lauren<br/>
Austin, TX<br/>

<br/>
Woo Hoo Carrie - I&#39;m a FlyBaby, too :) and I&#39;m finally getting the house<br/>
under control and the kids eager to help.  I also apply some of FlyLady&#39;s<br/>
principals to our unschooling routine so nobody gets overwhelmed or anxious<br/>
feeling like we &quot;have to&quot; get certain things done...we know whatever we&#39;re<br/>
doing is what we&#39;re doing at the moment, and we&#39;re never behind so we don&#39;t<br/>
have to worry about trying to catch up.  My girls are much more focused on<br/>
the theme of the moment and don&#39;t worry about how long it takes or how long<br/>
they want to spend on any given topic, subject, or activity.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
I could be successfully guiding my kids and feel good about everything we<br/>
accomplish without having experienced FlyLady!<br/>
<br/>
I also encourage anyone interested in a guilt-free approach to household<br/>
chores to take a look!<br/>
