&lt;&lt; And I&#39;ve<br/>
 already gained back weight I had lost and am back to feeling sluggish and my<br/>
 skin problems are getting worse (acne & severe dry skin).  Diet does a lot<br/>
 for you, that is for sure!<br/>

&lt;&lt; And &quot;snacking&quot; is certainly not a problem. Remember that breastmilk is <br/>
more <br/>
 than just food - it&#39;s also comfort - & *fluid* - very important! If the <br/>
 baby is having frequent, short nursing sessions, she&#39;s getting lots of <br/>
 foremilk to assuage her thirst. I know that I spend most of the day taking <br/>
 small drinks from a bottle of water - this is the baby&#39;s equivalent.<br/>

many babies go to the breast often. The pattern I watched over this week <br/>
appalled me though. ALOT of wine consumed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654448674">Drink more clean water and REST. Pain makes REST<br/>
diffficult.<br/>
Did you have steroids at the time of the pain meds,<br/>
too? They can muck up you complexion (and other<br/>
things, too). And can take a LONG time to get your<br/>
system back in balance. <br/>
<br/>
Still, sleep is when your body repairs itself.<br/>

Sweet dreams.<br/>
