<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107431804">If one is lucky, a solitary fantasy can  totally transform one  <br/>
million realities.<br/>
~Maya Angelou~<br/>
<br/>
===================<br/>
<br/>
That came from a quote of the day list:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dailyquote@...">dailyquote@...</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me of John Holt.<br/>
John Holt, who was childless, thought of how much better it might be  <br/>
if more parents would keep their kids home.  Homeschooling was rare  <br/>
then, and sometimes sneaky and underground, but when Holt started  <br/>
talking about it, more and more people came forth to say they knew  <br/>
someone, or that they were homeschooling.  He started a newsletter to  <br/>
help them know the others existed, and it turned into Growing Without  <br/>
Schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Had there been the internet as we know it today, he would&#39;ve had a  <br/>
website and  maybe a message board.  Definitely an e-mail list!<br/>
<br/>
John Holt&#39;s fantasy transformed schools, still inspires radical  <br/>
teachers and reformers, and helps thousands and thousands of  <br/>
unschoolers find inspiration and confidence.<br/>
