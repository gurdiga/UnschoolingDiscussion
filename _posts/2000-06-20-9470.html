<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471105447">Hi all:<br/>
<br/>
My name is Dawn, hubbie Steve and 2 boys Zak 5 in August and Max nearly 9 <br/>
months old.  I seem to be somewhat conventional in a lot of things such as <br/>
getting married and having a father for my children.  I&#39;m very business <br/>
oriented and organized in most of my life.  Yet when it comes to my kids I&#39;m <br/>
very reluctant to shove them into an institution.  I just keep thinking &quot;what <br/>
have they done wrong to deserve us deserting them&quot;... I&#39;m struggling with the <br/>
idea of unschooling.  Not because I don&#39;t think it works, I do 100%.  I&#39;m <br/>
just confused about how I get comfortable with just doing whatever the next <br/>
thing is and do I have to keep entertaining them or will they ask for what <br/>
they need and if they don&#39;t will I be neglectful?  I guess those are the <br/>
biggest concerns.  I have my own business in the home which I can work around <br/>
the kids and hubbie is just as happy to quit working outside the home and <br/>
stay home with them if necessary and I be the major breadwinner.  So we have <br/>
the right mix.  I have Zak in a preschool at the moment, but the more he&#39;s <br/>
there (and this is a school where all they do is play), the more <br/>
uncomfortable I am with the idea of him going to something that&#39;s rigid and <br/>
decides what he learns and when.   <br/>
<br/>
Feedback from you all would be great on how to allay my fears.   <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to reading more on this list and learning a lot<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi and welcome! I have some of the same questions and fears as you do when it comes to unschooling my one-year-old daughter. Sorry I don&#39;t have any advice for you, but just wanted to welcome you and let you know you&#39;re not alone with your thoughts.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846716541">Welcome Dawn!<br/>
   Keep reading this list it is wonderful and banishes my doubts daily. I <br/>
have found ,in my experience that you do not have to entertain them <br/>
constantly, in fact it&#39;s probably better if you don&#39;t, they become more <br/>
creative when left to their own devices. I&#39;m always amazed by what my son <br/>
(age 6) comes up with on his own. Good luck.<br/>
                                          Trisha<br/>

Dawn --<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s in preschool?<br/>
<br/>
So you could try it for a while and see how it works.  Keep him home.  Try <br/>
doing a few things.  We are going fishing today, for example.<br/>
<br/>
See if everyone likes it.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are used to being out there in the corp world (even tho from home) <br/>
it may be an adjustment.  And your son may miss his little play buddies.  <br/>
Maybe you could see how he adjusts and how you adjust.<br/>
<br/>
Then, in a year or 2, when K or 1st grade would be appropriate you could <br/>
reassess.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re having a ball (as I suspect) you could continue on and explore the <br/>
world and guide when you think it&#39;s important and follow your son&#39;s interests <br/>
when they take off and, this is big to me, get him a library card!, and turn <br/>
your house into the same kind of mess I&#39;m living in with books stacked <br/>
everywhere (but we&#39;re happy).<br/>
<br/>
Or not.  You could decide hsing just is not for you.  You long for the more <br/>
traditional, structured approach and think he would do better in school.<br/>
<br/>
Since you seem to care so much about doing the right thing, I&#39;m sure you <br/>
will.  Whatever that turns out to be for you and yours.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck exploring.<br/>

Thanks for writing what you did.  It made me feel sick to think of him in a <br/>
traditional type of school or even being in school.  Since I wrote this last <br/>
night hubbie and I had a long talk way into the early hours and Zak is not <br/>
going back to pre-school.  Last night Zak told me a story about monsters and <br/>
I asked him if he&#39;d like to go to the library today to look for books on <br/>
monsters and on the computer.  He also suggested we could spend some time <br/>
drawing and coloring monsters and then we could drive around the neighborhood <br/>
(It&#39;s 110 here today in the desert) and look for them.  I&#39;m very open and <br/>
willing to do this an I guess this is what unschooling is all about.  The <br/>
baby (9months) is exploring walking now anyway and seems quite entertained by <br/>
his brother being here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll continue to be constantly concerned about both of them and &quot;the right <br/>
thing&quot; but that&#39;s my Virgo perfectionism coming out (LOL)... (P.S.  I&#39;m an <br/>
Astrologer)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
