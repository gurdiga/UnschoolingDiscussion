&lt;&lt; hey couldn&#39;t have used me for any show on negatives of extended nursing.<br/>
 My first two weaned themselves by age 2 this latest is still nursing to take<br/>
 naps or before going to bed at 2 3/4. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Was that 20/20 or 60 minutes or something?  Those shows are so inflammatory <br/>
sometimes.  I don&#39;t know how, but they manage to take something so common <br/>
sense and make it controversial.  I wish they would go away and stop inciting <br/>
suspicion against natural living.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, lots of extended nursing in our house too.  My son is 3 and almost 2 <br/>
months and still nurses to nap and sleep.  It has really cut down since last <br/>
year at this time.  He is a spirited/high need child, and the nursing has <br/>
really helped him to have a secure base. And helped me calm him down of <br/>
course!<br/>
