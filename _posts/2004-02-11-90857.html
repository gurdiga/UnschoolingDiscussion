<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654106494">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Which is probably how most kids who are controlled (or chronically out of<br/>
money) feel. Going to stores so often and knowing you *can&#39;t* buy something<br/>
must be incredibly frustrating.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Some kids just melt down and cry.  No wonder, with some of the things <br/>
I&#39;ve overheard parents say to them during my time at Toys R Us.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not about you.&quot;<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not YOUR birthday.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Put that back.  I don&#39;t care what it is.&quot;  (see above)<br/>
<br/>
Here there WAS money to be spent, but......<br/>
&quot;This is supposed to be fun.&quot;  (Looking at school supplies in September IN A <br/>
TOY STORE!!!!)<br/>
&quot;Hurry and pick something right now or you&#39;re not getting anything.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Why don&#39;t you get something that you can play by yourself so you don&#39;t have <br/>
to keep asking your father and me to play with you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then there was the baby that actually DID get a toy, but cried when the <br/>
mother took it away from him so I could scan it.  I quickly handed it back to <br/>
him, but the mother scooped it away and cooed to the baby, &quot;You can have it in <br/>
the car.&quot;  She explained to me, &quot;He has to learn.&quot;<br/>

My husband and I are not financially able to buy our kids new toys on a regular basis.  But they love to look at the toys when we go to Target and ask to go to Toys R Us just to look.  I use to love to go and look at toys in toy stores when I was young.  I don&#39;t think a parent is mean or &quot;controlling&quot; just because she won&#39;t buy her child a toy when asked.  I can&#39;t afford to buy many things for myself either.  It&#39;s just the reality of our financial situation.  Kids, just like adults, need to understand that they can&#39;t have or do everything.  Exploring a toy store is a nice alternative.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I was (and it seemed Kelly L. was saying too) NOT so inclined as a child or <br/>
an adult.  Seeing things I couldn&#39;t have wasn&#39;t much fun at all. <br/>
<br/>
We did play a game with the J.C. Penney&#39;s catalog, my cousin and my sister <br/>
and I, of turning the page, each picking the thing we&#39;d most like to have if it <br/>
were free, and going on to the next page.   And I used to carefully examine <br/>
their office supplies.  Hand-crank ditto machine, long-reach stapler, three-hole <br/>
punch.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to look at new cars I can&#39;t buy, or go places without money.  <br/>
<br/>
I have friends who LOVE to do both.<br/>

<br/>
And I don&#39;t necessarily see this as a result of whether you were deprived as <br/>
a child or not. Sandra was obviously deprived, and often. I could have <br/>
*anything* my little heart desired. <br/>
<br/>
I STILL hate window shopping. Always have. Always will. When I have money <br/>
though, I&#39;m a *happy* shopper! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
