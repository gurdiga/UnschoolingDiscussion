&lt;&lt; Whatever my kids choose I will siuport them 100%. Iif they become <br/>
conservative evangelicals or choose to follow Islam or join that guy who <br/>
dresses in orange or go to India  to find a guru. Whatever. I<br/>
 know I will not be disappointed cos there are so many different paths in the <br/>
universe and my children are individuals who will find their own.<br/>
 <br/>
 Right, someone else&#39;s turn.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think someone that has a very strong opinion about the afterlife and the <br/>
only way to get there is not going to be able to apply unschooling <br/>
philosophies to their religion/spirituality.<br/>
I think you hit the nail on the head though Shyrley, about letting your <br/>
children choose their own path and not trying to make them believe the same <br/>
as you.<br/>

My children so far, as well as dh, don&#39;t. Sierra likes to come along, but <br/>
it&#39;s all about the kids and getting to do art projects, not spirituality at <br/>
this point.<br/>
I tell them my beliefs on things, I display tolerance by explaining other <br/>
points of view and not teaching them one &quot;truth&quot;....well, that&#39;s not entirely <br/>
correct.<br/>
I tell them that the important truth is love and that people all have <br/>
different ways of finding their path to love (or not), but that love is the <br/>
important thing that binds us all together.<br/>
<br/>
When they get frustrated with narrow minded beliefs, I remind them why/how <br/>
people come to those conclusions and try to get them to at least look at it <br/>
from another viewpoint.<br/>
It&#39;s easy for me to do, having been raised very fundamentalist/legalistic.<br/>
<br/>
My only hope is that they are tolerant of many types of people, and know how <br/>
to love themselves and have peace with the Universe/God, whatever they <br/>
percieve that to be.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I go to Unity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Talk about being where you need to be, when you need to be there... I <br/>
stumbled into the Unity church by accident, looking for the Unitarian <br/>
services [same building complex] ~ my MIL was in town at the time and the <br/>
talk was on Ruth and Naomi ... it was incredible to hear their spin on bible <br/>
stories; I&#39;d never heard Yin/Yang applied openly :)... certainly  NOT your <br/>
typical Christian service :)  What are the chances, though, that Unity and UU <br/>
would be in the same building, both having potlucks on the same day???  If UU <br/>
was not available to me, I would definitely be in the Unity church ~ our <br/>
groups are so small, we often do things together, like peach marches, jam <br/>
sessions with our collective musicians, etc... <br/>
