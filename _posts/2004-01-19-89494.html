<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152238053"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My oldest was 6 when he discovered Dragon tales.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It really got to be &#39;too&#39; much fantasy play when EVERYTHING he did or said<br/>
was based on the show.  He was bringing the play into his &#39;real&#39; life.<br/>
<br/>
The show was banned for a short while. Now he can watch it and enjoy it<br/>
without it &#39;taking over&#39; his daily life.  It wasn&#39;t a good thing to watch if<br/>
he couldn&#39;t determine what was real and what was not.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is SOOOOOO incredibly sad! I mean, so sad that I can hardly sit here and <br/>
read this! Sad, sad, sad! To-my-core-deep-in-my-soul sad!<br/>
<br/>
I have two boys, 16-next-week and eight-next month. Both were &quot;Batman&quot;. And I <br/>
don&#39;t mean wore a Batman costume occasionally. I mean BATMAN! <br/>
<br/>
Duncan has eight or nine bat-costumes that he wore daily. He lives (still) in <br/>
the Batcave---ask anyone who has been to my house: the room is painted dark <br/>
blue with a glow-in-the-dark batsignal on one wall, the town of Gotham with <br/>
glow-in-the-dark windows on another, the Batmobile on a third, and &quot;POW!&quot;, <br/>
SOCK!&quot;, &quot;OOF!&quot; on other walls. Batman curtains and blanket with dozens of the <br/>
plastic Batmen and villians everywhere! (We also have some Spiderman stuff, but it&#39;s <br/>
minor!)<br/>
<br/>
Cameron, on the other hand, only had one or two costumes, but he WAS Batman. <br/>
You were ALWAYS to address him as Batman (or the Caped Crusader)! Unless, of <br/>
course, he was in &quot;street clothes&quot; when you were to address him as &quot;Mister <br/>
Wayne&quot; or &quot;Bruce&quot;! Seriously!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve given both boys complete freedom with fantasy play. They both really <br/>
got into these characters. Duncan&#39;s lasted YEARS longer than Cameron&#39;s. Cameron <br/>
was also a dinosaur (T-Rex, of course) for about a year. He also went to <br/>
school! :-(<br/>
<br/>
Both boys brought smiles to strangers&#39; faces when seen in public with their <br/>
costumes on. More than one person was TOTALLY entranced with Cameron when he <br/>
answered that his name was Bruce Wayne! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would be afraid that, if I were to have hindered this deep and intense <br/>
fantasy play, they might have taken it &quot;underground&quot; and been little batmen when <br/>
they knew I wasn&#39;t watching or made up stories/scenes in their minds that they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t share with me-----or WORSE! Given up on fantasy play all together! My <br/>
heart breaks.<br/>
<br/>
It IS real to them----just as your religion, which *I* think of fantasy, is <br/>
real to you.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon Tales would no more turn him into a dragon as Batman would turn my <br/>
boys into Batmen as Chritianity would turn me into Mother Teresa!<br/>
