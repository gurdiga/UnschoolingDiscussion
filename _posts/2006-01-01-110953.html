<div id="ygrps-yiv-747090846">&quot;&gt; Some of the jobs require a BA or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BS degree. Either you have one or you don&#39;t; that&#39;s all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the world&#39;s leading Paleontologists has no degree (other than <br/>
an honorary one bestowed on him AFTER he became well known).  There is <br/>
a gal that does some pretty big archeology work in the <br/>
world...Elizabeth something (I can look it up if anyone wants the <br/>
info.) who dropped out of high school, no college degree.<br/>
There was an engineer on one of these lists, spouse of a listmember <br/>
that had no degree.<br/>
<br/>
It happens more regularly than most colleges/universities would like <br/>
to admit!  <br/>
<br/>
I beat out 50 job applicants for a position where a &quot;degree is <br/>
preferred&quot;. 30 of the 50 had degrees, I did not and I was the only <br/>
person hired.<br/>
