&gt;When we as adults need to take action to protect our children, and bump up<br/>
&gt;against the control used against us for most of our lives......well... it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;a big hair deal and scary as all get out.  Once you *defy*, once you make<br/>
&gt;this your own decision, a hundred other things will come up.  Things you<br/>
&gt;need to change for the good of your family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly!  Except it wasn&#39;t that big of a step for me (actually there was NO<br/>
BIG STEP) as I have been defying my parental control my entire life.  It<br/>
made for a really rocky childhood, but it certainly made it easier to be an<br/>
adult with control of my own life later.<br/>

<br/>
Luckily for me (I think) my parents are well accustomed to me telling them<br/>
to $#%$# off and mind their own business, so they don&#39;t try to control my<br/>
life.  They know that in the end I will do what I feel is best and that if<br/>
they want to have any kind of relationship with me or their grandchildren<br/>
they need to step off their pedestals and take us as we are.<br/>
