<br/>
 I think exposing our children to our work can be ideal in many ways! It all depends. I&#39;ve worked full time for many years now and while I&#39;d really like to work less hours I can&#39;t see how school would improve our lives in any way. <br/>
<br/>
Working from home could be a great way to be available to them and make an income! Can you flex your hours? I work retail so the lack of flexibility is frustrating at times....fortunately my dh can work around my schedule most of the time. <br/>

Can your husband do the driving?  If you figure out how many hours  <br/>
you&#39;re at work there are still a LOT of hours left in the week for  <br/>
helping with resources.  Maybe you&#39;ll have a job at which they can e- <br/>
mail you or call you if they need something, too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291541967">Hi Anna,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear about your husband&#39;s job loss.  Hope he can find new employment quickly!<br/>
<br/>
We went through job loss this year too.  My husband has taken a lower paying evening job until his trade picks up again.  In the meantime, I found myself a job where I am able to bring our kids to work with me if they want to come along.  My oldest especially likes to come as he really likes working the photocopier for me.  I have my own office and have set up a cupboard with legos and games in case the kids want to play with something.  Jobs like this aren&#39;t that easy to find, but not impossible.  In fact just recently, I&#39;ve been offered another side job where our kids are welcome to hang out too.  Now I run a kids program for low-income kids on Friday nights....kind of like a drop-in centre.   This gives us lots of options for how we spend our days.  A lot of my job can be done on my home computer too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I found my main part-time job through Kijiji.  A local church had a grant and a program in mind but no one to run it.  <br/>
<br/>
Between my husband&#39;s willingness to find an evening shift and my willingness to find part-time and flexible day work, we have avoided many obstacles and made ends meet.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, since your children are older and already have jobs, maybe they would be interested in a family run business?  <br/>
<br/>
Mel <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862781594">Hi Anna: My daughters are 13 and 11, and I&#39;ve worked part-time for years - I<br/>
pay for all our &quot;kid&quot; activities (from violin lessons to chicken feed for<br/>
their chickens to gas for the car) and the girls and my own clothing. Right<br/>
now I&#39;m working about 20 hours a week - Thursday afternoon/night, Friday<br/>
morning/afternoon and once a month I work Saturday and Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found is that I need to be much more organized about planning<br/>
activities, food, etc. I spend time every morning before the kids get up<br/>
looking at our family calendar, going over what needs to happen that day and<br/>
what I need to do to be prepared. Lists are very helpful &lt;g&gt;. Best wishes,<br/>
Cara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081364933">&lt;&lt;&lt;I just feel as though my ability to be fully aware of their needs will be<br/>
hindered.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found this to be true, but again, I am working part time. I do try<br/>
to focus on them (if that&#39;s what they need) when I&#39;m home.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;They need me so much more lately for &quot;big&quot; stuff. Driving them to their<br/>
jobs, the long talks about the &quot;change,&quot; helping find the resources for<br/>
their interests and more. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband tries to work from home on the days I&#39;m at work. When that&#39;s<br/>
impossible I have a network of friends to fall back on. I&#39;ve put a lot of<br/>
energy into developing a community of like-minded<br/>
unschooling/homeschooling/ps friends and families, and that&#39;s proved<br/>
invaluable in many ways. We don&#39;t have any extended family to help us. The<br/>
longest the girls are at the house by themselves is 2-3 hours, and that&#39;s<br/>
only because my oldest is almost 14 years old.<br/>
<br/>
I schedule their activities that I have to drive them to on days that I am<br/>
home. My husband, when he&#39;s working from home, can&#39;t be sure he can drive<br/>
them places - sometimes he&#39;s on the phone or computer for extended periods<br/>
of time.<br/>
<br/>
Today he&#39;s taking the day off, so I don&#39;t have to make any arrangements<br/>
(yeah!). In the past week our poor old house has started to fall apart, so<br/>
he&#39;s going to be working on fixing our only shower, replacing a 20+ year old<br/>
toilet in the other bathroom, putting oakum on the steam radiator joints,<br/>
and fixing the kitchen light that died two days ago. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s going to<br/>
try to involve the girls, so I&#39;ll hear some funny stories when I get home<br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago we bought a large freezer. When I cook I make a double batch<br/>
and freeze one for the husband and girls when to eat when I&#39;m not home.<br/>
There&#39;s lots of online resources for this type of cooking or once-a-month<br/>
cooking (which I also do sometimes). This week I&#39;ve been buying half bushels<br/>
of b-grade apples (we live in an apple-growing area) and making and freezing<br/>
applesauce for this winter.<br/>
<br/>
Our home is near the center of a small town, and the girls can safely walk<br/>
to the library, which they enjoy. We used to have an elderly couple<br/>
immediately next door that adored the girls and would check on them for me.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m at work, I&#39;m usually at a computer and all of us have gmail<br/>
accounts. The girls and I send each other emails and chat through gmail. My<br/>
13yo has a cell phone and if they do something like walk to the library she<br/>
calls me when they leave the house and when they get there.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935871979">Thank you so much for the encouragement and ideas.  I haven&#39;t found extra work yet.  I have been working in my home as an in home daycare provider and I clean an elderly&#39;s home already anad my kids already have the choice to come or help or whatever.  I think I am suffering from panic attack problems because I am resisting change. I will have to either add more to my schedule or change and get a full time job if he doesn&#39;t find something.  My husband is very willing to help but he&#39;s hoping to find side odd jobs till his job market picks up too.  My kids are being awesome as well offering to help and work more as well.  We, as a family have united more since even yesterday. Let&#39;s just hope for flexible work opportunities that allow time for scheduled activities. Thank you again for allowing me a weak moment.<br/>

and despite the fact that I am more than capable of being employed...we have chosen for me to continue to be the stay at home/present parent. I just want to offer that if you want something bad enough you can make it happen.  Involving the girls (almost 11 and 9) in all the decision we immediately cut the fluff, home phone, extra cable, netflix, ect, we negotiated lower rates with the things we could not give up...We did have some saving that helped us get through the past few months.but we fought and won the right for unemployment benefits that have just recently kicked in along with health insurance for the girls and food assistance.  We let go of some of our unschooling gatherings travel plans but, I made a bigger effort to connect with others on a more local front and plan to free cycle/thrift for a web cam so my oldest can connect with faraway friends. I had change my food shopping practices way before this all happened to loosen up funds for more fun. Truth be told other than our plans to travel being put aside for awhile...Our lives have changed very little...We just do it on alot less $...we have no loss of fun, joy and adventure. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550837801">Hi - I have worked evenings for years now. My husband works days and then we have about 1 1/2 - 2 hours together to eat and then I go off to work. We do have weekends together. My son sleeps in late and is more on my schedule than husband&#39;s. I am lucky because my husband is a playful guy and he spends a lot of time with our son in the evening, they play video games, watch lots of movies, have lots of discussions, etc. I try to help by leaving at least one thing for them to have to do most every time I&#39;m gone. Even if it&#39;s just something small, like last night I reminded them of a TV special that was coming on that they wanted to see. Sometimes I rent something for them but sometimes they go get their own stuff to do as well. We have been unschooling for more than 5 years now. My son is 11 and dropped out of kindergarten.  <br/>
    Sometimes I get awful thoughts like &#39;wouldn&#39;t he be doing more school like stuff if I was at home full time&#39; or &#39;wouldn&#39;t he be smarter?&#39; Because I seem to work with him more on that (he turns to me for help with writing and spelling mostly but I&#39;m sure dh would help if asked.) But school like stuff is not what makes him the great person he is, and I think if he was in school he would have a totally different attitude, probably not as good as the one he has now. The skills schools value are emerging at their own pace but his experience is totally different. I think I would be being vain now to say that he would get a better education with just me, my dh is a great guy and I think the time my son spends with him is just as valuable as the time he spends with me. So what we&#39;re doing is working. I think it is a better choice than school for our son, but it probably isn&#39;t for everyone. I think if you put energy into making something work and the people involved are happy and also willing to do the work then you can still make a wonderful life even if it isn&#39;t a typical setup.
