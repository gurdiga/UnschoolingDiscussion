<div id="ygrps-yiv-414722938"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I would like to first remind anyone who&#39;s feeling personally jumped on by me 
<br>that I don&#39;t mean to do that--I was generalizing to all negativity on the 
<br>list. &nbsp;It&#39;s been a fairly dark and negative week on this list.
<br>
<br>I feel (perhaps wrongly) that the suggestion was made that I was some kind of 
<br>conservative non-hippie without gratitude who wasn&#39;t doing her part to make 
<br>the world a better place.
<br>
<br>I would like to suggest that that is quite far from the truth.
<br>
<br>The part of world-changing this list is designed to deal with is 
<br>homeschooling, and I have helped lots of families out of school (two, 
<br>locally, this week) and helped many more homeschooling families toward 
<br>unschooling. &nbsp;I&#39;ve helped worried unschoolers toward peace. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I also let my cats go outside. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>If I sign up for the cat-protection-at-all-costs mailing list, I&#39;ll expect to 
<br>be shamed for that. &nbsp;Guess what? &nbsp;I&#39;m on homeschooling lists. &nbsp;This is no 
<br>place to shame me for not changing the world for the better.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084080340">My dd was in 5th grade when I finally had enough crap from ps to pull her, ( <br/>
and ds 9yo and dd 6yo), out of ps. I dont immunize, so my youngest never <br/>
really went to much. But my oldest was sent to detention for laughing in <br/>
class, I was so outraged! If she had cried she would not have gotten into <br/>
trouble (I was told this) and the girl who made her laugh did not get <br/>
detention at all. I mean how incredibly stupid is that? you cant be happy <br/>
and laugh or youll get in trouble, but be sad and cry and you wont! Needless <br/>
to say she never went to detention and I think the entire school heard my <br/>
say on the matter! I have so many horror stories from thier school, and <br/>
sadly enough I did not know enough about it earlier to take them out. My <br/>
only regret! They are now happier, healthier and know more than thier years <br/>
in alot of areas. They do things with peace jam, and are now raising money <br/>
for the rainforest. Its one of those wish I knew then what know now type of <br/>
deals!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  How many of you have been homeschooled or unschooled yourself?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t called that back then, but I was homeschooled in the &#39;60&#39;s. <br/>
Mom and Dad didn&#39;t think school was a good place for kids, and they <br/>
kept theirs out of school as much as possible. Dad was a computer <br/>
systems analyst for the US Army, and helped develop much of what we <br/>
now know as the Internet. He designed one of the packeting systems <br/>
that helps email messages travel more easily. He taught me that <br/>
computers were already changing the world when I was barely big <br/>
enough to understand the concept. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Mom and Dad kept us out of school every chance they got, <br/>
which was pretty often since we travelled so much, and by the time I <br/>
was 12 I&#39;d pretty much quit going to school altogether. By the time <br/>
my youngest brother and sister (both now in their late 30&#39;s) came <br/>
along, my parents had discovered John Holt&#39;s writings, and they never <br/>
attended school at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   How many have older children (teenagers or older) that<br/>
&gt;were/are unschooled/homeschooled that are now in the workplace and <br/>
&gt;how are they<br/>
&gt;adjusting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that brother and sister I just mentioned both own their own <br/>
businesses. My youngest brother owns a very successful auto body shop <br/>
in Alaska, and my little sister attended the University of Alaska, <br/>
made the dean&#39;s list without ever having taken a test before, and is <br/>
now a writer.<br/>
<br/>
Our own kids, ages 15-27, have all been totally unschooled. The <br/>
oldest, John, is superintendent of a major construction company in <br/>
Alaska, building huge commercial buildings during the construction <br/>
season and staying home with his two little girls in the winter (his <br/>
wife is an RN). John&#39;s the one who makes changes to the blueprints as <br/>
a building goes up, resulting in what&#39;s called &quot;as-builts&quot; instead of <br/>
&quot;as-designed.&quot; He&#39;s also in charge of hiring, ordering materials, and <br/>
sometimes even straps on a toolbelt. He loves the work, which makes <br/>
him good at it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Second son Jim (married, also has two little girls) became an <br/>
industrial electrician (taught himself calculus when he figured out <br/>
it would make his job easier), and has travelled and worked all over <br/>
the US for several years now, making very good wages and gaining <br/>
experience with every job. Not bad for a kid who grew up 20 miles <br/>
from the nearest town and never cracked a textbook until he wanted to <br/>
learn about electricity and earn a living for his family. He just <br/>
recently moved back to this area when the first guy he worked for <br/>
made him a package offer he couldn&#39;t refuse. (It&#39;s nice to have two <br/>
of the grandkids close again! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
These boys both started out by taking the bottom-rung jobs - go-fers, <br/>
cleanup, whatever - and working their way up. Both were in <br/>
superintendent positions with three years, and both have personal <br/>
recommendations a mile long for their exceptional abilities, <br/>
attitudes, and general willingness to go the extra mile when needed <br/>
on a job. From talking with their respective bosses and coworkers <br/>
over the years, it seems those are rare qualities these days, and <br/>
highly valued in any job market.<br/>
<br/>
We have three younger kids who&#39;ve done similarly well in completely <br/>
different ways, but this is getting pretty long. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;unschooled/homeschooled child not<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our kids have always hung out with the public school crowd and the <br/>
local alternative school kids in our community, attending all the <br/>
local parties, working at the hippy co-op in town, helping coordinate <br/>
local music festivals and other events, volunteering and helping out <br/>
at community gatherings for various causes, etc. - and they&#39;ve seen <br/>
it all. They&#39;ve made their own determinations about what&#39;s right and <br/>
what&#39;s not, based in large part (I assume) on how we raised them and <br/>
the attitudes we modeled, and we&#39;re very happy with their decisions.<br/>

<div><font face="Pooh">Speaking of electricity...I don&#39;t know how many of you 
realize that I am deaf, but I have two non-functioning doorbell thingys that you 
plug in and attatch the doorbell to the outside with long wiring connected to 
it. The one that I could open had something like a computer chip thingy in it. 
Every time I tried to plug in both of them, it would short out aka make the 
light flash without the bell being pushed. I would love to be able to fix either 
one of these without going to an electrician or learn how to create a better one 
for myself with a plastic box, light bulb attatchment, phone wiring and one of 
those doorbell thingys you can pick up at any home dept store. Is there any 
books or advice I can glean from someone in order to create one that won&#39;t short 
out and will allow me to NOT depend on my daughter when someone is at the 
door??</font></div>

Kirby&#39;s 14, and has had a job for six months.  It&#39;s part time, but it&#39;s real, <br/>
and they offered it to him.<br/>

He also, starting next week, is teaching one session a week of the beginning <br/>

<br/>
Pretty good for 14, I think.  He&#39;s never been to school.<br/>
<br/>
It makes me think he&#39;ll have no trouble whatsoever finding fulltime <br/>
employment, as adults already ask him to help, and put him in positions of <br/>
responsibility.<br/>

  <div style="FONT:10pt arial;"><b>Subject:</b> [Unschooling-dotcom] Changing 
  the World</div>
  <div><br></div><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size="2">I would like to first 
  remind anyone who&#39;s feeling personally jumped on by me <br>that I don&#39;t mean 
  to do that--I was generalizing to all negativity on the <br>list. &nbsp;It&#39;s 
  been a fairly dark and negative week on this list. <br><br>I feel (perhaps 
  wrongly) that the suggestion was made that I was some kind of <br>conservative 
  non-hippie without gratitude who wasn&#39;t doing her part to make <br>the world a 
  better place. <br><br>I would like to suggest that that is quite far from the 
  truth. <br><br>The part of world-changing this list is designed to deal with 
  is <br>homeschooling, and I have helped lots of families out of school (two, 
  <br>locally, this week) and helped many more homeschooling families toward 
  <br>unschooling. &nbsp;I&#39;ve helped worried unschoolers toward peace. &nbsp; 
  <br><br>I also let my cats go outside. &nbsp; <br><br>If I sign up for the 
  cat-protection-at-all-costs mailing list, I&#39;ll expect to <br>be shamed for 
  that. &nbsp;Guess what? &nbsp;I&#39;m on homeschooling lists. &nbsp;This is no 
  <br>place to shame me for not changing the world for the better.
