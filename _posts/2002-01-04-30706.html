<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714860523">I just received another great issue of Home Education Magazine.  I wanted to<br/>
point out Helen Hegener&#39;s &quot;Publisher&#39;s Note&quot; article on page 6 to this list.<br/>
It touched my heart and spoke to the point we&#39;ve recently discussed about TV<br/>
and ambition and life goals, etc., though it didn&#39;t mention any of those<br/>
things specifically.  :-)  I also especially liked the article &quot;Confessions<br/>
of an Unsuccessful Homeschooler&quot; on page 39 as I think it addresses the<br/>
fears of many homeschoolers--particularly new-ish unschoolers.  And that&#39;s<br/>
where I stopped yesterday...will be reading the rest of the issue this<br/>
afternoon w/ tea.  Great stuff as usual from Home Education Magazine.<br/>
Thanks Helen and Mark and all the contributing writers!<br/>
