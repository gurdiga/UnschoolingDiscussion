My mom says to just leave her a few times, and she<br/>
will get the message.<br/>
<br/>
This seems mean and punitive to me, and yet could also<br/>
be seen as &quot;natural consequences&quot; of not being ready<br/>
when the rest of us are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My dear son, who doesn&#39;t set the alarm clock is the one who makes US late for <br/>
everything.  No matter the amount of warning, no matter is it&#39;s an event that <br/>
HE planned.  He takes FOREVER to get ready.  In his mind he times the trip by <br/>
the number of miles to go.  Never accounting for traffic, finding a place to <br/>
park, possibly needing gas, or any small delay.<br/>
<br/>
He will absolutely not come out the door one minute sooner than he thinks it <br/>
takes to get to wherever we are headed.  It infuriates the other children <br/>
sometimes, sometimes it doesn&#39;t really matter, many times it does.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what to do other than just leaving him either.  He barely has <br/>
any hair, doesn&#39;t wear make up, so I simply can&#39;t see what the hold up is.  Six <br/>
people can get ready, sharing one bath and a half, while he has one whole bath <br/>
to himself and STILL can&#39;t manage to get ready.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing others solutions to this.<br/>

Without trying the advice it&#39;s too soon to ask &quot;what if it doesn&#39;t work?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had kids get ready first and THEN play/eat.   It seems to work.  <br/>
Gradually they learn to time it out better.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re ready to go and someone is TRULY not ready, I just say &quot;We need to <br/>
GO.  Come on.  Bring your shoes and put them on in the car.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would not be above saying &#39;You&#39;re really pissing me off now, get in the <br/>
damned car,&quot; and waking that one up earlier the next time.<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, because we&#39;re patient with each other habitually, everyone here <br/>
has become really cooperative.  I&#39;m more likely than anyone to think of two <br/>
more things just as we&#39;re leaving (forgot to feed the cats; back door&#39;s not <br/>
locked; forgot to set the VCR to tape, or whatever), and the kids are patient <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possibly passive-aggressive behavior because she&#39;s frustrated with one <br/>
or more people in the family and wants to get at them?  If not, I&#39;d just say <br/>
to ask her earlier to get ready sooner.  &quot;Too soon.&quot;  And she might take the <br/>

I handle it?  I would probably talk with him about how it affects others.  I<br/>

<br/>
I had to leave my son a few times....Zach, the one who wasn&#39;t getting ready<br/>
for shooting....he would do absolutely nothing to get ready to go until I<br/>
told everyone to go get in the car.  Suddenly, he needed to find shoes, go<br/>
to the bathroom, find something to entertain him in the car.  I went through<br/>
the aforementioned steps and eventually, left him.  He was terribly mad.<br/>
But things improved greatly.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really having to deal with this problem in the same way, I can only<br/>
imagine what I might do. My oldest that was always putting things off was<br/>
always the last one out the door. I can&#39;t say she would make us late though.<br/>
I planned ahead and even though she was already *old enough* I would help<br/>
and remind her of the time if we needed to get somewhere at a certain time.<br/>
Party, shopping, etc. no, but organized events that had a start time, yes.<br/>
One thing she did on her own was set her clock 15 minutes ahead. Although<br/>
she knew it was fast, in the heat of getting ready quickly, she would just<br/>
look at the clock and actually forget it was fast and hurry herself along. I<br/>
can&#39;t say we ever got mad at her or even thought about leaving her behind.<br/>
(okay maybe my husband did &lt;BG&gt;) But I did talk to her about the importance<br/>
of the event for the other people. Also about how it made me feel to be late<br/>
or hurry. I&#39;m pretty much late myself. But when something is scheduled and<br/>
it&#39;s not fashionable to be late, I make sure we&#39;re there. So I guess Tara<br/>
knew I wouldn&#39;t be feeling bad unless it was important.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the last time I actually got her up or reminded her about<br/>
the time for anything. She&#39;s always on time for work and if she&#39;s late for<br/>
school, it&#39;s because she wants to be.<br/>
<br/>
My younger ones dawdled. I still have one that does. The others grew out of<br/>
it as I feel like she will too. I just start earlier with them and help<br/>
along the way with whatever I can. If I feel like I need to start an hour<br/>
earlier, I do. They are on a different time schedule. They just don&#39;t see<br/>
time the same way I do. I understand that and act accordingly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, because that would come across as a lesson you&#39;re trying to impose on<br/>
her and could have the opposite effect. It sets the two of you up as<br/>
adversaries. It&#39;s saying &quot;Here&#39;s where I want you to be (getting out of the<br/>
house in time) and this is what I&#39;m going to do to get you there (leave<br/>
without you).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Think of it in terms of setting personal boundaries about how you&#39;ll let<br/>
others treat you and your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe rethink what problem you&#39;re trying to solve. You&#39;re maybe thinking in<br/>
terms of how to get your daughter to stop making everyone wait. Don&#39;t. Don&#39;t<br/>
turn your daughter into the problem. Your *real* problems are: 1) getting to<br/>
appointments on time and 2) having everyone ready to go at approximately the<br/>
same time so no one has to wait more than is courteous.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s going to be hard to talk to her about it because when she hears<br/>
the problems stated like that, what she will probably internalize is that<br/>
the problem is how to make her get ready on time. But try to keep focused on<br/>
the real problems.<br/>
<br/>
Focus on the fact that it&#39;s okay for her to stay home but that if she *does*<br/>
want to go she needs to be aware that others have goals they&#39;re trying to<br/>
meet also: getting somewhere on time and not having to wait around to leave.<br/>
<br/>
With Kat, who&#39;s 12, I have found bringing her clothes to her works because<br/>
her not being ready is usually caused by asking her to interrupt something<br/>
interesting to do something that isn&#39;t as interesting. (When it&#39;s something<br/>
she wants to do, she usually has no problems focusing on getting ready.)<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter&#39;s probably too old for that and too interested in picking out<br/>
her own stuff, but it might be an idea for someone else. But you can discuss<br/>
what you and others can do to help her past the obstacles she has of getting<br/>
out of the house in time. When *her* goal is going with you -- that is on<br/>
those times when she&#39;d be upset if she was left behind -- focus on what you<br/>
can do to help her reach that goal.<br/>
<br/>
You guys can talk it out and come up with some plans. One way that might<br/>
help her is if you give her 3 alerts: a first alert that reminds her to<br/>
finish up what she&#39;s doing, a second alert that reminds her to stop what<br/>
she&#39;s doing and get ready and a 10 minute alert that means she should grab<br/>
any last minute things she needs and come down now because the bus is<br/>
departing in 10 minutes whether everyone is on board or not. It needs to be<br/>
presented as a method for her to help herself, not a way for you to control<br/>
her. The alerts are for *her* to accomplish her goal of getting out in time.<br/>
Your role isn&#39;t to make her do any of the getting ready. You&#39;re just the<br/>
timer giving her some clues to help her.<br/>

&gt; terms of how to get your daughter to stop making<br/>
&gt; everyone wait. Don&#39;t. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; turn your daughter into the problem. Your *real*<br/>
&gt; problems are: 1) getting to<br/>
&gt; appointments on time and 2) having everyone ready to<br/>
&gt; go at approximately the<br/>
&gt; same time so no one has to wait more than is<br/>
&gt; courteous.<br/>

brighter now.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the reason I have viewed it as her being the<br/>
problem is that the boys are so easy.  The 12yo could<br/>
care less if he is clean and neat, the 5yo still wants<br/>
me to pick out his clothes and dress him.<br/>
<br/>
Because she is 14, very independent and has her own<br/>
&quot;look&quot;, I can&#39;t turn up her speed by helping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think it&#39;s going to be hard to talk to her about<br/>
&gt; it because when she hears<br/>
&gt; the problems stated like that, what she will<br/>
&gt; probably internalize is that<br/>
&gt; the problem is how to make her get ready on time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, unfortunately the way we raised them when they<br/>
were younger was very conventional and punitive, so<br/>
now they automatically think that when there is a<br/>
conflict of interest it is because someone must have<br/>
been &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;disobedient&quot;.  :-(   It takes years for<br/>
those scars to heal, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But try to keep focused on<br/>
&gt; the real problems.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Focus on the fact that it&#39;s okay for her to stay<br/>
&gt; home but that if she *does*<br/>
&gt; want to go she needs to be aware that others have<br/>
&gt; goals they&#39;re trying to<br/>
&gt; meet also: getting somewhere on time and not having<br/>
&gt; to wait around to leave.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good way to approach it, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But you can discuss<br/>
&gt; what you and others can do to help her past the<br/>
&gt; obstacles she has of getting<br/>
&gt; out of the house in time. When *her* goal is going<br/>
&gt; with you -- that is on<br/>
&gt; those times when she&#39;d be upset if she was left<br/>
&gt; behind -- focus on what you<br/>
&gt; can do to help her reach that goal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is when I have the most trouble with my own<br/>
frutration, when it is something I *know* she wants to<br/>
do, such as go visit her friends, or go to her art<br/>
class, or go see a movie.  And I am ready on time, to<br/>
drive her to her desire, and she is late again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; You guys can talk it out and come up with some<br/>
&gt; plans. One way that might<br/>
&gt; help her is if you give her 3 alerts: <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I will suggest this to her.  I&#39;ll also ask her for her<br/>
own ideas as to how we could possibly help her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Joyce, Sandra, Mary, and everyone else who<br/>
offered such great ideas!  I&#39;ll let you know how it<br/>
works out.<br/>

to get places early, like as much as half an hour early. Lars hates <br/>
waiting, so he seems to have chosen to just take his time getting out the <br/>
door. He usually goes to games with dh because he&#39;s the coach, and I go <br/>
later after their warm up.<br/>
Now he seems to have made it a habit and does it with me as well. And I <br/>
*never* get anyplace early. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607613538">&lt;&lt;I mean, if we are just going shopping it doesn&#39;t<br/>
really matter if we leave 20 minutes later than I<br/>
thought, but if we are going to the movies or to<br/>
church or to a basketball game, then it matters to<br/>
those in the car, those we might be meeting, and we<br/>
miss part of whatever the event is.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure a single solution will be feasible for these different<br/>
situations. If lateness is defined as there being a specific hard time for<br/>
arrival that will inconvenience others, then the fluid shopping trip time<br/>
just seems way less urgent. <br/>
<br/>
When I was a teenager, I had a real problem with punctuality. It always<br/>
seemed that there was something that would delay me, including external<br/>
things like the bus being late, and internal stuff - just dawdling or<br/>
procrastinating. If you arrived at school after assembly had begun, you had<br/>
to report to the staff room and wait there. The teacher on duty was often my<br/>
science teacher, a genial woman, who was always interested in the<br/>
fantastically unlikely combination of circumstances that led to my late<br/>
arrivals. Finally the headmistress put me in charge of unlocking the hall<br/>
and supervising the chair arranging for the daily morning assembly -<br/>
requiring me to be there half an hour before the rest of the school. I<br/>
remember feeling astonished. I was never late for school again, including<br/>
after that year was up.<br/>
<br/>
However, lest it seem that my issue was magically cured, I continued to be<br/>
lousily unpunctual for social events with my friends - whose patience was<br/>
beyond saintly as I now look back. I don&#39;t know if it was me testing their<br/>
affection, or just striving to be in control of SOMETHING in my life or<br/>
what, but I just seemed incapable of getting to  anywhere on time - and I<br/>
never felt it was my fault. I was always apologetic, but I felt at the time<br/>
that being late was something that happened to me. Finally my friends - a<br/>
group of about 6 other girls - colluded to give me the start time of an<br/>
event an hour early - and by some miracle I was on time and had to wait an<br/>
hour! Having a sense of justice, I was in no way angry about it, but I did<br/>
take it as a call to change. I decided that I just had to face up to being<br/>
an unpunctual person, and therefore would have to work constantly and<br/>
forever to not be late for stuff. The only way was to plan to get there<br/>
earlier, so I would be on time.<br/>
<br/>
25 years later it is still a struggle to get to things like park days with a<br/>
fluid start time, early. And for events with a hard start time I plan in an<br/>
extra early leave-the-house time, and use various organizational tricks like<br/>
prepping the night before, and counting back from the leave time. For<br/>
example allow 15 minutes for putting together a food bag, x amount of time<br/>
for shower, tidy kitchen 10 mins etc, until I can schedule the time I have<br/>
to start getting ready (ie stop reading my e-mail). This is especially<br/>
crucial for catching planes. My husband is fanatically punctual, hates being<br/>
late, since lateness as practiced by some of his family members was a pose<br/>
for creating as much disturbance and attention getting as possible, not to<br/>
mention being entirely self centered. I hope Jayn takes after him instead of<br/>
me when she gets old enough to have a clearer grasp of the time of day.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will help with your teenager, except to note that in my<br/>
case, it took fairly drastic action on the part of other people who<br/>
evidently cared about me, for me to accept that I actually had a problem<br/>
that definitely was impacting my life and the life of others in a negative<br/>
way. I was the one who ended up creating the solutions for the problem - ie<br/>
strategies that worked for me to get punctual. <br/>

&lt;&lt; . My husband is fanatically punctual, hates being<br/>
late &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before we had children, Keith and I were separately or together always early. <br/>
  We went to tons of things involving other people, and we were often the <br/>
first to arrive and start setting up, or we had organized the thing in the first <br/>
place and were eager to be there so  others could meet in one place, learn of <br/>
plan-changes, or whatever.  We knew who would be there and who had cancelled <br/>
and who needed to be late.<br/>
<br/>
Then we had Kirby and it was harder to be early, but early was our priority <br/>
so I did it.<br/>
Then we had Marty and we tried to be there right on time, and others took <br/>
over the organizing.  We started being late.<br/>
Then we had Holly and I gave up on &quot;on time&quot; for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I could barely do it with two, but with three, none of my MANY tricks were <br/>
working well enough to get there on time.  So I started apologizing for being <br/>
late and getting used to the change in my status.   It was easier to change my <br/>
attitude than to go banshee on the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Once they were older we got back into getting there on time or early, because <br/>
the kids could help take things to the van and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all three punctual when it&#39;s up to them on their own, so I think it&#39;s <br/>
partly genetic, partly they&#39;ve seen it done.<br/>
<br/>
When I was young I was involved in being surrogate mom to a family whose <br/>
parents had died while two of the six were still young (11/8) and my younger <br/>
brother (4).   I took the kids to a movie in Santa Fe, half an hour from where we <br/>
lived.   The oldest, a girl, looked around the theater with a look of profound <br/>
awe, looking all around at the ceiling and the curtains and the speakers like <br/>
she&#39;d never seen a theater.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out she hadn&#39;t.  Hadn&#39;t seen one with the lights on.  She said &quot;I <br/>
didn&#39;t know they had the lights on before the movie started.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her mom had never managed to get Christmas gifts before Christmas, either.  <br/>
She used to  mail order things so close to time that they always, every year, <br/>
arrived after Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest brother of that family used to give me a ride from college to our <br/>
hometown when I was a teen and he was early 20&#39;s.   A two hour trip would take <br/>
from four to eight hours, because he had to stop here and there to deliver <br/>
something or pick something up, and we&#39;d get into a conversation or be shown <br/>
someone&#39;s new this or that, and some of the stops were way off the highway, and <br/>
they were always interesting journeys, but never quick or direct.  <br/>
<br/>
When he said he was coming over, it might be hours or (literally, honestly) a <br/>
day or two before he&#39;d show up.  He always made it, but not in the time scale <br/>
others considered &quot;now&quot; or &quot;soon.&quot;<br/>

Even if the headmistress had said, &quot;or else&quot;, you had a choice and in <br/>
this case her offer matched your interest. I&#39;ve always said that <br/>
procrastination has to do more with the em(power)ment/attention/control <br/>
we crave and perceive as lacking. In this case, you got the opportunity <br/>
to get the attention, control and empowerment you thought you lacked <br/>
during these assemblies.<br/>
<br/>
I think that these issues have little to do with the age --you being a <br/>
teenager at the time. I know that for me that&#39;s the case. We have <br/>
weekly meetings with homeschoolers that are marathonic. One lasts 3 <br/>
hours, the other 4. It is not important to our kids that we spend those <br/>
7 hours a week in these places. We don&#39;t get to these meetings late. We <br/>
get there at the time that is best for us.<br/>

&gt; Before we had children, Keith and I were separately or together always<br/>
 </span></blockquote>early.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   We went to tons of things involving other people, and we were often the<br/>
&gt; first to arrive and start setting up, or we had organized the thing in the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>first<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; place and were eager to be there so  others could meet in one place, learn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; plan-changes, or whatever.  We knew who would be there and who had<br/>
 </span></blockquote>cancelled<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and who needed to be late.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then we had Kirby and it was harder to be early, but early was our<br/>
 </span></blockquote>priority<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so I did it.<br/>
&gt; Then we had Marty and we tried to be there right on time, and others took<br/>
&gt; over the organizing.  We started being late.<br/>
&gt; Then we had Holly and I gave up on &quot;on time&quot; for a while.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could barely do it with two, but with three, none of my MANY tricks were<br/>
&gt; working well enough to get there on time.  So I started apologizing for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>being<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; late and getting used to the change in my status.   It was easier to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>change my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; attitude.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once they were older we got back into getting there on time or early,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>because<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the kids could help take things to the van and so forth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re all three punctual when it&#39;s up to them on their own, so I think<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; partly genetic, partly they&#39;ve seen it done.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I was young I was involved in being surrogate mom to a family whose<br/>
&gt; parents had died while two of the six were still young (11/8) and my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>younger<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; brother (4).   I took the kids to a movie in Santa Fe, half an hour from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>where we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lived.   The oldest, a girl, looked around the theater with a look of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>profound<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; awe, looking all around at the ceiling and the curtains and the speakers<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she&#39;d never seen a theater.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Turns out she hadn&#39;t.  Hadn&#39;t seen one with the lights on.  She said &quot;I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know they had the lights on before the movie started.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her mom had never managed to get Christmas gifts before Christmas, either.<br/>
&gt; She used to  mail order things so close to time that they always, every<br/>
 </span></blockquote>year,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; arrived after Christmas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The oldest brother of that family used to give me a ride from college to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hometown when I was a teen and he was early 20&#39;s.   A two hour trip would<br/>
 </span></blockquote>take<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from four to eight hours, because he had to stop here and there to deliver<br/>
&gt; something or pick something up, and we&#39;d get into a conversation or be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>shown<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; someone&#39;s new this or that, and some of the stops were way off the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>highway, and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they were always interesting journeys, but never quick or direct.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When he said he was coming over, it might be hours or (literally,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>honestly) a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; day or two before he&#39;d show up.  He always made it, but not in the time<br/>
 </span></blockquote>scale<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; others considered &quot;now&quot; or &quot;soon.&quot;<br/>
