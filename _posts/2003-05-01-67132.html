<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097500079">I&#39;m in the same Pagan boat as you, so I&#39;ll take a stab from that<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a matter of trust.  You have to &quot;show&quot; them your faith and<br/>
explain it and give them chances to experience it with you.  If you do that<br/>
from an honest place, with no coercion, then they will at the very least<br/>
respect your religion.<br/>
<br/>
(Now this is where it gets tricky.) There are Christians who follow what I<br/>
think of as a &quot;coersive&quot; version of Christianity.  You must believe exactly<br/>
this or you will go to hell.  End of discussion.  We&#39;ve all talked to them.<br/>
I believe (in my opinion, just my thoughts, any more disclaimers<br/>
necessary???) that is an interpretation that is built into the religion.  If<br/>
you have that interpretation, then no, I don&#39;t think you can unschool it.<br/>
<br/>
But, if you can look around and see that others are happy in their faith, or<br/>
lack of it, and say, &quot;I think they are wrong but it&#39;s their choice,&quot; then<br/>
you can unschool it.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, if my son came home and said he had decided he was Christian, in my<br/>
heart of hearts, that would be my response.  &quot;I think you are wrong, but I<br/>
love you so...&quot;  Not sure how I&#39;d present it to him, but that&#39;s how I&#39;d<br/>
feel.  I know it&#39;s how his grandma feels about our Paganism.<br/>
<br/>
But again, it&#39;s a matter of trust.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t from my personal experience but I think you can unschool it if you <br/>
are willing to let your children make the decision for themselves. Them <br/>
knowing what you perceive the consequences to be.  Let them decide even if <br/>
you think they will go to Hell if they choose a different path.  Would be a <br/>
hard road to take as a parent.  Thinking that your children will end up in <br/>
Hell.  But I think it is possible.<br/>

Choice. I am a pretty fundamental Christian, and I am that way <br/>
because of the free will God gave me. I chose it. I hope my kids <br/>
choose it, and they see its importance in my life, but I don&#39;t push <br/>
it on them. I think pushing it would drive them further away. It&#39;s <br/>
all about free will and choice to me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655385951">Having been discussing with someone how unschooling affects all aspects of one&#39;s life, not just the learning journey, we were wondering how religion can fit into this.<br/>
Can you be deeply religious and yet &#39;unschool&#39;?<br/>
The majority of religious people want their child to follow their religion. Can you truly let your child make a choice if you believe that the wrong choice will lead to hellfire or whatever the penalty<br/>
in your religion is?<br/>
<br/>
Now I don&#39;t want to start a heated debate and the question is for all religions.<br/>
So I&#39;ll answer first ;-)<br/>
I am a pagan and have certain beliefs that tie into the environment and how to live on the earth. I also have beliefs about spirituality.<br/>
As of yet my kids do not share my paganism deep down. They can name deities, know how a circle goes, celebrate the 8 festivals. They are free to choose not to come with me and they are free to explore<br/>
other faiths. If they choose the pagan path when older that is up to them. I believe spirituality is a personal thing and while we might wave incense around in company or whatever, what goes on<br/>
internally is between a person and the universe.<br/>
Whatever my kids choose I will siuport them 100%. Iif they become conservative evangelicals or choose to follow Islam or join that guy who dresses in orange or go to India  to find a guru. Whatever. I<br/>
know I will not be disappointed cos there are so many different paths in the universe and my children are individuals who will find their own.<br/>
<br/>
Right, someone else&#39;s turn....<br/>

I don&#39;t think so.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s because you believe there are many different paths.<br/>
<br/>
If a family believe there is ONE path to avoid hellfire (your own stated <br/>
example up above) they cannot risk anyone getting off that one (narrow) path, <br/>
or they risk their own souls and their own relationship with God.<br/>
<br/>
There is a kind of unschooling, though, that can be done, and that would be <br/>
living a rich life within the prescribed bounds the parents have set.  If the <br/>
kids can read anything or watch or do anything which the parents don&#39;t <br/>
consider to be against their religion, that could be unschooling.  They would <br/>
unschool and still not really hobnob with heathens or evil elements.  They <br/>
might unschool creationist science books and resources only.   But I don&#39;t <br/>
think a strictly religious family could really cut loose and trust children <br/>
to check out the whole earth freely.  Life&#39;s too short and if the music ends <br/>
while they&#39;re dressed in orange in India, hellfire is inevitable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2677532">I hate these ding dang labels :)  I&#39;m a spiritual explorer &lt;bg&gt; I love taking <br/>
truths from everywhere and *diana-cizing* it all together.  Which is what <br/>
brought me to the UU church :::happy dance::: I&#39;ve never been so comfortable <br/>
in my life ~ I feel like I&#39;m de-churching and I&#39;m certainly un-churching the <br/>
kids.  They&#39;re free to learn, explore, question, reject, embrace... just like <br/>
the rest of their life.  Our congregation is very, very small [we&#39;re in a <br/>
bible thumpin town of only 60,000] and there are no other homeschoolers but <br/>
we&#39;re well received as is everyone else who comes... amazing!  <br/>
<br/>
So, no, I don&#39;t think you can unschool a prescribed notion/religion if your <br/>
way is the *only* way.  <br/>
