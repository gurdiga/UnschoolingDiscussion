<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054010871">While we are talking about finances and stuff...  I&#39;d like to recommend a book that has helped us:  &quot;Financial Planning for Dummies&quot; (don&#39;t laugh.. it is a good book, really!).  I am also currently reading &quot;Learn to Earn&quot; by Peter Lynch.  It is a very easy read... written more for the junior high/high school level to explain the basics behind investing in stocks, funds, etc.  I will probably make sure my daughter reads it when she is a bit older.  I am finding out how crucial it is that our kids&#39; education include personal finance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Went looking for the game.... WOWZA... not an inexpensive game!!!  The kids&#39; version was $59.95 at Elijah Co.... he was selling it at his website for $39.95.  But the one for ages 10+ was $195 at both places.  Youch.  Right now we are just playing &quot;Payday&quot; and we expose our kids to most of our financial discussions and decisions.<br/>
