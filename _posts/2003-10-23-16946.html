How long have you been unschooling Holly, to give this kind of advice?<br/>
<br/>
I must say, some of the posts lately are rather shocking, considering the list they&#39;re at. One would think folks had come to this site without even knowing what radical unschooling entails! Which is fine, we all learned in our own way/time...but I guess I expect the advice to be in line with the philosophies we all hold dear.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about respect and trust and gentleness, not just the freedom to learn what one chooses. Getting to the root of these issues is far more important than &quot;sticking to your guns&quot;.<br/>
I believe in finding solutions that benefit the entire family, not pitting yourself as an adversary against your child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219981700">We used to live on a very busy street in Houston.  Now we live out in a<br/>
semi-rural area.  I spent years working with pedophiles (rehab) and got to<br/>
where I saw a perpetrator behind every tree.  I have 5 kids and the only<br/>
time they are asked to stay in the house is if I am in the shower (because<br/>
if there was a problem I wouldn&#39;t hear it).  We keep windows open a lot.  If<br/>
I can&#39;t be outside with the kids, I make sure that every so often I look out<br/>
the window and make sure where they are.  If I don&#39;t see them, I make a tour<br/>
around the house until I see everybody.<br/>
<br/>
I learned this from my grandmother.  I always thought we had complete<br/>
freedom at her house, but I learned as an adult that those trips to check<br/>
the water in the garden, etc. were her way of making sure we were safe<br/>
without us feeling stifled.<br/>
<br/>
I would say your son is telling you very loudly that he feels stifled.  It<br/>
is terrifying to let your children out from under your protection at all<br/>
times.  How in the world would you live with yourself if something were to<br/>
happen to them?  But I do believe that it is better for a child to test the<br/>
waters of independence with our full knowledge and consent rather than to<br/>
sneak it behind our backs.  If he is having to sneak and something goes<br/>
wrong, you wouldn&#39;t even know where to look for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841895854">I agree that kids need to learn independence.  I definitely give my <br/>
children that.  But I do feel that as their parent I need to give them <br/>
protection as well.  I don&#39;t see a pedophile behind every tree, but I do <br/>
see the one that lives only 5 blocks away and walks the streets of this <br/>
neighborhood, which is filled with children.  I have seen him speaking <br/>
to the kids across the street when their mother and father are nowhere <br/>
to be found.  I worry about that, but have been told to mind my own <br/>
business by those parents, even after I rescued their 2 year old <br/>
daughter from a hit and run accident and gave shelter and protection to <br/>
their 7 year old son who was beaten to bloody by two older bullies.  If <br/>
we lived in a more rural area, I would allow my children much more <br/>
freedom outside. But we live where there are multiple dangers that are a <br/>
reality, not just a potentiality.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother taught me something quite wise once as well.  &quot;Never <br/>
leave your children where you wouldn&#39;t leave a million dollars in cash.&quot; <br/>
 I like to live that  adage.  If that makes me an excessively sheltering <br/>
parent, I can live with that and I think my boys can as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We just hit this stage, and it took me several months to get reasonably<br/>
comfortable with it.  Expect your comfort level to take time.  Part of me<br/>
wants my son where I can see him all the time.  But he&#39;s 7, not 3.  And<br/>
having him trying out school right now has made it worse, because it feels<br/>
like he&#39;s NEVER around for me to watch.<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered investing in a cheap set of walkie talkies?  The way our<br/>
buildings are set up in this complex, I can&#39;t see him if he&#39;s not right on<br/>
the playground outside.  But what seven year old wants to be confined to a<br/>
little playground, especially with a bike?  His limits are still probably<br/>
only a couple blocks in any direction, but he feels like he has freedom, and<br/>
I know that if he wipes out on his bike (again), he can call me and I can be<br/>
there fast.<br/>
<br/>
And all his friends want walkie talkies now, too...<br/>

We live in East Providence, RI....maybe you live in a nicer place.<br/>
What would your child do if someone tried to grab her? Would she know how to get away?<br/>
Does she know what to do if she were grabbed and she ended up in a car?<br/>
Do you really trust all those people you don&#39;t know?<br/>
Brianna & I are two females - alone <br/>
we work in the public with the public - too many people can &#39;see&#39; us and follow us....<br/>
<br/>
Brianna goes a few places on her own - but she does have a cell phone.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m over protective...and I&#39;m okay w/ that.<br/>
<br/>
Brianna will be able to travel on her own when she can defend herself. Look at the statistics.<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth Smart was one of the lucky ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600213230">We were around 8 - 9 ..so this was maybe - 1957-1958?  He chased us with his car ....we ran through the quad of Brown university - thinking he wouldn&#39;t chase us - he was on the other side when we got there!<br/>
Jeannette & I were truly horrified and so very scared. We ended up eluding him by running to a Sisters of Mercy convent.<br/>
The book I picked up was, I think called <br/>
&quot;Street Smarts&quot;<br/>
Some of it is because I have figured out how to get out of situations. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been brutally raped once and not so brutally raped once and date raped at least twice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been molested (age 5 - female babysitter)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been grabbed, fondled, hovered over and around...how about when someone invades your space - gets way too close? Trying to intimidate you? Last guy that did that to me ended up on his knees...and when he was on his knees - and because he touched my shoulder....I kicked him in the face when he was down there.<br/>
I see him every so often...he doesn&#39;t bother me any more.<br/>
<br/>
The sad part is - that I&#39;m almost the norm.  So many kids are fondles, grabbed, felt up. verbally accosted....I&#39;d rather be safe than sorry.<br/>
<br/>
When Brianna was 6, I left her with our first web designer. We had known him for almost two years. I knew next to nothing about web sites. I had met his mom and I knew some of the same folks as both he and his mom.<br/>
He was working on the computer/web site in our kitchen. Brianna was working on a puzzle.<br/>
I left them for less than 20 minutes.<br/>
He committed 2nd degree molestation.<br/>
Now let me tell you, I&#39;ve been around.<br/>
I&#39;ve met many, many people.<br/>
I can usually &#39;read&#39; people. I didn&#39;t &#39;read&#39; this in Kevin Soucy (he did serve time for it - I can say his name)<br/>
<br/>
Gotta&#39; run....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s 10, she&#39;ll be 11 in January. We live on a farm in the middle of<br/>
nowhere, where of course she&#39;s free to go anywhere, but we spent a lot of<br/>
time in Davis (college town, maybe 70K) and Woodland (more ag, maybe<br/>
50K). When we lived in the bay area (Alameda) and she was 7 or 8, she&#39;d<br/>
walk a block to the coffee shop by herself. In Tucson... well, when it&#39;s<br/>
110 degrees, walking anywhere isn&#39;t something you really want to do, at<br/>
least 8 months out of the year, but she&#39;d mall-wander with a friend.<br/>
<br/>
I know things can happen. Midsi Sanchez lived in Vallejo, maybe  30 miles<br/>
from Davis (she was the 8 yr old taken on her way home from school who<br/>
escaped when her abductor went to get a black garbage bag by taking his<br/>
keys, unlocking her chain, and flagging down a truck). OTOH, other girls<br/>
are taken from their bedrooms at night. There are 150 stranger abductions<br/>
of children every year in the US (according to the Elizabeth Smart show<br/>
we&#39;re watching right now) and that&#39;s really, really rare. <br/>

I know there are no guarantees in life, and everyone has to weigh the<br/>

and underestimate others (like sexual assault by a family member).<br/>

&gt; &gt; How old is your daughter?  What is the size of the town in which you<br/>
&gt; &gt; live?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s 10, she&#39;ll be 11 in January. We live on a farm in the middle of<br/>
&gt; nowhere, where of course she&#39;s free to go anywhere, but we spent a lot of<br/>
&gt; time in Davis (college town, maybe 70K) and Woodland (more ag, maybe<br/>
&gt; 50K). When we lived in the bay area (Alameda) and she was 7 or 8, she&#39;d<br/>
&gt; walk a block to the coffee shop by herself. In Tucson... well, when it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; 110 degrees, walking anywhere isn&#39;t something you really want to do, at<br/>
&gt; least 8 months out of the year, but she&#39;d mall-wander with a friend.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d let Lexie, at 8, go down to the corner store, but I do <br/>
let her go over to the club house or across the complex by herself.  She <br/>
also walks people out to their car, at night, alone, or with Janene, and <br/>
they are fine.  I have begun to think I need to let her handle more <br/>
things alone, llike going into a store and buying a few items, with me <br/>
waiting.  We&#39;ve sorta done that a few times, but it&#39;s been small stores <br/>
and I&#39;ve been wary a lot.  Lexie is very self sufficient and is like <br/>
Rain, not a victim at all. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I know things can happen. Midsi Sanchez lived in Vallejo, maybe  30 miles<br/>
&gt; from Davis (she was the 8 yr old taken on her way home from school who<br/>
&gt; escaped when her abductor went to get a black garbage bag by taking his<br/>
&gt; keys, unlocking her chain, and flagging down a truck). OTOH, other girls<br/>
&gt; are taken from their bedrooms at night. There are 150 stranger abductions<br/>
&gt; of children every year in the US (according to the Elizabeth Smart show<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re watching right now) and that&#39;s really, really rare. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am very aware of that.  Stranger stuff is almost nothing, people you <br/>
know stuff is all the time.  We talk about this on a regular basis. <br/>
<br/>
I want to raise strong girls who respect themselves, are strong enough <br/>
to say no under difficult situations, can handle themselves in many <br/>
different situations, and know how to protect themselves. <br/>
<br/>
We have a condo and there is a courtyard area with grass and trees in <br/>
front of the condo, surrounded by other condos, no access by cars.  The <br/>
girls play there all the time, no adult out front. I often sit at my <br/>
computer and watch/listen to them, and they call up to me &quot;Oh Wise <br/>
Talking Window, we&#39;re thirsty/hungry can you bring us something to <br/>
eat.&quot;  &quot;Oh Wise Talking Window, when will dinner be ready.&quot;  But <br/>
sometimes I&#39;m in the bath or in the backyard, and that&#39;s OK cause they <br/>
know their boundries.  Up until last year I wouldn&#39;t let Janene go out <br/>
alone, she had to have Lexie with her.  Now Janene can go out alone, as <br/>
can, of course, Lexie.  Janene and Lexie also can go from our garage, <br/>
through the alleyway, to the courtyard, with bikes or ride toys or <br/>
whatever, alone.  They do have boundries, but Lexie&#39;s are larger than <br/>
Janene&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
At the park where we go on Wed, they often get out of site.  I don&#39;t <br/>
mind cause they are usually with a group of kids or at least a buddy.  <br/>
If they don&#39;t reappear in 10-15 minutes I find them visually.  Janene I <br/>
watch more closely but she sticks closer. <br/>
<br/>
Kids need freedom to grow and learn.  I used to know kids who were never <br/>
out of their parent&#39;s eyesight until they were 10-12 years old, and then <br/>
wow, did those kids misbehave!  They had never made their own decision, <br/>
had any responsibility or dealt with anything strange or upsetting so <br/>
they had no basis for making good decisions. <br/>

Brianna made me a fabulously wonderful ice cream cake w/ unsalted nuts; Hagan Daz coffee ice cream w/ a chocolate sauce ( she also made the sauce.)<br/>
She also whipped up a great batch of toll house cookies.<br/>

On Monday, she and I are celebrating &quot;alone&quot; - hiking, movie and lunch. She planned everything - including today&#39;s events...she coordinated w/ my friends. I really had no idea that she even had all these ingredients!...<br/>

  &gt;Brianna will be able to travel on her own when she can defend herself. <br/>
  &gt;Look at the statistics.<br/>
<br/>
  Wow! I&#39;m 54 and don&#39;t think I could defend myself. But I learned many years <br/>
  ago not to look like a victim. Predators know what a victim looks like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014858958">Dawn, it sounds to me like this mom really does need help, but she&#39;s looking<br/>
at you like you are harmful, not helpful.  It sounds like she may see you as<br/>
judging her.  Like your life is easy and perfect and you are looking down on<br/>
her because her&#39;s isn&#39;t.  Of course, this is only from what I read here.  I<br/>
think she needs to see that you are trying to help, not judge.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if you are really serious about helping these kids, you have to<br/>
help the mom become a better mom first.  You have to dig down and find out<br/>
what the reason for her neglect is, then try to offer her solutions.  This<br/>
is not an easy task.<br/>
<br/>
You need to know why she doesn&#39;t watch her kids.  Is she vegging during the<br/>
day because she works a night job or stays up all night partying or fighting<br/>
with an abusive man?  Is she sitting around her house watching Jerry<br/>
Springer because she doesn&#39;t know how to interact with the kids?  Is she<br/>
really watching Jerry Springer or is she just too busy doing things that<br/>
have somehow become too important to keep her eye on the kids (like<br/>
housework)?  Maybe she just can&#39;t handle the stress of two little ones.  Or,<br/>
maybe she never had any good parenting role models and just doesn&#39;t know<br/>
what to do.  It&#39;s hard to know from down the street what is really going on.<br/>
<br/>
Are you willing to put yourself out there for this family?  Once you&#39;ve made<br/>
contact with a needy person it&#39;s hard for them to let go.  I don&#39;t envy your<br/>
position right now.<br/>
<br/>
Crystal<br/>
<br/>
**********************************<br/>
I agree.  But what do you do when the parents of the kids you are trying to<br/>
help don&#39;t want you to help!  Certainly I would call the police and keep<br/>
watch over the kids if some danger was imminent, but their unsupervised<br/>
neighborhood wanderings (and I&#39;m mostly talking about the littlest ones, now<br/>
just 3 and 18 months) continue on a daily basis.  I called the police this<br/>
past summer when the same child who had been hit by a car was sitting in the<br/>
middle of the street.  (I had taken her home when she was doing this before,<br/>
and the mother screamed at me to leave her kids and her alone.) The police<br/>
came, took her home and supposedly spoke to the parents, but nothing has<br/>
changed.  I know it isn&#39;t really my business, but I absolutely cannot help<br/>
but worry for the kids who<br/>
were unfortunately enough to be born to parents who aren&#39;t willing to get up<br/>
off the couch, turn off Jerry Springer and go out and deal with their kids.</div>

The above experiences are very telling...that would cause you to see the world with no trust, understandable. But safety is merely an illusion at best. Just because you&#39;re trying to be protective is no guarantee of anything. I&#39;m sure you know that. <br/>
Raising children that are aware, not fearful is important to me. <br/>
I&#39;ve read (from a psychologist) that women that get raped more than once are typically carrying abuse of some kind with them. That fear and the way they carry themselves screams &quot;victim&quot; at rapists. Until you heal from the abuse, those types of situations are likely to continue.<br/>
It&#39;s horrid that rapists will hone in on vulnerable people, but that&#39;s what happens.<br/>
I had a friend raped multiple times over the very same issue. It wasn&#39;t until she got help and realized how she was waving a &quot;victim&quot; sign before it stopped happening and she was able to protect herself.<br/>
She became quite deadly in the martial arts also...which was very cool.<br/>
I don&#39;t think acting fearfully overprotective is a helpful tool in keeping our children safe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577584214">I don&#39;t think I&#39;m fearfully over-protective - we do travel off to a new place almost every weekend where we set up a 10&#39; X 20&#39; tent - that&#39;s our store and we carry lots and lots of stock - thousands of dollars worth. And there are crowds. We don&#39;t know if someone is watching us; we don&#39;t know if someone is planning on robbing us. It&#39;s just the two of us.<br/>
We travel other ways, also. My son lives in Texas - we go there, we travel to NYC; we travel to Florida. <br/>

<br/>
She was the victim of 2nd degree molestation already. Yes, it was someone we knew.<br/>
So what? Does that mean that being very careful w/ her is meaningless? All it means is that it can happen again. That&#39;s a reality. She&#39;s pretty good at defending herself now - she isn&#39;t good enough to walk a mile or so alone.<br/>
Brianna isn&#39;t fearful - she&#39;s aware. She pays attention.<br/>

I don&#39;t think you really read my post.<br/>
