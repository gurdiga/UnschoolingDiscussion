<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144081366">My daughter plays her v-smile a lot which all the games are geared towards learning . Hey I have noooo problem with that and no one forced her to sit there for 4 hours today and play it :) <br/>
Well she has expressed an intrest in playing some computer games so I went looking. Everything im finding for a 5 year old age range seems to be geared towards teaching them something and I thought it would be nice to have a game just for fun. Any suggestions?<br/>
 <br/>
So now the heart attack part......Today i find Courtney in the bedroom with one end of a scarve tired to the top rung of her bunkbed ladder and the other end around her waist. She lets go and says mom look Im an acrobat while hanging there by the scarve. I could help it I just blurted out oh my goodness you are going to fall! <br/>
She had tested things out by putting all her animals in a bag and hanging them first.....I had to gently explain that maybe her animals didnt weigh as much as her but what a great idea the testing was. Then she also tied her sister and made a pully system to get her up to the top bunk. That I had to put a stop to. <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway someone put things into perspective for me and help prevent future heart attacks. <br/>
When I was 5 I used to jump off the second story balcony with a sheet trying to parachute and Im still here ( the house was built on a hill so it wasnt that far down) and we wont talk about the fact that my parents discovered that I learned how to ride my bike but not how to use the breaks at the wrong time :) But I still freak when my kids try to do things. <br/>

My kids all loved Putt Putt, Freddi the Fish, and Spy Fox games.  <br/>

<br/>
I remember once we had a sled with a rope on the front of it so that <br/>
you could pull the sled (it came that way, we didn&#39;t put the rope on <br/>
it).  Somehow in the course of play my daughter had the rope wrapped <br/>
around her neck and was being strangled. I saw her and got the rope <br/>
off of her neck.  I still shudder when I think of that.  I can <br/>
remember another time when I walked into the room and found my son <br/>
choking on food and saved him from choking. <br/>
<br/>
Both times I thought, &quot;OMG, what if I hadn&#39;t been there&quot;.  But the <br/>
fact is that I was there, and when your daughter was hanging from the <br/>
bed you were there, and I think that&#39;s the most important thing we <br/>
can do as parents to ensure our kids&#39; safety.  BE there.  <br/>
