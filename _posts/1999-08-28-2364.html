<div id="ygrps-yiv-715358184">My hubby is the one that will have a dozen different projects going all at<br/>
once.  And procrastinates on when he will complete them, usually waiting<br/>
until the last moment.  I am the one that MUST get things finished before we<br/>
start something else and I must be constructively busy all of the time.  For<br/>
me work is fun.  I found that reading about the Myers Briggs personality<br/>
types and typing each family member helped me to better understand that they<br/>
are not out to drive me crazy on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
But, the strange thing is, he is the one that wanted the girls to complete<br/>
the school year in ps regardless of how miserable they were.  He is the one<br/>
that wants them complete the year of guitar, regardless of interest or<br/>
ability.  I am the one that will let them drop activities as their interest<br/>
and ability dictates unless it is a team sort of thing.  If you have other<br/>
members of a team or organization counting on you, then you must finish out<br/>
the season or production.  If I paid money for the classes or activity, the<br/>
kid owes me a refund for any unused classes.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Liz</div>

I don&#39;t think this is strange at all, based on your comments about your <br/>
hubby.  I find that the traits that I most dislike about myself are the ones <br/>
that make me cringe the most when I see them displayed in my children.  Those <br/>
are also the traits that I will fight to the death, usually unreasonably, to <br/>
make sure they don&#39;t pick up.  Unfortunately, I think that often the harder I <br/>
push my children not to do something the same way I perceive is wrong, the <br/>
more likely they are to pick up that very trait!  Hope this makes sense! <br/>
