<br/>
Just a little bit ago, we were talking about camping arrangements for Grand <br/>

extravaganzas we&#39;ve had the past few years).  It was pointed out to me that <br/>
we would have &quot;the teens&quot; anyway.  That means the crowd that&#39;s usually at our <br/>
house (all but one homeschooled), and the unschoolers who are friends with my <br/>
niece in another town.<br/>
<br/>
Someone said that another family (the mom I&#39;ve known for 23 years; the oldest <br/>
kid is 15 or so) wanted to camp near us because they were going to have some <br/>
visiting teenaged girls.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of froze inside and said, &quot;But they&#39;re schooled kids, and it will be <br/>
different.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Creepy feeling, having boys after all my years of being a girlchild and <br/>
teenaged girl in a family of all girls!<br/>
<br/>
I realize that while I trust eight to ten homeschooled kids to be responsible <br/>
and non-sexual and careful and to eventually go to bed in their own beds, I <br/>
do NOT trust the addition of several school kids (of any gender, really).   <br/>
It will just change the balance.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to tell myself it&#39;s silly, but something nags at me. <br/>

Personally, I think the silliness is not in not trusting the non-homeshooled <br/>
children; I think the silliness is in trusting homeschooled children of <br/>
&quot;opposite&quot; genders to be &quot;non-sexual.&quot;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might seem silly if the kids weren&#39;t often at my house, if I hadn&#39;t known <br/>
half of them since they were born (my sister&#39;s 17 year old, both of Carol <br/>
Rice&#39;s kids), if the boys didn&#39;t confide in me, and if they hadn&#39;t camped <br/>
together half a dozen times before already, with adults around too, but not <br/>
making them go to sleep at a certain time, if I didn&#39;t know that they <br/>
travelled in little groups and didn&#39;t pair up, and if they didn&#39;t spend a lot <br/>
of time sleeping overnight at my house.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not &quot;silliness.&quot;  It&#39;s direct knowledge and confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow night four are coming from Espanola to go to a concert and stay <br/>
overnight here.  Some of the locals will probably spend the night here to get <br/>
to visit them, because they all know each other.  <br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t tell them where to sleep, and we won&#39;t separate boys from girls, but <br/>
there won&#39;t be any sexual activity.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If they&#39;re &quot;really clever,&quot; they will be able to rationalize sexual <br/>
&quot;mis&quot;conduct as just another part of &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Am I wrong?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For now, yes.<br/>
If things continue as they are now, when they have sex it will not be <br/>
misconduct.  It will be a conscious, planned activity.<br/>
<br/>
Of the +/- 10 boys and +/- seven girls in question, the ages range from 13 to <br/>
18, and none is yet sexually active.  The average age of the females is <br/>
greater than the average male age.  It&#39;s not for lack of opportunity to get <br/>
in private places.  It&#39;s from a surfeit of maturity and a lack of desperation <br/>
for affection, desperation for love, or the strong desire to be grown fast <br/>
and leave home.  All of them are still living at home, too.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the very-schooled girls the boys here know has been discussed among <br/>
them and from me and another parent.  Her dad is mean to her (alternately <br/>
ignoring and blaming), and she&#39;s expected to take care of her two younger <br/>
brothers who are about 6 and 8 ALL the time.  She is pretty anxious to get <br/>
the hell out of there, and she tends to &quot;want a boyfriend,&quot; and to offer <br/>
herself to an extent the boys were REALLY uncomfortable with.  They&#39;ve <br/>
stopped hanging out with her at all.  The first boy who will get her pregnant <br/>
will be her hero, because her dad will throw her out. She seems to be not <br/>
thinking much past that.<br/>
<br/>
Schooled kids sometimes have cliques and groups to report to on Monday about <br/>
how dates went.  What--no dates!?  There is pressure to keep up there, <br/>
sometimes.  There was when I was in school and I know it still exists.<br/>
<br/>
The homeschoolers we know aren&#39;t dating at all.  They go to movies in groups, <br/>
and they do things in pairs, but they&#39;re not &quot;couples.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. At least based on my experience. <br/>
<br/>
The unschooled teens I know don&#39;t do a lot of rationalizing and being<br/>
&quot;really clever&quot;. They&#39;re pretty up front about things. They talk through<br/>
issues a lot. They also stay up late and sleep in late and most of the<br/>
ones at our last big party didn&#39;t know how to do dishes without a<br/>
dishwasher, or so they said ;-) We cheerfully enlightened them...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that they&#39;re &quot;non-sexual&quot;; it&#39;s more that they&#39;ve<br/>
always recognized that these sorts of parties are not the appropriate<br/>
places to be sexual. At the last party here, there were 13 or 14 of them<br/>
and they had the whole guest house to themselves - I don&#39;t think any of<br/>
the adults were in there more than once the whole week. Cacie was,<br/>
though, and I just asked and she said there wasn&#39;t anything like that,<br/>
&quot;Just the regular people piles and sitting in laps and stuff&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is all about trust...<br/>

<br/>
Within life-history theory there is a basic trade-off between growth <br/>
and reproduction.  Those individuals within a species who have the <br/>
least desirable environment are most likely to grow less and <br/>
reproduce earlier.  If you apply that theory to homeschooling it <br/>
should predict that the homeschooled is more likely to delay sexual <br/>
activity when compared with the schooled child.  <br/>
<br/>
So, homeschooled teenagers should be much safer than non-<br/>
homeschooled teenagers when it comes to sexual precociousness.<br/>

P.S. I hate when my son (5 yrs old) plays with one of his schooled <br/>
friends.  He comes back completely wrapped up in the hierarchy of <br/>
age.  Sigh  I just tell I&#39;m 33 so I must know infinitely more than <br/>
his friend does, so he should trust my opinion and age doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter.  Fortunately he hasn&#39;t sussed out that paradox, yet.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t listen to me, anyhow.  He just laughs.</div>

Thank you all for the responses.<br/>
<br/>
I now have even more, then I had before, to chew on.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t even really thought about homeschooling&#39;s effect on socialization in <br/>
this positive way.  (Don&#39;t get me wrong, I believe very strongly that <br/>
homeschooling is much better for a child&#39;s socialization opportunities and <br/>
development.)<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, my objection to public school has always been based upon the <br/>
educationally-stunting effects of public school methods.  I also do not like <br/>
the numerous negative social episodes that occur in public schools (in the <br/>
bathrooms and elsewhere), but I had never really thought to link premature <br/>
sexual experimentation to public school.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like an idiot saying that, as it seems so obvious now that I have <br/>
thought about it for a little more than three minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if there are any formal studies on this subject?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514160683">Well, here&#39;s more on this.<br/>
<br/>
First back to my crusade!  We need to reclaim the whole socialization <br/>
thing.  Don&#39;t let ps parents bully you on it.  We KNOW our kids are <br/>
getting better socialization than theirs.  We need to start being <br/>
upfront and in their face about it as they have been with us for so <br/>
long.<br/>
<br/>
Second, about the sexuality thing.  Rachel is 17, has been on two <br/>
dates and is not showing any signs of wanting to go on another.  I was <br/>
chatting with another homeschooling friend of mine about it and the <br/>
thought came up that it is because they have their own identities.  In <br/>
other words, because they&#39;ve been allowed to find themselves, they <br/>
aren&#39;t still searching for themselves in sex.<br/>
<br/>
But, I know other homeschoolers for whom I think the whole thing is <br/>
just like it is in school.  So just being homeschooled is no <br/>
guarentee.  In fact I think we are back to the super-saturation thing. <br/>
 The reason I think the problem is still there for the aforementioed <br/>
group is because they have been together for years and their lives <br/>
have included a lot of structured classes and other time consuming <br/>
things.  It&#39;s been kind of a school away from school thing.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure there aren&#39;t.  Not about unschoolers, anyway.  And if there&#39;s one <br/>
that has analyzed factors in early vs. late sexual activity, I&#39;m guessing all <br/>
their subjects would be schooled kids, AND that many of them would by lying.<br/>
<br/>
There used to be surveys of students when I was in school, and when I was <br/>
teaching.  I remember being evasive on the surveys, not trusting that they <br/>
weren&#39;t going to show them to parents.  And when I was a teacher, I&#39;d hear <br/>
the kids later, laughing about what they had written.  Those who were <br/>
absolutely confident that the forms WERE anonymous and unconnected with <br/>
particular kids would lie to make their sex or drug use MORE (or existent <br/>
where it wasn&#39;t), and it seemed, in large part, just to goof with the people <br/>
running the survey.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I read Kate&#39;s post about it being silliness (I know, she&#39;s changed <br/>
her mind some &lt;g&gt;) to Marty, and when I read &quot;Am I wrong?&quot;  he said &quot;Yes, she <br/>
is!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as I know there are very few studies on homeschoolers in <br/>
general.  Homeschoolers are considered a self-selected population <br/>
and due to that setting up causality becomes incredibly <br/>
problematic.  So, interpreting whether or not children who have been <br/>
homeschooled are less sexually precocious due to the amount of <br/>
parental investment given or due to some other common denominator <br/>
among homeschooled children is considered to difficult to be <br/>
tenable. <br/>
<br/>
However, there are a number of studies on the direct care of <br/>
children and the effect that has on age at first sexual <br/>
experience.  &quot;Risk factors and life processes associated with <br/>
teenage pregnancy: Results of a prospective study from birth to 20 <br/>
years&quot;, Woodward L, Fergusson DM, Horwood LJ. JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE <br/>
AND THE FAMILY v. 63(#4) pp. 1170-1184 NOV 2001.  This study found <br/>
that those girls who were raised in a &quot;family environment <br/>
characterized by parental instability&quot; were more likely to have had <br/>
a teenage pregnancy. &quot;Sex differences in disposition towards kin, <br/>
security of adult attachment, and sociosexuality as a function of <br/>
parental divorce&quot;, Barber N. EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR v. 19(#2) <br/>
pp. 125-132 MAR 1998. Barber found that parental divorce - which he <br/>
predicted to be associated with lower levels of parental care - was <br/>
associated with a higher sociosexuality index (a survey produced by <br/>
Steve Gangestad and Jeffrey Simpson to measure willingness to be <br/>
sexually active), a lower willingness to help others, and lower <br/>
GPAs.  Of course another study done in Australia <br/>
(&quot;What distinguishes women with unusually high numbers of sex <br/>
partners?&quot;, Mikach SM, Bailey JM. EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR v. 20<br/>
(#3) pp. 141-150 MAY 1999) found no recalled family adversity linked <br/>
with a higher level of sociosexuality.  In fact the only link found <br/>
was: &quot;[o]n several measures related to masculinity, women with many <br/>
sex partners were elevated compared with other women.&quot; Bailey, <br/>
however, is heavily invested in attachment theory and later <br/>
suggested that the Sociosexuality Index while affective in measuring <br/>
male sexuality missed in measuring female sexuality as evidenced by <br/>
the findings he made in this study. Barber has done another study <br/>
(&quot;The role of reproductive strategies in academic attainment&quot;, SEX <br/>
ROLES v. 38(#3-4) pp. 313-323 FEB 1998) that found an association <br/>
between parental divorce and higher sociosexuality and lower GPA.  <br/>
<br/>
Actually, it is hard to do this kind of search. Figuring out what <br/>
the keywords would be is really tricky. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow. There are a few bodies of theory about early ages at first <br/>
sexual experience and family dynamics.  Draper and Harpending (both <br/>
anthropologists, but oddly using evolutionary psychology to examine <br/>
early age at first menstruation) found an association between father <br/>
absence and earlier ages at menarche (first menstruation).  They <br/>
hypothesized that this was due to the environment of their <br/>
upbringing.  That is, due to the absence of their father these girls <br/>
were being brought up in an environment that taught them that men <br/>
were unstable and that they should get all they can from men.  So <br/>
they become sexually active early in order to coerce resources from <br/>
potential mates for a longer period of time.  This is all done <br/>
biologically and not consciously. The problem with this theory IMO <br/>
is that they are speaking of an evolved mechanism that seems fairly <br/>
rigid.  That is if the environment changes before menarche is <br/>
reached--for example their mothers move into a more stable <br/>
relationship--than the systems are already in place and they reach <br/>
menarche early and they become sexual active in a way not predicted <br/>
for by their current environment.  And given that a number of <br/>
studies have recently found that the time of greatest effect of <br/>
father absence on likelihood of children to enter college is in the <br/>
high school years, we seem to be fairly sensitive to our <br/>
environment.  Also, these findings have not been replicated outside <br/>
of modern populations.  Among Mayans and Ache (a population of <br/>
hunter-gatherers living in Paraguay) my dh found that father absence <br/>
was associated with later ages at first reproduction in men(he was <br/>
looking at male sexuality).  There is also a recent, non-published <br/>
study by Sara Grainger looking at 415 women in Liverpool that could <br/>
not replicate the findings of Draper and Harpending, of Belsky and <br/>
of Ellis and of others. She argues that there may be type 1 errors <br/>
in the sampling and statistical methods used by the researchers, as <br/>
well as confounding variables that may have produced findings that <br/>
would not have been found otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
The main problem with this hypothesis is evolution.  Under the <br/>
rubric of evolution those creatures that can produce the greatest <br/>
number of offspring will have the greatest number of genetic <br/>
representatives in future generations. Reaching menarche earlier, if <br/>
there is no subsequent cost, should be associated with greater <br/>
offspring number.  And greater offspring number (Kaplan, etal--don&#39;t <br/>
remember the year) has been associated with greater grandchildren <br/>
number.  So, why would humans have evolved so that the most <br/>
advantaged (i.e., those with two parent households) have the fewest <br/>
number of offspring.  One, we may have historically, and <br/>
prehistorically, suffered greater mortality when one parent was <br/>
absent.  Although Hill and Hurtado, 1996, found that parental <br/>
divorce had no effect on child mortality among the Ache it did <br/>
strongly effect the risk of child homicide. Two, we may have evolved <br/>
to have sex not to have children (Perusse, again, can&#39;t remember the <br/>
year). This doesn&#39;t seem to be supported given the variation in <br/>
Sociosexuality Index, but having just done the search on Social <br/>
Science, I haven&#39;t really thought about it long enough.  The third <br/>
possibility is that the association is not at all to do with father <br/>
absence, but do to with poverty and the foods associated with <br/>
poverty.  There is a process called twinning in sheep.  Sheep are <br/>
kept at 3/4 rations for some proportion of the year prior to going <br/>
into heat.  And then, immediately before they do go into heat, the <br/>
ranchers will up their food rations to double what they need.  <br/>
Because of the flush environment they produce twins instead of <br/>
having singleton births.  For the poor in many industrialized <br/>
populations the food is high in fat and calories and may be driving <br/>
the age of menarche lower and lower.  Father absence is heavily <br/>
associated with poverty. And diet has been clearly linked with <br/>
earlier ages at menarche.  And poverty has been clearly linked with <br/>
obesity.  It is an on-the-fly causal path model, I haven&#39;t put a lot <br/>
of thought into it.  <br/>
<br/>
There are other models.  Hillard Kaplan has a modified the economics <br/>
human capital model.  His theory is that people will invest in <br/>
themselves so that they may better be able to invest in their <br/>
offspring. Within a market economy he has found that there seems to <br/>
be no end to the returns of investing in one&#39;s self.  That is for <br/>
hunter-gatherer&#39;s and other subsistence level populations there is a <br/>
point at which investing in the skills of hunting peccararies or of <br/>
gathering palm hearts is finite.  The skills will never get any <br/>
greater.  But for those within market-based economies there is no <br/>
point when your skills are unimprovable.  So, you choose.  You <br/>
choose between quality of offspring or quantity of offspring.  And <br/>
that would be expressed in earlier ages of first sexual experience <br/>
and earlier ages of first reproduction.  The decision, Hilly argues, <br/>
is based upon the individuals ability to parlay time invested in <br/>
themselves into true skills.  So, if you are really capable of <br/>
learning and have had high levels of parental investment (he is <br/>
talking about monetary investment, and not time) than you should <br/>
continue to invest in your own &quot;growth&quot; rather than into <br/>
reproduction.  It ends up being an evolved mechanism gone awry in <br/>
the current generalized environment. Unfortunately there is no data <br/>
to back this up.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Basic life-history theory argues that we have finite energy to be <br/>
split up in three arenas: growth, reproduction, and soma, otherwise <br/>
known as maintenance.  I recognize that these catagories may <br/>
overlap, but when modeling it is easier to lay them out as <br/>
individual groups. The division of energy is largely genetically <br/>
based.  However, within any species there is always variation.  <br/>
There was a wonderful study of two groups of American possum who <br/>
live in Virginia.  One group live on an island where there are no <br/>
cars.  The other on the mainland and they suffer huge mortality <br/>
costs due to cars.  The island population are less precocious.  They <br/>
grow more slowly, they reach reproduction later and have on average <br/>
three litters.  The mainland population is characterized by early <br/>
age at first reproduction, smaller body size, larger litter size, <br/>
and earlier age at mortality.  There is no genetic difference.  The <br/>
two populations have different life-histories due to differences in <br/>
the risk of dying.  Those individuals on the mainland who continued <br/>
to delay reproduction so that they could grow were more likely to be <br/>
hit by cars before they had babies who would also be more likely to <br/>
delay reproduction.  So, within our species what makes for a switch <br/>
between growth to reproduction?  Girls stop growing when they reach <br/>
menarche.  Being small often leads to smaller offspring size. As <br/>
well as a higher risk of death during childbirth. Smaller babies <br/>
have a harder time surviving to sexual maturity.  And there is a <br/>
recent bout of literature suggesting that smaller babies have lower <br/>
IQs.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was decided to homeschool I did a bit of research to arm <br/>
myself for the debates with my family.  There is a body of research <br/>
that argues that preschool is better than keeping children at home.  <br/>
It states that children are more precocious when they are put in <br/>
preschool.  I have concluded that precociousness is overrated.  <br/>
Precocious individuals are individuals for whom growth is being <br/>
stopped so that they may reproduce before they die an early death.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow.  I&#39;m sorry if this was a bit technical.  I really enjoyed <br/>
writing it.  I don&#39;t get a lot of opportunity to talk about life-<br/>
history theory in my day to day.<br/>

&lt;&lt; As far as I know there are very few studies on homeschoolers in <br/>
general.  Homeschoolers are considered a self-selected population <br/>
and due to that setting up causality becomes incredibly <br/>
problematic.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And finding a group of homeschoolers and trying to make that itself a factor <br/>
will need to take into account whether the kids used to be in school.<br/>
<br/>
For example, about studying reading in unschooled kids--if that child EVER <br/>
went to school or had reading lessons, they&#39;re no longer good for measuring <br/>
how long it will take without being taught.   There aren&#39;t that many who are <br/>
a &quot;clean catch,&quot; untainted by other factors.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Confounding variables&quot; are all over the damned place!!<br/>

daughter went to school briefly (daughter&#39;s choice, mothers&#39; <br/>
frustration) and in that moment learned to read.  Now whenever they <br/>
talk about school derisively the daughter says &quot;But I learned how to <br/>
read there.&quot;  No matter that the time in prior to that is how she <br/>
really learned to read.  Sigh...  So much schooling invading the <br/>
purity of our unschooled little darlings.  <br/>
