I homeschool an only, and although we have far more neighbors than I&#39;d like<br/>
(we live in an apartment building of 18 families with 26 more buildings<br/>
around!), my son still finds his friends mainly from our church and his<br/>
soccer team.  He&#39;s looking forward to starting scouts this fall.<br/>
<br/>
But friends is different than socializing, remember.  Tim socializes with<br/>
lots of people.  We chat with storekeepers who speak English (I&#39;m in<br/>
Germany), people in line, on trains, etc.  Volunteering is good, too.<br/>
<br/>
I found that 10a.m. was the best time to hit the library or bookstores if<br/>
you&#39;re looking for other homeschoolers.  It&#39;s before nap time for the<br/>
toddlers, but after morning rush.  Obviously it&#39;s summer right now, but<br/>
maybe in the fall you&#39;ll run into some folks who could be friendly without a<br/>
statement of faith!<br/>
<br/>
And finally, I can tell you that my son is a loner.  He likes other kids and<br/>
socializes just fine, but he prefers the company of the bugs and birds.<br/>
Unless you have a child who&#39;s begging for more friends, it&#39;s possible she&#39;s<br/>
happy in your current situation!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I have a huge question for the group which I&#39;m sure is asked by every newbie.<br/>
&gt; How will my daughter socialize with other kids?  It seems the common answer is<br/>
&gt; through homeschool groups.  Well, as I posted earlier, I live basically in the<br/>
&gt; middle of nowhere on a dead end road in southern Oklahoma.  The closest town<br/>
&gt; of 25,000 has one homeschool group & they require a Faith statement.  But more<br/>
&gt; than that, I know several people in it - they are very fundamental Christians<br/>
&gt; which is their choice and I respect that.  But every time I get near them,<br/>
&gt; they try to convert me.  I don&#39;t want that for my daughter.  Also, my daughter<br/>
&gt; is an only child, so she won&#39;t learn with brothers/sisters.  I am VERY<br/>
&gt; concerned about sending her to public school - but I don&#39;t want to isolate<br/>
&gt; her, either.  It&#39;s bad enough that, although we attend the most liberal church<br/>
&gt; in the area, I spend every sunday &quot;de-programming&quot; her from Sunday School.  On<br/>
&gt; the plus side, she is learning at a very young age to question the facts we<br/>
&gt; are spoon fed.  I would love to hear from other homeschoolers of only<br/>
&gt; children?!?  <br/>
