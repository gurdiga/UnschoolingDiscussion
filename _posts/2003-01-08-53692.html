&gt; &lt;&lt; I carpooled with<br/>
&gt; another juror, an 80-year-old world traveler who wanted to be a<br/>
&gt; race car driver in her youth. I closed my eyes a lot as we drove to<br/>
&gt; court each day. ;) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So you were making the 80 year old drive?<br/>
&gt; Was there a third in this carpool?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>MAKING her drive? I begged to be allowed to drive half the days. &lt;g&gt; No go.<br/>
Glenda (aka Speed Racer) loves to drive. I did insist on giving her my<br/>
mileage checks from the court, however. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Wally found her some car racing schools (where they put you behind the wheel<br/>
of a race car and teach you how to drive it) and I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s going<br/>
to enroll in one.<br/>
<br/>
No third in the carpool -- we tried to talk another juror into joining us<br/>
(we all live in the same town and were commuting to the county courthouse<br/>
each day, about 20+ miles away) but he said No Way once he&#39;d seen Glenda<br/>
driving. And he&#39;s no coward, he&#39;s a local fireman. :)<br/>
