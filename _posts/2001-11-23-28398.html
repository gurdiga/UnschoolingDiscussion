I f you do nothing else before the New Year......take the big step and SHINE<br/>
that SINK!!  Only commit to that until the New Year......I&#39;ve been a Fly<br/>
baby for 3-1/2 months.  For the first 28 days,  that was the only baby step<br/>
I could handle - it truly does spread.  It has made a world of difference in<br/>
our family life,  though I still have a long journey ahead,  I&#39;m not ashamed<br/>
or embarassed to &quot;have anyone over&quot;.<br/>

my children are not very good at picking up either.  So, I just don&#39;t<br/>
have anybody over.  One day I&#39;ll have it all together and I&#39;ll have a<br/>

Thanks so much for the encouragement.  I already shine the sink and the<br/>
counters near the sink are clear of stuff and nice and clean.  What I<br/>
need to do is sit down and write down where my hot spots are and go from<br/>
there.  I&#39;ve  got lots of those &quot;hot spots&quot;!  I am truly overwhelmed.  I<br/>
should probably make it a &quot;54 Fling Boogie&quot; instead of a &quot;27 Fling<br/>
Boogie&quot;!  I am a Fly Baby in the making.  I&#39;m not giving up.  If anyone<br/>
can help me, it&#39;s FLY Lady.  I think she&#39;s wonderful and her philosophy<br/>
of setting the example, I believe, goes very well with out unschooling<br/>
lifestyle.<br/>
