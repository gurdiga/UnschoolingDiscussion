<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031689509">I actually will have less of a problem with babysitting during the <br/>
weekend. The woman who will be taking care of them works part time <br/>
during the week, so is mostly home every weekend. I will be taking <br/>
her children during the week while she works.  When I said I was <br/>
worried about it being hard on them spending time with her, then time <br/>
with me.. I was worried at the time about the kids switching back and <br/>
forth between projects, but we have talked more, and she usually does <br/>
mostly art projects during the weekend.. and if they&#39;re in the middle <br/>
of something here and don&#39;t want to have to wait to finish, i&#39;ll <br/>
simply take it to her. It&#39;s actually funny. They&#39;ve only been out of <br/>
school 2 days, and I already see a difference in my son. He made <br/>
everyone breakfast in bed this morning.... this child who usually <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get up to get his own bowl of cereal or pop-tart... and he <br/>
has drawn me 4 pictures this morning, and all included hearts and <br/>
flowery sayings. I haven&#39;t seen him this relaxed and affectionate in <br/>
a year or more. I should have done this sooner.<br/>
