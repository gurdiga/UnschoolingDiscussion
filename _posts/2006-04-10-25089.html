on <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminded me of trampolines.  So many people have<br/>
these exhaustive rules about trampoline safety.  The<br/>
most common one that we&#39;ve run into is the &quot;Only one<br/>
person at a time&quot; rule.  How boring is that??  We&#39;ve<br/>
never had that rule here and I can&#39;t count the many,<br/>
many hours that my kids have spent happily playing<br/>
games on the trampoline with their friends and family<br/>
members, active bouncy games, quieter sit down games,<br/>
and combo games with some of both.  They&#39;ve had as<br/>
many as 5 people on the trampoline at one time with no<br/>
problems, and we don&#39;t have the largest trampoline in<br/>
the world or anything.  In fact it&#39;s rather small. <br/>
<br/>
Last summer my oldest horribly broke his arm when he<br/>
tripped coming off the bottom of the slide at the<br/>
community center, but we&#39;ve never had any serous<br/>
injuries on the trampoline.<br/>

  I know what you mean.  My 11 year old son has a pair of Heelys(shoes with wheels) and is always being told how dangerous they are and to stop heeling around.  I told him, the next time someone tells him that they are dangerous to tell them that driving a car is dangerous.<br/>
   <br/>
  Should I be teaching my child to talk back to adults?  I am just so sick, tired and frustrated with the &quot;Fun Police&quot;!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394453127">Sneakers that have just one wheel in each heel.<br/>
They are tough to learn, as you feel so<br/>
off-balance...but once you learn to skate, you&#39;ve GOT<br/>
it!<br/>
The wheels can be removed.  They&#39;re not the fold-away<br/>
type wheels.<br/>
<br/>
Some adults think they&#39;re cool and have no problem<br/>
with kids heelying around.  Other adults are seemingly<br/>
terrified of what COULD happen if the child were to<br/>
lose control.<br/>

Seems like a lot of fear out there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934003890">What size do they wear?  I saw size 1 heelies in the store while we <br/>
were buying a new pair yesterday of size 5 heelies for my 6 year <br/>
old.  He likes them a bit big I think because they run small (lots <br/>
of padding) and he has a wide foot.  So, they&#39;re a bit long, but <br/>
comfortably wide (same foot style as me!)<br/>
<br/>
R&#39;s friends wear them and they&#39;re a bit big on some of them, but <br/>
they enjoy them - maybe just tie them tighter?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also gotten comments, on these and the ones before (folding <br/>
wheels that went in and out) including getting &#39;spoken to&#39; at <br/>
Legoland, being told they were not allowed (I never saw any notice <br/>
about that) and that if we insisted upon letting him wear them, we <br/>
would have to accept any liability associated with that.  I nodded <br/>
and waited for her to go away. :)<br/>
<br/>
Regarding those one that have folding wheels, I do NOT recommend <br/>
those except for the most mild child because R had those broken in <br/>
two months since he wore them every day with the wheels always out <br/>
(and I do mean the metal brackets snapped off in addition to the <br/>
wheels going one at a time). :) <br/>
<br/>
Those were the ones he chose the first time, but the fun wore off <br/>
when the wheels did. :)<br/>
<br/>
The heelies are of MUCH higher quality. We had them for two months <br/>
before we forgot them at the park and they looked just as good as <br/>
new. I hope the kid that found them is enjoying them. :)<br/>
<br/>
Just keep your eye out for a sale because they run at $89, but we <br/>
bought each pair for $49, also partially because we didn&#39;t need the <br/>
plate and tool that the salesman recommended since heelies aren&#39;t <br/>
allowed in schools. R never takes his wheels out! :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also mutually fun to go places quicker, since he just grabs on <br/>
my arm and is pulled along. :)  We kept stumbling over ourselves for <br/>
the few days we were without the heelies.<br/>
<br/>

the sizes if your six year old has some. My sons are seven and four.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
