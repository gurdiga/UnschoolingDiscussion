<div id="ygrps-yiv-21226393">Hello! <br/>
I just joined today and thought I would g take a sec to introduce <br/>
myself to everyone. My name and general info. are below. I am 34, <br/>
will celebrate 16 years of marriage in October to my wonderful <br/>
husband (who is a mail carrier) and unschool (have homeschooled for 6 <br/>
years and am new to unschooling) our 4 fabulous sons (born 8/29/86, <br/>
1/8/88, 8/17/90 and 12/12/91). We live in NE Ohio with our male cat <br/>
(Red), 3  female Guinea Pigs (Bubbles, Buttercup & Blossom) who <br/>
joined our family yesterday (we had a male  bunny named Cat and he <br/>
was too agressive for us to handle.....the family we gave him to have <br/>
other bunnies), male dog (Black Lab named Buckeye) and 2 male <br/>
Mississippi Map turtles (1 we have had for almost 6 years and the <br/>
other for a little over a year--their names are LT and DM for <br/>
Lawrence Taylor and Dan Marino). I am a &quot;Lake Girl&quot;  (I love Lake <br/>
Erie and living within walking distance --5 blocks) and a &quot;small town <br/>
girl&quot; (which makes living in this tiny village of 1500 people <br/>
enjoyable).<br/>
<br/>
 My dh is a mail carrier and I have always been an at home mom. I am <br/>
very family oriented (of course) and am a &quot;koolaid mom&quot; (this is the <br/>
house all the kids congregate at).<br/>
<br/>
 I am an Ohio native and my dh is a New York native but my mother <br/>
(who is 53) and sisters & their families live in TX (my dad lived in <br/>
OH almost all of his life and moved to KY last August and passed <br/>
away, at age 53, last Nov.---the day after Thanksgiving) and my dh&#39;s <br/>
aunts, uncles and cousins live in NY while his brother and his wife <br/>
and daughter & her family live in CA and his son lives in HI (my dh&#39;s <br/>
parents would be 80 and 85 this year but they passed on in 11/79, his <br/>
mom and 11/81, his dad.....his parents died on 11/23 and 11/25 and my <br/>
dad died on 11/24). I have 2 younger sisters (ages 34 and 26) who <br/>
have 5 children between them (Martha, 33, has 1 son and 2 <br/>
daughters.....Timothy was born in 1/87, Krysten was born in  12/88 <br/>
and Bailey was born TODAY around noon TX time--weighing in at 8#3oz. <br/>
and measuring 21 in. long--I am a very happy aunt today!!!!) & Lynda <br/>
has 2 sons--Forrest born 3/94 and Perrin born 12/12/00--my 9yo&#39;s <br/>
bday) & Gary has 2 older brothers (his oldest brother is 55 and other <br/>
brother would have been 45 this year) who have 3 children between <br/>
them (Bob has 1 daughter, Tina, who will be 33 this year and 1 son, <br/>
Brian, who is 27 & Alan&#39;s son, Michael, is 17) and Tina has 2 <br/>
children (Antony, not Anthony, is 12 and Marley was born 12/22/00). <br/>
We don&#39;t see our families often but we speak to them often and <br/>
email/IM them often. Gary & I are the only ones in our families to <br/>
homeschool our children but thankfully everyone accepts our choice.<br/>
<br/>
 I enjoy reading, taking long walks, listening to music/going to <br/>
concerts (I am 80&#39;s rocker type....LOL), cooking/baking, being with <br/>
my family, travelling (on a shoestring) and more that I can&#39;t think <br/>
of.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway....that&#39;s me in a nut shell....sorry for rambling.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and sharing <br/>
info... :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713403595">Welcome.  How have you evolved towards unschooling?  Just curious.  I did my <br/>
intro awhile back.  My three boys are coming up on their third birthday <br/>
(triplets) and I&#39;m preparing to unschool.  Today was gorgeous in NJ and they <br/>
spent hours turning over rocks in the back yard to see ants, termites (yuck), <br/>
lots of worms, rolly pollies, etc.  I started cleaning up the yard and tieing <br/>
the raspberry canes on to the latticework, giving thanks the whole while that <br/>
I could do anything independently while they are awake.  It has been a long <br/>
three years of focusing exclusively on them during their waking hours.  Two <br/>
helped me tie up the canes by holding the ties and handing them up when I <br/>
asked.  It is wondrous to get help from someone less than 3 years old!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732454485">I was stunned and horrified to read what your daughter has gone through.  But then, maybe that is because it is an all to common story.  Or, more likely, it is because it is exactly what I went through in public school in the inner city.  <br/>
<br/>
The drugs, violence, sexual harassment, getting beat up, self esteem destroying belittlement and punishments, being forgotten and ignored, being bored, struggling to survive, and wallowing in deep depression with no hope in sight, these were my childhood realities too.  When I was younger (6-9) I used to hide under my bed, and in the attic of our garage (which used to be a carriage house) to avoid going to school.  I began cutting school when I was your daughter&#39;s age.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was 14 I took MYSELF out of school and entered an independent study HS, which made a world of difference, and my studies excelled.  But I had to go all the way to the county seat of the school board and threaten to drop out.  I fought with my parents, the school, everyone, but I got out.  My mother told all her friends at her social club that THEY (my parents) had put me in a &quot;special&quot; school for kids with &quot;problems&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
How fortunate your daughter is to have a mother who cares, and who is willing to think outside the box to find a sane, happy learning environment for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-639845997">Welcome, Jeannie!<br/>
<br/>
I have a 12-year-old daughter that I took out of middle school in <br/>
January. She is so much happier -- smiling more and just generally in <br/>
a great mood. She was bored in school as well as sick and tired of <br/>
hearing every swear word in the book as she passed between classes. <br/>
I&#39;ve also noticed a postive change in her maturity level. And even <br/>
though she is acting more mature, she has taken a renewed interest in <br/>
her Barbie stuff. It&#39;s okay for her to play here. It&#39;s okay for her to <br/>
still be a kid in our home. She did not feel comfortable at middle <br/>
school, where all the kids are trying to &quot;fit in&quot; and grow up too <br/>
fast. She loves being a kid and is trying to hang onto that as long as <br/>
possible. (If she&#39;s lucky, and I&#39;ve done my job right, perhaps, in her <br/>
heart, she will ALWAYS be a kid).<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter is interested in being a e-pen pal with my daughter, <br/>
send me an e-mail off list.<br/>

down time to recover from all that chaos and confusion. It must tear your heart 
to see her get so depressed. I&nbsp;bet she will blossom at home, where she is 
loved and cherished and not a &quot;product of the&nbsp;state&quot;.  </font></div>

<div>&quot;Our hunger to be bigger than we are could be just delusions of grandeur or 
it could be the very voice of God inside calling us to a larger inheritance, to 
a bigger stake in reality, to a truer sense of our identity as the sons and

 size="3" FAMILY="SERIF">Thank you for your support. &nbsp;There are many reasons 
  we decided to homeschool <br>our 12 year old daughter. &nbsp;I&#39;ve had a vague 
  interest &nbsp;in homeschooling since <br>she started. &nbsp;the 1st incident 
  that cause me to give more serious attention <br>to homeschooling was when her 
  1st grade teacher had her stand in the hall, <br>all day, because she hadn&#39;t 
  finished a homework assignment (that night we <br>were at the hospital with my 
  dad till after midnight and the school was aware <br>of this) from then till 
  now the system has shown little interest or <br>compassion in her educational 
  growth. &nbsp;she always complained about being <br>bored but wasn&#39;t 
  interested in homeschooling <br>this year there have been 3 police 
  investigations due to Internet threats <br>posted on the school website all 
  resulted in arrests, the girls had to go to <br>the restroom on the 1st floor 
  across from the office because of the continued <br>pot-smoking in the others, 
  there was a gun taken out of the backpack of a <br>child in my daughters 
  class, my daughter has endure sexual harassment (boys <br>grabbing her chest, 
  slapping her rear, being called whore and MUCH worse) <br>being called 
  &nbsp;crack head, pothead, dope addict. (bear in mind we live in a 
  <br>middle-class rural community of 23,000. the essence of Hometown America) 
  &nbsp; <br>every Sunday since November she&#39;d fall into a depression that i 
  could not &nbsp; <br>help her out of, crying and worrying, the pain she was in 
  was unbearable to <br>watch. &nbsp; <br>then one day she told me she was fully 
  committed to learning at home and the <br>next day i withdrew her from school. 
  &nbsp;and that is my too lengthy introduction <br>&nbsp;but i must say, she&#39;s 
  a much happier child today smiling, energetic, joking &nbsp; <br>(that is the 
  big thing, her sense of humor is back) she is sleeping according <br>to her 
  own schedule and hasn&#39;t had a headache since we withdrew her <br>again, thank 
  you for you support and advice. we will continue to learn and <br>grow with 
  all of you <br>jeannie</font> <br><br><tt>Message
