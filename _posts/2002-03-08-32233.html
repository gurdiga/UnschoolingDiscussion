<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112338840">Hi! I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing this correctly, because I&#39;m brand new to this <br/>
email list thing, but here are some websites I found for clubhouse and <br/>
playhouse kits that you can buy unassembled and then assemble yourself - <br/>
they say - in about an hour. (Coincidentally - or not - I was just thinking <br/>
of the same thing today, and your question gave me the impetus to search <br/>
these out.  Thanks!)<br/>

This is probably too much information, but I hope this is helpful!<br/>

&gt;already put together(really expensvie), or buy the plans. But, I want to<br/>
&gt;&quot;build&quot; it with the dks. I have the plans to one, but got completely<br/>
