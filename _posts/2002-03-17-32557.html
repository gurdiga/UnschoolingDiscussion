<div id="ygrps-yiv-482179479">since we went FREELY into  homeschooling. as a foster mom i also realized <br/>
MUCH Of my stress was someone else&#39;s expectations of me or the RULES of they <br/>
system .WHICH STILL UPSET ME GREATLY! as you may have seen on the tv <br/>
interview with diane sawyer regarding the foster care system. SO MUCH damage <br/>
AFTER they are in care...from the ill regard to children. We here on this <br/>
list are all child advocates and i love that. DENISE</div>
