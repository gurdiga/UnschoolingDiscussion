<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121670600">&lt;&lt; but i personally wouldn&#39;t delete posts because i thought someone had a <br/>
 different opinion than me... what if the next post they wrote was filled <br/>
with <br/>
 info i needed... or some idea that made me change my opinion??? i&#39;d be <br/>
 stifling myself.... so how do you tell what to delete? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I agree with this too... Even if I&#39;m beginning to read something that I don&#39;t <br/>
like about a particular post I read the rest of it.  I&#39;ve learned that there <br/>
is a lot of valuable information in a post that I can learn about another&#39;s <br/>
lifestyle or what they are doing with kids.  Your last one for example was <br/>
very interesting in how you do the unschooling with your hubbie.. My husband <br/>
is at work outside the home all day and gets home at 4:14pm and take over <br/>
with the kids then and all weekend so I can run my business.  It&#39;s wonderful <br/>
to see how he&#39;s different with them and what he brings to the relationship.  <br/>
However ultimately I&#39;m making the decisions because I&#39;m the one that&#39;s home.  <br/>
That&#39;s not to say that if he wants to do something with them he asks me... <br/>
Only asks me if I want to come with him, which most of the time, to be honest <br/>
when I&#39;ve been with them from 6am every morning, if he wants to do something <br/>
with the kids in this 109 degree weather I&#39;m just as happy for him to go and <br/>
give me a few hours peace and quiet so I can get my head together and nourish <br/>
my own soul and spirit for the onslaught of questions coming the next day <br/>
(LOL)....<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are working on changing positions... We are consolidating <br/>
our outstanding debt so that he can stay home with the kids and I&#39;ll expand <br/>
my business to support all of us... The goal is for both of us to work part <br/>
time in our respective businesses so that we can both be at home with the <br/>
kids and give them the benefit of both of us.  This is a life choice we are <br/>
making happen, one day at a time.<br/>
