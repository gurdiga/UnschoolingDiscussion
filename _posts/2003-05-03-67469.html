 If anyone came to where there was more than one egg in one place, they only <br/>
 took one.  The kid who found that last might not know that was &quot;the prize <br/>
 egg&quot; but at that point it didn&#39;t matter, they&#39;d only get one. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to figure out a way to do dollars without anyone feeling <br/>
badly...that&#39;s a good idea.<br/>
For the last few years we&#39;ve simply figured out how many eggs per person and <br/>
asked them to stop collecting once they hit the maximum. That has worked <br/>
really well, but I had to put similar stuff in every egg.<br/>

&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>
