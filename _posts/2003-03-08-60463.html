<div id="ygrps-yiv-209670890">Hello Everyone. We are new to your group and look forward to learning <br/>
all that we can from you about unschooling. We chose this method but <br/>
still have alot to learn about it. We took our 13 year old son out of <br/>
the public school last year as he suffered not only mentally but <br/>
suffered a head injury as a result of the children and the school <br/>
itself. We paln on keeping him home for good. Our concern however is <br/>
since our son was always an honor roll student and always kept on<br/>
task <br/>
will this method help him to continue to grow as the bright young man <br/>
he is? Since last year we have done everything together daily as a <br/>
family: trips, reading, etc. but we don&#39;t do sit down work (which is <br/>
something he does not enjoy and gets very bored). Is it fine to let <br/>
him explore his interest in animals and animals only? He wants to be<br/>
a vet when he&#39;s old enough and he studies this every minute! He likes <br/>
video games (non-violent) and loves to read just about everything! He <br/>
is not involved in sports or kid functions as we are still having a <br/>
hard time getting him to be around other children(he&#39;s very scared of <br/>
them). We do have him on-line talking to some other children that do <br/>
not go to school and that seems to be helping..slowly. We need to<br/>
hear <br/>
from unschoolers such as you, how a day of unschooling is, is there a <br/>
concern they won&#39;t learn, will they ever feel better about public <br/>
school kids and the such. Meantime we&#39;ll sit back and read the <br/>
postings and learn all that we can. <br/>
Thank-you! <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s fine for you to accept that he has a great interest in animals, and it&#39;s <br/>
great for you to encourage it by providing opportunities, resources and <br/>
freedoms.  But exploring an interest in animals isn&#39;t going to be &quot;animals <br/>
only.&quot;  There will be history and geography and science just in the course of <br/>
his earning what lives where and why and how.  There will be writing and <br/>
reading and math as things happen.  And he&#39;ll probably come to know about <br/>
religious traditions and taboos regarding various animals, who eats what or <br/>
doesn&#39;t, and where and why; who wears bits and parts of which animals where <br/>
and why; what animals are endangered where and why, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing&#39;s &quot;just&quot; anything.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;ur concern however is <br/>
since our son was always an honor roll student and always kept on<br/>
task <br/>
will this method help him to continue to grow as the bright young man <br/>
he is?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Try to forget all that.  <br/>
<br/>
But in one paragraph you say he always kept on task and in the next that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like sit-down busywork.   Instead of looking at what he&#39;s doing in <br/>
schoolish terms, try just seeing what he&#39;s learning and what makes him happy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
YOU have him online?  Or he&#39;s online of his own choice?  <br/>
It will help if you examine, as you get used to unschooling, who&#39;s doing what <br/>
to whom and who&#39;s deciding what for whom.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Read what&#39;s been written already at www.unschooling.com<br/>
and if you finish the good parts of that (meaning the parts you like)<br/>
you might look at sandradodd.com, where lots of articles and families&#39; <br/>
websites are collected and linked.<br/>

Wow, how fantastic. Sorry about his school experience but he seems to be on <br/>
the right track now. Do you have any idea how much math, language, science, <br/>
history and enjoyment he&#39;s going to get out of studying just animals??? I <br/>
say he&#39;s way ahead already and doing what he wants to do. Just trust him to <br/>
know what he likes and needs and let him go. Check out the archives from <br/>
this list and sit back and relax.<br/>
