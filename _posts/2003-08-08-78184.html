<div id="ygrps-yiv-728318326">This is right around the corner, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll miss this part <br/>
sometimes when it&#39;s gone, I just don&#39;t have the energy to keep up with <br/>
them and I feel bad about that.  It&#39;s hard to keep a toddler or two <br/>
happy from a chair.  Music is one thing Sandra reminded me that I don&#39;t <br/>
use enough. My kids *love* to dance and have me clap for them.  I plan <br/>
to trade our current TV time for music time and that will help them <br/>
release more of their energy more positively.  Also continuing to try <br/>
the next fix it for fatigue.  I guess I&#39;ll just keep trying til <br/>
something works.<br/>

<br/>
Why trade one for the other?<br/>
<br/>
Do both.  <br/>
<br/>
Watch music videos, or sing-alongs or kid-concerts.  There are two Raffi in <br/>
concert videos my kids LOVED, loved.<br/>
