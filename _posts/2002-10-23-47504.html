 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Because my parents do eat them, and will not move them from their spot on <br/>
the counter, so Brett usually gets one whenever he goes over there. It&#39;s <br/>
usually not a big deal, because he eats one so seldom (maybe once every two <br/>
months), and a dose of benedryl will clear him up within a couple of hours <br/>
or if we&#39;re going to be home we&#39;ll just deal with it and try to keep him <br/>
busy and happy. It was just bad timing that day. I didn&#39;t know he&#39;d had one <br/>
til after we got to the store and I smelled it when I leaned over him to get <br/>
the baby out of the car.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Okay I hate to bring up the whole food restriction thing again but I&#39;m <br/>
really confused now. You had said in previous posts that you restrict your <br/>
children on foods for health reasons. What you feel is healthy and want them <br/>
to eat and what they also can&#39;t eat because of allergies and such. You also <br/>
said that Brett was old enough now to understand and stay away from foods <br/>
that bothered him. Your example was M & M&#39;s. If he can understand about <br/>
staying away from candy, why does he eat a banana whenever he goes over <br/>
grandma&#39;s house? It doesn&#39;t sound like the banana was not a big deal to me. <br/>
It caused him to freak out in the store doing things you say he normally <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do. It also made you leave without the things you already had, <br/>
which in my eyes punished him for having a banana that was there that he was <br/>
suppose to know not to eat.<br/>
<br/>
You say it&#39;s not a big deal that your parents leave them around because it&#39;s <br/>
not often, but yet he has one whenever he goes over, and the scene described <br/>
at the store, was not a pretty one. Sounds like a big deal to me.<br/>

  Okay I hate to bring up the whole food restriction thing again but I&#39;m <br/>
  really confused now. You had said in previous posts that you restrict your <br/>
  children on foods for health reasons.<br/>
<br/>
  ** Right, but I&#39;m talking about things like &quot;fake&quot; food, processed food, food with additives, etc. Fruit is natural, best organic. Same with veggies. <br/>
<br/>
   What you feel is healthy and want them <br/>
  to eat and what they also can&#39;t eat because of allergies and such. You also <br/>
  said that Brett was old enough now to understand and stay away from foods <br/>
  that bothered him.<br/>
<br/>
  ** I don&#39;t give common-allergy foods to children under the age of two (eggs, peanuts, etc). Brett does know and understand, and he usually does very good. However, when Nana is standing there offering him something he loves, he doesn&#39;t have enough self-control to turn it down every time. He often does tell her no, but not all the time. <br/>
<br/>
   Your example was M & M&#39;s. If he can understand about <br/>
  staying away from candy, why does he eat a banana whenever he goes over <br/>
  grandma&#39;s house?<br/>
<br/>
  ** Because he likes bananas much more than candy. Because he&#39;s always had to stay away from chocolate and food colorings, while bananas have been a much more recent problem - just within the last year and a half, actually. I think he does pretty good, especially considering his age. <br/>
<br/>
   It doesn&#39;t sound like the banana was not a big deal to me. <br/>
  It caused him to freak out in the store doing things you say he normally <br/>
  wouldn&#39;t do. It also made you leave without the things you already had, <br/>
  which in my eyes punished him for having a banana that was there that he was <br/>
  suppose to know not to eat.<br/>
<br/>
  ** It didn&#39;t cause him to freak out, it caused him to not be able to think things thru. Normally, he would have been able to remember about the dr all by himself, but I had to remind him about it. It just means I have to &quot;help&quot; him think, if that makes sense. He understood, and was calming down nicely until the woman jumped in. It was her telling him that it was ok, combined with him not thinking too clearly, that caused us to have to leave. Without her interference, everything would have been just peachy again in probably less than 3 minutes. <br/>
<br/>
  You say it&#39;s not a big deal that your parents leave them around because it&#39;s <br/>
  not often, but yet he has one whenever he goes over, and the scene described <br/>
  at the store, was not a pretty one. Sounds like a big deal to me.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  ** Not every time he goes over, he&#39;s there each Sunday morning, and usually only has a banana once ever 6-8 weeks. I think it&#39;s a big deal that he refuses it all those other weeks! :-)<br/>
<br/>
  Of course, ideally, it wouldn&#39;t even be a choice, but nothing can be perfect. <br/>

<br/>
Did she offer it or was it just on the counter, as you said earlier today?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really care which it is, I&#39;d just like for you to see how your <br/>
stories weasle in and around as they&#39;re &quot;clarified.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It just means I have to &quot;help&quot; him think, if that makes sense.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  Sounds like instead of taking resonsibility for <br/>
not figuring out a better way to handle stress and his mood, you blamed a <br/>
banana.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It was her telling him that it was ok, combined with him not thinking too <br/>
clearly, that caused us to have to leave.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  You blame a banana and a stranger for your personal behavior.<br/>

  ** She keeps them on the counter, he&#39;s told me she offers them sometimes. Both statements are true.<br/>

<br/>
  ** Yeah. Stress? What stress? Mood swings can be and are caused by allergies. Ask any doctor or anyone with an allergy.  <br/>
<br/>
  Oh.  You blame a banana and a stranger for your personal behavior.<br/>
<br/>
  Sandra<br/>
<br/>
  ** Um. No. A banana caused thinking problems, a rude stranger caused my child distress and is probably going to cost me $60.<br/>
