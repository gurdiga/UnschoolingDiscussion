DIG DEEPER<br/>
<br/>
Top 5 Reasons Why Parents Home School:<br/>
*	Can provide better education at home <br/>
*	Religious reasons <br/>
*	Poor learning environment at school <br/>
*	Family reasons <br/>
*	To develop character and morality <br/>

<br/>
FAQs:<br/>
<br/>
*	What are some of the benefits of home schooling?<br/>
For many, the deepest and most abiding benefit of home <br/>
schooling is the claiming (or reclaiming) of their family. <br/>
Home schooling families spend incredible amounts of time <br/>
together living, learning and playing. Many families like the <br/>
flexibility home schooling provides both parents and children. <br/>
Children can learn about things they are interested in at a <br/>
time in their lives when they are ready to learn. No <br/>
preconceived schedule forces them ahead or holds them <br/>
back. Vacations and outings can be planned for times when <br/>
the family is ready, and often when the crowds are smaller <br/>
and the costs lower. <br/>
<br/>
*	Are parents really qualified to teach their children?<br/>
Parents are their children&#39;s first and best teachers for most <br/>
of their formative years. Only parents will put these specific <br/>
children&#39;s needs first and search for the very best learning <br/>
resources for their particular children. Children in a home <br/>
schooling situation receive individualized, personal attention <br/>
from someone who has a vested interest in their success - <br/>
their parents. If a parent is not qualified to teach a particular <br/>
subject that a child needs or wants to learn, they have many <br/>
options: hire a tutor, barter for instruction, get together with <br/>
other families to create a class, learn along with the child, <br/>
or find a community, distance-learning or online class.<br/>
<br/>
Courtesy of the Ore. Home Ed. Network <br/>
(CBS) It is estimated that 850,000 children in this country <br/>
are home-schooled -- the overwhelming majority by parents <br/>
who have only the best interests of their children at heart. <br/>
<br/>
But homeschooling is largely unregulated. A CBS News <br/>
investigation reports how some children have suffered <br/>
abuse -- and much worse -- while no one was watching. <br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Neil and Christy Edgar will be sentenced next month in <br/>
Kansas for abusing and murdering their 9-year-old son. <br/>
He suffocated after his head was wrapped in duct tape <br/>
as a punishment for taking food without permission. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a shocking case, but as CBS News Correspondent <br/>
Vince Gonzales reports, not an isolated one. A CBS News <br/>
investigation found dozens of cases of parents convicted or <br/>
accused of murder or child abuse who were teaching their <br/>
children at home, out of the public eye. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;A lot of reports for suspected abuse or neglect are made <br/>
by the schools when they observe children coming in that <br/>
may be bruised or not well fed,&quot; says Marcia Herman-<br/>
Giddens, of the North Carolina Child Advocacy Institute. <br/>
<br/>
In Iowa, a father is serving life, and a mother goes on <br/>
trial later this month, for killing their 10-year-old adopted <br/>
son and burying him at their house. Because they were <br/>
home schooling, no one noticed he was missing for <br/>
more than a year. <br/>
<br/>
There are two notorious Texas cases. <br/>
<br/>
Andrea Yates gained national attention when she drowned <br/>
her five children in a bathtub. Deanna Laney, told <br/>
investigators she beat her three sons with rocks, killing <br/>
two of them. Both mothers taught their children at home. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The genuine home schoolers are doing a great job with <br/>
their children, but there is a subgroup of people that are <br/>
keeping them in isolation, keeping them from public view <br/>
because the children often do have visible injuries,&quot; says <br/>
Herman-Giddens. <br/>
<br/>
Even a very public home school success story can hide a <br/>
private dark side. Marjorie Lavery says her father beat her <br/>
before the National Spelling Bee then threatened to kill her <br/>
after she came in second. He pleaded guilty to child <br/>
endangerment after she testified about years of cruelty. <br/>
<br/>
Hal Young and other home school advocates vigorously <br/>
defend the right to teach their children at home without <br/>
government intrusion. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The cases that you&#39;ve mentioned are very, very rare - <br/>
extremely rare,&quot; says Young. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s not a pattern there, there&#39;s not a trend,&quot; says <br/>
Young. &quot;It&#39;s not something you can point your finger at <br/>
and say there&#39;s this vast undercurrent, because there&#39;s <br/>
not.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s hard to know how widespread abuse might be <br/>
because the government doesn&#39;t keep track. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
even know how many children are taught at home in this <br/>
country. <br/>
<br/>
In eight states, parents don&#39;t have to tell anyone they&#39;re <br/>
home schooling. Unlike teachers, in 38 states and the <br/>
District of Columbia, parents need virtually no <br/>
qualifications to home school. Not one state requires <br/>
criminal background checks to see if parents have <br/>
abuse convictions. <br/>
<br/>
The Edgars now face life in prison. The dilemma raised <br/>
by their case and others: how to protect parents&#39; rights <br/>
to raise their children and still protect children from <br/>
parents who abuse them. <br/>
