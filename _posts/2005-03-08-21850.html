<div id="ygrps-yiv-406673737">Continuing on that super-ego-and-culture theme, and changing directions a  <br/>
bit: <br/>
 <br/>
We have the luxury of our calm  and peaceful lives because the  U.S. is not <br/>
in the midst of a depression, there&#39;s not a war in our area (England  in 1940 <br/>
would&#39;ve been no place to peacefully unschool; people were a little  <br/>
distracted, and for a month or so big bombs were falling on them).    If I lived without <br/>
enough food I would TELL my children to eat and eat  now.  If I lived in need <br/>
of blackout, I would tell my kids to turn the  lights off and BE QUIET NOW.  <br/>
I see this as a luxury of peace and plenty,  but proving in those <br/>
circumstances that children can and do learn to read and  manipulate large numbers without <br/>
lessons, that they can pick up information  about history and science just in <br/>
the course of a fun life, and tie these things  in to all sorts of scattered <br/>
interests and hobbies and intellectual pursuits is  of benefit to the world&#39;s <br/>
general knowledge.   And these things I&#39;ve  listed above are possible because <br/>
of the abundance of printed word, and  broadcast information, and otherwise <br/>
fairly easily accessible information  arriving by the second.  What we do <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have been possible in 1850,  nor even 1950 except for the wealthiest who <br/>
could travel, have educated servants  to hang out with children and answer their <br/>
questions in a leisurely fashion, see  plays and live music, etc.   <br/>
