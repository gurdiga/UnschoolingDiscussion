A Dark Side To Home Schooling<br/>
SMITHFIELD, N.C., Oct. 13, 2003<br/>

&quot;There was rotting food, animal feces on the floor. I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine anyone living in a residence like this.&quot;<br/>
Tom Lock,<br/>
Johnston County district attorney<br/>
<br/>
(CBS)Â The school bus never stopped at the secluded trailer on <br/>
Hickory Crossroads in rural North Carolina because for five <br/>
years Nissa and Kent Warren home schooled their children. <br/>
<br/>
Then, as CBS News Correspondent Vince Gonzales reports, <br/>
county workers got an anonymous tip: better check on those <br/>
kids. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is one of those cases that will always haunt me,&quot; says <br/>
Tom Lock, the Johnston County district attorney. <br/>
<br/>
For weeks, the parents tried to keep social workers out until <br/>
the day detectives and Lock were called in. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was stunned at the squalor that I saw,&quot; says Lock. &quot;There <br/>
was rotting food, animal feces on the floor. I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
anyone living in a residence like this.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
A faded sign on the wall reads: &quot;So this isn&#39;t home sweet home: <br/>
adjust.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In the bedroom, 14-year-old Brandon had committed suicide <br/>
with a rifle after killing his brother Kyle and sister Marnie. Their <br/>
mother discovered the bodies. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;She stopped me in the road (and) said my children are dead,&quot; <br/>
says a neighbor. <br/>
<br/>
Nissa Warren told a detective she&#39;d &quot;rather God had them than <br/>
Child Protective Services.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It turned out the Warrens had home schooled before, in <br/>
Arizona, where they were convicted of child abuse. An <br/>
investigator there wrote: &quot;The children are tortured physically <br/>
and emotionally.&quot; That&#39;s information North Carolina school <br/>
officials are not required to collect. <br/>
<br/>
Since it became legal in North Carolina in 1985, the number <br/>
of home school students has jumped from just a few hundred <br/>
to more than 50,000. But there&#39;s been no change in the number <br/>
of state employees overseeing the program - just three for the <br/>
entire state. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think there&#39;s so little supervision that they really are not <br/>
protecting those kids,&quot; Marcia Herman-Giddens, of the North <br/>
Carolina Child Advocacy Institute. <br/>
<br/>
Herman-Giddens is on the state task force that reviewed the <br/>
Warren case. The conclusion: home school laws &quot;allow <br/>
persons who maltreat children to maintain social isolation <br/>
in order for the abuse and neglect to remain undetected.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;They deliberately keep them out of the public eye because the <br/>
children do have injuries that are visible, and they don&#39;t want <br/>
them to be seen,&quot; she says. <br/>
<br/>
But Hal Young, an advocate for home school parents, says <br/>
most parents are loving and doing a very good job. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t see a connection &quot;based on one very tragic <br/>
unfortunate case.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t see a connection that would say this is where the <br/>
government needs to step in, this is where the government <br/>
needs to come to your home, come into your life,&quot; says Young. <br/>
<br/>
The Warrens were acquitted of child abuse charges but spent <br/>
45 days in jail for failing to secure a firearm. Through their <br/>
attorney they declined requests for an interview. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;All they ever asked was that they be able to raise their children <br/>
in the manner in which they felt was appropriate,&quot; their attorney <br/>
Jonathan Breeden said. <br/>
