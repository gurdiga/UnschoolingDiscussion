 </span></blockquote>Hi Nancy,<br/>
I hope other folks speak to the tv and bedtime things, because I&#39;m going to <br/>
think about the food one for a minute.<br/>
I know where you&#39;re coming from.  IMHO, you have to handle your perception <br/>
of over-eating for yourself before you can handle it for your son... or <br/>
maybe the two of you can work on it together, if he&#39;s game.  I used to eat <br/>
as a form of comfort - still do, but less frequently find the need and not <br/>
to the extent I once did.  Bag of chips?  Used to be gone in 15 <br/>
minutes.  Nowadays, a bag of chips lasts days or weeks (and sometimes gets <br/>
thrown out because it&#39;s gone all stale!)<br/>
<br/>
First, you gotta love you.  I know, can the crap already.  We&#39;re going to <br/>
do a self check.  Who are you?  You are not your mother. (surprise, <br/>
surprise!)  You are not whatever idea your mother had inside her pretty <br/>
little 1950&#39;s era head. You are whatever YOU decide you are at that <br/>
particular moment in time and if you find yourself not being what you would <br/>
like to be, decide to be something else *for that ONE Particular Moment in <br/>
Time.*   Seriously, break your life down into tiny little fragments and <br/>
catch yourself being who you want to be.  Were you &#39;yourself&#39; for the past <br/>
2 minutes?  Hey, that&#39;s Great!  Now try for 3 minutes.  (seriously small <br/>
fragments of time!)  Get to really enjoy one specific thing about yourself <br/>
each day and concentrate on that one thing.  It can be your exquisite <br/>
little toe or the way you cross your t&#39;s, singing off-key in the most <br/>
atrocious manner.  Choose something you enjoy about yourself.  Be you and <br/>
recognize you.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so the underlying guilt and other assorted <br/>
not-meeting-up-to-mommy&#39;s-expectations complexes will take some time to get <br/>
through.  In the meantime, let&#39;s play with the food.  You&#39;re going to <br/>
deschool eating... or is it, defood?  C&#39;mon, defooding is FUN! (and tasty!)<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, there is no such thing as &#39;bad&#39; food. (Unless you&#39;re allergic, <br/>
perhaps.)  All food is good.  All food is good for you, if it fills a need <br/>
for you, and until you decide that it is not filling the need and something <br/>
else might fill it better... but you can&#39;t decide that yet, because you&#39;re <br/>
still seeing yourself being &#39;voracious&#39; about certain foods.  So, for now, <br/>
buy more of those foods so you will *never* run out of it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m serious.  If your body cries out for cookies, buy 10 bags of <br/>
cookies.  Bake cookies until they overflow from your counter, until you <br/>
have to step around the containers of cookies to make dinner - or have <br/>
cookies for dinner!  Make cakes with extra icing (excellent on spoons!) <br/>
Keep a HEAPING bowl of chocolate M&M&#39;s on the kitchen table.  Put them in <br/>
pretty bowls and cookie jars.  Eat them.  Enjoy them. Decorate with <br/>
them!  Revel in them!  Look at the guilt then toss it over your <br/>
shoulder!!!  There is NO guilt in eating what fills you.  There is NO such <br/>
thing as a &#39;bad&#39; food!  If you want a food, it should be available to <br/>
you!  (after all, would you limit your accessibility to books?  Of course <br/>
not!)  And be in the moment, as much as you can.  Don&#39;t think about the <br/>
&#39;next step&#39; or wonder how in the world you are eating this particular food, <br/>
just eat it, and enjoy it!  Smack your lips!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a whiz-banger!  If you are NOT enjoying the food you are eating, <br/>
STOP eating it, and figure out what you *would* enjoy!  A different <br/>
food?  Something else?  Just never, ever &#39;punish&#39; yourself when you are <br/>
eating, and especially not afterwards.  Food is Good.  Think Good, Tasty <br/>
Food, Tasty Chocolate, Tasty Cookies!  Good for You!  (and until you&#39;re <br/>
solid in enjoying and welcoming your food, NEVER eat with someone who beats <br/>
themselves up for eating.  Ever.  You are worth more than that!)<br/>
<br/>
Allow yourself to be filled by what calls to you.  When you have eaten what <br/>
you want, when you want, as much as you want for several weeks/months, <br/>
begin to pay closer attention to when you are full and to what kind of food <br/>
your body is asking for *at that moment*, but never limit yourself to <br/>
quantity or content.  All food is Good!  All I mean is that before taking <br/>
the next bite, ask, Do I crave this morsel?  If so, Eat it!  If not, put it <br/>
nearby, in case you change your mind and want it again.  Maybe you crave a <br/>
different morsel and should eat that!  You&#39;re de-fooding.  Everything is <br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
Eat the things you crave now, until you begin to crave something other than <br/>
cookies, cake and chocolate, say, some sweet grapes.  (You don&#39;t crave them <br/>
yet?  Then don&#39;t eat them!)  When you DO want the grapes (or whatever) go <br/>
out immediately and buy the most luscious grapes you can find - and then <br/>
buy some beautiful M&M&#39;s and cookies too!  Put them together on the same <br/>
kitchen counter, all displayed as nicely as can be.  When you are hungry, <br/>
stand for a moment and think, What Calls To Me Most?  If it is the cookies, <br/>
Eat them!  If it is the grapes, Eat them!  If it is the M&M&#39;s, Eat <br/>
them!  If it is some of each, Eat them!<br/>
<br/>
It may take days.  It may take weeks, months, or even years (if you&#39;re <br/>
stubborn about keeping the guilt thing, anyway) but one day you&#39;ll wake up <br/>
and you won&#39;t be interested in bingeing on your chocolates.  You&#39;ll <br/>
surprise yourself by throwing out old, stale candy - by even HAVING stale <br/>
candy!  (believe me, I was surprised the first time!)  You may never be the <br/>
biggest fruit-eater on the block, but who cares?  We can&#39;t ALL be the <br/>
biggest fruit eaters - there wouldn&#39;t be enough fruit!  Instead, you&#39;ll be <br/>
listening to your body and giving it what it needs and wants, <br/>
wholeheartedly and WITHOUT the blasted guilt thing pushing it in random <br/>
directions.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re working on is giving yourself a chance to really experience <br/>
what you&#39;ve always thought you shouldn&#39;t have but wanted, which will <br/>
someday allow you to see if it&#39;s *really* deep-down what truly calls to <br/>
you, and by that time, you&#39;ll be so bored by the cookies, cakes and <br/>
chocolates that they&#39;re just not interesting anymore.  Other foods will <br/>
become more interesting... or maybe even other activities.<br/>
<br/>
Really.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, broccoli and asparagus are some of my favorite foods.  I <br/>
frequently prefer to eat them rather than chocolate, although we keep cases <br/>
of chocolate in the house in case anyone ever wants some.  We&#39;re never <br/>
without, just as we&#39;re never without cheese and turkey lunchmeat... and <br/>
frequently we go days or weeks without touching them.<br/>
<br/>
Bon Appetit!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376016543">I hate to keep flogging the TV question. I am digesting everything I <br/>
have been reading since I joined this list. Trying to let go of <br/>
control is something I struggle with. I truly believe in letting my <br/>
children have free reign with the TV. I truly believe in giving them <br/>
the control over themselves, choices, and respect. <br/>
I have come to the conclusion that I am the onew with the problems, I <br/>
was strictly controlled as a child, very little tv, told how fat I <br/>
was,(funny, don&#39;t look fat in pictures, that is another story.)My <br/>
food intake was strictly controlled, grapefruit and eggs diet at the <br/>
age of 9, things like that. I hear the voices of my childhood <br/>
everytime the tv comes on, and I am the one who sits vacantly in <br/>
front of it when it is on, so there is much guilt. I am trying to rid <br/>
myself of that. But I think it has certainly affected the way I <br/>
parent.How do I let go off this for my children if I am still <br/>
punishing myself?? I enjoyed what Sandra wrote about the inner child <br/>
but am not sure how to implement that. Anyone else dealing with this? <br/>
And the eating thing is overwhelming. I am definitely a compulsive <br/>
overeater, and am not sure how to handle the free reign with food <br/>

Goodness this is getting long. Sorry about that. Last issue!<br/>
Bedtime. I was e-mailing with Sandra about this not long ago. I want <br/>
to let of controlling my son&#39;s bedtime. I don&#39;t know what is holding <br/>
me back. I seem to believe that I deserve the last hour or two of the <br/>
night to myself. My husband works afternoon shift all the time, so <br/>
evenings are just me and the kids. would it be less stressful for me <br/>
to just let it go rather than go thru the wholebed time routine? What <br/>
does that look like for other people? I get to the point where i am <br/>
so tired that I don&#39;t want anyone to talk to me, what do I do with <br/>
my  son then? this is not a vent. I really want to find out what <br/>
other people have experienced on this issue. I am trying to work for <br/>
changes in my mindset to better things for my children.<br/>

&gt;  I polished of 6 donuts the other day, because I was<br/>
&gt;alone and stressed out. So far my son shows no signs of this, but i am hoping<br/>
&gt;to deal with my stuff in order to avoid it for him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey Nancy,<br/>
I think I might just WANT to move in with you for a while, if you&#39;re going <br/>
to beat yourself up for eating a measly 6 donuts!  (and what kind were <br/>
they?  I *love* cake/baked donuts!)<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, you could maybe use somebody to keep reminding you to NOT live in <br/>
the past and think so negatively about what has already gone past!  The <br/>
past is Gone, gone, gone, gone. There are no do-overs with eating, so why <br/>
try to go back and relive it?!<br/>
<br/>
So you were stressed out and alone and you ate. So what!! (and good for <br/>
you, too!  You tried to take care of yourself, to make yourself feel <br/>
better!)  ...and it was maybe 15 minutes out of your life, eh?  15 minutes <br/>
out of your glorious, fabulous life when you were not being who you&#39;d like <br/>
to be?  ...and you&#39;ve chosen to remind yourself about those particular 15 <br/>
minutes.  When you can&#39;t change what happened and &#39;be perfect&#39;?  Is that <br/>
&#39;guilt&#39; *really* what you want to reinforce?  (*Grrrrrrr....* (mock growl))<br/>
<br/>
Please:<br/>
Reinforce the parts of your life when you&#39;re being the person you WANT to be.<br/>
Everything else is just practicing for those moments and can be dismissed <br/>
out of hand.<br/>
(and really, watch what you reinforce for yourself.  You *do* what you <br/>
reinforce for yourself.  ...do you really want to reinforce those icky, <br/>
guilty feelings when you eat?  Let It Go!)<br/>
<br/>
So, how were those donuts?  Tasty?  Yummy?  Mouthwatering?<br/>
Mmmmmmn, I can almost taste them!  Pass one over!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, yes, Nancy. Your childhood sounds very similar to mine, and I deal with <br/>
the same difficulties now. Have you heard of a book called &quot;Diets Don&#39;t <br/>
Work&quot;? I admit I haven&#39;t read it but a friend of mine loved it and it <br/>
sounds like it has some of the same ideas I have worked out for myself in <br/>
the past few years. I think it all comes down to not feeling worthy of <br/>
anything. Common but devastating.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I forget how old he is, but even a young child can understand that mommy is <br/>
tired and needs to rest at night. What I do is tell them that I am too <br/>
tired to do much of anything, and my ears are tired from all the talking <br/>
etc. We can do something quiet or they can do something on their own.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, last night I was more tired than usual. My husband doesn&#39;t <br/>
get home till 8 or later most nights. While he was eating supper the boys <br/>
and I (they are 10, 7 and 3) played charades. At 9:00 I had had it, the <br/>
noise especially bothers me. I said I was going up to my room and that if <br/>
anyone wanted to join me they could. Shortly after, Eric (7) came in bed <br/>
with me and went to sleep. Then Simon (3) came in, we read one book, then <br/>
turned out the light. William (10) was downstairs having a snack. He gets <br/>
to bed by himself when he is ready.<br/>

had the courage to see.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure how the proffessionals deal with it but (after seeing professionals for years and getting nowhere) I did the following to get rid of anorexia and depression (still working on the depression<br/>
but then I&#39;m a slow learner....)<br/>
Firtsly I stopped controlling food. I gave myself permission to eat what and when I liked. For the first month or so I ate nothing but choclate and cookies. My body craved those things I had been<br/>
denying myself. It was hard and I was afraid it would never stop and that I would turn into a whale. Gradually the craving changed to bananas. Basically, over the first 6 months it was weird, I craved<br/>
all sorts  of things. I also felt guilty (having a diet obsessed MIL doesn&#39;t help. I banned her from my life as a negative thing but thats a whole nother story - she thought anorexia was great cos it<br/>
made you thin!)<br/>
I also learned to appreciate that my body was the way it was. I took it for walks, strated bike-riding.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy letting go of all that guilt, control etc and for a while you might feel that it means you get out of control but gradually everything balances back. It could take a year or so before it<br/>
does which is why many people give up. They want an instant fix but years of controlling and years of a bad relationship with food doesn&#39;t disappear over-night unfortunately.<br/>
I also found a good councellor (sp?) helped. She talked me through the issues with my mother until I could say no to that internal voice of my mothers telling me I wasn&#39;t good enough, that nothing I did<br/>
was ever right.<br/>
<br/>
Well, hope that gave you some starting points. You&#39;ve done the first step which is in some ways the hardest. Now all you have to do is jump :-)<br/>

 <br/>
I also grew up in a similar family.   Not restricted with TV but with food.   I had been on many diets also by that age.  Didn&#39;t know there was anything but diet soda!  Sad, huh?<br/>
 <br/>
My advise:   very similar to Heidi&#39;s and Shyrley&#39;s.       Care for yourself and for sure,  stop Dieting!<br/>
 <br/>
I started noticing that when I dieted I gained weight.   I stopped drinking diet soda,  drank water and lost weight.  I started eating what I wanted and lost weight.     It all has to do with listening to your body,  like what Heidi was talking about.<br/>
 <br/>
I went through a Coke and chocolate phase,  seriously that&#39;s all I ate.  Not healthy and I&#39;m not saying you should do it,  but it was a discovery thing.   Growing up, I never was allowed dessert unless I ate everything,  surprise, surprise.     So, I was always wanting those desserts.        I had to figure out that it is only food,  not bad,  not good.   I can have it if I want it.    I think that&#39;s what took the fascination away,   I can have it if I want it.   Well,,,,,then I don&#39;t really want it.   Its not so magical then is it?<br/>
 <br/>
I still sometimes eat chocolate and sometimes eat too much,  but its my choice and I weigh less than I used to and I&#39;m much healthier.      I don&#39;t hear my Mom anymore saying,  &quot;ooohhh,  you shouldn&#39;t be eating that!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Kelli<br/>
 <br/>
Oh,  and I don&#39;t own a scale either!    I had to get over the whole number thing,  that was huge.   I&#39;m very large boned and tall,  so I was always trying to weigh alot less than what was healthy for me.   I&#39;m about  5&#39; 10&quot; and weigh around 160,  sometimes more, sometimes less.     Which is alot for some women,   but I know that I&#39;m fine and healthy!<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We used to have a bed time....and it was stressful.   My dh was gone alot when mine were younger so I know what you&#39;re going through.   I would lose it almost every night.<br/>
<br/>
    We now just try and read each other.   Figure out how we are all feeling.   Work together.<br/>
<br/>
  If I&#39;m tired I communicate with the kids that I&#39;m running out of steam.   We&#39;ll pop in  a movie or something low energy for me.   I can then rest my eyes and they slow down.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids are now  10, 8 and 5.   My 10 and 8 could go to bed on their own,  but they still like to be with me and my dh.  So I&#39;ll let them know that I&#39;m getting ready for bed,  ask them how they are doing.   Usually,  they are getting sleepy too and we all go to bed together,  between 9 and 10 p.m.,  I tend to get up early,  they sleep in.    This has been working quite well.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The part that has been huge for me in this scenerio is that they are only young for such a short time.   I used to get so wrapped up with how tired I was.   I now can talk myself through it.   Work through the tiredness.    I was never cuddled or babied at night, so I try and do that now with my kids.   <br/>
<br/>

Do you get breaks from your kids at other times of the day?   That&#39;s what helped with me.    I need to take some time for me,  reading, working at the computer,  whateever.   Then I can be there for them when they really need me,  and it seems to be more in the evening that they do need me.   I can then be patient, calm and end their day that way.    That nice feeling before going to bed,  instead of a sad, tense time.<br/>

People in Europe enjoy food but rates of walking and cycling are much much higher. It&#39;s like they live in their bodies while a lot of people here don&#39;t. They carry them round, don&#39;t do anything with<br/>
them and then agonise over food. Bodies like being fed and they like being used :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-455811809">I spent years struggling with food and weight issues and ended up getting a<br/>
degree in nutrition.  It was amusing to me that many of the people in the<br/>
nutrition department (student and faculty) were either very thin or quite<br/>
heavy.  My favorite &quot;heavy&quot; professor was in charge of the food sociology<br/>
classes.  She loved food and her classes were so enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the post about loading up on your forbidden foods and just<br/>
eating them as much as you want.  As long as you are denying yourself<br/>
certain foods they will continue to call to you.<br/>
<br/>
There are no foods that make you fat or thin.  I know skinny people who seem<br/>
to live on what most people would consider junk food and fat people who make<br/>
very &quot;healthy&quot; food choices.<br/>
<br/>
Another point to remember is that we are all born with body types.  Thin,<br/>
Chubby, Tall, Short, Muscular, Wiry.  They are all RIGHT.  Getting some kind<br/>
of exercise is probably the most important thing for a healthy body.   But<br/>
it needs to be exercise you enjoy and you need to do it because you like<br/>
doing it, not because it will make you look better.   If you listen to your<br/>
own body, it will be the body it needs and wants to be.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read this book in a while, but it was once one of my favorites:<br/>
How to Get Your Kid to Eat but Not Too Much, by Ellyn Satter.  I recommend<br/>
this book to any adult who has food issues.  Read it and think of yourself<br/>
as the kid while you are reading.<br/>

at the time. I only knew I wasn&#39;t thin. At the same time though, I <br/>
did have a very healthy diet growing up, we grew a lot of our own <br/>
produce and my mom belonged to a food co-op. For that aspect, I&#39;m <br/>
grateful. But I think most of our parents, particularly mothers, <br/>
were part of that 60&#39;s era thinking about women&#39;s bodies. I don&#39;t <br/>
remember a time when my mom wasn&#39;t dieting, and yet when you look at <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all, stop beating yourself up over it. Embrace what is <br/>
happening at this moment and give yourself the opportunity to accept <br/>
it. And I don&#39;t particularly think you caused this in your son. I <br/>
think humans are more or less programmed to crave sweet and fatty <br/>
foods. There was a time not too long ago in our biological heritage <br/>
when this trait served us well. It allowed our bodies to stock up in <br/>
times of plenty to prepare for times of famine. Of course, our <br/>
bodies were also working all day back then, so it didn&#39;t have the <br/>
associated health problems it does now. There are many paths to get <br/>
past this and get to a place where your body can recognize true <br/>
hunger and desire for food. Several posts have talked about ways to <br/>
let go and give yourself permission to find out what foods you are <br/>
really craving. I came at it from a different place, but it worked <br/>
well for me so I&#39;ll share it as well.<br/>
<br/>
I went through a lot of the same stuff others have - food control as <br/>
a child, thinking I was fat, anorexia, followed by overeating, <br/>
followed by control, etc. What helped me was to exercise. I found <br/>
that when I started making my body move - at first just gently a few <br/>
times a week, but then increasing over time - I somehow cued in to <br/>
my body&#39;s actual signals: when it is really tired, feeling good, <br/>
tense, relaxed, hungry, satiated, etc. As I exercised more, I also <br/>
lost the guilt over eating, because my body needed more fuel. At the <br/>
same time, I cued in to cravings for good foods to fuel it. I <br/>
realized that for my body, eating meat made me feel lethargic, so I <br/>
gave it up. I realized that whole grains and fruits and veggies made <br/>
it feel good. But I also allowed myself to eat things like chocolate <br/>
without the guilt. Surprisingly (to me), I have eaten less and less <br/>
of it over time. I&#39;ve also found out what amount makes me still feel <br/>
fine, and what amount makes me feel miserable. In our house, we <br/>
always have a variety of foods, including some chocolate at all <br/>
times! In that book I talked about earlier, it mentioned that <br/>
chocolate (particularly cocoa or dark chocolate) is higher in <br/>
antioxidants than any fruit or veggie. No wonder we crave it! The <br/>
woman who was the oldest living person in the world for some time, <br/>
she died at 124 I think, said she ate chocolate and drank some wine <br/>
every day. Sounds like a good plan to me :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; does that look like for other people? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For us, I help the kids get their teeth brushed and into pajamas and <br/>
such, then I will read them some books and from a chapter book. <br/>
Sometimes my daughter falls asleep while I&#39;m reading the chapter <br/>
book. If not, my son often goes off to play while I&#39;m spending some <br/>
snuggle time with her. Or he might go cuddle or wrestle or read with <br/>
DH. Or, on a night he&#39;s feeling tired and my daughter isn&#39;t, she <br/>
might head off and I&#39;ll cuddle with him. Both of the kids really <br/>
look forward to their individual snuggle time with me where we talk <br/>
about our day and just hang out together. Sometimes they&#39;re both <br/>
tired and we all snuggle up together. Sometimes one will fall asleep <br/>
watching a movie or whatever. The nice thing is that they&#39;re each <br/>
cued in to their own bodies, so they recognize when they&#39;re getting <br/>
tired and when they&#39;re not. They will come to me and tell me when <br/>
they&#39;re sleepy, and they&#39;ll let me know if they&#39;re not and they want <br/>
to play or do something else. Regardless, the whole scenario usually <br/>
takes less than an hour, since it&#39;s begun when they know they&#39;re <br/>
starting to get sleepy. It&#39;s much less time than people I know go <br/>
through who put their kids to bed at arbitrary times and then have <br/>
to keep getting glasses of water and putting the kids back into bed <br/>
and getting more and more frustrated all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Chances are, it might take awhile for your son to learn his own <br/>
sleepy cues. At first, if you take away bedtime, he&#39;ll go through a <br/>
learning curve where he stays up, gets overtired, or goes to bed too <br/>
early and isn&#39;t tired yet. He&#39;ll learn through trial and error what <br/>
it feels like to hear his body&#39;s signals that he&#39;s tired. A lot of <br/>
us didn&#39;t go through that until we were in college. Eventually, <br/>
he&#39;ll figure out what works for him. In the meantime, get a stack of <br/>
good books for yourself (the time I&#39;m snuggled with my kids while <br/>
they&#39;re drifting off is always bonus reading time for me!) and that <br/>
way you won&#39;t be tempted to view it as &quot;wasted time&quot;. You might find <br/>
a good way that the two of you can come to closure on the day. When <br/>
we climb into bed, I always talk about our day with each of the <br/>
kids. It gives them an opportunity to tell me about whatever they <br/>
want to, and has opened up some very interesting revelations and <br/>
conversations. After that, I usually sing to them, and then I read <br/>
my book as they drift off. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I get to the point where i am <br/>
&gt; so tired that I don&#39;t want anyone to talk to me, what do I do with <br/>
&gt; my  son then? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just tell him that it&#39;s quiet time for you, but you&#39;re still willing <br/>
to be with him. Learn to recognize when you&#39;re approaching that <br/>
point, and offer to do any reading/talking/singing before that <br/>
point. I always read the bedtime stories before I start getting <br/>
really tired, and then after that I&#39;m done reading out loud or I <br/>
tend to doze off in the middle of stories. After that, the kids can <br/>
get up and play on their own or together, or they can lie down and <br/>
snuggle, but they know I&#39;m personally done being a part of any <br/>
action.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other people have experienced on this issue. I am trying to work <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; changes in my mindset to better things for my children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just keep in mind it will be a process, not an immediate change. <br/>
Maybe talk to your son about what he&#39;d like to do for bedtime and <br/>
find something that will work for both of you. He&#39;ll eventually <br/>
learn to know when he&#39;s tired.<br/>

had babies, didn&#39;t lose weight, coming to look like my granny, who lost <br/>
weight again when she was older, 205...<br/>
<br/>
So I never gained weight until I was way grown.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has so far been truly slim and we say things to indicate that <br/>
might not always be so.  Not in scary way or threatening way or ominous way, <br/>
but reminding people that bodies change and there&#39;s no sense getting attached <br/>
to one&#39;s appearance or hair color (or hair &lt;g&gt;), just kinda casual reminders. <br/>
  &quot;If you&#39;re still skinny when you&#39;re grown...&quot;  not &quot;Holly is [and always <br/>
will be defined as] thin.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby have gone back and forth between pudgy and newly-tall.  Kirby <br/>
has a little belly on him.  Marty at the moment doesn&#39;t, but has kinda <br/>
love-handle waist.  And Marty has stretch marks from some period when he <br/>
pudged out quickly.  I have no idea how they will settle out.  But I *DO* <br/>
know that my husband, at their age, was fat like a big football player kind <br/>
of size, hiked and marched and played football and heard his mother rag on <br/>
sneaking food.  Keith did.<br/>
Kirby&#39;s not ragged on for not being skinny.<br/>
Marty isn&#39;t either.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the best I know how to do.  If they don&#39;t grow up buff-boys and want to <br/>
blame me, they can.  But they won&#39;t be binging and sneaking to get as many <br/>
hamburgers and french fries as they can before they&#39;re caught.  They won&#39;t be <br/>
eating quarts of ice cream alone in secret, because it has to be finished to <br/>
destroy the evidence.<br/>

&gt; really anywhere.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like many things, it can be awful or great, depending on where you <br/>
live and your life choices. Where we lived in the Seattle area was <br/>
terrible for bicycling. I biked to work at Microsoft, but always felt <br/>
I was taking my life in my own hands. Bike lanes were few, and the <br/>
ones that existed didn&#39;t connect to anything. Drivers were rude <br/>
and/or dangerous. Once I had kids, I knew it was not safe to bike <br/>
with them on the roads. We put at least 40 miles a day on our car, <br/>
just getting around town, to playdates, park, library, and shopping. <br/>
To me, this lifestyle just seemed terrible (I know it is not to many, <br/>
but it drove me nuts). So, we moved! Took a massive cut in income, <br/>
but moved someplace that has great support for biking. The first year <br/>
we moved here, we put over 10,000 *fewer* miles on our car, which I <br/>
worked out to be about 250 hours, or about 11 days less we spend in <br/>
the car, per year. To me, that makes it worth it. We have eleven more <br/>
days to spend doing things we like! Almost nothing here is more than <br/>
5 miles away from us - library is 2, store is 1/4 mile, farthest <br/>
friend is 3.5 - it&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
Above all, if biking is important to people, they can get involved in <br/>
making it more accessible. We took the route of moving to a bike <br/>
friendly community, but the transformation that happened here can <br/>
happen elsewhere as well. I love the fact that every day of the year, <br/>
I&#39;m never the only bicyclist on the road here. Even in the pouring <br/>
rain, there&#39;s plenty of crazy two-wheelers about.<br/>

the whole concept, but I still struggle with only eating when I am hungry. I <br/>
refuse to diet though~~<br/>

alone and stressed out. So far my son shows no signs of this, but i am hoping <br/>
to deal with my stuff in order to avoid it for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934974196">Who says you should only eat when you are hungry?<br/>
<br/>
Eat when it sounds and feels good to you to eat.  Stop when you don&#39;t want<br/>
to anymore.  When you are satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, how would you define hungry?  A little bit hungry?  Starving?<br/>
<br/>
Food and eating are not just for survival.  They are also for pleasure and<br/>
for socializing.  We certainly don&#39;t have sex only we want to have a child!<br/>

Thanks again for the kind words. You know it&#39;s funny how I treat myself so <br/>
harshly, and  would never do that to a friend. I like your way of describing <br/>
how to reinforce the good and leave the rest behind. I will save this one.<br/>
You might find it a little chilly to move up here, got an inch of snow <br/>
yesterday! But you are welcome.<br/>
