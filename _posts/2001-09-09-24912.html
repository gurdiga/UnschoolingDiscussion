<div id="ygrps-yiv-470442450">NewI beg to differ.  It is indeed unschooling.  There is no curriculum and<br/>
they select what to do and when as long as it meets my basic standards of<br/>
HOW MUCH.  For example, they have to write (physically) a certain amount<br/>
each week.  They choose what and when.  If they want to write jokes or a<br/>
term paper it&#39;s fine by me as long as they write something.  These<br/>
&#39;rules&#39; have come about because THEY asked for it.<br/>
<br/>
If they wanted the &quot;rules&quot; and later decide not to comply with &quot;rules&quot; that<br/>
THEY asked for, why are there consequences to that?  Maybe they feel that<br/>
they don&#39;t need the rules?  Maybe what prompted setting the rules isn&#39;t<br/>
important to them anymore?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter tells me constantly that she has &quot;rules&quot; for her candy treats<br/>
(those she gets from parties, halloween, Christmas stocking, trip to the<br/>
store, etc) like &quot;I&#39;m only going to eat one piece a day until my birthday,<br/>
&#39;cause then I&#39;ll get more.&quot;  I don&#39;t feel a need to impose a consequence if<br/>
she suddenly decides to eat the whole lot of it.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that your kids are older and want to set some educational goals<br/>
for themselves.  But their motivation has to come from within to achieve<br/>
those, not from rules they set for themselves that are enforced by<br/>
consequences from you.<br/>
<br/>
Having them meet &quot;your basic standards&quot; in their learning is not what is<br/>
meant by the term unschooling.  You sound like a very relaxed homeschooler<br/>
and a good parent.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people on this list carry the unschooling concept over into<br/>
parenting, whereas others are totally unschooling in the learning department<br/>
but have other family standards (set bedtimes, mealtimes, chore lists,<br/>
consequences for family rules being broken, etc.).  Those for whom<br/>
unschooling is also their total lifestyle are NOT by any means &quot;unparenting&quot;<br/>
or letting their kids run wild to squish bread, trample the neighbors<br/>
flowerbeds, etc.  The line between unschooling and parenting is kind of<br/>
fuzzy.<br/>
