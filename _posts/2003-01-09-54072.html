<div id="ygrps-yiv-57805090">&lt;&lt;And if the answer is no then you are back to your dilemma of doing it all<br/>
by your lonesome&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, that&#39;s not true, because the answer isn&#39;t ALWAYS no and often the kids<br/>
then pitch in without me asking them.  Example:  This morning I asked Zach<br/>
to find the dirty clothes in his room and take them to the laundry.  He<br/>
said, &quot;No, I&#39;m thirsty right now&quot; and went into the kitchen for a drink.<br/>
Later, he cleaned his entire room and brought all the dirty clothes to the<br/>
laundry.  Yesterday, I was shaving goats for the upcoming goat show out<br/>
back.  When I came in, Adriane had cleaned up all the lunch dishes without<br/>
anyone asking her at all.<br/>
<br/>
There is an entire continuum of living between doing &quot;forcing the kids to<br/>
help&quot; (meaning help when, where and how I tell you) and &quot;doing it all by<br/>
your lonesome&quot;.<br/>
