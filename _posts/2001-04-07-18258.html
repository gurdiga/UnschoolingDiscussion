&lt;&lt; Personally I never wanted my child to be fearful so I never mentioned any<br/>
of the &quot;stranger danger&quot; or &quot;good touch, bad touch&quot; stuff.  I simply made<br/>
sure it was not a possibility.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t use those slogans, but I&#39;ve said if they ever feel uncomfortable <br/>
with or around ANY other person (not just adult, not just older) to talk to <br/>
me, and it was always okay to say &quot;no&quot; to anybody who was bugging them.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly was molested (finger insertion) by a six year old boy when she was one. <br/>
 The other boy tried to get Marty (who was four) involved, but Marty talked <br/>
to me.  It turned out the six year old had been have penis play with lots of <br/>
the other boys in our babysitting co-op and had wanted to play with some of <br/>
the girls but they had balked at it.   He had been exposed to such play by <br/>
(possibly among others) a slightly-older neighbor.  <br/>
<br/>
We had been warned vaguely by the mom to have him keep his pants on.  She <br/>
didn&#39;t say everyone else had to keep theirs on too--it was summer, playing in <br/>
little wading pools and wet sandboxes and in mud were common with that gang.<br/>
<br/>
These weren&#39;t adults or even teens.<br/>
<br/>
I have calmly and happily talked to kids about remaining happy, and about not <br/>
playing with each others&#39; penises, without describing any horrors.  Holly is <br/>
very assertive.  The talks with her have been more along the lines of <br/>
questioning whether various friends (in particular, not a sweep) are nice to <br/>
her, whether she trusts them or thinks they&#39;re nice.  Because of older <br/>
brothers, there are lots of older boys around, and it&#39;s worth consciously <br/>
keeping communication actively open with her because of that.  <br/>
<br/>
This probably sounds totally la-la and wimpy to any of you who have <br/>
experienced REAL bigtime sexual abuse yourself, or in cases of your kids.  <br/>
I&#39;m sorry to be that way.  I think somewhere between saying nothing and <br/>
saying enough to ruin their peace is &quot;the right&quot; thing to say.  We all will <br/>
guess wrong by a little bit, I figure, but I also think we cannot guarantee <br/>
that they will be safe from opportunity for abuse.  <br/>
<br/>
Uncles.<br/>
Grandfathers.<br/>
One-year-older female cousins.<br/>
<br/>
Those were the abusers of the women closest to me.  One was a sister-in-law.  <br/>
One was my sister.  <br/>
<br/>
 I just lucked out, or I was verbal and intimidating, or both.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865991227">i&#39;ve tried to help my kids to trust their instincts.  we don&#39;t talk about<br/>
good touches vs bad touches.  WE do talk about appropriate and<br/>
inapprpriate behaviors of all kinds and how some are moer or less<br/>
appropriate in given circumstances (like what the college students were<br/>
doing necking in the foyer of my office building is appropriate in a<br/>
different place).  We also try to have a wide web of people we designate<br/>
as &quot;safe&quot; people...that is people we can trust to keep our children&#39;s best<br/>
interest in mind if the need ever arose and to whom my kids could turn if<br/>
they felt threatened in any way.  For example, there is a smallish flea<br/>
market here in town run by friends of ours (although since their children<br/>
are much younger than mine, my kids haven&#39;t spent much time with them and<br/>
don&#39;t really know them well and probably would be quite quiet with them,<br/>
unlike the parents of my kds&#39; friends)...anyway, my boyz were wandering<br/>
around the flea market w/o me, with a couple of friends.  Looking, not<br/>
touching...they were about 100 feet away from me, and while i could se<br/>
them, they couldn&#39;t see me.  They came across a booth that was selling<br/>
guns.  Because they didn&#39;t know immediately wehre i was and they felt<br/>
threatened by the guns, they wentt to the kitchen where our friend&#39;s wife<br/>
was serving food to chek with her if the guns were safe and to ask for<br/>
help finding me.  I want to give them the autonomy to go off on their own,<br/>
but also the skills to maintain a level of comfort and safety.  They are<br/>
quite discerning, too, when it comes to people...and avoid some of the<br/>
people that other kids find &quot;OK&quot;--rather trecely (is that how that is<br/>
spelled) people and maintain their distance.  I don&#39;t want them to think<br/>
that there are people out htere waiting to snatch them or harm them, but I<br/>
also want them to grow to be aware because I can&#39;t be withthem all the<br/>
time.<br/>

to stop doing anything they don&#39;t like.  I consider it just common sense<br/>
and a counter measure to the message they are bound to hear of &quot;obey<br/>
adults&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I let them know that I will happily deal with anyone who objects to their<br/>
&quot;No&quot; and they will NOT be &quot;in trouble&quot;.  Being able to say &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;no&quot;<br/>
is vital in ALL interaction with others.<br/>

It has been hard to come to grips with this, I&#39;m sure it is for most<br/>
parents.  Our efforts are sure to fall short in one area or another and<br/>
even with our best it could happen.  I have even worried that my<br/>
protective efforts would cause emotional harm.  Since the vast majority<br/>
of my fears have not been realized I&#39;m determined to relax and get some<br/>
joy out this ride.<br/>
