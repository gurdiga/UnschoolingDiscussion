<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349161778">Hey Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
In response to your query &quot;As there&#39;s nothing in the radical<br/>
unschooling-extended-to-parenting that&#39;s anything LIKE &quot;do what I say,&quot; then<br/>
what do you see would be a benefit of<br/>
radical unschoolers studying TCS closer?  If we&#39;re already living it, why<br/>
read  rhetoric and theory?&quot;  Honestly, I say none at all.  Unless of course<br/>
you are an information hound and just love the intellectual banter that the<br/>
discussion of theories takes on.  Like I said in my earlier email, I have<br/>
raised my three kids with TCS tenets, although never knew there was a theory<br/>
or a label for my approach.  I can also say that I was thrilled to discover<br/>
the simple tenets of TCS because it allowed me to describe to others what my<br/>
parenting approach was in a nutshell, and I had been unable to articulate it<br/>
so simply before.  Aside from that, I too find (as a few other posts have<br/>
mentioned) the TCS discussion lists cumbersome and much too bogged down with<br/>
semantics.<br/>
