<div id="ygrps-yiv-746314023">Okay, this is not written in judgement of those of you that do this, but I<br/>
have to ask:  WHY do you need to kill the slugs?  We have several of them in<br/>
our yard (and in our past yards) and have lovely plants...no disease or<br/>
death.  We have always cherished them as another form of life here on Earth.<br/>
We enjoy watching them and have taken several close-up pictures of them.<br/>
They are truly beautiful creatures...amazing to watch.  We&#39;ve always just<br/>
let them live and plan on doing so in the future.  I&#39;m just curious as to<br/>
why you kill them?  What harm do they do to your plants?  I&#39;ve heard about<br/>
them hurting plants, but have never witnessed them actually hurting anything<br/>
and have never noticed any plant rot, disease, or anything else negative<br/>
from them.  Please share.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154258849">Well, up here in the Redwoods some of the slugs get as big as trucks &lt;g&gt; and<br/>
even the small slugs and snails will mow down a whole garden in a matter of<br/>
one or two nights (veggies and flower starts).<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you have livestock, they carry some nasty diseases which can be<br/>
deadly, liver flukes being one.<br/>
