<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539393432">Thanks Sandra, for yet another great link. I&#39;m glad you post those whenever needed, <br/>
because I tried to read your website and kept getting side tracked by links. :-)<br/>
<br/>
And now I was just side tracked by someone interested in Hawaiin jewelry and Mississippi. <br/>
Darn the luck, I forgot where I was going with this post....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, pieces really do scatter! I really don&#39;t blame the kids doing it, Sam is four, Dan is <br/>
two, and they just want to help. However, both of them are VERY active, with little impulse <br/>
control and lots of energy LOL! I just didn&#39;t want to squelch and didn&#39;t know what to say. <br/>
SO it seems that we&#39;ve just put puzzles away and haven&#39;t gotten them out. <br/>
<br/>
Ah...I was going to say something about self-regulation (I saw it in the link). Having a child <br/>
with a regulation disability, I thought if you were still interested I could share about self-<br/>
regulation in medical cases. :-) Self-regulation refers to the body&#39;s ability to sense needs <br/>
and, for the most part, address them automatically. So if you&#39;re getting dehydrated, you <br/>
start to crave water, if your blood sugar drops, you feel hungry, if your internal temp gets <br/>
too high, you start to sweat. Consciously, self-regulation consists of the choices that we <br/>
make when we feel hunger, thirst, sleepiness, hot, cold, whatever. In regards to tv, <br/>
reading, games, play, and learning that mentioned here, I would say that SR is just another <br/>
way to address the brains needs. Need stimulation, you choose what to stim it with. <br/>
Studies have shown that some people have a higher need for adrenaline, some people <br/>
have lesser, for example, which is how they explain people who have serious thrill issues <br/>
(ha...we&#39;ve been watching a lot of Nemo lately)<br/>
<br/>
Part of Breanna&#39;s autism is a self-regulation dysfunction. Her brain kind of short circuits, <br/>
and either she a) can&#39;t find what she needs for regulation or b) she gets stuck in a self-reg <br/>
that she no longer wants, but can&#39;t stop. I&#39;m sure those of you without exp in the autism <br/>
world have still seen those in TV or movies. One obvious example is the rocking, etc. It <br/>
serves a purpose for a while, stimulating and regulating the brain, but begins to interfere <br/>
with walking, eating and sleeping. Sometimes the rocking happens because she needs <br/>
something, but can&#39;t find a way to address that need. In her case, we&#39;ve spent a long time <br/>
increasing her toolbox, so to speak, so she has more ways to address her needs, and <br/>
decreasing her stress so she can practice alternative stimulations.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hth, and isn&#39;t out of place.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for the principal link. I need to internalize that.<br/>

Jigsaw puzzles and toddlers don&#39;t mix, but there are some great floor  <br/>
puzzles for little kids!  And some good 16 or 20 piece puzzles, and  <br/>
tray puzzles.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were babies we did no adult-type jigsaw puzzles.  I only  <br/>
sewed for a few hours at night sometimes and then put all the pins  <br/>
and needles and scissors and seam rippers up high.<br/>
<br/>
We just made the house kid-safe and kid-friendly, and then we didn&#39;t  <br/>
need to have so many rules!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the bit about self-regulation.  When most people say &quot;I  <br/>
want my kids to self-regulate&quot; I think they  mean &quot;I want my kids to  <br/>
make some rules and schedules up and then follow them.&quot;  Instead of  <br/>
drinking when they&#39;re thirsty, they might rather have kids who drink  <br/>
eight ounces (measured) of water five times a day (by the clock).   <br/>
What you wrote was really helpful.<br/>

P.S.  Principals are the bosses of American public schools, and  <br/>
sometimes the primary or singular something or someone.  Lead actors  <br/>
in plays are principal actors.<br/>
<br/>
Those ideas and truths on which we base actions are principles with a  <br/>
&quot;ple&quot; ending.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not basing my actions on principals anymore.&lt;g&gt;  Just principles.</div>
