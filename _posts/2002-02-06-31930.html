<div id="ygrps-yiv-43132961">Dear List,<br/>
  I&#39;ve mentioned to you a time or two about my daughter who is 8 but<br/>
doesn&#39;t read yet.  Her 6 year old sister is beginning to read.  Well, I<br/>
got some insight into the situation and thought I&#39;d share it with  you.<br/>
<br/>
  A few weeks ago Danae, the 6 year old, was reading aloud to me in our<br/>
living room.  My dh and Kaitlin, the 8 year old, were having a snack at<br/>
the kitchen table, which is basically in the same room and they could<br/>
hear too.  I overheard Kaitlin tell my dh, &quot; I don&#39;t want to sound like<br/>
that!!  It sounds terrible!&quot;  Danae sounds out most of the words, which<br/>
isn&#39;t  smooth, fluent, reading and Kaitlin doesn&#39;t like how it sounds. <br/>
Thats a big reason why she doesn&#39;t read, I think.  It doesn&#39;t bother<br/>
Danae to sound like that, though.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m still running under the assumption that Kaitlin will get there when<br/>
she&#39;s ready, like she has with everything else.  My best guess is that<br/>
she&#39;ll put it all together in her head and just &quot;suddenly&quot; be reading. <br/>
Hearing her comments was actually rather encouraging since she doesn&#39;t<br/>
really talk about what she thinks much. <br/>
<br/>
  Just wanted to share.  Djuana</div>

I&#39;m not saying that your dd soes!), but my dd seems to want to be able to do<br/>
it right with no mistakes,  rather than toddle along,  making fewer mistakes<br/>
each time.  I have also wondered whether that is part of why she&#39;s hesitant.<br/>
    Of course,  I wonder if the perfactionist thing comes genetically or<br/>
have we (parents) somehow unwittingly instilled it?<br/>
    My oldest dd did not ride her bike w/out traing wheels until she was<br/>
8-1/2.  She just did it one day,  when she was mentally ready. My own<br/>
attitudes neede growth then,  my efforts were a bit on the teaching side,<br/>
or at least the &#39;helping&#39; side.  She&#39;s a &#39;hands off&#39;  type,  I&#39;ve come to<br/>
realize.....I just need to notice,  and be there for questions when she<br/>
asks.  I have tols her that I&#39;ve read that many children do the same thing<br/>
with reading and that she may just find one day that she can &#39;do it&#39;  when<br/>
she makes up her mind.   I am finally able to say that to her with no agenda<br/>
or expectaion of my own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600256997">That would be son #3.  He absolutely has to be able to things *instantly*<br/>
and perfectly.  So he has done just about everything there is in sports,<br/>
he&#39;s a &quot;natural.&quot;  And math and science he simply understands right out the<br/>
gate.  Little, few or no explanations needed, they are just something that<br/>
he &quot;gets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He hates reading.  He couldn&#39;t learn it instantly and has never liked it<br/>
since.  I mean, he reads but he doesn&#39;t enjoy reading the way the rest of us<br/>
do.  But I wouldn&#39;t say he was hesitant to learn so much as he simply<br/>
refused to do it because he couldn&#39;t do it perfectly.  When he did learn, it<br/>
was relatively overnight but it was because he needed the ability and he<br/>
gritted his teeth and moaned and groaned because he couldn&#39;t do it perfectly<br/>
from the get go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-156866313">It&#39;s amazing how when we just listen we can learn so much about a child&#39;s<br/>
perspective.  I found out by listening to my seven year old dd talk to<br/>
her brother that she hated math flash cards when she was in school.  I<br/>
had dropped them because she had showed no interest when I showed them to<br/>
her.  We play a game with dice now, which is how I found out she gets<br/>
add, plus, subtract and minus mixed up.  No wonder she wasn&#39;t memorizing<br/>
math facts in school!  Now if she wants to play addition and subtraction<br/>
with dice, she asks me, and we quit when she&#39;s ready.  Unschooling is<br/>
awesome, I love it!  <br/>
