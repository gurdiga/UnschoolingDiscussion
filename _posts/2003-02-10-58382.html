 </span></blockquote>I have storage for all the stuff; places where it&#39;s supposed to live.  You<br/>
need that first.  Plastic boxes, shelves, whatever, so that stuff doen&#39;t<br/>
*have* to live on the table.<br/>
<br/>
But my problem will be solved when we move to a real house with enough<br/>
space.  In my apartment, I have three tables.  One of them (the smallest)<br/>
usually has a chess board set up on it, and the other (living room) is<br/>
completely burried in an ever-changing assortment of books, magazines,<br/>
newspaper, etc.  So projects take over the kitchen table, and aren&#39;t always<br/>
done at meal time.  If it&#39;s a &quot;little meal&quot;, it moves.  If it&#39;s a big meal<br/>
with all three of us home or guests, I shuffle the projects somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe people who require math workbooks every day don&#39;t do projects that<br/>
take over their kitchen table....not enough time to do fun stuff or<br/>
something.  I dunno.<br/>

Hey, Kelly!  Can we have a sewing-machines-for-terrified-people session at<br/>
the unschooling conference and Sandra can teach us how to thread machines<br/>
and work bobbins? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
NO!<br/>
<br/>
I only know those I&#39;ve had for a while.  <br/>
Spatial reasoning is not one of my strengths.  I have to learn one machine by <br/>
rote, by muscle memory, and then I know that one. <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not afraid of the instruction booklets, and I understand how machines <br/>
work in theory.<br/>
<br/>
There might be others there who are braver, but let&#39;s don&#39;t fill up an <br/>
unschooling weekend with sewing machines, since every fabric store in the <br/>
world has people who can help with sewing machines.<br/>

NO!<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to say, let&#39;s not get over-dependent on Sandra.  There&#39;s an<br/>
incredible collective wisdom in the minds and hearts of all the parents<br/>
(and children) attending the conference.  You could probably have a good<br/>
seminar on any topic under the sun.<br/>
<br/>
And even if there is NO &quot;expertise&quot; on a particular subject, there could<br/>
still be self-directed, group-supported exploration.<br/>
<br/>
Not meaning to sound preachy, but if we lift Sandra up on the highest of<br/>
pedestals then it makes everyone else look short or deficient.  That<br/>
isn&#39;t a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
I really do mean this in the friendliest possible way.  An unschooling<br/>
conference is not one &quot;teacher&quot; in a classroom full of &quot;children&quot;.<br/>
