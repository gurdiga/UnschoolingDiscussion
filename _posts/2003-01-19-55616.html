son can eat a ton of candy, a fraction of which would make me sick, without<br/>
a moment of uncomfortableness. I would believe a parent who says their kid<br/>
is affected by sugar and I would believe a parent who says their kid is<br/>
totally unaffected by sugar. Caffeine has little affect on some, a large<br/>
affect on others. Ritalin works on some, not on others. Etc.<br/>
