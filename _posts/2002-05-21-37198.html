<div id="ygrps-yiv-914934859">OK we&#39;ll be unschooling starting this fall, when I&#39;ll be finally a<br/>
s/wahm mom again after years of school and work.  My son is 8 and<br/>
while he is a natural learner and thinker he gets &quot;bored&quot; easily unless<br/>
1) someone is completely immersed in play with him that he REALLY<br/>
likes--like legos or pokemon card game <br/>
2) he&#39;s on the computer (which I want to limit, and do so)or watching<br/>
TV which we don&#39;t have<br/>
3) he&#39;s playing with friends.<br/>
4) he&#39;s outside.<br/>
<br/>
Now I always accepted this behavior b/c I was very attachment oriented<br/>
esp. in the first few yrs when he was nursing, co-sleeping, etc.  It<br/>
didn&#39;t matter that he was constantly needing me to distract him b/c<br/>
after all that was normal.  Now tho he rarely plays alone, spends<br/>
little time in his room (which has ALL kinds of science stuff, board<br/>
games, hundreds of books, several cool educational electronic gadgets,<br/>
lego, playmobil, and tinkertoy &quot;worlds&quot;,etc.).  Maybe this won&#39;t be an<br/>
issue when we start u-s; perhaps he lacks that kind of drive b/c of<br/>
being in school but it has always seemed to be a part of his<br/>
personality.  He&#39;s not clingy, rather very very active, and exciting<br/>
to be with, but just not likely to &quot;get into something&quot; on his own.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have a new baby after all these years within 2 months of<br/>
beginning u-s and am just trying to find hope that he and I won&#39;t be<br/>
miserable in the postpartum period where I&#39;m not up and going enough<br/>
to get the baby in the sling and just go on the type of<br/>
nature/expedition type advantures we would really both enjoy more than<br/>
being in the house, and which I plan to use for science, ecology,<br/>
physics, math, etc. etc.  Also I&#39;ll be analyzing data from a huge<br/>
research project on attachment parenting in N. America I&#39;ve been doing<br/>
for the last couple of years, and which has to have work done on it so<br/>
I can get more grants to stay home longer than a year.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas?  Words of encouragement or honesty from similarly-situated<br/>
parents of &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; kids?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
Do you take out the &quot;science stuff, board games, hundreds of books, several<br/>
cool educational electronic gadgets, lego, playmobil, and tinkertoy<br/>
&quot;worlds&quot;,etc.&quot; to do on your own? If not, is it reasonable to expect him to?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is much like that. Most of the enjoyment comes not from the<br/>
things but from sharing it with someone else. (I suspect that&#39;s why you can<br/>
often find unopened kids at garage sales. Not purely because school has<br/>
sucked any enjoyment out of anything that looks educational, or because they<br/>
lack the imagination to play with them but because they don&#39;t have a parent<br/>
to share the adventure and discovery with.)<br/>
<br/>
If you loved spending time doing things with your husband what would your<br/>
thoughts towards him be if he were hoping you could learn to do things on<br/>
your own?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oops, forgot that part.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you want to limit it?<br/>
<br/>
If he were as involved with Legos or books as much as he is with computers<br/>
(or would be with TV), would you limit those?<br/>
<br/>
Even if you thought he needed some variety in his life, would you limit the<br/>
books and Legos to so many hours per day or would you offer something<br/>
better?<br/>
<br/>
Why is it good and brings a smile to most parents&#39; faces if a child is<br/>
totally engrossed in Legos or a book but bad and a source of frustration<br/>
when they&#39;re equally engrossed in a computer program?<br/>

Try not to &quot;use&quot; things for science, physics, etc.  Try to learn to be, and <br/>
to see learning in all kinds of things.  Even if you never ever go on an <br/>
expedition, those topics apply to things in the home too.<br/>
<br/>
If he needs input, and if you limit computer and TV to try to make boring <br/>

situation severely and unnecessarily.<br/>
<br/>
If you let him have at the computer and TV all he wants to, you can spend <br/>
more happy hours with the baby, he can spend more happy hours getting input <br/>
(even  very useful science, ecology, physics, math, etc. etc.), and you can, <br/>
if you want to, worry less about how he will be amused (and intrigued, and <br/>
mesmerized, and excited, and emotionally touched).<br/>

Well, look, I&#39;m all about spending lots of time with my son...I hardly<br/>
think I&#39;d be gung-ho about home/unschooling if not!  That&#39;s really not<br/>
the point, tho I understand there are lots of people who have those<br/>
feelings.  I&#39;m not one of them--I&#39;m excited by being with my son and<br/>
most of the time we get along great bouncing ideas off each other and<br/>
going on adventures, real and imagined.  But I&#39;ve read (and seen in my<br/>
own life) kids who were more likely to get engrossed in projects on<br/>
their own, or even *somewhat* on their own.  And I know my son is on<br/>
the far end of the spectrum, which as you mentioned is likely to be a<br/>
part of his personality (a good one in my mind--being attached to<br/>
people is much better than to things!)  What I am looking for is not a<br/>
scolding about &quot;how would I feel if...&quot; b/c i know I&#39;m being a great<br/>
mom already...I just want to know HOW other parents of similar kids<br/>
made the transition to self-directed learning...how the first few<br/>
months of unschooling went if so...as I said we don&#39;t have a TV and it<br/>
is important to me to limit video/computer usage, so I can&#39;t just &quot;let<br/>
him get sick of vegging out&quot;...but I also don&#39;t want to become<br/>
frustrated by the constant &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; like a mantra, particularly<br/>
when a new baby will have a physical need for my attention for a<br/>
while.  This post is about wanting positive ideas to help us both in<br/>
this transition, from parents who have been in &quot;that boat&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I appreciate your input but I have spent quite a bit of time learning<br/>
about the research on the biochemical reaction to passive (esp. TV)<br/>
electronic media and my mind is made up on that. Furthermore I have<br/>
seen his reaction after exposure to a lot of tv and<br/>
computer...regardless of what the edu content is, his response has<br/>
shown me as an in-tune mom that less is better for us. Bringing in a<br/>
TV after 8 yrs of not having one b/c I am approaching a situation<br/>
where there is any possibility that he&#39;ll already be getting a bit<br/>
less attention or stimulation is not a possibility I would even consider.<br/>
<br/>
Emotionally touched?  I&#39;m scratching my head on that one.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
tell anybody else for whom this makes sense not to use it, but in my<br/>
family we don&#39;t get our emotional needs met by electronic equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else have some ideas/experience?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460496515">This is not at all philosophical or steeped in any &quot;true faith&quot;<br/>
about educating people, but a practical response.<br/>
<br/>
In every room that we all routinely occupy (as in, ignore the<br/>
guest bedroom), I keep a kid&#39;s spot.  In the kitchen, it is<br/>
filled with snack making stuff; in the den, it has games and<br/>
toys; in the dining room it has a telescope (great view) and a<br/>
tea set.  That&#39;s true at the moment, but the items rotate.  I<br/>
fished out a field guide to birds to put in the dining room this<br/>
morning (same great view).  Madam has many wonderful,<br/>
educational, cool, (cheesy) toys, but my job is to make sure they<br/>
are scattered in front of her when otherwise she might miss the<br/>
connection.  Her &quot;treasure toys&quot; stay in her room, but everything<br/>
else rotates around the house so there is always something new to<br/>
think about.  The month the microscope spent in the kitchen was<br/>
an iffy decision, but let your conscience be your guide.<br/>

There are other moms who have been through having a baby and an older child.  <br/>
There are lots here who remember BEING that older child.  That experience and <br/>
those memories are probably more useful than &quot;research&quot; in justification of <br/>

By his actions, your son is telling you what he needs. He needs to be with<br/>

doing on his own.)<br/>
<br/>
When he picked out those kits, I&#39;m sure they probably seemed fun to do on<br/>
his own, but in reality they didn&#39;t live up to that. But I&#39;m betting if you<br/>
did them with him, he&#39;d enjoy them. (Or maybe they&#39;re just not as much fun<br/>
as they looked and you can sell them on eBay or Half.com and get something<br/>
else even better.)<br/>

available, and not limiting them to the things *we* think are productive<br/>
uses of time. Making ourselves available *is* harder with a new baby coming.<br/>
So I&#39;d help him be part of taking care of the baby and encourage anything he<br/>
wants to be part of, even if it would be a lot easier for you to do by<br/>
yourself. And make nursing or nap time special times for him.<br/>

disconnected the N64 entirely.  His TV time is not strictly limited, <br/>
but it is limited.  But the computer is a different thing entirely.  <br/>
Therea re some games that have the same bad effects as the N64 and <br/>
some that he can play for hours with no problems.  So, his computer <br/>
time is limited only by the fact that he is sharing it with 5 other <br/>
people.<br/>

As a mother of a child who truly has problems with this stuff, I say, <br/>
follow your instincts.  Only you are there.  Just make sure it is your <br/>
instincts and his reactions you are following and not some social norm <br/>
that you harbor unknowingly.<br/>
