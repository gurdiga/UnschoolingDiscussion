<div id="ygrps-yiv-982599086">Since January, we&#39;ve made some sweeping and radical <br/>
changes in our family life, largely due to the influence of this <br/>
group. Thank you so much for being unrelenting in how you <br/>
express your ideas (not settling for &quot;each mother is a good <br/>
mother&quot; type replies).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the midst of struggling through a few issues and I <br/>
wondered if anyone would be willing to help me sort them out.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve got five kids and our youngest two are 6 and 9. They&#39;ve <br/>
sensed that they have more freedom than they&#39;ve ever had <br/>
before. But so far, we still say when they should go to bed, for <br/>
instance. We&#39;ve relaxed the rigidity of a bedtime (if a show is on <br/>
they want to watch, they can stay up, or if they are playing a game <br/>
and are in the middle, we don&#39;t rush them to finish...).<br/>
<br/>
Still, they don&#39;t completely decide for themselves about <br/>
bedtimes. And they&#39;ve noticed. Now they say, &quot;Mom, I really want <br/>
to stay up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my pickle and I suddenly saw what it was this a.m.<br/>
<br/>
The kids feel this enormous sense of freedom now since we&#39;ve <br/>
started unschooling. They no longer assume that because we&#39;ve <br/>
always done something in the past, it will continue that way. So <br/>
they are expressing more freely &quot;I want to stay up late&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
like doing that household job.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My dh, otoh, is not reading this list. He is generally incredibly <br/>
supportive of the unschooling life we&#39;ve chosen, but he still feels <br/>
that littler kids (our younger two) need us to give them bedtimes, <br/>
to protect them from the music and TV choices of the teens and <br/>
so on. In fact, he asked me why I wouldn&#39;t want to give them <br/>
bedtimes but would be uncomfortable with them watching MTV <br/>
late at night with thier big siblings.<br/>
<br/>
Good question!<br/>
<br/>
Is it ever right to &quot;step in&quot; and determine for a child what is right <br/>
for that child? And if so, when and on what basis? Is there a <br/>
difference between restricting movies or music and bedtimes?<br/>
<br/>
My dh brought up that driver&#39;s licenses are for 16 year olds and <br/>
voting is for 18 year olds.  As a society we recognize that younger <br/>
children are less mature and need experience before being <br/>
trusted to in all areas. Does this apply to little kids and their <br/>
viewing/sleeping habits too?<br/>
<br/>
I will think I&#39;ve got it, and then I get stumped by a question or two <br/>
and feel that I go all fuzzy again.<br/>
<br/>
I want to fundamentally respect my kids and their choices, but I <br/>
also feel very responsible for them and don&#39;t want to make the <br/>
mistake of not being &quot;mindful&quot; (as Sandra called it). I just don&#39;t <br/>
know how to do that without moving into parental control. And <br/>
what do you do if you and your spouse don&#39;t see it the same <br/>
way?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Julie<br/>
<br/>
We have a general bedtime, though it is much later than it used to <br/>
be. EVeryone seems to want to stay up later these days. Plus, I think <br/>
our bodies are following a natural cycle, going with the sun a bit. I <br/>
still tend to get up pretty early, even with going to bed later.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. We&#39;ve adopted a &quot;stay up alone night&quot; policy, where each kid <br/>
gets to do just that, once in awhile. Nothing set, just...when a kid <br/>
says &quot;Can I stay up alone tonight?&quot; we often say &quot;sure.&quot; It&#39;s still <br/>
our decision to say yes or no...and we do that based on how much <br/>
sleep they&#39;ve gotten in recent weeks, whether we have to be up and <br/>
out the next morning, etc. <br/>
<br/>
You might find a way out of your kids asking to stay up later, if you <br/>
give them a &quot;stay up alone&quot; night once in awhile.<br/>
<br/>
The driving at age 16 thing. Out here in rural Idaho, kids drive much <br/>
younger than that, and farm children are eligible for a day license <br/>
at age 14, but lots of them have already been driving for awhile by <br/>
that age. 16 is an arbitrary assignment of maturity. Some kids are <br/>
not ready to drive by 16, needing to mature more before having that <br/>
responsibility. Some kids are ready for it, younger. Not many, IMO. <br/>
But anyways.<br/>
<br/>
Since parents have the responsibility of paying their Dr. bills, I <br/>
think parents have the right to determine some of these things for <br/>
the kids. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877627019">In a message dated 6/6/03 7:54:03 AM, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:julie@...">julie@...</a> writes:<br/>

&lt;&lt; We&#39;ve relaxed the rigidity of a bedtime (if a show is on <br/>
<br/>
they want to watch, they can stay up, or if they are playing a game <br/>
<br/>
and are in the middle, we don&#39;t rush them to finish...). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think being non rigid is more important than the other extreme.<br/>
Things start where they are, and if the mom decides that maybe a kid <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have to finish all his food, that&#39;s good.  If a mom thinks maybe a snack <br/>
before dinner is okay, that&#39;s good.<br/>
<br/>
My objection to too many arbitrary rules is that there are too many and <br/>
they&#39;re arbitrary!<br/>
<br/>
On the other end, I think that as a family moves away from rules for rules&#39; <br/>
sake to conscious decisionmaking based on saying yes to things that aren&#39;t <br/>
harmful, it&#39;s quite likely that they&#39;ll move all the way to a whole LOT of &quot;sure, <br/>
that&#39;s fine&quot; way into territory the rules would never have allowed them to <br/>
reach.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In fact, he asked me why I wouldn&#39;t want to give them <br/>
<br/>
bedtimes but would be uncomfortable with them watching MTV <br/>
<br/>
late at night with thier big siblings.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have conditions on being up.  &quot;Be up if you can be quiet.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Stay in the house&quot; (for younger kids especially, and for loud company-kids <br/>
particularly).<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t do things that make the dog bark.&quot;  (They thought playing quietly with <br/>
the dog was okay, but there are certain games that involve barking.)<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you could say &quot;I don&#39;t mind you being awake, but I don&#39;t want you <br/>
watching MTV.  Stay in your room and do something quiet so even if you&#39;re not <br/>
asleep you&#39;ll still be resting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s an &quot;if/then&quot; the kids can decide whether they&#39;d just rather go to <br/>
sleep than keep to the restrictions.  And as they get older (which just keeps <br/>
happening every day &lt;g&gt;) they can get more range.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just don&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
know how to do that without moving into parental control. And <br/>
<br/>
what do you do if you and your spouse don&#39;t see it the same <br/>
<br/>
way?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask him to think about what it would really hurt, to let them practice <br/>
decision making on benign things like being awake instead of alseep at 10:30 <br/>
p.m. (or a.m. &lt;g&gt;), in their own home.  Pretty danger-free.<br/>
<br/>
Marty slept nine  hours and some last night, but not very well.  He&#39;s sick.  <br/>
But he knew he was feeling bad, and so went to sleep just after 9:00 and got <br/>
up when his alarm went off at 6:45.  I didn&#39;t have to tell him to go to sleep.  <br/>
He WANTED to go to sleep.  If he had a bedtime, he would have been looking at <br/>
the clock instead of listening to his body.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Is it ever right to &quot;step in&quot; and determine for a child what is right<br/>
for that child? And if so, when and on what basis? Is there a<br/>
difference between restricting movies or music and bedtimes?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I think it depends on the family and the circumstances and also if it&#39;s<br/>
not just a rule because, that it has sound reasoning behind it, then it&#39;s<br/>
okay. You mentioned bedtime. My oldest goes whenever she wants. She knows<br/>
what she can handle with work and school and things planned. Sierra, at 7 is<br/>
very good at her self regulation. So I pretty much let her go. There are<br/>
times when she&#39;s up until midnight and other times when she asks if she can<br/>
go to bed at 11:00. (what would I say.....no??) The 2 1/2 year old gets very<br/>
cranky with not enough sleep or will fall asleep the next day late and<br/>
totally throw everything off kilter. So her bedtime if you will is anywhere<br/>
around 11 until 12:00. No set time, we wing it. Joseph is not good yet at<br/>
seeing his tired signs. I see them but he doesn&#39;t. He loves to stay up and<br/>
will go for a long time and the next day he&#39;s unbearable. I have let him go<br/>
for about a month and he doesn&#39;t regulate in that time. It&#39;s caused big<br/>
problems with how he relates to others. So as long as he gets some good<br/>
sleep for a couple nights, going to bed when the baby does, I&#39;ll tell him<br/>
when he asks to stay up that it&#39;s okay. He knows he can&#39;t do that every<br/>
night. He sees how he&#39;s grouchy the next day. That little bit of help I give<br/>
him, with good reasoning is helping him to understand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My dh brought up that driver&#39;s licenses are for 16 year olds and<br/>
voting is for 18 year olds.  As a society we recognize that younger<br/>
children are less mature and need experience before being<br/>
trusted to in all areas. Does this apply to little kids and their<br/>
viewing/sleeping habits too?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 We just went through the driving thing here. I personally don&#39;t think that<br/>
here where I live, most 15 year olds should be driving around. I should also<br/>
say that most 70 year olds shouldn&#39;t either. And I could lump in all the<br/>
ages in between!!! But it&#39;s the law here. 15 can get their restricted and<br/>
most of the parents of these children let them drive alone. It&#39;s easier for<br/>
them. Then after a year, literally on their 16th birthday they can get their<br/>
license. I didn&#39;t see Tara being ready at 15 to drive. Luckily for me, she<br/>
wasn&#39;t feeling ready or eager either. She got her restricted at almost 16.<br/>
Slowly we started showing her and taking her out. She&#39;s over 17 now, has her<br/>
own car but no license yet. She&#39;s getting comfortable with her car which she<br/>
recently got on the road before she goes for her test. She&#39;s knowing her<br/>
strenghts and weaknesses and learning accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
As far as TV and movies, we don&#39;t restrict. I have noticed that when<br/>
something questionable comes on, the children either turn the channel or<br/>
tell me that makes them uncomfortable and can I watch for it and let them<br/>
know if it happens again or if it&#39;s that kind of movie or show.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And what do you do if you and your spouse don&#39;t see it the same<br/>
way?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am fortunate to have a husband pretty trusting of my parenting and what I<br/>
have learned and tried and looked into. Once in awhile, the old family<br/>
mentality comes back and he gives a &quot;because I said so&quot; answer. We talk a<br/>
lot about what he can do that&#39;s better. I have him read things or just read<br/>
things to him. Then talk some more so he sees what&#39;s really important and<br/>
how big of a deal could that be or let&#39;s just try and see what happens. It&#39;s<br/>
getting easier now for him too.<br/>

    Ask your kids a lot of questions.  Talk to each other.  Tell each other <br/>
how you feel about things.  You don&#39;t need formal family meetings or anything, <br/>
just talk. Whatever kid is around!!  lol  Learn about the different things <br/>
that everybody wants, needs, and likes.  Don&#39;t have a lot of expectations about <br/>
results, just have fun.   If the conversation gets off track, don&#39;t worry about <br/>
it, you&#39;ll have plenty of opportunities to talk another time, or day.  <br/>
<br/>
    With things between you and your spouse, same thing, but without the <br/>
kids, at least sometimes.  Try and understand each other&#39;s pov about things, the <br/>
motivation behind them, preconceived notions that pop up. Explore the <br/>
reasoning, justifcations, whatever, for feeling or thinking that way.<br/>
<br/>
    Mindfulness, awareness, consciousness, they&#39;re all basically the same <br/>
thing.  Open up, share, and listen.  <br/>
<br/>
    It&#39;s sounds so new agey and simplistic, lol, now that I&#39;ve reread it what <br/>
I wrote.  Oh well!  <br/>

feel fine restricting one while I wouldn&#39;t the other.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m getting the feel for this. The goal is at all times to give <br/>
our children the greatest sense of ownership over their lives that <br/>
we can. In those instances where there is a need for parental <br/>
oversight (as in having had more experience with late nights or <br/>
with adult movie material) stepping in needs to be with clear, <br/>
easy to understand reasons that the child has the chance to <br/>
hear and respond to.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like we can go a long way in letting our kids discover <br/>
what they can tolerate and then in those rare instances, we can <br/>
say &quot;Not tonight&quot; with a good explanation for why this is an <br/>
exception.<br/>
<br/>
Does that sound close?<br/>

behind my back. And so far, that&#39;s how we&#39;ve been doing it. I <br/>
keep checking in with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
But mostly, I&#39;m playing more with my kids. That&#39;s been the <br/>
biggest help in all of it. We do so much talking and laughing. The <br/>
spirit in the house has been incredible since January.<br/>
<br/>
We had one long, long talk on Sunday about how to manage <br/>
computer turns (five kids, one computer). It took over an hour and <br/>
a half. But I suddenly got to this incredible point where I finally <br/>
saw what the problem was. it took so much talking! They were <br/>
ready to have longer turns (they had continued with the original <br/>
plan I had set up as a default). So we reconfigured to two hour <br/>
turns.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly now no one is hovering waitnig for a turn and the kids <br/>
are more inclined to do other things (activities, reading, <br/>
whatever) because they know they won&#39;t be on for two hours at <br/>
least. It was this amazing breakthrough that we never would <br/>
have had without all that talking.<br/>
<br/>
So if that&#39;s the key, then I&#39;m feeling really much better.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think I&#39;m getting the feel for this. The goal is at all times to give<br/>
our children the greatest sense of ownership over their lives that<br/>
we can. In those instances where there is a need for parental<br/>
oversight (as in having had more experience with late nights or<br/>
with adult movie material) stepping in needs to be with clear,<br/>
easy to understand reasons that the child has the chance to<br/>
hear and respond to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I hear stepping in, I think of something going on that we are not a<br/>
part of and then making ourselves become a part of that situation and then<br/>
leaving again. Like seeing a fight, stepping and stopping it and then<br/>
leaving. So I like to think of it more like just being a part and always<br/>
being there with our children to talk about whatever is going on. Not<br/>
necessarily being right on top of them but behind them or beside them to<br/>
help and guide when needed. Always talking about what is going on, whether<br/>
there are problems or not makes it so that we don&#39;t just &quot;step in&quot; when<br/>
there is a problem. It&#39;s something we&#39;re always around for and our kids know<br/>
that and don&#39;t feel odd or shy or embarrassed to ask. I think that&#39;s what<br/>
you understood, just clarifying for myself and maybe others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Seems like we can go a long way in letting our kids discover<br/>
what they can tolerate and then in those rare instances, we can<br/>
say &quot;Not tonight&quot; with a good explanation for why this is an<br/>
exception.<br/>
Does that sound close?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. And when it&#39;s not arbitrary, then our children get it too because it&#39;s<br/>
not a &quot;because I said so&quot; which isn&#39;t fair at all to them. They start to<br/>
hear what we are saying and why instead of just no all the time for no real<br/>
reason.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Good to hear. My dh just said that he&#39;d like me to forward some<br/>
of these discussions so he can read along and get the ideas for<br/>
himself. Think I&#39;ll send him yours. :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll send certain sights to my husband but I find reading some<br/>
posts from here, or printing them out and leaving them for him to take to<br/>
work, or just sending some to him works best. Then later we talk about them<br/>
after he&#39;s had time to digest them. Then I can give him my take on things<br/>
and listen to his perspective and work on both ways and how we can leave<br/>
parts out, include them and make them both better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709558098">We&#39;ve got five kids and our youngest two are 6 and 9. They&#39;ve <br/>
  sensed that they have more freedom than they&#39;ve ever had <br/>
  before. But so far, we still say when they should go to bed, for <br/>
  instance. We&#39;ve relaxed the rigidity of a bedtime (if a show is on <br/>
  they want to watch, they can stay up, or if they are playing a game <br/>
  and are in the middle, we don&#39;t rush them to finish...).<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve relaxed our bedtime routine also. We do still say when it is bedtime but try to gauge how tired they are. I would like to get to the place where they decide but we aren&#39;t ready for that yet. <br/>
   I have relaxed heaps with the food restrictions and stopped imposing Tv restrictions and I am getting comfortable with that. We have also stopped spanking and I find that finding new ways to resolve daily conflicts is quite exhausting so there are days when I really need the bedtime routine. <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m hoping that over the next few months that this will get easier then we can look at letting go of the set bedtimes. I have just been worried  that if we changed everything at once that it would be too much for me to cope with and it wouldn&#39;t last.<br/>

They&#39;ll get older and calmer too.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I ask Holly if she could please go to bed because... (insert good <br/>

alone,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;ll get well sooner if you sleep more, I think,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;ll have more <br/>
fun with the other kids at X event if you get more sleep.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
She has never said &quot;NO, forget it, I don&#39;t want to go to bed.&quot;  Sometimes she <br/>
will make a counter offer, like, &quot;How about you tuck me in and I&#39;ll listen to <br/>
Cyndi Lauper?&quot; or &quot;Can I watch a video if it&#39;s quiet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll say &quot;Okay, but put the sound down low so maybe you&#39;ll fall asleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the result is she not only goes to bed, BUT it&#39;s all couched in terms <br/>
that make it like she did me a big favor, and then I say &quot;Thanks, I really <br/>
appreciate it.  See you in the morning!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No tears, no fear, no frustration.<br/>
If I could count the times I went to bed frustrated, angry, scared or crying <br/>
(usually two of the above), I would probably start crying right now!  Luckily <br/>
I&#39;ve forgotten all but a few, though I know there were hundreds.  Holly&#39;s <br/>

  I know people who used to put their toddler into her cot, turn out all the lights and go out and leave her to cry herself to sleep. One thing my mum did for me until I was 11 or so was stay with me till I was really sleepy and comfortable so I wanted to do the same for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
  I have always tried to make bedtime comforting and pleasant. I usually read to the kids and often I&#39;ve read poems till they have fallen asleep. It always seemed cold to just say bedtime and send them off. And if the day has been bad everyone feels better after a story and a cuddle.<br/>
   <br/>
  Although I do remember when Mia was a few weeks old, we had two weeks of evening screaming, nothing seemed to calm her. <br/>
<br/>
  Mark was away and the boys were 5 and 3 and used to an hour of bedtime stories. After getting them fed and bathed (all done with a screaming infant over my shoulder) I would put them to bed, turn off the lights and pace the room with Mia crying in my arms and tell them The Story of Peter Rabbit (I knew it by heart I had told it so often)speaking very loudly so they could hear what I was saying. Sometimes one of them would pipe up in the dark, &#39;say that again mum I didn&#39;t hear you!&#39; I thought I was going to go insane at the time but it&#39;s kinda funny now. <br/>

little kids (just under one year, and one and a half years). She did <br/>
MANY things wrong, including trying to force potty training on our <br/>
1.5 year old boy!!! but one of the things she did well was, sitting <br/>
with them in their room until they fell asleep. We could never get <br/>
Katie down before about 10:30. Gramma had her asleep by 9:00 at the <br/>
latest. <br/>
<br/>
We never did just send them off, though. We had our cuddle time <br/>
before putting her in her crib. But...it was the sitting in there <br/>
with her that made the difference.<br/>

Exactly. That was my point when talking about Joseph and his bedtimes.<br/>
Explaining or suggesting instead of telling. He&#39;ll take some books to bed<br/>
with him or even play gameboy awhile until he really feels the tiredness<br/>
that I see.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, Sierra asked to go to sleep. I told her to say goodnight to<br/>
everyone and round up her sister and I would be in. I heard her calling<br/>
Alyssa but didn&#39;t hear that she found her. So when I went to go in, the door<br/>
was closed to the bedroom and the lights were off. I went and checked my<br/>
moms place to see if Alyssa was there. No Alyssa and only Sierra had said<br/>
goodnight. I went into the bedroom and both girls were in bed with lights<br/>
out making shadow animals on the wall with their flashlights. I kissed them<br/>
goodnight and left them that way. Not sure how long they stayed up but they<br/>
were quiet and when I went in later, they were sound asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph stayed up until after 1:00. I would have liked him to sleep sooner as<br/>
we were at the water park all day, but time got away from both of us.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s after noon now and Joseph and Sierra have been up for about a half<br/>
hour, Alyssa is still sleeping.<br/>

Maybe that&#39;s part of it.  Maybe it&#39;s just one more aspect of the controls and <br/>
measures.  If we don&#39;t know when they fell asleep, we aren&#39;t being good <br/>
scientific parents.  (And so many detractors say then the kids are running the <br/>

brushing teeth, talking about our day, reading, prayer, singing to him, <br/>
putting on a tape after lights out, and he saying goodnite to his little stuffed <br/>
animals on his headboard, is our routine, and all this starts at or around 10.  <br/>
<br/>
He falls asleep faster. It&#39;s comforting to him.  I&#39;ve done it every day, his <br/>
whole life. Don&#39;t take that away from your kids if they need it, or even if <br/>
the family needs it, for now.  Be open to what works better for them, yes, but <br/>
don&#39;t just throw it out the window if they need/want it/ are used to it.  <br/>

very recently he usually nursed to sleep in my bed.<br/>
