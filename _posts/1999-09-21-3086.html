<div id="ygrps-yiv-917353046">our lives are all full, it is a busy season when we have young children.  our <br/>
marriage relationships are sooo important, too.  we are all in need of <br/>
attention sometimes and luckily many women are able to intuit who needs it <br/>
most when.  we need to include ourselves in that, but of course not at the <br/>
expense of other important relationships.  self-preservation is a worthy <br/>
cause i am dedicated to!!  however, ensuring that others in my imm. fam. are <br/>
always aware of their worth and how valuable they are is right up there, too. <br/>
