<div id="ygrps-yiv-781588964">***But I need my<br/>
children to at least learn to read and write, well actually a lot more<br/>
than that.<br/>
Dalene (obviously still not quite there)***<br/>
<br/>
My youngest, she&#39;s 5, is learning to read (not yet reading, but on her<br/>
way).  She is doing it on her own, with a little bit of help from me and<br/>
her dad.<br/>
<br/>
She says, &quot;what is this word&quot; and we tell her.  She says &quot;this word<br/>
says  p hon ee,&quot; we say, &quot;close, good sounding out&quot; and we tell her the<br/>
sound p and h make when they are together and how an e on the end of the<br/>
word changes the vowel sound.  That&#39;s our teachable moment and then we<br/>
let it go.<br/>
<br/>
She can read very simple words without help now, something she is doing<br/>
on her own without us sitting her down and making her go through<br/>
workbooks (friends keep trying to loan us 100 easy steps to reading - or<br/>
whatever it&#39;s called - I keep saying thanks, but we&#39;re doing fine<br/>
without it).<br/>
<br/>
My 7 1/2 yo is not interested in learning yet (although I suspect he<br/>
knows more than he cops to).  When he&#39;s ready to start asking, we&#39;ll be<br/>
here to answer the question, not to sit him down and make him work.<br/>
<br/>
The point is they will learn.  If you read to them, show them that it is<br/>
fun, and if you read for pleasure or information yourself they will pick<br/>
it up and teach themselves.<br/>
<br/>
We read every night for at least an hour (we&#39;ve only missed a few and I<br/>
feel guilty for that!) since our first was new born.<br/>
<br/>
Keep it up, it works - I&#39;ve seen the grown up proof!<br/>
