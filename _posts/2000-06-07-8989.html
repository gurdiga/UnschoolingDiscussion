&gt;<br/>
&gt;That doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.  People seem to have a &quot;place&quot; for children <br/>
&gt;in their minds and have decided that that is where they should stay!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Our son has always been interested in things &quot;above&quot; his age and we have <br/>
&gt;never followed the age guidelines on products (books, games, etc..)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wish they wouldn&#39;t print age limits on books and software boxes. My son<br/>
has a tendency to read these and limit himself to those within his age<br/>
range, even though we reassure him that this is just someone else&#39;s<br/>
suggestion and he can pick whatever he wants. <br/>
<br/>
I have also been annoyed (and my son turned-off as well) by presentations<br/>
given by museums or historical places supposedly aimed at children. These<br/>
&quot;special&quot; presentations are often dumbed-down to the point of boredom. I am<br/>
learning (the hard way) to avoid these to prevent my son from instantly<br/>
turning away from whatever subject it is they are discussing. Maybe the<br/>
special programs sound too schoolish and thus too &quot;boring&quot; (his word). <br/>
