Scrooge&#39;s Christmas List<br/>
by Gary Foreman<br/>
<br/>
       &quot;Cratchit, take your Christmas grab bag and be gone. Out, I tell<br/>
you, or you&#39;ll be seeking new employment!&quot; That scene wasn&#39;t included in<br/>
Charles Dickens&#39; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; but I can easily picture crotchety<br/>
old Scrooge taking Bob Cratchit to task for attempting to include him in<br/>
an office holiday gift exchange. Scrooge certainly is the symbol of<br/>
someone who doesn&#39;t like Christmas.<br/>
       But, if you think about it, many of us harbor Scrooge-like<br/>
feelings<br/>
today. We really don&#39;t want to participate in yet one more gift exchange.<br/>
We&#39;re out of both time and money.<br/>
       The sad fact is that for many of us, Christmas shopping has become<br/>
largely an obligation. We buy presents because it&#39;s expected. Take a look<br/>
at your list. How many gifts are you buying because you really want to<br/>
bless the person receiving it? And how many fall into the &quot;I gotta&quot;<br/>
category?<br/>
       Part of the problem for all of us is that most of the people that<br/>
we buy for already enjoy material wealth. They truly &quot;don&#39;t need<br/>
anything.&quot; In fact, your present creates a problem for them.<br/>
       Yes, I know that some think only a real Scrooge would take people<br/>
off their gift list. But, I&#39;d disagree. Many of the gifts that you will<br/>
give this season will actually hurt the person you give them to. Here&#39;s<br/>
how. They really don&#39;t need whatever you bought. It&#39;s just one more item<br/>
to take up closet, cabinet or attic space. You&#39;ve put them one step<br/>
closer to needing a bigger house (with a bigger mortgage payment). You&#39;ll<br/>
consume their time and money without adding any enjoyment to their lives.<br/>
       And you&#39;ll diminish your own life, too. Whether you consider this<br/>
time of year to be an important part of your faith or just a time of good<br/>
will, rushing from store to store will take your mind from the real<br/>
meaning of the season. You will be focused on things and not on the<br/>
relationships that are important to your life. So I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s<br/>
really in the spirit of the season to reduce the number of people on your<br/>
gift list.<br/>
       In fact, you&#39;d be doing friends a favor by not exchanging gifts.<br/>
You&#39;d both save the time spent buying and wrapping the gift. If you truly<br/>
value that person, it&#39;s much better to get together for lunch or dinner<br/>
and catch up on what&#39;s happening in your lives.<br/>
       OK, in some cases it&#39;s not practical to drop people from your<br/>
list.<br/>
So how can you make the best of gift shopping?<br/>
       Before you go shopping, consider why you&#39;re buying each present.<br/>
Decide which people on your list are really important. You have a limited<br/>
amount of time and money. Spend them on the people who are truly<br/>
important in your life.<br/>
       Everyone else should be handled without a big fuss. It&#39;s not that<br/>
we don&#39;t like the people in our office gift exchange. It&#39;s just that six<br/>
months from now they won&#39;t remember what you bought them.<br/>
       An office party is a great place for a gag gift. Thrift stores can<br/>
provide an assortment of items that can be used for funny gifts. Stuffed<br/>
animals, clothing, coffee mugs and toys are fertile ground for the<br/>
imagination. Is the recipient a stickler for time? An old alarm clock<br/>
could be good. One where the hands have been removed is even better.<br/>
       Many of us have far away relatives and friends. Unless you&#39;re<br/>
particularly close, you might as well admit that you really don&#39;t know<br/>
what they already have or what they need. So no matter what you get<br/>
there&#39;s a good chance that it will need to be returned. Rather than<br/>
combing the malls hoping that the perfect item will jump into your arms,<br/>
why not consider a gift certificate from a national chain of stores. Or,<br/>
better still, agree to a dollar amount that you will each spend on your<br/>
own family. Do your buying after Christmas and send the &quot;giver&quot; a photo<br/>
of the gift that they &quot;bought.&quot;<br/>
       For local friends and relatives, think about where your lives<br/>
intersect. That&#39;s the place to begin looking for a present. If you find<br/>
that your lives have drifted apart, it&#39;s better to spend time catching up<br/>
instead of shopping.<br/>
       Then there&#39;s those very special people on your list. Your spouse,<br/>
children and others who you truly want to make happy with a gift.<br/>
Remember that it&#39;s not how much you spend. While it&#39;s nice to find a<br/>
thoughtful gift for that special someone, what they really want is you.<br/>
The people that are most important in your life want your time and<br/>
attention. They want your happiness. Don&#39;t disappoint them by picking<br/>
something that&#39;s expensive but impersonal.<br/>
       Finally, please understand that this isn&#39;t meant to imply that you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t give to those who need help. Not everyone in our world is<br/>
blessed with the abundance that so many of us have. And the less<br/>
fortunate would can use your gift. If you can afford to, please<br/>
participate in Angel Tree, the Salvation Army kettles or other programs<br/>
to help those who struggle. If you&#39;re really in the holiday spirit you&#39;ll<br/>
feel much better giving that new sweater to a poor child rather than your<br/>
Aunt Edna.<br/>
       Nor is this meant to imply that you should ignore the holidays.<br/>
This is a wonderful time of year. My hope is that you&#39;d make the most of<br/>
your resources and bring happiness to the people who matter in your life.<br/>
       Here&#39;s to a wonderful holiday for everyone. Hopefully your holiday<br/>
will be filled with joy and wonder.<br/>
