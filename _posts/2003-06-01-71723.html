<br/>
I bet someone here will come up with something brilliant, but if not and you <br/>
want to reprint one of my essays.   They&#39;re linked from <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/articles">http://sandradodd.com/articles</a><br/>
<br/>
and you can use one for sending me a copy of the final publication.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you get something quick, original and brilliant though from some of <br/>
the really good writers here!<br/>

I edited and didn&#39;t proofread.  I left fragments of two different plans. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ren and Zenmomma have articles I bet.<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few there that weren&#39;t in HEM, just local (or other local) <br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
All Kinds of Homeschooling<br/>
<br/>
Moving a Puddle (it&#39;s online at unschooling.com, but before that it was in <br/>
Enchanted Families and F.U.N. News)<br/>
<br/>
Tiny Monsters (I don&#39;t think was ever in HEM)<br/>
<br/>
Art, Aging and Spirituality (Holly and the Hippie Shirt)<br/>
<br/>
Magical Thinking and Spoiled Children<br/>
<br/>
Rejecting a Pre-Packaged Life<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think those are the only-published-regionally set, though a few were <br/>
published three times or four, in various local-groups&#39; newsletters.</div>
