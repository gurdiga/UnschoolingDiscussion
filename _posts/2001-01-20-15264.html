<div id="ygrps-yiv-700448274">Does anyone know anything about homeschooling in Taiwan? I have a friend who <br/>
wants to hs, but who says the laws only allow it through 2nd grade. This <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound right to me, but I didn&#39;t find anything definitive on a brief <br/>
search.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
