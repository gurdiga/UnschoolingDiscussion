Could you elaborate?  My kids have enjoyed the premise of &quot;integration&quot;, if<br/>
you will, of pain and sorrow into the beauty of the world and how one can<br/>
truly choose, not so much what happens to them in life, but how they respond<br/>
to it.<br/>

&gt; Could you elaborate?  My kids have enjoyed the premise <br/>
of &quot;integration&quot;, if<br/>
&gt; you will, of pain and sorrow into the beauty of the world and how <br/>
one can<br/>
&gt; truly choose, not so much what happens to them in life, but how <br/>
they respond<br/>
&gt; to it.<br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s see, where to begin . . .<br/>
<br/>
1.  They had a problem with the no seeing colors or hearing music <br/>
thing.  Those things are such an important part of both of their <br/>
worlds they can&#39;t imagine living without.<br/>
<br/>
2.  No travel.  No far off lands to imagine.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Someone else chooses your career and your life is regulated by <br/>
age.<br/>
<br/>
4.  The end meant different things to each of them, for one,  the <br/>
kid, whose name I forget, doesn&#39;t find civilization.  He is <br/>
hallucinating and he dies at the bottom of the hill.  For the other, <br/>
even though he found others, it may or may not have been better and <br/>
the people he left behind were left to cope with a situation they had <br/>
no way to understand because of generations of total control.<br/>
<br/>
5.  On a deeper level, they were thinking about how a society like <br/>
that could develope . . . how people could give up so much in the <br/>
name of being safe.  Of course it&#39;s even scarier to think about now.<br/>
