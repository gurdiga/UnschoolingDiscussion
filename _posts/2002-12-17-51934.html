<div id="ygrps-yiv-108744228">I was curious too so I googled dakini and this is what I found at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dakini.demon.co.uk/">http://www.dakini.demon.co.uk/</a><br/>
<br/>
Superficially the Dakini embodies the spirit of female wrath, she<br/>
appears to dance in a wild frenzy, bent on destruction chaos and<br/>
transformation. She is naked except for a necklace of skulls around her<br/>
neck. The skulls are those of her slain victims. In her right hand she<br/>
holds a vajra or knife. In the left she caries a skullcup, it is filled<br/>
with blood which she drinks. In most images of the Dakini she is seen<br/>
dancing on the corpse of a human.<br/>
<br/>
Initially the images may appear repulsive and violent. For those beings<br/>
who are not attracted to or excited by violence they may<br/>
legitimately ask themselves what they are doing as a central part of one<br/>
of the oldest world philosophies which takes very seriously the concept<br/>
of compassion and loving kindness.<br/>
<br/>
For those beings who find violence and anger attractive and are attached<br/>
to such states they may mistakenly see in the Dakini a<br/>
glorification of wrathful violence, particularly as manifest in the<br/>
female form. To view the Dakini on either level is to miss her teaching.<br/>
<br/>
The Dakini are not bent on mindless destruction or chaos for its own<br/>
sake The wrath they embody is towards their own states of<br/>
anger, greed and delusion, which they and their practitioners seek to<br/>
cut out and transform. Great energy and determination is<br/>
needed to achieve this and the violent imagery used shows the energy<br/>
necessary to cut out the roots of ignorance, greed and delusion.<br/>
<br/>
Just as St George cuts the head of the dragon in icons throughout<br/>
Christendom, so the Dakini severs the heads of beings who are<br/>
none other than her own demons. To see the Dakini as a being who revels<br/>
in anger or violence for its own sake is to misunderstand the imagery.<br/>
Hers is not a glorification of anger and violence but a transformation<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
Dakini are also known as Sky Dancers, and they appear in many different<br/>
guises. The concept of the Dakini is highly developed in<br/>
Tibetan Buddhism and many images and stories of the Dakini come from<br/>
that culture. However the spirit of the Dakini is<br/>
trans-cultural and is not tied to any historic period.<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting.<br/>
