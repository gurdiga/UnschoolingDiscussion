<div id="ygrps-yiv-967544597"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I remember the progression from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;retarded&quot; to &quot;Special Education&quot;<br/>
&gt; to &quot;Learning Disabled.&quot;  That one I was in the front row for.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now, forgive me, but I was gone a few days, so I confess to having done some<br/>
serious deleting to catch up.  I haven&#39;t read all the messages.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t think anyone would disagree that there are truly disabled<br/>
people who exist.  The kind of folks with extremely low IQ or low<br/>
functioning abilities, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s a big difference, of course, between someone who will always<br/>
need assistance with their basic living situation, and the sort of folks<br/>
that are/were labeled Learn Disabled.<br/>
<br/>
My father worked as a graduate student with (the late) Helmer Myklebust, who<br/>
was one of the folks who &quot;discovered&quot; the existance of learning<br/>
disabilities.  He really knows this stuff well, and has spent many hours<br/>
patiently explaining to his very dense daughter (me!) how LD&#39;s work.  Here&#39;s<br/>
the summary: these kids don&#39;t learn the way school teaches.  They need to<br/>
learn things in a different way.<br/>
  <br/>
That&#39;s all, folks.  A different way.  Now, why this is called a disability<br/>
beats me!  <br/>

<br/>
But I know of no disabilities which prevent learning &quot;the way unschooling <br/>
teaches.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know there are people who claim unschooling won&#39;t work for their kids, but <br/>
I&#39;ve never heard anyone who really tried it make that claim.<br/>
<br/>
And I will certainly except such drastic situations as blind/deaf and serious <br/>
cerebral palsy and other situations in which the child can&#39;t communicate or <br/>
receive input.<br/>
<br/>
But in a situation where a child is verbal and can manipulate objects, what <br/>
could be better than unschooling, if the parents understand it and are <br/>
willing to live their lives with their children in that way?<br/>
