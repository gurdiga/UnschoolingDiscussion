<br/>
The only family I know that does school-at-home with ease is the one that is<br/>
featured in the following vignette:<br/>
<br/>
5yo says &quot;yuck&quot; to squash for dinner.  Father makes 5yo eat the entire<br/>
family&#39;s servings of squash.  Mother proudly states that none of the kids<br/>
have said &quot;yuck&quot; in the 18 years since.<br/>
