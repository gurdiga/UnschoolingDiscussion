<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934080223">To begin with let me tell you where I was as a parent about 4 years ago.  My<br/>
children were spanked, we lived on a fairly rigid schedule (mondays-laundry,<br/>
tuesday-clean the house), I was in complete control of the kids (what they<br/>
watched, ate, who they played with, etc.).  Then we discovered unschooling<br/>
and it was like a light went on.  My parents were very relaxed, supportive<br/>
parents to me and I went a little nuts as an adolescent (have since figured<br/>
out that it was about me, nothing to do with them).  I somehow bought into<br/>
the plan (could it have been that graduate degree in psychology?) that if I<br/>
just could make my kids tow the line enough that life would be a breeze for<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
We have 5 kids, ranging from 11 down to 2 three year olds.  We are<br/>
completely unschooling for several years now and loving it.  The kids have<br/>
much more control over their lives and all seem happier.  However, it is<br/>
like I have hit a plateau or something.<br/>
<br/>
I do really good with the kids as long as no massive stress comes into play.<br/>
The kids are asked nicely to do things and usually agree.  The kids make<br/>
their own decisions about food, tv, friends, etc..  Lots of hugs and kisses,<br/>
lots of laughing but with 7 of us in the house and 3 under age 6, we live on<br/>
the edge of chaos (which again is ok as long as life is smooth).  Then<br/>
something happens and I find myself taking out my stress on the kids<br/>
(over-reacting, biting someone&#39;s head off, etc.)  I always apologize when I<br/>
have one of my tantrums but I&#39;m having trouble moving past this level.<br/>
<br/>
We have very busy lives, just trying to keep up with the kids so I figure<br/>
stress is inevitable and I better cowboy up.  I have changed my diet,<br/>
started working out again, say a prayer for patience daily.  Any thoughts,<br/>
comments or criticisms would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Then<br/>
something happens and I find myself taking out my stress on the kids<br/>
(over-reacting, biting someone&#39;s head off, etc.)  I always apologize when I<br/>
have one of my tantrums but I&#39;m having trouble moving past this level. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do any of the kids ever do that?<br/>
It could just be genetics.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve never read, but figured out on my own from observation, is <br/>
that some people take a long while for adrenaline to come on them.  They are <br/>
always called &quot;Self controlled&quot; but really they just don&#39;t get excited <br/>
(biochemically speaking) very easily.<br/>
<br/>
Then some DO.  I knew a woman who jumped straight to fight-or-flight about <br/>
just about everything, and she stayed angry for 24 hours or more.  Whatever <br/>
chemical or process undoes adrenaline, hers wasn&#39;t working very well.<br/>
<br/>
Tricks to put off that moment can work a long time, but not, I think, <br/>
forever.   <br/>
<br/>
One thing about being angry is it give kids the opportunity to figure out how <br/>
to respond differently to someone whose dander&#39;s up.   It&#39;s a good skill to <br/>
have.  Even if we tell them &quot;Please go away for half an hour so I can be <br/>
grumpy all by myself.&quot;  Or if we say &quot;Go clean the library so when I go in <br/>
there I don&#39;t throw a fit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Deep breathing helps me.  Oxygen and more oxygen when I&#39;m about to lose it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes asking for help from someone real and present helps.  Picking a <br/>
kid, or my husband, and or a visiting friend, and saying &quot;I&#39;m feeling really <br/>
stressed and I don&#39;t want to yell, so what&#39;s the easiest way for me to get <br/>
through this next half hour?&quot;  Sometimes that helps.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m thinking about how Holly&#39;s birthday is Saturday and I can&#39;t go up and <br/>
clean out a cake-eating area.  There are two tables that are possibilities <br/>
and I have no idea the status of either of them, so I&#39;m frustrated.)<br/>

<br/>
What comes to mind to me is &quot;make your lives less busy&quot;.  Drop an<br/>
activity or postpone a commitment or something.<br/>
<br/>
Or, get more help for you, even if it&#39;s a few hours a week of paid help,<br/>
like a teenager who will do stuff with the kids or do light housework.<br/>
<br/>
Or, simplify what you do.  Put the hamper closer to the washer, eat<br/>
easier to prepare foods, wash the sheets less often, or put the less<br/>
popular toys/things into storage in the garage for awhile.  Put some of<br/>
the toys that are the most annoying to pick up relative to their play<br/>
value and put them in a harder to reach place.  (Yes -- I am EVIL! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I can think of.  I realize none of these suggestions are<br/>
original (but they are free).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451673181">Julie,<br/>
Let me get this straight, you&#39;ve got 5 kids, three under 6 and sometimes <br/>
you lose it.<br/>
Honey, I lose it sometimes with two.  (Well, three counting the <br/>
husband.)  ...or rather, I *used* to snap a lot more than I do now.<br/>
<br/>
Do all the stuff that Betsy recommended.  That&#39;ll help, and yeah, it&#39;ll <br/>
cost some pennies but if it&#39;s money versus hollaring at your kids, well, <br/>
maybe it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
If you find yourself still &#39;losing it&#39;, get yourself to a doctor or <br/>
psychiatrist.  You&#39;re under a GREAT deal of stress just keeping things <br/>
going from day to day.  If you&#39;re snapping over things that normally would <br/>
slide right off your back, you might have problems with your seratonin <br/>
uptake mechanisms.  Meds can help.  (And this is where I come out of the <br/>
closet.)  I&#39;ve gone through it and been there.  My body sucks the seratonin <br/>
out of my brain like a hoover on turbo.  I love my meds.  It lets the <br/>
seratonin hang out longer, which is lovely. (This, coming from a woman who <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to take headache meds and has only selectively vaccinated her <br/>
kids.)  I don&#39;t pop meds lightly, but these are GREAT.  I still get pissed <br/>
off when the world deserves it, but I don&#39;t &#39;lose it&#39; anymore, I don&#39;t get <br/>
frustrated as easily by the little stuff and I&#39;m still &#39;me&#39; with my <br/>
same-old wry sense of humor.  It&#39;s wonderful stuff!!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something to consider and it&#39;s usually covered by insurance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds as if you are very aware and have given this all quite a bit a<br/>
thought. So forgive me if I presume to ask you if you&#39;ve read any of Alice<br/>
Miller&#39;s work? She has quite a few books out and also there is quite a bit by<br/>
her over at www.naturalchild.com. In my experience &quot;Normal&quot; psychological<br/>
educational training doesn&#39;t really unveil the ways that we disrespect<br/>
children in our culture from birth on. Reading Alice Miller helped me to<br/>
understand whole sections of my life where I didn&#39;t get the kinds of things<br/>
that all humans need. At times with my own children, especially when they hit<br/>
an age at which *I* had difficulty as a child, it was if I was blocked in<br/>
dealing with them. I don&#39;t know how to explain it, but her words can be so<br/>
healing. They freed me from thinking I had to protect, in my mind, people who<br/>
while trying their best still did me harm. That allowed me to both accept the<br/>
pain and the harm and move on and get beyond it in ways that &quot;understanding<br/>
and forgiving&quot; hadn&#39;t let me. If that makes any sense? This in turn allowed me<br/>
to be more generous and less demanding of my own children.<br/>
<br/>
As someone with a strong background in psychology you might find _The Drama of<br/>
the Gifted Child_ (gifted in this case means sensitive and aware) particularly<br/>
interesting. <br/>
<br/>
I find the whole subject fascinating. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801596162">Apparently the biggest help I needed was just venting about myself.  I feel<br/>
much better and today has been pretty darn good.  I really do feel that the<br/>
stuff I go off about is worthy of frustration, Zach (9) has lost the wire<br/>
snips AGAIN after he promised to put them away when he used them, Danny (3)<br/>
ruining the remote control because he wanted to see what was inside it,<br/>
Michelle (3) using the dining room wall as a coloring book  all in the same<br/>
day.  I just want to modulate my responses better.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, you may have something with genetics.  I&#39;m a lot like my dad.  He is<br/>
a lot of fun, not a big control freak or anything, but when he gets mad, he<br/>
gets really mad, lets it out and its over within a few minutes.  Something<br/>
to think about.  Problem is my ideal is to be something like the Zen master<br/>
from the old &quot;Kung Fu&quot; show.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
