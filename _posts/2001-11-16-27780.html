<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031772745">My son&#39;s allergies showed up in early infancy while I was nursing. LLL <br/>
suggested food allergies, so I went thru the list one by one. I went without <br/>
corn, chicken, dairy, eggs, nuts, blah blah blah, I don&#39;t remember what all, <br/>
for a few weeks. Then worked each of them back in. He had intense screaming <br/>
fits following the dairy and eggs. My entire family, except my ex who was <br/>
there, thought I was nuts, or that it was just a series of coincidences and I <br/>
was too dim to know that. It gets really old having people dismiss what you <br/>
know to be true with your own children.<br/>
<br/>
I personally believe that all illnesses/conditions are a mix of dietary and <br/>
emotional issues. When I get sick, it isn&#39;t just stress, and it isn&#39;t just <br/>
diet. It&#39;s usually a mix of both. When I&#39;m stressed, I don&#39;t eat well, which <br/>
is when the body really needs good stuff while being overtaxed. When I don&#39;t <br/>
eat well, I don&#39;t feel well and life&#39;s little ups and downs seem more <br/>
stressful. I have seen enough to know that my son is allergic to milk, in <br/>
good times and bad, but that in bad times the allergic reactions are more <br/>
intense. I think that only makes sense, anything would be more intense when <br/>
you&#39;re already stressed/upset. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the stress <br/>
caused the allergy.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s both. And it can be hard to say which is more influential <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
