   &lt;&lt;I loved the post but the end made me think your revelation wasn&#39;t yet <br/>
illuminating your whole life with kids! &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OOO please elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And the kids don&#39;t necessarily need bought kits to learn in surprising ways, <br/>
so don&#39;t just wait for the order to come in, but start to give them other <br/>
things, ideas, and opportunities.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying... I am still trying to understand unschooling.  I hear that we are to guide our kids,<br/>
that we are to supply the &quot;tools&quot;..but then you say give them other things and ideas.  I&#39;m not quite sure<br/>
on what those &quot;other things&quot; are.  I was &quot;blown away&quot; by discovering where their interests really lie, but I also<br/>
know that I can&#39;t keep buying &quot;stuff&quot; to fit their interests.  We are getting a bunny and guinea pig at the end of the month<br/>
but instead of going out and buying a ready made cage we are going to build and outdoor hutch.  I hope this opens itself to <br/>
other building projects and perhaps bird feeders, etc.  Is this what you mean by giving them &quot;other things&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess growing up in public school and teaching preschool and preK, has warped my brain into thinking I have to have<br/>
a schedule and know what we are going to cover next month or two months from now.  We are used to schooling<br/>
at home in a relaxed method for the last 4 years.  It&#39;s very difficult to give that up and on top of that <br/>
acquire more patience.  <br/>
<br/>
Please, I hope everyone keeps discussing their days triumphs and also their struggles so I can hear advice on various situations.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!!<br/>

<br/>
Things other than school-style science kits.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I was &quot;blown away&quot; by discovering where their interests really lie, but I <br/>
also<br/>
know that I can&#39;t keep buying &quot;stuff&quot; to fit their interests. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is stuff in your house already. There is stuff in the grocery store, at <br/>
thrift stores, at other people&#39;s houses, in museums, in your yard, in parks, <br/>
trees, movies, books, imaginations.<br/>
<br/>
Look everywhere, not just in educational supply catalogs.   <br/>
In fact, it might be an aid to quicker unschooling if you prevent looking at <br/>
anything you now consider &quot;educational&quot; until after the point when you see <br/>
that those things are in some cases counter-natural-learning, and that <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; can douse the fire of learning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We are getting a bunny and guinea pig at the end of the month<br/>
but instead of going out and buying a ready made cage we are going to build <br/>
and outdoor hutch.  I hope this opens itself to <br/>
other building projects and perhaps bird feeders, etc.  Is this what you mean <br/>
by giving them &quot;other things&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s mechanical and measured compared to the kind of <br/>
learning and connecting you will be able to do when you get really good at <br/>
this!<br/>
<br/>
A guinea pig could lead to animal behavioral questions, weaving, anatomy, <br/>
inter-species mind-meld experiments &lt;g&gt;), an interest in evolution, tracking, <br/>
genetics, and that&#39;s without even taking him out of the cage.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess growing up in public school and teaching preschool and preK, has <br/>
warped my brain into thinking I have to have a schedule and know what we are <br/>
going to cover next month or two months from now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Lots of people, don&#39;t feel bad.<br/>
But if you decide now what you&#39;re going &quot;to cover&quot; next month, you will <br/>
choose one thing out of a billion instead of being open to a hundred of them <br/>
pleasantly surprising you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We are used to schooling at home in a relaxed method for the last 4 years.  <br/>
It&#39;s very difficult to give that up and on top of that acquire more patience. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you acquire patience first, it will be a cinch to &quot;give that up.&quot;  You <br/>
don&#39;t have to give it up as one subject area or project, and then &quot;on top of <br/>
that&quot; begin a project designed to acquire more patience.<br/>
<br/>
Patience and understanding and thought are just readjustments of your <br/>
behavior and thinking.  You don&#39;t acquire them, you put them into practice.   <br/>
It&#39;s not very difficult to make your decisions today based on what you <br/>
believe is good for your family.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;I loved the post but the end made me think your revelation wasn&#39;t yet <br/>
illuminating your whole life with kids! &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;OOO please elaborate.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You said you had a revelation, which is something was revealed.<br/>
<br/>
I think you showed a corner of darkness when you referred to whatever I <br/>
quoted when I made my statement.  I wish you had quoted more so I didn&#39;t have <br/>
to go back and look.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  I bet it was this:<br/>
<br/>
-=- Now if I could only get my youngest to read!!  Life would be easier.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
When you learn that she can read without you getting her to do it, life will <br/>
be easier.<br/>

something if she asks, or if it seems that she wants to know, but I do<br/>
that with a lot of people, and they show me how to do things.<br/>

&gt; months from now.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no idea what we&#39;ll be doing within the next couple of months.<br/>
Well, I&#39;ll take that back,  I do know that Rain will be spending all of<br/>
July at a theater class, at her insistence,  and we&#39;ve planned a few<br/>
playdates and parties and softball games and a camping trip for this<br/>
month... but that&#39;s not stuff we&#39;re &quot;covering&quot;, it&#39;s stuff we want to do.<br/>
I imagine Rain will cover some of the state standards for PE during<br/>
softball, and some of the language arts standards during theater class,<br/>
but I really don&#39;t care. She loves doing it, she&#39;s excited about going,<br/>
she wants to be there, and she&#39;s learning and growing and being.<br/>
<br/>
Last week she caught a little bluegill and was thrilled. She made her dad<br/>
a father&#39;s day card in a secret code of her own creation. She baked a<br/>
cake. She swam at our club with a friend. She played air hockey at the<br/>
club. She prepared a garden plot and planted pumpkins. She made 5 outs<br/>
during one softball game (as fielder, not batter). She read more about<br/>
orphan trains. She memorized the words to Plant a Radish, and sang along<br/>
with the record (yup, an old 33). She digitally photographed the two baby<br/>
rats we&#39;re trying to give away (fingers crossed, they may have a new<br/>
home). She played Space Beans with some friends. She picked out a copy of<br/>
Oliver Twist at a library used book store. I&#39;m not sure if she plans to<br/>
read it now, or someday, or ever. It&#39;s all good.... she&#39;s a happy kid,<br/>
she functions well in the world, and has the skills to do what she loves<br/>
doing. Her softball coach was talking to me at the last game about how<br/>
hard she works, and she does - anything she wants to master, she will<br/>
master. OTOH, she still writes the letter Z backwards almost always, and<br/>
that&#39;s okay too. She doesn&#39;t care about that now. <br/>
<br/>
Most of that is stuff I didn&#39;t know 2 weeks ago that she would be doing.<br/>
I didn&#39;t buy any &quot;tools&quot;, except Oliver Twist, which cost .50. I truly<br/>
don&#39;t &quot;hope&quot; that her current interests will lead to specific ends, most<br/>
of the time - and when I do it&#39;s usually for purely selfish reasons, like<br/>
I hope she wants to go fishing again because I like to go fishing too,<br/>
and it&#39;s easier and more fun to bring her than to leave her with someone<br/>
for a few days. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566061414">Other things for my family  are things like boxes for<br/>
them to create things all on their own   or small hand<br/>
shovels for them to dig and find worms   maybe a very<br/>
small garden plot for them to plant things (what they<br/>
want  they will learn what grows in the garden<br/>
conditions by trial and error)   Paper airplanes and<br/>
books on origami    give them tools by exposing them<br/>
to the possibility of things and if they like it they<br/>
will do it  if not  you haven&#39;t wasted alot of money<br/>
on things they are interested in yet.   Then let them<br/>
explore every aspect of things they find interesting  <br/>
read the history of things  etc.    Imagination is the<br/>

books fit into the context of our lives.  And Charles is free to remove <br/>

things because I think of them as too &quot;educational&quot; and forget that just <br/>
because something is more on the schoolish side, doesn&#39;t mean that it is <br/>
necessarily bad. <br/>

This afternoon, I brought out the Mindware catalog. I was amazed at some of <br/>
the things Moly and Jack picked out, some of which because of the age/grade <br/>
levels posted I would have passed by. Jack wants a game called Tantrix <br/>
(grades 5 and up, he is 6) I wouldn&#39;t have picked it out for him, because I <br/>
looked at the &quot;age guide&quot; and passed it by as something too logically <br/>
advanced for him. Maybe it will be, and then maybe he will modify the &quot;rules&quot; <br/>
to fit his abilities. All I know is that he says it looks like something he <br/>
would like. Then Darin brought out the McGraw Hill catalog (we started <br/>
getting it a year or so ago when Darin still wasn&#39;t sold on the unschooling <br/>
idea, and wanted me to buy more &quot;educational&quot; books.) I looked at it and <br/>
rolled my eyes at him. But he gave it to the kids and gave me a *just wait* <br/>
look. Moly picked out two things in it. One was a learn to speak Spanish book <br/>
with flash cards and the other was a book on prominent African Americans and <br/>
events. When I asked why she had picked these two books, she said she wanted <br/>
to know more about one of her new ball teammates. She and the rest of her <br/>
ball team were invited to his birthday party, and both his grandmothers fixed <br/>
ethnic foods for the kids and they played games and music that Moly hadn&#39;t <br/>
heard of or played before. <br/>
 <br/>
So even though we want to pick games and books because our children are <br/>
interested in them not because they are educational, we also don&#39;t want to go <br/>
so far as to disregard things *because* they are educational. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284206812"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I&#39;m trying... I am still trying to understand unschooling.  I hear that we <br/>
&gt;&gt;are to guide our kids, that we are to supply the &quot;tools&quot;..but then you say <br/>
&gt;&gt;give them other things and ideas.  I&#39;m not quite sure<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on what those &quot;other things&quot; are.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;other things&quot; are the stuff of life. :o) Give them trips to new places, <br/>
time with new people, new textures to touch and new stuff to read.<br/>
<br/>
Go for walks out in nature and pay attention to what your kids are noticing. <br/>
Maybe they&#39;d like to catch a ladybug, play in the stream or gather some new <br/>
rocks and leaves. Maybe they&#39;d just like to stare up at the clouds. Maybe <br/>
it&#39;s the perfect moment to ask you that relationship question that&#39;s been <br/>
bugging them. If you don&#39;t plan this time in a certain way, it can become <br/>
anything. Let them play and explore and rest and talk and gather and sort <br/>
and pretend to their heart&#39;s delight.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can have them decide which cereal or yogurt to pick out at the <br/>
store. *You* can notice if they need help with pricing, volume, nutritional <br/>
value, whatever. In fact a trip to a new grocery store can be an adventure <br/>
in itself. It&#39;s amazing how accustomed we get to our own little world of <br/>
food. A visit to an ethnic grocery, wharehouse store or natural food co-op <br/>
will spark all sorts of new ideas, tastes and questions.<br/>
<br/>
Show them how to find and download stuff off the internet. Keep them well <br/>
supplied in scales, measuring tapes, pencils, crayons, paints, paper, books, <br/>
videos, things to take apart, things to put together, maps, playgrounds, <br/>
building toys, games, cards, dice, measuring spoons, magnifying glasses, <br/>
dirt, water and *you*. You are the most important &quot;thing&quot; in their discovery <br/>
of this world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I was &quot;blown away&quot; by discovering where their interests really lie, but I <br/>
&gt;&gt;also know that I can&#39;t keep buying &quot;stuff&quot; to fit their interests.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s great to see what our kids will choose if actually given the choice. <br/>
:o) Sounds like  your kids are enjoying the freedom to choose their own <br/>
schooly, curriculum stuff and they&#39;ve managed to surprise you by their <br/>
choices. As they get used to their new UN-schooly freedom, they&#39;ll surprise <br/>
you even more with their choices of interests out there in the real world. <br/>
It won&#39;t have to be purchased from a kit though (although sometimes kits are <br/>
fun and desired around here). It will be something they come across just by <br/>
living.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;We are getting a bunny and guinea pig at the end of the month but instead <br/>
&gt;&gt;of going out and buying a ready made cage we are going to build an outdoor <br/>
&gt;&gt;hutch.  I hope this opens itself to other building projects and perhaps <br/>
&gt;&gt;bird feeders, etc.  Is this what you mean by giving them &quot;other things&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could be. But if you limit yourself to looking towards the goal of other <br/>
building projects, you may not appreciate some real learning taking place in <br/>
a totally different area.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a guinea pig and rabbit. They house beautifully together. We <br/>
got the rabbit to keep the pig company since we learned that piggies are <br/>
social animals. We&#39;ve had a blast just watching the two animals interact. <br/>
Rabbits are bold and fearless. Piggies are skittish and careful. But put <br/>
them together and a wonderful nurturing takes place. The piggie started <br/>
coming out more and getting a little bolder. The rabbit nurtures the pig and <br/>
actually pushes his little butt out of the cage for a visit. They are <br/>
amazing to watch.<br/>
<br/>
We would also like to build an outside hutch for them after we move. When we <br/>
do, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll learn all sorts of new stuff. Maybe someone will want to <br/>
build more, maybe not. It&#39;s the experience of the moment that counts though. <br/>
The journey. The getting there. If I look too much towards the next step, I <br/>
might miss the joy and learning and opportunities in the step I&#39;m on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I guess growing up in public school and teaching preschool and preK, has <br/>
&gt;&gt;warped my brain into thinking I have to have a schedule and know what we <br/>
&gt;&gt;are going to cover next month or two months from now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve all had to shake off that type of thinking to a certain extent. Some <br/>
of us more than others, based on our background. ;-) What has helped me, is <br/>
to look at my &quot;schedule&quot; as continuing on until my kids are grown. That&#39;s a <br/>
lot of time to grow and learn and mature. It gives us a LOT of flexibility. <br/>
And along the way they get to just live their lives right now, in the <br/>
moment. They don&#39;t have to wait until they finish some arbitrary grade or <br/>
lesson plan to start being functioning members of society. They are right <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;We are used to schooling at home in a relaxed method for the last 4 years. <br/>
&gt;&gt;  It&#39;s very difficult to give that up and on top of that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>acquire more patience.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you could use some deschooling time. Take a complete break from <br/>
thinking about schooling, educating or teaching your kids at all. Just be <br/>
with them for a few months. You&#39;ve got the time, take it so you can all <br/>
decompress and get used to this new way of thinking. Going into an <br/>
unschooling frame of mind is much easier after a looooong vacation from <br/>
schoolish thought and methods.<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading here and also at the unschooling.com message boards, Sue. <br/>
There&#39;s a lot of great experience just waiting to be shared.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-723710272">Hello,  I am new to this list, a SAHM, to three wonderful little boys, 9, 7,<br/>
and 5 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
From before I even had children, I knew I wanted to homeschool, so they<br/>
could be free little beings.  However, when time came to sign our oldest up<br/>
for school, I felt the pressure....media, relatives, etc.....  He went to<br/>
Kindegarten which was beautiful, but First grade was a joke and I took him<br/>
out at winter break.<br/>
<br/>
Our middle guy went to K for only three months when I took him out the same<br/>
time I took his older brother out.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad our youngest never has to go to school!!<br/>
<br/>
This past year, we enrolled in an &quot;alternative learning program&quot; through our<br/>
local school district.  We bought a beautiful curriculum (Oak Meadow),<br/>
signed up for some fun classes and thought we were set.  Slowly through the<br/>
year, life stresses (having to move from our home because a sex offender was<br/>
living next door), etc... caused us to not &quot;do school&quot;.  I have to say my<br/>
children were so much happier, so much more interested in books, so much<br/>
more interested in bird watching, finding the names of the flowers in our<br/>
area, playing knights, and acting out Harry Potter, and just playing legos<br/>
for HOURS and DAYS.  We read Harry Potter, a Lewis and Clark book, two<br/>
native american adventure books, and as I was learning how to spin wool, so<br/>
did they.  They have their own drop spindles, they know how to finger knit<br/>
their newly spun wool.  We took extra time to play with our six rabbits, and<br/>
extra time to just do nothing at all.<br/>
<br/>
Wow!!!  I still have that little voice that says &quot;do school&quot;, but when I<br/>
look through even my very favorite curriculum, textbooks, etc...  it all<br/>
seems so lame.  It pretty much all seems like busy work, it is<br/>
uninteresting, uncreative and dull.<br/>
<br/>
So, here I am at your unschooling site, and ALL the unschooling stuff that I<br/>
can find on the net.  I love it!  I hope to find lots of support on this<br/>
list as I go through the change from the old nagging &quot;do school&quot;, that has<br/>
not left my thoughts yet.  I have already read Mary Griffiths Unschooling<br/>
handbook, but would like to read more on unschooling, any suggestions gladly<br/>
received.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the homeschoolers in our area are very fundamentalist, and we are<br/>
not religious at all (spiritual agnostic).  It is hard to find a niche to<br/>
fit into.  Most of our friends and the boys friends over the last two years<br/>
have been public school kids, who we really seem to relate to better.  I<br/>
guess, whatever works.<br/>

found a fun group in Maple Valley.  They are not strictly <br/>
unschooling, but definately unschool friendly.  What part of <br/>
Washington are you in?  I have two children, boy 9 and girl 7.  We <br/>
are also spiritual agnostics and the first group of homeschoolers we <br/>
met were fundamental Christians.  I joined a Yahoo message board  <br/>
called Washingtonunschoolers and met some nice people there.  That&#39;s <br/>
how I heard about the Maple Valley group.  I look forward to talking <br/>
to you some more.  Us unschoolers in Washington State need to plan a <br/>
statewide event where we can get together:)<br/>

<br/>
I find that we relate to the public school kids better, too.  Maybe it is<br/>
because there are so many of them, it&#39;s easier to find some that share our<br/>
interests/beliefs.  Or maybe, (this from experience with one of my son&#39;s<br/>
friends) it&#39;s because public school kids don&#39;t like school any more than my<br/>
unschooled son does!  Our big problem with schooled kids for friends is that<br/>
they go to school all day and aren&#39;t always around when you want them!<br/>
<br/>
Where are you in WA?  My husband is Army, and we have moved on from Fort<br/>
Lewis now, but I spent 3 terrific years in the Tacoma/Olympia area.  There&#39;s<br/>
a great group in Olympia that I heard from a lot, and I think I actually<br/>
managed to go to 1 event in 3 years.  (My son was young then, we left just<br/>
before he turned 5).  I wish I could think of their name, they were terrific<br/>
folks.  Maybe someone else can give you that.  (In the meantime, I&#39;ll rack<br/>
my brain and try to come up with it.)  Washington is a great place, and<br/>
there is so much to do there!  It was amazing to me that within a 2 hour<br/>
drive of where we lived, we could go to the ocean or the Sound, the<br/>
mountains, a volcano, the flower fields, a rainforest, the city, farms, etc.<br/>
It&#39;s such a great a place to unschool -- have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289917160">Thanks Brenda, I always hear lots of good homeschooling/unschooling stories<br/>
that involve Olympia, so I will have to listen a little closer now :).  My<br/>
husband was at Ft. Lewis when I met and married him, I actually liked living<br/>
in Tacoma, even though is has such a bad reputation.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, change of subject.  With unschooling, what do you do about those messy<br/>
rooms, and NOT wanting to clean those messy rooms.  Toys are one thing, but<br/>
the dirty clothes are another story.  Unfortunately they have so many<br/>
clothes, that it would be a long, long time before they ran out if I just<br/>
let them pile up.....<br/>
<br/>
Thinking on the lines of it being teaching, I thought it might be<br/>
appropriate.  When they do clean their rooms, it is all shooved under their<br/>
bed and behind the closet doors.  Of course I also did this as a kid.  I go<br/>
back and forth with worrying about it and not worrying about it, which I am<br/>
sure gives mixed messages.<br/>
<br/>
Our middle son is the one that is good at managing to drag most of his toys<br/>
out into the living room in a day, and then never wants to put them all<br/>
back.  I tell him when it all begins, that they will have to go back, so he<br/>
is well aware of it, but it is still such a struggle.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering what all your philosophies are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315038640">My kids are 3 and 7  and starting at age 3  the rule<br/>
is that any toys on the floor when I am ready to<br/>
vacuum (usually i only do bedrooms on saturday<br/>
morning) will be put in the garage.   For the 3 year<br/>
old the toys get put up for 1 week  for the 7 year old<br/>
it is 1 month.  It works great because when they get<br/>
the toys back it is like they just opened them,  but i<br/>
am going to need a bigger garage.  As far as clothes<br/>
go I tell them that if their dirty clothes are on the<br/>
ceiling fan or under the furniture or in the closet<br/>
instead of in the hamper every night then they get no<br/>
television time the next day.   This sort of thing<br/>
probably works better with younger kids than with<br/>
older ones tho<br/>

&gt; I actually liked living<br/>
&gt; in Tacoma, even though is has such a bad reputation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, change of subject.  With unschooling, what do<br/>
&gt; you do about those messy<br/>
&gt; rooms, and NOT wanting to clean those messy rooms. <br/>
&gt; Toys are one thing, but<br/>
&gt; the dirty clothes are another story.  Unfortunately<br/>
&gt; they have so many<br/>
&gt; clothes, that it would be a long, long time before<br/>
&gt; they ran out if I just<br/>
&gt; let them pile up.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thinking on the lines of it being teaching, I<br/>
&gt; thought it might be<br/>
&gt; appropriate.  When they do clean their rooms, it is<br/>
&gt; all shooved under their<br/>
&gt; bed and behind the closet doors.  Of course I also<br/>
&gt; did this as a kid.  I go<br/>
&gt; back and forth with worrying about it and not<br/>
&gt; worrying about it, which I am<br/>
&gt; sure gives mixed messages.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our middle son is the one that is good at managing<br/>
&gt; to drag most of his toys<br/>
&gt; out into the living room in a day, and then never<br/>
&gt; wants to put them all<br/>
&gt; back.  I tell him when it all begins, that they will<br/>
&gt; have to go back, so he<br/>
&gt; is well aware of it, but it is still such a<br/>
&gt; struggle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just wondering what all your philosophies are.<br/>

Help them.  Make a game of it.  Put on music and pick up in rhythm to the <br/>
music.  Don&#39;t make it punishment of drudgery, make it fun and productive and <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how old your kids are, but in my experience little ones (under 4 <br/>
or 5) can&#39;t/won&#39;t clean a room for a long time. So what I do is take some <br/>
hula-hoops, an egg timer and a radio into the room with me. I say &quot;Now its <br/>
time for our clean up contest!&quot; then I throw the hoops into the middle of the <br/>
mess and say Ready? Set? Go! and turn on the radio and flip the egg timer <br/>
over. Then the kids have three minutes to see who can pick up all the <br/>
toys/clothes in their hoop the fastest. The music is to get them going. When <br/>
the timer is up, most times the mess inside the hoop is gone and the kids are <br/>
clamoring at me to have another contest! I have on occasion, gotten a whole <br/>
room cleaned this way. Most times though the kids are ready to quit after two <br/>
or three tries. That is okay with me because we don&#39;t have the fights and <br/>
arguments, and no one had to pick up more than the others. (They will fight <br/>
over that! I used to get &quot;She didn&#39;t have as many things to clean as me!&quot; <br/>
arguments) There is no *reward* just the satisfaction of the race! Then later <br/>
that day we will go back with the hoops and do it again and the room is <br/>
clean! Maybe not spotless, but if I can see most of the floor and the toys <br/>
are on shelves or in toy boxes and the clothes are in a hamper or in a drawer <br/>
(I don&#39;t worry if they are folded or not) then I am happy. <br/>
Now that my kids are older, we don&#39;t do the hula-hoop thing any more. Now <br/>
they turn on the stereo upstairs, I set the timer on the stove for say 20-30 <br/>
minutes and they have that much time to work a miracle! Again, if the floor <br/>
is de-cluttered enough that one of the kids can run the vacuum over it and <br/>
not suck up any LEGOs or socks then I am happy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101895130">Another thing to think about, and this is coming from experience....<br/>
<br/>
I do not know how to clean, I was never taught and I am not organized <br/>
enough to know how to go into a room and start cleaning it until it is <br/>
clean.  I ,like you had the knee deep room when I was a teen, and I <br/>
always got yelled at for it being dirty, but like at my house now (which <br/>
isn&#39;t nearly as dirty as my room was when I was a teen) I cant go into a <br/>
dirty room and clean.<br/>
<br/>
I actually need a game plan.  I need someone to show me how to start <br/>
with this then do this then do this then do this then that and then your <br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
Example<br/>
<br/>
pick up all clothes and put in basket.<br/>
pick up all trash put in large garbage bag<br/>
make bed<br/>
put anything that doesn&#39;t belong in room on bed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If my step mom had taught me how to clean instead of grounding me to the <br/>
mess until it was clean, then I might be a little more able to handle my <br/>
housework now.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to get into fly lady right now.  Slowly slowly slowly it goes...<br/>

didn&#39;t know to use a toilet brush.  You think that should be natural, but<br/>

I am slowly convincing myself to unschool.  It isn&#39;t a big issue here at <br/>
all because Davy is only 3 but i like the concept, and I understand it.<br/>
<br/>
I need to read john Holts books as they seem to be very popular.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t do punishments here.<br/>
We just ask for the dirty clothes, or I&#39;ll send one of the kids with a basket <br/>
to pick them up.  We figure the purpose of washing clothes is to get clean <br/>
clothes, not for discipline.<br/>
<br/>
If their clothes are under the bed, they don&#39;t get those clothes clean, and <br/>
my kids really LIKE their clothes, and have lots of favorites and well-loved <br/>
clothes.  <br/>
<br/>
When Kirby said &quot;I have no socks&quot; last week, I took a laundry basket into his <br/>
room and said I think socks are in various corners and under stuff.  Sure <br/>
enough he found a few pairs, and I washed them, and the next day he DID have <br/>
socks.<br/>
<br/>
Socks have to do with socks.  If there are natural consequences, that will <br/>
promote learning better than arbitrarily created consequences will.<br/>

<br/>
In the separated twin studies they found that if one twin is neat, the other <br/>
one is too.  If one is a slob, the other one is too.<br/>
<br/>
There was a pair of twins and they thoroughly interviewed them.  They were <br/>
grown men.  They both organized their closets the same way, and their desks.  <br/>
Almost like they copied each other.<br/>
<br/>
One had creditted his neatness and organization to his mother&#39;s training and <br/>
requirements.  The other blamed his mother for being such a slob that he was <br/>
neat in reaction to it--didn&#39;t want to be like his mom.<br/>
