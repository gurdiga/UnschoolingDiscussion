 </span></blockquote>My mother thought two was really enough for anyone to want ha ha ha, I am on<br/>
baby number five! it doesn&#39;t really have the surprise impact on her when I<br/>
tell her any more!<br/>
I have been pregnant 7 times! usually if I say guess what? they say uh your<br/>
pregnant?<br/>
she has gotten over it but really doesn&#39;t get why I would want to be home<br/>
with them either!  even my sister is now concidering homeschooling well at<br/>
least she is passing the thoughts thru her head! but she is afraid what my<br/>
mom will say to her as well,  I told her just read alot about it feel<br/>
confident that you are doing what you think is best and listen the way she<br/>
often does  in one ear and out the other! then go home and say what a pitty<br/>
for her she just doesn&#39;t get it!<br/>
