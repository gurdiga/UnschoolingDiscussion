<div id="ygrps-yiv-424227546">...wait around a few days and see if the reports of huge foaming leaks on <br/>
the starboard side have been exaggerated.)<br/>
<br/>
Mailing lists are so predictable. Even worse than me. There&#39;s an internet<br/>
joke about them that&#39;s very appropriate in our current situation here, I<br/>
wish I had kept a copy of it the last time it floated through my mail box.<br/>
<br/>
A good friend of mine thinks that posts that go, &quot;You are all horrible and<br/>
I&#39;m going to tell you why! And then I&#39;m going to unsubscribe and go away so<br/>
you can&#39;t respond to me, nyah nyah nyah!&quot; cause the death of mailing lists.<br/>
I respectfully disagree with her. I think that only kills lists that, as a<br/>
western courtroom defense attorney might drawl, &quot;needed killin&#39;&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This list doesn&#39;t need killing, won&#39;t be killed by this sort of thing, and<br/>
these scuffles WILL crop up from time to time on ANY list (I was once on a<br/>
cat breeders list that makes our current dispute look like a nice game of<br/>
Candyland, cat people are, well, catty!), with the original offended folks<br/>
storming off in a huff (or, in this case, sticking around to let us enjoy<br/>
the storming right here in the street, scaring the horses, sigh) and other<br/>
people saying &quot;good riddance&quot; and still others who don&#39;t like scuffles and<br/>
aren&#39;t willing to fasten their seatbelts for a few days saying, &quot;Well! I<br/>
never! I&#39;m leaving, too!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People who aren&#39;t comfortable should leave if they want to. I&#39;m vaguely<br/>
sorry for them as I think they&#39;re throwing out a lot of good with a little<br/>
bad, but if they really think they&#39;re not getting enough out of this list to<br/>
warrant it, of course they shouldn&#39;t stay. What a waste of their time!<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t the comfort list, it&#39;s the unschooling list. When people say<br/>
things like, &quot;We unschool except of course for the daily required<br/>
schoolwork&quot; they are going to get called on it. Not everyone can or should<br/>
just pat them on the head and say, &quot;Yes dear, if you want to call that<br/>
unschooling, go right ahead&quot;. I try not to call Pugs Border Collies, either,<br/>
because it&#39;s just confusing to people who know both breeds. I don&#39;t and<br/>
can&#39;t worry about the nice lady on the street insisting that her Pug IS a<br/>
Border Collie, it just doesn&#39;t look like one, can&#39;t run very far, and<br/>
doesn&#39;t notice sheep.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659018112">You know I have to say that when all is said and done I really like this list.  I certainly don&#39;t like everyone that is here and I realized that a Post It note next to my computer with names of people whose posts I know won&#39;t offer me any kind of &quot;constructive&quot; thought is a good idea.  I tend to get very opinionated myself and while I enjoy being stretched on occasion I also know my limits of what topics I feel strongly enough about that its best just to stay away.  After 6 years of being online it has been a long road of learning that.  I feel that I&#39;m in the minority here in a lot of my belief systems but I&#39;m willing to overlook the differences in religion, politics, parenting styles in order to gain some input on unschooling.  Sometimes I feel like unsubscribing, sometimes I do unsubscribe, but I always come back when I&#39;m in a place where I feel I need the support.  I have gone from that &quot;I&#39;m an unschooler, but we have certain things to do&quot; to total unschooling ( although I digress once or twice a year for a week or so) and I can see both sides of the &quot;what is unschooling&quot; coin.  I tend to lean more toward letting everyone have their own definition of what unschooling is to them personally, but I also see the point in not claiming to be something your not.......haven&#39;t really come to any definite answers on that one but one thing I would like to see on this list is a little more tolerance toward people who may call themselves unschoolers but don&#39;t go &quot;whole hog&quot; into the unschooling philosophy......I think there are better ways of getting your point across than saying &quot;this list isn&#39;t for you&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re wrong&quot;.......all you do is push people away...you don&#39;t give them anything to think about, you give them no options but to get defensive or hurt most of the time.  I would like to see a more......&quot;well let&#39;s talk about what your definition of unschooling is&quot; type of answer......of course that is just me and I wouldn&#39;t expect everyone to change their ways, but I think some tolerance would go a long way.<br/>
