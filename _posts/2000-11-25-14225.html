<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083867058">This afternoon we joined a group of around 20 other demonstrators outside<br/>
Portland&#39;s downtown Banana Republic store (adjacent to Pioneer Courthouse<br/>
Square).<br/>
<br/>
 Kory (8) carried a sign protesting the sale of animal fur.  Heidi (10)<br/>
created her own slogans and signs on the spot.  Two of her slogans were:<br/>
&quot;What is it with these holidays?  They make the shopping virus spread,&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Live long and prosper, but don&#39;t live your life out shopping!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In order to attract more attention to her work, she climbed up on a lamppost<br/>
and held her sign high for all to see.  One of the mounted police saw and<br/>
rode over to order Heidi to come down.  That was our closest brush with the<br/>
law.<br/>
<br/>
Kory, wearing his camoulflage trousers, was easily the most vocal of all the<br/>
demonstrators.  He walked back and forth with his sign in hand yelling (he&#39;s<br/>
an expert at that) &quot;Buy Nothing Day, Buy Nothing Day, Buy Nothing Day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The others in the group loved seeing Heidi and Kory take such an active role<br/>
in the demonstration.  I was both surprised and impressed with their<br/>
complete lack of shyness and self-consciousness.  Hopefully neither of those<br/>
things will kick in as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
My contribution was recruiting several other demonstrators to sing<br/>
anti-consumerism carols.  We did three:  &quot;Welcome to Consumer Wonderland&quot; to<br/>
the tune of &quot;Winter Wonderland, &quot;Profits here, profits there, profits<br/>
everywhere&quot; to the tune of &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; and &quot;Slow down ye frantic<br/>
shoppers for there&#39;s something we must say&quot; to the tune of &quot;God Rest Ye<br/>
Merry Gentlemen.  There is a website which has the lyrics to all three of<br/>
these plus several other anti-consumerism carols.  You can find it at:<br/>

<br/>
On the way home, both children asked when we&#39;d be able to do that sort of<br/>
thing again.  They loved it.  For the three of us, this was our very first<br/>
street demonstration.<br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;re all looking forward to Buy Nothing Day 2001.  If you&#39;re in the<br/>
Portland area, why not join us next year.  The more the merrier.  A bunch of<br/>
young families among the demonstrators could send a powerful message to the<br/>
public; a message which needs to be heard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678782719">John...I just don&#39;t get it. Why buy nothing the day after Thanksgiving? Why<br/>
not just buy &quot;less&quot; or buy &quot;better&quot; or &quot;smarter&quot; or whatever floats your<br/>
boat? How many people are going to actually stop buying Christmas gifts<br/>
altogether? Or is this just to get people to stop buying for that one<br/>
day...to postpone it?<br/>
<br/>
There were similar demonstations in Seattle. (hey, it was better than last<br/>
year&#39;s WTO...) But I don&#39;t see this going anywhere. People like shopping.<br/>
People like giving gifts. It&#39;s Christmassy. Why make it unenjoyable for the<br/>
people who want to shop?<br/>
<br/>
Do you know that most actual buying is done the Saturday before Christmas?<br/>
The day after Thanksgiving is a great *shopping* day...it&#39;s a lot of<br/>
atmosphere...more of a holiday tradition than the buying frenzy the BND<br/>
people would tell us about.<br/>
<br/>
If this is fun for you and your family, well, okay. But I&#39;ll be spending the<br/>
same amount as last year, a comfortable sum, nothing that would make or<br/>
break the economy. And I&#39;ll be out there at some point, dodging the<br/>
demonstators, enjoying my shopping trip in spite of it all.<br/>
