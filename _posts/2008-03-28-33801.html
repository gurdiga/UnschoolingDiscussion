<div id="ygrps-yiv-355167773">I just re-read How To Talk so Your Kids Will Listen, by Faber and <br/>
Mazlish. Its funny that it was just discussed on this list, because <br/>
my LLL group just organized a fundraiser where we had Ms Faber give a <br/>
seminar in Chicago. She is very funny in person. She is probably in <br/>
her mid 60s, and she has a Jewish New York accent. So, when I re-read <br/>
the book, not only was I reading it with unschooling in mind, I was <br/>
hearing her voice. lol. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, at one point. the book says that parents should never talk <br/>
about their kids in front of them. I realized that my friends and I <br/>
do this, kind of a lot, I think. We all have kids that are pretty <br/>
young, 6 and under, and we do a lot of discussing parenting and kids <br/>
and situations and stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I get the point that one wouldnt do that if it was another adult. I <br/>
wouldnt talk about my husband to a friend, as if my husband wasnt <br/>
there, and he *was*. But...I am never without my kids! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear other&#39;s thoughts on this topic. I guess one solution <br/>
would be to cease and desist. I could seek advice or talk about <br/>
situations in email or online, only. I wonder what my friends will <br/>
think, too. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

La Leche League is based on discussing experiences and problems, and  <br/>
the babies are all right there.  Some moms have a baby and a toddler  <br/>

designed to make the kids&#39; lives better, gentler, more nourishing  <br/>
(physically and emotionally).<br/>

This is quite a rule:  &quot;parents should never talk about their kids in  <br/>

How would I speak at conferences when my children were there if I  <br/>
followed that rule?<br/>
<br/>
How would people have blogs when their children have learned to  <br/>
read?  What about Christmas letters?  What about praise, or  <br/>
introductions?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if we look at  principles it will be different.  Treating  <br/>
children like we would treat friends or spouses is good.  Not  <br/>
treating them like helpless little kids.<br/>

I talk about my husband when he&#39;s right there sometimes, and I work  <br/>
him into the conversation.  (He&#39;s kinda shy.).  I don&#39;t say bad  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009598934">I try and make sure that if I am talking about my kids, whether they are present or not, I&#39;m not saying things in a way I would be uncomfortable with them hearing. <br/>
<br/>
Early in my marriage to David I decided that he was more important to me than the laughter I could get from friends and acquaintances by making fun of him or telling embarrassing stories about him. I extend that same respect and sense that my relationship with Simon and Linnaea is more important than sharing something personal or amusing with other people. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265771934">I think Sandra hit the nail on the head: Don&#39;t talk *negatively* about them<br/>
(aka don&#39;t talk behind their backs). I see a lot of parents (but not usually<br/>
unschooling parents) do this a lot of the time. It happens to overwhelmed<br/>
mainstream parents when they&#39;re &quot;venting&quot; and maybe are just trying to<br/>
commiserate or get sympathy and support, but I end up feeling bad for the<br/>
kids there when they have to hear &quot;how hard it is to deal with them&quot; even if<br/>
they&#39;re supposedly not paying attention to the words, involved in something<br/>
else. In particular women who wouldn&#39;t dream of talking the same way about<br/>
their husbands to neighbors or acquaintances (such as myself) will go on<br/>
about negative things. I guess they figure another mom will understand. When<br/>
that happens, it&#39;s kind of hard to know how to react. I used to try and turn<br/>
their remarks into positive terms about the child (&quot;Johnny sure knows what<br/>
his tastes are, eh? &quot; when someone complained of Johnny being stubborn), or<br/>
turn the conversation to them (as in &quot;Boy, you sure sound tired and<br/>
frustrated with life today&quot;) and sometimes offer to help by letting the<br/>
child come and play with mine, etc, but I was never sure if that was the<br/>
best thing to say/do, since it seemed a little like &#39;enabling&#39; to do just<br/>
that - continue whining about the child in front of them. But essentially I<br/>
agree with Sandra that there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with speaking<br/>
positively and genuinely about someone in their presence, adult or child.<br/>

Maybe think of it as sex.  It&#39;s one thing to tell a little kid that  <br/>
babies grow inside their moms.  It&#39;s quite another thing to strip  <br/>
down and show them where.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pointing out occasionally what something costs, in terms an  <br/>
individual child will care about, IF he cares, seems fun and good.   <br/>
Telling him things he doesn&#39;t know or care about (compound interest  <br/>
and refinancing mortgages come to mind as things I don&#39;t even care  <br/>
about much) seems way too much, like a long biology and genetics  <br/>
lecture to someone who asked why babies look like their parents.<br/>

<br/>
John Holt had written in some of his books that one way for kids to<br/>
learn real life application of math skills, was to involve them in<br/>
family accounts, bill paying, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t need to be scary to a kid to know that there isn&#39;t a lot of<br/>
money to live on.  It can be a talking point of why you can or can&#39;t<br/>
afford certain things and how you work on finding balance when spending<br/>
money.  Even if you have next to nothing left over after paying bills,<br/>
money is still flexible, and choices are made about how to spend that<br/>
left over bit.  Buying groceries is flexible, buying gas for your car is<br/>
flexible.  It helps to know that you have enough gas to go visit such<br/>
and such, but then you may not have enough to go somewhere else.</div>

sitting directly across from me began talking about her 2 year old (who <br/>
was right there next to her).  She told the story of how he wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
what she wanted him to so she put him in his room for a time out for <br/>
the first time.  She said he screamed and cried and she thought it was <br/>
all so funny.  The other scrapbookers began laughing as well, but I <br/>
actually felt sick to my stomach.  (boy, I am such a different person <br/>
since unschooling!!!)  After everyone quit laughing, I quietly asked <br/>
her what he was doing that made her put him in his room.  She said he <br/>
was climbing.  I asked her if he had something that he could climb on <br/>
and she said he had stuff outside.  I told her about my son when he was <br/>
2 loving to climb and that we borrowed one of those Little Tyke <br/>
climbing toys from a friend and put it in the living room.  She <br/>
said, &quot;Well, he was climbing on the chair to get to the computer and I <br/>
didn&#39;t want him messing with the computer.&quot;  I asked if she had heard <br/>
of those keyboards that you put on top of the regular keyboard that is <br/>
made for toddlers so that he could do some toddler type games on the <br/>
computer, but she really did not want my ideas.  She was hugely <br/>
enjoying all the attention her story about punishing her child was <br/>
getting her and didn&#39;t want to see another side.  That makes me so sad <br/>
for that little boy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680606007">My house had a very hush hush attitude about money.  It wasn&#39;t to be<br/>
discussed in front of the children.  How money one had was always<br/>
secret, and how much anything cost was always secret.  My whole life,<br/>
I couldn&#39;t figure out why I wasn&#39;t allowed to know how much the the<br/>
new couch cost, or the computer, or the oven, or the groceries, or<br/>
anything.  To me, even before unschooling, it never made much sense to<br/>
keep all that quiet all the time.  Seriously, if a child wants to know<br/>
how much it cost, why can&#39;t he know???  <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend going through a divorce and my son (9) wanted to know<br/>
all about divorce.  I was discussing it with him in front of my dad,<br/>
who immediately piped in and told me I should be telling him about<br/>
divorce.  I asked him (my dad) if there was a good reason that my son<br/>
shouldn&#39;t know how or why people get divorced.  He couldn&#39;t come up<br/>
with one.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017830566">Based on the title of the book (and though I haven&#39;t read it in a few years,<br/>
I remember loving it), I wonder if the reason the authors suggest not<br/>
talking about your kids in front of them is so that the kids can grow in<br/>
their trust of mom, and not worry that she&#39;s going to embarrass them by<br/>
telling their stuff to others.  When I want to tell a story about my 5yo dd,<br/>
I turn to her and say, &quot;Is it okay with you if I tell about ...?&quot;  She<br/>
almost always says yes.  But I like that asking permission piece.  I like<br/>
feeling respectful of her, and I like feeling like she is building trust in<br/>
me.<br/>
I do also, privately, sometimes talk about concerns with fellow moms, that I<br/>
don&#39;t discuss with her, but the moms and I know that the topics we are<br/>
discussing are confidential, and that they (the moms) shouldn&#39;t talk about<br/>
me and my kid&#39;s stuff in front of their own kids or with others.  I only do<br/>
this type of sharing with friends I trust to be confidential.  And one way I<br/>
assess whether to trust those moms is if they also aren&#39;t the type of parent<br/>
who shares too much of their kids&#39; &quot;beeswax&quot; with others.<br/>

money because I have similar memories from my childhood.  I learned <br/>
that my mom was embarrassed most of the time because we had so <br/>
little.  I can sort of understand.  The problem is that the only <br/>
thing she passed on to me about finances is that credit cards are <br/>
awesome and should be used as much as the companies will let me use <br/>
them.  I was thousands of dollars in debt at 18 years old.  I hope <br/>
my children won&#39;t think about money in that way.  <br/>
<br/>
We are open about money in our home.  My dd10, Allison, loves to <br/>
help me balance the checkbook and write bills.  My DH earns a good <br/>
salary and I love that my children realize that even though it looks <br/>
like a lot of money up front, that we have responsibilities and <br/>
choices that take up a lot of that money.  They help me keep up my <br/>
budget!  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is also what I&#39;ve done with my kids, and  while most of the time they<br/>
said yes, I found that it sometimes depended on who the other person was. In<br/>
other words, they were  differentiating over who the people were that they<br/>
trusted with &quot;their&quot; stories. The more they knew someone (like a friend&#39;s<br/>
parent, or a friend of the family that they cared about) the less likely it<br/>
would be for them to say &quot;no&quot; (as opposed to a casual acquaintance or a<br/>
friend of mine that they hadn&#39;t had much interaction with yet). This makes<br/>
sense to me.<br/>

&gt; and situations and stuff. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732178364">Hello melissa,<br/>
That is sad...for that little boy and for his mum too.My eldest who is now 8 loved to climb.We caught her on top of our 4 poster bed when she was 2 1/2.She didnt get a time out ... we got rid of the bed for a more comvensional on so she wouldnt break her neck!My youngest learnt to climb quick.She got up on top of the bookcase in the hall where i kept matches....she didnt get time out....we now keep the matches in the top of my husbands wardrobe.This mum could have moved the computer....or like we do...when we are not at the computer the chair isnt there its in pour bedroom so the little one cant get hurt climbing.Then as was mentioned...if they love to climb...let them climb....take them to the park....put in a climbing gym....use your imagination.<br/>
We are not perfect.We have used time out and all that.But not now.Discovering RU and attachment parenting even later in their lifes and not from birth is changing us as people and as a family.I am so thankful for groups like this as i wouldnt have a clue sometimes but i read what others have written and i think...you know that might work here.Sometimes we slip, but we recognise it and know that it will take a while to consiously overwrite the things we have been taught as kids the things we have copied as adults.My husband says &quot;You have to think hard before it comes out of your mouth cause once its out it wont go back in&quot; He is right of course.I think after reading all these posts i will be much much more careful about what i say in fromt of my daughters now.<br/>

sitting directly across from me began talking about her 2 year old (who <br/>
was right there next to her). She told the story of how he wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
what she wanted him to so she put him in his room for a time out for <br/>
the first time. She said he screamed and cried and she thought it was <br/>
all so funny. The other scrapbookers began laughing as well, but I <br/>
actually felt sick to my stomach. (boy, I am such a different person <br/>
since unschooling! !!) After everyone quit laughing, I quietly asked <br/>
her what he was doing that made her put him in his room. She said he <br/>
was climbing. I asked her if he had something that he could climb on <br/>
and she said he had stuff outside. I told her about my son when he was <br/>
2 loving to climb and that we borrowed one of those Little Tyke <br/>
climbing toys from a friend and put it in the living room. She <br/>
said, &quot;Well, he was climbing on the chair to get to the computer and I <br/>
didn&#39;t want him messing with the computer.&quot; I asked if she had heard <br/>
of those keyboards that you put on top of the regular keyboard that is <br/>
made for toddlers so that he could do some toddler type games on the <br/>
computer, but she really did not want my ideas. She was hugely <br/>
enjoying all the attention her story about punishing her child was <br/>
getting her and didn&#39;t want to see another side. That makes me so sad <br/>
for that little boy. <br/>

something to compare it to.  And as the other guys were like 37 and  <br/>

  It was a close call 20 years ago (before Zac was born).  But once we worked it out, it has been really great.  We really never fight.  I&#39;m more of the snappy one and the other night I was exhausted and snapped at him about a totally inane thing and he called me on it in a gentle way &quot;Hey grouchy pants, don&#39;t snap at me over that.&quot;  I realized I had snapped and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I&#39;m exhausted and didn&#39;t mean to snap.&quot;  This morning I made muffins. He told me, &quot;These are really good cashew muffins.&quot;  I said, &quot;Yes they are.&quot;  He said &quot;You&#39;re supposed to say thank you.&quot;  I laughed and said &quot;Thank You.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Keith has problems at work about other people badmouthing their teens.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes that too - last weekend our brother-in-law called to help us with purchasing a new computer (he is a VP at Hewlett Packard and gave us some great pointers in what to get or not get).  We don&#39;t talk with him very often, but he was on the phone with me and then Ed for 2 hours before we even mentioned the computer.  He asked how old Zac is and when I said 13 he was all about teens and their problems.  He has a 21 yr old son and a 17 year old daughter.  He made a comment about how they will be happy when they are fully grown and past this stage - which really shocked me comming from them.  I commented how we were enjoying everything about Zac in this moment.<br/>
<br/>
  Our new computer showed up this morning - it is sitting in boxes.  We have waited a year and a half for this new shinny gadget!  At first we chose to wait because windows XP had just come out and we were advised to wait until the bugs were worked out of XP so to speak.  Then we chose to wait due to money because we decided that we would get a better one with gaming components for Zac. This one has really gotten to Zac lately due to what it cannot do in terms of gaming - it cannot play most games, it&#39;s gotten slower, it glitches and kicks him off in the middle of games, or freezes up and he loses his game, or it freezes up and won&#39;t let us on-line at all, etc.  I finally said a couple of weeks ago to ED, &quot;Let&#39;s just get it ordered, we&#39;ve put it off long enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  So it will be interesting to get it up and going - to see what new games Zac becomes passionate about.  Right now he is upstairs on an old dinosaur that does not even have internet capability.<br/>

Our son is turning 13 in a few months, and I&#39;m feeling so awed by the young man he is <br/>
turning into.  He wants to share everything with us.  My husband and I keep looking at <br/>
eachother, shaking our heads and not believing the conversations were having.  Neither of <br/>
us would have EVER shared the kinds of things with our parents that he does with us.  <br/>
Amazing!!!  And as time goes on we are developing such a nice give and take about his <br/>
care--sometimes he wants to be in charge of more of it and sometimes he wants us to be <br/>
in charge.  The friction points seem to be lessening instead of increasing--maybe because <br/>
our whole view is of him being capable.  As he grows, I&#39;m ready with the reins, handing <br/>
them over.  I didn&#39;t have any sense of that as a teenager.<br/>
<br/>
I just feel anticipation for him.  What will his future look like, what is he going to be up to <br/>
two years from now, or three?  I don&#39;t feel any sense of the dread that people all around <br/>
me feel--and many justifiably so.  We have some family friends whose children were about <br/>
7 and four when my ds was born.  We watched them do very conventional parenting and it <br/>
was like watching a train wreck, but not being able to stop it.  Mom worked full time +, <br/>
Dad at home, but very unengaged, so even though they had a parent at home, he shut <br/>
himself away with his computer and hired a housecleaner/nanny.  And they&#39;ve paid the <br/>
price of disconnection with an 11 year old daughter who wanted to commit suicide, bouts <br/>
of depression, boyfriends that were trouble, etc., and a son who has just faded and <br/>
become kind of lost.  And it was all foreseeable, which has been the saddest part for me.  <br/>
But as long as they got reasonably good grades, they were pretty much left alone.<br/>
<br/>
So I get this continual message from the family that&#39;s something like, &quot;Just you wait--you <br/>
don&#39;t know yet.&quot;  And to some extent it&#39;s true--we haven&#39;t been through it yet--but <br/>
fortunately, I get to read about it from all these awesome families on line who have been <br/>
and not only lived to tell the tale, but thoroughly enjoyed the ride!  I&#39;m so grateful to have <br/>
your stories and your shiny bright teens and young adults to prove that there really is <br/>
another way and that it&#39;s not just luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022354220">-=-LOL - I just read Sandra&#39;s post about calling things &quot;dumb&quot;. I  <br/>
guess stupid<br/>
falls into that category too, huh? LOL-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I used &#39;goofy&#39; the other day.  But seriously, one of the best first  <br/>
steps a family can take toward moving a giant step toward being more  <br/>
positive is to note and back off about anyone or anything they&#39;ve  <br/>
called &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s simple but gigantic.<br/>
<br/>
If things (music, ideas, jokes) are allowed the dignity of being  <br/>
potentially accepted as perhaps good in someone&#39;s estimation, lights  <br/>
come on all over that world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990336211">-=-There are no stupid questions. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are questions that probably shouldn&#39;t have been asked, or that  <br/>
if the questioner  had a second thought would not have been asked.   <br/>
There are irritating questions.  There are questions that are  <br/>
actually quizzes or traps or insults.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes i write a &quot;mad,hate&quot; list<br/>
with all the issues i have with him, I will bitch and moan and state<br/>
what i am really not liking about him. Once i photoshopped a photo of<br/>
him with horns and curse words,lol Then i rip the list up or if it&#39;s a<br/>
list of things that are bothering me i show him. -=-<br/>
<br/>
None of that seems safe or loving or productive to me.<br/>
<br/>
The same way it can help to think that you only get to say &quot;no&quot; some  <br/>
limited number of times (say 300, for the moment) and after that it  <br/>
won&#39;t work anymore... would you say &quot;no&quot; about so many puny pissy  <br/>
little things?<br/>
<br/>
And honestly, after some number of no&#39;s they DO stop working.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With husbands, maybe think that you can only use as many direct  <br/>
insulting criticisms as you can count on two hands.  SAVE THEM.  And  <br/>
you might not ever use them all.  Some things can&#39;t be unsaid, and if  <br/>
you have anything in your head that someone said to you that stung  <br/>
and you remember, that&#39;s reason enough to tread very carefully in the  <br/>
area of sending a  message that will hurt for years.<br/>
<br/>
Go for a walk, pull weeds, wash the dog, rearrange the bottom  <br/>
cabinets, wash the car, watch a happy, familiar movie.  Don&#39;t tell  <br/>
your husband what&#39;s bothering you if it&#39;s not something he can  <br/>
change, and especially not if you wouldn&#39;t want a counter list of  <br/>
what you do that bothers him.<br/>
<br/>
On this matter right now I&#39;m speaking with the authority of my  <br/>
upcoming 24th wedding anniversary (tomorrow).   The expression of  <br/>
resentment or frustration or anger isn&#39;t the way to get lots of  <br/>
anniversaries!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re nicer to your husband, he&#39;ll probably be nicer to you.  It  <br/>
works with kids and husbands and neighbors and all kinds of people.<br/>

I really have to agree with Saundra.  We too are approaching our 24th anniversary in June and playing nice does seem to work really well.  Today I am paying bills, dong paper work for work, etc.   He was in the kitchen so I asked Ed if he would heat me up a piece of pizza - he asked how long I microwave mine - I said I cut mine into pieces first - he jokingly said something about my being so specific and more work for him - then later I asked him to do something for me and he gave me that look and I laughingly quipped &quot;Hey didn&#39;t you know that it is Princess Mom day?&quot;  - he started laughing.  He did it all, because I do for him all the time too. Even without him having to ask - though asking is fine too.  I really enjoy when he does something without my having to ask.  AND I really like to do things for him without him asking - simple things like make tea before I go to work if I notice the jar is low - as I know he really likes his tea.  He goes to bed knowing the jar is empty and when he gets up it is full.  He&#39;s never asked me to do this I just do it because it makes me happy to make him happy.  One day I forgot something to take to work - I didn&#39;t ask him but he saw it and brought it to me.<br/>

Keith isn&#39;t feeling well today.  I did one load of laundry with  <br/>
bleach, and his white socks and underwear were in it.  I took the  <br/>
whole load to our bed to fold, where he&#39;s sitting watching Enchanted.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I just put his clean laundry down for him to fold and put  <br/>
up.  Sometimes I fold it and leave it on the bed for him to put away  <br/>
because he&#39;s really picky about the way the underwear and socks go  <br/>
into the drawers.<br/>
<br/>
But today, because he doesn&#39;t feel good, I put it all away as close  <br/>
to the way he likes it as I could.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a rule about laundry, about whose job what part was, it  <br/>
would be worse than it being a new decision every time, and based on  <br/>
the realities and conditions of the day and of the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I have lots of time.  Sometimes I have no energy and I need  <br/>
to go to bed myself.<br/>
<br/>
Families with rules have a lot to fight about.  Couples with a lot of  <br/>
rules have a lot to fight about.<br/>
