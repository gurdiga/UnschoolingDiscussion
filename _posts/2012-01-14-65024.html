<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105752001">I am pretty new to the group.  I have two sons, 12 and 9.   I will be in Santa Fe, New Mexico moving contents out of the rental house my parents are selling.  We will be driving from Eureka, Missouri. I am interested in finding out if Sandra will be speaking in the area anytime between Jan. 18 and Feb. 1. I am so inspired by Always Learning.  We have had an eclectic approach to homeschooling and the older they get the more things are breaking down.  The word &quot;learning&quot; now has a negative connotation and I am so sad about this.  I need help in this process of transition.  So, I thought hearing Sandra speak in person and perhaps to have the opportunity to meet with her while I was in New Mexico, would be wonderful.<br/>
If there are any families in the St. Louis area who would like to get together that would be great too.<br/>
Thanks for any advice!<br/>

We can definitely help you with that!<br/>
<br/>
If you move from any sort of teaching (and I think &#39;eclectic&#39; is likely to qualify), you&#39;ll need to start from scratch with deschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
If you can go a year without using the word learning at all, that would help.  Get your husband in on it too.  Maybe put a dollar in a jar if either of you says &quot;learn&quot; or &quot;learning,&quot; especially about the kids.   If you THINK &quot;learning,&quot; chuck a quarter in the jar. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Probably by summer you won&#39;t be saying &quot;learning&quot; anymore, and you might have enough in the jar to get to the ALL Unschooling Symposium in Albuquerque in late December. :-)<br/>

I will have company  a couple of times in the time frame you asked about. I&#39;m not interested in doing one-on-one meet-ups (my life would be eaten up by that), but adding one family to another for a trip to Explora or some such is a possibility, and having a discussion with two moms or more is different. :-)<br/>
<br/>
E-mail me on the side, Cordelia, and I&#39;ll see if we can look at dates and options.<br/>
My e-mail is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a> and in case that doesn&#39;t come through, Sandra at SandraDodd.com<br/>
