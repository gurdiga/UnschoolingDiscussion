 </span></blockquote>My kids&#39; current fave is Lego Chess. I think you can get it from <br/>
Amazon.com with 5 other Lego games for about $12. My kids also like a <br/>
lot of the old Microsoft CD-Roms - Dangerous Creatures, World of <br/>
Flight, Oceans, Dinosaurs, Ancient Lands. We have them because I <br/>
worked on all of them, but you can also get them at Ebay. They have <br/>
sound and movies, so reading isn&#39;t a necessity. The Magic Schoolbus <br/>
CD-Roms are another favorite, and the Muppet CD-Rom which is great <br/>
for kids and grownups who fondly remember the show as well. We&#39;ve had <br/>
a couple of Arthur CDs and one Madeline one that they liked for <br/>
awhile. All of the above have outranked the Jumpstart and Reader <br/>
Rabbit type of stuff for enjoyment and longetivity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778886357">Yes,  my kids loved Cluefinders too.   It&#39;s like an Indiana Jones type<br/>
adventure,  solving puzzles and mysteries.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my sons&#39;s first building type game was Tonka Rescue.   He is now into<br/>
the Sim computer games,  Roller Coaster Tycoon and Bionicals.   The last<br/>
three ones might be a bit hard for a preschooler though,  but you never<br/>
know.<br/>

we just inherited the magic school bus cdroms. They were created for <br/>

when having problems with cdroms is going to the website of the <br/>
company that puts the cd out.  For example, one of my daughter&#39;s Lion <br/>
King cds wouldn&#39;t let you play one particular game within the disc <br/>
that required using the arrow keys.  I went to the website (just did <br/>
a google search to find it) and went to the troubleshooting section <br/>
(had to search around a bit) and found out it had to do with a sound <br/>
card (???) and it gave step-by-step directions to fix it.  (Just <br/>
required renaming the sound card file and voila! no more problem.)<br/>
<br/>
And even if your particular problem isn&#39;t already listed, they <br/>
usually have very good online help, or at least email contact that I <br/>
have found to be quick and accurate.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if this will help with this problem, but may help with <br/>

My son is almost five and has been using the computer for about 1 1/2 <br/>
years.  He LOVES it and I have to admit that he has grasped far more <br/>
pre reading skills from that, than me!!  One of the best series of <br/>
games is Clifford, they really make kids use their critical <br/>
thinking.  He also enjoys the Blues Clues games, and the Fisher Price <br/>
games( pirate ship, western town and castle)--although those are not <br/>
as &quot;educational&quot; as the others.  The Little Critter story book ones <br/>
are also really cute!  Also, Winnie the Pooh reading and math were <br/>
excellent!!  Great deals for games can be found at Ross Stores (if <br/>
you have one) or ebay, one guy sells hundreds of games and you can <br/>
combine shipping.<br/>
Have Fun!<br/>

We have Reader Rabbit and we have ME, as long as we remember to change the settings, color screen size, stuff like that we have never had a problem with it reformatting our hard drive, now if we forget to reset stuff, it locks up and crashes. I don&#39;t know if this helps.<br/>

&gt; troubles. Like, formatting our hard drive troubles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this a problem with win 95 software being installed in ME system?<br/>
&gt; Or might it be a Reader Rabbit thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s probably a Reader Rabbit thing. Kid&#39;s software is notoriously buggy and<br/>
compatability problems abound. They are heavily video-intensive so video<br/>
driver conflicts and screen resolution conflicts can also cause problems.<br/>
I&#39;ve never had a problem with the Magic Schoolbus software, I&#39;ve run it on<br/>
Win98, WinME and WinXP. Then again, the Magic Schoolbus stuff was done by<br/>
Microsoft, so maybe it&#39;s a bit more likely to be compatible. We did huge<br/>
amounts of system and video driver compatability testing when I worked there<br/>
on the CD-ROMs, so I know what a big nightmare it is for manufacturers of<br/>
these types of programs. It&#39;s a cost issue too. If you&#39;re a small game<br/>
manufacturer, it&#39;s harder to afford to set up a huge compatability lab with<br/>
all sorts of computers, monitors, video cards, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is if your kids use the computer alot is to either give them<br/>
an old computer when you upgrade or go buy them an old computer. The price<br/>
for a one or two year old computer is incredibly low because upgrades have<br/>
happened so fast that stuff is outdated quickly. But that doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>
can&#39;t run a lot of stuff. My kids are using my 5 year old computer running<br/>
Win 98. Once they&#39;re older and they get into more video intensive games, I<br/>
will probably need to upgrade them, but right now with the stuff they&#39;re<br/>
into, it works fine.<br/>

with it reformatting our hard drive, now if we forget to reset stuff, it<br/>
locks up and crashes. I don&#39;t know if this helps.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one thing I especially like about the Microsoft series of CD-Roms,<br/>
they temporarily adjust your screen resolution settings, then change it back<br/>
when you&#39;re done with the game or if you switch out of it. That way you<br/>
don&#39;t have to go and reset it all the time like you do with so many of the<br/>
CD-Roms. That was one of the hardest parts of the game engine, getting that<br/>
to work well with all kinds of systems, but it is *such* a nice feature. I<br/>
get really tired of having to go and change the kids&#39; screen resolution all<br/>
the time for other games!<br/>
