<div id="ygrps-yiv-911183701">I will be away from home and computer for a full long schoolday, Tuesday, <br/>
January 27.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine is teaching 6th grade social studies (one or two periods) <br/>
and the rest is 7th grade world cultures/geography.   They&#39;ve been studying <br/>
Spain and the Moors and the connection to New Mexico.   They watched El Cid (my <br/>
copy &lt;g&gt;) and I&#39;m going in to play a dictionary game with them, which will <br/>
(after I&#39;m gone) be tied in to a couple of handouts I&#39;m leaving (game kind of <br/>
stuff, not worksheets at all)  and some connections of Arabic words in Spanish, and <br/>
the idea that languages are living and changing and where to co-exist they <br/>
borrow words back and forth.  All that fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I gathered up all the leftover paperback American Heritage dictionaries from <br/>
long ago when I used those as primary text.  It&#39;s a little spooky, but I think <br/>
it&#39;s going to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s going with me.  These kids are her age.  <br/>
<br/>
For those who have lived here (or do), it&#39;s Sandia Prep, on Osuna.   <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;ll have stories. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
