<div id="ygrps-yiv-412590479">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Here are this week&#39;s dozen stories from Japanese national newspapers <br/>
concerning educational, family and children&#39;s issues.<br/>
<br/>
A positive story on homelearning in Thailand is featured this week, <br/>
further evidence of the Japanese news media&#39;s willingness to consider <br/>
home-based learning both overseas and domestically as a viable <br/>
educational alternative.<br/>
<br/>
The BIGGEST news this week, however, was the Japanese parliament&#39;s <br/>
initial approval of a bill that would allow for Japanese children to be <br/>
sentenced at a younger age for committing violent crimes (see stories <br/>
below). This signifies a major change concerning treatment of so-called <br/>
&quot;delinquent juveniles&quot; in Japanese society. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, lost in all the flurry of press coverage over the Juvenile Law <br/>
was a Japanese government report (also listed below) stating that the <br/>
number of reported child-abuse cases is at an all-time high in Japan -- <br/>
skyrocketing by 70 percent (yes, you read that figure correctly) since <br/>
1999 alone!<br/>
<br/>
In great contrast to the Juvenile Law story, the Japanese national press <br/>
almost seemed to go out of its way NOT to report the &quot;increase in child <br/>
abuse&quot; story.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or is there a connection here between these two types of <br/>
violence that few in media and government want to see?<br/>

A MOVING PICTURE OF LIFE UNDER MOTHER&#39;S DIRECTION<br/>
<br/>
One autumn day a mother sees her daughter off from home with these words: <br/>
&quot;Etsuko, I am glad you are living such a happy life, doing the work you <br/>
like best and having so many good friends all over the world. I hope you <br/>
cherish your work and keep these friendships for the rest of your life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mother is 96, daughter 63. Having just wrapped up one of her <br/>
international projects, the daughter is heading off to a ceremony and <br/>
party to mark the occasion.<br/>

STRICTER PENALTIES NOT ALWAYS THE ANSWER<br/>
<br/>
Three years after her son was brutally slain, 55-year-old Takako Takaya <br/>
still searches for answers.<br/>
<br/>
....Takaya&#39;s son Koichi was 27 when he was savagely beaten and kicked to <br/>
death on the night of Sept. 7, 1997, by five junior high school students <br/>
in a park in Tokyo&#39;s Ota Ward. The beating went on for an hour.<br/>

[Editorial]  NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OVERHAUL CAN IMPROVE EDUCATION QUALITY<br/>
<br/>
....Repeated attempts have been made to reform universities, but they <br/>
have not really helped the institutions shake off their &quot;Japaneseness&quot; -- <br/>
in the negative sense of the word. The Education Ministry was frustrated <br/>
with universities for their refusal to change according to new government <br/>
guidelines, while the universities became openly critical of what they <br/>
claimed was excessive government interference.<br/>
<br/>
It is time to end this pattern of mutual recrimination that actually <br/>
masks [an] unhealthy co-dependence.<br/>

PARENTS IN THAILAND EXPERIMENT WITH DO-IT-YOURSELF EDUCATION<br/>
<br/>
BANGKOK -- Last November, the Thai government introduced a home school <br/>
system that allows parents to educate their children at home. Since then, <br/>
a total of 50 families, either dissatisfied with the cramming style of <br/>
school education, fearing the spread of drugs among students or trying to <br/>
keep closer contact between family members, have started teaching their <br/>
children at home.<br/>
<br/>
Yutthachai Chalermchai, a 45-year-old magazine editor who works from his <br/>
home in Bangkunon, 20 kilometers south of Bangkok, is one of the <br/>
pioneering parents. His two sons, 14-year-old Saipan and 12-year-old <br/>
Sarntor, decided in May to study at home instead of going to school.<br/>

THE RISING PRICE OF KNOWLEDGE<br/>
<br/>
Hikes in university fees have China&#39;s students worried<br/>
<br/>
BEIJING -- It should have been party time on the bright summer day <br/>
18-year-old Li Junliang was accepted by prestigious Beijing University. <br/>
Fewer than one in 10 of China&#39;s students places at any of the country&#39;s <br/>
crowded colleges and universities, let alone the Oxford University of <br/>
China. But the acceptance letter sparked little in the way of celebration <br/>
in the Li family home.<br/>
<br/>
Staring at the long list of fees to pay, including those for tuition, <br/>
books, accommodation and insurance, Li&#39;s parents despaired of ever being <br/>
able to raise the needed $850 a year. On an annual income of barely $300, <br/>
the farming couple from Fangshan County, south of Beijing, are already <br/>
supporting Li&#39;s elder brother at university.<br/>
<br/>
The Li family is one of tens of thousands of Chinese families struggling <br/>
to meet the spiraling costs of higher education. For decades, free <br/>
education was one of the ruling Communist Party&#39;s proudest boasts, but in <br/>
recent years the government has moved toward a more market-oriented <br/>
approach. University tuition fees have climbed steadily since free <br/>
education　was abolished in 1997.<br/>

and lower the age of criminal liability.<br/>
<br/>
The bill was supported by the tripartite ruling coalition as well as <br/>
opposition members from　the Democratic Party of Japan and the Liberal <br/>

STIFF JUVENILE BILL ADVANCES IN DIET<br/>
<br/>
The Lower House passed an amendment to the Juvenile Law on Tuesday that <br/>
would impose tougher　penalties on youthful offenders and lower the age <br/>
of criminal responsibility to 14, from 16　now.<br/>
<br/>
Under the proposed legislation, family courts would generally hand over <br/>
cases for prosecution　of anyone above the age of 16 who intentionally <br/>
commits crimes resulting in death. The law　would also allow relatives of <br/>
crime victims to see and copy pertinent documents and to make　statements <br/>
in family court hearings.<br/>

LOWER HOUSE PASSES BILL TO REVISE JUVENILE LAW<br/>
<br/>
A bill for a sweeping revision of the Juvenile Law, including a new <br/>
provision to lower the　minimum age at which juveniles can face criminal <br/>
punishment to 14 from the current 16, passed　the House of <br/>
Representatives at its Tuesday plenary session.<br/>
<br/>
The three ruling coalition parties -- the Liberal Democratic Party, New <br/>
Komeito and Hoshuto (New Conservative Party) -- submitted the bill <br/>
primarily with the aim of toughening legal deterrents to serious juvenile <br/>
crimes in the wake of a series of serious offenses by minors.<br/>

LAW TOO SOFT FOR VICTIM&#39;S MOTHER<br/>
<br/>
The Juvenile Law, which is on the verge of revision for the first time in <br/>
a half century, will have its focus shifted from protecting juvenile <br/>
offenders to making them take responsibility for serious crimes.<br/>
<br/>
The bereaved families of victims of juvenile offenders, however, seem to <br/>
feel that the proposed revision to the law does not go far enough.<br/>
<br/>
....Kyoko Iijima, the mother of one victim of juvenile crime, has been <br/>
demanding that the law be revised further to incorporate the demands of <br/>
the victims&#39; side in general.<br/>
<br/>
Iijima is a 43-year-old Saitama Prefecture homemaker. Her 15-year-old son <br/>
was beaten to death by a group of teenage boys in Gumma Prefecture in May <br/>
last year.<br/>

TOXIC SPERM-KILLER FOUND IN BABIES<br/>
<br/>
Large concentrations of a highly toxic chemical, which is believed to <br/>
damage sperm and cause other defects, has been detected in the umbilical <br/>
cords of 60 percent of tested newborns, it was reported Tuesday at an <br/>
Environment Agency panel.<br/>
<br/>
It was the first time ever that the substance, diethylhexyl phthalate <br/>
(DEHP), which is used to soften resins such as plastics, was found in the <br/>
umbilical cords of newborns.     <br/>

CHILD ABUSE CASES RISE BY 70 PERCENT<br/>
<br/>
A record 11,631 cases of child abuse were reported in fiscal 1999, an <br/>
increase of 70 percent from the previous year, according to a Health and <br/>
Welfare Ministry report released Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Ministry officials attributed part of this increase to rising public <br/>
awareness of the problem, which prompted more people to inform child <br/>
counseling centers of previously unreported child abuse cases.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But it is also undeniable that the sheer number of child abuse cases in <br/>
Japan is increasing,&quot; one official said.<br/>
