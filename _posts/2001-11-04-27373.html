The regulations clearly indicate that the outline and material list is <br/>
for informational purposes only. The purpose is only to show that you <br/>
have one. I spend approx. 5 mins each year, correcting dates, <br/>
printing, addressing, and mailing our notification. Our assessment is <br/>
a lunch with a friend (home ed mom and certified teacher) who fills <br/>
out a form stating the following one sentence:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I hereby indicate that a portfolio of samples of __________________&#39;s <br/>
work has been reviewed and that _________________________&#39;s academic <br/>
progress for this year, 20__, is in accordance with ________________&#39;s <br/>
abilities.&quot;<br/>

that the pro-school folks didn&#39;t brave the snow. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Charter schools here are simply electronic classrooms. There is <br/>
certainly more freedom than traditional public schools but the funding <br/>
source is still tax based and the content and approval control is <br/>
still based within the school. At all levels, public, private, charter <br/>
and home ed, one can say that the parent is in control because the <br/>
parent chose that option. And yes, each level has regulation of some <br/>
kind in *most* states. I guess I don&#39;t see the level of regulation as <br/>
a determining factor. I question who&#39;s paying for your choice and who <br/>
controls the content. And again, I guess I get stuck on the legal <br/>
definition.<br/>
<br/>
As for those that do not notify, they are truant and still compelled <br/>
to go to school, still students in the system as far as the law is <br/>
concerned. A dangerous place to be in Ohio these days. While I&#39;d love <br/>
to be free of even the notification process, I hear too often of <br/>
children services and local districts flushing out truants these days. <br/>
All they need is 5 days unexcused to press charges and jail parents. <br/>
Not a risk I&#39;m willing to take.<br/>
<br/>
in peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053796805">This was in response to someone else, Chris I think, who said that you <br/>
could only call yourself a homeschooler if you did it according to the law <br/>
in your state regarding official homeschoolers.  I was only pointing out <br/>
that by law, she had to provide more information about her *legal* <br/>
homeschooling than I did on a public program.  It seemed pretty silly that <br/>
I couldn&#39;t consider myself a homeschooler when I was doing essentially the <br/>
same as she was, just accepting some of our tax money back to benefit our kid.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, they are in control of *where* the child learns.  Certainly the parents <br/>
have no say in what is learned in regular public or private school.  To me <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean that the parent is in control.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, let&#39;s throw in another monkey wrench.  In BC, *private schools* get <br/>
public funding.  That ought to rot your libertarian socks.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The schools that hire certified teachers and follow the BC curriculum get <br/>
half funding per student.  There is another level of funding where the <br/>
school is working to meet the provincial standards and gets a smaller <br/>
percentage.  And a private school can still operate without any <br/>
restrictions if they don&#39;t take funding.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t saying that you should take that risk.  It&#39;s just that you didn&#39;t <br/>
seem to include people who were homeschooling underground in your <br/>
definition of homeschoolers.<br/>
