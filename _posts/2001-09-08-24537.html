must say we have limited the content, mainly because of our values, beliefs <br/>
and several books I&#39;ve read on children and television.  One specifically by <br/>
Michael Medved...  Some days he&#39;ll watch nothing and other days he wants to <br/>
watch several hours worth of tapes or something on PBS.  We do offer him <br/>
choices such as the Walking with Dinosaurs or if there is a subject he&#39;s <br/>
really interested in at the moment I search the tv guide to see if I can find <br/>
something about that subject.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s not completely unschooling to not let my 6 year old watch Howard <br/>
Stern and his naked women on E, but I think I can live with that (LOL)<br/>
