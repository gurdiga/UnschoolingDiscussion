this is a morality issue, not a legal one.&nbsp; No matter my personal beliefs 
about the issue of abortion, I absolutely do not support the legislation of 
morality-for any reason, in any case. For me, the abortion issue fits right in 
there with the separation of church and state, and should remain so.&nbsp; I 
feel that women should have a choice to do what they will based upon their 
spiritual beliefs.&nbsp; Likewise, I feel that father&#39;s should have every right 
to bar an abortion based upon their spiritual beliefs.&nbsp;(Family court can 
duke it out-may the highest priced lawyer win.) And also, I do not believe there 
should be state or federal funding for abortions because it is a moral 
issue--with the exception of&nbsp;a poor health status of the unborn baby and/or 
mother.&nbsp; In that case, it becomes a health issue-which is not always 
related to morality.</span></font></div>

Some people object to war as a moral issue.  They&#39;re allowed to get out of<br/>

<br/>
As I said to David, the requirements of a society to ensure safety and<br/>
property take precedence over most kinds of private morality; hence the U.S.<br/>
government&#39;s continued use of coscientious objectors tax dollars to support<br/>
the offices of defense is seen to support the good of the many.  A little<br/>
bit off topic, but, one could see this as a buy off.  A U.S. citizen has the<br/>
right to avoid military service because he/she pays his taxes.  That&#39;s how I<br/>
personally perceive my choice to homeschool.  I&#39;ll gladly pay the education<br/>
tax, even though I don&#39;t use the monies for my own kids&#39; education.  In a<br/>
sense I feel it legitimizes my right to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
Now, where I made the leap from one to the other is up for debate.  I can&#39;t<br/>
quite figure out my logic! :-) Give me some time-I think I can work it out!<br/>
Maybe! ;-P<br/>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Lucida Sans" size="2"><em>The thing about 
adoption:&nbsp; When it on average runs the adoptive parents $16,000, it weeds 
out the people being able to pay these enormous amounts!&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people 
would adopt, but cannot due to these types of problems.&nbsp;But, loving people 
*are* out there.&nbsp; About foster care:&nbsp; foster care is when a child is 
removed from a bad situation, and put into the care of another 
family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most children that go into foster care do not 
necessarily end up in juvenile detention centers.&nbsp; Children that go to juv. 
det. centers are there for discipline reasons.&nbsp; That is not the same as 
foster care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One does not equal the other.&nbsp; Many children 
end up in juv. det. centers that never have been in foster care.&nbsp; They do 
not necessarily go hand in hand.&nbsp; Adoption does not necessarily go hand in 
hand with foster care, either.&nbsp; Being an adoptive mother, I know what our 
birth mom went through.&nbsp; It is such a shame that the law (in our state) 
prevented us from&nbsp; financially paying her bills.&nbsp; Here she was, making 
the decision to give life to her unborn child, and was basically getting&nbsp; 
slapped on the wrist for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We couldn&#39;t legally buy her groceries, 
clothing, or anything else.&nbsp; We could legally visit with her, and take her 
out to dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it might have been easier,&nbsp; and more 
convenient for her to have had an abortion.&nbsp; But she took responsibility 
for her actions, and decided to find parents, and give her child a future.&nbsp; 
To me, that is very admirable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynda, I understand how tragic it 
must have been for you to have seen what that poor baby went through.&nbsp; 
Instead of focusing on abortion as having been the answer,&nbsp; perhaps the 
focus should be on preventing pregnancy in the first place.&nbsp; Clearly, that 
woman had major problems.&nbsp; The child was the victim, but not the 
problem.&nbsp; Having aborted him would not have changed the woman.&nbsp; She 
would likely still be relying on abortion as birth control, instead of being 
more responsible in preventing an unwanted pregnancy.&nbsp; But she did have 
options.&nbsp; It&#39;s legal-- so why did she not choose to abort?&nbsp; She did 
not have to have this child.&nbsp; She chose to.&nbsp; She is the problem.&nbsp; 
She is the one who needed to be dealt with.&nbsp; Clearly, those in *power* made 
a horrible decision in returning this baby into&nbsp; the monstrous 
environment&nbsp; from which he came.&nbsp; They&nbsp;, then, played a part in 
this tragedy, too.&nbsp; For all we know, this woman may have had a history of 
mental illness.&nbsp; Abortion, to me,&nbsp; would not have been the answer, 
because it would not have changed the mental capacity of this woman.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The child deserved more... from the people who impacted his short life.&nbsp; He 
was like a sprouted seedling, with a hunger for life.&nbsp; He deserved the same 
chances that we all want for our own children.&nbsp; After his own mother abused 
him, the legal system let him down, too.&nbsp; Who knows where he might be today 
if the situation had been handled correctly?&nbsp; ~Karen</em></font></div>

No one is going to make anyone more responsible, that is the point.  You<br/>
can&#39;t legislate morality, you can&#39;t legislate responsibility.  But taking<br/>
away options because a group decides it isn&#39;t moral and wants to force<br/>

The thing about adoption:  When it on average runs the adoptive parents<br/>
$16,000, it weeds out the people being able to pay these enormous amounts! <br/>
 Many people would adopt, but cannot due to these types of problems. But,<br/>
loving people *are* out there.  About foster care:  foster care is when a<br/>
child is removed from a bad situation, and put into the care of another<br/>
family.   Most children that go into foster care do not necessarily end up<br/>
in juvenile detention centers.  Children that go to juv. det. centers are<br/>
there for discipline reasons.  That is not the same as foster care.    One<br/>
does not equal the other.  Many children end up in juv. det. centers that<br/>
never have been in foster care.  They do not necessarily go hand in hand. <br/>
Adoption does not necessarily go hand in hand with foster care, either. <br/>
Being an adoptive mother, I know what our birth mom went through.  It is<br/>
such a shame that the law (in our state) prevented us from  financially<br/>
paying her bills.  Here she was, making the decision to give life to her<br/>
unborn child, and was basically getting  slapped on the wrist for it.   We<br/>
couldn&#39;t legally buy her groceries, clothing, or anything else.  We could<br/>
legally visit with her, and take her out to dinner.    Yes, it might have<br/>
been easier,  and more convenient for her to have had an abortion.  But she<br/>
took responsibility for her actions, and decided to find parents, and give<br/>
her child a future.  To me, that is very admirable.   Lynda, I understand<br/>
how tragic it must have been for you to have seen what that poor baby went<br/>
through.  Instead of focusing on abortion as having been the answer, <br/>
perhaps the focus should be on preventing pregnancy in the first place. <br/>
Clearly, that woman had major problems.  The child was the victim, but not<br/>
the problem.  Having aborted him would not have changed the woman.  She<br/>
would likely still be relying on abortion as birth control, instead of<br/>
being more responsible in preventing an unwanted pregnancy.  But she did<br/>
have options.  It&#39;s legal-- so why did she not choose to abort?  She did<br/>
not have to have this child.  She chose to.  She is the problem.  She is<br/>
the one who needed to be dealt with.  Clearly, those in *power* made a<br/>
horrible decision in returning this baby into  the monstrous environment <br/>
from which he came.  They , then, played a part in this tragedy, too.  For<br/>
all we know, this woman may have had a history of mental illness. <br/>
Abortion, to me,  would not have been the answer, because it would not have<br/>
changed the mental capacity of this woman.   The child deserved more...<br/>
from the people who impacted his short life.  He was like a sprouted<br/>
seedling, with a hunger for life.  He deserved the same chances that we all<br/>
want for our own children.  After his own mother abused him, the legal<br/>
system let him down, too.  Who knows where he might be today if the<br/>
situation had been handled correctly?  ~Karen<br/>

  There is no shortage of people to adopt perfect babies.  If there were no<br/>
  shortage of people to adopt babies then there wouldn&#39;t be so many babies<br/>
in<br/>
  foster care that end up transitioned into a permanent go round of foster<br/>
  care to group homes to foster care to juvenile detention centers and the<br/>
  merry-go-round continues.<br/>

I want to respond by saying that recent research says that an IUD makes the<br/>
uterus so hostile to sperm that they can&#39;t survive, so it is unlikely that<br/>
conception happens. Birth control pills work in making the woman taking them<br/>
annovulatory, so no conception happens because there is no ovulation.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, we don&#39;t need to go down the flame filled road of debating<br/>
abortion on this group. Let&#39;s get back to talking about unschooling, even<br/>
though everything is potentially something to learn from.<br/>

<br/>
I have been deleting all of the &#39;our bodies&#39; posts not wanting to get into<br/>
an argument, but now I have a question. I am on Depo shots which claim to<br/>
put your ovaries into a resting state, which is why most women don&#39;t get<br/>
their periods, myself included (fine with me). My question is if the pill<br/>
does the same, how come one still gets their period while taking it. I<br/>
understand that you don&#39;t take it (or only take sugar pills) for days 21-28<br/>
and that&#39;s what induces your period, but what is your body flushing out if<br/>
not the egg? Is it simply the built up lining of the uterus? How come it<br/>
doesn&#39;t happen on depo?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050289663">Global warming has not been shown to be a fact. The media loves a good scare<br/>
story and there are always scientist ready to extrapolate from limited data.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the models used for calculating the effects of green house gases do<br/>
not take into account cloud cover as it makes the calculations too complex.<br/>
If you&#39;ve ever been outside on a cloudy day, you&#39;ve experienced how the<br/>
clouds can affect the amount of the sun&#39;s heat that reaches the earth. As<br/>
CO2 levels rise, studies by the US Dept of Agriculture show that crop yields<br/>
increase 30 to 40% and the plants become twice as efficient in using water.<br/>
Increased biomass from plant growth removes CO2 from the air and locks it up<br/>
in the plants.<br/>
<br/>
From 1940 to 1975 the general cooling of the earth caused reporters to<br/>
trumpet the impending coming of the next ice age. A warming trend occurred<br/>
between 1975 and 1980 (well within the range of natural fluctuations) and<br/>
there has been little change since then, but the current fashion now is to<br/>
warn of global warming.<br/>
<br/>
_The Greening of Planet Earth_ produced by the Institute for Biospheric<br/>
Research and _The Next 500 years: Life in the Coming Millennium_ by Adrian<br/>
Berry provide some interesting details about the lack of consensus in the<br/>
scientific community about global warming.<br/>

&gt; Research can show all it wants but that doesn&#39;t change what<br/>
&gt; some people<br/>
&gt; believe.  I stated &quot;they believe.&quot;  Falwell stated on<br/>
&gt; national television<br/>
&gt; that the greehouse effect and the hole in the ozone layer were &quot;just a<br/>
&gt; myth.&quot;  That&#39;s what he believes even though studies have<br/>
&gt; shown them to be a<br/>
&gt; fact.<br/>
