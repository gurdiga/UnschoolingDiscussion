<div id="ygrps-yiv-135635677">Hi Debbi <br/>
Thats for asking is was on Monday and I had sent the kids to a <br/>
friends house and only had the 12yo here so they were not happy but I <br/>
told them I will not put the little ones through seeing that lady <br/>
again. Even though they were not here they heard me say she was <br/>
coming and that is why I had to leave them somewhere else and the 3 <br/>
yo did not want to come back home she was scared. Anyway they needed <br/>
to set up a meeting for Monday the 17th for the new lady Tania to <br/>
meet them with out the first people there. I am trying to find <br/>
someone to be with them when she questions them because I will not <br/>
let them do that again. It was amazing how many more lies came out at <br/>
that meeting they are now trying to say that I make even my 9 and 12 <br/>
year olds go for naps for 3-5hours every day and that I do not do <br/>
anything that is a mothers reponsibly that I make my kids do it and <br/>
so on. And my 5yo go a toy guitar and hit the 3yo in the eye and gave <br/>
her a black eye I do not think it will be gone by Monday and I can <br/>
just imagine what they will say about that. They still have not gave <br/>
me anything in writing but say they will be doing several surprise <br/>
and set-up meetings. I want to take them to court to stop this <br/>
because everyone including us say this is unjustified.<br/>
Thanks for listening<br/>
Jackie</div>
