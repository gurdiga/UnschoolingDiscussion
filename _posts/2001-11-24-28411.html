<div id="ygrps-yiv-323506506">Unschooling can be challenging. We are surrounded by people, schoolers and <br/>
homeschoolers, looking at us funny because it doesn&#39;t seem to be something <br/>
that could possibly work.  Even if deep in our hearts we know this is right, <br/>
sometimes we get very scared, and have very hard times believing it ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
We need all the support we can get. I know that for me this list has been <br/>
wonderful because in addition to being supported as an unschooling family, we <br/>
have also received support as a Lesbian family. <br/>
<br/>
We have recently had a big loss with the closing of Growing Without <br/>
Schooling.  I think losing Sandra Dodd to this list is another big loss to <br/>
many of us, and I hope she will reconsider. (I have sent a copy of this to <br/>
Sandra.) Certainly she challenges us, and she is not always gentle. Not all <br/>
of us agree with everything she says, or some of us, ANYTHING she says.  But <br/>
she make us think, and she makes us try to be our best Selves with our <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that has meant a lot to me is her willinness to be upfront <br/>
with her own fears. Recently she talked about being psyched and RELIEVED when <br/>
one of her children started reading a long novel. She is honest that <br/>
sometimes this &quot;trusting children&quot; is hard on the parent.<br/>
<br/>
I urge anyone who has been challenged by Sandra (or anyone else) to take a <br/>
breath before responding. First, consider whether you were clear in your <br/>
original communication. If the comments or criticisms seem very off-base, <br/>
perhaps you have not made yourself as clear as you meant to.  Second, <br/>
consider what might be true in the challenge. Maybe you can get something <br/>
from it.  Finally, try not to respond defensively. It&#39;s okay to shrug and <br/>
say, &quot;This is what MY family needs.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We need all the support we can get. Sandra, I do hope you will re-join us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-179723559">I havent been on this list long enough to form an opinion, except that I<br/>
think its a shame theres this kind of strife.<br/>
<br/>
Id hate to see this list go under, whether slowly or precipitously,<br/>
especially since I just recently came to it because of Growing Without<br/>
Schoolings demise. I wouldnt want an exclusive, invitation-only list to<br/>
sap the strength of this one. I appreciate what people do to keep this list<br/>
going  this means you, Helen Hegener, and anybody else Im not aware of.<br/>
<br/>
Im going to try to contribute some new threads with interesting content. I<br/>
dont know what else I can do.<br/>
