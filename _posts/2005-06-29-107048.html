<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035343183">Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if anyone can tell me how to apply unschooling to an 18 year <br/>
old&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
My stepson has just moved here from France and we are overjoyed to have him <br/>
living with us.<br/>
I am not sure how to be a good &quot;facilitator&quot; whilst living in suburbia <br/>
presently as opposed to our original home in Manhattan - the Mecca of culture and <br/>
open minds.<br/>
<br/>
He is picking up the language lightning quick and he&#39;s really really gifted <br/>
with computers.<br/>
<br/>
He was recently on his own in France and living a bit of party life and he <br/>
says he would like to live healthier now (his words: &quot;I&#39;ve ripened&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
He was kicked out of one private school once for getting caught with pot and <br/>
didn&#39;t have a very happy experience at the next private school.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking he needed to deschool (and may need to do more).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have much experience in this area....other than me being a teen <br/>
myself once who partied a bit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At 18 he&#39;s an adult, living life is living life - &quot;schooling&quot; no <br/>
longer plays any role in it but learning is large. What does he want <br/>
to do? Play &#39;tour guide&#39; - go explore your neighborhood, town, <br/>
nearby city, state, etc. Go to those places you&#39;ve said &quot;I really <br/>
should go there one of these days&quot; - even if it&#39;s simply to see a <br/>
giant ball of twine in a town 30 minutes away. If you&#39;re even -near- <br/>
a metro area, take mass transit in to the city. Take him to the <br/>
market and let him pick out ingredients for a dish he&#39;d like to cook <br/>
for you; go to an ethnic market and together pick out stuff to make <br/>
something new and interesting; start an evening walk habit or a <br/>
morning walk habit or a hike at a nearby nature reserve on Saturdays <br/>
(since he is wanting to live a more healthy style try to include <br/>
good eating and getting out and moving). If he was in metro areas, <br/>
and you used to be in metro areas, exploring suburbia, parks, etc. <br/>
is a whole new thing... go watch a softball game or a Little League <br/>
game or whatever. Maybe he&#39;d want to get involved in a parks & rec <br/>
soccer league.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a hint as to where you are geographically now (did you move to <br/>
upstate in NY, NJ suburbs (northern or southern?), someplace else?) <br/>
could help folks brainstorm ideas of stuff that is in your area.<br/>
