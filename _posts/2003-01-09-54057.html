<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950800457">&lt;&lt;Why should I make them take on MY priority?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes though I think it is that Mom gets stuck taking on the kids&#39;<br/>
priorities.  At least I used to.  I am by no means a neat freak.  But I have<br/>
5 kids under 13, 4 dogs, 27 chickens, 6 rabbits, 6 goats, and a cat.  Things<br/>
get very messy both in the house and outside.  My kids are also very active<br/>
and need to be driven here and there (x 5), read to (x4), lunches fixed<br/>
(x4), baths given (x2), etc..<br/>
<br/>
Just to keep up with the kids stuff and to keep us from being over run with<br/>
filth (not mess, but filth), I was running full out, non-stop from 7am to 11<br/>
or 12 at night, day in and day out.  I was exhausted and I started to resent<br/>
doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I had a talk with the family about how I know that having a livable<br/>
house isn&#39;t a priority for them but to be honest, things that were important<br/>
to them weren&#39;t always a priority for me.  That I wanted to be able to take<br/>
them places and do things but all my time and energy was being taken up,<br/>
picking up after the family.  The kids understood.  I still have to ask but<br/>
rarely get a flat out refusal to help, although I often get offers to help<br/>
in ways other than what I&#39;ve suggested.  Example:  Adriane, would you please<br/>
fold that basket of clothes?  Yuck.  How about I give Michelle a bath<br/>
instead?  Great thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042022860"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;  If they are old enough to cook, they are old enough to clean up after<br/>
&gt; themselves, and its only common courtesy. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, but is that what you model for them?  Because when I cook, I don&#39;t clean<br/>
up.  Not right after I finish, at least.  Sometimes I do it a couple hours<br/>
later after I sit down and rest a bit.  Sometimes (like dinner cooking) my<br/>
husband and I do it together after Tim&#39;s gone to his room for the evening.<br/>
And sometimes my husband does the cleanup because I cooked and I&#39;m tierd.<br/>
<br/>
When you make a statement like that, I can&#39;t tell if you mean that you<br/>
expect it to happen right away.  But that&#39;s exactly what my mother said, and<br/>
she meant immediately after, if not as you go.  You might consider whether<br/>
your children would clean up, but not in the time frame you expect.  That<br/>
may be part of your issue.<br/>
<br/>
Until my Mom got sick, I didn&#39;t like to cook, because I never got the house<br/>
clean to her standards in a short enough time afterwards.  It wasn&#39;t until<br/>
she was sick and there wasn&#39;t anybody else with the time to cook and bake<br/>
that I did a lot of cooking and discovered I like it.<br/>
