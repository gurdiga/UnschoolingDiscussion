 </span></blockquote>LOL.  My dh and I &quot;try&quot; to go out on Saturday nights.  Sometimes the kids <br/>
stay with my MIL, other times they go to a drop in child care center.  If we <br/>
don&#39;t go to a movie, we end spending the whole time talking about the kids, <br/>
too!  So, I&#39;m trying really really hard not to.  But, when your life is your <br/>
kids . . . actually I think he&#39;d rather talk about the kids than about my <br/>
latest crochet project.  <br/>
