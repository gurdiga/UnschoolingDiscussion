Filey :-)  Lovely place, basically a town with a great <br/>
beach, instead of a &#39;resort&#39; iykwim.  It&#39;s between <br/>
Bridlington and Scarborough on the N Yorks (well E <br/>
Yorks) coast.  Scarborough&#39;s close enough for theme-<br/>
parks and funfairs and stuff, though in my &#39;delicate&#39; <br/>
condition I wasn&#39;t gonna go on any rides.  there&#39;s this <br/>
great place called Kinderland, which is basically a <br/>
great big playground space, different kinds of swings <br/>
and slides and climing frames, see-saws, rocking-horses <br/>
and stuff, along with pedal go-karts and roller-skate <br/>
rink and crazy-golf...  oh and a water-slide boat.  <br/>
great fun, and nothing too strenuous :-)  But we like <br/>
Filey cos the beach is better and the town&#39;s so nice.  <br/>
We basically picnicked in the park for lunch and did <br/>
stuff afterwards cos it was too hot most days to be out <br/>
on the beach any earlier.  The rock-pool thing we did <br/>
after eating fish-and-chips out of the paper on the <br/>
cliff-top before donning boots to go down the &#39;Brigg.&#39;  <br/>
We had a really great time :-)<br/>

Holly and I went to Bridlington last summer.  We would have kept going, but <br/>
she was tired of the train so we got out and stayed.  They allow <br/>
kid-gambling, so she played lots with the 2p &quot;pushers&quot; and we have some <br/>
refrigerator magnets we won there.  <br/>

Ah!  Filey.<br/>
I went there a few times as a kid. We mostly went to Bridlington. <br/>
Ahhhhhh, (sigh) we always went for a trip on one of those boats that <br/>
took you out of the harbour for about 30mins.  Do they still do that?<br/>
We would spend half the day on the beach, and have a ride on a <br/>
donkey!  Are the donkeys still there?  Go to the same little cafe for <br/>
lunch - and buy a stick of bridlington rock, before catching the <br/>
train home.........memories.<br/>

We went to Brid every year from being 10 to about 14.  <br/>
I got very proficient at one particular video game <br/>
called Ladybug and spent lots and lots of time on the <br/>
2p &#39;pushers&#39; LOL  The kids like those too, and we won <br/>
some stuff, but not as much as A would have liked.  Ah, <br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re mesmerizing.<br/>
<br/>
Here they have them, but not with toys on top, and the coins are quarters (in <br/>
casinos) or tokens (which cost a quarter, which is a bunch of Brit <br/>
money---how much?  35p? )<br/>
<br/>
By it being tokens, it&#39;s not gambling.  Some machines just give you tokens <br/>
back, some give you paper tickets worth cheapo &quot;prizes&quot; and the tokens just <br/>
go back into the cycle.<br/>
<br/>
But in England, the coins are about the size of a quarter, but only two <br/>
English pennies (less than two American cents) AND the good part:  Here we <br/>
put a paper dollar in and get four tokens.  There, you put in a little dollar <br/>
coin in the changer and get fifty BIG 2p pieces.  You feel like you&#39;ve won <br/>
already!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yes, they still have the boat-trips, the Yorkshire <br/>
Belle and the other one...  and the little trains that <br/>
run up the road to Sowerby House, did you ever go on <br/>
those?  On Filey beach they have ponies now, though <br/>
there were some maudlin-looking donkeys in a field <br/>
nearby when dh and I camped there BC...  Got drunk and <br/>
sunburnt and sick from eating too much cream-cake!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I dunno about Scarborough, really, we only ever go to <br/>
the Sea-Life Centre (H was saying &#39;it&#39;s just like the <br/>
rock-pool display at the Sea-Life Centre when we were <br/>
out on the Brigg&#39; I had to say &#39;yes, but this is <br/>
real...&#39; and Kinderland, and this really nice Italian <br/>
restaurant where dh felt completely happy about taking <br/>
an extremely grubby child, on the basis that they&#39;d be <br/>
happy to see a kid who&#39;d obviously been enjoying <br/>
herself...<br/>
<br/>
We even got into a really nice routine of dh taking the <br/>
girls out shopping for lunch in the morning, then doing <br/>
a picnic before doing stuff later on, I&#39;m gonna miss <br/>
having him around so much I think.  Ah, well...<br/>

Scary, isn&#39;t it?  We now have the problem that dd2 won <br/>
on one and thinks she&#39;ll win every time, of course she <br/>

Yeah, and I really stress about holidays before I go <br/>
too.  So it was really nice to not feel under any kind <br/>
of pressure and just be able to get on and do things at <br/>
our own pace.  I think in the past I&#39;ve taken on a lot <br/>
of the burden of responsibility so that dh can have his <br/>
r&r, but cos I&#39;m preggie he did more stuff with the <br/>
girls than last year :-)  I knew there was an advantage <br/>
