<div id="ygrps-yiv-459688932">A mandatory chicken pox vaccination is completely bonkers! My mother and her <br/>
generation have loomed over me with the fears of polio...&quot;Have you ever seen <br/>
a kid hooked up to an iron lung?!?!&quot;<br/>
But chicken pox? The logic escapes me. <br/>
I live in Indiana and I&#39;ve met a few people who&#39;ve lived in Oregon who <br/>
consider it to be a very &#39;aware&#39; place. I guess that awareness isn&#39;t in the <br/>
medical community.<br/>
I didn&#39;t know it was mandatory anywhere.  That&#39;s really scary to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725401321">&quot;mandatory&quot;  in Texas too for pupils born after a certain year.   Supposed to<br/>
show either date of immunization or a documented history of having chickenpox<br/>
(month, DAY, and year!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590754840">I hate to add this to the conversation, but from what I have learned about <br/>
this vaccination, it includes tissue from babies that have been aborted.  I <br/>
would never give this to any child.  <br/>
