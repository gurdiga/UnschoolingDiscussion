<div id="ygrps-yiv-163061129">Aloha again!<br/>
This post also caught my eye! Joy&#39;s situation with her son is so similiar<br/>
to mine with my youngest son, Bay. He is virtually uninterested in any solo<br/>
endeavors - period. . . unless they are on the computer or TV - which I<br/>
also feel strongly about not having be major factors in our lives here.<br/>
What concerns me (other than having him say he is bored whenever the action<br/>
stops!) is that I feel being able to entertain oneself or spend time in<br/>
solitude is an important facet to be developed in each of us. My two older<br/>
children rarely even considered being bored - always able to pick up a<br/>
book, a blank journal, a musical instrument, a basket of legos, whatever -<br/>
and be engaged. They both seem to be more &quot;balanced&quot; in being able to spend<br/>
time alone/time with others. Bay is engaged mostly with other people (any<br/>
age or sex or size will do!) or in movement (skateboarding, trampoline<br/>
jumping, surfing, dirt biking, yard work etc) . . . preferably both people<br/>
and movement at the same time! I might mention that the only other major<br/>
thing that will keep his interest is being read to or listening to a story<br/>
tape . . . which he will do for hours. So, consequently, Bay&#39;s learning<br/>
takes the shape of . . . weed whack the property or ride a friend&#39;s dirt<br/>
bike or fix it, or surf, or listen to story tapes or bake cookies with Nell<br/>
(his older sister), or jump on the trampoline, or listen to pop music, or<br/>
draw while listening to music, or complain that all his friends are in<br/>
school and there is no one to play with, or invent games with Sky (his<br/>
older brother), or try to master the typing program on the computer, or<br/>
watch &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy,&quot; or count his money from his various jobs<br/>
to see if he has enough to buy his own dirt bike,  or skateboard, or jump<br/>
on the pogo-stick, or watch Mary Martin in Peter Pan for the 12th time or<br/>
etc. Now, I know, in my heart, that this IS learning - but, still there are<br/>
those pauses between activity that always bring the same &quot;Mom, what can I<br/>
do?&quot; whine/lament. . . which makes my teeth itch! I can make suggestions<br/>
galore - but usually it is not met with acceptance. . . unless someone else<br/>
gets involved. Is this rambling doing anyone any good, except me?! So, I,<br/>
too - am interested in what responses we get on this precious list to Joy&#39;s<br/>
post. By the way, I had pondered the possibility that Bay was inclined this<br/>
way because of having two older siblings at home, and a home with three<br/>
home businesses and lots of action constantly. . . but here Joy is with a<br/>
son without that and the same mantra!?<br/>
Thank you all for this thought-provoking and caring list.<br/>
Love, Lee<br/>

What a wonderful reply--your Bay sounds SOOO much like Jackson!   --- <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What concerns me (other than having him say he is bored whenever the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this so much, yet I feel that forcing independence is a<br/>
true misnomer!  No such thing!  I keep trying to learn new things that<br/>
do excite him, so many of which are the same as those you listed (our<br/>
sons&#39; learning styles must be simpatico!) to &quot;pull out&quot; as a<br/>
suggestion when I hear the mantra...<br/>
<br/>
Bay is engaged mostly with other people (any<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and movement at the same time! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and yes!  That&#39;s us too!<br/>
<br/>
I might mention that the only other major<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thing that will keep his interest is being read to or listening to a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>story<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tape . . . which he will do for hours.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  We just read the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings together<br/>
and now I am making cds of the Tow Towers for us all to listen to...he<br/>
has always had so much interest in being spoken/read to, which I don&#39;t<br/>
mind.  Books on tape/cd are invaluable because we can be hearing a<br/>
story together and also I can be getting some work done, etc.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is this rambling doing anyone any good, except me?! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!  I thought for a minute from the responses that no one<br/>
else ever dealt with this!<br/>
<br/>
I guess they have a mixed interpersonal/kinesthetic learning style! <br/>
You know, i think when he is a bit older it will be somewhat easier<br/>
b/c at this point he is too &quot;little&quot; to &quot;go off&quot; and do things<br/>
alone...How old is Bay?  If he could ride his bike across town to the<br/>
nature preserve I bet I&#39;d hear  &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; a lot less, but at eight<br/>
in town we still have to consider safety as a primary concern!  (Older<br/>
siblings would actually help in this regard!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Lee!<br/>
<br/>
Much love,<br/>
<br/>
Joy<br/>
