entirely optional.  Don&#39;t worry, though:  I have the damn good sense to <br/>
leave my clothes ON because I don&#39;t want to frighten anyone, but Liam and <br/>
his friends have the damn good sense to go around &quot;nekkid&quot; when that&#39;s <br/>
called for.   I have a real funny swimming-naked-in-the-pool story, though, <br/>
that I&#39;ll tell you when I see you!  (Gee, now that I think of it, I have a <br/>
few!)<br/>
