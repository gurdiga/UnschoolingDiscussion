Yes, but leaving them to hang out and learn brail on their own as babies is <br/>
not likely to work out as well as it worked with my kids learning to read <br/>

&lt;&lt;IMHO (LOL) a child with significant disabilities has all the more<br/>

I&#39;m not saying they can&#39;t be homeschooled better than they could be put in a <br/>

some of what they will need to know won&#39;t be things the people at their house <br/>
already happen to know.<br/>
<br/>
This is not so with ADD.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;A good chunk of assistive technology will solve the vocalization problem. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The equipment and how to help them learn to use it is something the family WI<br/>
LL need to get help with.<br/>
<br/>
Not so with ADD.<br/>

<br/>
When I was writing about ADD not being a disability in the way deaf/blind and <br/>
cerebral palsy was, I was talking about UNschooling very specifically.  Maybe <br/>
that was  missed.  Just plain vanilla unschooling won&#39;t cover severe <br/>
disabilities.  But ADD isn&#39;t that sort of &quot;disability&quot; (if it is one in ANY <br/>
way in an unschooling situation).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have some friends who have a daughter (now 16) with extremely profound MR. <br/>
When she was born the doctors all told them to take their daughter home, love <br/>
her, protect her and then hope for the best. If she should live beyond 3 or 4 <br/>
then they should place her in a home. It was so sad, beyond words. I never <br/>
realized until a few months ago that what our friend does with her daughter <br/>
is unschooling. She keeps documents and has a &quot;curriculum&quot; of sorts, ( <br/>
basically an outline of what she thinks will be good things to work on over a <br/>
certain period of time. Like E. D.  Hersh&#39;s books only for her MR daughter.) <br/>
because she is the type to do so, but IMO what they do is unschooling. <br/>
They play all day, they sing songs and do the laundry, they count to 10 while <br/>
running the sweeper. She now knows her alphabet, numbers to 10, she can fold <br/>
laundry, and loves to listen to her books on tape. She can also run her tape <br/>
recorder and the VCR with help. She can make simple sandwiches and fix <br/>
herself cold cereal. This girl has never been to a school. She had a woman <br/>
come out once who evaluated her, but she also recommended an institution. She <br/>
does go to special therapies several times a week and has a group of other <br/>
children like her that she enjoys going to. She can&#39;t speak very well, but <br/>
definitely knows how to get her point across. She knows her pleases and thank <br/>
yous, and has wonderful manners. She can&#39;t read, but loves books. She can <br/>
pick out clothes that match, she can&#39;t run the washing machine or dryer, but <br/>
can sort laundry, load the washer and take the clothes out of the dryer. She <br/>
has learned the importance of good hygiene and does her best to keep herself <br/>
neat. <br/>
Recently some issues with their local school district came up and our friends <br/>
reluctantly allowed their daughter to be tested. The results were that she <br/>
was untestable, recommendation: institution. Our friends conclusion? She <br/>
would have been a sad, uncared for child forgotten somewhere in an <br/>
institution (probably not even alive) if they had listened to all the people <br/>
over the years. Instead they have a happy child who contributes to the <br/>
family, is loved and loves. She would have never learned even the basics as <br/>
she has if placed somewhere. I firmly believe that unschooling can and does <br/>
work for everyone. Even a child who will never progress beyond the mental age <br/>
of 2 or 3. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But you could still read &quot;aloud&quot; to the child--showing the print and signing the<br/>
words, just as you do with a seeing child. You sign to them as babies just as you<br/>
talk to your hearing babies (harder, though, sometimes, like when you&#39;re cooking).<br/>
Take them around others who communicate the same way and will communicate with<br/>
them. Harder, yes, but the same principles apply.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True. The parents and others would have to educate themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is not so with ADD.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With kids that use alternative learning strategies, the parents also have to<br/>
educate themselves as to better and worse strategies. What the already &quot;know&quot; may<br/>
be as harmful as what they&#39;re aware of not knowing.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are differences, but the principles remain the same.</div>
