<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you were just beginning to unschool, knowing what you know<br/>
&gt; now, and you had some money to spend of fun, cool stuff, what would you buy?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing.  I don&#39;t need anything to unschool at the moment.  But I&#39;d take my<br/>
son shopping at cool stores of all sorts and see what HE wanted.  Throw out<br/>
the catalogues, and buy what interests your family.  Go to a game store at a<br/>
big mall, the kind where they have lots of games out, and try them out.  See<br/>
what they like.  <br/>
<br/>
And put at least half of what you think you might want to spend aside.<br/>
You&#39;ll need it son enough.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, what would you do for a while?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Play tourist in your own town.  Go see all the sights.  Zoo, museums, scenic<br/>
vistas, whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Go shopping.  (See above.)  Have fun playing with all the toys and games and<br/>
stuff that&#39;s out in the stores.  Decide if you&#39;d enjoy doing any of this<br/>
stuff.  Dig through all the stuff at Salvation Army and see if there&#39;s<br/>
anything good there.  (My cousin was thrilled to find a brand new fry daddy<br/>
there yesterday!  She&#39;s learning to fry donuts tonight.)  Go home and play<br/>
with all your new stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the video store.  Rent movies.  Rent games.  Go to your friends<br/>
houses.  Borrow their videos, games, and computer programs.  Decide if any<br/>
of these interest you enough to buy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would you take a good while and see what everyone wants to do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never a bad idea! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2 of my boys can barely read, and it means a LOT to them to be able to.  If<br/>
&gt; learning to read is what a child REALLY wants, would any of you get some sort<br/>
&gt; of aides or maybe computer games to help them with this?  Would you just read<br/>
&gt; a lot to them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d read to them and with them.  There are lots of computer games and<br/>
phonics teaching aides on the market, and I haven&#39;t seen a one that can do<br/>
anything I can&#39;t do.  The biggest pieces of the reading puzzle are readiness<br/>
and desire.  If they desire, but aren&#39;t ready, at least you are human enough<br/>
to understand and support them during their frustration.  If they are ready,<br/>
surely you can help them with the sounds letters make, and help them with<br/>
words that don&#39;t make the sum of their sounds (such as light, tortilla, and<br/>
the).  If you read to them and with them, reading is associated with love,<br/>
human touch, and patience.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the library and pick out great stories to read together.  Read them<br/>
big thick books like Harry Potter so they know the stories that other kids<br/>
their age know.  Spend some of that money you have at the bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re the person who has said before that your foster sons weren&#39;t<br/>
allowed to be hs&#39;ed yet.  Congrats on getting this far.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re<br/>
going to enjoy having all six of them there with you this year.<br/>

<br/>
We read a lot. Sometimes I worry that I&#39;m getting in the way of my boys<br/>
reading because I do all the reading.  I read to them for a couple of hours<br/>
at night and by the time I&#39;ve finished they are fighting to stay awake. They<br/>
used to read when I was done but going to bed later has meant they don&#39;t do<br/>
that now. And of course they are just too busy playing during the day to sit<br/>
and read.<br/>
<br/>
I just love reading to them and sharing favourite stories with them. And I<br/>
guess if there are only good associations with reading they will come to it<br/>
in their own time.<br/>
<br/>
We finished the Goblet of Fire lsat week and didn&#39;t know what to follow it<br/>
with (still waiting on Order of the Phoenix) but have started The Hobbit and<br/>
the boys are enjoying that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably. Its okay. What will really get them reading is the innate <br/>
desire to do what adults do - it&#39;ll happen. If they don&#39;t have such a <br/>
strong imperative, because they can count on you to do their reading <br/>
for them while THEY are working on other stuff  - the value of good <br/>
listening skills, for example, cannot possibly be overstated - after <br/>
all, what do you think is REALLY important in college - what do college <br/>
students spend most of their time doing? Okay, maybe partying comes <br/>
first. &lt;g&gt; But in-class time is spent listening to lectures. The <br/>
ability to learn audibly is incredibly important and I&#39;ve really <br/>
noticed that the later readers, those who have been read to extensively <br/>
and who listen a lot to audiobooks, are fabulous listeners even when <br/>
they do read on their own. You&#39;re doing them a great huge favor by not <br/>
pushing them to read on their own, but providing them with extensive <br/>
reading through listening opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be drawn in by earlier reading being better ideas. Later may very <br/>
well be far better.<br/>
