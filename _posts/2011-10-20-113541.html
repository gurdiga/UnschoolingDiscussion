<div id="ygrps-yiv-823393351">Hi there, my family and I have been making small changes in our lives toward unschooling for about a month.  I had a couple of questions if you guys could help me out I&#39;d appreciate it.   <br/>
<br/>
So far we&#39;ve gotten relaxed about tv, bedtime, chores, food, schoolwork.  When I say relaxed I mean we just stopped given instructions on what to do and how to do it and let the kids make decision about that.  So far it&#39;s gone good, I think.  My oldest son who is 10 really enjoys watching tv and movies.  Right now he&#39;s watching The Wonder Years.  He watched the whole first season yesterday and woke up this morning starting the 2nd season.  I&#39;ve talked to him about it and he likes the relationship between Kevin and Winnie and he likes watching the kids when they are at school.<br/>
<br/>
My question is what interesting things can I show him or put out for him that could help him get more of what he&#39;s looking for.  In Sandra&#39;s book she says to make it interesting.  I guess since this is new and we&#39;re just really getting to know each other on a different level I don&#39;t really know what he would find interesting so any ideas would help.<br/>
<br/>
For me that part is the hardest about unschooling.  Figuring out what would interest my kids.  They are all so different and doing things with them makes me sometimes feel like I&#39;m being pulled in 3 different directions.  I love the closeness that this way of looking at things is bringing me to my kids it&#39;s just overwhelming at first.  Any ideas on how to deal with that?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

If he&#39;s so interested in that show that he&#39;s watching one episode after another, why try to add anything?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe at some point in the next few months or a year you&#39;ll come across something that could tie in, but it should be casual, not searched out.  <br/>

You&#39;ve only been moving toward unschooling for a month.  You shouldn&#39;t be doing anything but deschooling.  Don&#39;t try to add to or manage or direct.  Just watch and think.  Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.  They&#39;ll be deschooled before you are, but nobody is deschooled in one month.<br/>
<br/>
Relax. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916112575">Ok, you&#39;re right.  He&#39;s probably getting tons of info from watching that show.  He&#39;s even asked me a few questions since watching that show like, &quot;Who is Benedict Arnold?&quot; and &quot;What does Kosher mean?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info!<br/>

<br/>
At first it&#39;s easier to see the factual things.  History.  Vocabulary.  But he&#39;s probably learning lots of things that wouldn&#39;t be taught in school or religion classes, too--things about family relationships, architecture, home furnishings. :-)<br/>

<br/>
If you feel like you&#39;re not doing enough, do more.<br/>
<br/>
If they seem bored or stuck, do more.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of answer did you think we would give?  It&#39;s a serious question.  <br/>
