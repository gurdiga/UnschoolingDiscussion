It&#39;s a great way to show we&#39;re not just a bunch of sheep who do whatever<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Why<br/>
&gt; not just buy &quot;less&quot; or buy &quot;better&quot; or &quot;smarter&quot; or whatever floats your<br/>
&gt; boat? How many people are going to actually stop buying Christmas gifts<br/>
&gt; altogether? Or is this just to get people to stop buying for that one<br/>
&gt; day...to postpone it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s sort of like two minutes of silence on Veterans Day.  It&#39;s about<br/>
stopping for a moment (a day in this case) and thinking about our value<br/>
system.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There were similar demonstations in Seattle. (hey, it was better than last<br/>
&gt; year&#39;s WTO...) But I don&#39;t see this going anywhere. People like shopping.<br/>
&gt; People like giving gifts. It&#39;s Christmassy. Why make it unenjoyable for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people who want to shop?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If anything, we made it more entertaining for those who chose to shop.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If this is fun for you and your family, well, okay. But I&#39;ll be spending<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; same amount as last year, a comfortable sum, nothing that would make or<br/>
&gt; break the economy. And I&#39;ll be out there at some point, dodging the<br/>
&gt; demonstators, enjoying my shopping trip in spite of it all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s fine.  To each his own.  I don&#39;t fault you if you don&#39;t fault me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Because it&#39;s so widely touted as the &quot;biggest shopping day of the year.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s that hunter vs. gatherer thing.<br/>
<br/>
If a store in which you were going to shop puts things on sale for one day, <br/>
that is a good day to go and buy those things.<br/>
<br/>
I got a gameboy a few years back for $30 instead of $50, for going on that <br/>
Thursday.  I was going to buy a gameboy either way.  I would&#39;ve been a dumber <br/>
sheep to wait, and a poorer sheep.<br/>
<br/>
Here there are many sales and specials on December 2.  Twenty percent off at <br/>
an art store where I buy printing supplies all the time anyway.  I *could* <br/>
protest and not go until I really need the stuff, but one thing women (and <br/>
some men, and not all women) are programmed internally and externally to do <br/>
is get good deals.  Men might be best at finding the longest-lasting freezer <br/>
or suspension system for the truck, but when it comes to buying a robe for <br/>
grandma, let the women shop.<br/>
<br/>
[I realize this is sexist and not PC, but it&#39;s real.  Changing or not, I <br/>
shop.  I have one single male friend who can shop as well as women.  I have a <br/>
few female friends without the shopping gene.  In any case, for a male human <br/>
to tell females how not to shop is bound to cause some uplifted eyebrows from <br/>
those who, at the height of their higher-primate behavior, could take offense <br/>
at being called sheep.]<br/>
<br/>
-=-That&#39;s fine.  To each his own.  I don&#39;t fault you if you don&#39;t fault me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an auto-faulting mechanism in protesting.<br/>
A public, vocal protester cannot in good faith say &quot;to each his own.&quot;<br/>
&quot;To each his own&quot; starts at home, and doesn&#39;t make placards.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602924644">Why I don&#39;t think after thanksgiving is a good day to<br/>
shop...Because the stores are glutted with xtras that<br/>
we may or may not need touted to be on sale at 20% are<br/>
they really? It would be an interesting project to<br/>
make a list of things you need or want then watch the<br/>
sales throughout the year then go out at on that big<br/>
day after thanksgiving and see if the sales are as<br/>
good as they say. Maybe I am being cynical but don&#39;t<br/>
many store increase their % of profit around the<br/>
holidays then say some wigit is on sale for whatever<br/>
so we might more likely buy it? <br/>

Hi Samantha,<br/>
<br/>
I miss the Frugal Zealot (Amy D. of The Tightwad Gazette)...I subscribed to<br/>
the newsletter and have all 3 books. (bought at a discount bookstore, of<br/>
course)<br/>
<br/>
I also love to shop yard sales and thrift shops. I rarely buy new clothes of<br/>
any kind for my family. I find like-new things all the time, and for nearly<br/>
nothing. I also buy Christmas and birthday gifts second-hand if it&#39;s a good<br/>
item. No one cares if it&#39;s not in the original box.<br/>
<br/>
But I still love shopping. It&#39;s fun. And if my husband hadn&#39;t been working<br/>
the day after Thanksgiving, I would have been out there, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099657515">A tale of frugality!!  <br/>
<br/>
A friend of ours came round yesterday, he&#39;d been to the <br/>
local bicycle shop.  For Christmas, he&#39;d planned to buy <br/>
new bicycles for his kids, he has 2, a boy and a girl.  <br/>
He phoned some folk who&#39;d put ads in the local paper, <br/>
got a decent bike for his son from someone who lived a <br/>
few doors away, but he had to travel a little further <br/>
afield for his daughter.  When he got to the first <br/>
house, he was met by an apologetic man, who told him <br/>
that his time had been wasted.<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t possibly sell you this bike, it&#39;s knackered!  <br/>
If you want it, take it!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Errr, OK&quot; our friend replied.  The bike turned out to <br/>
be rather mucky, slightly scratched and the back braked <br/>
were seized up.  But it was a very good quality frame <br/>
with an 18speed gear set.  He eventually paid Â£5 for <br/>
it.  A little elbow grease and T-cut, and a new set of <br/>
back brakes, and he has two perfectly good bikes for <br/>
his children, for a little over Â£60.  They&#39;d&#39;ve cost At <br/>
least Â£100 pounds each new, probably a lot more for the <br/>
girl&#39;s bike. <br/>
