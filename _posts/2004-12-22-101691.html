I think I&#39;d probably go to the parents after the first incident and <br/>
say something along the lines of &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure you want to take care <br/>
of this yourself: Johnny just did such and such and I know you don&#39;t <br/>
want that going on. I&#39;ll let you talk to him and keep him from having <br/>
more problems.&quot; <br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
I know I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone, child or adult, was doing something destructive on my property, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t hesitate for a second to say &quot;STOP IT&quot; and really mean it.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass what his parents or his wife or her husband thought about <br/>
me saying &quot;NO.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IF parents want to be the only ones to deal with their children, then they <br/>
need to be first by being first.  <br/>
<br/>
But then I also don&#39;t like parents coming into my home with their kids and <br/>
then telling their kids they can&#39;t climb up the slide or have another cookie.<br/>
<br/>
There are courtesies involved with being in another person&#39;s home and though <br/>
it seems to be becoming more and more lost, that&#39;s just ignorance in the <br/>
younger generation.  People will come over with fast food and walk in the house!  <br/>
Under certain gamer-circumstances, it&#39;s not so bad, but generally it&#39;s insanely <br/>
treating a person&#39;s house as though it were a public park with a picnic <br/>
table, or like a parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
-=- And then the next time &quot;What happened with Johnny? It <br/>
seems like he really needs your help. Everyone is taking care of <br/>
their own kids since my daughter is with her friends.&quot; Etc.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
If there were a next time, I would tell Johnny &quot;Go sit with your mom,&quot; and <br/>
when I got to the mom would say &quot;You need to stay with Johnny.&quot;   I wouldn&#39;t.  <br/>
She could stay with him at my house or take him to her house.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem is that those who are problematical are often those who <br/>
are lacking social skills and as there&#39;s a genetic component, the parents might <br/>
be similarly lacking.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who was like an asocial bull in a social china shop, but she <br/>
never felt bad or embarrassed because she didn&#39;t seem to perceive that element <br/>
of life on earth.  In a meeting, she would close her eyes and then interrupt, <br/>
talking with her eyes closed.  No point could be made with her without the <br/>
person being blunt to the point of cruelty, and THEN maybe she would take it the <br/>
way others take very tactful little hints.  Statements that would have turned <br/>
me to crying goo were met with &quot;Oh.  Sorry.  I didn&#39;t think about that; <br/>
thanks,&quot; and a smile, and an attempt to change.<br/>
<br/>
So just as one wouldn&#39;t invite the tone deaf to sing madrigals nor the <br/>
stumble-footed to play soccer, just don&#39;t invite the socially inept to social <br/>
parties.  Ceremonies (weddings, baptisms, funerals), fine.  Those are rarely in <br/>
private homes anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I understand being blunt when someone is causing problems or <br/>
destroying your property. But the original poster wrote &quot;Is<br/>
there something brilliant I can say to the parents?&quot; so I assumed she <br/>
wanted an alternative.<br/>
<br/>
She also wrote that the mom seemed to want a break from the kids, so <br/>
I read that to mean that the mom was capable of watching the kids, <br/>
but had the expectation she didn&#39;t need to during a party. If <br/>
reminding her didn&#39;t work, yeh, bluntness and/or not inviting them <br/>
would make sense to me.<br/>
