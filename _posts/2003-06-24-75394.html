<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So why the expression, &quot;lone wolf&quot;, I wonder?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was my impression that a wolf will, indeed, sometimes leave the pack.  <br/>
&gt; But <br/>
&gt; that they then attempt to build their own or join another pack.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Or a wolf can challenge the alpha and take charge of the pack (if <br/>
successful).<br/>
<br/>
Lone wolves usually aren&#39;t alone for long. It&#39;s not natural.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>NO. If a challenger loses, he is accepted as a grunt again. You won&#39;t find <br/>
bitterness and retribution in packs. If a wolf/dog will accept his place in the <br/>
pack, all is forgiven. If he sees another opportunity to gain rank, he will. <br/>
And he might succeed the second (or third or eighth) time. The pack is <br/>
forgiving. The pack needs its members to survive.<br/>
