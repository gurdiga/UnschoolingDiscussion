<div id="ygrps-yiv-819613092"><p dir="ltr">I&#39;m trying to find some discussions of the assertion: &quot;Kids need something to push against,&quot; ie- I need to set artificial boundaries (like deadlines or limits) so that the child will complete xyz task, or &quot;accomplish something.&quot; I can&#39;t seem to get anywhere searching on sandradodd.com-there must be something there but I&#39;m using wrong search terms. The &quot;create something to push against&quot; is the central concept I&#39;m exploring, that&#39;s the terminology people are using to me and that is getting stuck in my head.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Is this ringing any bells in terms of links that I can explore? I *know* I&#39;ve seen these exact words in discussions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My son is in a book club and he loves to finish the books for book club, but he&#39;s not interested in reading books without that deadline. He loves the structure and discipline of the dojo, but he&#39;s not interested in working on his skills without that pressure. He loves having an objective in a video game, but he isn&#39;t interested in continuing a sandbox project that he sets for himself past a single session of play. I know that&#39;s okay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So then my parents, or even my husband, will say, &quot;You need to give him something to push against; he finds it rewarding to accomplish goals in that context.&quot; This feels wrong to me (that it is *my* job to do that), but I can&#39;t get to a cogent argument for why.</p>

-=-Is this ringing any bells in terms of links that I can explore? I *know* I&#39;ve seen these exact words in discussions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not in any discussion I’ve been in.  Not that I can remember.<br/>
I remember things about “you need to frustrate him” (which my mother-in-law said), about making life harder in general, but not in specific, I don’t think.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My son is in a book club and he loves to finish the books for book club, but he&#39;s not interested in reading books without that deadline. He loves the structure and discipline of the dojo, but he&#39;s not interested in working on his skills without that pressure. He loves having an objective in a video game, but he isn&#39;t interested in continuing a sandbox project that he sets for himself past a single session of play. I know that&#39;s okay. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Some people like competition and “achievements.”<br/>
If he’s setting his own goals or choosing competitive or record-keeping activities, that’s his doing.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to control and schedule him, it could backfire.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So then my parents, or even my husband, will say, &quot;You need to give him something to push against; he finds it rewarding to accomplish goals in that context.&quot; This feels wrong to me (that it is *my* job to do that), but I can&#39;t get to a cogent argument for why.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ask your husband and parents that. :-)<br/>
If they make a statement like that, then say “Why?”  And quietly wait, with steady gaze, for them to explain to you why they think there’s a hurry or a competition.   Don’t rush in with your defense or evidence before you see if they can come up with a thoughtful part 2 to their assertion about what YOU “need” to do.<br/>
<br/>
If you remember it from a discussion here, go to the group page (there should be a link at the bottom of each e-mail) and search at the top where it says “search discussions.”<br/>

(Though some kids do like to play like that, taking the role of many players and playing alone.)</div><div><br></div><div>If he really does like the feel of goals, that shouldn&#39;t be complicated to assist, because he will also be giving ideas about goals to accomplish. My son was given a pedometer and he got excited about reaching 14,000 steps. It was fun and simple to assist him in that goal. It didn&#39;t feel like a &#39;job&#39; at all.</div><div><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote type="cite"><div id="ygrps-yiv-51607478ygrp-mlmsg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-51607478ygrp-msg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-51607478ygrp-text"><p dir="ltr"><font color="#000000"><span style="">So then my parents, or even my husband, will say, &quot;You need to give him something to push against; he finds it rewarding to accomplish goals in that context.&quot; This feels wrong to me (that it is *my* job to do that), but I can&#39;t get to a cogent argument for why.</span></font></p></div></div></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><div>Maybe the best argument for parents or a spouse is &quot;why?&quot; and attempt to get to the heart of what their concern is, if there is time and interest.

I never would have been the swimmer I was without my coaches pushing me, and that&#39;s me I was very competitive without lots of free choices as a kid, but that&#39;s not true for my kids, who seem to have no concern for how fast they swim and aren&#39;t particularly competitive. Or something along the lines of; &#39;I wouldn&#39;t have learned xyz without some lingering consequences therefore this child I see should also be pushed like I was pushed&#39;.
