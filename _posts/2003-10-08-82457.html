<br/>
No restrictions on either. I have seven and 15 year old boys. <br/>
<br/>
Although I&#39;m a *little* tired of The Simpson&#39;s Halloween DVD we just got two <br/>
days ago! I enjoyed it the first 12-15 times!  But over and over and over and <br/>
over...*I* know more than half the lines by now! And even though we spent five <br/>
hours at the fair yesterday, I was reciting Simpsons in my DREAMS last night! <br/>
I may ban the sucker today!   <br/>
<br/>
So yes, after these last two days, I&#39;ll venture to say that I *may* do some <br/>
restricting! &lt;g&gt; Can we watch Cat-Dog or Cow and Chicken or Ed, Edd, & <br/>
Eddie----PLEEEEEEEEEASE?????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think I can work toward trusting him, <br/>

&quot;trash&quot; (even Power Rangers -- that&#39;s a new one for us and my ex-teacher self <br/>
is <br/>
silently struggling with that), but are there any pitfalls with that attitude <br/>
that I need to be aware of? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See above! &lt;BWG&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As far as bedtime goes, do most of you just let your kids sleep when <br/>
 </span></blockquote>they&#39;re <br/>
tired?  (Gee, it sounds so sensible when I put it that way. &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s a <br/>
beautiful night and I love the idea of Fisher being able to enjoy it with me <br/>
(I&#39;m a <br/>
night walker) . . . but I also get kind of an icky feeling when we get in the <br/>
habit of sleeping late in the morning.  I hate to miss the beautiful early <br/>
morning hours, and I guess years of socialization has taught me to feel lazy <br/>
when I (or my son) sleep in.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think naps were invented? I&#39;m up early. I often go to bed <br/>
late---although sometimes I crawl in @ 8:00. Just depends on how tired I am. I&#39;m a big <br/>
believer in naps. Forced naps are rough----you learn to avoid naps AT ALL <br/>
COST! Both my boys will go to bed in the middle of the afternoon if they are <br/>
tired. It&#39;s not a punishment----and THEY know when they are tired. And they see me <br/>
nap a lot. I think it&#39;s natural. <br/>
