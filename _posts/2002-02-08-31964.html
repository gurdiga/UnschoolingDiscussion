Ok. But what about when it is something that really is of no value, or<br/>
worse - that is of negative value? Like kids who torture animals for<br/>
instance?<br/>
I&#39;m sure these hypothetical what-if&#39;s irritate those of you who have enough<br/>

<br/>
Sorry if my response was misleading. My statement wasn&#39;t taking the nurture<br/>
side of the nature vs. nurture debate. If you want to start another thread<br/>
on that, perhaps there may be some people interested in debating it.<br/>
<br/>
I was responding to the idea of whether or not it was useful to discuss<br/>
hypothetical problems. If a hypothetical child is torturing animals, how can<br/>
we discuss how to hypothetically handle it? Even if the child is Jeffrey<br/>
Dahmer, there *is* a cause behind the behavior. It may be genetic. It may be<br/>
biological. It may be chemical. It may be physical abuse. It may be<br/>
psychological abuse. It may be a combination. Solutions must deal with the<br/>
cause, not the symptoms. Abuse of animals -- and lying and bedwetting and<br/>
pinching as well as a few thousand more things that kids could do -- is only<br/>
a symptom that could be caused by many different factors. And it&#39;s the<br/>
factors that need to be examined, not the symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; part of what she questions<br/>
&gt; should be questioned, &quot;is everyone entirely honest about this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a good question but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a good answer! If someone is<br/>
lying about her children then she&#39;s going to lie about whether she&#39;s being<br/>
truthful ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Hypothetically speaking we should treat *all* information we receive --<br/>
whether it&#39;s from a list or message board or book or friend or newspaper or<br/>
magazine or tv show or ... -- as open to question. People being people they<br/>
will lie, simplify things to make a point clearer, let their enthusiasm<br/>
paint a rosier picture, be mistaken regardless of the medium they use to<br/>
tell their story through.<br/>
<br/>
The information we get here should only be the beginning. We shouldn&#39;t take<br/>
any of it on blind faith. We can run everything that sounds interesting<br/>
through the test of whether it makes sense. We can ask questions. (Which is<br/>
what makes this medium, despite it&#39;s limitations, so useful.) We can do<br/>
research. We can test it out.<br/>
<br/>
If we do that, then it won&#39;t make any difference if some people are lying or<br/>
being unintentially misleading because we&#39;ll be thinking for ourselves and<br/>
finding out for ourselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57999687">My response was to &quot;What&#39;s going on in his life that is causing him to feel<br/>
this is okay?&quot; which seems to be the automatic response be it real or<br/>
hypothetical.  The point of Dahmer is that even in hypothetical people<br/>
always jump on the &quot;there *is* a cause behind the behavior&quot; and<br/>
automatically assume the cause is something to do with the home environment.<br/>
<br/>
My point was that if one reads the interviews it throws a monkey wrench into<br/>
the idea that some folks are just born &quot;bad.&quot;  There was nothing going on in<br/>
Dahmer&#39;s life to cause him to feel that way.<br/>

Its up to parents to help you work through that stuff, or they can <br/>

4. Quite a few studies say that that is what is with us for the rest <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836010520">I&#39;ll see if I can find them.  I watched several of them on television.<br/>
<br/>
I worked with an ex-offenders&#39; program and have interviewed hundreds of guys<br/>
in prison.  I have also overheard hundreds of conversations between felons<br/>
and their lawyers/social workers/etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also worked for years with shrinks.<br/>
<br/>
The bottomline is that most of the stories are just that, stories.  A good<br/>
percentage of the stories are &quot;fed&quot; to the supposed interviewees.<br/>
<br/>
That is not to say that &quot;bad stuff&quot; doesn&#39;t happen, the problem is that not<br/>
as much &quot;bad stuff&quot; is happening out there as all the nice little reports<br/>
and studies are carping about.<br/>
<br/>
The point to remember is that if there isn&#39;t enough &quot;bad stuff&quot; to report,<br/>
then they don&#39;t get a free ride or have anything to send out grant proposals<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
You have to understand that all the &quot;shrink&quot; stuff began with a man that<br/>
liked to use people as guinea pigs to test the results of doses of cocaine<br/>
on.  a man that liked to push people to the edge to see if he could bring<br/>
them back from it.  A man that believed that the manipulation of data was<br/>
justified by the outcome.  AND, the methods haven&#39;t changed a whole lot<br/>
since then.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wondered why humans are &quot;o.k.&quot; with looking at say a litter of<br/>
puppies that have the same mother and father and were all treated the same<br/>
and when one turns out &quot;bad&quot; saying that it was the &quot;bad apple.&quot;  Yet they<br/>
can&#39;t do that with with humans.  They have to pick apart the whole life of<br/>
the &quot;bad apple&quot; and his/her family to find out &quot;why.&quot;  Just maybe sometimes<br/>
there is no &quot;why,&quot; there is just an &quot;is.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve always wondered why humans are &quot;o.k.&quot; with looking at say a litter<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt;puppies that have the same mother and father and were all treated the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; &gt;and when one turns out &quot;bad&quot; saying that it was the &quot;bad apple.&quot;  Yet<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; &gt;can&#39;t do that with with humans.  They have to pick apart the whole life<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the &quot;bad apple&quot; and his/her family to find out &quot;why.&quot;  Just maybe<br/>
sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt;there is no &quot;why,&quot; there is just an &quot;is.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How often does a litter of puppies stay together with the same owner?  The<br/>
&gt; bad apple dogs I&#39;ve run across could always be explained by the way they<br/>
&gt; were treated.  Even in human families, one or more of the kids can get<br/>
&gt; treated completely differently by the parents.  It happens.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The bottomline is that most of the stories are just that, stories.  A good<br/>
&gt; percentage of the stories are &quot;fed&quot; to the supposed interviewees.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just because the stories are made up doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t a cause to the<br/>
behavior. (And by cause I am *not* assuming it must be bad parenting. It can<br/>
be their environment. Or biology. Or any of the others I mentioned before.)<br/>
Bad people don&#39;t just happen. There *are* reasons. To assume that&#39;s so is to<br/>
assume that African Americans are inherently worse than other races since<br/>
they are disporportionately represented in prisons.<br/>
<br/>
My beliefs that there are causes to children&#39;s behavior isn&#39;t based on<br/>
believing the stories told by psychologists or felons but by the problems<br/>
parents have brought to homeschooling message boards and lists.<br/>
<br/>
Can we assume an adult&#39;s bad behavior was caused by a rotten childhood or<br/>
bad parenting? No.<br/>
<br/>
Can a parent bring a problem they&#39;re having with a child to a list and<br/>
though questioning and introspection and trying out various suggestions<br/>
uncover the factors (that might even be biological) that are behind the<br/>
child&#39;s behavior? Yes, so far I have seen it to be possible.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean all children will be sweetness and light if we only parent<br/>
properly. Many children are high energy, loud, physical, demanding, quiet,<br/>
introverted and a whole host of other personality types that society deems<br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;in need of correction&quot;. Often the &quot;problem&quot; isn&#39;t the child&#39;s<br/>
behavior so much as the parent&#39;s need to change the child into something he<br/>
is not. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect even the most well meaning parents can turn out bad kids because<br/>
they parent by &quot;the rules&quot; (eg., the way kids are &quot;supposed&quot; to be raised)<br/>
rather than expecting every chlld to be a unique individual with his own<br/>
needs, parents who try to shape and mold rather than listen and understand<br/>
to help the child grow in the way he was meant to go. (It&#39;s even possible<br/>
that parents who do their best to understand or who try to protect their<br/>
kids from a bad environment will be overwhelmed.) A free spirited child in a<br/>
home that is tightly controlled is undoubtedly at risk for turning bad. But<br/>
no one would be able to pinpoint that the parents were to blame strictly<br/>
from the type of parenting they did that thousands of other parents had used<br/>
to turn out good kids. (At risk, too, is a child who wants a lot of guidance<br/>
whose parents are saying do with your life what you will. But society would<br/>
jump all over that type of parenting since it&#39;s assume that will always turn<br/>
out bad kids.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really trying to get where you&#39;re coming from Lynda.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe from the environment you were working in you are used to people<br/>
looking to place the blame for their own action on somewhere other than on<br/>
themselves? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see that making the assumption we might be able to help a parent<br/>
with a problem if they can tell us what&#39;s going on at home as being the same<br/>
as assuming a parent is to blame for rotten adults.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m seeing a difference between:<br/>
<br/>
1) someone saying their childhood is to blame for the rotten adult they<br/>
became. If we do seek to understand why someone did what they did, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean we absolve them of responsibility. Understanding isn&#39;t the same<br/>
as saying it&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
2) a parent saying my child is torturing animals, what should I do and then<br/>
people asking for some background. Assuming we can pinpoint a cause isn&#39;t<br/>
the same as saying the parent must be at fault. (And it also is *not* saying<br/>
the adult the child will become is automatically absolved of responsibility<br/>
for their actions.) Maybe the child was a crack baby. Maybe there&#39;s a<br/>
genetic fault. My point is we can&#39;t begin to make suggestions unless we can<br/>
know what&#39;s causing it. And we can&#39;t know the causes if the problem is<br/>
hypothetical.<br/>
<br/>
Just because we can find a cause for a child&#39;s behavior doesn&#39;t therefore<br/>
make whatever they do as an adult forgivable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707459654">I just have to make a comment about the myth of the first three years<br/>
thing.  Perhaps it is a myth, but I know that who I am has its roots in<br/>
who I was from the very beginning of my life, and I still remain affected<br/>
by my responses to my situations in my earliest days.  None of us has a<br/>
choice of circumstances in our lives when we are that small, but even<br/>
then we react in different ways to it that influence our reactions to<br/>
similar circumstances later on in life.  <br/>
People&#39;s behavior has to do with our subconscious beliefs which are<br/>
almost inseparable from our early experiences.  Most of the people I know<br/>
who have been drug addicts or abusive actually don&#39;t believe that they<br/>
were abused (though they might say it because they&#39;ve been told so by<br/>
psychologists and lawyers or to get on government assistance or out of<br/>
jail) because they don&#39;t feel it.  And often when they accept that truth<br/>
they can accept the truth that they have a problem and are responsible<br/>
for it.  One denial leads to another, so to speak.  When we build a<br/>
building, it is only as strong as its foundation.  Sometimes we need to<br/>
rebuild the foundation, but we can&#39;t if we keep saying there is nothing<br/>
wrong with it.  <br/>
But a bad beginning doesn&#39;t excuse us, it just means we might have more<br/>
of a struggle in certain areas.  We are all responsible for what we<br/>
accept as ours in terms of our beliefs.  I think someone who is hurting<br/>
others deliberately has accepted into the heart something that is wrong<br/>
rather than rejecting it, and usually because on a subconscious level<br/>
they think it will somehow help in surviving.  But this can be changed by<br/>
identifying the wrong belief and refusing to accept it anymore.  Then we<br/>
can choose new beliefs that truly are helpful to ourselves and others.  <br/>
I know that probably what I am saying will get picked apart, and I won&#39;t<br/>
be able to defend it with any scientific studies, but this is just my<br/>
personal opinion based on my own science experiment, life.  I have never<br/>
seen anyone who committed wrong behavior who didn&#39;t base it on a wrong<br/>
belief.  And I have never seen anyone who changed their wrong behavior<br/>
without also changing the wrong beliefs with truth.  The interesting<br/>
thing to me is, the wrong belief didn&#39;t come from what anyone did or said<br/>
to them as much as how they processed and chose to think of what was done<br/>
or said to them.  So our belief comes from within us and we own it and it<br/>
cannot be blamed on anyone else any more than wrong actions can be blamed<br/>
on anyone else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79498667">Words such as &quot;blame,&quot; etc. are used as crutches, excuses and a way out of<br/>
responsibility.  That was the point.  Folks use excuses for their own<br/>
choices.  They look to place blame anywhere but where it belongs, on their<br/>
own shoulders or in their genetic make-up.<br/>
<br/>
Our society has become excuse driven.  There is an expert or shrink or study<br/>
to say &quot;oh poor baby, it isn&#39;t your fault&quot; around every corner.<br/>
<br/>
My point was that frequently one needs to look not further than the person<br/>
themselves and how society has presented  them with a dozen excuses for any<br/>
behavior regardless of its origin or cause.<br/>
<br/>
Too often society confuses the definitions of &quot;excuse&quot; and &quot;explanation.&quot;<br/>
