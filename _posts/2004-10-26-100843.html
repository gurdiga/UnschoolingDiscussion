<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508908145">I&#39;ve been no mail for a while, but went back and read a bit. I&#39;ll have to  <br/>
look into that William Blake CD Danielle suggested.<br/>
 <br/>
Fans of Blake and other poets might really get into this CD. It&#39;s by The  <br/>
Dead Poets, a local group of three that puts music to the words of  <br/>
....well...dead poets. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m a huge fan and am eagerly awaiting their  next CD which will <br/>
include a wonderful song of Poe&#39;s &quot;Eldorado&quot;!<br/>
 <br/>
Description of them----a bit from their website is below. Go here for a few  <br/>
tunes, like &quot;The Tyger&quot;, by Blake.<br/>

THE DEAD POETS&quot; RELEASE LONG-AWAITED CD: <br/>
Asheville, NC, 21 May 2001 --  Long-dead poets are coming back to life with <br/>
the release of a unique debut CD by  inimitable poetry band, The Dead Poets. <br/>
For the past six years The Dead Poets  Poetry Band have been wowing audiences at <br/>
the Lake Eden Arts Festival and the  Asheville Poetry Show with their <br/>
combination of familiar classic poetry and  toe-tapping musical arrangements. This <br/>
much-anticipated recording, entitled &quot;The  Dead Poets,&quot; captures all the <br/>
harmony, humor, and swing of their live shows with  recognizable poetry set to a <br/>
range of music, from bluegrass to rockabilly,  a-capella to country, and <br/>
everything in between.  <br/>
&quot;The world NEEDS this CD!&quot; says drummer Allan Wolf, himself a published poet  <br/>
and former English teacher. &quot;Too many people have the wrong impression that  <br/>
poetry is like a visit to the dentist; uncomfortable but necessary. We call <br/>
our  approach to verse &#39;musico-poetica.&#39; That&#39;s when the &#39;muse&#39; in music brings <br/>
out  the &#39;Oh!&#39; in poetry. Even people who feel that poetry is boring or <br/>
confusing end  up dancing to Dickinson and bopping to Blake!&quot; The &quot;musico-poetica&quot; <br/>
found on the  new CD should be familiar to anyone who has taken a literature <br/>
class in school:  &quot;The Tyger&quot; by William Blake; &quot;Trees&quot; by Joyce Kilmer; <br/>
&quot;Daffodils&quot; by William  Wordsworth, &quot;Because I Could Not Stop for Death&quot; by Emily <br/>
Dickinson. Even Lewis  Carroll and E.E.Cummings, among others, make an <br/>
appearance.  <br/>
If you missed The Dead Poets&#39; CD Release party, you can still see them live  <br/>
periodically. Check our _online schedule_ <br/>

Description:<br/>
Great songs are often considered great poetry, but  with The Dead Poets, <br/>
great poems also make great songs. A favorite verse, a  catchy melody, a bit of <br/>
harmony--put them together and you might hear something  in the poem you hadn’t <br/>
heard before. The Dead Poets use music to transform  classic poetry into a <br/>
fresh and exciting experience, accessible to everyone.  From Cummings to <br/>
Dickinson, Wordsworth to Rumi, you’ll love the way the &quot;muse&quot;  in music brings out the <br/>
&quot;Oh!&quot; in poetry. <br/>
Bio:<br/>
The Dead Poets first performed together in 1996 as the One  Night Dog Band. <br/>
Poet Allan Wolf (drums) gathered a couple of friends, writer Tom  Tracy <br/>
(guitar) and artist Alex Alford (bass), for an impromptu gig at legendary  poetry <br/>
venue, “the green door on carolina lane” in Asheville, NC. They’ve  continued to <br/>
play together ever since, delighting audiences with their unique,  <br/>
finger-snapping, musico-poetic stylings.  <br/>
More than merely presenting poetry in a novel way, The Dead Poets are  <br/>
continuing a long tradition as old as poetry itself. One of the earliest poems  in <br/>
English, “Beowulf,” describes scenes of Old English bards (called “scops”),  <br/>
performing poems about tribal history to harp accompaniment. In modern times,  <br/>
musicians have often mined poetic tradition for their lyrics: Simon &  <br/>
Garfunkel with “Richard Corey” by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1896-1935); Loreena  <br/>
McKennitt with “Lady of Shalott” by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809-1892); and so  <br/>
on. The act of putting poetry to music allows both listener and musician to  <br/>
transcend the words and the notes. The Dead Poets call this marriage of song <br/>
and  verse “musico-poetica.” It’s about learning poetry by note, not by  rote.<br/>
