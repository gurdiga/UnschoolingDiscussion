<div id="ygrps-yiv-45109760">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i would like to say without a doubt you experienced full blown<br/>
discrimination from many angles and if i were you i would bone up on the<br/>
state laws regarding homeschooling because she may not let it drop,<br/>
despite the fact that you were the one to initiate the visit.   i don&#39;t<br/>
mean to promote fear or sound paranoid but with all the fear that&#39;s flying<br/>
around the country it may not be a bad idea to be fully prepared for a<br/>
visit from some sort of official because in some states a dr must report<br/>
situation which they feel are abusive and if she&#39;s so anti homeschooling<br/>
she may interpret your son&#39;s moodiness as signs of something else.  i&#39;m not<br/>
versed on the laws of washington and here in texas we have it &#39;easy&#39; but<br/>
it&#39;s better to be prepared than getting caught off guard.  if you don&#39;t<br/>
know the laws or where to find them i would be happy to locate and email<br/>
them to you.  i&#39;m so sorry that you got the exact opposite of help.  good<br/>
luck to you.<br/>
<br/>
as far as your son goes there&#39;s been a book which has been talked about a<br/>
lot on tv (i think on oprah and other shows) i think it&#39;s entitled real<br/>
boys  personally i have not read it but from what i understand to get boys<br/>
talking you need to do it in the context of doing something i.e. drawing,<br/>
fishing, playing basketball etc.  maybe finding a hobby or an activity he<br/>
really enjoys might help him find some way to express himself so both you<br/>
and he can get a better understanding of his nature.   you may want to<br/>
check out the site heartmath.org  it&#39;s kind of interesting.  just a<br/>
thought.  i&#39;ve had no experience with hereditary mental illness but if you<br/>
can get him talking it may lead both of you to a better place.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; I am on digest mode of this list, and have not been active on the list<br/>
&gt; either, for some time, due to time constraints.  I am writing now to ask<br/>
&gt; for some much needed understanding and support(help?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Something happened yesterday, that made me realize my need for support,<br/>
&gt; which will require a bit of background information, so here it is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I live in WA state, and I have been homeschooling my 2 children(ages 8 &<br/>
&gt; 6) for 2+years now.  Unschooling is an informed lifestyle choice I have<br/>
&gt; made for my family.  I am a very capable single mother, on a limited<br/>
&gt; income(disability).  My children&#39;s father is not, and never has been<br/>
&gt; involved in their lives.  They do have male role models, and their<br/>
&gt; absent biological father is not a problem or an issue in my life or my<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s at this time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also have Bipolar disorder(otherwise known as manic depression), a<br/>
&gt; very serious, potentially life threatening(a shocking 15-20% of<br/>
&gt; untreated bipolar sufferers commit suicide), incurable, but highly<br/>
&gt; treatable(medication called mood stabilizers, are a must for this<br/>
&gt; illness) neurobiological disorder of the brain, which affects mood,<br/>
&gt; behavior, and thoughts.  It is also highly genetic and happens to run in<br/>
&gt; both sides of my family(and possibly my children&#39;s paternal line as<br/>
&gt; well).  I had childhood onset type(even more highly genetic) of bipolar<br/>
&gt; disorder, as did my maternal grandfather and a maternal uncle.  My<br/>
&gt; extended family, on both sides, is riddled with &quot;mental<br/>
&gt; illness&quot;(paternal grandmother & grandfather, my own brother & my<br/>
&gt; father).  As a result of all of this, I have educated myself about<br/>
&gt; neurobioligical brain disorders(otherwise called &quot;mental illnesses&quot;),<br/>
&gt; their symptoms, treatment, etc., and continue to do so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son(age 8.5 yrs.), who is very intelligent, smart, and wonderful &<br/>
&gt; sweet, has been showing signs of A.D.H.D. since birth, basicly, nothing<br/>
&gt; for which I am too concerned about other than the fact that ADD is often<br/>
&gt; seen in children prior to onset of bipolar symptoms(a precursor sign).<br/>
&gt; Last year, I noticed some changes in my sons mood and behavior, which<br/>
&gt; had me concerned(he seemed depressed for about 2 weeks).  Knowing what I<br/>
&gt; know about Bipolar disorder and that it runs in my family, I chose to<br/>
&gt; speak to his doctor about my concerns at that time(last spring), who was<br/>
&gt; hesitant to refer me to a specialist, nonetheless I insisted upon a<br/>
&gt; referral.  I could not get him in at that time, since the doctor in the<br/>
&gt; next town refused to see him, and we did not have a psychiatrist in our<br/>
&gt; town then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We now have one (her specialty is even child psychiatry), she works at<br/>
&gt; our community mental health facility, who is also my own psychiatrist,<br/>
&gt; and my prescribing physician.  My sons doctor recently referred him to<br/>
&gt; her, and yesterday was his appointment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went to this appointment, expecting to address my sons&#39; mood symptoms<br/>
&gt; and my concerns about his inheriting the family propensity for this<br/>
&gt; illness, particularly childhood onset bipolar disorder, and what I can<br/>
&gt; and can&#39;t do about that.  Like what can I do to help my son deal with<br/>
&gt; his emotions, what signs should I look for, when to seek treatment if<br/>
&gt; and when...., NOT to get him on medication(I am not even considering<br/>
&gt; that as an option at this time), for ADD or anything else.  I have been<br/>
&gt; told, and have read again and again, in my research on this topic, that<br/>
&gt; it is best to have a child seen as soon at the first sign of symptoms.<br/>
&gt; I have suspected for sometime with my son(he is so much like I was in<br/>
&gt; everyway-and so different from my daughter).  I just wanted some<br/>
&gt; professional advice/opinion, a professional to hear my concerns,etc.,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just can&#39;t believe what I actually got instead and I am infuriated by<br/>
&gt; it.  I am also very confused, because she is my own doctor(my new pdoc),<br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t want my feelings concerning this to interfere with my<br/>
&gt; developing relationship with her in that arena(because I need her to<br/>
&gt; treat me, she is the only pdoc nearby), right now, but perhaps that is<br/>
&gt; being unrealistic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, my son&#39;s appt. was for an hour, and she spent the first part of<br/>
&gt; that time talking to him, while I was in the room, most of it talking to<br/>
&gt; me privately while he played in the waiting room, and about 3 minutes<br/>
&gt; speaking to him privately.  When asked about school, he told her he was<br/>
&gt; homeschooling.  He is kind of shy of strangers, so he was not real<br/>
&gt; forthcoming with her, and kept saying &quot;i don&#39;t know&quot; a lot.  During the<br/>
&gt; time she spent alone with me talking about my son, she asked me why I<br/>
&gt; was homeschooling my kids.  I told her it is a lifestyle choice I have<br/>
&gt; made, and something I thought about doing since Skyler was a baby.<br/>
&gt; (It&#39;s not like something happened to make me decide this or that it was<br/>
&gt; a sudden decision, you know?.)  She kept asking me questions like what<br/>
&gt; grade is he in(I said &quot;he would be in 3rd grade&quot;)?, if I knew what grade<br/>
&gt; level he was at(I said &quot;not really&quot; and was oviously not too concerned<br/>
&gt; about it)?, and if we use a curriculum(&quot;no, we do not&quot;)?, and what about<br/>
&gt; testing, etc.?   I was really caught off guard by this line of<br/>
&gt; questioning, I mean I took my son to her because of my concerns about<br/>
&gt; him having symptoms of a mood disorder!!!???  How in the hell does this<br/>
&gt; have to do with curriculum and testing and grade level?  I am just so<br/>
&gt; angry about this, and I feel I was discriminated against, although I am<br/>
&gt; not sure why.  She obviously doens&#39;t understand about homeschooling,<br/>
&gt; unschooling, or my decision to do so, and I certainly can&#39;t explain that<br/>
&gt; to her in a nutshell in less than an hour!  But, I also felt<br/>
&gt; discriminated against because of my having bipolar disorder and because<br/>
&gt; I am a single parent.  She also asked lots of questions about his<br/>
&gt; father, etc.,  She asked Skyler to list all the members of his family,<br/>
&gt; who lives in his house, etc, and then she said &quot;what about your Dad?&quot;<br/>
&gt; and he said &quot;I don&#39;t have a Dad.&quot;  She seemed very concerned about this,<br/>
&gt; but the fact is that he doesn&#39;t have a Dad, and it doens&#39;t bother him or<br/>
&gt; me(but it did bother her, it seems she didn&#39;t like his answer).  I have<br/>
&gt; told him about his biological father as he has asked, but he is just not<br/>
&gt; very concerned with that.  I&#39;m sure he will ask more questions as he<br/>
&gt; matures.  Once again, other than her asking for genetic purposes, I see<br/>
&gt; no point for her concern on this matter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have followed me this far, please keep reading, because this is<br/>
&gt; the important part of my story.  Now, get this: by middle of our<br/>
&gt; converstation and her questioning, she &quot;professionally recommends&quot; to<br/>
&gt; me, that I enroll my son in p.s., if not full-time, then part-time,<br/>
&gt; because she says even though kids may not want to go to school all day,<br/>
&gt; for some kids, it is actually good for them(even if they don&#39;t want to),<br/>
&gt; because they get to be around other kids and develop relationships with<br/>
&gt; other adults,etc., AND because she can&#39;t really diagnose him as ADD(i<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t asking her to) if he&#39;s not in school, since the way that she<br/>
&gt; usually does that is to send forms/diagnostic tests, etc., for the<br/>
&gt; schools/teachers.  I was so shocked I could barely respond!  She could<br/>
&gt; see I was not pleased with what she had to say, and I just told her<br/>
&gt; plain and simple, that I was not even considering putting my children in<br/>
&gt; ps at this time, that this was not an issue at all with me.  She asked<br/>
&gt; if I ever planned to, and I told her if my kids ever decided they really<br/>
&gt; wanted to go to school, then they would go(they definately do not want<br/>
&gt; to now, I know this, and they know they can if they want).  I also made<br/>
&gt; it clear to her my ONLY reason for concern about &quot;testing&quot; is because it<br/>
&gt; is required by law, but not until 4th grade(am I right?).  She was<br/>
&gt; trying to tell me testing/grade level, etc., was important so he could<br/>
&gt; &quot;graduate&quot; from h.s.(???) and go to college.  My God, who is this woman,<br/>
&gt; and what does any of this have to do with why I took him there?  I feel<br/>
&gt; like I am in the twilight zone here or something, haha!  After her<br/>
&gt; continual questioning and focusing on this &quot;issue&quot;, I told her my son<br/>
&gt; reads way beyond his grade level(he can read anything he wants to read,<br/>
&gt; and does all the time).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I left there with her unappreciated and unasked for advice on<br/>
&gt; school, and that is it, basicly.  What a joke!<br/>
&gt; Finally, she spoke to d.s. privately for a couple of minutes, and when<br/>
&gt; we left I asked him what she said, he told me that she asked him if he<br/>
&gt; thought he would like to go back to school or something to that<br/>
&gt; affect!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What, if anything, should I do about this?  Is this sort of thing to be<br/>
&gt; expected from a psychiatrist?  I am just so shocked.  Maybe I am living<br/>
&gt; in a bubble and this is common discrimination.  Do the rest of you deal<br/>
&gt; with this sort of nonsense?  If so, how do you deal with it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to all who read this whole thing, and thanks in advance to all<br/>
&gt; who respond.  This has really upset me and I feel so alone right now.<br/>

would not go back to her. I&#39;m sorry but I would not go back for myself or <br/>
son. Yes, I have run into this and it scared me to death at the time thinking <br/>
the therapist could do something to prevent me from hsing. I had only talked <br/>
to her once but that was all I needed. I was told the same thing that a <br/>
teacher also needed to fill out forms etc. Keep looking, hopefully you can <br/>
find someone in the hs community to refer you to someone of the same mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556631625">Hi Kelly,<br/>
   I can certainly understand why this bothered you so much!  It really makes <br/>
me mad when psychiatrists or psychologists step out of bounds to try to <br/>
impose their personal beliefs on patients and then imply that their opinions <br/>
on these issues are more valid because they are in the mental health field.<br/>
   I agree with Susan that she may not let it drop if she feels strongly <br/>
about it.  I hope that&#39;s not the case.  What you could do is make some copies <br/>
of articles related to home/unschooling and take them in to her along with a <br/>
list of books by people like John Holt and Gatto.  You could try to make the <br/>
point that although she may not personally agree with homeschooling, there <br/>
are definitely other well-thought out opinions on the matter and that her <br/>
personal opinions on this matter should not be any more valid than yours, <br/>
just as you would not have her choose your religion or lack of religion just <br/>
because she is a psychiatrist.  Homeschooling is a legal and valid choice, <br/>
whether she agrees with it or not.  She is not the voice of authority over <br/>
every issue in your life or in this country just because of her psychiatric <br/>
training.<br/>
    I agree also that she was too focused on the Dad issue.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>
sound like a very good doctor for you or your son.  Is there any way you <br/>
could find another one?  I don&#39;t see how your feelings about this can NOT <br/>
affect your own dealings with her and your therapy, unless she really comes <br/>
around to a much more respectful approach.<br/>
    Best wishes to you and good for you for all that you&#39;re doing for your <br/>
kids and yourself!  I was a single mom with my oldest and I know it&#39;s not <br/>
easy.  Take care...<br/>

  hi, <br/>
  i would like to say without a doubt you experienced full blown discrimination from many angles and if i were you i would bone up on the state laws regarding homeschooling because she may not let it drop,  despite the fact that you were the one to initiate the visit.   i don&#39;t mean to promote fear or sound paranoid but with all the fear that&#39;s flying around the country it may not be a bad idea to be fully prepared for a visit from some sort of official because in some states a dr must report situation which they feel are abusive and if she&#39;s so anti homeschooling she may interpret your son&#39;s moodiness as signs of something else.  i&#39;m not versed on the laws of washington and here in texas we have it &#39;easy&#39; but it&#39;s better to be prepared than getting caught off guard.  if you don&#39;t know the laws or where to find them i would be happy to locate and email them to you.  i&#39;m so sorry that you got the exact opposite of help.  good luck to you. <br/>
<br/>
  as far as your son goes there&#39;s been a book which has been talked about a lot on tv (i think on oprah and other shows) i think it&#39;s entitled real boys  personally i have not read it but from what i understand to get boys talking you need to do it in the context of doing something i.e. drawing, fishing, playing basketball etc.  maybe finding a hobby or an activity he really enjoys might help him find some way to express himself so both you and he can get a better understanding of his nature.   you may want to check out the site heartmath.org  it&#39;s kind of interesting.  just a thought.  i&#39;ve had no experience with hereditary mental illness but if you can get him talking it may lead both of you to a better place. <br/>

    Hello, <br/>
    I am on digest mode of this list, and have not been active on the list <br/>
    either, for some time, due to time constraints.  I am writing now to ask <br/>
    for some much needed understanding and support(help?). <br/>
<br/>
    Something happened yesterday, that made me realize my need for support, <br/>
    which will require a bit of background information, so here it is: <br/>
<br/>
    I live in WA state, and I have been homeschooling my 2 children(ages 8 & <br/>
    6) for 2+years now.  Unschooling is an informed lifestyle choice I have <br/>
    made for my family.  I am a very capable single mother, on a limited <br/>
    income(disability).  My children&#39;s father is not, and never has been <br/>
    involved in their lives.  They do have male role models, and their <br/>
    absent biological father is not a problem or an issue in my life or my <br/>
    children&#39;s at this time. <br/>
<br/>
    I also have Bipolar disorder(otherwise known as manic depression), a <br/>
    very serious, potentially life threatening(a shocking 15-20% of <br/>
    untreated bipolar sufferers commit suicide), incurable, but highly <br/>
    treatable(medication called mood stabilizers, are a must for this <br/>
    illness) neurobiological disorder of the brain, which affects mood, <br/>
    behavior, and thoughts.  It is also highly genetic and happens to run in <br/>
    both sides of my family(and possibly my children&#39;s paternal line as <br/>
    well).  I had childhood onset type(even more highly genetic) of bipolar <br/>
    disorder, as did my maternal grandfather and a maternal uncle.  My <br/>
    extended family, on both sides, is riddled with &quot;mental <br/>
    illness&quot;(paternal grandmother & grandfather, my own brother & my <br/>
    father).  As a result of all of this, I have educated myself about <br/>
    neurobioligical brain disorders(otherwise called &quot;mental illnesses&quot;), <br/>
    their symptoms, treatment, etc., and continue to do so. <br/>
<br/>
    My son(age 8.5 yrs.), who is very intelligent, smart, and wonderful & <br/>
    sweet, has been showing signs of A.D.H.D. since birth, basicly, nothing <br/>
    for which I am too concerned about other than the fact that ADD is often <br/>
    seen in children prior to onset of bipolar symptoms(a precursor sign). <br/>
    Last year, I noticed some changes in my sons mood and behavior, which <br/>
    had me concerned(he seemed depressed for about 2 weeks).  Knowing what I <br/>
    know about Bipolar disorder and that it runs in my family, I chose to <br/>
    speak to his doctor about my concerns at that time(last spring), who was <br/>
    hesitant to refer me to a specialist, nonetheless I insisted upon a <br/>
    referral.  I could not get him in at that time, since the doctor in the <br/>
    next town refused to see him, and we did not have a psychiatrist in our <br/>
    town then. <br/>
<br/>
    We now have one (her specialty is even child psychiatry), she works at <br/>
    our community mental health facility, who is also my own psychiatrist, <br/>
    and my prescribing physician.  My sons doctor recently referred him to <br/>
    her, and yesterday was his appointment. <br/>
<br/>
    I went to this appointment, expecting to address my sons&#39; mood symptoms <br/>
    and my concerns about his inheriting the family propensity for this <br/>
    illness, particularly childhood onset bipolar disorder, and what I can <br/>
    and can&#39;t do about that.  Like what can I do to help my son deal with <br/>
    his emotions, what signs should I look for, when to seek treatment if <br/>
    and when...., NOT to get him on medication(I am not even considering <br/>
    that as an option at this time), for ADD or anything else.  I have been <br/>
    told, and have read again and again, in my research on this topic, that <br/>
    it is best to have a child seen as soon at the first sign of symptoms. <br/>
    I have suspected for sometime with my son(he is so much like I was in <br/>
    everyway-and so different from my daughter).  I just wanted some <br/>
    professional advice/opinion, a professional to hear my concerns,etc., <br/>
<br/>
    I just can&#39;t believe what I actually got instead and I am infuriated by <br/>
    it.  I am also very confused, because she is my own doctor(my new pdoc), <br/>
    and I don&#39;t want my feelings concerning this to interfere with my <br/>
    developing relationship with her in that arena(because I need her to <br/>
    treat me, she is the only pdoc nearby), right now, but perhaps that is <br/>
    being unrealistic. <br/>
<br/>
    Anyway, my son&#39;s appt. was for an hour, and she spent the first part of <br/>
    that time talking to him, while I was in the room, most of it talking to <br/>
    me privately while he played in the waiting room, and about 3 minutes <br/>
    speaking to him privately.  When asked about school, he told her he was <br/>
    homeschooling.  He is kind of shy of strangers, so he was not real <br/>
    forthcoming with her, and kept saying &quot;i don&#39;t know&quot; a lot.  During the <br/>
    time she spent alone with me talking about my son, she asked me why I <br/>
    was homeschooling my kids.  I told her it is a lifestyle choice I have <br/>
    made, and something I thought about doing since Skyler was a baby. <br/>
    (It&#39;s not like something happened to make me decide this or that it was <br/>
    a sudden decision, you know?.)  She kept asking me questions like what <br/>
    grade is he in(I said &quot;he would be in 3rd grade&quot;)?, if I knew what grade <br/>
    level he was at(I said &quot;not really&quot; and was oviously not too concerned <br/>
    about it)?, and if we use a curriculum(&quot;no, we do not&quot;)?, and what about <br/>
    testing, etc.?   I was really caught off guard by this line of <br/>
    questioning, I mean I took my son to her because of my concerns about <br/>
    him having symptoms of a mood disorder!!!???  How in the hell does this <br/>
    have to do with curriculum and testing and grade level?  I am just so <br/>
    angry about this, and I feel I was discriminated against, although I am <br/>
    not sure why.  She obviously doens&#39;t understand about homeschooling, <br/>
    unschooling, or my decision to do so, and I certainly can&#39;t explain that <br/>
    to her in a nutshell in less than an hour!  But, I also felt <br/>
    discriminated against because of my having bipolar disorder and because <br/>
    I am a single parent.  She also asked lots of questions about his <br/>
    father, etc.,  She asked Skyler to list all the members of his family, <br/>
    who lives in his house, etc, and then she said &quot;what about your Dad?&quot; <br/>
    and he said &quot;I don&#39;t have a Dad.&quot;  She seemed very concerned about this, <br/>
    but the fact is that he doesn&#39;t have a Dad, and it doens&#39;t bother him or <br/>
    me(but it did bother her, it seems she didn&#39;t like his answer).  I have <br/>
    told him about his biological father as he has asked, but he is just not <br/>
    very concerned with that.  I&#39;m sure he will ask more questions as he <br/>
    matures.  Once again, other than her asking for genetic purposes, I see <br/>
    no point for her concern on this matter. <br/>
<br/>
    If you have followed me this far, please keep reading, because this is <br/>
    the important part of my story.  Now, get this: by middle of our <br/>
    converstation and her questioning, she &quot;professionally recommends&quot; to <br/>
    me, that I enroll my son in p.s., if not full-time, then part-time, <br/>
    because she says even though kids may not want to go to school all day, <br/>
    for some kids, it is actually good for them(even if they don&#39;t want to), <br/>
    because they get to be around other kids and develop relationships with <br/>
    other adults,etc., AND because she can&#39;t really diagnose him as ADD(i <br/>
    wasn&#39;t asking her to) if he&#39;s not in school, since the way that she <br/>
    usually does that is to send forms/diagnostic tests, etc., for the <br/>
    schools/teachers.  I was so shocked I could barely respond!  She could <br/>
    see I was not pleased with what she had to say, and I just told her <br/>
    plain and simple, that I was not even considering putting my children in <br/>
    ps at this time, that this was not an issue at all with me.  She asked <br/>
    if I ever planned to, and I told her if my kids ever decided they really <br/>
    wanted to go to school, then they would go(they definately do not want <br/>
    to now, I know this, and they know they can if they want).  I also made <br/>
    it clear to her my ONLY reason for concern about &quot;testing&quot; is because it <br/>
    is required by law, but not until 4th grade(am I right?).  She was <br/>
    trying to tell me testing/grade level, etc., was important so he could <br/>
    &quot;graduate&quot; from h.s.(???) and go to college.  My God, who is this woman, <br/>
    and what does any of this have to do with why I took him there?  I feel <br/>
    like I am in the twilight zone here or something, haha!  After her <br/>
    continual questioning and focusing on this &quot;issue&quot;, I told her my son <br/>
    reads way beyond his grade level(he can read anything he wants to read, <br/>
    and does all the time). <br/>
<br/>
    So, I left there with her unappreciated and unasked for advice on <br/>
    school, and that is it, basicly.  What a joke! <br/>
    Finally, she spoke to d.s. privately for a couple of minutes, and when <br/>
    we left I asked him what she said, he told me that she asked him if he <br/>
    thought he would like to go back to school or something to that <br/>
    affect!!!! <br/>
<br/>
    What, if anything, should I do about this?  Is this sort of thing to be <br/>
    expected from a psychiatrist?  I am just so shocked.  Maybe I am living <br/>
    in a bubble and this is common discrimination.  Do the rest of you deal <br/>
    with this sort of nonsense?  If so, how do you deal with it? <br/>
<br/>
    Thanks to all who read this whole thing, and thanks in advance to all <br/>
    who respond.  This has really upset me and I feel so alone right now. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, Kelly, you&#39;re not alone.  :-)  My son, Adam&#39;s, psychologist had pretty <br/>
much the same attitude.  Fortunately for me, Adam had been in ps until 6th <br/>
grade and hospitalized in 5th grade, and it was obvious that the ps school <br/>
stress was very detrimental to his mental health.  Also, since he&#39;s been <br/>
homeschooled, he has not required any medication.  Of course, that didn&#39;t <br/>
stop her from inquiring.  She finally dropped the ps idea, and began <br/>
suggesting various social activities.  Well, we finally did get Adam into a <br/>
wonderful church youth group where he feels accepted and has even made <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of funny, but when you are connected to so many home schoolers, you <br/>
forget that the world at large doesn&#39;t understand or approve.<br/>
<br/>

    What this all boils down to is that there is still very much the <br/>
implication that there is but one proper way to educate children and ours is <br/>
not it. That unless one chooses to use methods that can be studied and <br/>
approved of by some outside party ones methods are unsound. Even if the <br/>
success of the student disproves the theory that education only takes place <br/>
using approved of curricula. Scary.<br/>
