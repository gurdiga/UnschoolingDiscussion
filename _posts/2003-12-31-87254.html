<div id="ygrps-yiv-106351177">I have recently discovered Jean M Auel&#39;s series Earth&#39;s Children.  I <br/>
love it!  I have learned more about pre-historic society by reading <br/>
these books than I ever did in school.  And it&#39;s so much more <br/>
interesting than reading a text book.  I&#39;ll be saving them for my <br/>
daughter and maybe some day she&#39;ll want to read them as well.<br/>
<br/>
To get to my question though, I&#39;m on the last book and now I&#39;m <br/>
bummed that there aren&#39;t any more.  Do any of you know of any other <br/>
books that she/he has written in this same genre or know of any <br/>
other authors in this genre that would be worth checking out?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786276865">I&#39;ve been a fan of that series since the first one was written in the <br/>
1980&#39;s.  :)  I loved the 1st 4 and was really really disappointed with <br/>
the 5th book _Shelters of Stone_, but that&#39;s just me.   Jean (a she ;&#39;) <br/>
is working on book #6 but I don&#39;t know when it will be released.  She <br/>
has not written books other than this series that I know of.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840361124">I started reading the series when I was probably 19 maybe my early <br/>
20&#39;s. I am 39 now. I read them with a blanket, over a heater vent <br/>
and loved every second. I still have not read the last book. The <br/>
newest one.. Because waiting was so hard. There is nothing else that <br/>
she has written as far as I know.. But reread them. There is so much <br/>
you miss because they are so detail oriented. This is my in envy of <br/>
your Auel experience. <br/>

<br/>
I &#39;ve cracked open Isle of Woman by Piers Anthony,<br/>
it&#39;s about evolution, and follows two people&#39;s lives<br/>
in those pre-historic times.  Not nearly as good as<br/>
Auel&#39;s books, ( altho the most recent book in the<br/>
Earth&#39;s Children series was annoyingly redundant, I<br/>
thought.)<br/>
<br/>
  Auel has seemingly devoted her entire writing career<br/>
to *only* this series, doing years of research before<br/>
writing each book. <br/>

<br/>
I read Clan of the Cave Bear, and learned that one woman invented archery and <br/>
horseback riding, and... what all else?   And I learned the sexual practices <br/>
of a cave society.  NOT!!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not familiar with &quot;Earth&#39;s Children,&quot; but beware of fiction from periods <br/>
where guesses are based on so little, as far as considering it historically <br/>
accurate.  But as a spark and a jumping-off place to read what really is known, <br/>
such things can be really great.<br/>
<br/>
(Another argument against single-source info.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just recently read The Kin by Peter Dickinson. It&#39;s billed as Jean Auel <br/>
for children, and it works that way for me too. (Jean Auel without the <br/>
highly predictable - after a couple of books - sex scenes). &lt;g&gt; Anyway, I <br/>
found it fascinating. Now I&#39;m reading his book, The Ropemaker. More fantasy <br/>
than prehistoric. Good though.<br/>
