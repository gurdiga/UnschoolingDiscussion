<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686304923">When my sons were younger they had to do chores without money because<br/>
they are part of the household.They still have chores to do that they<br/>
don&#39;t get paid for,for the same reason.We could never afford to give<br/>
allowance until the past year,due to me having my own homebased business<br/>
now.The boys mow the grass for no pay,clean up kitchen and do dishes and<br/>
clean rooms for no pay.If there are extra jobs though ,they may get pay<br/>
for that.It depends.My youngest wants to get paid for everything!I can<br/>
see him starting his own business at 15!!!LOLOL....deb<br/>

&gt; Hi all:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feedback would be great about this money stuff with kids... When did some of<br/>
&gt; you start to give your kids money and did they have to do chores for that<br/>
&gt; money?  Were they expected to do chores anyway and then you gave them the<br/>
&gt; money just because?  Extra money for extra chores?  What age did you start<br/>
&gt; this?  Did you talk to them about money at this age and how to save and<br/>
&gt; spend?  We haven&#39;t introduced Zak to pocket money yet so we are not sure when<br/>
&gt; and if to do that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What has been your experience of this issue?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760567091">hi! we have done it 2 ways- first was weekly allowance they earned equal to <br/>
half their age: for example, 7 yo would get $3.50. the number of chores was <br/>
equal to their age-7 yo did 7 chores. some are weekly chores-clean out bunny <br/>
cages, put out recycle, etc. i paid them on a weekly basis and that $ could <br/>
be spent on what they wanted, within limits: no gum unless sugarfree, no <br/>
chewy candy, no war toys (yes, i am the world&#39;s meanest mom!) that was too <br/>
long for them to wait for their money-impulsive like mommy!  also, the oldest <br/>
child was doing way less than the others, so there was always a fight to get <br/>
him to work-not worth it. now we do it differently: i asked them how many <br/>
chores they felt they could handle and figured out some age-appropriate jobs. <br/>
they get paid 10 cents a chore-yes some jobs are bigger than others, but i <br/>
could not get that complicated or my head would fall off! when they fill up a <br/>
little sign with 20 stars on it, they get paid $2. i got the sign at a <br/>
religious items store. yes, alfie kohn would be horrified (author of <br/>
&quot;punished by rewards&quot;) but it works for us for now! some examples of jobs at <br/>
our house:<br/>
13 yob-<br/>
feed &water & exercise bunnies & chickens & duck a.m. and p.m., clean cages <br/>
weekly, clear table and sweep kitchen floor at night<br/>
<br/>
8 yob-<br/>
feed & water &exercise guinea pig daily a.m. & p.m., clean cage twice a week, <br/>
take garbage & recycle to cans several times a day, to curb & back twice a <br/>
week---13 yob was fired from this job because he never brought the cans back <br/>
till whenever and we got a $50 ticket!!!!!!!!!!---- unload dishwasher 2 to 3 <br/>
times a day, watch baby while mommy showers,clean living room of toys 3 <br/>
evenings a week, and toy rooms the other 3 nights, strap baby into car seat-i <br/>
know, sounds dangerous, but she is 20 months old now and car door is shut!  <br/>
notice how much more he does than his older brother!<br/>
<br/>
5 yob-<br/>
brush teeth twice a day, buckle self into booster seat-he is still only 39 <br/>
pounds!, amuse baby in car--she hates the car seat!, set the table for <br/>
dinner, clean the toy room and living room three nights a week each.<br/>
<br/>
HTH,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids started earning extra when they each turned 8. The youngest two<br/>
wanted jobs to do too so we gave them some paying jobs too. We made the<br/>
wages age appropriate. 50 cents a day for daily jobs and if you did all<br/>
your jobs every day without being nagged then you got double allowance<br/>
at the end of the week.<br/>
Nathan put over $200 away in a year .<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve gotten away from that style of payment but I think it&#39;ll be<br/>
revised and we&#39;ll be using that method again shortly (they&#39;re all a lot<br/>
older and can handle different more complex responsibilities now so they<br/>
should be paid accordingly).<br/>
<br/>
They all either help or do their own laundry. The oldest (14 ) is<br/>
responsible for the supper dishes and puts out the recylables to the<br/>
curb once a week.She is responsible for our puppy in the evenings.<br/>
<br/>
The 10 yob gets to take the trash out once a week. He helps with puppy<br/>
and is the official pooper scooper.<br/>
<br/>
The youngest 8 1/2 yog just likes to help so she helps with little<br/>
things like folding tea towels and dish cloths etc. She is always asking<br/>
to help in the kitchen with baking etc ... not just licking the spoons<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
We pay for a job when it is completed satisfactorily they are told<br/>
what&#39;s expected and have it demonstrated a couple of times (like<br/>
cleaning a bathroom or washing a floor) and if you don&#39;t do it right the<br/>
first time then you have to go back and do it right to be paid.<br/>
<br/>
Some people think that&#39;s harsh. We don&#39;t force them to do this. They are<br/>
expected to do their regular chores. We&#39;ll buy them an ice cream ,toy,<br/>
kit or a soda when we&#39;re out shopping etc, so it&#39;s not a case of them<br/>
having to earn to buy that kind of thing for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
They do have to earn though to buy those pokemon cards that I refuse to<br/>
buy or get clothes that I figure they don&#39;t need or are frivolous. They<br/>
can earn and spend their own cash on that kind of thing. There is always<br/>
a closet that needs cleaning out or weeds to be pulled or canning that I<br/>
could use help with etc.<br/>
There are plenty of opportunities to earn hard cash around here!<br/>
