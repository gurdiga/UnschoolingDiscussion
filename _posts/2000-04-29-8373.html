<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049681363"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Olivia, I went to B&N today and found those Science<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Magazines for you. The first one is Science At Home.<br/>
They have a web site but I could find no phone #.<br/>
scienceathome.com  <br/>
the second mag is Scientific American Explorations<br/>
phone # to order is 1-800-333-1199 <br/>
Scientific American does have a web site but I do not<br/>
have the url. You could search it out though. Hope<br/>
this helps. Both mags look great, lots of hands on. <br/>
Good luck!<br/>
Jill<br/>
