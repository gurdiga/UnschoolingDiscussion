  I dislike flame wars and to tell the truth, have never been in one before now.  It just seemed more wrong to say nothing than to say something in defense of my religion.  It saddens me to see such scorn of a truly beautiful faith. <br/>
  what flame war? <br/>
  and <br/>
  who/ what was said that was against your religion? <br/>
  did i miss something? <br/>

I wasn&#39;t going to say anything, because it seemed like maybe it was an issue <br/>
of mine,,,,why i reacted to this,,,,,,but,,,,geeezzzzz,,,,,it&#39;s a free <br/>
country right,,,and an open forum here.<br/>
I took that remark to mean: if i don&#39;t agree, i should be blessed anyways.  <br/>
And indicating that someone might have &#39;missed it&#39; just because they didn&#39;t <br/>
agree.<br/>
And i&#39;m sorry if this offends anyone, but i believe i am blessed just <br/>
because.  I am a loving person, and if i don&#39;t agree with certain beliefs, i <br/>
am not any &#39;less blessed&#39;.  I have only been on this list for a few weeks, <br/>
but have always felt it was a very inclusive space,,,,and i know it&#39;s not <br/>
intended as a space for religious views.<br/>
But,,,sorry,,,here i go,,,, i believe i was born in love, not in sin,,,and i <br/>
choose to see that in others,,,,,,,,and i have a real problem with the &#39;God <br/>
bless us all anyway&#39;--<br/>

God bless us all<br/>
