<div id="ygrps-yiv-874048728">Just wanted to say I&#39;ve really enjoyed all the information and advice you&#39;ve <br/>
been giving one another these last few days.  Unschooling is new to me; but <br/>
I am very interested and believe this is the direction we&#39;re to go in.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been homeschooling for two years now.  The first year was rough, as I <br/>
imagine the first year is for anyone.  This year has been much more relaxed <br/>
and more enjoyable.  We used the Five In a Row unit studies.<br/>
My daughter has been an unschooler.  We just didn&#39;t know it.  :)  She&#39;s been <br/>
able to read since she was 3.  I began teaching my son Kindergarten lessons <br/>
and she insisted on joining.  So, she&#39;s learned a lot in these past two <br/>
years, not being &quot;made to&quot; do ANYTHING.  She&#39;s learned just by her own <br/>
desire to know and not be left out of anything.<br/>
My son on the other hand, I feel, has been squashed a bit by the pressure <br/>
that I&#39;ve put on him from time to time (Bad Mommy!!!) to swallow all the <br/>
info. I was giving him.  He&#39;s doing well.  But, from what I&#39;ve been reading <br/>
in your e-mails and on a few different websites; he would do much better if <br/>
we just relaxed and allowed things to progress at a more natural pace.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the idea of letting the kids pursue their own interests.<br/>
Many times in the last couple of years they have interrupted me to ask more <br/>
detailed questions and desiring to pursue another subject that tied into the <br/>
one we had been discussing.  Sometimes I was too uptight to allow this <br/>
natural progression to run its course.  (Doggone, me!)  But, when I have <br/>
lightened up and gone with the flow, it&#39;s always been a great delight to me <br/>
and the kids.  They never cease to amaze me...some of the things they think <br/>
of.  :)<br/>
<br/>
By the way...Gus, I really enjoyed what you wrote about your own educational <br/>
experiences in free-schooling.  Very interesting!<br/>
<br/>
Well, my little natives are getting restless.  So, I&#39;d better hit the road.  <br/>
You all have a wonderful day Friday!!!   :)  :)  :)<br/>
