 </span></blockquote>i don&#39;t know what to tell you, other than check your spam folder if <br/>
you are on 9.0. they&#39;ve been dumping a lot in there that doesn&#39;t <br/>
belong, and doing weird things because of this newest email virus, <br/>
the mydoom worm. and technical support via the 800 number is <br/>
basically useless in general, LOL. <br/>
<br/>
even yahoo is blocking email with certain subjects, see the important <br/>
message at the top of the page of your yahoo groups: <br/>
groups.yahoo.com.....<br/>
<br/>
i read this group at the website when i have the time, not often <br/>
because of the volume, but i noticed the volume is strangely down <br/>
from what i remember....maybe others aren&#39;t getting their mail <br/>
either, and won&#39;t even see your request...<br/>
<br/>
ang, posting from the website....an email i sent here a little <br/>
earlier is not showing up here either....</div>

couple of days. I can&#39;t see anything wrong with the list, just that <br/>
people are not posting.<br/>
