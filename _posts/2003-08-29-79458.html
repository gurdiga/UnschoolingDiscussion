My next question is this: Did anyone notice (ask the kids) an <br/>
employee taking water samples for reading? This should have been done <br/>
every 2 hours with that high a load. Samples are supposed to be taken <br/>
while people are in the water. Their pool is small; it&#39;s easy for the <br/>
water to change in a two hour time period.<br/>
I was out on the deck the vast majority of the time there. No one came out to <br/>
do samples, not even early morning. (I was out there chatting with the former <br/>
drill sergeant from Fort Jackson who now fiddles around the hotel.)<br/>

It makes me sad, I&#39;ve almost said something a few times, but noticed that at this time of the year, saying something anti-schoolish is like diving into a shark feeding frenzy, these women get nutty! <br/>

I feel so out of it. There are a few other unschoolers in the area, and we have a local group, but it&#39;s pretty slow most of the time. Any ideas on how to perk it up?<br/>

about unti studies and planned topics. Not one person has said their <br/>
kids initiated any of it :-(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Get one of them ultra violet lights and strew the house in white party <br/>
string and white webs. It makes it glow. Looks great. We also made a box <br/>
of worms for the kids. Painted the outside then filled it with cold <br/>
spagetti and little gifts so the kids had to feel inside :-)<br/>
Turn off all the lights apart from the UV lamp and have pumpkins with <br/>
candles in for light. And don;t forget to hang spiders from everything.<br/>
There ya go :-)<br/>

Then I start dropping hints about relaxing a bit, pushing the curriculum<br/>
aside and learning from life, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But people do act like you&#39;re anti-American or something if you&#39;re not<br/>
caught up in the back-to-school frenzy!  Sheesh.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So far we&#39;ve been on a cleaning out, organizing, simplifying rampage.<br/>
Getting rid of some junk, sending stuff to people who&#39;ll actually use it,<br/>
etc.  I can find things in my basement storeroom now.  That was kinda<br/>
exciting.  It&#39;s been so satisfying, I plan to continue it as long as I can<br/>
stand the fun.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, we&#39;ve got loads of small trips we want to take.  Tim and I<br/>
have agreed that we need to take one trip every week, just to make sure we<br/>
get out and do some of them.  (With my husband away long-term, I get stalled<br/>
at home, so the once a week isn&#39;t an educational requirement, more of a<br/>
mental health jolt for Mom!)<br/>
<br/>
I live within an hour or two (driving) of 6 castles, an old Roman fort, at<br/>
least a dozen museums, the Birkenstock factory, more indoor swimming pools<br/>
than I can count, a couple of forest preserve kind of places, the Tanaus<br/>
&quot;Mountains&quot; (hills, but they call them mountains here...), and heaven knows<br/>
what all else.  So I&#39;m going to see some of it this year!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that&#39;s pending my car being fixed (again).  It got jealous of my<br/>
shiny rental cars while I was in the states and isn&#39;t running now.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And finally, sorry, Rebecca, but I know nothing about haunted houses!<br/>

<br/>
We love to do haunted houses.  More than anything, you need to set <br/>
the mood; darkness, weird, soft light (strange angles or flickering <br/>
is good), scarey sounds and soft eerie music.  <br/>
<br/>
Hanging groups threads from various places will freak people out.  <br/>
You can&#39;t see them like fake webs but you *feel* them. &lt;shudder&gt; The <br/>
startle effect is the best way to scare even if it turns out to be <br/>
something funny.  Have someone who&#39;s hiding just reach out and <br/>
lightly touch people as they go by or jump out and then run.  A loud <br/>
bumb like a door slam when it&#39;s quiet works too.<br/>
<br/>
Always have someone behind the scenes making subtle noises; shaking <br/>
chains, moving things around, maoning, squeaking doors and banging.  <br/>
Critters moving along the floor like a wind up toy is fun.  Always, <br/>
always tell a story to go with the house of something terrible that <br/>
happened there and all the strange things that happen that are always <br/>
worse on HALLOWEEN!<br/>
<br/>
Most of it should be understanded.  Let people&#39;s imaginations do all <br/>
the work.  Trying to be very obvious just looks really fake.  <br/>
<br/>
The scariest thing that I&#39;ve ever experienced was riding on a haunted <br/>
hayride and the person next to me suddenly disappeared when someone <br/>
silently reached up and grabbed her.  She was a part of it obviously <br/>
but stuck on that wagon on a road in the dark NH night it just about <br/>
made me wet my pants!<br/>
