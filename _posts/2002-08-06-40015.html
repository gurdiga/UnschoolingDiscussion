<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649544500">Hi, Tanya.  I just had to write when I saw that you are planning to do the same thing my dh and I are - selling out and hitting the road.  I first started exploring unschooling in response to our dream (our dd is 4).  Unfortunately, we&#39;ll be another year getting things in order and then will probably start small, with month long trips and then a return home.  Can you imagine a better way to teach our kids about their country?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I truly envy someone with the means to pack it all in and just go! (We could <br/>
not live w/o an income) I have often suggested to Darin that he become a <br/>
truck driver, we sell all our stuff, exchange the pc for a laptop and go! If <br/>
the kids and I got tired of riding for a while we could rent a place for a <br/>
month or so, every time in a different location. Wouldn&#39;t that be fun! Darin <br/>
just gives me a funny look and wonders aloud where I get these ideas. I think <br/>
it would be a blast! Like modern day nomads. :::sigh:::<br/>

 </span></blockquote>that is why we will be doing mini trips this year, and taking the summer <br/>
break when dh won&#39;t be working or teaching to travel. We wouldn&#39;t be able <br/>
to afford it otherwise. I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re already mapping out places we <br/>
want to go!<br/>
