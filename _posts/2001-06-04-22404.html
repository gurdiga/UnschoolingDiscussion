&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1288<br/>
&gt;Date: Mon, Jun 4, 2001, 1:37 AM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was questioning the origins of the need for structure. It is nature or<br/>
&gt; nurture - learned or just a personality type.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it can be either. I am, by nature, a very organized and structured<br/>
person. I keep lists. I organize underwear by color. I alphabetize the<br/>
spices and keep Rubbermaid in business. I have always been this way.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t like to be organized by someone else (i.e, told what to do<br/>
&lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
With children in school (or school-at-home environments) I think they<br/>
sometimes/often/usually get to the stage where they are DEPENDENT upon<br/>
others organizing them. Consider the &quot;I&#39;m bored!!!&quot; refrain from schooled<br/>
children in the summer. No one to tell them what to do, ergo they don&#39;t KNOW<br/>
what to do, and don&#39;t know how to find out.<br/>
<br/>
I think knowing how to un-bore yourself is one of the most supremely<br/>
valuable life skills unschoolers can offer their children. This is also<br/>
called &quot;motivation&quot;.<br/>

But how would you feel if your husband insisted you do these things, whether<br/>
you wanted to or not? Or your Mother? Or your landlord? Or the bank that<br/>
holds the mortgage to your home?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, you already answered that you would not like that. I just think<br/>
it&#39;s interested to take the situations where we express our personality and<br/>
change them to see how we&#39;d feel as adults if we were treated the way<br/>
children are treated in schools. It seems ludicrous and an infringement on<br/>
our personal rights and freedoms as adults but as children some people (many<br/>
people) consider it essential. Important. Normal. To be expected.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for this reminder. My son had a really sad breakdown today (finally)<br/>
about the school/homeschool thing and how much he couldn&#39;t handle the<br/>
thought of (once again) leaving friends. I backed off a bit and told him<br/>
we&#39;d talk more in the fall. Later we had a MUCH better conversation about<br/>
the benefits of homeschooling and he brought up some points of his own on<br/>
things he would look forward to about homeschooling. But he still has a very<br/>
very sad look in his eye when he talks about the pothos plant he volunteered<br/>
to take care of at home over the summer and bring back in the fall &quot;whether<br/>
I still go there or not&quot;. He is a REALLY hard kid to read and I REALLY hate<br/>
having the responsibility of having to decide this. It is helpful to have<br/>
reminders about some of the paramount reasons he would be damaged by public<br/>
schools. I just hope I don&#39;t damage him just as much or more at home :-(<br/>

The ability to take orders can be really important.  Some people love the <br/>

<br/>
But at home, with kids, it&#39;s the kind of hard call we&#39;re all having to make, <br/>
or have made and sometimes wonder about.  One size doesn&#39;t fit all.  I have a <br/>
child who really doesn&#39;t care where he eats.  He&#39;s happy just to be with the <br/>
people he&#39;s with and will go with the flow.  This frightens me when he&#39;s out <br/>
with kids I don&#39;t totally trust.  School teaches people to go with the flow <br/>
and not to tattle, pretty much.  That frightens me.  But whatever the <br/>
situation, some kids thrive and some don&#39;t (it seems, on first thought, and <br/>
there are probably exceptions).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103309784">we have been dealing with situations occuring that my 11 yo will say something to me about and my 14 yo (who just decided to come back to homeschooling after almost six years of public schooling) will harass him and call him a tattler when it is something that should be intervened with. Just go with the flow is one of his favorite comments. He can have a very mean streak frequently. i try to give my children as much choice as I can, but we do have some boundaries. One is no namecalling or rude comments. If you disagree with someone or don&#39;t like what they are doing, express that. you have the right to say no or tell someone to stop when they violate your privacy or personal space. I have two children who seem to thrive on sarcastic, rude comments and putting other people down. One is my niece who only is with us for a little while. the other is the 14 yo. Any suggestions to help them let go of these harmful habits?<br/>
