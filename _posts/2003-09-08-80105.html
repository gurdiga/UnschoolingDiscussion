That is our second son who died when he was 12mos, 22days old.  Maybe I<br/>

have you tried subbing the dashes for slashes? It may be clearer.<br/>

It&#39;s really wierd how things happen.  Connections.<br/>
I was just redoing my profile at unschooling.com message boards.<br/>
I added a picture of my kids, then I started reading others profiles <br/>
and I saw Sandra had added some topics to hers and one was &quot;kids&quot; and <br/>
she listed hers.  I decided that would be cool and I just finished.<br/>
I have two children who have died.  Many here know of Sam, but I also <br/>
lost a baby over 10 years ago.  I was 8 mos. pregnant with him, when <br/>
he got so tangled up in the umbilicle cord that he cut off his oxygen.<br/>
We had known he was a boy and had already named him Jay.<br/>
I had trouble figuring out how to put him in my list of kids with <br/>
dates (he really only had one).  I ended up writing;<br/>
<br/>
Carly 9/7/90,  Jay- died 3/1/93 (I was 8 mos. pregnant with him), Sam <br/>
2/14/94 - 1/19/03,  Jack  10/19/96,   Jamie 5/21/99<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it took me a while to get that right, then I come here and <br/>
there is a whole thread on listing your kids and the confusion with <br/>
dates of those who have died.  Wierd....<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.<br/>
