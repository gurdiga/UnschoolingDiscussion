<div id="ygrps-yiv-582552656">Hi Everyone!  I&#39;ve been lurking here only a couple of weeks but felt<br/>
the need to jump in here.<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter with so many food allergies that the board certified<br/>
ped allergist we took her to asked me what I was gonna do about it (of<br/>
course then he proceeded to write a really bad review of me in the<br/>
files you are not supposed to see...)...long story that&#39;s not relevant<br/>
here.  (She literally tested positive to every food in the American<br/>
diet...until they ran out of blood sample...)<br/>
<br/>
I have always let my kids have pretty much whatever they want...within<br/>
limits set by DH & myself out of necessity (severe eczema is no picnic<br/>
for anyone let alone a 2 yr old).  As she&#39;s grown older we&#39;ve allowed<br/>
her more & more choices (expanding those limits) to the point that she<br/>
currently eats whatever she wants to...IF she wants to.  She reads<br/>
labels for the worst allergens (in our case soy is the worst) and asks<br/>
questions even at restaurants (she is 9 in a couple of weeks).<br/>
<br/>
In our home we only keep items that are &quot;safe&quot; for her (thankfully no<br/>
one else has food allergies or it&#39;d be really difficult, but not<br/>
impossible)...that way whenever we are out & about she can choose<br/>
whether or not to eat the &quot;bad&quot; foods.  She knows what they are & that<br/>
if she eats them she will prolly be taking Benadryl (which she hates<br/>
because it makes her soooo tired).<br/>
<br/>
I believe that as the parents it is our responsibility to decide what<br/>
is in our children&#39;s best interest and therefore we make the initial<br/>
choice of what to bring into the home and she can choose anything from<br/>
that...<br/>
<br/>
We have the responsibility to ensure our daughter&#39;s safety & if an<br/>
allergy is bad enough to cause problems (even if they are not<br/>
life-threatening...quality of life is a valid issue in my mind) then<br/>
WE are responsible for managing it...UNTIL such time as they can<br/>
manage it themselves.  When they are little they should not have to<br/>
shoulder the burden of an allergy and avoiding the offending<br/>
foods...WE should do that until they can learn by talking/explaining<br/>
things to them & providing them &quot;safe&quot; choices.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend that also has a daughter about the same age with<br/>
allergies & she has always restricted/limited what, when, etc.  She&#39;s<br/>
always sneaking off the eat the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; and she doesn&#39;t<br/>
really know what or why she can&#39;t have it.<br/>
<br/>
DD does not eat anything different from anyone else, because we as a<br/>
family only eat items that are safe FOR HER until she is old enough to<br/>
understand & accept that others do not have to be selective. (all for<br/>
one & one for all!)  We&#39;ve always felt it unfair to have DD eat<br/>
something that we wouldn&#39;t eat ourselves so...<br/>
<br/>
I think this has helped her more than anything...seeing us eat the<br/>
same foods without the comments all the time about wouldn&#39;t it be nice<br/>
if we could have...she just thinks these are normal foods. :)<br/>
<br/>
My kids make such good choices when eating that it sometimes puts me<br/>
to shame... :D<br/>
<br/>
No one in our house has a sweet tooth (although good chocolate is the<br/>
one exception)...which is really awful for someone that loves to bake<br/>
desserts. :(  No one eats them so I make enough to quell my need to<br/>
bake then freeze for those times we can&#39;t/don&#39;t bake.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this has gotten so long...I&#39;ll go back to lurking now...<br/>
<br/>

I love this attitude! This is the perfect example (IMHO) of unschooling with <br/>
comrades (your family members). I don&#39;t see anything wrong with stacking the <br/>
deck with healthy foods, modeling (as long as it&#39;s sincere and silent) and <br/>
sticking together by not eating things one of the family &quot;can&#39;t have&quot;. That&#39;s <br/>
teamwork!<br/>
<br/>
To fill the home with kool-aid, soda, food with additives etc. is to grow a <br/>
child who will possibly develop a taste for them. I am all for allowing a child <br/>
to eat whatever they want - out of all healthy choices. I would never ever <br/>
buy those foods/drinks and that is not because I&#39;d limit my child, but because I <br/>
loathe those foods and the companies that produce them. I think being <br/>
socially and nutritionally responsible does help shape a child&#39;s eating <br/>
habits........and to me that is a good thing. I was a bit taken aback to find out that many <br/>
people on this list buy soda, junk food etc. If not just for the <br/>
non-consumerist, non-peer pressured lifestyles I was figuring you all lead.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve seen &quot;Supersize Me&quot; or read any of the health reports then you know <br/>
that fast food can be addicting. I think it&#39;s wrong to assume just because a <br/>
child is unschooled they cannot become addicted to something that is added to <br/>
food to make it addicting. I am not saying they definitely will either. But <br/>
it&#39;s a gamble.<br/>
<br/>
If my child couldn&#39;t have milk but I knew they loved milk based products and <br/>
kept them in the house anyway I would expect temptation. I would feel <br/>
terrible! I would find substitutes that tasted like the milk based products so he/she <br/>
would be sated.<br/>
Have you ever tried coconut milk ice cream? It is even better than milk based <br/>
ice cream! <br/>
I got the recipe on mothering.com<br/>
<br/>
That said, I am a newbie/lurker here. I did wait my two weeks :)<br/>
I hope it&#39;s OK if I jump in..........I love reading the threads on this list.<br/>
My daughter is only 10 months old but I think I am already unschooling <br/>
(nursing on request, practicing elimination communication, co-sleeping, babywearing, <br/>
cue following, unlimited comforting) so I thought I&#39;d like to hear others <br/>
experience and participate when I can. <br/>

But we don&#39;t live in a bubble.  So even though my kids really only ask for<br/>
foods they&#39;ve tried (so far- they are 8 and 10), they do try stuff at other<br/>
people&#39;s houses.  So, that would mean that when my child comes home and asks<br/>
for Poptarts, because she had them at my brother&#39;s house, that I would have<br/>
to be controlling and say &quot;no&quot; to keep my house full of only nutritionally<br/>
healthy foods.  Controlling what my child eats, isn&#39;t going to strengthen my<br/>
relationship with them, in fact, it&#39;s going to break it down and possibly<br/>
create food issues at the same time.  I think it&#39;s better to have many<br/>
healthy options at my house, to respect my child&#39;s love of Poptarts by<br/>
buying them, and to model good eating habits and discuss nutrition<br/>
(occasionally) with them.  I think when your oldest child is still a baby,<br/>
it&#39;s hard to know what you will do with them when they are older.  At least<br/>
I&#39;ve changed my views a lot since my kids were babies.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
In the same way that I don&#39;t call some books &quot;educational&quot; and others  <br/>
&quot;crap,&quot; I don&#39;t call some food &quot;healthy&quot; and some &quot;junk.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I think all publications are equally valuable.  I  don&#39;t <br/>
shop in bookstores with a blindfold on and just buy the first book I pick  up <br/>
that feels good in my hand.  It doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t tell the difference  <br/>
between apples and Apple Jacks.  If I tell a child that an apple will cure  him and <br/>
Apple Jacks will kill him, I&#39;d be a big liar.<br/>
 <br/>
Some parents DO speak of food in very extreme terms, and branding anything  <br/>
&quot;junk&quot; is a good example of that.  <br/>
 <br/>
Pop Tarts are bought here about once every two years, for a big  campout.  <br/>
The next year, the leftovers from the year before are usually  still around, <br/>
which is why not EVERY year.  The kids like the strawberry or  cinnamon/brown <br/>
sugar pop tarts, not the sprinkly sparkly pink stuff.  In  northern New Mexico <br/>
there are two traditional foods that are the traditional  precursors of <br/>
poptarts.  One is a Hispanic fruit pie, not quite as flat,  called a couple of things, <br/>
but &quot;empanadas,&quot; sometimes.  It will have jelly  or preserves in a round <br/>
piece of dough folded over and crimped shut and  baked.  Then there&#39;s a Pueblo <br/>
Indian version often made with a prune  filling, but sometimes other fruit, <br/>
usually made in the winter (Christmas and  winter feasts) and they&#39;re made flat in <br/>
a pan and sliced.  They&#39;re as flat  as pop-tarts, but the edges aren&#39;t sealed. <br/>
 In Europe in the Middle Ages  such little pies were common too, and still in <br/>
bakeries you can find them, but  they tend to be fatter and raised now, maybe <br/>
partly because the storage and  transportation of bakery-to-home-in-a-car <br/>
isn&#39;t much problem and they don&#39;t need  to be flat and stackable.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s easier to just declare it &quot;junk.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
But as to peer pressure, my kids don&#39;t eat ANYthing because of peer  <br/>
pressure, but a lot of people I know who shun certain foods or t-shirts with  cartoon <br/>
characters or modern pop music or video games do clearly and absolutely  pick <br/>
those attitudes up from peer pressure, and often from mothering groups  where <br/>
the goal is to be more-natural-than-thou.<br/>
 <br/>
The first assumption of people who know we have sodas and cookies is  <br/>
probably to think that the kids wake up and lunge for them, or have a soda in  one <br/>
hand and a cookie on the other and a dopey grin all day.   At the  moment, there <br/>
are homemade lemon cookies in the cookie jar and a bowl of  dum-dums (all the <br/>
flavors Holly doesn&#39;t like, and they sit and sit; Keith will  eventually take <br/>
them to work and leave them on the snack table).<br/>
 <br/>
What I saw eaten yesterday was tuna & egg salad on homemade bread,  grilled <br/>
cheese on that bread, leftover spaghetti, a boca burger (Holly made her  own <br/>
while Keith and I were out getting free scrapwood), Marty and Kirby went to  a <br/>
friend&#39;s family birthday dinner (friend turning 22, celebrated at home with  <br/>
parents and grandparents and three or five friends, two of which were my teen  <br/>
boys).   Holly and I had sourdough English muffins with cream cheese  and <br/>
cherry butter.  She drank milk, I had tea.<br/>
 <br/>
My kids make better food choices than my husband does, and I think it&#39;s  <br/>
directly attributable to his growing up with limitations, measurement, pressure  <br/>
to finish, pressure to STOP, and shaming.  He learned to eat at home and  then <br/>
eat elsewhere too.  He ate to feel better.  My kids only eat when  they&#39;re <br/>
hungry.  They don&#39;t eat for emotional comfort.  They don&#39;t  even eat socially.  <br/>
They&#39;re all really fine with going to a restaurant with  hungry friends and <br/>
just having a drink instead of a meal.  They&#39;re not  &quot;dessert trained.&quot;  They <br/>
will say, &quot;No thanks, I&#39;ve already eaten,&quot; instead  of eating even if it&#39;s their <br/>
favorite food.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s amazing.<br/>
 <br/>
But it couldn&#39;t happen unless they had real freedom of choice.<br/>
 <br/>
I wrote it better here:<br/>
 <br/>
--------------<br/>
 <br/>
Holly says the ice cream we have in the freezer is too sweet. She had  <br/>
chocolate milk last night and said there was too much chocolate in it, so she  <br/>
divided it and made chocolate milk for someone else with half of it. She usually  <br/>
prefers plain milk.  <br/>
Plain milk tastes WAY better if it&#39;s your choice than if does when it&#39;s plain <br/>
 because someone else wouldn&#39;t let you put chocolate in it.  <br/>
Without free choice, how can a person choose what is plain and good?  <br/>

(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/respect)">http://sandradodd.com/respect)</a>  <br/>
but it&#39;s not just about food, it&#39;s about abundance and awareness and  <br/>
respect) <br/>

about.  My kids try &quot;junk&quot; foods primarily at my mother&#39;s house, and <br/>
for the most part, they are content to eat them there, and don&#39;t really <br/>
ask for them at home.  But, we live 10 hour&#39;s drive away from my Mom, <br/>
and she loves to send the girls packages -- which they love to get, of <br/>
course :-).  This is where most of the candy in my house comes from.  I <br/>
could tell my mom not to put candy in the package, and she would <br/>
respect my wishes, but I feel like that would be interfering <br/>
unnecessarily in her relationship with my kids, and their relationship <br/>
with her.  I want my kids to have a wonderful, close, loving <br/>
relationship with their Nonni, and I know from personal experience that <br/>
providing material things is the way she expresses love best.  (It&#39;s <br/>
not the only way, but it is the dominant one.)  I could focus on the <br/>
fact that that&#39;s not the way I think is best, yadda yadda, but really, <br/>
I think my kids will be better off eating a little more candy and <br/>
feeling like they have a mother who is happy for them when they get <br/>
treats in the mail, rather than one who takes part of the fun out of <br/>
their relationship with their grandma.<br/>

my child&#39;s love of Pop tarts by buying them, and to model good eating <br/>
habits and discuss nutrition (occasionally) with them. ==<br/>
<br/>
No, we don&#39;t live in a bubble, but nor do we live in a binary world <br/>
where the only options are buy Poptarts and not buy Poptarts.<br/>
<br/>
I have a son who is sensitive to corn syrup, which means that on a <br/>
regular basis we do not have food with corn syrup in the house, though <br/>
he&#39;s free to choose whatever  he&#39;d like when we&#39;re out. I tell him when <br/>
a food likely has corn syrup in it, and sometimes he&#39;ll choose to skip <br/>
it, other times he&#39;ll eat it. It&#39;s pretty hard to escape in the world of <br/>
restaurants and hotels, so we&#39;ll all notice a significant difference by <br/>
the end of a vacation. It&#39;s not a life or death thing, so we&#39;re lucky in <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
This has meant that at home we do an incredible amount of <br/>
experimentation. We&#39;ve found so many wonderful substitutes for most <br/>
snack foods and treat foods, that none of us miss corn syrup and, in <br/>
fact, find we PREFER foods without it because other foods taste too <br/>
sweet. Breyer&#39;s ice cream is delicious, Nature&#39;s Path makes a very tasty <br/>
oreo cookie, I make many foods from scratch. There are choices out there <br/>
that can satisfy both taste and health.<br/>
<br/>
Point is, if my kids came home from a friend&#39;s house, asking for <br/>
poptarts, we&#39;d go on a mission to find some we liked and that felt <br/>
healthy to us. We&#39;d buy all the brands we could find that didn&#39;t have <br/>
corn syrup and do taste tests. We&#39;d try making our own at home. There <br/>
are lots of other options, and if we couldn&#39;t find one that satisfied, <br/>
then we&#39;d likely decide that the poptarts would be a once in a while <br/>
treat rather than something we&#39;d have in the house as a regular choice.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something in between villifying foods as evil and eating them <br/>
thoughtlessly. Not all foods are created equal. Some foods do more to <br/>
help our bodies than other foods. The danger, as I see it, is when we <br/>
begin to confuse in our own minds and in our words the &quot;research shows&quot; <br/>
kind of stuff with absolute truth for all people and all bodies at all <br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
Not all research is created equal, and it&#39;s quite easy to go out and <br/>
find research saying how bad soy is and how good soy is, how bad meat is <br/>
and how good meat is. It&#39;s just not a definitive science. When I share <br/>
information with my kids or use information to guide my own choices, I <br/>
try to keep that really clear in my mind and my words.<br/>
<br/>
Western medicine used to advocate bleeding as the best practice for many <br/>
problems; crazy thing is, it worked some of the time for things like <br/>
high blood pressure. Chemotherapy is currently Western medicine&#39;s best <br/>
answer to many cancers, and I have no trouble believing that folks in a <br/>
hundred or two hundred years will look back on that practice and think <br/>
quackery at best and barbarity at worst.<br/>
<br/>
Balance. Best information while realizing that most information is <br/>
fallible. Moderation. Options.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
 <br/>
Right.<br/>
 <br/>
And much &quot;truth&quot; about food turns out to have been false, so relying on any  <br/>
professional dietary advice is a danger.  Recommendations are changed  <br/>
frequently.  I think younger people don&#39;t realize that at first and so are  more <br/>
likely to become deeply invested in what they know about nutrition.   As they get <br/>
older and live through a couple of changes and &quot;oopses&quot; and &quot;we  now know <br/>
that...&quot;s, they can be calmer.   Some people manage to  find calm while they&#39;re <br/>
still young. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The first health food store I ever saw was in Albuquerque in 1970.  It  was a <br/>
big deal.  It had shelves and shelves of powdered additives and  pills.   The <br/>
first natural foods co-op I ever saw was in Albuquerque  in 1971 or 72.  It <br/>
was barrels and barrels (cardboard barrels, mostly) of  bulk grains and nuts, <br/>
stored in an iffy half-outside building, and I was there  in the spring when <br/>
the wind was blowing sand and dust around.  Hippies who  were living without <br/>
running water were leaning over those big barrels and  reaching their hands down <br/>
in there.  It was picturesque, but not a picture  of sanitation.   I was young <br/>
and was afraid of both manufacturing  places (where were those powdered <br/>
additives from, and what was IN there?) and of  random germs and dirt.<br/>
 <br/>
Yet I&#39;ve eaten all kinds of foods and lived past the age of 50.<br/>
 <br/>
When I was going to LLL, I was involved in a couple of mothering groups on  <br/>
the side (inspired by but not LLL).  It was interesting to see which moms  were <br/>
uber-controlling, and what their justifications were, and how their kids  <br/>
responded.  Even very young kids can be pretty sneaky and resistent in the  face <br/>
of unreasonable and constant &quot;no&quot; or &quot;you don&#39;t need that&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s not  how <br/>
we live.&quot;  It seemed sometimes that a mom would be way more concerned  with <br/>
how impressed the other kids were that her child was wearing all organic  <br/>
naturally-dyed cotton than that her child really needed to pee, or was getting  <br/>
mosquito bites and wanted to go home.  If they were mindful, it was too  often <br/>
mindful of their image in the presence of strangers, not mindful of  the <br/>
immediate needs of their children.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Not all research is created equal, and it&#39;s quite easy to go out and  <br/>
find research saying how bad soy is and how good soy is, how bad meat is  <br/>
and how good meat is. It&#39;s just not a definitive science.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Milk was (probably still is in some places) forced on kids when I was going  <br/>
to school.  &quot;Drink your milk&quot; wasn&#39;t really an option.  They tried to  force <br/>
us to eat canned spinach and stewed plums (which I could handle now if I  were <br/>
pressed to, but could NOT at the age of ten).  Now it&#39;s known that  LOTS of <br/>
people shouldn&#39;t have cow&#39;s milk. It&#39;s worse for them than having  nothing.  <br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;nutritious.&quot;  Still occasionally I  find reference in <br/>
advice to pregnant women that they MUST drink milk, so they  can make milk.  <br/>
That&#39;s just stupid.<br/>
 <br/>
The four food groups were replaced by the food pyramid.  That lasted  20 <br/>
years or less, and has been revamped, and the modern scientific news that  <br/>
resulted in a four-level pyramid rather than a 2x2 block to model the  correct <br/>
balance of food intake has been replaced by... what?  What shape is  &quot;right&quot; <br/>
nutrition now?<br/>
 <br/>
Cheese is great food for some people, and not for others.  <br/>
Cabbage is great for some people and turns others into crampy fart  stations.<br/>
Tomatoes are WONDERFUL for those who like them and digest them well.  <br/>
They&#39;re not crucially necessary for any creature (but maybe  hornworms).<br/>
 <br/>
Helping children learn early to be flexible and to really feel what their  <br/>
body might need (more juice or fruit?  Protein?  Bread or  noodles?  Something <br/>
hot and smoothe?  Crunchy and salty?) is a gift  far beyond teaching them rules <br/>
and categories and what is &quot;junk&quot;/poison and what  is perfect.  Perfection <br/>
isn&#39;t one-size-fits-all.<br/>

but it&#39;s not just about food, it&#39;s about abundance and awareness and  <br/>
respect) <br/>
Sandra<br/>
absolutely! (I trimmed this post far too much)<br/>
I agree that we need to be aware (key word).<br/>
I should have mentioned that my big thing is that the food be organic and <br/>
preservative free (and i know it&#39;s almost impossible to be 100% when out but we <br/>
try to be mindful even then).<br/>
Other than that, if my daughter wanted to eat 20 cookies in a row that were <br/>
organic (preferably made by me, health food store second choice) I wouldn&#39;t bat <br/>
an eye. I do this myself on occasion.<br/>
But since unschooling is about being mindful and respectful I think we have <br/>
to respect people, animals and the earth as well. We need to be aware of where <br/>
our food came from and how it was prepared. I would certainly not keep an <br/>
animal chained in my back yard, feed it diseased animal parts even though it is a <br/>
vegetarian, and force it to give me milk or eggs and then cruelly kill it.<br/>
I would encourage my child not to eat products that were produced in that way <br/>
until they could see for themself where it comes from. Mindful. Today we are <br/>
so removed from where our food comes from that we just see it packaged so <br/>
beautifully and think it&#39;s great. We don&#39;t see the years of suffering that took to <br/>
get that burger or the 1,000 rotten oranges they had to pasteurize to get <br/>
their juice, or the &quot;tomato flavor&quot; they had to add to your franken-tomato to <br/>
make it taste like one again!<br/>
Unschooling is about being creative too and what is more creative than making <br/>
your own pop tarts or going on a journey to find better ones? Like you said a <br/>
pop tart is nothing more than fruit filling with dough and icing. It can be <br/>
done.<br/>
It&#39;s not as though the child is saying I will ONLY eat KELLOGS brand pop <br/>
tarts. They just tried something and maybe they liked the fruit part, maybe the <br/>
middle, maybe the icing (i remember eating them when i was a kid and the dough <br/>
tasted yucky to me). Experimenting is fun.<br/>
I would never tell my daughter that she couldn&#39;t have something but I would <br/>
find better alternatives. I agree with the pp that said my daughter is still <br/>
young and that I will have new challenges to face when she comes home from a <br/>
friend&#39;s house and wants a hot dog.<br/>
Absolutely. I will get the least disgusting organic hot dog I can find.<br/>
I should add that I&#39;m not a vegetarian. I don&#39;t have all organic clothing. I <br/>
am not proud of that but I do eat organic and I think that makes a difference. <br/>
The animals are leading a more natural life and they are not full of <br/>
antibiotics/preservatives etc. I buy raw milk products and grass fed animals. I do try <br/>
to make sure my clothes didn&#39;t come from a kid in a sweatshop.<br/>
I try to think about the healthiest people and what they eat: lots of <br/>
veggies/fruits/fermented stuff/wine/fish etc. I think about what I am: a human. I <br/>
have a long digestive track, not a short one so I don&#39;t think I was designed to <br/>
eat much meat. I don&#39;t have sharp teeth for tearing flesh. I think we&#39;ve <br/>
adapted which is fine but I don&#39;t need steak every night. I eat mostly <br/>
fruits/veggies/fish/chicken some grains/legumes. I try to live this way.<br/>
I am far from perfect. <br/>
My husband is a chef and where he works they do not buy organic. If I eat <br/>
there I get the fish.<br/>
 Someone mentioned the &quot;more natural than thou&quot; attitude around mothering.com <br/>
and I have experienced this first hand!<br/>
Some of the people I&#39;ve met have this attitude and I can assure you that I do <br/>
not.<br/>
I just want the best for my family, my body and the world.......<br/>
Is that too much? lol<br/>
I thought for sure in the unschooling group (who are bucking an entire system <br/>
that is wrong) would back me up on this.<br/>

 <br/>
We probably know things you could use knowing about natural acceptance and  <br/>
trust of children as whole beings who can learn to make good decisions if they  <br/>
get the opportunity.<br/>
 <br/>
And if we stay on topic, it should always come back to learning and how  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is being mindful and respectful of our children. Going <br/>
beyond that is a different set of values and philosophies.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say we can&#39;t have many goals and many values. But when <br/>
they come in conflict, one needs to be the priority. And here with <br/>
unschooling that priority is our children. Respect means respecting our <br/>
children&#39;s choices even when they aren&#39;t the choices we&#39;d make.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I will get the least disgusting organic hot dog I can find.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if it doesn&#39;t satisfy like a real hot dog with all the filler and <br/>

&gt; antibiotics/preservatives etc. I buy raw milk products and grass fed <br/>
&gt; animals.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is admirable. And there are ways to live our values without <br/>
sending the message &quot;You can choose differently but you&#39;re wrong if you <br/>
do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And there are ways to live that make it difficult for others to come to <br/>
their own understanding.<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband became Born Again Christian and set up sort of a <br/>
wall of Christianity you had to navigate through before reaching the <br/>
rest of the world. If you wanted to listen to eminem because you were <br/>
curious what all the controversy was about, he&#39;d bend over backwards <br/>
trying to find all the Christian music that sounded like it for you to <br/>
try. If you wanted to read the next Harry Potter, he&#39;d find similar <br/>
Christian titles. If you got curious about Buddhism he&#39;d feel the need <br/>
to remind you of how the world really is (e.g., his values) which <br/>
obviously you weren&#39;t quite understanding because if you did understand <br/>
then Buddhism wouldn&#39;t look at all interesting to you.<br/>
<br/>
When kids are young and trusting that we know everything, we can delude <br/>
ourselves into believing that just telling them our truth is enough for <br/>
it to become their truth. But it can&#39;t be their truth if they don&#39;t <br/>
have the freedom to explore beyond it.<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn&#39;t sound like you that&#39;s okay. We shouldn&#39;t be talking <br/>
about you ;-) We should be talking about the *idea* of how to respect <br/>
our children&#39;s choices while living our own values. Like how does a <br/>
vegetarian stay true to her values while allowing her children to make <br/>
their own choices about whether or not to eat meat? If she&#39;s vegetarian <br/>
for moral reasons, she&#39;s going to want her children to know about <br/>
slaughterhouse conditions. But should she?<br/>

When people obsess about something, they internalize it and it starts to eat <br/>
them from the inside out way worse than coca cola in its most <br/>
virulent-urban-mythological form could ever do.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that goes around in Christian, pagan, Buddhist and humanist <br/>
circles all:<br/>
<br/>
One evening an old Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on <br/>
inside people. He said, &quot;My son, the battle is between two wolves.  One is Evil. <br/>
It is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, <br/>
resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, hate, superiority, and ego.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;The other is Good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, <br/>
kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, <br/>
&quot;Which wolf wins?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  The old Cherokee simply replied, &quot;The one you feed.&quot;</div>

I couldn&#39;t agree more. Again, this is not how I operate. Charity and love <br/>
begin at home. I don&#39;t save my best for the &quot;company&quot;......I give that to my <br/>
family every day. I&#39;m not out saving the world and not my family........they are <br/>
my very first priority, but I think it&#39;s wrong to live in a bubble. We have to <br/>
think about how our actions affect others but not neglect ourselves in the <br/>
process. <br/>
I grew up in a family like this. I fell by the wayside while my mom was <br/>
&quot;doing good&quot; for others. She was always nasty at home........much like living with <br/>
an alcoholic. <br/>
<br/>

I think unschoolers are keeping their children home for positive reasons. To <br/>
give their children the best and let them find their own happiness and desire <br/>
to learn. I think they are more concerned about family than having the state <br/>
babysit their child.<br/>
When I say &quot;bucking&quot; I am referring to the constant butting of heads with <br/>
others about their ideas. The system being school.<br/>
I&#39;m anticipating a struggle because I am not supported in my views by many <br/>
people around me. <br/>

Interestingly, there are conservatives who assume that all homeschoolers  are <br/>
conservative Christian pro-lifers who are homeschooling to protect their  <br/>
children from worldliness and evil influences like Harry Potter and video games  <br/>
and secular humanism.<br/>
 <br/>
Then there are born-again new-age liberals (many also converts) who assume  <br/>
that all unschoolers are bike-riding TV-shunning natural-fiber peaceniks whose  <br/>
dogs have decided to go vegetarian too.<br/>
 <br/>
Some are.  But that&#39;s another issue, and I question whether when they  say <br/>
&quot;we decided...&quot; that the dog REALLY had a full say in the issue.<br/>
 <br/>
The assumption that because my kids have Nintendo-logo t-shirts (and  Sinfest <br/>
and Strongbad and My Little Pony) that I am a victim and  purveyor of <br/>
corporate commercialist evil, and because they eat Hebrew  Nation hot dogs that I am <br/>
a cow murdering fiend who should be in prison  comes around from time to time, <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t bother me.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think of the little boy whose My Little Pony was removed overnight and  <br/>
replaced with a Waldorf-approved wooden horse, and I think<br/>
1) the mom made a WHOMPING huge mistake<br/>
2) she should read The Velveteen Rabbit and Pinnochio to herself over and  <br/>
over in shame<br/>
and<br/>
3) she wasn&#39;t an unschooler anyway<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943512738">Should knowing how the food we eat gets to our plates be something to<br/>
hide?  (Or rather--vegetarian or not--don&#39;t city chidlren, too,<br/>
deserve to hold that knowledge?  <br/>
<br/>
Farm children know (obviously from daily experience) that food (meat<br/>
or vegetable) doesn&#39;t come in tidy saran-wrapped styrofoam packages. <br/>
Why deny that knowedge to children in the suburbs or urban settings? <br/>
It&#39;s a basic need; it seems that we should all have a basic idea of<br/>
how that need is filled.  <br/>
<br/>
I think, especially for unschoolers, that it&#39;s most respectful to give<br/>
children the experience and knowledge so that they can make informed<br/>
decisions.  (I would say that same for basically any decision--take<br/>
abortion gag-rules, for example--how can a woman make an informed<br/>
decision without information?  A diabetic make informed nutritional<br/>
decisions?  Buying a car?  Choosing an instrument to play? <br/>
Educational path to follow?  Well--virtually any crossroad on the<br/>
journey of life).<br/>

Maybe, if they wanted to. <br/>

My grandparents killed a chicken every Sunday when I was a kid.  We  lived <br/>
right near them and went for Sunday dinner every Sunday.  I did see  the <br/>
feather-plucking (Papaw and a #4 washtub full of chicken feathers), but I  never once <br/>
saw the killing, though I could&#39;ve if I&#39;d wanted to.  I heard  how he did it, <br/>
but chose not to watch.  I&#39;ve never heard of any young child  being called <br/>
out to watch.  Describing to a young child the details of food  production for <br/>
the purpose of scaring him away from wanting that food seems  cruel to me.<br/>
 <br/>

I don&#39;t know of anyone forcing kids to watch gory stuff on TV.<br/>

 <br/>
If they&#39;re used to simple fact, an emotional presentation of scary  <br/>
exaggeration will seem wrong.  And if they never, ever come upon extreme  emotional <br/>
arguments, good for them!<br/>
 <br/>

aren&#39;t sure if they can handle, and then gauge their reactions?  <br/>

children were &quot;in on&quot; harsh realities of life, in the past, too. Just <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I know one father in our homeschool group last year did a series on &quot;Know Where Your Food Comes From&quot;. The parents and kids raised chickens from baby chicks, and eventually came the day when they killed them and had a chicken dinner - they went through the whole process. Many of the kids really enjoyed this.  That&#39;s one way to expose kids to the actual reality of it. I know my two would have been *so* upset about it and would not be able to do that. That is how I was as a child - so sensitive to this kind of thing that even thinking about it bothered me (my aunt had a sheepskin rug that she still referred to as &quot;Michael&quot; - the lamb she raised for 4H, and that always freaked me out). That&#39;s why I became a vegetarian as soon as I had control over my own food (and I grew up for some years on a farm and my grandma whacked the heads off of chickens and they ran around the yard headless, so it certainly wasn&#39;t lack of exposure that made me so sensitive!). Both of my kids eat very little meat, by choice, and their main reason is that it bothers them to think about killing it.<br/>
<br/>
For my kids, I think what I really try to do is avoid exaggerations and propaganda. When I was a vegetarian (which I no longer am), I explained my reasons for not eating meat in straightforward, yet not overly-gory ways. I made sure to explain that not all people are vegetarian, that I respect other peoples&#39; right to make different choices. I also made sure to tell them that I thought eating meat was a very natural thing (witness all the carnivores in nature) and that most indigenous peoples didn&#39;t really have a choice to be vegetarian or not - the labor-intensiveness of a vegetarian diet in a natural setting is not something humans are well set up for. Without the ruminous stomachs of creatures like cows, we&#39;re not able to extract enough nutrients from plant matter efficiently so that the sheer act of gathering food would use up as much or more calories as could be gathered (except in areas of extreme abundance, like coastal areas). Thus, vegetarianism is largely supported by a modern lifestyle with modern farming methods. Even in my 20 years as a vegetarian, I didn&#39;t really see slaughtering an animal by slitting it&#39;s throat as anything much worse than, say, a lion smothering it by biting it&#39;s nose, dragging it over to its side, and other lions starting to eat it while it was still smothering.<br/>
<br/>
Some friends of ours are ardent vegetarians, and instead of giving their kids information, they&#39;ve told them what to believe. Thus, whenever their kids see someone eating meat, they start spouting off about how inhumane and cruel it is and all that. A couple of times I&#39;ve offered to show them some National Geographic videos of lions killing wildebeest and described the process to them. They were a bit taken aback that this could be the way nature actually works. So, since their parents only gave them one way of looking at this, when faced with differing information it is confusing to them. They&#39;ve been told absolutes, in a world in which there really aren&#39;t many. If killing animals is inhumane, then God sure set things up funny, eh? I think it&#39;s much better to give kids as reasonable and realistic information as you can - &quot;Here&#39;s why I made the choices I did. Here&#39;s why other people might make different choices.&quot; - and then let them figure out what they believe from there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904025927">I just wanted  to comment on something, to clarify my original post and my position.<br/>
<br/>
About my post, when I talked my son out of getting a hamburger, I used no scare tactics.  I have never tried to scare him with scary or horrifying stories.  I have told him that animals that live on feedlots, large scale &quot;farms,&quot; are usually not humanely treated.  I have talked more about the treatment of the living animals than the slaughter of them.  In fact I don&#39;t think I have ever told him anything about the way they die, just that I think animals should be treated humanely while they are on this earth.   As far as animals in the wild and lions smothering wildebeest, lions don&#39;t have the luxury (or the ability) to think about what is humane.  We do.  I firmly believe that if we can do it better, we should.  <br/>
<br/>
My vegetarianism is due to antibiotic and hormone use as well as treatment of animals.  We have talked about antibiotics and hormones, he goes with me when I buy free-range eggs.  I do eat the others occasionally, ie when I can&#39;t afford the free-range, but I have told him that when I can I will choose free-range and antibiotic free eggs, and antibiotic and hormone free milk or soy milk.  He has seen me eat meat a few times in his life.  If someone cooks for us, I pretty much eat what they cook.  I am a single mom and money is tight, and if someone is generous enough to make us a meal, I eat what they cook.  I think that is common courtesy, as long as we are not talking about an allergy.  So, my original point to him was that if we have the choice (we are at a restaurant that does offer a veggieburger), we should choose the more organic/more humane alternative.   BUT, I recognize that this is my opinion, which I was forcing on him, hence my feeling badly about it.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If having ALL information was necessary, nobody would ever be able to <br/>
make a decision - we are always having to make choices in the face of <br/>
incomplete information. It isn&#39;t worth it to even attempt to gather ALL <br/>
information before making any decision.<br/>
<br/>
My kids, for example, certainly know that meat is an animal - they <br/>
aren&#39;t stupid, they don&#39;t think it starts out in the grocery store <br/>
packaged in plastic. I dare say it is a rare person who gets to be very <br/>
old before they realize that eating meat is eating an animal. That&#39;s <br/>
enough for most people to know to make a choice about eating meat <br/>
versus not. It isn&#39;t a FULLY informed choice, but a &quot;choice can be <br/>
truly made.&quot; And, over the years, my kids have investigated, to the <br/>
extent THEY were interested, the conditions under which the animals <br/>
were raised and slaughtered. One of them has been in 4H and experienced <br/>
raising of market animals - rabbits, sheep, pigs, calves, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My role isn&#39;t to coerce them into learning about something whether <br/>
they&#39;re interested or not - my job is to support their interests and <br/>
make sure their world is big and filled with possibilities. THEY get to <br/>
control what they learn - and this is a perfect example of something <br/>
that might be fascinating to one kid and disgusting and scary to <br/>
another.<br/>

<br/>
And someone just posted a religious thread where here kids were being <br/>

are parents who are afraid that their children might not choose to <br/>
believe as the parents do that think it&#39;s okay to use scare tactics to <br/>
get their kids to believe.<br/>
<br/>
So what does a parent do when their beliefs are based on knowledge that <br/>
their kids might find traumatizing? Do they take a child&#39;s choice of <br/>
eating meat as a signal that the child is obviously not well enough <br/>
informed about slaughterhouses otherwise they couldn&#39;t possibly choose <br/>
meat? Do they pass on more and more graphic information until the child <br/>
finally &quot;sees the light&quot; and gives up meat? Do they repeat often that <br/>
people who don&#39;t believe in God are going to hell?<br/>

&gt; industrial food production would likely have an impact on many<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the answer is to use your own judgment and knowledge of your <br/>
children on how to answer their questions and what information to give <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s the answer to all our kids interactions with the world. Some <br/>
kids will be traumatized by Bambi. Some kids will think Dawn of the <br/>
Dead is cool. It would be cruel to show Dawn of the Dead (or Bambi) to <br/>
the first child. It would be controlling to limit the second child to <br/>
Bambi.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have an example from your own life where you had problems <br/>
deciding what was too much and what was too little so we can have <br/>
something solid to discuss?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I don&#39;t think information (giving it, getting it, or having it) is <br/>
&gt; cruel.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Giving kids more information than they want won&#39;t help anyone unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Giving kids information that will traumatize them for the purposes of <br/>
making them believe as a parent does *is* cruel.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also don&#39;t think the choice can be truly made without that <br/>
&gt; information.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What information? What level of information is necessary? That beef <br/>
comes from cows? That terrorized cows are led to their deaths so you <br/>
can have a hamburger? &quot;Information&quot; is too vague. We need specifics -- <br/>
and a real situation -- to have a meaningful discussion.<br/>

I *think* this was discussed on this list a while back already (someone <br/>
LMK if I&#39;m thinking of the wrong unschooling list).  You might check <br/>
the archives for it if you&#39;re interested in finding it.<br/>
<br/>
I am vegetarian (basically vegan).  I would not eat meat simply because <br/>
it was served to me.  I&#39;m not being discourteous.  I&#39;m being me, being <br/>
true to myself, and not being ungrateful.  Of course, if I were going <br/>
to someone&#39;s home for a meal I would be sure that they knew that I am <br/>
vegetarian and that they don&#39;t have to go out of their way to prepare <br/>
anything special for me.  I&#39;m more than happy to prepare a dish and <br/>
bring it to share -- and I&#39;m OK if they don&#39;t want to eat any of it.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t think that was rude AT ALL.  Who am I to say what someone else <br/>
should eat?  Who are they to assume that I&#39;ll eat whatever they put in <br/>
front of me?  Eat what you want;  leave the rest.  Thank your host <br/>
genuinely and everything will be cool.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Just my experience,<br/>
