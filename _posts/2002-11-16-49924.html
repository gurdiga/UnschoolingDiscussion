&gt; I&#39;m totally willing to withdraw the music idea.  It was put out as a goof, to<br/>
&gt; see what responses came.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I don&#39;t believe that anyone can get unschooling to a degree.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that anyone *could* get unschooling.  But they would have to be<br/>
willing to &quot;get it&quot;.  Ability vs. motivation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like unschooling is a difficult concept.  But some people have more<br/>
baggage in the way than others, and many of them *like* their baggage there!<br/>

<br/>
These two posts were fantastic.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I find letting go of control and dropping the schooling mindset to be a daily <br/>
challenge.  Or maybe more like a daily affirmation.  Having been schooled, <br/>
learning to live another way with your children, for the betterment of all of <br/>
your lives, is a long process.  The challenge isn&#39;t necessarily difficult all <br/>
the time or overwhelming, I find it refreshing.  But, without embracing it <br/>
completely you can&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
In my current disabled state, I&#39;ve had to surrender myself to my <br/>
helplessness.  Everyone does for me, I do for no one.  I&#39;m not comfortable <br/>
with it.  It grates on my nerves, makes me cry, makes me angry, makes me <br/>
happy to be loved and grateful for the assistance.  It&#39;s not easy, but I&#39;ve <br/>
learned a lot about myself and my world.  I think unschooling can be that way <br/>
too.  A calming surrender.  But then, maybe not.  Maybe when you get years <br/>
into unschooling, it become more like breathing.<br/>
<br/>
Being on this list and reading the message boards helps.  Daily affirmations <br/>
that your instincts are correct.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m fretting about unschooling, I also fret about this.  How do I<br/>
know if I&#39;m doing &quot;enough&quot; of it.  Am I strewing the right things,<br/>
saying the right things, *thinking* the right things.  We hardly go<br/>
anywhere, so I&#39;m pretty certain I&#39;m not going the right places and<br/>
cramming in experiences fast enough.<br/>
<br/>
How do I know?  I know the signs if my son is bored and understimulated.<br/>
 I know that that&#39;s a clue I need to shake things up with a favorite<br/>
outing or more play dates or something.  (Ds is 8.)<br/>
<br/>
My anxiety and worry is irregular.  If the FDA would just specify a nice<br/>
daily or monthly allowance of worrying, then I might be able to set up a<br/>
nice, regular worrying schedule and be certain that I was worrying<br/>
enough to do a thorough job of child-raising.<br/>
<br/>
I see the humor in this, but I&#39;m not really kidding.  I&#39;m more on the<br/>
laissez-faire, lazy end of the unschooling spectrum than lots of people<br/>
on this list.  I wonder if I really *need* to throw myself into this<br/>
more energetically.  (And, yes, I have been asking this question for<br/>
years.  I don&#39;t know if it is answerable.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-334406098">Here&#39;s my Jesse Jackson story..<br/>
<br/>
at the time of his presidential campaign I was still teaching high <br/>
school. A girl in my class wanted to know what was the big deal about <br/>
Jesse Jackson running for President, after all, we&#39;ve already had a <br/>
black president.<br/>
<br/>
huh? I thought. Not only was this kid absolutely adamant, but a few <br/>
other kids were nodding in agreement with her.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I said, I give up. Who was our first black president.<br/>
<br/>
Martin Luther King she said, and the other kids nodded.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t a president, I informed them.<br/>
<br/>
Than why do we get off school for Martin Luther King day? they wanted to <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While I did like that a group of middle class white kids thought having <br/>
a black president was no big deal, I was blown away by their lack of <br/>
knowledge re history and politics.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
susan<br/>
<br/>
ps my current students are well aware of who Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <br/>
was and why there&#39;s a holiday in his honor, which we honor here as a <br/>
civil rights day (day on, not a day off, as the King Center says). One <br/>
year the kids wrote and performed a puppet show about Rosa Parks, which <br/>
they researched themselves; oh, and they made the puppets too. My only <br/>
job was to be the audience. (and this is how unschooling works so <br/>
well. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What do you mean by &#39;having trouble doing more than&#39;?<br/>
If my child chooses to play PS all day its unschooling. If she <br/>
chooses to read all day its unschooling.<br/>
It&#39;s about choice.<br/>
I think many people are afraid there child will do things that they, <br/>
the parent, consider unproductive. This calls for a rethinking. If the <br/>
child chooses to do something then that something has value and <br/>
meaning to the child. The child isn&#39;t there to make the parent feel <br/>
better or proud or whatever.<br/>
Unschooling is allowing the child to make decisions about their <br/>
own life and the parents facilitating that if they can.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also still school type thinking to place somethings as more <br/>
worthwhile than others. If someone said the above sentence but <br/>
subsitute maths for playstation then people would say &#39;whats the <br/>
problem, you should be pleased&#39; but somehow the PlayStation is <br/>
seen as something unworthwhile to spend time doing.<br/>
To be mundane for a second. The people who write them games <br/>
enjoy their jobs and make buckets of cash. They bring pleasure to <br/>
lots of people. It&#39;s lucky their parents didn&#39;t scoff at their interest in <br/>
games.<br/>

If playstation is the only exciting thing in their lives, they&#39;re smart to do <br/>
what&#39;s exciting.<br/>
<br/>
How old is the kid?<br/>
How do you define &quot;trouble doing&quot;?<br/>
How long have you had the playstation?<br/>

enjoy their jobs and make buckets of cash. They bring pleasure to<br/>
lots of people. It&#39;s lucky their parents didn&#39;t scoff at their interest in<br/>
games.<br/>

My guess is that their parents *did* scoff at their interest, and they did<br/>
it anyway.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Elizabeth, may I ask you what is your disability?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shellie, my only disability is an all-encompassing stupidity!  I broke my <br/>
ankle while carrying too many glass items down the basement stairs on my way <br/>
to do laundry.  It&#39;s a very temporary and very annoying disability, which has <br/>
made me exceptionally cranky.<br/>
<br/>
My massage therapist practices ortho-bionomy.  I was referred to her by a <br/>
friend with fibromyalsia.  So, ortho-bionomy might help.  I used to take yoga <br/>
with the same friend.  Not doing much of that these days, but she says it <br/>
continues to help.  Having a broken limb is very un-yoga-like.  There is no <br/>
way to be centered or balances except on one leg.  Yoga&#39;s kind of like <br/>
algebra, you&#39;re supposed to keep both sides of the equation (body) equal.<br/>
<br/>
As for affirmations, I&#39;m staring at the stairs leading to the bedrooms and <br/>
office (with the dsl line) several times a day and saying &quot;I think I can, I <br/>
think I can, I think I can.&quot;  Every day gets better.  Today I put on my kids <br/>
coats and sent them outside to help their grumpy father rake leaves.  That <br/>
was an accomplishment...<br/>

Today was going to be the day.  I was going to go upstairs.  I decided that <br/>
yesterday, and was psyching myself up for the big climb (and the scarier <br/>
prospect of coming back down face forward).<br/>
<br/>
Last night Keith fell down the stairs.  The top half.  I heard it but didn&#39;t <br/>
see.  I asked him, and he admitted falling, but said it wasn&#39;t bad.  he would <br/>
give me NO details.  It was loud and scary.<br/>
<br/>
Today Holly fell coming down stairs where she goes to an acting class. Just <br/>
landed in a crouch and cut her knee.  Not bad, she said.<br/>
<br/>
But if Keith and Holly who have huge physical competence are falling on <br/>
stairs this weekend, I&#39;m staying here.<br/>

carpeted, and it&#39;s a narrow homey staircase, not a grand Tara staircase?  <br/>
<br/>
Can you remember the last time you saw a toddler go down the stairs on their <br/>
butt, and do it that way?  That&#39;s what I&#39;d try.  Then have someone at the top <br/>
to help you stand up again.<br/>

Different stairs. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did tell Keith it might help to vacuum them so they weren&#39;t slick with cat <br/>
hair.<br/>
<br/>
He vacuumed the heck out of that and several rooms around.  Learned where I <br/>
keep the vacuum cleaner bags.  Learned how to change the belt and where those <br/>
are bought, and to get an extra, and where to put it.<br/>

I did that years ago (okay, August) when I sprained my foot.  Did it to get <br/>
downstairs once, anyway.   I&#39;ll consider it even more now that Keith&#39;s <br/>
vacuumed! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just frustrated that once I get up there I won&#39;t be able to carry or do <br/>
anything.  But I should go and visit Holly&#39;s room, which she just moved into <br/>
before the SC conference, and which she&#39;s fixed up and hung posters in, etc., <br/>
 and wants me to see it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a bathtub up there too.<br/>

She&#39;s up where my office is.  Her TV/VCR is just to the left of the window, <br/>
and the head of her bed is toward the hallway (where I had shelves and filing <br/>
cabinets).  Where my computer table was, there&#39;s her walkway, clear under the <br/>
window, and there are My Little Ponies along the windowsill.<br/>
<br/>
The filing cabinets are out where her bed used to be in the enclosed porch.</div>
