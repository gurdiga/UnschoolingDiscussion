 </span></blockquote>I used to work at a Good Earth restaurant (when I was a mere 18 <br/>
years old &lt;g&gt;).  I never got tired of eating the food.  I don&#39;t <br/>
understand why so many of them are closing.  You would think <br/>
that the healthy eaters and vegetarians would keep them going.  <br/>
What a shame, sigh.<br/>
