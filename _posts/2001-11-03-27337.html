<br/>
WILL THEY EVER LEARN TO READ?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/186.html">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/186.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your daughter will learn to read if you do one simple thing every <br/>
day: read to her. Read books she enjoys, even if they have the word <br/>
&quot;underpants&quot; in the title. Share books you liked when you were her <br/>
age. Read silly books and classics, picture books and those with <br/>
chapters. Use different voices as you read. Have fun acting the <br/>
stories out sometimes. Relate other areas of your life to the book <br/>
you&#39;re reading when you&#39;re not reading it. Take a book or some other <br/>
reading material with you whenever you might have to wait -- at the <br/>
dentist&#39;s office or when you go to renew your driver&#39;s license. Make <br/>
reading a fun and constant part of her life.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to be the only one to read with her. Subscribe to <br/>
Boomerang audio magazine (boomkids.com), and check out books on tape <br/>
at the library so you can both listen to books in the car or while <br/>
you&#39;re working on projects. Encourage your husband or her siblings to <br/>
read with her. Read a special book with the whole family and then <br/>
watch the movie. Make reading a family affair.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t just read books. Buy her a magazine subscription. Kids love <br/>
magazines! A couple of our favorites are American Girl <br/>
(americangirl.com) and Hopscotch for Girls (hopscotchmagazine.com), a <br/>
topical magazine full of fiction and non-fiction stories that appeal <br/>
to girls. There are lots of magazines for kids that cover almost any <br/>
topic she might enjoy. Check your local library for a current list.<br/>
<br/>
You may be thinking how in the world will your daughter learn to read <br/>
if you&#39;re the one doing all the reading? I promise you this: If your <br/>
daughter lives in a house where other people read frequently to her <br/>
and to themselves, and reading materials such as books and magazines <br/>
are available to her, she will learn to read and enjoy it. People who <br/>
don&#39;t learn to read either didn&#39;t grow up in an environment where <br/>
reading is important, or they have a disability that prevents them <br/>
from reading. Your daughter suffers neither. She will not discover on <br/>
her eighteenth birthday that she&#39;s unable to read her birthday cards.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
CALL FOR LEARNING IDEAS<br/>
<br/>
Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
After three long years I have convinced a publisher that the <br/>
homeschooling community has the ability and desire to create the <br/>
ultimate &quot;learning ideas&quot; book, a much needed alternative or <br/>
supplement to traditional learning methods.<br/>
<br/>
The goal? To gather in one place the neatest, coolest, cheapest, <br/>
weirdest, quickest, funniest, most exotic, exciting, and fun learning <br/>
activities we homeschooling families have joyfully stumbled upon <br/>
outside of or alongside text book studies. We&#39;ll be focusing on ideas <br/>
for use with (about) 3- to 12-year-olds.<br/>
<br/>
Your participation, as always, is warmly invited. Simply send an <br/>
email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ldobson@...">ldobson@...</a> with &quot;Idea Book&quot; as the subject. In the <br/>
body include your name, address and phone number. In return you&#39;ll <br/>
receive all of the information you need to submit your greatest <br/>
ideas, and my everlasting gratitude. Additionally, there&#39;s a copy of <br/>
the book for those contributors who submit five or more published <br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, though, we&#39;ll help put the joy and fun of learning <br/>
into even more children&#39;s lives, and that will be a gift to them that <br/>
keeps on giving.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you!<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Linda Dobson<br/>

Good afternoon- I would like to notify home schooled students about a <br/>
scholarship competition that Oglethorpe University in Atlanta <br/>
sponsors each year. For the past three years a home schooled student <br/>
has won at least one of our five full-tuition, room and board James <br/>
Edward Oglethorpe Scholarships for all four years of study (worth <br/>
about $100,000) and I would like to encourage more participation from <br/>
the home school community. Thanks!<br/>

Certificate Of Empowerment<br/>
by Sandra Dodd<br/>
(This is intended for those who want to be &quot;certified.&quot; Feel free to <br/>
print this out for yourself or a friend.)<br/>
<br/>
As bearer of this certificate you are no longer required to depend on <br/>
the advice of experts. You may step back and view the entire <br/>
world-not just your home, neighborhood or town, but the whole <br/>
Earth-as a learning experience, a laboratory containing languages <br/>
(and native speakers thereof), plants, animals, history, geology, <br/>
weather (real live weather, in the sky, not in a book), music, art, <br/>
mathematics, physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, and ideas <br/>
without end. Although collections of these treasures have been <br/>
located in museums for your convenience, they are to be found <br/>
everywhere else, too.<br/>
This authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy your kids; to <br/>
rejoice when your children surpass you in skill, knowledge or wisdom; <br/>
to make mistakes, and to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may <br/>
allow your children to experience boredom without taking full <br/>
responsibility for finding them something to do.<br/>
<br/>
Henceforth you shall neither be required nor expected to finish <br/>
everything you start. Projects, books, experiments and plans may be <br/>
discontinued as soon as something more interesting comes along (or <br/>
for any other reason) without penalty, and picked up again at any <br/>
time in the future (or never).<br/>
<br/>
You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what <br/>
steps you feel necessary to protect your children from physical, <br/>
emotional or social harm.<br/>
<br/>
You have leave to think your own thoughts, and to encourage your <br/>
children to think theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Each person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend <br/>
these privileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this <br/>
certificate or by creating another of his/her own design. Those who <br/>
don&#39;t feel the need to obtain approval to experiment, to think, or to <br/>
do things they&#39;ve never seen others do are exempt, as they didn&#39;t <br/>
need permission in the first place.<br/>
<br/>

essays, an email list and more just for unschoolers. Check it out!<br/>

HOMESCHOOL SOCIAL REGISTER<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolmedia.com/register/index.phtml">http://www.homeschoolmedia.com/register/index.phtml</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the homeschooling pioneers of the 1980&#39;s and early 1990&#39;s, <br/>
homeschooling is legal everywhere in the U.S. and legal difficulties <br/>
are infrequent. It is very important to realize, however, that all <br/>
homeschooling is local. One reason for this is that in most states <br/>
school superintendents have a great deal of latitude in the <br/>
interpretation and application of state law and court rulings to <br/>
homeschooling in their districts. But a far more important reason is <br/>
that the emotional support we all need to &quot;go against the crowd&quot; and <br/>
keep our children out of school is something that requires direct <br/>
human contact.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, these days there&#39;s an abundance of excellent books and web <br/>
sites devoted to homeschooling. But the kind of support I&#39;m talking <br/>
about can&#39;t be found in a book or downloaded from a web site!<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s why the Homeschool Social Register was created. It <br/>
includes almost every town and city in the United States and Canada <br/>
(missing towns are easily added). Anyone who is homeschooling or <br/>
thinking about it can list themselves on the page for their hometown <br/>
or city. And, the Register provides a method of contacting any other <br/>
listed person without revealing anyone&#39;s email address or other <br/>
personal information. Since the Register is organized by towns and <br/>
cities within each state, it&#39;s a simple matter to locate others who <br/>
are homeschooling in your town or nearby. ~~ Dave Hirschman ~~<br/>

<br/>
ABSURD MATH<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hrmvideo.com/abmath">http://www.hrmvideo.com/abmath</a><br/>
<br/>
Whew! You&#39;re lucky I got this newsletter done in time! I took a <br/>
minute to check out this Absurd Math (pre-algebra from another <br/>
dimension) website and before I knew it a rather significant amount <br/>
of time had passed. These interactive math games are insidiously <br/>
silly and fun to play, and they&#39;re not all that easy. A precious <br/>
10-year-old could play them alone without frustration, as could most <br/>
teens and adults. Younger kids might enjoy doing them with someone <br/>
older.<br/>
<br/>
Once you&#39;ve met the pre-algebra challenges, you can go on to an <br/>
algebra and geometry game that&#39;s obviously more difficult. Better <br/>
take some snacks to your computer. You may be there a while.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
ONE-TO-ONE<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nezertbooks.com">http://www.nezertbooks.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Those of you who live in the UK, those who like to take a look at <br/>
homeschooling from an international point of view or those who would <br/>
like to see what a Waldorf education might look like in a homeschool <br/>
setting will want to read &quot;One-to-One: A Practical Guide to Learning <br/>
at Home Age 0-11.&quot; The book is a family affair, written by Martin and <br/>
Sophie Williams and illustrated by their children Sarah, Emma and <br/>
Chris.  The kids even provided the cartoons.<br/>
<br/>
Part indictment of the public school system, part instruction manual <br/>
and part curriculum guide, the book is an eclectic mix of <br/>
information, suggestions and practical instruction. Along with an <br/>
overview of the shortcomings of education, the book offers <br/>
information on how to teach art, math(s), gardening, cooking, crafts <br/>
and more, as well as suggestions for how to make the best of a public <br/>
school situation. For instance, the math chapter shows how to teach <br/>
basic operations including addition, subtraction multiplication, <br/>
division, fractions, time and more; offers a list of games that use <br/>
math (including instructions for many such as Whist, Racing Demon and <br/>
Battleships); and gives an overview of the best way to teach math to <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of information in this book and I liked its diverse <br/>
approach. Beginning homeschoolers would find a firm base for relaxed <br/>
homeschooling here. The author&#39;s condemnation of the school system <br/>
may seem harsh to some, but he gives concrete advice on helping <br/>
children negotiate the school system if the child must go to school <br/>
as well. If the book sounds like a tossed salad of ideas, opinions, <br/>
information and how-to&#39;s, that&#39;s exactly what it is. I enjoyed <br/>
reading it and I think many of you would too. ~ CN ~<br/>
