<div id="ygrps-yiv-920787678">Okay, I had my first encounter with a questioning parent about our homeschooling.  I mean, really questioning.  I think I came off as a little defensive, even though I don&#39;t feel that way.  I am very secure in our decision to unschool but it was very hard to explain the concept (she said she had never heard of it) and not take her questions personally.  Ugghhh!! <br/>
<br/>
My daughter just started a cheerleading program at a local Baptist church....Upwards is the name of the program.  It is actually quite nice for a nonchurchy person.  My daughter has announced many times that she is a Christian and she can&#39;t really understand why my husband and I are not but that&#39;s another story........<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we joined late and my daughter(just turned 7) got to be on the same team with another friend who is in the 3rd grade.  They placed her with the 3rd and 4th graders instead of the 1st/2nd grade group.  I am fine with it.....Mady is fine with it......but the mothers keep asking me, &quot;Is she a 4th grader???&quot;  and it leads to the homeschooling discussions when I tell them she is 7 and not in a &#39;grade&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
One mother asked the usual question, &quot;so,............what curriculum do you use?&quot;<br/>
Me:  &quot;We don&#39;t use curriculum.&quot;<br/>
Her:  &quot;Oh,......(long pause) we used Abeka for the girls until they were old enough to start school and it really gave them a good start.&quot;<br/>
Me:  &quot;That&#39;s nice&quot;<br/>
End of conversation.  Whew.   Survived the unending questions from her.  Then comes in mother #2.<br/>
<br/>
Mother #2 is a special education teacher with 3 or 4 adopted children with various disabilities.  Her main question ( I initially took it as concern for what I am doing with my children) was how do they learn the BASICS??  Well, I gave her the &quot;from everyday life&quot; answer and she wanted more.  But HOW??   I said that I was secure and confident that my children would learn what they need when they need it.   <br/>
<br/>
Then I realized that maybe she really does want to understand the what, how, and why of what we are doing to incorporate that into her home life and/or her teaching methods.  Then I gave her the name of a couple of books that she could read to learn more.  She seemed receptive but she wanted more.  By now, I am starting to sweat.  She was interrogating me it seemed.  I was completely unprepared for this.  I started citing examples from our home, how Alex is &#39;doing math&#39; calculating allowance and figuring out the baseball card stuff, how he has asked for algebra books (though he hasn&#39;t really looked at them yet), how he learned to read by watching the TV Guide channel (looking for his favorite programs), etc......  <br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t seem satisfied yet.   She still kept asking, &quot;but how do they get the foundation for later things if you don&#39;t TEACH them?&quot;   Her husband is a college professor who has a couple of homeschooled kids in his classes.  He said that it seemed the homeschooled ones don&#39;t seem to do well in the classroom situation.  They are having trouble getting used to the &#39;system&#39;.  I asked her if they wanted to BE there?  She didn&#39;t know.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, I told her about my husband who quit high school at 17, never went to college, started as a janitor, and is now an engineer.  She said, &quot;well, he won&#39;t be able to get a job at another plant without his degree, will he?&quot;  I told her that &quot;actually, yes.  He&#39;s had many offers over the years from others who know him and have moved to other companies, from the sales guys he knows, etc.  We have had job opportunities in Mexico, Germany (we really wanted to go but it didn&#39;t work out), Texas, and South Carolina in the last 5 years.&quot;  I was a little snippy about that comment from her but I am so proud of what my husband has accomplished without college or a degree.  It proves (to me) that you CAN do whatever you want if you put forth the effort and you have a genuine desire to succeed.  <br/>
<br/>
I finally ended the conversation by telling her that I feel confident that my children will learn what they need, when they need it.  That it is a factor of desire to know that drives their education and I believe they can do anything they want to as/when they grow.   <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, she asked if we had a church.  I just couldn&#39;t tell her that I am not a christian.  I was already exhausted from our first subject.  She invited me to come &quot;they have wonderful children&#39;s programs&quot; but all I could do was smile and nod and thank her.  <br/>
<br/>
So, now I have survived my first interrogation by a teacher.  As I said earlier, I think I was a lot more defensive than I should have been but she just kept asking questions!  We were waiting for our children to finish cheer practice so there was no escape.  <br/>
<br/>
How I wished I had someone to call last night to vent this out of my system but I don&#39;t know any unschoolers personally.   Thanks for letting me vent here.<br/>

It sounds like you did great.  I try to answer in very short sentences.  Not <br/>
much for them to think about.  I sometimes get that in the homeschooling <br/>
group here.  But now they just think I am the weird one.  They don&#39;t quite <br/>
know what we &quot;do&quot;.  LOL  You could have said you would love to have a <br/>
discussion with her at another time but now you are here to support your <br/>
daughter.<br/>

<br/>
I give you credit for even broaching the subject with relatives!  I have<br/>
only told one sister, who had homeschooled her children for a while, and as<br/>
I would have put it then, did &quot;nothing!&quot;  For some reason she feels that I<br/>
might understand her better now, lol.  Of course, I still feel like she<br/>
should have made more opportunities for her children, had more books around,<br/>
returned books to the library so they could go back, etc.  But, you know, in<br/>
spite of all that, her children are probably the best educated in the family<br/>
so far!<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t mentioned it to my parents.  They still don&#39;t agree with the<br/>
homeschooling, so unschooling is going to be way beyond their comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
When we were home for Christmas, my dad kept bringing up things he knew that<br/>
he thought my children should know by now, but didn&#39;t.  His big one was<br/>
something about how you can make a perfect star by drawing a circle and<br/>
knowing the formula of how to divide it using a compass.  I &quot;casually&quot;<br/>
mentioned how I had never done that (and I was the &quot;best&quot; in the family and<br/>
the first one in the family that graduated from college and took things like<br/>
calculus, of course I don&#39;t remember any of it, but that is a different<br/>
story.).  He kept saying HE learned how to do that in the fifth grade or<br/>
something.  But of course, he couldn&#39;t remember how to do it, so went and<br/>
looked it up on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
When he came back out with the directions, he sat and worked at it for a<br/>
while and then said he was too tired, he would have to work on it in the<br/>
morning.  My daughter asked if she could use his compass and stuff.  He said<br/>
it was okay.  She sat and played with the compass and other drafting<br/>
equipment for an hour or so.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if she figured out how to draw the star, but she learned a lot<br/>
just doing stuff with the tools on her own.  My dad of course, had gone to<br/>
bed, so he missed the light of discovery in her eyes as she compared radius<br/>
and diameter, etc.  I didn&#39;t bring up the subject the next day, and my dad<br/>
didn&#39;t either, lol.<br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, back to the subject.  I am not planning on telling anyone about<br/>
this anytime soon.  I plan on being very vague with everyone.  In the case<br/>
that someone is actually interested, I have a lot to share, but other than<br/>
that mum is the word!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402704362">Come up with some questions to ask her, so that SHE is having to think, and <br/>
not just waiting for you to think.<br/>
<br/>
Ask her about things she learned outside the classroom.  Cooking?  Sewing?  <br/>
Skiing, horsebackriding, what?   Hobbies?  <br/>
<br/>
You can just tell her things like &quot;It&#39;s really hard to describe how it works, <br/>
but it DOES work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You could write down &quot;www.unschooling.com&quot; and tell her she could read for <br/>

tell her it&#39;s based on the Open Classroom research done in the 1960&#39;s and <br/>
70&#39;s, but while schools couldn&#39;t get it to work with compulsory attendance, <br/>
families find it works BEAUTIFULLY if their children are home by choice.<br/>

<br/>
It gets better and easier. Using real-life examples like baseball cards and<br/>
calculating allowance is perfect, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
You can also just laugh and say, &quot;Hey, I feel like I&#39;m on the witness stand!<br/>
Let me write down the names of those books, and if you still have questions<br/>
after you read them I&#39;d be happy to talk to you more. So how long have your<br/>
kids been cheering?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no legal obligation that you have to talk to people who make you<br/>
uncomfortable, even about unschooling. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I, thankfully, have not had one problem with any family members on either side.  I feel quite fortunate in that.  My dad does ask occasionally if we are &#39;doing math&#39; but he is usually satisfied with a couple of examples of what has gone on at the house lately and ends it at that.   They see the results of taking Alex out of school and what it has done for his self esteem.  So does my mother-in-law.  (She got us a yearly membership to the local children&#39;s museum for Christmas!  Just what we wanted!)<br/>
<br/>
I will have to see this mother weekly until March so I am sure she will ask more questions.  I just hope she has done her &#39;research&#39; on unschooling before we chat again.  I have read so many good comments from this list on how to reply to questioners but it is so different to be IN the spotlight and have to actually reply intelligently.  Thanks for all of the great advice and support here everyone.  I&#39;ll read up a little more and bring her a list of resources to check out for herself if she has more questions next time.........<br/>

Thanks again,<br/>

I ve tried that approach, and it has worked with casual acquaintances and <br/>
small talk.  But my family is very close.. in proximity and also relationship <br/>
wise.  My folks ask me and my kids  outright.. &quot;What time do you have &quot;class&quot; <br/>
 &quot;what are you studying&quot; &quot;what did you do/learn today&quot;???  And of course, <br/>
when they dont get the acceptable answers, the interrogation begins.   I have <br/>
two sisters.. one is totally on &quot;their&quot; side.. against home(un) schooling.. <br/>
My other sister is much more open and understanding.. because her kids attend <br/>
a Magnet Montessori school that operates very much on an unschooling premise. <br/>
  My mother was paying my tuition for me to go to college.. she said she <br/>
couldnt pay it anymore because &quot; if your kids dont need to go to school, then <br/>
you dont need to go either&quot;  I only have one semester left to graduate.   <br/>
We&#39;ve went round and round over this.. I have started to just avoid them all <br/>
together, and thats what hurts.. <br/>

conversations some times feeling like I was defensive, even though I didn&#39;t<br/>
want to be.  But when someone keeps asking you to defend what you do, then<br/>
it&#39;s hard to not be defensive!<br/>
<br/>
If it helps, I&#39;ve lately been telling people we use a variety of learning<br/>
materials when they ask about curriculum.  If they press on, I&#39;ll says<br/>
something equally non-commital about diverse materials and start<br/>
chatt(ering) about a trip to the zoo or something and how wonderful it is to<br/>
have those kind of resource, too, etc.<br/>

answers.....  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if I told this story on this list before,so I apologize if<br/>
it is redundant:<br/>
<br/>
My husband has a friend that is a science teacher for a city high school.<br/>
He claims his job description is to teach the birds and the bees to the<br/>
animals and vegetables.(Not a whole lot of respect there). Well, we knew<br/>
this man for close to twenty years, but we never shared our ideas about<br/>
public schools with him.<br/>
When my daughter was about 4, the subject of education came up.<br/>
G- what school district are you in? <br/>
Me- not sure. Jenni isn&#39;t going to public school.(thinking Oh no..Here it<br/>
comes)<br/>
G- Oh? Which private school are you sending her to?<br/>
Me- Well, we aren&#39;t sending her to private school either...<br/>
G- (pause) You aren&#39;t one of *those* homeschooling people are you?<br/>
Me- Well, yes.<br/>
G- (in very elitist tone) You can&#39;t really think that you can educate<br/>
your children as effectively as someone who has trained and studied for<br/>
years to teach.<br/>
Me- Well, yes I do. And ultimately it is my responsibility.<br/>
G- What about [the dreaded &quot;S&quot; word] SOCIALIZATION?<br/>
<br/>
I can see this going nowhere. I&#39;ve known this man for many years, and<br/>
while his heart is in the right place, he is what I refer to as an<br/>
&quot;Educated Idiot&quot;. He can&#39;t see past the text book in front of his nose or<br/>
the NEA dogma that he has been spoon fed for the past thirty years.<br/>
<br/>
Me- I&#39;ll tell you what. Spend the day with Jenni and then come back and<br/>
talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
So... Mr. K and Jenni spent the day together. She showed him the chickens<br/>
she was raising, the flowers and vegetables that she grew from seed,<br/>
showed him how to paint on the computer, how to make different colors on<br/>
her real pallet, chatted, played, explored. She did all the things that<br/>
she will do on any given day. I never let on to her that she was being<br/>
&quot;tested&quot; so she was just herself. <br/>
They came back after a little while.<br/>
<br/>
G- That is amazing.<br/>
Me- What is amazing?<br/>
G- She knew her way around the computer better than I do, can hold up a<br/>
conversation as well as any 10th grade student, and even told me that she<br/>
bumped her gluteus maximus when she fell when chasing the chickens. And<br/>
she smiled all day.<br/>
Me- Now you know why I homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
Our teacher friend has never again questioned our homeschooling<br/>
intentions, and often brings over surplus text books and workbooks for<br/>
her. (I have not gotten into the idea of unschooling with him)<br/>
I think people really need to see it to believe it.<br/>

Fun, fun.<br/>
 <br/>
I am slowly getting less and less defensive,  for me at first when I hadn&#39;t read enough or researched enough I would really feel it.    Its getting better tho&#39;.<br/>
 <br/>
One conversation that keeps getting brought up to me by my bil, a teacher,  is that he really dislikes the unschooling term.   He then thinks that I believe that school is a terrible rotten place for all people.  I have never said such thing.   He brings up the fact that he has worked in inner city schools where the schools have really helped some kids.   I try and agree with him on that and discuss things on more of a natural learning basis.   But it is still really difficult sometimes.      I feel like  he likes what he sees in our children but that he would be betraying the school system if he did it with his children??       Maybe I&#39;m selfish,  not worrying about all the other kids that might benefit from exposure to my children,    but as a parent I feel its my job to do what&#39;s best for my kids.<br/>

VERY familar to whats went on between me and my family ( parents, in laws, <br/>
sisters, etc)  And having to defend myself and my decisions to my family is <br/>
espeically difficult in an emotional way.   Ive cried myself to sleep many <br/>
nights since I decided to take this path.  I feel isolated and abandoned by <br/>

My dad does ask occasionally if we are &#39;doing math&#39; but he is usually satisfied with a couple of examples of what has gone on at the house lately and ends it at that.   They see the results of taking Alex out of school and what it has done for his self esteem.  So does my mother-in-law.  (She got us a yearly membership to the local children&#39;s museum for Christmas!  Just what we wanted!)<br/>
<br/>
I will have to see this mother weekly until March so I am sure she will ask more questions.  I just hope she has done her &#39;research&#39; on unschooling before we chat again.  I have read so many good comments from this list on how to reply to questioners but it is so different to be IN the spotlight and have to actually reply intelligently.  Thanks for all of the great advice and support here everyone.  I&#39;ll read up a little more and bring her a list of resources to check out for herself if she has more questions next time.........<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

<br/>
I just had a conversation yesterday with a friend who questions me <br/>
periodically about homeschooling.  When I told him that I&#39;m an unschooler <br/>
now, he got concerned and questioned me more.  He was worried that I was just <br/>
leaving my children to discover the world on their own without any input from <br/>
me.  We talked awhile more and suddenly I could see the light bulb go on and <br/>
he got it.  <br/>
<br/>
He had been equating unschooling with unlearning. He thought that I was going <br/>
to shield my kids from any learning situation.  <br/>
<br/>
He talked about how when he was a teacher, he wanted to follow the children&#39;s <br/>
interests, but just got into trouble with the higher ups and eventually <br/>
abandoned teaching.<br/>

I am so sorry that your mom is being so difficult about your schooling.  I<br/>
could imagine my parents doing the same thing, but fortunately I finished<br/>
college a long time ago (without any help from them).  I don&#39;t have answers<br/>
for you.  Maybe you can find a way to finance the schooling so you don&#39;t<br/>
have to depend on your mom.  I did that, but I was much younger at the time<br/>
and didn&#39;t have children, lol.<br/>
<br/>
All of my family is in California or Nevada and we are in North Dakota, so<br/>
they obviously do not have any idea what is going on from day to day.  I do<br/>
mention when we do special things, like the musical, or ice skating, 4H<br/>
stuff, piano recitals, etc.  But I really avoid the subject of schooling.<br/>
They always have felt I am doing my children a disservice by homeschooling<br/>
them, and we have just agreed to disagree.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could talk to them about what the children are learning, using<br/>
&quot;education-ease&quot; but I am not sure that would solve the problem.  Hopefully,<br/>
in time, they will see that children do not have to be taught to learn.<br/>

You are fortunate that you had a cooperative doctor. Last January my<br/>
husband was in the garage working when he broke his leg at about 1:00am.<br/>
I pulled the girls out of bed and took him to the emergency room. As the<br/>
ER doctor is looking my husband over, dd kept chatting with the doctor.<br/>
She wanted to know what happened. The doctor told her that he broke his<br/>
leg. She wanted to know which bone. The doctor told her the one at the<br/>
bottom. She wanted to know exactly which bone. The doctor had no interest<br/>
in talking to her (understandably, as the ER was packed) When we finally<br/>
got home, the first thing she did was go get an anatomy book off her<br/>
shelf. &quot;Now Mom, show me which bone.&quot; So we went all through the<br/>
skeleton, and she made up a new and improved version of that song &quot;Dried<br/>
bones&quot;(I think) using all the technical names of the bones. Then she<br/>
wanted to look at the pictures of muscles. She started cracking up when<br/>
looking at the butt muscles, and wanted to know what they were called. I<br/>
told her that they were the gluteus maximus. She told me my gluteus<br/>
maximuses were big [thanks!] Ever since she has always just called buns<br/>
gluteus maximus, and always giggles like crazy when saying it. And just<br/>
imagine, she wouldn&#39;t be learning this stuff in school till what, 5th or<br/>
6th grade?<br/>

in the past when I first started discussing my families&#39; decision to <br/>

what unschooling, or homeschooling is all about.  By the end of the <br/>
conversation, they may have a better understanding, and it may give them the <br/>
desire to look into it more.  Unschoolers and homeschoolers could give them a <br/>
list of reference material and websites to look into it further and get a <br/>
better understanding of why parents choose to raise their children this way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s very difficult to explain to parents about homeschooling.  It&#39;s <br/>
something that is weird to most people.  The reason for this is because they <br/>
don&#39;t really know anything about it.  They draw conclusions about what <br/>
children must be like who are homeschooled.  Because most parents went to <br/>
school, they cannot begin to understand why anyone would want to homeschool, <br/>
especially unschool, their chidlren.  They also may take it very personally.  <br/>
They may think, &quot;I went to school, and you went to school, so what&#39;s wrong <br/>
with that?  Does this mean you think I made a mistake by sending you to <br/>
school?  You feel I made a bad choice?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I first told my parents about the decision to homeschool, I didn&#39;t <br/>
realize at first that they were defensive because my choice, in their minds, <br/>
was telling them that their choice wasn&#39;t right.  My main decision to <br/>
homeschool had more to do with how children learn best than the environment <br/>
of bullying and teasing, drugs, etc.  After I realized that my decision to <br/>
homeschool made them feel like I was telling them they made a bad choice in <br/>
sending me to school, I had a talk with them.  I explained to them that their <br/>
choice to send me to school wasn&#39;t a bad choice.  There were not many <br/>
homeschoolers back in the &#39;60&#39;s and early &#39;70&#39;s, so even if I knew about it <br/>
and I had kids then, I most likely wouldn&#39;t have homeschooled them.  I <br/>
explained to them with the support groups and technology, and the laws in <br/>
Michigan we have now that it&#39;s a much better time to homeschool, in regards <br/>
to the resources and information available.  After talking to them, it was <br/>
amazing how quickly they began to support our decision to homeschool.  My <br/>
mother and father are all for it and they even inform me when there&#39;s <br/>
anything on TV about homeschooling.  Although they are for it, we have <br/>
different views about homeschooling.  I told them upfront that I will not be <br/>
giving my kids tests, using textbooks (unless kids want to), have a schedule, <br/>
no spelling tests, no lesson plans (not that we won&#39;t plan things), etc.  I <br/>
know this is hard for them to understand but I explained it to them that <br/>
children don&#39;t have to have specific times to learn, sit at a table and work <br/>
on worksheets and tests, and learn the way children at school learn.  I told <br/>
them if I&#39;m going to do that, I misewell just send them to school.  I told <br/>
them I feel strongly that my kids will learn best by making choices on what <br/>
they want to do for the day.  This doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t be there to encourage <br/>
them, give them suggestions, find materials I think they&#39;ll love, and answer <br/>
questions.  My father is beginning to understand, but he still has doubts and <br/>
concerns.  I think this is normal because so do I.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever too late to open up the communications channel.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t think my parents would come around so quickly, but they did.  If you <br/>
talk to them and explain all the reasons why you want to homeschool <br/>
(unschool), give them some material to read on homeschooling or unschooling, <br/>
give them some material to read on the failure and negative aspects of <br/>
schools, let them know that you are not upset with them for sending you to <br/>
school (unless you have anger and resentment for this), let them read success <br/>
stories of people who were homeschooled (the book Homeschoolers&#39; Success <br/>
Stories by Linda Dobson is great) and meet children and families who are <br/>
homeschooled, it may help them understand and give them a realistic feeling <br/>
of what homeschooling is about.  I didn&#39;t give details about how I was going <br/>
to homeschool until quite a bit later than when I first started discussing it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I started doing right away, after relatives and others would ask, is <br/>
explain how their fun and playing gave way to learning.  I realize my kids <br/>
are not of school-age yet (although many kids to go pre-school at their age) <br/>
and there really is no need to do this at their ages, 3 and 4 years old, but <br/>
I think it helps my family understand how everyday things are or can lead to <br/>
a big learning activity.<br/>
<br/>
When my parents once asked my daughter what she did today, she said &quot;I played <br/>
Barbies&quot;.  My parents then asked me how she&#39;s coming with writing her name.  <br/>
They asked me is she started practicing.  I didn&#39;t answer them, but began <br/>
talking about her playing with Barbies.  While playing with her Barbies, she <br/>
had real money that she would use to buy things at the pretend store she <br/>
made.  She has done this for several days in a row and by playing she learned <br/>
all of her coins and how much each are worth.  She even began adding coins <br/>
together, with my help, to figure out how much she needed to buy something.  <br/>
It seemed to make them more relaxed about the idea of letting kids learn on <br/>
their own, or at least for that moment.<br/>
<br/>
Another day my parents were talking to me about how my daughter was doing <br/>
with her writing (this seems to be such a big deal for them), and I said <br/>
fine.  I began telling them how my son and daughter make their own breakfast <br/>
in the morning (with a little help), make their own hot chocolate milk, put <br/>
away their dishes in the sink, help me cook, and help me clean around the <br/>
house.  I told them that this is very important because it gives them a sense <br/>
of accomplishment, it gives them confidence in their abilities, and they are <br/>
skills that are important as they get older.  <br/>
<br/>
Yet, another day my parents asked me the same question about my daughter <br/>
writing her name.  I told them she enjoys writing her name and is doing fine. <br/>
 They asked her what she was doing today and she said playing with Lincoln <br/>
Logs.  She told them about the buildings she and her brother made, how the <br/>
big tornado knocked it down, and then gave them a detailed description of <br/>
what a tornado was and how important it is to go in the basement if we&#39;re <br/>
under a warning.  I explained to them that her discovery of tornadoes has led <br/>
to her desire to learn about other natural things, like volcanoes and <br/>
lightning.  They seemed to be very happy about her learning.<br/>
<br/>
Another day, my daughter signed her name to a card that was for my parents.  <br/>
They were very happy to see that she could write her name.  I explained to <br/>
them that she learned to write her name by having a strong desire to do so.  <br/>
She wanted to write her name on pictures that she drew and on the dry eraser <br/>
board.  I didn&#39;t have to sit her down every day or on a regular basis to make <br/>
her write her name.  This really helped them begin to understand my approach <br/>
to having my children learn what they want, when they want, how they want, <br/>
and where they want.  They are starting to come around.<br/>

Sounds more like he had already read Holt, believed it, tried it, and found <br/>

Patti, what have you done when your kids get the interrogation? <br/>
My poor 13 yodd went to dinner at a friend&#39;s house last night. <br/>
These are the support group leaders for our homeschool group. <br/>
My dd had shared a bit with her friend about our decision to put <br/>
the reins in the hands of the kids for their education. I made <br/>
certain that when she shared with her friends that she be careful <br/>
not to say, &quot;We don&#39;t have to do school any more.&quot; However, no <br/>
matter how it gets explained, I&#39;m finding out that kids hear &quot;They <br/>
don&#39;t do school any more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So while eating dinner, the mother asked my dd what history she <br/>
was studying. The friend piped up: &quot;She doesn&#39;t have to do <br/>
history. She doesn&#39;t even have to do any school!&quot; Needless to <br/>
say, this sparked quite an interrogation. Ironically my dd and I <br/>
had sat together that morning with the Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook laying out some ideas for her to pursue. She likes <br/>
having goals and a plan. So we took her interests and I helped <br/>
her brainstorm a variety of ways to study, write and enjoy her <br/>
interests (which just happen to include tree frogs, classic <br/>
literature, theater arts, French, Norse mythology and AIDs).<br/>
<br/>
She was able to share some of these with concrete ideas she <br/>
has for investigating them, but she did feel like there were lots of <br/>
knowing glances being exchanged between parents. Funny <br/>
thing is, I spoke on unschooling to this group last year. They all <br/>
think I&#39;m an unschooler. (According to the books and lists I was <br/>
on before, I thought so too. According to the definitions here, I <br/>
was an eclectic or relaxed homeschooler). But the idea that you <br/>
would not require any minimum requirements! Well this was too <br/>
much for them.<br/>
<br/>
My dd&#39;s best answer did get their attention. She said, &quot;You know, <br/>
before when my mom was requiring me to do Algebra, I would try <br/>
to put it off and hope to be invited to a friend&#39;s house so I could <br/>
skip it that day. Now that it&#39;s up to me, I want to make sure that I <br/>
get it done. Whether I go to college or not is dependent on me, <br/>
not my mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This impressed them, but the skepticism didn&#39;t go away that <br/>
easily. They all decided that my daughter is an exceptionally <br/>
motivated, unique &quot;good&quot; girl. (This is what I&#39;ve always <br/>
heard--&quot;Your kids are really neat. My kids aren&#39;t like yours. They <br/>
don&#39;t have interests. They would veg out all day in front of the TV <br/>
so I have to require things of them...&quot;) We&#39;ve always appeared to <br/>
be very unstructured compared to everyone we know. And my <br/>
kids have always had a lot of diverse interests that they pursue <br/>
on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think kids ought to have to &quot;defend&quot; their way of <br/>
schooling? How have your kids handled these kinds of &quot;on the <br/>
spot&quot; interviews?<br/>

<br/>
People say that sometimes about my kids too.  Used to, anyway.  <br/>
&quot;Yeah, but your kids are really SMART.&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Yes, but genetics...&quot;<br/>
or &quot;Of course YOU can make unschooling work [because you were a teacher, <br/>
because you&#39;re hyperactive, whatever they&#39;re aiming toward].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But Holly has cited a couple of families she knows well and said (perhaps <br/>
rightly) &quot;They could never be unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So maybe in a way there&#39;s something to it.<br/>
