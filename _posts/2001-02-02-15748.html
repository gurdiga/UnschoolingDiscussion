They had already written that up (and may have responded privately).  <br/>

I don&#39;t know that you are in the minority.  I have, so far, chosen against <br/>
vaccines after a LOT of research, however, I deeply respect any researched <br/>
decision.  There are risks on both sides of this issue and each parent is <br/>
faced with a HUGE burden of deciding which risk is best for their children.<br/>
<br/>
When faced with either disease or possible reaction we have to know that <br/>
we&#39;ve done our homework and made the best decision possible.  It&#39;s the only <br/>
way we can live with the results of our choices.  I could be wrong about <br/>
vaccines and that&#39;s why I always keep my research up, I hope I will always be <br/>
open to learning something different.  Of course, the best any of us can do <br/>
is go with our strongest convictions.<br/>
