<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291705980">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lisa and I have 3 children...ds11, ds9, dd4.  We are <br/>
unschoolers most of the time.  I have a hard time letting go and <br/>
trusting my kids and myself to do the right thing.  So, occasionally <br/>
I fall into the &quot;we need to do school&quot; trap.  That is where I am <br/>
now.  My ds11 spent the day listening to a book on tape (The Thief <br/>
Lord--Funke.)  He started and finished it in one day...this is a <br/>
normal practice for him.  He can and does build amazing things out <br/>
of Legos.  He&#39;s very verbal and creative.  Yet, I find myself <br/>
thinking that he needs to work on math and writing (his weak <br/>
areas.)  He struggles with handwriting and has been working on <br/>
learning to type.  He avoids math like the plague and is very <br/>
limited in computation.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am needing is some encouragement.  Has anyone else <br/>
had a math phobic child that became a &quot;normal&quot; functioning adult <br/>
without math books?  I also have a developmentally delayed child <br/>
(ds9) who struggles with everything.  He can&#39;t read and everything <br/>
has to be concrete for him to understand it.  There is a lot of <br/>
pressure on me from friends and family to do more teaching and <br/>
acquire outside help.  <br/>
<br/>
TIA for any and all encouragement...and tongue lashings for the <br/>
school-at-home mentality. (grin)<br/>

<br/>
I have three who are great at math and think it&#39;s fun.  They&#39;re 17, 14 and 11.<br/>
<br/>
They were without math books.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;ve already  math-booked your child.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;He avoids math like the plague and is very <br/>
<br/>
limited in computation.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
Those things are directly related.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t make him better at math by plaguing him with more math.<br/>
<br/>
You make him hate and fear it more.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess what I am needing is some encouragement. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would like to encourage you to leave him alone about math until he&#39;s <br/>
sixteen or seventeen.  REALLY leave him alone.  But play games with him, just never <br/>
say &quot;math,&quot; and give him allowance but don&#39;t ask him any mathy questions about <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby lately got a bank account with separate savings and checking, and an <br/>
ATM card.  He&#39;s learning, but we&#39;re not &quot;teaching&quot; him.  We tell him this or <br/>
that, like you&#39;d tell anyone who just got an account that&#39;s like one you have.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I also have a developmentally delayed child <br/>
<br/>
(ds9) who struggles with everything.  He can&#39;t read and everything <br/>
<br/>
has to be concrete for him to understand it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think not reading by nine is in and of itself evidence of &quot;delay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I mean in one sense it is.   But &quot;delayed&quot; compared to a batch of hundreds of <br/>
school kids shouldn&#39;t apply to an unschooled child.<br/>
<br/>

Especially Carol Rice&#39;s article.  Her son Liam was a preemie and was &quot;behind&quot; <br/>
in language matters.  He turned nineteen lately.  I know him.  He reads fine.<br/>
<br/>
Read about my kids too, maybe.  None read before late-8, and Holly was 11 or <br/>
late 10.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just a couple of days ago on another list, this came up.  One mother talked <br/>
about her daughter, who could basically add, subtract, and multiply (just <br/>
barely) at 14.  She could deal with money and with fractions as they came <br/>
at her.  She decided she wanted a high school diploma and started taking it <br/>
by correspondance.  They tested her and put her in grade 8 math.  She had <br/>
not trouble understanding it and getting good grades in it and subsequent <br/>
courses.  In the mother&#39;s words, &quot;So. First 14 years, math largely ignored. <br/>
Next few months, math learned<br/>
as needed. No drills. No tears. No fear.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another mother posted with a similar story.  Her son had done a similar <br/>
amount of math up until age 14.  He&#39;s now attending a Sudbury Valley type <br/>
school and elected to take a grade 10 math class.  Again, no problem other <br/>
than it being a bit boring.<br/>
