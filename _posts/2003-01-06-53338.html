<div id="ygrps-yiv-897519722">Dear Joyce,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your thoughtful response. I think you misunderstand me though. <br/>
As I said in my post, I wasn&#39;t particularly interested in much of Ned&#39;s <br/>
political rhetoric, I just believe that censorship of different viewpoints is <br/>
hypocritical behavior from a forum that chooses to represent all unschoolers <br/>
by virtue of the name you chose to represent this forum. By choosing a name <br/>
such as unschooling-dotcom you are choosing to represent all discussion that <br/>
relates to unschooling in even the most remote or annoying sense. As <br/>
evidenced by the fact that almost anything goes here---I&#39;ve seen discussions <br/>
about baby care, personal family problems, neighbor issues, notes about <br/>
vacations, and the ever present fundamentalist Christian rhetoric----the list <br/>
is endless. I&#39;ve seen all kinds of things here that I have a hard time <br/>
relating to unschooling, I may delete hundreds of posts that I find not <br/>
relevant, but I would never presume to suggest banishing someone simply <br/>
because their agenda does not fit my own definition of something as all <br/>
encompassing as the concept of unschooling. Also, if someone&#39;s posts generate <br/>
tons of responses, that means that the posts are making people think! If I <br/>
owned a list, my dearest wish would be to get people thinking. Often, when we <br/>
have been in a very complacent rut, we may need a very uncomfortable nudge to <br/>
jolt us into moving forward and growing as individuals.<br/>
       I think that you should seriously reconsider the move you made by <br/>
banishing any individuals based on differences of opinion. If you do not want <br/>
to change your policy, then perhaps instead of steering people to more <br/>
open-minded sites, you might want to change the name of this forum to <br/>
something that reflects a much narrower vision, and leave the unschooling <br/>
name open to another list owner who won&#39;t allow a few strong-minded <br/>
individuals to call the shots.<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do understand what you&#39;re saying. It&#39;s a good point. And I&#39;m sure Helen<br/>
still isn&#39;t totally comfortable with the decision.<br/>
<br/>
In theory everyone who has anything to say about their definition of<br/>
unschooling should be welcome here. In actual practice, too many posts makes<br/>
the list unusable. And I mean that literally. The month Ned was here, there<br/>
were 4086 posts. That&#39;s over 130 posts a day assuming they were all evenly<br/>
distributed. Even if I drop the months that were below 1000, the average for<br/>
this list is just over 2000 a month. And at that level it&#39;s considered a<br/>
very busy list. <br/>
<br/>
So far the criteria for making the ban decision isn&#39;t based on what ideas<br/>
someone has but on whether the list can continue to be what people signed on<br/>
for. Yes, of course, the list isn&#39;t going to cease functioning because<br/>
someone agrees with everyone! It&#39;s going to be because of incompatible<br/>
ideas. Incompatible ideas are great fodder for debate! Debate is a *good*<br/>
thing. It creates an atmosphere for people to work hard at making their<br/>
ideas crystal clear so others can understand. But there is good productive<br/>
debate and there is disruptive debate.<br/>
<br/>
So where does the line get drawn? Is the purpose of this list a forum for<br/>
free debate or a forum to gain ideas from? Hopefully both! But if the<br/>
freedom to speak makes the list unusable to gain ideas from, what purpose is<br/>
the list serving?<br/>
<br/>
There was some great discussion while Ned was here. His ideas instigated a<br/>
phonics debate, something that many people may not have been involved in<br/>
before. But the quality of discussion wasn&#39;t matching the volume of mail it<br/>
was generating. It was just spinning its wheels covering the same territory<br/>
over and over with increasing stridency.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, if someone&#39;s posts generate<br/>

&gt; have been in a very complacent rut, we may need a very uncomfortable nudge to<br/>
&gt; jolt us into moving forward and growing as individuals.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Speaking specifically about that incident, and why I felt it was more<br/>
disruptive than thought filled, I&#39;ve been in lots of noisy frustrating<br/>
debates where people are clearly not understanding each other. To me that<br/>
wasn&#39;t the case here. The quality was different. Ned appeared to neither<br/>
respond to the opposing ideas nor to the objections to his ideas. He<br/>
attacked people personally and basically just repeated what he&#39;d said before<br/>
as though others just weren&#39;t listening to him. The thinking it prompted at<br/>
the beginning was great. But it devolved into repeating those thoughts over<br/>
and over and over and was noise filling up people&#39;s mail boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Helen&#39;s take may be different than that. It&#39;s really a judgement call based<br/>
on whether what&#39;s being gained is worth what&#39;s being lost.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think that you should seriously reconsider the move you made by<br/>
&gt; banishing any individuals based on differences of opinion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did I make the position any clearer? Obviously difference of opinion is<br/>
going to be a common criterion among those banned from any list. (Well,<br/>
except those banned because they were disruptive just to be disruptive.) But<br/>
the basis for banning isn&#39;t difference of opinion but disruption that isn&#39;t<br/>
returning more than it&#39;s disrupting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you do not want<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s Helen&#39;s list and a part of the Unschooling.com website.<br/>
<br/>
How would you define the vision of unschooling here?<br/>
<br/>
How do you think a more open minded site would define unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
To me, the one unshakable point, is trusting children. From what I see, all<br/>
the unschooling and parenting debates turn on that point. The debates about<br/>
learning seem to be based on a lack of understanding about natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the point where you feel this forum is too narrow? (I&#39;d really like<br/>
to avoid talking about specific people and avoid how the ideas appear to<br/>
stay narrow. Just talk about the ideas that could be expressed and what the<br/>
definition of unschooling would look like if those ideas were expressed. How<br/>
would the idea of unschooling be different?)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everyone has a right to an opinion. But to be useful opinions need to be<br/>
discussable.<br/>
<br/>
Like offering advice to help someone deal with a child&#39;s temper tantrums, we<br/>
need to discuss the whys behind the behavior not the whats.<br/>
<br/>
We can try to discuss individual incidents as they come up but I&#39;ve never<br/>
seen it do more than fill the list with anger and hurt feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately it comes down to some people not being able to understand other<br/>
people&#39;s style and that has, as much as people have tried for the 8 years<br/>
I&#39;ve been around unschooling message boards and lists, been unresolvable.<br/>
It&#39;s best to just ignore the people you don&#39;t &quot;get&quot;.<br/>

In traditional schooling we are fed a diet of information chosen by someone <br/>
else. That someone else might be wonderful or horrible, it&#39;s still someone <br/>
else deciding what we&#39;ll learn---censorship in a nutshell. If unschooling is <br/>
the opposite of traditional schooling, then we and our children get to decide <br/>
what, when, and how we&#39;ll learn. We must censor ourselves! When individuals <br/>
on the list start deciding what we can read, then they are putting themselves <br/>
in the position of teacher/censor. This makes no sense on a site named <br/>
unschooling-dotcom. I have often seen the idea of trusting children as <br/>
integral to the idea of unschooling, but it seems that you trust the children <br/>
and not the adults.<br/>

When new unschoolers or people who are not even unschoolers come and <br/>
repeatedly dispute common principles of unschooling, THAT will close doors <br/>
for new unschoolers.  It will give them the message that staying in their <br/>
comfort zone is just as good as trying new things.  It will tell them (as <br/>

&lt;&lt; If unschooling is <br/>
the opposite of traditional schooling, then we and our children get to decide <br/>
what, when, and how we&#39;ll learn. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point!  And this list is not the &quot;school&quot; in which all that learning <br/>
takes place.<br/>
<br/>
You can decide what, when and how you will learn from everything in the whole <br/>
wide world, but it won&#39;t include telling all those libraries, stores, <br/>
classes, riding stables, and video stores what they should stock and what <br/>
their policies will be.<br/>
<br/>
If this list is one of the thousands of sources you use, accept it for what <br/>
it is.<br/>

something altogether different.<br/>

happened, what Ned said or didn&#39;t say?<br/>
