<div id="ygrps-yiv-71508541">Hi.  This is a wonderful list!  I&#39;ve been reading and wanting to jump in, I<br/>
m ready now but thought maybe a little intro would be appropriate...or not.<br/>
lol  We are Tammy (me), Keith (hubby), Haley (9), Kayla (8), Katy (5),<br/>
Denver (2).  Sometime around 32 (I agree with you Sandra, my mom also<br/>
started looking for answers around that age) it hit me that how we were<br/>
living was just yuck.  We moved to NW Mississippi after 2 years of Memphis<br/>
(TN) City Public Schools...ugggg.   What a bad taste that was!  We started<br/>
home-schooling but I hated pushing, they hated &quot;doing school&quot;.  As a teen I<br/>
saw no tangible reason to have all this info pushed on me without my<br/>
approval, then I saw it happening to my kids.  No wonder we rebel so much as<br/>
teens.  NO more...we are free, and you all came at just the perfect time. <br/>
Support is here! :-)  I&#39;m so excited.  My two oldest still have a bit a<br/>
de-schooling yet to get their trust in me back...I was so pushy and<br/>
irritable.  I finally let it go and it&#39;s amazing to see all the discoveries<br/>
being made all by themselves....all I had to do was open my eyes leave them<br/>
alone!  Amazing.  The only support groups that I am aware of in my area are<br/>
not for us, and I don&#39;t know of un-schoolers in my area, but surely there<br/>
are...I&#39;ll find them.   Anyway, great to be here. :-D<br/>
