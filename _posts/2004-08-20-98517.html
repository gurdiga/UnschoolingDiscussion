<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087722297">I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for gameboy games for a <br/>
4 year old. Sam is quite adept at computer games like Imaginext, <br/>
Zoombinis, Scooby-Doo.<br/>
<br/>
He often has a really hard time doing things and going places that the <br/>
girls really enjoy, and I&#39;m trying to come up with strategies. He would <br/>
prefer to be home playing his computer games, so I was thinking a <br/>
gameboy might be a good solution. Other things/ distractions haven&#39;t <br/>
been successful, and I find I&#39;m mostly wrestling him, which is <br/>
exhausting. Meaning I&#39;m usually his jungle gym, letting him climb from <br/>
shoulders to my hip, jump, somersault up my legs, etc. or taking him out <br/>
for walks in which case I miss much of whatever it is we&#39;re doing. <br/>
Leaving him home isn&#39;t really an option either because 1) he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like being with other people and 2) we don&#39;t really know anyone who <br/>
could keep him during the day even if I would leave him. The girls have <br/>
always liked museums and other kinds of stuff, even at early ages; Sam <br/>
runs hot/cold with short bursts of attention. I&#39;d rather not stop doing <br/>
these kinds of things--being a human jungle gym is still preferable to that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also open to other suggestions. I gave my Sears&#39; sling away a couple <br/>
years ago, but I was toying with the idea of picking up another one at a <br/>
second hand store. Sam doesn&#39;t much like to be confined, but it might <br/>
make the constant holding/ putting down easier on me, and it&#39;s not all <br/>
that bulky to carry when he&#39;s not interested. I remember using it quite <br/>
often when Em was older as a piggyback carrier. Other thoughts?<br/>
