<div id="ygrps-yiv-107176000">&quot;Sit back down please, and excuse yourself.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I know this wasn&#39;t the point of the post in which the question was raised <br/>
about rude kids....but I couldn&#39;t help but notice this statement.<br/>
I can&#39;t STAND it when kids are expected to ASK to get up from the table.<br/>
I think it is very hypocritical. <br/>
First of all, do the adults have to ask the kids to be excused?  Would you <br/>
make your friends come back in and ask? Just which guests in your home have to <br/>
ask to be excused?  And would the answer ever be no?<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts to ponder. I don&#39;t think that the rude little neighbor <br/>
friend will benefit from this type of treatment. <br/>
<br/>
He does need some strong reminders of how to act in your home. But I fail to <br/>
see how this one will help.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I know this wasn&#39;t the point of the post in which the question was raised<br/>
about rude kids....but I couldn&#39;t help but notice this statement.<br/>
I can&#39;t STAND it when kids are expected to ASK to get up from the table.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I think of children having to ask to be excused I have a picture of a<br/>
very religious farming family. Those that have children that sit very<br/>
quietly at the table and say nothing unless they are spoken to. If anything<br/>
is said at all  it comes from the father. A very submissive picture, like<br/>
the kids and wife get beat. Sorry, but I guess I picked that up from TV<br/>
somewhere as I never knew anyone who had to ask to leave the table.<br/>
<br/>
My kids say, I&#39;m done and I say okay and off they go. Once in awhile if it&#39;s<br/>
a sit down dinner for an occasion, (seems like that&#39;s the only time we have<br/>
them anymore) I&#39;ll ask whoever is ready to leave first (that would be<br/>
Joseph) to hang out with us for a few minutes. I find Alyssa doesn&#39;t eat<br/>
like she wants to if the other kids run off.  When she&#39;s done, then Joseph<br/>
and her can both go. Sierra will only leave when she&#39;s had enough. That<br/>
could usually be quite awhile!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with that.   I don&#39;t like treating kids differently than I treat <br/>
adults if I can help it.   And people don&#39;t &quot;excuse themselves,&quot; but as Ren <br/>
stated, they ask to be excused.  &quot;Excuse me&quot; is short for &quot;will you excuse me?&quot;  The <br/>
fact that most people don&#39;t respond any more, it&#39;s leftover from more formal <br/>
times when rank and hostess&#39; position had obligations which are fading.<br/>
<br/>
I did ask a guest kid not to chew with his mouth open the other day.  Chips, <br/>
while watching Marty play video games. Crunch, smack, crunch.  I was in there <br/>
folding laundry and I&#39;m as unused to smacking as I am to people lighting up <br/>
cigarettes in my house (that hasn&#39;t happened for twenty years), and I finally <br/>
asked him please to chew with his mouth closed because the noise really bothered <br/>
me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274959248">Hopefully by now, my replies to this have been read, in the &quot;friends <br/>
over&quot; thread. I, also, recognized the Knee-Jerkiness of what I did, <br/>
and it came from an un-thinking reaction to a kid doing something <br/>
rude, that I&#39;d not experienced before. Which I thought I&#39;d gotten <br/>
across to the list, but obviously did not.<br/>
<br/>
One reason why this is done has been mentioned (not a &quot;submit to <br/>
father, children mustn&#39;t speak at table&quot;, as Mary said she pictured): <br/>
acknowledging the host and hostess. This is not a bad thing to do: <br/>
nothing wrong with graciousness. Another reason why a kid might ask <br/>
to be excused, could have to do with the conversation at the table. <br/>
Maybe something is being discussed that involves the whole family, <br/>
and so the whole family needs to be there. Maybe there are things <br/>
that need doing before kids scatter. And so, a kid finds out if he is <br/>
going to be needed at the table to contribute to the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing wrong w/that, either. <br/>
<br/>
If an adult friend came over and ate dinner, and left without saying <br/>
thank you, it might be awhile before he or she was invited over <br/>
again. But hopefully, in growing up, adults have encountered and <br/>
learned, how to be mannerly. <br/>
<br/>
And, I am coming at this from a different point of view than most <br/>
people in this list, in that I believe there is a hierarchy in life. <br/>
There is an authority structure: parents have authority over their <br/>
kids. So, no...mom and dad wouldn&#39;t ask kids permission to leave, <br/>
because kids don&#39;t have authority over their mom and dad. <br/>

the circles I was a part of (church, bible studies etc.) And <br/>
therefore I saw authority as a big responsiblity to enforce  or <br/>

<br/>
But that&#39;s changed for me now and ironically, I feel like the kind of <br/>
authority-style I now live is much more like Jesus than it was <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten to a point where I see my authority as an opportunity to <br/>
honor and serve my kids. I see it as my responsiblity as the <br/>
authority to create the loving environment that makes living with <br/>
me a joy insofar as I&#39;m able.<br/>
<br/>
Principles for living together come from my interest in serving <br/>
and helping and supporting and respecting. Insofar as I&#39;m able, I <br/>
want to live in such a way with my children that I embody the <br/>
things I hope they will internalize.<br/>
<br/>
So just to take the dinner one as the example: we don&#39;t worry <br/>
about kids being excused because being at the dinner table is <br/>
really a fun place to be. and if anyone is tired of the banter after <br/>
dinner, he or she will often say (parents included) are we done? <br/>
I&#39;d like to get on to X now if everyone doesn&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I say--this is what a child will say. The conclusion of <br/>
dinner is when everyone is sated both with food and each other. <br/>
Appreciation for a good meal is expressed when the meal turns <br/>
out good! And then I sure appreciate the thanks because I know <br/>
it comes from my having succeeded in bringing my family a great <br/>
meal.<br/>

because kids don&#39;t have authority over their mom and dad. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I, too, believe there is a hierarchy in life.  *However* it is one of <br/>
experience not authority.  Didn&#39;t you say you live by the &#39;golden rule&#39; in <br/>
your house?  What you have written above doesn&#39;t, in my eyes, fit into that. <br/>
  When you begin to view people as people, without rank or authority, you <br/>
open the world to new and better ways of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
By experience, we, as adults, are responsible for mainting the safety of our <br/>
children.  By example, we guide them in being respectful and caring people.  <br/>
Not by demand or some arbitrary authority.<br/>
<br/>
I ask you to consider what your goal is in making a child acknowledge and <br/>
thank a hostess for a meal but not needing an adult to do so.  Personally, I <br/>
would be more shocked if an adult chose not to do so, rather than an <br/>
inexperienced child.<br/>
<br/>
I am in no way accusing you of this, but it sure sounds like parents who <br/>
think it is within their &#39;right&#39; to spank a child but wouldn&#39;t allow the <br/>
child to hit them back!  Neither make sense to me.<br/>

<br/>
When I read that I thought of the disciples asking Jesus to be excused.  Why <br/>
would they want to leave the table if Jesus were still there?  They were <br/>
hanging around him because they wanted to learn everything they could from being <br/>
with him.  &quot;Can I go now?&quot; probably wasn&#39;t a big part of it.<br/>

Exactly like that!<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s NOT fun, then people SHOULD go do something else, because one person <br/>
wishing he were elsewhere throws a damper on the remaining people&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in part there are different mom-styles.  I don&#39;t see mealtimes as <br/>
visual moments.  It wouldn&#39;t disturb my sense of order to have an empty chair.  <br/>
What would disturb me much more would be unhappiness either at or away from the <br/>
table.  I keep a running inventory of who&#39;s happy, and if they&#39;re all happy, I <br/>
don&#39;t care whether I can see them at that moment or not.<br/>

Hi, Heidi --<br/>
<br/>
I think replies and replies-to-replies will still be dribbling in for<br/>
awhile.  Just because of the time delays when people get behind on a big<br/>
list.  It&#39;s not because people think you need a few extra swats (honest)<br/>
it&#39;s because people still want to offer their two cents worth. <br/>

OOPS!  I just got to this part of your post.  Now I would predict that<br/>
discussion about &quot;authority&quot; won&#39;t die down for at least a week. <br/>
&quot;Obedience&quot; is a word that always makes me want to spit, or at least<br/>
grimmace, and &quot;authority&quot; is close behind it on the list of words and<br/>
ideas that I don&#39;t like.  I think you hit a hot button here, and there<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right. This happened w/4-H this year. We got a box of chicks, hatch <br/>
run, with the idea that we&#39;d butcher for the freezer, any cockerels, <br/>
and keep the pullets for eggs. And we thought it would make a good 4-<br/>
H project for our 10 yr. old. But two weeks ago, when I asked if he&#39;d <br/>
weighed the chickens and put it in the record book &quot;for your chicken <br/>
4-H project&quot; he said &quot;I never wanted that for a project, mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*gulp*<br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;re still going to cull the cockerels from the flock, but it is <br/>
no longer a 4-H project! L because it wasn&#39;t his to begin with, it <br/>
was my bright idea.<br/>
<br/>
And I am willing to bow out of many things for the sake of my kids&#39; <br/>
choosing their own selves. But there are some things that a parent <br/>
sticks to her guns. For instance, I get the choice of whether they <br/>
brush their teeth or not, since I have to pay the dentist bill. <br/>
Things like that, where the impact of their choices would be pretty <br/>
heavy on my shoulders, or on others&#39; shoulders (public safety comes <br/>
in here). <br/>

I&#39;m jumping in right here even though I think there is more to come of this thread (why do I get so behind with my messages?).<br/>
<br/>
This thread is a joy to read.  You are being so thought full (as in full of thinking LOL) and I just really really really appreciate seeing someone ask questions and then stick around and think about the answers and ask more and all the good stuff that I just knew would happen on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m still shell shocked from some of the &#39;trainwreck&#39; threads that have happened not so long ago and felt the urge to acknowledge your steadfastness and also the hoooooge amount of wisdom coming from the list (as it always does.)<br/>

aww...*sniff* *dab*<br/>
<br/>
thank you. I really am trying to learn. Going through a huge paradigm <br/>
shift here, and that&#39;s scary. Feeling clueless and feeling like I <br/>
really messed up my oldest boy (23, &quot;victim&quot; of my cluelessness, <br/>
immaturity, harshness, what have you) But this list helps so much.<br/>
<br/>
SO MUCH to think about. SO MUCH inner work to do.<br/>

<br/>
And who determines who is the authority (ranking individual) of each subject? <br/>
Or are there already specified ranking individuals that this list has chosen <br/>
in the past to be all-knowing? If so, then could someone please name who&#39;s <br/>
who, so the non-ranking individuals can be silently identified? In other words, <br/>
if you&#39;re not on the list of the authorities, then what? You don&#39;t post, or you <br/>
post only when you openly acknowledge that you remember you are not an <br/>
authority? But what if, I mean just what if, someone out there in Unschooling-dotcom <br/>
land reads the authority figures stance, and not only disagrees, but is <br/>
positive they are in fact far more knowledgable? Or would that fall under, they <br/>

Whoever said it, had a brilliant mind.<br/>
<br/>

Do you think the people here believe that getting personal is a useful<br/>
tactic to make a point? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really not sure what anyone here thinks. Apparently, some do and some <br/>
don&#39;t. I just find it odd that getting personal is okay for some people, but when <br/>
others utilize identical tactics, they get slammed. Then again there are <br/>
instances when someone gets personal, then claims they never do that or that <br/>
wasn&#39;t their intent. <br/>

Joyce wrote:<br/>
Do you think they¹ll realize how juvenile that<br/>
tactic is and develop more mature forms of debate because you¹ve pointed it<br/>

Apparently, one can only hope.<br/>

Joyce writes:<br/>
There are generally complex dynamics involved. It¹s especially complex when<br/>
two sides are arguing  different topics with one or both sides not realizing<br/>

simple answer.<br/>

I agree.<br/>

<br/>
Still - if someone came in here trying to tell people that the <br/>
definition of statistic significance was something that I know it is <br/>
not - someone who isn&#39;t a statistician and has no background in the <br/>
field, I have to admit that I hope you all would give my definition <br/>
more credence than hers, partly based on my education in the field and <br/>
experience in the field, but also based on the fact that I&#39;ve offered <br/>
statistical information and explanations here in the past and I&#39;d hope <br/>
that I&#39;ve built up credibility that way, too.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s mostly the way people here get recognized, generally, as having <br/>
a lot of knowledge of a subject - they post information and ideas and <br/>
people, over time, start to take what they say particularly to heart - <br/>
having found that their advice and information and ideas were valuable, <br/>
accurate, useful, etc., in the past.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to say that we weren&#39;t arguing over definitions - but <br/>
perhaps we should have been - that would have probably short-circuited <br/>
the ridiculous argument about whether or not people have social rank <br/>
since I&#39;m pretty sure that people were defining the term, &quot;rank,&quot; <br/>
differently from each other. So if we&#39;d discussed definitions, nobody <br/>
would have had to be the authority, in this case, but we still would <br/>
have at least understood that we weren&#39;t using the term the same way.<br/>
