&lt;&lt; Tuck,  what&#39;s a BOA from Cracker Barrel?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oooh!  I want to guess!!<br/>
<br/>
Is it a long scarf made of turkey feathers dyed the same orange as cheese <br/>
sauce, for draping around oneself while rocking in a rocking chair and eating <br/>
fried okra?<br/>
<br/>
(I bet I&#39;m wrong...)<br/>

You&#39;d win that bet, but that&#39;s a good guess!<br/>
<br/>
Book on audio.  Cracker Barrel has them on a rack.  You buy the book, and <br/>
then you can take it back at any time and it will only cost you 3 bucks a week.  <br/>
So if you&#39;re making a long trip, say from Memphis to Columbia, SC, you can <br/>
stop at the first Cracker Barrel and pick up a Lemony Snicket, and then in <br/>
Knoxville you can stop, have supper, and turn that one in and pick up the next in <br/>
the series.  Their selection for children is not that big, but they usually have <br/>
best sellers, and Hardy Boys.  <br/>
