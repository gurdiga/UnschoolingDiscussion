<div id="ygrps-yiv-396802949">****it seems unfair to punish her too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Hopefully we&#39;ll be able to play with them next week, but only if<br/>
Connor<br/>
gets his work done. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Invite him over and help him do it!  &lt;bwg&gt;***<br/>
<br/>
I tried the first one, explaining that we haven&#39;t seen them all week and<br/>
it it feels like we are all being punished.  But Connor is being tested<br/>
this week (not sure what that means, it&#39;s through the charter school<br/>
they use) and they can&#39;t skip out on that.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t go to their house, they live on a military base, and I was a<br/>
bad girl many years ago and did some heavy duty protesting and now I&#39;m<br/>
not allowed on any military bases (I&#39;ve tried, there was a scene).<br/>
<br/>
We are not allowed to help, she doesn&#39;t even help him!  He has to do it<br/>
on his own.  We&#39;ve tried the play at the park while he finishes stuff,<br/>
but there&#39;s a lot of yelling (by her) and a lot of protesting by him<br/>
(rightly so IMHO) and neither of my kids want to do that again.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;ll wait for them.  Maybe they&#39;ll stop the school stuff a few weeks<br/>
before they move and we can play a little.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some unschoolers will move here and we&#39;ll never hear those excuses<br/>
again!  It&#39;s gorgeous here!  Very much like the south of France! (so<br/>
says my kid&#39;s French godfather).  Good hiking!  Hint, hint<br/>
<br/>
Kate<br/>
who is going to the beach and then the farmer&#39;s market for fresh,<br/>
no-spray strawberries to make jam with this weekend.</div>

I actually can&#39;t reccomend moving here, it&#39;s gotten SO expensive in the<br/>
past ten years.  But if you can afford $250,000 tract houses, then come<br/>
on down!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 1 hour north of Santa Barbara and 1 hour south of San Luis Obispo,<br/>
in California.  Right on the coast.  It&#39;s gorgeous here.<br/>
(San Diego is nice too ;) )<br/>

If you rent it&#39;s not to bad, and I find that what we save on fresh produce makes up for it.<br/>
<br/>
We spent almost a $1.00 on a bunch of celery when we were in Mich, a few months ago, got home and spent $.19 on it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553668822">Thanks...<br/>
we&#39;re actually rebuilding! There will be a new & improved Coyotes Corner! We haven&#39;t added anything to this (current) page - I need my web designer to do it!  ($$$)However, we&#39;re using a new program - that is almost as easy as sending e-mail!<br/>
We&#39;re adding so much stuff! Including a section on homeschooling! Bumper stickers, posters, t-shirts and a page of links.<br/>
<br/>
We really have to get out of here. It gets more & more expensive! We&#39;re very environmental - wear layers, etc....we have Lozens gift blankets on our north walls (they really look good!)<br/>
We &quot;insulate&quot; the north windows with that &#39;thinsulate&#39; stuff.<br/>
I don&#39;t even want to tell you how much we spend on heat!! And then there are other expenses.....<br/>
<br/>
Pool......(sigh)<br/>
