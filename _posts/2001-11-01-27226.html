<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084046628">Hi all, <br/>
I have looked high and low but I cannot find a chat group for homeschoolers<br/>
who are surviving separation or divorce. Is there such a thing?<br/>
I have a few dear internet friends who are emailing me but I would still<br/>
like a &quot;family&quot; of support for the middle of the night type of<br/>
correspondence... and to address my immediate concerns about the access. <br/>
 My concerns are specific and cannot be addressed in this forum as there<br/>
are few that they would apply to. <br/>
Has anyone seen a chat group of this type or have any suggestions?<br/>
I really need help on this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now I see why you were looking for uplifting reading material.  I wondered <br/>
what your trial was.  I&#39;m not doing the homeschooling after divorce thing <br/>
now, but I did for a while.  I think my situation was probably so different <br/>
that it wouldn&#39;t be much help to you.  I pulled my son out long after we <br/>
were divorced.  After a year and a half, he threatened me with court if I <br/>
didn&#39;t put Noah back in school.  Being 8 months pregnant with Lars and <br/>
knowing that Noah wanted all the fighting to end, I caved.  One thing I <br/>
found out during that period was that in BC anyway, joint guardianship <br/>
gives both parents a say in educational matters.  Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s an <br/>
issue for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you tried searching on yahoogroups?  There might be something <br/>
there.  If there isn&#39;t already a group, there should be.  I know that it&#39;s <br/>
very common for dads who were supportive of homeschooling to do a reversal <br/>
when the marraige breaks up.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there, Brook.  I&#39;m thinking of you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116013168">Hi there Tia and Tami, <br/>
Thanks for your links and support. I will delve in later. <br/>
<br/>
Yes. I am out of the closet...so to speak. For the longest time I was alone<br/>
but I am reaching out now. <br/>
IT is a VERY difficult time. <br/>
Any love and support can&#39;t do anything but help at this point. <br/>
I walk around with a big fear lump in my gut...a very visceral response to<br/>
a very trying time.<br/>
I am so worreid about the kids...he considers them chattel.<br/>
