systems can be separate. The thought process or mind or pyschological. . . <br/>
however  we choose to define it is so intertwined in it all that it cannot <br/>
separate out. Everything that happens first begins as a thought, whether <br/>
totally conscious or subconscious or some variation therein. <br/>
<br/>
To go a little further with this thought process. . . if we look all around <br/>
us, everything we see first had to be thought of by someone. The computer, <br/>
the keyboard, the walls, paint, etc. . . all of it began as a thought in <br/>
someone&#39;s mind.  I don&#39;t think I will get into who thought &quot;us&quot; up, because I <br/>
know there are so many differing spiritual belief&#39;s, but I do believe there <br/>
had to be a thought about it first. Similarily, I believe the same thing to <br/>
happen in our own bodies. . . and the thought/mind process is so intertwined <br/>
with the physical parts, it becomes difficult to distinguish where one begins <br/>
and the other ends.<br/>
<br/>
As always, this is my own truth, and is not meant to argue with anyone else&#39;s <br/>
truth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then you totally misunderstood what I said. Fault is not at issue <br/>
here at all. I simply said my belief is that it begins with thought, <br/>
somewhere in our minds/spirits/subconscious, etc. I never implied in <br/>
any fashion that anyone is at fault. . . that is strictly your <br/>
thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
I dont think it is a bad thing or something to feel bad about when a <br/>
body doesnt function &quot;ideally&quot;. I have diseases and conditions as <br/>
well. . . I am not excluding myself from the discussion. I do not <br/>
believe anything &quot;just happens&quot;. . . it just is not in my realm of <br/>
possibility that this is the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that all things that occur can serve as a great opportunity <br/>
for learning or remembering for us, including things we believe to be <br/>
a negative or harmful occurence in our lives. I try to not look at <br/>
disease or addiciton or anything of that nature as bad. . . I look at <br/>
it as an opportunity that I have chosen to experience.<br/>
<br/>
No one can make another &quot;feel&#39; a certain way. If this dialog is <br/>
bringing up issues for someone, it is another opportunity to grow and <br/>
learn. Those things that bring out the strongest reactions in us are <br/>
there for our own opportunity. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878466300">The way I see and think of it is that nobody (or very<br/>
few) consciously &#39;thinks&#39; up their illnesses. It&#39;s a<br/>
very subtle subconscious thing. It could be caused by<br/>
something like self-esteem issues or a traumatic early<br/>
childhood experience (or a past life experience - but<br/>
that&#39;s a bit too &#39;out there&#39; for some people). But<br/>
also in the above situations I certainly don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s a &#39;blame&#39; issue. I believe it&#39;s more like an urge<br/>
to self awareness: what do I need to learn from this<br/>
experience?, I wonder if there&#39;s a psychological link<br/>
that I missed?, etc. Also, what about all the people<br/>
that have healed themselves of &#39;incurable&#39; diseases by<br/>
sheer mind power. I wonder if that&#39;s like what&#39;s being<br/>
discussed here in reverse? Or maybe something like:<br/>
&#39;My mind made me ill somehow so my mind will fix me&#39;<br/>
(put in a very simplistic way).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-315185639">I absolutely agree with both of these statements. I<br/>
suffer from migraines and though I know it&#39;s because<br/>

as opposed to neck pain) has some sort of<br/>
psychological basis. I&#39;m convinced this is true for me<br/>

headaches has failed (Reiki is the only thing that has<br/>
helped at all). And I have tried aromatherapy,<br/>
