<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074543966">Politics is all around us, and there isn&#39;t any &quot;we&quot; who can &quot;take the <br/>
power back&quot; if individuals can&#39;t keep it and use it wisely on their own. Kinda <br/>
like the Wizard of Oz and the search for home -- if you are looking for the <br/>
political power of independence, don&#39;t look anywhere other than your own <br/>
backyard because if it isn&#39;t there, you never really lost it in the first place. You <br/>
just didn&#39;t realize you had it already. :)  JJ<br/>

take ALL the children, you can&#39;t trust the teachers either.<br/>
Everyone knows only uncle sam trully has our best interests in mind <br/>
and can protect all from every evil.<br/>
