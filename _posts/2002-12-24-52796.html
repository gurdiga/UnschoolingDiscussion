<br/>
 <br/>
A Parents Night Before Christmas <br/>
<br/>
&#39;Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house <br/>
I searched for the tools to hand to my spouse. <br/>
Instructions were studied and we were inspired, <br/>
In hopes we could manage &quot;Some Assembly Required.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The children were quiet (not asleep) in their beds, <br/>
While Dad and I faced the evening with dread: <br/>
A kitchen, two bikes, Barbie&#39;s town house to boot! <br/>
And, thanks to Grandpa, a train with a toot! <br/>
<br/>
We opened the boxes, my heart skipped a beat...<br/>
Let no parts be missing or parts incomplete! <br/>
Too late for last-minute returns or replacement; <br/>
If we can&#39;t get it right, it goes in the basement! <br/>
<br/>
When what to my worrying eyes should appear, <br/>
But 50 sheets of directions, concise, but not clear,<br/>
With each part numbered and every slot named, <br/>
So if we failed, only we could be blamed. <br/>
<br/>
More rapid than eagles the parts then fell out,<br/>
All over the carpet they were scattered about. <br/>
&quot;Now bolt it! Now twist it! Attach it right there! <br/>
Slide on the seats, and staple the stair!<br/>
Hammer the shelves, and nail to the stand.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Honey,&quot; said hubby, &quot;you just glued my hand.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And then in a twinkling, I knew for a fact<br/>
That all the toy dealers had indeed made a pact<br/>
To keep parents busy all Christmas Eve night <br/>
With &quot;assembly required&quot; till morning&#39;s first light.<br/>
<br/>
We spoke not a word, but kept bent at our work,<br/>
Till our eyes, they went bleary; our fingers all hurt.<br/>
The coffee went cold and the night, it wore thin <br/>
Before we attached the last rod and last pin. <br/>
<br/>
Then laying the tools away in the chest,<br/>
We fell into bed for a well-deserved rest.<br/>
But I said to my husband just before I passed out, <br/>
&quot;This will be the best Christmas, without any doubt. <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow we&#39;ll cheer, let the holiday ring, <br/>
And not have to run to the store for a thing! <br/>
We did it! We did it! The toys are all set <br/>
For the perfect, most perfect, Christmas, I bet!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then off to dreamland and sweet repose I gratefully went, <br/>
Though I suppose there&#39;s something to say for those self-deluded...<br/>
I&#39;d forgotten that BATTERIES are never included! <br/>
    <br/>
