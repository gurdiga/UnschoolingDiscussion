<div id="ygrps-yiv-298494367">Hi Janice:<br/>
<br/>
Mine are 11! When they were young toddlers, we had problems with them fighting over toys...we couldn&#39;t convince them to share, etc... after a while, I came to the conclusion that matching their favorites was the way to go... boy was that like magic! When the 2nd wooden lawnmower/vaccum toy (don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called, you roll it around on the floor, it has balls in a sort of cage)... arrived, I pulled the 2nd one out of hiding & gave the boys both toys... after that the fighting dropped tremendously... to the point where one boy would pick up both toys & give the other to his brother... that was SOOO sweet.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re older now & we can negotiate, etc... and they&#39;re very different: look in their crayon box to see: one boy has his gold & silver down to stubs & the other has his gold & silver unused! (First time I saw this, I laughed! :) ) Ask them a question, 2 different answers... different interests, goals, etc... fiercely loyal & occasionally they have fights, which we have to help out with, something I&#39;m still learning about since we didn&#39;t start out this way... we did AP with the twins (the first 3 months or so they were more or less always latched on), family bed until they were ready to sleep in their own beds & they share a full... <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyone else<br/>
&gt; experiencing twins???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have 2 younger ones (8 and almost 5) and as babies/toddlers they were just different... everyone is pretty close, but the younger 2 were almost like &quot;vacation babies&quot; because there was just one...was easier to move around, could easily wear in a sling, etc... I was able to take my oldest 3 out when the twins were 3, though I PREFERRED having another adult around, but it wasn&#39;t critical...<br/>

<br/>
So you would have a certain toy put away, they didn&#39;t know about it, and<br/>
when you got an identical one, you would pull the other out?  I didn&#39;t quite<br/>
understand that.  Yes, they always want the same thing.  But when they&#39;re<br/>
shopping they always want to pick out something different.  When they&#39;re<br/>
home seeing what the other has, then they want it.  I will say that BG<br/>
picked this out, do you want the same thing.  Usually they have their eye on<br/>
something else.  But after playing for a while they want the other thing.  I<br/>
guess what I see is they are at the same level.  I can&#39;t say to one, you&#39;re<br/>
a little older (8 minutes doesn&#39;t make much difference) and could you do<br/>
this for your little sister.  Frankly, I think I need a clone.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They&#39;re older now & we can negotiate, etc... and they&#39;re very different:<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I like the occasionally they have fights.  As Sandra said being 5 has an<br/>
expiration date.  We figured out AP on our own after our first was born and<br/>
none of my mil&#39;s advice worked very well - let them cry - from the first<br/>
didn&#39;t feel right.  It was harder with the twins.  Also, the younger, BG,<br/>
had a stricture in her esophagaus that wasn&#39;t detected until she was 15 mos.<br/>
She would nurse every hour to hour and a half.  She cried what seemed like<br/>
constantly.  My husband was at work so there was only me.  My older helped a<br/>
lot.  She loves her little sisters.  But it was hard.  Abby, the older one,<br/>
didn&#39;t get the holding and cuddling that her sister did.  BG had 4 surgeries<br/>
to correct the problem.  After that she could actually eat - what a<br/>
difference.  Abby sleeps with Abra (8) usually and BG sleeps with Hannah<br/>
(16).  By morning BG&#39;s usually in my bed.  They did that around the time<br/>
they turned 4.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They are so intense.  When Hannah and Rachael would fight (2 yrs apart) it<br/>
was never with this intensity.  Different personalities too besides the twin<br/>
factor.  My sil with a masters in special education tells me they hold each<br/>
other back.  Being cognitively at the same level the pull each other down<br/>
instead of one pulling the other up.  She was trying to prove they needed to<br/>
be in pre-school.  Seems to me she shot her own theory.  Lol.  But I have to<br/>
admit the dynamics are completely different. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you could just stop treating them like clones.  Instead of  <br/>
justifying your current attitudes, maybe really try out some of the  <br/>
ideas people are suggesting.<br/>
<br/>
The first year I was ever in on unschooling discussions online, when  <br/>
unschooling didn&#39;t have its own places, a mom with twins was  <br/>
bemoaning the &quot;fact&quot; that her children needed to be kept together and  <br/>
neither could have privileges the others didn&#39;t have.  Hers were a  <br/>
boy and a girl, and they were about 8 at the time she wrote.  Her big  <br/>
problem was that the girl liked the English workbooks and wanted to  <br/>
work ahead, but her brother didn&#39;t like them and would rather do math.<br/>
<br/>
She argued against suggestions that she could just let the girl do  <br/>
all the English-workbook she wanted to, and not worry about keeping  <br/>
them &quot;even.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her response was that we had no idea what we were talking about  <br/>
because we didn&#39;t have twins.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known lots of twins, and had twin cousins.  Another cousin grew  <br/>
up with me, and we were within a year of age and in the same grade,  <br/>
and my mom very often bought us matching clothes in different colors  <br/>
(and another smaller matched set for my sister and her sister, who  <br/>
were also in the same grade.<br/>
<br/>
At Christmas, my mom would get all four of us the same gifts.  It  <br/>
wasn&#39;t much fun, because if I saw someone else open an Etch-a-Sketch  <br/>
or a stuffed monkey, I knew I was going to get one too.   That was  <br/>
her solution to the problem of how to figure out how to help us  <br/>
share.  She just didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen how twin situations can be made worse; I&#39;ve seen lots of that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195474265">It occurred to me that parents might have expectations about twins  <br/>
that they wouldn&#39;t have about other siblings - especially in  <br/>
expecting them to share toys and sharing parents&#39; time.<br/>
<br/>
So - maybe too much sharing is being expected and it would be good to  <br/>
try thinking whether you&#39;d expect that kind of sharing if one was 4  <br/>
and the other 6, instead of both being 5.<br/>
