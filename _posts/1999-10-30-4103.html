<div id="ygrps-yiv-185931582">You can find a copy of this song rendered beautifully by Bing Crosby on his Bing Crosby&#39;s Greatest Hits CD, Track 7.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive<br/>
E-lim-minate the negative<br/>
Latch on to the affirmative<br/>
Don&#39;t mess with mister in-between<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve go to spread joy up to the maximum<br/>
Bring gloom down to the minimum<br/>
Have faith or pandemonium<br/>
Liable to walk upon the scene<br/>
<br/>
To illustrate<br/>
His last remark<br/>
Jonah in the whale<br/>
Noah in the Ark<br/>
<br/>
What did they do<br/>
Just when everything looked so dark<br/>
<br/>
Man they said we&#39;d better<br/>
You&#39;ve got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive<br/>
E-lim-minate the negative<br/>
Latch on to the affirmative<br/>
Don&#39;t mess with mister in-between<br/>
<br/>
No, do not mess with mister in-between<br/>
Do you hear me, hum?<br/>
<br/>
Oh listen to me children and you will hear<br/>
About the eliminatin of the negative<br/>
And an accent on the positive<br/>
<br/>
Gather round me children if your willin<br/>
And sit tight while I start reviewin the attitude of doin right<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive<br/>
E-lim-minate the negative<br/>
Latch on to the affirmative<br/>
Don&#39;t mess with mister in-between<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve go to spread joy up to the maximum<br/>
Bring gloom down to the minimum<br/>
Otherwise pandemonium<br/>
Liable to walk upon the scene<br/>
<br/>
To illustrate (illustrate)<br/>
My last remark (you&#39;ve got the floor)<br/>
Jonah in the whale<br/>
Noah in the Ark<br/>
<br/>
What did they do<br/>
Just when everything looked so dark<br/>
<br/>
Man they said we&#39;d better<br/>
You&#39;ve got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive<br/>
E-lim-minate the negative<br/>
Latch on to the affirmative<br/>
Don&#39;t mess with mister in-between<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t mess with mister in-between<br/>
