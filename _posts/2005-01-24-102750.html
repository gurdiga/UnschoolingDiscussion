<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189894614">Somebody wrote in asking about activities for snow days-<br/>
Just an idea I came up with recently that you may find helpful:<br/>
<br/>
On the snow days that are entirely too cold for the children to go outside, <br/>
or even when it is too dark outside we bring buckets of snow inside. We put <br/>
the snow into the bathtub and allow the children to sit on the outside. <br/>
Reaching into the tub they can use their action figures, trucks, barbies,or <br/>
other misc. toys to play in the snow. When they are finished playing the <br/>
snow runs down the drain and leaves very little clean up. (We have also <br/>
allowed the children to make and throw a couple of snowballs at the shower <br/>
wall)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597882691">This reminded me that when the kids were little and we were stir crazy, I<br/>
used to bring the kiddie pool inside and fill it with warm water in the<br/>
middle of the kitchen floor.  We&#39;d have a beach party complete with<br/>
sunglasses, swim suits, a picnic, etc.  The pool had a little slide on it<br/>
and the kids would have a blast.  I just put lots of towels on the floor and<br/>
threw them in the washer after.  The floor got clean and the kids had a<br/>
blast.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Other times we would just do the same for the barbies, but with a large pot<br/>
of water instead of a pool.  The kids always loved to play in water like<br/>
that.  It entertained them for hours.<br/>
