<div id="ygrps-yiv-884146593">Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Today my dd asked me,&quot; If a penny is a penny and a dollar is a dollar,<br/>
why isn&#39;t Canadian money worth as much as ours?&quot;  I have to admit, I was<br/>
uncertain of the exact reasons, and definitely couldn&#39;t put what I do<br/>
know into simple enough terms for a ten-yr old.  Does anyone know a good<br/>
children&#39;s book that might explain?  I seem to recall some really good<br/>
links, recently on one of these lists, that dealt with money, numbers<br/>
and even economics.  Does anyone have those still?  Would you mind<br/>
sending them again?  TIA.<br/>
