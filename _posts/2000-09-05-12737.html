Dr. John Hagelin is a Harvard-trained quantum physicist; Director of the<br/>
Institute of<br/>
Science, Technology and Public Policy; and Reform Party and Natural Law<br/>
Party<br/>
presidential candidate, who has worked for decades to promote public<br/>
policies in<br/>
health care, education, energy and the environment, crime, defense, etc.,<br/>
that are<br/>
prevention-oriented, scientifically proven, and in accord with natural law.<br/>
The following<br/>
are excerpts from an interview with Dr. Hagelin in which he describes his<br/>
solutions to<br/>
many of America&#39;s critical problems and his vision of a forward-looking,<br/>
healthy, and<br/>
prosperous nation.<br/>
<br/>
Strengthening education: &quot;As Americans, we pride ourselves on our<br/>
educational<br/>
opportunities. But the fact is, education is not working. Even though we<br/>
spend more<br/>
money per student than any other country, our students still rank far behind<br/>
most of<br/>
their international peers in math and science-and well behind U.S. test<br/>
scores of 20<br/>
years ago. I would promote proven educational programs that directly<br/>
increase<br/>
intelligence and creativity and simultaneously improve moral reasoning,<br/>
self-reliance,<br/>
and mental and physical health and well-being. These programs include sound<br/>
approaches to nutrition; natural, preventive health education; effective<br/>
drug prevention;<br/>
and innovative curriculum development, including programs to develop the<br/>
full mental<br/>
potential of students.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 John Hagelin is a powerful national voice for campaign and election law<br/>
reforms that<br/>
will open the political process to new ideas, new solutions and new<br/>
leadership for the<br/>
new millennium.<br/>
    Protecting health care: &quot;Too many Americans suffer from poor health. We<br/>
endure<br/>
some of the worst health statistics of all the industrialized nations, yet<br/>
we have the<br/>
highest per capita health costs of any nation. Why? The answer is that our<br/>
health care<br/>
system is really a disease care system. It focuses on the management of<br/>
illness<br/>
rather than on the prevention of disease and the promotion of health. Recent<br/>
research<br/>
shows that 50% of deaths and 70% of disease in America are<br/>
self-inflicted-caused<br/>
by an epidemic of unhealthy habits. Yet we spend only 1% of our health care<br/>
dollars<br/>
on prevention. I would support cost-effective, prevention-oriented health<br/>
care programs<br/>
that have been scientifically shown to prevent disease and save money in the<br/>
best<br/>
possible way-by keeping people healthy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Safeguarding our food supply: &quot;Current agricultural practices erode and<br/>
degrade our<br/>
precious topsoil. These practices require large-scale use of of chemical<br/>
pesticides and<br/>
fertilizers that pollute our groundwater and are unhealthy for consumers and<br/>
farmers. In<br/>
contrast, I support sustainable, organic agricultural practices proven to<br/>
produce<br/>
healthy, high-quality food without hazardous chemical fertilizers and<br/>
pesticides. These<br/>
practices will preserve our environment and our agricultural economy for<br/>
future<br/>
generations.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Moratorium on genetically engineered food: &quot;Given the far-reaching<br/>
ecological and<br/>
health risks posed by genetic engineering, I would support a moratorium on<br/>
the<br/>
commercialization of genetically engineered foods and their release into the<br/>
environment until the safety of such organisms can be firmly established. In<br/>
addition,<br/>
to protect the public&#39;s right to know, I would enforce mandatory labeling of<br/>
genetically<br/>
engineered foods.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 John Hagelin speaks to millions of people through media interviews that<br/>
highlight his<br/>
proven, forward-looking, prevention-oriented solutions.<br/>
    Ensuring a strong economy: &quot;In today&#39;s information-based economy,<br/>
intelligence<br/>
and creativity-innovation and ideas-drive economic growth. Clearly,<br/>
America&#39;s most<br/>
precious natural resource is our human resource-the unlimited creative<br/>
potential of<br/>
our 270 million citizens. Given today&#39;s low test scores and high dropout<br/>
rates, I believe<br/>
that the most crucial economic strategy that government can adopt is to<br/>
harness<br/>
America&#39;s untapped creativity. So, in addition to my powerful, pro-growth<br/>
tax and fiscal<br/>
policies, I would support proven education, job training and apprenticeship<br/>
programs<br/>
that develop intelligence and creativity and prevent school dropouts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Promoting balanced trade: &quot;Trade is vital to a thriving U.S. economy. Trade<br/>
stimulates<br/>
competition that gives American consumers more choices, better product<br/>
quality, and<br/>
lower prices. Especially today, with America leading the global information<br/>
revolution-the largest technological and economic explosion in history-it is<br/>
vitally<br/>
important to U.S. jobs and the economy that we achieve broad access to the<br/>
international marketplace with American products. Unfortunately, as in other<br/>
areas of<br/>
U.S. government policy, our trade policies are dictated by special<br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Current trade policies<br/>
<br/>
leave American workers and businesses at an unfair disadvantage;<br/>
threaten our environment;<br/>
undermine U.S. sovereignty and that of other nations; and<br/>
promote human rights violations.<br/>
&quot;I support a balanced, tailored trade program that<br/>
<br/>
promotes the economic welfare of all our citizens;<br/>
provides markets for our domestic small businesses;<br/>
safeguards American employment and labor standards-and upholds our ban on<br/>
the<br/>
import of products of child and slave labor; and<br/>
ensures that imported goods meet our environmental and product safety<br/>
standards.<br/>
&quot;Our crucial trade treaties, such as NAFTA, must be revisited and vigorously<br/>
renegotiated-with adequate representation by labor, environmental, and human<br/>
rights<br/>
proponents to ensure that America&#39;s interests are truly upheld. In<br/>
particular, the World<br/>
Trade Organization (WTO), with its sweeping authority to adjudicate<br/>
international trade<br/>
disputes, has become a tool of multinational corporations, which have inside<br/>
access to<br/>
WTO negotiations that typically occur in secret. I would give the WTO twelve<br/>
months<br/>
to adopt more open, democratic procedures-with adequate labor, environmental<br/>
and<br/>
human rights input-or I would withdraw the U.S. from the WTO and negotiate<br/>
individual, tailored trade relationships with our various trade partners.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Preventing crime: &quot;Our young people are 12 times more likely to die by<br/>
gunfire than<br/>
their peers in other nations. We have the highest percentage of our citizens<br/>
in jail of<br/>
any nation in the world. Clearly, our &#39;get-tough&#39; policy, focusing on new<br/>
prison<br/>
construction and stiffer sentencing, is not enough. Effective crime<br/>
prevention is also<br/>
crucial. That is why I support a truly comprehensive, field-tested,<br/>
scientifically proven<br/>
strategy, including effective prison rehabilitation and reducing societal<br/>
stress, to<br/>
prevent and reduce crime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Protecting the environment: &quot;I am committed to increasing both energy<br/>
efficiency and<br/>
the use of renewable, safe, and nonpolluting energy sources, such as wind,<br/>
solar, and<br/>
biomass. This approach will protect our environment, create energy<br/>
self-sufficiency,<br/>
and add to the economic prosperity of the nation. Through programs that will<br/>
create<br/>
new jobs and new industries in energy conservation and renewable energy<br/>
sources, I<br/>
will move away from our hazardous and wasteful dependence on fossil fuels,<br/>
while<br/>
saving the nation hundreds of billions of dollars in health and<br/>
environmental costs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lowering taxes: &quot;The most powerful fiscal action our government can take to<br/>
stimulate<br/>
the economy is to lower taxes. I will cut taxes deeply-and<br/>
responsibly-without<br/>
adding to the deficit or cutting essential services. Many presidential<br/>
candidates have<br/>
promised lower taxes, but they have been unable to fulfill their promises<br/>
due to the<br/>
cost and complexity of problems faced by government. Through my<br/>
cost-effective<br/>
solutions to crime, spiraling health costs, and other social problems, I can<br/>
save the<br/>
nation hundreds of billions of dollars annually. I also support the<br/>
simplification and<br/>
overhaul of our tax structure, thereby eliminating corporate welfare and<br/>
special interest<br/>
control of our convoluted tax code. On that basis, I can offer a realistic<br/>
strategy for<br/>
significant tax reduction that protects the integrity of our important<br/>
social programs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ending special interest control: &quot;The election process is far too long and<br/>
expensive.<br/>
Elected representatives spend too much of their terms fundraising and<br/>
campaigning for<br/>
reelection. We have the longest campaign season, yet the lowest voter<br/>
turnout, of any<br/>
democracy in the world. The exorbitant cost of campaigns favors wealthy<br/>
candidates<br/>
and those who receive large contributions from political action committees<br/>
(PACs) and<br/>
other special interest groups. Research has shown that 90% of all campaigns<br/>
are won<br/>
by the candidate who spends the most. Consequently, government has become a<br/>
competition for money and thus is hostage to special interests rather than<br/>
responsive<br/>
to the people. I will promote crucial democratic reform, including (1)<br/>
public sponsorship<br/>
of election campaigns, (2) elimination of PACs and &#39;soft money,&#39; and (3)<br/>
prevention of<br/>
lobbying by former public servants on behalf of domestic and foreign<br/>
interests.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
John Hagelin is forging the largest third-party coalition in U.S. history<br/>
and giving Americans across the country a reason to vote in the 2000<br/>
election.<br/>
<br/>
    Foreign policy: &quot;Two thirds of U.S. foreign aid is military aid. I would<br/>
create an<br/>
immediate shift away from the export of weapons-the U.S. is one of the<br/>
largest arms<br/>
dealers in the world-toward a more life-supporting policy based on the<br/>
export of U.S.<br/>
know-how. American expertise and technical assistance in such critical areas<br/>
as<br/>
business, entrepreneurship, education, sustainable agriculture, and<br/>
environmental<br/>
technologies, supplemented where necessary with economic support, should<br/>
replace<br/>
military aid as our principal instrument of U.S. foreign policy. Such a<br/>
foreign policy will<br/>
allow many developing countries to become financially self-sufficient, help<br/>
to eliminate<br/>
hunger and poverty, and contribute to a flourishing global trade in a more<br/>
prosperous<br/>
and harmonious family of nations.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 John Hagelin will have the endorsement of as many as 2000 dynamic Natural<br/>
Law<br/>
Party candidates for federal, state and local offices on the ballot in 50<br/>
states who will<br/>
fight heart and soul for the ideas we all believe in.<br/>
    Developing consciousness: &quot;The full development of human potential is<br/>
the<br/>
cornerstone of my platform. This is because, in the final analysis,<br/>
America&#39;s problems<br/>
are human problems-crime, domestic violence, drug dependency, and declining<br/>
health in the face of an epidemic of unhealthy habits. The way to uplift<br/>
human behavior<br/>
is not through legislation regulating the details of our lives. You can&#39;t<br/>
have police in<br/>
every home, playground, business, and classroom. Instead, the way to elevate<br/>
human<br/>
behavior is through education that expands creativity and intelligence and<br/>
brings broad<br/>
comprehension, and that harnesses America&#39;s most precious resource-our human<br/>
resource-bringing national life into harmony with natural law. This will<br/>
empower<br/>
people to govern their own lives better, so they create fewer mistakes and<br/>
fewer<br/>
problems for themselves and others, and lead healthier, more productive,<br/>
more<br/>
satisfying lives.&quot;</div>
