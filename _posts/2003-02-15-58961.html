YOu might check out www.unschooling.com .  There is a folder there (I forget what its called) about homeschooling across the country.<br/>
<br/>
You might be able to find a state specific unschooling list there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You could stick it out a couple of days! We do really discuss unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You could try the HEM-Unschooling list (also on Yahoo). It&#39;s been very quiet<br/>
but if you ask a question it will perk up. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Even better are the message boards at Unschooling.com<br/>
(http://www.unschooling.com).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge unschooling list at Yahoo (called Unschooling I think) but<br/>
it&#39;s moderated (that is all messages must be preapproved) so it&#39;s very slow.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can type unschooling into Yahoo and see what turns up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Pam,<br/>
Have you tried www.unschooling.com? Read the articles, read the message <br/>
boards. There&#39;s lots of great info there.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any questions that I might be able to answer before you go? Ask <br/>
PLEASE. I too would love to change the flow of the current discourse.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
