<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133714716">I hope this is an OK question to ask here.  Here is the short question: Any<br/>
advice on helping a 10yo kid with motion sickness tendencies better endure a<br/>
4 hour car ride?  We have tried Dramamine (sort of works, but puts her out<br/>

Here is some related stuff that I&#39;m thinking about.  This same daughter<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to go in elevators.  Not much of a problem, as there aren&#39;t<br/>
very many in our community, and the few that we do have are in short<br/>
buildings, so taking the stairs is a reasonable option.  Dd told gramma (my<br/>
mom) that she has a phobia about elevators.  (Dd learned that a fear of<br/>
something is called a phobia, and so she did use the term to refer to her<br/>
dislike of elevators, but has certainly never been to a psychologist for<br/>
diagnosis of this!)  My mom, who has a background in psychiatric nursing,<br/>
told me that I need to force her to go in elevators, because that is the<br/>
only way she will overcome this &quot;phobia&quot;.  Allowing her to avoid elevators<br/>
will only make it worse, she says.  My mom referred to her own &quot;phobia&quot; of<br/>
driving on the freeway.  She avoided the freeway for years, until finally<br/>
she needed to go some places that were nearly impossible without freeway<br/>
driving.  She drives the freeway regularly now, though she still is<br/>
uncomfortable with it.  I pointed out that when she finally wanted to bad<br/>
enough, then she was able to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight at dinner, dh asked if we want to go with him this weekend to visit<br/>
Gramma, a 4 hour car ride.  Lisa had tears in her eyes and said she doesn&#39;t<br/>
like the car ride.  My recent conversation with my mom about the elevator<br/>
&quot;phobia&quot; came to mind, even though I thought my moms concerns were<br/>
overblown.  Everyone else in the family would like to go on the trip.  Lisa<br/>
would like to see Gramma, but doesn&#39;t want to have to go in the car to see<br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to consider any thoughts that anyone is willing to share on this<br/>
issue.  She doesn&#39;t always get sick, but I know that trips are stressful for<br/>
her because she does worry about it.  I also know that &quot;feeling&quot; carsick,<br/>
even if you don&#39;t get sick, is NO FUN!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920401241">Here&#39;s what works with me and my family.<br/>
<br/>
1. something salty to eat.<br/>
2. DON&#39;T READ this makes it worse. Probably it is best if she can close her<br/>
eyes and listen to a tape with headphones on.<br/>
3. Frequent breaks to walk about and get some fresh air. (every hour or even<br/>
less if possible.)<br/>
4. Ginger helps some people with nausea.<br/>
<br/>
and here is a website full of different ideas...<br/>
<br/>
good luck!!!!<br/>

Just a thought....but could it be a phobia of confined spaces? I don&#39;t<br/>
have any experience with motion sickness, but fresh air helps immensely<br/>
with claustrophobia. Even if you just crack the window open slightly it<br/>
might help. Ask her to take deep breaths if she starts feeling queasy.<br/>
Also, things to keep her mind off the fact that she is inside a 4&#39;x6&#39;<br/>
box, like a magna doodle, dry wipe markers and board, a sewing project,<br/>
etc. I, personally, get a ton of crocheting done while on the road.&lt;g&gt; As<br/>
far as &quot;forcing her to face fears&quot;, been there, done that, didn&#39;t work.<br/>
You just find ways around it.<br/>

bottle.  It works great for one of my kids who is also prone to getting <br/>
carsick.  She might also benefit from some homeopathic aconite for fears and <br/>
uneasiness relating to elevators or car rides.  I took it when I had to fly <br/>

Actually, Sierra use to get very car sick and those things did help her. <br/>
Well not sewing but Magna Doodle and similar things. Just keeping her busy <br/>
in the car and not having her look out the window worked. Poor thing would <br/>
look just awful until we figured out what worked. Even bringing her people <br/>
in the van worked. As long as her mind was occupied and she didn&#39;t watch <br/>
outside she was fine. Still is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917137794">My son (8) and I both suffer from motion sickness. Chewable, <br/>
non-drowsy Dramamine is effective for us, and we absolutely <br/>
swear by ginger. (Remember your mom giving you ginger ale <br/>
when you felt sick?) I keep crystalized ginger in my purse to <br/>
nibble, and if you can find ginger beer (stronger than ginger ale), <br/>
that helps also. Something salty, like crackers or pretzels, along <br/>
with ginger beer or cold water to sip. Neither one of us can look <br/>
at anything such as a book, toy, map, etc. Focusing out the front <br/>
window, not the side, and window cracked. Audios are good, as <br/>
is conversation. Anything that requires looking down is <br/>
nauseating. Sitting in the center of the back seat helps, if that is <br/>
possible.<br/>

claustrophobia.  Focusing on anything *inside* or to the side of the car is<br/>
almost a recipe for car-sickness in someone so disposed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739805483">Reading or looking at anything other than where we&#39;re headed makes me sick.  <br/>
Turning around or even sideways to help the kids with something can make me <br/>
sick, so you might want to suggest not squirming too much.  (Remember those <br/>
frequent stops!)  I do remember being comfortable in the car as a kid, lying <br/>
down across the back seat looking out the window and seeing only sky and <br/>
telephone poles go by.  (And I did leave my seatbelt on...but it was a lap <br/>
belt.)<br/>
<br/>
I feel so lucky that neither kid is massively prone to carsickness, since my <br/>
husband and I both are.  I still have an aversion to long cars trips.  I <br/>
can&#39;t believe my parents drove us around as much as they did.  I remember my <br/>
mom stocking the back seat with two coffee cans, one for me and one for my <br/>
bro to barf in.<br/>

in the car and elevators. I made suggestions referring to things that<br/>

get carsick for different reasons, and not every remedy helps every<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-108081188"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hey Mary Ellen.......<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a really interesting new book out called Carschooling  by Dianne <br/>
Flynn Keith.  She addresses car sickness and states that it is caused <br/>
because &quot;information fed to the brain from the eyes and from the inner ear <br/>
is out of synch.  In a car, passengers (especially those in the backseat) <br/>
may not be looking at the horizon ahead, so their eyes don&#39;t register the <br/>
movement even though the liquid in their inner ear is being stimulated by <br/>
the movement of the car.  The eyes tell the brain there is no movement, but <br/>
the inner ear relays the opposite message.   The conflicting information to <br/>
the brain results in nausea for those especially sensitive to the <br/>
mismatched cues.&quot; (This may explain elevators....ear can tell movement, not <br/>
the eye...My daughter has severe ear canal scarring from ear infections and <br/>
gets car sick, air sick and also doesn&#39;t like elevators)<br/>
<br/>
Her suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;1) Sit where there is an unobstructed view of the outside horizon: the <br/>
front seat is ideal.  Looking outside side windows is not as effective and <br/>
may exacerbate the problem.<br/>
<br/>
2) Never read or draw in the car.  It takes your gaze off the horizon, <br/>
causing the eyes to not measure movement, in opposition to the inner ear, <br/>
which detects movement, resulting in nausea.  (See note below re videos <br/>
etc.  I think if you can get them really involved in something long term, <br/>
versus short term like reading or drawing where they might be looking down <br/>
one minute and then up the next, that this may be a different case.)<br/>
<br/>
3) Roll the window down. [Fresh air will help]<br/>
<br/>
4). Stop regularly.  (She suggests up to every 10-15 minutes!!)<br/>
<br/>
5)  Eat a light meal before.  Avoid greasy, fatty, heavy foods and meals <br/>
like burgers and fries.  Try saltines or apple slices.  Popsicles may <br/>
soothe upset tummies.<br/>
<br/>
6) Drink water.  Avoid acidic beverages like orange juice.  Sipping coke <br/>
will help settle the stomach--in fact, you can purchase straight Coke syrup <br/>
from pharmacies for this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
7) Eliminate strong odors from the car environment as much as possible.  Do <br/>
not wear perfume in the car.  No smoking in the car.  Try to avoid <br/>
congested areas where car/truck/bus exhaust fumes are prevalent.<br/>
<br/>
8)  Try the wrist bands...(which you did)<br/>
<br/>
9)  Try over-the-counter motion sickness pills such as Dramamine or <br/>
Bonine.  Some cause drowsiness.<br/>
<br/>
10) Try ginger.  Chinese sailors used ginger to quell sea sickness and <br/>
scientists have confirmed its effectiveness.  Capsules with dried ginger <br/>
inside or dried ginger chips can be purchased in health food <br/>
stores.  Candied ginger, ginger snap cookies and real ginger ale have also <br/>
been shown to be effective.&quot;<br/>

Activities That Don&#39;t Make You Car Sick<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Listen to music<br/>
<br/>
Listen to books and short stories on tape.<br/>
<br/>
Focus on games that require players to look out the window to find the <br/>
funniest, strangest, bluest (or whatever) bumper sticker, car, billboard, <br/>
or some object.  Having fun while learning at the same time may help to <br/>
take some passengers&#39; minds off car sickness.<br/>
<br/>
Sing songs<br/>
<br/>
Play I Spy, 20 Questions, and other word/talking games.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(My daughter uses her personal CD player with her head phones, or we take <br/>
along our AC/DC 9&quot; color TV/VCR for the long trips with the headphones and <br/>
the kids (2) watch movies.  It has been the one thing she can do and not <br/>
have a problem.  Books on tape work marvelous for us too though, and keep <br/>
the driver entertained, especially the Harry Potter ones!)<br/>
