&lt;&lt; Also, I took the book I was currently reading with me to the dentist and <br/>
you <br/>
 can&#39;t (well, you probably can) believe the criticism I got and the comments. <br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have a teaching degree?&quot;  &quot;I could never take on the <br/>
 challenge&quot;, etc., etc.  Anyway, I congratulate all of you for doing the work <br/>
 you are doing and sticking with it -- I sense it is going to be yet another <br/>
 battle of wills within my family and around my circle of friends (many of <br/>
 whom are teachers -- great!).<br/>
<br/>
** Unsolicited advice -- ignore, ignore, ignore.  Smile and ignore.  They <br/>
will wonder why you are so darn happy and what you are up to! ****<br/>
<br/>
** Also, I was tremendously suprised by the reaction of my one teacher <br/>
relative -- one of my SILs.  She was completely supportive!!  The only neg I <br/>
got was from my Mom at first.  Then I answered a few questions she had and <br/>
she started volunteering in a 1st grade class at a local ps (the one I went <br/>
to as a girl -- eons ago!).  Anyway -- she&#39;s all for it now!! **<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 One question I have does not relate directly to homeschooling but will <br/>
 probably make or break my decision -- how do you deal with behavior issues?  <br/>
 I&#39;m talking about your day to day tantrums and non responsive behavior?  My <br/>
 dd is 3yo and my ds is only 7mo but I feel like I&#39;m on a roller coaster with <br/>
 my daughter&#39;s behavior and not sure how to deal with all the conflicts.  I <br/>
 have read many books but nothing seems to click for her (or me).  I do NOT <br/>
 believe in any type of physical correction (hitting, smacking, flicking, <br/>
 etc.).  If anyone has suggestions on books to read or websites, or lists, <br/>
 please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
**LOL -- sounds pretty normal to me.  Hsing or not you are going to have <br/>
THOSE days.  At least you won&#39;t be tired out from school stuff on top of <br/>
everything else! **<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 Lastly (I think!) I was very interested in the posts about the reading, <br/>
 spelling, etc.  My dd always wants to know what letters start which words <br/>
and <br/>
 will constantly aske me &quot;what does ________ start with?&quot;  She too wants to <br/>
 learn how to write the letters and I&#39;m not sure if there is a specific <br/>
format <br/>
 or method that I should look into about making sure I teach her how to <br/>
 correctly write the letters (or is this even necessary).  I find myself <br/>
 writing the letters and then wondering if I&#39;m doing it right!!  Also, she is <br/>
 the ONLY person in my whole family that is left handed but she has no <br/>
problem <br/>
 following my hand when she watches me write the letters -- I thought that <br/>
was <br/>
 sooo neat!<br/>
<br/>
**There are a lot of &quot;methods.&quot;  I&#39;m sure you will get suggestions.  But  . . <br/>
 is your handwriting legible?  If so, that sounds good enough to me!**<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 BTW, thanks for allowing me to be a part of this list -- I THOROUGHLY enjoy <br/>
 the insight and information regarding homeshcooling in general and <br/>
 unschooling specifically.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi 
Michelle,&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 3 kids-- my oldest will soon be 6, my second oldest 
is 3 1/2, and my youngest&nbsp; is 11 mos.&nbsp; I have found that kids at the 
age of 3 can be very challenging.&nbsp; Now I have one who has gone through that 
age and stage, and one that is in the midsts of it.&nbsp; From my experience I 
can tell you that &quot;this ,too,shall pass&quot;.&nbsp; My older child is sooo much 
easier now in regard to being able to reason better.&nbsp; He can verbalize 
things better, too, which helps alleviate some tantrum causing 
frustration.&nbsp; Hang in there-- I would caution you about making a decision 
about home/unschooling based&nbsp; upon the current ages of your children.&nbsp; 
A couple of years from now your daughter may well be out of the tantrum stage, 
so be patient... time is on your side!&nbsp; ~Karen in IND</font></em></div>

<br/>
This might not be as big of a problem as you think.  My sister, Michele, who <br/>
is also in DE, is one of our biggest supporters!  My SIL, who is also a <br/>
teacher, on the other hand...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As far as your behavior issues go, it sounds like your kids are the same age <br/>
difference as mine (2yrs, 6wks) and I remember what my son was like at 3!  <br/>
WOW!!  I was ready to call social services to have this kid evaluated.  I <br/>
really thought that he had some kind of &quot;disorder&quot;  He grew out of it and as <br/>
I reflect, I really think that it had to do with him dealing with his anger <br/>
over his new sibling.  I honestly don&#39;t think the jealously really hit until <br/>
she showed signs of being a &quot;person&quot;.  I know that isn&#39;t much help.  I think <br/>
that we ended up using a lot of time outs in his room.  I know that we also <br/>
tried to get a Mommy and me night out, so he could have me to himself once <br/>
in a while.  There are several great books.  &quot;How to Talk So Kids Can Listen <br/>
and Listen So Kids Can Talk&quot; is a great book.  Also, &quot;Positive Discipline <br/>
from A to Z&quot; is nice, because it is referenced alphabetically by behavior, <br/>
so if you are really stressed and your brain is taxed, you can go lock <br/>
yourself in the bathroom and do some reading!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dd who is also 3, is really interested in writing her letters.  I have <br/>
found these little notebooks that Crayola make that give them a line of the <br/>
letter with a solid line, then dotted and then four lines underneath for <br/>
them to practice.  She really likes this book and will ask to write her <br/>
letters.  She is very independent and prefers that I don&#39;t show her how to <br/>
do anything.  Funny my son, who is 5, is also left-handed.  Only a few aunts <br/>
on either side are...<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, Michele, looking forward to having you here.<br/>

thought of them as indications that people just didn&#39;t understand how <br/>
homeschooling works (although I don&#39;t necessarily take it upon myself to <br/>
education them).  Actually, at one time, I would have been the one to make <br/>
comments like that (and probably did!!)<br/>

suggest that you look for homeschool support groups in your vicinity.  Can we <br/>
help you find one?<br/>

book of the same name by Foster Cline and Jim Fay.  Are you familiar with it? <br/>
 I&#39;ll be happy to discuss it with you if you&#39;d like to e-mail me off-list.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;  correctly write the letters (or is this even necessary).  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son writes many of his letters from the bottom up.  Why?  I have no idea.  <br/>
I remind him that it&#39;s really more efficient and easier to write them from <br/>
the top down, but that just doesn&#39;t work for him.  In the end, does he get <br/>
him message across?  Yes.  I also read recently that many children print <br/>
faster than they write cursive, and with the availablilty of computers, <br/>
neither printing nor cursive is as critical as it once was.  So I&#39;d say there <br/>
is no &quot;right&quot; way.  I figure, it there were, we&#39;d all have the same <br/>
handwriting.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
