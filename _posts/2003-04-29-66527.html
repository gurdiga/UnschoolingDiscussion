<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216912565">I&#39;ve been on no-mail on this list for a while (what was I thinking lol) but <br/>
just went to digest.<br/>
<br/>
My 14 yr old son is frustrated with his ability to spell.  Or lack thereof.  <br/>
It slows him down if he wants to write something or type in a cheat code on <br/>
the computer or nintendo.  I have always just spelled any word he asked me <br/>
about.  <br/>
<br/>
I showed him the 2 spelling books I had and said I&#39;d help him or he could do <br/>
it on his own, but he doesn&#39;t seem to want to do either.  He reads alot <br/>
(which supposedly helps with spelling) and I have noticed he has learned to <br/>
spell easy words on his own over time.  Recently he said he just wishes I <br/>
would or had just made him do spelling in the past.  Huh?  I&#39;ll help him but <br/>
not make him!  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941869345">My dh is an attrocious (sp) speller. I am always teasing him, the latest is my Easter card in which he wrote &quot;As tim goes by, I love you more.&quot; The tim is supposed to be time so now everytime I am wondering what time is is I ask him what tim it is:) He laughs about it and it has been a running joke but thank God for spell check he often doesn&#39;t need it anyway. DD #1 doesn&#39;t really need it too much either. I think I read in some of my graduate work that spelling is one of those things that you either are good at or not. Gary (dh) is definitely not, but he sure can do a lot of other things great! Good luck, Kelli<br/>
