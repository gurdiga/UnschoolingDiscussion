<br/>
It may be just skin to you, or me, but it is more than that to a child<br/>
molester. Do you know any child molesters? If you knew a child molester<br/>
lived directly next door to you and could see your back yard from his<br/>
bedroom window, would you still allow your children to run around nude?<br/>
My point is, you just never know, and it&#39;s not that uncommon. I don&#39;t<br/>
think anyone insinuated that a   10yr old girl running around nude was<br/>
trying to solicit child molesters. But on the other hand, would you set a<br/>
drink down in front of an alcoholic who gets violent when he drinks? Or<br/>
give a rapist the keys to your apartment?  It is just common sense to not<br/>
want to aid this kind of behavior. After a crime of this magnitude is<br/>
committed, it doesn&#39;t matter much who&#39;s to blame, does it. Only that the<br/>
crime happened in the first place.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>However, as someone pointed out earlier, sociopathic people are going to <br/>
exhibit sociopathic behavior regardless of what we do or do not do to <br/>
protect ourselves.  I, for one, choose not to operate in fear-mode.  It has <br/>
been very important to me to give my son the freedom to enjoy the freedoms <br/>
of childhood without having to fear others or feel shame about his <br/>
body.  In fact, I think that our society&#39;s discomfort with nudity has a lot <br/>
more to do with shame about our bodies than fear of child molestation <br/>
anyway, although there may be an overlap there to some extent.  I don&#39;t <br/>
really know.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
If both are &quot;to blame,&quot; there wasn&#39;t much of a crime.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s not argue about who killed who...&quot;  (a Monty Python & the Holy Grail <br/>
quote...)<br/>
<br/>
I have discussed with Holly that some males are not used to being around <br/>
women or girls, and some are not very nice guys, so there are some places and <br/>
times she needs to be more careful what she&#39;s wearing, and that some people <br/>
will think if she&#39;s wearing make-up that she&#39;s not a very nice girl.<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
She IS is very nice girl.<br/>
And the people who will think that are fundamentalist Christians.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t tell her that part.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not going to tell her that it&#39;s HER fault if she becomes the victim <br/>
of a crime.  Neither will I encourage her to flaunt or to disregard safety <br/>
and caution.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along in there, each person has a threshhold over which he or she <br/>
is not comfortable.  We&#39;ll never all agree on it.  Kids played naked in our <br/>
back yard (not easily visible from neighbors, but possibly visible by fence <br/>
peeking) until they were five or six, large mixed groups.  Commonly, all <br/>
summer.   Some families would NEVER have allowed it.  Our babysitting co-op <br/>
was a kind of  nudist colony for little kids in those days.   <br/>

for the perpetration of the crime. I don&#39;t believe a child or woman ever<br/>
&quot;asks&quot; to be attacked, or is to be blamed for such a crime.<br/>

anything but a nice girl. Has a Christian actually told you she was not<br/>
because she wore makeup? Sad if that is so. <br/>

Our yard can only be seen with the use of powerful binoculars, or by<br/>

My 3yo is a little nudie who prefers to run and play without clothes. My<br/>
5yo usually prefers clothes. It is up to them, when they are out of<br/>
public view. I think one of the original posts was regarding nude<br/>
children in public places, or places the public can easily see. I don&#39;t<br/>

No. <br/>
Told me about women in general, LOTS.<br/>
And about me? (Not that I wear makeup...)  Yes.<br/>

I don&#39;t either.  But there&#39;s always one more line to cross.  If back yard is <br/>
okay, is unfenced okay?  If so, is side yard okay?  Front yard?  Next door <br/>
neighbor&#39;s front yard?  <br/>
<br/>
If six is too old, is five too old?  Four?<br/>
