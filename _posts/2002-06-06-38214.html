&lt;&lt;  I frankly think the TV is not a good substitute for anything that<br/>
 involves activity. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Who said anyone needs a &quot;substitute&quot; for any activity.? To slam tv, (which is <br/>
just another option) seems like saying &quot;frankly, I don&#39;t think playing <br/>
outside is a good substitute for reading&quot; or something as silly.<br/>
One doesn&#39;t substitute for the other. They are all just options. If you&#39;re <br/>
doing one, you&#39;re missing out on another at that particular moment.<br/>
