Hi Cally --<br/>
 <br/>
My  11 year old daughter was interested in learning electric guitar and keyboards.  We decided to purchase each when we could along with some excellent dvd&#39;s from Homespun Tapes.  A gentle introduction to an interest.  She loves being free to design her own end game, create, and lead her own process.  Interest in learning, and choice are critical.    She will acquire and advance the skills she desires as she deems and is free to request additional resources if she would like them.  It&#39;s ok if she changes course or changes her mind.  I expect she will.  I do it all the time. As a matter of fact, she has morphed by discovering she loves writing songs more than instrument accompaniant to established work....She is in process -- gathering information about herself and her interests and most importantly, how she would like to pursue and express those interests.   There are many ways to explore a thing....I try not to get married to one way or the &quot;right way&quot; and encourage others to do the same.<br/>
 <br/>
It may help those who are advising that your children stick with their lessons to understand the child&#39;s resistance if you frame it in this way ----  Your partner, who loves you dearly, has decided to sign you up for something he believes will be a great learning experience, enrich your life, and hopes you will enjoy  -- all without your consent (?) (could also be with!) In addition to scheduled class time, there is outside class work required to reinforce and progress your developing skills. Even if it was something you initially /always wanted to try -- your time, freedom, preferences, and choice have been, well, kind of hijacked.  You are no longer in control but being led, albeit gently, down a path designed by another even though they may have your best interests at heart.  Although you could love the experience and even be thankful that someone else gifted you with handling the details of the experience, you could also find out that it was not what you expected, not how you wanted to experience or learn the thing, decide that you would like to devote your time to other interests instead...or have a host of other discoveries unique to you (and all valid learning experiences in my book). <br/>
 <br/>
If it happened that you changed your mind about this learning experience that your dear one arranged for you... (or even you arranged for you) I believe your input would be respected by your loved ones who would, of course, ideally honor your feelings, believing only you genuinely know you. People opt out of experiences that do not suit them all the time --jobs, relationships, learning paths, etc. It&#39;s necessary and healthy to grow responsibility for your own well being with confidence in your choices. A child&#39;s choices matter, too. That is how they grow and learn about themselves, their world, their options. Discuss, debate, and discover with them.<br/>
  <br/>
It comes down to trusting, believing, honoring, respecting, talking, and listening to those you care about.  All will discover things, feel things, learn things  -- sometimes differently than expected.  If one requires or forces someone to do something, still, the lesson outcome is up for grabs with a possible dose of resentment thrown in.  <br/>
 <br/>
Learning is always a process, not merely an end game.  I try to find the many possibilities of the journey exciting ,or, at the very least, interesting...and accept that the ending might be different than one I would choose to imagine. Best to you -- Tonia<br/>

My 50th birthday rolled around and I was in for a surprise. We went on  <br/>
a 2 hour drive, ending up down a dirt road with me thinking we were  <br/>
going to look at a vacation cabin or something. It turned out that  <br/>
he&#39;d bought me a Celtic lap harp and we were visiting the harp maker  <br/>
to pick it up! The harp came with an introductory lesson and he had  <br/>
booked that, too. When he told me that this was my surprise, I blurted  <br/>
out &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to do that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had moved past the harp-wanting and was content not to have one. He  <br/>
hadn&#39;t talked about a harp with me in years. I felt a bit blindsided,  <br/>

and finding the right time and place and everything to do this. I felt  <br/>
bad about how I reacted (though it was honest, it wasn&#39;t especially  <br/>
kind). So, I went in and held my harp, enjoyed the lesson and headed  <br/>
home with a beautiful new instrument and a beginner&#39;s CD. I looked  <br/>
into lessons with the harp-builder nearby, but I was also working  <br/>
towards an Editing certificate at university. That occupied my time,  <br/>
but I did go about learning how to play a song on the harp. My husband  <br/>
loved the sound of my playing and I was liking it, too.<br/>
<br/>
We took the harp to my parents&#39; place that year (2006) for Christmas  <br/>
and I made an attempt at playing the new song. My dad said &quot;well,  <br/>
you&#39;re not very good at it, are you?&quot;  I not only stopped playing  <br/>
right there and then, I haven&#39;t picked it up since. I decided, though,  <br/>
that this year *I* wanted to make the decision about learning to play  <br/>
and I&#39;m heading to a harp camp put on by my harp-builder (and fabulous  <br/>

<br/>
So, a number things conspired to make me less than enthusiastic for 4  <br/>
years or so. My husband made a huge assumption about my continuing  <br/>

now and again showed his disappointment that my harp just sat in a  <br/>

<br/>
You should let your kids own the experience, for good or bad.  Don&#39;t nag about <br/>
homework, let them do it or not.<br/>
<br/>
How long have they been out of school?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say the 11 yr old won&#39;t have any problems jumping in.  If the 14 yr old is <br/>
starting out in high school, they&#39;ll likely want to do placement tests and then <br/>
put him in classes according to the level he tests at.  It varies from school to <br/>
school, but for some kids, the bar is set really really low.  The kids that I&#39;ve <br/>
known, in those classes are there because they simply don&#39;t care enough about <br/>
school and school work to do ANYthing, homework, class work, you name it.  Some <br/>
of those kids fail even those classes, so I doubt very much that your son will <br/>
be &quot;behind&quot;.  Even kids who fail over half their classes, even really low level <br/>
classes,  get bumped to the next grade level.  I&#39;ve seen it happen.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids want to be there, then they won&#39;t fail in that manner.  It really <br/>
does make a difference.  Public schooling is no guarantee for passing.  Many <br/>
kids in school have been &quot;prepared&quot; plenty, and still don&#39;t pass.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
use tutors, let them jump in feet first and fully experience it.  They&#39;ll either <br/>
want to stay and deal with the good and the bad of school, or they&#39;ll find that <br/>
being home is better and come home.  Their choice will become one of conviction <br/>
based on experience.<br/>
<br/>
You can support your kids as people even when you don&#39;t like the choices they <br/>
make.  It&#39;s part of living and letting go and letting them grow into the people <br/>
they are and will become.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118528719">-=- As an unschooling Mother, public schools and their<br/>
agendas go against everything I believe in. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I ringed a little at &quot;as an unschooling Mother.&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t know if there can be an unschooling mother without unschooling  <br/>
children.  I&#39;m not tryint to be yucky, just to point out that it  <br/>
should be about the kids, not about what the mom believes.<br/>
<br/>
Belief isn&#39;t really enough.  Somewhere else in the past day or two I  <br/>
saw just in passing a reference to someone thinking her husband would  <br/>
be persuaded that unschooling was a good idea, if only her own belief  <br/>
were stronger.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those is about the action.<br/>
<br/>
But to the main question, it&#39;s likely that the mother&#39;s vision of what  <br/>
would be needed for school is exaggerated.  If he can read, he&#39;ll be  <br/>
okay.  School happens one day at a time, so you can help him if he  <br/>
needs help.  He will get better at writing by writing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What I am most fearful of is the school&#39;s refusal to allow my  <br/>
children to school as &quot;we choose&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The link you mentioned<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
doesn&#39;t talk about changing what the school will do, but choosing how  <br/>
to react to it while you&#39;re at home.<br/>
I brought the link because I don&#39;t want it to be misrepresented, and  <br/>
also because it does seem you&#39;ve misunderstood it.<br/>
<br/>
-=- But if I ask the school to provide tutoring to<br/>
help them reach grade level, will they accuse me and or charge me with<br/>
educational neglect?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they will be &quot;behind grade level.&quot;  I don&#39;t think  <br/>
contacting tutors was the way to go.  I think letting them try it and  <br/>
helping with what they want (which MIGHT be a tutor, after all, but  <br/>
might be nothing) is the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
They might not like school after they try it.  All that tutoring could  <br/>
do the same kind of anti-deschooling that going to school could do.  I  <br/>

School is not about what you believe in.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t just about what you believe in either.  Unschooling  <br/>
is about living a whole different kind of life.<br/>

school this time? -=-<br/>
<br/>
You could see it as something your children want to do.  Not something  <br/>
you&#39;re providing for them; it&#39;s not a thing of your design.  It&#39;s a  <br/>
situation they would like to involve themselves in.  You don&#39;t need  <br/>
&quot;to approach&quot; public school.  The kids could enroll themselves.  Or  <br/>
you could go with them and calmly state that it&#39;s their choice, and  <br/>
you would prefer they stay home.  And them smile.    And soon, leave.   <br/>
Let them do as much of it on their own as they can, maybe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019000573">-=-However I also understand how they feel. Here in &quot;uppercrusted&quot; CT,  <br/>
the<br/>
homeschool group is very small, the activites limited thus his social  <br/>
circle is<br/>
quite small. As he is growing and changing he wants to be around other  <br/>
kids his<br/>
own age. (He went to his first Metal concert this weekend). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Limiting friendships to only other homeschooled kids isn&#39;t necessary,  <br/>
and isn&#39;t usually a great idea.  If he&#39;s interested in music, maybe  <br/>
there are others, who go to school, he could find to hang out with,  <br/>
maybe by going to smaller local concerts.<br/>
<br/>
If activities are limited with the homeschooling group, but if the  <br/>
kids have other interests (gaming, sports, arts, skateboarding...)  <br/>
they can meet other people.   Expecting local homeschoolers, even if  <br/>
there are a TON of them, to provide everything for any unschooler or  <br/>
unschooling family can be a problem, because it&#39;s living in  <br/>
homeschooling world instead of in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
But if the mom doesn&#39;t believe in teaching, hiring a tutor&#39;s probably  <br/>
a bad idea.<br/>
If learning can happen naturally, then those kids can learn what they  <br/>
need to learn to catch up with school mates.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, my son Marty took a GED because he was offered a job he  <br/>
couldn&#39;t accept because they have a strict diploma or GED rule.    <br/>
Without preparing (without taking classes; he did thumb through the  <br/>
booklet, and we read about the essay section one day for about twenty  <br/>
minutes), he passed the first time, at about the 76th percentile  <br/>
(they&#39;re not specific about a single number; could be higher).<br/>
<br/>
If I had &quot;hired tutors&quot; to make sure he passed, it would&#39;ve made him  <br/>
feel that if he passed it was because of the tutoring.<br/>
Many of those who take a GED do take preparation courses.  Some people  <br/>
make a lot of money off providing those, and books.  And most of those  <br/>
those who take GEDs did go to school in the first place.   Marty  <br/>
didn&#39;t do the 76th percentile among unschoolers, but among whatever  <br/>
the randomish population of people who did go to school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383383041">***However we live in an area where the <br/>
schools push the kids so the schools rate well.***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about the school&#39;s view of itself.  I believe you can take the guess work <br/>
out of that by looking at the department of education&#39;s website and see for <br/>
yourself how the school rates.  Even if you happen to live in a &quot;stepford&quot; <br/>
community, it doesn&#39;t mean that all kids come from your neighborhood and feed <br/>
into that school.  <br/>
<br/>
On the upside, if you do live in a more affluent neighborhood, the school <br/>
probably has all the bells and whistles that some schools have.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the laws where you live, but have you looked to see if homeschooled <br/>
kids can participate in extra curricular activities?  That might satisfy their <br/>

<br/>
I talked to a girl extensively at the bookstore once, random stranger.  She had <br/>
just taken her GED to get into college early.  From her experience, doing all <br/>
the prep work for a GED and the practice test, was harder than the actual test. <br/>
 She felt anxiety over it for over a month, about how difficult it must be to do <br/>
all this preparation for it.  She even said the practice test was actually <br/>
harder than the real test.  She said she did better on the practice test than <br/>
the actual test because of finality of it.  That made sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille has been talking about doing the GED.  I think the best thing she could <br/>
do for preparation would be to go online and do a few practice tests to get a <br/>
feel for it.  I&#39;m in no hurry and neither is she.  If she suddenly decided to go <br/>
to school, I&#39;d let her go without any prep work and let her be placed where she <br/>
gets placed.  She&#39;d probably be in some advanced classes and some remedial ones, <br/>
just like most students.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52610794">ONE VERY IMPORTANT FACT I LEFT OUT:<br/>
<br/>
My son is Bi-Polar. He cannot handle stress.  In fifth grade, my bright child <br/>
was humiliated by a teacher known for singling out a child and humiliating him, <br/>
and punishing them for the year.  My son was that child.<br/>
He was not diagnosed then (and I use that term VERY loosely). She stood over him <br/>
with a stop watch until he finished his multiplication tables in two minutes.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  <br/>
-=- As an unschooling Mother, public schools and their<br/>
agendas go against everything I believe in. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I ringed a little at &quot;as an unschooling Mother.&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t know if there can be an unschooling mother without unschooling <br/>
children.  I&#39;m not tryint to be yucky, just to point out that it <br/>
should be about the kids, not about what the mom believes.<br/>
<br/>
Belief isn&#39;t really enough.  Somewhere else in the past day or two I <br/>
saw just in passing a reference to someone thinking her husband would <br/>
be persuaded that unschooling was a good idea, if only her own belief <br/>
were stronger.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those is about the action.<br/>
<br/>
But to the main question, it&#39;s likely that the mother&#39;s vision of what <br/>
would be needed for school is exaggerated.  If he can read, he&#39;ll be <br/>
okay.  School happens one day at a time, so you can help him if he <br/>
needs help.  He will get better at writing by writing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What I am most fearful of is the school&#39;s refusal to allow my <br/>
children to school as &quot;we choose&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The link you mentioned<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
doesn&#39;t talk about changing what the school will do, but choosing how <br/>
to react to it while you&#39;re at home.<br/>
I brought the link because I don&#39;t want it to be misrepresented, and <br/>
also because it does seem you&#39;ve misunderstood it.<br/>
<br/>
-=- But if I ask the school to provide tutoring to<br/>
help them reach grade level, will they accuse me and or charge me with<br/>
educational neglect?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they will be &quot;behind grade level.&quot;  I don&#39;t think <br/>
contacting tutors was the way to go.  I think letting them try it and <br/>
helping with what they want (which MIGHT be a tutor, after all, but <br/>
might be nothing) is the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
They might not like school after they try it.  All that tutoring could <br/>
do the same kind of anti-deschooling that going to school could do.  I <br/>
would first see whether school lasts.<br/>
<br/>
A story was told at HSC this weekend about a young teen who chose to <br/>
go to school and lasted five days.<br/>

Yes there is.  And yes these years were in court and fighting.  We are finally <br/>
in a place to relax, be at peace and now are finally receiving some child <br/>
support. We are now in a position to take some trips.  We went to Washington DC <br/>

I have suggested sitting in on some courses at the local community college to <br/>
see if there is something he might like.  He has refused. I don&#39;t think it is <br/>
about going back to school as it is about getting out of the house and meeting <br/>
others.  I think his sister (the 16 year old living with the Grandparents who do <br/>
not support unschooling) (the one who is also preparing for her GED) has much to <br/>
do with this sudden decision to go back to school.  Regardless of where his <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-251108467">I thought I&#39;d pipe in because this happened to my kids a few years ago.  My then 11yo wanted to go to school and she did.  She lasted a quarter and then came home.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;As an unschooling Mother, public schools and their <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; agendas go against everything I believe in. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is how I felt when she went to school, and she knew it.  I was NOT a supportive mom in her choice, I did not make her choice as easy as I could of for her and I regret that.  I told her how pointless the assignments were, and gave her my opinion on everything.  She quit school and  came home but she wasn&#39;t 100% happy, in DSM there are very few people home during the day that she has much if anything in common with.  Every night she was happy and was busy with friends & activities, but during the day I just wasn&#39;t meeting her needs.  I feel like I tried everything, she just really wanted to be with her peers all the time.  I look back and wish I would have done better, I wish I would have been more respectful of her choices, even the one I didn&#39;t agree with.<br/>
<br/>
So, she is 13 now and trying again.  This year I have a whole new attitude towards school and am being 100% supportive. In fact she told me if she wants to quit that I have to make her finish out the year.  Not sure if I&#39;d be able to do that. I said &quot;what if you tell me you want to go part time&quot;, she said &quot;let me!&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
When she went at age 11 and having been unschooled almost her entire life she did fine.  She was not the math whiz (speed wise) and that frustrated my type A child, over time (probably a short time) she would have done even better.  Poor handwriting really frustrated her too and this past year she has written  A LOT!  She copies pages of books in journals!  And she is much more confident about her handwriting.  But that&#39;s just her, some kids may not care.<br/>
<br/>
When Lydia went to school my son then 9 wanted to go too.  I signed him up for a Montessori school (which I was much more supportive of because it was more in line with my schooling philosophies) and he lasted the entire year.  Of course he just went for PE and lunch (bwg) but even that eventually bored him.  He is still home and enjoying himself and not interested in going this year even tho his sister is.<br/>
<br/>
When I signed Lydia up they wanted to do a placement test (both times) the first time I argued the point of test and really just probably seemed over the top and made no point to people who are working for the school.  This time I just said, let&#39;s just put her in class and see how she does, if there&#39;s a problem we&#39;ll go from there.   The school was like, &quot;OK.&quot;  That&#39;s it, no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
However, in 8th grade (which is the grade she&#39;s in) they do their ITBS testing and she will have to take it (have to is probably strong, I could fight it)  I however will not have to make a big deal about it...and I won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
In Iowa, they offer the possibility to dual enroll, where one can go part time and pick and chose their classes?  Maybe talk to him about that?  That might meet his needs?  At the high school age, they seem to have a little more choices in their schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have choices in the schools that he goes too?  Are there some charter schools, montessori or free schools that might be more in line with your philosophies?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-What I am most fearful of is the school&#39;s refusal to allow my<br/>
children to school as &quot;we choose&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make my mistake, let your kids come up with their own ideas about school.  The reality is some kids don&#39;t mind the hoop jumping so they can be with friends all day.  School does work for a lot of kids, I&#39;m not arguing that it&#39;s an ideal place to be but just that not everyone has the same take on it.<br/>
<br/>
I understand wanting your kids home, but take Jenny&#39;s advice:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You can support your kids as people even when you don&#39;t like the choices they<br/>
make. It&#39;s part of living and letting go and letting them grow into the people<br/>
they are and will become.&quot;<br/>

My son is Bi-Polar. He cannot handle stress. In fifth grade, my bright  <br/>
child<br/>
was humiliated by a teacher known for singling out a child and  <br/>
humiliating him,<br/>
and punishing them for the year. My son was that child.<br/>
He was not diagnosed then (and I use that term VERY loosely). She  <br/>
stood over him<br/>
with a stop watch until he finished his multiplication tables in two  <br/>
minutes.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
There was a joke Whoopi Goldberg used to tell that doesn&#39;t make sense  <br/>
anymore.  (If it wasn&#39;t hers, it was Billy Crystal&#39;s.)<br/>
When she travelled she always took a bomb, because the odds of there  <br/>
being a bomb on a plane were [whatever big odds], but the odds of  <br/>
there being TWO bombs were in the billions.<br/>
<br/>
The odds of that happening to your son a second time are very small.<br/>
If your son would rather go to school than stay home, and if you keep  <br/>
him home, then you might seem to him to be the person standing over  <br/>
him and punishing him with a stop watch.<br/>
<br/>
=======<br/>
This question might have been misunderstood.<br/>
=I don&#39;t know the laws where you live, but have you looked to see if<br/>
homeschooled kids can participate in extra curricular activities? That  <br/>
might satisfy their<br/>
need to meet other kids with out doing the full deal.=<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have done this and the school refused because my children were  <br/>
not enrolled.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IF the law says they can, the school cannot refuse.<br/>
Perhaps there&#39;s a half-time option.  But don&#39;t ask the school.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not their business, nor is it to their advantage, to know the laws  <br/>
about homeschooling.  Ask the unschoolers in your state.  Find the  <br/>
laws and read them for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
It might be that the school is right, but don&#39;t accept that because  <br/>
the school said so.   Inform yourself.<br/>
<br/>
-= Regardless of where his feelings have originated, his decisions  <br/>
must be respected.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you believe this, then I&#39;m confused about your long posts so full  <br/>
of emotion and resistance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When I first pulled my kids out of school, I was reported to DCF  <br/>
for educational<br/>
neglect. That was part of the long and very stressful legal battle to  <br/>
home<br/>
school. Unschooling is illegal here and never mentioned.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling&quot; is a way to homeschool.  Homeschooling IS mentioned.   <br/>
Each family needs to understand unschooling enough to make it workable  <br/>
within the state law.  Any family that doesn&#39;t bother to do that  <br/>
probably IS violating the law, and probably isn&#39;t unschooling  <br/>
optimally.   Finding local unschoolers is advised pretty regularly on  <br/>
this list and others like it.  Other unschoolers have experience with  <br/>
the ways the laws are interpretted and enforced.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;I&#39;m not going to meet the laws, because I&#39;m an  <br/>
unschooling Mother,&quot; that&#39;s going to present problems problems for  <br/>
that family.<br/>

better bet, regardless of what it looks like in your home.<br/>

activities at which they might meet kids who share their interests?<br/>
<br/>
School doesn&#39;t guarantee opportunities to socialize any more than  <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling groups do. Your son and daughter might not  <br/>
find anyone to connect with in either place. But if you find  <br/>
opportunities for them to explore their passions with others, it could  <br/>
fill their need for social connection.<br/>

<br/>
Lots of kids can&#39;t handle stress.  This is about school and fitting into school. <br/>
 I&#39;m sorry you carried that over into unschooling.  Labels very often do more <br/>
harm than good.  Bi-polar is another form of &quot;I&#39;m depressed sometimes and happy <br/>
other times&quot;.  There are some people for whom those feelings are extreme.  One <br/>
of the very important aspects of unschooling that is solely on the parents, is <br/>
to create a happy learning environment.  Kids don&#39;t learn nearly as well when <br/>
they aren&#39;t happy.  It doesn&#39;t mean that every person needs to be happy at every <br/>
moment of every day, it means that things that create happy momentum should be <br/>
paramount from day to day.<br/>
<br/>
If going to concerts with friends is something that creates happiness, do more <br/>
of that.  If staying at home without friends creates unhappiness, do less of <br/>
that.  If you want to unschool well, make your lives as happy as possible, make <br/>
home a happy place, make food and grocery shopping and everything in between <br/>
something that is happy.<br/>

I will respect and support my son in his decision to return to school.  That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
<br/>
that I am not emotional about it and worried.  I am also concerned that although <br/>
he says he wants to go to HS that he knows what that entails.  When I discuss <br/>
this with him I do not want to sound resistant nor do I want him to think he <br/>
cannot accomplish whatever it is he wants to do there.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although Unschooling is a type of homeschooling, here in CT it is not looked <br/>
upon that way by schools and the local government.  I have been in court and was <br/>
advised not to mention the word &quot;unschooling&quot;.  In court I had to provide books <br/>
and completed school work as proof that I was home schooling.  <br/>

<br/>
Anyone here would have advised you not to talk about unschooling, too.<br/>
I think if you discussed such things on this list or Always Learning,  <br/>
people probably did say &quot;call it unschooling,&quot; and show evidence of  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Explaining it in terms of The Open Classroom or earlier school reform  <br/>
movements can help.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry things aren&#39;t working out better for your family as to  <br/>
unschooling.  There still might be a return to the possibility of  <br/>
unschooling.  You could also plan that travel and those activities  <br/>
around school days and it could be wonderful.  It might even be the  <br/>
tipping point that helps them decide to stay home.<br/>
<br/>
As you make decisions, make them toward happiness, joy, acceptance.     <br/>
Don&#39;t let school be the defining or deciding thing in your  <br/>
relationship with your children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I might have thought that at the beginning of our unschooling lives,  <br/>
but I don&#39;t anymore. It&#39;s my responsibility as a parent to create a  <br/>
rich life of learning for my daughter. At 15, she has preferences and  <br/>
passions. And I *still* offer more of what she loves plus new  <br/>
experiences, books, games, ideas. Her *learning* is her own, but I  <br/>
help her with access to possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is completely &quot;child-led&quot; then it could end up being a  <br/>
very small world if a child doesn&#39;t have a facilitating parent.<br/>
