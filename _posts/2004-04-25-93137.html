&lt;&lt;i can&#39;t remember who emailed this, but wanted to thank you.  One of my <br/>
hesitations has been that I don&#39;t know or remember a lot of the so called basics <br/>
and needed subjects or ideas or details. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly reported yesterday that a family we know with two teens and a younger <br/>
boy (9?) won&#39;t let the kids watch Homestarrunner cartoons when he&#39;s there <br/>
because it says &quot;crap.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, I think this:  He KNOWS he can&#39;t watch it because it says &quot;crap.&quot;<br/>
So there it is.  The word is in his head all by itself, like a little <br/>
steaming pile.<br/>
But if he watched the cartoons and that word came up maybe once in 10,000 <br/>
words and it was in context and funny and he had all the other input, art, <br/>
parody, music, word play, that would make SO many things accessible to him.  Ideas <br/>
and connections galore, and just lighthearted humor and relaxing laughter.<br/>
<br/>
But no.  <br/>
And these aren&#39;t religious people, just uptight parents who think controls <br/>
are the same as good parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I gave a copy of the Eddie Izzard DVD &quot;Dress to Kill&quot; to a family I know and <br/>
they won&#39;t play it where their teenagers are because he says &quot;fuck.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well again, they&#39;ve &quot;saved&quot; them from exposure to a word they already know, <br/>
and also protected them from some crazed but brilliant stories on WWII, Star <br/>
Wars, French language and culture, the history of the Church of England, <br/>
Napoleon, Hitler...<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t worry about my kids and they keep on amazing me.<br/>

<br/>
I need to hear over and over that they will find what they need to learn and it isn&#39;t all left up to my memory and intelligence.  Especially because i have a very low image of myself when it comes to both.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
