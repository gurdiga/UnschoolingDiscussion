<br/>
&gt; Are you saying that you never provide consequences or &quot;punishments&quot;<br/>
&gt; for inappropriate behaviors?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Correct.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would you let your children, for<br/>
&gt; instance, swear at an adult, or punch holes in your walls if<br/>
&gt; they &quot;needed&quot;  or &quot;wanted&quot; to?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The part that is missing here is that because my children are not punished,<br/>
they do not &quot;need&quot; or &quot;want&quot; to punish me or anyone else. If they are<br/>
unhappy, they know they can get my attention and help without extreme<br/>
measures. This took my respecting their needs and wants first, and also took<br/>
my deliberate decision to have a certain kind of family dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What about tattoos, piercings or<br/>
&gt; shoplifting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like we learned in Sesame Street, &quot;one of these things is not like the<br/>
others; one these things just doesn&#39;t belong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is considerable difference between body art (which I would certainly<br/>
let them have) and illegal activity (which yes, I would make every effort to<br/>
stop should it ever become an issue. The state might punish them for illegal<br/>
activity, I personally would not. Punishment doesn&#39;t work for felons,<br/>
there&#39;s no reason to expect it to work for children).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When do you finally step in?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never stepped out.  I&#39;m not a disinterested observer from afar. I&#39;m<br/>
their fan, supporter, helper, healer. I&#39;m right here, right in step with<br/>
them, all along the way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am curious as to who<br/>
&gt; runs your household, you or the children?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a dictatorship, so we leave the throne empty. It&#39;s a family, so we<br/>
all have a say.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  When they are adults, will<br/>
&gt; they know how to deal with &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;restrictions&quot; in their job, or<br/>
&gt; life?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sweet Lady of Light, I dearly hope so. I hope they will know that a job is<br/>
just a job and can be changed at whim. I hope they know their lives are for<br/>
joy and laughter, not drudgery and fear.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or will they just do what they please, never considering<br/>
&gt; anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At eight (almost) and five, they do what they please and show marvelous<br/>
consideration for everyone else. I would have a hard time imagining two more<br/>
compassionate, gentle, thinking girl-children. I can&#39;t fathom why that<br/>
should change.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  There will certainly be consequences when he tells his<br/>
&gt; boss, &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they don&#39;t want to they should say so, and I hope they never act against<br/>
their beliefs.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Just a FYI - I had a few people email me OFF LIST, with actual<br/>
&gt; SUPPORT, in agreement with reasonable consequences.  They didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to post publicly, for fear of people attacking them for their views.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we&#39;re a fearsome bunch.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t do much good to tell anybody this. Bringing in hordes of shadowy<br/>
supporters who won&#39;t speak up for themselves and join the conversation is,<br/>
in my humble opinion, a cowardly tactic.<br/>
<br/>
I speak for myself. I find I respect me in the morning.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; The violin was one example.  My husband just asked her to please run<br/>
&gt; downstairs and turn off the tv, because we were all getting settled<br/>
&gt; down for bed.  She simply didn&#39;t feel like it, so she huffed, and was<br/>
&gt; rude.  She simply didn&#39;t want to be bothered.  That is often the<br/>
&gt; reason.  &quot;Oh honey, would you put that in the trash instead of<br/>
&gt; leaving it on the counter?&quot;  might result in stomping, or even<br/>
&gt; yelling.  &quot;Why do I always have to...  &quot; she&#39;ll rant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think she thinks she can just say, &quot;I&#39;m too tired, will you do it?&quot;<br/>
and have the adults not huff at her. I think she thinks she&#39;s being ordered<br/>
around without having reciprocal privileges. What happens if she says, &quot;No,<br/>
I&#39;m busy, sorry&quot;? My guess is not the same thing that happens if you or her<br/>
dad says it to her.<br/>
<br/>
You said something early on which I hope you&#39;ll look at a little sideways<br/>
for awhile and see if you can discern it in a new light. You don&#39;t have to<br/>
answer to me for it, but it was really telling from my point of view. You<br/>
said you thought you were most bothered by your daughter not cleaning her<br/>
room because you&#39;d just spent $2000 on it.<br/>
<br/>
That kind of attitude isn&#39;t a one-off thing, it&#39;s a world view. It&#39;s what<br/>
can make a child feel she&#39;s less-than in a family, and if the child has some<br/>
gumption it is the kind of view of her importance (or lack thereof, in this<br/>
case when pitted against money) that can make her fight back.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Different kids have different personalities.  Some are more &quot;strong<br/>
&gt; willed&quot; than others.  Some are very agreeable to everything, mine is<br/>
&gt; not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course. I have one of each -- one very agreeable child and one with a<br/>
will of iron. I worried much more over the personality of the former, though<br/>
not so much anymore as she&#39;s shown that when push really comes to shove, she<br/>
has a sticking point. Weak-willed women are boring or victims, and I would<br/>
never want my daughters to be either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308993117">&lt;&lt;  You<br/>
said you thought you were most bothered by your daughter not cleaning her<br/>
room because you&#39;d just spent $2000 on it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I missed that before.<br/>
<br/>
A group of women I&#39;d known a long time were talking one day, and I said I <br/>
used to look in the JC Penney catalogs and dream about the matched furniture <br/>
sets for little girls&#39; rooms--the matching dressers, bookshelves, corner <br/>
desk, bed with drawers...   My friend Diane looked at me levelly for a couple <br/>
of seconds.  She usually speaks quickest of any of us, so that pause was <br/>
significant.  She said &quot;My room was like that.  They used to beat me in <br/>
there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I decided years ago I never wanted a piece of furniture I cared so much about <br/>
that my kids couldn&#39;t be trusted to sit on it or play next to it.  When we <br/>
were looking for houses, I turned a couple down because they were too <br/>
precious---one had thick, expensive carpet and all-wood trim.  The other had <br/>
stencilled walls.  We went with the house that had old carpet already, cheap <br/>
baseboards painted white, and a big back yard.  We let the fact that we have <br/>
kids drive our house choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446108700">I get a sense of an unwilling partnership. That you&#39;ve set up your role and<br/>
it&#39;s up to her to fill her role. And the conflict is arising because you&#39;re<br/>
giving what you think is necessary rather than what she needs.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m sensing there&#39;s this knot inside of you that says you&#39;ve given what<br/>
you can and you can&#39;t/won&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t have to give more. But the message<br/>
behind what people are saying isn&#39;t that it&#39;s necessary to give more but to<br/>
listen to what she&#39;s telling you by her actions so you can give her what she<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like you&#39;re speaking two different languages without realizing it and<br/>
you&#39;re each getting frustrated that the other isn&#39;t understanding what<br/>
you&#39;re saying. And you feel like you&#39;ve thrown as many words as you can and<br/>
been as clear as you can but she&#39;s just not putting the effort into<br/>
understanding you.<br/>
<br/>
But as someone said even better in a different context, it isn&#39;t up to her<br/>
to understand your language. It&#39;s up to you to understand her language. (Did<br/>
someone mention The Explosive Child book?)<br/>
<br/>
Have you read any at the Unschooling.com message boards? I think you could<br/>
get a lot out of what AnneO has to say about honoring children. Her older<br/>
son has Aspergers which can make children &quot;difficult&quot; but you&#39;d never know<br/>
because she listens to what his actions say he&#39;s needing rather than what<br/>
society has said that kids need. And she&#39;s there with him to help him figure<br/>
out ways to handle life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You<br/>
&gt; said you thought you were most bothered by your daughter not cleaning her<br/>
&gt; room because you&#39;d just spent $2000 on it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had this revelation when I first started discussing cleaning and cooking<br/>
and all the things we need to do for our families. The revelation was that<br/>
we *don&#39;t* have to do all those things. We get to choose. We don&#39;t have to<br/>
make dinner every night. We don&#39;t have to scrub toilets.<br/>
<br/>
Once we realize we have a choice, we realize that what we choose to do for<br/>
our families is either a gift that we know they want to receive or a gift<br/>
that we want to give them with no strings attached -- in which case perhaps<br/>
we should see it as a gift to ourselves. Often we get those two confused.<br/>
<br/>
Like if we want to give them the gift of dinner, then we shouldn&#39;t knock<br/>
ourselves out for 3 hours preparing a gourmet meal. They won&#39;t appreciate it<br/>
and we&#39;ll resent that they don&#39;t appreciate it. If we want to give them<br/>
something, then we should give them homemade pizza or a picnic in the<br/>
backyard or even McDonalds. Something we know that *they* want, *not*<br/>
something that we think they should want and appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
If we want to prepare a gourmet meal, we need to recognize that we&#39;re doing<br/>
it for ourselves and not for them. So their appreciation isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>
Only our assessment in how well we think we did is what&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
So if you truly wanted to give her the gift of a room, it was a room to do<br/>
with as she wished. I think what you unconsciously gave her was something<br/>
that you wanted which was a certain image of a child&#39;s room that met your<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you saying that you never provide consequences or &quot;punishments&quot;<br/>
&gt; for inappropriate behaviors?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Traditional parenting tells us to mold their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
But traditional parenting is very concerned with how well the children<br/>
appear to others and how convenient the children are to live with.<br/>
<br/>
To me the primary concern should be *why* a child is behaving as she is, not<br/>
*what* she&#39;s doing. If a child is lying or stealing or hitting, there&#39;s a<br/>
reason behind it. Stopping the behavior doesn&#39;t stop what&#39;s causing it. Just<br/>
forces into a new channel.<br/>
<br/>
If we see kids as inherently bad who need to be taught to be good, then<br/>
punishment makes sense, I suppose. It would be like pulling weeds. But I see<br/>
&quot;bad&quot; behavior as either not understanding how their behavior is affecting<br/>
someone else, or because they aren&#39;t yet able to understand, or as a<br/>
reaction to how they&#39;re being treated, or personality. (Slamming a door is a<br/>
lot better than punching someone!) Accepting that their needs are different<br/>
than ours -- because they&#39;re kids and because their personalities are<br/>
different than ours -- is often hard, but it&#39;s a pathway to being their<br/>
partner rather than their trainer.<br/>
