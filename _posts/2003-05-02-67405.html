<div id="ygrps-yiv-816038769">We love Easter Egg hunts!!  In our family, we do the hunts over and over.  <br/>
The kids especially love hiding the eggs for mom and dad to find, which is <br/>
really fun!  They love watching us *pretend* fight over the eggs and <br/>
goodies!  Here we are, two grown ups, pushing and shoving each other around <br/>
(in an obviously playful way) and stealing each others eggs.  The kids just <br/>
roll around the yard laughing hysterically and take pictures of us to show <br/>
everyone.  It&#39;s really a blast!<br/>
<br/>
Once we are finished hunting, we dump everything into the Easter Bunny&#39;s <br/>
basket...a huge basket the easter bunny leaves for us to share our goodies <br/>
from.  This way, no one gets upset because they ran out of candy or treats <br/>
before anyone else.  (They keep personal goodies like their new toothbrushes <br/>
and small gifts in their own baskets.)  If they all grab treats from the <br/>
same basket, no one keeps count of who had how much, etc.  It really works <br/>
out great for us and the kids see that competition is just a fun and playful <br/>
thing!<br/>

lead to the next &quot;stash.&quot;  We use candy in those plastic eggs and small toys. <br/>
 No one gets more than the other.  They work together to figure out the clue <br/>
to go to the next spot.  There each persons things are clearly marked and <br/>
there is another clue.  It is so much fun.  I have them running all over the <br/>
house.  And it takes them a while too.  They totally love it.<br/>
<br/>
We have always done that because I remember growing up it was all about being <br/>
fast so that my brother wouldn&#39;t get more than me.  The hunt was all over in <br/>
a matter of two minutes and we were fighting over who got what.  I decided <br/>
that I was going to take the competition out of Easter egg hunting.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205198922">Oh!  I like this, too!  We&#39;ll have to try that!<br/>
<br/>
That was the reason we started the Easter Bunny&#39;s basket.  We had the &quot;she <br/>
got more&quot; problem once and decided once was enough.  I may have to partner <br/>
up the little ones, though, since they can&#39;t read!  Unless we did picture <br/>
clues......<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great idea!<br/>

I use 3 sizes of the plastic eggs for our hunts on Easter morning. Joe and I<br/>
hide them about 2 a.m. What a sight that is with us in our jammies out in<br/>
the dark!!! Anyway, we hid this last Easter about 100 eggs. All 4 kids hunt.<br/>
Tara usually helps Alyssa. I mark all the eggs with one initial as all 4<br/>
kids have different first letter names. They are only to pick up eggs with<br/>
their initial on them. Alyssa&#39;s eggs are easier to find and of course Joe<br/>
hides Tara&#39;s which means she usually needs a ladder!! I find little super<br/>
balls, stickers, money and other trinkets for the 3 younger children. No<br/>
candy. We always have candy here and that&#39;s no new thing. For Tara I find<br/>
little nail polish bottles or lip gloss or even underwear works well in the<br/>
eggs. (she wears thongs) Then I get a few big things for the smaller kids,<br/>
(Tara gets more money) and hide clues in the eggs to send them on a<br/>
scavenger hunt in the house when they are done looking for their bigger<br/>
gifts. Our Easter mornings are always so much fun and well the video&#39;s speak<br/>
for themselves.<br/>

clues out loud so that they both could hear them and figure them out.  I <br/>
would draw a little picture of a sink, and he would have to hunt around to <br/>
figure out which sink.  Or a picture of a bed, but he had to find the right <br/>
one.  <br/>

sink and print it out for a clue.  That would be neat. <br/>
