<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920659768">I love Kenneth Brannagh.  Mostly because he loves Shakespeare. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
It&#39;s not physical attractiveness, although he&#39;s not repulsive.<br/>
<br/>
But I really loved the moment in the new movie when he&#39;s signing autographs <br/>
at the bookstore and pulls Harry up for a photo op.  I was thinking YES!  <br/>
Younger Harry Potter fans will see him, LIKE him, and want to see what else <br/>
he&#39;s been in, and they will watch Henry V!  They&#39;ll watch Much Ado About <br/>
Nothing!  (Maybe they&#39;ll watch Othello too, especially if they&#39;re Matrix <br/>
fans, and that might be too much for Harry Potterites; and they might watch <br/>
the really long Hamlet, and that&#39;s too much... )<br/>
<br/>
But the thought of kids watching Henry V because they liked Harry Potter <br/>
struck me as a worth side effect of that photo opportunity which works in <br/>
both worlds!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen the new HP yet but I had thought that after Lanora sees <br/>
Kenneth Brannah in this she might be willing to watch a bit of &quot;Henry V&quot; with <br/>
me.  I dragged several friends with me when it was still in theaters but <br/>
Lanora hadn&#39;t been born yet.  Gladly all of the &quot;I don&#39;t like Shakespeare&quot; <br/>
folks were hooked by the Brannah&#39;s rendition, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; was an <br/>
easier sell after that.<br/>
