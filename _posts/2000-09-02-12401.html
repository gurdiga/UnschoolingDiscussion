<div id="ygrps-yiv-767182464">Okay so DH and I have very different veiws on how to handle certain <br/>
situations with the children. He thinks that we need to use more <br/>
corporal punishment in the form of a switch, that the hand isn&#39;t <br/>
enough. Not that I use my hand often, but I do believe there is a <br/>
time and a place for it and it is always a last resort. The last time <br/>
and only time that I seriously used my hand on either of the children <br/>
was when DS ran off in the mall and I couldn&#39;t find him. He was <br/>
almost 4 at the time. Anyway, to make a long story short, I had <br/>
security looking for him for 15-20 min. When they found him I bawled <br/>
like a baby, held him in my arms then took him to the bathroom and <br/>
spanked his bare bum till my hand hurt, not out of anger but out of <br/>
love. I wanted him to understand how serious it is that he not run <br/>
off like that. Then I explained to him how scared I was and how much <br/>
I loved him and sat there in the stall just holding him close for a <br/>
while. Needless to say he has never run off in any store again. <br/>
<br/>
As far as DH and I go I have always believed more in the lines of <br/>
Love and Logic and DH believes more along the lines of coersion and <br/>
force much like the ps uses. So my question is does anyone have any <br/>
suggestions as to how to handle situations that arrise when DH is <br/>
dealing with the children in a manner that I totally disagree with <br/>
and the children aren&#39;t used to, simply because they are use to the <br/>
way I handle things since I am the one who is home all day and night <br/>
and DH works all day and all night?  Corallyn</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521422289"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; With all this said I do respect each  person&#39;s right to their<br/>
&gt; oppinion. That doesn&#39;t mean I do/have to agree/like that opinion.<br/>
&gt; Corallyn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s right, Corallyn.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I did some spanking when my girls where younger, before I knew about<br/>
Aletha Solter&#39;s work and before I joined a Self-Healing Circle.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t judging you personally. However I still believe that spanking is<br/>
abusive. Therefore I have to admit that &quot;I used to abuse my children&quot;. I<br/>
have changed. But I could only begin to change once I realized what I was<br/>
doing and acknowledging it openly, while at the same time being gentle with<br/>
myself, not beating myself up or judging myself. Corporal punishment is not<br/>
the only type of child abuse - a lot of emotional abuse goes unnoticed. I<br/>
have been &quot;guilty&quot; of that, too. Realizing that my behaviours originated in<br/>
my own childhood is not an excuse or a reason to blame my upbringing, but a<br/>
place to begin changing. I am working on it every day.<br/>
<br/>
So I would like to join someone else here who said &quot;try not to take it<br/>
personally&quot;. I know that is not easy sometimes, and I see every day how<br/>
&#39;taking things personally and getting defensive&#39; gets in way more than<br/>
anything when it comes to opening up to change.<br/>
<br/>
I thank you, Corallyn, for posting you original message. In my emotionality<br/>
I was maybe too quick to react by sending all the Aletha Solter info (I<br/>
still think everyone could benefit from knowing her stuff), without<br/>
acknowledging that I have been where you are, Corallyn, and I do have<br/>
sympathy for you and your situation.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I recently joined a Couples&#39; Self-Healing Circle. It has been<br/>
most valuable in helping us deal with some of our issues - differences in<br/>
childrearing being one, especially since we are blended family (I have two<br/>
girls from a previous marriage, he has a son and a daughter from two<br/>
previous marriages and together we have Benjamin who is three).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I apologize for not being more sensitive to begin with. That doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean I feel any different or less passionate about the subject of spanking<br/>
or other forms of punishment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400289491"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; A four year old is a child and if the child got away from an adult, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it is the ADULT&#39;s responsibility!  Period!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are absulutely right. It is my responsibility. I am responsible <br/>
for how I teach my children and at preasant the choices they make and <br/>
how I deal with those choices. <br/>
<br/>
I think Lynda was trying to say (correct me if I&#39;m wrong Lynda)... that you <br/>
as the adult were responsible for your child running away and punishing the <br/>
child for your lack of responsibility doesn&#39;t seem to make any sense... There <br/>
is no judgement in that... It&#39;s just a fact... If you are the responsible one <br/>
for a situation and something happens in that situations, then I would be <br/>
apologizing to my son for not watching him well enough that he could get away <br/>
from me, not hitting him for something that children do... They don&#39;t <br/>
understand at 4 yrs old they could get lost or someone could hurt them... <br/>
They just see things that they like and off they go, which is why it&#39;s our <br/>
job as adults to not let that happen.  But why should your son suffer <br/>
consequences for your inability to take care of him?  It&#39;s just a thought... <br/>
and one I only just thought off.... <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make you a bad parent, just a typical reaction to the thought that <br/>
you are not perfect and chose to take an action that wasn&#39;t appropriate given <br/>
the situation.  Why is it so difficult to admit a mistake.  Spanking a child <br/>
because they ran away when it was the responsibility of the adult to make <br/>
sure they didn&#39;t run away doesn&#39;t make any logical sense to me and it <br/>
certainly wouldn&#39;t make any to a child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266343021">To be very open and honest Nicoletta, I am from an abusive family as <br/>
well. There was abuse left and right and I was the one who received <br/>
the brunt of the abuse mostly in the form of emotional and some <br/>
physical by my father when I was a teenager. By physical I mean that <br/>
he would taunt me till I was fuming mad and then walk away laughing. <br/>
This was something that he did to me starting when I was very young. <br/>
When I became a teenager I learned that I had a right to not be <br/>
treated this way. The years of emotional abuse came out physically <br/>
when he would do this. He was good at knowing when I had reached the <br/>
point of physical anger and when I would walk away he would dare me <br/>
to come back and fight him. And I did. And although my mother is from <br/>
an abusive family as well, she was my advocate. With the problems I <br/>
had in ps she was the one who stood up for me when I wasn&#39;t able to <br/>
stand up for myself. In the end it was my mother who was able to <br/>
acknowledge that she wasn&#39;t perfect and admit to me when she made a <br/>
mistake in her parenting, and there were many mistakes, however, none <br/>
that were as bad as what my father inflicted on me. He, by the way, <br/>
to this day admits nothing wrong. He sees himself as infalable in <br/>
every aspect of his life. The point I am wanting make here and <br/>
getting off the subject of is that although I come from a family of <br/>
abuse, somehow, someway I was able to look at what was happening to <br/>
me and realize that it was wrong. That this isn&#39;t the way it is <br/>
supposed to be. And then figure out how to do it better, I will even <br/>
say right. That isn&#39;t to say that I am always right but that the <br/>
environment that I have been able to provide for my children is <br/>
happy, loving and not abusive. Meaning, they will never know what it <br/>
is like to grow up with anything close to what I did. I have been <br/>
able to figure out how to give them the type of environment I wanted <br/>
to and deserved to grow up in. How do I know I am doing this with the <br/>
background I just described? I used to wonder that myself. I began <br/>
looking at what the &quot;experts&quot; say and suggest and found that I was <br/>
already doing the majority of it. This isn&#39;t to say that I am perfect <br/>
in my parenting skills. It is to say that I don&#39;t have the problems <br/>
of parenting my children that most survivors of abuse do.<br/>
<br/>
I do apreciate your openness and your opinion. And thank you for your <br/>
sensitivity in you last post. To be very honest I was extremely <br/>
offended by the email you had sent.: ) however, all is forgotten. : ) <br/>
<br/>
I am curious as to some of the things you have learned in your class <br/>
with DH. How have you come to terms and found common ground with the <br/>
differences you have in your childrenrearing techniques?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547853379">I can see that it is your opinion that it doesn&#39;t matter what the <br/>
situation was. There is absolutely no good reason for spanking your <br/>
child. I can respect that opinion and I don&#39;t agree with it. I am not <br/>
going to defend myself any further because it is pointless. I agree <br/>
to disagree, as my mother tells me. And I can accept that. No hard <br/>
feelings. Corallyn : ) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518822142">I just want to state that corporal punishment isn&#39;t always considered abuse,<br/>
or &quot;extreme discipline&quot;, even by the ones on the receiving end.  And that<br/>
all spanking is not the same.<br/>
<br/>
My fil was whipped by his father with a razor strap. He, in turn, whipped<br/>
his eldest son with his belt, but not my husband, the younger son. He also<br/>
never raised his hand once to his daughter. And his father never whipped any<br/>
of my fil&#39;s sisters. My bil is strict with his children but he has never<br/>
spanked them with anything, to my knowledge. None of them decry spanking,<br/>
but they also at some point decided against continuing what their own<br/>
fathers did. None say they felt humiliated or fearful at being punished this<br/>
way. They love and respect their fathers. Not fear, sincerely love.<br/>
<br/>
My own father was whipped only once as far as I know. He and his brother<br/>
were around 10 years of age...they had the idea to see what would happen if<br/>
they put a large shotgun shell in a vice and beat it with a hammer. When<br/>
their father walked in the barn and saw that he &quot;lost it&quot;....started yelling<br/>
in Norwegian and whipped the both of them at once. A panic moment, no doubt.<br/>
They could have blinded themselves of who knows what. My dad realized that<br/>
his &quot;pa&quot; was scared to death. This wasn&#39;t a control freak or an abuser. My<br/>
dad has no ill will towards him for it. And my dad never spanked any of us.<br/>
With one brother, he could have beaten him within an inch of his life (and<br/>
then about another foot) and it wouldn&#39;t have made a bit of difference. With<br/>
some kids, there&#39;s just no answer.<br/>
<br/>
I was spanked by my mother only a few times. It wasn&#39;t simply a punishment,<br/>
it was to bring me back to reality. One time I was hysterical because my<br/>
finger was profusely bleeding. I wouldn&#39;t stop screaming and flinging blood<br/>
all over the bathroom. She spanked me sharply and I immediately calmed down.<br/>
I was glad she did it.<br/>
<br/>
When I spank my kids it&#39;s with my own hand....a simple &quot;stinger&quot; to get<br/>
their attention and let them know I mean business.  When they&#39;re out of<br/>
control it works wonders. Of course, after a certain age, it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
With us, it&#39;s around age 7. (starting in toddlerhood when they first start<br/>
getting into trouble) It&#39;s never a beating. I&#39;m not screaming and scaring<br/>
them. I don&#39;t tell them it&#39;s all their fault, etc, etc. I know it isn&#39;t<br/>
abuse. I don&#39;t have a problem with parents who choose not to spank. Whatever<br/>
other method works for them is fine by me....And I would never condone<br/>
actual abuse as &quot;discipline&quot;. I can understand how people who&#39;ve worked<br/>
closely with abused children (or were one themselves) would need to<br/>
completely distance themselves from any form or spanking, but spanking<br/>
doesn&#39;t not always mean abuse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-881222958">Valerie, a huge THANK YOU. Someone finally stepped in and agrees with <br/>
me that just because I spank my children does not make me abusive. <br/>
What Valerie just described as the form of spanking she uses is the <br/>
same form that I normally use. It is not abuse. A big sigh of relief <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339942223">Have to say it as it&#39;s on my mind... But I must assume you and <br/>
Valerie live in the backwaters of Tennessee, or some hick mountain <br/>
top in West Virginia and not in the modern world where people don&#39;t <br/>
treat their children as objects to be controlled.  Hubby just <br/>
said &quot;and these kind of people unschool?&quot;  My husband just said if he <br/>
saw someone spanking a child he&#39;d go over and intervene, whether the <br/>
other parent liked it or not, and he&#39;s actually done that once before <br/>
when someone was yanking on their child&#39;s arm when they were getting <br/>
them out of a car... I guess it&#39;s a personal preference this spanking <br/>
thing... but for the life of me I cannot see any logic in it, it&#39;s <br/>
all emotion based and based on how the parent is feeling at the time, <br/>
which is rageful.  If it wasn&#39;t based on emotion a parent could make <br/>
an appointment with their child at say 5pm to be spanked and everyone <br/>
would be happy... That&#39;s never the case so therefore it must be done <br/>
out of rage... How would you like it, if you did something that I <br/>
didn&#39;t like and I grabbed you and spanked you?  You would be utterly <br/>
humiliated and appalled by my behavior.  So what&#39;s the difference?  <br/>
<br/>
If I could see some logic in this whole spanking issue, then I might <br/>
agree with it... But it doesn&#39;t matter what way you say it, how you <br/>
present an argument for it, it&#39;s not logical and if it&#39;s not logical <br/>
for an adult then it&#39;s certainly doesn&#39;t make any sense to a child.<br/>
<br/>
Again my HO and now I&#39;ll go and put on an even bigger suit of armour <br/>
and try and calm down over this issue, which I actually thought was <br/>
dead until I read this post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689145630">Which, by the way and again as stated and noticed by few, the <br/>
original post was NOT about spanking, although it was mentioned. It <br/>
was about dealing with differences with DH just as the subject line <br/>
stated. IMO the majority of people here have shown much <br/>
shortsitedness and lack of respect toward the my views as a parent <br/>
and really offered little support toward what was really rather hard <br/>
to bring up, Differentces with DH. What have I learned from all this? <br/>
This list really isn&#39;t about what everyone thinks about. This list is <br/>
about aproximately 400 unschoolers who discuss unschooling and have a <br/>
general respect of those who do unschool unless they have ever laid a <br/>
hand on thier child. Then it is about casting out those who are <br/>
deemed abusive and shoving your opinions down their throught with the <br/>
intent, IMO, to remove them from the list. Simply because they &quot;don&#39;t <br/>
fit the mold&quot;. Sounds pretty PS to me. Oh and by the way you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
believe who has posted to me off list to offer support and agree with <br/>
my views. I won&#39;t mention who they are simply because they don&#39;t want <br/>
the same to happen to them. I guess my point in saying that is to let <br/>
you all know that your all &quot;mighty correctness&quot; in the issue is not <br/>
as agreed upon as you would like to think. Corallyn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>wanted to add this : In all my years on the Internet (since 1987 to <br/>
be precise) I have *never* seen a productive discussion on the topic <br/>
of spanking.  Never once has someone who is against spanking decided <br/>
that it was okay for *anyone* to spank their child.  I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
anyone who is for spanking decide that perhaps their method of <br/>
discipline needed changing.  Instead what I have seen is what <br/>
happened here, the original poster felt misunderstood, and usually <br/>
gets defensive.  Others get angry at the thought of a child being <br/>
hurt or at the thought of someone judging their parenting techniques. <br/>
Emotions run high on both sides of the issue.  When it all dies down, <br/>
people are hurt, their feelings of trust in each other has been <br/>
eroded. Some people leave the list in hurt and/or anger.  Others <br/>
decide it is best if they become lurkers.  The end result is the <br/>
wisdom that each of us can gain from this list is diminished. <br/>
