<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034567644">&lt;&lt;If he wanted to LEARN to write better, he&#39;d be WRITING all the time,  <br/>
trying to do it better and better. It would be on his OWN initiative,  <br/>
he would not need to ask you for help with that unless he needed you  <br/>
to get him paper or pens or something concrete like help him find  <br/>
writing samples to trace or copy.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This has made sense for us.<br/>
<br/>
One of my sons received a letter from a friend the same age. Hhe noted that she had written in cursive - he prints. He said he wanted to write in cursive like Phoebe, so he asked me to get him a handwriting book, like the ones he&#39;d seen in Borders. He works on this book, off and on - but *he was the one who came up with the diea cos it is his motivation. Not making a goal per se or looking to me to set up a programme - just I want to learn this so can you get me this and I&#39;ll write in it  when I want. :-)<br/>
