Japanese manga that he likes. Ranma 1/2 is a favorite as is Osagi <br/>
Yojimbo. Casey just LOVED the books from the Spirited Away movie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130227298">For the last year it&#39;s been the Harry Potter series.  Last night I started reading them the fourth book for the fourth time.  We have June 21st on our calendar!<br/>
<br/>
The only other books they have been interested in me reading to them this past year are from the Edward Eager series.  Half Magic, Knight&#39;s Castle, The Time Garden etc.<br/>
<br/>
My eldest has been very interested in mythology the last few months so he has been reading various books on this subject. He also can&#39;t wait for his Nintendo Power magazine to show up each month, and is often be seen with his nose in a player&#39;s guide!<br/>
<br/>
For my youngest when we&#39;re reading alone it&#39;s anything Scooby-Doo. :)<br/>
<br/>
I picked up the Chronicles of Narnia book series and though nobody has been interested in hearing me read them, they really enjoyed the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe video (a BBC production) I found at the library.  They liked it so much I picked up the DVDs a few weeks ago that has the BBC productions of 4 of the 7 books (3 DVDs).  The older two loved it and sat through the last 3 in a row, about 6-7 hours I think it was, including popcorn breaks ;)<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 11, 9, and 5.<br/>
