<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191138466">Okay kids, here are your new words for the day:<br/>
<br/>
1.      &gt;&gt; Hebetate, v.  To make dull or obtuse.<br/>
<br/>
        He walked into the company doors a creative, energetic person, a<br/>
breath of<br/>
        fresh air; but before long, they boxed him in, forced him to abandon<br/>
his<br/>
        individuality -- one more corporate hebetation of an original<br/>
thinker&lt;&lt;<br/>

2.  Babbitt, n.  George F. Babbitt, character in the novel &quot;Babbitt&quot; (1922)<br/>
by Sinclair Lewis.  A business or professional man who conforms unthinkingly<br/>
to prevailing middle-class standards.<br/>
Source: Webster&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Additional note:  During the 1990s, the terms &quot;Babbitt&quot; and &quot;Corporate<br/>
Teamplayer&quot; have become virtually synonomous.  Today, teamplay not only has<br/>
to do with conformity on the job, but also with such things as the type of<br/>
car you drive, and other possessions you purchase, choice of leisure<br/>
activities, and worldview.<br/>
