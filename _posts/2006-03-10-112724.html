<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756733885">It&#39;s true about the red clay tea cups in India! On train rides, when you buy<br/>
a cup of chai in one of these cups, you can just throw the cup out the<br/>
window of the train when you are finished. Everyone does it. They also have<br/>
plates made out of dried banana leaves. Fresh banana leaves are used a lot<br/>
too as plates. Brilliant, if you ask me. At most tea stands glasses are<br/>
used. A chai is about 5 cents or so. You sit and drink and when you are done<br/>
return the glass to the chai wallah who washes it. I don&#39;t think I ever had<br/>
any beverage in a paper or plastic cup in India the whole 6 months I was<br/>
there. Oh, they did have mango juice boxes and water in plastic bottles, but<br/>
these were the exception. Soft drinks were always in glass bottles that one<br/>
returned after drinking. Oh yes, and spicy nuts in newspaper cones. This was<br/>
nine years ago, so maybe things have changed by now. I hope not. I was<br/>
always amazed by food containers of all sorts when I was there. Everyone had<br/>
these stainless steel lunch boxes that were essentially a pile of 4 or 5<br/>
bowls on top of one another with a stainless steel metal band that snapped<br/>
tight. People would carry 5- course meals in these things. And there was so<br/>
much natural recycling. I literally saw one tea wallah making tea in what<br/>
looked like an old paint can. One of my favorite treats were made to order<br/>
omelets right at the train station made on a sort of wok with a real fire<br/>
underneath. I can&#39;t remember what they were served on. Oh, and coconut water<br/>
right out of the coconut. Wow. I don&#39;t think I ever saw a vending machine<br/>
the whole time I was there.<br/>
