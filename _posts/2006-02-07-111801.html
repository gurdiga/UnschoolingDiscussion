<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter loves to read - and often on a trip to the library, she will<br/>
browse the &quot;classics&quot; section and has read Charles Dickens, Edgar Allen Poe<br/>
and Louisa May Alcott with me. We are currently listening to A Tale of Two<br/>
Cities on Audiobook. She also has been known to get Captain Underpants. I<br/>
think what is funny is that she doesn&#39;t have that differentiation of this is<br/>
a &quot;classic&quot; and this Captain Underpants is not. To her they are all just<br/>
books. Some are older and have more difficult language. Often she will ask<br/>
what a word means and I don&#39;t know so we&#39;ll look it up.<br/>
<br/>
I was supposed to read a lot of these books throughout high school - but I<br/>
was busy reading Stephen King. I did the cliff notes - and read the least<br/>
bit possible until I could be done. Now I am enjoying them. Even my husband<br/>
, who hated school and still barely reads for fun, will listen to something<br/>
that we have left in the car and really enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that my daughter doesn&#39;t have the issues from school with<br/>
regard to literature. She reads them because she has heard them alluded to<br/>
in movies, or another book. Some she doesn&#39;t like and takes back without<br/>
reading them and some she really likes. She also likes to cook and will<br/>
often come home with a pile of cookbooks. She made homeade pasta the other<br/>
night for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
What is funny is that the library has a Homeschooling Book Discussion Group<br/>
and last year, she went and enjoyed it. This year she hasn&#39;t seemed to like<br/>
the book choices and so has not attended. If I had made her read certain<br/>
books because the curriculum said she needed to read them NOW, she would<br/>
probably hate them - and learn to avoid anything labeled a &quot;classic&quot; as<br/>
boring and schoolish.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - the joys of Unschooling!</div>

question it, or make fun of me.  Not Captain Underpants, though I  <br/>
really like those and they&#39;re well done.   It would be picture books,  <br/>
or the time I remember best was when I checked out The Complete Works  <br/>
of Edgar Allen Poe and On Beyond Zebra, by Dr. Seuss, at the same  <br/>
time, when I was 13 / 8th grade.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t brave enough to go into a long defense, so I told my  <br/>
detractors I was going to be a teacher so I needed to be up on  <br/>
children&#39;s literature.   They settled for that, and it was true, but  <br/>
what I didn&#39;t know how to tell them was that I got it for ME, because  <br/>
I liked the art, because I liked the way he would make up words to  <br/>
get a rhyme or rhythm in the poetry, and that I had a &quot;collect the  <br/>
whole set&quot; mentality and once I&#39;d read half his stuff I felt  <br/>
compelled to read the other half.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason I remember this is that the Poe book disappeared,  <br/>
and I couldn&#39;t find it, and had to pay for it.<br/>
<br/>
Then my friend Charles Montoya shot himself.  Much trauma in all my  <br/>
social groups; his dad was our art teacher; much trauma.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks later, his dad brought me the Edgar Allen Poe book, which  <br/>
had been in Charles&#39; stuff, but had some of my papers in it.  I took  <br/>
it to the library and instead of getting a refund, wrote a dedication  <br/>
to Charles inside it.<br/>
<br/>
For me, as a kid, nearly every book had a big story.  I used to buy  <br/>
Doc Savage books with my allowance.  Those I didn&#39;t take to school,  <br/>
because not only would they have probably been confiscated, people  <br/>
would have teased me because they were &quot;boys&#39; books.&quot;   I remember  <br/>
them not for the stories, but because the books cost 50 cents, and my  <br/>
allowance was 35 cents, so my range to spend in the first week was  <br/>
only five or ten cents, if I wanted to be able to afford my book for  <br/>
sure the next week.    That was shortly before the crazy inflation of  <br/>
the 70&#39;s.  We could still get candy bars for a nickel (5 cents: note  <br/>
for Brits) or a dime (Almond Joy and Mounds were the only ten cent  <br/>
candy bars).  Bubble Gum was honestly a penny.   But I bought books  <br/>
instead.<br/>
<br/>
There just weren&#39;t books at my house, and that&#39;s why, for me, school  <br/>
and the library seemed like fairy land.  I&#39;ve often looked back and  <br/>
thought I liked school, so school must&#39;ve been good, but it was good  <br/>
in comparison to home, in several ways.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Marty came home for lunch and was watching the Tony Danza  <br/>
show.  They showed a school in Los Angeles they called &quot;the homeless  <br/>
school,&quot; and were talking to some of the kids and teachers.  They  <br/>
said for some of those kids, school was the only safe part of their  <br/>
lives, the only fun part, and I knew that feeling.   (My house was  <br/>
safe enough, but not as safe as my own children&#39;s house is.  My  <br/>
younger cousin was unpredictable and hit us sometimes, and molested  <br/>
my sister, though I didn&#39;t know until a few years later, and we were  <br/>
spanked and yelled at, but we had the possibility of privacy, at  <br/>
least, which the homeless kids seemed to lack.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when people are considering whether they want to unschool  <br/>
they&#39;re going on and on with questions about whether it will be  <br/>
perfect, whether it will be utopia.  They forget to ask whether it  <br/>
will be better than school, and whether it will be better than buying  <br/>
and trying to enforce a school in a box.  And this isn&#39;t to say I  <br/>
think they should settle for &quot;just better,&quot; but that IS the initial  <br/>
question:  What are your options, and what do you want out of this?<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have to worry about watching The Borrowers or Follow  <br/>
that Bird and Pulp Fiction (Doc Savage reminded me of that &lt;g&gt;) or a  <br/>
Jet Li movie or  Tombstone on the same day.  Marty&#39;s reading American  <br/>
Gods and Batman comics.  The book goes with him when he has to wait  <br/>
in a reception area.  He&#39;s not in a hurry to finish it, because he  <br/>
wasn&#39;t deadline trained.  His mind is devoid of &quot;semester&quot; or &quot;unit&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;book report.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I loved westerns - especially stories from a series that was CALLED,  <br/>
&quot;Western Stories for Boys.&quot; I had only sisters and we didn&#39;t own  <br/>
those books, but the across-the-street neighbor had a son one year  <br/>
old than me and HE had all kinds of books for boys.  We had the same  <br/>
wonderful babysitter, Mrs. Curl, and SHE would borrow books from  <br/>
their house and bring them to me to read when she babysat. I can&#39;t  <br/>
remember how she knew I liked them, but she was probably the only  <br/>
person who knew that.<br/>
<br/>
My dad had some books from when he was a boy and I devoured those,  <br/>
too - the Horatio Hornblower books, for example.<br/>
<br/>
But I was expected to read Nancy Drew and NOT The Hardy Boys.<br/>
<br/>
My mom collected picture books, though, and so we had a LOT of them  <br/>
and they were very respected and it was normal in our house to ooh  <br/>
and ahh over the wonderful art and great stories. I remember when I  <br/>
was in 6th grade we were all supposed to bring a favorite book to  <br/>
donate to our school library - I took &quot;Millions of Cats,&quot; which was  <br/>
beloved by my sisters and myself, and the teacher (Mrs. Gillellan)  <br/>
acted like I&#39;d made some huge faux-paux by repeatedly saying, &quot;It&#39;s  <br/>
all right that you brought a little kids&#39; book.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah - the things grown-ups, even those TRYING to be nice, can do to  <br/>
the children in their care, huh?<br/>
