 </span></blockquote>This was a discussion I had with a friend, about the fact that I <br/>
never learned all my times tables in school, though I fretted and <br/>
fussed and REALLY WANTED to know them. We had timed drills, and I <br/>
wanted to win the contest, but I still didn&#39;t learn em all until <br/>
Robby started learning his times tables five years ago...in my late <br/>
30&#39;s. Didn&#39;t NEED my times tables, much, until then. I know them all <br/>
now, and didn&#39;t have to &quot;memorize&quot; them...Robby and I just filled in <br/>
a multiplication table, and I had the whole thing. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things, btw, that convinces me that, when it is needed, <br/>
the learning will happen. It&#39;s THE WAY WE LEARN THINGS!!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Funny! (well, not the part about him hitting you over the head)<br/>
 On the other hand, my dad was so fascinated when calculators came out that<br/>
he payed some inordinate amount of money for one (then remember how cheap<br/>
they got just a couple of years later). I used one all the time as a kid (I<br/>
can still see the denim calculator cover I had and the Texas Instruments<br/>
logo) and I can do number crunching faster in my head than anyone I know.<br/>
Sometimes for kicks I race DH when he&#39;s using the calculator to figure<br/>
something out and I can usually beat him.<br/>
Both of my kids have calculators. They love to use them and when they&#39;re<br/>
fooling around with them it almost always sparks some interesting<br/>
discussions about number and number principles. With my youngest, it&#39;s<br/>
usually just that she can push and identify the numbers. With my son (6), he<br/>
has discovered all kinds of things by using the calculator. Like when you<br/>
multiply an even number and an odd number, you always get an even number,<br/>
but when you add an even number to an odd number, you always get an odd<br/>
number. I think calculators can really allow kids to see things like bigger<br/>
patterns that they might not get to see if they just sat down with paper and<br/>
pen. Also, they let my kids work with numbers bigger than they could<br/>
personally add/subtract/mutiply/divide on their own, so they get to see<br/>
patterns with bigger numbers as well. Like the fact that when you multiply<br/>
something by a multiple of 10, you get the same number but with<br/>
correspondingly more zeros on the end.<br/>
I dunno, I love to do math in my head all the time, and I think owning a<br/>
calculator as a kid helped to fuel that.<br/>
