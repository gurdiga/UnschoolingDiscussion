&gt; the ninety and nine to go after that one lost lamb (that story never made <br/>
&gt; good sense in any way). <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know......that can read......never mind...... I guess that I will never <br/>
get why some don&#39;t feel that all are equally valid.... Why does it just have <br/>
to be one way one belief?<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Brenda........(some tidbits)<br/>
You personally find spiritual fulfillment differently.........  <br/>
I would suggest that the<br/>
fact that it works for them makes it an equally valid path to spiritual<br/>
fulfillment.    <br/>
Please don&#39;t<br/>
judge my choice of path.<br/>
<br/>
brenda<br/>

<br/>
I guess that, that will never happen......People condemning other faiths or <br/>
telling them that there path is the only way.<br/>
I guess that there will always religious wars.<br/>
Because I may not accept Jesus the way that a lot of people do, does not <br/>
condemn me in anyway. I will not be brown beated to feel that way....I have <br/>
gotten stronger in that phase, but still having the battle to totally leave <br/>
the religion that I am in because of friends.<br/>
This is the problem that I have with organized religions. If you don&#39;t follow <br/>
this way...you are condemned.  This is not so.....The arrogance in some of <br/>
the religions......My way is the best and only way....No<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just this way and attitude is the reason why I flea......I feel that <br/>
there is a better way than all of this bickering and fighting over the way <br/>
that people should believe or have faith.<br/>
I will probably get hammered by some of the Christians here, because I have <br/>
chosen a different path, but so be it.....<br/>
I guess the Hindus,  Jews, Muslims, Buddas,  Bahia&#39;s,Shikes (sp), wiccans, <br/>
pagans,etc., are condemned......hockey-puck!<br/>
I can live with those that feel that their belief is bigger and better than <br/>
anyone else&#39;s. That&#39;s the way that they feel, and they are entitled. Some <br/>
really show their arrogance too.<br/>
There is one thing that I know now (I didn&#39;t know it then) about all the <br/>
different denominations and the belief structure.<br/>
Then I have the the Holy Grail (the true lineage f Jesus) and other things <br/>
like What did Jesus Really Say, etc.......<br/>
I cannot be persuaded on Jon that one. I did love the Jewish view on Jesus <br/>
and I have read about that in other books as well. I agreed with ALL of <br/>
it.....<br/>
I guess my next mission is to study about Judaism......<br/>
I don&#39;t mind studying them because I feel all are accepted.<br/>
Acceptance is the key.......ALot have not learn that yet.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you were in a burning building and you knew from studying the building<br/>
plan that the only way out was the path you were on and all the other<br/>
seeming exits led to dead ends and death, wouldn&#39;t you want to tell everyone<br/>
they were on the wrong path?<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think they&#39;re working from a distorted interpretation of<br/>
another person&#39;s description of the building. There&#39;s loads of exits and I<br/>
don&#39;t even think the building&#39;s on fire ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Of course I know where they think that thinking will lead me!<br/>

There are vast numbers of groups throughout history that could make this<br/>
same claim.<br/>
Charles Manson&#39;s &quot;Family&quot; could claim the same.<br/>
