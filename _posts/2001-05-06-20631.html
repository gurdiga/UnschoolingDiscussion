<div id="ygrps-yiv-11416914">Helen.... I have received my HEM today...  :)<br/>
After.... going to the nearby pond to check on the (heee...heeee....)<br/>
Canadian Goose that was nesting there (we&#39;ve been checking to see when<br/>
the eggs will hatch)...and finding NOTHING...the nest empty, and no<br/>
sightings of either male or female, and only finding an egg which we<br/>
don&#39;t think belongs to the goose, and then letting go the tadpoles<br/>
(almost to frog stage) and salamanders that we having been watching<br/>
develop, and then walking home with the new puppy in the dark and<br/>
realizing the fireflies were out (hooray!) and watching the bats swoop,<br/>
and then coming in for homemade yogurt pops while I read Pippi<br/>
Longstocking, and the tucking in all three little kiddies, I FINALLY<br/>
settled down to read my HEM....  Ahhhhh....<br/>
I love the rabid duck.  Of course ever since you mentioned it here, I&#39;ve<br/>
been waiting for it....<br/>
What a wonderful article, not only funny, but oh so true....  My<br/>
compliments to Melanie!<br/>
Now, I&#39;m off to read Jeff&#39;s article...Of course I&#39;m somewhat<br/>
disapointed...I was really thinking &quot;bum&quot; as in the european take on<br/>
this word....ah well....and old Mom can dream can&#39;t she??  LOL<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d let you know I am sitting out on my back porch in the<br/>
wonderful NC evening thoroughly enjoying my HEM, I always wish it never<br/>
ended, and sort of hoard it by reading it slowly and deliberately.....<br/>
HA, ha....<br/>
