A friend of mine called this morning and asked about HS. I told her I am so <br/>
glad she asked. That sometimes I feel like I am talking about this so much <br/>
that I scare her away.<br/>
I explained that what we do may or may not be where she starts but to really <br/>
think about what her goals are and where her expectations are.<br/>
She told me a story about how they got their 11 yr. old son up at 5:30 in the <br/>
am to finish a project that he had 3 months to do. They nagged him and <br/>
brought him to tears. I asked what her concern about the project was and she <br/>
said she was worried about grades and how he would look if he didn&#39;t finish <br/>
it. But realized after how much pressure and stress they put on him and how <br/>
much all that was affecting their family. &lt;sign&gt; I told her I think it is <br/>
absolutely unnecessary to spend three months on Thomas Edison (sp?) and that <br/>
because her son wanted no part of doing this report that he was never going <br/>
to remember any thing of what he learned later in life but just that stupid <br/>
report that I got yelled at over.  <br/>
Two years of hinting here and there I think she is finally seeing the light. <br/>
I am so happy for her I could run over there and hug her! I think I will.....<br/>
I know this is just the beginning of her journey and there will be a lot of <br/>
bumps but I am so thrilled she is finally seeing that there is another way.<br/>

&gt; &gt;The best way in the world to unschool, that I have seen, is to live your <br/>
&gt; &gt;life <br/>
&gt; &gt;beside your children and to support them in living their own<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kathryn, that was a great post, and I forwarded that to some friends that <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; questioning unschooling possibilities. I have them reading at <br/>
&gt; unschooling.com <br/>
&gt; and Sandra&#39;s articles, but that was great!<br/>
