<div id="ygrps-yiv-213216993">Yappy yap lady again!  Ijust read another digest, egads!<br/>
<br/>
i am seeing a lot of people from Ohio in here.  I am in Lorain County!  Hey, <br/>
here is an idea.  I am going to Akron&#39;s Inventure Place on June 23rd with a <br/>
bunch of other Hs&#39;ers.  Would any of you like to come?????  It would be great <br/>
to meet those who homeschool outside of the box :-)  If not here, maybe we <br/>
could plan a get together sometime in the next month or so.  let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else going to Gettybrug for the re-enactments????<br/>
<br/>
Our house is open too to those who would like to come see Ohio!  In addition <br/>
to what MAry Ellen (I think) mentioned, we have Oberlin where the underground <br/>
railroad was very active, we have President Garfield&#39;s house.  we have the <br/>
birthplace of Thomas Edison.  We have the islands were battles were fought in <br/>
some war, hahahaha, here you can see glacial carvings and Indian <br/>
inscriptions.  we have Indian Trails Cavern (and many other caverns) where <br/>
the is an archeological dig is going on.  they have found artifacts dating <br/>
back 12,000 years there!  Of course, the beautiful Amish countryside and <br/>
wonderful traditions.  Water Parks, theme Parks.  Not to mention our big back <br/>
yard where this always some kind of science experiment going on :-) and we <br/>
have a pool!!!!!!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
We would love to host and guide anyone who would like to come visit here and <br/>
soak up some good experiences.  we have a 120 year old farm house and a lush <br/>
garden on a real peaceful street.  We are surrounded by the woods and close <br/>
to all the places I mentioned and more.  The boys won&#39;t mind giving up there <br/>
room, they like having sleepovers with mom and dad!  So we have an extra <br/>
bedrrom with a bunk bed, full sized futon, and cushion mat available for your <br/>
lodging!  or the kids can camp out in the tree house or the tent! <br/>
<br/>
Come, come to Ohio..... :-)<br/>
