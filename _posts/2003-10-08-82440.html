I keep meaning to link all the newer pages.<br/>

I think it&#39;s linked from SandraDodd.com/life<br/>
(which isn&#39;t linked from the unschooling main page, but should be)<br/>
<br/>
and it&#39;s SandraDodd.com/typical<br/>

I&#39;ve tried to name things obviously so sometimes guessing will help!  <br/>
The endings are things like<br/>
/unschooing<br/>
/tv<br/>
/math<br/>
/reading<br/>
/articles<br/>
<br/>
but some are not as great like<br/>
/games/page<br/>
/TinyMonsters  (I should never have used caps on anything; I learned)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388557887">Have you considered turning your site into a blog? I use MovableType for<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://culturekitchen.com">http://culturekitchen.com</a><br/>

A blog, or weblog, is a content management system that basically allows  <br/>
you to update your site any day, anytime, without having to think about  <br/>
broken links and the like. The system is actually is software that  <br/>
manages content through a database, and the design and structure of the  <br/>
site separately through templates. It sounds complicated but with  <br/>
TypePad it is extremely easy to use. If you know how to use webmail  <br/>
from Hotmail and Yahoo, you can easily learn how to use this system. I  <br/>
absolutely swear by it. And the advantages are absolutely endless: you  <br/>
can easily syndicate the content of your site and have people read you  <br/>
side by side their morning feed of BBC-News or Wired News. It&#39;s just an  <br/>
awesome technology.<br/>
<br/>
Check it out here:<br/>

<br/>
If you are interested I can even pass you a life-time 20% discount  <br/>
code. And no, I do not get paid anything for this plug :-) I just love  <br/>
blogs and love TypePad. It rocks.<br/>

<br/>
So you use a code for a website and it will update it if you change it in one <br/>
place, or what?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to spend more than I&#39;m already spending to have no pop-ups and <br/>
my own domain name.  $8 a month or something already.   But I&#39;m interested.<br/>
<br/>
I do my stuff &quot;by hand,&quot; and I don&#39;t use templates or a formatting program.  <br/>
I used to, on  expage, but I&#39;m having more fun doing it myself.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer my scanner&#39;s broken.  I really liked what I was doing when it wasn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>

short, frequently updated posts that are arranged chronologically. Blog <br/>
is similar to a online journal or &quot;what&#39;s new&quot; page. A blog can be used <br/>
for a wide variety of purposes from news, diaries, poetry, recepies to <br/>
project schedules. A blog is a communication tool to keep everyone <br/>
posted on topics of interest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey<br/>
<br/>
There are many reasons why it makes sense to switch to a blog:<br/>
<br/>
1. It is easier to change the design globally on a site. You do very <br/>
little with the HTML ina blog. For design yoou deal with Cascading <br/>
Style Sheets (.CSS documents). Check out this site so you can see what <br/>
happens when, all you can change in a website is its style sheet. In <br/>
these sites, the people could not touch the HTML nor the CONTENT.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://csszengarden.com">http://csszengarden.com</a><br/>
<br/>
OK, those people are pros but it goes to show how important it is to <br/>
manage the design of a site separately from its HMTL and content.<br/>
<br/>
These are not done by pros but dedicated  independent writers:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nyc.blogs.com">http://nyc.blogs.com</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://machinitis.typepad.com/">http://machinitis.typepad.com/</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.puzzleblog.com/">http://www.puzzleblog.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Once the design is taken care of, all you have to do is type in the <br/>
content on the post forms (which are the same as webmail @ Yahoo or <br/>
Hotmail).<br/>
<br/>
3. The systems create standards complaint pages, meaning, it will make <br/>
sure it is readable in as many web browsers are possible.<br/>
<br/>
4. They create RSS files that make it easier for news readers to pick <br/>
up your articles. RSS is short for Real Simple Syndication. No <br/>
self-respecting content-developer (aka writer) would publish on the web <br/>
w/o making it easy to broadcast around the web. You&#39;ve been around long <br/>
enough and have quite a niche that you do not have to worry. BUT if you <br/>
wanted to make it easier for people outside the unschooling niche to <br/>
reach you through Google searches. Imagine if someone googling <br/>
&quot;unschooling + spanking&quot; found you on the first page if not the top of <br/>
the list. Could scare those advocates away.<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways to manipulate what happens with spiders on the <br/>
WWWeb. Spiders go out searching for a sites keywords and its referring <br/>
links. That&#39;s how the search engines rate sites. The way to make this <br/>
work more to your advantage is with web pages that are easy for the <br/>
bots to read (hence the W3 standards issue) and for people to link to <br/>
your pages (hence the advantage of templates in blogss because they <br/>
generate all the internal architecture of a site automatically. You&#39;ll <br/>
never have to deal with broken links ever again. It&#39;s sweet.<br/>
<br/>
As to prices, check out what Typepad has. With my 20% discounts, you <br/>
can get a blog for as little as $4 a month or as high as $12. You get a <br/>
.typepad subdomain that you can easily map to your current one <br/>
(sandradodd.com) so that the transition is smooth. I suggest you try it <br/>
out for the free month and see how it feels. Oh, and with their system, <br/>
you can easily create photoblogs as well.<br/>

What do you mean &quot;all you can change in a website is its style sheet&quot;??<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Imagine if someone googling <br/>

<br/>
My site DOES come up first on google.<br/>
Top of the list.<br/>

Did you think it wasn&#39;t going to show up on the first page?  (I guess you <br/>
did.)<br/>

<br/>
If my site works without being rated by a search engine (HONESTLY, I don&#39;t <br/>
know what you mean by most of what you wrote), what&#39;s my advantage?<br/>
<br/>
My sites come up on Google perfectly well.  Sometimes it takes a few days or <br/>
a week for it to be found, but once it is, it&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I suggest you try it <br/>
out for the free month and see how it feels.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have over 100 pages.  I&#39;m not changing all that.  It&#39;s not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Oh, and with their system, <br/>
you can easily create photoblogs as well.&gt;&gt;<br/>

I don&#39;t want to create a site for other people to post their photos, if <br/>

Funny story about this...<br/>
<br/>
Casey and I met a mom and daughter at a UU Fellowship we&#39;ve been <br/>
going to since we moved. I invited the girl over to play here one day <br/>
and the mom seemed a little hesistant on the phone since she had <br/>
never been here before and didn&#39;t really know us very well. She <br/>
confessed to me later that she Googled me that night to check me out. <br/>
Sandra&#39;s site came up right away and the mom got some peaceful and <br/>
encouraging info about me. Thanks Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
