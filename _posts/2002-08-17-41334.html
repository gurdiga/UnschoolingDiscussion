&gt; I love your posts Kim. Such honesty and openess.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ren, thanks so much. I was wondering how it was coming across. Thanks for <br/>
understanding my plight.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am also drawn to my native roots, though my family isn&#39;t sure of the <br/>
&gt; tribe. <br/>
&gt; Ojibwa most likely (I had thought it was Cherokee all this time). <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometime it comes to you in your dreams....<br/>
Are all of a sudden that thought or feeling is there.<br/>
I have a &gt; book I think you should get, it&#39;s called &quot;Wisdom Keepers&quot; and has <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; words of wisdom from leaders of various tribes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks..... I jotted it down on my book list....<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep the faith girl, follow your heart, it&#39;s leading you home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The problem is that I am not sure if I should trust my heart.......I resist a <br/>
lot. Even though I am tired and want that freeness....I still fight and <br/>
resist which I do not understand......<br/>
I keep telling myself that you have to let go and get over this, but just <br/>
can&#39;t do it.......<br/>
Maybe in time.....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thanks for the encouragement though Ren. It is very appreciative.......<br/>
