<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643963747">Hey!  Don&#39;t badmouth Flylady!  <br/>
Go to her homepage, click on Flying Lessons, and read about shining your <br/>
sink.  Sure, she mentions filling it with water, adding bleach, using a <br/>
toothbrush and dental floss if necessary.  But she&#39;s talking about how to <br/>
clean even the oldest sinks.  And at the end of the paragraph she says <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; You have already done the hard part. You will never have to go through this <br/>
&gt; process again. Daily maintenance will keep it looking this way all the time<br/>
    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>She says she just rubs it down with a dry rag at night. <br/>
Flylady was the kick in the pants I needed to start getting my home under <br/>
control.  I don&#39;t follow her &quot;religiously&quot;, but I get lots of good ideas <br/>
there.  There are LOADS of people on this list, and for those who haven&#39;t <br/>
heard of her, I didn&#39;t want anyone left with the impression that her advice <br/>
was irresponsible.<br/>
<br/>
Please read this letter in the lighthearted way it was intended.  I&#39;m not <br/>
scolding you.  Sometimes it is SO HARD to get a message across &quot;the right <br/>
way&quot; in e-mail.<br/>
