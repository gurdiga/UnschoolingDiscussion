<div id="ygrps-yiv-77747242">Wow Julie!  That&#39;s scary!  And I thought our mosquitoes were bad!  At least <br/>
we generally only have a problem outdoors.  I can&#39;t even imagine!<br/>

***I live in a small country town in Western Australia. We have about 4<br/>
different species of venomous snakes in our area and three of those happen<br/>
to be in the top ten of world&#39;s most venomous snakes. Lucky huh?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve only had one in the house so far and I was the one who fell over it<br/>
which was good. My daughter at the time was 2 yrs and it could have easily<br/>
been her.<br/>
