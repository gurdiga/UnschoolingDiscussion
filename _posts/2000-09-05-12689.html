<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532211227">Well, they should take pictures of the kidlets when we &quot;un&quot; school shop. <br/>
All the other kids are out school shopping, so we do lists of project and<br/>
go and buy kits and plans and fun stuff to do.  We just bought one of those<br/>
little sticker cameras and youngest kidlet is going to do cyclist licenses<br/>
(she says that way she can give her brother a ticket for parking his<br/>
bicycle where it doesn&#39;t belong) and passport for her dolls so they can<br/>
travel the world.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the pictures would be of happy kids who AREN&#39;T going to school.<br/>
