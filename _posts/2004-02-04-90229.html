<div id="ygrps-yiv-341388550">My first time posting here.  Hi ya&#39;ll!  My 11yo plays in teams <br/>
sports.  Her fav is softball.  I find myself getting overly involved <br/>
and sometimes embarrassed by my own words that some how just pop out <br/>
of my mouth before my brain before my brain gets a chance to capture <br/>
them and edit.  I could not tolerate sitting in the car (nor did dd <br/>
like it) so I bring a book.  When I feel worked up, I read.  It has <br/>
worked every time.  Bring my BP back down to normal in no time.<br/>
<br/>
I kinda worry about the mom who&#39;s son won&#39;t let her forget that she <br/>
missed two games in all those years.  And you missed because you were <br/>
in childbirth or shortly after?  I hope he is tongue in cheek teasing <br/>
his mom.  Please.  Will he be sensitive to a wife during and after <br/>
labor if he isn&#39;t to his own mom?  He WAS teasing, right?</div>
