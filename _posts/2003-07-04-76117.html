<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611008169">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We were talking about what to do when we&#39;re invited to parties or <br/>
get-togethers and it&#39;s clear the kids aren&#39;t included. I have boys 10 and 6  <br/>
and there are times they&#39;d just as soon go hang out with a friend&#39;s family <br/>
as be with me when I have a social occasion. About once every eight months I <br/>
host my book discussion group in our home, for instance, and I arrange for <br/>
them to have the afternoon to play at a friend&#39;s house. They could stay here <br/>
but I do think they have more fun the other way.<br/>
<br/>
However, one thing that really disturbs me is my mother asking that I come <br/>
visit her without the kids. She&#39;s the same way with my brother and sister... <br/>
always acting all flattered when we visit without the kids. She&#39;s also <br/>
reluctant to be in my house with the kids and DH, who works at home, around <br/>
all the time.  She wants me to herself. I feel a little offended that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want the kids around, since they are really good people and they <br/>
love her so much.<br/>
<br/>
This is actually becoming a bone of contention between us. She&#39;s always <br/>
saying things like, &quot;Don&#39;t you get any time to yourself?&quot; or, if the guys <br/>
are off somewhere with their dad when she calls, &quot;Oh, how nice, you have <br/>
some time alone.&quot; I find it off-putting.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s actually made me realize that she spent my childhood doing her best to <br/>
keep me and my brother out of her hair. She was always finding toys, games <br/>
or activities we were to do without her, and we were supposed to be upstairs <br/>
and out of the way at a certain time of the evening. Which also makes me <br/>
sad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This could have nothing to do with it, but I was raised in the late 60&#39;s and <br/>
70&#39;s, graduated in 82.  During those times there was a big shift from mom as <br/>
happy homemaker to people needing to &quot;find themselves&quot; (anyone else remember <br/>
that phrase??)  More women were being pushed into careers (other than being a <br/>
mom) and I think &quot;just&quot; being a mom began to be looked down at.  Society was <br/>
telling moms &quot;you need time to yourself.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
When I was in about 8th grade my mom got a part time job, and by the time I <br/>
was in highschool she was working full time.  Even though we had more money, I <br/>
hated it and I know my sister (younger than I) hated it even more.  Many of <br/>
our parents were just repeating what everyone was telling them, what they were <br/>
hearing from &quot;experts&quot; for years (parents need to get away, &quot;find themselves&quot;). <br/>
 I hate to blame that generation of moms because the whole idea of seperating <br/>
themselves from their children was being pushed on them hard.  My mom has <br/>
since seen that the proof is in the pudding...my kids are happy, well adjusted, <br/>
funny, nice to be around.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be a generation of grandmothers getting our panties in a bunch because <br/>
we DON&#39;T want our grandchildren fed with formula or put in school, or left <br/>
with sitters (unless the sitter is us and the kids WANT to stay :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your post made me think... a lot... I don&#39;t have any grandchildren, yet.  I <br/>
do have a son who&#39;s been with the same girl for seven years in a committed <br/>
relationship, just not married.  They come almost every night for supper or <br/>
dessert.  They almost always go on every family trip or outing with us.  BUT that <br/>
being said, I LOVE time alone with my son.  I am VERY flattered when he will <br/>
call and invite me to lunch, just him and myself.  I love it when he will ask me <br/>
if I want to go shopping with just him.  I don&#39;t try to orchestrate being <br/>
alone with him without Carrisa but it is a TREAT for me.  As much as we love our <br/>
children now, we love them and cherish them equally when they are grown, I do <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I know my MIL always tells me they are meant to grow up and out and on their <br/>
own and see their parents on Sundays for an hour.  If my child chooses to do <br/>
this, well that&#39;s fine but so far that doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s likely to happen. <br/>
 Her son, my DH sees her maybe once or twice a year, whenever I think I can <br/>
stand it (she doesn&#39;t like our children, I don&#39;t like people who don&#39;t like my <br/>
children).<br/>
<br/>
I will be very cautious about time alone with my children after reading your <br/>
post.  It never occurred to me that a child would find it offensive to spend <br/>
alone time with their parent.  I can see that if she never wants to welcome <br/>
your children or spouse into the mix it could be a serious problem, much like <br/>
with my MIL.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for making me think about something I&#39;ve never considered in my <br/>
family dynamics.<br/>

I dread the day, and there&#39;s no option for me but heavy substance abuse or <br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that I would be able to smile about being asked to keep a distraught <br/>
baby and learn to sterilize bottles just for the occasion so that one of my <br/>
kids could go do something frivolous is hard to eve write down, so I&#39;m hoping <br/>
it doesn&#39;t happen!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I tell my kids not to have kids unless they can&#39;t stand the idea of NOT <br/>
having kids.   If they are undecided, take it as a no.  If they wake up dreaming <br/>
they had a child and they&#39;re sad when they realize it was only a dream, take <br/>
that as a yes.<br/>
<br/>
But I tell everybody that who even remotely asks me whether they should have <br/>
a child.  My default answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish I hadn&#39;t.  When they hurt, when they&#39;re crying about the <br/>
unfairness of the world, I wish I had used birth control and let that pain end <br/>
with my own.<br/>

NOT want to put them in public school.  We&#39;ve also talked about breastfeeding, <br/>
and she wants to.  But she is my very unschooled hippy-type roll with the <br/>
punches daughter...very upbeat, lives outside the box, didn&#39;t want to go to <br/>
college.  She&#39;s 19.  My best, BEST advice to her, which I give often (hope I&#39;m not <br/>
nagging) is to STAY OUT OF DEBT.  If you have a child, and you&#39;re in debt, you <br/>
will have to continue working to pay your bills.  And realize that &quot;things&quot; <br/>
are just that...things.  Control your spending, differentiate between  your <br/>
wants and needs.  Think twice before buying.  Put your future kids first now, <br/>
don&#39;t get in over your head.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I knew a few police officers and their wives who chose not to have children, <br/>
and they were very happy.  One couple took their tax refunds and went to a <br/>
different country on vacation every year.  Last time I had talked to him they had <br/>
visited something like 30 countries (some on the same vacation).  My aunt and <br/>
uncle were unable to have children, but had (and still have) a very happy, <br/>
fulfilled life.  They have always been everyone favorite aunt and uncle, and <br/>
were wonderful to us when we were children...so fun to be around.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what it is that makes people feel they HAVE to have children.  <br/>
Instinct?<br/>

Oh.  Of those who have children on purpose, those reasons above are probably <br/>
the major two.<br/>
<br/>
The OTHER 75 percent of the population just makes up reasons after the fact <br/>
to avoid telling kids &quot;When I found out I was pregnant I cried for a week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my theory based on people who&#39;ve told me how they felt about <br/>

You&#39;re lucky you and your son do things alone for a positive reason.  I&#39;m <br/>
guessing (hoping) that lots of homeschooling/unschooling families will have that <br/>
advantage too, instead of the desperation to leave that seems to have become <br/>
traditional in this culture.  I don&#39;t know if it came with school or with mean <br/>
discipline or how related those two are, but it&#39;s very sad and it&#39;s great to <br/>
hear of families where it&#39;s NOT the rule.<br/>

end of every visit--but only if dh was around. We (MIL and I) get along <br/>
great if dh isn&#39;t around, but I wasn&#39;t catching on and she wasn&#39;t saying <br/>
that she wanted time with JUST HIM.<br/>

Now I engineer it so I take the kids off for 3 hours a day (they need <br/>
rest time, you know) and everyone gets along great!<br/>
