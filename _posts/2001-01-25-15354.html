<br>
<br>My mother only had one child. &nbsp;She always had a spotless house that she 
<br>cleaned, scrubbed and polished all day long on Friday&#39;s when I was a child. &nbsp;
<br>She also did all the laundry on the same day; it never sat in a basket 
<br>unfolded or not put away. &nbsp;There was never any clutter around on the counter 
<br>or in the bedroom. &nbsp;Everything had a place and everything was in its place - 
<br>always.
<br>
<br>I have three children. &nbsp;I had them in 4 ½ years. &nbsp;They are now 7 ½,
<br>5 and 3, two boys and a girl; in that order. &nbsp;I clean when I can; mostly when 
<br>I absolutely have to! &nbsp;My laundry rarely gets completed on the same day it is 
<br>started; often a basket may sit waiting to be folded or put away. &nbsp;Piles of 
<br>clutter decorate my kitchen and bedroom, they get smaller and bigger, but 
<br>never seem to disappear completely.
<br>
<br>My mom made home cooked meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. &nbsp;I was a 
<br>teenager when she went back to work full-time and then my dad took over, 
<br>cooking dinner each night.
<br>
<br>The breakfasts I prepare come out of a box and sometimes go into the toaster 
<br>oven. &nbsp;Lunches may be prepared; but a few stops for fast food during the week 
<br>is common. &nbsp;Dinner, since we live in a mother-daughter house with my parents, 
<br>is still home cooked - by my dad. &nbsp;Or we go out, mostly all together.
<br>
<br>My mom knew that when she put something away it would remain there. &nbsp;If she 
<br>cleaned, I knew better than to mess it up and would be careful with what I 
<br>did play with and of course, always put it away. &nbsp;She could count on peace 
<br>and quiet when she needed it - one child to hush usually does listen well.
<br>
<br>I know the minute I pick up the Legos they will be out again. &nbsp;The puzzles 
<br>will be dumped and the toys will be littered throughout the house. &nbsp;I can 
<br>count on the bathroom floor and the toilet being piddled on minutes after 
<br>&quot;the big clean&quot; or the &quot;quick wipe up&quot;. &nbsp;Getting a few minutes peace to call 
<br>the insurance company or a doctor&#39;s office is a trick when there are little 
<br>personalities reacting with each other all day.
<br>
<br>My mom was the greatest mom around. &nbsp;She was young and I always considered 
<br>her a &quot;cool&quot; mom, unlike friends who were embarrassed by theirs. &nbsp;She always 
<br>managed to have time for me in spite of the fact that she kept a &quot;perfect&quot; 
<br>house. &nbsp;I know the reality is that one child, as opposed to three, made that 
<br>an easier task but there are some days when the guilt of not living up to the 
<br>example she set weighs very heavy on my mind. &nbsp;Not only when she gives a 
<br>disapproving gaze around the house, but when I take a good look also. &nbsp;Most 
<br>days there just isn&#39;t time to do it all. &nbsp;It seems impossible stay ahead of 
<br>their needs and to keep the house looking under control.
<br>
<br>But mostly I find that I have made a choice.
<br>
<br>Instead of cleaning, I choose to let my kids sit on my lap and watch cartoons 
<br>with them. &nbsp;I know all the characters and all the stories. &nbsp;Unlike friends I 
<br>have, I am never surprised by what my kids have on the television. &nbsp;Nothing 
<br>they watch has missed Mom&#39;s review first. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Instead of vacuuming today, I read my kids a story. &nbsp;My eldest was an early 
<br>reader and I expect his brother, my middle son to be the same. &nbsp;My daughter 
<br>often hands me a book and climbs into my lap. &nbsp;They love to be read to and 
<br>love to read to me. &nbsp;I am so happy to have passed on to them something I 
<br>loved so much from my childhood.
<br>
<br>Instead of doing the rest of the laundry, I sang the Hokey Pokey and we all 
<br>danced.
<br>
<br>I guess I take after my mom after all.
