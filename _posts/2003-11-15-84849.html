<br/>

&lt;&lt;On the other hand,I am <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
at Nintendo Star Fox, or the like... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My boys have never had limits.  They&#39;re now 17 and 14, and fully capable of <br/>
interacting with adults and children in all kinds of impressive ways.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I think it might be <br/>
<br/>
appropriate to set limits on the amount of media time daily.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I have used Media privledges as a successful motivator <br/>
<br/>
to get specific studying completed. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That sounds really awful to me.<br/>
&quot;Successful&quot; had to do with your desire to check something off a list, not <br/>
&quot;success&quot; in the future happiness and soul-peace of your children, I think.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But In unschooling this will be unnecessary. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Detrimental.<br/>
It was detrimental before, but I suppose something has caused you to change <br/>
your approach.  <br/>
<br/>
I have reading to recommend.  Most of it is the writings of unschooling <br/>
parents.  For some reason Mario isn&#39;t playing his song (he was last week so maybe <br/>
it&#39;s a temporary thing).<br/>

Decide on your favorit ice cream.  I want you to go buy about 5 gallons of<br/>
it.  Starting first thing in the morning start eating ice cream, eat nothing<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then you&#39;ve caught on a lot quicker than most people! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It also helps to play and watch with them enough to be familiar with what<br/>
they enjoy and understand their enjoyment enough to appreciate it. (Though<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s a kid thing and we just have to accept it ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And to make sure there are opportunities that are even better to them than<br/>
TV so they aren&#39;t choosing TV and games because they&#39;re the best of a boring<br/>
lot of options.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have read that <br/>

&gt; else...Has this been anyone&#39;s experience?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. My daughter has free rein of the TV and video games. She goes on binges<br/>
sometimes. For a year she watched a lot of TV and now watches little. She<br/>
said she had writers block and now is back to writing. She plays video games<br/>
a lot when they&#39;re new. And despite having 5 systems, the amount of time<br/>
they&#39;ve been on in the past two months is maybe an hour or two.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On the other hand,I am<br/>
&gt; having some serious fears that my boys will become adults adept only<br/>
&gt; at Nintendo Star Fox, or the like<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think about that and what you&#39;re basing that theory on. Do you know of kids<br/>
who grew up in supportive, loving, vibrant homes who turned into adult Star<br/>
Fox junkies?<br/>
<br/>
And, additionally, have you played it? Do you know what&#39;s involved in being<br/>
adept at it?<br/>
<br/>
Games are only fun as long as they&#39;re challenging. Once something&#39;s been<br/>
mastered, people want to move on. If they&#39;re still playing, then the game is<br/>
still challenging. (Or they&#39;re getting something out of it like a feeling of<br/>
competency at being able to do something.)<br/>
<br/>
If it were chess you probably wouldn&#39;t worry! But many games are as<br/>
challenging as chess with all the strategies and potential moves that are<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ... And I think it might be<br/>
&gt; appropriate to set limits on the amount of media time daily.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if your husband decided you could only read for 15 mintues a day? How<br/>
would it affect your relationship with him? How would you feel about those<br/>
precious 15 mintues? Wouldn&#39;t you make sure you got your 15 mintues every<br/>
single day? And wouldn&#39;t you often push the time limit, reading beyond 15<br/>
mintues until he demanded you stop?<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you want your sons to feel around TV and video games?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In the past, I have used Media privledges as a successful motivator<br/>
&gt; to get specific studying completed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if your husband said you could read for a whole hour if you did<br/>
something he felt was important but you felt was a waste of time, like<br/>
scrubbing the garage floor daily? How would you feel about him and the<br/>
garage floor? Do you think it likely that, when he wasn&#39;t around to make<br/>
you, you&#39;d scrub the garage floor every day?<br/>
<br/>
Making and bribing kids do something we think is important is often a good<br/>
way to make sure they avoid it when they are away from us and on their own.<br/>
So if you want a good way to make them not want to do math once they&#39;re out<br/>
of the house, then you should make them do an hour a day. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think a life lived without being made and bribed to do what someone else<br/>
thinks is important is a much more joyful life and a better way to build<br/>
relationships with kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990133398">Hi Monica<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve gotten some really good advice already. Just thought I&#39;d throw <br/>
my .02 in, because I&#39;ve been where you are.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, you sound like where I&#39;ve been for the nearly one year since <br/>
I dropped curriculum completely. I&#39;ve been letting the kids play as <br/>
much computer as they want, but holding on to this notion that they <br/>
could be spending their time better...which, even though I didn&#39;t <br/>
really voice it out loud (i.e. &quot;Okay, offa there, NOW!&quot;)...my <br/>
attitude was leaking into my relationship with especially my 10 year <br/>
old boy.<br/>
<br/>
One difference in our life right now: we live in the country and have <br/>
made a committment not to run as much, until we get moved to an area <br/>
where you don&#39;t have to run to get to lessons and community events. <br/>
This means, there just isn&#39;t much variety for my kids to choose from, <br/>
thus they are playing computer and watching videos a LOT. I know, if <br/>
there was more to offer, they&#39;d be choosing otherwise more often.<br/>
<br/>
As it is, though Sonic the Hedgehog seems to be dominating their <br/>
time, I have truly changed my mind about it...very recently, in fact. <br/>
When I translated computer games into bicycle riding, I realized my <br/>
attitude about it was silly. &quot;Oh no! My boy is riding his bike, all <br/>
day LONG!&quot; as if that was a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
Well, he is WAY into Sonic, but it hasn&#39;t ruined his ability to do <br/>
all kinds of other things. As a matter of fact, the VCR is on the <br/>
fritz right now, so TV is out, and he just hauled out the Legos to <br/>
play with. He didn&#39;t stand there twitching or whining about nothing <br/>
to do (it was somebody else&#39;s turn on the computer...MINE! ;) just <br/>
got out something else to do and started doing it. (note: He used to <br/>
whine about it, when it wasn&#39;t his turn...when I was still fretting <br/>
about computer and TV time)<br/>
<br/>
He also pitched in with everyone, when we did a Massive Wood <br/>
Gathering and Log Splitting Afternoon. In fact, he is the one who <br/>
taught me how to place the wedge and whack at it with the mallet. :)<br/>
<br/>
so, after almost a year of playing as much computer as he possibly <br/>
CAN, my boy is also capable of lots of things, voluntarily chooses <br/>
things not computer, not TV, and yet is very excited about Sonic, <br/>
too. When he conquers a level, because I have expressed interest in <br/>
it (I can conquer a level in Sonic, my own self )...I am the person <br/>
he comes dashing to, all excited and proud, to tell me how he did it. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope you have a bit to chew on between the replies you&#39;ve <br/>
gotten. This was my main &quot;concern&quot; for many months, but no more. I <br/>
think it took longer because I hadn&#39;t really &quot;given up&quot; but now that <br/>
I really and truly do not fret about it, he&#39;s quickly showing that he <br/>
will turn to other things when presented.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

<br/>
Chess was the most exciting of a boring lot of things at one time in the <br/>
world. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now it&#39;s &quot;a classic&quot; and people are drawn to it because it has aesthetic <br/>
value (beautiful pieces; a history of its own in art and literature), because <br/>
grandparents approve, because there are competitions with rankings and prizes and <br/>
titles...  There is a chess culture.   It&#39;s not a harder game than other games <br/>
out there, it just has &quot;ancient and honorable&quot; roots.<br/>
<br/>

would it affect your relationship with him? How would you feel about those<br/>
precious 15 mintues?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would you like him better if he gave you an hour? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So if you want a good way to make them not want to do math once they&#39;re out<br/>
of the house, then you should make them do an hour a day. ;-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want them to do a lot of math someday when they&#39;re grown, forbid it <br/>
entirely!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431388976">Picking up a bit in the middle....<br/>
Sandra touched on  what learning chess means/has meant..<br/>
Have to mention Zoombinis -. Heard  Sandra et. all mention it and  was intrigued by their endorsements.<br/>
My ggd&#39;s are 8 years old.  They like checkers  but we havn&#39;t gotten into our Chess for Kids box.<br/>
They  had  Zoombinis  given to them this fall. Wow-  They poked around with it a bit-I&#39;m not much help-then they were off. It is all strategy- and wrapped up in a pretty neat package.  They began personalizing it-like everyone of their friends/family is a particular  Zoombini and they try to make sure different combinations get across together . <br/>
This has been the most eye-opening-&quot;unschooling&quot;  part  of computer/games for me-just to see that my old ideas of &quot;Yes, but if they learned checkers and then chess that would really  be something&quot;<br/>
They asked for the new Zoombinis for Xmas so I ordered  it from Amazonca and it is tucked away-Unless of course we hit a real dry spell before then. Some years I haul out half of the Xmas presents  before  then, just because  it seems like a good idea.<br/>
And yes they ask when  we will get to that Chess box. -I am just not  a  &quot;games&quot; person but I try. Allan  is but he doesnt play chess-maybe I should get him playing it and then he can help the girls-Aha -a plan....<br/>
