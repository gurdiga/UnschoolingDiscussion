<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767030013">We had a somewhat sad, but sweet thing happen today. I&#39;ve been having a bit <br/>
of  a struggle...my mom died a year ago about this time, and it&#39;s been a really <br/>
busy and hard year for me. The last couple of weeks I&#39;ve been feeling sad and <br/>
frustrated, but communicating, I thought, pretty clearly about it. There&#39;s no <br/>
constant sadness or depression, and I&#39;m going to take a couple of days away <br/>
with my best friend at a hotel where we can swim, jacuzzi, shop, get massages, <br/>
eat good food, and play.<br/>
<br/>
Today I was overwhelmed and sad, and Julian and I were having trouble <br/>
deciding where we wanted to go out to lunch and do after. He suddenly looked so sad, <br/>
and I asked him why. He said, nothing, he was fine. He clearly wasn&#39;t, and I <br/>
pushed a bit.<br/>
<br/>
He started crying, and it came out that he thought it was his fault I was <br/>
sad. I sat him down on my lap (he is 14 and at least 10 inches taller than me), <br/>
and explained, specifically about why I&#39;ve been sad, none of which has anything <br/>
to do with him. He said that since he spends the most time with me that he <br/>
should be able to make me not sad. In fact, I explained, his being around me <br/>
made the last year pretty wonderful DESPITE all the hard times. We both cried <br/>
(I&#39;m a cryer), and then we went to Johnny Rockets and had good food and wandered <br/>
around the mall.<br/>
<br/>
I really like this kid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-143952273">I really like your kid, too!  I have a 13 yob that sounds a lot like <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
My sympathies to you on the loss of your mother.  My father died <br/>
three months ago today.  While I&#39;m still on the rawer end of the <br/>
life without Daddy-o emotional scale, I can imagine that nine months <br/>
from now there will still be times when the pain jabs me like a <br/>
knife. <br/>
<br/>
How dear and precious the moment with a big old boy on your lap must <br/>
have been!  I&#39;ve had a few of those during the past 3 months with my <br/>
boy, too.  Not wanting to be to cliche&#39; ... it just enriches the <br/>
fabric of life, experiencing something like that together, and <br/>
moving on together.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids learn so much through loss of a loved one, especially if the <br/>
parents are open and honest about their own grief.  Sounds like you <br/>
are a loved mom, and your son is a loved boy.<br/>
