<div id="ygrps-yiv-315516381">Wow, it&#39;s been over a year since I&#39;ve been able to keep up with the flow of <br/>
this group but things are settling down and I&#39;m going to attempt to jump <br/>
back in.  When I left last we were moving and have since moved again, <br/>
hopefully permanently this time.  (Long rediculous story there.)<br/>
<br/>
Next weekend is the Rethinking Education conference in Irving, Tx and <br/>
Haleigh and I are going.  I was wondering if anyone here is going or has <br/>
ever been???<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, guess that&#39;s all for now.  Hi everyone!!!! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094370346">Jennifer!  I wondered what happened to you.  Where are you living now?  <br/>
Did you ever make it up to Taylor, MI to visit your aunt?  If you ever <br/>
make you&#39;re way up here LMK so we can try to meet up.  :)<br/>

I&#39;ll be there -- the boys will be at my sister&#39;s house with Gary.  She and her family live in Richland Hills (suburban Ft Worth) so we&#39;ll stay with them.  It gives the kids a chance to get together and save me the hotel cost.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076205392">Well, we aren&#39;t very far from our last move.  Still in the DFW area.  Our <br/>
last house was a literal house of horrors.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still unschooling, hubby still travels ALL the time.  No new babies. <br/>
;) And we are now without a car. :(  Otherwise all is well!<br/>
<br/>
I just overloaded after our move and once things began to fall apart in our <br/>
last house, it took everything I had to keep up.  We&#39;re doing well now.  <br/>
Nice house, smaller but planned much better.  I&#39;m not sure when we&#39;ll ever <br/>
make it up to Michigan now.  Hell, I can barely make it to the grocery <br/>
store!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I see I came back during a little storm here, but I&#39;ll try to hold my tongue <br/>
and let everyone get used to my big mouth again. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be back!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938287534">Yay!  We&#39;ll have to make a plan to meet up while we are there.  I&#39;m in <br/>
Hurst, which borders Richland Hills, so I&#39;m not far from your sister at all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837911599">My sister has lived in Hurst and Euless in recent years -- we&#39;ve visited them in both locales as well as their current address, so I&#39;m getting somewhat familiar with the area.  <br/>
 <br/>
Is there a Sunflower Market in the area, or Wild Oats or even Whole Foodes (tho they&#39;re both kinda spendy).  We&#39;ll need more slavored soy milk, hormone-free dairy milk and organic vegies than I can pack for the drive, and it&#39;s not the kind of stuff Sunny (my sis) keeps on hand, nor do i expect she would know where to find such fare.<br/>
