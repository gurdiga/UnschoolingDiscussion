Wow.  I just talked to my friend Helena who&#39;s doing her last minute shopping <br/>
today and leaving England tomorrow to stay here a month.  (&quot;tomorrow&quot; meaning <br/>
tonight our time).  So she and her husband and three kids will pass Shyrley <br/>
and kids in the air, and then the world will not be unbalanced one way or the <br/>
other.    <br/>
<br/>
Good.  Physics.  <br/>
<br/>
And they&#39;re both going toward home. <br/>
<br/>
Good.  Christmas.<br/>
