&lt;&lt; Cake or death? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Eddie Izzard, on the Church of England, says it wasn&#39;t founded as part of the <br/>
Protestant movement, it was just Henry VIII being a psychotic bastard, but <br/>
that they couldn&#39;t call it &quot;The Psychotic Bastard Church.&quot;  He ties most <br/>
everything in the world into that, but after discussing Catholic confession <br/>
and original sin, says this:<br/>
<br/>
The Anglican faith doesn’t have that. You’ll never go, “Vicar, I have done <br/>
many bad things.” <br/>
<br/>
“Well, so have I.” <br/>
<br/>
“What shall I do?”<br/>
<br/>
 “Well, drink five Bloody Mary’s and, uh, you won’t remember.” <br/>
<br/>
And because we –  the Anglican faith has a lack of – had a lack of <br/>
principles for a long time. You can’t get really headstrong about it. <br/>
<br/>
[then there&#39;s some stuff about jihads]<br/>
<br/>
You can’t do that in Church of England. You can’t say, “You must have tea <br/>
and cake with the Vicar, or you die!” You can’t have extreme points of view, <br/>
you know. The Spanish Inquisition wouldn’t have worked with Church of <br/>
England. “Talk! Will you talk!” <br/>
<br/>
“But it hurts!”<br/>
<br/>
 “Well, loosen it up a bit, will you? Fine…”  <br/>
<br/>
Cause that’s what it would be. “Tea and cake or death? Tea and cake or <br/>
death? Tea and cake or death!” <br/>
<br/>
Students would be, “Tea and cake or death! Tea and cake or death! Little Red <br/>
Cookbook! Little Red Cookbook!” <br/>
<br/>
 “Cake or death?” That’s a pretty easy question. Everybody – anyone could <br/>
answer that. “Cake or death?” <br/>
<br/>
“Uhh, cake please.” <br/>
<br/>
“Very well! Give him cake!” <br/>
<br/>
“Oh, thanks very much. It’s very nice.”<br/>
<br/>
 “You! Cake or death?” <br/>
<br/>
“Uh, cake for me, too, please.” <br/>
<br/>
“Very well! Give him cake, too! We’re gonna run out of cake at this rate. <br/>
You! Cake or death?”<br/>
     ----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
SO...Have fun, Shyrley!  Instead of being surrounded by the paranoid and <br/>
hostile homeschool-crazed American sects, you&#39;re off to the much safer <br/>
tea-and-cake-with-the-vicar land.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873785748">Very true about Henry VIII and the founding of the CoE. He wanted a divorce or an annulment - couldn&#39;t get one - so he broke w/ Rome and started his own church. The persecution of Catholics that followed were because Catholics had to swear to him (Henry) that he was the rep of Christ and not the pope in Rome.<br/>
Very spoiled man.<br/>
Very skewed view of the world.<br/>
