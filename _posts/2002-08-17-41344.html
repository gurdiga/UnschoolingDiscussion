We live on about half an income, fairly simply but very happily. I can&#39;t imagine what I&#39;d do with more money, and I can&#39;t imagine working at a job I don&#39;t love again. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re planning a trip to Europe this winter, and maybe Hawaii soon, since Kilauea is flowing so close to the road...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually if you do your own business and are incorporated as a &quot;C Corp.&quot; <br/>
(minimally) and take all the deductions possible to take, you pay no tax.<br/>
The other trick is to take income as fringe benefits as they are not taxed,<br/>
take minimum wage which is taxed.  If you think a rise in Minimum wage is <br/>
anything other than a tax hike think again.<br/>
