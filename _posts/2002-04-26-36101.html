<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847155132">&lt;&lt; &gt; Another question for all of you, does anyone have any pro-unschooling <br/>
book or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; website recommendations that my ds 10 could read and might actually want to?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I think maybe you shouldn&#39;t direct him to see your point of view about how<br/>
people learn best any more than you should find books that tell him how<br/>
important learning math is. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree strongly with this.  <br/>
<br/>
Teachers in school don&#39;t have the kids read studies on why one textbook&#39;s <br/>
approach works better than another one.  <br/>
<br/>
Some kids might be interested in learning theory, but others won&#39;t be.  And a <br/>
child doesn&#39;t have to read about unschooling to &quot;get it.&quot;   Once his life is <br/>
a learning-fest, he&#39;ll see it on his own.  <br/>
<br/>
Pointing out each thing he learns or each &quot;educational&quot; thing he does is <br/>
probably not the best approach, either.  Let it flow for a while.  If each <br/>
moment or conversation or activity is going to be reviewed for its <br/>
educational content, the whole day becomes one long test, and life&#39;s being <br/>
lived for the purpose of the review.  That makes things too self-conscious, <br/>
and he might close down some, or avoid the situations.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon, we&#39;re planning to go to the children&#39;s museum.  We were just <br/>
there last week with Zenmomma and her kids, but my husband&#39;s parents will be <br/>
there and it will be a good place for Holly to show them some cool stuff.  <br/>
But mostly, I was wanting to take my husband there and show him a new thing <br/>
they have.  It&#39;s a low, short &quot;pan&quot;  (round wood sides maybe 3&#39; across, a <br/>
foot deep) with a rubber bottom and a motor under one side vibrating it.    <br/>
On that surface is about 1/4&quot; of sand (two colors) and small gravel.  You can <br/>
mix them all together and spread them out evenly, but the effect of the <br/>
vibrations is that the sand and gravel separate, in patterns you can figure <br/>
out if you watch it long enough.<br/>
<br/>
The display has no sign, no instructions, it&#39;s just there like a toy, like a <br/>
piece of art.<br/>
<br/>
Another mom (a stranger) and I sat and played with it for a long time.  We <br/>
figured out it&#39;s showing plate tectonics (an uber-geological concept about <br/>
how large land masses move), in part, and sort of being a glacier (as to how <br/>
rocks come to be ejected from glacial masses, and pile up in certain <br/>
patterns).   Because it doesn&#39;t say 1/4&quot; deep after a while.  It builds a <br/>
couple of mountains, in the same places every time.  Maybe 2&quot; high or more.  <br/>
And they&#39;re pulling gravel up into them, and each piece pops up the top, <br/>
rolls down the hill, and joins a clean pile of gravel.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway...<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter if kids &quot;know&quot; what they&#39;re learning there--they&#39;re <br/>
learning!  In face it there were display cards tying it with real-world <br/>
stuff, it would no longer be just a really cool, artsy toy!<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, if at home you set up a little placard next to the sand box about <br/>
the benefits of playing in wet sand and dry, and one next the swing set about <br/>
physics and exercise, and one next to the television with the history of <br/>
theatre and popular entertainment, you would be turning a perfectly cool <br/>
world into a sad kind of school project.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of talking about unschooling, just do it.  It takes a while.  You <br/>
don&#39;t see it in one day or a week.  You might not see it in two months.  But <br/>
if it&#39;s happening it&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
We have a bunch of pumpkins and morning glories just sprouted.  We could thin <br/>
them out and look at a few roots, but if we pull them ALL up to look we won&#39;t <br/>
have any adult plants.  Some have to be JUST watered and ignored.  And the <br/>
more we can water and ignore, the more we&#39;ll have grow to maturity.  Some are <br/>
going to spread out all over our side yard.  Some are going to grow up into <br/>
the trees and bushes and make a happy all-flowery mess, but not until later <br/>
in the year.   Some are going to die a natural death.  Some are going to make <br/>
seeds for next year, and some of those seeds (this being the desert, and we <br/>
being disorganized) won&#39;t be sprouting for four or five years.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of the best learning is like that.  You can plan something, and you can <br/>
plant something, but you can&#39;t mess with it too much after that.  You just <br/>
have to let some stuff go at its own pace, and in its own season.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have been unschooling for 3 years.  Our first 2 yrs of <br/>
homeschooling were relaxed, and I use to do little stuff like <br/>
spelling tests, and math sheets maybe once a week.  My dd is now 11 <br/>
and doesn&#39;t write a lot but has a good grasp of spelling.  My ds8 <br/>
wrote me a story the other day and it was inventive spelling at it&#39;s <br/>
best.  For the 1st time in over 3 years, I lapsed and suggested maybe <br/>
it would be helpful to learn to spell a little better by doing some <br/>
spelling tests, like I use to do with his sister.  He looked at me <br/>
like I was a moron, and I said &quot;oh, come on, give it one try&quot;.  We <br/>
did one test, 8 words.  I had to coax him though it a little.  After <br/>
it was done I asked him if he would want to do that every once in a <br/>
while.  He said, &quot;Mom.  I&#39;m a smart kid.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have figured <br/>
out how to spell words by the time I&#39;m a grown up.&quot;  <br/>
I said, &quot;But what about right now.  Are you worried that you won&#39;t be <br/>
able to spell things when you are with friends and that might make <br/>
you feel bad?&quot;  He said, &quot;No.  I don&#39;t care what they think.&quot;<br/>
I have absolutely no doubt this kid will be able to spell and do <br/>
whatever he wants, whenever he wants.  I have never had any long <br/>
unschooling discussions with him.  Little things here and there.<br/>
He went to pre school and K and came out thinking school is where you <br/>
learn.  Now he is reminding me of what real learning is.<br/>
I felt like the moron his initial look accused me of....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t planning on forcing him to read/research unschooling, just looking <br/>
for something short that he might want to read on his own that could help him <br/>
feel a little more comfortable with it.  Right now, the idea is something <br/>
that really worries him and I think that we&#39;d probably be off to a better <br/>
start if he wasn&#39;t as worried, if not more so, than I am about the whole <br/>
idea!  I completely understand what you&#39;re saying, but like I said, I just <br/>
want him to be more at ease with the whole idea of unschooling and I do <br/>
realize that that may not be possible until we have been at it for awhile, <br/>
but it would be nice for us to start out without him being afraid of the <br/>
whole idea of it, whether or not that is even a possibility with him, it <br/>
would be nice.  : )<br/>
