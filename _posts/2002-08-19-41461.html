<div id="ygrps-yiv-884206197"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; She skipped a step and decided last week that she would no longer eat animals.<br/>
&gt; Of course, we chuckled, but she is sticking to her guns.  So I remembered a<br/>
&gt; mom on this list whose son also chose to become vegetarian.  Questions to her:<br/>
&gt; where are you finding recipes?  How are you explaining nutritional needs?  And<br/>
&gt; is the rest of your family omnivorous?  If so, how are you handling meals?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cathy,<br/>
<br/>
My son is still cheerfully a vegetarian, and I&#39;m proud of him for having the<br/>
guts to decide something and stick to it.  His father and I do eat meat; my<br/>
husband likes meat more than I do, so the deal is that he eats meat at lunch<br/>
while he&#39;s at work.  I cook mainly vegetarian entrees, although we do<br/>
occasionally add meat to our portions.  For the most part, it hasn&#39;t been a<br/>
big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I already had a fair number of vegetarian recipes; we&#39;ve given up meat for<br/>
Lent before, which is 40 days.  I also like the variety of meat and meatless<br/>
meals.  Probably your daughter already likes some easy veggie meals:<br/>
spaghetti, cheese pizza, mac and cheese, bean and rice burritos, cheese<br/>
quesadillas, PB & J, etc.  With some creativity, you can make your usual<br/>
casserole/stirfry/soup/salad type entrees meatless and add meat later if you<br/>
want it.  If we&#39;re doing meat as the entree (bbq type meal), I bought veggie<br/>
burgers and chix nuggets for my son.  Check the freezer section at your<br/>
grocery.  All the brands taste different; my son only likes Morningstar<br/>
brand because it&#39;s the least spicy (no pepper for him!).  If you go with<br/>
those kind of substitutes, hunt around and see what works for your daughter.<br/>
Be prepared to explain carefully, because they look a lot like the meat<br/>
burgers and real chicken nuggets and got a very suspicious attitude from my<br/>
son until he caught on!  (He&#39;s 6).<br/>
<br/>
As far as new recipes, I&#39;ve been checking out cookbooks from the library,<br/>
plus reading mine with an eye toward veggie meals.  Even our pitiful little<br/>
library here had 6 or 8 good vegetarian cookbooks.  (641.5 on the nonfiction<br/>
shelves).  Eating out has been the hardest, since there aren&#39;t vegetarian<br/>
kids meals, at least in the land of Schnitzel!<br/>
<br/>
I think my son has learned a great deal about nutrition; protein, carbs,<br/>
etc.  I know that there is a great deal of debate about the combining<br/>
proteins to make complete proteins idea, but we have found that if we don&#39;t<br/>
get Tim protein from several sources at each meal, he&#39;s hungry in an hour or<br/>
two.  So he&#39;s learned about beans, tofu, whole grains, eggs, dairy proteins,<br/>
peanuts and nuts, etc., and how having food from different food parts of the<br/>
food pyramid makes him healthy, even without meat.<br/>
<br/>
If you want more specific ideas, Cathy, feel free to email me off list.  I<br/>
have some good recipes that might help you get going.   We&#39;ve been at this a<br/>
month or so, and my son is happy with his decision and satisfied with what<br/>
he&#39;s eating.  In fact, I see his concern for animals spilling over into<br/>
other parts of his life.  He&#39;s going to grow from this, whether it lasts a<br/>
month or a lifetime.  (And Mom&#39;s losing weight, too!  Woohoo!)<br/>
