<div id="ygrps-yiv-232248563">I&#39;ve been trying to discuss this with someone and now I&#39;m wondering about how some of you here feel about it. <br/>
<br/>
Do you all really care about the happiness of your children all the time? Not that you try to make them happy every waking moment, or even that one can. Just if they are or aren&#39;t happy, do you care about that?<br/>
<br/>
If you feel like they just have to do something they don&#39;t want to (like go to the store because you have to and they can&#39;t stay home alone) and they are unhappy about that, and you can&#39;t do it any other way, do you care?<br/>
<br/>
And one last question. Is one of the reasons why you unschool so that your kids can be happier? Does that factor into one of the reasons?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do feel like there are times Kathryn just has to do something. But I<br/>
recognize that I feel that way not because it&#39;s the only solution but<br/>
because I can&#39;t figure out a better solution.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m confident there is a better solution.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a pattern and the pattern is generally miscommunication and<br/>
undercommunication so Kathryn wasn&#39;t understanding the situation in the same<br/>
way I was.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what you&#39;re asking is am I motivated because I feel responsible for<br/>
her feeling unhappy. And I&#39;d answer that her unhappiness is a piece of<br/>
evidence that something went wrong in the situation. It&#39;s up to me to<br/>
analyze what part I played in it and what I can do in the future to avoid<br/>
the part I played.<br/>
<br/>
Which is sounding a lot more clinical and cold than it really is in<br/>
practice.<br/>

unhappy can be a good thing - but I definitely care. Always.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re looking for here. I care, but depending on <br/>
the circumstances, I&#39;d probably insist they do whatever needs doing <br/>
anyway. Like weed the garden, feed the horses, haul out the trash... <br/>
things need doing to make a household run smoothly, and while my kids <br/>
grew up understanding that and don&#39;t often balk or complain about it, <br/>
they&#39;re still kids, and sometimes they do, and I smile and tell them <br/>
to do it anyway. Or I do it, depending on what they&#39;re involved in. <br/>
We give and take and the world goes round and round.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it was a factor. I hated school, what little of it I attended, <br/>
and I didn&#39;t want my kids subjected to that kind of controlling <br/>
atmosphere. But it was only a smallish factor. There were many, many <br/>
others which were much more positive!<br/>

<br/>
However, we have REALLY eliminated a lot of activity we used to do because so <br/>
often we&#39;d rather just stay home.  We try and consolidate our &quot;running&quot; into <br/>
one day, and if we&#39;re not going anyplace fun, I wait till a day my husband is <br/>
home and can watch the kids.  It takes a lot of planning and patience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464827100">&lt;&lt;If you feel like they just have to do something they don&#39;t want to (like<br/>

<br/>
I try to look at it as though I were dragging one of my adult friends to the<br/>
store.  Yes, I care and I let them know that I&#39;m sorry that they have to do<br/>
something they don&#39;t like.  I offer to make the trip more fun if I can maybe<br/>
even offer to do something later that they really like.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally it&#39;s harder for them to endure when they are younger but as they<br/>
have gotten older they are good natured and pragmatic about these kinds of<br/>
things.  I think knowing that I wouldn&#39;t put them in the position if it<br/>
wasn&#39;t necessary and that I really do care about their feelings makes it<br/>
easier to just go with them flow.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And one last question. Is one of the reasons why you unschool so that your<br/>
kids can be happier? Does that factor into one of the reasons?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I unschool because I want to treat my children, as much as possible, like<br/>
dear adult friends so I would say that it does factor in.  I want their<br/>
entire lives to be as full of happiness and contentment as possible, I think<br/>
unschooling is crucial to this.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many parents would send a child to school if they knew they<br/>
were only going to live to the age of 10.  Most likely they would keep them<br/>
home and cherish every moment and let them LIVE life.  I&#39;m cherishing and<br/>
protecting their happiness AND helping them be happier adults too, what a<br/>
deal!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Today I had to make an unexpected trip to the post office. Ds does not like <br/>
going to the store, post office, etc. I didn&#39;t have anyone I could leave him <br/>
with, so I offered a trip to the library to check out videos in return for the <br/>
short notice and the unavoidable errand. I don&#39;t know if it was his happiness I <br/>
was thinking about, or more that it wasn&#39;t fair to him to have to go with me <br/>
just because he&#39;s little and can&#39;t stay home alone. <br/>
<br/>
And then there was the time when he wanted to go, but needed to stay home. I <br/>
was asked to fill in for someone at work. She was crying in the restroom <br/>
because she failed a test at college. They couldn&#39;t calm her down. Ds knows my work <br/>
days and we always plan who will watch him (usually dad or older brother), <br/>
but this was unexpected. The only person was an aunt. He didn&#39;t want to stay <br/>
with her. Dad would be a few hours before he came home from work. We decided ds <br/>
could go with me, dress like me, work like me, etc., till Dad could come pick <br/>
him up. He was very excited!<br/>
<br/>
We go by to tell his aunt he won&#39;t be staying with her (she happens to be the <br/>
manager of the store I was working at). She tells me he can&#39;t go. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
even wait for my response to her, he just runs out the door screaming! She <br/>
tells me he will get over it, and that he needs to learn that sometimes people <br/>
just have to do things, like go to work. <br/>
<br/>
Wow! Considering the reason I was going to work, I was just amazed at what <br/>
she was telling me. A grown woman sits crying at work and I need to go fill in <br/>
for her. In the mean time I&#39;m supposed to leave my six year old child screaming <br/>
and crying at his aunt&#39;s, with no one to care about how he feels.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I told her he goes with me, or my coworker would just have to get over <br/>
it. I wasn&#39;t leaving him. He did go with me and he had a wonderful time! <br/>
<br/>
I think I mainly think about fairness. It&#39;s not really fair for him to be <br/>
unhappy because I can&#39;t come up with a solution to my problem. In situations like <br/>
that, I do what I can to make it fair, which usually makes him happy.  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re looking for here. &gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well this is only the second post I read to my response but since both you<br/>
and Joyce weren&#39;t sure what I was looking for, I&#39;ll try to clarify why I<br/>
asked. Someone made the comment that &quot;they really don&#39;t care if their kids<br/>
are happy or not.&quot; It was in reference to certain situations where the<br/>
parents insist the children do something they don&#39;t want to do. The example<br/>
given was a child having to run an errand with the mom because he can&#39;t stay<br/>
home alone. Now this has come up with me also, and although the children do<br/>
indeed have other things they would rather do, they come along and I really<br/>
haven&#39;t had a problem with them complaining about it. Maybe because I do try<br/>
to not have them be &quot;made&quot; to do things often they don&#39;t like. But if they<br/>
were mad about it or upset, even though they would still hve to go along, I<br/>
certainly would care they were mad or upset. This particular person stated<br/>
she didn&#39;t care and I heard from someone else who also said they don&#39;t care<br/>
either. I was waiting for some kind of explanation or &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it that<br/>
way&quot; and instead got what they said IS what they meant. I was really upset<br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
Then I asked if that&#39;s why we (a general we) unschooled? So that our kids<br/>
were happy. I was told that if that&#39;s why I unschooled, I was missing the<br/>
boat. I made sure to note it&#39;s not the only reason why I do unschool. It&#39;s<br/>
nice to know I&#39;m still on someone&#39;s boat!!!<br/>

Boy did that seem hypocritical leaving your crying child to take over for a<br/>
crying woman. I enjoyed your story and good for you!!!<br/>
<br/>
I like how parents here do care and make sure that if situations come up<br/>
that aren&#39;t the best, they do try and make the best out of that situation. I<br/>
think that&#39;s important. I think it&#39;s a great lesson instead of just letting<br/>
the child know the world is full of disappointments. I figure my kids will<br/>
come upon them sooner or later, no matter how great of a mom I am. Hopefully<br/>
at that point they will be able to deal with them all with the tools they<br/>
have been shown.<br/>

People give me the dirtiest looks because I stop to listen to my children<br/>

Keith&#39;s home this week.  He&#39;s leaving tomorrow for five days in Colorado with <br/>
a friend of his, but today he was back in the bedroom watching Babylon 5.  I <br/>
went to put my foot up a while, and fell asleep.  <br/>
<br/>
I got a phone call and talked a bit, and Holly came in and said &quot;Aren&#39;t we <br/>
going to WalMart?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Keith said I was taking a nap (in such a tone that Holly should wait until I <br/>
was through taking a nap).  I never take naps!  I was asleep accidently. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
And I HAD told Holly I would take her to WalMart, so I got up to go.  (She <br/>
wanted size 10 boys&#39; spiderman underwear, but it only went to 8, after all.)<br/>
<br/>
So on the way out we asked Marty if he needed anything from WalMart.  No.<br/>
Kirby?  No, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
We hung out, looked at stuff, spent $12, got boys&#39; underwear with aliens and <br/>
space ships and a few other home-things, a 96 cent can of Pringles because <br/>
Kirby had some in his room which Holly didn&#39;t eat because they were Kirby&#39;s.... <br/>
everybody&#39;s happy.<br/>
<br/>
If I had said &quot;no, I&#39;m taking a nap,&quot; Holly wouldn&#39;t have been as happy.  If <br/>
I had not asked the boys if they wanted anything, they would not have been as <br/>
happy.  It was easy to think of each person on the way by.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218783700">I come up against this same quandry a lot.  I think it is because I have 4 <br/>
children who are all very different.  They have different needs, wants, <br/>
interests, preferences.  I strive to compromise as much as I  can to make sure no <br/>
one is UNhappy, although, they may not all be as happy as they would like.  I do <br/>
care about thier happiness, and it&#39;s difficult when I can&#39;t please everyone, <br/>
but, I know sometimes it it just not a possiblity.   Take going out to eat for <br/>
instance, if all 6 of us go, it&#39;s a pretty sure bet that somebody is not <br/>
going to just love the restaurant we end up going to.   But, we never go somewhere <br/>
that someone hates.   We have to compromise, take turns, make adjustments.  <br/>
We don&#39;t go to the same restaurant every time, so we all get a chance to eat at <br/>
our favorite places.   Lots of times, we all agree except one person, and <br/>
when it comes down to that, it&#39;s got to be a majority rule.  ( and again, never <br/>
to somewhere someone hates, or even dislikes strongly)   I have even went <br/>
through a drive thru for someone to get thier food to take in with us to the <br/>
&quot;majority choice&quot; restaurant.    <br/>
<br/>
   I try to always offer alternatives, or give incentives. ( like the video <br/>
rental scenario) if there is something I NEED/HAVE to do and a child does not <br/>
want to go.    If it is feasible for them to stay at home or stay with someone <br/>
else, then that is thier option.   Of course, that option is much easier now <br/>
that most of them are old enough to stay home alone<br/>
<br/>
.  I think one of the most important things we can do when a child is unhappy <br/>
is to validate thier feelings.  Let them know that you understand they are <br/>
unhappy.   Convey to them that you wish you could do something to make them feel <br/>
better.. ask them what you can do to help them feel better.   Even if they <br/>
are unhappy, at least they know it is not something that you are doing <br/>
intentionally &quot;to&quot; them, it&#39;s just a circumstance that you (and they)have to deal with. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, I forgot this part of the question.<br/>
<br/>
YES.  One of my sons was very very unhappy in school.  It was all school <br/>
related.  He still sufferes from &quot;backlash&quot; of his school time.   I took him out <br/>
of school to help him be happier.   My decision to unschool was directly <br/>
related to him and how he did not thrive in school settings, doing busy work, taking <br/>
tests, etc.  .   Since he had the most difficulty with &quot;academics&quot; of all of <br/>
my children, I looked for  homeschooling methods  that would be the best for <br/>
him.    I found unschooling and of course it is wonderful for all of my <br/>
children.   ( well, except for the one that still goes to school.. BUT, our <br/>
unschooling philosophies have spilled over into his ps life too)  My boys have never <br/>
been &quot;happy&quot; doing school work, so, unschooling is a much MUCH happier existance <br/>
for them.   Anna was not UNhappy doing schoolwork, she tolerated it and <br/>
accepted it.  But she is also much happier NOT doing it :-)<br/>

&lt;&lt;Huh.<br/>
And do they send their kids to school so they will be happy?<br/>
So they will be unhappy?<br/>
Or do they Just Not Care?<br/>
<br/>
Sad, that they try to make you doubt your conscious choice so they feel<br/>
better about their whatever-kind-of-choice.&gt;&gt;&#92;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was from homeschoolers/unschoolers. I am sure that unschooling is the<br/>
right thing for us but for a minute, started to wonder if maybe I *was*<br/>
missing something I was just too dumb to see.<br/>
<br/>
I just really had a hard time hearing that parents had an &quot;I don&#39;t care if<br/>
they&#39;re happy&quot; attitude about their kids. To me, how can you be good at<br/>
unschooling, or even do it at all by most definitions, without caring if<br/>
your kids are happy?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
(again)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720027350">I&#39;m having something of the opposite problem.  I&#39;m working really hard,<br/>

groceries.  I do HAVE to go to the OB.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve NOT done a lot of things that I think his younger brother would<br/>
LOVE (ds2 is 2 years old) because big boy baulks at it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s getting very tiring to work so hard to make accomodations for his needs<br/>
and moods and then get to the end of the day, ask for one hour to watch a tv<br/>
show I like and sit still, and watch him have a total melt down.  He just<br/>
freaks out.  I keep trying to explain that, frankly, it&#39;s my turn now.  I&#39;m<br/>
tired, we did a lot, and I would like to watch tv.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like he has to sit in a corner and watch me watch.  He has games,<br/>
books, etc.  He can watch the other tv.  I&#39;ll sometimes even be willing to<br/>
play something with him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also 8 mos pregnant, so tired for me right now is a bit more than just,<br/>
&quot;hey it&#39;s been a long day.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think one of the most important things we can do when a child is unhappy<br/>
is to validate thier feelings.  Let them know that you understand they are<br/>
unhappy.   Convey to them that you wish you could do something to make them<br/>
feel<br/>
better.. ask them what you can do to help them feel better.   Even if they<br/>
are unhappy, at least they know it is not something that you are doing<br/>
intentionally &quot;to&quot; them, it&#39;s just a circumstance that you (and they)have to<br/>
deal with. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I think that is very important. I do it every time I need to. Even with<br/>
Alyssa, and sometimes she&#39;s just so upset she&#39;s not hearing me. But I still<br/>
take the time to let her know, even briefly, that I hear what she&#39;s saying.<br/>
I too also find other ways so that my kids can be happy. Yes it&#39;s<br/>
inconvenient sometimes for me but so what? I seem to be hearing from others<br/>
(not here) that the kids just need to deal with it and the whole *I&#39;m the<br/>
mom I say so I don&#39;t care how you feel we have to do this* attitude!!!!<br/>
<br/>
When we all went to the water park for the first time this summer, I thought<br/>
we would all have a blast. Well Alyssa just had about 30 minutes of it and<br/>
she was done for the day. She just doesn&#39;t like it right now there. So I<br/>
busted my butt to come up with an idea so the other kids could stay as they<br/>
were having a blast, and so Alyssa could leave and not have to stay. I<br/>
finally got a hold of my mom who came and picked her up. Now when we go, she<br/>
happily stays home with no fuss. I figure we can try again next year when<br/>
she&#39;s older if she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that acknowledging those feelings the kids have make it so that<br/>
when they do *need* to accompany us, there is no big deal. They know we go<br/>
out of our way for them and they grow up willing to do the same.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I do care if my child is happy and that makes even my family think I&#39;ve<br/>
gone<br/>
off the deep end. They think he&#39;s in for a rude awakening when he gets out<br/>
in<br/>
&quot;the real world&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes I hear that a lot from people. Burns my butt really. Like I keep them<br/>
in a bubble all day just waiting on them hand and foot.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of went through people telling me what I should do when my kids were<br/>
younger. All my kids, when they were little were rather shy. Even Tara was<br/>
and well now you would never know it. People kept telling me school was the<br/>
best thing for her. Poor kid clung to her teacher for like 5 years. I think<br/>
it made it worse for her.<br/>
<br/>
When Joseph was like that, since people knew he wasn&#39;t going to go to<br/>
school, they suggested all kinds of things like preschools and playgroups<br/>
and kinder care classes. Things all very organized and told me not to worry<br/>
if he didn&#39;t want to go. It would be good for him is what I heard. Never<br/>
listened to any of them.<br/>
<br/>
I took Joseph and Sierra to the YuGiOh tournament on Sat. Sierra pretty much<br/>
hangs on to me and just watches. This was only the second time I have gone<br/>
with Joseph. Joe usually takes him. Well we were there for a few minutes and<br/>
Joseph told me he was going to find someone to play with. We were too late<br/>
for the tournament. Well no sooner he says that he&#39;s off. He went and found<br/>
some kids to duel. After that was over, he ended up in another room with<br/>
kids that were like 13-15. He walked right up to them and asked if they<br/>
wanted to trade some cards. The first kid declined so he went to the next<br/>
kid. He ended up trading and getting some cards he really wanted. Like an<br/>
old pro. I was really awe struck to see him this way. Very confident and<br/>
comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Joe and I were just talking about this tonight. How we see Sierra just<br/>
starting to talk to people she doesn&#39;t know. How much she&#39;s changed with her<br/>
people skills. And then noticing how Alyssa will be yacking away until<br/>
someone talks to her that she doesn&#39;t know and she just shuts right up and<br/>
stares at them. Joe said he&#39;s not worried about them at all. After all, look<br/>
at how Joseph found his way so well!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt;I&#39;m wondering if sometimes not having eaten (the one bad to no real<br/>
scheduled meals is that you sometimes forget to eat) is a problem, but there<br/>
seems to be more to it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For me here, the first things I look at if my kids start to get a little<br/>
grumpy or out of sorts is have they eaten and are they tired?? My kids are<br/>
pretty good about eating in general but I do find sometimes they need a<br/>
little food lift. The big one is them being tired. For all three of the<br/>
little ones. Well actually for Tara too!!! I usually talk to them about how<br/>
they are feeling and then relate it to them not getting enough sleep or just<br/>
having an active day. Lately Joseph and Sierra have been going in the pool<br/>
twice a day now. They dont realize how much that wears them out. Especially<br/>
the way they play out there and in the sun. Sometimes just sitting down and<br/>
having some quiet time helps them get over that hump. I&#39;ll suggest we all do<br/>
a puzzle or I&#39;ll read some books to them. If one is more frustrated than the<br/>
other, I may suggest some playtime on the computer or maybe a movie or<br/>
something where I can get the 3 of them away from each other to settle down<br/>
some. With my kids, sometimes I think it too is a lot of stimulation with<br/>
all 3 together so much. Luckily I have the room here to give them some<br/>
distance, but I usually have to initiate that as they don&#39;t see that as a<br/>
problem and will all stay together and fight. I kind of corral one up and<br/>
suggest something in a different part of the house. Sometimes I even try to<br/>
navigate one to my moms apartment. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s getting better now but at times it seems worse. I work on it a lot so<br/>
that we don&#39;t have major melt downs. It still happens. Today Joseph went<br/>
crying in his room because of the way Sierra plays with him. (or doesn&#39;t<br/>
play) He very rarely cries. Poor kids was upset. He was also tired.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you can give us more detail we can think of things that may have<br/>
worked for us. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s harder for you now too.<br/>

I work hard for a happy today---for ALL of us. It breaks my heart when I <br/>
can&#39;t keep them happy----it HAPPENS, but it still breaks my heart!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I picked Duncan up from a friend&#39;s. He was NOT happy to go. He <br/>
sulked all the way home (short ride &lt;g&gt;). As we walked up the stairs into the <br/>
house, he turned and apologized for being a poop and not wanting to leave. He <br/>
said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t want to leave. I just like Alex a lot.  But I LOVE <br/>
being home and with you.&quot; I told him that I understood. That I know how hard it is <br/>
to leave friends. He gave me a really big hug, and suddenly everything was <br/>
OK. But I hated to see him so sad to leave.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know *why* your friends unschool, but I like what Joyce said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The goal of unschooling is not education. It is to help a child be who she <br/>
is and blossom into who she will become. Education happens as a side effect.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
THAT&#39;s my *why*. My *how* is by making his childhood the best I possibly can, <br/>
by being there to help and cheer and expose and commiserate---by making (or <br/>
helping) him (be) happy.<br/>
