<div id="ygrps-yiv-780787124">I like a book called &quot;Keeping Kids Reading&quot; by Mary Leonhardt.  I got it out of the library.  She has many good ideas for resistant readers like getting them comic books and magazines they may be interested in.  Reading Mary Leonhardt&#39;s books was actually what caused me to start looking for an alternative to ps even though she is a high school English teacher.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From my perspective, your expectations of &quot;he should be past it by now&quot; are <br/>
not helping the situation. It reminds me a bit of my daughter and math, which <br/>
long ago in our journey, I was ignorant of the damage I was doing by <br/>
&quot;bringing it up&quot;. If you can let go of your own expectations and just allow <br/>
him to be and live and enjoy his life as is, reading, math, science, all <br/>
those &quot;subjects&quot; will come up and he will learn as he is led. <br/>
<br/>
As for suggestions, how about these. . . offer to read aloud to him if he is <br/>
interested on a book he likes, listening to books on tape, make sure he sees <br/>
you reading something you enjoy. But the best suggestion I can make is to let <br/>
go of your own expectations about when, why, and how he should be reading.<br/>

I recommended a bringing some comic books and magazines but after reading a few of the replies, I realize it is not the unschooling way to take the lead with regard to a resistant reader.  That being said, why can&#39;t we look at it the same way we would look a feeding a child not thriving.  If I was concerned about my child&#39;s health because he wasn&#39;t interested in eating due to a health problem (here I am comparing the damage from ps to a health problem), wouldn&#39;t I offer a good variety of food to help him?  Wouldn&#39;t it be ok in this situation to bring home some fun things to read and let him know what you have?  <br/>

<br/>
My husband is dyslexic and was burned badly in school.  He started reading<br/>
at 12-13 because he found something interesting enough to him that he<br/>
was willing to work at it.  See if your son is interested in something<br/>
and get some books on the subject.  Leave them around - I wouldn&#39;t try<br/>
to force him to read them.  Also how long has he been out of school,<br/>
maybe he needs more time to heal from what school did to him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>IMO leaving things that might interest a child lying around is fine.  It&#39;s<br/>
coercing the child into using them that is the issue.  I get things all the<br/>
time that I think my children will enjoy using or doing - if they do, fine;<br/>
if they don&#39;t that&#39;s fine too.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve read the responses you&#39;ve gotten so far and I agree. With the written word facing him at every turn, trying to let go of your expectations would be the best thing for him. The more worried you are, the more you try to help, the more tense he&#39;ll feel and will remain stagnant. Trust that he&#39;ll figure it out and just sit back and watch. I&#39;ve had to do that with my youngest and you&#39;d be amazed at the turnaround in a very short amount of time! Even though I didn&#39;t think she was aware of the discomfort I felt about her reading, she obviously knew or was tuned into it. Once I was able to let go, she improved. Whenever I start getting tense while sitting and reading with her, I see her start to slip back to old behavior. <br/>
It&#39;s amazing and at the same time quite scary to realize the control we have over our kids whether we&#39;re in tuned to it or not! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810000503">Define just starting to read.  Is it possible he can read but doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to?  Is HE frustrated with his inability?  Without more  <br/>
information it is difficult to even give suggestions.  But my first <br/>
thought is that it sounds like YOU are worried about it.  That can <br/>
carry over and be hard on him.  <br/>

Rather than try to guess what he&#39;d like to read, I&#39;d most likely take him/her to Borders and spend about two hours there. Go for your *own* research or pleasure but just drag him along &lt;g&gt;. I can&#39;t imagine someone spending two hours in Borders and not finding *something* of interest. Now, being the type of mom I am, I&#39;d be reading my own book but constantly keeping one eye in my kids direction to discover what he *really* is interested in. Later, I&#39;d probably go back and try to find more of the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245791533">I would add to the good suggestions already made:<br/>
<br/>
Visit the library with him a LOT.  Don&#39;t go with him to the children&#39;s<br/>
section and help him pick books....just YOU go for YOU.  Spend some time<br/>
there....as much as you can.  Long enough for him to get bored, if possible.<br/>
Let him follow you around, if he wants--stand in the aisles reading<br/>
different books--fiction, non-fiction, magazines, videos, etc.  Do this at<br/>
least once a week--more if you can.  I am sure that he will begin seeing<br/>
books on the shelves that he will be interested enough in picking up.  No<br/>
pressure....just be there with him.<br/>
<br/>
Books on tape--good idea.  And not just in the children&#39;s section.  Videos<br/>
made from books.  Computer CDs.  Music.  Let him find out what a pleasurable<br/>
place the library is, if he doesn&#39;t already know.<br/>
<br/>
Jim Trelease&#39;s &quot;The New Read Aloud Handbook&quot; would be a good read for you.<br/>
His thoughts about the importance of reading aloud to children--no matter<br/>
what their age--are convincing.  He talks about leaving reading material in<br/>
the bathroom (books, magazines, newspapers) and on the kitchen<br/>
table--wherever the child will be sitting for a while and, possibly, getting<br/>
bored.  He also has a &quot;no bedtime&quot; policy to allow for as much reading as a<br/>
child wants.  Other good ideas in his books.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you might want to ask your librarian for books about &quot;good books for<br/>
kids&quot;.  I have a pair of books...don&#39;t remember the author right<br/>
off-hand....called &quot;Great Books for Boys&quot; and &quot;Great Books for Girls&quot;.  Many<br/>
others along these lines.  (I own most of them!  I like these kinds of<br/>
books!)  I&#39;m not suggesting, necessarily, that you obtain these books FOR<br/>
him, but it might give you an idea about where YOU would like to browse<br/>
shelves.  :-)<br/>

offering to read to him, if that isn&#39;t already being done.  As long as <br/>
there&#39;s no subtle expectations of, &quot;Do this because it&#39;s good for you,&quot; <br/>
it&#39;s still well within the range of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Just don&#39;t do what I did when my son reached 12 and still wasn&#39;t <br/>
reading.  I insisted on some daily phonics with him.  Yes, it did help his <br/>
reading skills, but it damaged our relationship and probably  was actually <br/>
a backwards step toward his independent reading.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s now 14 and a very slow reader.  I&#39;ve gradually come to terms with the <br/>
fact that this is ok.  He is not a person who will likely ever do much of <br/>
his learning from printed materials (though I wouldn&#39;t mind being proven <br/>
wrong someday).  He&#39;s a doer and learns mostly by doing and by watching <br/>
(mainly TV) as well.  I can&#39;t say that any of this is because school <br/>
damaged him because he&#39;s never been to school (other than a 3 day trial <br/>
when he was 12).<br/>

&gt;How could you use trickery in regards to reading?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Anytime your agenda, hidden or otherwise, superceeds the child&#39;s agenda <br/>
to just learn at their own pace, then you are out of the unschooling <br/>
realm. This may be an option for a parent, but they will get questioned <br/>
on those choices when in an unschooling forum.<br/>
<br/>
When the agenda is hidden, its trickery. And they will catch on. And <br/>
there will be resentment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I recommended a bringing some comic books and magazines but after reading <br/>
&gt;a few of the replies, I realize it is not the unschooling way to take the <br/>
&gt;lead with regard to a resistant reader.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, there are no resistant readers in the unschooling realm.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That being said, why can&#39;t we <br/>
&gt;look at it the same way we would look a feeding a child not thriving.  If <br/>
&gt;I was concerned about my child&#39;s health because he wasn&#39;t interested in <br/>
&gt;eating due to a health problem (here I am comparing the damage from ps to <br/>
&gt;a health problem), wouldn&#39;t I offer a good variety of food to help him?  <br/>
&gt;Wouldn&#39;t it be ok in this situation to bring home some fun things to read <br/>
&gt;and let him know what you have?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, its the parent putting their agenda over a child&#39;s natural desire.<br/>
<br/>
Having stuff around the house is a far cry from going to a bookstore and <br/>
spending 3 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn to read because the written word is all around us. And they <br/>
will learn best at their own time, if given the space and trust.<br/>

problems reading until they had an eye exam.  Once they got that <br/>
corrected, they started reading.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is very true and in choosing materials don&#39;t think you have to <br/>
stick to what publishers recommend.  Wyndham (is not unschooled but <br/>
the advice is good anyway IMHO) was not interested in books at all <br/>
until we started buying him books about trains that are WAY above his <br/>
reading level.  He spend a lot of time with them and he is reading <br/>
much better now.  DH also spends a lot of time pouring over the books <br/>
with him.  But *I* had to break free of that &quot;beginning reader&quot; thing.<br/>
