<div id="ygrps-yiv-503431483">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group and hope someone can provide us with some <br/>
assistance or encouragement.  One of our daughters, 9 1/2years old <br/>
was diagnosed with cavities in June and was very upset (sobbing) and <br/>
frightened when the dentist told us about it. After trying another <br/>
dentist in September for a second opinion, hoping that maybe a change <br/>
in venue might help, the good news was that his judgment was that she <br/>
only had one cavity that really needed taking care of, the others <br/>
that the other dentist wanted to do seemed watchable.  The bad news <br/>
was that as I tried to help her calm and relax herself to try the <br/>
procedure, he tried to pull her back into the chair forcibly to &quot;get <br/>
started&quot; at which point Celia said to me: &quot;Mommy I wish I could do <br/>
this, but I can&#39;t.&quot;  I said &quot;stop&quot;, helped her out of the seat and we <br/>
left a visibly disgusted dentist who told me when I asked him if he <br/>
had any other suggestions that he has never seen a child have this <br/>
problem in his 25 years of practice and that &quot;he couldn&#39;t do a thing <br/>
with her.&quot;<br/>
We have been reassuring and are hoping that at some point she will <br/>
feel able to tackle this but it&#39;s going on six months and clearly she <br/>
is not ready to undergo dental treatment from an emotional <br/>
standpoint, but I am concerned that from a medical/physical health <br/>
standpoint we need to help her through this without coercing her or <br/>
forcing her but somehow need to get this taken care of.  We&#39;re at the <br/>
point that if I could do her filling myself I&#39;d give it a try (she <br/>
asked me if I could!)Has anyone had a similar experience? I would be <br/>
very grateful to anyone who can clue me in here to what I can do to <br/>
help my daughter get through this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915967841">Dear Pattie,<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what part of the country you are in, but in South <br/>
Florida area we have several holistic dentists who are very gentle <br/>
with children, who would never use force to do a procedure and <br/>
overall have a special way to make children comfortable with dental <br/>
procedures.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Veryyoungkidsteeth&quot; is a good yahoo! group where you can ask <br/>
questions related to dental procedures and non-traditional ways to <br/>
approach these procedures, as well as ways to prevent future cavities <br/>
by using essential oils with toothpaste.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Anna (Miami, Florida)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-550279938">Dear Anna,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for telling us about veryyoungkidsteeth -- I will look this group up <br/>
immediately!  We live in Northern Virginia so it would be a bit of a journey to <br/>
get to Florida but, frankly at this point, to have a dentist that my child <br/>
felt really comfortable with would be worth a trip, even a long one.  <br/>

Dh and I went through this exact situation with several dental surgeons with<br/>
my dd (5.75 at the time) who needed a tooth extracted and 7 fillings<br/>
recently. I wrote an article about my experience that was published in the<br/>
last (Sept) issue of Live Free, Learn Free.<br/>
<br/>
www.livefreelearnfree.com for the back issue.<br/>
<br/>
The short version is that Jayn was very reluctant to allow the several<br/>
dental surgeons to work on her teeth, and they were all rude and pushy. At<br/>
first we tried to persuade Jayn, but then we realized that we should listen<br/>
to her first &quot;no&quot; at once, and just leave.<br/>
<br/>
Finally after several tries we found a wonderful pediatric full-service<br/>
dentist who was kind, has a great office space, and was understanding and<br/>
not trying to play on fears and create false urgency. When *Jayn* trusted<br/>
her we moved forward, with no trauma.<br/>
<br/>
These kind and nice dentists do exist - although &quot;holistic&quot; refers to a<br/>
medical philosophy more than necessarily a child-centered kindness<br/>
philosophy, as we found. They may still have the idea that the child should<br/>
do as they are told (for their own good of course). <br/>
<br/>
Dentists speak another language. The receptionist will *always* say &quot;Oh yes,<br/>
he/she is very kind and gentle with the children&quot;. Humph. Continue to ask<br/>
the other attachment parents and Unschoolers in your local area for<br/>
recommendations. Visit the offices. Once you find the right person, you will<br/>
be amazed at how much better everyone feels.<br/>
<br/>
Trust your dd and your own feelings. You can find the right<br/>
practitioner...really. Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377907452">Hi Anna,<br/>
<br/>
Ditto to Robyn&#39;s thoughts that you absolutely can find a sensitive dentist.<br/>
It just takes active looking, and maybe driving a distance (though I agree<br/>
Florida may be too far :o)<br/>
<br/>
My ds could not stand the feeling of being trapped in the chair. And he was<br/>
also a mouth-breather, which is really hard with all that stuff in your<br/>
mouth! Panic came quickly for him. We found someone who understood all of<br/>
this and just took it one step at a time, at his pace.<br/>
<br/>
Some dentists advertise that they work with special needs kids, and they<br/>
tend to be more sensitive in general as well.<br/>
<br/>
Also, have you heard of xylitol? For a couple of years we brushed our teeth<br/>
with it straight as dh is a doc who just knows these things told us it<br/>
helped enormously with tooth decay. Then lo and behold Tom&#39;s toothpaste<br/>
started adding xylitol and we use that now. Xylitol is a sweetener made from<br/>
sugar, oddly enough, but does not spark the insulin reaction that straight<br/>
sugar does, so it is great for people looking to avoid that, like diabetics.<br/>
The tooth health is another great benefit.<br/>
<br/>
I have had an area of my mouth that had been a problem for years (hate the<br/>
dentist myself) where I was supposed to have a root canal or extraction, and<br/>
when I started brushing with xylitol, all the symptoms went away. It&#39;s been<br/>
fine for the last three years. I don&#39;t know if that is typical or not, but<br/>
it is worth a try to help while looking for a good dentist.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

xylitol...interesting). Our search continues for a good, sensitive, understanding dentist.<br/>

Thank you for sharing your experiences with us, it really helps.  I am <br/>
ordering that back issue today!  I understand what you are saying about &quot;holistic&quot; <br/>
not necessarily meaning &quot;child-friendly.&quot;  &quot;Pediatric&quot; dentist doesn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily mean child-friendly either, for that matter.  I&#39;ve seen an awful lot of <br/>
so-called pediatric dentists who were manhandling  or otherwise forcing <br/>
procedures upon terrified children during &quot;treatment&quot;.  The last dentist we went to <br/>
had an office administrator who told me: &quot;well, just tell her we all have to go <br/>
through this.&quot;  My thinking on this is that it&#39;s probably never a good idea to <br/>
do something just because someone says we all do it...And since when can&#39;t we <br/>
find a way to improve on something that causes grown men and women so much <br/>
fear that many of them put off dental treatment!  Thanks again for your thoughts!<br/>
