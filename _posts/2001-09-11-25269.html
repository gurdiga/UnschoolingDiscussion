<div id="ygrps-yiv-711210329">&lt;&lt;Especially family....who want to &quot;correct&quot; your child&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We went to a family reunion this summer.  I did not realize how relaxed we<br/>
had become until we were around the other families.  I had always thought my<br/>
SIL was kind of a nut, in the nicest way possible  :), because she was sooo<br/>
concerned about her kids, their feelings, giving them freedom.  This trip I<br/>
was right there with her, supporting her and vice versa, against the other<br/>
SIL, otherwise known as the tyrant.  The difference was sooo immense.<br/>
<br/>
Nice SIL took all the kids out on the boat skiing, letting them take turns<br/>
driving, no one forced to do anything, everyone allowed to do what they felt<br/>
comfortable doing (My 8yo parked the boat in the slip and did a better job<br/>
than most of the adults).<br/>
<br/>
 Then there was the tyrant.....  The kids decided they wanted to cook supper<br/>
for everybody one night, talking 25 people.  So nice SIL and I took them to<br/>
the store to buy what they needed.  When it came time to do the cooking,<br/>
nice SIL and I asked the kids if they wanted us to help and they declined.<br/>
We took some pictures and sat on the couch talking, close enough to answer<br/>
any questions that might arise.  The tyrant walked in, gave orders, took<br/>
over, told the kids they were wrong, then complained because the kids moved<br/>
on to do other things.  We tried to make several suggestions to the tyrant,<br/>
like &quot;Why don&#39;t you come over here with us?&quot;, &quot;At our house, it works better<br/>
if the adults leave the kids to do their own projects&quot;, etc., all to no<br/>
avail.<br/>
<br/>
The tyrant went so far as to tell my 10yo it was time for bed, what to snack<br/>
on and when, how to fix her hair for family pictures, etc..  I repeatedly<br/>
told tyrant that the kids were used to making these decisions for themselves<br/>
but she didn&#39;t seem to even hear me.  I finally told my kids that they<br/>
couldn&#39;t be mean to their aunt, but they didn&#39;t have to mind her either.<br/>
Made for an uncomfortable week.<br/>

&lt;&lt; No offense but many of you say you don&#39;t give your kids chores . . . but,<br/>
 they help do this and that, or they take care of this.  Guess what? <br/>
 Those are chores.  No matter what you want to call tham and what the<br/>
 level of cooperation is, they are still chores.  Perhaps the reason why<br/>
 you jumped on me for our job list when it is nearly identical to<br/>
 lovemary&#39;s(?) was because we call a chore &#39;a chore&#39; in this house.  We<br/>
 have chosen not to call cleaning the toilet and opportunity to do<br/>
 something together.  But, if it helps y&#39;all to get stuff done to call it<br/>
 chutes and ladders, go for it. <br/>
 <br/>
 Bridget &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I didn&#39;t post but once on this subject a bit ago. I have to say even in <br/>
my own head I do not call what I do around here chores. They are things that <br/>
need to be done for this house to function. I do not call taking out the <br/>
garbage a chore. I just do it when I take the dog out. Or dd jumps up and <br/>
says she will do it. I swear b/c we have not made anything mandatory or a <br/>
&quot;chore&quot; my child actively participates.<br/>
<br/>
  mostly......her room is driving me nuts and she knows it....so it doesn&#39;t <br/>
get done.......hmmmm I must make it a non issue once again. Thanks for the <br/>
reminder.<br/>

Since the above was an example of your adding your similar example to<br/>

wrong for readers to assume your child *also* didn&#39;t realize what you were<br/>
