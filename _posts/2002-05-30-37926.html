<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For those of you out there that may be interested in the veracity of <br/>
&gt; ADD, here are a couple of URL&#39;s to get you started on making your own <br/>
&gt; decision.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nobody questions whether a set of behaviors, a syndrome, exist that, put <br/>
together, are called ADD.<br/>
<br/>
The question is whether or not it is useful IN an unschooling environment, to <br/>
use the label on our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Which is REALLY just part of the bigger question of using any labels on <br/>
unschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids were IN school, I&#39;d want them labeled as Gifted - because the <br/>
gifted kids get extra attention and resources, etc.<br/>
<br/>
At home, as unschoolers, labelling them as &quot;gifted&quot; would do what? Make them <br/>
conceited? Make them think that their own particular kind of intelligence is <br/>
what counts and that the really WONDERFUL car mechanic we have is somehow <br/>
less gifted because he has a different kind of intelligence?  I can&#39;t see any <br/>
good coming from labelling them with anything at all - as unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d use more descriptive words for REAL traits, instead. In the case of <br/>
giftedness, I have a child with extraordinary interpersonal intelligence and <br/>
I have ALWAYS talked to her about her amazing ability to understand people <br/>
and their behaviors and motivations, etc. She has always needed to talk about <br/>
it a lot because it is NOT always easy to have much greater understanding of <br/>
human behavior than everyone around you. We don&#39;t call her &quot;gifted&quot; - but we <br/>
might talk about what its like to have such understanding as she has. Another <br/>
daughter loves language - words, meanings, foreign languges, and all kinds of <br/>
literary expression. We don&#39;t call her &quot;gifted.&quot; We just know that she&#39;s <br/>
interested in words and languages and we support that. Labelling her wouldn&#39;t <br/>
change how we live because we support and facilitate her own particular <br/>
specific way of being.<br/>
<br/>
The traits that, put together, are called ADD are still just personal, <br/>
individual traits and not all kids or adults have all of them and they can be <br/>
expressed very differently in different people. As a parent of a kid with a <br/>
lot of those traits, I&#39;d want to read the ADD literature, etc., to get ideas <br/>
and support. But I wouldn&#39;t want my children to have that label in their <br/>
heads anymore, maybe less, than I&#39;d want them to have the &quot;gifted&quot; label in <br/>
their heads. <br/>
<br/>
I would use the traits my child actually has -- when talking to my child <br/>
about her own personality and behavior - but not the label. <br/>

<br/>
Dear Pam and All,<br/>
<br/>
I thought your response to the ADD discussion was very well put!<br/>
<br/>
I would like to introduce myself.  We are new to homeschooling. We started in <br/>
January after I pulled my son out of school. He was truly miserable after <br/>
having been mercilessly bullied, teased, excluded and treated like a weirdo. <br/>
He is an extremely bright 13 year old individualist. He too was labeled &quot;ADD&quot; <br/>
by the school system (and me, I&#39;m ashamed to say). That label that I <br/>
initially embraced (so that I could say &quot;It&#39;s not my fault, it&#39;s this rotten <br/>
condition&quot;) did nothing for him but justify adults at the school treating him <br/>
like a weirdo and imbecile. They dumbed down his work and radiated lowered <br/>
expectations like some sort of cancer. The parents followed their lead, and <br/>
the children followed the school adults and parents&#39; lead. At one time we <br/>
tried  Ritalin. He became an obedient miserable unimaginative robot. Ritalin <br/>
made us realize the wonderful side of his so-called condition, because <br/>
suddenly that brilliant spark was absent. Over the years I&#39;ve met many kids <br/>
labeled as ADD, and the only thing that they all seem to have in common is <br/>
their individuality. Yes, they can be frustrating, but that is because they <br/>
refuse to behave like servile sheep. <br/>
<br/>
Although we are doing a sort of eclectic school at home I am fascinated by <br/>
the unschooling philosophy and perhaps someday I&#39;ll have the guts to try it. <br/>
I believe that if we had unschooled from the beginning it would have been a <br/>
good thing. But we are starting rather late in the game, and there are so <br/>
many things that I want to be certain he learns. Public school was such an <br/>
incredible waste of time and energy.<br/>

There is no brain scan that I have ever heard of that will show ADD!! I can <br/>
only speak for FAS and ADD since that&#39;s my brothers difficulites.<br/>
The FAS is a real, true condition, brought on by his alcoholic birth mother <br/>
(he is adopted), the ADD was only real in the school system. It wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
mattered, nor would the label have been necessary out of that system.<br/>
He was medicated and told he had a disability and I believe with all my heart <br/>
that it helped lead him to the drug addicted, prison life he now lives.<br/>
My parent&#39;s did the best they knew how with the diagnoses they were given by <br/>
the phsycologist (NOT from a brain scan).<br/>
They were wrong. They loved him dearly, but they were wrong. <br/>
<br/>
Some people would rather hold onto labels than move into the life of <br/>
accepting their children for who they are, right now today, and just BE with <br/>
them (not talking about real life disabilities once again, don&#39;t want to <br/>
offend anyone dealing with those).<br/>
There isn&#39;t much we can do to help someone that needs labels more than they <br/>
need to honor their children for who they are.<br/>

you are stuck on the labels issue, I have seen no one on this<br/>
list who needs lables for thier kids than to honor their kids.<br/>
So who are you talking about ?<br/>
The parents who have children with disabilites whether it<br/>
is physical or mental issues on this list, have been the most<br/>
kind and insightful people. I also consider this an insult as<br/>
one of these parents.<br/>
Are we dealing again with the &quot;word&quot; game again? NOW&lt;<br/>
we can&#39;t use special needs, as you don&#39;t like it? And now<br/>
some of us have to tread lightly when writing? Come on,<br/>
give me a break.<br/>
Also, how dare you even make comments in regards to<br/>
a group of people, and make accusations of not accepting<br/>
these children for who they are? I do not know of any<br/>
parent of this issue not go above and beyond as a parent.<br/>

how I have mistaken your post.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dear, seet, and now dead brother Marty grew up in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s. <br/>
Parenting was so different then. He grew up with only the labels of <br/>
troublemaker, smartass, and JD. He spent years as a heroin and then a <br/>
methadone addict. He spent years in prison. I&#39;m sure if he were in the <br/>
school system as a child now, his labels would be more like ADHD, Dyslexia <br/>
or SID. Kinder maybe? Yes. Helpful? I don&#39;t think so. They would still be <br/>
labelling what was wrong with instead of celebrating what was right with him<br/>
<br/>
He was bright. VERY bright. He was charming beyond belief. His passion as a <br/>
child was making scale models of buildings he knew and visited. As an adult <br/>
he was a leiutenant in the Fire Dept., generous to a fault and owned his own <br/>
business. He went to his death still unconvinced that he was a worthy soul. <br/>
A perfect being. Special BEFORE his weak areas, not in spite of them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My parent&#39;s did the best they knew how&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine did too. And they LOVED him fiercely in spite of it all. They didn&#39;t <br/>
know how to reach him. No one ever told them it was okay to be <br/>
unconventional. They didn&#39;t know how to let go and help him move with his <br/>
strengths.<br/>
<br/>
But I do. I know that I can label my kids&#39; with places they can improve and <br/>
hold that in my heart as part of Who They Are, or I can let it go. I can <br/>
celebrate and talk about what makes them good and right and special. Even in <br/>
the midst of flying tantrums and teenage moods. I can reassure them day <br/>
after day that Who They Are is all they need to be. They can change some <br/>
behaviors, they can challenge their minds, they can buff up their bodies. <br/>
But in the end they are Who They Are and that&#39;s good.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
I have never said anything about the term &quot;special needs&quot; not once. Are you <br/>
reading, or knee jerk reacting?<br/>
I don&#39;t like the term &quot;disabled&quot; and I explained why.<br/>
As a person that has cared for chilren with mental disabilities including <br/>
very real things like Downs Syndrome (hell, I&#39;ve had coworkers with Downs <br/>
too), dealt with ADD and FAS in my family, been around children with intense <br/>
sensitivities (my nephews, niece and my youngest child would all fit the <br/>
extremely sensitive/needy/temper tantrumy descriptions) I take offense to <br/>
your tone that I don&#39;t seem to have a clue.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Also, how dare you even make comments in regards to<br/>
a group of people, and make accusations of not accepting<br/>
these children for who they are?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a pretty testy tone for someone to take when they just posted that <br/>
they will &quot;write what they want as a list member&quot;.<br/>
You seem to have Teresa&#39;s ability to read accusations into general comments, <br/>
not even aimed at ANYONE in particular. Phew! It must be draining to go <br/>
around assuming so much about what folks are saying.....<br/>
<br/>
Here was my comment that seemed to set you off:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some people would rather hold onto labels than move into the life of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Read the SOME PEOPLE....it&#39;s a general comment about how people think they <br/>
need the ADD or ADHD label. I dont think it&#39;s the best way to see your child, <br/>
holding onto unecessary labels.<br/>
It isn&#39;t honoring them for who they are as well as you can without the label.<br/>
It&#39;s how  a person sees their child. <br/>
Are you saying that a parent seeing a disability, where it&#39;s just a <br/>
uniqueness of the individual, is going to be able to honor that child as well?<br/>
Because I disagree.<br/>
<br/>
But once again, a general comment got turned into an assumption that it was <br/>
about a specific person, when it wasn&#39;t.<br/>
To me, that&#39;s a sign that there is something there for you to think about.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Interesting topic.<br/>
&gt; When we look at these disabilities, maybe what we know now vs. 20<br/>

&gt; have saved alot of heartache for family members. <br/>

A parent has to go beyond the perimiters set, and recognize that one can<br/>
open the world to this child.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Are we dealing again with the &quot;word&quot; game again?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are dealing in words.<br/>
It&#39;s not a game.<br/>
Lives are changed here.<br/>
<br/>
Words can be hurtful.<br/>
Labelling kids can hurt them.  A deaf kid will know he&#39;s deaf.   <br/>
A child whose attention span doesn&#39;t fit school&#39;s 50 minute lesson <br/>
requirements does NOT need be labelled if he&#39;s unschooled.  A child who is <br/>
great at spatial and math but really not so great at reading until he&#39;s a <br/>
little older does not need to be labelled if he&#39;s unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
Are you kidding me? Think about this, <br/>
you are stuck on the labels issue, I have seen no one on this<br/>
list who needs lables for thier kids than to honor their kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whether you&#39;ve seen it or not, it happens.<br/>
Whether there are any on this list at the moment doing it, it happens.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The parents who have children with disabilites whether it<br/>
is physical or mental issues on this list, have been the most<br/>
kind and insightful people. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you miss the posts that said that there are kids here who would have been <br/>
labelled had they gone to school, but since they didn&#39;t go to school they <br/>
weren&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
What constitutes a disability?  A doctor&#39;s diagnosis or the symptoms?<br/>
The parents desire to label the symptoms?<br/>
If a parent refuses the diagnosis or the symptoms, choosing instead to honor <br/>
each child as an unlabelled, uncompared individual, do they then go into your <br/>
category of not knowing anything about special needs kids?<br/>
<br/>
If you think this is nothing but word games, maybe dealing in words isn&#39;t <br/>
your strength.  That&#39;s okay.  It&#39;s not a disability not to be great with <br/>
words, but the things I&#39;m really not good at, I don&#39;t jump in and mess up.  I <br/>
don&#39;t play rugby or volleyball; I don&#39;t keep books for any clubs I&#39;m in.  <br/>
Others can do that better.  I&#39;m competent to sing.  Some people have no <br/>
business pushing forward and singing, if they can&#39;t carry a tune, don&#39;t know <br/>
the lyrics, can&#39;t harmonize or read the music (whatever&#39;s involved in <br/>
whatever singing project is at hand.<br/>
<br/>
So I sing and I write.  I don&#39;t do sports or bookkeeping.<br/>
<br/>
If you think discussions about terminology and categorization are &#39;word <br/>
games,&#39; maybe you&#39;re trying to sing without being able to hear the <br/>
differences in the tones we&#39;re using.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And now some of us have to tread lightly when writing? Come on,<br/>
give me a break.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tread lightly&quot; meaning not go beyond what they know?<br/>
&quot;Tread lightly&quot; meaning not be hateful or disruptive?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, how dare you even make comments in regards to<br/>
a group of people, and make accusations of not accepting<br/>
these children for who they are? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have seen many homeschooling parents look for excuses and labels to justify <br/>
why their children are &#39;behind.&#39;  They would rather declare their children to <br/>
be learning disabled and ADHD than to change their methods or risk being <br/>
blamed for not being good homeschooling moms.  I could name you names of <br/>
people I know in person, but I won&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
If you  hang around homeschoolers long enough you&#39;ll see it too, unless you <br/>
don&#39;t want to see it.<br/>

ago and attacked, but I don&#39;t remember the name.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s a day or a month, though--newer members should <br/>
assume that people who&#39;ve been unschooling longer than they have might <br/>
actually know what they&#39;re talking about, rather than being so rude and <br/>
insulting.<br/>

THat is so sad Mary, I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
The heartache of seeing someone you love be so destructive is heartwrenching <br/>
at times. I remember the little curly headed, dark eyed toddler that stared <br/>
in shock when he came to be with our family.<br/>
He had chubby cheeks and an impish grin......it just kills me that his <br/>
problems ended up defining his life. I wish I could change something for him, <br/>
but I can&#39;t.<br/>
I can only do as you said. Give my own children the wonderful childhood that <br/>
they deserve and let them be who they are...perfect and whole.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234693444">&lt;&lt;Did you miss the posts that said that there are kids here who would have<br/>
been labelled had they gone to school, but since they didn&#39;t go to school<br/>
they weren&#39;t?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is the very thing that put us on our path to unschooling.  Our oldest<br/>
daughter went to PS because it was the thing to do.  I had never questioned<br/>
the system at that point in my life and I had loved school as a child, so<br/>
sending her to school was status quo.<br/>
<br/>
They first notified us that Ari was &quot;behind&quot; in her reading skills at the<br/>
beginning of 1st grade.  She was six.  The school sent her to be tutored at<br/>
a certain time in the afternoon while the other students did regular reading<br/>
in the classroom.  I had no idea at that point what kind of damage this was<br/>
doing to her self-esteem and her love of books, but the simple act of<br/>
labeling her a &quot;slow reader&quot; started her on a downward spiral.  She began to<br/>
fall behind in other areas she&#39;d previously displayed no difficulties with.<br/>
The day she came home and told me she&#39;d been moved to &quot;the dumb math class&quot;<br/>
I knew we had to do something drastic.  We pulled her from school and<br/>
haven&#39;t looked back.<br/>
<br/>
It took about a year and a half before Ari would even consider reading a<br/>
book.  She&#39;s nearly 12 now and while she&#39;s not a &quot;perfect&quot; reader, she does<br/>
read for pleasure and makes out just fine.  She&#39;s heavy into Shel<br/>
Silverstein right now, and has such a love for satire.  When I think of how<br/>
we&#39;d likely be struggling and fighting were she still in the system, it<br/>
makes me cringe.<br/>
<br/>
I think labels sometimes make people more comfortable because they confirm<br/>
that something is really *wrong* and the differences in the child aren&#39;t<br/>
anyone&#39;s fault.  But why do a child&#39;s differences have to be someone&#39;s<br/>
fault?  Why can&#39;t they just be seen as something unique about the child?<br/>
<br/>
And just to clarify, I&#39;m speaking of learning differences, not physical<br/>
differences.  Although I have 2 friends who have children with physical<br/>
differences who make homeschooling work quite well.  One is an unschooler<br/>
and the other is not.<br/>

kid is bad&quot; to &quot;your kid is damaged.&quot; I don&#39;t think those are the only two <br/>
choices. I personally have found a better way. My kids share many traits <br/>

taunted, teased or treated like outcasts. And it&#39;s not solely because <br/>
they&#39;re out of school, although that is a BIG part of it. They understand <br/>
themselves first and foremost to be okay just as they are. Sounds trite and <br/>
logical and simple, but we had to work to get here. We still work at it <br/>
everyday. They are not defined by a quirk or intensity or momentary <br/>
outburst. They are first and foremost bright and lovable and *able* beings. <br/>
The rest is just stuff to be worked on and worked out.<br/>

about you write about your own children and how unschooling works at your <br/>

<br/>
How about talking about unschooling instead of about people and posting?<br/>
<br/>
My kids have learned lots that I didn&#39;t bring to them.  Helping them find <br/>
more and more opportunities to learn is WAY more useful than teaching them.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter one single bit whether if they were in school they would be <br/>
ahead or behind or misunderstanding directions or &quot;gifted&quot; or &quot;special,&quot; <br/>
because each of them is living his or her own, real, whole life NOW.  REALLY <br/>
living, and really learning.  <br/>
<br/>
They have learned more without even realizing it was happening than all the <br/>
information that would have been on all the tests they would have taken if <br/>
they had been in school already for twelve or thirteen years.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us learned more outside school than inside too, probably.  But these <br/>
guys are SOLIDLY and fully learning without sorting out what&#39;s &quot;important&quot; <br/>
and what&#39;s &quot;trivia,&quot; because in the end none of it is trivia if it all fits <br/>
together to increase their understanding.<br/>

<br/>
This has been said before, but it&#39;s so helpful to repeat it as a mantra. The <br/>
long standing members of this group, the experienced unschoolers here, the <br/>
folks donating their time and energy online and IRL trying to help others <br/>
understand unschooling, are NOT out to tear anyone down. We don&#39;t know most <br/>
people here as anything other than a screen name and a question or comment.<br/>
<br/>
The newer members of this group, the new and not as experienced unschoolers <br/>
are looking for a way. If they are here, it must mean it&#39;s because they <br/>
think that talking with more experienced folks will help them get on the <br/>
path the are seeing, but not yet on.<br/>
<br/>
People have commented to me that I am very calm. That my zen nature really <br/>
does come through in my posts. If that&#39;s true, it&#39;s because I assume every <br/>
one here is coming from a good place. I try to act not react. I&#39;ve seen some <br/>
snarky remarks thrown my way in the last couple of days. I let them flow <br/>
past me. Why would I want to capture them, hold them and react to them? Much <br/>
better for my soul to let them float on by so that I can concentrate on <br/>
being my best self.<br/>
<br/>
I try to picture the best parts of every person on this list, even when it <br/>
seems hard or impossible. It&#39;s what I do for my kids and what I try to do <br/>
with all my human interactions.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re comrades. We&#39;re allies in unschooling. We want the best for each <br/>
other. We disagree. We agree. It is what is.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

are celebrated even if they aren&#39;t &quot;math and verbal&quot;. She doesn&#39;t want them <br/>
to feel that they are &quot;damaged&quot; even if that&#39;s the message they get from kids <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14676168">This is exactly the reason why we are unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
My older brother is the same way,  but is going to be OK,  has been treated and is healing himself now, at age 47.     I have been explaining unschooling to my bro lately and he is amazed at this thinking.    He said to me, which really touched me, &quot;Alec is lucky to have you as his mom&quot;,   it was such a rush.   I sat there crying on the phone.<br/>
 <br/>
  So much of the time I beat myself up with what I am doing wrong and its really difficult sometimes to see the good I&#39;m doing.    My brother pointed it out.       I <br/>
 <br/>
I am so happy to have found unschooling.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dear, seet, and now dead brother Marty grew up in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s. <br/>
Parenting was so different then. He grew up with only the labels of <br/>
troublemaker, smartass, and JD. He spent years as a heroin and then a <br/>
methadone addict. He spent years in prison. I&#39;m sure if he were in the <br/>
school system as a child now, his labels would be more like ADHD, Dyslexia <br/>
or SID. Kinder maybe? Yes. Helpful? I don&#39;t think so. They would still be <br/>
labelling what was wrong with instead of celebrating what was right with him<br/>
<br/>
He was bright. VERY bright. He was charming beyond belief. His passion as a <br/>
child was making scale models of buildings he knew and visited. As an adult <br/>
he was a leiutenant in the Fire Dept., generous to a fault and owned his own <br/>
business. He went to his death still unconvinced that he was a worthy soul. <br/>
A perfect being. Special BEFORE his weak areas, not in spite of them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My parent&#39;s did the best they knew how&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine did too. And they LOVED him fiercely in spite of it all. They didn&#39;t <br/>
know how to reach him. No one ever told them it was okay to be <br/>
unconventional. They didn&#39;t know how to let go and help him move with his <br/>
strengths.<br/>
<br/>
But I do. I know that I can label my kids&#39; with places they can improve and <br/>
hold that in my heart as part of Who They Are, or I can let it go. I can <br/>
celebrate and talk about what makes them good and right and special. Even in <br/>
the midst of flying tantrums and teenage moods. I can reassure them day <br/>
after day that Who They Are is all they need to be. They can change some <br/>
behaviors, they can challenge their minds, they can buff up their bodies. <br/>
But in the end they are Who They Are and that&#39;s good.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

Feel free to start posting about your family&#39;s unschooling anytime here.<br/>
<br/>
If you stop posting about labels when YOU want to, that&#39;s great.<br/>
Others will stop when they want to.<br/>
<br/>
It IS a crucial part of changing attitudes from school-based standards to <br/>
natural learning.<br/>
