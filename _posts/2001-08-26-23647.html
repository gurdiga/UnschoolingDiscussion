&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve gotten this from several unschoolers at one of my local homeschool <br/>
 groups. I spoke to them about bringing my children with me when I volunteer <br/>
 at our local elderly home and how I was hoping to expose my children to <br/>
 people of different generations as we dont&#39; have elderly family members in <br/>
 our lives. I was told that if my children needed the elderly contact they <br/>
 would let me know. They way I saw it my children wouldn&#39;t feel the want for <br/>
 contact with elderly people if they haven&#39;t been around them. There are <br/>
other <br/>
 examples, but that is the one that stood out in my mind of unschoolers <br/>
 feeling children will let parents know when they need something and that the <br/>
 children don&#39;t need exposure.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Kimberly, this is Kathy from the Riverside group. I am very surprised at<br/>
the comments you made regarding the unschoolers in your local group. I<br/>
would consider myself a radical unschooler, always have been, and think<br/>
that I know all if not most of the unschoolers in the Riverside group and<br/>
a couple in the Rancho group (I think there are only a couple in that group).<br/>
I am very surprised that anyone would tell<br/>
you not to expose your children to the elderly or anything else for that <br/>
matter.  Are you sure the persons you were talking to were unschoolers?<br/>
It just doesn&#39;t mesh with my experience with the members of our group.<br/>
You should have just asked me ; )<br/>
The only thing I could imagine someone saying would be that if your<br/>
children are already heavily involved in other activities it might not be<br/>
the time to add something else into the mix. Anyhow just trying to figure<br/>
out what you have been told or what the context was. Seems very<br/>
strange to me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82373403">Kathy- HI!  Well, I don&#39;t outright ask people whether or not they unschool, <br/>
but I&#39;m pretty sure the individuals invovled do. I figured them to be more <br/>
radical. I really didn&#39;t get what they were saying as to me, how can a child <br/>
know that so many wonderful things are out there unless they are exposed. I <br/>
never asked more indepth about it with the individuals as I clearly didn&#39;t <br/>
agree and there&#39;s no point in arguing over matters where we differ. I only <br/>
brought it up because I have experienced those who believe in not exposing <br/>
their child for the purpose of exposing. I, however, do this. When I hear of <br/>
a neat exibit at the museum, even if I&#39;m not overly excited about it I&#39;ll try <br/>
to take my children to see because they might become extremely interested. I <br/>
think these individuals believe that exposure should be left completely <br/>
natural or the child might feel forced. I&#39;m not really sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583085635">We can offer something and it is up to them if they are interested. I don&#39;t<br/>
see anything wrong with introducing something new to our children like you<br/>
mentioned as long as we are sensitive to the child&#39;s response.<br/>
