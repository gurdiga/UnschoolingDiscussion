<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307101495">I think you have gotten a lot of great advice here. I agree with it all. <br/>
Just think about when your kids were younger and what you had to do to get <br/>
out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
You started earlier and helped them all along the way. Taking articles of <br/>
clothing to them and either helping them or asking them to put something on. <br/>
Reminding them to go to the bathroom or brush their teeth or comb their hair <br/>
or just doing it all for them. I&#39;m sure if you just help you son along by <br/>
eith doing or helping him by being right there, he will get to the point <br/>
where he won&#39;t get as sidetracked. Just telling him right now and leaving <br/>
him just gives him way too much time to find other interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
Heck I find things half done throughout my house all the time from me going <br/>
from one thing to another and then finding something else I want to do <br/>
also!!!<br/>
