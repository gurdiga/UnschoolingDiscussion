&gt; kids won&#39;t know. None of it really matters, but I do know just from seeing <br/>
&gt; mine our first year homeschooling that they really do retain more when they <br/>
&gt; are seeking the knowledge.  <br/>
&gt; I honestly do worry about writing because my son&#39;s writing skills aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; very good compared to &quot;grade expectations&quot;. I don&#39;t mean physical writing <br/>
&gt; but sentence structure, etc. <br/>

He&#39;s the only homeschooler there but they treat him great. One time they <br/>
asked a question and all the other kids knew the answer except Christopher. <br/>
He didn&#39;t mind but his Dad did a little. I reminded his Dad of all the things <br/>
Christopher know that they don&#39;t and may never if it&#39;s not a part of school. <br/>
Christopher hates to write too! If use to get to me but since we started <br/>
unschooling I just let it go. I look at his Dad&#39;s handwriting and my brother <br/>
and even mine at time and ours isn&#39;t any better so I figured when he wants it <br/>
to look better he&#39;ll do it. <br/>
