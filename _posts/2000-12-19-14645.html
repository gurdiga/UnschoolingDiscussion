<div id="ygrps-yiv-22948987">Dear Julie inMO,<br/>
  Don&#39;t worry about hitting all your subject areas or filling up your<br/>
days with your unschooling approach.  I am a certified teacher from New<br/>
York who taught 3rd, 4th and 5th grades in the public school, and I now<br/>
do tutoring on the side for public school students who are out of school<br/>
temporarily.  I follow an unschooling approach with my own children as<br/>
well, but I never worry about covering my bases because I know from<br/>
experience how little time is actually spent on academics in school. <br/>
Most of the time  is spent on discipline, sorting, passing out paperwork,<br/>
lining up to go back and forth to &#39;specials&#39;, and watching films.  As a<br/>
home teacher I work for three  districts. They all require 5 hours of<br/>
work a week for elementary students (1 hr. day) and 10 hrs. weekly (2hrs.<br/>
daily)  for high school kids.   By the time they return most of them are<br/>
either caught up or ahead of their classes.   <br/>
      Just trust yourself and what you are doing.   Remember that even if<br/>
you tried, you will probably never accomplish less than the daily<br/>
schedule in a public school.  The most important thing that you are<br/>
trying to produce here is not a child who &#39;gets&#39; what he is supposed to<br/>
know, but rather an individual who actively seeks out answers to life&#39;s<br/>
problems as an adult.  The crown jewel is the end product, not<br/>
necessarily the route we take to get there. Best of luck!   Amy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289850530">My husband and I just got back from a fundraiser art auction for a local school.  Interesting night out for unschoolers, but we were invited by family, it was a free meal, and it was for a good cause (extras for school kids, like field trips) so we were happy to go.  Several times over the course of the evening the fact that our children didn&#39;t go to school came up.  We ran the gamut of reactions, from &quot;you WHAT!! I DON&#39;T support that!!!&quot; (from a school teacher) to &quot;you WHAT!! What a great idea! Tell me more!!&quot; (from parents of school kids).<br/>
It was an interesting evening.<br/>
But what touched me was to come home and read this:<br/>
<br/>
***Holly&#39;s often in my lap, even though she&#39;s <br/>
big.***<br/>
<br/>
A kid over 10 in his/her parent&#39;s lap is a rare, and beautiful, thing to see.  (or hear about) :-)<br/>
<br/>
I recently had a parent of a five year old complain to me that since her son started kindergarten he wouldn&#39;t kiss her goodbye in the morning in front of his friends in the school yard.  The sad part is that he probably *really * wanted to kiss her. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  I remember being about 13 when my mom touching me out in public became kind of skeevy. I loved her and all, but I mean really, what if someone saw? At home we were touchy and I sat on both my mom and dads laps well after I was grown and gone. But public was different when I was younger. It got to be fine once I moved away from home and grew up.<br/>
<br/>
  Tara at 17 is extremely touchy with us, me especially. When we did the whole Oprah thing and they came here to tape some stuff, the producer wanted us looking at a photo album together. He asked us how we would usually sit. Tara said with me at the table and her on my lap. He said &quot;REALLY?&quot; and the answer was yes. That&#39;s how they filmed it. <br/>
<br/>
  She&#39;s not different at all in public. She has no problem where ever we are of walking hand in hand with me or our arms around each other. She&#39;ll kiss us all no matter where we are too. In front of school or work or her friends. It&#39;s nice. I love it and certainly hope the other 3 will be the same way. And anytime she leaves me, even from conversation on the phone, she always says she loves me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229604161">This post touched me. I hadnt really thought about Brianna sitting on my<br/>
lap, or holding hands w/ me as we walk. Shes a tall ten, Im 52 (barely).<br/>
Yet, its so right. Last evening, she was weepy, she came and sat on my lap<br/>
at the keyboard. We finished up our web site work and went on to other<br/>
things. Brianna needed to be cuddled. And, as a mom of adults, I know how<br/>
fleeting this is.<br/>
Thanks for this,<br/>
Peace,<br/>

  &lt;&lt;Hi,<br/>
  I must have missed it; I was ill for 5 weeks and only skimmed posts. When<br/>
  were you in Oprah?? I&#39;d love to hear about it!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Oh yeah you really missed it and it had nothing to do with you being sick!! It was way back at the end of November. The Tuesday before Thanksgiving to be exact.<br/>
<br/>
  I saw a show that hit a note about not being negative on body and self image in front of your children. Teenage daughters especially. I was doing that and also at the same wondering why Tara was being negative about the way she looked. It was a lightbulb moment and I just wrote a quick e-mail to the show to say thank you. Next thing I know they are calling me on the phone, showing up at my house to film and flying Tara and I to Chicago for a 2 minute segment on the show. Pretty crazy but fun. Tara and I had a chance to be alone and do something different and together for more than a few hours for the first time in 8 years!! Sierra and Alyssa got to be on the show through the footage they filmed at my house. Joseph didn&#39;t want to be involved. <br/>
<br/>
  Tara had never been on an airplane before and had never seen snow and neither one of us had ever been to Chicago. She got to fly out in daylight, see the sky at night coming back, check out Chicago city life and the first night we were there, the heavens just opened up for her and snowed big giant fluffy snowflakes like you see in the movies. She was loving it. We had a great time!!!<br/>
<br/>
  Wasn&#39;t our first brush with our 15 minutes of fame but surely the most memorable.<br/>

We may have seen you.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;Hi,<br/>
  I must have missed it; I was ill for 5 weeks and only skimmed posts. When<br/>
  were you in Oprah?? I&#39;d love to hear about it!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Oh yeah you really missed it and it had nothing to do with you being<br/>
sick!! It was way back at the end of November. The Tuesday before<br/>
Thanksgiving to be exact.<br/>
