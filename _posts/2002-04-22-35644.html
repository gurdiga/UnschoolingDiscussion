<br/>
I&#39;m curious why you didn&#39;t like the book?<br/>
<br/>
It really helped us with the children in our home & in a way, I feel it fits more with unschooling than other ideologies.<br/>
<br/>
When our children came to live with us, they were often angry (with good reason!) and had zero trust that adults could be helpful.  We&#39;re talking punching fists through walls, biting themselves, damaging everything, cursing, etc. .<br/>
<br/>
The standard D.C.F.S. line at the time was &quot;123 Magic&quot; or any other system of rewards and consequences.  Give them stickers, candy, t.v. time, money when they do something &quot;good&quot;, and a &quot;time out&quot;, or take something away (favorite toy or priviledge) when they do something &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it didn&#39;t take long to figure out that these techniques were WAY counterproductive for our children (and I believe now for any child - but indeed, my opinion is solely based on the dozen or so children who shared their lives with us in the past 5 1/2 years).<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Greene&#39;s book really tapped into a whole different mentality about kids with low tolerance for frustration & more challenging and upsetting behaviors.  What I got out of the book was to focus on the child, not the behavior.  A good example was cursing.  Instead of handing out a punishment when the child says *---*!  You take into consideration that if the child had better words to express themselves, they would - so model it for them, e.g. &quot;I can see you are very angry / upset that your sister ate the last twinkie.  Is there anything I can do to help you figure this out / feel better?&quot;.  (You ignore the cursing altogether.)  Eventually the child starts to put words with her / his feelings, and &quot;F--- Off&quot; becomes, &quot;I&#39;m really angry that you won&#39;t take me to the store right now to get some more Twinkies!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s based on believing that the child is good and doesn&#39;t enjoy exploding or the struggles anymore than we do, and that they are definitely not just trying to manipulate adults.  I have seen this work so well for our family over the years (and it does take months or years of patience and consistency) and I do see HUGE similarities with unschooling - especially in terms of believing the best about children and trusting them to do better and figure out what works better / feels better for them.<br/>
<br/>
He is also an advocate for compromise instead of &quot;My Way or the Highway&quot; parenting.  I find that this also fits with unschooling in terms of treating children as people with fewer years of life experience & communicating to them that their needs / wants / feelings are as important and valid as ours.<br/>
<br/>
He categorizes behaviors into &quot;baskets&quot;.  Basket A represents behaviors we can not compromise on, e.g. safety issues,  &quot;No you can not run across the Interstate, or jump into that stream of hot lava&quot;.  Everything else should be in basket B or C - B = compromise, and C = let the child learn it for themselves.  Totally unschooling!  He felt that in our culture, way too many parents put too many behaviors in basket A, &quot;You do it my way, even on the little things&quot;.  An example Dr. Greene gave was wearing a coat on a cold winter&#39;s day.  He felt this was a Basket C issue.  Don&#39;t argue or incite a tantrum - if the child is cold / she / he will come back inside and put on her / his coat.<br/>
<br/>
When I first read the book, it was scary, in a way just like unschooling.  I knew in my heart it was right.  My soul cried out, &quot;This is it!&quot;, but it requires making that leap of faith - I have to trust that my child will come in and put on their coat if they are cold, I have to trust that my child will stop cursing to express feelings if I continue to model something else, love them, and not react, I have to trust that they will learn what they need and want to learn!<br/>
<br/>
I read the book three years ago, and have not returned to it since.  The ideas I wrote about above are the general concepts I got out of the book and put into practice in our family.  For us, they worked well.  If you met my children, you would never suspect in a million years what we have all been through.  They are loving, caring kids with an amazing ability to express themselves & their feelings.  We still have our moments, but it is astounding compared to three and five years ago!<br/>
<br/>
Trust is key!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So YES - that was the book I meant. And what Shelley described is exactly <br/>
what I remember and what I got out of it. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you Shelly - for the review AND for rescuing me from my memory lapse.<br/>
<br/>
I should change the subject line, but I DO need some help with those &quot;senior <br/>
moments&quot; - those &quot;uh uh uh on the tip of my tongue can&#39;t quite remember <br/>
aaaargh my brain is hurting&quot; moments. I was having them so frequently that I <br/>
thought I was going to have to give up teaching - a few years ago. Then they <br/>
passed - I had started taking some hormones so I attributed the improvement <br/>
to that. But I seem to be getting it back again. Any suggestions will be <br/>
appreciated. I may have to ask you to remind me what you suggested, but I&#39;ll <br/>
appreciate it then too &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
