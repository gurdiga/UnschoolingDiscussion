<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; We are homeschooling parents and authors of &quot;The Complete Guide to<br/>
&gt; Homeschooling,&quot; due out in August.  Currently, we are researching information<br/>
&gt; for our newest book that will feature individual stories from successful<br/>
&gt; homeschooling graduates across the country.  It will be a collection of<br/>
&gt; wonderful stories centered on &quot;where they are now.&quot;  We are asking your help<br/>
&gt; in finding those special homeschoolers who have graduated, entered college,<br/>
&gt; the military, vocational programs or the work force and would like to share<br/>
&gt; their stories.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have prepared a survey for the graduates to answer, along with information<br/>
&gt; on how they can reach us.  We are asking you to perhaps acknowledge the<br/>
&gt; survey in your newsletter, give the survey to a support group, make copies<br/>
&gt; and distribute them to known homeschooled graduates, or call someone you know<br/>
&gt; that might be interested.  We need to reach as many graduates as possible<br/>
&gt; over the next few months to give this project the attention it deserves.  If<br/>
&gt; you would like us to send you a copy of the survey, please E-mail us ASAP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We appreciate your help with this project.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; John & Kathy Perry<br/>
