&gt;I was extremely shy in school and wouldn&#39;t talk. I too, had one friend.<br/>
&gt;So, the question is: Did school teach me socialization? No, it almost killed <br/>
&gt;me. <br/>
&gt;The bottom line is: School hurts innocent children. Thirteen years of <br/>
&gt;&quot;socialization&quot; and only one friend and I almost killed myself in the <br/>
&gt;process...yeah, socialization is the greatest.<br/>

I can definately identify with your situation.  Except that I became<br/>
depressed and suicidal LOOOOOONG before 16, unfortunately.  I began running<br/>
away from home, in a desperate effort to leave my pain behind, at age 5!  I<br/>
left notes when I was little, saying that no one loved me, because that was<br/>
how I &#39;felt.&#39;  In later years I just left.  <br/>
<br/>
I always came back however, because most of my problems followed me, of<br/>
course.  My problems were compounded by my own chemical imbalance that was<br/>
never diagnosed/treated as a child, and the fact that my parents never did<br/>
seek any help for me, no matter how bad things got.  My Fathers ex was a<br/>
therapist/counselor, and he loathed and avoided anyone in any profession<br/>
related to that like the plague.   <br/>
<br/>
My friends came from the city Zoo, where I volunteered for five years<br/>
beginnning at age 11.  Before that, my best friend was a Russian immigrant<br/>
who lived in my neighborhood, (she later moved away) and who&#39;s father<br/>
worked with mine.  School was not a friendly place for me.<br/>

          You sound alot like my dh. He is going to be 45 this year and we <br/>
(me and the doctors) are still trying to figure out how to help him. He is <br/>
very supportive of unschooling because of his years in p.s. <br/>
