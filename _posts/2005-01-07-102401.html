~Kelly<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
SCHOOL AT MY HOUSE<br/>
Susan Wise Bauer<br/>
Fall of 2000: a day with a fourth  and second grader, a four-year-old and a<br/>
newborn.<br/>
<br/>
7:30 AM.  I  wake up because my husband has brought me a cup of coffee and a<br/>
hungry  baby.  This the only way I get out of bed in the morning these  days,<br/>
what with feeding new baby Emily at 11 PM and again at 2:30.   She’s slept<br/>
since 2:30, though, so I’m feeling semi-human.  I sit up and  drink my coffee<br/>
while feeding the baby, while Peter gets ready for  work.  Today is my “long<br/>
day” with the children.  Peter and I both  work; we used to divide each day<br/>
in half, but since the new baby’s arrival we  have divided our weeks so that<br/>
I have the children from dawn to dusk on  Mondays and Wednesdays, while he<br/>
has them on Tuesdays and Thursdays.   Fridays we split in half; he works in<br/>
the morning, I work in the  afternoons.  Since Peter is schooling the boys in<br/>
math, reading, and  art, he does double math and reading lessons on Tuesdays<br/>
and  Thursdays.<br/>
<br/>
8 AM.  Peter leaves.  He has a meeting at 8 PM that  won’t be over until<br/>
midnight, so I don’t expect to see him for the rest of  the day.  I get up,<br/>
change the baby’s diaper, and put her on my bed  while I dress.  I can hear<br/>
the boys rattling around in their room; they  know they’re not supposed to<br/>
emerge (except for necessary bathroom visits)  until I come get them.  When I<br/>
’m dressed, I go in with the baby on one  arm and tell Christopher (9) and<br/>
Ben (7) to get dressed.  I put out  Daniel’s clothes; he’s four and going<br/>
through a serious do-it-myself  phase.<br/>
<br/>
8:15.  Christopher and Ben are running around in their  underwear and<br/>
giggling.  Daniel has his sweatpants on upside down with  both feet sticking<br/>
out of the waistband.  “Something is wrong here,” he  says.  I tell<br/>
Christopher and Ben to STOP TALKING UNTIL ALL THEIR  CLOTHES ARE ON and<br/>
reverse Daniel’s sweatpants.<br/>
<br/>
8:30  Breakfast;  Emily was happy to lie on her mat and look at her mirror<br/>
this morning, so  everyone gets scrambled eggs and toast.  On mornings when<br/>
she’s fussy,  they tend to get cereal with a spoonful of peanut butter for<br/>
protein  (disgusting, but effective).<br/>
<br/>
8:55  I tell Christopher and Ben to  STOP TALKING UNTIL THEIR BREAKFAST IS<br/>
GONE because we are due to start school  at 9 AM.<br/>
<br/>
9 AM.  No one is finished eating.  I am now carrying  Emily on my shoulder.<br/>
She spits up all down my back, so I go change my  shirt.<br/>
<br/>
9:15  We start school.  I have a chart for each of the  older boys.<br/>
Christopher’s says: Morning – Spelling, Grammar, Writing Strands,  History,<br/>
Piano Practice.  Afternoon – Science, Latin, Penmanship, Extra  Reading.  Ben<br/>
’s says: Morning – Spelling, English for the Thoughtful  Child, History,<br/>
Piano Practice, Phonics Pathways.  Afternoon – Science,  Spanish, Penmanship,<br/>
Extra Reading.  We vary the order in which we do  these subjects, but I try<br/>
to check them all off each day.  I tell them  that they can pick their first<br/>
subject and I’ll pick the second.   Christopher decides to start with<br/>
grammar; Ben wants to practice his  piano.  Christopher’s grammar is about<br/>
principle parts.  Ben starts  playing the piano, which makes the principle<br/>
parts even hard to understand,  so I tell him to go and play with Daniel<br/>
until I’ve talked through  Christopher’s grammar lesson.  They disappear into<br/>
the boys’ room.   Christopher and I slog through the present and present<br/>
participle.   Emily starts screaming.  We take the book over to the sofa and<br/>
I finish  explaining past and past participle while she nurses.<br/>
<br/>
9:20   Christopher is doing his grammar exercises; he usually does two pages<br/>
per  day.  I call Ben out to do his piano lesson.  Emily is still nursing,  so<br/>
I tell Daniel to bring me a book.  I read to him while Ben  plays.  This<br/>
raises the noise level in the house to something  approaching an airport<br/>
runway.  &quot;I can&#39;t think!&quot; Christopher says.   I tell him to take his grammar<br/>
book into his room to  finish.<br/>
<br/>
9:30  Ben is finished with his piano (ten minutes is about  all I can keep<br/>
him interested in).  I take Emily to the table to burp  her, pour Daniel a<br/>
bowl of Grape Nuts (it takes him FOREVER to eat Grape  Nuts), and start<br/>
explaining Ben’s spelling rule.  Emily begins to  scream, Daniel dumps out<br/>
the Grape-Nuts, and Christopher appears in tears  because he can’t figure out<br/>
his next exercise.  I tell Ben to get the  vacuum cleaner, Christopher to<br/>
take a break, and Daniel to stop yelling over  the spilled cereal.  I sit<br/>
down and rock Emily until she drifts off to  sleep, while Christopher vacuums<br/>
and Daniel winds himself up in the vacuum  hose and yells, “A snake!  A snake<br/>
is biting me!”<br/>
<br/>
9:45.   Emily’s in bed.  I re-explain principle parts to Christopher and  give<br/>
him a handful of chocolate chips to keep him going.  Everyone now  wants<br/>
chocolate chips, so I give Daniel a little cupful of them and tell him  to go<br/>
eat them in his “fort” (behind his bed).  I put Ben’s beside his  spelling<br/>
book and tell him he can have one after each spelling word that he  writes.<br/>
<br/>
10 AM  Emily is grousing again.  I know she&#39;s not ready  to get up, so I<br/>
decide to wait a couple of minutes and see whether she&#39;ll go  back to sleep.<br/>
This drives Ben crazy.  “Mom,” he keeps saying, “the baby  is crying!”  I <br/>
get<br/>
out his Phonics Pathways and tell him to think about  his phonics instead.<br/>
He’s reading me two pages a day, as a review of phonics  and spelling rules.<br/>
He reads the first two lines and then stops. &quot;Mom,&quot; he  says seriously, &quot;are<br/>
you sure you know how to take care of a  baby?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
10:10  Emily stops crying thirty seconds before I&#39;m ready to  go get her.<br/>
When I look in at her, she’s sound asleep.  I check  Christopher’s grammar<br/>
and give him his spelling book.  Today he’s doing  the second half of a<br/>
lesson, so I don’t have to explain anything.  I  start a pot of coffee, sit<br/>
Ben in front of his penmanship, and go to check on  Daniel.  He’s covered<br/>
with chocolate, (so is his sheet) but he’s happy,  so I don’t wipe him off.<br/>
(I ignore the sheet, on the theory that it&#39;s been  hit with worse.)<br/>
<br/>
10:30  We take a snack and coffee outside for the  men working on the sawmill<br/>
(I take the baby monitor with me.)   Christopher and Ben go off to play.  In<br/>
five minutes they reappear with  Ben weeping.  “Christopher says he has to<br/>
clean the bunny cage before he  can play with me!”  Ben wails.  “Christopher,<br/>
play with Ben  first.”  “But he wants to play that we’re sweet kittens<br/>
playing in the  woods,” Christopher says.  “Why can’t you play sweet<br/>
kittens?” I  ask.  “Because it’s stupid,” he says, “and I want to pretend<br/>
that we’re  raptors.”  “Go play kittens for ten minutes,” I say, “and then<br/>
clean the  bunny cage.”<br/>
<br/>
11 AM  Break is over.  I collect Daniel, who has  been in the sawdust pile<br/>
and now has sawdust sticking to the chocolate on his  face.  When I call<br/>
Christopher inside, he says, “But I have to clean the  bunny cage.”  “What<br/>
have you been doing all this time?” I ask.   “Playing sweet kittens,” he<br/>
says.  Ben adds, “Sweet kittens being hunted  by raptors.”<br/>
<br/>
11:05  Christopher is upset because I told him not to  check on the bunny<br/>
until lunch time (“If you don’t do it when I tell you to,  you’ll have to<br/>
wait until your next break”) and he is now convinced that the  bunny is dying<br/>
of thirst.  Emily is awake and crying.  I sit down  to feed Emily again and<br/>
read Daniel another book while Ben plays with  Legos.<br/>
<br/>
11:30  Emily is happy, so I put everyone on the sofa and  start history.<br/>
Today we’re working on our Presidents Memorization Project –  we color<br/>
pictures of two presidents from the Bellerophon coloring book,  Christopher<br/>
looks them up in the encyclopedia and writes down two interesting  facts<br/>
about each president, and we all chant the presidents in order.   We’re up to<br/>
Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren.  I tell Christopher and  Ben to STOP<br/>
TALKING UNTIL THEIR PICTURES ARE COLORED.<br/>
<br/>
12:00  I  fix lunch one-handed and call everyone to the table.<br/>
<br/>
12:30  I tell  Christopher and Ben to STOP TALKING UNTIL THEIR FOOD IS ALL<br/>
GONE because they  still have work to do before rest time.<br/>
<br/>
12:45.  I put Emily in her  cradle and clear away lunch half-eaten.  Ben<br/>
bursts into tears because  he isn’t finished.  Christopher asks for dessert.<br/>
I tell Ben to sit on  his bed, Christopher that he can’t have any dessert,<br/>
and Daniel to go  potty.  Emily is screaming.  “Emily is screaming!” Ben<br/>
yells from  his bed.  “Do I have to do my Writing Strands?” Christopher asks.<br/>
“My  pants are a little bit wet,” Daniel shouts from the bathroom.  I yell  <br/>
at<br/>
the top of my lungs, “Everybody be quiet before I lose my mind!”   There is a<br/>
short silence.  Daniel says politely, from the bathroom, “You  don’t have to<br/>
be so loud, Mommy.”<br/>
<br/>
12:50  Daniel has dry pants,  Ben is copying three exclamations from his<br/>
English for the Thoughtful Child  Book, and I’m explaining Christopher’s<br/>
Writing Strands exercise to him.   He takes it off to do it in his room.  I<br/>
correct Ben’s penmanship and  send him and Daniel to bed for mandatory rest<br/>
time.  Daniel is listening  to “How to Eat Fried Worms” on his tape recorder;<br/>
Ben is listening to “The  Dark Is Rising” and playing with Legos.<br/>
Christopher brings me his writing  exercise.  I tell him to save his piano<br/>
lesson until after rest  time.<br/>
<br/>
1 PM.  I leave the baby monitor with my mother (her house is  attached to<br/>
ours) and go for a walk.<br/>
<br/>
2 PM. I get back from my walk and  answer a couple of e-mails before Emily<br/>
wakes up and wants to be  fed.<br/>
<br/>
3 PM.  The boys get up.  I’ve learned not to try to leap  directly into<br/>
school after nap time; I let them eat cookies and play for a  little while<br/>
until they start to bicker.  “School time!” I say, and send  Christopher to<br/>
play his piano.  I give Daniel scissors and colored  paper, and he promptly<br/>
begins to make a phenomenal mess all over the kitchen  floor.  Ben reads to<br/>
me from his current “Extra Reading” book – a book  that goes along with<br/>
history or science (Peter does their imaginative reading  with them on<br/>
Tuesdays and Thursdays). Today he’s reading Can’t You Make Them  Behave, King<br/>
George?  I sit down to listen, but Emily cries, so I get up  and walk around<br/>
the kitchen while Ben reads.  Halfway through the first  page, Emily dirties<br/>
her diaper, my shirt, her blanket, and her sleeper.   Ben follows me into our<br/>
bedroom, still reading, while Christopher bangs out  “The Bells” for the<br/>
fourth time, Daniel sings along, I change the diaper, and  Emily screams.<br/>
The noise level has once again reached airport level.  I  say, in an<br/>
unnaturally calm voice, “Ben, could you please stop reading to me  until I’m<br/>
finished with Emily’s diaper?”<br/>
<br/>
3:30.  Emily doesn’t  want to be put down.  I had intended to do another<br/>
Latin lesson with  Christopher today, but I’m starting to feel like I’ve HAD<br/>
it, so I tell him  to review his vocabulary cards and then send all of them<br/>
outside to run  around while I start supper.<br/>
<br/>
3:45  I give up on supper and rock  Emily.<br/>
<br/>
4 PM  I’m still rocking Emily.  The boys come back  in.  “Go outside some<br/>
more,” I say.<br/>
<br/>
4:15  I nurse Emily  again.<br/>
<br/>
4:30 Still rocking Emily.  The boys come in again.  I  tell Christopher to<br/>
read Daniel a book and Ben to get his penmanship book  out.<br/>
<br/>
4:45  Emily is asleep.  I threaten everyone with instant  death if they wake<br/>
her up.  They think this is funny and start to howl  with laughter at the top<br/>
of their lungs.  Emily cries.  I go in the  bathroom, shut the door, and<br/>
count to twenty.  Daniel sticks his fingers  under the door and says, “Look,<br/>
Daniel fingers!”<br/>
<br/>
5 PM.  I decide  that we should all walk down to the mailbox instead of<br/>
trying to do  science.  I give Mom the monitor again, and we borrow three<br/>
flashlights  from her (it’s already dark, and I have no batteries.  Ever.)<br/>
The  mailbox is a quarter of a mile away, and the night is beautiful.  By  the<br/>
time we get back I feel better.  I fix everybody sandwiches and  potato chips<br/>
for supper.  (They think this is great).<br/>
<br/>
5:50   I tell Christopher and Benjamin to STOP TALKING AND EAT or I will take<br/>
their  potato chips away.  They cram all the chips into their mouths.   I<br/>
decide that we will save manners lessons until Emily is older.<br/>
<br/>
6  PM.  Emily wakes up.  I get out the Science in a Nutshell kit that  we’re<br/>
doing (Gears) and give everyone gears, then sit down and nurse Emily  while<br/>
we go through the project.  Christopher loves to keep his Science  Journal,<br/>
but Ben has to be prompted for every question and answer.  I’m  still writing<br/>
them down for him, since his penmanship is very slow and  difficult; today my<br/>
hands are full, so I tell him he gets the day off from  recording his<br/>
experiments.  Daniel puts gear stickers on his head and  says, “Look, I’m a<br/>
gear machine.”<br/>
<br/>
7 PM  I tell Ben that we’re not  doing Spanish (again).  “We never get to<br/>
Spanish,” he says.  This  is unfortunately true.  Maybe I’ll outsource it to<br/>
a neighbor next  year.  I check the lists; Christopher didn’t do his cursive<br/>
practice,  but I decide that his life will be complete without it.  I tell<br/>
the boys  to get their pajamas on and clean up their room while I rock Emily,<br/>
who is  screaming (again).<br/>
<br/>
7:15  Emily gets happy and everyone wants to hold  her.  We take turns while<br/>
I read to Daniel.<br/>
<br/>
7:30  Daniel  goes to bed.  I play Uno with Christopher and Ben while Emily<br/>
sits on my  lap.<br/>
<br/>
8 PM.  I read Ben a book and put him in bed.  I rock Emily  back to sleep<br/>
while Christopher sits on the sofa and reads.<br/>
<br/>
8:30   I send Christopher to bed and put Emily in her cradle.  She<br/>
immediately  wakes up and howls.  Eventually I pick her up and pretend I’m<br/>
doing  aerobics, which sends back to sleep.  I put her back down and sneak<br/>
out  of the room.<br/>
<br/>
9 PM  Boy, it would be nice to go to  bed.<br/>
<br/>
9:30  Lights out for the boys.  Daniel is asleep; I pray  with the two older<br/>
boys, listen to Christopher’s worries, and answer twelve  questions from Ben.<br/>
I know Emily will be up to eat again soon, so I decide to  work on e-mail<br/>
again until she wakes up.<br/>
<br/>
AND A FINAL NOTE TO THIS  PAGE, added June, 2001:  WE DID HAVE A GOOD TIME<br/>
THIS DAY!  We  played Uno, messed around with gears, went for a great walk in<br/>
the dark, dug  in the sawdust and read three books that kept the boys<br/>
enthralled.  It  was ALSO frantic and tiring; that&#39;s real life with four<br/>
children under  nine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yuck.  Aside from all the obvious horrible things about this, what <br/>
really gets on my nerves is her delivery of the story.  It&#39;s that <br/>
snarky, almost condescending way that some moms have when they describe <br/>
how difficult it can be to be a wife and mother.  You know, like those <br/>
two women who had a tv show for a while--I think it was called &quot;The <br/>
Mommies&quot;--and they also did a bunch of commercials for aluminum foil or <br/>
something.  Their &quot;bit&quot; was the sarcastic, put-out, knowing-look-giving, <br/>
kind of thing where they complained about their kids/spouses in an <br/>
effort to be funny.  Another one that comes to mind is Vicki Iovine, the <br/>
author of &quot;The Girlfriend&#39;s Guide to Pregnancy&quot; and other books.  She&#39;s <br/>
the one that compared homebirth to animal slaughter (although I do have <br/>
to admit that some of her description of pregnancy symptoms were pretty <br/>
darn funny).<br/>
<br/>
The overall impression that I get is that this woman&#39;s homeschool is way <br/>
more about HER than it is about her kids.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; SCHOOL AT MY HOUSE<br/>
&gt; Susan Wise Bauer<br/>
&gt; Fall of 2000: a day with a fourth  and second grader, a four-year-old <br/>
&gt; and a<br/>
&gt; newborn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 7:30 AM.  I  wake up because my husband has brought me a cup of coffee <br/>
&gt; and a<br/>
&gt; hungry  baby.  This the only way I get out of bed in the morning these <br/>
&gt;  days,<br/>
&gt; what with feeding new baby Emily at 11 PM and again at 2:30.   She’s <br/>
&gt; slept<br/>
&gt; since 2:30, though, so I’m feeling semi-human.  I sit up and  drink my <br/>
&gt; coffee<br/>
&gt; while feeding the baby, while Peter gets ready for  work.  Today is my <br/>
&gt; “long<br/>
&gt; day” with the children.  Peter and I both  work; we used to divide <br/>
&gt; each day<br/>
&gt; in half, but since the new baby’s arrival we  have divided our weeks <br/>
&gt; so that<br/>
&gt; I have the children from dawn to dusk on  Mondays and Wednesdays, <br/>
&gt; while he<br/>
&gt; has them on Tuesdays and Thursdays.   Fridays we split in half; he <br/>
&gt; works in<br/>
&gt; the morning, I work in the  afternoons.  Since Peter is schooling the <br/>
&gt; boys in<br/>
&gt; math, reading, and  art, he does double math and reading lessons on <br/>
&gt; Tuesdays<br/>
&gt; and  Thursdays.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8 AM.  Peter leaves.  He has a meeting at 8 PM that  won’t be over <br/>
&gt; until<br/>
&gt; midnight, so I don’t expect to see him for the rest of  the day.  I <br/>
&gt; get up,<br/>
&gt; change the baby’s diaper, and put her on my bed  while I dress.  I can <br/>
&gt; hear<br/>
&gt; the boys rattling around in their room; they  know they’re not <br/>
&gt; supposed to<br/>
&gt; emerge (except for necessary bathroom visits)  until I come get them.  <br/>
&gt; When I<br/>
&gt; ’m dressed, I go in with the baby on one  arm and tell Christopher (9) <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; Ben (7) to get dressed.  I put out  Daniel’s clothes; he’s four and <br/>
&gt; going<br/>
&gt; through a serious do-it-myself  phase.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8:15.  Christopher and Ben are running around in their  underwear and<br/>
&gt; giggling.  Daniel has his sweatpants on upside down with  both feet <br/>
&gt; sticking<br/>
&gt; out of the waistband.  “Something is wrong here,” he  says.  I tell<br/>
&gt; Christopher and Ben to STOP TALKING UNTIL ALL THEIR  CLOTHES ARE ON and<br/>
&gt; reverse Daniel’s sweatpants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8:30  Breakfast;  Emily was happy to lie on her mat and look at her <br/>
&gt; mirror<br/>
&gt; this morning, so  everyone gets scrambled eggs and toast.  On mornings <br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; she’s fussy,  they tend to get cereal with a spoonful of peanut butter <br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; protein  (disgusting, but effective).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8:55  I tell Christopher and Ben to  STOP TALKING UNTIL THEIR <br/>
&gt; BREAKFAST IS<br/>
&gt; GONE because we are due to start school  at 9 AM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9 AM.  No one is finished eating.  I am now carrying  Emily on my <br/>
&gt; shoulder.<br/>
&gt; She spits up all down my back, so I go change my  shirt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:15  We start school.  I have a chart for each of the  older boys.<br/>
&gt; Christopher’s says: Morning – Spelling, Grammar, Writing Strands,  <br/>
&gt; History,<br/>
&gt; Piano Practice.  Afternoon – Science, Latin, Penmanship, Extra  <br/>
&gt; Reading.  Ben<br/>
&gt; ’s says: Morning – Spelling, English for the Thoughtful  Child, <br/>
&gt; History,<br/>
&gt; Piano Practice, Phonics Pathways.  Afternoon – Science,  Spanish, <br/>
&gt; Penmanship,<br/>
&gt; Extra Reading.  We vary the order in which we do  these subjects, but <br/>
&gt; I try<br/>
&gt; to check them all off each day.  I tell them  that they can pick their <br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt; subject and I’ll pick the second.   Christopher decides to start with<br/>
&gt; grammar; Ben wants to practice his  piano.  Christopher’s grammar is <br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; principle parts.  Ben starts  playing the piano, which makes the <br/>
&gt; principle<br/>
&gt; parts even hard to understand,  so I tell him to go and play with <br/>
&gt; Daniel<br/>
&gt; until I’ve talked through  Christopher’s grammar lesson.  They <br/>
&gt; disappear into<br/>
&gt; the boys’ room.   Christopher and I slog through the present and <br/>
&gt; present<br/>
&gt; participle.   Emily starts screaming.  We take the book over to the <br/>
&gt; sofa and<br/>
&gt; I finish  explaining past and past participle while she nurses.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:20   Christopher is doing his grammar exercises; he usually does two <br/>
&gt; pages<br/>
&gt; per  day.  I call Ben out to do his piano lesson.  Emily is still <br/>
&gt; nursing,  so<br/>
&gt; I tell Daniel to bring me a book.  I read to him while Ben  plays.  <br/>
&gt; This<br/>
&gt; raises the noise level in the house to something  approaching an <br/>
&gt; airport<br/>
&gt; runway.  &quot;I can&#39;t think!&quot; Christopher says.   I tell him to take his <br/>
&gt; grammar<br/>
&gt; book into his room to  finish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:30  Ben is finished with his piano (ten minutes is about  all I can <br/>
&gt; keep<br/>
&gt; him interested in).  I take Emily to the table to burp  her, pour <br/>
&gt; Daniel a<br/>
&gt; bowl of Grape Nuts (it takes him FOREVER to eat Grape  Nuts), and start<br/>
&gt; explaining Ben’s spelling rule.  Emily begins to  scream, Daniel dumps <br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; the Grape-Nuts, and Christopher appears in tears  because he can’t <br/>
&gt; figure out<br/>
&gt; his next exercise.  I tell Ben to get the  vacuum cleaner, Christopher <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; take a break, and Daniel to stop yelling over  the spilled cereal.  I <br/>
&gt; sit<br/>
&gt; down and rock Emily until she drifts off to  sleep, while Christopher <br/>
&gt; vacuums<br/>
&gt; and Daniel winds himself up in the vacuum  hose and yells, “A snake!  <br/>
&gt; A snake<br/>
&gt; is biting me!”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:45.   Emily’s in bed.  I re-explain principle parts to Christopher <br/>
&gt; and  give<br/>
&gt; him a handful of chocolate chips to keep him going.  Everyone now  <br/>
&gt; wants<br/>
&gt; chocolate chips, so I give Daniel a little cupful of them and tell him <br/>
&gt;  to go<br/>
&gt; eat them in his “fort” (behind his bed).  I put Ben’s beside his  <br/>
&gt; spelling<br/>
&gt; book and tell him he can have one after each spelling word that he  <br/>
&gt; writes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 10 AM  Emily is grousing again.  I know she&#39;s not ready  to get up, so <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; decide to wait a couple of minutes and see whether she&#39;ll go  back to <br/>
&gt; sleep.<br/>
&gt; This drives Ben crazy.  “Mom,” he keeps saying, “the baby  is crying!” <br/>
&gt;  I<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; out his Phonics Pathways and tell him to think about  his phonics <br/>
&gt; instead.<br/>
&gt; He’s reading me two pages a day, as a review of phonics  and spelling <br/>
&gt; rules.<br/>
&gt; He reads the first two lines and then stops. &quot;Mom,&quot; he  says <br/>
&gt; seriously, &quot;are<br/>
&gt; you sure you know how to take care of a  baby?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 10:10  Emily stops crying thirty seconds before I&#39;m ready to  go get <br/>
&gt; her.<br/>
&gt; When I look in at her, she’s sound asleep.  I check  Christopher’s <br/>
&gt; grammar<br/>
&gt; and give him his spelling book.  Today he’s doing  the second half of a<br/>
&gt; lesson, so I don’t have to explain anything.  I  start a pot of <br/>
&gt; coffee, sit<br/>
&gt; Ben in front of his penmanship, and go to check on  Daniel.  He’s <br/>
&gt; covered<br/>
&gt; with chocolate, (so is his sheet) but he’s happy,  so I don’t wipe him <br/>
&gt; off.<br/>
&gt; (I ignore the sheet, on the theory that it&#39;s been  hit with worse.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 10:30  We take a snack and coffee outside for the  men working on the <br/>
&gt; sawmill<br/>
&gt; (I take the baby monitor with me.)   Christopher and Ben go off to <br/>
&gt; play.  In<br/>
&gt; five minutes they reappear with  Ben weeping.  “Christopher says he <br/>
&gt; has to<br/>
&gt; clean the bunny cage before he  can play with me!”  Ben wails.  <br/>
&gt; “Christopher,<br/>
&gt; play with Ben  first.”  “But he wants to play that we’re sweet kittens<br/>
&gt; playing in the  woods,” Christopher says.  “Why can’t you play sweet<br/>
&gt; kittens?” I  ask.  “Because it’s stupid,” he says, “and I want to <br/>
&gt; pretend<br/>
&gt; that we’re  raptors.”  “Go play kittens for ten minutes,” I say, “and <br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; clean the  bunny cage.”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 11 AM  Break is over.  I collect Daniel, who has  been in the sawdust <br/>
&gt; pile<br/>
&gt; and now has sawdust sticking to the chocolate on his  face.  When I <br/>
&gt; call<br/>
&gt; Christopher inside, he says, “But I have to clean the  bunny cage.”  <br/>
&gt; “What<br/>
&gt; have you been doing all this time?” I ask.   “Playing sweet kittens,” <br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; says.  Ben adds, “Sweet kittens being hunted  by raptors.”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 11:05  Christopher is upset because I told him not to  check on the <br/>
&gt; bunny<br/>
&gt; until lunch time (“If you don’t do it when I tell you to,  you’ll have <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; wait until your next break”) and he is now convinced that the  bunny <br/>
&gt; is dying<br/>
&gt; of thirst.  Emily is awake and crying.  I sit down  to feed Emily <br/>
&gt; again and<br/>
&gt; read Daniel another book while Ben plays with  Legos.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 11:30  Emily is happy, so I put everyone on the sofa and  start <br/>
&gt; history.<br/>
&gt; Today we’re working on our Presidents Memorization Project –  we color<br/>
&gt; pictures of two presidents from the Bellerophon coloring book,  <br/>
&gt; Christopher<br/>
&gt; looks them up in the encyclopedia and writes down two interesting  <br/>
&gt; facts<br/>
&gt; about each president, and we all chant the presidents in order.   <br/>
&gt; We’re up to<br/>
&gt; Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren.  I tell Christopher and  Ben to <br/>
&gt; STOP<br/>
&gt; TALKING UNTIL THEIR PICTURES ARE COLORED.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 12:00  I  fix lunch one-handed and call everyone to the table.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 12:30  I tell  Christopher and Ben to STOP TALKING UNTIL THEIR FOOD IS <br/>
&gt; ALL<br/>
&gt; GONE because they  still have work to do before rest time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 12:45.  I put Emily in her  cradle and clear away lunch half-eaten.  <br/>
&gt; Ben<br/>
&gt; bursts into tears because  he isn’t finished.  Christopher asks for <br/>
&gt; dessert.<br/>
&gt; I tell Ben to sit on  his bed, Christopher that he can’t have any <br/>
&gt; dessert,<br/>
&gt; and Daniel to go  potty.  Emily is screaming.  “Emily is screaming!” <br/>
&gt; Ben<br/>
&gt; yells from  his bed.  “Do I have to do my Writing Strands?” <br/>
&gt; Christopher asks.<br/>
&gt; “My  pants are a little bit wet,” Daniel shouts from the bathroom.  I <br/>
&gt; yell<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; the top of my lungs, “Everybody be quiet before I lose my mind!”   <br/>
&gt; There is a<br/>
&gt; short silence.  Daniel says politely, from the bathroom, “You  don’t <br/>
&gt; have to<br/>
&gt; be so loud, Mommy.”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 12:50  Daniel has dry pants,  Ben is copying three exclamations from <br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; English for the Thoughtful Child  Book, and I’m explaining <br/>
&gt; Christopher’s<br/>
&gt; Writing Strands exercise to him.   He takes it off to do it in his <br/>
&gt; room.  I<br/>
&gt; correct Ben’s penmanship and  send him and Daniel to bed for mandatory <br/>
&gt; rest<br/>
&gt; time.  Daniel is listening  to “How to Eat Fried Worms” on his tape <br/>
&gt; recorder;<br/>
&gt; Ben is listening to “The  Dark Is Rising” and playing with Legos.<br/>
&gt; Christopher brings me his writing  exercise.  I tell him to save his <br/>
&gt; piano<br/>
&gt; lesson until after rest  time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1 PM.  I leave the baby monitor with my mother (her house is  attached <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; ours) and go for a walk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2 PM. I get back from my walk and  answer a couple of e-mails before <br/>
&gt; Emily<br/>
&gt; wakes up and wants to be  fed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3 PM.  The boys get up.  I’ve learned not to try to leap  directly into<br/>
&gt; school after nap time; I let them eat cookies and play for a  little <br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; until they start to bicker.  “School time!” I say, and send  <br/>
&gt; Christopher to<br/>
&gt; play his piano.  I give Daniel scissors and colored  paper, and he <br/>
&gt; promptly<br/>
&gt; begins to make a phenomenal mess all over the kitchen  floor.  Ben <br/>
&gt; reads to<br/>
&gt; me from his current “Extra Reading” book – a book  that goes along with<br/>
&gt; history or science (Peter does their imaginative reading  with them on<br/>
&gt; Tuesdays and Thursdays). Today he’s reading Can’t You Make Them  <br/>
&gt; Behave, King<br/>
&gt; George?  I sit down to listen, but Emily cries, so I get up  and walk <br/>
&gt; around<br/>
&gt; the kitchen while Ben reads.  Halfway through the first  page, Emily <br/>
&gt; dirties<br/>
&gt; her diaper, my shirt, her blanket, and her sleeper.   Ben follows me <br/>
&gt; into our<br/>
&gt; bedroom, still reading, while Christopher bangs out  “The Bells” for <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; fourth time, Daniel sings along, I change the diaper, and  Emily <br/>
&gt; screams.<br/>
&gt; The noise level has once again reached airport level.  I  say, in an<br/>
&gt; unnaturally calm voice, “Ben, could you please stop reading to me  <br/>
&gt; until I’m<br/>
&gt; finished with Emily’s diaper?”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3:30.  Emily doesn’t  want to be put down.  I had intended to do <br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; Latin lesson with  Christopher today, but I’m starting to feel like <br/>
&gt; I’ve HAD<br/>
&gt; it, so I tell him  to review his vocabulary cards and then send all of <br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; outside to run  around while I start supper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3:45  I give up on supper and rock  Emily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4 PM  I’m still rocking Emily.  The boys come back  in.  “Go outside <br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; more,” I say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4:15  I nurse Emily  again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4:30 Still rocking Emily.  The boys come in again.  I  tell <br/>
&gt; Christopher to<br/>
&gt; read Daniel a book and Ben to get his penmanship book  out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4:45  Emily is asleep.  I threaten everyone with instant  death if <br/>
&gt; they wake<br/>
&gt; her up.  They think this is funny and start to howl  with laughter at <br/>
&gt; the top<br/>
&gt; of their lungs.  Emily cries.  I go in the  bathroom, shut the door, <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; count to twenty.  Daniel sticks his fingers  under the door and says, <br/>
&gt; “Look,<br/>
&gt; Daniel fingers!”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5 PM.  I decide  that we should all walk down to the mailbox instead of<br/>
&gt; trying to do  science.  I give Mom the monitor again, and we borrow <br/>
&gt; three<br/>
&gt; flashlights  from her (it’s already dark, and I have no batteries.  <br/>
&gt; Ever.)<br/>
&gt; The  mailbox is a quarter of a mile away, and the night is beautiful.  <br/>
&gt; By  the<br/>
&gt; time we get back I feel better.  I fix everybody sandwiches and  <br/>
&gt; potato chips<br/>
&gt; for supper.  (They think this is great).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5:50   I tell Christopher and Benjamin to STOP TALKING AND EAT or I <br/>
&gt; will take<br/>
&gt; their  potato chips away.  They cram all the chips into their mouths.  <br/>
&gt;  I<br/>
&gt; decide that we will save manners lessons until Emily is older.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 6  PM.  Emily wakes up.  I get out the Science in a Nutshell kit that  <br/>
&gt; we’re<br/>
&gt; doing (Gears) and give everyone gears, then sit down and nurse Emily  <br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; we go through the project.  Christopher loves to keep his Science  <br/>
&gt; Journal,<br/>
&gt; but Ben has to be prompted for every question and answer.  I’m  still <br/>
&gt; writing<br/>
&gt; them down for him, since his penmanship is very slow and  difficult; <br/>
&gt; today my<br/>
&gt; hands are full, so I tell him he gets the day off from  recording his<br/>
&gt; experiments.  Daniel puts gear stickers on his head and  says, “Look, <br/>
&gt; I’m a<br/>
&gt; gear machine.”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 7 PM  I tell Ben that we’re not  doing Spanish (again).  “We never get <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; Spanish,” he says.  This  is unfortunately true.  Maybe I’ll outsource <br/>
&gt; it to<br/>
&gt; a neighbor next  year.  I check the lists; Christopher didn’t do his <br/>
&gt; cursive<br/>
&gt; practice,  but I decide that his life will be complete without it.  I <br/>
&gt; tell<br/>
&gt; the boys  to get their pajamas on and clean up their room while I rock <br/>
&gt; Emily,<br/>
&gt; who is  screaming (again).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 7:15  Emily gets happy and everyone wants to hold  her.  We take turns <br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; I read to Daniel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 7:30  Daniel  goes to bed.  I play Uno with Christopher and Ben while <br/>
&gt; Emily<br/>
&gt; sits on my  lap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8 PM.  I read Ben a book and put him in bed.  I rock Emily  back to <br/>
&gt; sleep<br/>
&gt; while Christopher sits on the sofa and reads.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8:30   I send Christopher to bed and put Emily in her cradle.  She<br/>
&gt; immediately  wakes up and howls.  Eventually I pick her up and pretend <br/>
&gt; I’m<br/>
&gt; doing  aerobics, which sends back to sleep.  I put her back down and <br/>
&gt; sneak<br/>
&gt; out  of the room.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9 PM  Boy, it would be nice to go to  bed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:30  Lights out for the boys.  Daniel is asleep; I pray  with the two <br/>
&gt; older<br/>
&gt; boys, listen to Christopher’s worries, and answer twelve  questions <br/>
&gt; from Ben.<br/>
&gt; I know Emily will be up to eat again soon, so I decide to  work on <br/>
&gt; e-mail<br/>
&gt; again until she wakes up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AND A FINAL NOTE TO THIS  PAGE, added June, 2001:  WE DID HAVE A GOOD <br/>
&gt; TIME<br/>
&gt; THIS DAY!  We  played Uno, messed around with gears, went for a great <br/>
&gt; walk in<br/>
&gt; the dark, dug  in the sawdust and read three books that kept the boys<br/>
&gt; enthralled.  It  was ALSO frantic and tiring; that&#39;s real life with <br/>
&gt; four<br/>
&gt; children under  nine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504575728">I agree with everyone....It made me sick to my stomach.  I was just sitting<br/>
with my cup of coffee this morning thinking that my patience level with my<br/>
girls (9 &12) has been really short lately.  I have had a lot going on in my<br/>
life and unfortunately I have let it spill into &quot;our lives&quot;.  I was telling<br/>
myself, before I read this horrific article, that I need to get a grip and<br/>
love on my girls today.  So, even though I too couldn&#39;t get through the<br/>
entire second story, thank you, because it put in my face to remember not to<br/>
lose another day......<br/>
<br/>
Off to enjoy the day...............<br/>
