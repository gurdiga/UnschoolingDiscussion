<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593186396">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the info on homeschooling and politics, this will be our<br/>
discussion topic in Oct. at our meeting.<br/>
<br/>
I was sewing and designing Barbie clothes when I was ten.  I used a old<br/>
treddle machine, no electric power all,<br/>
foot control.  My son has been sewing with me for a while using the<br/>
electic machine.  Mostly he just pushes the<br/>
peddle and pretends he&#39;s driving a car.  He has also sewn a little bag<br/>
for himself.  He&#39;s now 6, he probably sewed<br/>
that bag when he was 4 with my hands guiding with the fabric through the<br/>
machine.  He&#39;ll be helping with<br/>
Christmas presents this year.<br/>
<br/>
