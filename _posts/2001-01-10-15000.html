This is a link to the complete college of early childhood education. I am taking this course for<br/>
my own personal needs not for credit through any orginization which is why these courses are<br/>
perfect up for people like me who have no need of a degree. They have many other courses there<br/>
covering a lot of subjects.<br/>

&gt; Constructivism ( go to www.free-ed.com colledge of early childhood<br/>
&gt; education and look up methods of learning but basically it means to build<br/>
&gt; on what you already know!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another unschooling theory is Brain Based Learning You can take a course<br/>
&gt; on that at<br/>
&gt; www.free-ed.com also.<br/>
