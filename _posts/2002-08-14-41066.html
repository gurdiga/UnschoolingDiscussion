<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394562639">2 years ago my kids went back to PS (it lasted about 30 days) The local<br/>
school district had just started enforcing uniforms.  We spent $1000 on<br/>
uniforms, book rental, and school supplies (from a required list).  This was<br/>
just for 2 kids! If my kids had decided to stay in PS I would have had to<br/>
buy new uniforms about 2 times a year.  (hot/cold weather & growing out of<br/>
their clothes)<br/>
So, our average cost for sending 2 children to PS for one year would have<br/>
been $1500-$2000.<br/>
This of course does not include, school lunches, field trip costs, music<br/>
instruments, etc.  Those costs are understandable and minimal for the most<br/>
part, so I am not complaining about that.  However I did complain about the<br/>
PTO sending home a letter stating that our children had made wonderful<br/>
little art creations and IF we wished to see them we must buy them from the<br/>
PTO! (so lemme gets this straight?!?! you are selling ME my child&#39;s artwork,<br/>
which I supplied the markers, paper, etc to make?!?!)  No thanks!<br/>
<br/>
OK, I am sorry for the school rant.  How does this pertain to unschooling?<br/>
Well....hmmm...I am now able to spend the same money on FUN things for the<br/>
kids, things they really want, and they get to wear what they want.<br/>

&gt;On the news last night they did a report on the expense of &quot;back to<br/>
&gt;school&quot; items.  Clothing and supplies ran an average of $250 per<br/>
&gt;child.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s absurd.  One thing I never did when I had kids in school was to buy<br/>
a whole pile of new clothes at the start of the year.  One new outfit . . .<br/>
maybe.  They grow, for Pete&#39;s sake.  When they needed new clothes is when<br/>
they got them.  Well, maybe not new before their teens, but new to them.<br/>

money.  LOL!<br/>
