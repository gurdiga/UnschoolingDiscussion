<div id="ygrps-yiv-112271554">Unfortunately in third world countries, the mothers often CANNOT lactate for<br/>
the POOR diet that they suffer from. So, even when nursing, they are<br/>
starving their babies.<br/>
<br/>
As I said in a private post to Kim, I feel great that I will be even<br/>
expressing milk for the next baby! That is a big YES! My dh will be able to<br/>
relish in those precious bonding moments where he can feed baby too.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that since this is  a hot topic, that I will go back into a lurk<br/>
mode. It is every person&#39;s choice to breast/bottle feed, and I think that<br/>
since I would have died if I continued nursing 2 times (I was hemorrhaging<br/>
to death), I have a right to NOT nurse in that fear alone. I know that<br/>
BREAST MILK is very important for a baby, but since my dd was so ill and<br/>
ended up on Nutramigen, I question if I would have been able to nurse her at<br/>
all. The ex kept it from being an option, but I do wonder...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for you opinions, for they do show how determined you all are<br/>
about your feelings. This is truly a good example of how we are all<br/>
unschoolers, we are all different.<br/>
