 So there&#39;s a bit of background for my intro.  I hope to share many of the <br/>
interesting stories and insights I have gathered over the past year on the <br/>
various topics of &quot;radical&quot; unschooling as I try to contribute more in the <br/>
discussions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Pam L.! Even though you&#39;ve been here a while.<br/>
I enjoyed your intro. I&#39;m always envious of those that seemed to &quot;get&quot; a lot <br/>
of the unschooling ideas right away...my journey was a bit more bumpy.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
