&gt; What is the Tao of Unschooling until college?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter is also 14 and has always said she wants to go to college. Since<br/>
this is her goal, I just do what we&#39;ve always done - find out what&#39;s needed,<br/>
examine various resources, etc. It&#39;s still all up to her. For instance,<br/>
about a year ago, I began a discussion with her about studying a language.<br/>
What I said was: here&#39;s some options: you can do the required 2-4 yrs of<br/>
language in some way or you can forget about it and find colleges that don&#39;t<br/>
care. Zoe: I want to learn a language. Me: OK, any that strike you as<br/>
interesting? Spanish is practical. Zoe: Not Spanish, that&#39;s so ordinary<br/>
(History repeats itself: that&#39;s how I ended up studying Russian in HS &lt;gg&gt;).<br/>
Me: It seems to me that the best way to really be able to learn to speak a<br/>
new language is to be around someone who really speaks it. Zoe: my good<br/>
friend Hannah and her whole family speak German. It would be fun to learn<br/>
with them. Me: Cool.<br/>
<br/>
That was a year ago. Since then, she bought herself a dictionary and a<br/>
workbook. She did some work in the workbook right away and then none at all.<br/>
Hannah&#39;s family brought her some German kid&#39;s books. She hears them speak<br/>
German a lot. She&#39;s learned some vocabulary. That&#39;s it. Maybe she&#39;ll do more<br/>
as time passes. Maybe she&#39;ll bag it and find colleges that don&#39;t care. Maybe<br/>
she&#39;ll bag the idea of college and it will be moot. All reasonable choices.<br/>
<br/>
And remember, not everyone goes to college at 18. And not everyone goes into<br/>
a regular 4 yr program. There&#39;s options galore!<br/>
