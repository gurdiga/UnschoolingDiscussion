<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650170639">A great problem to have.  Passionate involvement in something you love is a<br/>
wonderful gift.  I sadly would be scared half to death.  My youngest<br/>
daughter (almost 7) is in a group called Cirkids and she like trapezeey<br/>
sorts of things.  I can watch with a smile which if I sit far enough away<br/>
she can&#39;t tell is frozen.  I work on my terror problem but it is a<br/>
challenge.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I am still having trouble diving completely into unschooling as my<br/>
&gt; youngest son is<br/>
&gt; obsessive about his sport of choice (surfing). If I didn&#39;t give him a<br/>
&gt; framework to work within, he would only come in for food and sleep. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521873382">Psst, Joel, for a small fee I won&#39;t tell her that Cirques du Soliel is now<br/>
on videos which can be had at your friendly neighborhood stores such as<br/>
Costco &lt;g&gt;  Or that they have schools in Canada and Florida for kidlets &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now, then you would have to do more than paste on a smile!<br/>
