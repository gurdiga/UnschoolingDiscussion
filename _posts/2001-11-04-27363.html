<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889432990">hello i rarely say much around here.. but i very much enjoy reading everyones ideas and life stories!! but today i want to say something.. we had friends over who had a little boy and he wanted to play with the doll house they would not let him.. kept telling him it was a girl thing.. the child was upset way too much.. we personally would have let him.. we believe a boy can learn much playing with a doll house..  anyways on to my middle boy.. when he was small he loved to dance like a ballarina.. and his favorite color was pink... pink toys.. bottles blankies.. i swear i had nothing to do with it .. i have kept his pink elephant and pink teddy bear for years now though.. believe me he is not a fairy.. he is all boy just very very artistic, acting.. he makes videos and impersonates people all the time.. i need not worry that he loved pink and danced like a ballarina when he ws 2.. i have also seen my boys take dolls and hang them from the stairs.. etc... sometimes it is too funny.. i personally do not think we have to worry!! just my 2 cents..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-381424672">My little sister (credit where credit is due) said<br/>
&quot;Well, if he can pretend to be a kitty or a dog or a<br/>
bear, why can&#39;t he pretend to be a girl?&quot; Refering to<br/>
our nephew (4yo at the time) who preferred to wear<br/>
dresses. Sometimes he was Zorro, or others, of any<br/>
gender, or species,(G) too. He could also read,<br/>
already.<br/>

not &quot;all boy&quot;  whatever that means. No one freaks if little girls play<br/>
ball and climb trees.  <br/>
