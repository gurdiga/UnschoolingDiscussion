  I am not there yet, but a friend of mine is.  She is putting together a portfolio and narrative of what her ds did.  He was involved in a Philosophy group that I facilitated and I wrote a teacher evaluation letter that I had to mail directly to the college he was applying to.  It all works out and the colleges accept other shows of knowledge not just transcripts.<br/>
   <br/>
  My ds who is 16 has now been taking Japanese for the past year at our Japan/America Society.  His whole reason for wanting to learn Japanese is so that he can get all the good video games years earlier than we get them here.<br/>
