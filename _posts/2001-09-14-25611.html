that has ruled this country since around 1870, and set up a school system so<br/>
that they could off-load their training needs, and their need to ensure a<br/>

<br/>
This vision of the origins of the school system might be somewhat true in the <br/>
industrial northeast, but they are NOT &quot;truth&quot; for the whole U.S. or for all <br/>
early schools.<br/>
<br/>
The local school boards and one-room school houses in Texas and the Southwest <br/>
(those I&#39;m most familiar with from family accounts and from reading about <br/>
local history, and from familiarity with the state college systems in <br/>
neighboring states) were grassroots, local-moving-toward territorial- or <br/>
statewide schools.  Locals decided to build a school--not with tax money, but <br/>
with logs or adobe or whatever.  They built it and someone taught.  Often <br/>
local, younger women.  Partly for room and board, sometimes.  Those who <br/>
wanted to teach went to the state&#39;s &quot;normal school&quot; for teacher training and <br/>
certification.<br/>
<br/>
They wanted to teach people to read and know about the world outside the area <br/>
they lived in.  They weren&#39;t training factory workers nor any other kinds of <br/>
slaves.  They were teaching people about the U.S. because they either were <br/>
newly made citizens or were hoping to become a state.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sorry John Taylor Gatto and others are exposing the underbelly of <br/>
some of the early writings in their area, but the story of the influx of <br/>
European immigrants to the urban Northeast during the industrial heyday is <br/>
not the same as the history of public education in the United States of <br/>
America.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra -- absolutely true.  And indeed, my comments are specifically about the<br/>
industrial school systems set up in the U.S. after 1870, and especially after the<br/>
establishment of graduate schools of education at U.Chicago, Columbia,<br/>
Carnegie-Mellon, and Harvard by Rockefeller, Morgan, and Carnegie.<br/>
<br/>
But I also don&#39;t think you can deny that this system of education has overwhelmed<br/>
the community-based, community-run, community subscribed, often one-room<br/>
schoolhouse that existed in the northeast prior to 1860, and in the rest of the<br/>
country to much later.<br/>
<br/>
I live out here in the west, and I&#39;d be hard-pressed to see any sign of these<br/>
earlier systems out here where I live other than bake sales.<br/>
<br/>
Call it the victory of the socialism of the rich, if you will.<br/>
