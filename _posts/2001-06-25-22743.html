<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015081293">Well, big brother has finally spilled the beans.  As someone else said,<br/>
&quot;This is about the only way anymore to actually get real news or real<br/>
information; the accidental slip of tongue while live and before the censors<br/>
re-package it or pull it off the shelf entirely.&quot;  The emphasis on &quot;capture&quot;<br/>
is mine.<br/>

&gt; It has finally been &#39;voiced&#39;. I think we all know this however<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t voiced it or if we have we have been &#39;put down&#39; about it.<br/>
&gt; But now here it is spoken by a representative of the people who<br/>
&gt; &#39;manipulated&#39; the election results.<br/>

&gt;   Subject: Colin Powell leaks real reason for SSN:<br/>
&gt;  monitor/track/capture Americans<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Fox News Sunday this morning, 06/17/01,<br/>
&gt;   being hosted in the first segment by Tony Snow. The<br/>
&gt;   lead off guest was Colin Powell, the US Secretary of<br/>
&gt;   State. Mr. Powell gave an excellent recitation<br/>
&gt;   relevant to foreign affair matters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Mr. Powell was discussing Mr. Bush&#39;s trip to Europe,<br/>
&gt;   and was at a point in his recitation covering certain<br/>
&gt;   concerns regarding Russia, and Russia being requested<br/>
&gt;   to cooperate with the United States too track down<br/>
&gt;   lost Nuclear materials and scientists who were<br/>
&gt;   unaccounted for after the break up of Russia, that now<br/>
&gt;   may be in the hands of, or in the case of the missing<br/>
&gt;   scientists, working for adversaries of the USA.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   [Colin Powell] - &quot;Finding the Russian scientists may<br/>
&gt;   be a problem being that Russia does not have a Social<br/>
&gt;   Security System, as here in America, that allows us to<br/>
&gt;   monitor, track down and *capture* an American citizen.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   When he realized the consequences of making<br/>
&gt;   this disclosure indirectly to the American public, he<br/>
&gt;   froze for a second, his eyes rolled back as he<br/>
&gt;   realized what he had said, and then he continued<br/>
&gt;   without further pause for the rest of the interview. </span></blockquote></div>
