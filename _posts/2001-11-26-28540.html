<div id="ygrps-yiv-115660471">I have been out of town for the holidays and am currently wading through<br/>
many, many digests so I know this is coming late, but I am so sick of<br/>
reading about this that I am going to respond   :)<br/>
<br/>
Let me preface by saying that I come from a racially and culturally mixed<br/>
family so I tend to be fairly sensitive racially motivated stuff.  However,<br/>
I have little experience with Middle Eastern cultures and may be missing<br/>
some big picture.   If so, could someone fill me in please.<br/>
<br/>
In the sentence preceding the now infamous &quot;rest of the Arab world&quot;<br/>
statement, Sandra eluded to people attempting to peacemake between herself<br/>
and Lynda, kind of like countries often do in the Middle East and some<br/>
people in that area tend to like to sabotage those attempts.  That is where<br/>
I got the tie in there.  Perhaps if I somehow knew that Lynda was of Middle<br/>
Eastern descent (Is she?), I might have read that different.<br/>

fascinated by it on a purely linguistic basis.<br/>

writing a post at the time that the author, quite emotionally, left the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186789232">Let&#39;s stick to the facts.  I posted it again (#27847, 11/17) and it was not<br/>
about bullying the resident bully.  Then it appeared again when freeform<br/>
jumped (#27939, 11/18) in with some inaccurate &quot;cruddy&quot; information.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t until 11/21 (#29233) that Tery said anything.<br/>
<br/>
If you actually went to the archieves you would know that there were an<br/>
additional 13 posts between 11/21 and 11/27.<br/>
<br/>
You incorrected &gt;snipped&lt; a post and by editing it the way you did, you have<br/>
created a whole new meaning. The poster is correct, you are wrong.  Why are<br/>
you jumping on her anyway?  She most respectfully said she didn&#39;t think it<br/>
was correct to discuss something when one of the parties wasn&#39;t here which<br/>
could be construed as a defense of that person you are jumping in to defend?<br/>
Your gripe is with me, so why not stick to carping at the person you are<br/>
peeved at!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, opinions are like certain parts of the anatomy, everyone has one.  And<br/>
no matter how many times it is repeated, won&#39;t change it from an opinion to<br/>
a fact.<br/>

&gt; It was not still being discussed when you came on last week.  Someone who<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t post much brought it up just before she left - which was just<br/>
&gt; before you arrived.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No one said much about it in Sept.  When Teri left last week, she brought<br/>
&gt; it up.  No one said anything about it all of Oct. or the first part of<br/>
&gt; Nov.  I had to search the archives to find the original message.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IMO it was just another bullying of Sandra moment.<br/>

going to be the adult here [snip]&#39; I forgot who posted it and find it <br/>
unnecessary to take the time to look it up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d post more but the kid is finally away from his TV stint and I need to <br/>
capture this time for him.<br/>
