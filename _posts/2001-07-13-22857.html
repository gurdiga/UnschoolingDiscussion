<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104691104">Hey, I have a question about homeschooling. My mom doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
college degree, but we really want for me to be homeschooled, and <br/>
since I&#39;ll be in 9th grade, the TN law states that she must have a <br/>
BA/BS degree. So, if I do it the church-related way and do it through <br/>
an academy, do I have to attend the academy/church? Because if I do <br/>
then I can&#39;t do it. For this one academy, Family Christian Academy, <br/>
it says that if we &quot;join&quot; them that she doesn&#39;t have to have a <br/>
degree, so that&#39;s why we thought that was the only way. The only <br/>
problems with homeschooling we&#39;ve run into so far are expenses and <br/>
her not having a BA/BS degree. If you could help it would mean so <br/>
much. Thank you, good-bye!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112729575">Your mom should be able to unschool/homeschool you via an umbrella school. <br/>
There are several that do it through the mail. Check your Tennessee laws and <br/>
check with HSLA (I think) about getting help if you need it.<br/>

<br/>
We are unschoolers in Florida.  I think it is great you are doing this <br/>
research for yourself.  Unschooling at its best!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know nothing about Tenn law but just browsed over to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tnhomeed.com/CRSChart.htm">http://www.tnhomeed.com/CRSChart.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
and there seem to be a few options of cover schools you could sign up with <br/>
that don&#39;t require the SOF and/or operate under the Jeter decision -- <br/>
apparently, this is what you want.<br/>
<br/>
I got to this from:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Also, you may find some helpful info at www.nhen.org (the server is down now <br/>
though).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972520705">I live in Tennessee and my teenage daughter is homeschooled. We have <br/>
found Gateway to be the least restrictive umbrella school. The <br/>
website is www.gatewaychristianschools.com I understand your concern <br/>
with the need to be afilliated with a church if you ar not a <br/>
believer, but I think it has something to do with the way the law is <br/>
written in Tennessee. In the beginning of homeschooling, the majority <br/>
of people were doing it under a Christian exemption. the tennhomeed <br/>
site is also a wealt of information. There is also a group alled <br/>
