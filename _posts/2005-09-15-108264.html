<div id="ygrps-yiv-316053025">I kind of get the concept of facilitator vs. teacher, and I so want <br/>
to get it right, but my kids aren&#39;t even 3 yet (one will be in a <br/>
month, the other just turned one) and I don&#39;t know how to BEGIN, even <br/>
though I know in a way we&#39;ve been doing it since they were born!<br/>
<br/>
But I want to know if I should be doing things like repeating the <br/>
alphabet to her? I know she could recognize the letters if I did, but <br/>
I was waiting to see if, like in Holt&#39;s books, she just goes straight <br/>
to reading someday. But that might be awhile and I feel like an idiot <br/>
telling people I&#39;m homeschooling (they haven&#39;t ever heard the term <br/>
UNschooling) and then my 3 year old can&#39;t say the alphabet, and <br/>
everyone else&#39;s can...<br/>
<br/>
Do I get certain counting bars so she can play with them, or just <br/>
wait until she asks how many of something there is? Do I correct her <br/>
when she miscounts as toddlers will (by just repeating the order <br/>
correctly, not meanly or implying she&#39;s wrong) or do I correct her <br/>
when she makes up the words on a page and point to the right word and <br/>
tell her what it is? Or is this too much teaching?<br/>
<br/>
I know I probabaly sound over-anxious, I tend to be. But if you can <br/>
tell me how you all work with you littlest ones...<br/>
<br/>
One thing that really intimidated me was in the book Teach Your Own, <br/>
the author (not Holt, the newer guy) mentioned that their youngest <br/>
could count by 2&#39;s forever and by 5&#39;s to 100 by the time she went to <br/>
kindergarten (by her insistence until she got bored.) I <br/>
thought, &quot;Man, should I be doing something different?&quot; I just don&#39;t <br/>
see how my kid will one day ask, &quot;How do you count by 2&#39;s?&quot; when they <br/>
don&#39;t even know what it is? So how does one so young learn to want to <br/>
learn specific things like that? <br/>
<br/>
The only thing I can think of is the intro to the cartoon, <br/>
Franklin...&quot;Franklin could count by 2&#39;s and tie his shoes....&quot; ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your help. I can&#39;t wait to start this journey!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797451355">The first thing you should do is sign up for the AlwaysUnschooled  <br/>
list (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/)</a> for parents of  <br/>
young unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But I want to know if I should be doing things like repeating the<br/>
&gt; alphabet to her?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not as a way to get her to learn the alphabet but because it&#39;s fun to  <br/>
sing the song, fun to be competent at things.<br/>
<br/>
Treat the song as you would any other song, as just something fun to  <br/>
sing.<br/>
<br/>
Treat recognition of the letters as you would the characters&#39; names  <br/>
in her favorite TV show. She&#39;ll learn them because she&#39;s interested  <br/>
in the show, not because she needs to know the names to like the show.<br/>
<br/>
The alphabet is part of life. It&#39;s a natural part of things that are  <br/>
interesting. She learn it as she comes across interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
Your job isn&#39;t to get her to learn but to provide access to  <br/>
interesting things. Be curious about life. Stop and look at  <br/>
interesting rocks and weeds when on walks. Try new foods. Listen to  <br/>
new music. Not as a way to get her to pay attention to &quot;important  <br/>
stuff&quot; but to be and model being curious about life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know she could recognize the letters if I did, but<br/>
&gt; I was waiting to see if, like in Holt&#39;s books, she just goes straight<br/>
&gt; to reading someday.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well yes and no. Learning to read is made up of lots of different  <br/>
parts. Kids will pick up bits and pieces of the parts as they live  <br/>
life. They&#39;ll pick up letters and pieces of words and sounds. For  <br/>
instance a child may recongize STOP and McDonald&#39;s signs before  <br/>
recognizing all the letters. That&#39;s part of learning to read. It&#39;s  <br/>
not like one day she&#39;ll be reading. My daughter, for instance, loved  <br/>
to write but it took her ages to read. Which seems totally backward  <br/>
and yet there it was :-)<br/>
<br/>
Read to her. (*If* she enjoys it!) Listen to stories and books on  <br/>
tape. Ask if she&#39;d like to add a caption to the bottom of drawings  <br/>
and write it for her. Label things around the house and after a while  <br/>
mix up the labels as a fun game. (Might be too early for this.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But that might be awhile and I feel like an idiot<br/>
&gt; telling people I&#39;m homeschooling (they haven&#39;t ever heard the term<br/>
&gt; UNschooling) and then my 3 year old can&#39;t say the alphabet, and<br/>
&gt; everyone else&#39;s can...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, not every 3 yo can. The ones who can and the ones who feel it&#39;s a  <br/>
great accomplishment won&#39;t hesitate to show you. Those who can&#39;t or  <br/>
have no interest just aren&#39;t making it known. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you were in a group of 10 women and someone asked if anyone knew  <br/>
how to make a pie crust and 3 women spoke up it might seem like  <br/>
everyone but you (and the original questioner) knew how but it&#39;s more  <br/>
likely that the other 7 don&#39;t. (And they, too, are sitting there  <br/>
thinking everyone else knows how to make pie crust. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
All mothers are just as worried as you are. Maybe more because  <br/>
they&#39;ll be sending their kids off to school where the parents are  <br/>
worried they&#39;ll &quot;fall behind&quot;. If they&#39;re showing off what little  <br/>
Sasquatch can do, it&#39;s a way of voicing their relief that it&#39;s one  <br/>
less thing they have to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
And what does a 3 yo need with the alphabet? How does the alphabet  <br/>
help a 3 yo do better 3 yo things.<br/>
<br/>
Too often we look at children as imperfect adults. Better to look at  <br/>
them as being perfect for whoever they are today.<br/>
<br/>
What did you do to help your child at 2 prepare to be 3? It sounds  <br/>
like a ridiculous question. They just lived day by day, learning what  <br/>
they needed for the moment and, day by day, became more 3 like until  <br/>
one day, tada, they&#39;re 3.<br/>
<br/>
Same with kids becoming adults. They do it one day at a time by just  <br/>
being the age they are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do I get certain counting bars so she can play with them, or just<br/>
&gt; wait until she asks how many of something there is?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Counting existed before counter bears were invented ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Unless she happens to see counting bears and thinks they&#39;re the most  <br/>
adorable thing invented, don&#39;t bother. Count real things with her --  <br/>
things that are hers -- just because it&#39;s cool to know how many.  <br/>
Think of it perhaps less as memorizing what order the numbers come in  <br/>
and more as comparison. When you&#39;re folding you can say &quot;Look you  <br/>
have 3 red shirts and 2 blue ones.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most kids love to sort. Sort real things like rocks and leaves and  <br/>
acorns and toy collections. Anything she&#39;s fascinated with. (And  <br/>
don&#39;t worry if she&#39;s not fascinated now. There&#39;s no rush. She *will*  <br/>
count before she&#39;s 18!) Talk about her toys. Have conversations as  <br/>
you might with a friend. Ask her questions. How many red cars do you  <br/>
have? Where did you get this one? Which cars are boys and which are  <br/>
girls? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do I correct her<br/>
&gt; when she miscounts as toddlers will (by just repeating the order<br/>
&gt; correctly, not meanly or implying she&#39;s wrong)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends but generally I&#39;d say no. It will self correct without  <br/>
intervention because she&#39;s going to naturally hear the right way a  <br/>
lot more than the wrong way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or do I correct her<br/>
&gt; when she makes up the words on a page and point to the right word and<br/>
&gt; tell her what it is? Or is this too much teaching?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again this will self correct. Think in terms of the experience being  <br/>
pleasant for her rather than worrying that she&#39;ll never get it.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard with the first because it seems like there are so many  <br/>
pitfalls and stumbling blocks that kids can never get over or around.  <br/>
Once you&#39;ve seen them learn things that it takes  naturally you  <br/>
realize there was nothing to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; see how my kid will one day ask, &quot;How do you count by 2&#39;s?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kathryn rarely skip counted and yet she learned how to count and do  <br/>
arithmetic naturally :-)<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re sorting pennies to roll you can count by 2s and 3s. You  <br/>
can put them in stacks of five and then count. Count nickels. There  <br/>
are naturally occurring in life opportunities to skip count. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So how does one so young learn to want to<br/>
&gt; learn specific things like that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By encountering it and thinking it&#39;s interesting. Often they&#39;ll run  <br/>
across things quite a few times before it registers. But if their  <br/>
experiences are always pleasant -- eg, no pressure to learn, no worry  <br/>
that they won&#39;t pay attention -- there&#39;s no reason for kids to avoid  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The only thing I can think of is the intro to the cartoon,<br/>
&gt; Franklin...&quot;Franklin could count by 2&#39;s and tie his shoes....&quot; ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some kids will ask &quot;What&#39;s count by 2&#39;s.&quot; Some won&#39;t. (Probably most  <br/>
won&#39;t.) You *can* but you don&#39;t need to ask &quot;Have you ever counted by  <br/>
2&#39;s like Franklin can? 2, 4, 6, 8 ...&quot; If she&#39;s interested you can  <br/>
say &quot;People can count by 3&#39;s too: 3, 6, 9, 12 ...&quot; (Though she&#39;s  <br/>
probably too young. Skip counting increases the numbers pretty  <br/>
quickly and if she hasn&#39;t yet had enough experience with larger  <br/>
numbers, it&#39;s not going to mean much. If you push she&#39;ll draw away  <br/>
and associate the pushing and the icky feeling with the skip counting.)<br/>
<br/>
(A lot of this stuff comes up on Sesame Street too. But it&#39;s not  <br/>
necessary. Kathryn rarely watched and she&#39;s a perfectly fine 14 yo. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407860421">Joyce pretty much summed it all up but I&#39;m going to chime in <br/>
anyhow ;-) My DS has never been schooled at all (he&#39;s 7 now). Here <br/>
are some snippets of how things happened at our house:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;skip&#39; counting AND alphabet both happened as games we&#39;d play in the <br/>
car or while he was sitting on the toilet (pretty boring place to be <br/>
when you can&#39;t read) - we&#39;d say the letters or numbers back and <br/>
forth so he&#39;d say 1 then I&#39;d do 2 he&#39;d do 3...or he&#39;d do a, I&#39;d have <br/>
b, he&#39;d do c and so on. As he got older, he might decide we&#39;d do the <br/>
alphabet -backwards- (which is a challenge even for us grown ups <br/>
sometimes) or we&#39;d do random things like he&#39;d say a,b,c then I&#39;d say <br/>
d,e, and he&#39;d say f and I&#39;d say g,h, and so on - both of us had to <br/>
keep track of where we were because it wasn&#39;t necessarily going to <br/>
be just the next letter. We&#39;d play games and (us adults would) total <br/>
scores by counting in 2s, or 3s, or 5s, or 10s - we&#39;d verbalize it <br/>
instead of counting silently. He&#39;d amuse himself in the car by just <br/>
sitting there counting (lately it&#39;s been hundreds and thousands). <br/>
One day (within the last year or so) I realized he was counting the <br/>
money he had in Shrek Monopoly Jr by 2s and then when he got to the <br/>
$3 bills he paused added $3 to whatever he was at then went by 3s <br/>
from there. He loved the alphabet song as a tot - we had a poster <br/>
with animals as each letter and we&#39;d sit and look at that and sing <br/>
the song, eventually it even &#39;worked&#39; as a lullaby when he was <br/>
feeling fussy.<br/>
<br/>
Reading: as Joyce mentioned, DS knew Stop and McDonald&#39;s and Burger <br/>
King and Friendly&#39;s and Sears and Exit, all the common stuff, early <br/>
on (3 or 4 yrs old) by pattern recognition. And, we read a lot <br/>
together. Sometimes we&#39;d buddy read - he&#39;d be responsible for one <br/>
word (eg. Dog) and I&#39;d read the rest (this was later 3 and into 4 <br/>
yrs old and only when he wantd to do it). Over time it expanded to a <br/>
couple words and sometimes he&#39;d read &#39;his&#39; word and keep going a <br/>
bit. Just before he was 5 he asked for a popular commercialized <br/>
product so he could learn to read. Instead (he wanted it NOW and the <br/>
product wouldn&#39;t arrive that fast so he said OK to something else), <br/>
we used the Bob books for about 3 evenings (before bed story time) - <br/>
it was just enough for him to realize that what he was doing was, in <br/>
fact, reading. Oh, a fun game we played about that time: I got <br/>
rather tired one evening of reading the Berenstain Bears Ride the <br/>
Thunderbolt for the gazillionth time. So, I started at the end and <br/>
read the whole thing backwards, siht ekil. DS thought it was <br/>
hysterical! And it made it more interesting for me because I had to <br/>
think and pay attention. In &#39;academic terms&#39;, DS could see me <br/>
tackling &#39;new&#39; words and figuring them out - modeling the process in <br/>
a real way (sounding things out usually sounds fairly fake when <br/>
adults who already know the words do it). In hindsight what I think <br/>
was going on was that DS was seeing familiar words, breaking them <br/>
down, then applying what he recognized to new words. No memorizing <br/>
rules and exceptions. More of an organic blend of phonics and whole <br/>
language.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t even bother to tell people you&#39;re homeschooling right now - at <br/>
3, she is not required to be schooled at all. If anyone asks, just a <br/>
simple &#39;we chose not to send her to preschool this year&#39; - leaves <br/>
everything else open ended. If someone really pushes you might <br/>
even &#39;name drop&#39; something like &quot;We agree with DOCTOR Raymond Moore <br/>
whose research indicated that delaying academic instruction is <br/>
beneficial&quot; (make it sound really good). <br/>
<br/>
Let her make up stories to match the pictures in her books. Odds are <br/>
at some point she&#39;ll be saying her story but running her fingers <br/>
across the page -as if- she was reading them. That&#39;s the beginning <br/>
of recognizing that the letters on the page tell a story, correspond <br/>
to words spoken. That&#39;s a great thing.<br/>
<br/>
Count lots of stuff - sort socks (there&#39;s counting by twos for you, <br/>
unless you&#39;ve got someone in the house with more than two feet lol!) <br/>
She may not ask how many somethings there are. Here&#39;s a story from <br/>
when DS was about 3 and a bit: we were in the car, travelling a few <br/>
hours so we had snacks on hand. I handed him 3 cookies. A minute <br/>
later he asked for 4 more. I knew he couldn&#39;t have eaten 3 cookies <br/>
that fast so I asked why he needed 4 more when he already had 3 <br/>
sitting there. He said he wanted 7 and he had 3 so he needed 4 more. <br/>
What could I say? I gave him 4 more. Little everyday things &#39;add <br/>
up&#39; - setting the table for company for instance. A tip would be to <br/>
verbalize your thought processes - &quot;we usually need 3 forks but <br/>
Grandma and Grandpa are coming for dinner so we need 2 more. That&#39;s <br/>
5 forks we need from the drawer.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t/don&#39;t &#39;work&#39; with DS at all - we live with him. We try to <br/>
find stuff that is of interest or might be of interest to bring into <br/>
his orbit. Yeah, we had counting bears - they most often ended up on <br/>
the receiving end of a game of &#39;bowling&#39; or got crashed into by <br/>
matchbox cars or got tossed into a pot of pretend soup - counting <br/>
them? not so much. Playing freely and joyfully - definitely.<br/>

**********************************<br/>
I&#39;m reminded of something the sage Stephen Wright one asked: &quot;Why is the  <br/>
alphabet in that order? Is it because of that song?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
In general, no I don&#39;t think you need to be teaching her the alphabet.  <br/>
However, the book Chicka Chicka Boom Boom by Bill Martin is the coolest thing. <br/>
Forget the alphabet,  it&#39;s the rhythm. Amazing to read, and if you can find the <br/>
tape with Ray Charles  reading it...well, forget the kids you&#39;ll love it. So, <br/>
yeah, get this book... &quot;A  told B and B told C, &#39;I&#39;ll meet you at the top of the <br/>
coconut  tree.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Oh!  And Animalia, by Graeme Base, with the loveliext pictures and  verses <br/>
and puzzles in the world.<br/>
 <br/>
Forget the alphabet (and that song!) But really, get these books. The kids  <br/>
might like them too.<br/>

everything *right*, yet it&#39;s so hard to sort through all the right <br/>
answers offered out there. Just living and being and breathing and <br/>
loving your young children will be getting it right. Pat Farenga (I&#39;m <br/>
assuming that&#39;s the newer guy you referred to) isn&#39;t, as I understand <br/>
it, unschooling as many on this list would define it, and the first <br/>
thing that will be helpful is learning how to breathe through the desire <br/>
to compare your children with anyone. It&#39;s no more helpful or meaningful <br/>
now than it was when they were learning to roll over for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Spending a lot of time just reading here at this list, at Sandra&#39;s site, <br/>
at Joyce&#39;s new website will help you think through and sort out all the <br/>
nuances between teaching and facilitating. There&#39;s also the <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled list where there are many parents discussing how to <br/>
unschool little ones--under age 8 or so--which you might find really <br/>
helpful, and you can check out my website linked below and my blog <br/>
linked off there to see what unschooling looks like in our home (mine <br/>
are 8, 6 and 5).<br/>
<br/>
I remember about 4.5 years ago I thought it was so great that my <br/>
youngest daughter, then about 2.5, could sing the abc song. We were just <br/>
moving back East from Albuquerque, NM and hadn&#39;t seen family for a <br/>
while, and they made such a big deal when they came to visit that she <br/>
could sing the abc song. That was back when I was really beginning to <br/>
seriously read and *talk* about homeschooling, so it was like a huge <br/>
justification as I saw it. Well, as my older child got less interested <br/>
in singing the song, Julia gradually forgot it. She&#39;s been slower, too, <br/>
to learn the letters and their sounds than my oldest, who&#39;s just <br/>
deciphering how to read now.<br/>
<br/>
When Julia learned the song, it had little to nothing to do with the <br/>
actual alphabet and certainly nothing to do with reading, pre-reading or <br/>
reading readiness--whatever schools want to call it. She will make the <br/>
connections between the word &quot;Aaa&quot; and the letter &quot;A&quot; or &quot;a&quot; and the <br/>
sounds &quot;ah,&quot; &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;aa&quot; and the word apple or all or place when her <br/>
brain is ready to make those connections and not before, and when she <br/>
does, she will own it. She comes a little bit closer to this week by <br/>
week, month by month and year by year. She asks for help when she needs <br/>
it, enjoys being read to, likes practicing every once in a while.  Each <br/>
little bit, if my oldest daughter is any indication, creates connections <br/>
that will finally make reading itself relatively easy once it all <br/>
clicks. The process itself can be long but it doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
difficult if outside sources don&#39;t make it so.<br/>
<br/>
Children naturally encounter the alphabet, language and the written <br/>
word. They will naturally begin to make those connections and ask <br/>
questions when they&#39;re curious. Numbers are no different. Facilitating <br/>
means getting them out in the world, bringing the world to them, <br/>
answering their questions and following their lead. We have alphabet <br/>
children&#39;s books around the house that we&#39;ve picked up over the years, <br/>
one of which is one of Julia&#39;s favorite books. She loves to hear it, has <br/>
it mostly memorized--all of this is part of the process. We periodically <br/>
pick up alphabet books from the library and read them--part of the <br/>
process. What we don&#39;t do is sit down daily, weekly or monthly to do <br/>
some &quot;letter work&quot; because Jules is six and needs to learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
Just last night, Emily wanted to direct a short film, and she enlisted <br/>
all of us for particular parts. She wanted Jules to play the monster&#39;s <br/>
victim, but Jules didn&#39;t want to be a victim. Em said she&#39;d be right <br/>
back with Julia&#39;s lines for her &quot;scream time&quot;--a really great double <br/>
entendre though she was really meaning &quot;screen time.&quot; Jules called after <br/>
her, &quot;But I can&#39;t read!&quot; Em came back in with Julia&#39;s <br/>
line--&quot;Aaaaa!&quot;--and showed her how to &quot;read&quot; it. Another connecting moment.<br/>
<br/>
I was just sharing over at AlwaysUnschooled that I have a saying for dh <br/>
or other doubters--&quot;Curriculum happens.&quot; I just shrug off comments about <br/>
how my kids will learn with &quot;Curriculum happens,&quot; and I share about all <br/>
the learning connections kids make over time. It doesn&#39;t happen in a <br/>
single week or a single month, but over time curriculum does happen, <br/>
which is why boxed curriculum and schools are so unnecessary and <br/>
artificial. Kids, over time, will likely encounter all those ridiculous <br/>
things that E.D. Hirsch outlines in his _What Your x Grader Needs to <br/>
Know_ books, minus a few poems or songs or stories here and there. When <br/>
Em was describing her movie to me last night she said it was going to be <br/>
&quot;like that story about the boy and the girl who loved each other but <br/>
their families fought all the time--you know...&quot; Romeo and Juliet was <br/>
what she meant. Shakespeare. Life creates learning moments and <br/>
connections and cultural literacy--we don&#39;t need the Hirsch&#39;s or Bennets <br/>
to do it for us.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; But I want to know if I should be doing things like repeating the<br/>
&gt; alphabet to her? I know she could recognize the letters if I did,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had alphabet books and my kids watched a lot of Sesame Street.   We had a <br/>
tape called &quot;Sounds like Fun&quot; with an alphabet song they liked.    Singing the <br/>
alphabet if the kid&#39;s into it seems fun, but &quot;REPEATING&quot; the alphabet?   Just <br/>
saying the letters?   eeyew.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the good of her reconizing letters &quot;early&quot;--sooner? <br/>
Have things around you that include alphabet books or toys or songs and have <br/>
magnetic fridge letters or alphabet puzzles, and she&#39;ll pick it up as part of <br/>
everyday life.   If you have an everyday life without any alphabet toys or <br/>
fun, you can change that easily.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was waiting to see if, like in Holt&#39;s books, she just goes straight<br/>
to reading someday.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t go straight to reading knowing the alphabet.   It&#39;s not &quot;straight,&quot; <br/>
it&#39;s meandering through a rich life.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I feel like an idiot<br/>
telling people I&#39;m homeschooling (they haven&#39;t ever heard the term<br/>
UNschooling) and then my 3 year old can&#39;t say the alphabet, and<br/>
everyone else&#39;s can...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Would your three year old be in school if you weren&#39;t &quot;homeschooling&quot;?   Why <br/>
can&#39;t you just say she&#39;s at home with you?   Why can&#39;t you just say &quot;She&#39;s not <br/>
old enough for school, and we&#39;re planning to homeschool when she is&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do I get certain counting bars so she can play with them, or just<br/>
wait until she asks how many of something there is?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Neither.<br/>
Discuss how many in the course of your everyday life.   Have things she can <br/>
play with (cuisenaire rods if you want, but there are lots of counting things <br/>
besides those--Duplo, blocks, pipe cleaners, dice).   <br/>
<br/>
Where do the &quot;just wait&quot; ideas come from?   Live a happy, fun-filled, <br/>
conversation-and-discovery-filled life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do I correct her<br/>
when she miscounts as toddlers will (by just repeating the order<br/>
correctly, not meanly or implying she&#39;s wrong) or do I correct her<br/>
when she makes up the words on a page and point to the right word and<br/>
tell her what it is? Or is this too much teaching?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could count on your fingers if you think she&#39;d be interested in the right <br/>
order, but she&#39;s not hurting anything by counting wrong.   She&#39;s just little. <br/>
  If she makes up the words on a page and is having fun doing it, maybe ask <br/>
her a question about her story.   Get into her reading instead of letting her <br/>
know it&#39;s &quot;wrong.&quot;   If you&#39;re taking turns reading, let her read a while, and <br/>
then you read what&#39;s really there, and give her a turn, and you read the next <br/>
page, etc. maybe.   IF she&#39;s having fun.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One thing that really intimidated me was in the book Teach Your Own,<br/>
the author (not Holt, the newer guy) mentioned that their youngest<br/>
could count by 2&#39;s forever and by 5&#39;s to 100 by the time she went to<br/>
kindergarten (by her insistence until she got bored.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
All three of the Farenga&#39;s kids have been in and out of school.   John Holt <br/>
didn&#39;t have any children.   There&#39;s good theoretical information in that book, <br/>
but there are people here whose children are REALLY truly living unschooling <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Man, should I be doing something different?&quot; I just don&#39;t<br/>
see how my kid will one day ask, &quot;How do you count by 2&#39;s?&quot; when they<br/>
don&#39;t even know what it is? So how does one so young learn to want to<br/>
learn specific things like that?-=-<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t want to learn to count by twos, but they might want to play games. <br/>
  If you take turns counting and you do all the odd numbers and she does all <br/>
the even numbers (IF she&#39;s having fun) that might be a way to talk about it.   <br/>
 Lining something up in pairs (blocks, dice, cookies, pretzel sticks, rocks <br/>
in the yard) might be a way to get to it.    Messing with concepts should also <br/>
be an ongoing thing---a little one day, a little more in a week or a month or <br/>
an hour or when the kid brings it back up.   You have years.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-Thanks for all your help. I can&#39;t wait to start this journey!-=-<br/>

too literally and get spooked by the grade levels.   <br/>
<br/>
If there are any adults who would be clueless about the things that are in <br/>
those books, that would be a damned shame for those adults.   (If the adults <br/>
were Americans, I mean; they have lots of American history and government.)<br/>
<br/>
Having those books as idea sources isn&#39;t bad, if the &quot;grade level&quot; can be <br/>
dismissed.   Having the Worldbook lists of curriculum aren&#39;t bad (ditto on the <br/>
grade levels).<br/>

are so damaged themselves, or so shut down, that their use of idea lists <br/>
could help their children.   Not everyone is equally imaginative or open to ideas <br/>
or methods of setting the world aswirl.<br/>

There are LOTS of lifers in prison, I bet, who knew their alphabets early.   <br/>

Kirby could name letters before he knew how old he was.   It was just the <br/>
infant version of a bar trick, like tying a cherry stem in a knot with your <br/>
tongue.   It&#39;s not GOOD for anything at all, except making another person go &quot;wow.&quot; <br/>
  Letters don&#39;t need to be named by one year old children any more than <br/>
cherry stems need to be tied in knots.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kirby, Marty and I just lived and breathed Sesame Street for a few years.   I <br/>
didn&#39;t mind.   Kirby was into voice acting and puppetry, and Jim Henson and <br/>
Frank Oz were incredible examples.   <br/>
<br/>
When Holly came along and got old enough to say &quot;I hate Big Bird,&quot; we sadly <br/>
turned it off, but there were other things for the boys and other things for <br/>
Holly.   Then when she was nine or ten she discovered our Best of Sesame Street <br/>
tape and wanted to know ALL about all of it--the actors, the principles and <br/>
intents behind the show, the way it had evolved over the years.   She was coming <br/>
at it from an analytical educational point of view, which was fun for me, and <br/>
I was a good source for her as I&#39;d been studying education in college when <br/>
the show was new and being discussed and analyzed within that profession.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing happened with Raffi.   Kirby and Marty knew all the Raffi songs <br/>
when they were little and &quot;Raffi in Concert&quot; was a standard part of our get-well <br/>
kit when a kid was sick and moved to the couch with juice in one cup, water <br/>
in another, box of kleenex, favorite blanket, Raffi.    But Holly:   Raffi made <br/>
her sick.   She rejected it whole.   <br/>
<br/>
A week and a half ago Holly (who&#39;ll be 14 in a couple of months) asked me to <br/>
download a song for her, she thought it might be Raffi, Bananaphone.    I told <br/>
her I thought there was a cassette tape upstairs, told her where, I was <br/>
right, she found it.   We were going out anyway so she took it in the car.   I had <br/>
bought that used but about the time Holly said &quot;no Raffi,&quot; so it had just been <br/>
set on that shelf not knowing it was waiting for Holly to request it <br/>
specially.<br/>
<br/>
Her interest in this song came from a flash cartoon in which a character <br/>
hears it but his roommate doesn&#39;t and it drives him crazy.   There&#39;s insanity and <br/>
death in the cartoon (cartoon death).   But Holly just liked the song, and we <br/>
discussed the puns, the humor of &quot;gramma-phone&quot;/Gramophone&quot; and whether that&#39;s <br/>
what caused him to write the song in the first place, about Raffi himself, <br/>
about Canadian songwriting, Francophones, American references in songs by a <br/>
Canadian songwriter, about the children&#39;s music market, long distance telephone <br/>
history and realities...    <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t plan it.   It came out of the swirl.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305934690">Sometimes the simplest is the best:<br/>
<br/>
  First off, your child is three. I had the hardest time realizing that the rest of the world is in a huge rush to out do each other that they push their kids into anything and everything just so they can say &quot;My ____ learned his ABC&#39;s by age ___&quot; and the poor kids don&#39;t have time to PLAY and be a child. I just read recently that if kids are not allowed to be kids now they will do it later. It is so hard not to get pulled into the world and jump on the band wagon. I decided that I want my child to have his childhood now and so I am letting him be a child before anything else so he can be an adult when he is suppose to be an adult. I remember my MIL telling me of a friend of hers grandkids that knew their ABC&#39;s by age two and I worried about this. I would stress and even take it out on my poor two- year-old at the time. Then I look at the big picture and realize that it will not say on his resume: &quot;Potty trained by age 6 months and learned the ABC&#39;s by age 2&quot;. You will not hear the<br/>
 person interviewing saying:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I see it says here in your resume that you went to _______ daycare as a two -year-old  and we&#39;re named &#39;first to potty train&#39; could you tell me something about that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 I believe all the pressure does is for the parents and grandparents to brag about the kid and nothing more. It is so hard to not fall into this though.<br/>
<br/>
 No, my son did not know all his ABC&#39;s by age two but last winter he made a volcano in the snow at age 4!<br/>
<br/>
My 5 YO son Jonah is FINALLY getting somewhere. I just spent weeks doing the &quot;letter of the week&quot; thing and last week found out he did not &quot;get&quot; any of them I did! Yes he understood while we did it and so I thought he was learning but after a letter review I was surprised to find he did not pick up the ones I did it on. Yet suddenly he knew letters I have never told him anything about. So I know he is learning more without the hallabaloo. So I just read now. <br/>
<br/>
  Also, months ago I got these little stickers A-Z and put them on his toy cars and trucks. I intended on making games of playing with his toys. Then we moved to Texas and I had forgot about it. Then yesterday he found some of them and I brought them to me demanding I remove the stickers from his trucks as he does not like them. So I told him that he has to learn them before I remove them and so he is learning the ABC&#39;s that way. <br/>
<br/>
    As far as numbers go I started putting one number on the wall (written on paper plates) and we add one more daily and he counts to that one. Today we are up to number 37 and he loves to do this. I notice a definate improvement and he now counts a lot more. When we get up he tells he we need to do the numbers and he keeps reminding me if we don&#39;t. He use to count to 20, skipping 17 and now he does not skip any numbers. <br/>
<br/>
  Hope this helps,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am sometimes intimidated by hearing what other people children can do. And you do hear a lot of amazing things that unschooled children can do!<br/>
<br/>
However, I try to keep in mind that there are surely things that my children can do that those children can&#39;t. One child might know times tables at age 5, another might know the names of all the birds in the backyard, another might know the names and abilities of all 150 Pokemon, another might be making lots of money by helping out her elderly neighber, another might be really good at playing basketball, another made have made his own video game, another might have trained the family dog to do 30 tricks,...<br/>
<br/>
Also, being a parent is not a contest to see how much your kids can learn or do academically or athletically or in any other way! People are born with different abilities and interests and need to follow their own path in life. Our job is to help our children find and follow their paths, not to force them along a path that another child might be taking and that looks better to the outside world.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck. It&#39;s great to see people starting on unschooling.<br/>

He&#39;d ask and we&#39;d answer (Is 7 odd or even? Not exactly sure what <br/>
touched off the idea of &#39;odd and even&#39;) Then he wanted to know how <br/>
we knew. So we made piles of stuff - pennies, M&Ms, crackers, <br/>
whatever was at hand - if we could make two same size piles, it was <br/>
even. If there were &#39;extras&#39; it was odd. Then he started doing it in <br/>
his head, making two piles to see if a number was odd or even <br/>
(dividing by two). Then we got into more fun stuff one evening while <br/>
playing with numbers - if you add two odd numbers, the result is <br/>
even. If you add two even numbers, the result is even. BUT if you <br/>
add one even and one odd, the result is odd. Not exhaustively, not <br/>
extendedly, just for fun for a while.<br/>

until that last bit. Please do take off the stickers and treat his  <br/>

Japanese kanji stickers all over some of your favorite objects and  <br/>
said he wouldn&#39;t take them off until you&#39;d memorized them.<br/>
<br/>
He will learn by living life. He&#39;s also learning that letters are  <br/>
annoying when you have to learn them to get the stickers off your own  <br/>
possessions. And he&#39;s learning that his feelings aren&#39;t nearly as  <br/>
important as what Mommy wants him to do.<br/>

&gt; I notice a definate improvement and he now counts a lot more. When  <br/>
&gt; we get up he tells he we need to do the numbers and he keeps  <br/>

what she meant. Shakespeare. Life creates learning moments and <br/>

Jayn is very interested in Romeo and Juliet. Her interest stemmed from<br/>
getting a truly beautiful Juliet ballerina Barbie, and she wanted me to<br/>
elaborate on the brief description of the story on the box. <br/>
<br/>
Remarkably enough we are (slowly) reading the play now, in snatches, but she<br/>
wants me to tell her the story often.<br/>
<br/>
Time to find a movie version for her to see.<br/>

Anyhow my point was that character toys can be a way to a myriad of cool<br/>

labeled &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165562575">Thank you all so much for the reassurnce that letting my daughter <br/>
play for now is okay. The only thing I limit right now is all-day-<br/>
long TV watching, though she HAS picked up several things from TV <br/>
shows alone (mostly disney and nick jr.). I wish we got local <br/>
channels, though. Our anntenae doesn&#39;t pick up PBS or most of the <br/>
regular channels, for that matter, and satellite won&#39;t offer local <br/>
channels in our area (too rural.)<br/>
<br/>
But it both makes me proud and guilty when she knows something that <br/>
I&#39;m not even sure where she learned it from. I&#39;m proud because she&#39;s <br/>
picking things up, but I feel it&#39;s MY responsability to make sure she <br/>
gets her info since I&#39;m the one keeping her out of school. (Her dad <br/>
is too, it&#39;s just he&#39;s at school himself all day teaching, so I&#39;m the <br/>
one home most of the time, of course.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ll definately look for all the books you&#39;ve mentioned, <br/>
especially Chicca Chicca Boom Boom!<br/>
<br/>
And the comment about fun having value...that&#39;s one of the main <br/>
reasons I wanted to try unschooling. I have always had one theory in <br/>
my own learning experiences, and when I controlled my own choice of <br/>
what to learn (ie Science Fair projects or reports) I always said <br/>
they had to be fun. I did optical illusions, topology (the kind where <br/>
you turn a donut into a coffee cup), subliminal messages, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I actually look forward to learning things for REAL this time around, <br/>
when the kids are older and doing more hands on stuff in the more <br/>
complicated subjects. I can&#39;t remember most of my schooled facts, the <br/>
other reason I&#39;m unschooling.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That one totally ridicules something doesn&#39;t make it &quot;totally ridiculous.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ridiculous is a harsh word.   It means clearly worthy of the ridicule of all.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;random quality&quot; do you mean the seeming random selection, or the <br/>
unevenness of the quality of presentation?   Because both questions are clarified if <br/>
you read the introductions and know the overall purpose of the cultural <br/>
literacy ideals he was originally after, even before those books were created.<br/>
<br/>
-=-juxtaposed with the absolute certainty with which Hirsch states that<br/>
3rd, 4th or whatever graders need that particular information.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He and his supporters had in mind a set of knowledge without which (and I <br/>
agree, honestly) an adult is disadvantaged in learning more on his own, on having <br/>
an understanding of other things he will read in literature, magazines, see <br/>
in movies, hear on TV.   If a person doesn&#39;t know some basic literature and <br/>
history, passing references become meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The idea<br/>
that knowledge needs to be combined in particular ways and learned at a<br/>
particular age or else--I don&#39;t know or else what-=-<br/>
<br/>
Or else they might not understand the things they would be learning in a <br/>
district or state which might have adopted Hirsch&#39;s outline for curriculum.    I <br/>
think it&#39;s better than what most districts use, because he&#39;s looking at the <br/>
literature that&#39;s out there, and the idioms in English that would be better <br/>
understood if people knew enough of the background of the culture to get them all.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use a curriculum here at all, but I would be ashamed if my kids knew <br/>
no folklore, no fairy tales, nothing whatsoever of Bible stories, and if I <br/>
had somehow indicated that it wasn&#39;t worth knowing the meaning of cliches and <br/>
aphorisms older than anyone now living.    <br/>
<br/>
I think first grade classes would be WAY better off discussing &quot;A bird in the <br/>
hand is worth two in the bush&quot; than coloring pictures of autumn leaves <br/>
(although they could do both at once).   I think they&#39;d be better off hearing Three <br/>
Billy Goats Gruff than some recently-written story.   <br/>
<br/>
Common experiences (a cultural literacy) are important if people are going to <br/>
understand others without bafflement.<br/>
<br/>
If every state has a different curriculum, and within that every district, <br/>
kids who move from school to school are not getting &quot;the same education.&quot;   <br/>
Whether that&#39;s good or not, it&#39;s a serious consideration for those who are <br/>
concerning themselves at the philosophical level (and planning levels) of public <br/>
education.   <br/>
<br/>
Hirsch had an idea for a better way to plan a curriculum, and had (has) a <br/>
purpose that I don&#39;t think is ridiculous.    <br/>
<br/>
As to the evenness of the presentation (if that&#39;s what you meant), the <br/>
stories are presented there just in case someone isn&#39;t familiar, but he recommends <br/>
finding better versions of those or anything else in the books.   The books are <br/>
intended to be checklists, not sources of literature or history or musical <br/>
education or math.   They have the barest summary and he hoped people would go <br/>
to REAL sources.<br/>

We had  alphabet books and my kids watched a lot of Sesame Street.   We had  <br/>
a <br/>
tape called &quot;Sounds like Fun&quot; with an alphabet song they liked.   Singing the <br/>
alphabet if the kid&#39;s into it seems fun, but  &quot;REPEATING&quot; the alphabet?   <br/>
Just <br/>
saying the letters?    eeyew.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the good of her reconizing letters &quot;early&quot;--sooner?  <br/>

My kids, even the non-unschooled one, learned the letters as a consequence  <br/>
of boredom or killing time while waiting in public places. I wasn&#39;t one of <br/>
those  moms who kept the diaper bag full of toys and little containers of  <br/>
Cheerios.  We made do.<br/>
 <br/>
That means if we were in the pediatrician&#39;s office, the best distraction I  <br/>
had for impatient waiting were the things around me.  The animal shaped  letter <br/>
poster on the wall, the Great Bible Stories book that seems to be in  every <br/>
waiting room I&#39;ve ever been in.  If we were in the car dealer while  Daddy was <br/>
negotiating the deal, the giant letters on the front windows were good  for a <br/>
distraction. The alphabet song, along with the Itsy-Bitsy Spider  song, is <br/>
good for a few minutes waiting for the pee to come when  sitting on the potty at <br/>
the gas station.  I sang songs when they were  learning to use the potty <br/>
because it killed the time and took their mind off any  kind of reluctance or <br/>
disgust at the public restroom.  We sang all the  time for everything, really, and <br/>
still do.  Any song we could think of or  make up, and the alphabe song was <br/>
one of those.<br/>
 <br/>
I like the song.  I think it&#39;s valueable, but not more valueable than  <br/>
Itsy-Bitsy Spider.  I think learning the letters through the song, with no  <br/>
particular goal in mind, as if letters were like Legos or Lincoln Logs, is right  in <br/>
line with a wholesome unschooling life.<br/>
