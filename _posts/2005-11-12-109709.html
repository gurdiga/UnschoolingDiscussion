<div id="ygrps-yiv-703426674"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-I think it was Ren who posted that they wouldn&#39;t be able to learn to<br/>
&gt; speak and a couple of more people agreed.  This kind of shocked me<br/>
&gt; coming from ya&#39;ll radical homeschoolers!  ROFL...  Afterall, hey,<br/>
&gt; maybe they wouldn&#39;t call a tree a tree but who would we be to say<br/>
&gt; that &quot;ugh-uh-buga&quot; isn&#39;t speaking?  KWIM?  -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well good question.   What is &quot;speech&quot;?<br/>
A baby unable to make any utterance might be said to be without speech.<br/>
<br/>
An adult who had had a stroke or something and was no longer communicating <br/>
verbally would be said to have lost speech.<br/>
<br/>
Language and speech aren&#39;t the same thing, exactly.   It&#39;s easy for it to <br/>
seem so among people whose speech capability is used to communicate <br/>
linguistically.   There they seem the same.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has no larynx left (accident, smoking, cancer, something) but can <br/>
still read and write, hear and maybe learns to sign, he still has language, <br/>
but not speech.<br/>
<br/>
On a desert island a baby raised by... a coconut or something... would <br/>
vocalize, and might make patterns and names to entertain himself, but it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
language unless there was another person who understood it and communicated <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
Same issues exist with reading.   Does sounding out words equal reading?   I <br/>
can sound out words in some languages I can neither speak nor understand, but <br/>
I know the phonics rules.   So can I &quot;read&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Reading is quite complex, and schools like to give people an A in reading, or <br/>
say &quot;Oh, yes, her reading is coming along great&quot; of people who cannot <br/>
honestly, fully read in the wilds of the the real world, but are doing great with <br/>
phonics worksheets and programmed readers.     <br/>
<br/>
One reason unschoolers&#39; reports of reading seem   shockingly late to some <br/>
people is that we aren&#39;t dealing with phonics work sheets and programmed readers, <br/>
so reading (in the real world) is NOT sounding out three letter words on <br/>
lists or doing other reading-readiness exercises.   It&#39;s picking up real written <br/>
communications and understanding what they say.<br/>
<br/>
If reading is sounding out, then silent reading isn&#39;t reading.   I don&#39;t <br/>
&quot;sound out&quot; (in my head) more than maybe one word in 10,000 when I&#39;m reading, and <br/>
that would be the name of a place or person I&#39;ve never seen, or a term that&#39;s <br/>
new to me.    <br/>
<br/>
Riding bikes, my recent best analogy:   There&#39;s riding a bike (a little bike, <br/>
with training wheels) and riding a bike (for the first time without training <br/>
wheels, when dad lets go, but that doesn&#39;t mean turning or stopping) and then <br/>
there&#39;s going on a twenty-mile ride and keeping up.    Which is &quot;riding a <br/>
bike&quot;?<br/>
