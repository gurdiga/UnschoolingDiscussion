<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900912282">Hi again.<br/>
I&#39;ve posted some in the past (on the boards I think) about my <br/>
experience with coercing my kids over sugar and junk food in the <br/>
past, and then the decoercion process, and that now they have a much <br/>
healthier relationship with food- certainly better than I had as a <br/>
child.  But lately I&#39;ve become concerned because my 8yo has <br/>
gradually gotten to the point where he wants to drink soda <br/>
throughout the day.  He likes Coke and Root Beer, and wants one <br/>
first thing in the morning, last thing before bed, and every time in <br/>
between that he wants a drink.  Occasionally he&#39;ll drink orange <br/>
juice as well, but not usually.  Anyway, I know there are lots of <br/>
theories out there about sugar- some say that it&#39;s fine in any <br/>
amount and others say that it&#39;s basically poison.  I&#39;m not sure how <br/>
I feel, but I want to give my son accurate information.  I&#39;ve <br/>
expressed concern to him about the amount of sugar (isn&#39;t it <br/>
something like 12 teaspoons per can?) but he insists that he likes <br/>
it and feels fine.  <br/>
If we&#39;re out of it he&#39;ll just walk the block and a half to the <br/>
shopping village where several stores sell it and buy one as he has <br/>
plenty of his own money.   <br/>
Do any of you have avid soda drinkers in your families?<br/>
I don&#39;t want to screw up the progress we&#39;ve made by being <br/>
overreactive, yet at the same time I&#39;m worried.  <br/>

This isn&#39;t what you&#39;re asking about, but I thought I&#39;d throw it in anyway. <br/>
It&#39;s my understanding, thru different things I&#39;ve heard over the years, that a <br/>
lot of soda is bad for bones, and even more so when they&#39;re still growing (kids <br/>
and teens). That&#39;s the part of soda I&#39;m more worried about than the sugar <br/>
with my kids! They know about it, and therefore we have the moderation thing <br/>
around here with the soda/water/juice ratio. There&#39;s always soda out in the <br/>
garage, and they love it, and usually pick it a couple times a week. Sorry if that <br/>
didn&#39;t help much, Lara.........</div>

Something like that.  Another thing to tell them is that a diet high in<br/>
sugar tends to cause insulin resistance, making both obesity and type II<br/>
diabetes far more likely.<br/>

  **Do any of you have avid soda drinkers in your families?<br/>

<br/>
  My husband drinks quite a bit of soda.   So I worried about it with my kids.  Especially when we decided to let them decide on what they wanted to eat or drink.<br/>
<br/>
  We started this type of thinking about a year ago and its been fine.<br/>
<br/>
  At first my ds (10) would drink Mountain Dew all the time.  After about a month or so he decided that he would have a soda a day,  (sometimes its 2, sometimes its none).   He hardly ever has Mountain Dew anymore, usually its Sprite.  I just said to him that he could have it if he wants it,  told him what was in it,  we talked about it not replenishing his body (if there&#39;s caffeine in it) and all that.   Then I left him alone.   <br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
  Does your son get signals from anyone that his choice to have soda isn&#39;t the &#39;right&#39; choice?    I know for me if there&#39;s anyone around who thinks what I&#39;m doing is bad or wrong, I&#39;ll do it even more.   (I&#39;m not saying you are doing this but maybe there&#39;s someone else around?)<br/>
<br/>
  I know sometimes my youngest would make some really off the wall requests at wierd times just to test me and when I&#39;d say sure, she&#39;d decide she didn&#39;t want it.  <br/>
<br/>
  I know I went through a phase of drinking a lot of Coke,  but now I don&#39;t drink any at all.  <br/>
<br/>
  I bet it will pass.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure that he knows it makes me uncomfortable to see him drinking <br/>
soda after soda.  I don&#39;t know if it figures into his decisions or <br/>
not.  I think it&#39;s more that he thinks he feels fine and can&#39;t <br/>
understand why I&#39;d worry about it.<br/>
As far as insulin resistance and type II diabetes... they have an <br/>
uncle with this (my sister&#39;s husband), and even knowing his <br/>
situation (giving himself shots several times a day, more than one <br/>
episode of some sort of insulin imbalance where paramedics had to <br/>
come, the fact that he&#39;s prone to other problems because of the <br/>
diabetes) they still have a hard time connecting it with drinking <br/>
soda.  I also haven&#39;t stressed that too much because I wasn&#39;t sure <br/>
if diabetes was in fact related to high sugar diets... I thought it <br/>
was more a genetic condition.   I&#39;m definitely going to look this up.<br/>
It&#39;s just interesting because most of the conversations about kids <br/>
and sugar are about how they simply don&#39;t overdose when given true <br/>
freedom, and that&#39;s been true for my children for the past few <br/>
years.  Now I&#39;m finding myself in a situation where I think my kid <br/>
*is* overdoing it in this one area (soda).  He&#39;s right now on his <br/>
second A$W root beer within the last hour alone.  <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if it could possibly be similar to an addiction... the <br/>
sugar high, followed by a crash, followed by a craving for more.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem bothered by this, because as far as he&#39;s concerned he <br/>
can always just have another soda- problem solved.<br/>
I&#39;m hoping it passes quickly.<br/>

Patti, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m cleaning out my way-overful mailbox, and I had saved this one.  I don&#39;t <br/>
remember whether you got lots of responses or whether it was settled, and I <br/>
hope people didn&#39;t ignore it!  <br/>
<br/>
Do you want to talk about it anymore? (Maybe you don&#39;t...)<br/>
<br/>
Keith, my husband, drank lots of Coke for a while, when he was early 20&#39;s.  <br/>
He said after a while he noticed it made his throat weird, and he quit drinking <br/>
it for years.  Now (25 years later and most of the time since) he drinks one <br/>
with a burger or steak, but usually drinks juice.<br/>
<br/>
I went to college with a coca cola addict (we all said) who needed one in the <br/>
morning and at night.  We used to walk with her to find one if she and the <br/>
dorm machines were out.   In the dining hall, she&#39;d always try the coke <br/>
dispenser at breakfast, in hopes that someone had forgotten to disconnect the tank and <br/>
clean it out.  Sometimes she lucked out.<br/>
<br/>
She was intelligent, wealthy and happy last I  knew.  I didn&#39;t ask about her <br/>
health. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby drank a lot of Dr Pepper for a year or so, and then went four or five <br/>
months with absolutely no caffein, just on his own, from New Year&#39;s this year <br/>
until sometime in late May, I think.  Now he&#39;s occasional, lots of water.<br/>
