<br/>
too funny - my 3 yo says &quot;each other&quot; the same way.<br/>
<br/>
My boys go through waves - sometimes for days I don&#39;t have to interfere at all<br/>
and they do so well - happy and having fun.  Then they can go for days just the<br/>
opposite - fighting constantly - and nothing I do, or don&#39;t do, seems to help.<br/>

&gt; The deschooling ourselves is such a challenge! My oldest son and I were<br/>
&gt; doing some research on snakes. With my school mindset, I asked him what<br/>
&gt; questions we need to answer to put together on snakes, thinking of stuff<br/>
&gt; like what they look like, where they live, etc. HIS questions though, were<br/>
&gt; why do they have forked tongues, why do they shed their skins, and my<br/>
&gt; favourite, will they evolve into something else. I love it when he forces me<br/>
&gt; to think outside of my sometimes narrow framework!<br/>
&gt; About the siblings - that is a struggle around here sometimes too, although<br/>
&gt; today when they couldn&#39;t seem to get along I separated them into their own<br/>
&gt; rooms, and told them I was angry because they weren&#39;t being good friends to<br/>
&gt; each other. Within a few minutes, my five year old had crept into the three<br/>
&gt; year old&#39;s room to ask him to play again, then they shouted down the stairs<br/>
&gt; to me that they were being kind to &quot;our ch&#39;other&quot;<br/>
&gt; Separation seems a fate worse than any, I guess.<br/>
&gt; I was just at the Oak meadow site, inspired by what I&#39;ve read on the list,<br/>
&gt; and if it ever becomes necessary for me to register with a private school<br/>
&gt; like that, that&#39;s sure the way I &#39;d go. I put in a subscription to the<br/>
&gt; magazine too - it looks wonderful.<br/>
&gt; Sorry, too long again - I seem to save up my thoughts then dump them at<br/>
&gt; once!<br/>
