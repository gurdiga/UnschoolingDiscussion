<div id="ygrps-yiv-662521032"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Labels are really useful sometimes. Many years ago, dh and I went to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Europe. I had very long hair and ran out of conditioner. We were in <br/>
Greece at the time. I could find the word for shampoo in my little <br/>
dictionary, but not that for conditioner. Without the &#39;label&#39; - or in <br/>
other words, a word that meant the same thing to both me and the <br/>
shopkeepers, I had to use sign language. And all they offered me was <br/>
shampoo. By the time I got back to England, my hair was ruined and I had <br/>
to have it cut short. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You had hair conditioner all around you and you didn&#39;t even know it!<br/>
Apparently an olive oil/honey mixture works well as a conditioner. I haven&#39;t tried it yet, but I certainly would if I were in Greece faced with your circumstances.<br/>
Here is a recipe for it, if you can&#39;t get a hold of conditioner, or if you want soft, shiny hair the &quot;natural&quot; way. ;-) Sorry your hair was ruined.<br/>

Rosemary Honey Hair Conditioner <br/>
<br/>
The extremes of heat and cold we endure throughout winter can make even the greatest of hair look and feel like straw. This nourishing conditioner blends honey for shine; olive oil for moisture and essential oil of rosemary to stimulate hair growth. <br/>
<br/>
Gather: <br/>
<br/>
1/2 cup honey  <br/>
<br/>
1/4 cup warmed olive oil (2 tablespoons for normal to oily hair) <br/>
<br/>
4 drops essential oil of rosemary <br/>
<br/>
1 teaspoon of xanthan gum (available in health food stores) (this could probably be skipped if necessary)<br/>
<br/>
 Place all the ingredients in a small bowl and mix thoroughly. Pour into a clean plastic bottle with a tight fitting stopper of lid.Apply a small amoung at a time to slightly dampened hair. Massage scalp and work mixture through hair until completely coated. Cover hair with a warm towel (towel can be heated in a microwave or dryer) or shower cap; leave on to nourish and condition for 30 minutes. Remove towel or shower cap; shampoo lightly and rinse with cool water. Dry as normal and enjoy shinier, softer and healthier hair the natural way.<br/>
