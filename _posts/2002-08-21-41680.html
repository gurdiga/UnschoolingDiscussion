<div id="ygrps-yiv-854726147">Hi everyone! I just have a few things to say, then back to my self imposed <br/>
lurkedom! (I just couldn&#39;t resist!) <br/>
First on Emenim and other musical artists. Choosing to restrict a child&#39;s <br/>
interest in music which has content that *you* may find objectionable is of <br/>
course a parental issue. You may have moral or religious issues with the <br/>
language. But educating yourself on the whys and wherefores would be a good <br/>
thing. I could go on and on about how Marshal Mathers (Emenim) had a horrible <br/>
childhood, raised by a mother with serious issues, married a woman who, long <br/>
story short, took advantage, and used her child as a pawn.... I will say that <br/>
he writes about what he knows, he has made a market for himself, and is <br/>
learning along the way. (His music reflects that learning) He tells a great <br/>
story through his music, and if you can get past the language, (there are <br/>
censored/clean copies of his music available, you don&#39;t have to buy the <br/>
original version!) and know a little about his life, his music is really deep <br/>
and moving. All this, and I am not really a big rap fan! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On painting windows, or putting signs up. The town I live in is really weird. <br/>
It is the capitol city and we have more than our share of politicians and <br/>
lawyers. We also have our share of weird/way-out-there religious element too. <br/>
One thing that we have way too much of is signs. A man named Fred Phelps <br/>
lives here with his family/religious community, he is a disbarred <br/>
lawyer/preacher extrodinare! Our town will have seminars on how to &quot;combat&quot; <br/>
the (soon to be held) KKK/arian nation rally on the capital steps, but sits <br/>
idly by for years as Mr. Phelps preaches hate from the street corner daily. I <br/>
know from experience that the one way to draw people away from your cause is <br/>
to put up signs telling everyone how what they are doing is wrong. So with <br/>
that background, I think putting up signs or painting on windows could be <br/>
very tacky, and that is just my opinion and not an attempt to make anyone <br/>
feel bad. I guess my point is, if you want to educate the educators about <br/>
unschooling, painting negative and blasting quotes about how bad school is <br/>
won&#39;t get the job done. And it just might make you look like some fanatical, <br/>
kooky, nut. <br/>
<br/>
One last bit... Sandra, I really enjoyed hearing about the conference! I hope <br/>
others who went will share too!!! (More! More! Give me More!) I also liked <br/>
hearing about the video game talk. I think I need a copy of that to share <br/>
with certain members of my family. (myself included, as sometimes I slip and <br/>
wonder what the kids really learn from the PS2!) Jack would be a good kid to <br/>
show his skills off. Only being 6, he really amazes me with his ability. He <br/>
loves to play Spiderman and a role-playing game for kids called Jak and <br/>
Daxter. I love to sit and watch him play, he is so animated, he gives me blow <br/>
by blow descriptions of what he has just done. (even though I am sitting <br/>
right there! &lt;g&gt;) He will even pause the game, jump up, run to me and reenact <br/>
the game for me, complete with descriptions that go like this, &quot;Then I jumped <br/>
up and BOOM! I fell into dark eco and died! then i came back and had to get <br/>
some more powercells so I went to the farmer and chased his cows back to the <br/>
fence and he gave me his cell and did you know you have to slap the cows to <br/>
get them to go? Did you have to slap your cows to get them to go <br/>
along-time-ago-back-when-you-were-little? I bet you didn&#39;t live on the beach <br/>
with your cows...&quot; All the time his face is glowing, and you can tell his <br/>
brain is going faster then he can get the words out! How do I get a copy of <br/>
that tape?!!? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
