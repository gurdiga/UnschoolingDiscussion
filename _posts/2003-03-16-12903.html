Since I can&#39;t afford to buy Front Page right now I have to deal with the pop<br/>
ups.  I have lots of information for everyone whether they homeschool,<br/>
unschool, etc.  I have freebies, sites for moms, dieting, work at home, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am sorry you feel that way.  Almost EVERY site on the net has some type of<br/>
pop ups.  At least mine are just from tripod and 50 don&#39;t pop up at once<br/>
like many sites.  I have a wealth of information that helps many people.<br/>
Yes, you could find it all elsewhere but it would take you a long time to<br/>
find it all.  My site compiles it all in one place.  I have spent many days,<br/>
weeks, and months working on my site.  I keep it updated and I am always<br/>
adding new things.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one of these days I can afford Front Page and can get my own domain<br/>
name.  Until then it will remain at tripod.  Many people must enjoy the<br/>
information since I have had over 12,000 visitors in a little over a year.<br/>

look at it from the aspect of people who are new to unschooling or want to<br/>

it&#39;s a nice place. You won&#39;t find support for anything that doesn&#39;t look like <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914406241">Re: popups<br/>
<br/>
I am so excited because dh and I upgraded my &#39;puter today from 32 MB RAM to 256.  We also added a CD RW, so now I can finally get all those digital photos backed up on CD and clear some hard drive space on my teeny tiny 3.2 GB hard drive that we thought was HUGE when we bought this 4 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I noticed right away is the difference in popups.  At 32 MB RAM, I could hear my computer chugging away, dealing with the popup, finally the popup would popup, then I could delete it and get on with things.  Now they popup nearly instantly and I can delete them much faster!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323484672">Hello<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list and hoping for some guidance on unschooling. My oldest 2 (15 and 17) did some private school, and some homeschool during the years. We never used a boxed curriculum, but we did set semester goals, keep track of projects, make reading lists, etc. My 17yo opted to go to public hs this last year, mostly for the sports :-). My 15yo hasn&#39;t been to school in many years, but she convinced the local junior college to let her in last semester; she&#39;s mainly concentrating on college stuff now.<br/>
<br/>
But my 4yo -- what a handful! He and I are both in the right &quot;place&quot; for unschooling I think ... but I&#39;m not really sure how to get started.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980669377">We have been unschooling since birth, LOL.  When my dd was born (now 8 1/2)<br/>
I searched the internet for homeschooling, found unschooling and Sandra et<br/>
al over on AOL, to unschooling.com and the rest is history.<br/>
<br/>
Dd, by her own choice, this year attends a Sudbury model school (unschooling<br/>
school).  She is very outgoing and social and our local homeschooling group<br/>
and arranged playdates never satisfied her needs.  So this works well for us<br/>
(though I miss her!).<br/>
<br/>
Ds is 4 1/2 and home.  Well, at the office, actually.  I own a veterinary<br/>
hospital and ds comes with me.  He helps out, has his own room with<br/>
computer, TV/VCR, art supplies, books, etc, and a grassy area out back<br/>
(well, it&#39;s melting snow now &lt;g&gt;) where he can play, we have a futon for<br/>
resting if he needs it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The kids play well together and this weekend it was warm, the snow was<br/>
melting, and they spent hours in the wooded area in our front yard, in the<br/>
shallow stream and mud, playing.  They rode their bikes, watched Chitty<br/>
Chitty Bang Bang, Heidi, and MacGyver, helped make brownies and cookies,<br/>
read books, drew pictures and wrote notes, played checkers, etc.  Pretty<br/>
typical.<br/>
<br/>
Dh and a friend spent Saturday afternoon doing maintenance on their<br/>
motorcycles.  I walked 11 miles and worked on my novel.  Dh later worked on<br/>
a computer program he&#39;s writing for a friend&#39;s tent business, and went to<br/>

&lt;&lt; But my 4yo -- what a handful! He and I are both in the right &quot;place&quot; for <br/>
unschooling I think ... but I&#39;m not really sure how to get started. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With a four year old, you just never start any schoolish stuff.  The same way <br/>
he learned things as a baby and toddler, he can continue to use (minus, in <br/>
most kids, the tasting of every new item to see if it&#39;s food or chewable! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Try to consciously think &quot;stimulation&quot; when you&#39;re deciding what to do with <br/>
him.  Every time he sees, hears, touches, smells or even tastes (think <br/>
restaurant, not furniture) something new he&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of articles which discuss ideas for new unschoolers.  Both <br/>
were first in Home Education Magazine (with links below that might work for <br/>
some people):<br/>

&lt;&lt; Could everyone tell me how old their children are, how long you have been<br/>
unschooling, and  what a typical day is like? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mine are 16, 14 and 11.  None has ever been to school.<br/>
<br/>
Typical days have changed over the years, but always involved the <br/>
availability of things to play with, music to hear, movies to watch, jokes <br/>
and fun, somewhere to go if it&#39;s been a few days and anyone&#39;s restless, <br/>
people coming over, encouragement and praise and thanking people for doing <br/>
something nice, or for having been patient, or whatever we can thank them for.<br/>
<br/>
  In the morning Kirby went to fighter practice (armored combat, informal <br/>
bouts, SCA thing) and then to a movie with two older friends.   Holly hung <br/>
out with me, we drove Marty around to find a friend who was supposed to be <br/>
playing basketball in a certain park and then going to play orc-ball with <br/>
Marty, but Marty needed to cancel orc ball for weather and too small a group <br/>
available that day.<br/>
<br/>
The basketball game wasn&#39;t happening either, but we went to the gaming shop, <br/>
where the guy was.  Then we went to a bookstore to get a Rolling Stone for <br/>
me, a gift for a party Holly&#39;s going to (we got some booster packs and  a <br/>
Harry Potter magazinish thing--lots of photos and interviews about the <br/>
movies, and some about other movies--really nice, and when we got home I read <br/>
lots to Holly and we looked at all the pictures, trying not to finger-print <br/>
it or eye-track it too severely).  Then we went to Baskin Robbins, where <br/>
marty had wanted to go in the first place, but I had to spend something to <br/>
get cash.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly invited a friend over and they played dolls for hours and hours, until <br/>
9:55 when I drove her home in the rain.  <br/>
<br/>
At night Marty had four kids over to watch movies on DVD, and they&#39;d stop to <br/>
check outtakes and had a great time.<br/>
<br/>
I went to bed before Kirby got home.  <br/>
<br/>
I could tell the tale of what all my husband did, which interwove through all <br/>
of that.  He was at fighter practice too, but had gone earlier than Kirby.  <br/>
Kirby went with one friend, and came back with different ones.   Then he <br/>
(Keith the husband) worked in the garage and the yard some, we talked about a <br/>
new weed we have this year, already up everywhere, and we don&#39;t recognize it. <br/>
 Marty helped bring some boxes out to the shed for me because I&#39;m afraid to <br/>
go on stairs with boxes now for a while, because of a recently broken leg.  <br/>
Keith went to Costco, and brought back pizzas as a surprise.  That was nice, <br/>
since we had kids coming and going all kinds of times.<br/>
<br/>
There were a few more things, but that wasn&#39;t an unusual day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350640614">Hi, I&#39;m also new to the list and mostly a lurker as I get so busy I<br/>
can&#39;t read as often as I would like.. But I love these glimpses into<br/>
others daily &#39;unschooling&#39; lives. It helps chase away any old &quot;voices&quot;<br/>
(of doubt) that pop in there every now and then! <br/>
<br/>
	(Wasn&#39;t there a Far Side cartoon where a kid opens the door of<br/>
the Teacher&#39;s<br/>
	Lounge and finds behind it monsters, smoking?  I feel like one<br/>
of the<br/>
	monsters &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
	It was a lovely quilt, each piece of fabric an article of<br/>
clothing that was <br/>
	my mothers. One of the pieces had her name and date of birth and<br/>
death. Then <br/>
	that poem that goes &quot;One hundred years from now, it will not<br/>
matter what kind <br/>
	of car I drove, what kind of house I lived in, how much money I<br/>
had or what <br/>
	my clothes looked like.  But the world may be a little better,<br/>
the universe a <br/>
	little brighter, because I was important to a child.&quot; and then a<br/>
personal <br/>
	note followed:<br/>
	&quot;Karen (My legal name)--Your mother&#39;s mission in life was to<br/>
make a <br/>
	difference not just in the lives of her own children, but all<br/>
children whose <br/>
	lives she was able to touch.  She succeeded in both, and not it<br/>
is your <br/>
	priilege to carry it on to following generations.  You too will<br/>
succeed, for <br/>
	you have a lot of your mother in you.<br/>
	In loving memory of your mother.<br/>
<br/>
This is Wonderful! As a quilter and a daughter, I cant imagine a more<br/>
precious and personal gift!<br/>
What a special father you have.<br/>
