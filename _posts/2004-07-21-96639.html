**If you or your kids are into the unschooling approach for learning &lt;G&gt;,<br/>
check out a delightful resource entitled &quot;Grimoire for the Apprentice<br/>
Wizard&quot; authored by Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, a true wizard, and the members<br/>
of the Grey Council, a group of elders Witches and Wizards all. One of the<br/>
absolute best books I&#39;ve seen for introducing young (and also not so young)<br/>
folks to magick.<br/>
