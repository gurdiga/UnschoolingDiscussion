&lt;&lt; So either unschooling is only about education and is not a total <br/>
lifestyle OR unschooling is going to be different for those with <br/>
special needs children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The principles of unschooling apply whether a child is &quot;gifted&quot; or slow, <br/>
fully balanced as to Gardner&#39;s intelligences, or heavy on two and light on <br/>
the other five or six.  <br/>
<br/>
BECAUSE unschooling is individualized (being about individuals) it is not <br/>
&quot;different for those with special needs children&quot;--that would be to say there <br/>
is a kind of unschooling which applies to regular/normal/whatever kids, and a <br/>
second kind of unschooling which applies to &quot;special&quot; children.  <br/>
<br/>
On any imagined continuum there are some needs which would come in FROM <br/>
unschooling, without any conflict with unschooling, for individual kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Nobody expects a child to learn sign language without seeing it. <br/>
Nobody expects a child to figure out how to self-regulate fits of emotional <br/>
without advice or assistance.<br/>
Nobody expects a child to recognize or get over clinical depression without <br/>
some loving support.<br/>
<br/>
But that is not to say that unschooling doesn&#39;t work with those kids, or that <br/>
it is a whole different kind of thing.  It isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Individualizing is individualizing.  Living in the moment is living in the <br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
Justifying a resistence to unschooling by join others to resist isn&#39;t <br/>
beneficial to the resistent NOR to those coming for ideas and help.<br/>
