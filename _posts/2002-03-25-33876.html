<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065674201">I about have given up on posting here...it&#39;s been so frustrating <br/>
lately.<br/>
All this bickering could have been solved by following Joyces&#39; <br/>
recommendation of not commenting on posts themselves but the content <br/>
only.<br/>
Here&#39;s the dichotomy.....<br/>
There are a couple of very vocal people that seem to get offended <br/>
everytime anyone questions another posters views on unschooling. I <br/>
remember a post where I questioned someone about how an unschooling <br/>
child could &quot;get behind&quot; and I got jumped all over by these <br/>
particular people.<br/>
If they found my post offensive, then that is their right. They have <br/>
a right to point out that they found my post abrasive or whatever, <br/>
but instead they jumped in and answered the person I was originally <br/>
writing to and accused me of being the &quot;unschooling police&quot; etc....<br/>
Why can&#39;t a person just say &quot;I don&#39;t agree&quot; or whatever?<br/>
There does not need to ever be this attack of someone pointing out <br/>
how certain views or comments don&#39;t fit in with unschooling.<br/>
Disagree, discuss and so on, but DO NOT attack the person with <br/>
opposing viewpoint.<br/>
I have over and over again seen these certain people that accuse <br/>
anyone with &quot;pure unschooling&quot; philosophies (saying that <br/>
the &quot;purists&quot; are bashing people over the head) be the ones that are <br/>
the MOST argumentative, and &quot;bash over the head&quot; style of anyone.<br/>
It gets very, very frustrating to share your unschooling views and <br/>
have a couple people get all over you for sharing them.<br/>
Why can&#39;t everyone just share their views without commenting on <br/>
anyone elses style?<br/>
When a person points out what does NOT fit in with unschooling, there <br/>
is no cause for alarm.<br/>
Let it be.<br/>
PLEASE!!!<br/>
I would love to see unschooling discussed, instead of arguing about <br/>
arguing.<br/>
No one is trying to fit anyone into a box, rather help them think <br/>
outside of it!!!<br/>
It seems that so many things are being taken out of context, and <br/>
blown out of proportion.<br/>
I am so very thankful that Sandra has come back to this board, and <br/>
for many that continue to post here.<br/>
It saddens me that the problems here have cause the FOUNDER of <br/>
unschooling.com to leave and that HEM could have been hurt in any way.<br/>
We should all think about this and figure out some guidelines that <br/>
will help this board stick to discussing unschooing and NOT whether <br/>
another persons post is offensive or not.<br/>
Sheesh!<br/>

I notice this was written last Monday. I just got it today, Saturday. I&#39;ll <br/>
just assume you&#39;re feeling better and enjoying the new kinder, gentler <br/>
Unschooling-dotcom list that I&#39;ve witnessed this past week. :o)<br/>
