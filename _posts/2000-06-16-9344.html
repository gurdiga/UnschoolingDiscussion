&gt; Not Just for Scary Religious People: Homeschooling Goes Mainstream<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How quickly things change. Not long ago, the<br/>
&gt; educational establishment derided the idea of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling, claiming that mere parents couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; teach kids adequately -- after all, education is for<br/>
&gt; professionals. But now, after homeschool students<br/>
&gt; swept this year&#39;s national spelling bee, the<br/>
&gt; education elites are objecting that these kids are<br/>
&gt; TOO well-educated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what&#39;s it going to be? The defenders of America&#39;s<br/>
&gt; failed education policies can&#39;t seem to make up their<br/>
&gt; minds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A homeschooler first won the national spelling bee in<br/>
&gt; 1997. But this year first, second, and third places<br/>
&gt; ALL went to homeschoolers. When the results were<br/>
&gt; broadcast, the establishment circled the wagons:<br/>
&gt; &quot;These kids are not socialized,&quot; they cried. &quot;They<br/>
&gt; spend too much time studying.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Really? Well, this year&#39;s winner, 12 year-old George<br/>
&gt; Thampy -- who also placed in the National Geography<br/>
&gt; Bee -- wrote an excellent article about his education<br/>
&gt; for the WALL STREET JOURNAL. In it, young Mr. Thampy<br/>
&gt; soundly refuted many of the mischaracterizations of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In addition to taking trips and classes with other<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers, he says, he participates in sports and<br/>
&gt; Boy Scouts, and has friends in his youth group,<br/>
&gt; neighborhood, and from competitions like the spelling<br/>
&gt; bee. The socialization objection is specious on its<br/>
&gt; face.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of homeschooling&#39;s greatest strengths is the<br/>
&gt; quality of learning it provides. Since homeschool<br/>
&gt; kids don&#39;t spend hours in sensitivity-training, or<br/>
&gt; putting condoms on bananas in sex-ed class, they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; free to learn in ways public-school kids cannot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Moreover, as Helen Cordes writes for SALON Internet<br/>
&gt; magazine, homeschooling allows parents to tailor<br/>
&gt; education to their kids. Easy material can be taught<br/>
&gt; quickly, but difficult material can be given all the<br/>
&gt; time it deserves. A tailored education allows<br/>
&gt; students to visit museums, learn a musical<br/>
&gt; instrument, and devote themselves to things they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; passionate about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And it&#39;s not just Christian kids who homeschool these<br/>
&gt; days. An episode of the ultra-hip teen drama &quot;Buffy<br/>
&gt; the Vampire Slayer&quot; even showed Buffy asking her<br/>
&gt; mother to consider homeschooling. After all, Buffy<br/>
&gt; reasoned, &quot;it&#39;s not just for scary religious people<br/>
&gt; anymore.&quot; Well, even these unflattering remarks<br/>
&gt; reveal that the stigma is disappearing, as 1.7<br/>
&gt; million homeschool kids are entering the mainstream.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers are having phenomenal success getting<br/>
&gt; into top universities. According to Cordes,<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers are accepted to Stanford at &quot;twice the<br/>
&gt; rate of schoolers.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now spelling bees and college admissions don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; necessarily prove that home-schooled kids are better<br/>
&gt; educated -- but they certainly illustrate the<br/>
&gt; importance of educational options.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some public schools do a great job. Others don&#39;t. And<br/>
&gt; homeschooling isn&#39;t for everyone. Some parents lack<br/>
&gt; the training, temperament, or time to teach kids. But<br/>
&gt; the principle is clear. Bureaucrats ought not to be<br/>
&gt; the ones deciding how we educate our children. And<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s why we need school choice and vouchers, to<br/>
&gt; allow parents to send their kids to schools that are<br/>
&gt; best for those kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Education isn&#39;t something we can compromise on. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the vehicle for transmitting our intellectual<br/>
&gt; heritage to our children.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Homeschooling&#39;s recent successes ought to serve to<br/>
&gt; remind us that educating our kids -- not propping up<br/>
&gt; a failed bureaucracy -- is what really counts.<br/>
