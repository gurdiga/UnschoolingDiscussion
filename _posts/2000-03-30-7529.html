<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779436936">Forgive me for not following this thread, but I just wanted to mention that<br/>
I have a friend with chronic lyme disease who was misdiagnosed for years and<br/>
who is very active in fund raising for lyme disease research. Apparently<br/>
there are  doctors and medical researchers who believe that chronic fatigue<br/>
syndrome and/or fybromyalgia(spelling!) are really undiagnosed lyme disease!<br/>
I know little about it myself, however. Food for thought.<br/>

&gt; I got to hear<br/>
&gt; Dr. Luc<br/>
&gt; de Schepper speak, and I have a friend who studies in his school and have<br/>
&gt; read his book too. He says that homeopathy is truly effective for ADD kids<br/>
&gt; by looking at them as unique individuals and identifying physical, mental,<br/>
&gt; and especially emotional symptoms and then precribing a remedy.  I wanted<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; mention that<br/>
&gt; Chronic fatigue and other illness can be caused with wheat allergy. Celiac<br/>
&gt; sprue (spelling?) disease means that those who suffer have to really cut<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; all wheat and lots of other things like spices that have additives, and<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; licking stamps-in order to get better.  It is often missed by medical<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; as a possibility, and can be tested for.<br/>
&gt; Forgive me if it has been mentioned as I haven&#39;t been following the<br/>
&gt; discussion closely.<br/>
