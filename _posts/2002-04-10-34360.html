       &quot;Instead  of ignoring this implication, lets look at how she arrived <br/>
at the thought.  &gt; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bridget, hey!  I honestly hadn&#39;t done the full logical thought process about <br/>
my conclusion and I see that from your suggestion you are right on target! (I <br/>
hope that sentence made sense!) Thank you.  <br/>
I arrived at the impression from reading about what ISN&#39;T part of unschooling <br/>
(such as lesson plans, mandatory math each day, a reading comprehension <br/>
exercise each day, etc.)<br/>
You&#39;re very right, I reached the conclusion based on the information about <br/>
what unschoolers DON&#39;T do. I appreciate the insight and am very curious now <br/>
that you have pointed this out =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is a whole lot harder to talk about what unschooling looks like in <br/>
practice, because it is totally absolutely and completely different for every <br/>
family. And it isn&#39;t easily described by a list like schooling is - it isn&#39;t <br/>
an alternative method of schooling like doing unit studies is, for example. <br/>
<br/>
It takes time to read about unschooling and really &quot;grok&quot; it - it takes <br/>
reading LOTS of people&#39;s anecdotes and reading their philosophies and how <br/>
they apply it in their lives and thinking about how that philosophy might <br/>
apply in your own family&#39;s life while understanding that it will LOOK really <br/>
different in your family, even if the underlying principles are the same.<br/>
