<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773062817">bo·rax1 (bôrks, -ks, br-) <br/>
n.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.  A hydrated sodium borate, Na2B4O7·10H2O, an ore of boron, that is used as <br/>
a cleaning compound. <br/>
2.  An anhydrous sodium borate used in the manufacture of glass and various <br/>
ceramics. <br/>

[Middle English from Medieval Latin from Arabic braq,  from Middle Persian <br/>
brak.] <br/>
<br/>
borax &#92;Bo&quot;rax&#92;, n. [OE. boras, fr. F. borax, earlier spelt borras; cf. LL. <br/>
borax, Sp. borraj; all fr. Ar. b?rag, fr. Pers. b?rah.] A white or gray <br/>
crystalline salt, with a slight alkaline taste, used as a flux, in soldering <br/>
metals, making enamels, fixing colors on porcelain, and as a soap. It occurs <br/>
native in certain mineral springs, and is made from the boric acid of hot <br/>
springs in Tuscany. It was originally obtained from a lake in Thibet, and was <br/>
sent to Europe under the name of tincal. Borax is a pyroborate or tetraborate <br/>
of sodium, Na2B4O7.10H2O.<br/>

It&#39;s mined right out of the ground.  &quot;Environmentally friendly&quot;?  I live in <br/>
the desert, so it&#39;s pretty environmental around here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s poison to eat it, but not deadly just sickening (and so are lots of <br/>
things, if you eat them in quantity).<br/>
<br/>
In the wagon train movies (not popular in the past decade or two) when they <br/>
start yelling and whining about alkali flats and the water being undrinkable, <br/>
they&#39;re on about borax or potash or some naturally-occuring salt-stuff which <br/>
is found where the land was under water prehistorically (or during the flood, <br/>
for the creationists in the readership).<br/>
