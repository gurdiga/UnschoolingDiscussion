&gt; &gt;I realize that this is now drifting pretty far from topic, but in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;interest of international vegetable awareness, I thought folks might like <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;know that the Okinawan people practically worship sweet potatos.  Ours<br/>
&gt; &gt;aren&#39;t orange though, they&#39;re purple, and were introduced to Okinawa 400<br/>
&gt; &gt;years ago.  They are used in EVERYTING here, including-and I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; &gt;kidding-ice cream and donuts.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s like green chile here in New Mexico.  Green chile burgers, pizza,<br/>
&gt;cheese, bread, ice cream, brownies, pasta, candy, hot chocolate, <br/>
&gt;everything!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835629361">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Nayha & I have a 4 yo son (to be 5 in August) & recently learned about unschooling.......& find it neat that there is such a thing,  as in my heart, it always felt right, but since I had never heard of it before nor knew anyone that felt similar, (& didn&#39;t know it actually had a name...), I was feeling very lonely in my thoughts. Not so anymore, especially as I discover more & more resources to read n stuff.... like John Holt&#39;s books & &#39;The Unprocessed child&#39;, etc<br/>
<br/>
in any case, as I read, i realised i was still falling into the more traditional & prevalent ways of doing certain things with Nishay (my son) & I let up  (since about 10 days now) & have been letting him decide a lot more things - like what he wants to eat (he&#39;s been binging on popsicles) & how much TV he wants to watch (PBS & his home videos). That is where i need a little help. He is not even 5 yet....is it ok to let him decide to watch all that TV? he watches from about 2pm (George Shrinks then zaboomafoo then dragon tales then clifford....sometimes all the way upto 6 pm!) THEN he wants to watch his home videos at night - last night he watched 2 movies (MVP & MVP2) until 1 am!! He has been pretty good about coming from the TV room himself & getting ready for bed without disturbing us.......but I am a bit worried. <br/>
<br/>
Should I let him decide & let him watch until he is sick of TV? will he ever get sick of it? He has been learning a lot from the movies - is interested in skateboarding & experiments on his skateboard quite a bit & is always asking me to help him learn new words in sign language n stuff. He is very active too - not at all a couch potato - he&#39;ll jump up n down with the people on TV.......<br/>
<br/>
I try & explain to him that i think it isnt good for him - all that TV (& popsicles - but i plan to let them just run their course & not get anymore)..... & he says &#39; I know, but I still want to watch&#39;<br/>
<br/>
any thoughts/advice would be appreciated!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Everything in your post seemed fine up to that point.<br/>
 <br/>
WHY did you blow it by trying to explain that you don&#39;t think it&#39;s good for  <br/>
him?<br/>
You set it up so that he could appease you (which shouldn&#39;t be his job) or  <br/>
blow you off (and it shouldn&#39;t be about you).<br/>
 <br/>
If you spent that energy and worry on finding ways that it IS good for him,  <br/>
everyone would be further along toward trust and hapiness.  And it&#39;s not  too <br/>
late.  It&#39;s too late to do it sooner, but it&#39;s not too late to keep  yourself <br/>
from continuing to damage what could be really sweet and good.  <br/>
 <br/>
And popsicles...  What&#39;s in there that&#39;s going to shorten his  life?  <br/>
Unhappiness WILL undoubtedly shorten a person&#39;s life.  Water  with fruit juice or <br/>
even just water with sugar and artificial flavors.... that  won&#39;t kill anybody <br/>
whatsoever.  It won&#39;t even kill a relationship.   Deprivation, on the other <br/>
hand, and controls, have killed many a happy  relationship.<br/>

fructose corn syrup, cost money, melty sticky messes) but he can&#39;t <br/>
watch all the TV he wants (no calories going in, just out <br/>
apparently, no messes in general, cost is a few pennies of <br/>
electricity - except for cable and purchased movies - and it comes <br/>
right to the house, no shopping trips needed)? Why is it that you <br/>
trust he will balance out with one but not the other? <br/>
<br/>
Sit and watch with him. Talk about what he likes about various <br/>
programs. Bring interesting things and opportunities into his world -<br/>
 for him to look into or not. If TV has been regulated (as it <br/>
appears) he&#39;s going to grab all he can before it gets taken away (as <br/>
it is seeming to him that it will from your comments). Every time <br/>
you make comments about how bad it is, how it&#39;s not good for him, <br/>
etc, re-start the timer of when he&#39;ll reach balance with it.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He can only eat all the popsicles he wants until this batch is gone and  then <br/>
the supply dries up.  (A sure way to make sure the next time he sees  <br/>
popsicles he will eat them voraciously, assuming they won&#39;t be there  forever.)<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think there was trust that either would balance out, yet.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s impossible to trust that a bicycle will balance, when one first sees a  <br/>
bicycle.  Their contact with the ground is teensy, and narrow.  They  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t balance.  And just left standing there idle with people staring  at them <br/>
saying &quot;that won&#39;t balance,&quot; they sure enough don&#39;t. They fall  right over.   But <br/>
if you get on one and RIDE it, and it&#39;s in motion,  and you&#39;re to the point <br/>
where you don&#39;t even have to think about how you&#39;re  keeping it in motion and <br/>
balanced, then you have real balance.   <br/>
 <br/>
Will people ride bicycles all the time?  Will they do nothing but ride  <br/>
bicycles the rest of their lives?  Given the opportunity, will they ride  bicycles <br/>
24 hours a day?  Will they ever stop riding bicycles?<br/>

help ...<br/>
<br/>
My girls (ages four and two) were watching Barney this afternoon and <br/>
my four year old said, &quot;I want to watch that one again!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said {meaning it; not trying to trick them}, &quot;Sure, we can watch <br/>
it again ... or, we can all go the kitchen table and get out the <br/>
paints.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They both leaped off the couch and yelled, &quot;Yay! Paints!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have any &quot;TV rules&quot; or limits but there are a lot of <br/>
options around here other than TV.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994564904">Hi Nayha<br/>
<br/>
What if he never got sick of TV? What if it turned out to be <br/>
something that he wants to do every day? The point isn&#39;t &quot;will he get <br/>
sick of it,&quot; but &quot;will he choose to other things for many hours of <br/>
his life, when he has absorbed a lot of TV?&quot; or &quot;will he choose lots <br/>
of activities in addition to the TV?&quot; and the answer to THAT question <br/>
is &quot;yes.&quot; My boy is 12, and we have a 10 year old girl, who have been <br/>
unschooled for about three years. They do choose &quot;screen time&quot; a lot. <br/>
TV, computer games, Nintendo 64, Gameboy, videos. When we removed the <br/>
parental controls, I worried that they&#39;d never choose anything <br/>
besides TV. But I was wrong, even though TV is big around here. Right <br/>
now, they&#39;re following plot lines in several different shows. These <br/>
story lines feed their imaginations, so that characters from <br/>
different shows pop up in their play time with friends, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was wrong about them &quot;never choosing anything besides <br/>
screen time.&quot; They do many things besides watching TV, but it is a <br/>
big part of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, they&#39;re selective. When a new show is advertized, they <br/>
check it out for a few episodes, and choose which ones they like. <br/>
They can tell me why they like what they like, and why they reject <br/>
other shows. They know their own tastes, they know what they&#39;re <br/>
looking for, and what they think is lame, they don&#39;t watch. They&#39;ve <br/>
learned quite a bit, aside from the little bits of info that come <br/>
through all the time. You know, the physics that one kid in a show <br/>
will quote, or the historical references in another. Even if there <br/>
was never an &quot;educational&quot; moment in any of their shows, I can see <br/>
that they&#39;re learning their own likes and dislikes, how to <br/>
discriminate, what qualities to look for, what makes a story good or <br/>
what makes it boring...etc.<br/>
<br/>
And watching with them has turned out to be pretty cool. when I sat <br/>
down with my kids and attended to what they were watching, I found <br/>
myself laughing (rolling with laughter) at some of it, and pleasantly <br/>
chuckling at least once in every episode. (I&#39;m talking about Cartoon <br/>
Network, Nickelodeon, and Disney, here...their favorite channels) And <br/>
they&#39;ll watch my show(s) with me: Crossing Jordan and Monk, and What <br/>
Not to Wear. My 17 year old girl, from watching &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot; has <br/>
figured out how to dress, to emphasize the &quot;strengths&quot; of her body <br/>
type, and de-emphasize the weaknesses (She is bult just like Raven. <br/>
Lots of curves. Little bit extra on the thigh region. Not a skinny-<br/>
minny). <br/>
<br/>
anyway. Relax. Sit with him and watch, and eat popsicles. As someone <br/>
else has suggested, having popsicles around all the time, as many as <br/>
he wants, will &quot;ease his mind&quot; about popsicles. Or any other thing. <br/>
If he knows there&#39;ll be more, he won&#39;t feel like he has to gobble <br/>
them up before they&#39;re gone. Same with the TV. When we first got <br/>
hooked up (just last November) we were at it constantly. Now that <br/>
we&#39;ve learned &quot;this episode will be on again, pretty soon&quot;...we turn <br/>
it off, or it&#39;s on just in the background while we visit or play <br/>
cards or cook dinner. <br/>
<br/>
And, btw, Letting kids have their own choice also means making lots <br/>
of choices available. there&#39;s nothing wrong with saying &quot;would you <br/>
like a cheese samwich and some apple slices for lunch?&quot; you know, <br/>
making lots of things available, including the popsicles. <br/>
 <br/>
blessings, HeidiC (who has been where you are. And who knows that  <br/>
&quot;relax&quot; is the best advice going!)<br/>

you&#39;ve set.  I think it is hard to abandon everything you&#39;ve invested<br/>

Your son will probably never get sick of television.  If you want him<br/>
to get sick of television aversion therapy ala A Clockwork Orange is<br/>
probably a more effective approach than letting him watch it and enjoy<br/>
it and relish it. And if you go so far as to sit with him and enjoy it<br/>
with him and to stay up until 1 am with him watching his videos and<br/>
talking about what he is enjoying and getting up and dancing with him<br/>
it will never get him to the point of being sick of television.  So if<br/>
your goal is to get him sick of television, this isn&#39;t the route.  If<br/>
however, you want him to see television as something that is a part of<br/>
life and as a resource for ideas and information and for zoning out<br/>
and something that he can enjoy with other people and something to<br/>
dance to and to explore and to leave when other things are going on,<br/>
then letting him watch whenever he wants is a good choice.  Joining in<br/>
with him is a good choice as well. Maybe if you follow his lead you&#39;ll<br/>
be able to see what he likes so much about television.  <br/>
<br/>
When Simon was 5 and we let go of any controls we had on his<br/>
television watching I was highly skeptical that this was an experiment<br/>
that would lead him away from television.  I was right.  It didn&#39;t<br/>
lead him away from television.  He really enjoys television.  What it<br/>
did lead to, after many conversations between David (dh) and myself,<br/>
was an understanding that television is good, that television is<br/>
entertaining.  Yesterday we were watching an old Haley Mills movie<br/>
called &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot; which is all about how Catholic<br/>
boarding schools are good at gently taking young troublesome girls and<br/>
turning them into morally responsible adults (and even nuns).  It was<br/>
on in the morning and I started to notice that all of the ads were<br/>
either about going back to school to get trained to get back to work<br/>
or were for things like those stair lift chairs typically for elderly<br/>
folk and the bath lifts for getting in and out of the bath.  I pointed<br/>
it out and we talked about why those commercials were on then instead<br/>
of being on more in the evening.  It wasn&#39;t a long conversation, and<br/>
at some point I was the only one watching the movie, Simon (8) started<br/>
playing a gamecube game and Linnaea (5) and her dad went out so she<br/>
could ride her bike (and she made really great skid marks on the<br/>
concrete and I went out after she came in so she could show me how<br/>
long they were and how even the two of us together couldn&#39;t get our<br/>
legs wide enough to span their length).  At some point later they both<br/>
came back and Linnaea and I had conversations about how beautiful the<br/>
dresses were and how much she&#39;d like it if I could make some dresses<br/>
in this very early 60&#39;s style, so I&#39;ll have to get patterns to do that<br/>
when we are in the U.S. as I can&#39;t seem to find good fabric stores in<br/>
the UK (maybe my mom has some of the 70&#39;s ones still from my<br/>
childhoodI&#39;ll have to remember to ask).  And then the movie ended and<br/>
we had lunch and we went out to meet up with friends.  <br/>
<br/>
My point is that letting go of your control over his television<br/>
watching isn&#39;t going to make him let go of television.  And, I guess,<br/>
that the trick isn&#39;t just to let go of television limits, it&#39;s to try<br/>
and enjoy the whole thing about television with him.  <br/>

=========<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, I thought about him.<br/>
But it&#39;s one thing to do something (including refrain from doing) because  <br/>
someone said to, and another to find sources of ideas that you then must try on  <br/>
your own and use your own thought and judgment to see whether they seem  <br/>
right.<br/>
 <br/>
Most people don&#39;t want to take that risk, I think.<br/>
 <br/>
Somewhere back in the odd things about homeschooling (way back like  <br/>
yesterday, but in the flood of e-mail that comes through here, I&#39;d never find  it) <br/>
talked about someone having said if we do something to our kids and it fails  <br/>
it&#39;s our fault.  If they go to school, it&#39;s not our fault.  <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s almost true, but becomes less and less true the more people who  <br/>
homeschool.<br/>
 <br/>
If a parent has no choice or too much fear to buck the mainstream, then she  <br/>
can blame failures on that.  &quot;Everyone put their kids in school, though, we  <br/>
had no choice&quot; or &quot;I got the vaccinations because I didn&#39;t want to learn enough <br/>
 to defend the decision not to; I was afraid not to.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
But...<br/>
If we show anyone (friend, neighbor, relative) that it&#39;s possible to thrive  <br/>
outside of school, then that means they DID have a choice.   And so  soon (or <br/>
already, now, in many cases) it WILL be their fault if their kids were  <br/>
screwed up by strangers, because they made a decision to leave them in school  <br/>
instead of choosing an option they fully knew they had.<br/>
 <br/>
And that is the downside to choices.  It makes us responsible for bad  ones.<br/>

Vinyl tablecloths cost about $2.44 at Wal-Mart and you can put one under a  <br/>
kid size table in the living room in front of the TV.  I did that for years  <br/>
until I didn&#39;t have to do it anymore.  (Will&#39;s neat, now, but he still  does art <br/>
in front of the TV.)  They&#39;re also good under high chairs.<br/>

I&#39;d gotten the idea from reading parenting books, that letting kids <br/>

Guess what - my 14 and 17 year old EXTREMELY creative daughters still <br/>
like coloring books. They sit and watch tv and color (oooh TWO evils at <br/>
a time &lt;g&gt;) - they love the costume coloring books from Dover, <br/>

They just asked the other day to go to the store near us that has a LOT <br/>
of Dover coloring books - they&#39;re out. They use Prismacolor pencils, by <br/>
the way.<br/>

Rosie also likes paint-by-number kits. She just bought a really big, <br/>
complicated one, for herself a week or two ago and has been painting on <br/>
it regularly.<br/>

dozen of the ones I like best hanging on the windows in my office <br/>
right now (it&#39;s nice being able to decorate my workspace at will but <br/>
they&#39;re starting to fade a bit from the sunlight). He&#39;s <br/>
the &quot;colorer&quot; - DS is fairly indifferent to coloring (I&#39;ve had large <br/>
collections of his barely touched or totally blank worksheets from <br/>
Bible class over the years - they eventually just get tossed). <br/>
However, give him a black pen or a fine point marker and he&#39;ll draw <br/>
you detailed diagrams and houses and his latest is making mazes for <br/>
me to solve - complete with cross hatched sections where there&#39;s <br/>
lava or lasers or whatever that I can&#39;t go through - then he hands <br/>
me the pen and I am to make mazes for him to solve (yes, we have <br/>
some books of maze type puzzles but he prefers to hand draw them <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076795918">Dover&#39;s Medieval Stained Glass Windows coloring book (full-sized, and I  <br/>
think the first stained glass coloring book they ever made, in the early 70&#39;s)  <br/>
was something my college boyfriend and I painted all up with watercolors from  <br/>
K-Mart. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
 <br/>
We carefully took the staples out of the book and bent the pages backwards  <br/>
to flatten (or cut them apart, as appropriate).  <br/>
 <br/>
I recently bought a flower fairies full-sized stained glass to paint to put  <br/>
over a smallish dual-glazed window that has cobwebs inside and can&#39;t be <br/>
cleaned  in there (over where we installed a dog/cat door in a window on a porch, <br/>
kind  of).  The colors are fading too much, though.  I know I COULD just  paint <br/>
the window, but I&#39;m not a good artist.  I could paste up printouts of  photos <br/>
of Holly.   ***sigh...***  I&#39;m thinking of Holly  again...<br/>
 <br/>
I have lots of coloring books and most I&#39;ve had since before I had  kids.  <br/>
They&#39;re the Dover and Bellerophon historical topic coloring  books.  I used to <br/>
photocopy pages for the kids to color sometimes.   Recently I told Holly she <br/>
could color right in them if she wanted to, and I  immediately regretted it, but <br/>
I think she could tell, and she hasn&#39;t done it.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I used to use stuff from the Dover books (legally, many of them are were  <br/>
made for that purpose) in publications I did in the days when publications were  <br/>
cut-and-paste print jobs.<br/>
Now &quot;cut and paste&quot; has nothing to do with rubber cement or spray glue and  <br/>
non-photo-blue pencils and light tables. &lt;bwg&gt;  Now it&#39;s like  this:  <br/>

difficult to walk around the house after he&#39;s webbed the whole <br/>
place! I bet he&#39;d like to make a maze with string.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s raining today and since I&#39;ve been walking around quite a bit <br/>
with a gassy baby today, I&#39;m a little afraid to encourage a people <br/>
sized maze right now...I&#39;m quite likely to end up tripping over it! <br/>
I wonder how we could make a small one. Putting string around <br/>
toothpicks stuck in styrofoam or something. But I don&#39;t think we <br/>
have any styrofoam...any ideas? We do have red yarn, which would be <br/>
harder for me to miss and trip over...<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of a friend whose son would build a new minature golf <br/>
course in the basement every day. He got pretty detailed with it, <br/>
esp. for a four year old. Intense kid. That was my first exposure to <br/>
a homeschooled kids where it was so obvious that they would suffer <br/>
terribly in school. They were so intense, so serious, which doesn&#39;t <br/>
usually go over well in public schools...<br/>

visitor centers of the places we go; I make a point of checking for them <br/>
and picking them up where ever we go because *I* think they&#39;re so cool.<br/>
<br/>
They make really great *quiet* hotel activities, stuff to do in <br/>
restaurants in the evening, that kind of thing. Sometimes the books <br/>
don&#39;t get touched the whole trip; some probably still haven&#39;t been <br/>
touched. But they also make for great follow up whenever the kids pull <br/>
them out and decide they&#39;re interested in them. They&#39;ve made Sacagewea <br/>
and Pocahontas books by cutting out their colored pages and re-stapling <br/>
them. They&#39;ve also made some really cool Colonial period paper dolls by <br/>
coloring and then cutting out the people. Loads of opportunities with a <br/>
little cannibalization. ;)<br/>

free hand, but sometimes it is nice to just paint a pretty picture. I <br/>
saw some of these awhile ago and the pictures look like they have been <br/>

 The colors are fading too much, though.  I know I COULD just  paint <br/>
the window, but I&#39;m not a good artist.  I could paste up printouts of  photos <br/>
of Holly.   ***sigh...***  I&#39;m thinking of Holly  again...**<br/>
<br/>
My mom cleaned some stuff out of her garage and handed lots of old papers to me.  Many were letters that I had written her when away at camp with a friend or travelling with grandma.  I was a bit surprised to see how much I wrote &quot;I love you mommy&quot; and similar sentiments over and over.  So when I was away I was feeling the same (but opposite) &quot;missing you&quot; kind of feeling that you are having for Holly.  (She&#39;s undoubtedly having it too on this trip, when she&#39;s not whirlingly busy.)<br/>
<br/>
Although I have a pretty strong relationship with my mom now, apparently I no longer dote on her quite as much as I did when I was a pre-teen.  That was some intense doting, believe me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>big &quot;Plug-In Drug&quot; fan and had this weird fear (because I&#39;d heard this <br/>
a lot) that even a little TV would hamper my kids&#39; creativity and make <br/>
them unable to entertain themselves. Now I&#39;m wondering why people say <br/>
that. Now that I let my kids watch freely, I do not find that to be <br/>
true at all.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While waiting for the doc the other day, I picked up a magazine with Goldy Hawn on the cover.  (That is a nice little interview, BTW).  After I read her interview (and still waiting) I scanned one that mentioned the importance of limiting kid&#39;s TV and computervideo game time.  I think the article was something along the lines of what to do with kids now that school is out for the summer.  It said it&#39;s ok to let your teen watch a movie and play games or surf the web - all in the same day - once in awhile, but don&#39;t let it be a habit.  Then it said that time on the computer for academics shouldn&#39;t count against the kid&#39;s screen time, thereby contradicting their earlier statement that too much *time* with TV etc. is just plain bad for kids.<br/>
