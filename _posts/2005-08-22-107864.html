That did work at my house, because Keith was already aware very early that he <br/>
didn&#39;t remember very much of his everyday childhood.   Kids at school were <br/>
mean to him, his mom was mean, his dad liked his older brothers better (wasn&#39;t <br/>
mean, just ignored him a lot apparently).   So when I would ask &quot;What did you <br/>
get for Christmas when you were four (or five or whatever) he would very <br/>
honestly say &quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
So if I said &quot;Don&#39;t you remember!?&quot; he would say no, and I would say WELL I <br/>
DO, so trust me, he does have feelings and he DOES have awareness, and what we <br/>
do now will be part of who he is for life.<br/>
<br/>
(Didn&#39;t say all that in one sitting.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;He&#39;s five, he should know better!&quot; *I* would counter with, &quot;Well,<br/>
*you* are 38! At what age do you think you should have figured this<br/>
out?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh.   That sounds effective but scary. <br/>
<br/>
I guess our version of that has been to remind the other parent that the <br/>
child is genetically likely to be that way for life.   Marty&#39;s failings are like <br/>
Keith&#39;s, and Keith hasn&#39;t gotten over them.   Kirby&#39;s like me.   Holly&#39;s still <br/>
less easy to guess and read, but that&#39;s fine.   She&#39;s #3 and we&#39;re already <br/>
relaxed with her.    <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking just this morning as I gathered trash from around the house in <br/>
a clear plastic bag the city provides free that... (long intro to my point, <br/>
sorry) ...when Kirby was little we couldn&#39;t use the free city bags.   We still <br/>
got them and stockpiled them and used them for other things, but we had to buy <br/>
black plastic trashbags because Kirby didn&#39;t want us to throw away ANYthing <br/>
that looked fun or potentially useful.    And I (being me) was TRULY not <br/>
throwing stuff away lightly.   I still have broken toys from when they were little.  <br/>
 So if Kirby&#39;s packrattish, we can&#39;t expect him to outgrow it, because I <br/>
haven&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Ben&#39;s got it now. He sometimes has to nudge *me* in the right<br/>
direction! &lt;g&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Keith too, to   me.   He&#39;s a good coach now.   He used to not know whose side <br/>
to take sometimes because he thought Kirby was wrong AND I was wrong, but now <br/>
he&#39;s likely to take Kirby&#39;s side and tell me I&#39;m forgetting what it was like <br/>
and that I don&#39;t want to say things I&#39;ll regret and such.    What also helps <br/>
(and might be with Ben a little too) is that now the kids ARE in the age ranges <br/>
Keith remembers.<br/>

That did work at my house, because Keith was already aware very early <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, Ben honestly couldn&#39;t remember anything before he was 15/16. I <br/>
remembered down to three-ish.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So if I said &quot;Don&#39;t you remember!?&quot; he would say no, and I would say <br/>
WELL I<br/>

&lt;G&gt; I think remembering how you felt as a little one is soooo <br/>
important. And when we say that we&#39;re trying to be the parents we wish <br/>
we had had, the connection is there---if you can remember. That part <br/>
was hard for Ben.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;G&gt; Yeah--maybe!  But it was effective. I felt like a heal when I said <br/>
it the first time. I also told him to ask his mother whether she only <br/>
had to tell him *once*---&lt;G&gt; That did wonders! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Keith too, to   me.   He&#39;s a good coach now.   He used to not know <br/>
whose side<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes Ben just assumed that the child was in the wrong---just <br/>
because. (I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s what was modelled for him.) It was hard <br/>
for him to understand that a child&#39;s capabilities aren&#39;t necessarily <br/>
that of an adult&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been wonderful to realize that things aren&#39;t that black & white. <br/>
And yes, Ben IS capable of remembering what his 17th year was like. He <br/>
still struggles with nine! &lt;g&gt; But we have Cameron&#39;s history, which is <br/>
fresher in his mind. He has the teenage thing down pretty well! He&#39;ll <br/>
do fine too when Cam&#39;s in his early twenties and wanting to be on his <br/>
own---Cameron probably won&#39;t be in as big a hurry to get out as Ben was <br/>
though! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
