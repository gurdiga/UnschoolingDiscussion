&gt; family of four, not eight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s only 3 of us, and I often cook for a crowd.  I just figure cooking<br/>
extra means half the work.  The next meal comes out of the fridge or<br/>
freezer, into the microwave and on the table in under 5 minutes!<br/>

on the 4th of July and loving it!)</div>
