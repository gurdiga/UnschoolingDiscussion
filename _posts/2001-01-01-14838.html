<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059572018">Instead of &#39;unschooling choir&#39; how about children&#39;s choir run by the <br/>
children, who organise to hire the choir leader who knows that s/he <br/>
is not the boss?  Would this work?  for older ones more than young <br/>
ones, and the structure would have to be carefully thought out.<br/>
