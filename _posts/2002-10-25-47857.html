I have swatted kids. Not meaning to, and not lately.  Every time it was <br/>
because I was more stressed out than the kid.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a story written really soon after it happened (though it&#39;s an old <br/>
story now):<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have never spanked. I have come close many times. Mostly when I have<br/>
run out of other options. So I try to keep finding new options. I do<br/>
tend to yell and do the guilt thing more then I would like. And lately<br/>
I have been realizing that most of my frustrations seem to have to do<br/>
with issues of control and I am working on that. It has been eye opening...<br/>
<br/>
What exactly do you consider great results? ;o) I am still working on dealing<br/>
with a lot of typical 2 yo and 5 yo behaviors, definitely don&#39;t have kids<br/>
who *always* behave, but they seem no worse then any other kids their age. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935141869">In our family, we spanked off and on until Alex (now 9) was 5 or 6.   My husband and I were both spanked growing up and thought it was an option to discipline children.  Wrong.  When Alex was in kindergarten, (he went for 1 semester), he started having troubles.  They have this colored card system that they use to notify the parents of the number of times a child was in trouble during the day.  They cut construction paper into little squares, of differing colors, to have the kids bring home daily and the parent sign and return to school the next day.  The child would miss recess if the card wasn&#39;t returned no matter the reason.  Green=no problems at all, yellow=1x, orange=x2, blue=x3, and the undesired red card for 4 or more infractions.  He started bringing home those darn red cards with an ugly note written on them about how my child wouldn&#39;t behave in class.  This is before I &#39;discovered&#39; that homeschool/unschool was even a possibility.  We tried our best to work with the school and the teacher (which now I believe she is a total witch and doesn&#39;t like the boy children in her classes because they are too much trouble).  I was called numerous times weekly about his behavior.  We tried talking with him, taking away privileges, and anything else the &#39;regular&#39; parenting books advocate.  Then we resorted to spanking him.   <br/>
<br/>
We finally decided to spank.  He was talked with and told that Daddy would spank him if he brought home red cards anymore.  Before long, he was bringing home those red ones almost daily.  Ugh!  My husband would spank him, talk with him about behavior, and he just kept bringing home those darn red cards.  That is what proved to us that spanking is no deterrent and cannot change behavior.   We all cried a lot during that time.  <br/>
<br/>
This is the teacher that pushed us to have him tested for ADHD and to medicate him for her class.  That was the straw that broke this camel&#39;s back!   That is when I started researching ADHD and found homeschooling.  Hallelujah!!  We had another option!  Not one person had mentioned it to me before.  My reading about homeschooling opened our minds and hearts to even more solutions to our parenting issues than any of the other &#39;regular&#39; parenting books had offered.  <br/>
<br/>
He remembers the spankings, the constant harrassment from this teacher, and the continual pleadings from us to try harder to behave.  He was only 5.  A boy.  Shouldn&#39;t he behave like a little boy??  We have told him that we continue to learn about the world right along with him and we did the best we knew at the time.  His self esteeem is just now returning and he is so excited about this journey we are on now.  He is surrounded by those who love and care for him and have learned better ways to parent.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that there needs to be more information about alternate ways to raise your children from the norm.  I did not go to La Leche League meetings so I missed out on the information they could have provided.  I am a voracious reader and devoured any parenting book I could find..........almost.  I didn&#39;t know to look for _The Continuum Concept_, or _The Natural Parent_, or the unschooling books.  Ignorance is not bliss in this instance.   I am not sure how to &quot;get the word out&quot; to other parents who might not realize there are other options (like we didn&#39;t).  I do know that my friends and family somewhat understand our new philosophy so we are sharing books and advice with them when asked.  It&#39;s the people who don&#39;t know any different and might not have a friend or relative to offer alternative views that worry me.  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good question, about results.<br/>
<br/>
A family in which a child has never been spanked will probably have better <br/>
results than I have just for having a child who has never ever had terror in <br/>
his eyes or flinched away from his mom when she moved her hand.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Holly came I was a lot calmer (probably because I was nearly 40; <br/>
seriously).  If I had had three in my late 20&#39;s or early 30&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
done as well as I did being older.  Being older wasn&#39;t the ONLY factor, but I <br/>
had had more time to work out some of my own childhood stuff and resort it <br/>
into &quot;not really necessary&quot; and &quot;the best she could do&quot; and &quot;lazy BS which <br/>
was NOT the best she could do&quot; and that helped me see my own decision making <br/>
better where it concerned how to be with children.<br/>

Just a thought...but what about putting notes on bulletin boards at grocery <br/>
and other stores? You know, something to the effect &quot;Looking for <br/>
alternatives to public school? Try Homeschooling!&quot; &lt;g&gt; And of course one <br/>
could put bumper-stickers on their cars. Make t-shirts and sell, wear, <br/>
and/or give them away :)<br/>

have never hit him, but I have picked him up hard and put him<br/>
on a couch or chair, I have come at him screaming which is not<br/>
pleasant either (I have seen myself in a mirror). Still working<br/>
on it...the biggest for me is to not touch him, grab him by<br/>
the shoulders or pick him up to move him (he helps with this<br/>
because if I even bump him he starts saying that I hurt him and that<br/>
distracts us from the issue at hand).<br/>

It&#39;s hard to be a parent, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

the clear blue (I think).  He asked me if I ever thought he was &quot;ugly&quot; when <br/>
he got angry.  I told him that I didn&#39;t.  But then I asked him if he ever <br/>
thought I was ugly when I got angry.  He said, &quot;Sometimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Man, I just LOVE that guy!  I just love that he can tell me that!  He&#39;s a <br/>
much better mirror than the one I have hanging on the wall.  I just have to <br/>
remember to check that &quot;mirror&quot; more often!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884189122">I was telling my husband about the Christian lady here who spanks her kids <br/>
for not listenting the first time. Ou rson overheard (ears like a hawk!)and <br/>
was just totally astounded as to why people have to do that sort of thing. <br/>
He really couldn&#39;t comprehend why parents would want to do that to their <br/>
children. Knowing him, I&#39;m sure the thought is brewing and there will be a <br/>
test on this one later from him!<br/>
