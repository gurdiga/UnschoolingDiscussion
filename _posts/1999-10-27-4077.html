<div id="ygrps-yiv-499234069">Dear Stephanie, I am so sorry for what your family is going through.  A few years ago our little family went through the same thing and it is a <br/>
very scary experience.  And yes, our medications were taken as well.  Remember, at that time I was on 14 meds a day and considering that<br/>
I have severe asthma, severe chronic migraines and rheumatoid arthritis this was some very strong stuff indeed.  I am fortunate enough that<br/>
the herbal system I am on now has done away with the need for any of those medications but that doesn&#39;t change the feeling of violation we <br/>
experienced or the way we all check and double check the door before we leave and before we enter.  Nor have I quite forgotten the burning feeling <br/>
in the pit of my stomach when the first officer we dealt with reacted as if we were out of our minds (they took the Medication?) and were taking up <br/>
his time.  Fortunately, the second officer we dealt with informed us that we were the third that week in the area to experience such a thing and <br/>
that when a robbery is drug related they will almost always just take whatever drugs they can find rather than money.  <br/>
<br/>
It will get easier and you are not alone.  Jacli<br/>

&gt;Ladies,<br/>
&gt;    tonight my family&#39;s view on life was permanently altered. We send our <br/>
&gt;children to Awana on Tuesday nights. Tonight, they called to tell us that our <br/>
&gt;youngest, Tiffany, was upset and we should come and get her. We left the <br/>
&gt;house in a rush (Tiffany has Selective Mutism and she is very insecure. When <br/>
&gt;we hear she is upset, we go now!) and left the door unlocked. We went and got <br/>
&gt;all the children and picked up McDonald&#39;s on the way home. We saw that the <br/>
&gt;front screen door was open, and thought that it was odd, but not much... So <br/>
&gt;we came in and ate. Ron, my dh, went into our bedroom to take a pain <br/>
&gt;reliever, and this is where everything changed. ALL OF OUR MEDICATIONS ARE <br/>
&gt;GONE! All of Ron&#39;s pain relievers for the car accident. I am asking for <br/>
&gt;prayers for both my family and whoever has the meds. That they do not <br/>
&gt;overdose, and that we are ok with how our life goes. We are on a fixed <br/>
&gt;income, so we are not able to refill the meds until our insurance picks them <br/>
&gt;up again. I am so frustrated. I am at wit&#39;s end with this town. I know that <br/>
&gt;God is good, and that he will make everything right. It is just the horrible <br/>
&gt;feeling of being violated. Mentally. The officer is here, I need to go. <br/>
&gt;Thanks for letting me vent, too. <br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;       I think that I will move closer to the gym, that way between sets,<br/>
&gt;       I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>
