<div id="ygrps-yiv-701611556">I saw a Facebook meme yesterday that struck me as more bizarre. It seems<br/>
like it&#39;s in the same vein as this Phrases thread but it&#39;s a whole slew of<br/>
phrases that are all similarly presumptuous about the nature of children and<br/>
parenting. I couldn&#39;t find the meme again in order to quote it but it said<br/>
something like &quot;My parents were so MEAN that they made me do all this stuff<br/>
and I&#39;m glad/thankful to them now that I&#39;m an adult and a parent too... If<br/>
you had MEAN parents like I did, then post this in your status to show your<br/>
gratitude.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A search turned up the following blogpost which is a paraphrase of what I<br/>
saw on Facebook or possibly the inspiration of that meme, and it&#39;s from this<br/>

Mean Parents....<br/>
* [image: accredited home school]*As an adult I see the wisdom of my<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
The letter below is from a child much like yours who is now an adult much<br/>
like you!<br/>
<br/>
I trust you will find it encouraging and fun - - perhaps it will remind you<br/>
of your parents; perhaps it will remind you of yourselves. Either way, be<br/>
proud and know that what you are doing will have a lasting and rewarding<br/>
effect on the lives of your precious children!<br/>
*Mean Parents *<br/>
<br/>
Someday when my children are old enough to understand the logic that<br/>
motivates a parent, I will tell them, as my Mean Parents told me: I loved<br/>
you enough to ask where you were going, with whom, and what time you would<br/>
be home.<br/>
<br/>
I loved you enough to be silent and let you discover that your new best<br/>
friend was a creep. I loved you enough to stand over you for two hours while<br/>
you cleaned your room, a job that should have taken 15 minutes. I loved you<br/>
enough to let you see anger, disappointment, and tears in my eyes. Children<br/>
must learn that their parents aren&#39;t perfect. I loved you enough to let you<br/>
assume the responsibility for your actions even when the penalties were so<br/>
harsh they almost broke my heart.<br/>
But most of all, I loved you enough to say NO when I knew you would hate me<br/>
for it. Those were the most difficult battles of all. I&#39;m glad I won them,<br/>
because in the end you won, too. And someday when your children are old<br/>
enough to understand the logic that motivates parents, you will tell them.<br/>
<br/>
Were your Parents mean? I know mine were. We had the meanest mother in the<br/>
whole world! While other kids ate candy for breakfast, we had to have<br/>
cereal, eggs, and toast. When others had a Pepsi and a Twinkie for lunch, we<br/>
had to eat sandwiches. And you can guess our mother fixed us a dinner that<br/>
was different from what other kids had, too. Dad insisted on knowing where<br/>
we were at all times. You&#39;d think we were convicts in a prison. My Parents<br/>
had to know who our friends were, and what we were doing with them. My<br/>
Parents insisted that if we said we would be gone for an hour, we would be<br/>
gone for an hour or less.<br/>
<br/>
We were ashamed to admit it, but My Parents had the nerve to break the Child<br/>
Labor Laws by making us work. We had to wash the dishes, make the beds,<br/>
learn to cook, vacuum the floor, do laundry, empty the trash and all sorts<br/>
of cruel jobs. I think My Parents would lie awake at night thinking of more<br/>
things for us to do.<br/>
<br/>
My Parents always insisted on us telling the truth, the whole truth, and<br/>
nothing but the truth. By the time we were teenagers My Parents could read<br/>
our minds and had eyes in the back of her head. Then, life was really tough!<br/>
My Parents wouldn&#39;t let our friends just honk the horn when they drove up.<br/>
They had to come up to the door so My Parents could meet them. While<br/>
everyone else could date when they were 12 or 13, we had to wait until we<br/>
were 16 and then only in groups.<br/>
<br/>
Because of our mother we missed out on lots of things other kids<br/>
experienced. None of us have ever been caught shoplifting, vandalizing<br/>
other&#39;s property or ever arrested for any crime. It was all her fault. Now<br/>
that we have left home, we are all educated, honest adults. We are doing our<br/>
best to be mean parents just like my Parents were. I think that is what&#39;s<br/>
wrong with the world today. It just doesn&#39;t have enough mean Parents!<br/>

parenting, sad though it is, brings the realization of how foreign<br/>
such thinking is to me and Brian now since we&#39;ve been into<br/>
unschooling. We&#39;re hardly the poster unschooling parents and strive to<br/>
do better and better. Our baggage gets in surprise jabs like lessons<br/>
reinforcing shame and it can be challenging to feel that we can do<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s moments like reading sad parenting memes together that encourage<br/>
us through the things we have yet to learn. And it amazes me how<br/>
EVerything is a learning opportunity. So.. yes! The thinking that<br/>
produces blind acceptance of meanness to children (or anyone really)<br/>
as a human right or something is very odd to us now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-421727504">Related to this mean parents thing - Rosie is taking a college class <br/>
in &quot;Human Growth and Development.&quot; It is an online class and every <br/>
couple of days they have to post something on the class discussion <br/>
forum. She posted this the other day (I asked if I could post it here <br/>
and she said it was okay).<br/>
<br/>
The first part is the prompt from the teacher and then Rosie&#39;s response <br/>
follows:<br/>
<br/>
***Cite major differences between authoritative, authoritarian, and <br/>
permissive child-rearing styles and its effects on the child&#39;s <br/>
development. Which parenting style reflects the style used by your <br/>
parents in your upbringing? How do you feel it helped or hindered your <br/>
development? If you were a parent, which style would best fit the way <br/>
you think you would raise your children? Respond to at least two other <br/>
postings in your group.***<br/>
******************************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Authoritarian parenting, which is not an ideal choice when raising a <br/>
child, is what most people think of when they think of &quot;bad parenting.&quot; <br/>
Authoritarian parents &quot;yell, command, criticize and threaten, demanding <br/>
unquestioning obedience. If the child resists, authoritarian parents <br/>
resort to force and punishment&quot; (Berk 216). Children with authoritarian <br/>
parents do not develop able to self regulate their moods well, are often <br/>
hostile and are low in self-esteem. Authoritarian parents often employ <br/>
psychological control as well, in which their children are unable to <br/>
make any of their own decisions, and the parents make them all instead, <br/>
through manipulation, including putting down the child&#39;s decisions, or <br/>
withdrawing affection if the child disobeys. Because of this, children <br/>
of authoritarian parents have difficulty regulating their emotions, and <br/>
are often hostile or withdrawn.<br/>
<br/>
Another alternative parenting style is permissive. Though this style can <br/>
look nicer on the outside, it is as damaging to child&#39;s development as <br/>
the authoritarian parenting style. Permissive parents are removed from <br/>
their children, and are either &quot;overindulging or inattentive&quot; (Berk <br/>
216). Because of this, their children are often forced to make decisions <br/>
they are not developmentally ready to make yet. These children have no <br/>
help from their parents in making decisions such as when to go to bed, <br/>
or when or what to eat. Children that come from these types of homes <br/>
because rebellious, are overly demanding, and show a lack of follow <br/>
through on difficult projects.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of the above parenting styles promote healthy development. A <br/>
third option, authoritative child rearing, is thought by most to be the <br/>
ideal parenting style. Authoritative parents are kind, loving and <br/>
conscientious of their child&#39;s wants and needs. They form a secure <br/>
attachment with their child, and pay attention to what their child is <br/>
feeling. However, they are not permissive, in that they exercise healthy <br/>
control. They tell their children what kinds of behavior is expected of <br/>
them, both at home and out of the house, and if the child disobeys, they <br/>
use techniques such as time outs or loss of privileges to punish them, <br/>
instead of yelling or physical punishment. Children of authoritative <br/>
parents grow up independent, with high self-esteem, and a strong <br/>
connection to their parents. They are positive and able to work through <br/>
tasks that a child raised by either authoritarian or permissive parents <br/>
might give up on quickly.<br/>
<br/>
My childhood was unusual, and does not fit well into any category. If I <br/>
was going to choose one, I would go with authoritative. My parents were <br/>
supportive, warm, loving and always there for me. They helped me to be <br/>
independent and autonomous. They allowed me from a very young age to <br/>
make decisions about every aspect of my life, but did not leave me alone <br/>
to fend for myself. They were always there to help and advise. This is <br/>
still how our relationship is today, and I am nineteen years old. I have <br/>
the freedom to make my own choices, but a close bond with both my <br/>
parents, so I can ask for assistance or counsel if I need it.<br/>
<br/>

What a wonderful response Rosie wrote! (and such good grammar from someone who was never &quot;taught&quot; the rules &lt;said facetiously&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to offer Rosie a comment, though. A nice little rhetorical device she may find helpful if she continues choosing to write academic papers is the phrase:<br/>

&quot;According to....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the case of this prompt, where she may not feel that Berk is the definitive authority on parenting types, adding that little precursor can be useful.<br/>

More recent views have added another &quot;axis&quot; of attention and care, which is a little better, but its still a sort of two-dimensional way of describing parenting. Its handy for textbooks and magazine articles, though, you can show a nice, neat graph and say &quot;parents in the shaded area are good parents&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;There is no <br/>
&gt; frame of reference to hang the way we parent onto.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s no reference because the parenting &quot;experts&quot; can only describe what the vast majority of people do, and for most people &quot;respecting children&quot; means respecting their potential as future adults. So its &quot;respectful&quot; to hurt them a little, bully them a little, force them a little as long as its not &quot;too much&quot; and is always &quot;for their own (future adult) good&quot;. There&#39;s no conceptual reference for most adults to see chidlren as people (not innocents-or-monsters but actual people with thoughts and feelings and hopes and dreams). I&#39;ve had people irl say to me &quot;wow, you mean something Really Different by &quot;respect&quot; than other parents&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;There should be a <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To some extent, that&#39;s what attachment parenting sets out to do - the trouble is the frame of reference for most parents is still focused on producing better adults. That&#39;s why its so easy for attachment parents (and people who &quot;unschool from birth&quot;) to slide into the conveniently shaded area on the chart. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s essay, &quot;Rejecting a Pre-Packaged Life&quot;:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/joy">http://sandradodd.com/joy</a><br/>
gets into that to some extent, describing the difference between happiness and joy. She comments: &quot;Part of the pre-packaged life Americans are issued is the idea that happiness comes after...&quot; and lists college and home-ownership, but the sentiment is summed up well in that phrase. Happiness comes &quot;after&quot; and the goal of parenting is to get kids to &quot;after&quot; - to adulthood, however its defined. <br/>

Anyway, Jenny wrote: That&#39;s always been a bit <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; frustrating when talking to other parents that don&#39;t unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It really is challenging trying to describe one paradigm to someone looking at life through the lens of another. It helps me to step back from an expectation of a specific outcome - to apply unschooling principles to other realtionships, essentially. It won&#39;t help my relationships with friends or extended family to have an agenda of making them into better people or even just &quot;getting&quot; them to understand. That&#39;s part of the paradox of unschooling, too - that by focusing on bringing more joy or peace or warmth to the moment, the relationship improves and there&#39;s better communication and understanding in general. <br/>
<br/>
So when people just want to talk about parenting and not be deluged with a new paradigm, I&#39;ll stick to conventional language for the most part and practice artful silence where appropriate. People who know me get to See that I mean something different by that language and can decide if they want to learn more about it or not. On a list like this, where people can&#39;t see the way I really interact with my family, I&#39;m much more careful with my words!<br/>

night at our house.  She&#39;s very conventional in her parenting.  I had to assure <br/>
her repeatedly that it really was okay with me that her kid was here and that it <br/>
was okay that I had a house full of kids and that if it wasn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
them be here.  She didn&#39;t seem to believe me, so I finally said, &quot;I like having <br/>
all the kids here because then I always know where my daughter is and what she&#39;s <br/>
doing.&quot;  THAT she got!<br/>
<br/>
Even though it&#39;s true that I always know where she is and what she&#39;s doing, at <br/>
least, almost always, it&#39;s not because I butt my nose into her life.  She shares <br/>
with me and likes to be at home with her friends all around her because she <br/>
likes her family and her home!<br/>
