having the best time. I spent at least an hour looking at odds and ends and <br/>
bought a few things that I am thrilled with. Don&#39;t take much to make me <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-811152047">Nothing so grand, simply the death of small town America :-}  I first<br/>
became aware when my sister quit her job (in grand style, too, I might add<br/>
&lt;g&gt; but that is another story) at Wal-Mart.  There plan for your town (if<br/>
you are small town America) is rape and run.  When they find a suitable<br/>
small town they do the democraphics (do you have a poor enough community<br/>
that you spend beyond your income and will buy anything if you think it is<br/>
a great price), then they send in the shoppers to price check the<br/>
competition (video stores, fabric stores, etc.).  They look for land that<br/>
is in a redevelopment zone and convince local government that redevelopment<br/>
dollars should be spent with them so that they can bring in $$$$ in tax<br/>
revenues (folks only have so much to spend, so how are they going to bring<br/>
in more tax dollars??).  They also look for an &quot;economically depressed&quot;<br/>
area so they can get the employee tax benefits.  When they build, they<br/>
bring in their own people (no local hiring except in lowest paying jobs). <br/>
They advertise pie in the sky jobs but no management positions go local<br/>
(not even assistant department heads).  They begin all pricing below what<br/>
the &quot;competition&quot; is charging even if they have to sell at a loss.  The<br/>
great jobs they bring in &quot;with benefits and retirement&quot; are for the<br/>
full-time positions only (which aren&#39;t for the local folks) and all of<br/>
those great jobs for locals suddenly become part-time within 6 months to 1<br/>
year.  The redevelopment and economically depressed benefits that they reap<br/>
means that they don&#39;t pass on the great sales tax benefits to the local<br/>
government.  That comes right back to them, so it is either a draw or a<br/>
loss for the local community.<br/>
<br/>
When doing purchasing, they purchase with an &quot;over or under&quot; clause so that<br/>
they get the price break which translates to if I order 10 M units and you<br/>
are only able to ship 9.8 M, that is o.k. or I will take the 10.6 M that<br/>
you end up shipping.  Now, that means, when you see the add for the $99<br/>
t.v., don&#39;t hold your breath because you aren&#39;t going to get a rain check. <br/>
You see, that was one that ended up on the &quot;under&quot; side of an order so each<br/>
store only got 6.  But they got you in the store and stats show that you<br/>
will spend at least $25 to $50 anyway once you are there.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on all day<br/>

I can relate to this so well. I have 6 boys and the middle ones are 16,17,19 <br/>
so I was unable to go far for years. I used to be so jealous of the women who <br/>
could sit at the pool and read magazines, I spent years in the baby pool, (My <br/>
youngest are now 8&11). I remember my mil telling me about the little coffee <br/>
shops in the book stores.<br/>
I wanted to go so bad. Today I love it. <br/>
    What blows my mind is my oldest son called last Saturday to ask me to <br/>
baby-sit<br/>
(newborn and 2yro) so they could go next door to watch the ballgame. My dh <br/>
and I still do not go out often because we have young kids. Where did I go <br/>
wrong? By the way, I said no. I look forward to my weekends. <br/>
    We did go out this evening and our youngest ACCIDENTALLY broke off the <br/>
refrigerator door. Dh is down there now after a trip to Meijers for a part to <br/>
try to fix it.&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

&gt; Well, that was interesting.  I leave the computer and come back and what I<br/>
&gt; had sitting here on ye ol&#39; desk top had gone poof.  The cyber-boogers are<br/>
&gt; at it again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At any rate, here is what I had typed and the finish would have been that<br/>
&gt; there are a number of good sites and some books writen by former employees<br/>
&gt; and competitors for those that are really interested, I can send<br/>
&gt; suggestions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And, as to the Gap and Old Navy, they have joined Hurowitz (Maxxam) in<br/>
&gt; clear cutting and raping the land.  In fact, are working hand in glove<br/>
here<br/>
&gt; in CA.  It is a real joy to get to wonder which town will be buried under<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; mud slide this year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lynda<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nothing so grand, simply the death of small town America :-}  I first<br/>
&gt; became aware when my sister quit her job (in grand style, too, I might add<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt; but that is another story) at Wal-Mart.  There plan for your town (if<br/>
&gt; you are small town America) is rape and run.  When they find a suitable<br/>
&gt; small town they do the democraphics (do you have a poor enough community<br/>
&gt; that you spend beyond your income and will buy anything if you think it is<br/>
&gt; a great price), then they send in the shoppers to price check the<br/>
&gt; competition (video stores, fabric stores, etc.).  They look for land that<br/>
&gt; is in a redevelopment zone and convince local government that<br/>
redevelopment<br/>
&gt; dollars should be spent with them so that they can bring in $$$$ in tax<br/>
&gt; revenues (folks only have so much to spend, so how are they going to bring<br/>
&gt; in more tax dollars??).  They also look for an &quot;economically depressed&quot;<br/>
&gt; area so they can get the employee tax benefits.  When they build, they<br/>
&gt; bring in their own people (no local hiring except in lowest paying jobs).<br/>
&gt; They advertise pie in the sky jobs but no management positions go local<br/>
&gt; (not even assistant department heads).  They begin all pricing below what<br/>
&gt; the &quot;competition&quot; is charging even if they have to sell at a loss.  The<br/>
&gt; great jobs they bring in &quot;with benefits and retirement&quot; are for the<br/>
&gt; full-time positions only (which aren&#39;t for the local folks) and all of<br/>
&gt; those great jobs for locals suddenly become part-time within 6 months to 1<br/>
&gt; year.  The redevelopment and economically depressed benefits that they<br/>

&gt; government.  That comes right back to them, so it is either a draw or a<br/>
&gt; loss for the local community.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When doing purchasing, they purchase with an &quot;over or under&quot; clause so<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; they get the price break which translates to if I order 10 M units and you<br/>
&gt; are only able to ship 9.8 M, that is o.k. or I will take the 10.6 M that<br/>
&gt; you end up shipping.  Now, that means, when you see the add for the $99<br/>
&gt; t.v., don&#39;t hold your breath because you aren&#39;t going to get a rain check.<br/>
&gt; You see, that was one that ended up on the &quot;under&quot; side of an order so<br/>
each<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How do you make soap again?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh well, I guess that I will not have a septic system, so the soap<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only<br/>

by Bill Quinn.  The rest of my books I have loaned to various people and,<br/>
as usual, am having a hard time getting them back.  At any rate, this is a<br/>
good place to start.  <br/>
