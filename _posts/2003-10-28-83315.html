<div id="ygrps-yiv-334773801">I think it&#39;s another one of those things kids should be left to figure out on their own what they think of it.  I remember when I was 15 years old and my great uncle (my grandmother&#39;s youngest brother) was moving from California to SC.  On his way there, he stopped at our house in Texas and gave us a bunch of his personal belongings.  It wasn&#39;t until after he left, that our parents officially told us that he was gay, HiV+, and going to live with my grandmother until he died.  My brothers and I had already figured out the gay part and decided that was OK with us.  I think that if my parents had said something ahead of time to &quot;warn&quot; us or even to tell us what they think of gay people, then our own original opinions would have been severely altered.<br/>

Hi, Kathryn --<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to spin this in a different and still sarcastic direction. <br/>
Given how effective school can be in making kids hate poetry and <br/>
mathematics, I think a really lengthy sex ed curriculum with lots of <br/>
drill and worksheets could actually suppress sexual desire in teenagers. <br/>
&lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
The kind of humor Monty Python makes of church wouldn&#39;t be nearly funny here, <br/>
but here people aren&#39;t forced by school to go to services, pray and sing <br/>
hymns.  (Well some schools, but parents pay extra for that.)<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, somone from England quoted my whole long train station <br/>
analogy, and added one sarcastic line.  I don&#39;t think the post will be approved; it&#39;s <br/>
in the pending file.  But if someone in England doesn&#39;t believe such <br/>
Christianity exists, that&#39;s because most of it is in the SE U.S.  Not all, <br/>
unfortunately.  But there it is rampant and they homeschool.  And so Phyllis Schafly can <br/>
imagine or believe that all homeschoolers are that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope the post doesn&#39;t make it in, because the people on digest would get my <br/>
whole train analogy twice, but to the person who thought this was a good <br/>
response:  &quot;Yup.  That sums up all the Christians I ever met.  Cos we all know that<br/>
<br/>
they&#39;re all the same,&quot;   please  read the group&#39;s guidelines about lenghths <br/>
of quotes and while you&#39;re out there, read some more of Phyllis Schafly and <br/>
company.  They&#39;re the people I was directly discussing, AND I qualified my <br/>
statements, AND insulting me won&#39;t make them go away.  Stabbing me to death on <br/>
international live satellite TV and saying &quot;NOW she will shut up about what she <br/>
thinks fundamentalist Christians believe&quot; would not make them go away.<br/>

That would be my good friend (not really) and local pastor/disbarred <br/>
lawyer/homophobe. He is such a great and wonderful man, praise his name. He set out a <br/>
few years ago to educate the poor uneducated citizens of my little town, on <br/>
the dangers of everything and anything not heterosexual. That includes anyone <br/>
who is against him. The police department, most of the mayors, the Marine Corps, <br/>
most of the Catholic priests, many pastors of other religions, various <br/>
citizens... All of them Whoring FAGS Who will burn in HELL! Matthew Shepard got his <br/>
just rewards for hitting on those poor unsuspecting cowboys up in Wyoming. <br/>
That is just one of the many things Fred has taught us here in Topeka. UGH! <br/>
<br/>
For a while some stupid people tried to ban him from protesting, laws were <br/>
passed, he and his gaggle of family/lawyers shot every one of them down. <br/>
Although I do think there is something about not protesting within 50 feet of a <br/>
church while services are being held. The best thing ole Fred has done is harden <br/>
our town against injustices of any kind. People don&#39;t even see him anymore. For <br/>
a few years people would protest against him, and he even had police escorts <br/>
for a time, complete with a bullet proof vest. I think he might still wear that <br/>
when he goes out of town, but here in Topeka, no one cares anymore and that <br/>
is just so sad. He used to get death threats, he might still, but not from <br/>
people here, we just don&#39;t care. And to me, that is just as bad as his neon signs <br/>
depicting acts of sodomy and all the biblical quotes taken so far out of <br/>
context to help him connect god somehow to his lies. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the golden city of Topeka; while you are here visit the world <br/>
famous Topeka Zoo, tour Ward Mead Park, take in a Scarecrows game, and go gawk at <br/>
the famous preacher who stands on street corners making the world safe from <br/>
homosexuals for all god fearing folk. <br/>

<br/>
Makes me think of a funny story from my childhood.<br/>
<br/>
In middle school I was in a circle of friends who were kids of the<br/>
university teachers, vs being townies.  We repeatedly got called &quot;lesbian<br/>
pinko commies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, we figured, being commies wasn&#39;t that big a deal.<br/>
<br/>
As for being lesbians, if the choice was the townie boys calling us names or<br/>
each other.....not a tough choice.  It didn&#39;t hurt that there was me--curvy<br/>
and dark, Tanya--who looked like Daryl Hannah, Barbie--preppy and adorable,<br/>
and Joy--think a more ethinic Sarah Jessica Parker.  Or the pig farmers son.<br/>
Like I said, not a tough choice.<br/>

Now that I go back and re-read ....you said &quot;Comparing Schlafly&#39;s comments to what most of the people on this group think is a waste.&quot;  I mistakenly read that to mean my story was a &quot;waste&quot; and I did not understand why.  And my next post was saying that if there was someone on this list who thought like her and then read what I wrote (or anyone else) and subsequently challenged their own thinking on the subject.....then how was that a &quot;waste&quot;?<br/>
I wasn&#39;t comparing her comments at all, just sharing a story and my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
From what I did read of hers, I think the lady&#39;s a fruitcake. <br/>

  &lt;&lt; But that&#39;s assuming that none of us think like her.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  People who think like her won&#39;t be unschoolers.<br/>
  She thinks games and discussion are a waste of &quot;math time.&quot;<br/>
  She thinks people can&#39;t learn to read without phonics lessons.<br/>
<br/>
  If you don&#39;t like homosexuality, fine.  That has nothing to do with <br/>
  unschooling directly, but math and reading do.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;  Is it possible for any unschoolers out there to be radical in thought in <br/>
  most ways of their lives except regarding homosexuality?  Possibly so. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Probably so, but her article wasn&#39;t about homosexuality.  It was about <br/>
  conservative fundamentalist Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;Angela McGinn - who admits that she&#39;s never heard of Phyllis what&#39;s-her-name <br/>
  until now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If you&#39;re interested in her writings, they&#39;re out there. <br/>
  You can read them for hours, weeks.<br/>
  And after that, come back and let us know if you still want to defend her.    <br/>
  But please don&#39;t defend things/movements/political activists you&#39;re admi<br/>
  ttedly unfamiliar with.<br/>
