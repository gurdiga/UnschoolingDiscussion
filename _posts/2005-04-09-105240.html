I&#39;m sure  this has been beaten to death. <br/>
<br/>

That was about socialization, but every possible topic comes back again and  <br/>
again, and that&#39;s okay.  Every day is the first day for some people, and  it&#39;s <br/>
all new again for them.  But a really cool thing is that the quality  and <br/>
availability of information and ideas has gotten better over  the years.  When I <br/>
first started unschooling I had to wait two months for  an issue of Growing <br/>
WIthout Schooling.  It was three or four month-old  writing, and it was never <br/>
NEARLY long enough.  I&#39;d read every single  bit.  <br/>
 <br/>
I wasn&#39;t the only one.  <br/>
 <br/>
Then there were newsgroups and e-mail, and that helped.<br/>
 <br/>
And then there were message boards and chat rooms, and eventually  websites.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know what will be along for people to get information on  <br/>
socialization in another three or five years, but it will be even better than  now.  And <br/>
still ten years from now there will be people just starting to  think about <br/>
homeschooling and the horse will still be new and scary.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
