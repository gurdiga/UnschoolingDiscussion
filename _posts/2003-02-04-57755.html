<div id="ygrps-yiv-3227026">Has anyone see the TV show about a boy<br/>
trying to be good in basketball?<br/>
<br/>
I may have caught it on MTV, this weekend.<br/>
What made me even stop at MTV, was the<br/>
way this coach was talking to this boy.<br/>
<br/>
He ended up having to carry this basketball<br/>
to every class that he had. I remember a lot of<br/>
the things that the boys in my high school had to<br/>
endure just to play sports. I won&#39;t think of having<br/>
my two sons subjected to such hogwash. <br/>
<br/>
We think we have problems with our daughters<br/>
ever entertaining the thoughts of bulimia, I remember<br/>
a guy in high school doing everything possible regarding<br/>
his weight to be able to compete in wrestling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do not agree what messages are sent to our boys,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen it, but the really annoying thing is that the kind of<br/>
coaching you described doesn&#39;t even work well.  My husband coaches soccer<br/>
and fastball, and he figured out right away that a positive attitude works<br/>
way better.  Our guys have played against teams coached like on the show.<br/>
You can just see the shoulders start to slump on those kids when the coach<br/>
picks on them.  By the end of the game, a whole team that was playing<br/>
relative well to start will be performing terribly.<br/>
