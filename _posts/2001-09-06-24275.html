&lt;&lt; There are GOOD choices, too.<br/>
 <br/>
 Several posters (I lost count) have now said, &quot;I would rather yell than...&quot;<br/>
 and then listed something else that&#39;s bad. We COULD be saying, &quot;Rather than<br/>
 yell, I would like to...&quot; and list ways that are GOOD for communicating to<br/>
 people, including our children.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   Pam, I believe in my case at least I am not coming across as I wish to be <br/>
heard. I believe in Positive Discipline ala Barbara Coloroso, Jane Nelson, <br/>
and Mary Sheedy Kurchinka(Raising Your Spirited Child). What I was saying is <br/>
I am trying my hardest to be a Zen mommy but I do at times lose it and yell. <br/>
Zoe also yells. I believe it is in us but we can change and want to.I am not <br/>
condoning yelling at my child in anger,I hate when I do it but I admit to <br/>
doing it. I do however feel it is better than what I grew up w/ which was <br/>
shaming and blaming and name calling. So I am at least doing better than the <br/>
generation before me. <br/>
<br/>
  Am I understood yet? Or do you still think I am a person to steer clear of?<br/>
<br/>
  One other thing. I do prefer my style of yelling and screaming yet having <br/>
it over and done w/ than my dh&#39;s silence and avoidance technique that can <br/>
last a day. Makes me feel my life as I know it is over. Again this stems from <br/>
my history and coping skills. Hopefully over the years we will find the best <br/>
way to argue for us and be comfortable w/ it. It is never easy combining <br/>
styles is it? ;o)<br/>

 We&#39;ve owned a few TB mares that we crossed with quarter horses.<br/>
 <br/>
 We did have one gelding that had been raced.  We called him Screwy Lewy!<br/>
 That goofy horse would still &quot;hear&quot; the bell on the starting gate and up<br/>
 would go his head and away he&#39;d go!  Took a real &quot;expert&quot; to ride him<br/>
 because you never knew when he&#39;d &quot;hear&quot; that bell &lt;g&gt;<br/>

   Yes, poor TB race horses have a tough road after that life. My mother was <br/>
doing the foaling for a trainer but after a few years said no more. She cared <br/>
way more than the owners and couldn&#39;t take it anymore.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Unless you really like arguing, that is. :-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

tried to get into the vacs issue w/ me and I could tell right away she <br/>
thought she was right and I was oh so wrong. I simply told her we would have <br/>
to agree to disagree b/c we would never see eye to eye on the issue. Same w/ <br/>
circ and her opinion. My mother is so dominant in arguing style I am not <br/>
strong enough to argue my points. I get lost.<br/>
