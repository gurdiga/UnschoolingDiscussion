&lt;&lt;  To believe it is just for Jews and<br/>
<br/>
Christians to run this nation is to turn your back on the very document that<br/>
<br/>
begins with &quot;We The People.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since when did they let Jews run anything??<br/>
<br/>
Some made a BIG deal about the first Jewish vice-presidential candidate.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still run by and for Christians.  It is changing, slowly.  Sometimes <br/>
there will be one step back.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly asks me &quot;what do I say if people ask what religion I am?&quot;  I say <br/>
&quot;Why do they want to know?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the answer IS &quot;Christian&quot; for us.  If the person asking is Jewish, <br/>
or Moslem, we&#39;re Christian.  If someone from Madagascar asks where I live, I <br/>
live in the U.S.   <br/>
<br/>
If someone who&#39;s Christian is asking, we&#39;re agnostic.  If their purpose is to <br/>
know what denomination, we are none.  That&#39;s like someone in Albuquerque <br/>
asking where I live.  I live near Juan Tabo and Candelaria.  It&#39;s relative to <br/>
their position, and the information they need. <br/>
<br/>
If their purpose is to ask whether we&#39;re born again so they know whether to <br/>
proselytize or not, we&#39;re agnostic.  But if the question is what is your <br/>
family, culturally and historically, then in that context we&#39;re Christian.<br/>
