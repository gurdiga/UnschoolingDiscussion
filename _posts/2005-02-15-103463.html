 </span></blockquote>My 13 yo daughter has always had a passion for creative writing and drawing.<br/>
But up until she was 11 or so she told me how much she hated writing --<br/>
sometimes meaning handwriting, sometimes meaning getting thoughts out of her<br/>
head onto paper -- because it wasn&#39;t effortless. She went to school for 2<br/>
months of 2nd grade and the looks of her handwriting improved but it didn&#39;t<br/>
become easier. And when she stopped school, her handwriting reverted to what<br/>
it was. At 9 she may have even been still reversing some letters. But even<br/>
though she hated writing she did (still does) a lot of it.<br/>
<br/>
But around 11 or so writing and typing started becoming easier and at 13 it<br/>
seems effortless. At least she hasn&#39;t mentioned any difficulties for quite<br/>
some time. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to be able to tell your daughter that practice will help, but for<br/>
my daughter who did do a *lot* of writing the thing that helped the most was<br/>
time. Her brain needed to mature and all the practice in the world wasn&#39;t<br/>
going to speed that up.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The kids for whom writing comes easily won&#39;t be shy about writing in front<br/>
of her.<br/>
<br/>
But the kids who can&#39;t write, who get humiliated in class because they<br/>
can&#39;t, who hate writing because they&#39;ve been forced to write are not going<br/>
to write around her!<br/>
<br/>
Analogies usually don&#39;t work well on younger kids but you could try! 9 mo<br/>
kids usually can&#39;t walk. But if there were a room of 20 9 mo and you were<br/>
standing in the hall and one walked out, you might think, &quot;Wow, 9 mo kids<br/>
can walk!&quot; But that wouldn&#39;t be a true picture of what 9 mo can do. You&#39;d<br/>
only be seeing the exceptional one, not the other 19 who were in there<br/>
sitting on their butts or crawling around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923645656">I think it is ridiculous to diagnose a 9 year old with a writing disorder.  They are still developing physically.  To use Joyce&#39;s example, that is like saying that a 7 month old baby has a &quot;walking disorder&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If she has ideas (stories, poems, essays) that she wants to get out of her head and recorded somehow, there are plenty of options.  Tape recorders, typing, someone else writing it down for her (I have typed up things my kids have said into a tape recorder), voice recording mp3 players, Sound Recorder (look under accesories in your computer&#39;s program files - this one is a blast!), Kid Pix.<br/>
<br/>
If someone else is telling her she must be writing, they are wrong.<br/>

<br/>
I have vivid memories of being her age.  I was the best writer in my class, <br/>
and my greatest achievement was a four or five page story.   Some kids couldn&#39;t <br/>
construct a sentence.     She&#39;s only nine, and I think you&#39;re encouraging her <br/>
to expect too much of herself.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re asking her to write, stop asking her to.  It will come later.  <br/>
If she wants to write, get her on the computer and forget handwriting for now.<br/>

<br/>
Are those friends in school?  Are they writing anything real, or just <br/>
homework?  Will they still want to read and write in ten years?  <br/>
<br/>
Remind her of the things she can do better than her younger friends can.  <br/>
Take her off the assembly line.  Take her out of sight of the assembly line.  <br/>
It&#39;s a facade anyway, as only a small percentage of kids are &quot;at grade level&quot; and <br/>
most are not.<br/>

<br/>
Remove the hurdle, get off the course, don&#39;t even go the direction of the <br/>
hurdle.  Cross through the fence and go out into the world.<br/>
<br/>
Hurdles are unnatural, fake little fences put in a race course for horses or <br/>
people to jump over.  To be thinking in terms of &quot;hurdles&quot; is not the <br/>
direction you need to go for natural learning to take hold in your lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675805009">Hi Meg<br/>
<br/>
We have a ten year old girl who doesn&#39;t read yet (I almost <br/>
wrote &quot;Still not reading&quot; but that is SO school mentality, and I&#39;m <br/>
working on erasing that from my thoughts)...she doesn&#39;t read yet, and <br/>
you should see her pack a suitcase, or find any item in any spot in <br/>
the house. Her spatial sense is lightyears ahead of MY linear, two <br/>
dimensional brain. She also listens to books on tape endlessly, is <br/>
hankering for guitar lessons (which she will start, this year) and <br/>
has an amazing way with numbers. <br/>
<br/>
And...her younger friends, a lot of them can read and write, but she <br/>
is accepting of herself. She even told a Sunday school group, when <br/>
introducing herself, that she has dyslexia. <br/>
<br/>
start noticing your girl&#39;s strengths, and remind her of them if she <br/>
gets frustrated. And let time pass. I&#39;m confident that she will &quot;get <br/>
it&quot; and when she does, she&#39;s gonna blow you away. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard,though, isn&#39;t it? Hard to shake that school mentality that <br/>
wants our kids to be &quot;caught up&quot; with the other kids. Well, I betcha <br/>
that your girl is leagues ahead of her reading peers, in some way or <br/>
in many ways, most likely.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>
 p.s. a book suggestion: anything about different minds/learning <br/>
styles. I&#39;m reading Dr. Mel Levine right now, but there are others <br/>
out there. Also, read something about simply observing your children. <br/>
John Holt is the author I have read, and he&#39;s got some kindly, <br/>
avuncular advice about letting them be and simply observing them, not <br/>
worrying about where they are or are not in the spectrum of <br/>
abilities. <br/>
<br/>
The book I read about dyslexia, that made a difference for myself and <br/>
my girl &quot;The Gift of Dyslexia&quot; can&#39;t remember the author. But it&#39;s a <br/>
good un. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822971159">I just checked out a book from the library last night called, &quot;The Gift <br/>
of Dyslexia&quot; by Ronald D. Davis.  I&#39;ve read about 2/3 of it, and so far <br/>
like a lot of what he is saying.  It seems to go along with the thread <br/>
we had on here last week.  Of course, his assumption is that the kids <br/>
are being forced to read by age 6 in school, and talks about how <br/>
letting kids wait until 11 or so will help.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things he does in the book is to explain what is happening <br/>
to a dyslexic while reading - they are seeing pictures as they read, <br/>
and when they come to certain words (a little over 200 of them, that he <br/>
calls Key Triggers for Disorientation - words that don&#39;t easily have a <br/>
picture associated with them), they become disoriented and their <br/>
picture that they&#39;ve been building fails.  So, in his example, &quot;The <br/>
brown horse jumped over the stone fence and ran through the pasture&quot;, <br/>
the reader starts out seeing a brown blob that turns into a horse, then <br/>
jumps in  the air, then sees a stone that turns into a fence.  At the <br/>
&quot;and&quot; the picture can disappear, then the reader could see himself <br/>
running, then confused, sees something being thrown, then a large piece <br/>
of grass.  Very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he also addresses (in a small way) dysgraphia and dyscalculia.<br/>
<br/>
It could help, and probably won&#39;t hurt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522229291">Hi Joni<br/>
<br/>
I read this book, too, when I began to suspect that my 10 y.o. has <br/>
dyslexia. It was eye opening for me, both his own story (He figured <br/>
out what the spaces between words were, as an adult. Went straight <br/>
from being a slow/non-reader, to checking out Treasure Island and <br/>
reading it in three hours, or some such) and his assertion that <br/>
dyslexics see three dimensionally, all the time. This works fine, <br/>
when a person recognizes a lump of fur in the corner as a kitten, but <br/>
it throws them off when they are confronted with two dimensional <br/>
symbols. What *is* that A on the page? What does its backside look <br/>
like? and their brains are trying to see a third dimension in a two <br/>
dimensional figure.<br/>
<br/>
My Katie definitely thinks in pictures. She&#39;s always making maps of <br/>
her room, with arrows pointing to where she wants to move the desk. <br/>
If she wants to grasp the ideas in something written, she asks me to <br/>
draw pictures of it, and then she gets it immediately.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad I checked back in here. It&#39;s reminded me that I wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to worry about Katie&#39;s late-reading.<br/>
<br/>

Hi, Meg --<br/>
<br/>
I posted after Xmas that my almost 11 year old boy didn&#39;t write at<br/>
all.  (And I mean barely wrote his name.  Wrote maybe less than a<br/>
dozen words all year.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I had a re-affirming moment that I wanted to share with the list<br/>
because it was such an unschooling cliche.  &lt;smile&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What did he want to write?  A 100 word character description for a<br/>
warrior character for the roleplaying game Heroquest!<br/>
<br/>
He wrote ten times more than he had written in one sitting before, and<br/>
he asked for help with spelling and (some) letter orientation without<br/>
feeling self-conscious.  I feel better.  (I had been concerned that he<br/>
physically couldn&#39;t write, but now I see that he, as they say, &quot;can if<br/>
he wants to&quot;.  Something that I was having a hard time taking on<br/>
faith.)<br/>
<br/>
Your mileage may vary.  Every kid is different.  My husband has very<br/>
tortured handwriting and may have dysgraphia, although in college he<br/>
could type complete term papers in one draft, pure stream of<br/>
consciousness.  Well written papers, even.  (This was before word<br/>
processors!)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I think I can see the influence of Calvin and Hobbes in my kids<br/>
writing style. &lt;g&gt;  Which I probably could have predicted, had I been<br/>
thinking clearly</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890489055">Can we talk about &quot;scaffolding&quot; (as PamS sometimes has) as a technique <br/>
for supporting learning in unschooling families?  I think I might be <br/>
ready to &quot;get it&quot; now. &lt;g&gt;  I think before I was too much of a knee-jerk <br/>
Rousseauvian and that interfered with my ability to really embrace the <br/>
idea.  A little more scaffolding might be just what I need around here...<br/>

Nope, in fact, it was SHE who approached ME and asked ME to help her write better, so I&#39;m just following her lead.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t take it personally.  I&#39;ve never met you or your daughter and have no idea what writing experiences or lack of them your daughter has had.  I was responding to a post with some ideas that might help.  If they don&#39;t seem like ideas that would work for you, just delete them.<br/>
<br/>
If you read my post again you might notice that I said &quot;IF&quot; &quot;If someone else is telling her she must be writing, they are wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I stand by my belief that age 9 is too young to diagnose with a writing disorder, if there even is such a thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Meg - it was just one possible assumption. I think the post said, &quot;IF <br/>
someone is telling her she should be writing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People posting can always correct mistaken assumptions and we can <br/>
continue to talk about it with that information so that the discussion <br/>
can be more focused - but, there are almost certainly people out there <br/>
whose kids ARE being told they should be writing, so the other <br/>
responses might be useful for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105970710">You know if the frustration is coming from her and her own, in born need <br/>
to write things out better, there are somethings she could try.<br/>
 Sometimes those pencil grip thingees work.<br/>
It can just be caused by poor muscle condition so playing with those <br/>
koosh things might help and soft, smooshy balls. Push ups against the <br/>
wall for the lower forearms.<br/>
There is the whole &quot;body work&quot; stuff with cross-crawling that some folks <br/>
say have helped their kids...ummm &quot;Brain-Gym&quot; I think its called.<br/>

&gt; My almost 9 yr old is suspected of having some form of dysgraphia.  I <br/>
&gt; wont get into the symptoms right now, but it makes writing very <br/>
&gt; difficult for her.  In fact, getting thoughts out in a reasonable <br/>
&gt; sounding manner is difficult most of the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t be worried about it except she becomes very upset that her <br/>
&gt; younger friends can read and write better than she can, it&#39;s very <br/>
&gt; apparent to her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions for helping or book suggestions?  I <br/>
&gt; want to help her over this hurdle but I feel so unqualified.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
