<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347276759">We made these today and the kids think they&#39;re really neat!  Thought <br/>
I&#39;d share them....the cupcakes would be fun for any spring party, not <br/>
just Easter.<br/>
Make your favorite cupcake recipe and frost with plain white frosting <br/>
or buttercream frosting.<br/>
Take some candy eggs (small variety) like Cadbury&#39;s or M&M&#39;s and put <br/>
2-3 in the middle. Some of the cupcakes you can top with those <br/>
Marshmallow birds (Peeps they&#39;re called).<br/>
For the &quot;nest&quot; around the edges, bake some shredded coconut in a 350 <br/>
degree oven until browned and press onto the frosting around the <br/>
edges of the birds and eggs.<br/>
They&#39;re really cute!!<br/>
Have a great day.<br/>
