<br/>
When we moved last year, I called a local box making company and found that <br/>
they have tons of &quot;defective boxes&quot; that they don&#39;t ship to their vendors. I <br/>
was willing to pay for them, but was told I could just come pick them up. So I <br/>
did. There was zero wrong with the boxes themselves. The defects were generally <br/>
labeling errors, like the company name or printing being sideways as opposed <br/>
to up or down. We also called our local grocery stores, asked for the store <br/>
manager and he notified the night crew responsible for stocking to not cut up <br/>
new boxes for a couple nights boxes. I went in and picked them up, they had <br/>
collapsed them so I could put more in the car, but they didn&#39;t cut any up. Maybe <br/>
these could be options for you????<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
Rhonda<br/>
