<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173679441">Just want to thank everyone who responded on this topic.  I guess we don&#39;t<br/>
have the same population of slugs here where I live to cause any real<br/>
problem.  BTW, we&#39;re in southeast Tennessee.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not naive enough to think that even by being a vegetarian, I&#39;m not<br/>
killing.  I know MUCH better than that.  Just choose to do my killing<br/>
selectively in my own way.  Still wear leather shoes and that&#39;s a whole<br/>
&#39;nother &quot;shabang&quot;, isn&#39;t it?  My husband, also, is not a &quot;veg-head&quot;.  So, in<br/>
short, the ethical choices we face daily are infinite.  We all have to do<br/>
what we personally think is best.  : )<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for sharing.  Even though I still think that slugs and snails<br/>
are beautiful creatures and won&#39;t kill ours, I&#39;m thankful that we don&#39;t have<br/>
the population problem that you guys must have on the west coast.  Just<br/>
hoping that you will try to kill them as humanely as possible...quick deaths<br/>
if possible.  I like the stepping on them with the shoe idea for the<br/>
quickest route...just make sure that they&#39;re really dead and not just dying<br/>
when you leave them?<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

Hindus wear leather shoes.  Water buffalo sandles.  <br/>

Cows do not live forever, even in Delhi. &lt;g&gt;</div>
