<div id="ygrps-yiv-649641502">My son and daughter decided to go flatting to gether.  They managed <br/>
to find a nice house at the other side of town.  Now before I go any <br/>
furthet I have to tell you that my son is the most honest person you <br/>
could come across - if any one else had told me this I would have <br/>
probable have said  &quot;Oh yea!&quot;<br/>
On the first night in this house as my son was falling a sleep he saw <br/>
this lady in white floating in the corner of the bedroom.  Thinking <br/>
he was dreaming he closed his eyes and opened them again - she was <br/>
still there - and was there almost every night.<br/>
Several weeks after they moved in dd was stood at the front of the <br/>
house and saw this shadow go past ds bedroom window, thinking it was <br/>
ds she shouted &#39;Hello&#39; as she went into house - no answere - so she <br/>
popped her head into room - no one there - ds was in the shower.  <br/>
This bedroom was always very cold.<br/>
ds was usually home from work first.  This day dd arrived home and as <br/>
she opened the door could here ds in kitchen as usual - but when she <br/>
went into kitchen there was no-one there.......<br/>
Needless to say they didnt stay there very long....<br/>
