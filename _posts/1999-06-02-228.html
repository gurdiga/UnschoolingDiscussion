<div id="ygrps-yiv-12703670">Hi again,<br/>
<br/>
 I would have to agree with you. My mother is having a fit about me hsing my<br/>
5 year old daughter. I don&#39;t see how she can do that, when she homeschooled<br/>
my little sister who just graduated at the WHO ceremony on May 23rd. She keeps<br/>
asking how Tara (5 yo) is going to get social interaction and saying that she<br/>
needs to be in public school. I hope you all don&#39;t mind, I forwarded some of<br/>
your horrifying stories about ps to her in hopes that she would get the hint<br/>
(still no responce from her though). Does anybody have any suggestions to get<br/>
her off my back?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I sure do wish I could shout it to the world - &quot;Everybody!  Unschool <br/>
&gt;your kids!!!&quot;  But I guess like politics, homeschooling is kind of like <br/>
&gt;a religion of its own.  There are those who agree, and those who don&#39;t, <br/>
&gt;and no one likes people pushing religion (whether spiritual in nature or <br/>
&gt;not).  There&#39;s an American lady nearby, and she hates being a mother.  <br/>
&gt;She can hardly wait for her son to be in school, and thinks that the <br/>
&gt;long school hours plus cram school plus endless hours of homework per <br/>
&gt;night is wonderful to keep her son occupied.  I wish I could tell her <br/>
&gt;about unschooling in a way that wouldn&#39;t be offensive to her.  I kind of <br/>
&gt;mentioned it once, but she got so defensive (even though all I said was <br/>
&gt;that I plan to homeschool my son, and what does she plan to do about her <br/>
&gt;son&#39;s education) that I just dropped it.  And converting my mother and <br/>
&gt;mother-in-law (MIL) seems impossible.  I hinted to my sister that my mom <br/>
&gt;was thinking about possibly homeschooling her maybe, and my mom got so <br/>
&gt;offended - now I&#39;m afraid to open her e-mails &#39;cuz most likely she&#39;ll <br/>
&gt;flame me.  Maybe I&#39;m just the offensive type.  Does anyone else feel <br/>
&gt;this way?  How do you get your family or neighbors or whatever to accept <br/>
&gt;you for who you are, and not reject you because of a difference of <br/>
&gt;beliefs?  (Even though we unschoolers are right... hehe :-))<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mom was a ps teacher and she is not for this hsing thing. But she does<br/>
see a happy kid. SHe tries to do school stuff with him and he usually<br/>
rebels and says mom say i dont have to. she really does try real school<br/>
stuff. I tell her I dont make him do the stuff she would. she is concerned<br/>
about socialization cus he is caustious and shy. well tough! and about his<br/>
intellect. I have basically said to her that I know we wont agree but i am<br/>
the parent and I have to make the best decsion i can. and suprising ly that<br/>
worked. She is sometimes still a pain but not as bothersome.<br/>
<br/>
My dad , who is living with us is supportive. he sees a wonderful happy<br/>
kid. he will do workbook stuff with isaac if he wants to and tell him<br/>
stories of what it was like when he was a boy. lots of interesting stuff.<br/>
<br/>
as far as others who say how could you do that or i never could do that. I<br/>
dont listen to those people. I am not goiing to explain my reasoning to<br/>
everyone. Isaac or I either say we homeschool and drop it. or if people ask<br/>
questions we someimes answer if they are respectful. and most of the<br/>
poeople we know are respectful.<br/>
<br/>
we only had one set of friends who were obnoxious and we are not friends<br/>
anymore.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m fairly lucky.   My family supports me.  Most of my friends support me.  <br/>
The ones WHO DO NOT, have so far kept it to themselves.  My husbands family <br/>
kinda questions this decision to homeschool.  But they live across the states <br/>
and we have limited contact with them so they arne&#39;t really an issue.<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning I was so shy about admitting we homeschooled.  Almost <br/>
finishing up our second year and I&#39;m not so shy about it&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
NOW, explaining unschooling?  Thats a whole nother ballpark.  My mom gets it <br/>
but everyone else looks at me like I&#39;m an alien for not enforcing some sort <br/>
of structure on my kids.  They look at my daughters accomplishments and say <br/>
&quot;well she is use to school, she went for 5 years&quot;.  They don&#39;t allow that she <br/>
would not be accomplishing these thigns if she was in school. GRRRRR.<br/>
<br/>
The negative ones?  I just ignore.<br/>

For these questions, you can tell her that many districts allow homeschoolers <br/>
to participate in highschool activities (sports, proms ect).  OR you can <br/>
belong to a good homeschool group that does these.  As far as college......I <br/>
have yet to hear of one who will not take homeschoolers!  <br/>

I have lost family members for being out of the ordinary (not re:<br/>
homeschooling) and have come to the conclusion that I&#39;m better off<br/>
without them. If a difference makes them not like me, they&#39;re really not<br/>
good for my life and my children. I have uncomplicated my life by not<br/>
having to deal with people who verbally condemn me. I have no problem<br/>
with those who disagree or question. Just don&#39;t condemn.<br/>

             I gave up on being accepted by anybody a few years ago. I&#39;m just <br/>
too weird. <br/>
My 14 yo daughter always tells me, &quot;You&#39;re not like other mothers&quot;. It used <br/>
to hurt my feelings, but now I just say &quot;Thanks, Angie&quot;. Seeing as how all <br/>
