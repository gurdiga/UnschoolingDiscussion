<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073377030">If you are looking to slash all your expenses by 75% then you found <br/>
the right place! This is what I read several months ago when a person <br/>

it was very interesting and decided to check it out. I am very <br/>
skeptical by nature so the first thing I did was check out the <br/>
company. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and found that the <br/>
company has had no complaints lodged against them, I also contacted<br/>
Paypal who has verified this company. They told me that they verified <br/>
the company&#39;s licenses, bank accounts and other paperwork indicating <br/>
to them that the company is legitimate. Then I started asking co-<br/>
workers and friends about this program and to my surprise 6 out of <br/>
the 10 people that I spoke with were already using this program. They <br/>
told me how pleased they were with it and how much money they had <br/>
saved and are currently saving. They told me that they have seen <br/>
numerous television programs for this. So I decided to sign up for <br/>
this program on 1/20/03. On 1/23/03 I received my complete membership <br/>
package and the fun began. Using their program and the free lifetime <br/>
membership that it includes I went to the supermarket ready to make a <br/>
killing. The cashier rang up my grocery bill and it came out to <br/>
$239.87 then I presented her with the coupons I received from this <br/>
program and I saved $223.38 - my final bill was only $16.49! The <br/>
cashier wasn&#39;t the only one shocked. Thanks Sue for sharing this <br/>
information with us!<br/>
<br/>
PS: They just put an amazing section up with electronic items at <br/>
super low costs. It&#39;s worth a look.</div>
