<div id="ygrps-yiv-819840396">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We have gone to this homeschooling camp three times, and loved it each <br/>
time.  The camp is in Southern California, near Big Bear, please see the <br/>
website listed below.  I know some people came from Arizona before.  The <br/>
food is wonderful and filling (they do vegan and vegitarian too!), the <br/>
people are great, the events are always fun, and if they aren&#39;t what you <br/>
want to do you can do something else, take a nap, or go for a walk.  <br/>
Nothing is manditory.  The swimming pool will be open as will the hot <br/>
tub (not for the kids, Lexie hates that!) The mountains are great, fresh <br/>
clean air, and great water.  The drive, from LA or OC, isn&#39;t that bad, <br/>
without traffic we can make it in about 1 hour and 45 minutes, even <br/>
going up the mountain!  Even with me now teaching school I am figuring <br/>
out a way to be there at least for part of it, with Mark being there the <br/>
entire time.  It is so worth the money!  If you have any questions, <br/>
email Caroline below.  Or I suppose you can ask me. <br/>
