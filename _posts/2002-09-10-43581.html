Peelu. &gt;&gt;<br/>

India.  They use short twigs from those trees to clean their teeth.  They <br/>
chew the end into a little bristly softness, and rub it between like a cross <br/>
between a toothpick and toothbrush (in our parlance).   I learned a lot of <br/>
everyday kind of trivia from Dev Singh, who was my boyfriend all through <br/>
college.<br/>

-=-For thousands of years (3,000+) people in India have started each day by <br/>
chewing a fresh twig of the Neem Tree. In the Middle East the Miswak or paelu <br/>
tree is similary sought after as a remarkably effective natural toothbrush. <br/>
Renowned through the ages and lauded in ancient Ayurevedic texts, the <br/>
&quot;toothbrush trees&quot; Neem and Peelu have been prized for their naturally <br/>
purifying and tooth-whitening properties. Toothpaste with this and other <br/>
&quot;natural&quot; ingredients can usually be found in your natural food store. Check <br/>
it out!-=-<br/>
