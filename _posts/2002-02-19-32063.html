SOUNDS GREAT!  Wish I had resources in my area.  We have an only child (9 <br/>
1/2 years)  and it is difficult to find people to help us provide the things <br/>
Dylan is inspired to learn.  Sometimes there simply isn&#39;t a bunch of time to <br/>
devote, but usually the problem is that we live so far away from just about <br/>
everything that, even if we do find something he&#39;s interested in, the travel <br/>
time to get there and back is often a deal-breaker for him.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I both work, so we are sometimes not &quot;inspired&quot;  when Dylan <br/>
is, if you get my drift.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your endeavors.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Even Sudbury&#39;s have mandatory attendance rules and since they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; democractic institutions, they really wouldn&#39;t qualify as &quot;pure&quot;<br/>
&gt;unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; but rather eclectic or relaxed style schools.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If everyone in your house sat down and voted on what to<br/>
&gt;do &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; wise and 3 out of 5 voted to do workbooks on a daily basis, you<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; call it unschooling.  so why call a school that operates on that<br/>
&gt;basis an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;unschooling&quot; school?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Attendance is based upon state laws. Just like my son is required to<br/>
&gt;attend homeschool in NY according to state law required hours. I<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t avoid it at home anymore than they can avoid it in their<br/>
&gt;institution.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The democratic process doesn&#39;t mean that the ones that want to do<br/>
&gt;workbooks can make the others do it by voting on it. It means that<br/>
&gt;the budget, the staff (there are no teachers) members are voted in or<br/>
&gt;out, and other non-cirruculum stuff is voted on. They also use a<br/>
&gt;judicial committee to handle complaints between students. So in<br/>
&gt;essence, its the non-coercive parenting type things that are<br/>
&gt;democratic. The cirriculum is not. Each child is allowed to pursue<br/>
&gt;their own paths. If a bunch of them get-together because they all<br/>
&gt;want to learn something like basket-weaving, then they can vote it<br/>
&gt;into the budget to hire a bonafide basket-weaver to teach them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The age mixing, the ability to have many kinds of adults around of<br/>
&gt;with differing abilities to help you when you want to pursue<br/>
&gt;something is, in my opinion, far better than unschooling at home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;SV has a basic set of principles, then each school develops it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;own &#39;flavour&#39; in addition to the principles that allow them to be<br/>
&gt;called Sudbury.<br/>
