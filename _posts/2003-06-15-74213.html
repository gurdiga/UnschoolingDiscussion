<div id="ygrps-yiv-898719810">Laura, thanks for the response, yes I can do a portfolio, we&#39;re suppose to show progress from year to year and test in grades 3,5,8 & 10. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d really like to hear how others handle the portfolio, especially for my ds who hates anything that resembles school work. For example the only writing he does is thru email and chatting on the puter. There isn&#39;t alot of paper work I could turn in to show he&#39;s making progress, the only paper trail he leaves is some math he does every couple of weeks. He likes to surf, build things, work on an old car I gave him,he likes to see how many speakers he wire to his stereo, play cards, scrabble, chess, he works when he can, things like that but nothing schoolish except for the math. <br/>
<br/>
My dd loves to write letters to people, even builds mailboxes so she can get and give mail. My only concern w/her is the reading she isn&#39;t reading yet and I don&#39;t think she will be anytime too soon, she loves for me to read to her but has no interest in learning herself yet and the schools here are pretty pushy on the reading thing. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m curious how do throw the school the documentation they want w/out changing the way we do things or have I taken this unschooling thing too far? To me unschooling means not doing school, just living and learning naturally as things come up and I&#39;m okay w/this but worried about the documentation part.<br/>
<br/>
So how is everyone else handling this?<br/>

I keep track of content we covered throughout the year, and I print websites that we used or that covers the same content.<br/>
<br/>
I also take pictures of projects and other activities they are in.<br/>
<br/>
I collect pamphlets from field trips we&#39;ve been on.<br/>
<br/>
As for writing and math, thats harder.  I try to log what we<br/>
ve done but I might not have samples.<br/>

LOL of course, why didn&#39;t I think of that, so simple. I guess I&#39;m kind of in panic mode becuz I know how bad I am at keeping track of stuff and now I&#39;m gonna have to do it for both kids, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to mess up and end up in the prinicpals office just like I did when I was a kid. You know where I went to school they had several paddles up on the wall and I knew each one of those paddles personally! I think this coming year we need to learn some serious civic&#39;s lessons by lobbying for COMPLETE hs&#39;ing freedom!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the response, are you folks journaling daily, weekly? monthly? just jotting stuff down? do you do it on the puter or in a notebook, what works best for you folks? I&#39;m usually so tired at the end of the day I don&#39;t feel like doing anything and in the morning if I get up before the kids it&#39;s my only quiet time so I don&#39;t feel like journaling then either. Guess I&#39;m just going to have to find some acceptance in this journaling thing and do it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Darlene<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like my son minus the math work. He doesn&#39;t do anything that &quot;looks&quot; <br/>
educational to most.  He covers math during shopping,Ebay credit card use and <br/>
cooking. We don&#39;t do worksheets or workbooks. <br/>
When I did his portfolio June 2 we covered all that was needed and then some <br/>
but just living. He has covered quite a bit of history and reading this year <br/>
and has done more than I had ever hoped. Surfing covers a lot of science. <br/>
Building covers math and science and cards and games do also. As for grammar <br/>
instant mail and emails apply also. Maybe you could bring in a sample email. They <br/>
don&#39;t want every item just a sample or two. Many of the topics covered I did <br/>
with photo&#39;s of him at the computer, trampoline, motorcycle, on a ladder helping <br/>
his dad build the shed, surfing and playing with his siblings. <br/>
 <br/>
Our assessment person was awesome she was really open to relaxed fun living. <br/>
I also brought in his test scores that showed a 1.9 reading level and then <br/>
help up the Halo book he just completed and also some surfing mags and explained <br/>
that the mags began his love for reading and then he moved on to novels. I <br/>
also printed our entire feedback list and photo&#39;s of items sold on ebay. I also <br/>
brought his Paypal card with his name on it. She listened, never criticized and <br/>
said that she was really impressed. My son also gutted a computer and <br/>
replaced the CD ROM drive in his.<br/>

 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t change a thing. Sounds like your Son and Daughter have taken off <br/>
in some pretty cool interests. They sound like they are doing great. Where we <br/>
live they don&#39;t turn people down they may suggest some ideas for the following <br/>
year but nothing major. You will find also that loads of stuff comes to mind <br/>
during and after the assessment. <br/>
When is the assessment?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189061768">the Halo book he just completed and also some surfing mags  &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is a Halo book? Also do you know of any body boarding mags that are still being published? I&#39;ve been looking online and in the bookstores but haven&#39;t found any.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now don&#39;t laugh but I don&#39;t have to go thru an assessment until the end of the next ps yea. I just want to get a system down that works so that I&#39;m ready come next year. We did the testing for 8th grade this year so no assessment needed. This will be the first year I journal for both kids and turn in a portfolio and I&#39;m majorly lazy when it comes to paper work so I want to figure something out that I can stick with or I&#39;ll be in trouble at the end of this next year.<br/>
<br/>
BTW where do you live? just curious since your ds likes to surf also.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just had my portfolio assessment. I kept a log in a little calendar <br/>
so that I could quickly figure out what we had done during the <br/>
last six months. I made a sheet that had each child&#39;s name with <br/>
subject areas and under them i would then list movies viewed, <br/>
books read, discussions held (both online with friends and with <br/>
us at home), questions asked and pursued (sometimes a book <br/>
would cause us to study astonomy or something like that and I&#39;d <br/>
list it).<br/>
<br/>
I then wrote a personal assessment of each child&#39;s growth <br/>
during the last school year. I discussed what interests the child <br/>
pursued and how (my daughter loves to read and joined the teen <br/>
council at the library, for instance, and included that).<br/>
<br/>
I did mention that my older two had written song lyrics, poems, <br/>
posts on Internet forums about their interests (movies, computer <br/>
programming languages etc.) and estimated how many hours <br/>
were spent doing those activities.<br/>
<br/>
I did bring in &quot;samples&quot; if I could find them. I brought my <br/>
daughter&#39;s journals but didn&#39;t let the assesor read them. Just <br/>
seeing how many she had was sufficient. :) My daughter also <br/>
wrote a novella but I didn&#39;t bring that either. Daughter doesn&#39;t <br/>
want it read yet.<br/>
<br/>
Anything I could bring, I did. 10 yr old son made star charts of all <br/>
the major constellations and wrote out the narrative of each one <br/>
and how it got it&#39;s name. These wnen into page protectors and a <br/>
notebook. That makes them look &quot;official.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ask if your asessor is familiar with unschooling. Mine was and it <br/>
really helped. She also knows me personally so that helps too.<br/>
<br/>
I packed the magazines my son reads, books he&#39;s used to teach <br/>
him Visual Basic and other materials so that she could see that <br/>
we do posess the things I wrote about.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it went great. And it was fun for me to pull together the <br/>
myriad things my kids did this year that showed me what cool <br/>
people they&#39;re becoming.<br/>
<br/>
(Btw, I&#39;m NOT good at keeping records so that little calendar was <br/>
a major step for my personality and I felt pretty pleased that I <br/>
even did it!)<br/>

We have to put together the portfolio and assessment ourselves and turn it into the principal of the ps our dc would be attending if they went to school. We can take everything to a licensed teacher to put together but I don&#39;t know any that are even remotely unschool friendly. Hawaii has a large hs&#39;ing community but I&#39;ve only met one other unschooling family, I hear there are more on the island of Maui. The majority of hs&#39;ers I&#39;ve come into contact w/here are very schoolish, Bob Jones and Abeka seem to be the curriculum of choice.<br/>
<br/>
I think I will go look for a calendar type book w/room for writing, maybe even get two one for each child and see if I can just jot some stuff down each day. I figure if I start trying something now, I&#39;ll figure out something that works before I really need it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks. Darlene<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769916731">**I&#39;d really like to hear how others handle the portfolio, especially<br/>
for my ds who hates anything that resembles school work.**<br/>
<br/>
There is a big section on the unschooling.com message boards under the<br/>
title Meeting Your State Requirements.  You can access stuff there that<br/>
goes back for almost the last two years.<br/>
<br/>
My ds also hates anything that resembles paper work or (yikes!) &quot;seat<br/>
work&quot;, but I live in a state with no reporting requirements.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072978199">I used to journal daily.  Now I have a list of subjects and as the year goes by, I just jot down what we did as it falls into whatever subject.<br/>
<br/>
Then at the end of the year, I put together my samples of content.<br/>

  OH...Forgot to add about the reading:&lt;BR&gt; <br/>
  &lt;BR&gt; <br/>
  Just give them a list of books that you have read to her.  You don&#39;t have to tell them you read to her, just list books she&#39;s read/listened to.&lt;BR&gt; <br/>
  &lt;BR&gt; <br/>

  LOL of course, why didn&#39;t I think of that, so simple. I guess I&#39;m kind of in panic mode becuz I know how bad I am at keeping track of stuff and now I&#39;m gonna have to do it for both kids, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to mess up and end up in the prinicpals office just like I did when I was a kid. You know where I went to school they had several paddles up on the wall and I knew each one of those paddles personally! I think this coming year we need to learn some serious civic&#39;s lessons by lobbying for COMPLETE hs&#39;ing freedom! <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for the response, are you folks journaling daily, weekly? monthly? just jotting stuff down? do you do it on the puter or in a notebook, what works best for you folks? I&#39;m usually so tired at the end of the day I don&#39;t feel like doing anything and in the morning if I get up before the kids it&#39;s my only quiet time so I don&#39;t feel like journaling then either. Guess I&#39;m just going to have to find some acceptance in this journaling thing and do it. <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks, Darlene<br/>
