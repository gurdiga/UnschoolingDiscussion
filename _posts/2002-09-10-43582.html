<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220686632">Sex is not openly discussed in most families, <br/>
not as <br/>
to what pleasures the partner and such.<br/>
Did your parents teach you that?<br/>
That&#39;s why the books and games can enhance so much, if you&#39;re open <br/>
to <br/>
learning.<br/>
Ren<br/>
<br/>
Ren,<br/>
Actually, I don&#39;t think it is a parent&#39;s place to &quot;teach&quot; what <br/>
pleasures a partner.  I think it is up to the married couple to <br/>
learn and teach together!  Before my daughter got married I gave her <br/>
several Christian books on the sex act and we talked about her <br/>
fears, but I didn&#39;t tell her HOW to please her husband or HOW to <br/>
give pleasure.  First of all, I think she would naturally learn that <br/>
(and has) and that each couple is different and their way might not <br/>
be my way!  I am certainly open to learning new things from my <br/>
spouse or with my spouse and experimenting a little, but I also do <br/>
not need a game to do so.  I guess my main fear would be that a game <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do the act justice.  As a Christian, I above all keep the <br/>
marriage act a sacred thing.  By that I mean I would not introduce <br/>
pornography or anything that made it into what the world sees sex <br/>
as.   Whether or not your Karma Sutra game does that, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
I just assumed it was more of a *kinky* game not for Christians.  I <br/>
most certainly could be wrong about that, and am sorry if my <br/>
assumption was incorrect.   I guess I might have a little trouble <br/>
explaining the cinnamon gel in my drawer, but if age appropriate, I <br/>
would explain if a child came across it.  <br/>
  On that note, is anyone else bothered my the freely used &quot;f&quot; word <br/>
on these postings?   I am very surprised to see it used so freely by <br/>
women today.   Or am I the only one it bothers?????<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Mary,<br/>
  Didn&#39;t you ever wonder why the &quot;f&quot; word was a bad word to use?  I <br/>
found the discussion of its etymology very interesting. I mean, if <br/>
one of my kids ask me *why* it is a bad word, I want to know what to <br/>
tell them.  I think sometimes society has these rules and telling <br/>
kids that some words are taboo &quot;just because that&#39;s the way it is&quot; is <br/>
wrong.  &quot;Just because that&#39;s the way it is&quot; isn&#39;t a good enough <br/>
reason why for me.  <br/>
   What about Holly&#39;s question of why crap wasn&#39;t a bad word but sh** <br/>
is?  What would you have told your child? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be bothered if people were using it as a swear word or to refer to sex<br/>
but discussing the word itself doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve never even said damn in my life ;-)<br/>

Well, I&#39;ve (we&#39;ve) only been on this list a few days, and I must admit that <br/>
I&#39;m rather liking it too. &lt;hugs to all&gt; It&#39;s really nice being around <br/>

feel the same way about so many things. Thanks for being here :)<br/>
