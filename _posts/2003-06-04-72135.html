<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840883880">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 44 and my daughter is two.  I sometimes wish I was younger but I try to do a lot with her physically but sometimes I have to call a halt.  I think I&#39;m a good/better mother in all other respects.  My favorite book about this is So Glad We Waited! A Hand Holding Guide for Over 35 Parents by Lois Nachamie. <br/>
<br/>
I have the most problems socially.  I&#39;m not sure how to act around the younger moms.  I&#39;ve already worked outside the home, I&#39;m a stay-at-home mom for now, looking to work part-time.  I&#39;m much more opinionated than the younger moms I&#39;ve met and much less willing to listen to authority figures.  Anyway I&#39;ll be 59 when Katrina is 17 so I have to plan for retirement and an empty nest at the same time.  Makes saving for college easy.  We just put all our savings into retirement plans since we&#39;ll be able to take the money out without penalty after 59.  <br/>

I will be 60 when Alyssa turns 18. When I think of it, it doesn&#39;t really<br/>
bother me. My mom was always much older than my friends moms were. My mom<br/>
was the coolest mom and we always had a bunch of kids hanging out at my<br/>
house. Well into high school even. My mom is 77 now and is very active and<br/>
great with all my kids. You should see her play with the younger three,<br/>
especially in the pool!!! Age to me doesn&#39;t mean squat!!!<br/>
<br/>
As far as relating, I never had that problem. When I was younger, I always<br/>
hung out with much older friends. Like 10=20 years older. So now that I&#39;m<br/>
hanging with younger friends, I guess it all falls into place. I kind of<br/>
take on the mom role and well that&#39;s fine with me. I don&#39;t look old and as<br/>
Tara says, I don&#39;t look like a mom. All of Tara&#39;s friends are pretty<br/>
surprised when they meet me. They think we&#39;re sisters. I guess that helps.<br/>
Just being comfortable with who you are, and really loving yourself no<br/>
matter what shape or age makes getting along with others so much easier.<br/>
