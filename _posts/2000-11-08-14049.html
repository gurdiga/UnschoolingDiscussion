&lt;&lt; Hi Carol,<br/>
<br/>
I am coming out of lurkdom (is that a word? LOL) to suggest an idea for you.<br/>
My son is also very interested in video games. Why not research with him on<br/>
how they are designed and ask him to design a game. You never know what<br/>
could happen from there. :-)<br/>

Dear Valerie,<br/>
<br/>
   I like this idea; thank you!  I just can&#39;t accept the idea that endless <br/>
playing of video games constitutes an intellectual pursuit.  (And yes, <br/>
Sandra, I have played the games with my kids.  I *do* know what they&#39;re <br/>
about!)  To me, thinking of video games like Super Smash Brothers as a <br/>
learning activity is the equivalent of saying that a bag of Doritos, a candy <br/>
bar and a Coke constitute a good dinner.  Tasty perhaps, but ultimately not <br/>
very nourishing.  Thanks for your idea, Valerie!  This gives me a positive <br/>
way to approach the issue.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;  To me, thinking of video games like Super Smash Brothers &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have kids here who say:<br/>
<br/>
Super Smash Brothers isn&#39;t educational, it&#39;s just fun.<br/>
<br/>
Strategy games, though, like Harvest Moon, Banjo Kazooie, Zelda, the RPG <br/>
games, Ogre Battle, are going to involve a lot of thought and planning.  Then <br/>
there are pattern games (which are math and speed-of-thought and reasoning <br/>
and coordination):  Kirby&#39;s Avalanche, Dr. Mario (we don&#39;t know an equivalent <br/>
for 64).<br/>
<br/>
It would be possible to name four or five (hundreds) of books which aren&#39;t <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; but it wouldn&#39;t be a reason to claim that books are mindless <br/>
and harmful and shouldn&#39;t be owned or read, or that too much book reading <br/>
doesn&#39;t take a brain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811452880">My 6 yo son often becomes frustrated with video games that are too difficult<br/>
or that are not intuitive enough, so I have also used these games to prompt<br/>
him to reason out what makes a game a &quot;good&quot; one:  &quot;If you were designing a<br/>
good game, what would you put in it? How would it work?&quot;  This, I hope, will<br/>
start him thinking about the idea that people design the games, that they<br/>
can design them poorly or well, that to build a good game requires planning<br/>
and using good design principles, and, most importantly, that he could be an<br/>
actor in this process rather than just a passive recipient of whatever comes<br/>
down the pipe.<br/>
