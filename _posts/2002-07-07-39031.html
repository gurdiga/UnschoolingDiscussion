&quot;I&#39;m SO sorry you feel that way. I feel my son is doing just fine&quot; (and mutter to yourself.. &#39;and he&#39;s a lot smarter than YOU are.. but dont&#39; let the other person hear that lololll)<br/>
<br/>
and walk away.. because they are not worth trying to convince.. it threatens their own self confidence ..<br/>
WE know the reality of the situation. when it comes to our kids.. i have found these people have little to offer me. <br/>
<br/>
(yes yes i know. unless there is a problem with the teachers behavior toward your child then of course i would address that.. )<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I&#39;m not the only person who has benefited from changing &quot;teach&quot; to learn&quot; and <br/>
  &gt;(for what it&#39;s worth) I myself learned that from a college professor who was <br/>
  &gt;involved in the school reform movement of the early 1970&#39;s.  <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Do you remember RReil from the old AOL days?  Maybe he&#39;s here, that <br/>
  would be interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, he said something in P/CP that was shocking to me then, but I&#39;ve <br/>
  thought about it for years and years and I believe he&#39;s right.  Maybe <br/>
  someone else can remember his whole argument, but this is the part I <br/>
  remember the most.  He said that (paraphrasing from long ago) teaching <br/>
  was an immoral act, because it was an attempt to control the thoughts of <br/>
  others.  His arguments for this were very compelling.  <br/>
<br/>
  And he is a teacher by profession, too, which makes his thoughts even <br/>
  more interesting to me.<br/>

OOoh!  OOOOH!<br/>
<br/>
You could get HIM to think it by saying, &quot;When you were his age, were you <br/>
that interested in Sunday School?&quot;  or  &quot;When you were his age were you able <br/>
to giggle with the girls the way you&#39;d like him to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Take him down with one move, and he&#39;ll be thinking for a week.<br/>
