That&#39;s interesting.<br/>
If you&#39;re going to live  your life in reaction mode, unschooling will be <br/>
difficult.<br/>
<br/>
One reason I&#39;m glad my kids don&#39;t go to school is that it&#39;s a place where <br/>
other people tell them what they should want and like, what is &quot;not until next <br/>
year&quot; and what is &quot;too babyish.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Judging that movie by the list of &quot;objectional&quot; items, when the movie is NOT <br/>
about those topics is not good use of personal thought.   If other people are <br/>
going to do your thinking for you, why unschool?  You could buy a <br/>
pre-sanitized curriculum.  There are several out there.  They tell history and science and <br/>
everything in VERY sanitized versions.<br/>
<br/>
Or there&#39;s the real world, which doesn&#39;t come all edited and cleaned up, <br/>
which is WONDERFUL, because by coming across things they didn&#39;t know, children <br/>
will learn.  By sticking to the safest and most well-lit trails, life stays cold.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
NEVER?  Never their whole lives or just until their birthdays?<br/>
<br/>
My 12, 15 and 17 year olds watched it (the oldest again, with me) and they <br/>
were able to discuss characters, writing, comedic styles, the fantasy sequence <br/>
of the mall&#39;s fountain as an African watering hole, the motivations of the <br/>
characters, the awakening morality...<br/>
<br/>
My kids are doing very well without being in an over-sheltered environment.  <br/>
Is it genetics?  I don&#39;t think so.  I think it&#39;s openness and acceptance.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s a willingness to look around and either ignore things or discuss <br/>
them.  Hiding things from them doesn&#39;t contribute to growth.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I do hide:  Murders and crazy abuses.  I don&#39;t say, &quot;Hey, did you <br/>
hear about this prisoner abuse?&quot;  They only very vaguely knew about the <br/>
kidnapped Mormon girl.  Kirby and Marty probably read bits as AOL came up.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think Holly ever knew.  She might read about it someday, or not.<br/>
<br/>
The opposite of sheltering children from the world is NOT shoving their faces <br/>
in it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, there is a balance.  If a child as old as 11 or 13 wanted to do or see <br/>
something, I wouldn&#39;t prevent it.  I would discuss it, but what they do isn&#39;t <br/>
mine to decide entirely (in my way of thinking).  Instead of controlling my <br/>
children, I try to just give them an open safe environment and they KNOW they <br/>
don&#39;t have to watch or do or be any way that makes them uncomfortable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What an odd statement for an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
We in America have a bizarre relationship with sex.  We tell kids it is this<br/>
&quot;wonderful gift&quot; but don&#39;t open it until after you get married.  Then<br/>
anytime it comes up when they are children, we act like we find this<br/>
&#39;wonderful gift&quot; disgusting.<br/>
<br/>
Children are sexual beings.  The Latency period is a fallacy thought up in<br/>
Freud&#39;s little noggin.<br/>

only are we *not* hiding it, we&#39;re seeking out ways to understand more about it <br/>
together, as different aspects of it unfold. Her younger brother OTOH is <br/>
oblivious to it all and that is just fine with me! :)  JJ <br/>
