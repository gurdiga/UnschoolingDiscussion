stations; prefers ANYTHING in New York City to trees; would never <br/>
look for fractals in nature; and could care less what century or <br/>
where Beethoven lived (even as she plays his stuff); and sleeps alot -<br/>

If we tell all the screw-ups and failures and lacks, we could go on forever.  <br/>
The things I don&#39;t know and can&#39;t do would fill more pages than things I can <br/>
do, and that I like and that fascinate me.  But the things I don&#39;t care about <br/>
aren&#39;t much related to me, generally (not counting phobias or aversions).<br/>
<br/>
So about some of my favorite unschooled kids, Pam Sorooshians three <br/>
daughters, I know good stories, and I tell good stories, but I never think <br/>
much about bad parts, because that&#39;s not the GOOD stuff.<br/>
