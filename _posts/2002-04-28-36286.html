<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204097676">I live in TN and the state requires testing (by the state) for homeschoolers.  We were not required to test this year but we did last year and will be next year. It also requires parents to have a college degree to homeschool the high school years.  If no degree is possessed (which we don&#39;t) then we must go through an *umbrella* (I think they call it) school.  We are approaching high school in the upcoming year and have a Christian school in the town near us to work through.  My question is, Do any of you have these requirements?  I was just wondering how to deal with the grades that must be submitted to the school ever so often.  We don&#39;t do much paper and book work except Math and occasionally grammar.  <br/>
I know he can ace most tests that they give although next year we will be testing through the school we go through instead of the state.  I&#39;m just wondering how to handle all the paper work that will be required during the course of the year.  I know some states don&#39;t have such strict guidelines for homeschoolers but maybe some of you have dealt with this and can give me some advice.<br/>
Thanks again for the support and encourgagement I get from the group!<br/>
