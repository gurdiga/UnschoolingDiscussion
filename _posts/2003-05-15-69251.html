<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060207301">School&#39;s Out Support&#39;s Live & Learn Unschooling Conference <br/>
<br/>
August 22-24, 2003<br/>
Holiday Inn-Coliseum in Columbia, South Carolina <br/>
    <br/>
This conference is a must attend! Meet other families on the same journey, <br/>
listen to inspiring speakers, and discover the art of unschooling in <br/>
beautiful downtown Columbia, SC. This is a non-age-discriminatory conference: <br/>
anyone can participate in any Funshop or Presentation. Bring the whole family <br/>
for a joy-filled weekend!<br/>
    <br/>
School&#39;s Out Support (SOS) is a volunteer-driven, statewide organization <br/>
whose mission is to support and promote unschooling, provide information, <br/>
monitor and influence legislation, offer opportunities for families to get <br/>
together, and empower families to make the choices that respect the rights, <br/>
needs and aspirations of their children. SOS welcomes anyone with an interest <br/>
in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Since its inception in April 2001, SOS has supported families that have made <br/>
the decision to unschool as they face difficult questions and challenges. <br/>
These families may wonder about socialization, the legal issues surrounding <br/>
unschooling, accountability associations, or integration of John Holt&#39;s <br/>
educational philosophy into their everyday lives. Some families may doubt <br/>
their abilities, feel confused and ask themselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. <br/>
SOS encourages parents to trust themselves and their children to make good <br/>
decisions and empowers them to find the support and information they need. <br/>
<br/>
Our Presenters<br/>
For our Keynote presenter we are very fortunate to have the popular <br/>
contributor to Unschooling.com message boards, its e-list, AlwaysLearning, <br/>
and regular columnist in HEM---unschooling guru, Sandra Dodd. A former middle <br/>
school teacher, Sandra has talked countless families into running away from <br/>
school and jumping into learning for fun. Her motto: &quot;Everything Counts!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also delighted to have Anne Ohman, from the Unschooling.com message <br/>
boards, back for a return engagement. She &quot;stole the show&quot; last year with her <br/>
debut and is now in demand at conferences all over the country. AnneO&#39;s <br/>
passionate, gentle approach to life and learning continues to inspire <br/>
families daily.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian is well known in &quot;all the unschooling <br/>
circles&quot;---Unschooling.com&#39;s message boards, the unschoolingdotcom e-list, <br/>
AlwaysLearning, NHEN, and the California boards. When she&#39;s not teaching <br/>
college level economics and statistics, Pam&#39;s an unschooling mom of three <br/>
teenagers: she&#39;s &quot;been there, done that&quot;---and will surely have a few answers <br/>
for you!<br/>
<br/>
Mary Gold is better known as &quot;Zenmomma&quot;--and you can find her wherever <br/>
unschooling is a topic! Mary &quot;preaches&quot; peace and trust and joy---and the <br/>
pure delight of unschooling her children. Her encouraging words are music to <br/>
a stressed parent&#39;s ears---and she always leaves you knowing that &quot;Life is <br/>
good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jim Weiss&#39; storytelling has captivated and delighted both adults and children <br/>
with his original stories and retellings of classics. To hear him tell a <br/>
story is to be swept into another world. Jim&#39;s award-winning tapes are <br/>
favorites in many homes---including ours!<br/>
