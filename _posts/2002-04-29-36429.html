You might want to try a trampoline, though, if you haven&#39;t already. Conor <br/>
likes to jump hard and slam his own body around when he gets mad.<br/>

As tempting as that is from time to time, I NEVER hit him - - it&#39;s <br/>
not his fault he has these problems.  But I see  the humor in what you <br/>
read.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bear in mind, though, that he won&#39;t ever be &quot;fixed&quot;. (And I know you meant <br/>
that in a loving, tender way. :o)) He will be helped, though. He will get <br/>
tools and medications and compensations and self-directed coping strategies <br/>
that will help him learn to live with who he is. But still, he is, Who He <br/>
Is. Always will be. Flawed in some troubling ways maybe, just like the rest <br/>
of us. But fabulous too, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

of intentions to help him. And you really can&#39;t ever know for sure that <br/>
earlier intervention would have been the best choice. Some professionals <br/>
recommend early intervention with reading after all, and we&#39;ve mostly <br/>
managed to overcome that piece of advice. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yes, I know that.  By &#39;fixed&#39;, I mean back in balance and in <br/>
control of himself.  Right now, he is so fearful it is sad.  And it <br/>
came out yesterday in the session with the therapist that he feels so <br/>
different from others and not in the good way that the girls feel <br/>
different.  I nearly cried.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I still think that earlier intervention would have been a <br/>
bad thing.  The problems were to complicated and he was not able <br/>
enough to express himself.  I suspect we would have gotten a bad <br/>
diagnosis.  So, I&#39;m not too upset about waiting but I wonder &#39;what <br/>
if&#39;.<br/>
