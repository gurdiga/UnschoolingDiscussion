&gt;&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t use time-out or any other such form of punishment.  I<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t remove &#39;privileges&#39; (what do people regard as privileges,<br/>
&gt;anyhow?  This is a serious question, btw, I&#39;ve never quite<br/>
&gt;understood this term) unless they were directly involved ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a funny story on this topic... I was with a group of moms and the<br/>
&gt;topic turned to toilet-training, and one of them, who was then very<br/>
&gt;determinedly training her 22-month-old son, said that when he messed up, <br/>
&gt;she<br/>
&gt;would take away privileges.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was at a loss to imagine what would be a privilege for a 22-month-old...<br/>
&gt;bedtime story? his teddy bear?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337174445">Zak didn&#39;t start going in the toilet until my friend came over with her two <br/>
boys.  Just before they were leaving after their playdate the boys stood in <br/>
the garden and peed... Zak thought this was wonderful and did the same,  When <br/>
I suggested he could use the toilet as well, he said &quot;ok I&#39;ll go there <br/>
too&quot;... We alternated between the garden and the toilet for a while.  It took <br/>
a lot to convince him that going in the bathroom was a better idea than the <br/>
garden unless we were camping.<br/>
<br/>
With bm&#39;s that was more difficult.  He used a pull up for the longest time <br/>
and we went along with it.  Then we tried to take them away and he would hold <br/>
and then go everywhere.  This was all still going on 6 months ago... Then I <br/>
just decided to give up as they are his bowls and it&#39;s something in his <br/>
little life he has control over.  So we stopped bothering him.  We told him <br/>
we were not buying anymore pull ups when that pack ran out and he&#39;d have to <br/>
figure out what to do all by himself.  There were a couple of accidents where <br/>
he didn&#39;t make it to the toilet, but within a few days he was going on his <br/>
own and was dry at night as well.<br/>
<br/>
I will definately not make a big deal out of it for Max... I think it was far <br/>
more stressful for Steve and I than for Zak.. He seemed to love the power he <br/>
had over us.<br/>

My daughter trained because I let her run around the house naked to whole <br/>
time we were at home.  Plus when she was in a diaper, I used cloth.  She <br/>
could not stand the wet on her bottom.  She told me she didn&#39;t want to wear a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-436855859">our experience was similar.  people ask me about potty training and <br/>
i&#39;ve had to say it was a non-event.  rene&#39; i think he started using <br/>
the tiolet around 2 (we had a potty chair but he never used it) and <br/>
was completely out of diapers - night time included- by around 3 1/2.  <br/>
i think he had 2 or 3 accidence all while he was sleeping but nothing <br/>
since he turned 4.  <br/>
<br/>
we used cloth but mostly only for night and for going on trips, at <br/>
home he was naked most of the time (we did use paper when i got sick - <br/>
he was 20 months but switched back for the last 9 months or so).  i <br/>
think because we never made a big deal about it, for the first 2 years <br/>
when he peed or pooped i just cleaned it up.  but he always came in <br/>
the bathroom when someone else was in there so he saw others using the <br/>
tiolet.  when he was around 2 i felt he could understand and when he <br/>
peed on the floor i told him he was quiet capable to use the tiolet so <br/>
he had to stop going on the floor and he did.  it was that simple - <br/>
one time.   pooping was not a big deal either, in fact he used the <br/>
tiolet all the time for pooping before he did for peeing, but i think <br/>
this is because he had the oportunity to explore his poop (when i <br/>
wasn&#39;t quite fast enough in clean-up :)  but we have hardwood floors - <br/>
with carpeting this doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense:)<br/>

<br/>
I read a book when my 1st was a baby called &quot;toilet training in 1 day&quot;... <br/>
there were some really crappy ideas in it, but some really great ones too... <br/>
i used some of those... and ironically, it&#39;s still the same principle i use <br/>
to &quot;train&quot; my kids... it&#39;s showing them consequences(not giving them <br/>
consequences)... and letting them choose their own action... so here&#39;s what i <br/>
did... ted was 2 1/2 at the time... and it truly took only one day... I <br/>
bought him a baby doll that wet with a nice dress on... he was thrilled... i <br/>
told him that since it was his baby, he had to take care of her... which <br/>
thrilled him even more...  i gave him lots of juice that morning... and i <br/>
gave him juice to feed his baby... the baby peed the diaper... i said, &quot;ok, <br/>
she&#39;s going to be doing that alot... just like you do... so you have to clean <br/>
her up and change her just like mommy does you.&quot;.... i continued to give him <br/>
all of his favorite juices that morning... and he would give him to his <br/>
dolly... at one point we were watching sesame street... he wanted some juice <br/>
and i suggested he give some to his baby... when she peed, he sighed and got <br/>
up to go clean her diaper... he didn&#39;t want to leave the show... but i said <br/>
that he couldn&#39;t leave her sitting in pee pee... it might give her diaper <br/>
rash... i suggested that maybe he teach her to go on the potty... he thought <br/>
that was a wonderful idea and so it goes... he peed the potty from that day <br/>
on... teaching the baby was the key... he was tired of washing out diapers <br/>
and panties... of course, i empathized with him... he used his potty chair <br/>
after that...</div>

Michael to go the potty, I tried bribery. I hate gum and my kids hardly ever <br/>
get any, so I bought a bunch of gum and said that whenever Michael pees in <br/>
the potty, Everyone gets gum. I thought that then they would all be <br/>
encouraging him to go. It worked great-Mike started peeing and all the kids <br/>
would cheer him on. Then, about 5 years later, I found out that it was Ricky <br/>
who was peeing in the little potty, telling me it was Mike,  and they were <br/>
all in on it!! See what bribery gets you-cheaters!! And eventually Mike went <br/>
anyway, so I guess it was me who learned the lesson that time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935423895">I don&#39;t know if you actually call it a privilege, to him I mean, but I <br/>
would prefer to appeal to the better nature, so to speak, by <br/>
explaining that the phone is there for the use of the whole house, <br/>
therefore the time on it needs to be limited.  Once again it comes <br/>
down to stuff being internal instead of external.  My3&1/2dd <br/>
apologised to me today for not putting something in the bin.  I just <br/>
said &#39;bin,&#39; a la Faber and Mazlish, and she said &#39;oop, sorry,&#39; and <br/>
rushed to the bin.  Shock horror!!!  But there again I didn&#39;t use the <br/>
phone that much when I was 14 (too skint) and don&#39;t have 14yo <br/>
kids myself.  No doubt my position may change with changing <br/>
circumstances &lt;g&gt;<br/>

a privilege granted <br/>
to law abiding citizens&quot;... lol... gad that was 30 <br/>
years ago... i remember <br/>
thinking it was my right to drive... but the state <br/>
didn&#39;t see it that way... <br/>
my 14 year old son thinks it&#39;s his right to spend 7 <br/>

feel much better about things now.  I might try the doll idea, although my <br/>
