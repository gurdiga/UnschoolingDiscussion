&lt;&lt;  So the question remains unanswered, How do you go about finding <br/>
 people to &quot;trade lessons&quot; with if your kids want to learn something <br/>
 you can&#39;t help them with? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The original post was asking about a younger child, and trading math for <br/>
history or geography.<br/>
I think the advice to not try and shunt these into subjects and try to make <br/>
lessons out of them was right on......not at all like an older child that has <br/>
decided they want higher math or some specialized information the parent <br/>
would have a hard time helping them get.<br/>
But as to trading, if that&#39;s what you choose. Don&#39;t you just find a parent <br/>
willing to trade and do it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As an unschooling parent, we don&#39;t/didn&#39;t do lessons in math, geography, <br/>
history, science, reading or writing or any other subject -- not for the <br/>
young kids - not until, as teenagers, they got interested in going to <br/>
community college and taking actual courses. <br/>
<br/>
But for a while, we did trade violin lessons for my daughter in exchange for <br/>
me playing math games with someone else&#39;s kids during the lessons. This is <br/>
someone who uses the Calvert Curriculum -- playing math games was really a <br/>
BREAK for her kids and fun for them. My younger daughter would play with us <br/>
when her sister was having her lesson, she LOVES math and games and was happy <br/>
to have me coming up with games and to have another kid to play them with, on <br/>
a regular basis -- my older daughter wasn&#39;t interested so she did something <br/>
else. The violin teacher&#39;s kids had to play - their mom was paying for it, by <br/>
giving my kids the violin lessons they wanted. They played eagerly and had <br/>
fun. When I say &quot;math games&quot; - it was activities out of books like the &quot;Math <br/>
for Smartypants&quot; book by Marilyn Burns.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody is helping my daughters build a dollhouse and I&#39;m tutoring her 16 yo <br/>
in math because she wants to take the CHSPE. But we&#39;re friends - it isn&#39;t a <br/>
&quot;trade&quot; - it is just her doing something with my kids because she likes them <br/>
and wants to do it and me doing something for hers because I like them and <br/>
want to do it - but not &quot;in exchange&quot; -- we do all kinds of things together. <br/>
<br/>
I guess the best advice about this that I can think of is not to be too shy <br/>
to just ask someone to help your kid out with something. IF the child wants <br/>
to learn it - and the person has the expertise - they&#39;ll usually be happy to <br/>
share. It won&#39;t work out well if it turns out that it is the parent pushing <br/>
the child to learn it and the child isn&#39;t really interested. <br/>
<br/>
I have helped a number of teenagers learn to write an &quot;essay&quot; -- because they <br/>
have to do it on the CHSPE as well as study for the math part of the exam. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it if the parent came and said they wanted the kid to learn it, <br/>
etc. But I willingly and happily give up some of my scarce time to help any <br/>
teenager who asks me themselves and says that THEY want to do it.<br/>
