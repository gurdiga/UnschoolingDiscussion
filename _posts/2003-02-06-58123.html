<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;.  Can you tell me what you did<br/>
&gt; today?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Today, we got up at bout 10:00.  Snuggled in bed reading for about 30 min <br/>
then got up.  I answered E mail while the boys (5 and 8) played on their <br/>
computers.  One is playing Age of Mythology and the other is playing some <br/>
star wars game.  Then I read some out loud to both and we got dressed and <br/>
went to get groceries.  Oh yes I think somewhere in there one boy had a <br/>
strawberry shake and one had some chocolate milk and a peanut butter cup.  <br/>
Got home and they went downstairs to watch Star Wars and build with LEGOs and <br/>
eat cheese and crackers while I finished some applique work.  Oh yea, and <br/>
watch the snow as it has just started to snowing again.  Love that.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; all or is that what unschooling is all about?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>For us unschooling is living and learning as a family.  It is trusting each <br/>
member of the family to make decisions that are in their best interest.  It <br/>
is about being there to answer questions and explore with each other.  To <br/>
inspire and be inspired.  And much much more.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That sounds like a wonderful day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Holly and I made pancakes.  Some normal, and some very thin, which we spread <br/>
with strawberry cream cheese and rolled up.  Those made lunch-to-go for her <br/>
and Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby needed to work at 11:30.<br/>
<br/>
Marty got up to eat pancakes with us.  The three kids and I ate together; <br/>
that&#39;s unusual for breakfast without company or without a morning outing <br/>
planned.<br/>
<br/>
Holly walked to a collectors&#39; store where there&#39;s a homeschooling Harry <br/>
Potter tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was up writing something, something about a game.  Designing a <br/>
character maybe.  He got a phone call from a friend.  They discussed L5R <br/>
(another game, with a weeks-long tournament which started last week).<br/>
<br/>
Kirby called for a ride, Marty wanted to go to the shop for L5R, so I <br/>
delivered Marty to Active Imagination, picked Kirby up, took Kirby to where <br/>
Holly is at Collector&#39;s Paradise.<br/>
<br/>
All the driving around involved joking and story telling and plans for the <br/>
rest of the week and weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve talked to my husband twice.  He went to work for the first time in three <br/>
days, and isn&#39;t doing so well.  He&#39;s been sick.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve cleaned a tub and a shower, washed the rubber mats and put them on the <br/>
line so the sunshine can do its thing.<br/>
<br/>
Laundry&#39;s going through bedding of sick folks so they can sweat on clean <br/>
stuff tonight (Kirby and Keith are sleeping long and hot, which is good for <br/>
them).  <br/>
<br/>
On the table are some plastic notch-together attribute-things.  They haven&#39;t <br/>
been out for a long time.  Holly and Marty have been making some cool things <br/>
with them.  They&#39;re making full 360 degree symmetrical shapes, with patterns <br/>
in the colors.  That&#39;s math I can&#39;t describe.  Both of them are way into it, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s been working on the little triangle puzzle/game where there&#39;s one <br/>
empty space, you jump marbles over other marbles until there&#39;s only one left. <br/>
 Working it out on paper, she proved the best way to do it.  But now she&#39;s <br/>
doing other patterns, trying to see how many she can possibly leave.  The <br/>
maximum would be seven.  She&#39;s trying to find a way to leave more than four, <br/>
on purpose and then describe the findings to her dad.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has karate at 5:00.  He usually has a weapons class at 6:00 on <br/>
Thursdays but he&#39;s just going to do the first class and come home.  I&#39;ll <br/>
probably drive him and read in the car outside for the hour.<br/>
<br/>
My husband got home and is messing with the trailer he&#39;s going to take to the <br/>
Estrella War next week, a big SCA event near Phoenix.<br/>
<br/>
Although people are out and about, this is a really quiet day for us.  And at <br/>
4:00, no telling what all will yet happen.  Marty and I might go out late at <br/>
night (11:00 or so) so he can drive the van on some back streets and a big <br/>
parking lot.  We&#39;ll probably get french fries, as we&#39;re the two potato fans <br/>
in the family, and go out in the dark somewhere so he can practice turning <br/>
and parking.<br/>
