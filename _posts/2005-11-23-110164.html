<div id="ygrps-yiv-676586174">I&#39;m borrowing something PamS wrote on our California list:<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to add something - especially since you were really feeling  <br/>
so awful about this --- there is NO academic subject that is  <br/>
important enough to risk harming a parent-child relationship. NOTHING  <br/>
is more important than your relationship. There is no work - school  <br/>
work, housework, yard work, or anything else, that is more important  <br/>
than your relationship. ALWAYS put that first.**<br/>
<br/>
I want to say &quot;Amen&quot; and share a bad example.<br/>
<br/>
At my mom&#39;s yesterday we were looking at a birthday card that my son selected (and I sent) for her birthday last week.  It had the very sweet message &quot;I know three things about the earth.  1) It&#39;s round, 2) The earth revolves around it and 3) You are the best thing on it.&quot;  (Awwww..... I thought it was adorable that he picked something with such a heartfelt message for her.)<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to emphasize to her that he personally selected this card to express his feelings for her.  She managed not to hear me and to *complain about his handwriting* instead.   It makes me want to holler.<br/>

And that negated the message in the card.    I might&#39;ve turned the card over <br/>
and read the price aloud and made sigh-and-cluck noise about how much I paid to <br/>
be insulted by someone who might&#39;ve been grateful instead.<br/>
<br/>
And the next birthday or whatever:   no card.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084047180">I think the difference with your example Ren, is that you or their Dad (or<br/>
it could be anyone that they really like...grandma, etc) is with them while<br/>
you are working. This is far different than a daycare they hate - or school<br/>
then after school care, where you only see them for 2-3 hours per night<br/>
while trying to make them do homework and get into bed for the next school<br/>
day<br/>
<br/>
We watched this happen with my son&#39;s friend. It broke my heart one day, as<br/>
he was crying his heart out and his mother was literally pushing him onto<br/>
the bus. ( He is in 1st grade) She has since, took a leave of absence from<br/>
her very well paying job - with lots of travel. (Her husband travels a lot<br/>
with his job too). You can tell that he is happier - I think just having her<br/>
around and being able to go home any time he likes becasue she is home helps<br/>
a lot.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is, if you were to see that working affected your children<br/>
negatively you would probably find another way. There are certainly lots of<br/>
things Mom&#39;s can do and still be with their children - especially working<br/>
shorter/smarter ;-)<br/>

I just wanted to respond to this.  I think that if you can have a <br/>
career and still be all you want to be to your kids and all they <br/>
need you to be that it is wonderful.  It is probably very rewarding <br/>
all the way around.  If you have family that you trust and will <br/>
respect your ideas for your children and can help out with the <br/>
children that is even better.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any famiy around and no friends close enough to even <br/>
help out occasionally.  We are military and move appx. every 2.5 <br/>
years.  But even if I did have all the help in the world I still <br/>
don&#39;t think I would choose to work, because I feel that I would not <br/>
be able to physically or mentally make myself available to my kids <br/>
in the ways that I want to.  I have physical limitations now that <br/>
drive me crazy &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that no matter how a person chooses to live their life that <br/>
as long as everyone is happy and gaining what they want out of that <br/>
life then it is great.  I choose my life as it is because it gives <br/>
me and my family what we all want.  And my own little world is <br/>
joyous!  I do have to say my own little world though, because my <br/>
extended family is pretty crappy.  But I try to protect my kids from <br/>
their rudeness and hatefulness.  <br/>
<br/>
I look at how my father was as my parent and I try to protect my <br/>
kids from that kind of life.  His wife is just plain wicked!  She is <br/>
the kind of person that is really mean to you in private but just <br/>
fondles all over you in front of others.  My kids can&#39;t stand her.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know why I even considered going.  We should have stayed <br/>
home and we would have enjoyed each other.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway our visit with family this holiday pretty much sucked and <br/>
left me feeling homicidal&lt;G&gt; and never wanting to visit again and  I <br/>
mean that not wanting to ever visit again part most sincerely.  How <br/>
sad...<br/>
<br/>
Dana, who I guess really needed to rant about our lousy visit with <br/>
family...should have been wonderful!  Oh, well...</div>

blackmail and other really evil things.   And it&#39;s why I decided and stated years <br/>
ago that I wouldn&#39;t cover for anyone who does that.   It happened quite a bit <br/>
in a club I was involved in, it&#39;s happened with a playgroup I was in years <br/>
back, and it&#39;s happened around lists like this one, that someone will write <br/>
something all sugary in public, but then be threatening and insulting, snarky and <br/>
sarcastic directly TO people in private.    If people do that in one context, <br/>
I&#39;m guessing they do it in many.   The worst case I&#39;m thinking of is a man who <br/>
threatened a couple of women with physical violence and then said nice things <br/>
about them in writing.    I think his hope was that the original threats would <br/>
be kept secret, but they weren&#39;t.   I got written statements and made them <br/>
known to him and some others who could keep an eye on him.   Almost every one of <br/>
those other men knew of at least one woman who had complained.   But if each <br/>
complaint is kept quiet, there can be dozens and the person has no reason to <br/>
stop.<br/>
<br/>
The guy a couple of weeks ago who came here all a-rant about unschooling <br/>
started off sweet and neutral, but was writing to people on the side saying things <br/>
that just weren&#39;t nice at all.   I think he wrote to at least a dozen people.<br/>
<br/>
So about that stepmother...   Maybe start documenting some of the statements <br/>
and put them in writing to her and your dad.   I don&#39;t mean in a big <br/>
collection blitz, but just maybe one at a time as they unfold, write a not back, and <br/>
say &quot;I was uncomfortable when you said [whatever], please don&#39;t do that.&quot;   And <br/>
when she is &quot;trained&quot; to trust that you will NOT keep it secret she might <br/>
quit.   Or she&#39;ll get worse, and that should all be documented too.   Because if <br/>
she&#39;s gotten this far in life and people haven&#39;t nailed her for it, she might <br/>
continue in the same vein with your children for thirty years.   <br/>

<br/>
I had left out some of our visit simply because I didn&#39;t feel up to <br/>
writing about it.  However, Sandra you are more right than you could <br/>
ever know about these behaviors.  I was raised in a sexually abusive <br/>
situation and lived with my stepfather who was exactly like this.  <br/>
Therefor most people never believed my stories and I lived in that <br/>
situation with no help until I turned 16 and I ran away and never <br/>
went back.<br/>
<br/>
As far as my stepmother, she is a 64 year old drunk.  I have never <br/>
seen her quite as bad as I did this Thursday.  My father had to <br/>
carry her to bed because she was so trashed.  She almost lit her <br/>
face and hair on fire trying to light a cigarette.  Then she got up <br/>
from bed because she said the t.v. was too loud and my kids were <br/>
bothering her.  <br/>
<br/>
My father immediately jumped up and ran for her before she fell over <br/>
on one of my kids (it happened really fast)who were laying on an air <br/>
mattress in the living room.  Then she proceeded to fight with him <br/>
over the remote.  It was just awful.  <br/>
<br/>
Before she even got drunk she was really nasty to my kids.  She was <br/>
pissed at me for not forcing them to go to bed.  At my house there <br/>
really isn&#39;t a bedtime rule and so they are not used to being forced <br/>
to go to sleep.  It&#39;s not like they weren&#39;t laying down and they <br/>
weren&#39;t talking loud or bothering anyone.  She told them that it was <br/>
adult time and they needed to go to bed.  Whatever!!!<br/>
<br/>
My 6 year old Franki, who my s-mother particularly picked on while <br/>
were there wanted to leave in the middle of the night.  I packed up <br/>
yesterday morning and can&#39;t imagine ever going back.  Why?, it&#39;s not <br/>
like any of us enjoyed our visit.  All my children detest her and I <br/>
don&#39;t blame them.  <br/>
<br/>
After all the mean and nasty things she said to Franki, she wanted <br/>
her to give her a kiss and told her how much she loves her.  <br/>
Bullshit!!!  I didn&#39;t make her kiss her -- I wouldn&#39;t have kissed <br/>
her big fat drunk lips YUCK!!!  Besides I felt it was just a way to <br/>
manipulate my child.  Treat her like crap and then tell her how much <br/>
she means to you!?!  <br/>
<br/>
The whole visit sucked and I have no intentions of repeating it.  No <br/>
one protected me from my life of horror...but I will not ever <br/>
intentionally place my children in a position for them to be <br/>
physically or mentally (which is just as bad in my book).   She made <br/>
a choice to behave that way, my father made a choice to let it <br/>
happen, I am making a choice to never let it happen again.<br/>
<br/>
I am just upset with myself that I even thought that maybe this time <br/>
things would be different.  She has said some pretty rude things in <br/>
the past and I have tried to fanagle situations so that my kids are <br/>
never alone with my parents.  Well even though that has been <br/>
successful, she has now taken to behaving this way even in front of <br/>
my husband and children.  NO MORE for my kids...no big loss for them <br/>
they never liked her anyway cause she always yelled at them about <br/>
everything.  They couldn&#39;t ever do anything right!  No more grief <br/>
for me or my husband either.<br/>
<br/>
So much more but too hard to write...<br/>

<br/>
I think leaving in the middle of the night is an extremely valuable tactic.   <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When my sister stopped drinking it was because my mom (who had been sober for <br/>
a year or so of nine years eventually sobriety when this happened) and Kirby <br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>26 Nov 2005, at  1:28pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684809390">***I think leaving in the middle of the night is an extremely valuable tactic.  ***<br/>
<br/>
And not just in a family situation either.  There are other situations that can be abusive too.<br/>
<br/>
Over the summer I was a camp nurse in another state.  There was only one other nurse there and she had been there for a couple of weeks before me.<br/>
<br/>
At first things seemed ok, but after the first week it became apparent that all was not right with her. And there were others there that knew her (they were the ones who encouraged her to come and take the job) and would hint to me that she was taking advantage of me.  That in and of itself didn&#39;t bother me though.  I can do anything for 2 weeks.  I had 2 days off/week and I was getting paid.  Thats the best camp situation I&#39;ve ever had!!  I didn&#39;t mind if she felt the need to take advantage.  She&#39;d been the sole nurse for a couple of weeks before I got there, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt on that one.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately it went way beyond that.  She was very lax and told me she signed meds off whether she gave them or not (these are psychotropic drugs and/or controlled substances like Ritalin).  She wasn&#39;t &quot;withholding meds&quot; for any noble purpose.  She was either just sloppy in her work or she was skimming the meds for herself.<br/>
<br/>
She also told me she was using expensive medication from a counselor to give to her daughter because she &quot;couldn&#39;t afford&quot; to take her daughter to the doctor.  But she never told the counselor about it or asked if it was ok.<br/>
<br/>
She would tell me that both of us could take off the same day and let the nurse practitioner handle things the two days that the np was there.  It didn&#39;t feel right but she&#39;d been there longer than me so I said ok the first time, and asked her to call the NP the second time to make sure it was ok.<br/>
<br/>
And then one night she got nasty with me because I had correctly diagnosed a child with pneumonia (sent him to the doctor and it was confirmed) after she insisted she listens to lungs all the time and that his lungs were clear.  Later that evening she got nasty again when I gave her daughter a higher than usual dose of tylenol (it was a high dose, but one time wouldn&#39;t hurt anything).  <br/>
<br/>
It was just a gut feeling, but over the years my gut instincts have evolved to be very accurate.  I went to the director and told her what was going on...all of it. She mentioned she thought it was odd that we were both taking the same days off and leaving the np to work alone and I explained that I felt like I was being &quot;set up&quot; to take some sort of fall for something.<br/>
<br/>
The director wanted me to stay but I just knew that something really really bad would happen if I did.  This nurse kept her bedroom door locked (I couldn&#39;t lock mine).  And she said things to me that indicated that she had gone through my personal belongings.  This along with all of the above set off red flags that my nursing license might be in jeopardy unless I left.  And I was starting to feel like this woman was capable of just about anything.  <br/>
<br/>
The director wanted me to stay until morning but I could leave early if I wanted to.  I started packing at 11:30 that night and left at 2am. Fortunately my kids were ready to leave too.  They were fed up with some of the other aspects of the camp. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t regret leaving.  I do truly regret that it didn&#39;t work out.  I really enjoyed that camp, the counselors, and the kids.  But there are other camps and other kids and other nurses who aren&#39;t whack jobs.  <br/>

  My 6 year old Franki, who my s-mother particularly picked on while<br/>
  were there wanted to leave in the middle of the night. -=-<br/>
<br/>
  I think leaving in the middle of the night is an extremely valuable tactic.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  When my sister stopped drinking it was because my mom (who had been sober for <br/>
  a year or so of nine years eventually sobriety when this happened) and Kirby <br/>
  and I packed up and left aroung 10:00, I think, when we had been planning to <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****The problem wasn&#39;t that the kids were running around or sitting <br/>
with us or any other such thing that she could have considered <br/>
bothersome.  They were laying on the air mattress watching the t.v. <br/>
and it was around 10pm.  Her problem was that she was looking for <br/>
something else to have a problem with.  If they were sitting <br/>
somewhere being quiet then they would be accused of being too still <br/>
and too quiet...if they were running around they shouldn&#39;t do that <br/>
either. It just didn&#39;t matter what they did something about it was <br/>
wrong.  I guess I have learned that you can&#39;t please someone who <br/>
wants to be miserable and thrives on trying to make others <br/>
unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, my parents belong to the clean plate club.  We had a <br/>
talk with the children on the way down.  We would help them to serve <br/>
their plates. Don&#39;t put anything on your plate you are not willing <br/>
to eat all of.  If you want to try something you&#39;ve not had before <br/>
then take a tiny bite sized portion in case you don&#39;t like it.  You <br/>
can always go back for more if you find you like it.  <br/>
<br/>
The meal went okay for the most part and s-mother only made a couple <br/>
negative comments about things that the kids didn&#39;t put on their <br/>
plates.  However, once again with Franki we had a problem.  She <br/>
apparently (according to dh)kind of coerced Franki in to putting <br/>
green beans on her plate, along with fruit salad, mac and cheese and <br/>
turkey.  Well, I walked over to the table just in time to hear her <br/>
tell Franki that she couldn&#39;t have any more candy that night.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked her if it was because Franki hadn&#39;t eaten the green beans <br/>
(with bacon and almonds in them) and she said yes that all she eats <br/>
is candy.  I said that it wasn&#39;t true pointing that the green beans <br/>
were the only things she hadn&#39;t eaten and that the rest of her plate <br/>
was clean.  Well that didn&#39;t go over well either.  I ended up giving <br/>
Franki snacks out of the car when she got hungry later.  All the <br/>
other kids also politely refused candy when offered to them.  They <br/>
didn&#39;t like the way Franki was treated!  I was proud of their little <br/>
boycott on their sister&#39;s behalf, especially of candy considering <br/>
that they really like candy!!!<br/>

I have a hard time defending &quot;her&quot;.  Not all people who consume too <br/>
much alcohol are nasty(mean).  Some aren&#39;t at all.  Some just act <br/>
silly or stupid and some are nasty before they even take the first <br/>
drink and with her this is the case.  The alcohol just compounds the <br/>
problem.<br/>

There are gonna be many things that I can&#39;t protect my kids from, <br/>
some things I don&#39;t need to protect them from, but in cases like <br/>
this it is because I love them that I will not let another person(s) <br/>
treat them in ways that are disrespectful, hurtful and possibly even <br/>
manipulative and borderline abusive.  My father is welcome to see my <br/>
children so long as he doesn&#39;t try to make them feel guilty over why <br/>
I won&#39;t let her visit them.  The second he tries to insinuate that <br/>
my children somehow caused that and how awful it is for her when she <br/>
loves them so much, well then his name will go under hers in the no <br/>
visit list!!!<br/>

The truly saddest part of this whole thing is that they only see the <br/>
kids about 2x a year.  Who gives a damn if they eat all their food.  <br/>
What ever happened to grandparents that were only in it for spoiling <br/>
the kids.  My husband&#39;s mother spoils em rotten, spends all her time <br/>
with them when she&#39;s here cause she only sees them once a year.  She <br/>
would never get mad at them for not eating something.  If anything <br/>
she would probably sneak them a treat if I ever said no. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dh&#39;s mom has never threatened to spank my kids as s-mom did this <br/>
trip.  Even if we spanked (we don&#39;t), where does a relative get off <br/>
thinking they have a right to or even to threaten? Don&#39;t people just <br/>
know where the line is without crossing it to figure out when to <br/>
back off?<br/>

I have since written about some of the awful visit on the list.  <br/>
Sandra gave some really helpful feedback.  I am at this time <br/>
considering her idea of writing things down from this incident.  I <br/>
am trying to see the visit and each incident from their point of <br/>
view to try and understand why things happened but am struggling <br/>
with it a bit well more like a lot.  My father called and tried to <br/>
feel me out the night I got home but I just wasn&#39;t emotionally ready <br/>
to talk to him about it.  I didn&#39;t want to say things I would regret <br/>
and/or leave things that were important out of the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
I think writing all of what I can remember down, how I felt and how <br/>
the children and my husband conveyed they felt is a very good idea.  <br/>
So when it is discussed (probably soon) I will be less likely to <br/>
leave things out.  It will probably help me to not be quite so <br/>
emotional and more matter of fact.  I tend to get panicky and shakey <br/>
during confrontation then I forget half of what I wanted to say.  I <br/>
just want everyone to be happy and it just doesn&#39;t seem to work out <br/>
that way. <br/>
<br/>
My father is the type of person that when he gets angry with you he <br/>
holds a grudge and will go years without speaking to you.  I watched <br/>
him go 7 years without speaking to my brother then things seemed to <br/>
resolve until he got mad about something else and now it has been <br/>
almost 5 years again since he spoke to my brother. Honestly I am not <br/>
so sure that it is my father, but his wife that causes these rifts <br/>
to be more than they should be. Who knows, regardless it is <br/>
ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Life is too short to be pissed off and nasty to people over things <br/>
that are of no consequence to you.  For instance who cares what my <br/>
kids eat as long as they are healthy.  Is it something to freak out <br/>
over and cause a rift in a relationship (make your grandchildren <br/>
never want to see you)?  I don&#39;t think so, but it seems to me that I <br/>
am the only person on my side of the family that feels this way.<br/>
<br/>
My husbands family is very verbal.  If you make them mad they tell <br/>
you and then it is over.  Never holding grudges there!!!  Just get <br/>
it out and go on, the relationships are great in that family.<br/>

Thank you for this reply Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I really do fit this description with the parents.  My mother really <br/>
stunk when I was little but was amazing when I was older and now she <br/>
is gone.  She died two months after my second child was born.  I <br/>
miss her terribly.  My father and his wife are a nightmare and I am <br/>
sick of tip toeing on eggshells to maintain a relationship that <br/>
pretty much sucks anyway.  I don&#39;t know why I do it or maybe again I <br/>
do.  If I am honest it is because I long for a closeness that will <br/>
never be there.  My father will never be the Daddy I wanted and felt <br/>
I needed him to be.  Now, I am 33 and not so needy anymore and I <br/>
guess that is why I am less likely to continue trying to nurture a <br/>
miserable relationship.  If I have to live my life to his standards <br/>
and ideals in order to make him like/love me...it just ain&#39;t gonna <br/>
happen any more.  It still makes me sad that I never will have that <br/>
closeness that children should have with their parents, but I guess <br/>
it is time to get over it and go on with my life and let my children <br/>
live in peace without placing the same eggshells in their lives.  At <br/>
least through this life experience I am learning about how I DON&#39;T <br/>
want to be.<br/>

Maybe there is something to that as well.  Maybe we should try to <br/>
limit our overnight visiting to families who can more relate with <br/>
our philosophy of parenting.  Then again we don&#39;t really visit much <br/>
with anyone due to our never being close to family and our family <br/>
size makes it difficult for some people.  Some family and friends <br/>
have a hard time opening their doors to 7 people for an overnight.<br/>
<br/>
I think it must be overwhelming to them to think of boarding/feeding <br/>
all of us.  We offer food and stuff and bring pillows and sleeping <br/>
bags but then some take it in kind of an insulted way.  We know we <br/>
are alot and that is why we offer.  A dozen eggs sure don&#39;t go very <br/>
far and neither does a loaf of bread (VBG). We are probably better <br/>
getting a hotel, but sometimes it is not financially an option.  <br/>
Hmmm food for thought and future planning.  <br/>

wish you had.   When you decide how to be, you can have the thought that it <br/>
would have felt good to have someone do that for you when you were (whatever age <br/>
the child is).   Don&#39;t do it with grumpy resentment, but with a soothing <br/>
thought for the child inside you.    Then when you give your child a cookie, you&#39;re <br/>
giving your young self a cookie.   When you hold her in your lap and rock <br/>
just a little longer, you&#39;re rocking your childhood self.<br/>

This is wonderful advice.  I do some of this now, but never looked <br/>
at it this way.  I have friends who are in similar boats as me and I <br/>
am gonna share this advice with them.  It seems like all the time I <br/>
am doing things with my kids because I think it is fun and most of <br/>
the time they think (whatever it is)it&#39;s fun too.  <br/>
<br/>
The reward I get is them snuggling with me because they love me and <br/>
are grateful each in their own way for all the things that are good <br/>
in their lives.  The smiles on their faces are amazing.  When I <br/>
think of how I missed out on my childhood it makes me sad, but I <br/>
know that I have the opportunity to do my best to make all my kids <br/>
dreams come true.  <br/>
<br/>
I have fun with my kids probably because they unknowingly allow me <br/>
to be a kid again.  Not so much through them but with them.  Also I <br/>
like the idea of doing things for my kids with the heart of giving <br/>
that happiness to myself at the same times.  <br/>
<br/>
This makes me cry...I am so sentimental.  I am so sad for my <br/>
childhood, but I have the rest of my life ahead of me to be happy.  <br/>
I am also learning that I don&#39;t need others approval to be happy.  <br/>
Thanks so much Sandra for the time and thought you have put into <br/>
your responses to me.  You are amazingly insightful.  I never <br/>
actually intended for this topic to get this far, but I am thankful <br/>
now that it has.  <br/>
