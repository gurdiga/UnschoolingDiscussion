&lt;&lt;Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to let the homeschooling public know about a comment I <br/>
heard on Jay Leno Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2004. He started out speaking <br/>
about the teacher who was found nude in her car with her 14 year old <br/>
student. Jay went on to say how &quot;sick&quot; this was. Then he said, &quot;in <br/>
fact, I can&#39;t think of anything sicker than that except <br/>
homeschooling!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know about you all but I was EXTREMELY offended by this <br/>
comment. How dare he compare us to a child molester! I have vowed <br/>
NEVER to watch his show again unless he makes a public appology for <br/>
his demeaning and demoralizing comments. I also think it would be a <br/>
good thing for us homeschoolers to encourage Mr. Leno to investigate <br/>
and learn more about homeschooling and then feature a positive <br/>
segment on his show about the benefits of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to email Mr. Leno you can do so at tonightshow @ <br/>
nbc dot com.  I know I will be contacting him shortly.&gt;&gt;</div>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think sending something that might not even be correct to a really <br/>
big list will  help people get unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There are lists where people specialize in political action, and tell people <br/>
who to write to and what to say when they write, but I would like to keep this <br/>
list from being one of those if possible.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517126131">IF it is true and accurate - isn&#39;t this a sarcastic comment that really <br/>
is making fun of those who think homeschooling is harboring child <br/>
abusers? It wouldn&#39;t be funny otherwise and he IS a comedian.<br/>
<br/>
The joke comes from the irony that NBC jumped all over homeschoolers as <br/>
if we were all child abusers in their news series on homeschooling as a <br/>
cover for child abuse and then here is this story about a teacher and <br/>
student, and he is sarcastically saying, &quot;Oh yeah, the only thing thing <br/>
sicker is homeschooling.&quot; As IF!<br/>
<br/>
Sense of humor, people. Lighten up.<br/>
