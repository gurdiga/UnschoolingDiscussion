&quot;I hope that after a recent posting of Ned&#39;s, <br/>
everyone will give him the benefit of the doubt and &quot;listen&quot; to what <br/>
he is saying.   He must be a very passionate person about his <br/>
beliefs, and that is a wonderful thing.  And those who have taken <br/>
offense must be very passionate as well.  I love that high interest <br/>
and intelligence in people and hope to continue to see it on this <br/>
list.  But I truly hope one person will not be kicked off the list <br/>
for a bad choice of words or an all-consuming passion, or I might be <br/>
next for not vaccinating my children!  :o)   (or, at least, in <br/>
choosing *fighting words* to villify my beliefs!)<br/>
By the way, I&#39;m 42, and I kind of thought &quot;wussy&quot; just meant someone <br/>
not real brave, or that wouldn&#39;t stand up for what they believe!<br/>
Thanks to all of you for your stimulating conversations lately. <br/>

Thanks for this post Mary.  It said exactly what I&#39;ve been thinking.  I must<br/>
say that I&#39;m a little offended by the posters who claim to be protecting my<br/>
delicate newbie sensibilities.  I think that anyone who chooses to unschool is<br/>
most likely a brave sort, who makes up their own mind.  If I decided not to<br/>
unschool based on a disagreement on this list than I wasn&#39;t committed to it<br/>
anyway.    <br/>
<br/>
I thought unschooling was about learning by simply living, so I&#39;ve never<br/>
thought this list was about someone telling me HOW to unschool.  If it is,<br/>
than I don&#39;t need it.  But if it&#39;s about learning something new from different<br/>
people, with different perspectives and philosophies than I&#39;ll take it.  A<br/>
couple of weeks ago someone said this is a discussion group not a support<br/>
group, I hope it stays that way.  <br/>
