<div id="ygrps-yiv-144680858">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
So my son is still in school.  He has talked about wanting to finish first <br/>
grade before we homeschool/unschool, so I&#39;m remaining flexible.  (Now that I <br/>
feel ready, June seems a *long* time away.  But we&#39;ll see -- he might change his <br/>
mind.)  But I&#39;m discovering another barrier for me; maybe you can help?<br/>
<br/>
The why question.  In my imagination, the conversation goes like this.  I <br/>
(finally) say to his grandma, or the moms I know from school, &quot;Well, we&#39;re <br/>
pulling Fisher out of school.  We&#39;re going to homeschool now, we&#39;ve decided.&quot;  (Yes, <br/>
I don&#39;t even begin with the U word. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
And they say,  &quot;Really?  Why?&quot;  Or, &quot;I thought school was going well for <br/>
him?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I say, casting about in my mind to the tens of books and hundreds of <br/>
email posts that have gotten me here,  &quot;Well, see, it has to do with . . . No, let <br/>
me explain it another way . . . have you ever read . . .?  Hmmm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I want a 30 second answer to give.  The process of getting this far, of <br/>
course, has taken much more time -- lots of theories, ideas, soul-searching.  And <br/>
I&#39;m trying to hone it down to something I can share with other people that will <br/>
make some sense to them, without getting into a long overblown discussion <br/>
(though if they want to discuss it more after that, I will, of course) that <br/>
sounds like I&#39;m judging them for sending their kids to school.  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy<br/>

Don&#39;t say &quot;unschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t say anything unless it comes up naturally.<br/>
When it does you can say &quot;Oh, he&#39;s not going to school this year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true.  &quot;This year&quot; is not as scary as &quot;EVER AGAIN!&quot;<br/>
And you don&#39;t know that it&#39;s never again anyway.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I want a 30 second answer to give. &gt;&gt;<br/>

&quot;We&#39;re going to homeschool this year and see how it goes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re noisy after that, recommend books for them to read.  You don&#39;t <br/>
have to defend yourself.  Let their energy and curiosity lead them to some <br/>
natural learning!<br/>

self-directed in his learning before, and now I see him losing that -- caring <br/>
more about external motivation than intrinsic.  I don&#39;t want him to lose that.&quot; <br/>
 I would also love an answer that says (somehow) that unschooling is good for <br/>
everyone, that says something about how humans learn, but every answer I try <br/>
sounds preachy.  So I think along these lines will do quite nicely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791974095">Since Jayn is so young, when people ask me &quot;why&quot;, which is rare, they<br/>
get the brief history of my process to the decision: starting with my<br/>
distrust of schools and moving to mentioning Holt and Gatto, saying we<br/>
are on a few e-lists, and ending with &quot;we think it will be better for<br/>
us&quot;. The second question, if there is one, is &quot;What curriculum will you<br/>
be using?&quot; I tell them we are Unschoolers, and explain that it is<br/>
child-led natural learning. It seems pointless to go on about what she<br/>
can already &quot;do&quot; as that is schoolish thinking, although sometimes I do<br/>
talk about her own learning if the person actually seems interested in<br/>
Unschooling. I have to weigh whether the person is a stranger I will<br/>
never see again - they get the last line - or someone who we will meet<br/>
up with more often, like one of the other mothers at dance class. Our<br/>
families so far have been great - although dh father took the<br/>
opportunity to give us a &quot;needs socialization&quot; lecture once. This was<br/>
when she was something like 18 months old and laughing and playing with<br/>
anyone she met at his house. We just ignored his opinion, and now he has<br/>
passed on, so his thinking is even more irrelevant than it was before. I<br/>
think that families if supportive can be great allies, so perhaps they<br/>
deserve greater detail than &quot;the lady at the bus stop&quot;. I often send my<br/>
mother articles from the net, or websites, if she has a question. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I know, folks who really care about you and your family will press for <br/>
more answers.   To be totally honest with you.  All of the &quot;30 second&quot; answers <br/>
that folks have suggested are good .. but you probably will never get away <br/>
with a 30 second answer to your close friends and family.    They always want <br/>
you to expound, explain, example... And you will do this over and over til you <br/>
feel like you will EXplode.. LOL.     I&#39;ve been through it.. probably even more <br/>
of a third degree than you will get, since my kids were older and had been in <br/>
school longer.     The main thing is to answer with confidence.  Behave like <br/>
you really believe in your decision, and make it clear that the decision is <br/>
out of love and concern for your child.    Don&#39;t waver and don&#39;t cave under <br/>
pressure... BE STRONG!   I think its great that you are thinking ahead and <br/>
devising a plan before you are barraged with questions.. Being prepared gives you a <br/>
good base for quick responses and solid answers. And, if all else fails and <br/>
they continue to question and &quot;harrass&quot; you just respond by saying,.  &quot;Because we <br/>
want to.. pppbbbbtttttt  (raspberry)&quot;   Stick your fingers in your ears and <br/>
wiggle your tongue, that helps too.    :-) <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>30 second answer:<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;It was going well for him, but I realized I was missing <br/>
out on all these great educational leaps! I&#39;ve spent hundreds of <br/>
hours reading and thinking about homeschooling and came to <br/>
the conclusion that it was too tempting not to try it. Fisher is up <br/>
for it, so we&#39;ll keep you posted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another one:<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of learning alongside my kids. I started reading <br/>
books, visiting Internet sites and meeting other homeschoolers. <br/>
Their success and enthusiasm are contagious. Did you know <br/>
that over 1 million families homeschool in America? So we <br/>
decided to &quot;take the plunge.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Last one:<br/>
<br/>
(I used to say something like this a lot... sort of took the edge <br/>
off...)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Did you know that secretly, most homeschooling mothers are <br/>
closet-learning addicts? We say we&#39;re doing it for our kids, but <br/>
really, we just love any excuse to read good books, study history, <br/>
go to art museums, observe nature and watch movies. The <br/>
bonus? Our kids happen to grow up learning alongside us and <br/>
loving it too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;d say that, sometimes a mom would get a funny look in <br/>
her eye. But the benefit was that I put it on me (that it was my <br/>
obsession) so that the mom in question didn&#39;t have to justify that <br/>
her child was getting a good education in spite of going to <br/>
school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938771212">Julie, I like your replies but the one big problem I see with your last one at least in my experience is if you let people think you are doing this for &quot;YOU&quot; then they get their backs all up about having to cut the apron ties. I could see a lot of people I know thinking I was putting my desires before my children if I gave them that answer. I&#39;d get the old &quot;well you have to let them grow up some time&quot;. They would think that just because I like learning along side my kids I&#39;m letting my kids &quot;MISS OUT&quot; on all that &quot;FUN&quot; and other stuff that happens at school.lol. We know that isn&#39;t true but parents who send their kids there every day want to believe there is lots of fun stuff and a social reason to send your kids. Just a thought.<br/>

  In my imagination, the conversation goes like this.  I <br/>
  &gt; (finally) say to his grandma, or the moms I know from school, <br/>
  &quot;Well, we&#39;re <br/>
  &gt; pulling Fisher out of school.  We&#39;re going to homeschool now, <br/>
  we&#39;ve decided.&quot;  (Yes, <br/>
  &gt; I don&#39;t even begin with the U word. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; And they say,  &quot;Really?  Why?&quot;  Or, &quot;I thought school was going <br/>
  well for <br/>
  &gt; him?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  30 second answer:<br/>
<br/>
  How about &quot;It was going well for him, but I realized I was missing <br/>
  out on all these great educational leaps! I&#39;ve spent hundreds of <br/>
  hours reading and thinking about homeschooling and came to <br/>
  the conclusion that it was too tempting not to try it. Fisher is up <br/>
  for it, so we&#39;ll keep you posted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Another one:<br/>
<br/>
  I love the idea of learning alongside my kids. I started reading <br/>
  books, visiting Internet sites and meeting other homeschoolers. <br/>
  Their success and enthusiasm are contagious. Did you know <br/>
  that over 1 million families homeschool in America? So we <br/>
  decided to &quot;take the plunge.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  Last one:<br/>
<br/>
  (I used to say something like this a lot... sort of took the edge <br/>
  off...)<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Did you know that secretly, most homeschooling mothers are <br/>
  closet-learning addicts? We say we&#39;re doing it for our kids, but <br/>
  really, we just love any excuse to read good books, study history, <br/>
  go to art museums, observe nature and watch movies. The <br/>
  bonus? Our kids happen to grow up learning alongside us and <br/>
  loving it too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  When I&#39;d say that, sometimes a mom would get a funny look in <br/>
  her eye. But the benefit was that I put it on me (that it was my <br/>
  obsession) so that the mom in question didn&#39;t have to justify that <br/>
  her child was getting a good education in spite of going to <br/>
  school.<br/>

&lt;&lt; All of the &quot;30 second&quot; answers <br/>
that folks have suggested are good .. but you probably will never get away <br/>
with a 30 second answer to your close friends and family.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the first answer is lame, though, they have you on your back <br/>
(feline-wrestling-speaking) so a strong first answer puts THEM on the quieter more <br/>
defensive side.<br/>
<br/>
The great advantage of &quot;We&#39;re going to try this for a while and see how it <br/>
works&quot; is that if they secretly hope you fail, they can merrily skip away with <br/>
their secret hope.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; They always want <br/>
you to expound, explain, example... And you will do this over and over til <br/>
you <br/>
feel like you will EXplode..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not if you have a ready response to say &quot;discussion over until you read some <br/>
more about it yourself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of those is &quot;I read a whole lot about it before I decided.  Do you want <br/>
to read some of that stuff?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If their answer is &quot;NO, I just want to torment YOU&quot; (in a nicer form) you can <br/>
say no, they need to know more before they can really discuss it, or that if <br/>
they read some of what you read they would understand it better.<br/>
<br/>
It worked with my inflexible mother-in-law who was a nurse from the 1940&#39;s to <br/>
the 1980&#39;s (with a break to over-manage her children&#39;s every move), about why <br/>
we didn&#39;t have Kirby circumcised, and about homeschooling too.<br/>
<br/>
She DID read the stuff, and it shushed her.<br/>
But she might not have read the stuff if I hadn&#39;t physically handed it to her <br/>
and said if she wanted to read that first we could discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
The reading won both times.  <br/>
(That and the physical realities.  He never had any infections or loss of <br/>
mental or social function.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Being prepared gives you a <br/>
good base for quick responses and solid answers. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely true, and planning your responses so that they end the <br/>
conversation in your favor is helpful to everyone involved, because those asking the <br/>
questions really do want to believe you know what you&#39;re doing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I liked them too!  Unfortunately, there are some people for whom no matter what reason you give, they will still think that sending all kids to school is better.  So, might as well find an answer that you feel comfortable with.  (Given that we can&#39;t please everyone with our reasons, isn&#39;t it best that our reasons are useful to us? hee, hee)<br/>
<br/>
Several people have asked me lately if I will let my kids go to school if they want to.  I stumbled through an answer, but the next I&#39;m asked, my reply will be, &quot;Will you let your kids homeschool if they want to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me of Dear Abby&#39;s pat answer: &quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;<br/>

GOOD IDEA!<br/>
<br/>
I would honestly be able to say &quot;Yes I would,  but I bet you wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
yours homeschool.&quot;<br/>

if there will be more discussion, I can begin it on the right foot.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you for the great versions of 30 second answers -- so work <br/>
with my personality, some don&#39;t, but they all gave me great food for thought.  <br/>
*And* I called my son&#39;s school principal today to ask him if Fisher could <br/>
still attend specials (art, music, gym) if I homeschooled him.  (I heard of <br/>
another homeschooler doing this, and Fisher currently *loves* the specials at <br/>
school.)  He said no, as I thought he would, but it was a good first step for me in <br/>
quickly explaining what I was thinking to someone on the &quot;outside.&quot;  So <br/>
thanks!<br/>
