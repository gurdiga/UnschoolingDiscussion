<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096350915">Wow, do I have a lot to say today! Feel free to tell me to shut up <br/>
and go away for a while!<br/>
<br/>
My ds, who is 10 and will be 11 in August has a paper route. This has <br/>
been a fantastic experience for him. He&#39;s making friends with all <br/>
sorts of neighbors. He&#39;s got this 94 yo buddy who lives alone and is <br/>
thrilled to see him every day. He&#39;s handling his own money, very <br/>
wisely, I might add. He&#39;s learned to organize his time. He&#39;s becoming <br/>
independent about making decisions. It&#39;s all been great.<br/>
<br/>
But today these middle schoolers bullied him. He doesn&#39;t know them. <br/>
They sometimes follow him on his route on their bikes or make stupid <br/>
comments. Part of the problem is his route time happens to be right <br/>
when middle school gets out. His papers come right at that time and <br/>
he has to be done by 5, so he can&#39;t wait for the middle school kids <br/>
to get home and off the streets.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, one kid rear-ended Erik (on bikes). Erik heard them <br/>
saying, &quot;He&#39;s a wimp; let&#39;s get him!&quot; And he saw them speed up. So he <br/>
jumped off his bike (scraping his knee) just a fraction of a second <br/>
before the one kid rammed into his bike. Smart move, I thought. Then, <br/>
he grabbed a  snow shovel lying in the yard where they were and <br/>
reached out with the shovel and flipped off each of the three boys&#39; <br/>
baseball caps with the handle. While they were retrieving their caps, <br/>
he ran to Grandma&#39;s house and got a bandaid for his knee and waited <br/>
until the kids left the sidewalk in front of Grandma&#39;s where they <br/>
were waiting for him. Then he finished his route. But just as he was <br/>
coming home, they came for him again. He rode fast, ran into the <br/>
house and the boys left. <br/>
<br/>
Then a guy called and said he didn&#39;t get his paper. No surprise, <br/>
considering how distracted Erik must have been. Erik went out with <br/>
the snow shovel from our garage this time, and the boys appeared <br/>
again and surrounded him on their bikes. He did the baseball cap <br/>
thing again and got away. I asked why they weren&#39;t prepared this time <br/>
for the cap thing and he says they just aren&#39;t too bright. I&#39;m <br/>
guessing maybe they thought it was funny the first time and let him <br/>
do it again?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... tomorrow and after... I&#39;m worried these boys will get him <br/>
and beat him up or something. I&#39;m torn between leaving him to defend <br/>
himself with his cleverness against their numbers and size or maybe <br/>
going with him on the route? He has any number of houses to run to if <br/>
the boys come after him when he&#39;s not on Grandma&#39;s street. In fact, <br/>
earlier this winter, the boys were chasing him and he went into a <br/>
neighbor&#39;s house to wait it out. Am I exposing him to danger by <br/>
allowing him to keep the route? I don&#39;t want to baby him or <br/>
overprotect him, but I thought bullying was a thing of the past when <br/>
I took him out of school!</div>

<div><font face="Pooh">Bullies are everywhere, not just on the school playgrounds 
or inside the school. Does your son have a friend that would be willing to go 
with him on his route? A older cousin, brother, etc? I think for your son&#39;s 
sake, it would be much better if mom did not tag along. Also you might want to 
call the newspaper that your son delivers, explain the situation and ask if they 
could deliver the papers earlier so your son can be done with the route earlier? 
In our town, the carriers deliver the paper in the mornings, not at night so its 
much easier. Ask your son how he would like to solve this problem and tell him 
how you feel. Maybe between the two of you, you might be able to come up with 
some workable solutions.</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117937822"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font COLOR="#8080c0" SIZE="2" FAMILY="SCRIPT" FACE="Fine Hand"><b>May I offer a suggestion as a mother whose sons deal with bullies on a 
<br>regular basis? Call the police and tell them what is going on. Ask them to be 
<br>at the middle school at the time your son will be and ask him to speak to 
<br>these boys and get their names and he will go to their homes and speak to 
<br>their families. We live in a village in NE Ohio and just moved in last June. 
<br>In this time my sons have had MANY problems simply because they are the &quot;new 
<br>kids.&quot; I finally got tired of the confrontations and now I call the police. 
<br>Today a group of 3 boys stopped my sons and 2 of their friends and called 
<br>names &amp; asked them (my boys and their friends) to meet them up at the school 
<br>at 2p. They came home and told me and I phoned the police who went up to the 
<br>school at 2p, instead of my boys and their friends, and spoke to them. The 
<br>police here are trying to stop the fighting....in March there was a situation 
<br>where my boys were confronted by 3 OTHER boys and a fight followed (we do not 
<br>tolerate or encourage physical confrontations or verbal confrontations and 
<br>ask the boys to walk away but at times human emotions take over) and the 
<br>police were called. The 3 other boys and my boys and their families (4 
<br>families all together) had to attend a meeting up at Town Hall to discuss the 
<br>situation and to rectify it. All 7 boys were told by the police that if ANY 
<br>of them were in 1 more fight EVER they would end up processed at the police 
<br>dept.. The other 3 boys have already ended up processed. Mine have not. The 
<br>police are aware that I will call EVERY time there is a problem and they 
<br>encourage me to do so. And I will, believe me.
<br>
<br>Also....my 10yo will be 11 in August and there is NO WAY he could handle 
<br>himself against a group of middle school aged children. I wouldn&#39;t allow to 
<br>even be in this situation alone. If your son were 13-14 I would say, don&#39;t 
<br>baby him. But your son is 10 and these children are much older and 10 is 
<br>really not old enough to deal with these things. I would go with my son OR I 
<br>would call the police. 
<br>
<br>Just my thoughts.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155177859">In a lot of the states the schools are technically liable for activities<br/>
(good and bad) from the door of the school to when they return home.  Maybe<br/>
talking to the school about the boys would help.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when the kidlets had their daily routes they requested that they be<br/>
first on the drop order and that might be an option.  On days when they<br/>
really needed to get the papers done earlier than usual, I went and picked<br/>
them up which might also be an option.<br/>
<br/>
While I would think he would do just fine relying on wits in a one to one<br/>
situation, the bully pack instinct usually goes from threatening to<br/>
dangerously violent when they are made to look the fool.  I would be<br/>
seriously concerned.<br/>

&gt; Wow, do I have a lot to say today! Feel free to tell me to shut up<br/>
&gt; and go away for a while!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My ds, who is 10 and will be 11 in August has a paper route. This has<br/>
&gt; been a fantastic experience for him. He&#39;s making friends with all<br/>
&gt; sorts of neighbors. He&#39;s got this 94 yo buddy who lives alone and is<br/>
&gt; thrilled to see him every day. He&#39;s handling his own money, very<br/>
&gt; wisely, I might add. He&#39;s learned to organize his time. He&#39;s becoming<br/>
&gt; independent about making decisions. It&#39;s all been great.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But today these middle schoolers bullied him. He doesn&#39;t know them.<br/>
&gt; They sometimes follow him on his route on their bikes or make stupid<br/>
&gt; comments. Part of the problem is his route time happens to be right<br/>
&gt; when middle school gets out. His papers come right at that time and<br/>
&gt; he has to be done by 5, so he can&#39;t wait for the middle school kids<br/>
&gt; to get home and off the streets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, one kid rear-ended Erik (on bikes). Erik heard them<br/>
&gt; saying, &quot;He&#39;s a wimp; let&#39;s get him!&quot; And he saw them speed up. So he<br/>
&gt; jumped off his bike (scraping his knee) just a fraction of a second<br/>
&gt; before the one kid rammed into his bike. Smart move, I thought. Then,<br/>
&gt; he grabbed a  snow shovel lying in the yard where they were and<br/>
&gt; reached out with the shovel and flipped off each of the three boys&#39;<br/>
&gt; baseball caps with the handle. While they were retrieving their caps,<br/>
&gt; he ran to Grandma&#39;s house and got a bandaid for his knee and waited<br/>
&gt; until the kids left the sidewalk in front of Grandma&#39;s where they<br/>
&gt; were waiting for him. Then he finished his route. But just as he was<br/>
&gt; coming home, they came for him again. He rode fast, ran into the<br/>
&gt; house and the boys left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then a guy called and said he didn&#39;t get his paper. No surprise,<br/>
&gt; considering how distracted Erik must have been. Erik went out with<br/>
&gt; the snow shovel from our garage this time, and the boys appeared<br/>
&gt; again and surrounded him on their bikes. He did the baseball cap<br/>
&gt; thing again and got away. I asked why they weren&#39;t prepared this time<br/>
&gt; for the cap thing and he says they just aren&#39;t too bright. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; guessing maybe they thought it was funny the first time and let him<br/>
&gt; do it again?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway... tomorrow and after... I&#39;m worried these boys will get him<br/>
&gt; and beat him up or something. I&#39;m torn between leaving him to defend<br/>
&gt; himself with his cleverness against their numbers and size or maybe<br/>

&gt; earlier this winter, the boys were chasing him and he went into a<br/>

&gt; allowing him to keep the route? I don&#39;t want to baby him or<br/>
&gt; overprotect him, but I thought bullying was a thing of the past when<br/>
&gt; I took him out of school!<br/>

<br>In my experiences the boys get bullied MORE now than my older 2 did when they

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780338734">First, I would tell him to cut out ANY activity with a snow shovel.  That&#39;s a <br/>
weapon, and a potentially lethal one, even if it&#39;s plastic.  Aiming it toward <br/>
anyone&#39;s head could cause some eye-out, brain-damage death.  That shouldn&#39;t <br/>
have been repeated.<br/>
<br/>
Even if your child were an expert in hat removal with a snow shovel, the <br/>
other kids could lunge, or turn, or jump, and get hurt very badly.<br/>
<br/>
If your son has a snowshovel, they will seem justified in bringing one too, <br/>
or a bat or a stick, or some other big weapon.  <br/>
<br/>
Driving the route isn&#39;t a horror.  But sending another kid with him is a <br/>
possibility.  If you could get photographs of the boys who are bullying him, <br/>
that might be really useful.  Do you have a telephoto lens and a place to <br/>
park unobtrusively?  Speaking with their parents once you have photos might <br/>
help--not angry and accusing, just ask them to make sure their boys leave <br/>
yours alone when he&#39;s on his paper route, and other times too.  You could <br/>
tell them homeschoolers aren&#39;t used to bullies, and they might consider that <br/>
homeschooling would help their own kids&#39; attitudes.  (That&#39;s kind of a dream, <br/>
but it happens from time to time in unexpected situations.)<br/>
<br/>
But back to the serious problem of the shovel--if he picks up a weapon, those <br/>
kids could do something pretty bad and call it self defense.  I&#39;d get my son <br/>
out of the situation altogether (no paper route if necessary) rather than <br/>
allow or encourage him to escalate it by taking up a weapon (even if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t intend to use it as a weapon per se).<br/>

he will only be able to protect himself so far, especially if there are many

and go after him worse when you are not there.&nbsp;Do you&nbsp;know their

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298142133">You definitely have reason to worry, I would too. We have always had trouble <br/>
with bullies and very rude public school kids. ( even at Bible School) Here <br/>
they have summer recreation activities that are sponsored by each towns, not <br/>
schools. When the kids were younger they liked to go. They could ride the bus <br/>
and go to swimming lessons, ice skating, baseball games, and etc. When my <br/>
older two girls (age 9 and 11) went alone they complained that the kids <br/>
teases them on the bus. It ruined the whole trip. So I had an idea. In order <br/>
for my younger boys to go a parent was required to go too. So I going to <br/>
using the boys as my excuse to be there and the public school kids cooled it <br/>
some. The girls seemed so glad to have me there. Once when we were at an <br/>
arcade a big kid (twice my oldest girls size) bullied her. While my oldest <br/>
was waiting in line for tickets, with her littlest brother, this boy came <br/>
along and physically shoved her to the floor as hard as he could. She told me <br/>
later that she is not sure what happened next as instinct just kicked in. (5 <br/>
yrs of karate by that time) She said she was off the floor before she hardly <br/>
touched it, she stepped in front of little brother, turned and nailed the <br/>
bully with a palm strike. The good news was that right before the palm strike <br/>
hit him in the nose she pulled it back (could have broke his nose). The bad <br/>
news was that one of her fingernails did catch his face accidentally and give <br/>
him a bad scratch. I had no idea any of this was going on as I was with the <br/>
other two kids. Suddenly the youngest was there crying that his sister had <br/>
been taken away for fighting. I found her being chewed out by the supervisor <br/>
of the group (school teacher). She did not like that at all. Then the older <br/>
brother of the bully came and called me every swearing name you could think <br/>
of. Said we would be hearing from their parents and lawyer. I said, we are in <br/>
the book, please tell them to call. The bully was sitting there crying his <br/>
eyes out. That was a little amusing to see. Now I do not condone fighting but <br/>
self defense is self defense. The bully&#39;s family has four children that are <br/>
all very large and tower over all the kids. They are bullies to everyone. <br/>
Later at home dad said, if you are going to get in trouble anyway you should <br/>
have nailed him good. We never received the calls but we did stop going to <br/>
rec activities because my kids said they were not worth the hassles. Too bad. <br/>
Later I learned that my oldest was very scared of running into that bully <br/>
with a big group of his peers and not being able to defend herself and her <br/>
siblings. She always felt that defending her siblings was up to her. We do <br/>
not live in town so it never happened and now years have passed and all is <br/>
well. I am not sure what I would do if I were you. I agree with Sandra that <br/>
the shovel is a bad idea. They may take it from him and hit him with it. <br/>
Trying to get the papers earlier and deliver them sooner is a good idea. I <br/>
would talk to the paper office and see if they have any ideas. After all they <br/>
want those papers delivered and good help is hard to find. If nothing else <br/>
works I would probably suggest quitting. Sad, but I would be that concerned <br/>
for his safety. <br/>
<br/>
You may ask your son if he would be interested in taking martial arts <br/>
classes. Not to fight but it really builds self esteem and they do teach some <br/>
great self defense techniques. My kids love them and have been in classes for <br/>
many years. I take classes too. I know that they will not help in this <br/>
situation. Martial arts changed my two boys, for the better, but that is <br/>
another story.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-254172615">I&#39;ve been reading everyone&#39;s great thoughts about my<br/>
son&#39;s paper route. I love the idea of taking a<br/>
picture. One problem is that Erik doesn&#39;t know their<br/>
names, so I can&#39;t talk to their parents. But, some<br/>
other kids were around the second time, and we&#39;ve told<br/>
him to ask those kids what the bullies&#39; names are. We<br/>
didn&#39;t know he brought the shovel the second time. In<br/>
fact, I wouldn&#39;t have let him go alone the second<br/>
time, but I had just told him to go pick up some books<br/>
he&#39;d put on hold from the library (a block away in the<br/>
other direction) and that&#39;s where I thought he was<br/>
heading. I guess I was NOT being aware. My husband<br/>
sort of pointed that out. <br/>
<br/>
Erik says he&#39;s not afraid of the bullies. But I liked<br/>
the idea of driving the route, not with him, but sort<br/>
of following and watching in a way that the bullies<br/>
wouldn&#39;t know I was with him. And I&#39;ll have a camera.<br/>
Just in case. <br/>
<br/>
I should have thought of the picture. Here&#39;s one of<br/>
those school stories I was asked not to tell, but this<br/>
one is relevant here. Erik was in second grade gym<br/>
class, horsing around in a non-violent but silly way<br/>
with a boy. The gym teacher apparently called the<br/>
boys, who didn&#39;t hear her. So she marched over and<br/>
GRABBED them by the front collars of their shirts,<br/>
GOUGING four DEEP scratches into Erik&#39;s neck with her<br/>
fingernails. When he got home, my husband took LOTS of<br/>
pictures, and we brought these to the principal. Turns<br/>
out there was a student education major observing<br/>
there who would NOT stand up for the gym teacher.<br/>
That, with the pictures, got the teacher in trouble,<br/>
but not much. One of the things that led us to<br/>
homeschooling... <br/>

on is about making oneself &#39;difficult and dangerous prey.&#39;  Even non-<br/>
martial T&#39;ai Chi will alter one&#39;s bearing and posture to make one <br/>
seem a more formidable opponent, and while I wouldn&#39;t advocate <br/>
changing oneself solely because someone else takes exception to how <br/>
you look (or whatever) I think this is important to know.  <br/>
<br/>
Confidence shows in so many ways, when you have it.  I know that <br/>
greater numbers will always be a problem, but still, we can all make <br/>
ourselves &#39;difficult and dangerous prey&#39; in lots of different ways :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55316129">If this was being done to an adult, the adult would call the police.  I <br/>
find it so sad that kids in our society have to deal with things like this <br/>
and feel helpless to put a real stop to the problem.  I believe you should <br/>
call the police, try to find out who the kids are so their parents can be <br/>
contacted, and maybe try speaking to the kids themselves.  Also, some schools <br/>
have a policy that if kids are doing things like that on their way home from <br/>
school, they can still be disciplined by the school, so again, if you could <br/>
find out who they are...My parents work at a middle school and a lot of <br/>
times, they use or have others use the school yearbook if they don&#39;t know the <br/>
names.<br/>
     Your son sounds like a great kid!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125499148">We went on a spy mission! The papers actually came<br/>
early, but when it was time for school to get out,<br/>
Aubrey and I got in the van and discreetly followed<br/>
Erik. When he was finished, we followed him home and<br/>
he got in the van. Then we parked in an unobtrusive<br/>
spot and watched for kids. A pack of five boys came<br/>
along, and Erik thought one of them might be one of<br/>
the bullies, but he couldn&#39;t tell because the baseball<br/>
cap was shading his eyes. So we went around the<br/>
corner, and I parked, and Erik and Aubrey got out and<br/>
nonchalantly walked past the group, while I was ready<br/>
to spring out of the van, snapping photos and looking<br/>
intimidating. But it wasn&#39;t the right boy. After they<br/>
passed the boys, Aubrey grabbed Erik and was giving<br/>
him a noogie when I pullled up, so I snapped some<br/>
pictures of them, and as they climbed in, I said, &quot;I<br/>
got it! A picture of the bully! The little one in the<br/>
pink socks!&quot; They laughed.<br/>
<br/>
If and when our spy mission succeeds, we&#39;ll try to<br/>
follow the boys home without them noticing, so I&#39;ll<br/>
know where to find the parents. If that doesn&#39;t work,<br/>
we&#39;ll take the pictures to the school to find out who<br/>
they are. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help on this, and I&#39;ll shut up about it<br/>
now unless the spy mission succeeds.  Juli<br/>

<br>Luckily my guys know to come and tell me the minute there is violence being 
<br>suggested. It took awhile to get the message from their ears to their brains, 
<br>though. They didn&#39;t want to be teased (at their ages, especially the teens) 
<br>for running home and telling &quot;mommy and daddy&quot; but they finally understand 
<br>that being safe is far more important the names kids may call them for 
<br>telling my dh and I. Our police dept. is very concerned about the amount of 
<br>fighting around here and want to stop it (we live in a village of about 1500 
<br>people ). Sadly most of the parents of these bullies could care less that 
<br>their children (boys AND girls) are this way. I can&#39;t even tell you how many 
<br>times my sons have been physically attacked by GIRLS and the boys &nbsp;tell me 
<br>how unfair that is, if boys can&#39;t hit girls then girls shouldn&#39;t be allowed 
<br>to hit boys. I HAVE tried talking to parents....it has never worked.
<br>
<br>So many of the kids around here labeled as trouble makers AREN&#39;T (mine have 
<br>this label).....they are kids that eventually get tired of the names other 
<br>kids call their parents/comments they make about their parents (especially 
<br>me...comments like &quot;how much does your mom charge&quot;, &quot;does your mom take a 
<br>credit card--after last night I want a running bill&quot;, etc..) , them (my sons 
<br>have heard MANY racist comments based on their being Jewish) and they &quot;stand 
<br>up for themselves&quot;. OR...the bullies tell their story and sound all innocent.
<br>
<br>I believe in the &quot;it takes a village to raise up a child&quot; philosophy and I 
<br>WELCOME the kids labeled as trouble makers in to my home. The 3 boys my older 
<br>2 sons hang around with (the 5 of them are a group of close friends) are 
<br>called trouble makers and they come here every single day, have spent the 
<br>night a few times and they LOVE being here. I always tell them how much I 
<br>appreciate them following our rules, tell them what great kids they are, etc. 
<br>and their faces just shine.....2 of the boys do NOT get this at home! I told 
<br>one &quot;if I ever find out you got in a fight, you aren&#39;t coming here anymore&quot; 
<br>and you know what? he has been walking away from confrontations, not mouthing 
<br>off back to name callers, etc.. He likes coming here too much to mess it up. 
<br>Last night we had 2 of the boys stay the night and they wanted to stay again 
<br>tonight!
<br>
<br>Anyway...sorry for rambling. It&#39;s late and I get a little hot under the 
<br>collar when I think of how many bullies wouldn&#39;t be bullies if they just had 
<br>parents who cared enough to say enough when a parent tells them what their 
<br>child has done instead of say &quot;not my kid&quot;. If an adult came here and told me 
<br>my boys had done something wrong you can bet that I would listen to them and 
<br>I would have a long talk with me sons!

     Wow, you sound like a great influence in these kids&#39; lives and in your <br/>
town.  If more people took your approach, it really would have a major <br/>
impact.  I have run into the mentality you describe with the parents of the <br/>
bullies, back when we lived in neighborhoods. (We live out in the boondocks <br/>
now so we drive into town for park days and other things with the homeschool <br/>
group.)  It&#39;s not surprising that something is lacking in the parents of the <br/>
worst bullies.  I know that kids can learn some mean behaviors from other <br/>
kids but when kids make racist comments and are particularly cruel and <br/>
violent, I have usually found that they&#39;ve learned most of those attitudes <br/>
from their parents.<br/>
     If the parents are totally uncooperative and there aren&#39;t any words that <br/>
seem to be reaching the kids, I would still believe in going to the police <br/>
and the school.  But what you&#39;re accomplishing with the kids you can reach is <br/>
definitely the best solution!<br/>
