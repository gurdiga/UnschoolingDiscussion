<div id="ygrps-yiv-263494354">Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t help you with theatre groups in D.C. but I can happily announce<br/>
that we have an excellent homeschool theatre group here in Saskatoon,<br/>
Sk. Canada.  It&#39;s even expanded into its own talent agency...<br/>
So if you need to connect with other resource people just let me know!<br/>

&gt; I used to correspond with someone named Jean who had a homeschool theater group near Washington, D.C. We were about to exchange some video tapes of each other&#39;s productions when I had big computer problems and lost her address.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have any of you heard of such a person? I seem to remember she got into some disputes with people who thought she was excluding kids who didn&#39;t homeschool--I think she was even mentioned in Newsweek at one time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any tips....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
