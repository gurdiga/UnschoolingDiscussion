I&#39;m not an unschooler. I am looking into the possibility of it. We<br/>
Homeschool through a public charter and have had many unpleasant surprises<br/>
from well-meaning teacher relatives and strangers. They all think it&#39;s OK to<br/>
challenge you or your kids&#39; intelligence, socialization or lonliness<br/>
quotient,  level of knowledge, and logic. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The school teacher relatives were the worst. Fortunately, they cornered my<br/>
older and more articulate dd to challenge. They found out what a huge<br/>
mistake they made. She got an A in logic from community college at 14 yo.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be interested in reading your paper.<br/>

All the best,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Stacey,<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest perusing www.sandradodd.com, where unschooling information<br/>
is plentiful. Answering such a general question would take a lot of time and<br/>
effort, and when this information is already available online, it seems an<br/>
easy way for you to get what you&#39;re looking for.<br/>
<br/>
For us, I don&#39;t recall social barriers outside of ones any homeschooler may<br/>
encounter (people asking &quot;how do you socialize if you&#39;re not in school&quot; and<br/>
&quot;what curriculum do you use&quot;). But that was never a barrier...often an<br/>
opener for sharing information. Of course, there are lots of misconceptions,<br/>
but they weren&#39;t mine so it was never a problem for us.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As for social barriers, there isn&#39;t any way for non-homeschooling  <br/>
people to know how we homeschool unless we tell them. I tell people  <br/>
that we follow her interests and that seems to satisfy them.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers in the Bible-belt, though, often have problems since the  <br/>
majority of homeschoolers are schooling at home for religious  <br/>
reasons. Finding people who are comfortable around unschoolers can be  <br/>
a challenge for them.<br/>
<br/>
The misconceptions are legion. I&#39;ve been responding to those for  <br/>
years and collected a lot of answers at:<br/>
