<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609191793">Hi --<br/>
<br/>
Well - I&#39;ve been missing for a week, tomorrow. We had a fire in our  <br/>
garage (started in the dryer motor). The garage is attached to the  <br/>
house - we smelled smoke, opened the garage door (a big heavy metal- <br/>
backed fire door) and the garage was filled with flames, floor to  <br/>
rafters. My husband BRILLIANTLY slammed the door shut and yelled,  <br/>
&quot;Everybody get out NOW!&quot; He grabbed the phone and threw it to me and  <br/>
I dialed 911. Roya grabbed the dog and shoved her out the front door  <br/>
and then she grabbed the brand-new little baby hamster that I got for  <br/>
my birthday. We all stood on the front sidewalk, watching the smoke  <br/>
pouring from the entire house and flames above the garage. I thought  <br/>
the house was lost, but the fire department put it out pretty  <br/>
quickly. Only the garage really burned - but the rest of the house  <br/>
filled with smoke.<br/>
<br/>
So - here is what my kids are getting to experience:<br/>
<br/>
1. VERY close quarters. We&#39;ve been in a hotel for a week - five of  <br/>
us, a large dog, a tiny hamster, plus a couple of friends who have  <br/>
spent a lot of time here. Good thing we LIKE each other. Good thing  <br/>
all those things &quot;they say&quot; about teenagers are not true - they&#39;re  <br/>
not totally self-centered, they don&#39;t have &quot;attitude problems,&quot; they  <br/>
care about each other and about their parents and they are doing what  <br/>
they can to make this difficult time, not just bearable, but actually  <br/>
something of an adventure. Not one of them has complained at all.  <br/>
Most of their belongings are not going to be returned for 3 to 9  <br/>
months - they&#39;re just glad we&#39;re all together. They are &quot;rising to  <br/>
the occasion&quot; with flying colors! Far from us being at each other&#39;s  <br/>
throats, like people seem to expect, it has brought us closer to each  <br/>
other - reminded us to appreciate each other.<br/>
<br/>
2. A LOT of people have asked the kids if they &quot;had to miss any  <br/>
school.&quot; They act like THAT would be either the best or the worst  <br/>
part of this whole situation. Sometimes they act like the kids must  <br/>
be happy to have an excuse to miss school and other times they act  <br/>
like it was be really awful to have to miss.  Roxana has musical  <br/>
theater and dance classes and Rosie had karate and a guitar class -  <br/>
we got them there. Roya is a full-time college student - she missed  <br/>
her Monday morning class, but hasn&#39;t had to miss classes or work,  <br/>
since.  Cyrus has had to take quite a bit of time off work this week  <br/>
- but won&#39;t have to miss much more, since I&#39;m around to handle stuff.<br/>
<br/>
3. EVERY single thing will be taken out of our house, inventoried,  <br/>
packed, taken to a cleaning facility, wiped off, put into an ozone  <br/>
chamber, repacked, stored until we&#39;re back into our house, then  <br/>
returned and unpacked. We will have a list of every single movable  <br/>
item in our house. That&#39;s kind of fun and we&#39;re thinking we&#39;ll keep  <br/>
the list going after we move back in - so we&#39;ll know where everything  <br/>
is!<br/>
<br/>
4. Each kid is &quot;remodeling&quot; their own room - new paint, new carpet,  <br/>
new curtains, some new furniture - and we&#39;re going to take advantage  <br/>
of being out of our house to do additional remodeling, too. So we&#39;ve  <br/>
already had some good discussions about color schemes and the  <br/>
ambience they want to create in their own rooms and how we want the  <br/>
common areas - living room, dining room, hallways, entryway, kitchen,  <br/>
and bathrooms - to feel, what our constraints are, how different  <br/>
options would fit with our chosen lifestyle, etc. Very cool - really  <br/>
&quot;educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there is more - but I just thought I&#39;d post a little about  <br/>
what our unschooling life is currently like. I won&#39;t be around much -  <br/>
we&#39;re sharing a computer AND I pretty much have a new full-time job  <br/>
of supervising what&#39;s going on at my house while, at the same time,  <br/>
figuring out all the things you have to figure out when you remodel -  <br/>
buying new appliances, choosing flooring, picking out paint, and so  <br/>
on. We don&#39;t really know, yet, how long we&#39;ll be out of our house,  <br/>
but we&#39;re guessing it&#39;ll be three months or so.<br/>
<br/>
Life goes on and it is good!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225600017">What an experience (ongoing &lt;g&gt;) Pam!  Thanks for letting us know how things<br/>
are going - I&#39;ve been thinking of you since Sandra let us know what<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just love hearing how you all are approaching this.  For so many people, a<br/>
garage fire and the aftermath would send them into a tailspin.  You&#39;ve found<br/>
learning, closeness, fun and new things to look forward to.  That&#39;s so cool.<br/>

  Hi --<br/>
<br/>
Well - I&#39;ve been missing for a week, tomorrow. We had a fire in our  <br/>
garage (started in the dryer motor). The garage is attached to the  <br/>
house - we smelled smoke, opened the garage door (a big heavy metal- <br/>
backed fire door) and the garage was filled with flames, floor to  <br/>
rafters. My husband BRILLIANTLY slammed the door shut and yelled,  <br/>
&quot;Everybody get out NOW!&quot; He grabbed the phone and threw it to me and  <br/>
I dialed 911. Roya grabbed the dog and shoved her out the front door  <br/>
and then she grabbed the brand-new little baby hamster that I got for  <br/>
my birthday. We all stood on the front sidewalk, watching the smoke  <br/>
pouring from the entire house and flames above the garage. I thought  <br/>
the house was lost, but the fire department put it out pretty  <br/>
quickly. Only the garage really burned - but the rest of the house  <br/>
filled with smoke.<br/>
<br/>
So - here is what my kids are getting to experience:<br/>
<br/>
1. VERY close quarters. We&#39;ve been in a hotel for a week - five of  <br/>
us, a large dog, a tiny hamster, plus a couple of friends who have  <br/>
spent a lot of time here. Good thing we LIKE each other. Good thing  <br/>
all those things &quot;they say&quot; about teenagers are not true - they&#39;re  <br/>
not totally self-centered, they don&#39;t have &quot;attitude problems,&quot; they  <br/>
care about each other and about their parents and they are doing what  <br/>
they can to make this difficult time, not just bearable, but actually  <br/>
something of an adventure. Not one of them has complained at all.  <br/>
Most of their belongings are not going to be returned for 3 to 9  <br/>
months - they&#39;re just glad we&#39;re all together. They are &quot;rising to  <br/>
the occasion&quot; with flying colors! Far from us being at each other&#39;s  <br/>
throats, like people seem to expect, it has brought us closer to each  <br/>
other - reminded us to appreciate each other.<br/>
<br/>
2. A LOT of people have asked the kids if they &quot;had to miss any  <br/>
school.&quot; They act like THAT would be either the best or the worst  <br/>
part of this whole situation. Sometimes they act like the kids must  <br/>
be happy to have an excuse to miss school and other times they act  <br/>
like it was be really awful to have to miss.  Roxana has musical  <br/>
theater and dance classes and Rosie had karate and a guitar class -  <br/>
we got them there. Roya is a full-time college student - she missed  <br/>
her Monday morning class, but hasn&#39;t had to miss classes or work,  <br/>
since.  Cyrus has had to take quite a bit of time off work this week  <br/>
- but won&#39;t have to miss much more, since I&#39;m around to handle stuff.<br/>
<br/>
3. EVERY single thing will be taken out of our house, inventoried,  <br/>
packed, taken to a cleaning facility, wiped off, put into an ozone  <br/>
chamber, repacked, stored until we&#39;re back into our house, then  <br/>
returned and unpacked. We will have a list of every single movable  <br/>
item in our house. That&#39;s kind of fun and we&#39;re thinking we&#39;ll keep  <br/>
the list going after we move back in - so we&#39;ll know where everything  <br/>
is!<br/>
<br/>
4. Each kid is &quot;remodeling&quot; their own room - new paint, new carpet,  <br/>
new curtains, some new furniture - and we&#39;re going to take advantage  <br/>
of being out of our house to do additional remodeling, too. So we&#39;ve  <br/>
already had some good discussions about color schemes and the  <br/>
ambience they want to create in their own rooms and how we want the  <br/>
common areas - living room, dining room, hallways, entryway, kitchen,  <br/>
and bathrooms - to feel, what our constraints are, how different  <br/>
options would fit with our chosen lifestyle, etc. Very cool - really  <br/>
&quot;educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there is more - but I just thought I&#39;d post a little about  <br/>
what our unschooling life is currently like. I won&#39;t be around much -  <br/>
we&#39;re sharing a computer AND I pretty much have a new full-time job  <br/>
of supervising what&#39;s going on at my house while, at the same time,  <br/>
figuring out all the things you have to figure out when you remodel -  <br/>
buying new appliances, choosing flooring, picking out paint, and so  <br/>
on. We don&#39;t really know, yet, how long we&#39;ll be out of our house,  <br/>
but we&#39;re guessing it&#39;ll be three months or so.<br/>
<br/>
Life goes on and it is good!<br/>
