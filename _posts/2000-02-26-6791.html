<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430024771">A friend of my eldest (Katie the one in Highschool)  sent this to me<br/>
yesterday.<br/>
She such a sweet kid and so philsophical. Shares some classes with<br/>
Katie. She is a wonderful friend to my daughter.<br/>
Not all Highschool kids have their heads in the clouds,<br/>
so I pass it on to you all.....<br/>

To realize the value of one year:<br/>
Ask a student who has failed a final exam.<br/>
<br/>
To realize the value of one month:<br/>
Ask a mother who has given birth to a premature baby.<br/>
<br/>
To realize the value of one week:<br/>
Ask an editor of a weekly newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
To realize the value of one hour:<br/>
Ask the lovers who are waiting to meet.<br/>
<br/>
To realize the value of one minute:<br/>
Ask a person who has missed the train, bus or plane.<br/>
<br/>
To realize the value of one second:<br/>
Ask a person who has survived an accident.<br/>
To realize the value of one millisecond:<br/>

<br/>
Time waits for no one.<br/>
Treasure every moment you have.<br/>
You will treasure it even more when you can share it with someone<br/>
special.<br/>
