You know, it always seems strange to me that people who want to live their lives in a way counter to culture in some aspects and be left alone to do it (Unschoolers) can also be so upset by anyone else wanting the same freedoms.  We may not agree with other people&#39;s choices, but they ARE other people&#39;s choices, and would we rather they not be able to choose?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Hello Tracy;<br/>
  Thank you for the information, and you are right, alot of people, <br/>
me included, will not be comfortable using Yahoo for our web sites or <br/>
businesses.<br/>
  There are many that will defend this as a freedom of speech issue, <br/>
or that is it is everyone&#39;s right to do whatever they want, including <br/>
spread porn. They could be right...but, we also have the right not to <br/>
support businesses that make their money this way. I for one, would <br/>
have been happy to pay a small fee to use yahoo groups. If this is <br/>
just a way for Yahoo to make money, maybe they should have thought to <br/>
ask....<br/>
    Regards to all,<br/>

I was passing the info on in the spirit of believing <br/>
that some would like to know about this.  This is also <br/>
about people being able to choose, in this case to <br/>
choose whether they want their email list to be <br/>
associated with a company supplying a controversial <br/>
product.  As it turns out, they&#39;ve decided to stop <br/>
altogether.  <br/>
