<div id="ygrps-yiv-697161727">Hi all~  I would like to know how much you do share with your children?!  As<br/>
Joanne mentioned, she did not really &quot;announce&quot; to her kids that she was<br/>
moving more into unschooling and that her kids were upset by this.  However<br/>
after she explained some to them they were happier.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I would like to know how you impress upon your children that they are<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; even if they don&#39;t do society&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; things.  I have never<br/>
cared what society thought of me but I have an 11 year old daughter who<br/>
wants to always &quot;fit in&quot;.  I am worried about how much trouble this will<br/>
cause her as she gets older.  I want her to be confident in herself the way<br/>
she is--I think she is just great!  Part of her lack of self-esteem comes<br/>
from her 4 years in the school system (pre-school through 2nd grade). She<br/>
had a strict 2nd grade teacher that was red pen happy! Everything that child<br/>
ever wrote or did had some red mark on it--no matter how small the error.<br/>
Thanks for your comments~<br/>

&gt; My kids have some of this--not so much about school but about other,<br/>
&gt; school-at-home homeschoolers.  Most of their friends &quot;do school&quot; and<br/>
&gt; my kids sometimes feel impressed by the official look of<br/>
&gt; their &quot;school-rooms&quot;, schedules, time-lines etc.  Through reading<br/>
&gt; this list, I just gradually stopped doing any structured schoolwork<br/>
&gt; with them, and while they are happy to be spending their days free of<br/>
&gt; that, they sometimes feel they&#39;re not measuring up.  They don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; the external rewards that school-kids, or school at home kids might<br/>
&gt; get--grades, gold stars, completed workbooks etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It just occurred to me recently, that while I understood what we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; doing, they really didn&#39;t...they thought we were just slacking off,<br/>
&gt; drifting about...and we were always VERY relaxed homeschoolers to<br/>
&gt; begin with.  At any rate, I&#39;ve started sharing with them more about<br/>
&gt; WHY we&#39;ve changed, what I don&#39;t like about the way schools work etc,<br/>
&gt; and it seems to give them a sense of understanding...<br/>
&gt; &quot;Ahhh...there&#39;s a plan!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My older dtr said the other day about a rather controlling fellow HS<br/>
&gt; mom--&quot;She treats her dtr like she&#39;s a rat in a cage, giving her<br/>
&gt; rewards for good behavior.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just talking this out helps them see that we have CHOSEN this<br/>
&gt; lifestyle.  It helps them when they start comparing themselves to<br/>
&gt; their peers.  I&#39;m hoping that unschooling will help my kids not care<br/>
&gt; so much about &quot;being normal&quot;--what freedom THAT would be!<br/>

it and who doesn&#39;t.<br/>
With school, though, it&#39;s a much bigger thing- it&#39;s what our entire <br/>
community does.  When they&#39;re with friends they feel out of the <br/>
loop.  Not because the friends are &quot;cliquey&quot; or mean about it... <br/>
they&#39;re not.  It&#39;s more because there&#39;s this whole culture, complete <br/>
with language, customs, good parts, bad parts, and references that <br/>
they are not privy to.  Latley I&#39;ve noticed that they&#39;ve been asking <br/>
their friends *lots* of questions about school.  Sometimes I think <br/>
it would be easier if they had experienced a little bit of it and <br/>
then unschooled later, as then it wouldn&#39;t be this big mysterious <br/>

school.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We did a camping trip over the last two days and my son and one of his<br/>
friends were reading through several Sailor Moon comic books. They had tons<br/>
of questions for me about the stuff in there, which is very schoolish: &quot;Why<br/>
is one person considered a &quot;brain&quot;? Did you get A&#39;s when you were in school?<br/>
Why do they have to take those tests? Why can&#39;t they leave the school area?<br/>
etc. The other kid&#39;s mom and I were talking about what, specifically, draws<br/>
these two boys to pour over Sailor Moon, and one of the big reasons is that<br/>
I think it is answering some need to see what goes on with schooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
But, I *don&#39;t* think it would ever be easier if my kids had experienced<br/>
school. I think it would&#39;ve broken some parts of them, even in small ways,<br/>
that would be very difficult to fix. I&#39;ll take the curiousity about school<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to have a button when I was in high school that said &quot;Why be normal?&quot;<br/>
and I guess that&#39;s more or less my attitude. I talk to my kids a lot about<br/>
why we&#39;re unschooling. They know that when we&#39;re at the beach with our<br/>
friends on the only beautiful 70 degree day in weeks (yesterday) that other<br/>
kids are buckling down to a spelling test and looking out the window. The<br/>
kids know that I don&#39;t personally value the things that school<br/>
teaches--conformity, capitulation, subjugation of individuality.<br/>
<br/>
I also think having a strong group of homeschooling friends helps immensely.<br/>
The kids in our group all follow their own drummers, and there doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to be any need to conform to a &quot;norm&quot;.<br/>

she never had been exposed to school. The exposure is worse than the <br/>
mystery that I expect from my 4yo that I hope never wants to go to <br/>
school. So much damage to undo. So much guilt for not knowing any <br/>
better that to do what I was supposed to do. I *wish* my oldest <br/>
daughter never went to school and only wondered what it is all about. <br/>

<br/>
It seems it would cause her more trouble in school than out, because others <br/>
would tell her exactly what she needed to do to fit in.<br/>
<br/>
With Holly, I see her being more and more discriminating about whose opinion <br/>
she cares about as she gets older.  Friends she thought were pretty cool when <br/>
they were younger aren&#39;t growing as smoothly as she expected in some ways.  <br/>
Either school caused them to just become more mainstream and so now they <br/>
question Holly&#39;s fashion or hobby or entertainment choices as being not the <br/>
current fashion (which doesn&#39;t impress her) or they seemed on a trajectory to <br/>
be doing really cool things now with collections or knowledge or hobbies and <br/>
they just dropped those things (for not being cool).   Holly sees those <br/>
changes and asks &quot;Why don&#39;t you do art anymore?&quot; or &quot;Why did you quit <br/>
braiding your hair?&quot; (or whatever) and finds the answers rarely thoughtful.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;s starting to see &quot;normal&quot; as being a sham, a way to try to keep <br/>
people from really thinking or sparkling.  She&#39;s glad to be on the free side <br/>
of that line where she really can do things because she, her individual self, <br/>
wants to, not because her classmates tell her she can or can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids who go to school still maintain their sense of self, and they <br/>
sparkle.<br/>
Some kids who are homeschooled aren&#39;t as sparkly as others.<br/>
<br/>
But the chances of ten other girls coming to her daily and asking her to <br/>
explain WHY she cut her hair the way she did, and WHY she&#39;s wearing what <br/>
she&#39;s wearing and WHY she&#39;s reading what she&#39;s reading are just zero with <br/>
homeschooling, and would be guaranteed if she were in school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, I would like to know how you impress upon your children that they are<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; even if they don&#39;t do society&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; things. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Mathematically speaking, I wouldn&#39;t use &quot;normal&quot; to mean special or different <br/>
or unique or privileged.  She IS all those things, and  probably is NOT <br/>
&quot;normal.&quot;  Maybe tell her that if the kids at school had a choice they would <br/>
rather be home, but poor things don&#39;t have a choice and that is normal.<br/>

I agree.  Holly has visited schools, here and in England, with her friend <br/>
Jasmine.  Maybe you can get an all-day visitation?  Some schools will allow <br/>
it.  Some won&#39;t.  Maybe if you tell them your child&#39;s thinking of attending <br/>
they&#39;ll see dollar signs and say &quot;Come on down!&quot;  (Though &quot;just&quot; a visit <br/>
would involve less wooing and preening than if the teacher saw the kid as a <br/>
potential future number, probably.)<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s never been in a school except went to see plays twice.  So straight <br/>
into the detached theatre building and back out.    <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s reading a book based on school.  I bought Stargirl (after many <br/>
recommendations from unschoolers) and am a third of the way through.  I <br/>
thought Holly might like to read it next, but she&#39;s reading &quot;Are you There, <br/>
God? It&#39;s Me, Margaret&quot; and keeps commenting how school-focussed it is.  <br/>
Stargirl is too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe reading books like those would satisfy a little of their urge to know <br/>
more about school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000195552">Hi Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
My daughter will be 11 in July and she too went to school through the <br/>
second grade.  Most of her friends are still from school.  She is a very <br/>
social person.  That was the main reason why I put her in a preschool at <br/>
the age of 3!  Other kids to play with!  It&#39;s been a real struggle.  I have <br/>
noticed that there are a combination of factors involved with her <br/>
unhappiness and wanting to return to school or at least wanting to be more <br/>
like her friends.  Depending on how isolated she felt (how successful she <br/>
was in getting someone to play with her), how active her current interests, <br/>
the weather (we live in the Seattle area),  future plans for out-of-state <br/>
field trips, and her medications (she has a mood disorder), all these would <br/>
have an effect on how much she would dwell on wishing she could be like the <br/>
&quot;other girls,&quot; or conversely that there was no such thing as public school!<br/>
<br/>
We have been deschooling now for almost 3 years, and it is only now that I <br/>
feel I can start to see some real positive changes in her.  She has begun <br/>
to express interest in wanting to learn new things and is taking the <br/>
initiative.  The more successful she is at this, the less she compares <br/>
herself to her friends.  She is very aware, however, of my opinion of the <br/>
school system and of the things she couldn&#39;t do if she were in it.  No <br/>
field trips, no sleeping in or staying up late, spelling tests, and doing <br/>
math, all the things she hates, still!  She also hears from her friends the <br/>
complaints about the homework, and not being able to play and sees her <br/>
brother&#39;s friends (age 14) being expelled and failing for really silly <br/>
reasons.  She is aware on a pretty regular basis of the failings of the <br/>
school system.  The positives of homeschooling, of unschooling, are also <br/>
usually gifted to her on a daily basis in some way.  I think this also <br/>
helps her confidence and self esteem in realizing that she has the better <br/>
if not more &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; choice.<br/>
<br/>
Despite all this, when she gets together with a large group of schooled <br/>
friends like at Girl Scouts where she is the only homeschooled girl, she <br/>
feels very uncomfortable.  She says that she feels like they &quot;know <br/>
more.&quot;  I suspect it is because all the girls, being the same grade, are on <br/>
the same page and just can say the same things.  She feels left out and <br/>
different, which is the kiss of death in a group without any other <br/>
support.  One other homeschooler would help, I&#39;m sure. It&#39;s not done <br/>
intentionally, I don&#39;t think, for I know the leader well.  It&#39;s a <br/>
self-esteem thing, which she is only now beginning to form after all these <br/>
years.  She does have a few close friends in the group, but they don&#39;t <br/>
realize how she feels about this aspect and so don&#39;t know how to support <br/>
her.  They&#39;re all only 10 after all!  But knowing this helps me understand <br/>
why she wants to go independent next year.  We&#39;ll see what we do.  But <br/>
we&#39;ll talk about it and why she feels uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Being like the rest of her friends is a big deal at this age.  Fortunately, <br/>
because she is at home, that impulse is considerably diluted and presents <br/>
itself in the type of toys that she may be interested in (Brats or <br/>
Build-A-Bears), rather than clothes, or language, or boys!  So I recognize <br/>
the impulse and am grateful for the lack of severity in the reality of it <br/>
and go with the flow.  The same with the statements of &quot;wishing I could be <br/>
like so and so,&quot; or any other such thing.  I usually take that to mean <br/>
something didn&#39;t go well today and she is unhappy with something, rather <br/>
than a real wish to change, and I go investigate.  Re your question about <br/>
fitting in...I think that the more confident you are about yourself and <br/>
your abilities, the less you will care about &quot;fitting in.&quot;  Right now <br/>
though, it&#39;s a big deal.  An age phase for many.<br/>
<br/>
I try to talk to my kids about the whole unschooling process.  Given the <br/>
problems that we had in public school, the process had to become a family <br/>
one.  It&#39;s necessary for us that it be a cooperative effort, especially <br/>
with a bipolar teen!  So, interesting articles on the public school system <br/>
or colleges that I think my 14 yr old should hear are spoken about, and <br/>
emails from this list are shared.  Maybe I talk too much (who knows how <br/>
much they really choose to &quot;hear&quot; anyway!), but I figure they should have <br/>
an idea of where I&#39;m going and what I&#39;m trying to do.  By now they know <br/>
that I&#39;m not perfect (boy do they!), and if they have something to say they <br/>
can...all part of the process, I figure.  Talk to your daughter, get her <br/>
opinions, her complaints, her thoughts on solutions, etc.  Make her part of <br/>
the process and you will both be happier in the long run.  You are not the <br/>
&quot;teacher&quot;!! so stop trying to come up with all the answers or the lesson <br/>
plan!!   That&#39;s the SECRET!  There &#39;ain&#39;t&#39; one!  LOL<br/>

&gt;moving more into unschooling and that her kids were upset by this.  However<br/>
&gt;after she explained some to them they were happier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I would like to know how you impress upon your children that they are<br/>
&gt;&quot;normal&quot; even if they don&#39;t do society&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; things.  I have never<br/>
&gt;cared what society thought of me but I have an 11 year old daughter who<br/>
&gt;wants to always &quot;fit in&quot;.  I am worried about how much trouble this will<br/>
&gt;cause her as she gets older.  I want her to be confident in herself the way<br/>
&gt;she is--I think she is just great!  Part of her lack of self-esteem comes<br/>
&gt;from her 4 years in the school system (pre-school through 2nd grade). She<br/>
&gt;had a strict 2nd grade teacher that was red pen happy! Everything that child<br/>
&gt;ever wrote or did had some red mark on it--no matter how small the error.<br/>
&gt;Thanks for your comments~<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; moment when my oldest was about to fall asleep he had an<br/>
&gt; &gt; interesting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing to say out of the blue. Something like &quot;sometimes I wish you<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; even knew about homeschooling, and then I&#39;d be normal.&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My kids have some of this--not so much about school but about other,<br/>
&gt; &gt; school-at-home homeschoolers.  Most of their friends &quot;do school&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; my kids sometimes feel impressed by the official look of<br/>
&gt; &gt; their &quot;school-rooms&quot;, schedules, time-lines etc.  Through reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; this list, I just gradually stopped doing any structured schoolwork<br/>
&gt; &gt; with them, and while they are happy to be spending their days free of<br/>
&gt; &gt; that, they sometimes feel they&#39;re not measuring up.  They don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; &gt; the external rewards that school-kids, or school at home kids might<br/>
&gt; &gt; get--grades, gold stars, completed workbooks etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It just occurred to me recently, that while I understood what we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing, they really didn&#39;t...they thought we were just slacking off,<br/>
&gt; &gt; drifting about...and we were always VERY relaxed homeschoolers to<br/>
&gt; &gt; begin with.  At any rate, I&#39;ve started sharing with them more about<br/>
&gt; &gt; WHY we&#39;ve changed, what I don&#39;t like about the way schools work etc,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and it seems to give them a sense of understanding...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Ahhh...there&#39;s a plan!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My older dtr said the other day about a rather controlling fellow HS<br/>
&gt; &gt; mom--&quot;She treats her dtr like she&#39;s a rat in a cage, giving her<br/>
&gt; &gt; rewards for good behavior.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just talking this out helps them see that we have CHOSEN this<br/>
&gt; &gt; lifestyle.  It helps them when they start comparing themselves to<br/>
&gt; &gt; their peers.  I&#39;m hoping that unschooling will help my kids not care<br/>
&gt; &gt; so much about &quot;being normal&quot;--what freedom THAT would be!<br/>

Another, if you can find it (I bought it on Ebay used) is &quot;Into the West&quot; <br/>
with Ellen Barkin and Gabriel Byrne...story about 2 gypsy boys and their <br/>
father who find a horse but the father gives up the &quot;gypsy life&quot; and they <br/>
move to Irish Welfare type housing.  Authorities are always coming around <br/>
threatening to take the kids away for not going to school...don&#39;t want to <br/>
give the whole movie away.  It&#39;s probably more of a &quot;traditional ethnic <br/>
lifestyle vs. cog in the machine&quot; movie than a &quot;school vs. no school&quot; movie, <br/>
but very cool nonetheless.  Sort of the same with &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish.&quot; <br/>
 (can you tell I love Irish movies?)<br/>

enjoyed it more.  It was after we moved out in the boonies here in WV and our <br/>
homeschool group was almost non-existant that they really wanted to go to <br/>
school.  4H, Irish Dance/Scottish Dance, things like that have helped some.  <br/>
But we have no immediate neighbors (a few 1/4 mile up the road) and only one <br/>
has a kid in the 3rd grade, too young for my first wave of children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743676859">An update for anyone who&#39;s interested... there have been two <br/>
interesting conversations around here the last couple of days.<br/>
A 14yo boy from around the corner who comes over to skateboard after <br/>
school was sitting at our table chatting.  He mentioned how lucky my <br/>
kids are that they have so much free time to &quot;do what they want,&quot; <br/>
and my oldest asked him if he would homeschool if he was allowed to.<br/>
He thought about it and then replied that it was hard to say, <br/>
because while he hates a lot of things about school (grades, <br/>
homework, boring classes) he&#39;d really miss his friends.  He *likes* <br/>
going to school to see his friends.  I felt uncomfortable because <br/>
this is exactly the reason my kids sometimes think they&#39;d like <br/>
school, so I piped up &quot;yes, but don&#39;t you get in trouble for <br/>
socializing in school?  Are you even allowed to talk to your <br/>
friends?&quot; and he surprised me by saying that yes, they do socialize <br/>
plenty throughout the day.  I could practically hear my kids making <br/>
a mental check in their pros of school column.<br/>
<br/>
Second conversation... my friend has a 12 year old daughter who goes <br/>
to school, and this week they went out to dinner together (she and <br/>
her daughter).  When they walked into the restaurant my friend had <br/>
her arm around her daughter.  Turns out there were a bunch of girls <br/>
from her class eating there (some school club dinner or other) who <br/>
witnessed the arms around each other thing, and this girl was so <br/>
mortified that she didn&#39;t eat her dinner and went home and locked <br/>
herself in her bedroom and cried.  All because her classmates saw <br/>
her and her mother with their arms around each other!  That kind of <br/>
peer influence and fear of criticism over such silly things just <br/>
horrifies me.<br/>
