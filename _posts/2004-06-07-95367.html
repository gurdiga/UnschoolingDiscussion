<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233381919">&quot;I like to imagine Sandra or Ren or Kelly or Pam, or some of the other people<br/>
I met at the conference last year - not only as a witness which really<br/>
helps, but also thinking &quot;what might they do/say at his moment?&quot; -&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Aw...that&#39;s SO sweet!<br/>
And all this time, I&#39;ve been thinking, &quot;I hope I can evolve into the kind of parents that Robyn/Kelly/Pam/Joyce/Anne/Sandra/Marji etc... are. You guys are on my altar, believe me.<br/>

Oh, and Rue...gentle, sweet Rue. :)<br/>
Deb I just imagine, since I haven&#39;t actually met her in real life.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s an altar of worship, not sacrifice. Truly.<br/>

You&#39;ll meet me in Peabody in August.  And then your skin will blister and<br/>
your nails will fall out and you&#39;ll spend the rest of your life trying to<br/>
forget.  <br/>
<br/>
cackle, cackle, cackle....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - I guess we&#39;re all inspiring each other. I picture Ren - she&#39;s SO <br/>
lovely and colorful and graceful and happy - and I want to BE her!! <br/>
Then I picture Kelly - smart and honest and speaking so clearly, right <br/>
from the heart all the time - and I want to be HER!!  And same for the <br/>
others Ren listed - plus add Rue and Karen and Kathryn and others I&#39;m <br/>
not thinking of right now - I have a bunch of people I met at the Live <br/>
and Learn conference all in full living color with surround sound in my <br/>
head and I use you all as my inspiration on a regular basis!!!<br/>
