&lt;&lt; I&#39;m in a really weird mood tonight. Anyone know where to find a Monty<br/>
Pythin wristwatch? It would truly be the ideal 17th birthday gift for a<br/>
friend of ours, but I&#39;ve googled and ebayed with no luck.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Take a Monty Python piece of art and a watch to a watchshop and get them to <br/>
switch out or cover over the face maybe?<br/>
<br/>
I found lots of sites with google using  <br/>
<br/>
watch face custom art<br/>
<br/>
and didn&#39;t read it all, but some look possible!<br/>
