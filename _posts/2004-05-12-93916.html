You know, a mom&#39;s helper might work perfectly. Could you pay a homeschooled teen to come and help on certain days? She/he could take him to the park, or do fun walks, crafts, food etc... that he enjoys. I bet a helper that is at your home would cost a LOT less than the other options you&#39;re pondering. My other thought was to hire an Aupair, they&#39;re like a foreign nanny. I believe you can hire one part time. It would be cheaper than a Waldorf school, he&#39;d be learning a bit about another country just by being with the person, and get lots of one on one attention!<br/>
A neighbor of mine had an Aupair from England...what a great accent.:) <br/>
If you could find a homeschooled teen, or a young college student, that might possibly be your best bet.<br/>

We had two au pairs. One from Germany, and one from Denmark. They are NOT <br/>
part-time. They are considered part of the family and live in your home for one <br/>
year.  Cameron basically had two moms. Fourteen years ago they cost $3,000 down <br/>
(includes round trip plane fare, insurance, orientation, and a local support <br/>
group) plus $100/week plus room and board.<br/>

run interference for me, especially between the two kids.  <br/>

Yes, this works to a certain extent.  I have a great picture of him from<br/>
last summer down at the job site, totally naked, filling a trench with<br/>
shovels full of dirt.  And he can help us plaster, etc.  The problem<br/>

he lays down with Scotty at bedtime and falls asleep with him.  <br/>

Thank you both for your advice!  I&#39;ll probably look into hiring a<br/>

Here&#39;s what I am afraid of with the preschool idea.  I actually have no<br/>
problem with preschool if it is all free play.  What I&#39;m worried about<br/>
is that Scotty will love it so much (all the toys, art supplies,<br/>
playground equipment) that when he gets too old for it he will still<br/>
want to go to &quot;school&quot; like all his friends (and all of their parents<br/>
are calling preschool &quot;school&quot;, I guess to get them used to the idea),<br/>
even though kindergarten is much more structured.  Is this silly?  Am I<br/>
wrong to limit his choices this way?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I had a pregnant teenage girl come and take care of and play with my <br/>
little ones for about 6 months, almost every morning, while I was <br/>
working from home. She needed a temporary job and I liked her (knew her <br/>

I&#39;m so glad to hear everybody&#39;s suggestions about getting a mother&#39;s<br/>
helper.  I guess I was thinking that if I am going to keep the kids home<br/>
then I&#39;m responsible for all of their care myself.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Holly was born, a neighborhood 12 year old nearly begged to help me with <br/>
the baby.  I let her hold Holly all she wanted, and I paid her $2 an hour to <br/>
hang out at my house, play with the boys, change their video tapes, help them <br/>
with scotch tape and getting juice and... you know, the easy stuff but things <br/>
you can&#39;t do so easily with a baby in your arms.<br/>
<br/>
That was a very good deal.  I think I paid her $3 an hour if I was leaving, <br/>
and she took the boys to her house, and when she got older I paid her $4 and $5 <br/>
an hour, but she was homeschooled (good) and this&#39;n&#39;that happened (not so <br/>
good) and when she was 15 she moved away.   But it was wonderful while it lasted.<br/>

people with small children say this a lot.  I see people with small<br/>
children, who are very loving, gentle parents be unable to talk for 2<br/>
minutes about an issue that needs to be talked about because their children<br/>
refuse to give them that space.<br/>

I have several small children.  I know how they have difficulty waiting for<br/>
even 5 seconds to tell you things...but I also know that sometimes adults<br/>
must talk together about things.<br/>

talk about the logistics of things.  Other times, I tell the kids that Dad<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-287898960">I have heard this often too. <br/>
I have three children, 11, 9 and 8.  They are close in age, so when they were young, they always needed alot of us!<br/>
One of the great advantages to being home together all the time, is that we learn how to live with one another.<br/>
I&#39;ve always explained to my kids that there are times when Daddy and I need to talk.  They can be nearby doing whatever they want quietly, or even on our laps, but it is important that Daddy and I have these times.  <br/>
We have discussed how important it is for marriage and ultimately our family for Dad and I to have these times together.<br/>
Now that they are older, they are welcome to join sometimes, and other times they are fine with letting us have these times.<br/>
This has always worked for us.  <br/>
I think explaining the reason and that it is important to all of us, helped them understand.  <br/>
Then, we are always sure that they have the same courtesy.<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt;It is hard to find an old-fashioned preschool that isn&#39;t really a<br/>
&gt;daycare situation, but if you can and if he LIKES it, I see no huge<br/>
&gt;problem with a couple of hours a few times a week of that. Again, if it<br/>
&gt;is a gentle nice place, not a place that teaches early academics, etc.<br/>
&gt;Hard to find, these days. Maybe a parent co-op would work.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s what I am afraid of with the preschool idea.  I actually have no<br/>
&gt;problem with preschool if it is all free play.  What I&#39;m worried about<br/>
&gt;is that Scotty will love it so much (all the toys, art supplies,<br/>
&gt;playground equipment) that when he gets too old for it he will still<br/>
&gt;want to go to &quot;school&quot; like all his friends (and all of their parents<br/>
&gt;are calling preschool &quot;school&quot;, I guess to get them used to the idea),<br/>
&gt;even though kindergarten is much more structured.  Is this silly?  Am I<br/>
&gt;wrong to limit his choices this way?<br/>

<br/>
I did this with my son (my oldest child), who is now 9. My decision <br/>
to homeschool came more than a decade before he was born, so I was <br/>
looking for a non-academic &quot;pre-school. &quot; I found one, called <br/>
appropriately enough the Playschool Cooperative. I wanted to do it <br/>
because every blessed child in our neighborhood at the time was <br/>
either in school or daycare and I didn&#39;t know any other preschool age <br/>
homeschoolers (I know better now LOL)<br/>
<br/>
The year after that, we moved to a house just down the street from a <br/>
school and we did have the problem of Peregrine wanting to go to <br/>
school from time to time. It turned out that his perception of school <br/>
was based on his playschool experience, combined with seeing the kids <br/>
on the playground at recess, lunch and gym. It looked like fun. All <br/>
it took was to talk to him about the general day at school. I wasn&#39;t <br/>
anti-school, but I did point out that those times he saw the kids on <br/>
the playground were the only times they got to go out during the day. <br/>
I also reminded him that his friends who went to the school could <br/>
rarely play in the afternoon because they always had homework to do.<br/>
<br/>
We did go play on the school playground a few times after school, but <br/>
the parks have better playgrounds, so that wore out fast.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I&#39;m glad I did it, though with my second, I got much the <br/>
same thing by doing activities with two homeschool groups that met <br/>
regularly. She missed having a big rice table and lots of big riding <br/>
toys, but she seems to have held up fine. :) If I had a third on the <br/>
way, I&#39;d go with option 2 again unless I couldn&#39;t find like minded <br/>
homeschoolers in my area.<br/>

bottle of wine while we soak and talk about everything.<br/>
Candles aglow, warm water, hushed voices (because my daughter is sleeping in<br/>

is the uninterrupted (usually) conversation.<br/>

This sounds really great.  If only my DH could stay awake late enough for<br/>
the kids to fall asleep first.....<br/>

Thanks Karen!  I guess I should give him some credit.  If I explained to<br/>
him what real school was like he would probably be fine with not going.<br/>
After all, I&#39;m going to have to do that anyway when all of his friends<br/>
are in school.<br/>

I think that&#39;s going to be the key for us.  I&#39;m going to turn up the<br/>
effort in my search for unschoolers around here, and of course I&#39;m lucky<br/>
enough to be in the same city as our own Sandra, so I know they are out<br/>
there :-)<br/>

Has anyone heard of Marazon? It&#39;s what a local pre-school is based on <br/>
and they talk a lot about being &#39;child-centered&#39; but I don&#39;t know if <br/>
they really mean it! <br/>
