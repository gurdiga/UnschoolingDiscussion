<div id="ygrps-yiv-139036237">Hi, guys,<br/>
<br/>
I need a support group today and you all are going to have to be it for me!<br/>
My six year old son read Charlotte&#39;s Web, loved the book, hated the part<br/>
about killing animals for food, spent a couple days thinking and talking<br/>
about it, and decided he&#39;s never eating meat again.<br/>
<br/>
I took him seriously, and believe in his right to make decisions about his<br/>
life.  We discussed nutrition, protein, balanced diets, etc.  Our family has<br/>
never been heavy meat eaters, so it&#39;s not a huge transition, although it<br/>
does require a bit more planning.  It&#39;s been about a month, and still going<br/>
strong.<br/>
<br/>
The problem?  The reactions from absolutely everybody.  The doctor tried to<br/>
tell him he MUST eat meat, until I cut him off (time for a new doctor.<br/>
gotta work on the army on that one.).  His friends don&#39;t care, but their<br/>
parents laugh at him, about him, treat it like it&#39;s a silly little phase or<br/>
something abhorant.  We had an family BBQ with army folks my dh works with,<br/>
and people acted like we&#39;re wrong for not just making him eat meat, and must<br/>
have no control as parents.  All this for taking a child seriously?!<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe I&#39;m doing the right thing here.  But my best friend just<br/>
told me how stupid I&#39;m being about this (by &quot;humoring him&quot;-- her words, not<br/>
mine), and I need some support.  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Ugh.  It&#39;s strange that they think what he eats is their business. <br/>
(Although I do understand hosts preparing meat sometimes feel awkward<br/>
about what to serve vegetarian guests.)<br/>
<br/>
You might bring tofu hot dogs and vegetables (like squash) to toss on<br/>
the grill to the next barbeque.  But I know that doesn&#39;t address the<br/>
hostile and unsolicited advice issue.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to express my sympathy.  I&#39;m not a vegetarian, but tried<br/>
it once for a few weeks.  Your son has a right to his own ethical<br/>
beliefs, and I&#39;m glad you are supporting him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682349251">i have a dear vegan friend who read dr. doliitle as a child and never ate <br/>
meat again. now her husband and 5yos are vegan too. have you guys read &quot;diet <br/>

yourself. makes you wonder about your friends i bet.maybe they think its a <br/>
phase from their own lack of discipline in sticking with things? you could <br/>
do an animal rights/vegan search.hang tough!and power to your compassionate <br/>

she was 8. She&#39;s nine now and eats chicken, but no red meat that I can<br/>
think of...<br/>
<br/>
I got a much better response from people in general(although Rain&#39;s *dad*<br/>
was the worst, he kept telling her she wouldn&#39;t be healthy). Perhaps<br/>
living in northern California made the difference... but if people gave<br/>
me a hard time about it, I would talk about how much I admired her choice<br/>
and her willpower, and how I was concerned about the lack of safeguards<br/>
in slaughterhouses (better now than then, but still scary) and the<br/>
possibilities of fecal contamination of meat... not to mention the extra<br/>
doses of antibiotics most meat cattle get because they spend their lives<br/>
in huge feedlots eating corn, which gives them bloody diarrhea because<br/>
their digestive systems were made for grass (although it fattens them up<br/>
a lot faster). <br/>
<br/>
I might alos talk about the health benefits of being veg, maybe pull up<br/>
some statistics from the web...<br/>
<br/>
And I personally would do this all with big, innocent eyes, as if I<br/>
couldn&#39;t understand why people would find it funny that my kid was making<br/>
a positive health choice...<br/>
<br/>
And I do eat meat, but I&#39;m more careful about it now, and I try to buy<br/>
meat only when I know where it came from...<br/>

<br/>
Yes. You will run into this over and over again for taking your child <br/>
seriously since our society treats children as lesser citizens.<br/>
Take heart. You aren&#39;t alone in your strangeness (isn&#39;t it sad that <br/>
we are the strange ones?)...<br/>
<br/>
Three of my four children were vegetarian en utero and up to about <br/>
age four or five. We eat mostly vegetarian and I see no ill effects <br/>
on any of them. They are healthy, thriving and well balanced <br/>
individuals that eat a variety of foods. <br/>
The three oldest ones (ages 5-12) occasionally eat fish or chicken. <br/>
Babsy boy is still nursing (18months) and I don&#39;t see any point in <br/>
introducing meat to him yet.<br/>
People can eat a HUGE variety of diets and thrive. You are a wise and <br/>
wonderful mother to respect your child&#39;s choice to choose his own <br/>
diet. I wouldn&#39;t make a big deal out of the fact that he is <br/>
vegetarian, not saying anything will get you out of having to defend <br/>
him/yourself when you don&#39;t feel like it.<br/>
Most people won&#39;t notice what he&#39;s is/isn&#39;t eating if you don&#39;t say <br/>
anything.<br/>
Many doctors aren&#39;t very well educated in nutrition, so I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
worry too much about what they think!!<br/>
Too many of them smoke and eat crappy for me to consider them worthy <br/>
of a nutrition opinion.<br/>
haha<br/>
Anyway, many, many children are vegetarian and perfectly healthy. <br/>
Most people fear what they don&#39;t understand. This being no exception.<br/>
Carry on!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754919361">Someone may have already responded to your post - I am a little behind in my reading :) <br/>
<br/>
I  would just ignore it. ( The other people&#39;s reactions) There&#39;s tons of people and children who don&#39;t eat meat and are perfectly healthy ( some even more so than us - Big Mack eaters :)  I didn&#39;t eat much meat as a child simply because I didn&#39;t like it. My mother used to force me. I hated that. I would chew it and go tot the bathroom and spit it out...etc. It wasn&#39;t until I was a teenager that she took me seriously because I was going to weight watchers to support a friend and figured I had learned enough about nutrition to get by. She would just supply those food that were protein rich - and meatless. I did eat chicken and fish and hamgburgers -  so I was by no means a vegetarian...<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a good thing when kids are sensative to these types of issues. I think it shows they are kind. I would tell those that you are proud of your son for making tough choices about issues at such a young age.  It&#39;s so much easier to just grab that hamburger...<br/>

<br/>
The one thing I want my kids to develop the most, is the ability to stand up<br/>
to what they believe, no matter what the &quot;masses&quot; might say.  My two boys,<br/>
ages 10 and 7, do not eat any meat and proudly call themselves vegetarians.<br/>
Any doctor telling you that your 6 year old has to eat meat should be<br/>
dismissed, protein yes, not meat. I am a vegetarian but never told my kids<br/>
that they had to be.  Their choice.  We don&#39;t get too many negative<br/>
comments, most people know the benefits, but occasionally  someone will say<br/>
something.  It blows my mind that I and my children would be criticized for<br/>
being compassionate!  Same with the homeschooling, natural medication, yada,<br/>
yada, yada, other people always think we are doing it wrong if it is not the<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; way or their way.  At least my children are standing up to<br/>
&quot;peer-pressure!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You are doing the right thing listening to your son and supporting him.<br/>
Isn&#39;t that the basis of unschooling anyway?  Good luck!<br/>

your son.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think your response, and his, needs to be something like asking people <br/>
where they did their research on vegetarianism because you&#39;d like to see <br/>
any studies that show the importance of his eating meat.  I suspect that <br/>
would shut most of them up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been a vegetarian for about 20 years and have raised my boys (9 & 11)<br/>
on a vegetarian diet. I&#39;ve gotten used to any negative stuff people say to<br/>
me about it. It really doesn&#39;t matter to me what they think because I know<br/>
the reasons why I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing and I can stand firm in my<br/>
decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s hard to stand out from the crowd and be different. I never<br/>
feel like I quite fit in with anyone&#39;s crowd. I&#39;m further different from<br/>
most because I also homeschool and even UNschool, do not vaccinate, had a<br/>
homebirth, and also try to practice natural medicine when at all possible.<br/>
In fact, I don&#39;t know anyone like me! I&#39;ve heard it all the most from my MIL<br/>
who probably doesn&#39;t understand why I must be SO different than most. LOL.<br/>
Being different is just a fact of life, for me.<br/>

with personal family matters. Well, I would just simply state your reasons<br/>
(and your son&#39;s reasons) for being vegetarian and leave it at that. Who<br/>
knows, you might might educate them a bit about it or give courage to some<br/>
others who&#39;ve wanted to try being veg but haven&#39;t  yet.<br/>
<br/>
I always bring veggie burgers or veggie hot dogs to any BBQ event. That way<br/>
my kids and I feel like at least we can share in the BBQ atmosphere and not<br/>
feel so left out. People could also see that your son is eating &quot;something&quot;<br/>

made me feel bad for &quot;humoring&quot; my son.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t sound like best friend behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with this and I commend your son for having the courage to be<br/>
different.<br/>

often when we are out because we know not to make a big deal about it. Most<br/>
people don&#39;t notice that we are vegetarian and my experience has been that<br/>
people who do find out try to be extra accomodating to helping us find<br/>
something to eat. We eat whatever there is available for us, and know that<br/>
when we get home in an hour or two - can eat whatever we like if we&#39;re still<br/>
hungry.<br/>

<br/>
What an opportunity you have to show your child how to maintain<br/>
integrity in the face of opposition, lack of understanding, conformity.<br/>
Good for you for taking his ideals and compassion and commitment<br/>
seriously (however long it lasts).<br/>
<br/>
My dad brought us up to value our stand in being different - quietly,<br/>
with dignity. Every year we had to face the friends, neighbors and<br/>
people we didn&#39;t even know at holiday times as I was brought up Jewish<br/>
in a Christian society. So no Christmas tree or Easter egg hunts. We did<br/>
have the perks of staying home from school on Jewish holidays, and the<br/>
broadening of our cultural horizons by knowing interesting people  and<br/>
our own holidays, and visiting Israel. This was not an individual<br/>
commitment at that time, so we had much more support, but your son will<br/>
grow in character from your respect for him and in facing others who are<br/>
ignorant of why he chose his path. <br/>
<br/>
You can keep getting more information on what&#39;s right about his<br/>
decision, both compassion-wise and health-wise that you and he can share<br/>
with others and perhaps educate them. I would recommend you seek out<br/>
others who are acting on the strength of their compassion. Perhaps you<br/>
could go to a veggie pot luck and meeting. Get a vegetarian cookbook out<br/>
of the library and make some new dishes and one to share with others.<br/>
You might find people he likes to be with on this or at least just see<br/>
that there are other people who believe and act similarly. <br/>
<br/>
There are others things he can do with his commitment too. Show him (and<br/>
yourself) that not all others are indifferent to these concerns. You can<br/>
find groups both on the internet and probably in your local area who<br/>
believe in animal rights and work to save them. This would include<br/>
activist groups who expose and protest against &quot;factory farming&quot; and<br/>
inhumane treatment of animals for commercial purposes, as well as<br/>
vegetarian groups. Maybe you&#39;ll both make a donation to such a group, or<br/>
write a letter to a legislature to change a law. If you keep expanding<br/>
your and his knowledge and experiences in this area, you&#39;ll both be able<br/>
to hold your position better and better.<br/>
<br/>
If you talk about character building to your friend who thinks you are<br/>
nuts, perhaps she&#39;ll get a reality adjustment. People end up taking<br/>
drugs these days instead of learning how to deal with life or live up to<br/>
their intentions. Hold firm, girl! You and your son are setting a good<br/>
example for others: he is acting on what he believes in and you are<br/>
backing him up. Congratulations, and welcome to humanity with all its<br/>
good intentions and flaws. He&#39;ll be able to hold his own position and<br/>
consult his own conscience better in the future because of this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907907696">have you seen the book OK, So Now You&#39;re a Vegetarian by Lauren Butts?  It&#39;s written by a teenager, so it&#39;s got some fun kid-friendly recipies in it (tacos, pizza, etc).  Alas, the teenage author went (goes?) to school, so a 6 yo unschooler may be a bit befuddled by the references to home ec class... nonetheless, it&#39;s not bad in terms of recipies.  <br/>
