<br/>
 A dissatisfaction with instruction at other schools: 73%<br/>

By Janice Lloyd, USA TODAY<br/>
The ranks of America&#39;s home-schooled children have continued a steady<br/>
climb over the past five years, and new research suggests broader<br/>
reasons for the appeal.<br/>
<br/>
The number of home-schooled kids hit 1.5 million in 2007, up 74% from<br/>
when the Department of Education&#39;s National Center for Education<br/>
Statistics started keeping track in 1999, and up 36% since 2003. The<br/>
percentage of the school-age population that was home-schooled<br/>
increased from 2.2% in 2003 to 2.9% in 2007. &quot;There&#39;s no reason to<br/>
believe it would not keep going up,&quot; says Gail Mulligan, a<br/>
statistician at the center.<br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, the biggest motivations for parents to teach their<br/>
children at home have been moral or religious reasons, and that<br/>
remains a top pick when parents are asked to explain their choice.<br/>
<br/>
The 2003 survey gave parents six reasons to pick as their motivation.<br/>
(They could choose more than one.) The 2007 survey added a seventh: an<br/>
interest in a &quot;non-traditional approach,&quot; a reference to parents<br/>
dubbed &quot;unschoolers,&quot; who regard standard curriculum methods and<br/>
standardized testing as counterproductive to a quality education.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We wanted to identify the parents who are part of the &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>
movement,&quot; Mulligan says. The &quot;unschooling&quot; group is viewed by<br/>
educators as a subset of home-schoolers, who generally follow standard<br/>
curriculum and grading systems. &quot;Unschoolers&quot; create their own systems.<br/>
<br/>
The category of &quot;other reasons&quot; rose to 32% in 2007 from 20% in 2003<br/>
and included family time and finances. That suggests the demographics<br/>
are expanding beyond conservative Christian groups, says Robert<br/>
Kunzman, an associate professor at Indiana University&#39;s School of<br/>
Education. Anecdotal evidence indicates many parents want their kids<br/>
to learn at their own pace, he says.<br/>
<br/>
Fewer home-schoolers were enrolled part time in traditional schools to<br/>
study subjects their parents lack knowledge to teach. Eighteen percent<br/>
were enrolled part time in 1999 and 2003, compared with 16% in 2007.<br/>
Kunzman says this might be because of the availability of online<br/>
instruction.<br/>
<br/>
The 2007 estimates are based on data from the Parent and Family<br/>
Involvement in Education Survey of the National Household Education<br/>
Surveys. Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research<br/>
Institute, says the estimates are low because home-schooling parents<br/>
&quot;are significantly less likely to answer government-sponsored surveys.&quot;</div>

Thanks for bringing that link.  I&#39;ve added it here:<br/>

It&#39;s not that they want to identify unschoolers, it&#39;s that the last  <br/>
time they did a survey their options didn&#39;t have a good reason for  <br/>
unschoolers to choose.  &quot;None of the above&quot; isn&#39;t very informative  <br/>
(if that was even an option).<br/>

I think the religious homeschoolers stats are high all over the U.S.<br/>

<br/>
I looked at the reason for wanting to identify unschoolers is because<br/>
the author perhaps understood how different unschoolers are than<br/>
&quot;average&quot; homeschoolers.  I mean in terms of reasons to homeschool we<br/>
couldn&#39;t be any further apart??  IMO.<br/>
