<div id="ygrps-yiv-225796617">I should probably stay out of this, but I&#39;m not going to.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason this exchange has really affected me, maybe because I&#39;ve<br/>
got some yucky stuff going on here too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need to defend Sandra, she can do that herself.  And I&#39;m not<br/>
trying to.  I just want to explain my position.<br/>
<br/>
I came here a few years ago, never posted, read a lot and got angry a<br/>
lot.  I thought we were unschooling, I had read so much for years on the<br/>
subject and while I had never personally met anyone who did it (still<br/>
haven&#39;t, by the way), I thought we were doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I unsubbed in anger a few times over the past few years, but the stuff I<br/>
read here sunk in. I may have hated the advice (even if it wasn&#39;t<br/>
directed toward me) but I took most of it to heart.  Our family has<br/>
changed for the better, a lot due to Sandra (and Mary, and Ren, and<br/>
Joyce, and Pam, and etc...) and I have never thanked any of them for it.<br/>
<br/>
I still get pissed sometimes when I read certain things, but I realize<br/>
now that I&#39;m angry for a reason.  And I think about the information<br/>
being passed on to me by people who have more experience, and I&#39;m<br/>
grateful to them.<br/>
<br/>
So thank you to everyone who continues to put up with inflexible people<br/>
(including me, even though I do it quietly at home and not on the<br/>
list).  Keep up the good work, I know I need and value it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-56925172">Kate -- there are so MANY of us unschooling in California -- if you <br/>
want to get together with other unschoolers, I betcha we could make <br/>
that happen. Write to me. Your note was very encouraging!!!!<br/>
