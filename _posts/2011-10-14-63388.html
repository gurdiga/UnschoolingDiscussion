<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384121426">Hello I am new here.  <br/>
<br/>
I was a pretty radical unschooler til my son was about 6.  He went to school one semester before i pulled him out then put him in another one semester pulled him out again.  He is almost eight now and I never established boundaries when he was very young and so now he argues with me on everything.  I have studied a lot of waldorf philosophy regarding the six seven year change which i found really helpful.  he is past that now and he is very ... to say it positive... persistent.  to say it negatively he harrasses me and i often have to separate myself from him because he won&#39;t take no for an answer 99 percent of the time.  He needs a lot of physical stimulation which is very draining.  He is constantly putting things in my face no matter how much i tell him not to OR climbing on my back/ shoulders any chance he gets.  We are an only parent/ only child dynamic which intesifies things...  <br/>
<br/>
he is totally resistant to anything to do with school.  he loves harry potter: listening, reading, watching, riding bike/ scooter, watching animal documentaries, stories...  <br/>
<br/>
I want advice regarding how your children learned to read.  I know many children teach themselves but don&#39;t see that happening with my son...  i no longer consider myself a pure unschooler, not since my son was 5...  i had very little support in the freedom i allowed him... and did not have a partner in protection of such... and now he is older and very controlling of me and so I do have to have boundaries with him now.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>

<br/>
Stories regarding how other people&#39;s children learned to read might not be &quot;advice.&quot;<br/>
The advice is leave him alone about reading, or you can do the same damage school does.<br/>
<br/>
The stories are here, and there are dozens of them.  Please read them slowly and thoughtfully, because rushing through and dinging the bell &quot;done&quot; won&#39;t help.  Learning about unschooling isn&#39;t a speed activity.  Cramming never helps. :-)<br/>

There are other things on Joyce&#39;s page, too.<br/>

<br/>
But if you don&#39;t consider yourself a pure unschooler, these things might not work for you.  If you intend to withhold the opportunity for him to learn on his own (not &quot;teach himself,&quot; but to grow into it in his own way in his own time, while he&#39;s learning a thousand other things too), then these ideas and this advice might not work for you.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-i had very little support in the freedom i allowed him-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean you&#39;re living with relatives or other  housemates?  Or maybe you&#39;ve had pressure from parents?  I&#39;m only guessing because you dropped an unclear hint.  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of arguing, a lot of &quot;no,&quot; and a lot of &quot;have to.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Constantly&quot; and &quot;99 percent of the time&quot; sound harsh and extreme.  When does he have time for all this?   &quot;harry potter: listening, reading, watching, riding bike/ scooter, watching animal documentaries, stories... &quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For your own sake, for clarity, in private, try to rephrase that last statement.  It&#39;s a lot of words.  ARE the two of you &quot;a dynamic&quot;?  I think it intensifies things to layer words on between you and what simply is.    You have a son.  You can be his friend or his enemy.  <br/>

Arguing isn&#39;t a bad thing.  If you can&#39;t explain why something should be done, or if your point is arbitrary, or if you&#39;re exaggerating your side and saying no all the time, arguing is sensible and good.   If you could think of it as a discussion, as a strength, and respond to the arguments respectfully as you would to an adult friend, there might never be another argument, only conversations.<br/>

<br/>
Is &quot;about 6&quot; five?   Because &quot;almost eight&quot; is seven.<br/>
<br/>
If he went to school half  a year at five, and half a year at six or seven, I question whether you were ever an unschooler before that.  I&#39;m not saying this to be mean, I&#39;m saying it because it&#39;s a problem when people identify themselves as &quot;pretty radical unschoolers&quot; but  their kids go to school at five or six, right on schedule.  The problem is partly for those trying to understand what unschooling is and what it means, but more than that it&#39;s a problem for that parent who has used words in ways that get in the way of clarity.<br/>
<br/>
Would you say that before your son went to school you were parenting mindfully or that you were following the precepts of attachment parenting?  I&#39;m  asking not because the list needs the answer, but because it will help you to untangle the threads of what might have gone awry, so you can move forward today in a clearer direction.  <br/>
<br/>
So he&#39;s seven and has been in school for two semesters.  In two different school years, I&#39;m guessing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-he is totally resistant to anything to do with school.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Good.  That&#39;s the only way to get to unschooling from anywhere.  First, the cold turkey from anything to do with school.  But if he&#39;s being &quot;resistant,&quot; then he must be getting some pressure.  Resistance can only exist in the face of pressure.<br/>

argument! Can you give us some examples?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; persistent. to say it negatively he harrasses me and i often have to  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are you saying no to that he needs to be persistent about?<br/>
<br/>
If he feels it&#39;s kind of random which of his needs will be met, he&#39;ll  <br/>
ask for way more than he needs. If he needs &quot;10&quot; and you say yes to 5  <br/>
out of 10 requests, how many requests does he need to make to be  <br/>
fairly certain of getting 10? (If my math is correct, 30 request will  <br/>
get pretty close to 10.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He needs a lot of physical stimulation which is very draining.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And imagine what it&#39;s like to be bursting with that need. Imagine what  <br/>
it&#39;s like asking for it and being turned down. I&#39;m not saying that to  <br/>
make you feel guilty. What you need is a mental shift away from  <br/>
thinking he needs more than you can give.<br/>
<br/>
If someone needs 3 glasses of water a day and only gets 2, they&#39;ll  <br/>
spend the rest of the day trying to get that 3rd glass. So it will  <br/>
seem to others like this person&#39;s constantly thirsty and can never get  <br/>
enough. But if he gets 3 glasses and can have as many as he wants, he  <br/>
won&#39;t seem thirsty at all.<br/>
<br/>
He can&#39;t need less by being given less. He can&#39;t modify his needs to  <br/>
meet what you&#39;re willing to give. He can lose faith that you&#39;ll meet  <br/>
his needs. He can look elsewhere to others offering to give what you  <br/>
won&#39;t. (It&#39;s how predators work.)<br/>
<br/>
If you can mentally shift away from seeing his demands as too much to  <br/>
his needs being large and you as the one who is privileged with  <br/>
meeting them, it will help a lot.<br/>
<br/>
It will also help to shift away from stuffing down your own needs to  <br/>
meet his. Shift to finding ways to meet his needs AND yours. His needs  <br/>
take precedence since he doesn&#39;t have the power to meet his own but  <br/>
you have the power to manipulate the world to meet his and yours.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He is constantly putting things in my face no matter how much i tell  <br/>
&gt; him not to OR climbing on my back/ shoulders any chance he gets.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are you doing when he does that? It sounds like he wants your  <br/>
full attention. Kathryn would put her hands on my face even though I  <br/>
told her I didn&#39;t like it, but it was her way of saying I wasn&#39;t being  <br/>
present enough. I was off in my head, physically there but not  <br/>
mentally there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when he does that he needs you to roughhouse with him then.  <br/>
Don&#39;t see it as rewarding him for doing what you don&#39;t like but as an  <br/>
indication that you aren&#39;t noticing early enough that he needs your  <br/>
attention. See the touching as his last resort to communicate with you  <br/>
because all the more subtle acceptable ways weren&#39;t working.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We are an only parent/ only child dynamic which intesifies things...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it will. It will help if you can get some older kids and adults  <br/>
who like physical play into his life. Team sports? Martial arts?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he is totally resistant to anything to do with school. he loves  <br/>
&gt; harry potter: listening, reading, watching, riding bike/ scooter,  <br/>
&gt; watching animal documentaries, stories...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you want him to be not resistant to school? What do you want  <br/>
school to do for you?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want advice regarding how your children learned to read. I know  <br/>
&gt; many children teach themselves but don&#39;t see that happening with my  <br/>
&gt; son...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s still young for reading, especially for a boy. 6-10 is typical  <br/>
for boys. But 12, 14 isn&#39;t unusual for either sex.<br/>
<br/>
It will help not to think of learning to read as teaching themselves.  <br/>
Teaching suggests it&#39;s a simple mechanical process that kids will  <br/>
figure out. But if the various brain areas aren&#39;t mature enough to do  <br/>
their part in the decoding, he physically can&#39;t read, no matter what  <br/>
anyone does.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s in a print rich environment, if his experiences with print are  <br/>
positive, if there&#39;s text that&#39;s useful for what he&#39;s interested in,  <br/>
he will read when he can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  i no longer consider myself a pure unschooler, not since my son was  <br/>
&gt; 5... i had very little support in the freedom i allowed him... and  <br/>
&gt; did not have a partner in protection of such... and now he is older  <br/>
&gt; and very controlling of me and so I do have to have boundaries with  <br/>
&gt; him now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Freedom is probably not the best concept to raise kids by. Meeting and  <br/>
supporting their needs is much better.<br/>
<br/>
Freedom suggests doing whatever you want without regard to others. If  <br/>
you&#39;re there to meet his needs, you can do it in ways that are  <br/>
respectful of you, him and others, kind, safe and any other principles  <br/>
a situation calls for.<br/>
<br/>
Your whole post sounds like you&#39;re gritting your teeth and putting up  <br/>
with him. And that&#39;s because you&#39;re in a mental place of this being  <br/>
more than you can handle and if he&#39;d just need less, you could meet  <br/>
his needs. But he needs what he needs. That&#39;s not going to change. The  <br/>
only one you can change is you.<br/>
<br/>
But trying harder isn&#39;t going to work! It will mean just gritting you  <br/>
teeth harder. You need a big mental shift away from where you are  <br/>
that&#39;s causing you to grit your teeth.<br/>

I don&#39;t think studying waldorf has ever led anyone closer to a good relationship with a child.<br/>
Each child is different, and every moment is an opportunity to do better:<br/>

That&#39;s about living in moments rather than in days.  By your own account, it seems you&#39;re living in years.  There was a hard year.  You studied for it.  He&#39;s past it.  How many moments in that year went by as missed opportunities because they were seen as a small part of &quot;the six seven year change&quot;?<br/>

If you are interested in hearing someone talk about their experiences (and willing to pay), recordings are available from some of the unschooling conferences (Live and Learn, Life Is Good, Good Vibrations).  You can find some presentations on reading (and other topics) by contacting the organizers or searching online.

<br/>
Another way of thinking about this is that You are choosing to argue with Him. What are you arguing about? Can you find a way to help and support him instead? Can you find ways to compromise rather than arguing? He&#39;s not going to learn that if you keep fighting with him!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; He is constantly putting things in my face no matter how much i tell him not to OR climbing on my back/ shoulders any chance he gets.  We are an only parent/ only child dynamic which intesifies things... <br/>
 </span></blockquote>********************<br/>
<br/>
Find ways to engage him First - that&#39;s important. And find ways to give him enough of what he needs as often as he needs. When you pull back and say &quot;enough&quot; when He&#39;s not done, then the need is still there. It&#39;s like being 3/4 of the way dry - you&#39;re still damp and sticky and uncomfortable! <br/>
<br/>
A very good book with lots of ideas for different physical activities is The Out of Sync Child. It doesn&#39;t matter if you son has &quot;sensory integration disorder&quot; which is the topic of the book, the various ideas for ways to engage with a child who needs a lot of certain kinds of stimulation is a boon. <br/>
<br/>
If he likes climbing, help him find things to climb Often. If he likes lots of very intense touch, look for ways to touch him - offer him a massage, scratch his back, things like that. Offer to do it before he asks. Waiting and saying &quot;no&quot; to his needs won&#39;t help him - he needs your help figuring out how to Meet his needs in ways that work in real life. You may find some useful ideas here:<br/>
