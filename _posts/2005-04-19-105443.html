<div id="ygrps-yiv-544931011">Hello, I have been emailing with Pam Genant (inspired by her work for the<br/>
Live and Learn Conference) about setting up a new yahoo group for<br/>
unschoolers.  We thought it would be a good idea to run it by the readers of<br/>
this list, to get your ideas feedback editing and suggestions.  The list<br/>
(unless someone thinks of a better name) would be called &quot;Unschooling<br/>
Events.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Description:<br/>
This is a list dedicated to announcing unschooling events across the United<br/>
States.  These events are open to families, or teens who can travel alone,<br/>
who want to meet, play and learn with other unschooling families and teens.<br/>
<br/>
Event Guidelines<br/>
- All events are geared toward unschoolers.  Anyone is welcome to attend,<br/>
but the assumption at all of these events will be that unschooling is the<br/>
optimal educational option that one could provide a child.<br/>
- All events will last at least a full day.<br/>
- When posting an event, the coordinator will provide lodging information<br/>
for out-of-town travelers.  This might include unschooling families who<br/>
would be willing to host a family or traveling teens.<br/>
- Event postings will include a contact person and phone number, as well as<br/>
a clear address and directions, to assist people traveling from out of town.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer(?)<br/>
- Obviously, neither Yahoo nor the moderators of this list can accept<br/>
responsibility for the safety of your families and teens. Use all of your<br/>
common sense and the normal precautions against sending yourselves or your<br/>
families to gatherings hosted by people you don&#39;t yet know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once we get the list up and running, the hope is that someone from each<br/>
state could host one mini-conference or fun-unschooling-gathering, once a<br/>
year.  This would giving us all lots of opportunities to network with other<br/>
unschoolers throughout the year, if and when we have the chance to travel to<br/>
a neighboring (or far flung) state.</div>
