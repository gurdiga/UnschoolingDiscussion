having self-control and point THAT out to him, so you&#39;re supporting what he <br/>
IS able to do rather than focusing on the times he blows it.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing -- when he DOES blow it, I&#39;d assume he feels bad about doing so <br/>
and I&#39;d comfort him specifically for that. If you punish him in some way, <br/>
he&#39;s going to feel punished for something he didn&#39;t actually have control <br/>
over and that is going to just add to the pressure on him when he&#39;s next <br/>
faced with a similar situation.<br/>
<br/>
Try to articulate reasons why it isn&#39;t acceptable behavior- go deep, beyond <br/>
just that it isn&#39;t nice. What is it about hitting that is so bad? What <br/>
feelings is he having when he hits? I&#39;d bet on &quot;frustation&quot; --- notice <br/>
frustration happening in stories you&#39;re reading -- use the word &quot;frustration&quot; <br/>
as in &quot;Wow, so-and-so was probably really frustrated when his freckle juice <br/>
didn&#39;t work &lt;G&gt;, what would you do if that happened to you?  --- make up <br/>
stories together about frustrations that happen to kids, make it only thinly <br/>
veiled about him - use his name, even. Let HIM finish the stories sometimes - <br/>
and don&#39;t cringe if he finishes them violently on occasion. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519803519">These books were lifesavers for me. When dh switched to the stay-home <br/>
role, it was terrible until I got him the 4 year old book. Within <br/>
minutes he had really eased up on the little guy. I really think he <br/>
thought he was seven.<br/>

P. S. I did try to change the subject line, but for unknown reasons my <br/>
software didn&#39;t let me.<br/>
