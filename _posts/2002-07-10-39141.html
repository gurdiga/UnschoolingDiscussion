<div id="ygrps-yiv-552861015"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Care to explain &quot;distributive property&quot; to those of us who were reduced <br/>
&gt; to tears by long division in 4th grade?  ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tuck<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps it will make you feel better if I told you I had to sit down and <br/>
scratch my head for 20 minutes to figure out how to explain this.  For those <br/>
of you who are math-averse, you might have to read this several times to <br/>
understand it.<br/>
<br/>
When you do the multiplicaton problem 3 x 9, you can make it more interesting <br/>
by writing the 9 as 4+5:<br/>
<br/>
       3 x (4 + 5)<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that you can multiply the 3 by the 4 and 5 separately, and add <br/>
them together to get the answer:<br/>
<br/>
       3 x (4 + 5) = (3 x 4) + (3 x 5) = 12 + 15 = 27<br/>
<br/>
Cool, eh?  You get the same answer as when you just multiply 3 x 9 = 27.  If <br/>
this seems mysterious, draw a 3 x 9 rectangle and draw the 27 squares inside <br/>
it.  Now draw a bold line to separate it into two rectangles: a 3x4 and a 3x5 <br/>
rectangle.  One rectangle represents the problem 3x4 = 12, and the other <br/>
represents 3x5 = 15, and together these equal 27.<br/>
       So the distributive property says you can split one of the numbers <br/>
being multiplied and do two separate multiplication problems.  (You can split <br/>
it into three or more numbers too)<br/>
       Long division is the reverse of this.  When you divide a large number <br/>
by a smaller number, the large number splits up into several pieces and you <br/>
do several separate division problems.  For example divide 4991 by 23 (do it <br/>
now if you want to understand what follows).  The answer is 217.  The series <br/>
of guessed multiplication problems and subtraction shows you that 4991 can be <br/>
split into three numbers: 4600 + 230 + 161.  Each of these divides evenly by <br/>
23:<br/>
<br/>
       4600 / 23 = 200       230 / 23 = 10           161 / 23 = 7<br/>
<br/>
and 200 + 10 + 7 = 217.  In other words, the whole process is the opposite of <br/>
the multiplication problem<br/>
<br/>
       23 x 217 = 23 x (200 + 10 + 7) = 4600 + 230 + 161 = 4991<br/>
<br/>
So there you go.  Perhaps you didn&#39;t learn this in 4th grade.  It&#39;s not <br/>
likely you learned it in high school either.<br/>
       People who think that drilling kids with paper and pencil arithmetic <br/>
is all-important justify it by saying that it teaches basic concepts used <br/>
later.  But this seems backwards.  It makes sense to learn a practical skill <br/>
without understanding it if you are going to use it a lot.  But if you say <br/>
you are teaching for understanding, you should focus on the concept before <br/>
teaching the skill that is based on it, or at least be sure that the concept <br/>
follows shortly.  In the case of long division, practically no one uses it <br/>
later - they use calculators - and no one understands the basic concepts it <br/>
is supposed to illuminate.<br/>
       I&#39;m not going to teach my kids long division, unless they ask me to <br/>
show them.  I&#39;ll teach them multiplication and division by drawing rectangles <br/>
and using lots of manipulatives before they do the written versions.  In my <br/>
mind, it is much more important to thoroughly know that division is the <br/>
opposite of multiplication and that it involves guessing the answer.  Long <br/>
division is just a refined and efficient way to guess the answer.<br/>
       I have actually asked high-school students, after they have completed <br/>
a division problem, &quot;How would figure out whether that&#39;s the right answer?&quot;  <br/>
Some of them, after a long pause and a few prompts, will say something like <br/>
&quot;work backwards and do the multiplication problem to see if you get the first <br/>
number,&quot; but most will just draw a blank.  Or they&#39;ll say to do it over to <br/>
see if you get the same answer again, which takes longer.  Teaching long <br/>
division doesn&#39;t generally teach kids the underlying concepts.<br/>
       But you never know.  Maybe an asteroid heading toward earth some day <br/>
will break into several thousand little asteroids and destroy all the <br/>
calculator factories in the world.  In that case, it will be a good thing we <br/>
all know how to do long division, if we happen to actually remember it.<br/>
<br/>
Egads, I think there&#39;s a whole book chapter in this.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>

lucky for me, after the tests and school were over, I rarely had to use them <br/>

I have only found the rare drug, the pharmacy doesn&#39;t tell you exactly how <br/>
much to dispense, maybe two times in the last few years. I can most times do <br/>
simple multiplication and division in my head, but if you add on more numbers <br/>
then I am searching for pad and pencil. Someday, I am going to call my <br/>
bestfriend up and ask for some more tutoring sessions, this *almost* &lt;g&gt; <br/>
looked fun! Thanks for the easy to understand, clear explanation!<br/>

But I don&#39;t quite get the division part.  It makes perfect sense when I see <br/>
it already done, but how do you decide which smaller numbers to separate <br/>
the big number into?  If I look at it, I can easily see that 4600 and 230 <br/>
are evenly divisible by 23, but I&#39;m not sure I would ever have thought to <br/>
use those two specific numbers.  And I *never* have guessed that 161 would <br/>
be evenly divisible by 23.  So I guess my question is how to decide which <br/>
numbers to split the big one into.  That doesn&#39;t seem intuitive to me at <br/>
all, just more guessing, like long division.<br/>

***************<br/>
Loren, I just wanted you to know, I not only got something out of it--<br/>
I copied it to share with my husband--and a few other folks!!! LOL <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read much on this list in quite some time, because I <br/>
haven&#39;t been around, but really needed to read some encouraging words <br/>
today and your post was the first one I read. It really hit the spot <br/>
as the discussion lately has been regarding &quot;required&quot; math--with <br/>
the &quot;discuss-ees&quot; being my mother, mother-in-law, a good friend and <br/>
my husband, who all just can&#39;t get it through their head, that my 13 <br/>
and 14 year old kids ARE learning math--in real life, daily <br/>
situations as the need arises, not some asbtract concept out of a <br/>
book. Concepts that I don&#39;t understand most of the time, or use, or <br/>
are even used by most adults I know. My mother keeps asking &quot;who is <br/>
teaching them geometry and algebra&quot;; my friend says they &quot;need&quot; those <br/>
things, especially for college (yet in the next breath she admitted <br/>
she doesn&#39;t understand math, that even with a college degree, she <br/>
still can&#39;t balance her checkbook); my husband feels like &quot;we learned <br/>
it, so should they&quot; and my mother-in-law just doesn&#39;t understand un-<br/>
schooling at all, so she doesn&#39;t get any of it! LOL I have spent most <br/>
of the last couple of days second-guessing what and how I am doing <br/>
things. It&#39;s so nice to come here and be reassured that others feel <br/>
exactly the way I do. <br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s my long way of saying thanks, Loren, for working on that <br/>
post. I got more out of it than you probably intended, but it was <br/>
exactly what I needed! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853981257">You&#39;re not alone!  My daughter just had her ninth birthday, and one <br/>
of the things she asked for was the Presto Chango game.  She had <br/>
played it at a friend&#39;s house and since right now she&#39;s really into <br/>
money, she thought it would help her understand making change <br/>
better.  My mom (a math teacher) got her the game and played it with <br/>
her after the party.  Afterward, she called me and asked me about <br/>
teaching math, saying that there are some six year olds who could <br/>

are doing it the &quot;right way&quot; (school-at-home, using Abeka video <br/>

Homeschooling. I&#39;m sure she quizzes each of them and after 10 minutes <br/>
with their kids and older siblings (she is on staff as Preschool <br/>
Director) decides that they are doing everything right and I am doing <br/>
it wrong with her grandchildren. They aren&#39;t learning the things <br/>
*she* thinks they need to learn. <br/>
<br/>
But after two years and going on a third, there is no doubt in my <br/>
mind, they ARE learning, just not what their peers are. Jordan (14/m) <br/>
is a visual child and loves to draw. (Not to mention he is incredibly <br/>
talented) He will probably not be a neurosurgeon, but who cares? We <br/>
constantly stress to do what you *love*. Yes, you want to make a <br/>

every day hating the job you do, what is the point??? If Jordan&#39;s <br/>

beach in Florida, then so be it. As long as he&#39;s happy and doing <br/>
something to the best of his ability and with all his heart, my <br/>
mother can go fly a kite! And if he turns out to be a neurosurgeon, <br/>
that&#39;s great, too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624239706">Thanks, for the vote of encouragement.  I agree whole heartedly.  Yes, we learn together, but I let my daughter of 17, help decide what she wants to do.  She has to be happy now and in the future.  She was formerly schooled, but wasn&#39;t happy and neither was I, so about 2 years we tried this, she is much happier and is thinking about the future and what she plans on doing.  She is definitely very independent, loves life and I know she will go far.  Thanks<br/>

Wen I am asked about homeschooling (the whys and hows) I always <br/>

right along with our kids. Thngs that I &quot;forgot&quot; or never really knew <br/>
(you know that paying attention in class thing)--I&#39;m learning as <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6012803"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But I don&#39;t quite get the division part.  It makes perfect sense when I see <br/>
&gt; it already done, but how do you decide which smaller numbers to separate <br/>
&gt; the big number into?  If I look at it, I can easily see that 4600 and 230 <br/>
&gt; are evenly divisible by 23, but I&#39;m not sure I would ever have thought to <br/>
&gt; use those two specific numbers.  And I *never* have guessed that 161 would <br/>
&gt; be evenly divisible by 23.  So I guess my question is how to decide which <br/>
&gt; numbers to split the big one into.  That doesn&#39;t seem intuitive to me at <br/>
&gt; all, just more guessing, like long division.<br/>
&gt; Tia<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re right - it&#39;s not intuitive at all.  Long division is a clever <br/>
&gt; process that breaks the guessing down into smaller steps.  You make one <br/>
&gt; guess for each digit.  When you multiply and then subtract, you find what&#39;s <br/>
&gt; left over and you start guessing again.  Guessing once for each digit of <br/>
&gt; the number you&#39;re dividing is far easier than trying to guess the whole <br/>
&gt; answer at once, and less time-consuming if you don&#39;t have a calculator <br/>
&gt; (assuming you remember the process).<br/>
&gt;     The distributive property was a guiding principle for whoever invented <br/>
&gt; long division, but you can see how it applies only after the whole problem <br/>
&gt; is done.<br/>
