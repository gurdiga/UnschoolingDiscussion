tape their speakers and are they available for purchase?  Will the <br/>

2006 will probably be in St Louis. I like St Louis, and I&#39;m thinking my  <br/>
hiatus will be long enough that I&#39;ll want it back by then---at least for a  year.<br/>
 <br/>
2007 is tentatively requested by Rebecca, but she has yet to attend a  <br/>
conference, just moved, and is expecting---or just had---a new baby. It may be  more <br/>
than she can handle! &lt;G&gt; She&#39;ll be at the next two, and we&#39;ll hold  her hand. <br/>
If she decides NOT to, we&#39;ve had two other offers on the west coast,  so <br/>
we&#39;ll see. <br/>
 <br/>
Maryland/DC area has requested 2008. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Then we&#39;ll work our way back across the country!<br/>

<br/>
Any special reason for St. Louis??  I ask because I am really wanting to<br/>
coordinate a L&L Conference in Sioux Falls, SD ~ mostly because I think<br/>
EVERYONE (&#39;cept for me, Kelli & Melanie) should drive 1200+ miles and know<br/>
that it&#39;s WORTH IT!!  Honestly though, Sioux Falls is an amazing<br/>
family-friendly place, not at all *vegas like* in atmosphere, close enough<br/>
to big cities, should families want that kind of entertainment, but far<br/>
enough away for families to feel like this is really a VACATION and not a<br/>
spend-fest. Our mall, for the shoppers, is the world&#39;s largest single-story;<br/>
our zoo is fun; we&#39;ve a children&#39;s science center (reciprocates with most<br/>
national museums) with an art pavilion (free); and we&#39;ve got lots of parks.<br/>
There&#39;s an airport worth the extra $50 to fly into ~ it&#39;s tiny and friendly!<br/>
There has to be a hotel in town small enough for us to take over and still<br/>
big enough to meet our conference room needs.  I am sincere in my offer...<br/>
should we do St. Louis anyway, I&#39;m pretty close and willing to help with<br/>
whatever it takes to make L&L happen nearby!! :)<br/>

So  Kelly, will you be *living* in St. Louis?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
No, but I *have* lived in Belleville, IL, just over the river. I still have  <br/>
lots of contacts---and I know the area. I&#39;ll be going up a few times for  <br/>
scouting and contract signings----and I won&#39;t be complaining. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
We were stationed there @Scott AFB in the early &#39;90s. When I found out we  <br/>
were moving to the Midwest, I almost divorced Ben! &lt;G&gt; I thought I was  moving <br/>
to the armpit of the country. To my surprise, I fell in LOVE with the  area. <br/>
 <br/>
I have a place to stay while working on it, plus I get to visit with an old  <br/>
friend. Be good for me all around.<br/>
 <br/>
I really like the idea of the &quot;Travelling Unschooling Show.&quot; &lt;g&gt; I  like <br/>
visiting different parts of the country---and I think others do too.  This will <br/>
also give locals the opportunity to show off their state/region as  well as <br/>
everyone else to see different parts of the country each year.<br/>
 <br/>
It truly doesn&#39;t seem to matter *where* it&#39;s held----People came for two  <br/>
years to little old Columbia, SC, for Holt&#39;s sake. &lt;g&gt; If it travels,  maybe more <br/>
people, like---ahem---BETSY!, will be able to participate----if not  every <br/>
year, then maybe every three or four?<br/>
 <br/>
Why, is that *your* home? &lt;g&gt; Do I have an assistant?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I would love for it to be in SD also.  Not only is it closer for me &lt;g&gt; but I&#39;ve heard from so many people that there are so many interesting things there.   I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t done  a lot of them,  with it only be 4-6 hours away from me.   Lots of history, rocks/stones, and the Mammoth dig,  are a few things that come to mind.<br/>
