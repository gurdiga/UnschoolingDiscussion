The concept of rules as opposed to principles at its heart seems to <br/>
be one of locus of control. Rules are other determined. Principles <br/>
are collaboratively utilized. <br/>

Erik doesn&#39;t actually know the word &quot;rules&quot; other than when we have <br/>
read a sign somewhere and we have the choice to be present (like a <br/>
restaurant or other establishment) if we comply with their rules <br/>
(shoes required, kitchen off limits, no dogs allowed, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Principles have reasons for which one chooses to conduct oneself. <br/>
Rules have reasons for which others desire us to conduct ourselves.<br/>

If Jayn has some toys or dvd&#39;s that for some reason of her own she does not<br/>
want to share that day, I put them out of sight. Sometimes the visitor<br/>
remembers the item and asks for it so I say something like the above<br/>
statement, rather than saying &quot;Jayn doesn&#39;t want you to use that&quot; or<br/>
anything unkind. The principle at work is Jayn&#39;s choice of ownership, and<br/>
not forcing sharing. Believe me, we have enough stuff in our house that no<br/>
visitor would be completely bereft of any interesting toys just because a<br/>
couple have been designated &quot;special&quot; that day. <br/>
<br/>
I no longer feel any need to query Jayn as to her reasons behind wanting<br/>
things put up, although I am sometimes surprised by her becoming unusually<br/>
possessive of certain items. It could look arbitrary to a third party I<br/>
suppose, but I know that Jayn has a real reason in her mind for wanting to<br/>
separate something from general usage. I follow her lead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I agree with your distinction, but I also think that <br/>
according to your definition there is a place for both rules *and* <br/>
principles.  Principles work great within our family because of the <br/>
kind of relationship we have with each other, but when our house is <br/>
full of other people&#39;s children I have no problem having &quot;rules&quot; for <br/>
those children, especially if those rules protect our property and <br/>
ensure my own childrens&#39; peace of mind.  Living by principle seems <br/>
to depend greatly on how much you care about the people your <br/>
decisions will impact, and as much as neighborhood children may have <br/>
a good time at our house I can&#39;t say they necessarily care about how <br/>
their actions will affect our home and family.  Today an 8yo <br/>
neighbor was here playing with my children, and while I was busy <br/>
downstairs he basically trashed my 5yo&#39;s bedroom and toy collection <br/>
(my 5yo wasn&#39;t even here).  He&#39;ll certainly be welcome back again, <br/>
but the next time I&#39;ll make sure that he knows our &quot;rule&quot; is to have <br/>
permission to enter someone&#39;s bedroom and use their things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180512562">Thank you for the clarification. I thought the toys were unavailable <br/>
to Jayn by you. Not that she determined their availability for <br/>
others. Children are certainly possessive of some things and don&#39;t <br/>
have to share them. Just as we are possessive of some things and we <br/>
don&#39;t have to share them.<br/>

<br/>
I think the biggest issue is that most kids are so rule-bound that they have a very hard time operating outside rules without &quot;going crazy.&quot; I have been holding a 4-H Rock Hounds club at my home so the kids could use the climbing wall, and the lack of respect once they got out of their parents sight was astounding. Now, all of these kids are homeschooled, but those who acted really badly, were children from very religious, school-at-home families. Without fail, I watched their behavior disintigrate as soon as their moms were somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I just let my group know that I was &quot;burned out&quot; and would not be having any more meetings at my house. We&#39;ll just be doing field trips from now on, thank you very much.<br/>

Yes, I&#39;ve had some of those kids at my house.<br/>
And the prize-winning WORST batch had an army captain father, a &quot;don&#39;t touch <br/>
me you&#39;ll muss the nails&quot; mother, and they were required to say &quot;yes sir&quot; and <br/>
&quot;no ma&#39;am&quot; to anything that moved.   But when they got to my house they just <br/>
exploded into a freedom frenzy that was dangerous for our stuff and our pets!  <br/>
And &quot;try not to go crazy&quot; wasn&#39;t informational for them.   They were too used <br/>
to precise guidelines about each object, whether or not it could be touched, <br/>
picked up, carried to another place, or what.  &quot;Use your own judgment&quot; wasn&#39;t a <br/>
&quot;rule&quot; they could begin to understand.   They didnt have any judgment beyond <br/>
judging whether their parents were really gone and whether the adult left in <br/>
charge was likely to tattle on them (which would have mean spankings groundings <br/>
and forced apologies and not being able to come back to our house).<br/>

 <br/>
There was a horribly named show in ABC last night, called &quot;Wife  Swap&quot;.  It <br/>
was on after Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, which always moves  me to tears, <br/>
so I watch it.  I thought I would search for something else  when Wife Swap <br/>
came on, but they pulled me in.  It&#39;s where two families  switch mothers for a <br/>
couple of weeks to see what happens.<br/>
 <br/>
The one mom was the perfectionist mother who cleaned her house for 5 hours  <br/>
EVERY day.  The other mom, well, she was absolutely GREAT, until she lost  it <br/>
at the end and said she hated the other mom.  I kept expecting her to  say that <br/>
her kids don&#39;t go to school, that they&#39;re unschoolers.  I couldn&#39;t  tell what <br/>
the school situation was, though.  She didn&#39;t clean, she  didn&#39;t cook (the <br/>
dad it all).  She let her kids do whatever they wanted and  they had fun with <br/>
her and there were always extra kids there, playing guitar and  everything else. <br/>
 They also had 25 pets, including groundhogs and a  kangaroo and birds and <br/>
cats and lots of other things.  Most of the pets had  the run of the house, and <br/>
so you can imagine.  <br/>
 <br/>
Some of the comments that the teenage boys made were VERY telling, and it  <br/>
was such an example of respectful parenting (on the one unschooly-ish mom&#39;s  <br/>
part).<br/>
 <br/>
The teenager from the perfectionist&#39;s mom kept saying, &quot;We never  talk.&quot;  &quot;We <br/>
spend time alone in seperate parts of the house.&quot;  The  woman had put lists <br/>
all over the house about what the other mom was supposed to  do (including <br/>
cleaning the house 5 hours a day), and this boy had written on the  list on his <br/>
door &quot;Get me a cute kitten.&quot;  So, of course, the other mom went  right out and <br/>
got the boy a cat!  <br/>
 <br/>
The fun mom&#39;s teenager said, &quot;You made all these changes without consulting  <br/>
me.  I&#39;m not fine with this.&quot;  And, &quot;These animals are part of our  family.  <br/>
You can&#39;t get rid of them.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
All the perfectionist mom did for the other family is clean the house AND  <br/>
she got them a dining table so they could have dinner together.  (Besides  <br/>
putting 22 of the pets with a sitter for a couple of weeks, without  asking.)  She <br/>
insulted the father and told him he wasn&#39;t a parent, but a  &quot;friend&quot; to their <br/>
kids.  She made him put the 2 yo to bed at 8:00 p.m., and  of course she <br/>
wasn&#39;t sleepy and cried her eyes out.  To his credit he let  her out of the bed and <br/>
that didn&#39;t happen again.<br/>
 <br/>
By the end of the show, the uptight family was having food fights in the  <br/>
kitchen with the fun mom, and the dad, who had been required to play his jazz  <br/>
guitar with headphones on because his wife always insisted on quiet, got up in a <br/>
 restuarant and played his guitar with the band.  <br/>
 <br/>
That woman was SUCH a great influence on the uptight family.  If she&#39;s  not <br/>
an unschooler, she should be.<br/>

 <br/>
guitar with headphones on because his wife always insisted on quiet, got up <br/>
in a <br/>
 restuarant and played his guitar with the band.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And the mom who had been so uptight said that she had loosened up a lot, she <br/>
was letting her older son have friends over whenever he wanted to and they <br/>
kept the cat.  She said she was surprised at how much she loved that cat. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly blasted in where I was watching Henry V (one of my comfort background <br/>
movies) while I was doing other stuff and told me I really needed to watch the <br/>
rest of that show.  I guess we watched the second half.  Marty came along and <br/>
watched too in a bit.  He said he couldn&#39;t imagine, if we were on that show <br/>
and a rules-mom came and told him he HAD to clean his room or something.  He <br/>
would just say &quot;NO I don&#39;t!&quot; he said.   (And he funny thing is Marty had been <br/>
cleaning his room, deep-closet-sort level, when Holly rushed down and changed the <br/>
channel.)<br/>
<br/>
After that was over they talked about it some more, and I put Henry V back <br/>
on, and when it ended, I looked at all the DVDs that were in the den, and wanted <br/>
something I didn&#39;t really have to pay attention to, so I put in The Complete <br/>
Works of William Shakespear, which is comedy.   Both Holly and Marty were <br/>
still nearby and when they heard the distinctive intro music, they came and sat.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has seen The Tempest since he saw that last, and I noticed him being <br/>
especially alert when they did their (very few) Tempest references.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect them both to sit through the whole thing, but they both did.  <br/>
Marty has seen it before.  Holly had seen parts.  I didn&#39;t put it on for any <br/>
purpose but my side-entertainment, and it was cool that they stuck around.   <br/>
We had fun.<br/>
<br/>
It was &quot;after bedtme&quot; in rules houses.   It was also very comfortable and <br/>
sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Holly LOVES those shows that show people in their houses.  She&#39;s like a <br/>
sociologist (though I&#39;ve not said that word to her), or an anthropologist of <br/>
American life.  She likes the dating shows too, and loves to figure out which people <br/>
are dishonest, or posers, or to guess if the guy seems particularly shallow <br/>
or skewed, which girl he&#39;ll like.   It&#39;s like an aberrant psychology <br/>
observation lab for her.   She certainly doesn&#39;t want to grow up to BE them. &lt;g&gt;  And <br/>
she gets to see some embarrassing teen/young-20&#39;s behavior without having to go <br/>
to school to see it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I love hearing about what movies you have on for comfort.  I have done <br/>
the same thing for years, but didn&#39;t really know anyone else who did <br/>
too.  Plus, I get free movie recommendations.  ;)  When I have a big <br/>
project out I&#39;ll put on a long movie like Titanic or The Sound of <br/>
Music.  Shorter projects = shorter films.  I have a tradition of <br/>
watching Gone With The Wind while making Thanksgiving dinner.  It just <br/>
happened to be on TV one Thanksgiving about 10 years ago and since then <br/>
I watch it every time that holiday rolls around and I&#39;m preparing our <br/>
feast.  Warm fuzzies for me.  :)<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s like putting on an album, but it lasts longer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The longest music I have is Abba Gold, a VERY long Abba&#39;s greatest hits CD.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never used the term &quot;comfort movie&quot; before I don&#39;t think, but I do have <br/>
others.  <br/>
El Cid<br/>
Guarding Tess<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like the sentiments, the honor, and each has a few scenes I will stop to <br/>
watch raptly, and then go on about my business. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sound of Music is a good one for when kids are sick and I know they&#39;ll fall <br/>
asleep on the couch if they see something they already know really well, and <br/>
there won&#39;t be any screaming or monster roaring to wake them up with that one.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of musicals are good for just background, but for recharging my own soul <br/>
I like Henry V.<br/>

The BBC &quot;thing&quot; I&#39;ve been looking for forever is their Robin Hood <br/>
series. The one with Sean Connery&#39;s son as Robin. Very pagan, very <br/>
well written, well acted, well costumed, and I can&#39;t ever seem to <br/>
find it anywhere. I&#39;m sure it will come out on DVD one of these days. <br/>
It has run on PBS over here before, but it&#39;s been years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109195915">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m a sucker for old black and white movies where you get to know the <br/>
characters slowly and well through their conversations.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;<br/>
&quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart)<br/>
&quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot; (a young Paul Newman)<br/>
<br/>
lots of Hitchcock...&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My personal favorites as comfort movies are:<br/>
<br/>
Dark Victory (Bette Davis)<br/>
Now Voyager (ditto)<br/>
Bringing Up Baby (Hepburn/Grant)<br/>
Holiday (Hepburn/Grant)<br/>
Any Judy Garland<br/>
The old Astaire/Rogers pictures<br/>
The Thin Man series<br/>
My Man Godfrey <br/>
Forever Amber<br/>
A lot of the old John Wayne pictures.<br/>
<br/>
More recent good dialogue movies? Please how can you forget &quot;When Harry Met<br/>
Sally&quot;, &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and &quot;Bull Durham&quot;.<br/>
