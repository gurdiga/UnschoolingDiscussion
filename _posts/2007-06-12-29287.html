As I read something about her at Wikipedia, I had flashbacks to the<br/>
days of the British Empire and colonial types forcing &#39;civilisation&#39;<br/>
onto primitive dark skinned people. Maybe that&#39;s just me.<br/>
<br/>
But, since she lived 1842-1923 in any event, I&#39;d say her ideas about<br/>
how to educate children relate to a world that no longer exists.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt she had some positive attitudes toward children and their<br/>
development, but, personally, the rest of it makes me cringe to think<br/>
that this little red schoolhouse approach is apparently being touted<br/>
as a basis for a useful 21st century education.<br/>

Even John Holt, with his 20th century mindset, could never have <br/>
imagined where we would be today. His own ideas have been outdated with <br/>
the advent of the computer/internet and the multi-channel TV.<br/>

True.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, schools are still about the way they were when Holt  <br/>
was critiquing them.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling is far and beyond what he envisioned.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A friend sent me this link yesterday, to an article in which Ray  <br/>
Bradbury denounces the usual interpretation of his novel, &quot;Fahrenheit  <br/>
451&quot;; he says it was not about government censorship, but about how  <br/>
television watching would destroy reading.  The article points out  <br/>
that, in 1953, the year he wrote it, most people didn&#39;t have TV sets,  <br/>
and the ones that existed had 7&quot; black and white screens.  He  <br/>
envisioned the giant flat-panel screen -- like the one the interviewer  <br/>
says was in the room with them.<br/>
