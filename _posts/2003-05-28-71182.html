&gt; <br/>
&gt; I already know where my best creativity is manifest: in writing. I <br/>
&gt; love to write. I HAVE to write. and I want to write and make money <br/>
&gt; at it. I&#39;ve gone so far as checking out &quot;Wishcraft&quot; and some author <br/>
&gt; biographies and a WONDERFUL advice book by Carolyn See a fiction <br/>
&gt; author. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I get scared. I have this dream, and it&#39;s way up there, and <br/>
&gt; writing a thousand words per day is a daily goal in shooting for <br/>
&gt; that far away dream, and I read it and say &quot;bleh. who would want to <br/>
&gt; read this?&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s been said before&quot; and my dream fades.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so I limit my writing to letters and discussion groups online. :(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, I&#39;m being such a baby today. Sorry. Must be gonna get my Moon <br/>
&gt; Time. as Janis??? calls it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yahoogroups has this cool list called Book in a week. If you do a search <br/>
you&#39;ll find it. It&#39;s very cool, and it helped me get the first draft of my book <br/>
written. Check it out. If you have trouble finding it, e-mail me and I&#39;ll find a <br/>
link.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Read Bird By Bird by Anne Lamot (sp?)  One of her most important principles<br/>
&gt; of writing is that we need to write &quot;shitty first drafts&quot;.  Best to put<br/>
&gt; those first drafts away and don&#39;t look at them until you&#39;re ready to revise.<br/>
&gt; The distance really helps to look at your work with fresh eyes.  And &quot;shitty<br/>
&gt; first drafts&quot; can usually be worked into pretty decent second drafts, which<br/>
&gt; can usually be worked into something pretty good eventually.<br/>

especially Operating Instructions and Bird by Bird. However, I was astonished hearing <br/>
her speak. But it was inspiring. I figured, if someone this messed up (MUCH <br/>
more than me) can be a successful writer, &gt;I&lt; certainly can be!<br/>
