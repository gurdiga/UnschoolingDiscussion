<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>20 Dec 2002, at  2:51pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168609492">Ok,<br/>
<br/>
My son told me today that he feels like he is not learning anything at home.  He is 14.  This was after I asked him if he wanted to go back to school next year (something he said he wanted to do earlier this year).<br/>
<br/>
So, we had a discussion of sorts.<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out all the things he *has* learned, and *how* he learned them.   I explained that schools take 6 hours/day making a production of education because they have to do *something* for 6 hours or parents would be upset.  But learning doesn&#39;t have to be like schools make it.<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out that he could learn anything he wants at home, at any time he wants.  At school he will be limited to a particular subject that the school or teacher chooses.  I also made it clear that there is so much more out there to learn than what the schools teach.<br/>
<br/>
He did say he doesn&#39;t want to spend 6 hours/day there.  <br/>
<br/>
I also explained that even if he goes to school, and he has a teacher giving him all kinds of information, it is *still* his responsibility to learn whatever it is *he* thinks he needs to learn. <br/>
<br/>
I told him we could talk about what he was interested in and I could try to get whatever he needed, and I can continue exposing them to different ideas, but in the end, learning was *his* domain.<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out other advantages too, like being able to work more hours and have more money (there&#39;s a big one!!).<br/>
<br/>
I think he got it this time.  When we&#39;ve had discussions like this before, he always blamed me, like I didn&#39;t &quot;flip his head open and dump all the necessary info in there&quot; for him.<br/>
<br/>
Then he said something like, &quot;Well, I&#39;m a fast learner anyway&quot;. I&#39;m not sure what he meant by that in the context of our conversation, but it sure is a nice change from hearing &quot;I&#39;m dumb&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He still might go to school next year, and if he decides to go, thats fine with me.  I think I have finally come to peace with the idea that the kids have to make their own decisions.  When my daughter went back this year it was a struggle for me, but I&#39;m glad she went.  She has her *own* reasons for being home now.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the culture at school, but that culture is everywhere in some form or another. You can&#39;t control what they do when they leave your sight, and the older they get, the more often they can leave your sight and make their own choices.  <br/>
<br/>
You can only hope they&#39;ll talk to you and that they&#39;ll listen when you have something to say.<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652176759">No not yet.  We don&#39;t have it and to get it from the library is an ordeal.  I did check it out long ago, but that was before he would have been interested in it.  I&#39;ll have to check it out again I guess.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a few weeks to get hold of it.<br/>

<br/>
Its been really important for my teens to have some things to do outside the home, without younger siblings. I don&#39;t know - independence? Makes their life interesting and school look boring. Things like volunteer work, part time work, regular games days with friends, etc. And I have offered money to teens if they read certain homeschool/teen books - the choice is theirs but books like Real Lives : 11 teenagers who  don&#39;t go to School have a lot in them for teens and some of mine wouldn&#39;t read them on their own without an added incentive ( money!). Yet, reading these sorts of books gave them ideas.. and ammunition...Leonie W. <br/>
