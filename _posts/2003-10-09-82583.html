<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299125744">&lt;&lt;I knew someone who used to put like six little packs of salt on a<br/>
hamburger. Like a cow licking a salt block.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder why?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Can&#39;t speak for them, but I know if I forget to take my thyroid meds for<br/>
a few days running I start craving a salt lick - fantasizing about it -<br/>
wondering if the livestock would mind sharing... And the kids always<br/>
accuse me of not being able to eat salt unless it can be seen on my food<br/>
- this all started with the whole thyroid thing, too, though... Lol...<br/>
If it&#39;s worth anything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998689417">I&#39;m going to mention this to my mom.  We always have run ins about cooking, because she wants to add SO much salt to everything.  I&#39;m always pleading to undersalt at the stove and let those who like a lot of salt add it at the table.  Maybe it is her thyroid.<br/>

<br/>
I believe iodine is added to table salt to prevent goiter and related <br/>
thyroid problems.  So maybe what she is craving is iodine and maybe <br/>
there is an alternative way to get it without all the sodium?<br/>
<br/>
But I think tastebuds also lose sensitivity with age.  My mil likes some <br/>
really salty food.  (But she is hypothyroid.)<br/>
