<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816537607">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently joined and saw an old friend here just yesterday.  Hi Debbie!!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Amy, I live in the suburbs of Washington, D.C in Virginia.  You<br/>
can see my kids ages below.  I came into Unschooling about a year or maybe<br/>
more ago.  It&#39;s going great, though I worry about some things that we<br/>
haven&#39;t hit yet.  However, I guess it&#39;s because they&#39;re not always in the<br/>
forefront of my mind and we don&#39;t use them everyday, like Math and History.<br/>
:P  I keep saying he&#39;s still very young, don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a scientist (Zoology) by schooling and a technical editor (Cruise<br/>
Missiles) by training.  I work in the mornings in an office while my husband<br/>
stays at home.  We then switch off when I get home.  My husband is a partner<br/>
in a fairly new saltwater aquarium store and I&#39;m their bookkeeper too.  I&#39;m<br/>
fairly active in my church (teacher, singer, and help plan our retreat which<br/>
I am in the midst of).  Heck how would I have time for curriculum and all<br/>
the planning it takes?  We go through reams of books from the library and my<br/>
kids know oodles about animals and nature study.  Oh, and my son reads so<br/>
well it just amazes me.  I keep wondering, how can he do this?  I think he<br/>
just learns by reading everything I read aloud.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s enough for now.  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047863891">Hi Newbie,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on this list since last October. I would consider my experience here a mostly positive one, as I have learned many things about unschooling by &quot;wading&quot; through the various posts that come in. It is all worth it, for me. When someone states a thought or idea, I can either agree or disagree. I love how other&#39;s thoughts challenge my own, whether I choose to post or just lurk in silence. As you may or may not already know, unschooling is not easily defined. I very much appreciate having it discussed to death, the way that is has been at this group. Ultimately, it&#39;s your decision whether you find this sort of discussion helpful to your unschooling journey, or not.<br/>
In any case, Welcome!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446322682">Welcome to the board. I think that this list goes through periods of what you call &quot;bullshit&quot; and interspersed in the bullshit is lots of good shit as well. In the past two weeks I have seen a good bit of positive posts regarding what others unschooling days are looking like. If you are not finding what you are looking for, perhaps you can create a topic that does interest you. The other stuff passes. You make the choices regarding what you read and delete. How about telling us what unschooling looks like in your family or whether you are just getting started, etc.?<br/>

I have no idea of whether this list is worth your time or not. You&#39;ll have <br/>
to wade through it yourself and use your own bullshit meter as a guide. I&#39;m <br/>
not one to argue much and I&#39;ve seen conversations here I can live without. <br/>
I&#39;ve been deleting them or injecting my own brand of postive conversation <br/>
into the mix. You&#39;re free to do the same. :o) I&#39;ve also seen many people <br/>
getting great support and information here. There are unschooling topics and <br/>
ideas that are discussed here that don&#39;t even get touched upon in other <br/>
places. Whether you get something out of these conversations people will <br/>
probably be largely due to you and your input on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86613892">Hi!<br/>
My name is Deana and I want to transition from being a relaxed hsing family to more of an unschooling family.  We did ps for a couple of years, but have homeschooled ever since. Though as I said, we are a very relaxed homeschooling family.<br/>
 <br/>
I have read about unschooling, but I would like to hear from more experienced unschoolers on the issue of computers and TV.  My daughter is not attracted to either medium. Oh, she watches a show here and there on Animal Planet, and she has a computer program or two that she likes, but for the most part, life beckons her.  She likes to be off doing, playing, creating, interacting with people, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
My son, who has been in the same relaxed schooling atmosphere that she has, chooses computer.  He can spend literally hours and hours, which turn into days and days, at the computer.  This doesn&#39;t seem healthy to me on so many levels.  It is like the computer is addictive for him.  He is the same type of kid who would eat the whole shopping bag of candy.  He doesn&#39;t know when to stop.  My husband has a similar personality.  Drinks too much coffee and coke...has tried to quit smoking more times than I care to count.<br/>
 <br/>
My husband thinks computer time should be limited...but I wondered how experienced unschoolers deal with the whole issue.  I have tried to get my son to talk about the whole computer issue.  He says he knows he is on it too much, but he loves it.  He has tried to set the timer to limit his time, but he doesn&#39;t do this consistently.  Sometimes it seems that he needs his &quot;fix&quot; and purposely doesn&#39;t set the timer.  I don&#39;t want this to be a power struggle, but I also don&#39;t like seeing him sit glued to the computer screen.  Sometimes I will tell him to get off the computer and the next thing I notice is he is glued to a western on TV or Game Boy.  <br/>
 <br/>
I remember watching an old Star Trek episode once where everyone was glued to some video game. This was before the video game craze hit.  My son reminds me of that episode.<br/>
 <br/>
He does have other interests, like Scouts, and he attends regularly. It&#39;s not like he gives up Scouts for the computer.  But the minute he comes home that computer is back on.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41245667">Hi Deana<br/>
<br/>
you are describing our family, except your name is Deana and mine is <br/>
Heidi! My daughters are goers, and my son is a &quot;screen freak&quot; <br/>
(anything on any screen, he gets sucked in...) which I tend to have a <br/>
weakness in, my own self. <br/>
<br/>
When you describe your son and scouts, and beelining it to the <br/>
computer as soon as he gets home, you are describing our 10 year old. <br/>
As if he&#39;s had that computer on his mind the whole time he&#39;s been <br/>
doing something else... and when he is in front of a screen, he is <br/>
deaf and blind to everything else. Same with the bag of candy: in <br/>
fact, while visiting at my mom&#39;s house, he ate a whole bag of jelly <br/>
beans, and then freaked out (literally) at some spooky movie preview <br/>
on a video he watched...he was crying uncontrollably and couldn&#39;t <br/>
tell my mom what was wrong, huddling under a blanket and sobbing. She <br/>
had to call me, and the first thing I said was &quot;Has he had lots of <br/>
sugar?&quot;...but he hasn&#39;t overdone on the sugar since then, and I now <br/>
have a good rationale when he looks like heading in that direction: I <br/>
can just remind him of the bad reaction he had, and let him limit <br/>
himself! hmmmm...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been letting him have his freedom with electronics since <br/>
springtime, and his viewing/playing time hasn&#39;t dwindled much. Oh, <br/>
he&#39;ll get bored w/it now and then, and sit around saying &quot;There&#39;s <br/>
nothing to do.&quot; I am willing to consider this the next phase in his <br/>
deschooling process and continue watching him decompress from <br/>
the &quot;schooled at home&quot; he put up with for five years. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to give it more time. <br/>
<br/>
And read here frequently to keep myself reminded that we want to <br/>
educate &quot;naturally&quot; not do &quot;school at home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044682835">How old are your kids and what are some of the other things your son<br/>
enjoys?<br/>
<br/>
*** It is like the computer is addictive for him.*** <br/>
  <br/>
The transition to unschooling is easier for families if they can let go<br/>
of the schoolish idea that if a child isn&#39;t being and doing  exactly what<br/>
we think he should, there is something wrong with him.   Looking at a<br/>
child as if he is flawed won&#39;t help him become confident.   <br/>
<br/>
In our society when adults become highly specialized in their fields we<br/>
admire their dedication and singlemindedness.  We rely on specialists<br/>
when we need cabinets built, plumbing work, surgery, etc.  <br/>
Have you ever thought a brain surgeon might be addicted to brains?   A<br/>
plumber addicted to pipes? (yes, I thought about saying &quot;poop&quot;, but I<br/>
resisted.)  <br/>
There are some hotshot young&#39;uns out there designing computer software<br/>
these days and making a bazillion dollars.      <br/>
<br/>
***He is the same type of kid who would eat the whole shopping bag of<br/>
candy. He doesn&#39;t know when to stop***<br/>
<br/>
He does know when to stop, it&#39;s just that he&#39;s not stopping when *you*<br/>
believe he should.&lt;g&gt;    Stopping when one is finished or has had enough<br/>
is a good reason to stop.   Stopping because someone else says you&#39;re<br/>
finished is not a personally fulfilling experience.  It&#39;s frustrating.   <br/>
People need time to experiment, time to become absorbed and make<br/>
discoveries about themselves and what they need.  He&#39;ll come to his own<br/>
wise conclusions if given the opportunity.   <br/>
<br/>
Your son simply needs more time at the computer in order to absorb<br/>
everything he wants to. <br/>
<br/>
Learning about ourselves can be the hardest thing of all.  Lots of young<br/>
people come from homes where they lived under their parents limits and<br/>
when they are out on their own they go about discovering their own<br/>
personal limits.   I really believe it&#39;s safer and better for young kids<br/>
to make their discoveries at home, to gain a lot of experience making<br/>
decisions, so when they&#39;re out on their own, they can go about life<br/>
already knowing how to live it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***My husband has a similar personality.  Drinks too much coffee and<br/>
coke...has tried to quit smoking more times than I care to count.***<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible your husband simply requires, desires,  more coffee, or<br/>
coke than you, for whatever reason, and that you wish your own personal<br/>
limits were also his?   <br/>
<br/>
My husband requires more sleep than I do.  I feel best on four hours.  He<br/>
can go ten or twelve (when he doesn&#39;t have to get up for work).   I think<br/>
staying in bed that long is a huge waste of time.   I wouldn&#39;t want him<br/>
deciding I needed more sleep.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ***He says he knows he is on it too much, but he loves it.  He has tried<br/>
to set the timer to limit his time, but he doesn&#39;t do this consistently. <br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s probably saying what he thinks will soothe you a little. <br/>
The reason he doesn&#39;t set a timer is because a timer can&#39;t know when he&#39;s<br/>
finished!    A timer is an arbitrary thing.  <br/>
Would you want him to set a timer if he was mowing the lawn for you?  <br/>
Would you only want him to mow until the timer rang, or would it be more<br/>
satisfying if the lawn was finished?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***I don&#39;t want this to be a power struggle,***<br/>
<br/>
It can only be a power struggle when parents want the power to decide<br/>
when their children have had enough personal fulfillment. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I will tell him to get off the computer and the next thing I notice is<br/>
he is glued to a western on TV or Game Boy.***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to make a value judgement about television and Gameboy without<br/>
it becoming a value judgement about the kind of person who would enjoy<br/>
those things.   <br/>
And if he turns to them because the thing he was truly interested in has<br/>
been taken away nothing has been accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
Are there many things he does that don&#39;t seem worthwhile to you?<br/>
Maybe looking at all his good qualities and looking  more closely at the<br/>
one&#39;s you think aren&#39;t so good would help.   In your own mind maybe<br/>
&quot;addiction&quot;  can become involvement, engagement, dedication, persistence,<br/>
drive, ambition. <br/>
<br/>
Is there something you really love to do, something that engages you?  <br/>
Do you garden, or build race cars?<br/>
Can someone else decide for you when you&#39;ve had enough of those things?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
How would you feel about your husband if he looked at your choice to<br/>
garden as if it was a problem and you were somehow faulty for wanting to<br/>
do it?    It probably wouldn&#39;t help you feel better about your husband or<br/>
 about yourself    You wouldn&#39;t  benefit emotionally or intellectually if<br/>
you gave up gardening and did what your husband thought was more<br/>
worthwhile.   <br/>

Well Deb L said everything I could have said but much better. She&#39;s so handy<br/>
to have on here! &lt;BG&gt; I just wanted to let you know I agree also with all<br/>
she said. Just so you know there are same opinions out there. Seems like you<br/>
are the one that thinks he spends too much time on the computer. He probably<br/>
says he knows he&#39;s on too long because of how you feel. Seems like he is<br/>
eating and sleeping and playing and doing scouts, so he does know when to<br/>
stop. He&#39;s getting a lot from what he&#39;s doing on there. Things  you probably<br/>
don&#39;t see. I myself don&#39;t see everything fun or needed in what my kids do,<br/>
but I let them have at it. Must be some reason for them to want it so much.<br/>
Just stop and think if it were books your son had his head in as much. Would<br/>
that be a concern too? If not, why is the computer bad and the books<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be? I think your son sounds as if he&#39;s doing just fine. Try to not<br/>
say anything about it, you can still feel it now, but just don&#39;t say<br/>
anything!!! After awhile, you will have those feelings leave you too when<br/>
you see your son is still absolutely wonderful even though he&#39;s a computer<br/>
nut! It&#39;s a desire of his and he&#39;s focused on it, not addicted. That&#39;s a<br/>
really good thing.<br/>

&gt; My son, who has been in the same relaxed schooling atmosphere that she has, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It may be easier for you to see you daughter&#39;s activities and interests as <br/>
more valuable, or more worthwhile, than your son&#39;s.  But when you look at each <br/>
child individually, you&#39;ll see that they are spending time doing things that <br/>
engage and interest them, and doing it in ways that work best for them.  That&#39;s <br/>
what unschooling is all about.  Some kids bounce around from activity to <br/>
another constantly, and others immerse themselves in things until they&#39;ve exhausted <br/>
the possibilities for learning.   Some do both at different times.  It&#39;s all <br/>
good.  ;-) <br/>
<br/>
I know it is hard to accept this when it seems so extreme.  But maybe it will <br/>
help to think of it this way.  When my husband was a kid, after his Dad <br/>
upgraded his computer and gave him his old one, he spent *every waking moment* on <br/>
the computer.  (It&#39;s how I met him, in a roundabout way.)  To the exclusion of <br/>
his homework, hehehe, btw.  And it was mostly games, and bulletin boards, <br/>
nothing that *looks* very valuable.  <br/>
<br/>
  He now makes a good living as a network administrator, no college degree.  <br/>
He does what he loves AND what he is good at.   He can do whatever his boss <br/>
needs him to do with one hand tied behind his back, and he has job security <br/>
cause most of the yokems who take computer classes these days have no talent, <br/>
imagination or real skills, just knowledge, which is NOT the same thing.  He <br/>
replaced and fixed the mistakes of a yokem like that, hehehe.  <br/>
<br/>
His *unschooling* was much more valuble than his formal education (private <br/>
schools).  It&#39;s one of the reasons why we unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness his Mom didn&#39;t worry about how much time he spent on the <br/>
computer, right?!!  lol<br/>

I think this was what was really bothering me a few weeks ago when I was asking about my 14dd spending &#39;all&#39; of her time I-M ing her friends. I  knew then I wasn&#39;t really clear on what was bothering me, and didn&#39;t know how to express it. I was really worried that her behavior was &#39;addiction&#39; rather than an interest. I think I&#39;m relieved of that worry now, mostly. There is so much talk about addiction, nowadays. Does anyone have a really good definition? It may be helpful to those of us with &#39;focused&#39; kids. <br/>
Sandra&#39;s comment on riding the waves of your kids&#39; stages and moods was right on, and I loved hearing how she rode the bus standing up. We were never allowed to do that but on our curvy road it would have been really fun and challenging. It would have made PE superfluous! Why don&#39;t any grown ups think of these things? <br/>

    How old are your kids and what are some of the other things your son<br/>
    enjoys?<br/>
<br/>
    *** It is like the computer is addictive for him.*** <br/>
      <br/>
    The transition to unschooling is easier for families if they can let go<br/>
    of the schoolish idea that if a child isn&#39;t being and doing  exactly what<br/>
    we think he should, there is something wrong with him.   Looking at a<br/>
    child as if he is flawed won&#39;t help him become confident.   <br/>
<br/>
    In our society when adults become highly specialized in their fields we<br/>
    admire their dedication and singlemindedness.  We rely on specialists<br/>
    when we need cabinets built, plumbing work, surgery, etc.  <br/>
    Have you ever thought a brain surgeon might be addicted to brains?   A<br/>
    plumber addicted to pipes? (yes, I thought about saying &quot;poop&quot;, but I<br/>
    resisted.)  <br/>
    There are some hotshot young&#39;uns out there designing computer software<br/>
    these days and making a bazillion dollars.      <br/>
<br/>
    ***He is the same type of kid who would eat the whole shopping bag of<br/>
    candy. He doesn&#39;t know when to stop***<br/>
<br/>
    He does know when to stop, it&#39;s just that he&#39;s not stopping when *you*<br/>
    believe he should.&lt;g&gt;    Stopping when one is finished or has had enough<br/>
    is a good reason to stop.   Stopping because someone else says you&#39;re<br/>
    finished is not a personally fulfilling experience.  It&#39;s frustrating.   <br/>
    People need time to experiment, time to become absorbed and make<br/>
    discoveries about themselves and what they need.  He&#39;ll come to his own<br/>
    wise conclusions if given the opportunity.   <br/>
<br/>
    Your son simply needs more time at the computer in order to absorb<br/>
    everything he wants to. <br/>
<br/>
    Learning about ourselves can be the hardest thing of all.  Lots of young<br/>
    people come from homes where they lived under their parents limits and<br/>
    when they are out on their own they go about discovering their own<br/>
    personal limits.   I really believe it&#39;s safer and better for young kids<br/>
    to make their discoveries at home, to gain a lot of experience making<br/>
    decisions, so when they&#39;re out on their own, they can go about life<br/>
    already knowing how to live it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    ***My husband has a similar personality.  Drinks too much coffee and<br/>
    coke...has tried to quit smoking more times than I care to count.***<br/>
<br/>
    Is it possible your husband simply requires, desires,  more coffee, or<br/>
    coke than you, for whatever reason, and that you wish your own personal<br/>
    limits were also his?   <br/>
<br/>
    My husband requires more sleep than I do.  I feel best on four hours.  He<br/>
    can go ten or twelve (when he doesn&#39;t have to get up for work).   I think<br/>
    staying in bed that long is a huge waste of time.   I wouldn&#39;t want him<br/>
    deciding I needed more sleep.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    ***He says he knows he is on it too much, but he loves it.  He has tried<br/>
    to set the timer to limit his time, but he doesn&#39;t do this consistently. <br/>
    ***<br/>
<br/>
    I think he&#39;s probably saying what he thinks will soothe you a little. <br/>
    The reason he doesn&#39;t set a timer is because a timer can&#39;t know when he&#39;s<br/>
    finished!    A timer is an arbitrary thing.  <br/>
    Would you want him to set a timer if he was mowing the lawn for you?  <br/>
    Would you only want him to mow until the timer rang, or would it be more<br/>
    satisfying if the lawn was finished?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    ***I don&#39;t want this to be a power struggle,***<br/>
<br/>
    It can only be a power struggle when parents want the power to decide<br/>
    when their children have had enough personal fulfillment. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    ***I will tell him to get off the computer and the next thing I notice is<br/>
    he is glued to a western on TV or Game Boy.***<br/>
<br/>
    It&#39;s hard to make a value judgement about television and Gameboy without<br/>
    it becoming a value judgement about the kind of person who would enjoy<br/>
    those things.   <br/>
    And if he turns to them because the thing he was truly interested in has<br/>
    been taken away nothing has been accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
    Are there many things he does that don&#39;t seem worthwhile to you?<br/>
    Maybe looking at all his good qualities and looking  more closely at the<br/>
    one&#39;s you think aren&#39;t so good would help.   In your own mind maybe<br/>
    &quot;addiction&quot;  can become involvement, engagement, dedication, persistence,<br/>
    drive, ambition. <br/>
<br/>
    Is there something you really love to do, something that engages you?  <br/>
    Do you garden, or build race cars?<br/>
    Can someone else decide for you when you&#39;ve had enough of those things?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    How would you feel about your husband if he looked at your choice to<br/>
    garden as if it was a problem and you were somehow faulty for wanting to<br/>
    do it?    It probably wouldn&#39;t help you feel better about your husband or<br/>
    about yourself    You wouldn&#39;t  benefit emotionally or intellectually if<br/>
    you gave up gardening and did what your husband thought was more<br/>
    worthwhile.   <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Does anyone have a really good definition? It may be helpful to those of<br/>
us with &#39;focused&#39; kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I can&#39;t say I have a really good definition but I do know in my head<br/>
what would look like an addiction to me. Something that would be<br/>
overwhelming in getting in the way with life in general would be an<br/>
addiction. Something disruptive to the person themselves and the family. If<br/>
a child (or anyone) is eating and sleeping and still enjoying interaction<br/>
with love concerning family and friends, and still enjoying the other<br/>
interests they have had, or new ones, then I say that&#39;s focus and passion.<br/>
<br/>
My Joseph has a YuGiOh passion. He talks a lot about the cards, the game,<br/>
the show and what he finds on websites. I try really hard not to let my eyes<br/>
glaze over when he starts talking about it. &lt;BG&gt; But he still goes outside<br/>
to play and swim. He still wants to have our craft day out every Wed. with<br/>
friends. He still eats and sleeps and watches other things on TV. He wants<br/>
and enjoys our outtings with the family. He reads other books and does other<br/>
things on the computer besides YuGiOh. He&#39;s really looking forward to sports<br/>
camp starting again. The list goes on and on. Sometimes it seems like the<br/>
whole day was spent on watching, surfing and playing YuGiOh. But when I<br/>
really look at it, he certainly hasn&#39;t spent that entire day doing nothing<br/>
but that. To anyone else who isn&#39;t really looking, they would probably say<br/>
he&#39;s into it way too much. Luckily, people know better than to say<br/>
anything....... and I wouldn&#39;t really listen anyway!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80004579"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My daughters are goers, and my son is a &quot;screen freak&quot;<br/>
&gt; (anything on any screen, he gets sucked in...) which I tend to have a<br/>
&gt; weakness in, my own self.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You guys are describing ME! When I get started on my mail lists, I just stay on the computer &#39;til I&#39;m dragged away!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When you describe your son and scouts, and beelining it to the<br/>
&gt; computer as soon as he gets home, you are describing our 10 year old.<br/>
&gt; As if he&#39;s had that computer on his mind the whole time he&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; doing something else... and when he is in front of a screen, he is<br/>
&gt; deaf and blind to everything else.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same with me! When I get home from work (or from the conference) I beeline it for the computer. I really HAVE been thinking about it while I was gone, and I&#39;m glad to be back. AND I&#39;m hard to distract<br/>
when I&#39;m here, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Same with the bag of candy: in<br/>
&gt; fact, while visiting at my mom&#39;s house, he ate a whole bag of jelly<br/>
&gt; beans,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also love candy and sweets, and eat much more of them than most adults. NOW I can leave part of the bag alone (Yeah--I buy the 3.5-lb bag of M&M&#39;s!) but I haven&#39;t always. AND I&#39;m terrified of scary<br/>
movies, whether I&#39;ve been eating sweets or not (although usually I have been!). Movies that most people don&#39;t mind are TOO scary for me (like Harry Potter 2).<br/>
<br/>
BUT I&#39;m still a productive, responsible adult. I support my own family, pay my bills on time, and nobody has to *fix* me.<br/>
