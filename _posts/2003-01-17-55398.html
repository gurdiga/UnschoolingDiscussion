don&#39;t think it would be perceived as complaining. You ARE trying to get<br/>
information and feedback, not a different part, so you are on solid ground.<br/>

Does your daughter **want** you to talk to the director? Or does she<br/>
just need you to continue to commiserate and validate her (ie<br/>
daughter&#39;s) feelings?<br/>
