<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980948665">Sorry, I haven&#39;t been on here for a while, as we are traveling around <br/>
the country right now.  I don&#39;t have time to read all the past posts <br/>
right now but this thing on bedwetting caught my attention because <br/>
both my boys had the problem.  There is a hormone that we produce that <br/>
causes us to wake up when our bladders are full.  Some people don&#39;t <br/>
produce enough of this hormone to wake them up, especially young boys <br/>
have this problem.  My boys wore pull-ups until they were 10 and about <br/>
8.  We never made an issue out of it and if they were staying at <br/>
someones house or someone was spending the night at our house we made <br/>
sure that it was hidden so they wouldn&#39;t feel bad about it or get <br/>
teased.  When my oldest hit around 10 and my other one was around 8 <br/>
they just started waking up.  I&#39;ve heard of kids being MUCH older than <br/>
that, my husband was probably about 12 before he quit wetting and in <br/>
those days they didn&#39;t even have pull-ups.  His mom washed a lot of <br/>
sheets!!!  I think the key is not to make a big deal out of it, they <br/>
will outgrow it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609452113">Although I&#39;m not saying this is the reason for your (or anyone else&#39;s) <br/>
kids, I just thought I&#39;d put out our experience with it.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 8 years old.  He was in school for a year and a half and <br/>
has been home for almost a year now.  <br/>
<br/>
Right after he started Kindergarten (age 6), he went through spurts <br/>
with wetting the bed, having accidents maybe 3 or 4 or 5 times a <br/>
week.  Which had never really been an issue, it probably happened <br/>
occasionally before that, but certainly not on a regular basis like <br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
We tried to find food triggers, we tried to eliminate drinks after a <br/>
certain time, we tried waking him in the night, reminding him to go <br/>
many times before bed.  We washed alot of sheets, tried waterproof <br/>
pads, until we found GoodNites.  A doctor told me it was just how he <br/>
was growing, perhaps his bladder was a step behind his &quot;growth spurts&quot; <br/>
and I was also told it was hormonal.  That most kids will stop around <br/>
the time of puberty because their hormones will change then.  <br/>
<br/>
Amazingly (or not :) enough, he stopped altogether after he came <br/>
home.  It never even occured to me that school could be causing him to <br/>
wet the bed...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927602779">Both of our boys pretty much stayed dried all night as soon as they <br/>
were potty-trained.  BUT...our youngest went through a brief spell of <br/>
night time &quot;accidents.&quot;  We would be downstairs watching TV and hear <br/>
something like water running.  I&#39;d go upstairs to find him, sound <br/>
asleep, peeing on the steps, or his bunk bed post. :)  He obviously <br/>
*thought* he was in the bathroom...or behind a tree...or something. lol<br/>
<br/>
He was never awake during these episodes and didn&#39;t remember them the <br/>
next day. It felt almost like having a puppy to train. :D  Whenever we <br/>
heard him start to move about, we&#39;d go to him and gently direct him to <br/>
the toilet and then back to bed.  Luckily, this didn&#39;t last long and <br/>
he learned how to direct himself to the bathroom while mostly asleep.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145866476">I am a quiet list member but this thread really caught my eye.  My 10 yo <br/>
daughter still wets the bed and it bothers her very badly.  She is too <br/>
big for the traditional kid goodnights so we have gone to the adult <br/>
Depends.  My older daughter wet until she was 10 and then only had <br/>
occassional accidents until she was 11 yo.  My yougest (10 yo) also wears <br/>
the smaller depends pads during the day because sometimes she can&#39;t make <br/>
it to the bathroom.  I haven&#39;t really worried about it becuase my now 13 <br/>
yo was put through several invasive tests (that I wish now I had never <br/>
done, but thought there might be something really wrong because she would <br/>
leak during the day too)and ended up having her urethera tube stretched <br/>
which helped for about 6 or 7 months.  I decided at that point after <br/>
talking with my MIL not to do that again either.  My SIL had hers <br/>
stretched 9 times as a child.  She eventually grew out of it.  So I <br/>
decided to buy pads and let her grow out of it.  The thing that concerns <br/>
me with Madison (my 10 yo) is that it bothers her so badly.  We have <br/>
talked about it and I have told her not to worry.  She has even asked her <br/>
daddy and me to wake her during the night to go pee.  We do that a fair <br/>
amount.  But after reading some of the posts I am wondering if that is <br/>
something we should continue.  I wet the bed until I ws 9yo.  I just hope <br/>
Madison&#39;s will resolve itself in the near future for her emotional sake.  <br/>
<br/>
Reading your posts just lets me know we are not alone....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270865971">I wet the bed until I was 13, and to stop, I had to learn to sleep differently.  Kinda half awake.  My son, when he finally stopped wetting the bed, said the exact same thing--that he had learned to sleep differently.  He was actually pretty tired the first week after he figured this out, but I think just getting to bed a little earlier helped with that.  When George told me he was tired of wetting the bed (pull-up things were uncomfortable, waking up wet and having to change clothes and move to another bed was no fun), I offered suggestions and he liked the idea of an enuresis alarm.   When we got it, he wore it one or two nights, and had it figured out.  I so wish they had had these things when I was a kid!  I remember my mother telling me there were alarms when I was a little girl, but they were pads you slept on and they had an electrical cord attached.  My mother explained that she wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep worrying about me getting electricuted!    The little Malen alarm I bought for my son was safe and little and he was physically and mentally ready for it.    The medicine (vasopressin or DDAVP) can be given by pill or nasal spray, but I was nervous about it.  But not as nervous as my mom was about those electrically charged pads &lt;g&gt;, and we would have done that if that&#39;s what my son had wanted to try.  <br/>
    I want my kids to think I will search out solutions to their problems when they ask for my assistance, but that I can also leave it alone if things are good enough for them.    <br/>
