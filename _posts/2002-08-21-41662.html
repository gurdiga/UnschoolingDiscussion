&lt;&lt;        Let us live vicariously through your experiences. Enlighten us, <br/>
share <br/>
with us. How was the conference you attended/presented at? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I tell too many stories it will seem unbelievably puffed up.<br/>
<br/>
I had fun.  I met people whose words I had read for years but whose faces and <br/>
voices and smiles were new to me.  I got to hang around with people I know <br/>
and REALLY like but who are only physically in my life at homeschooling <br/>
conferences!<br/>
<br/>
There were four speaking-times for me, and three were shared with others.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday there was an unschooling panel which ended up being Mary Griffith, <br/>
Jan Hunt, Pam Sorooshian, myself, and Evan Wright, a young man who came late <br/>
to unschooling but REALLY got it and had his life changed.  He was profoundly <br/>
moving.  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning at 8:00 (yes, church-early and pretty extreme) was my only <br/>
alone-presentation.  I had about 60 people, I think.  I haven&#39;t listened to <br/>
the tape yet so I haven&#39;t even reviewed for myself how I think it went.  It <br/>
was smooth, but I think a couple of times I started to make a point and <br/>
didn&#39;t quite dwell on it long enough to finish clearly.  I hope it all made <br/>
an hour&#39;s worth of sense though.<br/>
<br/>
9:15 Dan Vilter, Kathy Ward and I went together to do a presentation on video <br/>
games.  I&#39;m going to lift what I wrote to the HSC list about that rather than <br/>
try to re-phrase.<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
I was forwarded a very nice set of comments on the video gaming workshop that <br/>
Dan Vilter, Kathy Ward and I collaborated on (thanks, Nicole, for writing <br/>
that, and thanks Betsy for sending it to me!) and I have some things to say.<br/>
<br/>
Dan was awesome, both in terms of the information he had (which wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
sounded the same coming from me or Kathy, honestly) AND his technical pizazz <br/>
(which was really on the low end of his pizazz capability, I&#39;m sure).  <br/>
Kathy&#39;s testimony was more powerful than mine because she went from limiting <br/>
video games to revelling in them.  <br/>
<br/>
One especially sweet aspect which we hadn&#39;t planned in advance was this:<br/>
<br/>
We had three &quot;demo&quot; offspring each play a game.  My Holly, Dan&#39;s Matthew, and <br/>
Kathy&#39;s Jonathan.   With those three, they were in three different age <br/>
ranges, and not all boys.  That was exceptionally well balanced, considering <br/>
it was put together piecemeal.<br/>
<br/>
We were in a small room, and it packed up, with people sitting on the floor, <br/>
leaning on the walls and the back table, and watching from the sidewalk <br/>
outside.<br/>
<br/>
I propose to anyone concerned with next year&#39;s conference that<br/>
1) it was important<br/>
2) it was popular and desired information<br/>
3) we need a WAY bigger room<br/>
<br/>
I think Dan Vilter should do this again in the ballroom/banquet room where he <br/>
can project the game screen even bigger and better, and where as many people <br/>
as want to can get in there and watch normal unschooled gaming kids play <br/>
difficult games with ease, and describe the strategies they&#39;re using.   If <br/>
Dan wants help and I&#39;m invited out again, I&#39;d love to be just a helper this <br/>
time.  I bet Kathy would do it again too.   The energy in the room was great. <br/>
 I felt that we really changed some minds and some families&#39; lives.  Those <br/>
already of a mind to accept video games as valuable had their vague ideas <br/>
solidified.<br/>
<br/>
We could have done a full day of presentation with no repetition.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still excited about that workshop.  <br/>

---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll put Nicole&#39;s notes, and then come back to the rest of that day:<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did anyone go to the talk about <br/>
&gt; videogames?  have any details to share? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I went to this panel and thought it was one of the best subjects i<br/>
could <br/>
have picked that weekend on my sons behalf (after all its all about<br/>
them) I <br/>
only wished I had taken him to it (He just turned 12) I was so thrilled<br/>
about <br/>
the talk i didn&#39;t want to leave, I felt like i was doing the best thing<br/>
for <br/>
my son even though he wasn&#39;t there, I could now understand his side of<br/>
the <br/>
importance of video games and computer games and how they DO STIMULATE<br/>
YOUR <br/>
MIND, it just sorta reaffirmed what I had already hope could be. <br/>
<br/>
I think it would be great if every parent could hear it next year,<br/>
because <br/>
almost all of us do have a child who likes to play a computer game or<br/>
video <br/>
game and have it be held in one of the bigger rooms too! Oh I also<br/>
bought the <br/>
tape on it so my husband (who was watching my three children) could<br/>
listen to <br/>
it, so if you cant get it I can make a copy for you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great question and thank you Kathy, Sandra, and Dan for<br/>
such a <br/>
cool topic and to all Conference volunteers and workers for making it <br/>
possible :-)<br/>

I attended your 8:00a.m. presentation, and I thought<br/>
it was great.  The one thing you said that just hit me<br/>
between the eye was VALIDATE my children.  My 13 year<br/>
old daughter and I have been going round and round for<br/>
about 1 year on stupid stuff and I couldn&#39;t figure it<br/>
out, the minute you said it I knew what the problem<br/>
was.  I was not validating the fact she is growing up.<br/>
 I also was at the presentation you did with Richard<br/>
P. which was equally awesome.  You guys came from<br/>
different points of view which was good.<br/>

&gt; &gt; them) I <br/>
&gt; &gt; only wished I had taken him to it (He just turned<br/>
&gt; &gt; 12) I was so thrilled<br/>
&gt; &gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt; the talk i didn&#39;t want to leave, I felt like i was<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing the best thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; my son even though he wasn&#39;t there, I could now<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand his side of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; importance of video games and computer games and<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; they DO STIMULATE<br/>
&gt; &gt; YOUR <br/>
&gt; &gt; MIND, it just sorta reaffirmed what I had already<br/>
&gt; &gt; hope could be. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think it would be great if every parent could<br/>
&gt; hear<br/>
&gt; &gt; it next year,<br/>
&gt; &gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt; almost all of us do have a child who likes to play<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; computer game or<br/>
&gt; &gt; video <br/>
&gt; &gt; game and have it be held in one of the bigger<br/>
&gt; rooms<br/>
&gt; &gt; too! Oh I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; bought the <br/>
&gt; &gt; tape on it so my husband (who was watching my<br/>
&gt; three<br/>
&gt; &gt; children) could<br/>
&gt; &gt; listen to <br/>
&gt; &gt; it, so if you cant get it I can make a copy for<br/>
&gt; you.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I also was at the presentation you did with Richard<br/>
P. which was equally awesome.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THANKS!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I attended your 8:00a.m. presentation, and I thought<br/>
it was great.  The one thing you said that just hit me<br/>
between the eye was VALIDATE my children.  My 13 year<br/>
old daughter and I have been going round and round for<br/>
about 1 year on stupid stuff and I couldn&#39;t figure it<br/>
out, the minute you said it I knew what the problem<br/>
was.  I was not validating the fact she is growing up.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People are weird about kids growing up.  I said to one of the other speakers <br/>
in a mostly-private conversation that there just comes a time when a teenaged <br/>
boy doesn&#39;t want to hang out with his mother, and she looked surprised.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t think that was news to anyone!! <br/>
<br/>
thanks for the kind words.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;        Let us live vicariously through your experiences. Enlighten us, <br/>
  share <br/>
  with us. How was the conference you attended/presented at? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If I tell too many stories it will seem unbelievably puffed up.<br/>
<br/>
  I had fun.  I met people whose words I had read for years but whose faces and <br/>
  voices and smiles were new to me.  I got to hang around with people I know <br/>
  and REALLY like but who are only physically in my life at homeschooling <br/>
  conferences!<br/>
<br/>
  There were four speaking-times for me, and three were shared with others.<br/>
<br/>
  Saturday there was an unschooling panel which ended up being Mary Griffith, <br/>
  Jan Hunt, Pam Sorooshian, myself, and Evan Wright, a young man who came late <br/>
  to unschooling but REALLY got it and had his life changed.  He was profoundly <br/>
  moving.  <br/>
<br/>
  Sunday morning at 8:00 (yes, church-early and pretty extreme) was my only <br/>
  alone-presentation.  I had about 60 people, I think.  I haven&#39;t listened to <br/>
  the tape yet so I haven&#39;t even reviewed for myself how I think it went.  It <br/>
  was smooth, but I think a couple of times I started to make a point and <br/>
  didn&#39;t quite dwell on it long enough to finish clearly.  I hope it all made <br/>
  an hour&#39;s worth of sense though.<br/>
<br/>
  9:15 Dan Vilter, Kathy Ward and I went together to do a presentation on video <br/>
  games.  I&#39;m going to lift what I wrote to the HSC list about that rather than <br/>
  try to re-phrase.<br/>
<br/>
  ------------<br/>
<br/>
  I was forwarded a very nice set of comments on the video gaming workshop that <br/>
  Dan Vilter, Kathy Ward and I collaborated on (thanks, Nicole, for writing <br/>
  that, and thanks Betsy for sending it to me!) and I have some things to say.<br/>
<br/>
  Dan was awesome, both in terms of the information he had (which wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
  sounded the same coming from me or Kathy, honestly) AND his technical pizazz <br/>
  (which was really on the low end of his pizazz capability, I&#39;m sure).  <br/>
  Kathy&#39;s testimony was more powerful than mine because she went from limiting <br/>
  video games to revelling in them.  <br/>
<br/>
  One especially sweet aspect which we hadn&#39;t planned in advance was this:<br/>
<br/>
  We had three &quot;demo&quot; offspring each play a game.  My Holly, Dan&#39;s Matthew, and <br/>
  Kathy&#39;s Jonathan.   With those three, they were in three different age <br/>
  ranges, and not all boys.  That was exceptionally well balanced, considering <br/>
  it was put together piecemeal.<br/>
<br/>
  We were in a small room, and it packed up, with people sitting on the floor, <br/>
  leaning on the walls and the back table, and watching from the sidewalk <br/>
  outside.<br/>
<br/>
  I propose to anyone concerned with next year&#39;s conference that<br/>
  1) it was important<br/>
  2) it was popular and desired information<br/>
  3) we need a WAY bigger room<br/>
<br/>
  I think Dan Vilter should do this again in the ballroom/banquet room where he <br/>
  can project the game screen even bigger and better, and where as many people <br/>
  as want to can get in there and watch normal unschooled gaming kids play <br/>
  difficult games with ease, and describe the strategies they&#39;re using.   If <br/>
  Dan wants help and I&#39;m invited out again, I&#39;d love to be just a helper this <br/>
  time.  I bet Kathy would do it again too.   The energy in the room was great. <br/>
  I felt that we really changed some minds and some families&#39; lives.  Those <br/>
  already of a mind to accept video games as valuable had their vague ideas <br/>
  solidified.<br/>
<br/>
  We could have done a full day of presentation with no repetition.  <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m still excited about that workshop.  <br/>
<br/>

  ---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
  So I&#39;ll put Nicole&#39;s notes, and then come back to the rest of that day:<br/>
<br/>
  ----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Did anyone go to the talk about <br/>
  &gt; videogames?  have any details to share? <br/>
<br/>
  Yes, I went to this panel and thought it was one of the best subjects i<br/>
  could <br/>
  have picked that weekend on my sons behalf (after all its all about<br/>
  them) I <br/>
  only wished I had taken him to it (He just turned 12) I was so thrilled<br/>
  about <br/>
  the talk i didn&#39;t want to leave, I felt like i was doing the best thing<br/>
  for <br/>
  my son even though he wasn&#39;t there, I could now understand his side of<br/>
  the <br/>
  importance of video games and computer games and how they DO STIMULATE<br/>
  YOUR <br/>
  MIND, it just sorta reaffirmed what I had already hope could be. <br/>
<br/>
  I think it would be great if every parent could hear it next year,<br/>
  because <br/>
  almost all of us do have a child who likes to play a computer game or<br/>
  video <br/>
  game and have it be held in one of the bigger rooms too! Oh I also<br/>
  bought the <br/>
  tape on it so my husband (who was watching my three children) could<br/>
  listen to <br/>
  it, so if you cant get it I can make a copy for you.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for the great question and thank you Kathy, Sandra, and Dan for<br/>
  such a <br/>
  cool topic and to all Conference volunteers and workers for making it <br/>
  possible :-)<br/>

<br/>
Sandra, I&#39;ve never been to the big BC conference, but if they ever ask you <br/>
to speak, I&#39;ll find my way across the pond to go.  There used to be <br/>
wonderful conferences in Vancouver, put on by Wondertree.  They had all <br/>
kinds of great activities and workshops for all ages.  Unfortunately the <br/>
people doing the bulk of the work burned out.  Getting across the pond is <br/>
expensive enough that a similar conference her on The Island would probably <br/>
not fly.<br/>

purchased tapes from the BC conference.  It might be that they would <br/>
purchase some selected tapes from other conferences.  So I&#39;d also be <br/>
interested in the ordering info.<br/>
