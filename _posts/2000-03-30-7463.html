<div id="ygrps-yiv-952649616">&lt;&lt; What are the boomerang tapes? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an audio magazine for kids that my kids really love to listen to.  We <br/>
get the tapes from the library, but you can subscribe.  It&#39;s targeted toward <br/>
middle grade kids, and it&#39;s also targeted to &quot;schooled&quot; kids, but there&#39;s <br/>
lots of good info. on the tapes.  The website is Boomkids.com<br/>
