<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570968982">I think for me it&#39;s a personality trait. :o) I&#39;ve come to believe<br/>
there&#39;s lots and lots of gray in the world and very seldom is there a<br/>
&quot;right&quot; answer. For me, I need use my gut *and* my head to decide what<br/>
action to take and then I&#39;m still willing to keep looking at it and<br/>
change my mind if necessary...<br/>

&gt; I think it is good learn other people&#39;s views about things, which is<br/>
&gt; why I like lurking on this group.  I just think people don&#39;t need to<br/>
&gt; question themselves so much. </span></blockquote></div>
