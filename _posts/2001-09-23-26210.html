<br/>
When you say Fred Feet - do you mean no arch and wide?  That is a pretty<br/>
accurate descitption of my younger daughter&#39;s feet.  I have arches but<br/>
started getting bunions when I was 20.  They are really odd shaped now. <br/>
The ball of my foot (just behind the toes) is nearly twice as wide as the<br/>
heal!  Anyway, I found a pair of shoes that is wonderful.  From the<br/>
minute I put them on, they felt great!  The brand is Merrell and they are<br/>
called &#39;ladies moccasin&#39; But they are not a moc in the traditional sense.<br/>
One other suggestion, if your feet are like Jenni&#39;s, don&#39;t be shy about<br/>
trying on men&#39;s shoes.  They usually fit her feet better than the women&#39;s<br/>
shoes do.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget - whose daughters bought matching MEN&#39;S hiking boots last week. <br/>
It is way more scary that they bought matching shoes than that they<br/>
bought them in the men&#39;s department!  They never do anything alike, ever!<br/>
 The world is spinning in reverse now or something!<br/>
