 </span></blockquote>Why not google around and find some places, both now and in the past, where<br/>
the vast majority of the population were not literate?<br/>
<br/>
Or just consider:<br/>
<br/>
Banking -- checking, credit cards and all the small print terms/percentages of<br/>
interest<br/>
Homes -- rental agreements and mortgage terms or comparison shopping when<br/>
buying a house<br/>
Transportation -- driver&#39;s responsibility, accidents, buying, insuring,<br/>
leasing cost of<br/>
Food / water / medical and health care<br/>
Working - conditions and terms, rights and responsibilites<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention civic issues like Jury Duty or court and common understanding<br/>
of basic rules of conduct among humans.<br/>
<br/>
At a minimum people without access to education will be at a disadvantage in<br/>
all of these areas, looking at how those people could cause a negative ripple<br/>
effect in the lives of those who are educated? I think we are already living<br/>
in that reality.<br/>
<br/>
We already live in a world where a great many people are not competent to<br/>
succeed literately. With legitimate channels closed to them they seek wealth,<br/>
respect, power in avenues that come at the cost of the literate and<br/>
successful. <br/>
<br/>
We need MORE of these people around? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
I homeschool because I want the very best for my children and I don&#39;t think<br/>
they would get it in school, but, I don&#39;t think everyone could do this or<br/>
should do this, and I don&#39;t mind paying school taxes. I do object to paying<br/>
taxes for school systems that shuffle poorer kids around and convince them<br/>
they cannot learn. There is something wrong with the system, all children are<br/>
capable of learning, but paying for public education isn&#39;t the problem.<br/>

grow up without the stigma and learn to read on their own. <br/>

Their &quot;school&quot; did only go thru the 8th grade, but they continued learning via apprenticeship in their chosen field after that. The Menonites also had the option of furthering their education via correspondence courses for both high school and college. They could all read, write, and did math every bit as well as I. Those who chose to become farriers, learned by working with the current farrier(s), those who chose to become lay midwives did so by doing it right along with the current lay midwives. They had a much better education in their chosen field by age 18 than most college graduates have. Plus every one of them learns to farm properly (including the rotation and conservation of land), to build houses and barns and roads and bridges, to tend children, to cook and clean, to identify and use dozens (if not hundreds) of plants and herbs, to take care of livestock, and basic first aid. That&#39;s far above what the majority of college graduates, or even people in general learn in their entire lifetime. All of that doesn&#39;t even mention that they also learn the Bible word for word, and are the most compassionate and loving people I&#39;ve ever had the fortune to meet. <br/>

government regulation.  The fact that some people take welfare checks<br/>

I&#39;m as passionate as anyone about the benefits of homeschooling but I don&#39;t<br/>
see how everyone can do it.  What about families where both parents must work<br/>
long hours? What about single parent families? I know some single parents who<br/>
make monumental efforts to work jobs that allow them the time to homeschool<br/>
their children, but surely expecting all of them to do that is unfair and<br/>
unrealistic? <br/>
<br/>
And while I agree that the schools are not teaching in the way that is best<br/>
for children to learn, I see the problem as a community and a culture who<br/>
profits from the ignorance of others, rather than an opportunity to throw the<br/>
baby out with the bath water and get rid of public schooling altogether. <br/>

Well I like this idea a lot but just don&#39;t see it ever happening. I also <br/>
like the idea of schools like the Sudbury ones. I know most are private but <br/>
there is one that is public. Not sure how they managed to do that but if we <br/>
have to have schools, I think that is the best way to go. (of course just in <br/>
case someone is familiar with one that is a disaster, let me just say I&#39;m <br/>

Whoops! Looks like that&#39;s already happening.<br/>

From Scientific American, December 2001, page 28.<br/>

&quot;The US has gone through a historically unparalleled expansion in its<br/>
prison population - from fewer than 400,000 in 1970 to almost 2.1<br/>
million in 2000. The expansion continued vigorously even as crime rates<br/>
fell sharply in recent years.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; long hours?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I doubt that both parents MUST work long hours.  I know people who <br/>
live on incredibly low amounts of money.  They live very modestly--no <br/>
tv, no newspaper and magazine subscriptions, shop at discount grocery <br/>
stores and never go out to eat.  They&#39;re happy.  One family I&#39;m <br/>
thinking of has 6 kids and one more on the way, and the dad is a <br/>
janitor and bus driver.  The other family is a 3 child family where <br/>
the dad is an oil delivery man.  These families are truly an <br/>
inspiration to me.  If they can do it on their incomes, there&#39;s no <br/>
reason for both parents to work long hours.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 What about single parent families?<br/>
<br/>
I believe in community (non-government mandated community!)and I <br/>
believe that the homeschooling families should be there for each <br/>
other more than they are now.  We should help those families who are <br/>
single parent families and want their children home. <br/>
<br/>
 I know some single parents who<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their children, but surely expecting all of them to do that is <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unrealistic? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is it unfair to say that people should choose to raise their <br/>
children in the best possible way?  And raising children in the best <br/>
possible way doesn&#39;t include putting them in institutions. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And while I agree that the schools are not teaching in the way that <br/>

that it doesn&#39;t do a good enough job educating kids, but the fact <br/>
that it is an institution. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093943840">Well I don&#39;t agree with the line of thinking that all parents should <br/>
homeschool. I know many who should absolutely NOT homeschool. I think many <br/>
children would do worse home with mom or dad all day then being in school. <br/>
There are some children who thrive in school and turn themselves out quite <br/>
well in spite of it. I would say most of us here fall into that category. <br/>
&lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe though that everyone could if they wanted to. I do believe that <br/>
families who say they both must work, really and truly don&#39;t HAVE to. It&#39;s <br/>
all a matter of priorities. Give up the two cars or big house and downsize. <br/>
Stay home and give up movies every week or getting your nails done. It&#39;s a <br/>
matter of what&#39;s important to you. I never ever thought, looking back to 8 <br/>
years ago, that my husband and I could raise 4 kids without me working let <br/>
alone in the house we live in. It was important to us, we gave up some stuff <br/>
and my husband made it happen. We forgo the vacations and weekly nights out <br/>
for the two of us. Our house is big and full of stuff to activate our <br/>
children into going wherever they want to go. We stay home a lot with the <br/>
pool and swingset and sandbox and yard but it was important for us to have <br/>
these things. More important than Disney every year. Although if we could <br/>
afford it, we would be there too!!!<br/>
<br/>
I also know many single mom&#39;s who homeschool. They make it happen because <br/>
it&#39;s important to them.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t feel it&#39;s right to say what I think is best for my children, <br/>
homeschooling, is best for someone else&#39;s children. That would leave me open <br/>
to having someone making me vaccinate because they feel it&#39;s the best for <br/>
their kids. I don&#39;t want anyone telling me what&#39;s best for mine and telling <br/>
others that same thing is a very slippery slope.<br/>

things for them to learn better ways of doing.<br/>
My oldest goes to school. I don&#39;t see taking her out is a good choice for <br/>

knowing times tables by fourth grade, knowing how to read by the end <br/>
of first grade, knowing what a noun and verb are, etc. And of course <br/>
if these poor homeschooled children can&#39;t get a certain score on a <br/>
standardized test they should be forced to attend public school.  <br/>

&gt; thinking of has 6 kids and one more on the way, and the dad is a<br/>
&gt; janitor and bus driver.  The other family is a 3 child family where<br/>
&gt; the dad is an oil delivery man.  These families are truly an<br/>
&gt; inspiration to me.  If they can do it on their incomes, there&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; reason for both parents to work long hours.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With all due respect Sheila, I don&#39;t think your experience reflects the<br/>
reality of many, many poor people. I understand where you&#39;re coming from, in<br/>
my own life we take many of the same measures that your family does to allow<br/>
me to stay at home and for us to live on one income. But, many people, even if<br/>
they did take those measures and saved their money, would still not have<br/>
enough income or the option of letting one of the parents stay home with the<br/>
children. And sometimes, it is the hours worked, or the type of work, or the<br/>
insurance options that limit two parent families options. I could go on and<br/>
on. I have five siblings. Four of them were laid off in the last year with<br/>
this recession. What about high costs for living and food is going through the<br/>
roof? Millions of people don&#39;t have the money or access to basic health<br/>
insurance. When one of their kids gets sick enough for emergency treatment,<br/>
those that pay their bills end up paying through the nose to make up for a<br/>
lack of coverage. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;  What about single parent families?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe in community (non-government mandated community!)and I<br/>
&gt; believe that the homeschooling families should be there for each<br/>
&gt; other more than they are now.  We should help those families who are<br/>
&gt; single parent families and want their children home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Millions of them? Homeschoolers are a small percentage of the whole, the small<br/>
percentage of homeschoolers are going to make it possible for millions of<br/>
single parent families to turn to homeschooling? The math just doesn&#39;t work<br/>
out. <br/>
<br/>
So too bad for single parents?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;  I know some single parents who<br/>
&gt; &gt; make monumental efforts to work jobs that allow them the time to<br/>
&gt; homeschool<br/>
&gt; &gt; their children, but surely expecting all of them to do that is<br/>
&gt; unfair and<br/>
&gt; &gt; unrealistic?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why is it unfair to say that people should choose to raise their<br/>
&gt; children in the best possible way?  And raising children in the best<br/>
&gt; possible way doesn&#39;t include putting them in institutions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find it interesting that you use the word institution the way that you do. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The biggest problem with the institution of public education isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; that it doesn&#39;t do a good enough job educating kids, but the fact<br/>
&gt; that it is an institution.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, you lost me here. Maybe you can clarify?<br/>

wondered about... Most Amish send their children to school through the 8th <br/>
grade right? Do they send them to a local public school, or is it a church <br/>
based school in their community? How do the attendance laws affect them? <br/>
(leaving school in the 8th grade) Do they homeschool?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That wasn&#39;t the question. The question was whether they were<br/>
&quot;well-educated&quot;. To me, that implies a high degree of literacy, an<br/>
understanding of higher mathematics, a familiarity with at least some of<br/>
the classics, and some degree of general understanding of the history of<br/>
the world and the science behind it. I grew up in Ohio, my extended<br/>
family is mostly still there, and this wasn&#39;t my experience of the Amish.<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any well-known Amish authors, or scientists.<br/>
<br/>
Which is all fine - I don&#39;t think people should have to learn these<br/>
things, and clearly many people live happy, productive lives without<br/>
knowing them. I just wouldn&#39;t call them well-educated.<br/>

<br/>
Because  many people are ignorant, hateful, mean, messed up, alcoholic, drug <br/>
abusing, sexually perverted assholes and their kids are better off in school <br/>
for part of the time where they meet some decent humans, make some friends <br/>
whose parents are not all or some of the above.<br/>
<br/>
Some moms are crushed by emotional trauma and can hardly get up to go to the <br/>
bathroom, let alone provide their children a happy place where they want to <br/>
be all day.<br/>
<br/>
Some moms are dead, their husbands are working really hard in dirty jobs that <br/>
last from 5:00 til dark, and they&#39;re afraid to leave little girls alone.<br/>
<br/>
There are LOTS of reasons school could be good for a child.  School is better <br/>
than lots and lots of things.<br/>
<br/>
What unschoolers do will eventually change the schools.  The fact that <br/>
homeschooling exsts has already caused many states to provide online charter <br/>
schools, so that kids can be home and the schools still get their cut.  THAT <br/>
is a huge step forward.  I know homeschoolers complain about it, and I just <br/>
this morning pointed out (by phone) to someone that a charter school online <br/>
was still public school in essence.<br/>
<br/>
But homeschooling is not better than anything in the world.  School can be a <br/>
haven and a place of light.  It&#39;s all relative.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The only thing school does for the kids we&#39;re <br/>
talking about is keep them away from bad parenting for part of most <br/>
weekdays.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a big thing.<br/>
It gives them access to books, to nicer people, to adults who have been to <br/>
college, and maybe who have travelled.  They get to hear live music, maybe.  <br/>
Some people grow to adulthood never hearing live music.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389708109">They usually have a small schoolhouse built, and one of the ladies is the teacher. Sometimes they use their church for a schoolhouse, but not usually. They do not have to follow the state&#39;s laws regarding anything, including school. Some of them homeschool, but it&#39;s usually an older girl in the family that does the teaching in that case, and they usually only homeschool if there are medical reasons to do so. <br/>
