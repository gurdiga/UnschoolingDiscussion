<div id="ygrps-yiv-177162568">Hi,<br/>
 I&#39;m not Aimee but I am in Texas. I am in Brenham. Half way between Houston & Austin. I had difficulty finding unschoolers also. I registered with this group & found some within 20 miles of me. They show some unschoolers in San Antonio. <br/>

  Hey Aimee,<br/>
<br/>
  I had about given up hope of finding another unschooler in TX.  I really do<br/>
  love it, wouldn&#39;t live anywhere else (tried it and was so homesick) but you<br/>
  do have to develop a thick skin and a strong sense of self.<br/>
<br/>
  We live just north of San Antonio in the southern Hill Country.  We have<br/>
  family in Amarillo and are up there quite often.  Where are you?<br/>
