<div id="ygrps-yiv-894948624">Hi!<br/>
I have something I would like to discuss. I have one child who wants to do textbooks. He says it is a way to get information in a fast and concise way.  So, if he wants to learn about marine biology his first tendency is to read a textbook on marine biology. I have tried to get him to think outside the box more but he told me that textbooks and fantasy novels (his  passion) are his learning preferences. He also told me that he just enjoys listening to lectures on tape and reading textbooks. He has no interest in public school though.<br/>
 <br/>
He wants to go into the military, which wouldn&#39;t be my choice for him since I am a babyboomer.  But I told him that it was his life so he gets to choose.  He spends a lot of time learning about math and science but he also studies other things he thinks he will need for the SAT. He is driven to get a high score.<br/>
 <br/>
I could care less about tests and all that.  My daughter is more like me. I don&#39;t tell him what books to use or when to study. He just does it.  Is this still unschooling??? I am embarrassed to admit he loves traditional stuff around unschooling friends.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s truth in this assessment. Some kids have minds that <br/>
work that way. They want the facts and the overview. Is he <br/>
learning about marine bilogy out of interest or because he thinks <br/>
he should? Is he fulfilling requirements for the Air Force <br/>
Academy or some other military institution? If so, perhaps that&#39;s <br/>
why he wants to use textbooks. To fulfill the requirements with as <br/>
little hassle as possible.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If these are his preferences, then I don&#39;t understand trying to get <br/>
him to think &quot;outside the box.&quot; Usually the revolt against <br/>
textbooks is founded on the typical experience of text book <br/>
learning: boredom and poor retention. If your son prefers them, <br/>
he is probably gleaning lots of information that matters to him. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t see that as a problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He also told me that he just enjoys listening to lectures on tape <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and reading textbooks. He has no interest in public school <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
I love lectures as part of my education. In fact, I&#39;ve spent the last <br/>
three years independently studying theology. I attended lectures <br/>
at the local university on topics that I enjoyed and now this fall <br/>
have decided to become a grad student. I loved my first <br/>
class--lectures, assigned reading. It was time for more directed <br/>
learning. I value all the modes of education for myself so why not <br/>
for my kids who express their preferences?<br/>
<br/>
I have a son similar to yours and we are using a text book for <br/>
math (his choice) and a reader for history (again, his choice).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>

life so he gets to choose.  He spends a lot of time learning about <br/>
math and science but he also studies other things he thinks he <br/>
will need for the SAT. He is driven to get a high score.<br/>
<br/>
He sounds like a very self-motivated kid. And his desire to have <br/>
things orderly, to get high marks and to fulfull clear goals fits the <br/>
military perfectly.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>

<br/>
Traditional materials don&#39;t make one automatically a <br/>
non-unschooler. Unschooling is more about learning to respond <br/>
to your particular child so that his learning adventure isn&#39;t <br/>
imposed by someone outside himself but comes from a <br/>
thorough self-knowledge. To take away textbooks would be to <br/>
violate the spirit of unschooling (making some form of education <br/>
taboo based on a preconceived idea of its value). Every part of <br/>
life holds educational value for someone.<br/>
<br/>
As far as being embarassed: I think I&#39;d want to underscore the <br/>
philosophy of unschooling rather than the typical practices that <br/>
are usually taken to mean unschooling. Your son is a <br/>
self-directed learner who knows how to get his educational <br/>
needs met without interference. Sounds like unschooling to me.<br/>
<br/>
At least, that&#39;s my take on it.<br/>

<br/>
I would agree that it&#39;s the philosophy in general, not the materials<br/>
being freely used by the learner. However, part of the reason textbooks<br/>
are often perceived as lesser quality educational materials, is how<br/>
often they are wrong, inaccurate, out-of-date, or laced with insidious<br/>
political biases. There was an article in Popular Science on this topic<br/>
about 6 months ago (???). It included a picture of a world map with the<br/>
equator going through Florida. Anyway I googled &quot;Mistakes in Textbooks&quot;<br/>
and got 79,300 hits. Here&#39;s one bio-sciences site:<br/>

<br/>
My question is what do you mean by &quot;using&quot; a text book &quot;for history&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t tell him what books to use or when to study. He <br/>
<br/>
just does it.  Is this still unschooling??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s the word &quot;use&quot; which is causing the problems.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Use&quot; has a goal, usually.   One uses something for a purpose, a goal.<br/>
<br/>
One cannot learn all the history he needs from any one book.  So a single <br/>
&quot;text book&quot; is more often &quot;used&quot; to serve as the basis for one course of study (a <br/>
class, with tests and reports and eventually an overall test).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have one child who <br/>
<br/>
wants to do textbooks. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To &quot;do textbooks&quot;?<br/>
DO them meaning answer all the questions at the end of each chapter?  <br/>
DO them &quot;in order,&quot; like not allow himself to skip a chapter?  <br/>
   (Even in school teachers will skip chapters or not finish a book.)<br/>
<br/>
How about these phrases to make things less schoolish and confusing:<br/>
<br/>
refer to text books<br/>
read text books<br/>
have text books<br/>
compare text books<br/>
<br/>
&quot;DOing&quot; them and &quot;USING&quot; them seem a little locked-down to me.<br/>

Have any of you read &#39;The Language Police&#39;?  I can&#39;t remember the author&#39;s <br/>
name - Ravitch or something similar to that.  (It&#39;s downstairs and I&#39;m up and <br/>
it&#39;s humid so all the metal in my ankle is making me cranky.)  It&#39;s a topic for <br/>
our next homeschooling group and I have to say it&#39;s scaring the crap out of <br/>
me.  I&#39;m not too far into it but the information about the bias committees for <br/>
tests and textbooks is really unbelievable.  Can&#39;t read too much of it at a <br/>
time, it&#39;s disturbing. <br/>
<br/>
My kids will never use a textbook unless they ask.  And then I might have <br/>
them understand how they are brought together in the publishing world first!<br/>
