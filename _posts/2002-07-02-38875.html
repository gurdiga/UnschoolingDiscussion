 </span></blockquote>I think there are movements all over the country for things like this. When <br/>
Jack went to school last year, they didn&#39;t call any snow days, and we had a <br/>
few that needed to be called. In the district we live in the kids walk to <br/>
school if they live 2 miles or less from the school. Many of these kids had <br/>
to walk through this. I was so pissed when I took Jack to school and saw all <br/>
these kids walking. I was ticked already because I had to go out in the <br/>
weather... (I guess I didn&#39;t HAVE to, but...) I made a statement to the <br/>
principal and she informed me that these kids have no where else to go. The <br/>
district had set specific standards on snow depth, wind chill factor and <br/>
temperature in dealing with snow days. She told me that many of the children <br/>
would get their only hot meal of the day at school and if there was no <br/>
school, there would be no food. She also informed me that many children would <br/>
be left alone if there was no school, and how would I feel about a 5 year old <br/>
being left alone all day? I informed her I was all for the hot meals and the <br/>
oh so wonderful baby-sitting service the district provided to the poor in our <br/>
community, but what good would it all do if the kids were frozen to death! (I <br/>
don&#39;t think she liked me much &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
Any way, movements to lower the mandatory attendance age, removing snow days, <br/>
lengthening the school day are all part of the governments fingers grasping <br/>
at our children.<br/>
Then there are all the things done in the name of Brown here in my town that <br/>
really flabbergasts me!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not the government.  It&#39;s teachers&#39; unions (NEA primarily) pushing for <br/>
more members, more jobs, more power.  The early childhood education programs <br/>
have been cranking out quickie degrees for several years, and their graduates <br/>
are told compulsory childhood ed is coming, it&#39;s just a matter of time.  And <br/>
lots of them open private preschools, and parents pay big bucks, and those <br/>
who can&#39;t pay feel behind, and those who can pay might rather not pay, and so <br/>
they will appeal to the government to help them.<br/>
