Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean giving your children freedom carte blanche to to<br/>
whatever,  whenever.   It&#39;s not about them having complete power in all<br/>
decisions...that would be overwhelming for a child.<br/>
    I think that those more likely to &quot;stay out late,  partying and<br/>
experimenting with sex,  drugs, rock-n-roll ;-)  are those who are<br/>
disassociated  in their relationships with their parents.  Those who may be<br/>
rebeling against the &#39;controls&#39; placed on them;   those whose parents are<br/>
too busy to truly relate anc ommunicate with them.<br/>
 Unschooling provides such a greater opportunity for healthy parent-child<br/>
relationships....not nearly as much interference from schools,  peers, etc.<br/>

I think it was Margaret Mead (?) who told of a culture where very young<br/>
children were allowed to go near a fire and learn for themselves what &quot;hot&quot;<br/>
meant.  Did I read that, maybe, in _The Continuum Concept_?  Interesting<br/>
story if I could remember it!<br/>
<br/>
But one difference I see is that &quot;hot&quot; has direct consequences and &quot;TV&quot; has<br/>
more indirect ones.  Still, I think you could effect the same result if you<br/>
gave your son ALL the facts and let him choose.....maybe not because I don&#39;t<br/>
know your son, but this has always worked well for my children to-date.  For<br/>
us, the OUTCOME was similar....the process for setting the rules was just<br/>
different.  And the kids&#39; reaction to it when THEY set the rules vs. when<br/>
*I* set the rules is profoundly more positive.  I&#39;m not suggesting &quot;no<br/>
rules&quot;....I&#39;m suggesting allowing your son at least *some* informed choice<br/>
in making the rules.<br/>
<br/>
When you let your children make choices (and mistakes) and give them the<br/>
responsibility for making choices and following them, then they really do<br/>
learn, above all, to TRUST you when you *do* have to set limits.  I&#39;d much<br/>
rather my children make mistakes when they&#39;re young than when the stakes are<br/>
higher and my level of control is diminished.<br/>
<br/>
You and I might disagree about the &quot;danger&quot; of TV, though when my kids were<br/>
five I, too, had more conservative views about it.  (I read Winn&#39;s books and<br/>
others like it.)  For you, it really *may* be as dangerous as fire or drugs<br/>
or a busy street.  For me it is not.  I said before that choices carry with<br/>
it responsibility.  If *you* make the rules then *you* carry the<br/>
responsibility for seeing they are followed.  If your son makes the rules<br/>
then *he* carries the responsibility.  Different aged children are capable<br/>
of handling different levels of responsibility.  Only you know what those<br/>
limits are for your children.  However, the more responsibility he is<br/>
allowed, the better he will be at handling it when the life-or-death choices<br/>
really *do* come up....and the more he&#39;ll believe you when you haven&#39;t had<br/>
the need to set limits *for* him in the past.<br/>

instances, when other parents use to freak out bc I let my son, then 2 or<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not necesarily. At certain times when I have let my son watch more TV than<br/>
usual, I have noticed direct changes in him. Primarily, I find that he&#39;s<br/>
less able to amuse himself and expects me to entertain him when the TV<br/>
goes off. He gets cranky. We&#39;ve pointed this out to him, and he sees that<br/>
feeling this way is neither fun nor to his benefit.<br/>
<br/>

We do. He&#39;s allowed to watch TV one day a week, for as long as he wants,<br/>
and he&#39;s allowed to watch whatever he wants, Pokemon, Batman, Dr. Seuss<br/>
videos. etc. Once we rented the Matrix, which is rated R.  He gets his<br/>
fill on these &quot;TV days&quot;, and it doesn&#39;t even come up as an issue the<br/>
remaining six days a week, so it works for us. Glad your method works for<br/>
you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess the problem is how you define excessive.  I limit my son but <br/>
not my daughters.  The reason is because it does a different thing to <br/>
him.  The girls (14 an 16) have gone on TV watching binges and I let <br/>
it run it&#39;s course.  Eventually, they look up and do something else.  <br/>
Wyndham is different.  He has other problems that don&#39;t allow him to <br/>
get past it.  He NEEDS to be told to shut it off sometimes.  I would <br/>
never dream of telling him WHAT to watch, but I am quite confident in <br/>
my decision to tell him how much to watch.<br/>
<br/>
But again, the problem here is recognizing the difference. I know <br/>
kids that need help learning fiction from reality, I know kids who <br/>
need help learning about consummerism and the effects of advertizing, <br/>
both of these things can and should be handled without limiting TV.  <br/>
But if your child is so glue to the tube that he forgets to eat or go <br/>
potty on a regular basis and is becoming more and more unhappy and <br/>
unhealthy, maybe you need to do something.<br/>
