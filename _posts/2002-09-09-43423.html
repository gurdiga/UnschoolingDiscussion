&lt;&lt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get my 3 and 4 year olds on an <br/>
 airplane?  I&#39;m not sure why they are afraid except that they think it will <br/>
be <br/>
 really loud.  My son, in particular, is very sensitive to loud noises - he <br/>
 even begs people in public bathrooms not to use the hand dryer.  We&#39;ve <br/>
talked <br/>
 about the noise level on the plane, etc.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Visiting the airport a few times is a great idea.<br/>
In addition...I would buy some &quot;rescue remedy&quot; to give them both before and <br/>
during the flight (it is very calming). But some earplugs so they have the <br/>
option to block any noise that bothers them. Show them how they work and play <br/>
with them ahead of time maybe.<br/>
Read books about people flying, maybe rent movies that are lighthearted and <br/>
funny where people are flying.<br/>
Bring good snacks and toys to keep their attention on something happy during <br/>
the flight......<br/>
I think that should help.  Good luck!<br/>

but you could talk some about flying and those little planes look<br/>
friendly.  I haven&#39;t looked at that particular show in a long time, maybe<br/>
I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in your car could you rev up the noise slightly, just like<br/>
&quot;Zoom, zoom now we&#39;re taking off&quot; ?  Could you pretend you&#39;re flying to<br/>
the grocery store?  <br/>
<br/>
We once made our dining room table into an airplane and flew to Japan. <br/>
The situation was different because it involved my son wanting to climb<br/>
onto and then jump off of everything.  We jumped out the airplane when we<br/>
reached our destination.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe just lots of play about flying around and add a little noise<br/>
yourself and encourage them to add some zooms and roars.  Should be fun<br/>
at your house for a while!  <br/>
<br/>
We had a cool little swing that looked like an airplane, don&#39;t know if<br/>
they still make those.  <br/>

maybe I&#39;ll tape it.  They aren&#39;t napping today, by the way, because the <br/>
street is being torn up.  Bulldozers and dump trucks right outside our <br/>
bedroom window!  What joy!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Thanks!  I&#39;ve <br/>
 never given my two chewing gum before, is it safe for a 3 and 4 year old?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That depends on what you mean by safe. If you think it&#39;s not safe to swallow <br/>
it, then no.<br/>
But I&#39;ve swallowed a LOT of gum in my life (no, I don&#39;t do it anymore) and <br/>
I&#39;m still here and as healthy as can be.<br/>
I&#39;ve given a small piece of gum to my 19 month old, wouldn&#39;t do it regularly, <br/>
but I can&#39;t see any harm in giving it to a 3 and 4 y.o.<br/>
I&#39;m baffled as to how you&#39;ve kept it from them so far!! :)  My kids love gum.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a LOT of allergies and chemical sensitivities. Along with asthma. <br/>
Peanuts, highly processed corn products (like corn starch and sugar), DEET, <br/>
sunscreens, most bath soaps and diaper creams, laundry detergents, not to <br/>
mention regular old cleaning supplies.  I haven&#39;t read a package of gum <br/>
lately, but it&#39;s sure to read like a chemical reaction.<br/>
<br/>
I chew gum, as does my husband.  The kids aren&#39;t interested.  We also drink <br/>
the occasional diet coke, but again they are not interested.  I figure, why <br/>
mess with a good thing?  I might try a piece of gum before <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-932938960">If you decide to get some gum for them to try and the regular gums look like <br/>
it may trigger allergies, check with your local health food store.<br/>
There is a gum based on an African (I think it&#39;s from Africa) tree called <br/>
Peelu.<br/>
Peelu gum....good for your teeth, it actually cleans them, and fun to chew.<br/>
Probably all natural ingredients.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594668090">The small private airport is a great suggestion.  Most of the people who<br/>
work at those are nuts about aviation and are always looking to make a<br/>
dollar.<br/>
<br/>
I would think that if you called out there, explained the situation and<br/>
offered to pay $15 or $20, you could probably get a private tour inside a<br/>
small plane and possibly even a brief ride.<br/>
<br/>
My 9yo is very sensitive to noise (can&#39;t stand fireworks or anything like<br/>
that) but when he was about 3 he got to fly with his Papa in a small plane<br/>
and loved it.<br/>

energy in this neck of the woods..<br/>
so if this has been answered just delete me..<br/>
Yes- there are cool ear plugs. One of my kids gave me some for using the<br/>
lawn mower, etc. And my Dad is a Police Officer and has them for<br/>
&#39;qualifying with his weapon&#39;.<br/>
Mine are bright orange and connected to each other on a cord/line- all<br/>
very soft, pliable plastic.<br/>
I&#39;ll try to remember to ask Lucas, my son, where he gets them.<br/>
