<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273565808">Is anyone going to the Scottsdale&#39;s annual Mighty Mud Mania on Friday?  If <br/>
you want some info. on it I compiled & saved it.  I didn&#39;t want to send it <br/>
unsolicited in case it would upset anyone.  I also have compiled some info. <br/>
on the Arizona Science Center if you want me to send it to you let me know. <br/>
