<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820538052">**Knowingly doing something that you are aware feels insulting to certain <br/>
people IS insulting those people.<br/>
Sometimes it is worth it, to make a point or for shock value to wake <br/>
them up or for other reasons, I&#39;m sure. But, to just casually, for no <br/>
good reason, use language that you know is unsettling to someone else <br/>
is discourteous and uncaring. Doing anything that makes another person <br/>
uncomfortable or feel insulted should be done only for a good reason. <br/>
So what if it is &quot;their problem?&quot; If we have the ability, simply by <br/>
avoiding the use of certain words when they might be unappreciated, to <br/>
create more harmonious social situations and avoid offense, why not do <br/>
it?**<br/>
<br/>
This is great Pam!   I&#39;m keeping this one,  thanks!<br/>
