One Mom actually said (no joke) that she let her 9 or 10 yr. old child play <br/>
video games for one day and he pooped and peed himself and sat in it all day <br/>
then she dragged him out of the room kicking and screaming.. I am still <br/>
beside <br/>
my self on that one. How is this possible one and two how could anyone be <br/>
comfortable writing it as an anti-video game defense? <br/>
<br/>
There are maybe 2 or 3 of us on this list of 200 that Unschool what does one <br/>
say to this as a minority on a list? <br/>

If in fact what this mom wrote is true, and she wrote this as a response or a <br/>
statement of fact that unschooling does not work then the logic is flawed. <br/>
She starts right of saying that she *Let the child play for one day* that isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling, that is her &quot;allowing&quot; a child to play something that is usually <br/>
heavily restricted. The child was so enthralled at the so called freedom he <br/>
didn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t drag himself away for even a moment. I find it hard to believe a <br/>
child of nine or ten would defecate on himself just to keep that freedom for <br/>
one moment longer, but if it is true then it speaks volumes about the mom <br/>
herself. The fact that she then dragged her child away screaming shows that the <br/>
child was very aware that the one day of freedom was a ploy on the mothers part <br/>
and not truly a day of freedom. If she was really trying unschooling then she <br/>
would have had to give it more than just a day. And she probably spent most of <br/>
the day making comments about when he was going to get off, and how nice a <br/>
day it was to spend outside, and wouldn&#39;t he like to read some in his book... <br/>
<br/>
What I really think is mean is having a game system and then locking it up. <br/>
That is like having something always and being allowed to look and see and know <br/>
it is there but never ever touch it. My toys were like that when I was a <br/>
child. I had many but I wasn&#39;t allowed to play with them because I would mess them <br/>
up or I would make a mess, so when I was allowed to play with my toys I did <br/>
make a mess. I was so excited to be able to play with them I didn&#39;t know which <br/>
one to play with first and would drag them all out. That, of course, proved my <br/>
mothers theory that I would make a mess if allowed the freedom to just play <br/>
unrestricted. So unless my mother had the time to sit and control the <br/>
situation, I was resigned to looking and wanting. When my sister came onto the scene <br/>
when I was seven and then when I was nine and my brother came along, they <br/>
started getting all these cool toys and they were allowed to play with them and that <br/>
wasn&#39;t fair. To add insult to injury I didn&#39;t get toys anymore, I got books <br/>
and clothes. And not that books and clothes are bad, but when you spend all of <br/>
your first years being smothered with no and don&#39;t and can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t and <br/>
better not and wait till your father gets home and then two small creatures <br/>
come along and get everything you ever wanted, well it just hurts and it drives <br/>
home the word crap. So if this boy has this hundred dollar game system with <br/>
forty dollar a pop games and isn&#39;t ever allowed to play unless the situation is <br/>
controlled then I can see why he did what he did. And every time he sees a <br/>
game he wants and has to &quot;earn&quot; it and then has to &quot;earn&quot; time to play it then I <br/>
understand that drive to never leave one spot for that justified fear of <br/>
reprisal on the mom&#39;s part. He knew he would be punished for spending the whole <br/>
day on the games, but it was almost worth it or else why would he have done what <br/>
he did? The child did what he did because it was expected that he would do <br/>
that. Probably every day he asks to play and every day he is told &quot;If I let you <br/>
play you will never get off, you will rot your brain playing that junk.&quot; The <br/>
game is like candy. Only allowed on certain special occasions and if he &quot;earns&quot; <br/>
the time. <br/>
<br/>
Not unschooling. Not even close. No wonder it didn&#39;t work.<br/>

<br/>
So he KNOWS his mom was wrong and that the game was wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
She will not have a son to communicate with for too much longer, if she&#39;s <br/>
even trying to communicate with him (instead of at him) now.  She won&#39;t have his <br/>
trust or his love much longer, if she has any left now.<br/>

restrictions *and* I have a six-year-old who does occasionally have bathroom <br/>
accidents, often when he&#39;s watching TV or playing video/computer games.  He is <br/>
a *very* focused kid, but reading your post helped me realize that now that <br/>
there are no restrictions (even though he&#39;s still in school for now by his <br/>
choice), he&#39;s having fewer accidents.  Interesting.  So thanks! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as the school thing -- he had thought he wanted to finish first grade, <br/>
but now he wants to stop at the semester break in January.  It&#39;s interesting <br/>
to watch him work all this out in his own brain.  He&#39;s very much looking <br/>
forward to unschooling, but he&#39;s also determined to stick to his own plan.  One <br/>
morning when he was tired and didn&#39;t want to go, I asked him if he wanted me to <br/>
call the principal and give his notice (I have agreed to do so because the <br/>
principal needs time to fill the space, I think because charter schools need full <br/>
enrollment for their funding).  He said no, he wanted to stick to the plan.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure I understand his reasons exactly, but I really admire him for <br/>
taking his own approach to all this.<br/>

Also, perhaps there were other kids who would have jumped on the machine<br/>
if he left it. Nor do we have an accurate idea of what that mother&#39;s<br/>
concept of &quot;all day&quot; was. People who are &quot;watching the pot&quot; often don&#39;t<br/>
have a clear idea of how long something has gone on. Poor kid.<br/>

Last night I read the paper (Western Australia) and their was an article<br/>
about a man who had whipped his teenage son with a 1.5 metre piece of hose<br/>
for 40 minutes!!!!! The boy had been getting into trouble at school and was<br/>
bringing shame to his family. The judge told him that &quot;he was well-motivated<br/>
in trying to discipline your son but you&#39;ve gone a bit too far.&quot;  Can you<br/>
imagine if this same man was assaulted in this manner by a stranger and the<br/>
stranger was told he&#39;d gone a bit too far? Ugh, it&#39;s too sickening.<br/>
