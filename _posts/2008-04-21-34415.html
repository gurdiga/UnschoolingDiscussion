<div id="ygrps-yiv-692147817">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
I have learned SO much from this list in the past year or so that I&#39;ve<br/>
been reading it....I&#39;ve appreciated being able to do so quietly, in<br/>
the background... :)<br/>
<br/>
Today, dh&#39;s parents came to supper. In general, they are not<br/>
supportive of our learning-without-school-lifestyle (they are retired<br/>
teachers). However, they have respected our wish to stay off of the<br/>
topic of our educational choices.<br/>
<br/>
Dd15 is very creative; one way she expresses herself is to experiment<br/>
with hair styles and hair colour. She wants to be a hair stylist, and<br/>
for several years has done a fantastic job of cutting her own as well<br/>
as my hair. <br/>
<br/>
In the past year, she has had red highlights, then teal/blue<br/>
highlights and most recently has gone back to all black hair.<br/>
<br/>
Today was the first time that dd&#39;s Grandma has seen dd since dd went<br/>
back to her natural hair colour. For some reason, Grandma thought it<br/>
was okay to comment by saying:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I like your hair this colour better than the green colour.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dd was very gracious and simply said thank you. I was so shocked all I<br/>
could think to say was, &quot;It was teal.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
A little later, Grandma asked if dd was still playing the piano. When<br/>
dd answered no, Grandma responded with &quot;tsk, tsk.&quot; At the time I was<br/>
in another room but still within earshot...<br/>
<br/>
When dh&#39;s parents had gone home, I talked with dd saying that she was<br/>
very gracious in her responses to Grandma. And I let her know that I<br/>
did not agree with what her Grandma had said to her.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering what are some things that I could have said at the time<br/>
that the condescending comments were made. My mother in law is not at<br/>
all receptive to anything that suggests that she has made a mistake,<br/>
or that her comments could have been different...so I&#39;m thinking that<br/>
any comment of mine beyond perhaps saying &quot;I LIKE teal&quot; might have<br/>
been counterproductive anyway.<br/>
<br/>
And now I realize I could have mentioned that dd is concentrating on<br/>
singing rather than piano at the moment...<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas to help me think this through are welcome and appreciated!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like your daughter is accepting of her and her comments as  <br/>
&quot;just the way she is&quot; and they have no more power over her than an  <br/>
anonymous passerby on the street.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re giving your MIL power by wanting to counteract her comments.  <br/>
You&#39;re saying &quot;You&#39;re too powerful. I need to cut your down or change  <br/>
you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so I&#39;m thinking that<br/>
&gt; any comment of mine beyond perhaps saying &quot;I LIKE teal&quot; might have<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And how effective have *her* comments been on getting you to see  her  <br/>
way? She&#39;s doing what you want to do to her. Do you think you can be  <br/>
more effective? Is there *anything* she could say, any way she could  <br/>
say it that would get you to see how wrong you are to let your  <br/>
daughter to change her hair color or stop taking piano lessons?<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that when we know we&#39;re right, it&#39;s hard to understand  <br/>
how someone can&#39;t see it too. ;-) And it feels like if we could just  <br/>
find the right comment, then the light bulb would light for them. She  <br/>
has *decades* of experience that have helped her to see her way is  <br/>
right. You can&#39;t make change. She can only change if she sees an  <br/>
advantage in a new way of thinking and wants to change.<br/>
<br/>
If she were being hurtful, you could tell her that unless she behaves  <br/>
better she can&#39;t come back, but I think you could take a few notes  <br/>
from your daughter&#39;s behavior. If you feel like you&#39;re not defending  <br/>
your daughter or giving tacit approval to your MIL&#39;s comments by  <br/>
keeping silent, you could talk about it later and ask about how your  <br/>
daughter feels when  her grandmother says things like that.<br/>
<br/>
If I were your daughter, I&#39;d want you to let the comments go. I could  <br/>
shrug off the grandmother&#39;s comments, but if you jumped in wanting to  <br/>
turn it into a struggle for power over the right way to think, it  <br/>
would up the tension in the air and make it uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And now I realize I could have mentioned that dd is concentrating on<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could have as part of a conversation, as you would with a friend.  <br/>
But if the purpose is to get her to see that your daughter is better  <br/>
than her grandmother&#39;s comments imply, it will be an exercise in  <br/>
frustration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801739385">FWIW, I agree with Joyce that your frustrations were better left<br/>
unsaid...that it wouldn&#39;t get you anywhere to have expressed them. I think<br/>
your daughter&#39;s thank you was beautiful and wise: She focused on the<br/>
positive (however superficial) part of Grandma&#39;s comment and chose to ignore<br/>
the underlying negative. Making any statement on how you liked the teal<br/>
would have been focusing on the negative part of her comment, in my opinion,<br/>
and that again, would serve no one. Following your daughter&#39;s lead in the<br/>
way she handled this particular scenario seems like the best policy to me!<br/>
Isn&#39;t it wonderful when it works that way?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if Grandma had said something more overtly negative or<br/>
hurtful, and particularly if DD seemed to be taken aback by it, that&#39;s when<br/>
I would step in in her defense. For instance if she still had the teal<br/>
highlights and Grandma had said &quot;I liked your other color more than this<br/>
green&quot; I might step in with a smile and said &quot;*I* like the TEAL, but more to<br/>
the point, (insert DD&#39;s name) does or she wouldn&#39;t have chosen it!&quot; or<br/>
something like that. I find that stating the obvious in a cheerful way<br/>
sometimes has a way of reminding people of what should have been obvious to<br/>
them in the first place, but wasn&#39;t, for some reason! Then again, DD might<br/>
also be thinking that Grandma is entitled to her own opinion, even if it&#39;s<br/>
one different from her own? And I cannot think of a healthier attitude than<br/>
that!<br/>

<br/>
But I might have been tempted to respond to<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...Grandma asked if dd was still playing the piano. When<br/>
dd answered no, Grandma responded with &quot;tsk, tsk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
with<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hey mom, are you still playing that violin (or knitting quilts, or<br/>
fill-in-the-blank)?&quot; and give a wink.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be antagonistic...keeping it light is usually a good way<br/>
to go. And she might feel for a moment what the question and judgment<br/>
brings, and that could be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
My mom moved in with us 2 1/2 years ago. She has her own space, but we see<br/>
her a whole lot, and I walk the balancing act of letting my kids &quot;handle&quot;<br/>
her as they see fit, and sharing my own little responses when it seems<br/>
helpful. The goal is harmony though, and I think the kids get a whole lot<br/>
more by seeing me being gracious with my mother than seeing me respond<br/>
spitefully to her. And mostly, she&#39;s pretty cool. But there are times when<br/>
giving guidelines, information, a nudge, light-hearted responses, etc. have<br/>
been useful. And we have lots of conversations processing stuff about her<br/>
and her views when we are alone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps grandma didn&#39;t mean it in a condescending way.  I think it&#39;s<br/>
perfectly acceptable for a grandparent to have an opinion on their<br/>
grandchild&#39;s hair.  It seemed fine enough to say &quot;I like this hair color<br/>
better than the green&quot;.  If the grandma had said &quot;I didn&#39;t like the<br/>
green color&quot; or had repeatedly chastized your child on her hair color<br/>
choice, that would be different.  That isn&#39;t what she said though.  I&#39;ve<br/>
told my daughter that I like her make up better than how she did it<br/>
yesterday, or that I like her hair color better now than the last hair<br/>
color.  It&#39;s my personal opinion.  I could say nothing about how she<br/>
does her hair and make-up or clothing, but I think it&#39;s valuable to have<br/>
input from others that you love on these things.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s part of being open and honest with our children.  If I<br/>
don&#39;t like a particular style of make-up that my daughter is wearing, I<br/>
find it more helpful to say how I did like it, then to say that I don&#39;t<br/>
like it.  It&#39;s a more diplomatic way of saying things in a positive<br/>
point of reference.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-211123681">~~~If you feel like you&#39;re not defending  <br/>
<br/>
your daughter or giving tacit approval to your MIL&#39;s comments by  <br/>

would up the tension in the air and make it uncomfortable.~~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s<br/>
what I was wondering...whether my silence was the best way to help my<br/>
daughter, or whether it might have helped to come to her defense in<br/>
some way....knowing that many of the things that I could have said<br/>
would have had the effect that you mention :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
a relief to hear an objective opinion that letting the comments go<br/>
was/is probably the best way to deal with them (similar comments come<br/>
up frequently...those ones will not likely be the last!) <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for helping me think it through!<br/>

I like this :) <br/>
<br/>
I need practice, though, in order to come to the place where I can<br/>
think on the spot like that....I was stuck at --<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Good grief! Allow her (my DD, her granddaughter) the freedom to make<br/>
her own choices without shaming her!!&quot; And I wasn&#39;t able to think past<br/>
that first reaction :/<br/>
<br/>
Learning to move beyond any negative first reactions and to think more<br/>
&#39;lightly&#39; in those situations is one of my goals....&lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m getting<br/>
there...:)<br/>
 <br/>
~~~ My mom moved in with us 2 1/2 years ago. She has her own space,<br/>
but we see<br/>
&gt; her a whole lot, and I walk the balancing act of letting my kids<br/>
&quot;handle&quot;<br/>
&gt; her as they see fit, and sharing my own little responses when it seems<br/>
&gt; helpful. The goal is harmony though, and I think the kids get a<br/>
whole lot<br/>
&gt; more by seeing me being gracious with my mother than seeing me respond<br/>
&gt; spitefully to her. And mostly, she&#39;s pretty cool. But there are<br/>
times when<br/>
&gt; giving guidelines, information, a nudge, light-hearted responses,<br/>
etc. have<br/>
&gt; been useful. And we have lots of conversations processing stuff<br/>
about her<br/>
&gt; and her views when we are alone.<br/>

Thanks for sharing!<br/>

&gt; Perhaps grandma didn&#39;t mean it in a condescending way.  I think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; perfectly acceptable for a grandparent to have an opinion on their<br/>
&gt; grandchild&#39;s hair.  It seemed fine enough to say &quot;I like this hair color<br/>
&gt; better than the green&quot;.  If the grandma had said &quot;I didn&#39;t like the<br/>
&gt; green color&quot; or had repeatedly chastized your child on her hair color<br/>
&gt; choice, that would be different.  That isn&#39;t what she said though.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; told my daughter that I like her make up better than how she did it<br/>
&gt; yesterday, or that I like her hair color better now than the last hair<br/>
&gt; color.  It&#39;s my personal opinion.  I could say nothing about how she<br/>
&gt; does her hair and make-up or clothing, but I think it&#39;s valuable to have<br/>
&gt; input from others that you love on these things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s part of being open and honest with our children.  If I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like a particular style of make-up that my daughter is wearing, I<br/>
&gt; find it more helpful to say how I did like it, then to say that I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like it.  It&#39;s a more diplomatic way of saying things in a positive<br/>
&gt; point of reference.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, perhaps she did not mean it in a condescending way. I&#39;ll be<br/>
giving this more thought...I&#39;m in the place now though, that, by her<br/>
tone and other signals, she was maybe hoping her comments would<br/>
prevent/influence DD from colouring her hair blue (or green, or red)<br/>
*again* &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input!!<br/>

dye her hair again!!  When I say I hopefully not, it&#39;s because many<br/>
times as a young adult in my life, I made decisions based on just doing<br/>
the opposite of what my controlling elders would have wanted me to do!  <br/>
I don&#39;t think this is the reason behind an unschoolers rationale<br/>
however!! [:D]<br/>
