<div id="ygrps-yiv-749818302">My sister (whose name is also Betty) is in her 30&#39;s and still, to this day,<br/>
will not watch ANY movie that has animals in it, or that features animals. I<br/>
guess she has really self-regulated her movie viewing since she probably saw<br/>
a few animals movies when she was younger and felt extreme sadness at a part<br/>
where the animal gets hurt, abused, lost, in trouble, etc... It doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter that the animals usually get saved in the end or whatever. She just<br/>
won&#39;t see any of them. She even recently refused to watch the movie &quot;Cats<br/>
and Dogs&quot; because of this aversion. She doesn&#39;t mind watching any other gory<br/>
or violent movie, in fact she likes those kind.<br/>
Another thing she won&#39;t watch are any movies or shows revolving around WWII<br/>
or Hitler or concentration camps. She also saw a special on TV about that<br/>
when she was a little girl and was horrified.<br/>
So, I think Betty won&#39;t be ready for the emotional part of animal movies or<br/>
WWII movies at ANY age.<br/>

&gt;   I remember when Josh was smaller, five maybe six, I got the movie Lassie<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Come Home, the old classic, at the library and we watched it until it got to<br/>
the sad part and he refused to watch anymore. He jumped up, turned it off<br/>
and said, &quot;I don&#39;t like that!&quot; He then would not watch any *dog* movies<br/>
&#39;cause he figured they were sad.  We tried to watch a Benji movie and he<br/>
asked, &quot;Is it like the Lassie movie?&quot; He found that it too had some sad<br/>
parts and he  said, &quot;I don&#39;t like that kind of movies.&quot;  He&#39;s overcome that<br/>
somewhat now, but still is touched by the sadness in any movie,(which I<br/>
think is good), to tears sometimes, and looks around to see if anybody<br/>
notices. &lt;g&gt;  But he still won&#39;t watch a Lassie or Benji movie. I guess he<br/>
really wasn&#39;t ready for the emotional part at that early age.  We just NEVER<br/>
know!!<br/>
