   I had a Snugli that we used outdoors alot and for shopping, and another <br/>
one that I don&#39;t recall the name of but it&#39;s in all the Sears&#39; books .It <br/>
goes over one shoulder and holds baby in a nursing position.<br/>
Alot of the time too I just held him!<br/>

&gt;    What kind of sling do you use? We&#39;ve never really used one with <br/>
&gt;Accalia.<br/>
&gt;I have a NoJo but really don&#39;t like it, and I&#39;m contemplating buying a Maya<br/>
&gt;Wrap Pouch. I always hear such good things about OTSBH, but I&#39;m not a big<br/>
&gt;fan of all of that padding.<br/>
&gt;    Hey, isn&#39;t babywearing in different cultures a great topic for your <br/>
&gt;kids<br/>
&gt;to learn about?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I know how you feel. A couple of my best friends got together and bought<br/>
&gt;me a very nice playpen/sleeper before Gary was born and I never used it.We<br/>
&gt;always either held him or kept him in a sling. I didn&#39;t conciously choose <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;be an attachment parent, I&#39;d never heard the term before, it was just<br/>
&gt;natural to me.It was what my instinct told me to do.<br/>
&gt;My own father never quite got it.He asked me once when Gary was about four<br/>
&gt;months old &quot; If he doesn&#39;t sleep during the day, what does he do?&quot; he<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t understand why I wouldn&#39;t put him in a crib and leave him in<br/>
&gt;another room! And this is a  man who has 3 children of his own!<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re talking about the NoJo being described in the Sears&#39; books. Up until a few months ago Accalia spent a lot of time in her Infantino carrier (loved it!), but now she gets so excited whenever we get out her backpack carrier.<br>
