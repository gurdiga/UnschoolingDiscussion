<div id="ygrps-yiv-118438765">We&#39;re reading &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; by Roald Dahl.  Our two<br/>
children love it.  Here is a song by the Oompa Loompas from the book:<br/>
<br/>
John Andersen<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The most important thing we&#39;ve learned,<br/>
So far as children are concerned,<br/>
Is never, never, NEVER let<br/>
Them near your television set--<br/>
Or better still, just don&#39;t install<br/>
The idiotic thing at all.<br/>
In almost every house we&#39;ve been,<br/>
We&#39;ve watched them gaping at the screen.<br/>
They loll and slop and lounge about,<br/>
And stare until their eyes pop out.<br/>
(Last week in someone&#39;s place we saw<br/>
A dozen eyeballs on the floor.)<br/>
They sit and stare and stare and sit<br/>
Until they&#39;re hypnotised by it,<br/>
Until they&#39;re absolutely drunk<br/>
With all that shocking ghastly junk.<br/>
Oh yes, we know it keeps them still,<br/>
They don&#39;t climb out the window sill,<br/>
They never fight or kick or punch,<br/>
They leave you free to cook the lunch<br/>
And wash the dishes in the sink--<br/>
But did you ever stop to think,<br/>
To wonder just exactly what<br/>
This does to your beloved tot?<br/>
IT ROTS THE SENSES IN THE HEAD!<br/>
IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD!<br/>
IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND!<br/>
IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND<br/>
HE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND<br/>
A FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND!<br/>
HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE!<br/>
HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!<br/>
HE CANNOT THINK--HE ONLY SEES!<br/>
&#39;All right!&#39; you&#39;ll cry.  &#39;All right!&#39; you&#39;ll say,<br/>
&#39;But if we take the set away,<br/>
What shall we do to entertain<br/>
Our darling children?  Please explain!&#39;<br/>
We&#39;ll answer this by asking you,<br/>
&#39;What used the darling ones to do?<br/>
&#39;How used they keep themselves contented<br/>
Before this monster was invented?&#39;<br/>
Have you forgotten?  Don&#39;t you know?<br/>
We&#39;ll say it very loud and slow:<br/>
THEY...USED...TO...READ!  They&#39;d READ and READ,<br/>
AND READ and READ, AND then proceed<br/>
To READ some more.  Great Scott!  Gadzooks!<br/>
One half their lives was reading books!<br/>
The nursery shelves held books galore!<br/>
Books cluttered up the nursery floor!<br/>
And in the bedroom, by the bed,<br/>
More books were waiting to be read!<br/>
Such wondrous, fine, fantastic tales<br/>
Of dragons, gypsies, queens, and whales<br/>
And treasure isles, and distant shores<br/>
Where smugglers rowed with muffled oars,<br/>
And pirates weaving purple pants,<br/>
And sailing ships and elephants,<br/>
And cannibals crouching &#39;round the pot,<br/>
Stirring away at something hot.<br/>
(It smells so good, what can it be?<br/>
Good gracious, it&#39;s Penelope.)<br/>
The younger ones had Beatrix Potter<br/>
With Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter,<br/>
And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland,<br/>
And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and--<br/>
Just How the Camel Got His Hump,<br/>
And How The Monkey Lost His Rump,<br/>
And Mr. Tod, and bless my soul,<br/>
There&#39;s Mr. Rat and Mr. Mole--<br/>
Oh, books, what books they used to know,<br/>
Those children living long ago!<br/>
So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,<br/>
Go throw your TV set away,<br/>
And in its place you can install<br/>
A lovely bookshelf on the wall.<br/>
Then fill the shelves with lots of books,<br/>
Ignoring all the dirty looks,<br/>
The screams and yells, the bites and kicks,<br/>
And children hitting you with sticks--<br/>
Fear not, because we promise you<br/>
That, in about a week or two<br/>
Of having nothing else to do,<br/>
They&#39;ll now begin to feel the need<br/>
Of having something good to read.<br/>
And once they start--oh boy, oh boy!<br/>
You watch the slowly growing joy<br/>
That fills their hearts.  They&#39;ll grow so keen<br/>
They&#39;ll wonder what they&#39;d ever seen<br/>
In that ridiculous machine,<br/>
That nauseating, foul, unclean,<br/>
Repulsive television screen!<br/>
And later, each and every kid<br/>
Will love you more for what you did....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
John<br/>
