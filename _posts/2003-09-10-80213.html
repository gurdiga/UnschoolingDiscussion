&lt;&lt; After we had been unschooling for a<br/>
<br/>
few months (he would have been 10) and he had been playing video games full<br/>
<br/>
tilt (no homework and school to get in his way LOL!), I was lying in bed<br/>
<br/>
with him one night as he was going to sleep and out-of-the-blue he said &quot;I<br/>
<br/>
have always thought of myself as a video game guy.  But I only seem to like<br/>
<br/>
one kind of video game, those based back in time with swords and spells and<br/>
<br/>
battles.  Maybe I&#39;m a guy who likes those old times and I am just using<br/>
<br/>
video games to learn about it!&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Connections!<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, as Keith was getting ready to go to the weekly SCA fighter practice, <br/>
I was out talking to him while he put his armor and weapons in the car.  We <br/>
were discussing the state of the SCA, which is 36 years old now, and he and I <br/>
have been in for 26 and 27 years (he the longer).    He&#39;s on an e-mail list of <br/>
&quot;royal peers&quot; (former royalty) and said they were discussing that the median <br/>
age of the SCA is getting older and older.  One Duke in the West Kingdom (he&#39;s <br/>
in Northern California, where the SCA began, and has been in nearly the whole <br/>
time) said that if, when he was younger, there had been the quality of video <br/>
games kids have now, he probably would never have joined the SCA.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been in the SCA since they were born, so they just take it for <br/>
granted.  They can&#39;t help but learn from all the things going on around them, <br/>
and both the boys have been in armor, and both have had boffers (foam swords) <br/>
since they were toddlers.  They have costumes galore, and personalized <br/>
periodesque mugs, and have camped in their own period tents, etc.   But their current <br/>
favorite game is a medieval fantasy thing, and Marty was joyous when he woke <br/>
up today and found Kirby had already gone to work.  He&#39;s been up there most of <br/>
the day playing that.  <br/>
<br/>
The art work on the game is really wonderful.  Morrowind.  It&#39;s an X-Box game.<br/>

There&#39;s a PC version too -- my 11-year-old has been playing it nearly<br/>
nonstop for weeks.<br/>
