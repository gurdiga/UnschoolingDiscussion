<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Katy<br/>
&gt; said she didn&#39;t imagine reindeer floating around like that, directed by<br/>
&gt; the wind.  She figures their flight must be more purposeful and directed<br/>
&gt; than that. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think of it differently.<br/>
<br/>
When the winter or fall wind picks up a seed with that downy stuff attached,<br/>
it really moves.  Usually heads up in a curved sort of arc off the ground<br/>
and away, it&#39;s gone.  That&#39;s the image I tend to associate with that line.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always read it as:<br/>
Then AWAY they all flew, like the down of a thistle.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking strong wind, not hazy summer wind!<br/>

I agree.<br/>
That&#39;s the way that line scans in the poem.<br/>
They flew away quietly and quickly as if by magic.<br/>
