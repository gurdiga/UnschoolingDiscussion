<div id="ygrps-yiv-248923012">There was a boy (he&#39;s grown now) in our unschooling group  who had  severe <br/>
Asperger&#39;s behavior, and the other kids were so  nice to him and so patient that <br/>
he made noticeable progress within a year&#39;s  time, just being out of school <br/>
and being around kids his age (a little younger,  which was fine) who were nice <br/>
whether he wanted to play with them or just watch  them or totally ignore <br/>
them.  Eventually he would play with them a little,  and then more.<br/>
 <br/>
His mom did him a gigantic favor taking him out of school.<br/>
 <br/>
For retrospective diagnoses, my nephew Elijah (the one who was in the  gifted <br/>
class, the one who inspired my sister to offer her kids the option to  <br/>
homeschool, documented somewhat here:  _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice_">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice)">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice)</a>   ) was looked at lately as Asperger&#39;s.  He cried <br/>
a LOT as a baby, and  rocked.  They found something physically wrong and he <br/>
had surgery, but that  wasn&#39;t all of his problem, probably.  He was tested for <br/>
deafness because he  wouldn&#39;t respond to people, yet he was writing very <br/>
early.  He spoke in a  monotone, and still, to some extent does now.  <br/>
 <br/>
When a child can score high at school, school tends to care less about  <br/>
&quot;conditions,&quot; they&#39;ll just justify it as quirks of giftedness.  When a  child&#39;s <br/>
talents are not what school values or when a child won&#39;t play for  school-points, <br/>
THEN the school wants to justify their &quot;failure&quot; to teach, and  they want to <br/>
get special ed funding and to separate the problem child from other  kids, and <br/>
that&#39;s where a lot of labelling comes in.<br/>
 <br/>
These days Elijah Trujillo (my nephew) is growing fancy organic stuff for  <br/>
the Santa Fe farmer&#39;s market (he made money last year and so has already planted <br/>
 for this year), and though he only started learning bass guitar a few months <br/>
 ago, he&#39;s now playing bass, lead and rhythm and kind of alarming well.   <br/>
Stunning progress and musicality, but my sister was always that way.  When  she <br/>
learned a new instrument or musical style, she would zoom along for a while,  <br/>
and then lose interest in favor of something newer and more exciting.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m just blabbering now, lost my train of thought, sorry.  It&#39;s  late.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841051287">Last week on the public radio program _The Infinite Mind_ (also <br/>
available to listen to on the web at www.theinfinitemind.com), was <br/>
the first of a two-part special on Asperger&#39;s (both parts listed <br/>
below):  <br/>
<br/>
Asperger&#39;s Disorder: &quot;Don&#39;t Try to Cure Us!&quot; Part one of a Special <br/>
Report (beginning May 11, 2005) In the first segment of this ground-<br/>
breaking two-part report, we examine the challenges and gifts of <br/>
Asperger&#39;s syndrome, a form of high functioning autism, and what it <br/>
might teach all of us about the difference between the male and <br/>
female brain. We&#39;ll track the emergence of a vocal, largely web-based <br/>
Asperger&#39;s community: Don&#39;t call it a disability, these folks say, <br/>
and please don&#39;t try to &quot;cure&quot; us; we like our differences. We&#39;ll get <br/>
a peek at some break-through research from British scientist Simon <br/>
Baron-Cohen, who believes that Asperger&#39;s and other autistic <br/>
disorders result when two &quot;systematizing&quot; types, like engineers and <br/>
mathematicians, have kids.<br/>
<br/>
Asperger&#39;s Syndrome: Part two of a Special Report: (beginning May 18, <br/>
2005) In this second segment of our two-part series on Asperger&#39;s <br/>
syndrome, we explore the impact of this learning difference in <br/>
children and young adults. We&#39;ll hear from noted child development <br/>
expert Dr. Stanley Greenspan, who believes that the most widely <br/>
practiced therapy for Asperger&#39;s and autism is misguided and may <br/>
actually worsen the condition. We&#39;ll also talk about Asperger&#39;s in <br/>
adolescence with a 17-year-old boy and a psychologist who works with <br/>
these sometimes touchy teens. And, a moving and personal commentary <br/>
from Howard Bloom.<br/>
<br/>
Some final personal comments:<br/>
1.  Though never formally diagnosed, my brother (age 46) has <br/>
displayed many of the traits now associated with Asperger&#39;s.  He <br/>
works as a computer operator, a job at which he can work <br/>
independently.  He does not appear to need much contact with others <br/>
(in fact, he prefers it that way).  <br/>
<br/>
2.  I&#39;ve worked in software development environments for 20+ years.  <br/>
My non-scientific, anecdotal opinion is that Asperger-like traits are <br/>
better accepted, understood, and appreciated in this kind of <br/>
environment. <br/>
