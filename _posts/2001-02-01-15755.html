<div id="ygrps-yiv-432016955">As one who owned an 4-bys long before they became &quot;in&quot; and known as SUVs, I<br/>
think anyone who buys one should be required to take a behind-the-wheel<br/>
driving test in the SUV before they are allowed to buy one!<br/>
<br/>
We haul horses and have always owned 4x4 trucks and Jimmy&#39;s.  I ordered and<br/>
owned the first rootbeer brown and cream truck that became quite the in<br/>
thing after that dumb Travolta movie.  From there it was downhill!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, once they became &quot;in&quot; the manufacturers started adding all kinds<br/>
of toys to them all of which have added to the price and reduced the<br/>
efficiency of the vehicles.  I use to get 17 mpg pulling a trailer loaded<br/>
with 5 horses and 250 pounds of feed plus tack AND with a cabover camper and<br/>
5 kids and two dogs and that was going up the Grapevine!  There is no way<br/>
these newer &quot;efficient&quot; smogged up, electronic gadgeted things could do<br/>
that!  And, before someone jumps on the whole smog thing, my trucks (I won&#39;t<br/>
own anything built after 1971) still pass tests with a better rating than<br/>
brand new vehicles and that is with all the smog garbage removed!<br/>
<br/>
And, as long as I&#39;m on this soapbox &lt;g&gt; I think folks that drive minivans<br/>
should have to take a behind-the-wheel driving test, also!  And I won&#39;t even<br/>
go into the driving ability of most folks with van conversions!!!<br/>
