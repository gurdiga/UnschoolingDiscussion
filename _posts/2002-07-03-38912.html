<div id="ygrps-yiv-910904343">**If the kids are going to bed at the same time mom and dad are, when do mom <br/>
and dad have...ummm...well, you know what. ;)**<br/>
<br/>
My husband is too tired at bedtime to ummm. :)  Once my kids were old enought <br/>
to not be hovered over we started locking ourselves into our bedroom &quot;to <br/>
cuddle&quot;. Before that we grabbed whatever time we could.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to hide from our kids that we have sex, any more than I want to <br/>
flaunt it in front of them. It just is. I decided I REALLY didn&#39;t want them <br/>
thinking that sex is only for young single beautiful people OR criminal <br/>
deviants, which is the message of most of popular culture.<br/>
