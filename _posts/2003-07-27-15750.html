<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Anyway, I was just going to comment on something you said above<br/>
 </span></blockquote>regarding the coolness of kids.  :)  It took me nearly two years, but I<br/>
finally found some folks near me with older kids who do unschool...I&#39;m still in need of some personal<br/>
de-schooling - years of things to undo. I&#39;m working on it! ....That&#39;s all, just sharing a<br/>
bit of personal experience with you so as to maybe ease your mind and<br/>
give you info that is not immediately available to you first hand as you<br/>
haven&#39;t yet found &quot;your people.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Alyce. i appreciate your insight. and to Jenny, for your suggestions. Pam G. i would love to meet up with you! email me privately and we can set something up! Thanks Kelly for looking for the &quot;inclusive&quot; groups for me  in Asheville. what did you mean by &quot;inclusive&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
and....&quot;Also, to the new Pamela....be<br/>
aware, this is not really a list for beginners to<br/>
learn about Unschooling...This is the safe place for old<br/>
hats to support each other in a lifestyle that we all<br/>
understand...&quot;<br/>
thank you, nanci k. i did not know this or i would not have signed up. i did not sign up from the alwayslearning yahoogroups &quot;home&quot; page. i found it in a huge list of homeschool group listings, and they only gave abbreviated descriptions of the groups. if it had said &quot;experienced&quot; i would not have signed up! after i read your post i went to the &quot;home&quot; page of alwayslearning and there i understood that it is not really a beginner list. thank you for pointing that out. <br/>
Alyce, cool group, no, but i think i may join it! <br/>
and with that, i will gently and humbly unsub from this list....good life, y&#39;all.<br/>
pamela<br/>
as above, so below.....blessed be!<br/>
