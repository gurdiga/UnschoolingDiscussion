Augmenting a Home-School Education<br/>
<br/>

HELENA, Mont. -- About 2 percent of American students are<br/>
now taught at home. Educators are confused about how this<br/>
growing practice should be regulated, and also wonder<br/>
whether children who are not fully enrolled in school<br/>
should nonetheless get some public services. The issue<br/>
shows how blurred the line between public and private<br/>
education can become, even when that private education is<br/>
delivered at home. <br/>
<br/>
Probably about half the parents who teach at home are<br/>
religiously motivated and use lessons by mail (or Internet)<br/>
from church schools. Perhaps an additional fourth have<br/>
philosophical doubts about public education, think schools<br/>
are unsafe or feel that their children have special needs<br/>
that regular schools don&#39;t meet. In some cases, parents<br/>
home- school to evade compulsory education; they do minimal<br/>
teaching while having older children care for siblings or<br/>
work in home businesses. <br/>
<br/>
Although children often learn well at home, weak<br/>
regulations in most states mean that officials rarely<br/>
challenge or monitor parents who say they are<br/>
home-schooling. With growing frequency, however, public<br/>
schools offer services to the home- schooled. Districts may<br/>
permit them to enroll part time, for instance; educators<br/>
fear that otherwise these children could later return full<br/>
time with serious academic weaknesses, and in any case some<br/>
districts wanting to qualify for state aid can benefit from<br/>
part-timers filling empty seats. <br/>
<br/>
Here in Helena, Mary Brown has taught her 12 children at<br/>
home while manufacturing clothing there in her nonteaching<br/>
hours. Mrs. Brown says her motive is to give more training<br/>
in basics (like phonics) than public schools offer. Most of<br/>
her curriculum is from a church school, with tests returned<br/>
by mail. <br/>
<br/>
Two years ago her seventh child, Andrea, wanting to join<br/>
regular athletic programs, enrolled at Capital High School.<br/>
Andrea soon changed her mind and resumed home study. But<br/>
she had liked gym and chorus, so Mrs. Brown asked that she<br/>
be allowed to continue in them while taking other courses<br/>
at home. <br/>
<br/>
The school board then voted to permit home- and<br/>
private-school students to attend public school part time.<br/>
About a dozen do so. Andrea, now a junior, is taking chorus<br/>
and pottery; others take French, English, chemistry or math<br/>
courses that parents don&#39;t feel able to teach or that<br/>
private schools don&#39;t offer. <br/>
<br/>
Some board members feared an exodus in which a flood of<br/>
regular students would take only some classes and claim to<br/>
be studying the rest at home. The worry turned out to be<br/>
unfounded. <br/>
<br/>
Bruce Messinger, Helena&#39;s superintendent of schools, said<br/>
he had supported Mrs. Brown&#39;s request, partly to get more<br/>
state aid but also to unite the community, keeping the 5<br/>
percent of Helena students in private- school or home<br/>
settings from being seen as a separate camp. <br/>
<br/>
Julie Mitchell, the board&#39;s chairwoman, noted that the<br/>
policy let the district expand its efforts to serve the<br/>
needs of individual students. For instance, Helena, like<br/>
many districts, already had dropouts gaining diplomas<br/>
through independent study. Other students attend an<br/>
alternative school with mental health services and fewer<br/>
students per teacher. <br/>
<br/>
The Helena experience is one of the varied accommodations<br/>
made to home schooling nationwide. Montana asks<br/>
home-schooling parents to register but regulates no<br/>
further. Nebraska requires them to be qualified teachers.<br/>
Maryland home-schoolers must file study plans, which<br/>
districts evaluate to ensure nominal conformity with public<br/>
school standards. <br/>
<br/>
Iowa requires parents teaching at home to give standardized<br/>
exams or hire a regular teacher to test proficiency;<br/>
parents of children who fall in the bottom 30 percent must<br/>
file a remediation plan or seek help from a public school.<br/>
In Des Moines, teachers will visit home-schooled students<br/>
every two weeks to offer advice if parents request it; each<br/>
teacher serves about 45 students, and the district gets<br/>
state aid for the program. <br/>
<br/>
Every state now recognizes a right to teach at home. To<br/>
bind the community together, as Dr. Messinger said, it<br/>
seems wise to let home- schooled children come to public<br/>
schools for chorus or chemistry lab. <br/>
<br/>
But where should lines be drawn? <br/>
<br/>
In California,<br/>
home-schoolers organized into a charter school to get state<br/>
funds. <br/>
<br/>
And Andrea Brown is now taking a home biology course in<br/>
which the teaching of evolution is optional. Should Helena<br/>
be rounding out the home program of students like Andrea<br/>
with attractive in-school electives, giving them an<br/>
incentive to remain at home and evade standard curriculums,<br/>
whether for religious reasons or out of simple neglect? <br/>
<br/>
There are many controversies - about charter schools,<br/>
vouchers, federal aid, private contractors or home<br/>
schooling - where lines between public and private<br/>
education have become fuzzy. The reason is that there is no<br/>
consensus about how private education, whether in<br/>
institutions or in homes, should be regulated. While<br/>
accountability in public education grows, so do<br/>
quasi-private options - like home schooling - with little<br/>
accountability. That contradiction has yet to be addressed.<br/>
