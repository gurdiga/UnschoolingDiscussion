    I&#39;m not sure about this.  If I go to a church dinner, I like to eat with the children I came with.  We were in a church that made the children go last and my husband was horrified by that.  Our children always got in line with us and we helped them get their things so they didn&#39;t stick their hands in everything... but it is our responsibility to make sure they have what they need.  We don&#39;t attend that church anymore.  Children are not second class citizens, my dh and I agree on that.  They do need to be respectful, but that can be taught by example.  Stepheny<br/>

What is with that?  Not the same scenario, but it reminded me of an<br/>
incident that happened this summer involving some family members.  A<br/>
group of us (sisters and our kids) got together at one sisters house<br/>
to hang out and visit.  I brought lunches for my kids (dietary issues)<br/>
and my half sister, M, brought a lunch for her DS.  Host sister ran<br/>
out to pick up lunch for the rest of us and while she was out I got my<br/>
kids (ages 4 and 2) their lunches because A) they were hungry and B)<br/>
it&#39;s easier for everyone if they were fed and happy and playing when<br/>
my food arrived rather than them be cranky and impatient to eat.  Who<br/>
wants that?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Sister M&#39;s son (age 5) asked his mom to get his lunch out too<br/>
because he was hungry and she replied to him in a loud,<br/>
announcement-type voice, &quot;No, you may not have your lunch yet.  It&#39;s<br/>
rude to eat before everyone else has their food.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
F*ck that.  She and I don&#39;t get along (we didn&#39;t even know each other<br/>
until 8 years ago) so her comment was actually directed to ME, but she<br/>
made her son sit and be hungry just to prove a point.  Grrrrr.  The<br/>
poor kid was hungry -- feed him!  My kids were hungry right then and<br/>
I&#39;m not going to make them wait to eat just for the sake of waiting.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand that line of thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-73819316">I see this as mom being in control of course, and then being totally aggravated because the kids are whining and hungry.  I don&#39;t like making them wait either.  We are doing the eat whenever you want and it seems to be working.  I don&#39;t make them wait, and I am trying to remember to bring along a snack and drinks to all our outings.  Most of the time I believe kids go into meltdown because they are hungry or thirsty.  It&#39;s plain meanness to make them go hungry. Stepheny<br/>

I liked your reply. Our family quit the local homeschooling group this fall <br/>
after joining a month or so earlier because of this very same attitude. I had <br/>
gone to a parent meeting, thinking it was just that, a parent meeting. WRONG! <br/>
There was a couple who were giving a talk about how to keep the spark in a <br/>
marriage alive while homeschooling. Problem was the whole talk was about wifely <br/>
submission and how the marriage must come first and the kids must learn this. <br/>
How this teaches the children obedience blah blah blah. They went on and on <br/>
about all these parents who submit to the children by allowing them to be first <br/>
instead of keeping dad at the head with the wife as his helper and the children <br/>
being obedient. I went home and told Darin all about it, he laughed and said; <br/>
&quot;As the head of this household, I command you to never go back. My wife and <br/>
kids are not chattel.&quot; &lt;beg&gt; <br/>

&lt;&lt;  Two women are discussing how children should be fed last at church <br/>

<br/>
I agree at church, if there&#39;s table space for everybody.   And parents will <br/>
want to go through the line and help the littler kids.<br/>
<br/>
But I have another experience with such things.   I&#39;ve been to feasts in <br/>
three pueblos near where I grew up:  San Juan, Santa Clara and San Ildefonso.   <br/>
Feasts are in homes, like on the same day lots of homes will be serving a <br/>
traditional meal.  Kind of like Thanksgiving (different food) in the format and <br/>
tradition, but they have more than one feast day a year, and they differ somewhat <br/>
(different pueblos have different particular days).<br/>
<br/>
Instead of putting up bunches of tables, they serve at the regular table, six <br/>
or eight people at a time usually.  And it&#39;s a precedence order depending <br/>
somewhat on the event and on the rank of the people.  I was often a teenager, and <br/>
so was usually at the last or second to the last table, with whichever friend <br/>
I went with.  Once I went with Rosita Tsosie to a Pueblo where she didn&#39;t <br/>
live (she was from Santa Clara) and so I got to eat when she ate, because I <br/>
didn&#39;t know other people at that house and so they seated me at her &quot;level&quot; of <br/>
precedence.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not discussed much--the people serving just know who ranks next, they <br/>
seat the people that person will want to talk to most, they try not to snub <br/>
anyone, and the meal flows along pretty quickly (UNlike Thanksgiving).  I guess <br/>
one batch of people will be at the table 20 or 25 minutes, and then they clear <br/>
it and switch out casually.   People are informed when they&#39;re going to be  <br/>
next, so they stay near the house (see how often I was a kid and outside with <br/>
other kids? &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not offensive or insulting in that context.  I was just always glad to <br/>
have been invited at all!<br/>
<br/>
The last time I went will probably be the last time I ever go, and it was my <br/>
friend Jon&#39;s funeral.  I was about middlin&#39; of six tables, I think.  I saw <br/>
with his ex wife, who was my age and I&#39;d known them both since before they were <br/>
married, and with one of Jon&#39;s sisters, a few years older than I am.   There <br/>
were younger people still waiting, but they didn&#39;t mind.  They were playing <br/>
video games in the house next door (same lot, relatives) and kicking around in the <br/>
yard talking.   <br/>
<br/>
In an SCA context there are times when my kids aren&#39;t seated the first round, <br/>
if there are people who outrank them and the table&#39;s full.  But that doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean they can&#39;t get to food, just means they don&#39;t get the sit-down candlelit <br/>
first-class section.   That rank isn&#39;t strictly by age, and a guest kid would <br/>
probably sit with a parent if he didn&#39;t know the other kids well enough to <br/>
want to hang out with them.<br/>

I agree with you, and that&#39;s what I was talking about in my post on <br/>
disrespectful parenting.  I think that&#39;s what my dd&#39;s friend&#39;s mom <br/>
practices, and I think that&#39;s what this sort of church thinking does <br/>
as well, frankly.  It&#39;s the way I was raised.<br/>
<br/>
Children are to be seen and not heard.  Father as God.  (Really.  The <br/>
man is the head of the household, just as Christ is the head of the <br/>
Church.)<br/>
<br/>
I remember that I was a non-person as far as my father was concerned, <br/>
until I turned 17.  Then, all of a sudden, from one day to the next, <br/>
my opinion mattered to him.  He would listen to me with respect.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a load of bull.  I respected my children from day one.  I <br/>
understood and worked with the limitations that came with their youth <br/>
and inexperience, and never forgot that I was the responsible party, <br/>
but what they thought and needed and how they felt was always <br/>
important to me as we moved through each day.  As a result, I always <br/>
had happy, well-adjusted kids that other adults found a joy to be <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, you had it right about dd&#39;s friend not listening to her <br/>
mother, only you gave it longer than it&#39;s truly lasted.  You said <br/>
maybe a couple more years.  This girl hasn&#39;t listenend to her mother <br/>
for years already -- that&#39;s part of the reason she got into trouble <br/>
in the first place.  Classic teenage rebellion.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t respect our children, why in the world should they <br/>
respect us (or anyone else for that matter)?<br/>
