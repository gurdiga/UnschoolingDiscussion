<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198044373">We had fun im my house last night. My husband finished reading to us<br/>
&quot;How to Eat Fried Worms&quot; which he had started reading at breakfast.<br/>
After he was done, he  read about other books the author hs written. DS<br/>
did not know the meaning of a word being read, so DH said &quot;Look it up.&quot;<br/>
A couple of minutes later, my bedroom was invaded by a little boy<br/>
bringing in a dictionary &quot;to look it up.&quot;  The word was &#39;sly&#39; He didn&#39;t<br/>
know the meaning of one of the words in the definition, so proceeded to<br/>
look it up. The dictionary he was using didn&#39;t have one of the words for<br/>
which he was searching, so he ended up bringing in two others, including<br/>
a Children&#39;s Dictionary. He only accepted my offer to help when he could<br/>
not decipher a word. His comment was: &quot;This is my search.&quot; He sat on my<br/>
bed going between three dictionaries for several minutes before deciding<br/>
to read the Children&#39;s one. He pored over it for quite a while, and<br/>
ended up drawing his version of a soccer field he saw pictured in it.<br/>
Another cool part was that he said using a dictionary is easy, He<br/>
critiqued the differences in how two of them were arranged based on user<br/>
friendliness.<br/>
It was so cool to see my normally non reading son get so much into<br/>
looking up a word and reading a dictionary.  It is times like this that<br/>
remind me why we try to unschool.<br/>
