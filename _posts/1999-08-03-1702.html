<div id="ygrps-yiv-335756272">Hello Sandra!  <br/>
    Your post caught my attention!<br/>
<br/>
  I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have four young children, and they all are quite spirited.  It is so<br/>
&gt; wonderful to affirm these positive qualities, and work with the<br/>
&gt; child instead of against them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  FOUR!  oh my!  what&#39;s your secret in keeping up with them?  Can you <br/>
suggest a good vitamin?  :)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I am starting a spirited child study group,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Way to go!!!  I&#39;ll be cheering for you and wish you lots of <br/>
success!  There is such a need to educate people about the spirited <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and this site had some excellent book suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Since I just joined this group, i don&#39;t know where you or <br/>
anyone else is at in your familiarity of the spirited temperament.  <br/>
At the risk of possibly repeating info that many of you may already <br/>
know, &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot; by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka is the <br/>
number one most highly recommended book on the subject of the <br/>
spirited temperament.  She has rightly become &quot;THE&quot; most respected <br/>
authority.<br/>
<br/>
 I am going to make a reading list now,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and get a flyer together to hand out tomorrow at the LLL meeting.  I<br/>
&gt; have a group of moms with preschoolers and young kids waiting to<br/>
&gt; hear about this group.  I think I have found a good focus for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warmly,<br/>
&gt; Sandra Brown<br/>
&gt; Ann Arbor, MI<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Sandra, I believe Mary Sheedy Kurcinka lives in MI so my guess is <br/>
that you are probably already familiar with a lot of her work?  <br/>
<br/>
  I hope this is not inappropriate, but i&#39;d like to make you and <br/>
others aware of another email support group list for &quot;parents of <br/>
spirited kids&quot;.  Schooling seems to be a never ending topic there.  <br/>
some parents are unschooling or home schooling but the posts related <br/>
to schooling are typically the frustrations of the parents in the <br/>
problems they are facing with their spirited children in the school <br/>
systems.  It certainly reinforces my belief that I would be making <br/>
the right decision to unschool Sterling.  Whether it&#39;s parenting or <br/>
schooling at home, there are frustrations and issues specific to <br/>
understanding and dealing with the temperament of the spirited child.<br/>
Our group focuses on sharing those frustrations and strategies to <br/>
help resolve the difficulties and encourage positive responses. <br/>
<br/>
   You can visit the discussion group URL listed below for psk in my <br/>
signature line to get more info or subscribe.  or send a blank email <br/>
to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:psk-subscribe@egroups.com">psk-subscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>
I hope this does not come across as advertising inappropriate for <br/>
this group but hope to just provide another support resource for <br/>
parents who have chosen to unschool their child and might be having <br/>
the additional challenge of their child&#39;s intensity, persistance, <br/>
transition difficulties, energy level, sensitivity (environmental, <br/>
physical, and emotional), distractibility, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786745845">I have two very spirited dd&#39;s, ages 2 & 6.<br/>
(actually 1 month shy of 4 years apart--I thought that was enough <br/>
rest...ha!)<br/>
I also thought I couldn&#39;t get another spirited/intense child--HA!<br/>
My higher Power indeed has a sense of humor!<br/>
I cannot imagine having four, Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot; has helped to put things into perspective for <br/>
me, too, Michele.<br/>
