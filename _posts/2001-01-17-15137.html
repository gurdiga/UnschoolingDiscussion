<div id="ygrps-yiv-241280857">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am pretty new to this list, but I have a few questions maybe someone out <br/>
there can help me with.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sandi.  I currently live in St Louis, Missouri, where we <br/>
unschool our two children ages 8 and 5.  We are considering a move to <br/>
Minnesota, but I am a bit put off by their homeschooling laws.<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if there are any unschoolers from Minnesota out <br/>
there.  I know they exist, but I would like to hear from them how they deal <br/>
with the regulations and testing.  One of the reasons we took the kids out <br/>
of school in the first place was all the silly testing, and though I would <br/>
love to move to MN, if it means giving up my right to unschool my kids, I <br/>
am not sure we will do it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any insight into this.<br/>
<br/>
