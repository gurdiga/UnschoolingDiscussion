<div id="ygrps-yiv-42656256">Hi Nancy,<br/>
I&#39;ve copied the section I could find.<br/>
<br/>
In response to somebody&#39;s comment re. people who couldn&#39;t cope with home<br/>
schooling, then you&#39;re right, they probably wouldn&#39;t be on this list, but<br/>
the comment was in response to Nancy&#39;s posting. Hm, just found the posting:<br/>
will go and respond to it directly.<br/>
<br/>
In response to your comments:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; homeschool their kids because they would go crazy spending all day<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A teacher chooses to be with x number of children all day. Why is it so hard<br/>
for people who are so keen on spending time with their children to<br/>
understand that, for other people, it&#39;s not what they want to do? They enjoy<br/>
their jobs, or they enjoy their time out. Not all kids are unhappy at<br/>
school. Some kids love it and would hate to be at home. I know this list is<br/>
for home schoolers (we do, home school I mean) and we love it - but I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do it a few years ago when my career still meant the<br/>
world to me - as did my children, but they were happy at school, and I was<br/>
happy so changing it wouldn&#39;t have brought us anything better - we would<br/>
have been unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. What the heck have you turned them into that makes them so<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a case of turning them into something unpleasant (not all of them<br/>
anyway). Some children really are revolting at home and lovely at school.<br/>
Some people just want to do something other than be directly involved in<br/>
facilitating their childrens education. It doesn&#39;t make them bad people -<br/>
just different to us who choose to do it ourselves.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe I have this attitude because I haven&#39;t come across any dissenting<br/>
voices re. home ed. (we&#39;ve been doing it for almost a year). Only on two<br/>
occasions have people made non-positive comments: the first was in a shop in<br/>
town, the sales assistant asked if the DD&#39;s were having a day off school,<br/>
they replied in unison, &quot;No, we do home ed.&quot;, the woman looked at me and<br/>
said, slightly sarcastically, &quot;What lesson is this then&quot; (we were buying a<br/>
present for a friend), I shot back &quot;Economics.&quot;, she smiled and shut up; the<br/>
second time was a lady at a check out and she so couldn&#39;t get her head round<br/>
the idea that I just smiled sweetly and thought it&#39;s probably better for her<br/>
and her child that she doesn&#39;t home ed. (my opinion). But other than those<br/>
two times everyone has been positive and interested in what we do. Various<br/>
people have asked if I&#39;ll &#39;take on&#39; their children as well... I always so<br/>
&#39;No thank you&#39; as nicely as possible (and take it as a compliment!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The bit below is the section from earlier - my comments re. flak jackets etc<br/>
are my sense of humour and I aplogise to anyone who doesn&#39;t see it that way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boy, am I going to get shot to pieces but here goes...<br/>
Have you ever stopped to think that, for some people, for a myriad of<br/>
reasons, it is actually better that they go to school than stay at home? For<br/>
some adults, having children at home all day and everyday, takes more<br/>
patience and love and understanding than they have to give. I know of two<br/>
mothers who, whilst they love their kids and would defend them to the hilt,<br/>
would be in the looney bin by the end of the week and their kids in care if<br/>
they weren&#39;t in school. And what about the people who have to go out to<br/>
work? Public schools aren&#39;t all great, some have some very good bits, some<br/>
have some very bad bits: a lot just muddle along okay - a bit like the rest<br/>
of us.<br/>
Slipping quickly into her flak jacket, she signs off and ducks, Carolyn<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] literacy rate??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Help!!  I got in a pissing contest with a lady (probably put my foot in my<br/>
&gt; mouth) about homeschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Somewhere (of course I can&#39;t remember where now) I read statistics that<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; the literacy rate was higher before public schools were mandatory in the<br/>
&gt; United States, when everyone had to learn by themselves or by teaching<br/>
each other.<br/>
&gt; Maybe it was test scores???  I can&#39;t remember, and can&#39;t find the article<br/>
&gt; anywhere.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  PLEASE email it to me if<br/>
you can<br/>
&gt; find it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s on an adoption board, where she&#39;s giving me the &quot;We don&#39;t slam<br/>
&gt; homeschooling, so just accept that public school is the right choice for<br/>
me and my<br/>
&gt; family and leave it at that.&quot;  These kids are having a terrible time in<br/>
public<br/>
&gt; school, and my intent originally was to just present alternatives.  Then I<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; the whole &quot;socialization&quot; speech, and the whole &quot;It&#39;s just not for me, I&#39;d<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; crazy with my kids home all day&quot; speech.  I don&#39;t want to be in this<br/>
&gt; debate...but I don&#39;t just want to drop it...it would seem too much like I<br/>
agree that<br/>
&gt; public school is OK.  :o/<br/>

Well, just because I myself was a good student and absolutely LOVED <br/>
school and everything about it doesn&#39;t mean that leaving my kids in <br/>
school was the right thing.  Could they have continued on in the <br/>
school they were in?  Probably....they weren&#39;t getting bad grades, <br/>
except my older son in math, but they were already prepared to give <br/>
him some kind of business math course in place of Algebra, so he <br/>
could have done OK there.  We could have continued on, but I <br/>
couldn&#39;t in good conscience do it.   <br/>
<br/>
No, people who don&#39;t homeschool aren&#39;t &quot;bad&quot; people, but I myself had <br/>
to question why I would want to leave my kids in a system that is <br/>
squelching their potential, that is literally designed to keep them <br/>
from succeeding, to keep them from being free thinkers and from <br/>
breaking out of the mold society wants to place them in.  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
do it.....I had to give them a chance.  Even if kids in school get <br/>
straight A&#39;s, that doesn&#39;t mean school is good for them.  It&#39;s still <br/>
keeping them from reaching their potential.</div>

School might have done that.<br/>
<br/>
For each child who is dragged to school crying and screaming (or pushed to <br/>
school saying, &quot;NO, mom&quot;), what are the odds that the trauma and seeming <br/>
betrayal will damage or destroy the bond between them?<br/>
<br/>
And how much advice is out there to break that bond earlier so the first day <br/>
of school won&#39;t be so traumatic?<br/>

Seriously this horrifies when people say this. The lost connection, <br/>
the mild contempt, the mind frame here, I feel VERY sorry for the <br/>
kids and ache for the person they could be, the special happiness <br/>
they are missing, the real love they could feel if the parents didn&#39;t <br/>
feel this way. I do feel like the majority of people who say this <br/>
really mean it and will have always lost a so very important <br/>
connection with their child so that when the child does grow up, <br/>
contempt for the parents will destroy or severely test the family <br/>
bond. Brothers and sisters will not support each other. A general <br/>
unhappiness at the parents will develop and later as a grown child <br/>
decides to visit home, they might come away with the attitude, &quot;damn, <br/>
I&#39;m not going back there for a while!&quot; Will they ever feel the total <br/>
unconditional plus this kind of love bond a homeschooled grown child <br/>
will likely feel? Maybe, but I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
I never say much about shame but this is a shame.</div>

That&#39;s how I feel when people say they&#39;re going to unschool except or math, <br/>
or except for reading.  That&#39;s how I feel when people say they&#39;re going to <br/>
unschool but that doesn&#39;t mean their kids aren&#39;t still going to do exactly what <br/>
they say otherwise, and they&#39;re not going to spend their lives playing video <br/>
games or watching TV or doing whatever they want.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why people have said I was mean sometimes, because I don&#39;t say &quot;Ok, <br/>
COOL!&quot; when they express how they intend to sabotage their own attempt at <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad when people send their kids to school without knowing there&#39;s an <br/>
option, but at least they have the comfort of having society&#39;s backing, the <br/>
approval/sympathy of their relatives, the &quot;support&quot; of teachers telling them they <br/>
did the right thing, etc.  They can blame any failings or unhappiness on the <br/>
school.  The school will be blaming failings and unhappiness on them.   That&#39;s <br/>
sad.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not invested in that system any longer, as I once was (not as a mom <br/>
with my kids, but with my self, and as a teacher).<br/>
<br/>
What I AM invested in at this stage of life is helping people unschool, if <br/>
they want to.  And when they claim to want to but say &quot;I&#39;m going to do 70% of <br/>
what you folks say I should do to make it work, though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really <br/>
going to work,&quot; I feel two kinds of sad.   Sad for their kids, first, and sad <br/>
for other if other unschoolers don&#39;t say &quot;put down the switch and the rule <br/>
book&quot; (figuratively speaking; put down whatever traditional things you&#39;re still <br/>
holding on to) and do it wholeheartedly and fully.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243243855">My kids had a neighbor girl they used to play with when we lived in the<br/>
Stepford Village who decided she wanted to homeschool too.  When she asked<br/>
her mother if they could, her mother told her no, because she, the<br/>
seven-year-old, would drive her crazy  if she was around the house all day.<br/>
Besides that, when would her mother be able to go shopping, or to the gym,<br/>
or get her nails done if she had to take care of her all of the time?  Talk<br/>
about screwed up priorites!  My heart ached for this little girl.  It&#39;s one<br/>
thing to think these sorts of thoughts, but to say them out loud to a seven<br/>
year old is criminal.  All of our neighbors seemed to have the attitude that<br/>
they wanted the best money could buy for their kids, and they were willing<br/>
to work as much as they needed to so their kids could have the very best.<br/>

&gt; No, people who don&#39;t homeschool aren&#39;t &quot;bad&quot; people, but I myself had<br/>
&gt; to question why I would want to leave my kids in a system that is<br/>
&gt; squelching their potential, that is literally designed to keep them<br/>
&gt; from succeeding, to keep them from being free thinkers and from<br/>
&gt; breaking out of the mold society wants to place them in.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; do it.....I had to give them a chance.  Even if kids in school get<br/>
&gt; straight A&#39;s, that doesn&#39;t mean school is good for them.  It&#39;s still<br/>
&gt; keeping them from reaching their potential.<br/>

how wrangy kids can be after school and during the summer.  But those kids<br/>
are wrangy *because* of school.  They finally have some freedom, but they<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903886406">I agree with you there.  My nephew just started 1st grade.  <br/>
Kindergarten was great for him.  He loved going and was very <br/>
successful.  This year started out totally different.  He was coming <br/>
home with behavior reports and pretty ridiculous comments on his <br/>
work which is actually quite good.  A different teacher with <br/>
different expectations.  The whole idea of allowing your child to <br/>
get used to one way of doing things and then pull the carpet out <br/>
from under him is a whole other issue for me!  If I had to have a <br/>
new boss every year I am not sure how successful I would be!  He <br/>
wrote &quot;I am not smart&quot; and stuck it on the door.  Talk about a loud <br/>
cry for help there.<br/>
<br/>
There is a great book on raising boys from Dr. Micheal Thompson.  I <br/>
believe it is Raising Cain that has a whole excerpt on the damage <br/>
done by forcing boys to go to kindergarten and seperate from their <br/>
moms before they are ready.  He discussed how society particulary <br/>
does not allow for boys to cry and maintain a close monther/son <br/>
relationship.  We expect them to be &quot;big boys&quot; and how moms are <br/>
manipulated to feel they are doing the best for their sons otherwise <br/>
they will be &quot;babies&quot; or &quot;whimps&quot;, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone with boys might also like his other book which is in question <br/>
and answer format so it is an easy read called &quot;Speaking of Boys&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-268279038">Carolyn,<br/>
<br/>
I certainly agree with some of your comments.  However, I was <br/>
probably not clear enough with my statement.  I was not reffering to <br/>
the general population, but to friends and family who I consider <br/>
just like me.  Others who are perfectly capable of homeschooling and <br/>
who would surely be successful.   I was not reffering to those who <br/>
cannot due to work or budget or those who are probably not really <br/>
great parents to begin with.  So, I apologize for not being more <br/>
clear there :)<br/>
<br/>
I have quite a few friends who think it is really great and love the <br/>
idea but their thought process stops there.  Why?  Because they have <br/>
bought so deeply into the idea that they are not capable, they would <br/>
go crazy, etc.  I feel like there is this acceptable belief in <br/>
society that children are meant to drive you crazy and that parents <br/>
need to get rid of them into hands that are much more adept at <br/>
taking care of them.  Have you met the majority of preschool <br/>
teachers out there?  That is scary, because I worked in training and <br/>
accredidation and it amazed me that people believed because someone <br/>
held a job in a preschool center they were better equiped to teach <br/>
the ABC&#39;s.  It is kind of the same look you get when you tell people <br/>
you want more than 2.2 kids.  I think it is sad that many people <br/>
would never give this a shot or even read about it because they have <br/>
bought into that idea.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  If you do not want to be with your kids all day, why would you<br/>
&gt; &gt; expect a teacher to spend all day with them and treat them well?<br/>
&gt; &gt; (She has 30 of them!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; A teacher chooses to be with x number of children all day. Why is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it so hard<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for people who are so keen on spending time with their children to<br/>
&gt; understand that, for other people, it&#39;s not what they want to do? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>They enjoy<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their jobs, or they enjoy their time out. Not all kids are unhappy <br/>
 </span></blockquote>at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; school. Some kids love it and would hate to be at home. I know <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this list is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for home schoolers (we do, home school I mean) and we love it - <br/>
 </span></blockquote>but I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do it a few years ago when my career still <br/>
 </span></blockquote>meant the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; world to me - as did my children, but they were happy at school, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and I was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; happy so changing it wouldn&#39;t have brought us anything better - we <br/>
 </span></blockquote>would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have been unhappy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that completely depends on the teacher, doesn&#39;t it?  Are there <br/>
some teachers who love their work and are passionate?  Sure.  Are <br/>
there others who suck and need to retire or find a new profession? <br/>
Yes.  What a child gets varies from year to year.  I have my degree <br/>
in teaching and have worked with some great and some not so great <br/>
people.  In 13 years how many great teachers do you think most kids <br/>
get?  In low income communities, how many good teachers do kids <br/>
get?  <br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s not a case of turning them into something unpleasant (not all <br/>
of them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; anyway). Some children really are revolting at home and lovely at <br/>
 </span></blockquote>school.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some people just want to do something other than be directly <br/>
 </span></blockquote>involved in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; facilitating their childrens education. It doesn&#39;t make them bad <br/>
 </span></blockquote>people -<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just different to us who choose to do it ourselves <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also agree that if someone does not want to do it, they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t.  It is all personal preference.  However, I think more <br/>
people should at least consider the options, read some books, talk <br/>
to some people.   They don&#39;t have to ever choose to do it, but isn&#39;t <br/>
it nice to know that it is an option.  I would never look down on <br/>
someone for not choosing to homeschool but I do admit that my <br/>
resepct certainly does not increase when someone tells me they do <br/>
not want to spend time with their children and are happier to have <br/>
someone else do it.  That is different than you saying, I loved my <br/>
career and wanted to continue with it.  That is a choice in <br/>
lifestyle but obviously you were very open minded to other avenues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553451412">**That&#39;s how I feel when people say they&#39;re going to unschool except or <br/>
math, or except for reading. **<br/>
<br/>
OK, I know &quot;unschooling except for math&quot; is an oxymoron, like <br/>
&quot;occasional chastity&quot;&lt;g&gt;, or like giving up smoking 6 days out of 7, but <br/>
having a pack every Saturday night when you go out with friends. <br/>
However, not doing something 90% of the time IS progress in many cases. <br/>
  (In this analogy, one is still a habitual smoker, but has at least cut <br/>
back on the amount of stuff going into their lungs.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t feel &quot;horrified&quot; if people are relaxed homeschoolers who <br/>
still have math lessons daily, because, I don&#39;t imagine it to be very <br/>
unpleasant.  (Perhaps because I liked math.)  Based on my HS friends&#39; <br/>
families, I think living in a gentle family and spending only a small <br/>
amount of time in lessons is greatly superior to either living in a mean <br/>
family or having attend school, or doing school at home for longer <br/>
periods of time.  Being &quot;done with lessons&quot; by 10 or 11 am every day <br/>
sounds like a pretty nice life to me, but maybe that&#39;s only because I <br/>
toiled all day in service to the public school as a kid.  I dunno.  I&#39;m <br/>
interested in thrashing this out further in my mind.<br/>

**What I AM invested in at this stage of life is helping people <br/>
unschool, if<br/>
they want to.  And when they claim to want to but say &quot;I&#39;m going to do <br/>
70% of<br/>
what you folks say I should do to make it work, though I don&#39;t think <br/>
it&#39;s really<br/>
going to work,&quot; I feel two kinds of sad. **<br/>

I thought your cookie analogy was really good and deserves repeating. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300751049"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Some kids love it and would hate to be at home.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But why would anyone be okay with their children hating to be at home? My kids hated it at first too, well my second oldest did, because at home, he is held to a much higher standard of behaviour, while his learning is at his own pace and based on his own desires. He was without the all-knowing Teacher figure telling him when, where, how to sit, walk, talk, stand, read write, learn. No bells to tell him it was time to &#39;socialize&#39; outside for 15 minutes. He was totally lost for the first year or so. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Some children really are revolting at home and lovely at school.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way and my feeling is that the way children/people behave in *any* situation is a reflection of how they are raised. My children are not perfect, by any stretch, so that&#39;s not a judgement on anyone. (Or, I guess it is, but not a &quot;I&#39;m better than you&quot; type judgement).  <br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s son just started Kindergarten. She is constantly praising me on my patience and saintliness (lol). Her son is at school today for his third day in a row and she is marvelling at how well he&#39;s doing. I very gently warned her that some kids (my now 6yo, who did a month in public school, included) are very excited and wonderful for the first little while, but after a few weeks, when the novelty wears off, things may hit the fan. I would never tell her school was bad for her child (although I beleive it is), and I would never tell her to pull him out  (although I certainly hope she does). She says she could never homeschool as she lacks the patience. She could never homeschool because she doesn&#39;t do a lot of reading. She could never homeschool because she needs to go back to work when he goes into Grade One and is full time. Every suggestion...okay argument I make to disprove her theories (?) is met with an &quot;oh, but you&#39;re so patient and such a good mom&quot;. <br/>
I lost my point again...<br/>

&quot;The sheeplike tendency of human society soon makes inroads on a child&#39;s unsophistications, and then popular education completes the dastardly work with its systematic formulas, and away goes the individual, hurtling through space into that hateful oblivion of mediocrity. We are pruned into stumps, one resembling another, without character or grace.&quot; --- NC Wyeth, father of Andrew Wyeth, Artist/Painter, who was home educated.<br/>

Oberlin College and years of work helped me to overcome that.  But I still <br/>
find myself falling into that role with my siblings and parents.  Sometimes it&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
people should at least consider the options, read some books, talk <br/>

<br/>
Sometimes I think we shouldn&#39;t &quot;advertise&quot; what we do so much, but only help <br/>
people who REALLY truly want to do it.   Sometimes I wonder if someone who <br/>
&quot;tried unschooling and failed&quot; doesn&#39;t do more damage to a child&#39;s self worth <br/>
than one who just left her kids in school.<br/>
<br/>
And the more people there are doing something, the more they seem to expect <br/>
others to hold their hands, to walk them through it point by point, and to take <br/>
their flak if they can&#39;t figure out how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a weird thing, but I&#39;ve seen it in other groups too.  When people KNOW a <br/>
group is small, they seem to appreciate the efforts that go into helping <br/>
them.  When the surface and mass of the group/club/movement are big, some people <br/>
think they&#39;re at the mall and can sit on a bench filing their nails and the <br/>
bustle around them will entertain their kids, or them.<br/>

Whether it&#39;s pleasant or unpleasant, it&#39;s not going to be the kind of pure, <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do feel like the majority of people who say this<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually feel differently. A lot of the people that tell me this are <br/>
people that I have known for awhile, both as acquaintances and close <br/>
friends. I believe they do not know what we mean by my saying &quot;we <br/>
homeschool&quot; nor do I believe they understand when I follow with &quot;it is <br/>
just an extension of parenting, you know&quot;. I have sincerely gotten the <br/>
most dumb-founded looks I have ever seen in my life. It&#39;s as if I had <br/>
told them that all of a sudden I switched to speaking in a foreing <br/>
language.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There has to be more than that!&quot; No not really, I tell them and they <br/>
just look at me even more confounded. When I explain to them what <br/>
happens in an elementary school classroom --and why, when I decided to <br/>
teach long ago I vowed that I could not do it because it really is <br/>
insane to try to have 35 7-year old kids sitting silently in their <br/>
chairs for 5-6 hours a day-- their disbelief and now anger grows even <br/>
stronger.<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that homeschooling is still a radical reality. The idea <br/>
of homeschooling as a valid educational choice has settled in but the <br/>
reality of homeschooling is only real to those who do it. It&#39;s like the <br/>
reality of being gay --yeah, it looks fun on &quot;Will and Grace&quot; but only <br/>
those who actually live &quot;the life&quot; know what it really is.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of this really has to do with most people believing that <br/>
education is a consumer&#39;s choice and not part of a way of life. <br/>
Schoolers look at education as a shopping experience. Deschooled <br/>
people, on the other hand, look at it as a way of life. We are like Neo <br/>
awakened to the reality of the Matrix. Some may say that it is true <br/>
only for unschoolers but I really believe that it goes across of the <br/>
board, from the left to the right. Stepping out of the mainstream will <br/>
make you more aware of it, no matter what your ultimate goal ---hence <br/>
the Merovingians in &quot;Reloaded&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why, the other day, afte yet another dumbstruck look, I told my <br/>
husband, &quot;now I know why a gay person would choose to stay in the <br/>
closet. it&#39;s just not worth the anger.&quot; To which he quipped: &quot;Not gay <br/>
in NYC. Gay and black in the middle of Utah&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize to all Utah people. My DH, btw, is a non-black man :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have been really, really thinking about going into the closet. Then <br/>
again, I feel it is my civic duty to talk about these things. It&#39;s that <br/>
spirit of the civil rights movement that my parents instilled in me. <br/>
Still, it ain&#39;t easy when your out there all by yourself and right now, <br/>
that&#39;s what our situation is. We are the only &quot;visible&quot; homeschoolers <br/>
in our neck of the woods. And this is NYC. It sucks.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We are the only &quot;visible&quot; homeschoolers <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know what you mean.  Especially in New York, I think, education is a <br/>
consumer decision as you mentioned.  I remember my now 13 year old had a videotaped <br/>
interview for PRESCHOOL.  And it was oh-so-important so he could get into the <br/>
right private school, yada, yada, yada.  Even back then I thought it was <br/>
absurd.  You&#39;d think, with New York being so densely propulated, there would be <br/>
more unschoolers around for you.  But maybe they are all in the closet.  Not <br/>
everyone can be so tied to the consumer culture, can they?  Did you see Law and <br/>
Order last night (I&#39;m sure it was a re-run).   It was about a $20000 per year <br/>
kindergarden admissions official who was killed.<br/>
<br/>
But here in midwest suburbia, preschool choice is similar.  Not a legacy, try <br/>
this one.  And then there&#39;s the public and catholic school split.  Most folks <br/>
assume I&#39;m a capital C Christian Homeschooler, which is fine by me.  Others <br/>
who actually know me ask questions but really don&#39;t want to know what we do all <br/>
day.  That&#39;s ok too.  We are closet unschoolers.  When people ask when we do <br/>
our lessons, I tell them in the morning.  Because I don&#39;t feel like explaining <br/>
unschooling to a less than receptive audience and because we are not morning <br/>
people and would rather not be bothered.  It can only get worse once my oldest <br/>
&quot;graduates from kindergarden.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I went to pick up a raw milk delivery the other day and the family that hosts <br/>
the delivery out of their sidewalk homeschools.  I was told the incorrect <br/>
time and arrived at 11:30 a.m.  She breathlessly explained to me, dry erase <br/>
marker in hand, that they homeschool and the children aren&#39;t allowed out of the <br/>
house until after lunch, so the delivery is usually at 1.  Yikes.<br/>
