<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824321891">Bridget posted that it seemed if people posted things evenly slightly<br/>
critical of certain concepts they were pounced on.<br/>
<br/>
In response, I don&#39;t think people are pounced on, I think they are called on<br/>
it.  The slight criticism of certain concepts usually pertains to children&#39;s<br/>
freedom to learn how, when and what they choose and how, when and what help<br/>
they are free to reject.  This is the underlying principle of unschooling,<br/>
it isn&#39;t just some side concept, it is the foundation.  So yeah, if you post<br/>
criticism of the main tenet of unschooling on an unschooling board,<br/>
unschoolers are going to speak up.<br/>
