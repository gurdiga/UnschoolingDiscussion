<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317395331">This link is a great one to read - a Review of the Passion, Titled  &quot;Passionate About<br/>
the Passion&quot;,<br/>
written by Deacon Keith A. Fournier.<br/>
<br/>
I went to see the film (at a pre-showing with my church) and was truly touched by it.<br/>
It is horrible, but, Christ was treated horribly.  Two thoughts to share:  All during<br/>
the movie, the scripture verse that kept running through my mind was &quot;By His stripes<br/>
we are healed&quot;......and as I watched the scourging, I understood so much better.  The<br/>
other thought was that no human could have survived long enough to make it to the<br/>
cross...but Christ was not wholly human, he was/is also wholly God, and had the inner<br/>
strength and love to make it all the way.  He willingly gave up his life for us!<br/>
<br/>
Just read this article, I think it will shed a lot of light on our questions....<br/>
