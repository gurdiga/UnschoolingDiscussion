<div id="ygrps-yiv-163644423">We don&#39;t have much in the way of &quot;rules&quot; per se.  We do have certain ways of<br/>
doing things based on reasons.  We work hard not to spill food and drink on<br/>
the carpet so most eating is done at the table.  We have lots of animals to<br/>
care for so most days we are up by 8:00 or so.  We love each other so most<br/>
of the time we try to be nice, share, be respectful.  We have a large house,<br/>
lots of animals, lots of kids so most days we pitch in to help pick up.<br/>
<br/>
The key word above is &quot;most&quot;.  Nothing is written in stone, things are<br/>
fluid....but what is not optional is being part of the family.  If there is<br/>
a problem lets talk it out, work it out, find a solution.<br/>
<br/>
There are days when one of the kids or *I* even am grumpy and out of sorts.<br/>
Perhaps Zach hit his sister or I snapped at somebody.  We talk about it,<br/>
give each other room, forgive and move forward.<br/>
