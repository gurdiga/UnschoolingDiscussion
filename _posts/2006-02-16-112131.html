<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343618054">&quot;I really need some advise I am struggling so much and if school were<br/>
more fun maybe she would pay more attention and actually absorb some<br/>
stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if school worked, you should keep on trying to make if fun. But<br/>
schooling someone is NOT a good way for learning to unfold. School is<br/>
what you took her out of, why are you bringing it into your home?<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t need to pay attention to stuff that doesn&#39;t interest her.<br/>
If the learner isn&#39;t seeing a reason to learn it, or finding something<br/>
fascinating, they won&#39;t learn.  She can jump through the hoops to<br/>
appease you, but that&#39;s not learning.<br/>
<br/>
Pretend like you&#39;ve been given the gift of summer vacation starting<br/>
today.  What would you do if school never existed? What kind of fun<br/>
things would you plan with her if you had no agenda or goals to meet?<br/>
What if today is about connecting and playing?<br/>
<br/>
In that environment, true learning can begin to unfold.<br/>
