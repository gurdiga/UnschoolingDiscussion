<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378040965">&lt;&lt;  I guess I have to just keeping reading and keep trying to change how I <br/>
feel about and react to these issues. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to bounce this into another topic area.<br/>
<br/>
Lately there has been discussion about why unschooling lists are contentious. <br/>
 I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re more contentious than other lists on earth, but if they <br/>
are, why would that be?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t just another way to homeschool.  And people are accustomed <br/>
to going to a book or magazine or website and getting the simple five or ten <br/>
facts they wanted, and then going and doing their project.  When to divide <br/>
bulbs and what fertilizer they need.  How to clean a fireplace or who to call and <br/>
how often.   What to substitute for buttermilk in a recipe.   Where to get <br/>
pool chemicals, if you live in the boonies and want to mail order.<br/>
<br/>
So people look into homeschooling and they see that what happens is a family <br/>
buys a curriculum.  Oh!  Here are some people who don&#39;t.  Okay, instead of the <br/>
curriculum, what do I use?  And hurry, I don&#39;t have much time to read online. <br/>
 And could you e-mail it to me, because I might not find my way back to this <br/>
forum.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are other factors too, more subtle.  Language works with <br/>
labels.  Words are labels.  People like to know who they are by what they&#39;re called, <br/>
but they claim not to like it.  &quot;I don&#39;t like to be labelled&quot; is a form of <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m an individualistic person too cool to be pegged, and I like to intimidate <br/>
other people to try make them think I can control how they may refer to me.&quot;  <br/>
That&#39;s a lot of labelling right there.<br/>
<br/>
Christians are Christians the moment they&#39;re baptised or confirmed or the <br/>
moment they&#39;re born again.  No other approval.  &quot;You&#39;re in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jews are Jewish when they&#39;re born to a Jewish mom.  They&#39;re in.<br/>
<br/>
People who enroll in a school are students there.  There are Montessori <br/>
students, and Waldorf students, and honor students, and pre-med students (I love <br/>
that one especially:  &quot;I&#39;m pre-med&quot;) and law students...<br/>
<br/>
But with unschooling it doesn&#39;t quite work that way. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is more like riding a bike.<br/>
<br/>
Owning a bike doesn&#39;t make you a bicyclist, nor even a bike rider.<br/>
Walking the bike around certainly shows you&#39;re not a rider.  <br/>
Talking about riding it doesn&#39;t make you a bike rider.<br/>
Signing up for a course in bike riding (is there even such a thing??) would <br/>
not make you a bike rider, nor would a certificate saying you had completed a <br/>
course in bike riding change a damned thing if you couldn&#39;t get on the bike and <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
So with unschooling,  you can &quot;not buy the curriculum.&quot;   You can not send <br/>
your kids to school.   But when will you be an unschooler?  <br/>
<br/>
Is a caterpillar a pre-butterfly?<br/>
You have to change inside.  Nobody can tell the caterpillar he&#39;s going to be <br/>
a butterfly.  He might easily be bird food, or road kill from a passing <br/>
bicyclist.<br/>
<br/>
The way to be an unschooler is to change the way you see and think, so that <br/>
you can change the way you act and react..<br/>
<br/>
Nobody can act like a bicyclist (maybe on an off-the-ground bike with a <br/>
bluescreen for a movie, but that&#39;s not riding a real bike for real).  You either <br/>
are doing it or you&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
People can&#39;t act like unschoolers and fool unschoolers into thinking they&#39;re <br/>
really riding it.   They have to become unschoolers inside themselves to the <br/>
point that they&#39;re not always asking &quot;Is this book okay?  Is this idea okay?  <br/>
Is this game educational in any way, and how?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to ask at first, but I think some people think they can ask for <br/>
twelve or thirteen years, instead of really becoming unschoolers at the depth <br/>
where it is part of their thinking and being.<br/>
<br/>
And those who thinking asking forever is the same as being get angry when <br/>
those same people they were asking for help or approval say &quot;You&#39;re not thinking <br/>
it yet.  You&#39;re not keeping your balance yet.  Just go fast enough to feel how <br/>
you need to balance.  Ride it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I asked &quot;Which pedal should I start with?&quot; after two years of riding a <br/>
bike, my friends and relatives might think I was really not too bright at all.  <br/>
&quot;How far should I lean when I turn?&quot;  Exactly far enough.  It works by itself, <br/>
when you do it.  When you become an unschooler, you will know kids are <br/>
learning because you see their eyes,  you hear their breathing, you see their posture <br/>
and you&#39;re there with them.<br/>
<br/>
And so some people, when they read things like that, think &quot;AH!  So nobody <br/>
can tell me if I&#39;m unschooling or not!  Whatever I say is unschooling is, <br/>
because kids learn all the time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.   But if the other bicyclists see you back at the starting point <br/>
messing awkwardly with your handlebars and not really going anywhere, what you say <br/>
you are or can do just won&#39;t impress them.<br/>
<br/>
Other people buy their unschooling.  We&#39;re making our own out of our lives <br/>
and families and homes.   We transform our lives into unschooling lives, and <br/>
it&#39;s just not the same as showing your Calvert receipt and saying &quot;We use <br/>
Calvert; the box should arrive next week.&quot;<br/>

I read the first paragraph and thought &quot;Maybe you just need a better bike!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then I read your second paragraph and realized you knew that already. <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Generally, people learn more from new things than same old things.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re there with them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We were just at a homeschool camp this week. The seniors in high school <br/>
were called up front to pass on their wisdom to the younger kids. Each <br/>
one expressed in some way how important it was to &quot;do&quot; your schoolwork. <br/>
One even said, &quot;Even though I know you hate school, just do it because <br/>
you have to and it&#39;s important.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The moms at my table immediately nodded their heads with gratitude <br/>
because a teen affirmed how they see homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t accept that. I burst out: &quot;I would have said: &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t ever <br/>
do school you hate.&#39;&quot; Blank stares.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke later with my oldest son (16) who said he was already crafting <br/>
his words of wisdom for next year: &quot;Don&#39;t do anything you don&#39;t love <br/>
doing. If you do what you love, you&#39;ll learn how to do it well and <br/>
you&#39;ll get to keep doing it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He carried his copy of Hamlet in Klingon and the Klingon dictionary <br/>
with him all week at camp. Kid after kid asked him why he had brought <br/>
&quot;school work&quot; to camp. He answered, &quot;Because I really love learning <br/>
this stuff.&quot; One followed up with, &quot;But you get to take a break this <br/>
week. Why would you learn when you don&#39;t have to?&quot; Noah just smiled and <br/>
said that he liked learning, any time, any place.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s taught me what unschooling is all about, even as I tried to steady <br/>
the bike too many times and was afraid to take those training wheels <br/>
off when he was sure he could fly...<br/>
<br/>
Once I let go, he flew. And I was there with him to see it in his eyes, <br/>
breathing, posture...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two possibilities (among others, I&#39;m sure):<br/>
<br/>
All of us ebb and flow in the intensity of &quot;active learning.&quot; There are times to just relax, <br/>
unwind, recover.. to passively grow and learn. This might be a season like that.<br/>
<br/>
Or, it might be that you&#39;ve lost touch with your kids. That happened to me last spring a <br/>
bit. I got too involved in some of my commitments and lost touch with my kids. Then I felt <br/>
like our home lives were dull. I reordered my priorities to *be with them* (as Sandra <br/>
pointed out) and that really turned things around. In fact, we didn&#39;t really change what we <br/>
were doing. It&#39;s just that I was now doing &quot;it&quot; with them again and that made me feel better <br/>
about life at home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394659483">I&#39;m delurking to ask for some guidance.  I&#39;ve tried searching the archives<br/>
but can&#39;t do an exact phrase search, and the search topic, &quot;school,&quot; would<br/>

<br/>
My oldest daughter is 8 (I have 3 other children between 16 mths and 6).<br/>
She has mentioned a few times that she wants to try school and is very<br/>
interested right now in visiting school.  She wants homework, she wants<br/>
lessons.  We&#39;ve never schooled, nor followed any curriculum in our<br/>
homeschooling journey, read on a schedule.  I could continue to try to<br/>
analyze it forever and have been pondering it for weeks before deciding to<br/>
just come here and ask for help.<br/>
<br/>
I hit a personal crisis mode when I realized she really does want to go to<br/>
school, and got a mother&#39;s helper to play with my two young boys so I can<br/>
have time just to be with my older two.  If my daughters need more of my<br/>
undivided attention, I&#39;m happy to have my boys play nearby with the<br/>
babysitter while we play games, cook, do our fun big girl things.<br/>
<br/>
If respecting her curiosity means she tries school, she&#39;ll go visit a school<br/>
in the Spring.  My instincts tell me that she is wanting more activities<br/>
with friends her age, she is thirsty for learning - whatever level of<br/>
facilitation I&#39;ve been providing isn&#39;t enough.  I&#39;ll obviously work on<br/>
those.  If she wants worksheets, or more book-based learning, I can adapt to<br/>
help her explore that.<br/>
<br/>
I know that even if I shift my paradigm to keep up with her needs, and even<br/>
if I satisfy those needs, she still may choose to try school.  That&#39;s where<br/>
I need help - with dealing with my own feelings.  I have really basic strong<br/>
objections to institutionalized learning, as probably everyone here does.  I<br/>
have to let my kids be free to form their own opinions.  Hopefully I&#39;m<br/>
worrying prematurely over nothing, but have felt quite anxious and even<br/>
depressed at the thought of her choosing schooling.  Have even felt betrayed<br/>
by her, even though logically I&#39;ve always firmly believed that kids should<br/>
be able to sample and choose their own paths - so here she is ready to<br/>
sample and I&#39;m not ready emotionally.  How do you reconcile your own<br/>
objections to school with the prospect of having one or more of your kids in<br/>
school?<br/>
<br/>
This is long enough and my feelings are tender so I don&#39;t want to ramble any<br/>
further.  I&#39;ve read several of Sandra&#39;s pages and am hoping others here have<br/>
btdts to share, or any other advice on how to deal with this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704217212">My daughter went through that and still does every now and then and then I remind her of what &quot;real&quot; school is like, Maybe I shouldn&#39;t scare her but I tell her the truth, Kids are really mean in school...you have to sit for a really long time maybe learning something you could care less about, I just tell her all the bad stuff about it and then I make sure she here&#39;s me talking to her public schooled friends about all their homework and how they have to be quite in school. I want her to know its not all fun and games, its not &quot;WOW&quot; look at all the friends I could have! Its more like &quot;WOW the kids are really cruel&quot;!<br/>
My daughter craves friends and I believe that&#39;s the only reason she would ever want to go to school. But I am very happy to see that the kids in the neighborhood that we are 7 months new to are a product of the public school system and also a product of being raised in homes where their parents don&#39;t have a real lot to do with them ( really sad), What I am happy about is that now my daughter sees what kind of children are in these schools and she hasn&#39;t talked about going to school with them in months.<br/>
I am not saying that all kids in public schools are cruel but I think allot of them are just using whatever survival skills that they no to use to get through there life&#39;s and that is one of the main reasons My children wont ever go to school, I cannot stand to see them get hurt, they get enough of that just playing with non unschooled kids!<br/>
I hope I made sense, I know I have just rambled away, but I can still feel some of the pain I got being in PS even after all these years ( I am 40, until 12/21 that is!)<br/>
Have a great day all,<br/>

If  respecting her curiosity means she tries school, she&#39;ll go visit a  school<br/>
in the Spring.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Why wait until spring?<br/>
 <br/>
Take her right now.  Get in the car and walk into the nearest  elementary <br/>
school, and ask in the office for a tour.  Go during lunch time,  so she can <br/>
smell the smells and hear the uproar (or silence, depending) in the  cafetaria.  <br/>
Make an attempt to wander the halls unaccompanied and listen in  to classrooms; <br/>
observe the children standing in line to go to the  bathroom.  Watch <br/>
carefully to see if the teachers smile at the children,  and be sure to listen to the <br/>
way the teachers speak to them.  <br/>
 <br/>
I doubt you&#39;ll get a tour at all, without making an appointment.  I  doubt <br/>
you&#39;ll be allowed to walk down the hall without being stopped.  I  doubt it will <br/>
be a pleasant experience.  But if it is, then I don&#39;t really  see the harm in <br/>
helping your daughter find her way to a good decision about  it.  <br/>

Maybe you could read aloud to her from &quot;subject matter&quot; non-fiction a little <br/>
more.  Maybe you could borrow some third or fourth grade books and go through <br/>
a little bit with her, in preparation for the possibility of her going to <br/>
school.  It might put her off, or she might honestly really perk up and like it.  <br/>
<br/>
If you do that, try not to be neutral or positive, rather than negative.  I <br/>
know it&#39;s hard.  But it wouldn&#39;t be best if she feels she has to choose school <br/>
or you.<br/>
<br/>
If you have friends that age or a little older, maybe invite one over and <br/>
interview her about what school&#39;s really like, the best parts, the worst, the <br/>
boring parts, to help her decide.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218828957">I don&#39;t want to unfairly skew her impression of school by being negative<br/>
about it, but I also don&#39;t want her artificially enamored of it by going in<br/>
the midst of the Thanksgiving - Christmas season.  All the decorations,<br/>
parties, holiday activities.  I want her to see it at just regular school<br/>
time.  It&#39;s just the timing, otherwise I&#39;d do as you suggest and just hop in<br/>
the car and go.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info though.  I think we will just go without an appointment<br/>
as you suggest, and see what our reception is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430511627">Thanks Sandra, that was a very helpful article.  If she does choose school,<br/>
we will definitely be using your article, particularly about detaching and<br/>
not making her feel as if she has to choose between us and school.  I want<br/>
to be very careful to not do that.<br/>
<br/>
My main personal issue is how to deal with my own feelings and issues while<br/>
respecting that she deserves to make her own opinions and decisions.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime we&#39;ll add as much non-fiction as she wants to soak up, and<br/>
really make an effort to help her find more friends her age.  I suggested to<br/>
her that she interview her friends - schooled and not schooled, and ask them<br/>
questions about what they like and don&#39;t like about their schooling<br/>
scenario.  She&#39;s interested in that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Shannon<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ha!  I bet at most schools you could simply walk into the main office, sign in and grab a badge (these are sitting next to the sign in sheets), and simply give yourself a tour.  Nobody would expect the child to have a badge, because they would be assumed to be a student.  Or simply walk in, and if somebody stops you, say you are on your way to the main office now.<br/>

Yes, schools are such safe places...<br/>

My daughter-in-law went back yesterday to the high school where she  <br/>
graduated 4 years ago to visit a teacher who had asked her to stop by to talk  about <br/>
their degrees.  (My dil is about to begin her student teaching in  high school <br/>
history.)  She went in after the bell, and was stopped by  someone who didn&#39;t <br/>
know her, and shown to the office.  She was given a  badge and signed in and <br/>
rudely informed to go straight to the teacher&#39;s  room and straight back.  <br/>
 <br/>
The doors to the school my son and I visited had all the doors  locked from <br/>
the outside, except the one by the office.  There are very  large signs at all <br/>
the entrances, even to the parking lots, that say you are  subject to search <br/>
if you enter the grounds and you will be charged with  trespassing if you don&#39;t <br/>
have permission to go past the office.  That&#39;s how  it is at all the schools <br/>
I was familiar with in that county.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure that it is different in different parts of the country, but around  <br/>
here security is *tight*, and the schools have &quot;lockdown&quot; drills.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887906116">I live in a semi-rural area.  My experience is visiting our local elementary and middle schools.  Everyone is quite friendly.  Ours is also a school district known for welcoming homeschoolers in for part-time classes.  I have not visited the high schools.  Maybe I&#39;ll give it a try sometime.<br/>
