<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021905561">Logan&#39;s first experience with Cuisenaire rods<br/>
<br/>
Last week we went to the &quot;learning store&quot;, which is the local teacher <br/>
supply store.  I try not to use the word teach or teacher around <br/>
Logan.  I don&#39;t want him thinking he needs to be taught stuff, I want <br/>
him thinking he can learn stuff.  This store has a lot of stuff for <br/>
homeschoolers also, including Cuisenaire rods.  I&#39;ve been wanting to <br/>
get these for awhile and have just been waiting for Logan to get old <br/>
enough, he is 4 and a half now.  If you aren&#39;t familiar with <br/>
Cuisenaire rods, they are plastic rods of different lengths and <br/>
colors.  The smallest one is white and is 1 cube long, the next one <br/>
is 2 cubes long and a different color, and so on up to 10 cubes <br/>
long.  They are great for playing with math concepts in a very visual <br/>
manner.  I got the ones that snap together since I thought these <br/>
would be easier for Logan to handle.  When we got home I put the rods <br/>
away and forgot about them.  About an hour later Logan asked me to <br/>
get out the sticks I got at the learning store.  I got them out and <br/>
gave them to him to play with.  I didn&#39;t direct his play in anyway.  <br/>
The first thing he did with them was build skyscrapers, this didn&#39;t <br/>
surprise me because he had watched a video on how they build <br/>
skyscrapers earlier that day.  <br/>
<br/>
After building skyscrapers for awhile he noticed that the different <br/>
color rods were different sizes.  He took the 10 rod, placed it on <br/>
the ground and then started snapping together 1 rods until they were <br/>
as tall as the 10 rod.  He then counted how many 1 rods he used and <br/>
told me that the big rod was 10 long.  I said really?  He then did <br/>
this with each rod working his way down from 10.  When he got to 4 he <br/>
didn&#39;t need to use the 1 rods anymore, he could tell by looking at it <br/>
that it was 4 long, he did the same for 3 and 2.  After doing this he <br/>
noticed that the rods had lines on one side that were spaced out the <br/>
same as the 1 rod, so that you could count how long a rod was without <br/>
putting the 1 rods next to it.  He counted how long each rod was <br/>
using this method and discovered he came up with the same answers.  <br/>
<br/>
He then decided he wanted to put the rods in order from biggest to <br/>
smallest.  Instead of using a trial and error method he figured out <br/>
he could use the number long they are to put them in order.  Problem <br/>
was he was starting at 10 and working his way down, he&#39;s never <br/>
counted backwards from 10.  He knew 10 would be first so he put the <br/>
10 down.  He wasn&#39;t sure what came next, but instead of asking me, he <br/>
checked his number chart that is hanging on the wall.  It has all the <br/>
numbers from 1-100 and has been hanging on the wall for almost a <br/>
year.  Using this chart he was able to put all the rods in order from <br/>
10 to 1.  He then practiced counting backwards from 10 while touching <br/>
the appropriate rod.  Then he counted backwards from 10 without <br/>
touching the rods.  After doing this he started experimenting with <br/>
putting different rods together and discovered that he could put the <br/>
6 and 4 rods together and they were the same length as the 10 rod.  <br/>
He only did this a few times before he got tired of playing with the <br/>
rods and I put them away.  He played with them for a little over a <br/>
half hour and discovered many things in that time.  He did all this <br/>
with no coaching from me.  To me, this is the beauty of unschooling.</div>

There&#39;s a real chain of stores called that, though.<br/>
<br/>
We had a really great store here for years and years called Colborn&#39;s, a <br/>
teachers&#39; supply store.  The family that owned it sold it to The Learning Store <br/>
and it went out of business soon after.  Partly things were more easily <br/>
available by catalog and online than they once had been, but partly because it had <br/>
been run as a local family business, and the chain was very &quot;whatever&quot; about the <br/>
particulars of having just another store in a podunk state (it seemed, the <br/>
attitude).<br/>
<br/>
I really like teachers&#39; supply stores.  Some things I like for the <br/>
interesting fact of their being so unnecessary and over-priced, but some things really <br/>
are cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Boy, I wish we had a great teacher supply store! I went to the one here <br/>
and couldn&#39;t find anything I wanted. I really expected SOME strictly <br/>
classroom stuff, but more neat stuff like balances, Cuisinaire rods, <br/>
etc., but was disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile we had our own neat math adventure last night. My 4-year-old <br/>
was playing with the calculator, and I showed her how to use the &quot;+&quot; <br/>
key. She had a ball checking the things she knows (2+2 IS four, mom!) <br/>
and finding out some new ones she wasn&#39;t so sure about, checking with me <br/>
to see if the calculator was right. (Mom, what&#39;s 9+7? Yeah, 16, look!)<br/>
