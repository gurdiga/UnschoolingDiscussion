<div id="ygrps-yiv-811540766">HI Libby,<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to your Christian group problem. I have had the same problems <br/>
here in Pennsylvania. Even though we are Christian, we are not Christian enough <br/>
for most of the closed minded hypocrites we have met. <br/>
How most of these people can call themselves Christians is beyond me, when <br/>
all they do is judge you and then ignore you because they don&#39;t like the way you <br/>
look or dress.<br/>
I let my kids dress the way they want and wear their hair the way they want <br/>
and that just doesn&#39;t go over real big out here. Moving here was the biggest <br/>
mistake I ever made. I thought that it would be a better environment for my <br/>
kids...what a joke! All that they have had to deal with is being judged on their <br/>
looks and not by the kind of people they are. <br/>
<br/>
I have never tried to shove the Bible down anyone&#39;s throat nor look down on <br/>
anyone that doesn&#39;t go to church. The only one that has the right to judge <br/>
others is Jesus, but I guess most people out here skipped that part of the Bible!<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there, maybe you should try to start a group on your own. That is my <br/>
new plan, I have started an unschoolers group, we will see what happens.<br/>

I&#39;m having trouble so is someone else. <br/>
