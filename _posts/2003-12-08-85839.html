<div id="ygrps-yiv-901085481">Quiver full as in children? Front page of AOL yesterday said 4 or more <br/>
children is a status thing with the more affluent families.  Its my experience that <br/>
the thought is the more the merrier in the Christian circles.  But why on <br/>
earth would someone comment on your families choice or husbands for that matter to <br/>
get a vc?<br/>

some circles for agreeing with my husband&#39;s &gt;decision to have a vasectomy <br/>
because of the QF ideals...<br/>
  I&#39;m finding this bizarre. I&#39;ve never encountered this with the Christans I <br/>
know here (I&#39;m beginning to exclude myself from the christian label I think). <br/>
Are Canadian christians more moderate? Or just Nova Scotian ones? Or is this <br/>
QF idea just a fundamental idea?<br/>
<br/>
  Dawn (who knows most Christians she knows would laugh at the QF idea)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-512351509">Yes, &quot;quiver full&quot; is a term in some Christian circles regarding how many children a family has. <br/>
 <br/>
Basically the theology is that birth control of any kind is wrong, and that God will provide the means to take care of any children He may bless you with. Some see it as wrong even where health concerns make it difficult for the mother to be pregnant, because to them it means you must not be trusting in Him fully. <br/>
 <br/>
So by admitting that my husband had a vasectomy, even for reasons to us that are biblical (his role as husband to protect me from dangerous situations) others felt they had the right to condemn us for because as Christians we are told to speak to one another if we see that another is doing something &quot;wrong.&quot; <br/>

I have to say in my fundamentalist Baptist Church that does NOT happen at <br/>
all.  No one would presume to tell you to have or not have more children.<br/>
<br/>
I have always accepted my children as a blessing from God.  My DH had a <br/>
vasectomy, I don&#39;t even know if the &quot;church&quot; as a body knows or would even care to <br/>
know.  We do NOT discuss as a general rule things like that with the entire <br/>
church body and I don&#39;t hear it from anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Must just be SOME of the Christian groups that do that.  Like with everything <br/>
in life, there is a broad spectrum of how people chose to live their lives.<br/>

Because if a church is preaching something, it&#39;s not that family&#39;s choice any <br/>
more.  It&#39;s God&#39;s will.  And people who aren&#39;t going to do God&#39;s will (as <br/>
revealed by the interpretation of the minister of the church they go to) are <br/>
disruptive and problematical, so the best thing to do is to bring them into line.<br/>
<br/>
That sheep and shepherd analogy is big with fundamentalist Christians.<br/>

No, but she did ask if Canadian Christians or other Christians were like that <br/>
or different.  I just told what I know about the Christians I know and am <br/>
around.<br/>
