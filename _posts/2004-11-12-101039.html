 </span></blockquote>Your kids seem very inquisitive, smart and well  behaved.  What about kids not <br/>
like that.&quot;  I said that from what I&#39;ve  seen,  most of those  &quot;problems&quot; go <br/>
away when you remove  school.   I told her all kids shine when they unschool.  <br/>
:)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Good answer.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m dealing with this too. I spoke with a friend yesterday. Strict Catholic  <br/>
Dictator. And she likes it that way.<br/>
 <br/>
She & her husband adopted their two great-nephews, now 13 & 12.  They were <br/>
horribly abused (cigarette burns on their scalps, etc.) They were  taken from <br/>
their bio parents at four & three, I believe (I could be off by a  year either <br/>
way). Bio-parents imprisoned for abuse and drugs.<br/>
 <br/>
The younger boy is fine: he follows the rules (of which there are MANY!),  so <br/>
he&#39;s no problem. The older boy is totally out of control. He was expelled  <br/>
last week. He has NO privileges: they&#39;ve all been removed. He goes to work with  <br/>
his father and sits at the office all day unless his dad tells him to help <br/>
the  janitor empty the garbage.<br/>
 <br/>
They said they could pinpoint when he went off: last September when his  <br/>
great-grandmother died. She would allow him to walk to her house, eat oreos,  <br/>
drink cokes, and watch cartoons all day----in other words (IMO), the only one  who <br/>
showed him unconditional love.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s very sad. He&#39;s a handsome, smart boy with a great smile.  Charming.<br/>
 <br/>
My friend said that they &#39;tried&#39; it my way: they gave him his privileges  <br/>
when he was good----but that didn&#39;t last long.  It&#39;s hard to explain that  THAT <br/>
wasn&#39;t what I&#39;m talking about----that he should get these things because he  is <br/>
Who He Is----NOT because he followed the rules.<br/>
 <br/>
Now, his food is tightly monitored (no cokes or oreos---with cokes in the  <br/>
house, one night he &#39;stole&#39; four in the middle of the night----so no more cokes  <br/>
allowed), no tv, no games, no swimming, no NOTHING! He&#39;s not allowed to do  <br/>
anything that he likes. <br/>
 <br/>
And yet they wonder why he&#39;s difficult.<br/>
 <br/>
Her comment to me was, &quot;But Cameron has always been so easy. This one had  <br/>
lousy parents---it&#39;s all genetic.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
We are polar opposites. But I could see him THRIVE in my house. Absolutely  <br/>
thrive.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I haven&#39;t seen him in four years. I might be seeing him in a few weeks. I  <br/>
hope we can spend some time together. His young life sucked. But now he&#39;s having <br/>
 the life sucked OUT of him.<br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly, so sad<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184826675">It could be either a misunderstanding of what unschooling is - or they want to be - but yet aren&#39;t there yet. I have come across many that believed that unschooling is simply not using a curriculm. But I have found that this is not true! True Unschooling encompasses much more than that. This takes a bit more learning, especially if one has not really experienced any other models  than what they are surrounded by.<br/>
<br/>
With the plastic toys and video games and such - this comes from a personal preference of the parent (or hang-up). I have found it difficult when my son purchases(or I am purhasing for him) those combat/army figures. It bugs me, however I have had to examine that he is not me, that he has his own likes and dislikes. To make him feel bad for this because it&#39;s not my thing, is like belittling his father for watching football - when it bores the tar out of me ;-) My associations with these figures and military stuff (that look so real!) come from the &quot;real war&quot; that I am concerned about. When I look at what my reation/feelings are really about its not about the toy- but about bigger issues. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;To present yourself as one thing, but live another discredits both for those who see you as a picture of what homeschooling is.  It also leaves me wondering why you&#39;d choose a method you&#39;re ashamed to admit to using -- other wise why call yourself an unschooler when you aren&#39;t?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is very true, but I think it stems from &quot;wanting&quot; to be an unschooler but not being quite there yet. So, the moral of the story is just say it like it is....<br/>

It makes me so mad when people don&#39;t understand that anger in teens can often be depression, that anger can often be grieving -- how about lots and lots of love. I know when you mention this to people if they listen, their first reaction is to go with meds -- but, I know first hand it does not need medication. How very sad for this young man! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93737120">How sad to see child with no privileges -- besides the fact that often what strict parents call privileges are really basic human rights!  I&#39;ve always wondered what reason a child with no privileges has to change.  Why bother when you&#39;d have to work so very hard to see any &#39;progress&#39; or joy in your life?  No wonder he&#39;s so unhappy and angry.  <br/>
 <br/>
I remember when my brother was being very difficult in high school, and my parents were grounding him endlessly.  His attitude was &quot;what are they going to do -- ground me again? I&#39;ll just leave again.&quot;  It was all so counter-productive.  And in the years since, they&#39;ve wondered why he&#39;s developed such a drinking problem....<br/>

<br/>
Well that&#39;s the big problem, whether there&#39;s any such thing as &quot;real <br/>
unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people say no one can define it, and that anyone who&#39;s not using a <br/>
curriculum and doing school at home is an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
-=Is this maybe the cause of all the recent debates about what constitutes <br/>
&#39;real&#39; unschooling?  Or have these pretenders always been there, and the debates <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not the cause, and they don&#39;t think they&#39;re pretending.  <br/>
People go a little way and identify themselves and don&#39;t want any pressure to <br/>
do more.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago on AOL the discussions about what was and wasn&#39;t unschooling <br/>
resulted in the term &quot;eclectic homeschoolers&quot; being used, and now there are lists <br/>
and websites with that name.  People who do some unschooling, but maybe not in <br/>
all subjects, or they use some &quot;methods&quot; and some exploration.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It really bugs me to have someone call herself an unschooler, then hear <br/>
her tell her child &#39;you don&#39;t play with plastic toys&#39; or &#39;you don&#39;t play video <br/>
games.&#39; -=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh that.<br/>
But those things aren&#39;t necessary to unschooling.<br/>
I think they&#39;re helpful (not everyone agrees with me) and I think if a parent <br/>
continues to examine what she&#39;s doing and how her children are learning, <br/>
they&#39;re a logical extension (but not all parents are self-examining and big into <br/>
logic).  but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re the made-it-or-break-it areas.<br/>

joy in your life?  No wonder he&#39;s so unhappy and angry.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a story about a kid who&#39;s in school, so anyone who&#39;s pressed for time <br/>
should just skip it.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is working with a boy who&#39;s 18 and went to school.  I know both his <br/>
parents.  They&#39;re not very nice to him, and he&#39;s been angry and bullying since I <br/>
met him, when he was 11 or 12.<br/>
<br/>
Marty invited him over tonight, for  a Halo party that&#39;s actually Kirby&#39;s <br/>
party.  I said, &quot;Okay, Marty, but you&#39;re responsible for his behavior.  If he <br/>
starts getting loud and bullying, get him to stop.  You can use me as a bad guy <br/>
if you want to say, &#39;You need to chill or my mom will throw you out.&#39;&quot;  Marty <br/>
didn&#39;t give me a quizzical look.  He knew EXACTLY what I was saying.<br/>
<br/>
His mom told me last spring that as soon as the boy was 18 (he&#39;s an only <br/>
child, she&#39;s his stepmother, but has been there most of his life) he was out.   I <br/>
told her we weren&#39;t throwing Kirby out.   We do have more room and more money <br/>
than they do, but having him there won&#39;t kill them.   So he&#39;s 18 and still <br/>
there, but this job they have is okay for Marty for spending money but not so <br/>
great for the other kid if he really wants independence.  He&#39;s going to buy a car <br/>
from his aunt with the money, and then I guess he can get a better job.  <br/>
Usually Marty gives him a ride.  He used to take the bus.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I drove Marty and picked the kid up.  He said &quot;I&#39;m all cut up from <br/>
my bed.  I have lots of little cuts on me because a spring poked through.&quot;    <br/>
SHEESH!!!  He&#39;s sleeping on a box spring and not a mattress, and he&#39;s not a <br/>
small/light person.   His parents could honestly afford a mattress from a thrift <br/>
store, or just ask around all our friends and find one.  But then again, this <br/>
guy&#39;s smart enough to have done that himself, or to put some padding between <br/>
him and the springs.  Each person in that family is increasingly beat down and <br/>
negative.   <br/>
<br/>
So on one hand I&#39;m sympathetic and with his parent would do more to make his <br/>
life comfortable.  And on the other hand, I just have an urge to make my own <br/>
kids that much more comfortable, and try to subtly keep him away from them when <br/>
I can.<br/>
<br/>
If decisions are made with &quot;this can be a little bit better&quot; as a basis, <br/>
things get better.<br/>
If decisios are made with &quot;whatever,&quot; or &quot;things can only get worse, then <br/>
things will get worse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242400666">What makes you feel lead to go in that direction?  <br/>
<br/>
Some of your questions are not easy to answer because they don&#39;t make sense in unschooling terms.  If you believe that people learn what they need to know -- then you believe that your children (as people) will learn what they need to know, and that what they have learned is what they needed to know.  If they didn&#39;t learn it, they didn&#39;t need to know it (yet).  I think of that as all inherent in defining what learning/knowing/unschooling means.   But is all circulare BECAUSE it is all in the definitions. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if your questions are actually closer to these: (1) Will my children wish later that I had made them learn something else now?  (2) Is there a &quot;window&quot; where if my children do not learn something now, they will be unable to learn it later (due to lack of ability or desire or time?) <br/>
<br/>
The answer to those questions, IMO, is (1) who knows? but is it worth the damage to your relationship by forcing them now? and (2) No - they can always learn what they need to know when they are motivated by needing to know it.  <br/>
<br/>
I was not unschooled as a child - but with very few exceptions, the things that I learned as a child and retained and used, were all things that I learned outside of school.  (I was a &quot;great&quot; student in school terms (all As) - but I learned things for the tests and promptly forgot them.)  So, I think I can truthfully say that my actual current knowledge was almost entirely acquired by unschooling.  And I&#39;d probably know a lot more if school hadn&#39;t wasted so much of my time! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751801601">That makes sense, and like I said before I&#39;m out of all the loops, so I<br/>
don&#39;t really know if I&#39;m any specific type -COMPLETELY- that&#39;s why I was<br/>
thrilled to find this group and in one of the first messages I read<br/>
someone mentioned &#39;the many degrees of unschooling&#39; -I have only called<br/>
our style &#39;unschooling to a degree or sort of eclectic&#39; I&#39;ve been very<br/>
careful to not say &quot;We are ___&quot; because, frankly, I love watching my<br/>
kids learn and I don&#39;t care how they do it!!!  I don&#39;t use a curriculum<br/>
-my oldest loves workbooks, but I don&#39;t MAKE her do any of them, the<br/>
next loves hearing &#39;you got an A&#39; so I&#39;ll figure out what he &#39;got&#39; on<br/>
something if he asks, but I always tell him that he did great and it<br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter what # you put on it if he learned something...<br/>

&gt; really not unschoolers at all.<br/>
&gt; Is this maybe the cause of all the recent debates about what<br/>
&gt; constitutes &#39;real&#39; unschooling?  Or have these pretenders always<br/>
&gt; been there, and the debates bring them out of the woodwork?<br/>
&gt; It really bugs me to have someone call herself an unschooler,<br/>
&gt; then hear her tell her child &#39;you don&#39;t play with plastic toys&#39;<br/>
&gt; or &#39;you don&#39;t play video games.&#39;  Then there are the people who<br/>
&gt; participate in unschooling conversations as unschoolers, but<br/>
&gt; later use phrases like &#39;in our curriculum, we have a lot of<br/>
&gt; activities for small motor skills&#39; or some other such schoolish<br/>
&gt; comment.   I mean, really, if you&#39;re not an unschooler, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; okay to admit that.  If you&#39;re really an eclectic relaxed<br/>
&gt; homeschooler, or a curriculum school-at-hom family, then say<br/>

wondering why you&#39;d choose a method you&#39;re ashamed to admit to using --<br/>
other wise why call yourself an unschooler when you aren&#39;t?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a thing with my local group where one person was worried about reading<br/>
for her 6yo and posted a question about &quot;going with the flow&quot;. I posted that<br/>
I was an Unschooler and pretty much always did so. <br/>
<br/>
Then another mother posted about how she also took an &quot;unschooling approach&quot;<br/>
and went on to talk about how her son balked less than he used to about the<br/>
history lessons she insisted on, and about how she quizzed him verbally<br/>
rather than making him do the written tests in the text book chapters, and a<br/>
number of other purely academic issues that were coercive and schoolish.<br/>
These were not areas of doubt or debate, like tv restrictions - these were<br/>
mandated school-at-home activities.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote about how that was fine and worked for them but was not Unschooling<br/>
because - all the reasons - and I was gentle too, if you can believe that of<br/>
me. ;) I directed anyone who wanted more information to all the usual places<br/>
that we are familiar with.<br/>
<br/>
In the ensuing small firestorm, and the &quot;labels don&#39;t matter&quot; comments, I<br/>
ended up taking the position that they do matter in a situation on line when<br/>
all we have are our words. I talked about the issue that the people who<br/>
decide the definition of vegan are vegans, not people who want to call<br/>
themselves vegan but eat meat on Sundays. I wrote of my passionate devotion<br/>
to Unschooling and about how finding definitions of it from the hostile will<br/>
give an inaccurate picture.<br/>
<br/>
A few people came out of the woodwork claiming to be Unschoolers, including<br/>
one person who is convinced that she &quot;taught&quot; her son to walk and talk.<br/>
(Sigh). There was some conversation about when a child wants curriculum and<br/>
textbooks to use, despite the mother&#39;s desire to Unschool.<br/>
<br/>
The last thing that the mother who was pseudo-unschooling wrote was that she<br/>
had heard that a lot of definitions of unschooling as neglect and then &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>
say no more.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I chose to let it go, and allow the nasty dig clearly aimed at me to stand<br/>
in the light of everyone&#39;s intelligent scrutiny, without me pointing at it<br/>
and taking it personally (even though I think it was meant that way.)<br/>
<br/>
However I did IRL mention to some of my friends from the group, if this is<br/>
what you believe Unschooling is why, in the name of all logic, would you<br/>
wish to appropriate the name to yourself?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360763252">A friend of mine went to a non-violent communications seminar, which <br/>
piqued my curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
I googled a bit, and I like this list of words they posted under the <br/>
title &quot;Feelings when your needs are satisfied&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
These include: affectionate, excited, compassionate, amazed, joyful, <br/>
friendly.<br/>
<br/>
I thought this spoke to the spirit we are trying to cultivate in <br/>
unschooling, and it really reminded me of PamS. list of unschooling <br/>
adjectives.<br/>

Unschooling is about finding the best in people.  So many methods of <br/>
teaching and parenting are too much about performance and compliance and <br/>
not about spirit.  The mechanistic idea of school as an assembly-line <br/>
and of children as widgets really underestimates what human beings are <br/>
capable of.  What were they thinking?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here we run into defintitions again but I consider myself unschooled <br/>
as a child even though I went to school.  My mom was the type who was <br/>
into learning and doing all kinds of stuff but she was incapable of <br/>
really taking care of us.  We were basically left to ourselves and I <br/>
hardly ever went to school.  The truancy laws were very lenient and <br/>
as long as I had a note from time to time from saying that I missed <br/>
school because I wasn&#39;t feeling well, they were happy.  I just spent <br/>
most of my time learning the things I wanted to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I stayed home from school, read (easily reading a book a day) and <br/>
played my cello.  I did poorly in all of my classes in high school <br/>
because I didn&#39;t show up or do any work but then aced the exams <br/>
because I *love* to read textbooks and had a vast general knowledge <br/>
anyway so they had to pass me.  I&#39;m also great with tests and haven&#39;t <br/>
met a multiple guess test that I couldn&#39;t beat.  I was never taught <br/>
to read.  I just learned how before I went to kindergarten.  My love <br/>
was foreign languages and I studied five of them in high school.  <br/>
<br/>
Basically, I did what I wanted and learned what I wanted.  That&#39;s why <br/>
I never had any serious doubts that unschooling works.<br/>

From what was quoted, the situation sounds a lot more complicated than just  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895084631">My point was not that medication is always the wrong way to go, but for me the last thing to try. I know that my thoughts sounded simplistic, but sometimes people go for the complicated first, and don&#39;t even try the most simple. You are right that medication saves lives sometimes, sometimes not. But, hearing just a part of the story of these boys shows me that perhaps what has perpetuated the anger has come from situations imposed on them, not organic mental illness. I believe that if someone had the inclination and time to give to these boys, maybe life could be turned around for them. I also know that people looking for attention can learn to use angry attention, if there is no loving attention to be had. A vicious cycle is started.<br/>

  and mental illness.  <br/>
<br/>
  From what was quoted, the situation sounds a lot more complicated than just  <br/>
  teenage angst.  Those kids have serious problems in their lives that have  <br/>
  affected them permanently.  Love alone seems simplistic and  insensitive.<br/>

I wasn&#39;t saying they were directly responsible for the drinking, (our addicitive genetics aside) but they were directly responsible for his crappy life.  FTR, his drinking problem began at age nine, so they get some blame for choosing to be willfully ignorant of his problems.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Love alone seems simplistic and  insensitive.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But a known lack of love is profound.<br/>
<br/>
Sticking with punishment and insult and trying to make up for it with <br/>
counsellors and medications is OVER productive.  They could roll back to a starting <br/>
place if they wanted to and there were people to help them do it.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing messed up families as models to avoid isn&#39;t a bad thing for people <br/>
whose children are still young and who are making decisions now about the <br/>
relationships they want to have with them.<br/>
<br/>
-=- It was all so  <br/>
counter-productive.  And in the years since, they&#39;ve wondered why he&#39;s  <br/>
developed such a <br/>
drinking problem....-=-<br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t know whether my kids have the potential to have drinking <br/>
problems.  Kirby was gone for six nights when he had only planned to be gone for <br/>
five, when he went to visit friends at college in another city.  I expressed <br/>
concern to Keith that maybe they were drinking and had gotten him involved in <br/>
that, and he had needed to sober up.  It just scared me that he was out of <br/>
contact for so long and didn&#39;t come home on schedule.  Keith wasn&#39;t worried, <br/>
because he has faith in Kirby&#39;s good judgment.  I was worried because in my <br/>
personal experience, alcohol (especially when combined with what seems to be genetic <br/>
alcoholism) quickly overcomes judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out there was no alcohol involved at all, just Halo 2 and the wisdom <br/>
not to start a four or five hour drive at midnight.<br/>
<br/>
But if we were the kinds of parents who harangued him, had strict rules and <br/>
curfews, would ground and punish and blame and accuse him, it would be silly <br/>
for me to additionally express surprise or exasperation if he did the worst <br/>
things he could do and blamed me.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when kids are being accused of doing something and punished for it, <br/>
they figure they might as well do it, as they&#39;ve already paid the price for <br/>
it and it must be valuable to cause that much uproar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673837483">It&#39;s both. Genetics and environment. They had a rough start with the  <br/>
bio-parents (who are both abusive addicts----dad&#39;s still in prison). Everyone  <br/>
thought they had it made going to a *stable* (read: controlling) home. Things  <br/>
probably WERE sweet for quite a few years----and certainly at first, although  the <br/>
boys had some odd behaviors that they brought with them. <br/>
 <br/>
They said they could pinpoint the time when he went off: the death of his  <br/>
great-grandmother----the only person who gave him unconditional love. His  <br/>
bio-mom was at the funeral, showing off her new husband and his two  <br/>
children---same ages, her &quot;new&quot; children. Devastating.<br/>
 <br/>
He also broke my friend&#39;s hand, so he&#39;s now become violent.<br/>
 <br/>
I asked my friend about meds. One of the docs thinks he&#39;s bi-polar  <br/>
(personally I feel he&#39;s just bi-miserable!), and I suggested that there&#39;s a  new med <br/>
out for bi-polar (My dad&#39;s a psychiatrist who was just out in &#39;Vegas  last <br/>
weekend for the launch of a new bi-polar drug.) with fewer side effects.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t want him to be a zombie. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
They really and truly think that clamping down and clamping down HARD will  <br/>
cure this.<br/>
 <br/>
I *know* he has only one of two futures: early prison or early  suicide.<br/>
 <br/>
Breaks my heart.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll be visiting soon. Maybe we can spend some time together. <br/>

<br/>
I happen to know this to be a fact.  When my husband&#39;s brother was growing<br/>
up he loved to hang with friends.  He would camp out or maybe stay out later<br/>
than the curfew.  My FIL started accusing him of drinking and doing drugs.<br/>
My dh remembers the day his brother said..&quot;If they are going to accuse me, I<br/>
might as well do it..&quot;  He did and turned out to have a life trail of<br/>
drinking and drugs.  His wife just said the other day that they buy liquor<br/>
by the case not the bottle.  It is very sad to me.  I do blame my in-laws.<br/>
They have never stopped accusing and belittling.  Unless a person has<br/>
someone cross his or her path and help encourage a different direction the<br/>
outcome can be tragic.  I am eternally grateful for the people who have been<br/>
in my path.  I wouldn&#39;t be where I am today without them.  And let me<br/>
add...I do believe at some point in our lives we have to move past the blame<br/>
and take control of our own lives.  I had to get to that place in my life.<br/>
However, I am back to having to have someone to encourage you in the right<br/>
direction.  You can&#39;t always find it alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849888773">**It makes  me so mad when people don&#39;t understand that anger in teens can<br/>
  often be  depression, that anger can often be grieving -- how about lots<br/>
and lots<br/>
  of  love. I know when you mention this to people if they listen, their<br/>
first<br/>
  reaction is to go with meds -- but, I know first hand it does not need<br/>
  medication. **<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to add that medication doesn&#39;t have to be a forever<br/>
remedy.  I think there are times one needs the medication to be able to work<br/>
through issues.  If the person isn&#39;t sleeping well or can&#39;t concentrate it<br/>
is hard to work through hard issues or to  be able to get to a place to say<br/>
I am ready to move past this.  I have seen friends who went on meds for a<br/>
year just to get over the hump. It helps the sleep pattern and so on..<br/>
