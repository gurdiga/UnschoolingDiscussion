 </span></blockquote>Dear Tia,<br/>
<br/>
You might not want it to be about &quot;ownership,&quot; but that is what the<br/>
government has turned it into.<br/>
<br/>
When a state can make you pay a fine for not sending your child to a school,<br/>
then the assumption that the state makes is that IT owns your child, and it<br/>
can force you to pay a fine for keeping possession of him/her. In other<br/>
words, to repeat, by paying such a fine, you are renting your child from the<br/>
child&#39;s true owner -- the school/state.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you understand how outrageous that situation is.....<br/>
<br/>
States have been known to take this idea to its extreme, by forcibly<br/>
removing children from their parents for refusing to send them to its<br/>
school. In Utah, a father was shot by police for that &quot;crime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tell us, Tia, if that is not an &quot;ownership&quot; issue. What part of that logic<br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; for you?<br/>
<br/>
Parents usually don&#39;t consider themselves &quot;owners&quot; of their children, but<br/>
until the children reach a certain maturity, parents acknowledge their<br/>
responsibilities regarding those children, and the responsibilities resemble<br/>
those of &quot;ownership.&quot;  Not long ago in this country, and still in some<br/>
cultures, men were/are considered the owners of their wives, and rulers were<br/>
considered the owners of all the people.<br/>
<br/>
It starts with the concept of self-ownership. Who owns me?  Does anyone<br/>
(other than myself) have a right to my life? Personally, I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
Does anyone, or any institution, have a right to my child&#39;s life? Same<br/>
answer. Can anyone or any institution make it a crime for me not to give my<br/>
child to them? <br/>
<br/>
Speeding puts other people at risk. Shop lifting (stealing) violates the<br/>
rights of other people. They are considered crimes. For the state to<br/>
consider it a crime to keep a child at home is the outrage I&#39;m talking<br/>
about.     and keep your &quot;mind you&#39;s&quot; to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Ned Vare<br/>
do we have children so that we can give them to the government to raise for<br/>
us, badly?</div>

Ned, I no longer have faith in your reporting.  Please withdraw this claim or <br/>
give us documentation from an objective source, if possible, and not a <br/>
libertarian scare-sermon.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that police went up to a man and shot him because his children were <br/>
out of school.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one assumption you could make.  It isn&#39;t the one I would make.  The <br/>
majority of the population truly believes that 1.  What the schools do is <br/>
education.  And 2.  That the public at large has a strong interest in <br/>
making sure that the populace is educated.  I personally disagree <br/>
completely with number 1, and I disagree with the way the government goes <br/>
about number 2.  What I don&#39;t believe is that the government makes the <br/>
assumption (if a government *can* make an assumption) that it owns my child.<br/>
<br/>

provinces put a lot of hurdles out there for homeschoolers, but none are <br/>
making homeschooling illegal like it is in many European countries.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay I have tried Googling this to get you better information, but I <br/>
couldn&#39;t find any of what I was looking for. Here&#39;s what I do know though. <br/>
Some of my details may be way off.<br/>
<br/>
There *was* a standoff and shootout at a Utah home in the 1970&#39;s. It  <br/>
happened in a town called Kamas, which is very close to my home. I do not <br/>
remember for sure if the Dad was killed or not. The children *were* being <br/>
homeschooled, but that alone was not the issue. It was a polygamist family <br/>
and there were charges of child abuse. The kids were not in school, but they <br/>
were sent off to work in the family construction business at age 10, or <br/>
married off (if a female) at about 13 or 14. The family thought the state <br/>
should have no right to say how they raised their children and armed <br/>
themselves to fight home visits. The issues were much more about the <br/>
problems with polygamist lifestyles, than homeschooling itself.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
told though, that Utah now has it&#39;s liberal homeschooling policy because of <br/>
this incident.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I doubt that police went up to a man and shot him because his children <br/>
&gt;&gt;were out of school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do believe it was much more involved than this.<br/>
