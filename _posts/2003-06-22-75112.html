<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281522202">Hello All Dear E-mail Friends,<br/>
 <br/>
This fall my children and I are walking in the Alzheimer&#39;s Memory <br/>
Walk in Honor of my Grandfather (their Great-Grandfather). <br/>
Why are we doing this? Our dear papa has Alzheimer&#39;s (has had it for <br/>
a number of years), and we have learned first hand just how de-<br/>
moralizing, de-meaning and horrible, horrible this disease is!!<br/>
 <br/>
Will your children remember you?  Will they remember all the fun <br/>
things you did together? If your parent (s) gets this disease they <br/>
may not!  My Grandfather was an awesome man! (Still is) I love him so <br/>
dearly, he taught me so many things! He is still teaching me, <br/>
teaching me patience, more love than I ever thought I would feel, and <br/>
he taught me to fish : ) <br/>
 <br/>
I am sending this to all on my e-mail list, so if your are not close <br/>
enough to walk, then maybe you will send a donation, it&#39;s money to <br/>
find a cure! If you are close consider walking with us, send me an <br/>
email and I will give you send more info! If you wish to donate you <br/>
can send a check to :<br/>
 <br/>
KCE Academy <br/>
259 Mt. Auburn<br/>
Dunkirk, IN<br/>
47336<br/>
 <br/>
Please make all checks out to Alzheimer&#39;s Association and date it for <br/>
Sept. 1 2003<br/>
 <br/>
I thank you all so kindly and wish upon wish that you may never <br/>
suffer this disease with any one you know and love!<br/>
 <br/>
Tami Labig-Duquette<br/>
P.s. Please let me know either way what you do, It&#39;s ok not to <br/>
donate, knowing we have you wishes and luck is GREAT!<br/>
 <br/>

wounds, runs out and will tell&quot;<br/>
