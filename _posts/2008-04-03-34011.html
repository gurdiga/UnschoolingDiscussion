<div id="ygrps-yiv-454747886">I LOVE Diana Gabaldon&#39;s book series Outlander. There are 6 or 7 so far. the first book is &quot;Outlander&quot; and it sucked me in so fast I stayed up all night long to finish it (this was many years ago, before kids!)<br/>
<br/>
Its historical fiction, but really defies genre, its fiction, litearature, romance, time travel.....mystery....and funny, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103685659">Yes, I loved these books.  My sister recommended them -- and finally sent me one.  They&#39;re a little more risque than I normally read, but I got sucked in, too.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s at least a 7th one coming soon, and maybe an 8th?<br/>
