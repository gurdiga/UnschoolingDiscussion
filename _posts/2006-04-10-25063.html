<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182318232">I don&#39;t drink but my kids have had wine or lite beer at mealtimes for ages. At Hesfes Heather (13 then) certainly drank to try it out and she tried grass. She said she liked the alcopops, didn&#39;t like grass and thought people behaved stupidly when drunk.<br/>
  I think if I&#39;d been less open she wouldn&#39;t have told me and experimented in secret which is way more worrying than having some in someone&#39;s tent and then coming to tell me her experiences.<br/>
  We&#39;ve sat down and talked about how alcohol ruins your judgement and she&#39;s seen first hand how the boys plied it on the girls. She&#39;s also experienced being called a &#39;sissy&#39; when she didn&#39;t want any and was able to deal with that.<br/>
  I guess we&#39;re lucky that Hesfes (and other HE camps) gives teens a very safe environment to try stuff. She likes to try some drinks with her friends.<br/>
  While i don&#39;t like alcohol and wish no-one ever drank, I don&#39;t own her or her body so its up to her what she does. But we do talk about safe situations.<br/>
  This year at Hesfes she&#39;ll be 14 so now I&#39;m wowrrying about boys and condoms! We&#39;ve talked about sex and alcohol, safety and only doing when you want too, not cos someone has pressurised you into doing it (and HE boys are like males anywhere. If they can, they will!).<br/>
  She&#39;ll experiment but I hope she can always talk it tthrough with me and share anything thats bugging her.<br/>

<br/>
This is such an interesting thing to think about, especially for me with a young child (6). Over here in Australia the legal age is 18 - I really feel like 21 pushes the limit. I can&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so old in the US. Under age drinking is a huge problem over here too. I tend to think that a lot of these problems stem from disconnectedness (spelling??) within families. Teens feel the need to rebel against rules, groundings, punishments etc.<br/>
<br/>
I feel, like you Patti, that when/if Lewi shows an interest in alcohol them it&#39;ll certainly be something we discuss openly and with much understanding. I think at 15 or 16, if kids want to share in wine or beer (the moderation thing) then surely it&#39;s a way of them learning about alcohol and taking away the focus of binge drinking. I guess it&#39;s a bit like the TV, the less restrictions the less desire (for some at least). <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, it&#39;s certainly got me thinking anyway. I can&#39;t wait to hear what others have to say about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I grew up with sips of beer and wine and mixed drinks from my  <br/>
parents. My sister and I could have a little bit of brandy when we  <br/>
came in from skiing in the bitter cold. (I&#39;m sure we could have had  <br/>
it more often, but when it wasn&#39;t bitter cold we were warm enough by  <br/>
the time we got upstairs that we didn&#39;t need any help warming up.) My  <br/>
aunt used to make these very strong alcoholic drinks for weekly  <br/>
dinner at my grandmother&#39;s, and sometimes we&#39;d have wine. I rarely  <br/>
finished either but I drank some.<br/>
<br/>
Alcohol didn&#39;t hold any mysteries for me. It wasn&#39;t some rite of  <br/>
passage to adulthood. And that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done with Kathryn (now 14).<br/>
<br/>
Since she can have alcohol, she judges what she wants to drink by how  <br/>
it tastes and not what it represents. Though she occasionally will  <br/>
drink some wine, I suspect on her list of drinks it&#39;s fairly far down  <br/>
the list of favorites.<br/>
<br/>
She knows the affects of alcohol. We&#39;ve discussed that as it&#39;s come up.<br/>

alcohol, including scotch!, since she was little. Now that she&#39;s 16,  <br/>
she likes to pour a tiny espresso cup of wine for herself sometimes  <br/>
with dinner. At the same time, she has seen some people she knows get  <br/>
really drunk and she is disdanful of that. Also, two of her  <br/>
grandparents are/were extreme alcoholics, so of course, we&#39;ve talked  <br/>
a lot about that.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to talk about drugs in a global way - that  <br/>
many things are drugs, coffee, aspirin, crack, pot, and they all have  <br/>
really different effects on humans. And I agree that the whole  <br/>
forbidden aspect must lead to some of today&#39;s bingeing.<br/>
