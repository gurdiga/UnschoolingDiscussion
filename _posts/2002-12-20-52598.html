<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667404789">What about the idea that your blood concentrates in the stomach, etc., <br/>
while you&#39;re digesting, and swiming (or doing any type of exercise) <br/>
takes away from the digestive process, since blood goes to the the <br/>
muscles instead?<br/>
Of course, that also happens when you eat in a rush, go back to work or <br/>
whatever, and start working right away (blood goes to the brain, etc.) <br/>
and everyone seems to think that&#39;s fine. I am not questioning the <br/>
control issue in the swimming example, though. I actually think that <br/>
adults should be more careful about swimming afer eating than kids. Kids <br/>
can burn food at a higher, faster rate (unless they have a slow <br/>
metabolism, of course, and the tendency to gain weight).<br/>

&gt;Sandra, I think that is probably pretty on target.   It was a way to get kids <br/>
&gt;to &quot;take a break&quot;  for the adults convenience<br/>
