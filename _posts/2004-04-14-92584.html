<div id="ygrps-yiv-257742931">I think it&#39;s perfectly possible and reasonable to write the story of a <br/>
child&#39;s learning for different reasons using all kinds of different formats, <br/>
*including* a traditional academic transcript with or without letter grades. <br/>
<br/>
       The form alone does not a liar OR a scholar make. <br/>
<br/>
       It could be really helpful to unschoolers to talk about this here, in <br/>
a bunch of ways. But moralizing about it doesn&#39;t strike me as one of them.<br/>
<br/>
       I can respect different points of view about why a family might choose <br/>
this or that for themselves, including a parent&#39;s view that for HER family it <br/>
would be dishonest, just as it might be a matter of conscience not to <br/>
register or to submit annual evalautions to the school system. <br/>
<br/>
       But this can be carried past that point of personal conscience and <br/>
become moralizing against parents who see it differently, as has happened with <br/>
charter schooling and virtual schooling.<br/>
<br/>
      When it&#39;s suggested that moms just take their kids&#39; tests and do their <br/>
homework for them, to keep school off their backs, we didn&#39;t see moralizing <br/>
about dishonesty and lies and complete fabrications. Thank goodness! <br/>
<br/>
        Let&#39;s talk about authentic assessments and the realities of <br/>
transcripts and the Power of Story in different approaches, I&#39;m all for it. Let&#39;s just <br/>
do it without anyone calling anyone else a liar.  JJ<br/>

Well damn.  Are you moralizing about my lack of morals or my abundance?  <br/>

you think might be deemed immoral about about your, um, abundance! &lt;g&gt;   JJ<br/>

<br/>
It seemed you were criticizing people for suggesting they were more moral <br/>
than others.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure being truthful is considered more moral than being dishonest <br/>
in all cultures, with a few exceptions for saving a life perhaps.  So if you <br/>
think it&#39;s bad for a person to say &quot;you&#39;re lying, and I wouldn&#39;t,&quot; then maybe <br/>
the proposal is to state or pretend that lying is no worse or better, but is <br/>
the same (ethically, philosophically) as telling the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with that argument.  The people who will agree with it should <br/>
neither be loaned money nor your carkeys.<br/>
