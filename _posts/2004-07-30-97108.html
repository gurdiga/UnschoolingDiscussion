My latest affirmation is &quot;peace is powerful, breathe&quot;. My son is a <br/>
barometer of me. When I am tense, worried, aggitated, hungary, tired, <br/>
etc. he keys up a notch and starts clinging, whining, or seeking to <br/>
distract me from whatever he perceives to be bothering mama. He is so <br/>
perceptive of my emotions, more so than I am even, that he is a <br/>
little mirror for me to learn about myself. He is so acutely in tune <br/>
with me that it is very unsettling for him when I am unsettled, even <br/>
a little bit. I am amazed at his ability to read me. He is <br/>
NOT &quot;acting out&quot;; he is calling out for the calm mama. He will even <br/>
start saying &quot;little baby needs his mama&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, I realized that my peace is powerful to our calmness as a family. <br/>
I know that his reactions are a cue to recenter myself. As he has <br/>
grown older, he uses his words more to show me myself. When he was <br/>
younger, he used his actions too: hitting, grabbing, even biting a <br/>
few times. I have learned that these are his calls for help to <br/>
resettle our home. He wants a happy home as much as I do. But I do <br/>
have much more ability to break the cycle of harmony and disharmony <br/>
as the adult.<br/>
<br/>
So, I will stop, kneel down to his level, hold or hug him and <br/>
whisper. Then he knows I am calmer, he is able to rely on me to help <br/>
him and he can move on. It is very disturbing to have the mama out of <br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
I am learning not to be a type A, it doesn&#39;t work well for us as a <br/>
family. Mama needs to be peace for the family to be peaceful.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I hear this voice in my head, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?  Breathe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How can this be so hard?&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have a history that could use a more particular slant, you <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; probably find it by google (if you had an alcoholic parent, or some <br/>
kind of past <br/>
&gt; problems or recovery needs), but to replace the voices in your <br/>
head, you just need <br/>
&gt; more soothing, helpful voices.<br/>

&gt; I can&#39;t find any particularly parent-of-toddler stuff.  Do others <br/>
here know <br/>
&gt; of some?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reading Anne Ohman&#39;s writing can be really inspiring and calming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s some here:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/anneohman">http://sandradodd.com/anneohman</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and she posts at www.unschooling.com<br/>
&gt; message boards<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reading the typical days might be helpful too:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I&#39;m finding on the internet is too specific or not about <br/>
kids...<br/>
&gt; There might be books.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We could brainstorm you some affirmations!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How about...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Make this moment a little better.<br/>
&gt; Breathe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Others can think of better things I bet!<br/>
