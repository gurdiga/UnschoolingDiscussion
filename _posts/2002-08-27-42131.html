&gt; truancy fines<br/>
&gt; yes, they are talking about introducing them here too.<br/>
&gt; ALso about taking possession of children who &quot;truant&quot;,<br/>
&gt; this is a problem here because in many states it is<br/>
&gt; hard to get permission to homeschool, therefore your<br/>
&gt; child can be deemed to be truanting.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Forget the cheese, let&#39;s get out of this trap&quot; a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is not an invitation for a political rant against schools and government.<br/>
It could lead to a discussion of specific ways other people have handled the<br/>
situation themselves, pointers to other sources of information and better<br/>
forums to discuss the specifics of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t get detailed because it can&#39;t on this international list which<br/>
serves the purpose of helping people gets started with unschooling. The<br/>
problem, if she chooses to tackle it, is way too big to handle here, and way<br/>
too specific to be of use to those who are looking for ways to help their<br/>
kids.<br/>
