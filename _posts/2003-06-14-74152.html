<div id="ygrps-yiv-79620811">&quot;Isn&#39;t that enough or are we being selfish? Any thoughts? Sandra, what&#39;s your <br/>
thoughts?<br/>
How can we handle this without leaving on bad terms? There I go with the word <br/>
bad, you know what I mean. Christopher doesn&#39;t want to loose the wonderful <br/>
relationship he has with his grandparents but they won&#39;t talk to him either and<br/>
 <br/>
he&#39;s in tears. I&#39;m so angry that they are acting like this! Okay, I&#39;m going to<br/>
 <br/>
breath now. Thank-you to anyone that can pass some wisdom to us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called emotional blackmail. They are not healthy, happy people...why would you let them dictate your lives?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading Barbara Sher&#39;s &quot;Wishcraft&quot; and she talks about households that produce winners. She makes a point that winners are happy to see others acheiving their life goals, they enjoy seeing others succeed and applaud them.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re surrounded by winners right now.<br/>
<br/>
You are responsible for the happiness of yourself, your dh and son right now. Do what is right for you. It&#39;s not like you haven&#39;t held op3en the door for a good relationship with them, you aren&#39;t cutting yourselves off in any way!! THEY are.<br/>
You are not responsible for them any longer. You will  write, visit etc...that&#39;s all you can do. Their anger and fear is not your problem.<br/>
Don&#39;t carry their garbage around with you.<br/>
