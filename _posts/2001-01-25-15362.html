I am not afraid of disagreements, or anyone expressing their opinion, but <br/>
when it starts to be accompanied by things like&quot;I&#39;m not  going  to deny my <br/>
religion for any one&quot;, which sounds defensive, or fails to aknowledge that <br/>
this is just one person&#39;s belief or opinion, which is offensive it often <br/>
leads to nastiness. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Who is asking for agreement? I just shared something I heard and choose to<br/>
 believe and someone disagreed/reacted. I wasn&#39;t asking for anyone to agree<br/>
 with me. <br/>

    It&#39;s interesting that you responded to me this way. I don&#39;t think of <br/>
myself as being afraid of disagreement, but maybe there&#39;s an element of that <br/>
in me, so thanks. It just seems to me that religious beliefs are very <br/>
personal and often not connected to logic, mine included, and people often <br/>
feel very strongly about them. So I guess I was concerned that we not get too <br/>
caught up in this thread. On the other hand, if we can debate without <br/>
alienating each other that&#39;s great.<br/>
    We are members of a Hindu satsang and followers of a living woman saint <br/>
from India. Of all the hs groups that are available to us in the SF Bay area <br/>
where we live, 10 minutes from Berkeley, my youngest daughter, age 11, has <br/>
chosen the mostly fundamentalist Christian one. She likes the classes they <br/>
teach and the spiritual focus and is taking anatomy and English this <br/>
semester. Last year in the spring when we joined, I kept my mouth shut about <br/>
my religious differences. Since then, however, I found out that my friend <br/>
who&#39;s in the group had already told them. So they know and we are accepted <br/>
and left alone. This is really good for me to be able to work with people who <br/>
are so different. I feel that my daughter is learning about people. In some <br/>
ways we are very much like these folks and in some ways we are very <br/>
different. I wish I could have more discussions with them but mostly we seem <br/>
to maintain a respectful silence. -Amalia-</div>
