&gt; Thank you, Pam, I will get the book.  I have considered purchasing<br/>
&gt; the book before, but not sure why I didn&#39;t follow through.  Thank you<br/>
&gt; for your kind, supportive post.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My library has that one.  Maybe yours does.  Then you can see whether it&#39;s<br/>
going to help before shelling out the money.<br/>

ps My daughter found it really helpful with her daughter. </span></blockquote></div>
