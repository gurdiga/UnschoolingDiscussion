I think some of us are looking back on the guys we were with at 17 that<br/>
we thought we would love *forever* but it only lasted 6 months.  Knowing<br/>
what you need from a relationship and picking the right guy the first<br/>
time seems unlikely, to me.  Lots of women that I know seem to need to<br/>
work through their &quot;daddy issues&quot; in their first couple of<br/>
relationships.  They want to re-enact their daddy relationship and &quot;make<br/>
him love them&quot; this time.  Many people get through this and figure out<br/>
that they *don&#39;t* want a guy like dear dad after all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, let&#39;s talk reality here. We don&#39;t have &quot;villages&quot; anymore to help <br/>
support a young woman taking care of her young baby or the kind of <br/>
village that makes sure the baby is cared for if the mother proves <br/>
incompetent. A lucky few young teen girls are sane enough and lucky <br/>
enough to choose a stable partner who can help give them the support and <br/>
resources they need to parent in ways that a young baby needs and <br/>
deserves; statistically this is a very small percent of total teen <br/>
pregnancies. What happens to the rest? The young partner takes off and <br/>
leaves the young girl to scramble for resources for herself. Society <br/>
shames her and her child for their &quot;failure&quot;. And then comes along <br/>
another &quot;biological&quot; truth: the stepfather.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure there are many, many wonderful adoptive fathers out there, <br/>
but again real life statistics show that stepfather relationships are <br/>
much more likely to be problematic that biological ones. Consider this <br/>
quote from _Protecting the Gift_ by Gavin De Becker :<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Given that a male in any species is highly motivated to promote his <br/>
genetic legacy (and only his), violence in step-relationships is <br/>
predictable. Among many animals, males routinely kill offspring that not <br/>
theirs. Richard Wrangham explains: &quot;The issue is confused with humans <br/>
because society expects a stepfather to accept a parental role with his <br/>
spouse&#39;s children, even though he evolutionarily he is a rival to the <br/>
previous father.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t something that we usually take a good, hard, honest look at <br/>
in our society but I am sure it is something that welfare workers, <br/>
emergency medical personal, and police are all too aware of.<br/>

I think the feminist message is that of choice. If a woman chooses to be a wife and mother - fine - as long as it&#39;s her choice, a choice she makes not a choice that is forced upon her.<br/>

married young and have a child?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just look at it like the person has such a long life (generally) ahead of<br/>
them, why start so much responsibility so soon? And having a family is a lot<br/>
of responsibility. And I think harder than it used to be. Less of a village<br/>
format in that a lot of people don&#39;t even have extended families around let<br/>
alone really good friends. I think there&#39;s a lot more pressure nowadays in<br/>
raising kids too. Just with what we are doing to the earth let alone each<br/>
other. I know many people shouldn&#39;t be having a family when they are 30 and<br/>
some 20 year olds that do quite well. Divorce is up and chances of staying<br/>
with the same person you had a baby with at 18 when you are 30 are slim. Not<br/>
that it&#39;s a bad thing for everyone, but another hardship to get over.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if we lived to be 35, having babies at 16 would make more sense to me.<br/>

<br/>
 How many people my age are going to have 50th wedding anniversaries? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hey! My dh and I started dating when we were 16. And the day I met him<br/>
(which was about a week before we &quot;officially&quot; started dating) I knew there<br/>
was &quot;something&quot; about the guy. Some people would call it &quot;love at first<br/>
sight&quot; but to me it was like we&#39;d been together before (like in another<br/>
lifetime) and found each other again. Got married at 24 (would have been a<br/>
lot sooner if I had my way but my parents were adamant we had to &quot;wait until<br/>
we finished school&quot; -and that wasn&#39;t even high school they were talking<br/>
about but university!!)  Of course,we could&#39;ve just eloped but I know I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have been forgiven for that very easily.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, still happily married at 32 with 2 kids (well, most days anyway<br/>
&lt;g&gt;). And we have this standing joke about celebrating our 75th wedding<br/>
anniversary (we&#39;d both be 99 - hey you never know!). Every year on our<br/>
wedding anniversary, we&#39;ll say, hey only 68 years (or whatever number is<br/>
appropriate that year) to go! You know, the best part is, I really would<br/>
love for us to have that many years together -we&#39;ve already been together<br/>
half our lives and we&#39;ve both grown and changed so much but somehow we&#39;ve<br/>
been growing in the same direction - kinda cool, it doesn&#39;t always work that<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is, choosing young doesn&#39;t always mean choosing wrong!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That makes sense, actually. If we only lived to 35, it would make <br/>
sense to start having babies earlier. But I think there never really <br/>
has been a time when &quot;we&quot; have only lived that long. The average <br/>
human life span may have been 35ish, but you gotta remember, infant <br/>
mortality was much higher back then, and if you average in life spans <br/>
of 2 months and 5 years and 1 1/2 years, that&#39;s going to take the <br/>
average down.<br/>
<br/>
However, even back then, if a person lived past age 5, and didn&#39;t die <br/>
accidentally, his chances of living into his seventh decade were <br/>
pretty good. <br/>

<br/>
So True. <br/>
I guess that is what i was trying to get across in the post. Sorta <br/>
knowing how to love and accept yourself before you know how to love <br/>
someone else. <br/>
<br/>
I KNOW am very protective of my daughters, but I also know one day, <br/>
maybe sooner then later, they will have choices they alone can make.  <br/>
A healthy state of mind and good self esteem is something they need <br/>
to help them weigh things out for themselves. <br/>
Guilt, low self esteem and such don&#39;t do much to help ANY <br/>
relationship thrive. And most times is a sure bet to attract the <br/>
wrong kind of partner.<br/>
<br/>
I think many girls {most likely not many daughters who unschool} are <br/>
raised to a certin sterotypes or with little communication other <br/>
then &quot;Don&#39;t have sex or else this might happen&quot; from their mom. And <br/>
some Moms just don&#39;t talk to their daughters because they themselves <br/>
are very uncomfortable and can&#39;t seem to find the right time.....<br/>

<br/>
I can personally tell you that this is soooo true.  I lost my mother<br/>
when I was 16 and, to everyone around me, seemed to be handly the<br/>
situtation very well.  I moved in with my grandmother (my father split<br/>
and moved out of state -he later died when I was 19).  This was WAY<br/>
TOO much for someone of my age and experience to deal with.  I fell<br/>
into a deep depresstion that lasted for years.  <br/>
<br/>
During these years, I met, &quot;fell in love with,&quot; and moved in with a<br/>
(no other way to say this) loser.  We were together for 4 years and in<br/>
all that time I think he worked less than a year total.  I supported<br/>
us and, in my spare time, drank myself to sleep every night.  He never<br/>
spoke kindly to me.  Although he never actually hit me, the verbal<br/>
abuse was intense.  I also gained about 80 lbs during this time.<br/>
<br/>
When I FINALLY woke up to my life and realized that I needed to get<br/>
out, my life changed completely.  I moved back in with grandma for<br/>
about 6 months while I worked on crawling out of the hole that I had<br/>
dug myself into.  I re-gained my self esteem and came out of the<br/>
depression and boy what a difference that all made.  I am now married<br/>
to a wonderful man and we have a beautiful baby girl (just turned 2).<br/>
 I have the dream that I always wanted....to be married to a great guy<br/>
and be able to stay at home with my child.  Now I&#39;m adding to that<br/>
dream unschooling and life is wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Self esteem and belief in oneself is a remarkable thing.<br/>

We have a strong basis of communication and she discusses her feelings and<br/>
urges with me.  At this tender age she has already been dumped by a<br/>
boyfriend because he wanted sex.  She was amazed that he could be so short<br/>
sighted and driven by his hormones.  She decided that &quot;boyfriends&quot; were a<br/>
mistake at her age, it implied way too much involvement than she is ready<br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
I know a couple that married at the ages of 18 and 19.  They both were<br/>
mature and knew what they wanted from life.  They had a strong family<br/>
support and it was fun to watch them spend all of that youthful energy<br/>
together.  It seemed much more natural to me and they&#39;ll still be young when<br/>
their nest is empty with more time to enjoy having adult children.<br/>

and they&#39;re doing fantastic. Their oldest son married at 18, and he&#39;s <br/>
doing great, too. And another friend who has stuck it out with her <br/>
hubby for years, married quite young. He, 18, and she 19. But I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want her marriage. Her husband must have some redeeming <br/>
qualities, though I&#39;ve never seen them in public! either that, or <br/>
she&#39;s a saint for patience and forebearance. The latter, is my guess.<br/>
<br/>
so, if my girl decides to follow through on her lifelong dream of <br/>
marrying when she is 19 (which gives my mom and sister hives), I&#39;m <br/>
all behind her. Wish my female relatives wouldn&#39;t slap down those <br/>
dreams, though. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not entirely sure that&#39;s the case--at least that wasn&#39;t the rationale I<br/>
was given from my own family. My mom didn&#39;t have me until 25, and my dad was<br/>
32. Her mom was 30 when she started having kids, so I come from a line of<br/>
relatively old mothers (especially for back then). My mom told me she<br/>
thought it was a great idea to get a little of my own life under my belt<br/>
before having kids, and a good idea to wait until age 25 or so. I think it<br/>
was good advice (for me at least). I&#39;m always grateful that I got to have a<br/>
whole bunch of different experiences, traveling, dating a wide variety of<br/>
people, etc. before I met my DH. When I met him, I knew how good he was, and<br/>
I knew he was the one &quot;keeper&quot; I&#39;d met. So it took us about 2 weeks to<br/>
figure out we wanted to get married and have kids (though we did some<br/>
traveling and stuff together first). I&#39;m glad I had these experiences<br/>
because I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m waiting for my kids to grow up so that my<br/>
&quot;life&quot; can start. There&#39;s nothing I&#39;m missing out on, I know the value of<br/>
what I have (though I&#39;m not saying all younger mothers are itching to get<br/>
away from motherhood, this is just my experience).<br/>
DH&#39;s family on the other hand has a new generation about every 16 or 17<br/>
years, and I can see the toll that it takes on the children who are being<br/>
raised by kids who are too immature to be able to devote themselves to being<br/>
parents. I&#39;ll never forget his niece leaving her 3 week old baby overnight<br/>
so she could go and party in a town where the drinking age was low enough<br/>
that she could get in to bars. These kids just aren&#39;t done growing up, and<br/>
they&#39;re not able to care for the babies that they have. In so many cases<br/>
these days, the grandparents end up raising the kids, it&#39;s a huge<br/>
phenomenon.<br/>
I think there&#39;s a big difference between a 17 year old in a tribal village<br/>
having a baby and having the support of her family and village; and kids in<br/>
our society who are just entering into a stage of rebelling against school,<br/>
life, all the controls in their lives, and using their own reproductive<br/>
capability as part of that rebellion.<br/>

Happy anniversary!<br/>
<br/>
Nice story, and thanks for telling it.<br/>
<br/>
We have a harder time counting our beginning dates, Keith and I, but we&#39;ve <br/>
had a totally legitimate 19th (real wedding) anniversary and there are six years <br/>
before that we were together which are harder to sort and pinpoint.   We know <br/>
two other couple just slightly older than we are  who have been together for <br/>
over 25 years.  One couple never married, one married bigtime, formal Polish <br/>
Catholic wedding in Chicago.  In each couple, sadly, one of the partners has a <br/>
serious-to-terminal condition, so they won&#39;t make 50.  <br/>
<br/>
In the early 70&#39;s society made it easy to leave relationships and marriages.  <br/>
Support was for &quot;screw it, it&#39;s not important; he looked at you funny?  <br/>
Leave!&quot;  I think 80&#39;s marriages had a better chance at success, just generally.  <br/>
The climate wasn&#39;t so wild and &quot;Let&#39;s mess with tradition and Society just <br/>
because it&#39;s Friday night.&quot;<br/>

Seemed like many of us marrying in the 80s had been products of 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s <br/>
thinking parents, broken homes, self-centeredness, and the pendulum began to <br/>
swing back cause we were tired of it.  My parents split right after we were <br/>
married, but they had almost split a couple of times before while I was growing <br/>
up.  My mom, not my dad, had a midlife crisis. <br/>
