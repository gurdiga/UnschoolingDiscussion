<div id="ygrps-yiv-436683851">What are some opinions about the probability of many<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of these children having been misdiagnosed, medicated without need,<br/>
&gt;possibly having emotional issues stemming from foster care or previous<br/>
&gt;problems that &quot;look&quot; like ADD symptoms, etc.??  How difficult is it to take<br/>
&gt;a child off medication?  How would you assess the true nature of a child&#39;s<br/>
&gt;condition, abilities and needs when they are already on medication?  How do<br/>
&gt;you approach this issue in a way that is healthy and non-threatening to the<br/>
&gt;child?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having adopted five children from the foster care system, I can tell you<br/>
that the termoil and upheavel in the child&#39;s life during their time in the<br/>
system is enough to make them ADHD!  They spend so much of their young lives<br/>
worried about where they are going to be next, who will care for them, why<br/>
they can&#39;t be with their birth family, that they have no time or energy to<br/>
focus on learning, and paying attention to what is really happening at that<br/>
time.  They are then diagnosed and medicated (much easier on overworked<br/>
fosterparent). Having been a foster parent to many of these children I tell<br/>
you how overworked and under supported these people really are.  Even though<br/>
3 of mine were so young at the time of their adoptions that they had no<br/>
diagnosis placed on them, that as they enetered public school and began to<br/>
deal with the issues of their placements with us they experienced the same<br/>
energy draining and difficulty focusing on current life.  And yes they were<br/>
medicated as part of a larger program of treatment that included therapy,<br/>
and changes in parenting styles to help them learn better coping skills.<br/>
Two have been able to use this as the learning tool it was meant to be and<br/>
are no longer on meds.  The other has more extensive problems and is no<br/>
longer on meds for ADHD but is still on mood altering meds.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Should I avoid children who are being medicated as a matter of course?<br/>
&gt;Would the situation be too sticky to embroil ourselves in if there is<br/>
&gt;psychological drugs present? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you object to drugs across the board?  Could you use them as the help to<br/>
transition a child and give the child the help to learn new coping skills,<br/>
and give them the space to work thru their issues with your love and<br/>
support.  Then they can often be dropped down the road as the child settles<br/>
in.  If you can&#39;t see the use of the meds in this light, then bringing a<br/>
child currently on meds into your home might not work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Anyone have any info to share?  Anyone also<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;have any leads or suggestions of areas/agencies for us to check into for kids?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is an organization in Rochester New York Children Awaiting Parents<br/>
(CAP) that has a photo listing service of children across the country that<br/>
need families.  You can subscribe to their listing book  (716-232-5110).<br/>
They also have a website that lists the children.  There are several such<br/>
websites.  The Rocky Mountain photo exchange also has a website.  Also check<br/>
with your state adoption supervisor about mailings that list children in<br/>
your state--even though your social worker may receive this mailing-you may<br/>
spot a child that just seems like a good match that the worker would miss<br/>
(happened 2X for us.)<br/>
<br/>
I would also recommend contacting Adoptive Families of America -can&#39;t find<br/>
their phone number right now.  They are located in the Twin Cities area and<br/>
do have a website and toll free number. This organization has a great<br/>
magazine just for adoptive parents covering all kinds of situations.  Also<br/>
contact North American Council on Adoptable Children (612-644-3036).This<br/>
organization can put in contact with a lot of the listing agencies.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck Nanci.  This is a very different road on the parenting highway but<br/>
very well worth the time and energy. If you want to e-mail me privately for<br/>
more info, please feel free to.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
