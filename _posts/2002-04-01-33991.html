P.S.  Sheldon Jackson in Sitka is the one he has applied to.  He wants to do<br/>
2 years there and then transfer to a university in Scotland.<br/>

P.S. #2  We were thinking of something along the lines of what the lamp lady<br/>
does with lots of hot pink and lavendar with maybe some yellow ribbons &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Son #2 is applying to a college in Alaska in hopes of a<br/>
&gt; fall admission. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cool. What colleges are up there?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;We told them that would be fine but we might decide to do a Trading<br/>
Spaces<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;thing while they were gone and their rooms might be the spaces &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; LOL! If you do, be sure to do one of those treatments where the room ends<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; painted in plaid or draped in curtains like a circus tent. ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Casey had me go to their website because she sooo wanted to do Trading<br/>
&gt; Spaces with a friend, trading their bedrooms. She was very upset to learn<br/>
&gt; that you had to be 18.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Life is good.<br/>
