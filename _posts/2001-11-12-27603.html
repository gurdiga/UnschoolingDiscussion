<div id="ygrps-yiv-929205126">Hi guys, Jacli here :)<br/>
Okay, get ready, outspoken comments to follow.<br/>
I&#39;ve been following this video/deschooling/media thread<br/>
with some interest.<br/>
The question was asked do we simply allow our children to<br/>
be fed <br/>
advertising.  This is a fairly important question in our<br/>
house, for a few<br/>
reasons:<br/>
1) as devoted parents we are naturally concerned about the <br/>
possible mind-washing commercials & ads can have<br/>
2) Both my daughter and I are actresses.<br/>
3) My husband is a computer program designer and I program<br/>
games<br/>
as a hubby.<br/>
<br/>
Where is the line?  When have we stepped over from<br/>
responsible to <br/>
dictator?  I believe that someone else mentioned that they<br/>
do <br/>
not want to dictate to their kids how and when and what to<br/>
watch.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.  Personally I have to agree with Sandra and disagree<br/>
with the notion that all video games are harmful or evil.<br/>
That said I also disagree with letting<br/>
kids be exposed to all sorts of advertising AND I disagree<br/>
with allowing them <br/>
to pick and choose what they watch.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that my daughter enjoyed a huge amount of motor<br/>
skill improvement directly because of video games.  They<br/>
require a certain<br/>
amount of eye hand co-ordination that simply can&#39;t be<br/>
attained by<br/>
the normal activities of childhood.  Her neurologist was<br/>
the one who <br/>
suggested I let her play the super nintendo.  It was one of<br/>
the few suggestions<br/>
from that woman that worked. <br/>
<br/>
It improved her ability to concentrate and pay attention<br/>
and follow directions as well.<br/>
She was four at the time and obviously I wasn&#39;t letting her<br/>
play street fighter.<br/>
There are literally thousands of video games available.  If<br/>
you are seriously considering allowing your child to play<br/>
them You have to be willing to invest a little time and<br/>
check them all out.  That&#39;s what I did.  I called Nintendo<br/>
and they were very cooperative.  At the time they had only<br/>
Nintendo and Super Nintendo.  SNES was still new and they<br/>
ONLY had 400 titles available.  So they sent me a detailed<br/>
listing and description booklet.  It lists every single<br/>
title, full description for each game as well as age<br/>
recommendations.  It is free and they still do this.  Just<br/>
call and ask.  So we got her Thomas the tank engine and<br/>
stuff like that.  <br/>
<br/>
Now she is twelve years old and enjoys a whole slew of<br/>
other games, at my discretion for the amount of time I<br/>
specify.  I do not feel it has had any adverse<br/>
effect.  Are there times when she &quot;zones out&quot; and fails to<br/>
hear or react to anything at all?  Sure.  But guess what?<br/>
The same thing happens when she reads Harry Potter or The<br/>
Hobbit.  I don&#39;t get too upset then so I don&#39;t get too<br/>
upset when it happens during Legend of Zelda.<br/>
<br/>
As for advertising, both she and I are actresses and<br/>
commercials are our bread and butter (but so is voice over<br/>
reading for books btw).  But that doesn&#39;t stop me from not<br/>
allowing her to watch the commercials.  It has been a rule<br/>
in our house from the beginning.  She is not allowed to<br/>
watch commercials.  For the most part whenever possible we<br/>
actually tape whatever she is going to watch and edit out<br/>
the ads.<br/>
<br/>
Either way there are still times when commercials come on<br/>
and she catches one or two.  If its a funny one we laugh<br/>
over it.  If it is a toy ad there are times when she buys<br/>
into it.  But I just remind her of the reality of tv.<br/>
Commercials are made to sell.  Period.  Propaganda at its<br/>
capitalistic best.  These ads demonstrate the way our<br/>
economy works.  She understands that, but not only because<br/>
we took the time to explain it to her.  She has done<br/>
commercials and box covers for Hasbro toys.  For example<br/>
There is a certain toy that is designed to be made into<br/>
different things, space ships or crowns or little toy<br/>
villages or whatever.  When she first got called in to do<br/>
the new commercial and new line of boxes she was so excited<br/>
she was gonna get to play with this stuff en masse (it is<br/>
very expensive and she has only a limited supply at home)<br/>
and learn how to make all the cool stuff on the boxes.  But<br/>
the reality was that the first thing they did was to<br/>
explain that there would be no playing.  It took two adult<br/>
professional designers to make those creations.  Two adults<br/>
with nails, glue guns, wiring and invis-thread.  By the end<br/>
of her first day she saw the truth for herself.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that I believe it is healthy to<br/>
allow kids a limited amount of exposure to the<br/>
commercial/media process, just don&#39;t let them bathe in it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my uninvited 2 cents worth.  Hope it helps.<br/>
Take care, Jacli :)<br/>

&lt;My kid aren&#39;t deciding what they want to do based on its<br/>
advertising.  Some <br/>
&lt;toys are played with one day, even though the advertising<br/>
was great!   Mine <br/>
&lt;still play original nintendo even though it hasn&#39;t been<br/>
marketted for ten <br/>
&lt;years or so.  Who told them to do that?  They did it<br/>
because it was fun.  And <br/>
&lt;they did it even though they have flashier, newer &quot;cooler&quot;<br/>
stuff in the house.&gt;<br/>
&lt;I wonder what brain wave state dancers and jocks are in?<br/>
It&#39;s not possible <br/>
&lt;to check them with today&#39;s equipment, because they&#39;re<br/>

<br/>
My kids have figured out advertising too.  Sometimes from saving their money <br/>
to buy something they ended up not liking.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always discussed what&#39;s being sold and how (often without being <br/>
clinical about it, sometimes obliquely or sarcastically, like &quot;Oooh!  If I <br/>
buy those genes I&#39;ll be 18 and have those guys around me!!&quot;)  They were <br/>
really very young when they applied critical thinking to the message on TV.  <br/>
The loving families, the beautiful scenery, the extra-nice houses.  They <br/>
know.   <br/>
<br/>
There is lots of input from parodies in their lives too.  They&#39;ve heard Weird <br/>
Al since they were little and he skewers TV constantly (and has also watched <br/>
it a lot, or he couldn&#39;t make such elegant humor of it).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather help them see it clearly and then ignore it than try to hide it <br/>
from them or them from it.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid and had friends and relatives whose parents did NOT want <br/>
their children exposed to sex education or evolution, I saw that those kids <br/>
thought about sex and evolution WAY more than I did, because their lives were <br/>
based, in part, on sex and evolution (avoidance thereof), and no doubt when <br/>
they were old enough they snuck out and read Darwin (which I certainly never <br/>
read).<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable.  Not that cable saves you from advertising as it once <br/>
promised it would do, but we have broadcast.  And it&#39;s free for the price of <br/>
plugging in a free-from-friends TV.  The cost of it is enduring (or ignoring) <br/>
the commercials put there by the people who provided it for us free.<br/>
<br/>
We have a close friend who works at an ad agency.  She&#39;s brought magazines <br/>
for the kids, and brought a video they used at a conference, and she&#39;s talked <br/>
to them about how things unfold, who pays for what.  Two of their current <br/>
accounts are with state tourism and the highway commission.  Tourism gets all <br/>
dreamy sun-shots and mushy music.  Highway safety gets seatbelt scares.  <br/>
They&#39;re selling behavioral changes!  (Although most of the state tourism <br/>
stuff is shown in other states, hoping to lure tourists here.)<br/>
