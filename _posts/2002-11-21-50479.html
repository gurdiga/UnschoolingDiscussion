&lt;&lt; Are you going to update us?  Did you get your walking cast?  It&#39;s selfish <br/>
of <br/>
me to ask, but you are my window to the future in some ways...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not so good.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still downstairs and didn&#39;t get to cook yet.  Can&#39;t stand without <br/>
crutches yet.  Sad.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith took Kirby to a podiatrist today.  He has a plantars wart getting worse <br/>
and worse, after two liquid nitrogen treatments.   But while they were there <br/>
Keith was asking the guy about why the brace I have is painful and this way <br/>
and that angle...  The podiatrist explained it all to Keith&#39;s satisfaction, <br/>
who came home and made me feel better about it too.  <br/>
<br/>
The good thing is I can take it off to take a bath.  The bad thing is I don&#39;t <br/>
have a good bathtub, and the one we have is upstairs.<br/>
<br/>
The good thing is it&#39;s the last phase, probably, of the painful yuckiness.  <br/>
The bad thing is it&#39;s supposed to stay on until December 31 or longer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called a Bledsoe Boot.  There&#39;s a picture of it here:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sportsmedshop.com/catalog/product.esiml?PID=193">http://www.sportsmedshop.com/catalog/product.esiml?PID=193</a><br/>
<br/>
The podiatrist said it&#39;s to stretch the tendons that were all relaxed when <br/>
the casts were on, so by the time you&#39;re walking, you&#39;re not limping as you <br/>
might with a regular cast.  So to step down all the way, my knee has to be <br/>
bent.  I&#39;m walking like a monkey now to keep from  having to walk like a <br/>
monkey later.<br/>
<br/>
But...  They said go from 0 to 100% weight over the next three or four weeks. <br/>
 So this is zero day.  I was already standing on that other cast (using it as <br/>
a kick-stand, Holly said) so I&#39;ve done that some.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll get there.  I&#39;m just  not as happy as I had planned to be today.<br/>
<br/>
But we did have music practice last night and that was fun.<br/>

son&#39;s plantars warts with banana peels!  I read about banana peels for warts<br/>
in _Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child_ by Zand, Walton and Rountree.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t know if it would work on plantars warts, but it did.  He had a<br/>
cluster of 4 on his foot.  Every night, before bed, we would put a fresh<br/>
slice of banana peel on the warts, inside side facing the skin, and cover<br/>
with a band-aid.  After about a month, it looked like the &quot;seed&quot; of the wart<br/>
(the blackisk spots that are usually inside) were at the surface.  We went<br/>
swimming for the day, and they came out.  There were little craters where<br/>
the warts used to be.  There was no pain and no blood.  In a few weeks the<br/>
skin had evened out and you couldn&#39;t tell that there had ever been warts<br/>
there!<br/>

<br/>
Sorry to hear your recovery isn&#39;t going as fast as you would have liked it <br/>
to go. Seems like a long time to me since your accident, I can&#39;t imagine how <br/>
must feel. I send my thoughts for a speedy non painful recovery.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652164569">Thanks for the update and I&#39;m sorry it didn&#39;t go better.  And thanks for the <br/>
link.  Every one is asleep, so I might look it up.  I guess I had assumed it <br/>
possible to go from no weight to full weight with a miracle cast.  Now that I <br/>
think about it, that doesn&#39;t make much sense either.  But how can you put <br/>
only 30 percent of your weight on?<br/>
<br/>
I go tomorrow for another check, it&#39;s only been five weeks, so I don&#39;t have <br/>
my hopes up too high.  I do, after all, have three pins and a plate with <br/>
eight screws.  He was talking about getting me out of the cast early because <br/>
my foot is pointed in the cast (I was in ballet starting at four years old <br/>
and my feet only really relax in a slightly pointed position.  Even under <br/>
anesthesia he couldn&#39;t straighten it out.)<br/>
<br/>
The only truly interesting thing about all of this is that my four year old <br/>
son wants to go to my appointment.  He&#39;s become quite protective of me, he <br/>
went to the dermatologist with me.  Another aside, but I had eight moles <br/>
removed, none of them likely to be serious, but five of them in my armpits.  <br/>
Crutches and sore armpits don&#39;t mix.  You might remember that Nathan <br/>
convinced himself he had pushed me down the stairs.  He&#39;s over that now and <br/>
can recite the whole story in an accurate way.  But he wants to see the <br/>
doctor and understand what will happen.  I figure it can only help him to <br/>
come to grips with my accident.  <br/>
<br/>
I so wish you could cook.  Between that and the laundry, this has been a <br/>
total surrendering experience for me.<br/>

cut off its supply of outside oxygen, it will die quicker.<br/>

If you still have the staples from the surgery, he might not want to watch <br/>
them take those out.  That hurts, I was whimpering and trying not to alarm <br/>
Holly, and she told me (just the other day) there was blood.  Keith says not <br/>

x-rays, loved the plate, 8 screws and three pins.  He was interested in the <br/>
pointed toes.  The whole thing is much less scary for him now.  And he <br/>
cheerfully got up before 8 to get to the appointment on time.  I was nervous <br/>
about taking him because he&#39;s only four.  It&#39;s hard sometimes to get to the <br/>
same place in the four year olds head to know why they want to do something <br/>
and why I shouldn&#39;t be such a worry wart.<br/>
<br/>
I can shower in a week and a half.  December 5th the cast comes off.  No <br/>
boot, he said to bring a sock and shoe.  He said I can walk on it but wont <br/>
want to, that it will be two weeks after that before I&#39;m able to put full <br/>
weight on.  He&#39;s eager to start physical therapy and get me moving again.  He <br/>
even checked my now pretty buff arms to see how they were doing with all the <br/>
crutch walking.  <br/>
<br/>
I have this sick feeling that physical therapy is going to hurt lots.  But <br/>
probably not as much as the break.  ;)<br/>

it in tea tree cream and a big band aid.<br/>
And at least the wart has gone :-)<br/>

No, that&#39;s great!  Her body surrounded it and spit it out.   I wish Kirby&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362467296">Maybe try a solution of grapefruit seed extract and water, applied a <br/>
couple or three times a day and kept covered with a bandaid repeated <br/>
for a couple of weeks or until changes start occurring.  Three drops <br/>
in an ounce of water.  May also be taken internally as three drops in <br/>
4 oz water or juice. Do NOT use GSE full strength.  I&#39;ve used <br/>
Nutribiotics brand, seemed to work very well on a large (10-12)<br/>
handful of warts my 5yrold ds accumulated some years ago. <br/>
Tho I&#39;ve not come across banana peel as a remedy I have heard herbal <br/>
lore recommending potato peel applied and kept covered.<br/>
<br/>
GSE=possible allergen?  maybe.  use caution.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All these things seem to call for keeping it covered.  And now there&#39;s<br/>
research that shows keeping it covered with duct tape or a bandaid will do<br/>
the trick.  I&#39;m guessing they don&#39;t like being kept moist.<br/>
