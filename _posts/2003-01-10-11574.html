Hey!  I was recently up in Port Townsend to pick up<br/>
our yurt!  You have the most adorable downtown<br/>
(although I zipped in, got the yurt loaded up and<br/>
zipped back out again to get to relatives near<br/>
portland.)<br/>
I wish I could have stayed longer!<br/>

Yes, Port Townsend is a very cool town.  When we moved<br/>
over to the Peninsula last summer from Seattle, Port<br/>
Townsend was my first choice but unfortunately too<br/>
expensive.  Sequim is basically the next big town to<br/>
the west and that&#39;s where my parents live but then I<br/>
discovered Port Angeles, a beautiful place also.  We<br/>
found this place just west of Port Angeles on March<br/>
15th after the surprise snow storm in western WA and<br/>
we fell in love with this place before we walked in<br/>
the door...  a little snow all the way here and then<br/>
as we drove up this road past farms, more and more<br/>
snow, until we got here to a log house on 10 acres and<br/>
a foot of snow!  The town is beautiful too and when<br/>
you drive out onto Ediz Hook almost to the Coast Guard<br/>
station and look back at the town of Port Angeles and<br/>
at the Olympic Mountains towering over the town it<br/>
takes your breath away.  The kids (2 boys, one just<br/>
turned 13 and the other is 9) and I love it here!  Not<br/>
as many children to play with as living in a<br/>
neighborhood but since we&#39;ve been homeschooling the<br/>
last couple years there weren&#39;t as many children to<br/>
play with anyway because they were either at school or<br/>
doing homework!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I also read the note about the sad<br/>
situation with the manipulative father and wanted to<br/>
put my 2 cents in.  I saw a divorce lawyer about a<br/>
year ago and he said that the courts won&#39;t force a<br/>
family to put the children in school so the Mom can go<br/>
to work but they may adjust what the Mom gets if it&#39;s<br/>
proven that she could make a certain amount of money<br/>
by working outside the home and decides not to.  In my<br/>
case, I decided to move over here with the kids and my<br/>
husband stays in our trailer in Seattle coming home on<br/>
weekends only.  Too long of a story for here but I<br/>
felt that it would work out better if I didn&#39;t have a<br/>
divorce situation where I had to send the kids to be<br/>
alone with their Dad on weekends (VERY controlling!!).<br/>
 Anyway, just wanted to say that there are jobs a<br/>
woman can do from home now if there must be a divorce.<br/>
 It&#39;s also wonderful to have a positive influence<br/>
family for those children to be around to show that<br/>
their life at home is not the way it is in all<br/>
families. <br/>

I&#39;m glad that lawyer thinks so, that his experience says that in your state, <br/>
but I&#39;d like to caution that this makes it sound as if that would be <br/>
universally true, across the U.S. true, true in most situations. It&#39;s not. <br/>
The most common scenario is that dad  asks the court to order his children <br/>
schooled, hoping to avoid paying support. Even dads who previously supported <br/>
and encouraged homeschooling have been know to do this. At least one divorce <br/>
court judge has also stepped in and ordered children into school when neither <br/>
parent requested that outcome. There are probably other families we don&#39;t <br/>
know about who didn&#39;t raise a fuss and went along with it.<br/>
<br/>
In the family being discussed, one of the problems is the dad is trying to <br/>
force a child into school who doesn&#39;t want to go. If they end up in court, <br/>
he&#39;s more likely to get his way than the children and mom are to get theirs. <br/>
The odds of getting a homeschool sympathetic court are pretty darn low.<br/>
