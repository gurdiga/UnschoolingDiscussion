<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808890836">We&#39;ve just started homeschooling. My son, who is seven, has shown <br/>
great interest in learning Spanish. I&#39;m not sure how to go about it. <br/>
I&#39;ve never been great with speaking foreign languages and he&#39;s not <br/>
interested in learning to read and/or write it at this time. I could <br/>
sign him up for an expensive course but I&#39;m afraid a structured<br/>
course will kill the fun factor. Any suggestions? <br/>

My kids speak Spanish, but my stepkids have been picking it up by watching <br/>
Spanish language TV shows with them. There are some that are children&#39;s shows <br/>
that are pretty decent. There is one called Salsa that is designed to teach <br/>
American kids to speak Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you have someone around to speak Spanish with him, you&#39;ll probably do <br/>
best to learn right along with him, and just use the words when you can in <br/>
conversation. There are lots of cd-roms, for kids and adults for foreign <br/>
languages. Sorry I can&#39;t recommend a specific one. If he&#39;s really interested <br/>
you might try books on tape as well. Here&#39;s a site that has lots of books and <br/>
tapes.<br/>

Usborne makes some great foreign language videos and sticker books. My son <br/>
also likes the Jumpstart Spanish computer game.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699177645">Listen to the Spanish radio station.  Read Spanish language versions of<br/>
children&#39;s books.  Go to Spain or Mexico.  Sign up for the Spanish word<br/>
of the day (Transparent Language, Inc. http://www.transparent.com) or the<br/>
Parlo newsletter (parlo.com ?)<br/>
<br/>
I am TRYING to learn Spanish too.  The hardest part is that it needs to<br/>
be used regularly to really learn it.  We are planning to go to the Baja<br/>
Peninsula in 2001 and stay for a month.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995504716">One thing I found is that if you watch movies on DVD instead of a VCR, you<br/>
can also click on the dubbed version in other languages. We recently watched<br/>
&quot;The Grinch Who Stole Christmas&quot; (the old animated version) in Spanish with<br/>
our kids. We have given up the TV/VCR but once a week have &quot;family movie<br/>
night&quot; and watch a DVD on my computer. That&#39;s one great advantage of the<br/>
DVD!<br/>
Looks like we&#39;re going to Costa Rica in the fall for a friend&#39;s wedding so<br/>
that means I need to ramp up our Spanish (we&#39;ve been learning it fairly<br/>
lackadaisically with me checking out random books and tapes from the<br/>
library). Even at the snail&#39;s pace we&#39;ve been going though, my 14 month old<br/>
has already used 2 Spanish words (&quot;agua&quot; and &quot;boca&quot;) in her growing<br/>
vocabulary!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428349867">Hi<br/>
My seven year old wanted to learn French and we asked around and found 10 <br/>
home educators who wanted to.  We have a university student come once a <br/>
week and teach them all.  They really seem to enjoy it.<br/>
They do some written work but also play games and we finished the year with <br/>
a French breakfast which was great.  You just need to decide yourself how <br/>
you want it to work.  I sit in with her and could take the notes myself if <br/>
I wanted.  We do half and half of the writing.  She is picking it up <br/>
quicker than me!<br/>
