<div id="ygrps-yiv-303399271">The law in Texas does state a &quot;written curriculum,&quot; in the Leeper decision<br/>
that most people use as the basis for TX homeschooling law. However, that<br/>
can be books, the internet, video, computer, you name it. It doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
even resemble what most people call a &quot;curriculum.&quot; No one checks it, you<br/>
don&#39;t have to report or test or keep a log or anything. I would imagine any<br/>
homeschooler has enough resource material in their homes to constitute a<br/>
&quot;written curriculum&quot; as set forth, and wouldn&#39;t need to purchase anything<br/>
additional. How you use it (or not) is up to you!<br/>
