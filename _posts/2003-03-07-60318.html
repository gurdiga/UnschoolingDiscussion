my lists, but I thought this piece - by one of my favorite writers - <br/>
was particularly relevant to the current discussion:<br/>

On Horizontal Vs Vertical Prayer<br/>
March 5, 2003<br/>
BY ROGER EBERT<br/>
<br/>
The Bush administration has been dealt a setback in its campaign to allow<br/>
prayer in our public schools. The full 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals<br/>
has voted 15-9 to back the 2-1 vote by its earlier panel finding the<br/>
Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because of the words &#39;&#39;under God.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The pledge, written in 1892, had those words added to it in 1954, during<br/>
the Eisenhower administration, and I remember a nun in our Catholic<br/>
school telling us we had to say it because it was the law--but it was<br/>
wrong, because it violated the principle of separating church and state.<br/>
We started every day with classroom prayer at St. Mary&#39;s School, of<br/>
course, but Sister Rosanne said there was a difference between voluntary<br/>
prayer in a private religious school and prayer in a school paid for by<br/>
every taxpayer--a distinction so obvious that Bush and Attorney General<br/>
John Ashcroft are forced to willfully ignore it.<br/>
Ashcroft said after the ruling that his Justice Department will &#39;&#39;spare<br/>
no effort to preserve the rights of all our citizens to pledge allegiance<br/>
to the American flag&#39;&#39;--a misrepresentation so blatant that it functions<br/>
as a lie. The pledge remains intact and unchallenged. The court said<br/>
nothing about pledging allegiance to the flag. It spoke only of the words<br/>
&#39;&#39;under God&#39;&#39;--which amounted, the court said, to an endorsement of<br/>
religion.<br/>
This is really an argument between two kinds of prayer--vertical and<br/>
horizontal. I don&#39;t have the slightest problem with vertical prayer. It<br/>
is horizontal prayer that frightens me. Vertical prayer is private,<br/>
directed upward toward heaven. It need not be spoken aloud, because God<br/>
is a spirit and has no ears. Horizontal prayer must always be audible,<br/>
because its purpose is not to be heard by God, but to be heard by fellow<br/>
men standing within earshot.<br/>
To choose an example from football, when my team needs a field goal to<br/>
win and I think, &#39;&#39;Please, dear God, let them make it!&#39;&#39;--that is<br/>
vertical prayer. When, before the game, a group of fans joins hands and<br/>
&#39;&#39;voluntarily&#39;&#39; recites the Lord&#39;s Prayer--that is horizontal prayer. It<br/>
serves one of two purposes: to encourage me to join them, or to make me<br/>
feel excluded.<br/>
Although some of the horizontal devout are sincere, others use this<br/>
prayer as a device of recruitment or intimidation. If you are conspicuous<br/>
in your refusal to go along, they may even turn and pray while holding<br/>
you directly in their sights.<br/>
This simple insight about two kinds of prayer, which is beyond<br/>
theological question, should bring a dead halt to the obsession with<br/>
prayer in public places. It doesn&#39;t, because the purpose of its<br/>
supporters is political, not spiritual. Their faith is like Dial soap:<br/>
Now that they use it, they wish everyone would. I grew up in an America<br/>
where people of good breeding did not impose their religious convictions<br/>
upon those they did not know very well. Now those manners have been<br/>
discarded.<br/>
Our attorney general, John Ashcroft, is theoretically responsible for<br/>
enforcing the separation of church and state. He violates his oath of<br/>
office daily by getting down on his knees in his government office every<br/>
morning and welcoming federal employees to join him in &#39;&#39;voluntary&#39;&#39;<br/>
prayer on carpets paid for by the taxpayers.<br/>
His brand of religion is specifically fundamentalist evangelical. As his<br/>
eyes lift from beneath lowered lids to take informal attendance, would he<br/>
be gladdened to see a Muslim, a Catholic, a Jew, a Hindu, a Buddhist, a<br/>
Baha&#39;i, a Unitarian, a Scientologist, all accompanied by the chants of<br/>
Hare Krishnas?<br/>
Under Bush we have had a great deal of horizontal prayer, in which we<br/>
evoke the deity at political events to send the sideways message that our<br/>
enemies had better look out, because God is on our side. This week&#39;s<br/>
Newsweek cover story reports that the Bush presidency &#39;&#39;is the most<br/>
resolutely &#39;faith-based&#39; in modern times.&#39;&#39;<br/>
Because our enemies are for the most part more enthusiastic about<br/>
horizontal prayer than we are, and see absolutely no difference between<br/>
church and state--indeed, want to make them the same--it is alarming to<br/>
reflect that they may be having more success bringing us around to their<br/>
point of view than we are at sticking to our own traditional American<br/>
beliefs about freedom of religion. When Ashcroft and his enemies both<br/>
begin their days with displays of their godliness, do we feel safer after<br/>
they rise from their devotions?<br/>
