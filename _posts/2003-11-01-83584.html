<div id="ygrps-yiv-462010218">&lt;&lt;And she has the nerve to call <br/>
my daughter a slut <br/>
<br/>
and to write her off, just like that, after all these years of <br/>
<br/>
supposedly caring for her too? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;Sandra writes&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Jealousy and dismay.  Lashing out in vague frustration and pain.<br/>
Breathe and let it pass.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend won&#39;t be impressed with her mother&#39;s attitude.  Let her see a <br/>
better one from you!<br/>
<br/>
Did you help her through a miscarriage of a pregnancy her mom didn&#39;t even <br/>
know about?  If so, you WAY have the upper hand in all things social and <br/>
moral, <br/>
and you can sleep peacefully.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***********<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing about this is that I got a call from this friend&#39;s mother in <br/>
the middle of the night, when the miscarriage started, to meet her (the mom) <br/>
at the hospital and offer moral support while the d&c was being done.  She <br/>
didn&#39;t need judgement, and I didn&#39;t offer it (not that I would have anyway).  She <br/>
needed someone to hold her hand and let her cry.  That&#39;s what I did.  I find <br/>
it disappointing when people can&#39;t offer to others what they need -- and take <br/>
-- for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Good advice, breathing and letting it pass, but losing a friendship hurts, <br/>
and my dd is hurting too.  Just life, I suppose.  We are both confident in our <br/>
positions on this, though.  Not feeling insecure or inferior.  It&#39;s a blessing <br/>
to see my Nikki handling it so well.<br/>

Like you said...what are you gonna do?<br/>

Exactly.  I&#39;d much rather have an honest relationship with her.  Her friend, <br/>
the one with the miscarriage, was terrified to tell her mother.  No <br/>
communication at all.  And there she was, all alone (except for equally frightened <br/>
peers), twisting in the wind.<br/>

the boyfriend being partially supported by you. (Apartment rent)  I don&#39;t <br/>
necessarily think it&#39;s a bad thing, but it seems like something you and <br/>
your dh should chat about with the two of them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, yes, Tia, has this been a sore point.  :-P  Dh initially wanted <br/>
to make it so that boyfriend would be fully responsible for the rent <br/>
if they want to *play grown up.*  I prevailed against that and we <br/>
split the difference.  I was concerned that we not put our dd fully <br/>
under this boy&#39;s influence, or protection, or sense of <br/>
responsibility, or whatever.  Plus, it only seemed fair that if they <br/>
are roommates, that they should split everything 50-50.  So, that&#39;s <br/>
what we&#39;re doing.  It&#39;s not a perfect solution, but as close as we <br/>
can get to a place where we feel comfortable.<br/>

I was wondering about the money thing too!!! We have an attached apartment<br/>
that my mom lives in. Eventually it will be empty and someone will be able<br/>
to use it. Depending on how long it takes and how old any of the kids are.<br/>
Tara knows it&#39;s there for her if she wants it. Maybe for free, maybe for<br/>
rent, depending on the situation. I have often thought of what I would do or<br/>
how we would work that if it came about. As in if she wanted someone in<br/>
there with her. I think if she were paying rent herself, then she can do<br/>
what she decides as far as where the money comes from. Her staying there for<br/>
free with someone else wouldn&#39;t work for me. I think you made the best<br/>
decision. Hope it all works out well for your daughter.<br/>
