  -=-     Yes, I understand the view that experts are just as likely as not <br/>
to <br/>
be stupid and harmful (not an opinion I share) but that&#39;s not the part that <br/>
bothers me -- adopting the attitude that experts are stupid is no smarter <br/>
than <br/>
accepting their counsel wholesale.=&#92;=<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really think you&#39;re missing the point.  Your &quot;yes I understand&quot; did NOT <br/>
follow the example I gave.<br/>
<br/>
Some expertise is expertise in doing something which produces more harm than <br/>
good.  And not all teachers are evil.  But some aspects of teaching are evil, <br/>
in that they are harmful and non-productive.  And for so someone with a <br/>
doctoral degree in education (as I&#39;m supposing the &quot;edd&quot; in &quot;jrossedd&quot; stands for) <br/>
to keep on and on and on defending degrees in general as though they were all <br/>
of one elemental piece ignores the actual objection to &quot;experts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In a wrestling match if you don&#39;t tap out you could get hurt, and if you <br/>
intend to defend all trained educators you just need to tap out.  This is not the <br/>
arena in which you&#39;ll succeed in that defense.<br/>
<br/>
Someone I&#39;ve known for twenty years, since she was a teen, has a master&#39;s <br/>
degree in early childhood ed.  She got in in one year, following a quickie <br/>
undergrad degree in elementary ed.  NOT following any classrrom experience outside <br/>
the one practicum/student teaching, in a daycare center.<br/>
<br/>
She had no expertise in DOING anything.  Her first job was supervising other <br/>
master&#39;s candidates in their student teaching.  She was teaching what she had <br/>
never herself done.  I&#39;d like to think she was the only one, but anyone who <br/>
has been around schools knows there are administrators who have never taught, <br/>
and administrators who are there because they are crappy teachers, and the other <br/>
staff wanted to get them into an office, and away from the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Hers is NOT a master&#39;s degree deserving the level of respect of people who <br/>
worked hard and discovered something new or provided a new method or idea.  It <br/>
was the NEA stuffing the early-ed ballot box with a bunch of unemployed <br/>
&quot;experts in early childhood education,&quot; so they can continue to press for government <br/>
funded (and eventually compulsory) school for children younger than the age of <br/>
five.<br/>
<br/>
They might not succeed in that press; they might.  But the market is flooded <br/>
with master&#39;s level experts now.  Experts in separating babies and toddlers <br/>
from their mothers.<br/>

<br/>
       But it does seem unlikely you and I are going to come to any better <br/>
understanding on this topic, and I have no problem being the one to just stop. <br/>
