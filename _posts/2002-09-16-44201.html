<div id="ygrps-yiv-722233964">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I recently met a gal online who told me she was currently <br/>
homeschooling her kids, and would homeschool them through college <br/>
also. I asked her how she planned on homeschooling college, but <br/>
haven&#39;t heard back from her.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what everyone here thought of homeschooling college. <br/>
Personally, I would love to homeschool myself, as I haven&#39;t been back <br/>
to college since I had my kids, and I don&#39;t see myself getting back <br/>
there in the near future. Yet I would LOVE a degree in <br/>
psychology :::grin:::<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts anyone???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Open University - now available in the US offers degrees you <br/>
can study from home, as well as Masters degrees. I started doing <br/>
a Masters but ran out of cash.<br/>
Doing an OU degree (they are very popular in the UK) means you <br/>
can take it as fast or as slowly as you want. Plus you have time to <br/>
be with your kids or work if you need. The OU also accept students <br/>
without formal qualifications like A level and whatever it is <br/>
Americans get at 18.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I was wondering what everyone here thought of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling college. <br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t been back <br/>
&gt;   to college since I had my kids, and I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; myself getting back <br/>

&gt;   Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I recently met a gal online who told me she was<br/>
&gt; currently <br/>
&gt;   homeschooling her kids, and would homeschool them<br/>
&gt; through college <br/>
&gt;   also. I asked her how she planned on homeschooling<br/>
&gt; college, but <br/>
&gt;   haven&#39;t heard back from her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I was wondering what everyone here thought of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling college. <br/>
&gt;   Personally, I would love to homeschool myself, as<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t been back <br/>
&gt;   to college since I had my kids, and I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; myself getting back <br/>
&gt;   there in the near future. Yet I would LOVE a<br/>
&gt; degree in <br/>
&gt;   psychology :::grin:::<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Any thoughts anyone???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
