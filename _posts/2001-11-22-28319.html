<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303729921">My most sincere apologies for clogging up your e-mail and making your eyes<br/>
batty from the tedious scrolling.  I&#39;ll try to only reply when my little<br/>
ones aren&#39;t hanging off my legs or sitting in my lap....I&#39;ll try to be<br/>
conscious of what I&#39;m doing.   I promise I&#39;ll try hard!!!!<br/>
What&#39;s most embarassing is that I made the same request of someone else a<br/>
few weeks ago!<br/>
Sorry again,<br/>
Susan</div>
