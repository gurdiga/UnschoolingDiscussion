Julian is an only child with three parents who spend lots of time with him  <br/>
individually almost every day.  I always thought those were good odds.  Three <br/>
people aren&#39;t likely to be losing it at any one time. :)<br/>

This reminds me of a study performed by The Re-evaluation Co-counseling<br/>
organization headquartered in Portland Oregon (I think) whose philosophy<br/>
includes deep respect for children&#39;s thoughts, feelings, needs and desires.<br/>
They found that that it takes approximately four adults for every one child<br/>
to lead the least distressed life. You&#39;re almost there Kathryn!<br/>

Years ago when I was pregnant with Holly we took Kirby and Marty to <br/>
Disneyland.  We took another friend with us (a young man who had just been discharged <br/>
from the Air Force) so that we would have more adults than children.   We paid <br/>
his airfare and entry just to help us with two boys.  It was GLORIOUS.  <br/>
Peaceful.  People weren&#39;t grumpy with each other.  I could take a nap each day.<br/>
