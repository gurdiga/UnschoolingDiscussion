<div id="ygrps-yiv-669991944"><p><span>Up until lately, my daughter (who will turn 4 next week) was one of those kids who was totally easy going, never had a tantrum, was a breeze to parent, and being her partner felt like a no brainer most of the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Last week, she really threw me for a loop. &nbsp;We were at a small indoor shopping area that has a great open play and art space for kids, which is perfect for slushy wintry days and she loves it. &nbsp;We were there for a while before leaving to visit family (1.5 hour drive) for a planned event which she was excited about. &nbsp;This shopping area has only one way in and out, and at the entrance/exit is a little cafe that sells gelato, which we frequent from time to time. &nbsp;On this visit last week, I warned her about our dwindling time - which she likes me to do - and when it was time she was happy to leave. &nbsp;As we passed the cafe she said she wanted ice cream and I told her we didn&#39;t have time now but we&#39;d get some later with her grandparents. &nbsp;She stopped in her tracks and screamed at the top of her lungs. &nbsp;She&#39;s never done that before. &nbsp;I spun around, kneeled in front of her, and quietly but sternly said it is not ok to scream like that here. &nbsp;I held her hand as we walked towards the door and she pulled away and walked several steps back the other way, with a look on her face that said &quot;what are you going to do now?&quot;. &nbsp;I tried to grab her hand and she walked several more steps back, so I continued on my way towards the door. &nbsp;I opened the door, at which point she came running and started crying that it&#39;s her job to open doors, and I commented matter-of-factly that she shouldn&#39;t have walked away from me then. &nbsp;Once outside, we had to walk only half block, but the sidewalks were icy/slushy so she wanted to hold my hand but was simultaneously refusing to walk to the car. &nbsp;I asked her if she wanted me to carry her and she screamed no. &nbsp;A bit bewildered, I walked to the car. &nbsp;She started crying again, so I went back for her, but she turned and walked the other way. &nbsp;I told her she could walk to the car or I could carry her and she took a few more steps back so I went and scooped her up and put her in the car. &nbsp;She refused to get in her car seat - at this point screaming nonstop - so I closed the car door and took a minute to calm myself down. &nbsp;I then opened the door and said we had to go, I couldn&#39;t drive without her safely buckled in, and she just kept screaming, and kicking me as I tried to pick her up and put her in her seat. &nbsp;I finally got her in her seat by a combo of picking her up and sort of smooshing her over by taking up the space she had occupied, all the while she&#39;s writhing, kicking and screaming. &nbsp;As I tried to buckle her in, she hit my face with both hands and pulled my hair. &nbsp;I am committed to not yelling, but I was so angry that I kind of growled through my teeth at her &quot;don&#39;t hit me!&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s not ok!&quot;. &nbsp;By the time she was buckled in I was sweating and shaking all over. &nbsp;It was awful! &nbsp;She was like a child who&#39;d been possessed and I was in a state of shock. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Today it happened again, in the same place, slightly different circumstances. &nbsp;She had just finished with a dance class, I had to get her home to hang out with her dad so I could go to yoga class. &nbsp;Before we even got near the cafe she said she wanted ice cream, I said I&#39;d make her a bowl with a side of chocolates when we got home. &nbsp;Stomping and screaming. &nbsp;I said that&#39;s not ok at all, we had to go, she had a choice to walk or I&#39;d carry her. &nbsp;She screamed she didn&#39;t like choices and she wasn&#39;t going anywhere. &nbsp;I picked her up and she hit and scratched my face, pulled on my ears so hard I thought she ripped an earring out, then pulled out two fistfuls of my hair, all the while screaming and trying to wriggle away. &nbsp;I swung her body so I was hanging onto her waist and she was sideways so she couldn&#39;t reach my head and face and walked her out to the car. &nbsp;She said she wanted to walk and I told her she had that chance and lost it. &nbsp;I put her down so she could climb into the car then closed the door and got in the front seat where I could wait for her to calm down enough to buckle her in. &nbsp;I said again it&#39;s not ok to hit, that she hurt me (she really did! &nbsp;I was surprised my ear wasn&#39;t bleeding) and her behavior was completely unacceptable. &nbsp;I gave her to the count of 3 to get into her car seat on her own and was amazed she did it, then let me buckle her without a fight. &nbsp;As I was buckling her, she said through her sobs that she needed a hug (she&#39;d done the same thing last week), so I paused and we hugged. &nbsp;On the short drive home I reiterated how unacceptable her behavior was, which brought on a fresh bout of sobs - it really upsets her when I&#39;m angry.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>My husband and I are flabbergasted by this behavior and not sure how to react without being unnecessarily punitive. &nbsp;</span></p><p>How do we make the firm point that this is seriously not ok? &nbsp;He was not sure what to do as I basically came home, told him what happened and said you deal with her, and went to yoga. &nbsp;He comforted her as she was quite upset and told her she can&#39;t hit. &nbsp;I said what she needed was comfort so I was glad he was there to do that because I was too angry and needed some space.</p><p><br></p><p>A few things worth considering: common factors in both instances were time limits; she&#39;s decided being 4 means she&#39;s a big kid and sometimes likes that idea and sometimes doesn&#39;t (it was with great concern she asked me last night while nursing in bed if she can still nurse when she&#39;s 4); she&#39;s as tall as a 5 or 6 year old and when in public people sometimes expect more from her than she&#39;s capable of - and maybe I do, too; she&#39;s noticing places where she has power and places where she feels powerless and this can trigger a meltdown; and she&#39;s aware that when she cries I slow down and so she&#39;s increased her fake forced crying lately, which gets under my skin and tests my patience.&nbsp;</p><p><span><br></span></p><p>I don&#39;t want to &quot;give in&quot; to basically shut her up, even though that was my urge today because I was embarrassed by her screams. &nbsp;What else could I have done here? &nbsp;We&#39;ve already decided that next week my husband will come meet us after her class so I can casually go to mine and she doesn&#39;t have to rush, but do we say no ice cream because of your terrible episode previously, or plan to get her some because she loves it and it makes her happy? &nbsp;Both of us feel like we should say before we leave the house that there will be no ice cream at the cafe, but is that a really delayed punishment, a remnant of conventional parenting we haven&#39;t flushed from our systems? &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span>We need your sage advice. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If there are clarifying questions, I&#39;ll do my best to respond, otherwise I&#39;ll let the questions that come up percolate in the minds of the readers.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Thank you in advance,</span></p><p><span>cheri</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><br></span></p></div>

My sons didn&#39;t like or need that much warning, though. It made the older one tense.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084347574yui_3_16_0_1_1423080509264_3673"><span id="ygrps-yiv-2084347574yui_3_16_0_1_1423080509264_3674">Up until lately, my daughter (who will turn 4 next week) was one of those kids who was totally easy going, never had a tantrum, was a breeze to parent, and being her partner felt like a no brainer most of the time.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Last week, she really threw me for a loop. &nbsp;We were at a small indoor shopping area that has a great open play and art space for kids, which is perfect for slushy wintry days and she loves it. &nbsp;We were there for a while before leaving to visit family (1.5 hour drive) for a planned event which she was excited about. &nbsp;This shopping area has only one way in and out, and at the entrance/exit is a little cafe that sells gelato, which we frequent from time to time. &nbsp;On this visit last week, I warned her about our dwindling time - which she likes me to do - and when it was time she was happy to leave. &nbsp;As we passed the cafe she said she wanted ice cream and I told her we didn&#39;t have time now but we&#39;d get some later with her grandparents. &nbsp;She stopped in her tracks and screamed at the top of her lungs. &nbsp;She&#39;s never done that before. &nbsp;I spun around, kneeled in front of her, and quietly but sternly said it is not ok to scream like that here. &nbsp;I held her hand as we walked towards the door and she pulled away and walked several steps back the other way, with a look on her face that said &quot;what are you going to do now?&quot;. &nbsp;I tried to grab her hand and she walked several more steps back, so I continued on my way towards the door. &nbsp;I opened the door, at which point she came running and started crying that it&#39;s her job to open doors, and I commented matter-of-factly that she shouldn&#39;t have walked away from me then. &nbsp;Once outside, we had to walk only half block, but the sidewalks were icy/slushy so she wanted to hold my hand but was simultaneously refusing to walk to the car. &nbsp;I asked her if she wanted me to carry her and she screamed no. &nbsp;A bit bewildered, I walked to the car. &nbsp;She started crying again, so I went back for her, but she turned and walked the other way. &nbsp;I told her she could walk to the car or I could carry her and she took a few more steps back so I went and scooped her up and put her in the car. &nbsp;She refused to get in her car seat - at this point screaming nonstop - so I closed the car door and took a minute to calm myself down. &nbsp;I then opened the door and said we had to go, I couldn&#39;t drive without her safely buckled in, and she just kept screaming, and kicking me as I tried to pick her up and put her in her seat. &nbsp;I finally got her in her seat by a combo of picking her up and sort of smooshing her over by taking up the space she had occupied, all the while she&#39;s writhing, kicking and screaming. &nbsp;As I tried to buckle her in, she hit my face with both hands and pulled my hair. &nbsp;I am committed to not yelling, but I was so angry that I kind of growled through my teeth at her &quot;don&#39;t hit me!&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s not ok!&quot;. &nbsp;By the time she was buckled in I was sweating and shaking all over. &nbsp;It was awful! &nbsp;She was like a child who&#39;d been possessed and I was in a state of shock. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Today it happened again, in the same place, slightly different circumstances. &nbsp;She had just finished with a dance class, I had to get her home to hang out with her dad so I could go to yoga class. &nbsp;Before we even got near the cafe she said she wanted ice cream, I said I&#39;d make her a bowl with a side of chocolates when we got home. &nbsp;Stomping and screaming. &nbsp;I said that&#39;s not ok at all, we had to go, she had a choice to walk or I&#39;d carry her. &nbsp;She screamed she didn&#39;t like choices and she wasn&#39;t going anywhere. &nbsp;I picked her up and she hit and scratched my face, pulled on my ears so hard I thought she ripped an earring out, then pulled out two fistfuls of my hair, all the while screaming and trying to wriggle away. &nbsp;I swung her body so I was hanging onto her waist and she was sideways so she couldn&#39;t reach my head and face and walked her out to the car. &nbsp;She said she wanted to walk and I told her she had that chance and lost it. &nbsp;I put her down so she could climb into the car then closed the door and got in the front seat where I could wait for her to calm down enough to buckle her in. &nbsp;I said again it&#39;s not ok to hit, that she hurt me (she really did! &nbsp;I was surprised my ear wasn&#39;t bleeding) and her behavior was completely unacceptable. &nbsp;I gave her to the count of 3 to get into her car seat on her own and was amazed she did it, then let me buckle her without a fight. &nbsp;As I was buckling her, she said through her sobs that she needed a hug (she&#39;d done the same thing last week), so I paused and we hugged. &nbsp;On the short drive home I reiterated how unacceptable her behavior was, which brought on a fresh bout of sobs - it really upsets her when I&#39;m angry.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>My husband and I are flabbergasted by this behavior and not sure how to react without being unnecessarily punitive. &nbsp;</span></div><div>How do we make the firm point that this is seriously not ok? &nbsp;He was not sure what to do as I basically came home, told him what happened and said you deal with her, and went to yoga. &nbsp;He comforted her as she was quite upset and told her she can&#39;t hit. &nbsp;I said what she needed was comfort so I was glad he was there to do that because I was too angry and needed some space.</div><div><br></div><div>A few things worth considering: common factors in both instances were time limits; she&#39;s decided being 4 means she&#39;s a big kid and sometimes likes that idea and sometimes doesn&#39;t (it was with great concern she asked me last night while nursing in bed if she can still nurse when she&#39;s 4); she&#39;s as tall as a 5 or 6 year old and when in public people sometimes expect more from her than she&#39;s capable of - and maybe I do, too; she&#39;s noticing places where she has power and places where she feels powerless and this can trigger a meltdown; and she&#39;s aware that when she cries I slow down and so she&#39;s increased her fake forced crying lately, which gets under my skin and tests my patience.&nbsp;</div><div><span><br></span></div><div>I don&#39;t want to &quot;give in&quot; to basically shut her up, even though that was my urge today because I was embarrassed by her screams. &nbsp;What else could I have done here? &nbsp;We&#39;ve already decided that next week my husband will come meet us after her class so I can casually go to mine and she doesn&#39;t have to rush, but do we say no ice cream because of your terrible episode previously, or plan to get her some because she loves it and it makes her happy? &nbsp;Both of us feel like we should say before we leave the house that there will be no ice cream at the cafe, but is that a really delayed punishment, a remnant of conventional parenting we haven&#39;t flushed from our systems? &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span>We need your sage advice. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span>If there are clarifying questions, I&#39;ll do my best to respond, otherwise I&#39;ll let the questions that come up percolate in the minds of the readers.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Thank you in advance,</span></div><div><span>cheri</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280507599">Oh also... &quot;I don&#39;t want to &quot;give in&quot; to basically shut her up, even though that was my urge today because I was embarrassed by her screams. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the best things I&#39;ve learnt here is that it&#39;s ok to realise you&#39;ve misjudged a situation, or made the wrong choice in how to deal with something. If you&#39;ve said no, and then realise it wasn&#39;t a well thought out no, or something was more important to your child than you realised, you can still make the other choice. Thoughtfully changing your mind and saying yes is far better for your child and your relationship than sticking to a knee jerk &quot;no&quot; so that you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re giving in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were in McDonalds late last year, and a mum and her approximately-three year old girl were sitting near us. The girl said she was full and she didn&#39;t want any more food. The mum said if she didn&#39;t eat it she&#39;d throw her happy meal toy in the bin. The girl still said she was full so the mum threw the toy in the bin, and the little girl screamed and sobbed her heart out for the next fifteen minutes or so, begging for this toy back. It was so so sad, and I wished more than anything the whole time that the mum would say, actually, I&#39;m sorry, I made the wrong choice there, let&#39;s go get you a replacement toy. There are far worse things in the world than making a different choice to make your child happy, even if you started off a different way.<br/>

    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1793971053ygrp-text">
      
      
      <p></p><p><span>Up until lately, my daughter (who will turn 4 next week) was one of those kids who was totally easy going, never had a tantrum, was a breeze to parent, and being her partner felt like a no brainer most of the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Last week, she really threw me for a loop. &nbsp;We were at a small indoor shopping area that has a great open play and art space for kids, which is perfect for slushy wintry days and she loves it. &nbsp;We were there for a while before leaving to visit family (1.5 hour drive) for a planned event which she was excited about. &nbsp;This shopping area has only one way in and out, and at the entrance/exit is a little cafe that sells gelato, which we frequent from time to time. &nbsp;On this visit last week, I warned her about our dwindling time - which she likes me to do - and when it was time she was happy to leave. &nbsp;As we passed the cafe she said she wanted ice cream and I told her we didn&#39;t have time now but we&#39;d get some later with her grandparents. &nbsp;She stopped in her tracks and screamed at the top of her lungs. &nbsp;She&#39;s never done that before. &nbsp;I spun around, kneeled in front of her, and quietly but sternly said it is not ok to scream like that here. &nbsp;I held her hand as we walked towards the door and she pulled away and walked several steps back the other way, with a look on her face that said &quot;what are you going to do now?&quot;. &nbsp;I tried to grab her hand and she walked several more steps back, so I continued on my way towards the door. &nbsp;I opened the door, at which point she came running and started crying that it&#39;s her job to open doors, and I commented matter-of-factly that she shouldn&#39;t have walked away from me then. &nbsp;Once outside, we had to walk only half block, but the sidewalks were icy/slushy so she wanted to hold my hand but was simultaneously refusing to walk to the car. &nbsp;I asked her if she wanted me to carry her and she screamed no. &nbsp;A bit bewildered, I walked to the car. &nbsp;She started crying again, so I went back for her, but she turned and walked the other way. &nbsp;I told her she could walk to the car or I could carry her and she took a few more steps back so I went and scooped her up and put her in the car. &nbsp;She refused to get in her car seat - at this point screaming nonstop - so I closed the car door and took a minute to calm myself down. &nbsp;I then opened the door and said we had to go, I couldn&#39;t drive without her safely buckled in, and she just kept screaming, and kicking me as I tried to pick her up and put her in her seat. &nbsp;I finally got her in her seat by a combo of picking her up and sort of smooshing her over by taking up the space she had occupied, all the while she&#39;s writhing, kicking and screaming. &nbsp;As I tried to buckle her in, she hit my face with both hands and pulled my hair. &nbsp;I am committed to not yelling, but I was so angry that I kind of growled through my teeth at her &quot;don&#39;t hit me!&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s not ok!&quot;. &nbsp;By the time she was buckled in I was sweating and shaking all over. &nbsp;It was awful! &nbsp;She was like a child who&#39;d been possessed and I was in a state of shock. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Today it happened again, in the same place, slightly different circumstances. &nbsp;She had just finished with a dance class, I had to get her home to hang out with her dad so I could go to yoga class. &nbsp;Before we even got near the cafe she said she wanted ice cream, I said I&#39;d make her a bowl with a side of chocolates when we got home. &nbsp;Stomping and screaming. &nbsp;I said that&#39;s not ok at all, we had to go, she had a choice to walk or I&#39;d carry her. &nbsp;She screamed she didn&#39;t like choices and she wasn&#39;t going anywhere. &nbsp;I picked her up and she hit and scratched my face, pulled on my ears so hard I thought she ripped an earring out, then pulled out two fistfuls of my hair, all the while screaming and trying to wriggle away. &nbsp;I swung her body so I was hanging onto her waist and she was sideways so she couldn&#39;t reach my head and face and walked her out to the car. &nbsp;She said she wanted to walk and I told her she had that chance and lost it. &nbsp;I put her down so she could climb into the car then closed the door and got in the front seat where I could wait for her to calm down enough to buckle her in. &nbsp;I said again it&#39;s not ok to hit, that she hurt me (she really did! &nbsp;I was surprised my ear wasn&#39;t bleeding) and her behavior was completely unacceptable. &nbsp;I gave her to the count of 3 to get into her car seat on her own and was amazed she did it, then let me buckle her without a fight. &nbsp;As I was buckling her, she said through her sobs that she needed a hug (she&#39;d done the same thing last week), so I paused and we hugged. &nbsp;On the short drive home I reiterated how unacceptable her behavior was, which brought on a fresh bout of sobs - it really upsets her when I&#39;m angry.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>My husband and I are flabbergasted by this behavior and not sure how to react without being unnecessarily punitive. &nbsp;</span></p><p>How do we make the firm point that this is seriously not ok? &nbsp;He was not sure what to do as I basically came home, told him what happened and said you deal with her, and went to yoga. &nbsp;He comforted her as she was quite upset and told her she can&#39;t hit. &nbsp;I said what she needed was comfort so I was glad he was there to do that because I was too angry and needed some space.</p><p><br></p><p>A few things worth considering: common factors in both instances were time limits; she&#39;s decided being 4 means she&#39;s a big kid and sometimes likes that idea and sometimes doesn&#39;t (it was with great concern she asked me last night while nursing in bed if she can still nurse when she&#39;s 4); she&#39;s as tall as a 5 or 6 year old and when in public people sometimes expect more from her than she&#39;s capable of - and maybe I do, too; she&#39;s noticing places where she has power and places where she feels powerless and this can trigger a meltdown; and she&#39;s aware that when she cries I slow down and so she&#39;s increased her fake forced crying lately, which gets under my skin and tests my patience.&nbsp;</p><p><span><br></span></p><p>I don&#39;t want to &quot;give in&quot; to basically shut her up, even though that was my urge today because I was embarrassed by her screams. &nbsp;What else could I have done here? &nbsp;We&#39;ve already decided that next week my husband will come meet us after her class so I can casually go to mine and she doesn&#39;t have to rush, but do we say no ice cream because of your terrible episode previously, or plan to get her some because she loves it and it makes her happy? &nbsp;Both of us feel like we should say before we leave the house that there will be no ice cream at the cafe, but is that a really delayed punishment, a remnant of conventional parenting we haven&#39;t flushed from our systems? &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span>We need your sage advice. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If there are clarifying questions, I&#39;ll do my best to respond, otherwise I&#39;ll let the questions that come up percolate in the minds of the readers.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Thank you in advance,</span></p><p><span>cheri</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334299319">&lt;. What else could I have done here? We&#39;ve already decided that next week my husband will come meet us after her class so I can casually go to mine and she doesn&#39;t have to rush, but do we say no ice cream because of your terrible episode previously, or plan to get her some because she loves it and it makes her happy? Both of us feel like we should say before we leave the house that there will be no ice cream at the cafe, but is that a really delayed punishment, a remnant of conventional parenting we haven&#39;t flushed from our systems? &gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s no time for ice cream after, you could warn her ahead of time. I would make a plan before you leave home when she&#39;s calm. Remember last time when you lost control? Will it help you feel calm if we go early to get ice cream, or if we pack a yummy treat for the car ride after? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You may find out it wasn&#39;t about the ice cream but that she just needed more time to play (and you are already solving that by having dad meet her there.). I wouldn&#39;t tie getting ice cream to her behavior. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She is still very young! It sounds like she needs help learning to deal with transitions and disappointments. She needs to know you are her safe go-to person. If you respond by saying no ice cream cause you did that- she&#39;s not going to feel connected with you. She may feel misunderstood and unreasonably punished. And ice cream becomes this glorified thing you only get when you are a good girl!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 There are times as a mom when I have had a schedule to keep, but I see that my young child just can&#39;t keep up. These times, if I did not plan well enough to accommodate my kids, I have sometimes chosen to let go of my plans. When you notice your daughter is losing it, it&#39;s ok to let go of your time schedule and get down on her level, look into her eyes and connect with her. This alone is sometimes enough to shift things in both of you. But if her needs are really big, you might be late to class or miss class in order to connect with your child in need. And then next time, you plan better. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Warmly, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-364865209">Just remembering that in the very first part of the post Cheri wrote how much of a &quot;no-brainer&quot; it had been until now to partner her daughter, which to me means that in the past maybe she had accepted a &quot;no, we don&#39;t have time today&quot; response? I know that my newly 3 year old would accept that okay. not so my older kids, but there&#39;s been plenty of yeses to things in the past year that they&#39;re much more likely to be okay with a &quot;not today there&#39;s no time/money&quot; for that because they&#39;re confident there will be a next time (not so a year or so ago though when I had much stricter limits).<div><br></div><div>So maybe there has been no need to do anything differently if &quot;partnering&quot; means that she always fitted in with whatever was convenient at that moment? Its when its NOT convenient or when the parent must change plans (eg. drop yoga that day or be late or allow more time or stop for just a minute or two two buy an ice cream and be a bit late for the family get together &nbsp;- does that matter? - or whatever... ).... or really think through situations in advance that the partnering becomes a more thought out and mindful practice.</div><div><br></div><div>I know in moments when I have said no to something when I could have said yes its often because I am preoccupied, rushed, feeling like I have said YES to absolutely everything lately and feel like a doormat, and then I sort of do a 180 and say NO just because. No good reason and that&#39;s not where I want to be and it reminds me how far I have to go on this unschooling journey.</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260718415">I think the basic issue is she&#39;s changing. You want her to be happy. Unintentionally your focus is getting her *back* to the happy person she was before. But there is no back. There&#39;s only forward. Her triggers have changed. They might change again but they won&#39;t go back.<br/>
<br/>
So shift your focus to figuring out what her new triggers are. Don&#39;t try to reason with her when she&#39;s melted down. Emotions don&#39;t respond well to reason. It tends to get them more upset ;-) In the moment comfort, changing the situation, backing up to give her what she wants are better options.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry -- as conventional parents will warn you -- that responding to a melt down will teach her bad habits. If you wait for a melt down to give in, yes, she will learn to melt down to get what she wants. But that whole mode of thinking is several giant steps away from mindful parenting. Shift to meeting her needs before she needs to melt down to get her point across!<br/>
<br/>
Right now you&#39;re in a time of change so you don&#39;t know her new needs. A melt down is communication. Something new triggered it. It&#39;s your job to be a detective. :-) Discover what change age has made in her so you can meet her new needs.<br/>
