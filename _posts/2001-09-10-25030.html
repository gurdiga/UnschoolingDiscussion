<br/>
This may have already been suggested, but I don&#39;t get much &#39;puter time over the <br/>
weekends so I have something like 14 digests still waiting to be read, but I <br/>
didn&#39;t want my thoughts to get away from me.<br/>
<br/>
How about reminding your budding authors that most/if not all authors have <br/>
proof-readers that go over the writing after it&#39;s all done and check for those <br/>
little errors that sometimes get missed.  The first thing they (our little <br/>
writers) need to do is get those ideas on paper!!!  Then if the spelling <br/>
bothers them they can go back over what they wrote and maybe make little marks <br/>
next to the words they feel are mis-spelled.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I see at least two, maybe three, options... type just those words in a <br/>
word processing program and see what corrections it comes up with, use a small <br/>
dictionary to look up the words of concern, or use one of the previously <br/>
mentioned spell-checkers to fix just the words of concern.   Then if they are <br/>
still worried maybe they can &quot;hire&quot; mom, dad or an older sibling to be their <br/>
proof-reader - just for spelling.  In most dictionaries there is a page with <br/>
proof-reader marks and what they mean... the &quot;employee&quot; could then use these to <br/>
make spelling suggestions...<br/>
<br/>
When my older kids (now graduated from high school and college) were in 2nd <br/>
grade ps they encouraged &quot;creative writing&quot;.  As a professional secretary that <br/>
spells everything right - at that time it drove me nuts... nothing was spelled <br/>
right!!!  But as I relaxed... and my perfect spelling daughter relaxed ... I <br/>
discovered that the kids really did learn how to write more creatively when <br/>
they weren&#39;t worrying about the spelling when they were writing... the grammar <br/>
checking and spelling checking came later.  And they had friends help them with <br/>
that... <br/>
<br/>
Just sharing some ps experience that may help in this situation.  Now I have a <br/>
14 yo unschooler who never lets me see his writing, but he does it all the <br/>
time... and uses the dictionary like crazy...  <br/>
<br/>
Hope these suggestions help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks. I have offered, and she&#39;s heard myepraise proofreaders and<br/>
editors whenever I have to send in a piece for publication. :-) She<br/>
rarely wants to take the trouble to recopy stuff, so we haven&#39;t done it<br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
I guess one thing that this thread has helped me to clarify in my own<br/>
mind is that the problem really has nothing to do with spelling - I know<br/>
she&#39;ll do that competently in her own time, and I&#39;m not worried about it.<br/>
The issue for me is more that she&#39;s not doing something she enjoyed<br/>
because someone gave her a hard time about not being good at a (small)<br/>
part of it. This could just as easily have been her not wanting to play<br/>
softball anymore (which she really started playing last summmer in a<br/>
parks and rec league, and loves, and she&#39;s a really powerful hitter)<br/>
because some kid made a hurtful comment about the weakness of her<br/>
throwing arm. <br/>
<br/>
So maybe I&#39;ve done enough, and as she slowly has more good experiences<br/>
around writing maybe she&#39;ll stop prefacing introductions to read her work<br/>
with &quot;The spelling is horrible but I don&#39;t care.&quot; Maybe she needs to come<br/>
to terms with this one on her own :-/<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400791006">My kids have just gotten better at spelling on their own without my teaching<br/>
them anything.  The thing that helped my youngest the most was giving her<br/>
her own email account.  But both girls (8 and 10) have improved in spelling<br/>
on their own by asking repeatedly how things are spelled.  If they ask often<br/>
enough, they remember.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923648791">My husband went to public school and some college, and got a trades-school <br/>
certificate (mathish stuff, mostly), and when I met him he spelled way worse <br/>
than ANY of my kids do now (at 13, 16, 18) who&#39;ve not studied spelling.<br/>
<br/>
Spelling lessons made things worse for him.  And spelling lessons made him <br/>
stop even trying.   We made a deal when we were in our early 20&#39;s (long before <br/>
having children) that he could ask me to spell a word and I would never shame <br/>
him or say &quot;I just told you&quot; or anything but just spell it, and in exchange, I <br/>
could ask him any math &quot;fact&quot; and he would just tell me, no questions no &quot;you <br/>
can figure that out&quot; or &quot;you should know that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Over the years he got way better at spelling.  I got a little better at math. <br/>
 He still misspells a word sometimes.  He wants &quot;coming&quot; to have two m&#39;s.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; How do you teach spelling while unschooling? My daughter is really <br/>
<br/>
struggling and it is frustrating for her. Any suggestions? She is in <br/>
<br/>
4th grade.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t teach anything while unschooling.  If I taught things, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
feel I was unschooling at all.  I do answer lots of questions.  My kids know <br/>
stories about the history of English, and WHY words are spelled as they are in <br/>
some cases.  Knowing there are stories behind spellings and knowing there are <br/>
patterns helps, but I didn&#39;t tell them those stories to teach them spelling, I <br/>
told them because it was part of answering a question and it was interesting.<br/>
<br/>
E-mail and instant messages and online text-based games helped my  kids with <br/>
spelling more than anything else.  More than everything else put together so <br/>
far.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s in 4th grade...<br/>
Are you not an unschooler?  <br/>
<br/>
If you think of her as being in 4th grade instead of thinking of her as being <br/>
nine or ten years old, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re thinking she should know 4th grade <br/>
spelling words.  In the real world, in the absence of school, there is no <br/>
such thing as a 4th grade spelling word.<br/>
