&lt;&lt; We are unschooling an only child, 3.5 years, and I look forward to his<br/>
 independence as it seems your son has at 6 &gt;&gt;<br/>

Shannon, glad to meet another USr (unschooler) of a three year old, in a <br/>
one-child family.  Ben&#39;s birthday was August 30.  Do you have children much <br/>
much older, is your 3.5 year old the one child you have? I have friends who <br/>
don&#39;t much like the term &quot;only&quot;, and I agree, much in the same way some of my <br/>
adoptive mother friends object to adopt-a-highway campaigns. <br/>

&lt;&lt;  But there <br/>
 are other personal, emotional issues that go into the decision to add to <br/>
 one&#39;s family that need to be considered. It is difficult to weigh all the <br/>
 options sometimes. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Olivia, thank you for sharing.  I am new to the list and appreciate getting <br/>
to know everyone.  I agree with your comment above that the option-weighing <br/>
process with regard to future children is challenging.  I / we have to weigh <br/>
the desire for sharing a pregnancy-birth-new sibling experience with each <br/>
other and our son, with the fact that fertility treatments are very expensive <br/>
and emotionally exhausting. For some, adding children is a surprise or a <br/>
no-brainer (comes without a thought), and I am in serious envy!! Anyway, I <br/>
wish you well in your decision making and peace of mind with the way things <br/>
are going.<br/>

As I remember it, there was very little thinking required. I know there was<br/>
champagne involved, though. Maybe that&#39;s what causes it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello to all,<br/>
<br/>
I also have an &#39;only&#39; son, he is 3.10 y/o.  We don&#39;t plan on additional<br/>
children for several reasons, but I still have occasional guilt pangs.<br/>
There are times I would so love for Graham to have a sibling, but for the<br/>
most part I&#39;ve got all I can handle with just one child.  I have taken a lot<br/>
of criticism from the extended family about the only child situation, and<br/>
they don&#39;t even know about our homeschooling plans- LOL!  Fortunately my<br/>
immediate family is so completely thrilled to have Graham around that they<br/>
never seem to feel a need for something more.  (Not that other children<br/>
would be unwelcome.)  It is nice to find other parents who unschool an<br/>
&#39;only&#39;, it does seem a little frightening at times, and it&#39;s so helpful to<br/>
have the support!<br/>
