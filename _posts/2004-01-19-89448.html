prejudice from the Baptists (and other protestant groups) AGAINST the <br/>
Catholics than the other way around. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
True, and their anger was 400 years outdated, for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up Baptist in a very Catholic town in Northern New Mexico, and the <br/>
kids at the parochial school had been told it was a sin to enter a protestant <br/>
church.  They could ask for an exception for a wedding or funeral, but not for a <br/>
regular service.<br/>
<br/>
I had permission to play the organ at my church any time, and once when we <br/>
were old enough to drive my best friend and I were out and bored and I wanted to <br/>
show her the organ.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;church time&quot; and I tried to explain to her <br/>
that it was just a building, not sanctified like the Catholic church.  I finally <br/>
convinced her to come in but she was nervous as a cat, and kept looking over <br/>
her shoulder the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
I traded Bibles with her once so we could see what the differences were.  <br/>
About ten minutes later she was at the door saying her mom said we had to trade <br/>
back right away.<br/>
<br/>
Our fourth grade teacher was the chatechism teacher of the kids in our class <br/>
who were Catholic.  One day some of them informed us they had just learned <br/>
they were going to heaven and the rest of us (protestants) weren&#39;t.  We protested <br/>
(being protestants &lt;g&gt;) but they said it was true, that Miss Gonzales told <br/>
them so.<br/>
<br/>
She showed up late after lunch that day and we were in the throes of nine <br/>
year old religious wars and she had to talk her way out of it.  <br/>
<br/>
I still remember that day, the way the sky was, and the way the room was. <br/>
None of us had turned the light on when we came in and it was clouding up fast <br/>
outside, so the room was getting darker and darker and I was about to cry <br/>
because I KNEW Miss Gonzales liked me and I knew (from church) that I was more <br/>
likely to go to heaven than these Catholic kids were.   ROUGH DAY!! <br/>

Although I think Sandra was just being sarcastic (jokingly), you are right.  <br/>
I&#39;m a convert to Catholicism and I have never heard at Mass that the <br/>
evangelical church members are doomed to hell.  I have, on the other hand, heard <br/>
Catholics are on their way to hell in a bobsled by numerous <br/>
evangelical/fundamentalist denominations, my entire life.  Oh well,...<br/>

spent in Catholic school back in my &#39;island&#39; days and the 20+ year I <br/>
lived as a Catholic. And at the school, it was quite the international <br/>
group, with priests and nuns from Spain and Ireland and the US. So it <br/>
was not just a &quot;Puerto Rican&quot; thing.<br/>

This is very interesting to me. I grew up catholic. Schools, church,<br/>
rituals, the whole bit. I never once remember hearing that anyone else but<br/>
*us* was going to hell. I don&#39;t remember ever hearing that *others* were<br/>
less than us. We were planted in our catholic beliefs rather strongly, but<br/>
not so that others were ever thought wrong. I also never heard the word<br/>
Christian when referring to us. We were catholics, not christians. I learned<br/>
from catholic nuns, priests and teachers that the bible was only a story not<br/>
to be taken literally. I also learned about Buddhists, atheists, agnostics,<br/>
etc. while in catholic school.<br/>
<br/>
I never really thought my catholic upbringing was that much different than<br/>
other catholics. Not sure if it was my little area I lived in or not.<br/>

don&#39;t go asking me to quote anything as I am just not good at that stuff. I <br/>
know what I believe but I never force it on anyone, in fact they would have to <br/>
ask me for me to share much of anything. I&#39;ve always felt like being Catholic <br/>
is kind of like a private religion, at least it has been for me.<br/>

Catholicism. The brand of Catholicism that happens here in the US has <br/>
sometimes very little to do with what happens in Europe or Latin <br/>
America. US catholics are deemed as &#39;affected&#39; by protestantism by <br/>
catholics elsewhere.<br/>
