<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268667576"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So, I am going to pick one thing that is really <br/>
&gt; causing a lot of stress, upset, and emotional turmoil in our home right now.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>snip<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Video games.   Yes, both of my sons ( 7 and 11) love them.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>snip<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, Ethan threw the controller on the Xbox within a week of getting it.. I<br/>
&gt; bought a new one ( to the suggestion of list members).. He threw it and broke<br/>
&gt; it in less than 2 weeks..  We had to wait another 2 weeks to get one .. (<br/>
&gt; money and time issues).. So, I bought a new one. He broke it the next day.<br/>
&gt; OK.. in the mean time.. I had also bought ANOTHER N64 to help with the<br/>
&gt; &quot;sharing&quot; problem.   There were a total of 5 controllers for N64.. Now, we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; down to 1.. Either Ethan or JP broke all of them.   They love the action of<br/>
&gt; playing the games.. BUT, neither of them can take the frustration of losing<br/>
&gt; or not &quot;getting&quot; what they want in the game.  They scream, cry, cuss, throw<br/>
&gt; things.   Hit each other, basically throw INTENSE temper tantrums.  I have<br/>
&gt; tried to play the games with them..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This last part is simply what I would do. Explain that because the<br/>
controllers keep getting broken and you can&#39;t afford to keep buying new<br/>
ones, that you&#39;re going to help them learn to calm down enough not to break<br/>
them when they play.<br/>
<br/>
Sit right next to the one playing, and if he looks like he&#39;s about to lose<br/>
it, be ready to catch the throwing arm. :) Keep the controllers with you<br/>
otherwise, and make as much time as you can (and hopefully as your husband<br/>
can) to play with them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;( also, they tend to get<br/>
&gt; frustrated with games and I have to continually buy new ( used) ones)..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is only a problem if it is not affordable and is cutting into other<br/>
things the family needs and wants. If this is the case, an allowance for<br/>
everyone in the house may help, and if they have enough to buy a game, fine,<br/>
if not, time to save up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thier days are rounds of playing, screaming, crying, tantrums. more playing..<br/>
&gt; They are NOT interested in anything else.. I have to MAKE.. yes.. MAKE,<br/>
&gt; physically pick up or manuever them to go out  with me.  Its not a good idea<br/>
&gt; to leave a 7 and 11 yo at home alone and its not fair for the Anna and I to<br/>
&gt; stay home all the time.. I try to do most of my &quot;outside&quot; stuff when my<br/>
&gt; oldest son gets home or my husband so they boys can stay.. But, I cant do it<br/>
&gt; ALL after 3:00.. Anna wants to go to band, the library, other homeschool<br/>
&gt; activites.  Its a BIG TIME &quot;struggle&quot; ( and thats a mild word)  to get them<br/>
&gt; to stop playing video games for anything..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has little to do with the specifics of video games and much to do with<br/>
the frustration in any family over scheduling. We are lucky that my husband<br/>
and I both work at home, so when Brit wants to go with me on errands and<br/>
Mikey does not, it&#39;s very easy to leave Mikey at home with Dad. If we did<br/>
not have that, we would have to work out compromises.<br/>
<br/>
One compromise might be hand-held games for the boys they can take with them<br/>
(once they&#39;ve gotten beyond the throwing things stage, perhaps). The library<br/>
is probably open after 3 p.m. some days? If Anna can be dropped off with<br/>
another Mom at some activities (or, better yet, picked up by another Mom at<br/>
your door) you can ask for that kind of help and can stay more often where<br/>
the boys want to be. In any family, these things will be a balancing act at<br/>
some points.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  You know, if they were happily<br/>
&gt; playing,  loving every minute of it.. at least I could understand why they<br/>
&gt; dont want to stop to go somewhere ( thats the only time I make them stop..<br/>
&gt; not to eat, sleep or &quot;anything&quot; else)   But they are NOT happy at least half<br/>
&gt; the time they are playing.. They are mad, angry, flailing about throwing<br/>
&gt; tantrums, breaking stuff, fighting each other.  WHAT THE HELL IS FUN ABOUT<br/>
&gt; THAT??? Or.. what is being &quot;learned&quot;??  Its nothing but a terriblly<br/>
&gt; exhaustive stress on me and them and thier sibs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do they never have any kind of tantrums or fighting ever except over video<br/>
games? Ever? I am pretty sure the answer is that they have trouble with<br/>
impulse control (not necessarily surprising in a couple of boys of their<br/>
ages, though not universal) and that you&#39;re just seeing more of it with<br/>
video games -- perhaps because you don&#39;t like video game playing, perhaps<br/>
because since that&#39;s their main activity at the moment it would naturally be<br/>
where you would see it, perhaps because it&#39;s new and very important to them<br/>
their emotions run higher there than anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
But as for what they are learning: they are learning how to handle<br/>
frustration. If you leave them to their own devices, they will learn poorly<br/>
(learning to throw the controls, learning to brangle with each other). If<br/>
you are right there to protect property and life and limb, to prevent them<br/>
from assaulting each other or the game itself, they can learn (perhaps not a<br/>
quickly as you&#39;d like) how to be more controlled in their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
It might also help to have you and your husband start playing the games they<br/>
like. You will play badly &lt;g&gt;. There&#39;s no helping that, the only way to play<br/>
as well as they do will be to play as often as they do, which will probably<br/>
not happen. Ask for their help. If you get to a stuck point where they&#39;ve<br/>
already succeeded and they can take the controls and show you what to do,<br/>
all the better.<br/>
