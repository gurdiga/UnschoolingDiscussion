&lt;&lt; What is your typical day is like?<br/>
 If you use any curriculum, what do you use?<br/>
 Are there groups or co-ops in the Twin City area for unschoolers?<br/>
 How do unschoolers score on the mandatory standardized tests? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Typical day? No such thing.<br/>
<br/>
No curriculum....unless you count passion and interest as curriculum!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Which state are you in? There is more than one Twin City area in the U.S. and <br/>
this is an international list.<br/>
<br/>
And I have no idea how unschoolers would/could score on tests, since we don&#39;t <br/>
view them as mandatory and will never, ever test unless for some weird reason <br/>
my children requested it.<br/>
