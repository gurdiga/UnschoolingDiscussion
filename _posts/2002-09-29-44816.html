&lt;&lt; I&#39;m simply not buying what they don&#39;t need. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But what one person needs is extravagance to another.  Each person has to <br/>
decide what they need for themselves.<br/>
The family budget does affect these things....but within that framework of <br/>
budget, I think kids should have their own money they can spend on whatever <br/>
they want. And I believe parents should not decide what they need or don&#39;t <br/>
need unless it has to do with safety and awareness.<br/>
A three year old that wants to cook should not have a butcher knife bought <br/>
for them, to use whenever they want. But the parent could buy a safer knife, <br/>
and/or purchase it with the foreknowledge that it could only be used with <br/>
supervision.<br/>
Ah, but that&#39;s theoretical. <br/>
I think the best way to &quot;teach&quot; budgeting and consumer awareness is to give <br/>
them money and access. Lead by telling them your opinion on a product, but <br/>
let them find out for themselves without the shame and guilt attached to <br/>
making mistakes.<br/>
We have to make our own mistakes with money. <br/>
Kids need to be given the freedom to make their own too.<br/>
Eventually, they become very aware and very good with money....in their own <br/>
way.<br/>
