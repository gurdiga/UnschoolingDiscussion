Back home the town would make a big may-pole and we&#39;d go and dance round it. I wonder how that would go down in Stepford ;-) there would be a May Day parade too. And possibly drinking...<br/>

Tomorrow will be the big day for our local homeschooling group.  That, and<br/>
the not back to school picnic on the first day of school, are the big events<br/>
of the year for us.  My granddaughter will be dancing in the may-pole dance<br/>
as well as with her Renaissance dance troup.  Some of the kids will be<br/>
playing music.  And everyone will just play and yak all afternoon.  One year<br/>
the hostess made some spiked punch, but the teens got into it.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
