<div id="ygrps-yiv-196850468">Nope, I&#39;ve been on this list long enough to know that folks absolutely NEVER<br/>
agree on everything.  And, I wasn&#39;t interested in the book, per se, but in<br/>
the book burning statement.  I find that folks that think any book that<br/>
doesn&#39;t teach a particular view should then be burned are a bit on the<br/>
nutcake side.  If they start with this book, what book is next?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel that any text should &quot;advise&quot; kids to write to their whatevers.<br/>
I do think that science should be taught as science and not from a political<br/>
or economic standpoint.  Politics and economics are variables, science is<br/>
not.  Acid rain is acid rain and what causes it causes it.<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, think kids should know that they have an option of contacting<br/>
their representatives because I think they aren&#39;t a sub-species that have no<br/>
rights until they are 18.  AND, I think a lot of those kids are quite<br/>
intelligent enough to make informed decisions and exercise that right, which<br/>
is one of the reasons I unschool.  I think children are simply small people<br/>
and don&#39;t think that type of intelligence is limited until they reach that<br/>
magic age of 18.  In fact, I quite frequently find that they have a much<br/>
better grasp on things that most of the politicians out there who seem only<br/>
to grasp how much money will line their own pockets rather than what the<br/>
facts are on any given subject.<br/>

&gt; Anyone in Texas know if this nut got his bonfire?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think Texas is one of the states where the state board of education<br/>
&gt; chooses the textbooks for the whole state so someone who can convince<br/>
those<br/>
&gt; doing the choosing can influence a whole humongous state -- and the<br/>
thinking<br/>
&gt; of a whole passle of future voters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Environmentalism is a hot point with conservatives since conservatives are<br/>
&gt; generally for strong local government and minimal national government. And<br/>
&gt; environmental policies are generally a national government issue. So more<br/>
&gt; environmentalism means more national control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the kids not being qualified, he has a point. Are the kids being<br/>
&gt; presented with opposing viewpoints on environmental issues so they can<br/>
&gt; decide for themselves or are they being fed a single viewpoint?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To someone who feels environmentalism is too obvious to be questioned,<br/>
&gt; presenting kids with the causes of acid rain and the effects of acid rain<br/>
&gt; would seem to be giving them a complete picture. (Of course, since schools<br/>
&gt; divide information into neat compartments, it *is* a complete *science*<br/>
&gt; picture. Since it&#39;s a science class they can&#39;t discuss the economic or<br/>
&gt; political aspects of the issue. Those must be confined to separate<br/>
classes.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But if the kids were being presented with an obvious conservative point in<br/>
&gt; government class, such as gun ownership is a constitutionally mandated<br/>
right<br/>
&gt; clearly stated in the second amendment, and it was suggested they all<br/>
write<br/>
&gt; to their congressional representative about preserving that right, I<br/>
suspect<br/>
&gt; liberals would find it appalling. It would look like mind control. It<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; look like a state trying to mold an entire generation of future voters<br/>
&gt; towards a single viewpoint. It wouldn&#39;t look at all like kids asking their<br/>
&gt; congressional representative to represent them. It would look like someone<br/>
&gt; getting all the kids in the state to follow a single political agenda. It<br/>
&gt; would look really really scary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But anytime kids are fed a single viewpoint it&#39;s scary. Unfortunately<br/>
&gt; schools weren&#39;t designed to offer information with more than one view<br/>
point.<br/>
&gt; How many viewpoints can their be to 5+12 and here&#39;s how to spell &quot;cat&quot;?<br/>
They<br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t designed to teach kids how to think, how to weigh issues, how to<br/>
&gt; come to their own conclusions. The were designed to give kids a basic<br/>
&gt; framework of practical math, reading, writing, some history.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The information schools impart has expanded well beyond that, but the<br/>
&quot;just<br/>
&gt; memorize the facts&quot; approach and mentality hasn&#39;t changed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I bet you were expecting a slew of &quot;Boy, I agree with you, what a nut<br/>
&gt; case!&quot; ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978100180">Someone wrote to me on the side.  I thought the question was fun, so I <br/>
answered it privately but I&#39;m putting it here too.  Since there are <br/>
umpty-hundred people on the list, I don&#39;t figure it will embarrass anyone <br/>
that a private question gets put public without a name one it.  Possibly <br/>
others of you thought the same question.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is that really what you meant to say?<br/>
Who creates the exam?   Who grades it?<br/>
Who decides what the issues are and what clues count?   Who decides who get <br/>
the<br/>
job of creating and grading the exam?   Could we just say an accredited high<br/>
school diploma would qualify someone?    Need to be accredited by a particular<br/>
state or by association of religious schools?-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really what I meant to say.<br/>
<br/>
I know it will never happen.<br/>
<br/>
Leage of Women Voters could make the questions.  An 8th grade civics class, <br/>
or the editor of the local paper could make the questions.<br/>
<br/>
But when  a person goes in and just votes no across the board on all bond <br/>
issues and mil taxes, or when a person goes in and pulls levers by apparent <br/>
ethnicity of last name, or votes against all women, that&#39;s vandalism in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
If I haven&#39;t read what the various mayoral candidates have said and written, <br/>
I have no business voting for mayor.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Could we just say an accredited high<br/>
school diploma would qualify someone?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WHY?  Does graduating from high school in 1980  mean a person knows who&#39;s <br/>
running for the senate twenty years later?<br/>
<br/>
It should be like a sobriety test.  If you really can&#39;t name the candidates <br/>
or don&#39;t know who the incumbent is, go home.<br/>

at the time.  He actually made himself a voters registration card and got<br/>
a ballot.  Any way, there were these guys behind us in the line looking<br/>
at their ballot asking, &quot; Who are all these guys?  They&#39;re all running<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-91835689">Precisely!!!!!!!!!  It makes me absolutely nuts to stand in line waiting for<br/>
my ballot and listen to folks chit chat with their friends.  The big social<br/>
hour and &quot;what do you know about blah, blah,&quot; to which friend replies, &quot;oh,<br/>
I don&#39;t know but the man on telelvision was so handsome and seemed to know<br/>
what he was talking about.&quot;  AND, I have actually heard this conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Scarey!!!<br/>
<br/>
Or the &quot;my parents voted the Republican ticket so I am going to vote the<br/>
Republican ticket.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That same mentality is keeping a politician in office, collecting a salary<br/>
(o.k. so they voted the salary in half) while he is in jail for molesting<br/>
two children!  He gets to stay in office as long as he doesn&#39;t conduct any<br/>
business from the jail.  Geez Louise, and some folks wonder why people are<br/>
so disgusted with politicians and politics!<br/>

&gt; &gt;And yet, if I found myself in the possession of an Ezzo or Fulgate book<br/>
I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt;be tempted to -- and might actually -- drop it in the trash rather than<br/>
let<br/>
&gt; &gt;it fall into the hands of some poor innocent at the library book sale.<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;had serious thoughts about other books I&#39;ve donated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know who Ezzo is (&#39;scuse me while I puke) but who or what is Fulgate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And if I could get my hands on all the Ezzo and Fulgate books, I might be<br/>
&gt; &gt;sorely tempted!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My tactic would more likely be to write my own opinions right in the book<br/>
&gt; and then pass it on.<br/>
