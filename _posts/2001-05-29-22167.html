<div id="ygrps-yiv-566610500">&lt;&lt; Do you have informaitonal links that you<br/>
could post or can you briefly tell us more.  As I am<br/>
becoming more hermit-like myself I may not follow<br/>
through, but my child has interests that I&#39;ve seen in<br/>
parades and such with 4H banners (he has a horse,<br/>
goat, rabbits, we have chickens, dogs, cats, etc.) and<br/>
at county fairs (haven&#39;t been myself in years, but<br/>
children have).  Do you have to start your own<br/>
interest group or what&gt;&gt;<br/>
Sharon--I know that 4H does have websites--I don&#39;t have the link off-hand. They are part of your county extension service.There&#39;s projects for all kinds of things--animals, beginning laundry(yes, it&#39;s true), rocketry, geneology, cooking, creative writing and so on... My older dd is taking dog obedience for the 3rd year, and the younger one is taking Memories Partner--a project with her grandmother.  <br/>
My older dd also has a horse, but won&#39;t be doing 4H with him.  She&#39;s interested in non-violent animal training and is working with both the dogs and horse in this way.<br/>
  We joined an already functioning group--there are 52 kids in the club, but you can start your own, too.  <br/>
 When we begin the art project, I&#39;ll post pictures--right now we&#39;re in the planning stages.<br/>
  Time to go outside!!! It&#39;s not raining !!!!!! <br/>
