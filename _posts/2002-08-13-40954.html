<div id="ygrps-yiv-726642679">Ok, I know this is completely off topic.....BUT<br/>
While reading this post I just couldn&#39;t help but reach over my head and grab<br/>
my ear!  Am I insane?  (be nice &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Actually I find that when reading books I sorta act out some things, for<br/>
example if I read a passage that says &quot;David scowled...&quot;  I may find myself<br/>
making a scowling type face.  Anyone else does this or notice this about<br/>
someone else?!?!?!  Please tell me I am not alone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732942253">Nope, you&#39;re not {alone, that is.  I can&#39;t vouch for the &quot;insane&quot; part     :o)   }.  I even hear the different voices in my head for the characters as I read, complete with accents.  When people speak, I can &quot;see&quot; their words just behind my eyes.  The fonts differ from person to person.  When I read in your post about scowling, *I* scowled.  I suspect it is strongly linked to learning styles and personality -- DH thinks all this is nuts.  When he reads to the kids, he reads in monotone (although he is trying hard to improve that).  I, on the other hand, get so immersed in a story that if I am interrupted, I cannot immediately respond -- I need to take a few seconds to reacquaint myself with the reality around me.  I wonder if that has even a little bit to do with how differently people react to some posts.  It would make interesting research (or at least, interesting musings over hot chocolate on a snowy, overcast day).   Debi<br/>
