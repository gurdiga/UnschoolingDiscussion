<br/>
ABBY: You printed a letter from &quot;Beaten Down in Oklahoma,&quot;   <br/>
who said that although she had a history of severe   <br/>
depression, her verbally abusive husband refused to allow   <br/>
her to get medication &quot;because he didn&#39;t believe in it.&quot; He   <br/>
told her she was &quot;worthless&quot; and said he only kept her   <br/>
around so he could be near the kids. That letter could have   <br/>
been written by me five years ago.   <br/>
<br/>
I was nine years into a physically and emotionally abusive   <br/>
marriage. I heard the same things from my husband. And   <br/>
afterward, when he was trying to make up, he too always   <br/>
said he &quot;didn&#39;t mean it.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Well, it turned out he did mean it. Once he found his next   <br/>
victim -- a younger woman -- he walked out. As he left, he   <br/>
announced it was because everything he&#39;d said had been the   <br/>
truth. I was ugly, fat, worthless, lousy in bed, and he&#39;d   <br/>
only stayed because he wanted to be around the kids.   <br/>
<br/>
You should have advised &quot;Beaten Down&quot; to see a lawyer in   <br/>
addition to a counselor, while she still has a shred of   <br/>
self-esteem. Following my divorce, I got counseling. Once   <br/>
I felt better about myself, I met a wonderful man. We&#39;re   <br/>
married now. I wish I could give &quot;Beaten Down&quot; a hug,   <br/>
because she&#39;s not alone. She&#39;s in my prayers.   <br/>

<br/>
FULL OF HOPE: I heard from many readers who identified with   <br/>
that letter and felt it was important for her to break away.   <br/>
Read on:   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ABBY: A husband who tells his wife she&#39;s worthless and   <br/>
stupid is using verbal abuse to wear her down and control   <br/>
her. Marriage counseling and psychiatrists won&#39;t help. The   <br/>
man has low self-esteem and tries to make himself appear   <br/>
powerful and intelligent by making his wife feel inadequate.   <br/>
Every day she stays with him is far more harmful to the   <br/>
children than taking them and leaving. Abuse is not always   <br/>
physical. She needs to get out BEFORE it becomes physical.   <br/>

DIANE: It&#39;s true; children model their behavior on what   <br/>
they&#39;re exposed to.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Life&#39;s challenges are not supposed to paralyze you;<br/>
They&#39;re supposed to help you discover who you are. <br/>
