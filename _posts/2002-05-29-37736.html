&lt;&lt; .  I guess <br/>
 part of my hesitation with the strewing thing is the effect of family <br/>
 &quot;peer pressure&quot;.  How can you be sure they are not just doing what <br/>
 they think you want or trying to please you? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How on Earth is any &quot;pressure&quot; involved by making items available?<br/>
It sounds like this is arguing just for the sake of arguing...not to actually <br/>
understand anything.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is getting into arguing hypotheticals. We can &quot;what if&quot; these types of<br/>
situations to death.  But what we can&#39;t do is explore the *whys* of the<br/>
situation:<br/>
<br/>
Why is this child a people pleaser? What&#39;s his home life like? Are his<br/>
parents verging on divorce and he&#39;s trying to make everyone happy? Is he<br/>
just imagining this based on something he overheard?<br/>
<br/>
No matter how reasonable a hypothetical situation sounds, it&#39;s foundation<br/>
isn&#39;t real people with real motives based in real situations.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if someone has a real child who is a people pleaser and you&#39;re worried<br/>
that he is following interests to satisify your needs instead of his own,<br/>
then please speak up and we can offer real discussion and real ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you&#39;re trying to get people to give advice to cover all<br/>
permutations of the situation. But it can&#39;t. All we can say indirectly by<br/>
discussing why we do things and why they work is &quot;Here&#39;s what works for us<br/>
and it&#39;s up to you to learn to listen to your children.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope, I&#39;m just pondering things based on my previous experience.  <br/>
We&#39;ve talked about the fact that I had one of those kids before.  The <br/>
situation is handled now and she is quite capable of saying nah, I <br/>
don&#39;t wanna . . . but there was a time when she went along with <br/>
whatever just to be agreeable.  It had nothing to do with family life <br/>
being disrupted, or emotional trauma, it was a just a quirk of her <br/>
personality.  It took her longer to get that she didn&#39;t have to be <br/>
interested in everything placed in front of her.<br/>
<br/>
And what I have said is exactly this &quot;Here&#39;s what works for us and <br/>
it&#39;s up to you to learn to listen to your children.&quot;  I said too much <br/>
strewing was not a good thing for US.  I did not say others should <br/>
avoid strewing altogether, although there are some who seem to be <br/>
trying to put those words in my mouth.<br/>

If the mom is clear that the child can pass or play, this isn&#39;t a problem.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds to me like a kid who especially needed strewing, of the kind that <br/>
just appears in her life without being handed to her by a parent.  If it&#39;s <br/>
just there, among many other things, she&#39;s not likely to pick it up and <br/>
think it&#39;s something you want her to do.  Other kids might not pick up <br/>
interesting things in their path and might need to have it handed to them <br/>
and be told it&#39;s something they *might* want to try.<br/>
