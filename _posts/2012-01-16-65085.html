So while I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ll be in Europe this summer and people can sign up for news and announcements of that here (or just to look at the blog to see the photos as they come up in those days).<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandraeurope2012.blogspot.com/">http://sandraeurope2012.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
And in December there will be another Always Learning Live gathering in Albuquerque, so if you&#39;re interested, please subscribe!<br/>

There are a couple of other U.S. things<br/>

<br/>
AND a conference in Florida has just been announced, and I might be a speaker, but it&#39;s still in the planning and pre-announcement stages.<br/>

<br/>
Apologies to those for whom these things are too far away to attend.<br/>
<br/>
And the first whiff of a yet-nebulous plan.  Joyce Fetteroll and I are talking about a possible/probable trip to Australia and India late in 2013.<br/>

Start saving money now so that in October 2013 or whenever it ends up being, you can afford to fly to Brisbane to hang out.  It&#39;s long enough to get some savings going. :-)<br/>
<br/>
And that goes for others here, too.  If you&#39;re interested in the Always Learning Live Symposium in Albuquerque in December, if you put $25 or so a month away, depending how far away you live, you might be able to do that (at least one adult, if not the whole family).  <br/>
<br/>
If your kids were in a private school, it would cost some money.<br/>
If you were required by law to study education in order to be homeschoolers, that would cost some money.<br/>
Although no one is *required* to go to a symposium to learn more, it can help hugely, and compared to &quot;professional training,&quot; they&#39;re very inexpensive.   <br/>

I am probably travelling to Boston mid-2013 (June/July) and have been trying to get a sense of whether any unschooling conferences will be on around that time that I could get to. The thought of being able to go to one in the U.S. and hear you and Joyce speak here in Australia is very exciting. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564476532">I heard Sandra (and Holly) speak at the Good Vibrations conference in San Diego last September, which was incredibly inspiring after reading her words here for so long. In fact the whole conference was extremely worthwhile, both for myself, and my partner Mike, who got to share experiences with other dads. We both came away with our commitment to unschooling enriched and strengthened.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, if you and Joyce are considering coming to Australia, I&#39;m already excited! I second Natarsha&#39;s offer of help - please feel free to contact me anytime.<br/>

sandra, is there any way to get you to come over the alps into italy? I<br/>
live in piedmont, which is not so far from the genevra area you willl be<br/>
at...if you are too many, I can host you in my home, or in a bed and<br/>
breakfast nearby.  If you could do a talk here, that would be even more<br/>
wonderful!  If I can help in anyway to make it happen...oooh!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757186786">I&#39;m writing to people on the side who ask for information on these &quot;outings&quot; and Always-Learning-based gatherings, because I don&#39;t want to fill the list up with what are still and all regional events.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something new on June 30 in Leiden, though, since I&#39;m in there anyway.  <br/>
