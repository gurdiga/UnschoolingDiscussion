<div id="ygrps-yiv-317955293">first, a bit of a brag on Katie.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re driving home from a day in town. I&#39;m hot and tired, and kicked <br/>
back in the passenger seat. Hubby driving; Katie looking at firework <br/>
ads in the paper. She shows me an ad for a family pack, 20% off, and <br/>
wants to know what the 20% means. I explain it thusly: There are 100 <br/>
pennies in one dollar. Each penny is one percent. If something is 20% <br/>
off, then every dollar you spend, you get 20c. off the price. (this <br/>
is almost verbatim only I was half asleep)<br/>
<br/>
Then I did drift off, while katie was talking to herself. I drifted <br/>
back awake to hear her saying &quot;it would be $16.00&quot; I looked at hubby <br/>
and said &quot;has she been figuring out the price on that family pack?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He nods.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Was she right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He nods again. And says &quot;I&#39;ve worked with her a bit on percentages&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, that answers my question: No, I don&#39;t need to teach math to my <br/>
kid, because she is getting it as she goes through life, as promised <br/>
by Holt, and others, and alla youse!<br/>
<br/>
And a question. I didn&#39;t do this, but wondered afterwards if I missed <br/>
a bit of an opportunity. Would it have been appropriate at the time <br/>
to get out pennies and paper and pencil and do some percentage math? <br/>
Like, sit down with her and do some, striking while the iron was hot?<br/>
<br/>
I know, &quot;not if she didn&#39;t want to&quot; but maybe I could have <br/>
said &quot;Let&#39;s sit with this and you can learn more about it&quot; and if she <br/>
was not into it, then dropping it, but taking it to her to choose.<br/>
<br/>
My kids amaze me every day.<br/>

Like, sit down with her and do some, striking while the iron was hot?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great story!!!<br/>
<br/>
What I do is when something like that comes up, I will ask if they would<br/>
like me to show them another way or a different way or how to on paper,<br/>
something like that. Sometimes the answer is yes and sometimes no. Both<br/>
Joseph and Sierra are very good at letting me know when I&#39;ve gone on too<br/>
long. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Well no, because she had just proven she was past that point!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keith was at a company/boss-invites-team backyard barbecue Saturday.  They <br/>
said &quot;no kids&quot; so I stayed with Holly and Keith went.<br/>
<br/>
First, they had advertised volleyball and swimming.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody played volleyball (though the net was up).<br/>
Nobody swam except Keith.<br/>
Keith said they had a great diving board, and Keith is a diver, but as he <br/>
weighs 300 pounds, he didn&#39;t figure they&#39;d be really nice to him even if he <br/>
showed them his many dives.  (He&#39;s a really good swimmer, while I don&#39;t swim <br/>
whatsoever.)<br/>
<br/>
Later everyone got to badmouthing teenagers, their own children and <br/>
themselves as teenagers.  Keith said a couple of times he tried to get into the <br/>
conversation, but he wasn&#39;t a good match for it and his comments fell flat.   <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s why:  Our teens aren&#39;t sneaky.  They&#39;ve never gotten into trouble.  <br/>
They&#39;ve never been suspended, or grounded.  We have no report card issues, no <br/>
homework issues.  <br/>
<br/>
And they got on kids about making change.  They said teenagers don&#39;t have a <br/>
clue what to do if the total is $8.20 and you hand them a twenty dollar bill <br/>
and two dimes.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Keith if he told them about the morning Kirby worked a Magic <br/>
Tournament booth for the store without even a calculator, and was figuring tax in his <br/>
head.  He said no, but he DID tell them Kirby had worked in a store for nearly <br/>
three years, and the comment he got back was &quot;yeah, we all had summer jobs <br/>
too, but...&quot;   So he didn&#39;t explain that this is no summer job, and that Kirby <br/>
has been great with percentages ever since the store gave him a five percent <br/>
discount when he was 13 (and 30 percent when he became an employee).<br/>
<br/>
He just withdrew from the conversation and let their teen storm pass by.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if that has anything to do with why their kids don&#39;t know real-world <br/>
math?<br/>
<br/>
Clues abound. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

What if the exchange had been about some other subject, like grammar or<br/>
history? Would you have felt the need to reinforce it, to make sure she gets<br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
Or might you expand on it? Or talk about something related?<br/>
<br/>
What direction might the conversation have gone in if you&#39;d been talking<br/>
with a friend?<br/>

These are the kinds of questions that pop into my head when dealing with<br/>
something my kids are trying to get or seem interested in. If it were frogs<br/>
and not numbers, would I show the same interest in them wanting to learn<br/>
more???  Yes I would. Many times we&#39;ve gone farther with things like worms<br/>
or even dirt just as much as we would history or numbers. And if it was a<br/>
friend of mine, and they showed interest, would I also offer to look into it<br/>
more for them or ask what they wanted? Again yes. If it was numbers or frogs<br/>
could they say they&#39;ve had enough. Most definitely. And if it was my friend<br/>
or my kid and the said no thank you, would I say okay? Yes again. Good<br/>
questions that really do help sort out what&#39;s enough and what&#39;s too much.<br/>
Then again I have kids and friends who let me know those exact things<br/>
too!!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. If you lie there half asleep while the talk is of fireworks, sales, <br/>
prices, whatever, then *spring* to action when it looks like something <br/>
academic, that wouldn&#39;t work so well if the goal is to value all of life.<br/>
<br/>
Some other time when you really have some interest would be a great time <br/>
to show some interest, though.<br/>

<br/>
Good answer! but I was thinking maybe I should have gotten out the <br/>
pennies and pencils and papers after we got home. When I explained <br/>
what percentage was, I said &quot;I&#39;ll explain it to you better when we <br/>
get home&quot; and when we got home, she didn&#39;t come to me with a request <br/>
for that, so going nuts on it prolly wasn&#39;t the thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
But this incident SO reinforces the fact that life teaches what <br/>
people need to know. In retrospect, Katie looks at sale flyers a lot. <br/>
She&#39;s going to be a savvy consumer, because she already knows that <br/>
7.99 is &quot;really $8.00&quot; :)<br/>
