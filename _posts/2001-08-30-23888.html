<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144859364">do you mean the mother drank two regular size bottles and one smaller<br/>
bottle of wine by herself?  That is a lot of wine for an adult!  I would<br/>
be falling over drunk and then hung over for probably two days<br/>
afterwards!<br/>
<br/>
According to the Am. Acad. of Pediatrics (in case anyone has any faith in<br/>
their opinions) alcohol consumption is compatible with breastfeeding in<br/>
amounts of one or fewer drinks per day.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Alcohol passes freely into mother&#39;s milk and has been found to peak<br/>
about 30 to 60 minutes after consumption, 60 to 90 minutes with food<br/>
(lawton 1985)  Alcohol also passes freely out of a mother&#39;s milk and her<br/>
system.  It takes a 120 pound woman about two to three hours to eliminate<br/>
from her body the alcohol is one serving of beer or wine (Schulte 1995). <br/>
However, the more alcohol is consumed, the longer it takes for it to be<br/>
eliminated.  It takes up to 13 hours for a 120 pound woman to eliminate<br/>
the alcohol from one high-alcohol drink [high alcohol was not defined]. <br/>
The effects of alcohol on the breastfeeding baby are directly related to<br/>
the amount the mother consumes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As someone else said, this can all vary depending on an individual&#39;s<br/>
constitution.  IMO, the bottom line is that it is better to breastfeed<br/>
even if mom enjoys a drink now and then, but heavy drinkers probably need<br/>
to think about their parenting.  How can you take care of your child if<br/>
you are drunk or hung over?<br/>
