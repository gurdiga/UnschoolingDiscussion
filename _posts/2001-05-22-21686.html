                SAVING OUR CHILDREN: A JAPANESE APPROACH<br/>

<br/>
Learning Through Living<br/>
<br/>
The Earth, for Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, was a miracle. Life was a miracle, <br/>
and he saw life vibrating and pulsating through all phenomena. A major <br/>
goal which began to motivate him early in his professional career was to <br/>
call his peers, particularly young people, to an awareness of and <br/>
appreciation for the Earth and for the life pulsating through it. In his <br/>
first major writing, &quot;A Geography of Human Life&quot; (first published as <br/>
*Jinsei Chirigaku* in 1903), Makiguchi describes what for him was the <br/>
ultimate question:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How, then, can we observe our surroundings? How can we make contact with <br/>
the earth? We are born of the earth; we are inspired by the earth; we die <br/>
on the earth; the earth is our home.&quot;  (p. 45)  <br/>
                 <br/>
In our interaction with our environment, Makiguchi believed we should <br/>
&quot;regard people, animals, trees, rivers, rocks, or stones in the same <br/>
light as ourselves and realize that we have much in common with them all. <br/>
Such interaction causes us to feel, if not consciously think, &#39;if I were <br/>
in their (or its) place, what would I feel...or do?&#39; Sympathetic <br/>
interactions occur, therefore, when you regard or feel another person or <br/>
object that you are in contact with as a part of yourself or as one of <br/>
your kind. You share experience with that person or object and are able <br/>
to place yourself in the position of that person or object.&quot;  (pp. 55-56)<br/>
<br/>
He also believed that &quot;it is our nature as human beings to form <br/>
societies. No one can live totally alone. It is through association in <br/>
society that we can provide not only for our basic needs and security, <br/>
but for everything that makes our lives fulfilling and rewarding. This <br/>
realization leads to the universalization of sympathetic feelings which <br/>
were initially toward a specific individual or object. Growing awareness <br/>
of our indebtedness to our society gives rise to feelings of appreciation <br/>
and a sense of social responsibility within us. Beginning in our very <br/>
personal relationships...our sympathetic concern and appreciation expands <br/>
to include the larger society and, ultimately, the whole world.&quot;  (pp. <br/>
60-61)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps more than any thing else, it was this reverence for nature, this <br/>
sense of wonder and appreciation for life, this sense of being intimately <br/>
connected with both our natural and social environments, that Makiguchi <br/>
longed to communicate to his students and fellow beings. The development <br/>
of such awareness and appreciation upon the part of human beings was, he <br/>
believed, of crucial importance both for nature&#39;s sake and for the <br/>
development of persons of moral character. <br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi was convinced that the development of a sense of <br/>
interdependence and interrelatedness with the natural world, of which he <br/>
perceived humans a part, is a central aspect of what it means to be a <br/>
human being. Not only is this holistic orientation the most pervasive <br/>
theme of &quot;A Geography of Human Life,&quot; it became the central theme of <br/>
Makiguchi&#39;s own life:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[B]eing aware of the rich variety of phenomena that influence my life, I <br/>
cannot help thinking of the way the whole earth operates. I look around <br/>
and, although my eyes can reach only a few kilometers in any direction, <br/>
my heart and mind is filled with excitement and wonder and curiosity <br/>
about the earth and about the relationship between the earth and our <br/>
lives on the earth. I begin to realize that if we would seek a deeper <br/>
understanding of this relationship, we must prepare ourselves to make <br/>
observations and inquiries into several different aspects of the planet, <br/>
such as its topography, dimensions, movements, and structure.&quot;  (p. 86)<br/>
<br/>
Such was Makiguchi&#39;s invitation to young people in particular, and to all <br/>
his contemporaries in general, to join him in a journey to explore the <br/>
wonders of the Earth and life born of the Earth. &quot;A Geography of Human <br/>
Life&quot; is something like a &quot;ship&#39;s log&quot; or diary of that journey. But it <br/>
was also intended as a handbook or travel guide for others who are <br/>
motivated to take the journey themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Before embarking on this journey of discovery, Makiguchi explained that <br/>
the method of inquiry to be used was that of participant observation. But <br/>
what was to be the scope of that observation?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I arrived at a conviction that the natural beginning point of <br/>
understanding the world we live in and our relationship to it is that <br/>
community of persons, land, and culture which gave us birth; that <br/>
community, in fact, which gave us our very lives and started us on the <br/>
path toward becoming the persons we are. In other words, that community <br/>
which has given us our rootedness as human beings. The importance of this <br/>
rootedness and personal identity given us by our native cultural <br/>
community, our homeland, can scarcely be overemphasized.&quot;  (pp. 29-30)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If we think seriously about it,&quot; he went on to say, &quot;we can see that <br/>
every aspect of this universe can be observed in this small area of our <br/>
homeland. And because our homeland is the place where we live, where we <br/>
walk, where we see and hear and gain impressions, it is possible for us <br/>
to observe all these things directly. Thus, it is possible for us to <br/>
explain the general nature of complex phenomena anywhere in the world <br/>
through use of examples which we can find in abundance even in the most <br/>
remote village or hamlet.&quot;  (p. 38)<br/>
<br/>
Philosophy of Learning<br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi often observed and spoke out strongly on what he saw as the <br/>
life-threatening damage being done to children&#39;s lives and personalities <br/>
in the Japanese schools of his day:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The detrimental effects of force-feeding a small child can be easily <br/>
seen because of the small body&#39;s inability to metabolize more than it can <br/>
digest. The excessive bulk passes through the child&#39;s system, an <br/>
undigested waste. Or worse, it may lodge in the digestive tract, slowly <br/>
putrefying and poisoning the whole system. Unfortunately, the effects of <br/>
psychological toxification in children caused by the forced learning of <br/>
masses of unintelligible information are not immediately visible. <br/>
Consequently, the detrimental effect of this poisoning process in <br/>
children&#39;s lives is not recognized. The situation is serious, but when we <br/>
search for the causes of the problem, we are faced with the paradox that <br/>
teachers and parents alike see themselves as providing for the future <br/>
well-being of the children even though they make them miserable in the <br/>
process.&quot;  (Dayle Bethel, ed., &quot;Education for Creative Living,&quot; Iowa <br/>
State University Press,  p. 21)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The aim of education,&quot; Makiguchi stressed, &quot;is not to transfer <br/>
knowledge; it is to guide the learning process, to put responsibility for <br/>
study into the students&#39; own hands. It is not the piecemeal merchandising <br/>
of information; it is the provision of keys that will allow people to <br/>
unlock the vault of knowledge on their own. It does not consist in <br/>
pilfering the intellectual property amassed by others through no <br/>
additional effort of one&#39;s own; it would rather place people on their own <br/>
path of discovery and invention. The words have been resounding in the <br/>
ears of educators like ourselves since the days of [Czech <br/>
theologian/educator J.A.] Comenius and [Swiss educational reformer <br/>
Johann] Pestalozzi, but they have yet to be put into real practice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thus, if one possesses the keys to unlock the vault of knowledge, it <br/>
becomes possible to obtain for oneself all the learning one will ever <br/>
need in life without having to memorize endless volumes of <br/>
scholarship....There is no reason to overload our lives with mountains of <br/>
useless and trivial information that we may never need.&quot;  (&quot;Education for <br/>
Creative Living,&quot; p. 168)<br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi believed that the indirect, secondhand educational system that <br/>
had developed in Japan was the height of folly. Primarily a product of <br/>
implantation from Western cultures, that system of education, he charged, <br/>
confined learners to classrooms and forced them to go through a <br/>
meaningless routine of memorizing and forgetting, memorizing, forgetting, <br/>
and on and on. Furthermore, it severed the learners&#39; ties with the <br/>
natural systems making up their environment. Makiguchi, writing in the <br/>
early decades of the 20th century, described the effects of the <br/>
development of modern schools in Japan as follows:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the days before there were schools, the prevailing method of guiding <br/>
young people to the proper roles in the general scheme of life was an <br/>
extended home life, whereby one apprenticed at the family trade <br/>
throughout one&#39;s formative years, with this training supplemented by <br/>
things learned from the local community. Then came the Meiji period <br/>
(1868-1912) with its modern education and the spread of <br/>
schools....Everyone was taken by the hand and dragged off to schools, and <br/>
soon the other two schemes of learning fell into disuse. This was the age <br/>
of the school reigning unchallenged and omnipotent.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Only in recent years have we seen the grave error of our ways and tried <br/>
to fill in the gap with various kinds of adjunct education and youth <br/>
groups for extracurricular activity....From this point on, school <br/>
education must be aware of its own share of the educational role....It <br/>
must cooperate with the other two areas of education, the home and the <br/>
community, each with its own expertise....These three areas of education <br/>
must link together in an orderly system of mutual complementarity.&quot;  <br/>
(&quot;Education for Creative Living,&quot; p. 181)<br/>
<br/>
To accomplish this kind of community-based system of education, Makiguchi <br/>
proposed what he called a &quot;half-day school&quot; system, from elementary <br/>
schooling to the university, which would cut back on ill-managed <br/>
education that was wasting valuable work-learning time. If we were to <br/>
return to the other two areas of education much of their pre-modern <br/>
territory in overall life guidance, he claimed, only the remainder would <br/>
need to be taught in schools -- and in a half day at that. This, he <br/>
believed, would at once prove more efficient, and would create an organic <br/>
bond with the other two areas.<br/>
<br/>
In a marvelous statement summing up the fundamental purpose of half-day <br/>
schooling, Makiguchi wrote that &quot;study is not seen as a preparation for <br/>
living, but rather study takes place while living, and living takes place <br/>
in the midst of study. Study and actual living are seen as more than <br/>
parallels; they inform one another intercontextually, study-in-living and <br/>
living-in-study, throughout one&#39;s whole life. In this sense, it is not <br/>
the better economic budgeting of school programs but the instilling of <br/>
joy and appreciation for work that becomes the main focus of the proposed <br/>
changes.&quot;  (&quot;Education for Creative Living,&quot; p. 156)<br/>
	<br/>
Makiguchi&#39;s &quot;A Geography of Human Life&quot; highlights a clash between two <br/>
different kinds of society based on radically different world views and <br/>
sets of values. Makiguchi offered his vision of a good society, which <br/>
could nurture good, happy persons, as a model for the development of an <br/>
industrial system in Japan. At the time he was writing &quot;A Geography of <br/>
Human Life,&quot; the American version of the Western model of industrialism <br/>
was sweeping the Earth. The contrast between that type of industrialism <br/>
and the type that Makiguchi proposed is sharp and clear. It is especially <br/>
clear in the respective views of the two models toward nature. A basic <br/>
tenet of the American model, what Alvin Toffler labels &quot;indust reality,&quot; <br/>
is that &quot;nature is an object waiting to be exploited.&quot;  (Toffler, 1981, <br/>
p. 99)<br/>
<br/>
For Makiguchi, on the other hand, to be human meant to live in harmony <br/>
with the Earth. To live as a human being meant to love and understand and <br/>
appreciate the Earth: &quot;[I]t is through our spiritual interaction with the <br/>
earth that the characteristics which we think of as truly human are <br/>
ignited and nurtured within us.&quot;  (pp. 47-48, 62)<br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi envisioned an industrial society developing in Japan upon a <br/>
basis of interdependence and interconnectedness between human beings and <br/>
the Earth. It was to the realization of such a society that he directed <br/>
his life and his teaching. <br/>
<br/>
Efforts at Implementation<br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi&#39;s professional life spanned four decades, from 1900 to 1930. <br/>
During most of that time, he served as a teacher and principal of <br/>
elementary schools in various parts of Japan, seeking, to the extent <br/>
possible given the rigidity of the educational system, to experiment in <br/>
implementing his educational ideas. The results of these experiments were <br/>
impressive and Makiguchi received strong support and encouragement from <br/>
some of his former students and teachers who taught under him.<br/>
<br/>
He was supported also -- and his educational ideas endorsed -- by many <br/>
prominent persons in Japanese society, including Tsuyoshi Inukai, prime <br/>
minister of Japan during the early 1930s. However, with but a few notable <br/>
exceptions, Japanese academics and educational administrators bitterly <br/>
denounced Makiguchi as a rabble-rouser and troublemaker, and labeled his <br/>
ideas and proposed educational reforms as unworkable nonsense. These <br/>
sentiments within the educational establishment, together with the <br/>
increasing influence of the military in Japanese society, led to <br/>
Makiguchi&#39;s forced retirement from his post as a primary school <br/>
principal, and thus to the &quot;official&quot; end of his long career as an <br/>
educator.<br/>
<br/>
The final blow came with the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai in <br/>
1932 by military elements. After that, Makiguchi gave up trying to <br/>
improve Japanese education and society through educational channels, and <br/>
turned his energy and convictions in other directions. <br/>
<br/>
But while Tsunesaburo Makiguchi&#39;s ideas and his vision of an industrial <br/>
society based on love and respect for the environment, and of holistic <br/>
learning occurring within nature and community, were rejected by Japanese <br/>
society in his lifetime, his ideas and proposals have played -- and are <br/>
continuing to play -- a significant role in creating the worldwide <br/>
revolution in education and society we are now witnessing.<br/>

                  WISH I&#39;D SAID THAT  (Quote of the Day):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If we chose a theme like ocean, river, or forest, the students came up <br/>
with ideas. They imagined they were plankton, the fish, the trees. They <br/>
had to study what was in it. They learned how everything is <br/>
interconnected. They looked at the life of coral, dinosaurs, the birth of <br/>
the Earth. Children get very interested in nature. Their bodies come into <br/>
resonance with the Earth....&quot;<br/>
