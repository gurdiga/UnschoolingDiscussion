&lt;&lt; Technically, according to Steiner, a child is not<br/>
ready to learn something until a particular age. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AND Steiner was neither an educator or a child development specialist.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He was a philosopher, and studied science and medicine (or made some medicine <br/>
up, as he made some education up).  There&#39;s a ton of stuff written about and <br/>
by him, but here&#39;s something easy with a timeline:<br/>

A quote:<br/>
<br/>
-=- In Rudolf Steiner spiritual wisdom assumed a new shape. He began to <br/>
operate from pure thought, and detected living thoughts filling the Universe. As a <br/>
result of his discoveries, Steiner was bent on putting force and life into <br/>
thinking, through thinking, within thinking. His basic philosophic works, <br/>
especially the Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, and many exercises he devised, are <br/>
directed to this end, to strengthen the thinking faculties in man till thinking <br/>
works itself on and up and gets free from the brain system.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some more, and at the risk of irritating his fans, I think it can be <br/>
summarized as &quot;he pulled this stuff out of his ass,&quot; or &quot;out of the air.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=- After reaching this stage of &quot;independent thinking&quot;, Steiner discovered <br/>
that this &quot;living thinking&quot; could awaken parts of him from &quot;above&quot;. Thought <br/>
that had risen into subtility, could even impart life to a dormant spiritual <br/>
perception in Steiner. From about 1900 Steiner began to pursue this path with <br/>
determination, and gradually came to discern three forms of higher knowledge:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Imagination: a higher seeing of the spiritual world in revealing images; <br/>
2.  Inspiration: a higher hearing of the spiritual world, through which it <br/>
reveals its creative forces and its creative order; <br/>
3.  Intuition: the stage at which an intuitive penetration into the sphere of <br/>
Spiritual Beings becomes possible.<br/>
Equipped with his few-found imagination, inspiration, and intuition, Steiner <br/>
developed a substantial body of spiritual and practical knowledge up to his <br/>
death in 1925. He gave it the name &quot;Anthroposophy&quot;-=-<br/>
