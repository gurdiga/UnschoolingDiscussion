 </span></blockquote>I have all of them. They&#39;re all good, but Wishcraft is still my favorite. As <br/>
I mentioned before, I also think it fits in perfectly with Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
The idea of the book is to figure out what you want and get it, even if, as <br/>
she says, you have no money, no character, and are often grouchy.  She talks <br/>
about what your life would have been like if your parents had joyfully <br/>
supported your dreams, emotionally and with real help and resources. I <br/>
realized early on that that was the kind of parent I wanted to be.<br/>
<br/>
She also has a great website, and she actually took my idea, about the &quot;home <br/>
team&quot; for some of the new book she&#39;s writing. (We&#39;ve e-mailed.)<br/>
