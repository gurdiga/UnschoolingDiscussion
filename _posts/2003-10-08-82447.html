Pam, what you said was my point.  I think moms who worry about teens <br/>
talking about sex don&#39;t get that teens will talk about sex regardless.  <br/>
In my experience the parents that try to control their children end up <br/>
having the most out of control kids.  When I was a teen, it was the <br/>
ultra controled kids that were having the most sex, drinking the most, <br/>
etc. The kids like me, who could have a glass of wine with my parents <br/>
and whose parents spoke openly with me about sex, those things were not <br/>
forbidden and therefore not so desirable.<br/>
When I was about 12, my mom and dad gave me and my sister permission to <br/>
smoke, figuring that if we wanted to, we would, and they&#39;d rather have us do it at <br/>
home where we could talk about it than sneaking around.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of has ever smoked.<br/>
