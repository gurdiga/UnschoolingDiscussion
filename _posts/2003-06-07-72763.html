&gt;Umm...isn&#39;t that where all the VAMPIRES are?<br/>
&gt;Although it could be very educational living near the Hellmouth, and if<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re unschooling, the school system doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>

need to go to Cleveland for a Hellmouth now.  -snicker-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041864396">Okay, all you Vampire-heads...<br/>
Sunnyvale is a lovely town (if getting a trifle over-built) on the <br/>
Peninsula (Bay Area) in California.<br/>
<br/>
I used to live there (and actually belonged to a Woman&#39;s Sewing Circle... <br/>
how scary is that... the Sunnyvale Women&#39;s Sewing Circle...  Aiee.)  Now I <br/>
live about 20 minutes north.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Sunnyvale is a very nice town for raising kids.  They have a great <br/>
parks and rec department, youth theatre, etc, etc.  It&#39;s a very kid and <br/>
family-focused town.<br/>
<br/>
In the last few years, a large influx of Asian families (lots of High Tech <br/>
in the area) have moved in, so it&#39;s easy to find really authentic asian <br/>
food and grocery items.  Delicious eating!<br/>
<br/>
The library&#39;s pretty good and the kids section is larger than most in the <br/>
area.  Their mall is awful.  They have a great cheap-grocery place near the <br/>
middle of town, which I kind of miss.  I also miss the slightly loopy woman <br/>
who runs a plant nursery out of her home on Mathilda Rd.  You can&#39;t even <br/>
see the terrific old (falling apart) house because of all the plants in <br/>
front of it.  She&#39;s open when she feels like it, and closed the rest of the <br/>
time.  Her prices are pretty low but I shop there because it makes me <br/>
chuckle.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s a Teacher Resource place in the area where you (as a private <br/>
school proprietor) can go to get odds and ends of this and that for <br/>
free/low cost/etc.  They even have a laminator (for making those School <br/>
ID&#39;s.)  It&#39;s called RAFT... resource &#39;something&#39; for teachers, I <br/>
think.  They&#39;re pretty nice and will let you tour the place before you <br/>
decide to join.  One of my kids was always gluing something to something <br/>
else, so I&#39;d go there to get bits and pieces of this and that for them to <br/>
glue up.<br/>
<br/>
Sunnyvale&#39;s pretty nice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, okay, maybe I should have said it&#39;s kind of eerie.  More than 4/5ths <br/>
of the mall is empty storefronts with open stores scattered here and there <br/>
higgledy-piggledy and hardly anyone in the mall which means your footsteps <br/>
echo.  If you don&#39;t like malls, you might really enjoy this one!  (grin)<br/>
