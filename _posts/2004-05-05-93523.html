<div id="ygrps-yiv-164025468">So - I have something interesting to report. We NEVER did a math <br/>
curriculum of any kind at all. Have had years and years of not opening <br/>
any &quot;official&quot; math texts. I can&#39;t say we didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; math, because the <br/>
truth is that it comes up in life all the time and there have been a <br/>
number of opportunities throughout the years to show one kid or another <br/>
how to do things like add fractions with unlike denominators, etc., but <br/>
no math program and the amount of time spent on explaining how to &quot;do&quot; <br/>
math computations was very minimal. My oldest daughter started taking <br/>
the lowest possible level of math in college, because she hadn&#39;t had <br/>
any instruction and figured she probably had big gaps - so she didn&#39;t <br/>
even bother with the placement test and just started right out with the <br/>
most remedial level. She whizzed through the remedial levels and got up <br/>
into more advanced algebra courses and, lo and behold, she LOVES it. <br/>
She is ready to transfer to a 4-year university in the next year or so <br/>
(she&#39;s been at a community college) and I got out of the bed this <br/>
morning to discover her on the computer DROOLING over all the math <br/>
courses offered at UC Santa Cruz, where she&#39;s planning to go. She may <br/>
change her mind, still, and that&#39;s okay, but she and I are both kind of <br/>
in shock that she&#39;d even consider being a math major - this is my <br/>
poetry writing, pottery throwing, seriously artsy-fartsy kid.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s very cool Pam! Seems like math that&#39;s learned as part of real <br/>
life has much more sticking power. <br/>
I ended up making much the same discovery in college, which is how I <br/>
ended up with Art and Computer Science as my degree. Math and <br/>
Computer Programming are art forms in their own way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737381495">It makes me think the genetic component is strong in her. <br/>
<br/>
Both parents mathish and a kid takes to math easily?  <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm....<br/>
<br/>
It IS wonderful evidence that the training and early scheduled math-insertion <br/>
isn&#39;t necessary, though!   A child of two theatrical parents who pay a lot in <br/>
overdraft charges might not get as excited about math no matter how much he&#39;s <br/>
been taught or not taught.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good that not everyone needs to know or do everything.  It&#39;s a great <br/>
advantage of advanced civilization that people can specialize!  (there are <br/>
disadvantages too, of advanced civilization, but it&#39;s fun sometimes to see a clear <br/>
bright spot)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right. And that was my point, really!!<br/>
<br/>
But, I could also make the point that many many MANY more parents would <br/>
probably be naturally &quot;mathish,&quot; but their true nature was undoubtedly <br/>
thwarted by horrible (or just too-early) formal math instruction.<br/>
