 Hey! I am not real close, but kinda close, Florida here.  My dad has a place <br/>
 in Waynesville NC and I used to live in Knoxville Tenn.  So, we are kinda <br/>
 close!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hey, is it just me or are all the Floridians coming out of the woodwork??!!  <br/>
<br/>
Where are you in FLA, Teresa?  We are in Martin County.<br/>

Hi, We are in Miami, rather, a little north of Miami.  I don&#39;t know exactly <br/>
where Martin County is, how close are we?<br/>

We are about 1 1/2 hours north of you --just north of Palm Beach county.<br/>
<br/>
But I grew up in Miami and most of my family still lives there.  You see, I <br/>
married this Jersey boy and 20 years later this is where we ended up.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now I am looking to get in touch with local support groups that might <br/>
have fun field trips, etc., for the upcoming summer/year.  Do you have a good <br/>
source of info?<br/>

I don&#39;t really go in for groups at this point, I like to find people that I <br/>
am compatible with and that has kids that my kids get along with to do <br/>
things.  We could set some things up down here that I know about, for when <br/>
you come down to visit, or plan something in your neck of the woods if the <br/>
directions are not hard!  Never did learn map reading skills!!  We went to <br/>
the renaissance festival at Viz Caya this year, that was awesome, be worth <br/>
you all making a visit for!!   <br/>
Oh, I do know about one unschooling group, but, they won&#39;t let you go on <br/>
their field trips if you don&#39;t join their group, so, I don&#39;t know if you <br/>
would want to do that or not.  Anyhow, let me know when you will be making a <br/>
visit or what you think.<br/>
