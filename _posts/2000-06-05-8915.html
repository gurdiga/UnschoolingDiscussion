<div id="ygrps-yiv-946369400">Okay, let me rephrase the question more intelligently: Tell me some of the<br/>
wonderful ways you are observing your children&#39;s natural love of learning<br/>
and self-directed activities and facilitating their learning by answering<br/>
questions, providing resources, etc. Your responses have been so<br/>
encouraging and reassuring to me as I only know public school moms and they<br/>
are interested in totally different aspects of their children&#39;s lives. <br/>
I have been home with my children and unschooling all their lives (almost 6<br/>
years). My oldest e-mails with her grandma (using &quot;kid spelling&quot;). I read<br/>
to them a ton of children&#39;s books and are halfway through the Little House<br/>
series. They play outside a lot and have taken to frog and worm hunting a<br/>
lot lately and observing frogs swim in our bathtub: ) My five-year-old has<br/>
her own little business selling eggs and my four-year-old sells fruit and<br/>
jam that she helps me make. My three-year-old son is a dinosaur fanatic and<br/>
asks a lot of questions about them. Yesterday, he announced &quot;Mama, when I<br/>
grow up, I&#39;m going to be a pro bull rider.&quot; Yikes! The girls and I are<br/>
experimenting with sewing, cross stitch, latch hook, and crochet. We live<br/>
on 11 acres in Arkansas with a catfish pond, a hay meadow, and lots of<br/>
fruit trees. My kids have learned things about animals, farming, and<br/>
gardening that I didn&#39;t know at age 20. <br/>
We have a setting hen and I could swear she&#39;s been setting for 3 weeks.<br/>
Isn&#39;t that the incubation period? Now I&#39;m off on a tangent : ) Sue, your<br/>
lives on your farm sounds awesome!  ---Becky</div>

Yes a chicken&#39;s incubation period is three weeks, but don&#39;t give up <br/>
on her yet, sometimes they can take a little longer.  We have one <br/>
hen that hatched 9 chicks in the new extension built onto the side <br/>
of the house, she found some insulation on a table in there <br/>
amongst other building materials and made her nest, one other hen <br/>
shared the nest for a few days so was able to get two of  her <br/>
babies hatched by another hen.   It&#39;s great watching a mother hen <br/>
with her little ones, they are so fierce, our&#39;s even chases off the <br/>
geese and turkeys.<br/>
