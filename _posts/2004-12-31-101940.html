<div id="ygrps-yiv-73078915"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Seamus just recently got his beautiful long red hair cut (the hair <br/>
&gt;stylist almost gave him a girly bob style, thinking he was a girl!! <br/>
&gt;eek), and the first couple of days i thought it looked really cool. <br/>
&gt;I gelled it into a kind of quasi mohawk thing and he looked rather <br/>
&gt;like a little rock star, even got comments from strangers &quot;cool hair <br/>
&gt;man!&quot; He was happy people finally knew he is a boy when we&#39;re out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sebastian took scissors to his gorgeous white blond locks the other day. <br/>
i asked him if he was wanting a trim, he said yes.  so we got some better<br/>
scissors out and i started to brush out his little snarly dreadies<br/>
staring on the back of his head (his hair is so fine, but it mats a day<br/>
after being brushed and he can&#39;t stand having it brushed!)  he said, *ow!<br/>
 that hurts too much!  just cut it all off!*  i was shocked hearing this<br/>
from his sweet little face.  it wasn&#39;t that long ago that he cried,<br/>
begged and pleaded with me to let him grow it out like his aunt who has<br/>
hair down to her arse.  *sigh*  i asked him if he was sure, he said *yes,<br/>
shave it off like yours mama, i don&#39;t want you to brush it anymore...it&#39;s<br/>
too hard.*  well, you can&#39;t get anymore straightforward or clear than<br/>
that!  so, i stood there with my clippers, taking off chunks of his<br/>
beautiful hair...hair that i wish would grow out of my own head and i<br/>
bawled!  i could barely see through my tears!  he looked up at me and<br/>
said, *oh mama...why are you crying?*  i said i was just sad to see his<br/>
beautiful hair come off.  he replied, *mama...it&#39;s just *hair*.  don&#39;t<br/>
worry, it will grow back!*  i laughed, then cried some more.  transition<br/>
is hard for me. ;)  well, we saved his hair, just like i saved mine when<br/>
i shaved it off recently, he&#39;s beautiful and all is well. :)  he seems to<br/>
get this elated *high* cutting off his hair just like i do...for me it&#39;s<br/>
so freeing, seems like it is for him too!  he&#39;s been a glowing ball of<br/>
happiness ever since!  i miss the hair still, but he&#39;s right...it will<br/>
grow back (well, if he wants it to!)  my dad practically disowned me when<br/>
i snuck to a hair salon with my mom and cut my hair to shoulder length<br/>
when i was 8 (imagine his shock when i shaved it!!)  it really hurt me to<br/>
have him react so harshly to something that was my choice and on my own<br/>
body...and i was twice sebby&#39;s age then!  <br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s to all of our shining self-assured beauties of children, free to<br/>
make choices that truly make them happy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774589619">Lisa, I just wanted to tell you...My 6 yo was reading<br/>
your post over my sholder, and as I went to delete it<br/>
she said &quot;Wait, I&#39;m not done....&quot;  So I sat there<br/>
until she was done, and she said &quot;Flag that one--it&#39;s<br/>
such a nice story&quot; :)<br/>
