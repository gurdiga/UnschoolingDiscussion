<div id="ygrps-yiv-983444759">&lt;&lt;We have just set up a channel for the children to chat in, on irc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do children of all ages talk at the same time? Are there &quot;rooms&quot; where older children (older teenagers in particular) can talk? I&#39;ve heard of irc but know nothing about it!<br/>
