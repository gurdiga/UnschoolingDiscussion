<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992656407">I really hope I&#39;m doing this message stuff right....I&#39;ve never been on an <br/>
e-mail list like this so I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
Tia, I thought Mimi&#39;s were a Southern thing!! Never heard it before moving <br/>
down here. <br/>
And we have a holiday baby too (another New Year&#39;s baby) and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s <br/>
part of what prompted him to ask for the special day. We started out by <br/>
calling it a Trevor day...then moved into the half Birthday thing.<br/>
It&#39;s a great day because there is no pressure on me to do decorations or <br/>
anything. It&#39;s simple, but fun.<br/>

cultural tradition.  It was made up, just saying mommy backwards.  My kids <br/>
have an Oma, which is German.<br/>

one day apart.  We just got a small present on our half birthday to take <br/>
some of the sting away from watching the other one get lots of stuff.<br/>

Oh Kelly,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for your rift. Even though &quot;Life is sweeter&quot;<br/>
without her, it&#39;s sad that it has to be that way.<br/>
