<div id="ygrps-yiv-424587003">Spoiler Warning: in the unlikely event that you haven&#39;t yet read &quot;The Lion,<br/>
the Witch and the Wardrobe,&quot; you may not wish to read further here.<br/>
 <br/>
I was rereading The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe in anticipation of the<br/>
upcoming movie and I came upon this wonderful little quote.  It takes place<br/>
after the battle where Edmund had fought very bravely and had been wounded<br/>
and then healed  with Lucy&#39;s cordial.  Here&#39;s the quote:  &quot;...she found him<br/>
standing on his feet and not only healed of his wounds but looking better<br/>
than she had seen him look - oh, for ages; in fact ever since his first term<br/>
at that horrid school which was where he had begun to go wrong.  He had<br/>
become his real old self again and could look you in the face.&quot;<br/>

following someone&#39;s script.   Maybe instead of &quot;repeating his concerns and <br/>
letting him know that I am listening&quot; you could hold his hand while he cries or <br/>

listening without the supremely irritating repetition or rephrasing.    <br/>

Don&#39;t think about what you need to teach yourself or him.   Forget about <br/>
teaching.   Move toward just learning.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>

scary abusive quiet, and some exuberant peace.   And if you&#39;re not choosing <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712784726">&lt;&lt;this is over something I said we would do or get and then it didn&#39;t work out&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a 12yo that still has meltdowns in the above situation.  It is his nature.  He can see Plan A but switching to Plan B really messes with his mind.  He would even follow us around trying to make us commit to a plan.<br/>
<br/>
What has worked for us is to tell him what the general plan is (yes, we will plan to ask his friend over later in the day) but to say loudly and firmly (yes, that is the plan but things might change, we might have a flat coming home from the store, or somebody might get sick....we are hoping to ask his friend over but it might change).<br/>
<br/>
Then when it does hit the fan and we have to change a plan, Zach starts into the &quot;but you said&quot; and I remind him that it wasn&#39;t written in stone, that things change, that yes that was the plan and perhaps we can do it tomorrow, but it isn&#39;t happening today.<br/>
<br/>
After many years, it is improving.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634568357">Sandra,<br/>
 <br/>
Growing up until about the age of 12 years I always laughed and played all the time. I was always doing things my parents thought were wrong so I was spanked, grounded, or yelled at from the time I was very little. My father and mother fought and yelled all the time also. I swore that my life would be different at one point I believe I did not want to have any children. But I am very grateful I do I love them more than anything in the world.<br/>
 <br/>
I have now forgiven my parents and moved on I have been working on being a patient mother all my mothering life. I just never really knew what that meant. I have always slept with my kids because I do love being with them 99.9% of the time I really do love them, I love nursing them, having them and just being with them is such a joy. I am so good to them until I get angry and then I am not sure I have acquired the skills to calm myself and then I revert to what I was taught (usually yelling). <br/>
I feel helpless to help them and that frustrates me. I know I have the answers within me I guess need to be quiet and listen.<br/>
 <br/>
One last question, when he is that upset he keeps repeating himself and this can last for 30 min to an hour, how do I stay calm and still help him, I feel lost at that point?<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you so much Sandra,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067482605">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Thank you and I also would love it if anyone else has any great<br/>
mothering suggestions during a melt down. I so would appreciate any and all<br/>
responses. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some stuff I do and did with Jayn now 6. The foundation of it is not<br/>
to take her anger personally, while still acknowledging whatever my part<br/>
might have been in creating it.<br/>
<br/>
The first part is not to place Jayn into a position where she is likely to<br/>
meltdown if that is remotely possible - also not to continue to thwart her<br/>
to the point that she feels that frustrated, but to begin the process of<br/>
finding an alternative fulfillment at the beginning. For example if your<br/>
child always has a hard time in large, loud, echoey places - start shopping<br/>
at a small local grocery instead. (That is partly how of we solved her<br/>
&quot;store running&quot; problem btw)<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn is having any kind of meltdown, she responds best to physicality<br/>
with me, ahead of verbal reassurances or empathizing. The core of it is to<br/>
ask myself &quot;What loving action, as is showing my love to Jayn, can I take<br/>
right now?&quot; That is the magic question, regardless of how obnoxious she is<br/>
being. <br/>
<br/>
From a recent discussion on AU:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What I came to realize is that the priority, in all cases of negative<br/>
behavior, must be to *show* her my continued love and acceptance of her as a<br/>
person *first*, and then if necessary express my desires or give the helpful<br/>
information that she seems to be lacking. Often just the loving action<br/>
changes her emotional state and she stops the problem actions. This ties in<br/>
with assuming she is doing the best she can, and expressing empathy (see<br/>
Naomi Aldort&#39;s writing) which is best done with Jayn, by a loving physical<br/>
action. I know not all children want this physical response in times of<br/>
intensity.<br/>
<br/>
The additional bonus for me is that choosing these loving actions helps my<br/>
anger (at whatever level) to melt away also - the immediate result is a<br/>
mother who is thinking clearly and logically so able to make better<br/>
decisions.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that is holding out my arms to her, sometimes it is blowing a<br/>
raspberry on her belly, sometimes it is giving her my hands to push against,<br/>
sometimes it is restraining her for the purpose of letting her push against<br/>
my body. These are all strategies that help her become emotionally organized<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a situation of that idea working to avoid a meltdown in a public<br/>
place recently:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Or perhaps we are in a situation of immediate conflicting needs as we<br/>
were this &quot;morning&quot; while getting our breakfast (everyone else&#39;s dinner) at<br/>
Home Town Buffet. Jayn was finished and wanted to leave at once. Dh and I<br/>
said that we wanted to finish our desserts first. Jayn started to say &quot;no I<br/>
want to go NOW&quot; and getting louder and teary. Huge crowd in the place, btw.<br/>
<br/>
I made a conscious decision, despite a certain amount of internal rising<br/>
stress, to show her some love and acceptance *first*, despite what<br/>
conventional parenting might label &quot;whining&quot; or &quot;rewarding of negative<br/>
behavior&quot;. I drew her on to my lap, gave her a slow hug and a kiss, and then<br/>
told her that I knew she wanted to go and being patient is hard, but we<br/>
needed a few minutes to finish our desserts. I felt her physically relax.<br/>
Then she sniffled a bit, but sat quietly and gently on her chair and waited<br/>
for the few minutes, conversing about other things.<br/>
<br/>
In the past when something like this has occurred, we have tried just the<br/>
verbal empathy and reasoning, Jayn continued to loudly complain, and then<br/>
dh, with some grumpiness, has taken Jayn to the car to wait rather than<br/>
disturb other diners. This is usually somewhat OK because he generally has<br/>
already finished fast and also dislikes waiting, and I am the slow eater<br/>
(often because I have spent time assisting Jayn with the buffet instead of<br/>
eating). For some reason today we were both still munching.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that what I did today felt so much better, so right, *and*<br/>
worked - by which I mean Jayn willingly chose Patience.&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
It helps me to have a mental script. It helps me even more if the mental<br/>
script is something that I devised for myself, fully authentic to me and the<br/>
way I think and speak and with my priorities, as against just following the<br/>
scripts of other parenting writers. Having a deliberate script (it might be<br/>
something as simple as &quot;Breathe&quot;) for *myself* has been the best way to<br/>
avoid knee jerk reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote fairly recently that is kinda related. It has to do<br/>
with focusing on discovering the unexpressed need, rather than necessarily<br/>
wanting to stop the meltdown or negative behavior such as hitting me:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; I have found from my experience that the parent(me) thinking, &quot;I have to<br/>
*correct* this bad action with information&quot; (or even &quot;I need her to know how<br/>
I am feeling&quot;) is a distancing thought. It is not that I never enacted that<br/>
kind of reaction to Jayn. But I found that it was a path that led to<br/>
frustration for both of us - and tended to backfire with Jayn so that I<br/>
couldn&#39;t even get to the next step. In re-examining my past uses of the<br/>
&quot;that hurts me&quot; phrases, I believe I was speaking in a way I had been told I<br/>
&quot;should&quot; do, and that there was a didactic paradigm, or a controlling<br/>
paradigm behind it.<br/>
<br/>
However I found a better-for-us procedure. Instead of focusing first on the<br/>
negative, I try consciously choosing to think the phrase &quot;What does she<br/>
need?&quot;, or more recently what I have found far and away the most helpful<br/>
thought &quot;What loving action can I take towards Jayn *right now*?&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
This has produced the results that I would hope for - Jayn becoming calmer,<br/>
more able to verbalize, more empathetic to me and, incidentally, likely to<br/>
apologize for hurting me.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess that underlying these strategies is the concept that a young child<br/>
is probably not ready to verbalize coherently in the heat of a meltdown - so<br/>
the &quot;active&quot; portion of Active Listening, needs to come to the forefront.<br/>
(g).<br/>
<br/>
Finally here is Tree Goddess&#39;s fabulous list of helpful (active and<br/>
physical) strategies for restoring calm and serenity:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Calming Activities:  Experiences that may help to relax the nervous system<br/>
<br/>
* Stretches<br/>
* Deep pressure massage<br/>
* Slow rocking or swinging<br/>
* Fidget toys<br/>
* Progressive muscle relaxation<br/>
* Quite music with a steady beat<br/>
* Bear hugs<br/>
* Reduced noise and light levels<br/>
* Lavender, vanilla or other soothing smells<br/>
* Snuggling in a sleeping bag, large pillows or bean bag chair<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Organizing Activities: Experiences that can help an individual become<br/>
focused and attentive<br/>
<br/>
*Sucking or chewing on hard candy or gum<br/>
* Adding rhythm to the activity<br/>
* Vibration-toy massager, vibrating pillow, wiggle pen<br/>
* Heavy work tasks to include hanging, pushing, pulling or carrying heavy<br/>
objects<br/>
<br/>
Similarly: To organize<br/>
*Swinging on a swing or climbing<br/>
* Rhythmical sustained movement:  marching, washing a table, or bouncing<br/>
* Rocking in a rocking chair<br/>
* &quot;Squeezie&quot; toys (koosh balls, balloons or rubber gloves filled with flour<br/>
or cream, soft balls, gak, silly putty)<br/>
* Hanging by the arms on the monkey bars (20-30 seconds)<br/>
* Pushing/carrying heavy objects<br/>
* Carrying back packs weighted with books or bags of dried beans (this<br/>
should only be worn for 15-20 minutes with an hour or two between) *A<br/>
reading corner with a bean bag chair makes a wonderful place for escape when<br/>
there is too much stimulation.  Some children may like the bean bag on top<br/>
of them.<br/>
* Play dough<br/>
* Tactile Bins (cornmeal, oatmeal, water, sand, rice, beans)<br/>
* Kitchen time (mixing, tasting, smelling, washing up)<br/>
* Finger painting<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some children also need extra sensory input in their mouths and hands in<br/>
order to organize their behavior:<br/>
<br/>
* Drinking from a water bottle<br/>
* Chewing (you can use a straw, rubber tubing or coffee stir stick)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To calm:<br/>
<br/>
* Being brushed with a corn de-silking brush (in one direction approximately<br/>
10 times with pressure brush their arms, back (but not over the spine), legs<br/>
(on the top, outer parts and underneath, avoid the inner thigh area),  top<br/>
of the feet and the hands)<br/>
<br/>
* Sucking on hard candy, frozen fruit bar, or spoonful of peanut butter or<br/>
marshmallow fluff<br/>
* Licorice tug-of-war, blow pin wheels or various types of blow toys,<br/>
bubbles and whistles<br/>
* Pushing against walls with the hands, shoulders, back, buttocks and head<br/>
* Cuddling or back rubbing<br/>
* Taking a bath<br/>
* Being rolled tightly like a hot dog in a blanket<br/>
* Being squished under a therapy ball, mat or couch cushion<br/>
* Tug-of-war<br/>
* Wheelbarrow walking, jumping games like hop scotch<br/>
* Crashing games-run and dive into boxes, bean bags and couch cushions<br/>
* Pulling a wagon, carrying a heavy book bag, digging in the yard or<br/>
carrying groceries<br/>
* Sports such as wrestling and football<br/>
* Deep pressure (giving a massage) and joint compressions (holding above one<br/>
joint and under one joint then doing a quick 10 repetitions of compressions,<br/>
pushing and pulling)<br/>
* A mini trampoline<br/>
* A sockem bopper or whatever they call those weighted kid-sized things that<br/>
spring back up after you knock them down<br/>

<br/>
A Joyce-page called &quot;I am trying so hard not to yell&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to go and read it there, the text (minus the clear <br/>
formatting) is this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===Myself, I am trying so hard not to yell and to let things go.===<br/>
<br/>
 What helps a lot is seeing the world through children&#39;s understanding of it. <br/>
If we can understand the reasons behind their actions, then it&#39;s easier not <br/>
to be upset when they aren&#39;t doing what we think they should.<br/>
<br/>
 ===I don&#39;t want to just be there and I don&#39;t want to yell.===<br/>
<br/>
 There&#39;s a whole world in between :-)<br/>
<br/>
 Give yourself a new role in their lives. Rather than being their director, <br/>
be their facilitator.<br/>
 You can be with them. You can enter into their world and help them get what <br/>
they&#39;re trying to get and explore what they&#39;re trying to explore.<br/>
<br/>
 If you were watching a favorite movie would you rather that a parent had <br/>
ignored you, yelled at you to turn it off, made snide remarks about you watching <br/>
trash, or sat beside you and talked about the movie as a friend might, sharing <br/>
what you each like and didn&#39;t like about it?<br/>
<br/>
 It helps to appreciate that they are perfect as who they are right now and <br/>
not try to focus on them not being what they should be as adults. What I mean <br/>
by that is that we shouldn&#39;t see a 4 yo who hits as signs that he&#39;ll be an <br/>
adult who hits. We shouldn&#39;t see it as something that needs trained out of them or <br/>
they&#39;ll be stuck with it. We should see it as perfectly natural for who they <br/>
are and they need help figuring out better ways to handle their emotions.<br/>
<br/>
 A sitting 9 mo old isn&#39;t destined to be a sitting adult ;-) They will grow <br/>
and change because it&#39;s natural, not because we&#39;ve trained them to do something <br/>
else. They may even run a marathon in there, but it won&#39;t be because we <br/>
trained them not to sit ;-) If we trust that kids don&#39;t want to be hurtful and just <br/>
need help gaining the skills to stop themselves and figure out new ways, then <br/>
it&#39;s easier to change the role we take on in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
 ===My son is extremely spirited, so am I, so we do clash a lot.===<br/>
<br/>
 Have you read some of the books people often recommend for challenging <br/>
children? Raising Your Spirited Child by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka and The Explosive <br/>
Child by Dr. Ross Greene.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===The other day I told him that I wanted him to pick up his toys in his <br/>
room, he opened his bedroom window and started yelling for someone to get his dad <br/>
and to help him! I hadn&#39;t even yelled at him, he just didn&#39;t want to clean his <br/>
room!===<br/>
<br/>
 What if your husband wanted you to reroof the house? What if you knew that <br/>
if he suggested something that was it, period, there was no getting out of it? <br/>
He might help you. He might work along side of you. But when he wanted you to <br/>
do something, he was depositing the burden of the task on your shoulders and <br/>
you were going to have to get up on that roof and strip it down and nail down <br/>
new shingles regardless of your feelings about it.<br/>
<br/>
 Cleaning up seems much smaller than that to us as adults, but from inside <br/>
kids cleaning up feels like reroofing the house.<br/>
<br/>
 What if your son didn&#39;t like the way you kept your room? What if he came in <br/>
and told you to put your stuff away in the way he thought it best. The first <br/>
time it might be amusing ;-) After weeks of his seemingly whimsical demands <br/>
about how you keep your stuff and your corner of the world that you didn&#39;t have <br/>
the option to ignore, how would you feel?<br/>
<br/>
 If the room bothers you, then ask if he wouldn&#39;t mind if you cleaned it up. <br/>
Judge for yourself whether you should ask if he&#39;d like to help right now. If <br/>
he&#39;s used to you &quot;asking&quot; when you are really telling him (that is when you <br/>
&quot;ask&quot; &quot;no&quot; isn&#39;t an acceptable answer) then it&#39;s not going to sound like a <br/>
question. Or he may think it&#39;s a way to manipulate him into helping.<br/>
<br/>
 See the task as yours because it&#39;s something important to you.<br/>
<br/>
 ===We also have a hard time with him acting out because he has asthma and <br/>
allergies. When they are full swing, he physically can&#39;t control himself and he <br/>
will sometimes get too rough with my 15 month old.===<br/>
<br/>
 Rather than labeling it &quot;acting out&quot; which focuses on the action, look at <br/>
what he&#39;s feeling inside and why he&#39;s behaving as he does.<br/>
<br/>
 Talk to him at calm times about what he&#39;s feeling before he gets rough. He <br/>
needs that awareness of what&#39;s going on internally before he can even attempt <br/>
to figure out how to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
 At 4 -- or even at 6 or 10 or 27! -- he may not know what to do so you&#39;ll <br/>
need to go slowly and not pressure him. He may not even realize there&#39;s a build <br/>
up. Ask him if he can pay attention next time. Maybe have him talk about what <br/>
was going on that led up to it. And ask him about his feelings. Or supply them <br/>
for him, like &quot;You must have felt frustrated.&quot; Don&#39;t try to turn it into a <br/>
lecture on what he should have done. The goal is self awareness so he can help <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
 (But of course stop him when he&#39;s playing rough! The baby needs to feel that <br/>
home is a safe place for him. You don&#39;t need to be angry. Just firm that <br/>
hurting isn&#39;t allowed.)<br/>
<br/>
 Learning how to identify feelings is probably like learning how to identify <br/>
wine. Just as even the most wine-ignorant adults can tell a red wine from a <br/>
white wine ;-) kids probably have the easy emotions figured out: happy, sad, <br/>
mad. But the rest get lumped under one of those categories. They need help <br/>
identifying the nuances. We can help by labeling what they must be feeling. Or <br/>
labeling what a character on TV or in a book might be feeling in a situation.<br/>
<br/>
 And talk about other things he could do when he has the feelings coming on. <br/>
Offer them as help, not in a shaming way that says &quot;I can&#39;t believe you did <br/>
that instead of this.&quot; Above all make sure he knows being rough with the baby is <br/>
not okay. Even better is talking about what might happen in a particular <br/>
situation and helping him plan ahead on what he could do instead. Don&#39;t expect him <br/>
to act as he planned. It&#39;s a learning process. Knowing that keeping the bike <br/>
wheels moving makes the bike more stable isn&#39;t the same as being able to do <br/>
it. It takes lots of practice before what you know in your head is right becomes <br/>
second nature.<br/>
<br/>
 (Sandra Dodd has said when her kids were little she said, &quot;You can hit each <br/>
other only if first you talk about it, second you get a grown up to help you <br/>
settle it, and if that doesn&#39;t work, THEN you can hit.&quot; So when they hit each <br/>
other, she&#39;d ask if they&#39;d talked about it, and if they&#39;d asked an adult to <br/>
help. Not done in a shaming way, but a helpful way.)<br/>
<br/>
 He will make mistakes. And when he makes mistakes you want him to feel free <br/>
to come to you for help. If you&#39;ve made it clear that hurting the baby is not <br/>
okay and he slips up, it&#39;s not because he missed the part about where hurting <br/>
the baby is not okay and needs reminded. It&#39;s because he needs help handling <br/>
the turmoil of feelings inside.<br/>
<br/>
 Be there with them and aware as much as you can so you can start noticing <br/>
the symptoms and help redirect him. If he isn&#39;t yet capable of not hurting the <br/>
baby, then don&#39;t leave them alone together. Not as a punishment to say you <br/>
don&#39;t trust him, but because they both deserve to feel safe in their own home. If <br/>
there were a dog about to bite him, he&#39;d want to trust that you&#39;d be there to <br/>
snatch him up out of harm&#39;s way, not hover in the background and then yell at <br/>
the dog.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d recommend Rescue Remedy, both for you and your son... I call it our <br/>
&quot;calm medicine&quot; or homeopathic remedy for my chi :)  See: BachFlower.com <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bachflower.com/rescue_remedy.htm">http://www.bachflower.com/rescue_remedy.htm</a>&gt;  I found it when my ds was <br/>
having fits (for lack of a better word) that I couldn&#39;t understand or <br/>
remain calm to sort out.  Now I use it more for *me* when I&#39;m triggered <br/>
by his behavior, it gives me that necessary space from the situation to <br/>
calmly decide what to do.  We&#39;ve also used some individual flower <br/>
essences for other issues:<br/>
When Hayden was asked &quot;red shirt or blue?&quot; he would choose one and <br/>
ruminate all day that he made the wrong choice, we used Cerato:<br/>
*&gt;&gt;Cerato*: This Essence helps you when you have a hard time making <br/>
decisions. When you have to make a decision; such as, where to live, <br/>
what to wear or where to go. You tend to seek advise and confirmations <br/>
from others, not listening to your own intuition. You might often follow <br/>
others advise and later regret is, since you actually knew that it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be what you wanted.*  Cerato* helps you listening to your own <br/>
wisdom and follow it.<br/>
<br/>
For me, when I was/am on the verge of behaving as I don&#39;t want to, I use <br/>
Cherry Plum:<br/>
*&gt;&gt;Cherry Plum:* This helps you when you are on the verge of breakdown, <br/>
possible suicide. You feel in such despair that you feel that you are <br/>
loosing your sanity. You have a feeling that you are going to explode <br/>
and are afraid to give way to violent impulses. *Cherry Plum *helps you <br/>
to find an inner balance so that you can think and act rationally.<br/>
<br/>
I keep a few others on hand in case I feel the need, sometimes just <br/>
knowing they&#39;re here helps.  I&#39;ve often sent Hayden into stressful <br/>
situations with RR in his pocket and he holds it when he needs to (i.e. <br/>
afternoon at gramma&#39;s house), but rarely doses himself. <br/>
<br/>
Now outside of medicine, I *HIGHLY* recommend Sandra&#39;s Peaceful <br/>
Parenting tape.  I&#39;ve listened to it many times and the wisdom it <br/>
contains is absolutely priceless!!  Maybe you can squirt yourself with <br/>
some RR and put on the tape ~ you&#39;ll be ready to be fully present for <br/>
whatever your child brings to you next &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>
