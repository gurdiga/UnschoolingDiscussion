Like canaries in coalmines, which once signaled the existence of<br/>
life-threatening gases before human miners could perceive them, tropical<br/>
glaciers are a warning for our civilization. That is the message of a growing<br/>
body of research on climate change that has focused on melting glaciers and<br/>
ice caps on mountains in Africa and South America. <br/>
<br/>
Lonnie G. Thompson, a prize-winning researcher at Ohio State University, has<br/>
been leading ice cap studies for two decades. His research offers a response<br/>
to climate-change skeptics, who argue that the earth has experienced vast<br/>
fluctuations in climate in the past and that there is no proof that human<br/>
actions are responsible for the current increase in global temperatures. <br/>
<br/>
In a paper presented at the 2001 annual meeting of the American Association<br/>
for the Advancement of Science, Thompson revealed that some 82 percent of the<br/>
massive ice field on Tanzania&#39;s fabled Mount Kilimanjaro has disappeared since<br/>
it was first mapped in 1912. <br/>
<br/>
This week, in the October 18 issue of the journal Science, Thompson and 10<br/>
colleagues have published the results of a study of six ice corps from<br/>
Kilimanjaro, which document climate and environmental variability over nearly<br/>
12,000 years. The period of the greatest historically recorded drought in<br/>
tropical Africa, some 4,000 years ago, was so severe that it has been<br/>
considered instrumental in the collapse of a number of civilizations,<br/>
including the Old Kingdom of Egypt. That drought was known to extend into the<br/>
Middle East and western Asia, and Thompson&#39;s research in the Andes of northern<br/>
Peru indicates that it may have been much more extensive. <br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, the findings of Thompson&#39;s team suggest that the current pace of<br/>
climate change in eastern equatorial Africa is without precedent in its<br/>
implications for human civilization. The melting of tropical glaciers is,<br/>
according to Thompson, &quot;an indicator of massive changes taking place and a<br/>
response to the changes in climate.&quot; The evidence of the retreat and loss of<br/>
these large bodies of ice are part of the evidence that has convinced him that<br/>
global warming has begun to make an irreversible mark on the planet. <br/>
<br/>
The ice of high-altitude glaciers is likely to be severely damaging to the<br/>
areas above which they tower. &quot;The loss of these frozen reservoirs threaten<br/>
water resources for hydroelectric power production in the region, and for crop<br/>
irrigation and municipal water supplies,&quot; Thompson says. <br/>
<br/>
What the governments of those countries are doing, he says, &quot;is cashing in on<br/>
a bank account that was built over thousands of years but isn&#39;t being<br/>
replenished. Once it&#39;s gone, it will be difficult to re-form.&quot; Loss of those<br/>
water sources will likely result in a substantial increase in the use of<br/>
fossil fuels, resulting in the addition to the atmosphere of the greenhouse<br/>
gases that intensify global warming. <br/>
<br/>
Other recently published research has documented a 40-percent shrinkage of the<br/>
ice cap on Mount Kenya since 1963. In September the government of Kenya issued<br/>
what the Nation newspaper in Nairobi called a &quot;red alert&quot;, warning that<br/>
streams from the mountain&#39;s slopes were drying up. The paper reported that<br/>
Kenya&#39;s Central Provincial Water Engineer Tom Ogola revoked all water<br/>
&quot;abstraction&quot; permits, warning of a severe shortage of water everywhere. &quot;Most<br/>
water is being consumed on the slopes by farmers,&quot; Ogola said. &quot;Conflicts<br/>
could occur if water does not reach the downstream communities.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Thompson sees the potential impact on local communities as broader than the<br/>
crisis of water supplies. He points to African concerns that the loss of<br/>
Kilimanjaro&#39;s ice cap will be devastating to the tourist trade that brings<br/>
thousands of people to the region each year and fuels Tanzania&#39;s economy. <br/>
<br/>
But he also sees the problem as an urgent challenge to scientists and policy<br/>
makers globally to tackle the issue of global warming. &quot;We need to take the<br/>
first steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,&quot; he says. &quot;We are currently<br/>
doing nothing.&quot;</div>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, isn&#39;t that sad? We could definitely see evidence when we were up <br/>
in the crater of the previous extent of the glaciers. It was like <br/>
looking at the ghost of it&#39;s former presence. <br/>
<br/>
Our Unitarian church did a very moving service solely on global <br/>
warming last month. Eye-opening and inspiring and kind-of scary. Wake <br/>
up and smell the melting snow indeed!<br/>
