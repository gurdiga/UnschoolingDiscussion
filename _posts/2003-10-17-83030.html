As our report points out more than once, the vast majority of home schoolin=<br/>

parents are doing a good job of both raising and educationg their children.=<br/>
 <br/>
The point of our series is to report that some bad parents are hiding under=<br/>

know.<br/>

Subject: Homeschooling Report<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, October 16, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Dear CBS Evening News,<br/>
<br/>
I was disheartened with the homeschooling report that was done on CBS <br/>
evening news this week because it did not meet my need for honesty and <br/>
integrity.<br/>
<br/>
I am truly saddened to know that some families that homeschool have harmed =<br/>
<br/>
their children as I am saddened to think of the many children who go to sch=<br/>
ool <br/>
who are harmed not only by their parents at home but by the violence in <br/>
schools as well. When I think of violence I am not only thinking of physica=<br/>
l <br/>
violence, I am thinking of the way we communicate with each other with our =<br/>
<br/>
words. I think of how we label and accuse each other of wrong doing rather =<br/>
<br/>
than asking for what we want in life so we give others the chance to meet o=<br/>
ur <br/>
needs for peace, safety and joy.<br/>
<br/>
I am alarmed and annoyed that we still seek to blame something or someone. =<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what annoyed me about the homeschooling report. That <br/>
homeschooling was blamed for the abuse the children received. I neither <br/>
want to blame homeschooling or school for violence children experience. I <br/>
see acts of violence to children often. I have seen children spanked which =<br/>
<br/>
didn&#39;t meet the child&#39;s need for physical safety. I have heard children sha=<br/>
med <br/>
when they spoke up for what they need.<br/>
<br/>
When I think of safety and peace for children, I want to focus on how we he=<br/>
al <br/>
ourselves as parents. I believe only someone in deep, deep pain could do <br/>
what happened in the stories shared on the news. Only someone in deep <br/>
pain could go into a school and shoot their friends and teachers. Only <br/>
someone in deep pain could kill their siblings and then kill himself. These=<br/>
 <br/>
tragic situations need our attention to meet our needs for healing and safe=<br/>
ty. <br/>
What triggered the pain in the children who kill their friends? What trigge=<br/>
red <br/>
the pain in the parents who killed their children? I think to blame the tra=<br/>
gic <br/>
events on school or homeschooling is overly simplistic and prevents us from=<br/>
 <br/>
digging deeper into the tragic events to find solutions that create peace a=<br/>
nd <br/>
healing.<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that more regulations will ensure the prevention of these =<br/>
<br/>
tragedies. We have enough regulation. What I wish for is healing the pain s=<br/>
o <br/>
we can prevent tragic events from ever occurring. I want parents to get hel=<br/>
p so <br/>
they can heal their deep wounds, so that they can love their children. All =<br/>
<br/>
children need thisall humans need this.<br/>
<br/>
And I want reporting that gets to the heart of the issue for me, which is s=<br/>
afety <br/>
and peace. I want reporting that removes the interpretations out of the <br/>
observations. I want reporting that sticks with the facts and brings our fe=<br/>
elings <br/>
and needs into consideration without over using our feeling of fear and nee=<br/>
d <br/>
for safety. Would you be willing to do this? Take the interpretations and b=<br/>
lame <br/>
out of your reporting? Would you be willing to report what is triggering th=<br/>
e <br/>
pain in the parents that manifests in tragedy?<br/>

<br/>
Yes you have something there.  <br/>
<br/>
This past spring in Montana the legislature was considering a bill that<br/>
would require homeschooled kids to test at certain grade levels.   There<br/>
was the frantic call to all homeschoolers to show their solid &quot;we&#39;re all<br/>
in this together&quot; dedication to protecting homeschool freedoms.   <br/>
The cookie cutter statements to the legislature were based in opposition<br/>
to government oversight of a parents &quot;God given right to educate our<br/>
children in the way we see fit.&quot;   It *was* a movement.  A big show and<br/>
voice for the same &quot;movement&quot; that in Wyoming worked to make bruising<br/>
ones own children legal.   <br/>
<br/>
That Montana legislation was written by a senator who&#39;s adopted children<br/>
had come from an abusive and homeschooling family.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s disturbing and you&#39;re right.  Thinking now about how much support<br/>
and pressure these folks get from their church community, it&#39;s impossible<br/>
to separate individual fanatics from the whole, huge, powerful, dangerous<br/>
movement.  <br/>

&gt;   while me stats are on the old side (From the &#39;80&#39;s) stats, at that  <br/>
&gt; time showed that each letter counted as  letters. That took into  <br/>

&gt; that wrote and didn&#39;t mail it and the folks that didn&#39;t realize they  <br/>

&gt;   A few letters are not going to sway anyone in the media. The only  <br/>
&gt; that matters is the money. We vote w/ our pocketbooks. When we tell  <br/>
