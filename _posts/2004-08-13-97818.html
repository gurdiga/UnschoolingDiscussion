 </span></blockquote>  LOL. He&#39;s pretty much got honourary Canuck status here. He even made some <br/>
pretty direct comments about our recent election (dissing the right wing party <br/>
here) and there was no uproar from Canadians about an American sticking his <br/>
nose where it doesn&#39;t belong...because, I guess, he does belong. Of course we&#39;re <br/>
always flattered when we find an American that knows as much or more about us <br/>
and our politics then we do. It&#39;s usually the other way around. :)<br/>

I just remembered the other thing he said, which cracked me up. He said, <br/>
&quot;Canadians really do like us, you know. They just wish we would read and pay <br/>
attention more.&quot;<br/>
