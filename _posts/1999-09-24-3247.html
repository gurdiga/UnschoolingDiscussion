<div id="ygrps-yiv-47330575">I prayed.  I said to God, &quot;You know what I need.  You know my life is a mess <br/>
and I don&#39;t know how to fix it.  Please help.&quot;  It&#39;s almost comical to see <br/>
what&#39;s been going on here, but all in God&#39;s time I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Mark did do some of the dishes.  Then he went out and bought cereal, milk, <br/>
paper plates and bowls, plastic utensils and cups.  He ordered Chinese food <br/>
for lunch.  The kids had cereal and potato chips for dinner.  I have not <br/>
lifted a finger today to help anyone do anything.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going on retreat this weekend.  Maybe they&#39;ll appreciate me when I get <br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Jill</div>

And if you ever come back from being on strike, this sounds like a good way <br/>
to go.  Many things can be eaten off of paper plates.  I think you could <br/>
probably live on various sandwiches.  <br/>
<br/>
Low standards, that&#39;s the key to my sanity around here.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your retreat -- I am jealous -- it sounds quiet!<br/>
