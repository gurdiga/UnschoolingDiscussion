Actually what is funny is when other homeschoolers ask my daughter if she has finished for the year (in June)  or if she talks about stuff we are doing - (We are currently into reading the Little House Books and making recipes and things from the Little House Cookbook...) they say - &quot;Oh, you have to do school in the summer?&quot; - To which she just looks puzzled.  I think that was one of the things that won me over to unschooling - although I still am very new -  when I looked at what our summers were like - we just did what we wanted to do...whereas - following a curriculm - well, you know  how that goes... ;-)<br/>
