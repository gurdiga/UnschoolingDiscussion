<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644753512"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;While I might describe this as an interesting experience, its been a <br/>
&gt;bit nasty and venemously confrontational, neither of which is <br/>
&gt;something that I espouse or wish my kids to learn in their <br/>
&gt;homeschooling or home life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But this list also presents the opportunity, when things get intemperate,<br/>
to reach out with understanding, or partial understanding to the other<br/>
person.  Yah, it doesn&#39;t happen every time, but it&#39;s still a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
While people&#39;s positions may sound &quot;entrenched&quot;, they actually haven&#39;t dug<br/>
deep holes with shovels around their computers.  The seemingly-entrenched<br/>
positions can be modified and/or abandoned. Or re-explained in milder<br/>
terms.<br/>
<br/>
On lists like this, people CAN disagree completely on one issue and still<br/>
find common ground on another.  They don&#39;t NECESSARILY become lifelong<br/>
enemies.  (Although, in the past in other forums, I have seen<br/>
grudge-holding create a really negative climate.)<br/>
<br/>
But I still think there&#39;s a silver lining or a pony folded into this<br/>
communications medium, somewhere.<br/>
