Colcannon is an Irish dish that is rich in tradition and history.<br/>
It&#39;s also a perfect recipe to make with the kids while sharing it&#39;s<br/>
interesting history!  It&#39;s traditionally made on All Saints Day or<br/>
Halloween and some families would leave out a plate of it, with a<br/>
lump of butter in the center for the fairies and the ghosts. There is<br/>
even a traditional Irish song that was written long ago about<br/>
colcannon that you can sing while preparing it!<br/>
<br/>
Did you ever eat colcannon<br/>
When &#39;twas made with yellow cream<br/>
And the kale and praties blended<br/>
Like the picture in a dream?<br/>
<br/>
Did you ever take a forkful<br/>
And dip it in the lake<br/>
Of heather-flavored butter<br/>
That your mother used to make?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you did, yes you did!<br/>
So did he and so did I,<br/>
And the more I think about it<br/>
Sure, the more I want to cry.<br/>
<br/>
God be with the happy times<br/>
When trouble we had not,<br/>
And our mothers made Colcannon<br/>
In the little three-legged pot.<br/>
<br/>
(The little pot was known as a Bastable oven, which looked a<br/>
little like a cauldron with a lid that was put over a fire and used<br/>
as an oven to bake bread and other dishes. )<br/>
<br/>
Traditional charms were put in the colcannon that symbolized<br/>
different things. A button meant you would remain a bachelor<br/>
and a thimble meant you would remain a spinster for the coming<br/>
year. A ring meant you would get married and a coin meant<br/>
you would come into wealth. Gather the family together and make<br/>
this simple, but fun recipe for dinner!<br/>
<br/>
The Colcannon Recipe<br/>
Ingredients:<br/>
1 pound cabbage<br/>
2 pounds russet or yukon gold potatoes<br/>
2 small leeks, green onions or scallions<br/>
1 cup milk<br/>
Salt and pepper, to taste<br/>
1/2 cup (1 stick) plus 2 tablespoons butter<br/>
dash of nutmeg or mace<br/>
<br/>
Core, quarter and shred the cabbage and place in a pan, covering<br/>
with boiled salted water til tender-about 15 minutes. Peel and cut<br/>
the potatoes into 2 inch pieces and cook those too in salted water<br/>
for about 15 minutes in another pan. (Assign duties to different family<br/>
members!) Drain the cabbage and chop into very small pieces. Drain<br/>
the potatoes and mash by hand. Do not use a processor or mixer!<br/>
Meanwhile, wash and chop the onion-use what is available to you,<br/>
using the middle parts-not the root end or rough ends of the green<br/>
part. In a pan large enough to hold the cooked potatoes and cabbage,<br/>
combine the onions and milk and cook over medium heat until they<br/>
are tender, about 8 to10 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Add the potatoes, salt, pepper, and mace to the onions and milk and<br/>
stir over low heat until well-blended. Add the cabbage and 1/2 cup of<br/>
butter and stir again to the consistency of mashed potatoes. Mound<br/>
the mixture in the middle of a platter and make an indentation. Add<br/>
the remainder of the butter.  Serves 4 to 6.<br/>

<br/>
Is this the same as bubble and squeak?<br/>
<br/>
My 7yod decided that the leprechauns were going to leave little treats for<br/>
St. Patrick&#39;s day.  I had two unopened packs of M&Ms, so I put them in the<br/>
box she&#39;d left out for them.  I was hoping one of the bags would be full of<br/>
all gold M&Ms, but we weren&#39;t that lucky.<br/>
<br/>
My mil grew up with two leprechauns in her house - Jilly and Jolly.<br/>
