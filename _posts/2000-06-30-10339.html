<br/>
so, i&#39;m confused here... what is this?  dia emailed you privately... you said <br/>
you were not reading the mail... so you sent it to all of us to read?  you <br/>
did not read it?  what is wrong with it?  she has some valid points, don&#39;t <br/>
you think?  it&#39;s not rude or anything... she is just stating her opinion... <br/>

<br/>
Right now, for instance, my 2 kids are &quot;dissecting&quot; one of those Headstart <br/>
computers from Tiger.  It finally died this AM and my daughter wanted to <br/>
&quot;dissect it to see what&#39;s inside&quot; -- &quot;can we, can we, Mom??&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Now, if only I knew what any of that stuff was.<br/>

you want another type of discussion, I think most of us would be willing to <br/>
