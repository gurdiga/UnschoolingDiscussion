<div id="ygrps-yiv-343484546">Thanks! <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate hearing about everyones messy homes!  I<br/>
know I shouldn&#39;t expect kids to be neat. I do provide<br/>
a house that says yes to them.  We have baskets and<br/>
containers galore. The dining room in our small<br/>
apartment is not where we eat its the kids play room. <br/>
I wasn&#39;t prepared for the kitchen exploration<br/>
play/science.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to put all kinds of things together in a<br/>
science box and keep it in the bathroom!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Samantha<br/>
