My  daughter never really was a big fan of taking baths or showers, <br/>
and it was  never much of an issue because a young child who doesn&#39;t <br/>
produce body odor  CAN go days without showers and it&#39;s not a huge <br/>
deal.  <br/>
<br/>
But  now that she&#39;s getting older (11), she smells pretty bad and has <br/>
greasy  hair if she goes a few days without a shower.  I&#39;ve talked to <br/>
her  about the importance of regular bathing.  She doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
fair  that she has to take a bath regularly and I pointed out that <br/>
it&#39;s not just  her, it&#39;s ALL people past a certain age who will smell <br/>
if they don&#39;t stay  clean.  I told her that people might think poorly <br/>
of her if she  smells bad and has greasy looking hair.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried getting her  nice soaps and shower gels(she likes that when <br/>
they&#39;re new but the novelty  wears off soon and she doesn&#39;t care <br/>
anymore), I offered to light candles  for her (she says she doesn&#39;t <br/>
care about candles), I offered to take a  shower with her and we could <br/>
wash each other&#39;s backs (she said  no)...<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, how much would you remind/try to convince an  11 <br/>
year old to shower?  For example, I noticed on Thursday that she  <br/>
really needed a shower, so I suggested it to her.  She said, &quot;Maybe  <br/>
later&quot;.  So I reminded her again later in the day (like 9 pm) and she  <br/>
said, &quot;later&quot;.  She never did.  Friday she was REALLY smelling  bad, <br/>
and I told her that.  She said, &quot;later&quot;.  I reminded her  again, and <br/>
she said, &quot;First thing tomorrow morning, I promise&quot;.   Saturday <br/>
morning she didn&#39;t shower.  Nor did she all day  Saturday.  Today, I <br/>
said, &quot;How about if you take a shower and then  pick out some nail <br/>
polish and I&#39;ll paint your toenails after your  shower?  So she did.  <br/>
<br/>
Am I nagging too much?  If I  remind her once and she doesn&#39;t do it, <br/>
should I keep reminding her or just  let it go?  What about the issue <br/>
of body odor and not wanting other  people to look down on her?  <br/>

Ah, pre-teens! I&#39;ve spent time in a car with bunches of stinky pre-teens,  <br/>
and it&#39;s not pretty!<br/>
 <br/>
First, I&#39;d try really hard to let go of fear of other people&#39;s judgements.  <br/>
Right now she doesn&#39;t seem to care too much anyway, and when she does she&#39;ll  <br/>
feel bad about herself. I know that&#39;s not what you want.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s fair to point out that when she smells it&#39;s kind of unpleasant to be  <br/>
near her, especially in a closed space. Would she be open to compromise? Maybe  <br/>
use a washcloth every day in the smelly bits, along with some deodorant? She  <br/>
could pick out one of those teen, fruity kinds of deodorant.  That will  help.<br/>
 <br/>
About the hair. Get some dry shampoo...one of those things for quick  <br/>
touch-ups. The other thing that works to cut the grease is putting a little  powder <br/>
on a hairbrush and brushing it through.  She might like these things  because <br/>
they won&#39;t interrupt her life as much as a bath or shower. Then every  few days <br/>
or so she could do a &quot;deep clean.&quot;  Just don&#39;t try to make her  not-a-kid too <br/>
fast. This is a very &quot;kid&quot; thing, and she&#39;s clearly not ready to  be a young <br/>
adult yet.<br/>
 <br/>
This is one of those things you&#39;ll remember in a year or two when she&#39;s in  <br/>
the bathroom a LOT. Isn&#39;t that weird about parents and child development? We  <br/>
really need to lighten up, and sometimes it&#39;s SO hard to do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204706330">Sarah (13) was like that around age 11.  I bought her some deodorant and<br/>
would mention the smell to her when it got to a noticeable level.<br/>
<br/>
Within the last year, she&#39;s moved from not wanting to shower at all to<br/>
spending a minimum of 20 minutes in the shower, plus another 20 minutes<br/>
using various creams and hair products and make up before she&#39;s ready to go<br/>
anywhere.<br/>

I didn&#39;t remember that about myself at that age, but then again I <br/>

It&#39;s nice to get advice like that. I have friends who I haven&#39;t <br/>
discussed this with because I know their response would be, &quot;Make her <br/>
take showers and if she doesn&#39;t shower she loses privelages...&quot;  Ick! <br/>

They LIKE to.<br/>

Sometimes when Kirby was 12ish I&#39;d remind him.  The other two, I don&#39;t <br/>
remember a time.  (Maybe Kirby reminded them. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Well she loses the privilege of smelling like she just took a shower. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
