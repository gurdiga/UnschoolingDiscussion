<br/>
-=-The spread of the post-geographic work style and flex-time  <br/>
economy, in which managers can work at odd hours in any number of  <br/>
locations, is also playing a role. So is the fact that more knowledge  <br/>
workers want to live in more than one place. Homeschooling can  <br/>
untether families from Zip codes and school districts, just as the  <br/>
Internet can de-link kids from classrooms, piping economics tutorials  <br/>
from the Federal Reserve, online tours of Florence&#39;s Uffizi Gallery,  <br/>
ornithology seminars from Cornell University, and filmmaking classes  <br/>
from UCLA straight onto laptops and handhelds. Also driving the trend  <br/>
is a new cottage industry of private tutors, cyber communities,  <br/>
online curriculum providers, and parental co-ops. Popular online  <br/>
sites range from the humanities tutor edsitement.neh.gov to the  <br/>
agenda-free lifeofflorida.org. &quot;It would have been impossible to  <br/>
homeschool like this 20 years ago,&quot; says Richard Florida, author of  <br/>
The Flight of the Creative Class.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The Internet is a chief resource that&#39;s powering homeschooling&#39;s  <br/>
growth, from 850,000 children in 1999 to more than 1.1 million today,  <br/>
according to the U.S. Education Dept. The popular perception is that  <br/>
people homeschool for religious reasons. But the No. 1 motivation,  <br/>
research shows, is concern about school environments, including  <br/>
negative peer pressure, safety, and drugs. In some circles  <br/>
homeschooling is even attaining a reputation as a secret weapon for  <br/>
Ivy League admission.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s presented in such a way that there&#39;s really nothing to debate,  <br/>
and in that way it&#39;s the tightest presentation of homeschooling I can  <br/>
remember seeing, ever.<br/>

My sister - who has no children, and doesn&#39;t necessarily agree that<br/>
home/unschooling is best for mine - sent me this link today.  I read<br/>
the article, then read the below post from Sandra (haven&#39;t read the<br/>
newsweek article yet); thought it intriguing that the exerpts Sandra<br/>
made highlighted the benefits of the Internet/computer use, whereas<br/>
the education/computer &quot;expert&quot; in the Orion article bemoans the<br/>
computer&#39;s tendency to separate kids from real life. (Didn&#39;t someone<br/>
once say that about TV...?)<br/>
Guess it&#39;s a matter of user-failure -- or success!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow.  That address looks so much like The Onion! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But Orion...  in the &quot;about Orion&quot; it says this:<br/>
-=-ABOUT ORION MAGAZINE<br/>
Orion explores an emerging alternative world view. Informed by a  <br/>
growing ecological awareness and the need for cultural change, it is  <br/>
a forum for thoughtful and creative ideas and practical examples of  <br/>
how we might live justly, wisely, and artfully on Earth.<br/>
<br/>
Since 1982, Orion has worked to reconnect human culture with the  <br/>
natural world, blending scientific thinking with the arts, engaging  <br/>
the heart and mind, and striving to make clear what we all have in  <br/>
common.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like living artfully on earth is better if you commune with  <br/>
something besides computers, and yet there they are, with a big  <br/>
hypocritical  website.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, Cris, quote this back to your sister and say the article  <br/>
doesn&#39;t apply to unschooling:&#39;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Rather than attempt to compensate for a growing disconnect from  <br/>
nature, schools seem more and more committed to reinforcing it, a  <br/>
problem that began long before the use of computers. Even relying on  <br/>
books too much or too early inhibits the ability of children to  <br/>
develop direct relationships with the subjects they are studying-=-<br/>
<br/>
Tell her you&#39;re not relying on books OR computers &quot;too much or too  <br/>
early,&quot; and that unschooling is all about direct learning by MANY means.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So the article is titled &quot;Charlotte&#39;s Webpage: Why children shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
have the world at their fingertips.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re discussing classrooms, and book reports.    A quote about  <br/>
&quot;the problem&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
-=-The teacher explained that her students were so enthusiastic about  <br/>
the project that they chose to go to the computer lab rather than  <br/>
outside for recess. While she seemed impressed by this dedication, it  <br/>
underscores the first troubling influence of computers. The medium is  <br/>
so compelling that it lures children away from the kind of activities  <br/>
through which they have always most effectively discovered themselves  <br/>
and their place in the world.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, I doubt that this author has been &quot;outside for recess&quot; in a  <br/>
public school lately.  That is NOT where people discover themselves  <br/>
and their place in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is artsy and poetic, but it doesn&#39;t mean much:  &quot;If children do  <br/>
not dip their toes in the waters of unsupervised social activity,  <br/>
they likely will never be able to swim in the sea of civic  <br/>
responsibility.&quot;    For one thing, &quot;Myspace&quot; is quite an unsupervised  <br/>
social activity. &lt;g&gt;  And to glorify school recess for being less  <br/>
supervised seems crazy to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If they have no opportunities to dig in the soil, discover the  <br/>
spiders, bugs, birds, and plants that populate even the smallest  <br/>
unpaved playgrounds,-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
REALLY!?  We had a big playground, but there were no spiders, bugs,  <br/>
birds or plants.  There was sandy dirt, with some gravel and some  <br/>
broken glass.  One year there were three piles of dry cowdung,  <br/>
because they had planned to plant something.  They never did.  We  <br/>
played king of the mountain on piles of poo until it was evenly  <br/>
scattered over the two acres of unpaved playground we had.  We did  <br/>
have six trees or so, honey locust or something with thorns and seed  <br/>
pods.  We weren&#39;t in danger of learning the fragility of flower  <br/>
petals on that playground.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt; Guess it&#39;s a matter of user-failure -- or success!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a matter of the definition of success of the reporter.   <br/>
Orion wants kids to be artists and poets in tune with the biological  <br/>
world.  Business Week wants to know how people are spending their  <br/>
money, and whether those kids can get into Harvard.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the orion article:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yet these projects�the steady diet of virtual trips to the  <br/>
Antarctic, virtual climbs to the summit of Mount Everest, and trips  <br/>
into cyber-orbit that represent one technological high after another� <br/>
generate only vicarious thrills. The student doesn&#39;t actually soar  <br/>
above the Earth, doesn&#39;t trek across icy terrain, doesn&#39;t climb a  <br/>
mountain. Increasingly, she isn&#39;t even allowed to climb to the top of  <br/>
the jungle gym.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
What about books?  Same for books, only books don&#39;t have moving color  <br/>
photos taken yesterday (or a second before).  And kids can&#39;t ask a  <br/>
question of a book.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For children, belonging is the most important function a community  <br/>
serves. Indeed, that is the message that lies at the heart of  <br/>
Charlotte&#39;s Web. None of us�whether of barnyard or human society� <br/>
thrives without a sense of belonging. In my case, belonging hinged  <br/>
most decisively on place-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids find belonging online AND in real life, where they have more  <br/>
social life than I had when I was in high school and clubs, and I was  <br/>
pretty busy.  The argument that belonging has only to do with place  <br/>
is small.  Those Orion readers and writers are probably scattered all  <br/>
over the world, but they consider themselves a community, I&#39;m sure.   <br/>
They have something in common with those who believe as they do, and  <br/>
they are clearly communicating by mail and by websites.<br/>
<br/>
Of computer students he had worked with in gifted and talented  <br/>
programs:  -=-They preferred discussing cultural diversity with  <br/>
students on the other side of the world through the Internet rather  <br/>
than conversing with the school&#39;s own ESL students, many of whom came  <br/>
from the very same parts of the world as the online correspondents.-=-<br/>
<br/>
HOW hypocritical.  Why is he communicating with people on the  <br/>
internet instead of going into his own community and talking about  <br/>
these things to people who  just happen to live in his town, whether  <br/>
they can speak English well or not, whether they WANT to talk to him  <br/>
(or hear him) or not?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823232761">I read the Orion article, and few lines jumped out at me more than <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
***The medium is so compelling that it lures children away from the <br/>
kind of activeties through which they have always most effectively <br/>
discovered themselves and their place in the world.***<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I&#39;m thankful that my school playground at recess <br/>
*wasn&#39;t* where I discovered myself and my &quot;place in the world.&quot;  <br/>
Frankly I&#39;d have been better off (and would have preferred) staying <br/>
inside to do something more interesting.   I&#39;m amazed that the author <br/>
can think so poetically about school recess.  And nature???   Aren&#39;t <br/>
most school playgrounds either pavement, wood chips, or sparse grass <br/>
without a trace of other life forms?<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I find it telling that when there&#39;s finally something in <br/>
school that kids can actually be INTERESTED in and dig in with gusto <br/>
that&#39;s perceived as a sign that there must be something wrong.  Wow.<br/>
<br/>
***Yet these projects- the steady diet of virtual trips to the <br/>
Antarctic, virtual clumbs to the summit of Mount Everest, and trips <br/>
into cyber-orbit that represent one technological high after another- <br/>
generate only vicarious thrills.***<br/>
<br/>
And how exactly is a child to know that the Antarctic and Mount <br/>
Everest even exist without first experiencing them vicariously? <br/>
Is a book or a National Geographic spread a more worthy vicarious <br/>
experience?  Why?   And if a person either can&#39;t or doesn&#39;t *want* to <br/>
experience those things directly, then what&#39;s WRONG with experiencing <br/>
them vicariously???<br/>
<br/>
***It is not necessary or sensible to teach children to reject <br/>
computers (although I found that students need just one year of high <br/>
school to learn enough computer skills to enter the workplace or <br/>
college).***<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it occured to the author that one year might be all that&#39;s <br/>
needed to learn *any* skills necessary for entering the workplace or <br/>
college?<br/>
<br/>
***As the computer has amplified our youth&#39;s ability to virtually &quot;go <br/>
anywhere, at anytime,&quot; it has eroded their sense of belonging <br/>
anywhere.***<br/>
<br/>
Depends on how you look at it.  I tend to think that kids today feel <br/>
they belong everywhere. :-)<br/>

<br/>
There was a quote common when I was first on the homeschooling  <br/>
newsgroup in the ancient days.  I always thought I&#39;d find the written  <br/>
source, but it was (and this is past third-hand, so if anyone nows  <br/>
the original that would be great) that John Holt had said that  <br/>
everything taught in the American public schools could be learned in  <br/>
18 months, if someone waited until the age of 15 to start.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the way something like that could be shown would be the way  <br/>
in which students from VERY different cultures can get up to speed  <br/>
when they come to the U.S. for college, if they only learn English in  <br/>
the last year or two before they arrive here.  It&#39;s a different kind  <br/>
of comparison, but still a clue.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Depends on how you look at it.  I tend to think that kids today feel<br/>
they belong everywhere. :-)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers do, at least.<br/>
<br/>
After I wrote my original rants, I realized that it wasn&#39;t just  <br/>
simple hypocrisy.  It&#39;s profound disrespect for children, or at least  <br/>
an extreme double standard.  They wouldn&#39;t extend this to everyone:   <br/>
&quot;Why children shouldn&#39;t have the world at their fingertips.&quot;<br/>

I really like Orion magazine, mostly, the writing is nearly always<br/>
great quality, and the photography as well. And I do agree with the<br/>
basic agenda of living respectfully, however, some of the authors can<br/>
get a bit shrill about their particular issues.  As I read, I often<br/>

I don&#39;t think any mission to Mars would have succeeded without people so passionate about computers that they (sometimes) gave up food and sex and recess to work with the computer uninterruptedly.<br/>

Maybe that article isn&#39;t representative of their philosophy.<br/>
If it is, though, they seem to be more concerned with living  <br/>
respectfully with other species than with their own children.<br/>
They don&#39;t seem respectful of the idea that some people DO find  <br/>
technology-related benefits.<br/>
<br/>
And *HONESTLY*, their beautiful photography and well-constructed  <br/>
articles and website are wholly dependent on electronics and  <br/>
engineering and silicon, electricity and plastic.<br/>

  I don&#39;t think any mission to Mars would have succeeded without people so passionate about computers that they (sometimes) gave up food and sex and recess to work with the computer uninterruptedly.<br/>
