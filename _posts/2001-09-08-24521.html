I am sorry you feel picked on or put down, but honestly, if you don&#39;t want <br/>
to be here then dont be here. I know you said you un-subbed, which maybe if <br/>
you stay a little longer you could get something more than you have, maybe <br/>
not just a thought. Also, just delete all from this list if all its doing is <br/>
making you so angry. Which ever you choose I do wish you the best of luck in <br/>
all your ventures!<br/>

&gt;You must be kidding, Indiana Tami.  That is all that has been going on here <br/>
&gt;for the last week!  Go back and read again.  Everything from &quot;you are lying <br/>
&gt;to your kids by doing that&quot; to &quot;you aren&#39;t really unschooling if you do <br/>
&gt;that&quot; to &quot;if you require them to do anything, you aren&#39;t trusting them, and <br/>
&gt;trust is the most important thing&quot; to &quot;why is reading more important than <br/>
&gt;TV?&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m sure Bridget can provide more examples - she&#39;s been put down as much as <br/>
&gt;I have.<br/>
