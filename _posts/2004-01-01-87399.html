<div id="ygrps-yiv-953651063">When  I started grade  one in an 8 grade-one room classroom we had , of course to hold up our hand to go to the outside bathroom. One day, early in the school year,  I had to go and the teacher said &quot;no, you can&#39;t. I sat and held my hand in the air for what seemed ages  then put it down and sat miserably  and then inevitably started to pee and I can still see it running in a stream across the old dusty wooden floor. Nothing too unusual about that however but  I can honestly say that it seems that was the beginning of a huge all consuming resentment and rage towards teachers, schools,  unfathonable  adult rules and behaviour. I dont think I ever felt too  intimidated by them  but there was always this deep core of rage that  stayed with me.<br/>
When stephanie would run to the house   from the van, when she was 3 to 7  and wet her clothes before she got to the bathroom she would scram and roar with anger all the way. Sometimes  it was not possible not too laugh, not where she could hear of course. Her  annoyance and anger  was so justified. I  wonder how the kids who wet their pants in school when they really would like to just make a dash for the bathroom manage their anger and frustration.<br/>
but then I think I know.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833848040">My sister is still angry at her 2nd grade teacher who denied her the <br/>

little girl go use the toilet.  Nice.<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, have frequently walked out of class without <br/>
permission to use the bathroom.  I knew my mother would completely back <br/>
me up and rage at the teacher if they punished me for going to the <br/>
bathroom so I could do it without fear of punishment for disobeying the <br/>
teacher.  Kudos to my mom for that.<br/>

<br/>
I bet if we just collected a book-length set of the tales of kids who have <br/>
been made to urinate or defecate out of fear of the teacher we&#39;d fill a book <br/>
without ever getting to the &quot;I asked to go and she said no&quot; and never NEVER get <br/>
to &quot;I finally got to go to recess and didn&#39;t want to miss a minute of playing <br/>
to go pee so I went on the swing/slide accidentally.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone ever send their children to school again?   Would teachers who <br/>
showed up in the tellings more than once need to have court-ordered parenting <br/>
classes or fine/jail time for child abuse?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s horrible when these stories get rolling.<br/>
<br/>
Yet from the teachers&#39; point of view, I think all teachers know of kids who <br/>
said they needed to go but really wanted to go visiting, or to smoke, or to <br/>
vandalize some enemy&#39;s locker, or worse than any of that.   <br/>
<br/>
So the answer is:   Keep your kids home if you can!<br/>
<br/>
Tadaa!    My kids can spend all the time in the bathroom they want now.  <br/>

<br/>
When I was in first grade I had permission to go to the bathroom, but there <br/>
was this really interesting poem on the wall in the hall, printed out in large <br/>
first-grade letters, and it was really long and I had just learned to read and <br/>
I wanted to read it.  So I stood there and read it while I held myself and <br/>
just as I got to the end of the poem, I couldn&#39;t hold it anymore and peed on the <br/>
floor just outside the classroom.  <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t embarrassed because the teacher is the only one who knew, and my mom <br/>
and the teacher and the office lady who called my mom all chuckled when I <br/>
told them I couldn&#39;t stand to just pass the poem by and couldn&#39;t read just part <br/>
of it.  I knew I might not get to read it all if I left and came back because I <br/>
might get caught, so I went for it.  <br/>
<br/>
This is actually a good memory for me, because I can still recall the feeling <br/>
of reading something and not wanting to stop at any cost and how satisfying <br/>
it was when I did get to finish it.  It was the first time that ever happened.  <br/>
I don&#39;t recall any shame or rage growing at that point, but it did later, <br/>
over other things.<br/>

That&#39;s a cool reading story!<br/>
<br/>
The last few times any of my kids wet themselves in the daytime, it was <br/>
always because they were involved in a game and didn&#39;t want to stop playing.  <br/>
Luckily it was usually out in the yard, but those are pretty understandable kinds <br/>
of accidents, that they&#39;re so happy about what they&#39;re doing that they&#39;ll risk <br/>
missing a trip to the toilet to keep doing it.<br/>

My sons always had permission and encouragement to water a tree if they <br/>
needed to.  As they got older they would learn when it was appropriate and how to <br/>
be discrete.  Will had been caught a time or two in the front yard with cars <br/>
going by when he was littler, like 3 (and that&#39;s just darn cute).  But now he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want anyone to see.  That guy who someone posted about who pees outside <br/>
all the time, that&#39;s just unsanitary, and I would hate living by him, but I <br/>
understand it.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my friends with little girls encourage them to &quot;girl scout&quot; it and <br/>
that&#39;s certainly helpful for camping and other outdoor things.  Others of my <br/>
friends make a big deal about their girls having to use the bathroom AGAIN when <br/>
camping or whatever and that&#39;s just no fun to be around.  I was raised where <br/>
you didn&#39;t go outside if you were a girl, and no one was supposed to know if the <br/>
boys peed outside.  I&#39;m as likely now to go behind a building rather than use <br/>
a nasty restroom, if necessary and doable.  It&#39;s tricky but it can be done.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; We used the term &quot;pop a squat&quot; for peeing outside (girls, that is)   I&#39;ve<br/>
popped a squat many times when I had to, always discreetly, and only when it<br/>
was a necessity.  I have 2 sisters, no brothers.  We camped, played in the<br/>
woods, and also had a place on the lake with no indoor plumbing.  My girls<br/>
have occasionally popped a squat in urgent situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, btw, nice to meet you folks.  My name is Goia, I have 5 children, ages<br/>
6-18.  They were all unschooled.  Only the two oldest went to public school<br/>
at all.  One through the 2nd grade and one through Kindergarten.  I feel<br/>
like in most situations and topics, I can say &quot;been ther done that&quot;.. hence,<br/>
my yahoo ID.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve enjoyed reading posts.   I have started to post responses several<br/>
times to different topics, but once I read through the thread, someone else<br/>
has said what I was going to say.  I&#39;ll keep reading though, maybe something<br/>
besides popping a squat will come to me.<br/>
