<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148016350">LOL! I don&#39;t mean they work at &quot;manual&quot; labor...they learn the<br/>
difference between wholesale and retail, how what you earn in an hour is<br/>
decreased by fed/local taxes, etc. The oldest one does &quot;work&quot; part-time,<br/>
the 12 yo helps out for a couple hours a week, and the 10yo likes to be<br/>
on my heels wherever I am!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am now reading the book, Affluenza, which looks at over-consumption.  I<br/>
&gt; found an interesting quote: <br/>
&gt; &quot;He believes that while people are born with intrinsic curiosity,<br/>
&gt; self-motivation, and playfulness, too often these qualities are squelched<br/>
&gt; by &#39;deadlines, regulations, threats, directives, pressured evaluations<br/>
&gt; and imposed goals&#39; that come from external sources of control rather than<br/>
&gt; self-motivated choices and goals.&quot; (page 110)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, he goes on to suggest that cold and controlling mothers<br/>
&gt; are the source of the problem.  I thought he was describing school!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mary Ellen<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; described me as an overprotective controlling mother. You were right<br/>
&gt; on this one.<br/>

it&#39;s not just one of us relaying information back to the other. And actually <br/>
we are here to learn about unschooling and not to talk about what hubby and I <br/>
do in regard to our e-mail. Thank-you!<br/>
