<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry.  I think I&#39;ve lost my friend as well.  I feel the same way you <br/>
do.  We&#39;ve been best friends for over 13 years.  I say *think* because she <br/>
just stopped taking my calls and won&#39;t speak to me.<br/>
<br/>
**But I wouldn&#39;t trade my sons happiness and<br/>
freedom to get her love back.**<br/>
<br/>
I know.  It&#39;s hard.  Life has been so completely crazy the past couple of <br/>
weeks and it&#39;s hard not to reach for the phone and dial her number when I&#39;m <br/>
pulling my hair out crying.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just unschooling tha does <br/>
this to friendships.  In my case, it ran the whole gamut of parenting <br/>
differences.  I&#39;m looking hard for the good side to this and the only thing <br/>
I can come up with is that it is forcing me to get off my ass and make some <br/>
new friends.  Now I have the &#39;hindsight&#39; which helps to know to look for <br/>
like-minded people, even though at 15, you really have no idea where you <br/>
will be that far down the road. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716258689">So true Jennifer.  Unschooling is forcing me to meet new people as <br/>
well.  I have some wonderful friends who are *supportive* now, but <br/>
who knows as our kids get older.  I am on the lookout for others like <br/>
us...LOL!  I am sorry to hear about your loss.  I have a friend from <br/>
high school and our relationship always seems strained.  I have never <br/>
been able to figure out what it is.  Sometimes, I would rather just <br/>
call her and say forget it, instead of a relationship that goes no <br/>
where.  <br/>
<br/>
Olga :)<br/>

I suspect that at 49 I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;ll be looking for in friends in 20 <br/>
years. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Something about retirement and ethics and how to treat grandchildren might <br/>
end up coming between my now-new-friends and me.<br/>
