&lt;&lt; . (In FL they have to be on grade level) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not trying to be  contrary, but that isn&#39;t true.<br/>
I only want to point this out to keep people from being scared of FL law. <br/>
Some of the evaluators try to convince you that they must be at grade level, <br/>
but in reality the law states that you must document improvement every year.<br/>
That&#39;s all.<br/>
And here in FL you don&#39;t even have to see an evaluator at all if you don&#39;t <br/>
want to. <br/>
<br/>
I did enjoy hearing about your dd&#39;s amazing the evaluator Rebecca!!!<br/>
That&#39;s great.<br/>
