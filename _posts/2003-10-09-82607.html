He said: &quot;We&#39;re nearly finished - we&#39;re in the home straight. <br/>
There&#39;s  only one reason for U2 to put an album out right now - it <br/>
has to be a  monster, a dragon, and this is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bono claimed The Edge &#39;s frustrations with his singer&#39;s <br/>
non-musical activities had prompted the aggressive nature of <br/>
much of the album.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s filled with big tunes and it&#39;s driven by a guitar player who is <br/>
sick of the sight of me shaking hands with dodgy politicians. The <br/>
anger is unbelievable,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Edge is the most gifted guitar player of his generation - <br/>
that&#39;s obvious. He&#39;s driving it and he&#39;s going, &#39;This is enough, if I <br/>
see one more photo of you with a dodgy politician I&#39;m going to <br/>
throw up.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re going to be touring again next year and I can&#39;t wait. It&#39;s a <br/>
hard thing to explain but, next to being with my friends and family, <br/>
the place I feel most comfortable in my life is on stage in front of <br/>
20,000 of my closest friends, or 150,000.&quot;<br/>
