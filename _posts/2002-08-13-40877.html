&lt;&lt; PS I had no idea that &quot;wussy&quot; was an insult to women.  Sorry &#39;bout that.<br/>
I thought it was another word for lilly-livered, timid. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is another word for it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just based (vulgarly) on being like a woman, and most of the people on <br/>
this list (&quot;most&quot; in the over 99% sense, I think) ARE like women, genetically <br/>
speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Use among men in private is nothing new.  Using it in a forum as full of <br/>
women as this one is seemed worthy of mention.  <br/>
