<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some of us here like to have debates and listen to all sides of an issue... what a great way to learn and grow. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like to listen and form my own opinions based on the topic being discussed. Sometimes I respond, most times not, but I&#39;m always keeping an open mind.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Lovemary has a good point... ignoring these kinds of posts is the best response, although I know it&#39;s sometimes hard to do. But, if we don&#39;t get a grip here, there won&#39;t *be* much of a list what with a few people promoting other ones to jump over to... this one could die out. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would tend to agree with this. I read but ignore all posts which I would classify as negative. There are still plenty of other coversations going on that are beneficial without the bickering. I&#39;ve been learning a lot. I&#39;m also on the other list. I get the best of both worlds.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I, for one, won&#39;t let a few bickering bickersons run me off but I *will* ignore posts from particular posters whose style is defensive. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, me too. I hope you stay, DB, and don&#39;t get scared off by a little nastiness. IMO, it doesn&#39;t mean anything. This is still a great unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m hoping others will do the same!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m still here, and staying for a while!<br/>
