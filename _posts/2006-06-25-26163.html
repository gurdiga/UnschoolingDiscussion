<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952626630">Seamus is 9 (almost 10)years old. Yesterday, he said he wanted to go <br/>
for a long bike ride, and asked me to pack him a lunch and something <br/>
to drink, which i did. I also gave him some money in case he wanted <br/>
to buy something to eat instead. And my cell phone in case he needed <br/>
to talk. So off he went. <br/>
<br/>
Later, he came in with a box of left-over Chinese food. He said he <br/>
decided to go to Shong-Hey instead(its our local family owned <br/>
chinese place, been there since i was a kid, the only egg rolls i&#39;ve <br/>
ever had anywhere made with bean sprouts instead of cabbage. Its <br/>
about a mile down the road.)He told me they offered him a kid&#39;s <br/>
menu, but he just wanted chicken and brocolli, he sat at a booth and <br/>
had lunch by himself. He also said he got a really good fortune <br/>
(when we go together, he doesnt like to read his fortune) &quot;A good <br/>
thing will happen soon for your family&quot;. He said he took the bike <br/>
path through the park on the way there, and noticed seven ducks in <br/>
the river (which is really just a drainage ditch)...and &quot;seven is a <br/>
lucky number!And there are NEVER ducks there!&quot; So he was feeling <br/>
very positive about the whole trip. <br/>
<br/>
Later he was retelling this whole story to my sister, and she <br/>
asked &quot;Did ya leave a tip?&quot; My heart kind of sank, because i thought <br/>
he surely forgot. But this is what he said instead: &quot;Yeah, i only <br/>
left a dollar. But my meal was just over $5, so i figured a dollar <br/>
is 20 percent right? So i thought that would be enough.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Well. I mustve told him at some point about tips, about leaving 10-<br/>
20 percent. Or maybe he just noticed that, since we go out to eat <br/>
alot, and i talk alot about everything we do. <br/>
<br/>
So i felt very proud. Yes, proud that my son knew, in a real-world <br/>
situation, what 20 percent of his bill would be. But more than that, <br/>
i was proud that he was confident enough to eat in a restaurant by <br/>
himself (i *never* wouldve done that at his age! Probably not even <br/>
now.), that he was observant enough to see the beauty in seven good <br/>
luck ducks swimming in the park, and that he was thoughtful enough <br/>
to even leave a tip. And to top it all off my very forgetful &quot;in the <br/>
moment&quot; boy didnt even forget his backpack at the restaurant. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so looking forward to his teenage years! I think its just gonna <br/>
get better and better. <br/>
