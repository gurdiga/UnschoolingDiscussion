&gt; Will one (or more) of the nice people who so often say that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; off topic please tell us their views of unschooling, without complaining<br/>
&gt; about my posts or my views, or anyone else&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are many, many posts here from one or more (actually, it&#39;s more) of<br/>
the nice people who so often say you&#39;re off topic -- regarding facets of<br/>
unschooling as pertain to shakespeare, dyslexia, living in one place vs. the<br/>
nomadic lifestyle, and more.<br/>
<br/>
People are telling their views, it&#39;s all here for the reading.<br/>
