<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023904713">The problem with dyslexia / reading and ps is, IMO, just what you say - the<br/>
attitudes that are presented and then absorbed by the kids. 2 of my 4 have<br/>
reading / writing problems that would probably have been diagnosd as dyslexia<br/>
if I had ever let them near an &#39;expert&#39;. One learnt to read - when he was<br/>
ready - at 9 1/2, the other at 12. Neither will probably be much good at<br/>
spelling. Greg has almost &#39;no qualifications&#39; but was able to exude<br/>
confidence and ability enough to get a job with a beekeeper at the age of 17<br/>
and has held down that job for 15 months. He is now taking a break to come<br/>
home and help us build our house. If he&#39;d been at school, all attention would<br/>
have been focused on his &#39;failures&#39; with reading and writing. Instead we have<br/>
been able to encourage him in his strengths. My 12yo has extraordinary powers<br/>
of observation and intuition. Not sure where they will take him, but I am<br/>
sure that these qualities would have been &#39;beaten&#39; out of him - watching<br/>
birds out of windows is not acceptable in the face of not being able to<br/>
spell!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Erick, the<br/>
&gt; 8 yo could not read, at all, barely recognized 1/2 of the alphabet and<br/>
&gt; they passed him to 2nd grade, when I objected they told me that he would<br/>
&gt; never be normal and they had to keep his self esteem up, he has no self<br/>
&gt; esteem problems<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Soon would have - the more schools try to pretend, the worse it gets. To keep<br/>
self esteem up, the kid needs honesty, not pretense. Yes, not being able to<br/>
read and write well creates difficulties. How can we do something about it?<br/>
What strengths can we encourage to compensate? It is so important that the<br/>
kid sees himself as a worthwhile whole person who has strengths *and*<br/>
weaknesses, and that he is valuable for who he is, and for who he may become,<br/>
and that he isn&#39;t made helpless by suggestions - however they are put - that<br/>
there is an inevitability about the outcome of his life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway that was what made my final<br/>
&gt; decision, I had been looking into it for 2 years, but to be honest did<br/>
&gt; not know if I was patient enough to give them the education they deserve,<br/>
&gt; now I wonder why it took me so long.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like school teachers are always so patient LOL<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I<br/>
&gt; am so sorry I did not have the courage to do this for my other kids, they<br/>
&gt; missed so much and so did I by trusting that the school knew best. I have<br/>
&gt; I have 11 grandchildren and will homeschool or help with most of them, it<br/>
&gt; has become a family commitment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I really admire someone who takes the decision to homeschool after so many<br/>
years of entrenchment in the system - Congratulations, that took a lot of<br/>
courage.<br/>

<br/>
The boys have a long way to go and they have many obstacles to overcome<br/>
and they will probably never be brain surgeons, but if they are happy and<br/>
contributing humans I will have done what I set out to do. Keith is 11<br/>
and reads about on a 2nd or 3rd grade level, I try to avoid tests and<br/>
other things that just set them up to fail, instead of worrying about<br/>
what they cannot do we find things they can do and we build on it, then<br/>
soon they can do something they could not do. I think in the natural<br/>
order of things we all develop differently and that includes reading and<br/>
writing, some of the most intelligent people I know can barely read and<br/>
you cannot read their handwriting, but they have so much to offer the<br/>
world. I hate labels and have left off some of the more insulting things<br/>
that have been said by teachers, but it was not good for the boys.<br/>
Intelligence is not a factor, they have high IQ&#39;s, but if they did not it<br/>
would not change their value as human beings and of course because they<br/>
are my kids I think they are pretty wonderful even when they are driving<br/>
me wild. My sister in law told me the only thing I needed to be able to<br/>
teach my kids was love and the rest would work out, she is mostly right,<br/>
but it is hard to not have anyone to talk to about it. My husband works<br/>
terrible hours and travels with his job, we do go visit him alot, but it<br/>
is not a good support system as he is almost always working, we get a<br/>
small amount of his time and I hate to take his attention away from doing<br/>
things with the boys to talk about what they have been doing, does that<br/>
make sense at all? I do not want my kids to be normal, they are wonderful<br/>
and unique and exceptional human beings, why would I want to settle for<br/>
normal. I am so glad I finally made this decision and so are they. We&#39;ve<br/>
only just gotten home from a trip to see both grandma&#39;s and the boys were<br/>
so excited to tell their aunts and uncles about homeschooling and try to<br/>
talk them into doing it with their kids, so far only myself and the<br/>
sister in law that encouraged me do, but I live in hope that it is<br/>
spreading, all my children have made the commitment to homeschool their<br/>
children, so at least in this branch of the tree it is flourishing.<br/>
