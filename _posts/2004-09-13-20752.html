<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369841390">My mother doesn&#39;t &#39;get&#39; unschooling.  That&#39;s fine.  Of course, she&#39;s always<br/>
harping  about it and is convinced that the kids aren&#39;t learning anything.<br/>
<br/>
I recently sent her a funny picture of a sign in front of a church (some<br/>
Methodist church) that said:  Don&#39;t let your worries kill you.  Let the<br/>
church help.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was funny, and seeing that my mother always goes to church, I<br/>
sent it along to her.<br/>
<br/>
This is her reply:<br/>
<br/>
My church certainly doesn&#39;t fit that bill.  We have such a wonderful &quot;home&quot;<br/>
for all ages.  Yesterday the Sunday School started.  They have such a<br/>
wonderful<br/>
program with people putting in so much time and thought to constantly make<br/>
the program more meaningful teach the kids about the important things of<br/>
life<br/>
that they will need to have to draw on as they go through their lives.  I<br/>
love<br/>
it here.<br/>
<br/>
So, now they&#39;re heathens because they don&#39;t go to &#39;Sunday School&#39; either.  I<br/>
wish I could think of a witty reply, but I think I&#39;ll remain mute or I&#39;ll<br/>
say something I&#39;ll regret.<br/>

 Christian Ed. Directors Lament Increase in Home Sunday Schooling:<br/>
Sunday school enrollment in decline<br/>
<br/>
With the academic year having ended in many parts of the country,<br/>
Christian educators are disturbed by a dramatic decrease in Sunday<br/>
school enrollment for the upcoming year, a trend they say is largely<br/>
due to the growing popularity of home Sunday schooling. Home Sunday<br/>
schooling, a system in which a child obtains Christian education at<br/>
home rather than in traditional church-sponsored Sunday schools, dwelt<br/>
in relative obscurity-primarily in New England and the Pacific<br/>
Northwest-for nearly a decade before the recent upswing.<br/>
<br/>
Supporters say home Sunday schooling provides a vastly superior learning<br/>
model for children, especially those who do not flourish in traditional<br/>
classroom settings. Critics contend that home Sunday schooled children<br/>
miss<br/>
out on vital opportunities for socialization or fall short educationally.<br/>
<br/>
Katherine Eusibio, president of the Nashville-based nonprofit Homestead<br/>
Christian Education, has been advocating for home Sunday schoolers for<br/>
eight<br/>
years. &quot;Many, if not most, students have difficulty learning about the<br/>
Christian faith in traditional classroom settings,&quot; she argues. &quot;Bringing<br/>
the experience into the home allows children to learn at their own pace<br/>
while spending more quality time with their families.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Eusibio insists that the results lauded by Christian Educators as<br/>
signs<br/>
of Sunday school success-such as high rates of scripture memorization and<br/>
the ability to identify flannel cutouts of major Bible characters-are<br/>
indications of conformity, not evidence of actual learning. &quot;Traditional<br/>
Sunday school may seem to be a great success, but most of these kids<br/>
are not<br/>
really learning; they&#39;re just doing well at standardized Bible quizzing!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not so, says Harriett Petsche, Director of Christian Education for the<br/>
United Methodist Church, who considers home Sunday schooling a dangerous<br/>
trend that she says &quot;threatens the future of Sunday School as we know it.&quot;<br/>
According to Ms. Petsche, success at competitive exercises such as<br/>
memorization and Bible quizzing correlates to a deeper understanding of<br/>
scripture. &quot;Children in a structured curriculum can often recite very long<br/>
portions of scripture without even thinking about it. That&#39;s what I&#39;d call<br/>
&#39;allowing the word of Christ to dwell in you richly.&#39; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
The attraction of home-based Christian education won over Neva and Allan<br/>
Magrath in 2003, when they began home Sunday schooling their two daughters<br/>
Erika and Ellen, ages 7 and 10 respectively. &quot;Erika was having some<br/>
trouble<br/>
with a Sunday schoolyard bully, and Ellen had severe allergic reactions to<br/>
the combination of Oreos and orange juice from concentrate,&quot; recalled Mr.<br/>
Magrath. &quot;It got to the point where the girls just dreaded getting dressed<br/>
on Sunday mornings. So we agreed to try this for a year, and we all<br/>
love it.<br/>
Now we sleep in an hour later on Sundays, and we all study Bible stories<br/>
together in our pajamas. Or sometimes we just have pancakes and skip the<br/>
stories.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It hasn&#39;t been all fun for the Magrath family, however. They say they&#39;ve<br/>
received harassing phone calls from the Sunday school president at their<br/>
church, whose name they declined to disclose. Even their friends from the<br/>
adult Bible study they attend have expressed concern over the decision to<br/>
pull Erika and Ellen out of Sunday School.<br/>
<br/>
But despite the criticism they&#39;ve received, the Magraths say they are<br/>
quite<br/>
content with their current arrangement. In fact, they&#39;re contemplating<br/>
broadening their domestication of the church experience. &quot;Now that we&#39;re<br/>
home Sunday schooling, we&#39;re considering just home churching while<br/>
we&#39;re at<br/>
it,&quot; says Ms. Magrath. &quot;We ordered some sermon tapes from Willow Creek and<br/>
some got some worship CDs at the local Provident store. &quot;We&#39;re just trying<br/>
to decide which media ministry to send our tithe check to, and then<br/>
we&#39;ll be<br/>
all set.&quot;</div>

<br/>
&quot;Hey, you just described our wonderful home! It&#39;s a great place for all ages<br/>
too. Lots of energy being poured into making things better and better. And<br/>
the kids are constantly and joyfully learning things they&#39;ll use now and in<br/>
the future. And we love our home too :-)&quot;<br/>

 <br/>
Cracking up over here! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The best part is that they learn to do it &quot;without even thinking about it.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
So being able to recite long passages of Dr. Seuss is allowing the word of  <br/>
Geisel to dwell in me richly?  Good.<br/>
