<div id="ygrps-yiv-618564163">We recently moved and so  had no schedule or anything regarding the house. It <br/>
is still not even unpacked and we have several painting jobs ongoing. The <br/>
mess was starting to bother me and everyone else. We had done this chart <br/>
before and decided (all of us) to do it again. We wrote all the jobs down <br/>
that anyone could think of and separated them into weekly, monthly, <br/>
quarterly. Then we each got to pick out the ones we wanted or in some cases <br/>
settled for. Then we made a chart showing who does what, and decided to <br/>
rotate jobs every month, making no one stuck with something they don&#39;t want <br/>
to do. If someone doesn&#39;t want to do the daily stuff, no big deal . . . even <br/>
the weekly. . . its a guideline, but everyone is happy about it, and feels <br/>
better about the house. No one did their daily stuff today cause we were all <br/>
busy, and that&#39;s fine. And we feel free to ask somone else for help or even <br/>
to do our job if we cant get to it and it needs doing. . . its real flexible <br/>
but its a great guidline for us all and it helps us to get focused when we <br/>
feel like it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds nearly identical to ours.  We have daily, weekly and one time jobs<br/>
listed.   The biggest effect it has had was that the kids realized how<br/>
valuable it was to keep up with the stuff recently.  We are hosting a<br/>
foreign exchange student.  We found out about it exactly approximately 40<br/>
hours before his plane was to arrive.  (Someone cancelled at the last<br/>
minute!)  Anyway, in that 40 hours we had to turn the library/catch-all<br/>
room into a bedroom.  We manage to do it because the house was not a<br/>
cluttered nightmare of a mess like it used to be B.L. (before list).<br/>
