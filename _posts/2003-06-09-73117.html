<div id="ygrps-yiv-57550686">A quick note before I go to bed and get too busy next week to think of it..<br/>
..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never required or told my kids they have to try a taste of something<br/>
new. I let them look, sniff... and I offer.... sometimes suggest (I think<br/>
you might like this because it tastes a little like so-and-so or because it<br/>
has so-and-so in it).... and they have learned on their own that their<br/>
tastes change as time goes on. B informed me last month that he no longer<br/>
likes broccoli.... and just today while out with my parents decided he<br/>
wanted to try a crawfish which he&#39;d always previously turned green at the<br/>
sight of. He didn&#39;t like it.... actually spit his only small bite out into<br/>
his napkin.... but he tried it completely on his own. Last week while<br/>
grocery shopping, T asked if we could buy &quot;that funny kinda oval shaped<br/>
fuzzy brown fruit&quot;. Coconut? Nope. I was lost.... but we went to the produce<br/>
section, and he pointed out a kiwi. I&#39;ve never bought them before.... never<br/>
tasted one myself, actually. So I grabbed us each one. At home, he waited<br/>
for me to taste mine first (guess to make sure I wasn&#39;t going to fall over<br/>
dead or something lol) and I didn&#39;t like it at all. He simply said &quot;Hmmm, ok<br/>
 my turn&quot; and found out he loved it. <br/>
<br/>
So much more fun, relaxing, and empowering for them to find out that way<br/>
than to have an adult say &quot;taste it cause you might like it&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876501781">Neither do we. Our kids eat fruits and vegies and try what they want. They <br/>
have never been forced to try anything. They may or may not try something but it <br/>
is totally up to them. There are things I will not eat that they like. They <br/>
love hot stuff and will snack on veggies and fruits by choice.<br/>
