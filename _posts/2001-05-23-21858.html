<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647505793"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The child is a t.v. addict and I have completely laid off when it comes to<br/>
&gt;these things feeling that soon or later she will get bored and find something<br/>
&gt;to do. NOT. I swear sometimes I can see the brain cells floating off towards<br/>
&gt;the set. (that was supposed to be a joke)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>----------<br/>
Maybe the brain cells are floating off toward the set. If so, it&#39;s what she<br/>
needs right now.<br/>
<br/>
Choices. If she has choices, she can pick and choose what is best for her.<br/>
If she really has the OPTIONS of watching television, reading or being read<br/>
to, swimming or taking a walk, doing a craft or meeting a homeschooled<br/>
friend later, making a cake or building Legos, she&#39;ll make the RIGHT CHOICES<br/>
for her and for that moment.<br/>
<br/>
If she has nothing on offer but TV, then that&#39;s what to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
And if she has only been watching TV 23 hours a day since February, my dear,<br/>
you haven&#39;t even really STARTED a TV Marathon yet! :) And, she can sense<br/>
your disapproval even if you don&#39;t voice it. Please, strive to truly accept<br/>
her choices, not just clam up and bolt from the room. Anything less and<br/>
you&#39;re pushing her away.<br/>
----------<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Every one I know is giving me a hard time about , Im not tough enough on her<br/>
&gt;she has no structure.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>----------<br/>
<br/>
You need to politely tell everyone else to hush up.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else: WHAT?! She doesn&#39;t have a BEDTIME?!<br/>
You: Nope. How about this weather we&#39;re having?<br/>
Everyone else: WHAT?! She watches 14 hours of TV before BREAKFAST?!<br/>
You: Yep. So you think the Yankees will go all the way this year?<br/>
Everyone else: WHAT?! The BANK was your MAJOR LEARNING EXPERIENCE of the<br/>
WEEK?!!!!!<br/>
You: Yep. Gosh, look at the time. Gotta go!<br/>
<br/>
Etc.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Im afraid that if I dont bring things up she will  miss it. Im afraid if I<br/>
&gt;let my guard down and just live then she wont learn anything.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The bold is mine. Fear is a terrible thing. I would definitely get your<br/>
daughter a subscription to TV Guide and Gameboy Digest and work on your<br/>
fears. They will cripple you, and perhaps your daughter as well. You have<br/>
some homework to do. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;It must work<br/>
&gt;so many of you do it and your kids are learning. Some of them are<br/>
&gt;overlearning or over achievers . I keeep waiting for that. It has not come<br/>
&gt;yet.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>----------<br/>
<br/>
What does overlearning or overachieving look like? Doing math workbooks?<br/>
Building a rocket? Reading War and Peace? Seriously, think about what you<br/>
are &quot;waiting for&quot;. Name it. Write it down. Consider whether its importance<br/>
is relevant to your daughter, or is it phantoms cast by relatives, or<br/>
friends with straight A students (poor things, I was one of them, they are<br/>
in for a serious shock when thrust into real life), or your own schooled<br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Choices. If your daughter has choices with what to do with her time, she<br/>
will choose the best and wisest course for HER. None of us know what that<br/>
course is. She will know it when she sees it, so your job is to put<br/>
everything you can think of in her line of sight, and then step aside.<br/>
Basically, think of yourself as an 18th century intellectual and spiritual<br/>
and nutritional valet.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.<br/>
