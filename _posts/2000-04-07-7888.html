&gt; &lt;&lt; Hi  lisa,<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;m not sure whah I mean. It&#39;s just that dh has his reservations, as do I<br/>
,<br/>
&gt;  about sending our kids into the world knowing nothing but the PBS sched.<br/>
&gt;  O.K. Perhaps I&#39;m overreacting here, but I still have my concerns. Any<br/>
advice<br/>
&gt;  would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;  Amy &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s funny -- PBS schedule.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, what I did (so take it for what it&#39;s worth!) as a sanity check at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; beginning of hsing was to go to the state&#39;s standards.  They are online<br/>
here<br/>
&gt; in Florida.  Look under the Dept. of Ed listings.   These are a<br/>
line-by-line<br/>
&gt; explanation of what the schools are supposed to be teaching the kids in<br/>
each<br/>
&gt; grade.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I found these to be reassuring that, even tho we have tended more and more<br/>
&gt; toward relaxed hsing and unschooling, we are still hitting all the bases.<br/>
&gt; The standards were not at all stringent in my estimation -- more of a<br/>
&gt; minimum.  But they were a sanity check for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And there is a series out called What your X Grader Should Know.  Some<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; say they have been very happy using this as a guide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think you can use all of these tools, and more, and still happily hs,<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; or without a formal curriculum or part of one.  But I think it takes time<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; figure out what is best for you and yours.  And then that changes at just<br/>
&gt; about the time you get it all figured out!  :):)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck.<br/>
