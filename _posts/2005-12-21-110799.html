<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811399720">-=-Does anyone have any advice on sibling fighting? It&#39;s usually the  <br/>
same<br/>
story my older son picks on the younger one until he gets mad and<br/>
pounces on his brother. It doesn&#39;t seem that anything we try is<br/>
working. Today the older one woke up with a black eye and scratches<br/>
all over his face which was the result of Starwars play gone bad.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your child had a black eye and scratches on his face but he didn&#39;t  <br/>
have a sibling, would you still blame Starwars?<br/>
<br/>
Would you let a neighbor do that to him?  A stranger?<br/>
<br/>
If the older one is picking on the younger one, intervene in some  <br/>
subtle way.  Separate them without them feeling like mom stepped in  <br/>
and separated them.<br/>
<br/>
You might call the older one away (with a nice voice) and ask him to  <br/>
help you do something really brief, like give the dog water, or take  <br/>
a bag of trash out--something that makes him feel bigger, not  <br/>
smaller.  It might be all the time he needs to calm down, and if it  <br/>
involves physical activity it will help him breath a bit and see a  <br/>
different scene.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t konw what you&#39;ve tried so far, but each of your children  <br/>
needs to feel safe in his own home, and &quot;letting them work it out&quot; is  <br/>
cruel, even if nobody&#39;s getting a black eye.  There are deeper scars  <br/>
than bruises that some people carry through life because of things  <br/>
siblings said or did, while the parents didn&#39;t even know.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas I&#39;ve used with my three kids, who are 2.5 and 3  <br/>
years apart:<br/>
