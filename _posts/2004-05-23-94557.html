<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940362468">Maybe pulling off all the wallpaper will give them their lifetime fill of<br/>
picking and they won&#39;t pick at their kids&#39; cradle cap ;-)<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  Maybe!  And I think you are right in the rest of your post as well.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Sandra, I need to learn to practice what I preach and take what I <br/>
can use and dump the rest. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246559196">You&#39;ll need to watch them when they&#39;re at homes with wallpaper and say no.<br/>
And say no to writing on walls at other people&#39;s houses. They&#39;ll eventually<br/>
get it that there are different behaviors for home and away.****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh I am so glad someone wrote this!!!<br/>
<br/>
For YEARS I have been convinced that kids can learn that some behaviors are ok in some places and not others (similar places, like someone&#39;s home vs. their home).<br/>
<br/>
And for YEARS I have said that the kids can learn to adapt their behavior depending on WHO is home.  (Dad has different quirks than mom, and when mom works, Dad is who we have to adapt to.)<br/>
<br/>
All my life all I ever heard was &quot;you can&#39;t do that because if I let you do it at home, you&#39;ll do it everywhere else&quot;.  What a bunch of bunk.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196606464">In our last house, when my son was ages 5 - 7, we had a wall in the play <br/>
room that was his to do with as he pleased.  He painted on it, drew on it, <br/>
nailed and glued things to it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
When we were ready to sell, I pulled everything off, including shelves he <br/>
had constructed and attached, and painted it with several coats of paint.<br/>

have different rules at their house than we do at ours. And MORE rules-lots more <br/>
rules! LOL He needs a little help remembering them occassionally, and as he <br/>
gets older, he needs less reminding, but I don&#39;t remember a time that he didn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;get&quot; it.<br/>

eating in the kitchen.  He has known since he was 2 that when Daddy <br/>
is home he has to eat in the kitchen, if Daddy isn&#39;t home, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter where he eats.  I think they can learn these differences <br/>
really easily.<br/>

<br/>
My kids were very young when they learned there are words not to say at <br/>
grandma&#39;s house.  Like &quot;poop.&quot;   So &quot;poop&quot; was our watermark.  Words worse than <br/>
poop were not to be said anywhere they weren&#39;t sure how people felt about them.   <br/>
And at Christian homes, they needed to be careful about any offhand <br/>
references to God or Jesus.  They learned it early and without trouble.<br/>
<br/>
When we go somewhere, I always try to brief them about what behavior&#39;s <br/>
expected, and they appreciate the information and go with it.  I think that&#39;s <br/>
courteous in ANY instance.  I never mind people playing protocol advisor to me.  I <br/>
still probably will end up wearing jeans and a t-shirt unless it&#39;s a wedding or <br/>
a funeral, but at least I like to know what the prevailing attitude of a <br/>
group is before I go to hang out.  <br/>
