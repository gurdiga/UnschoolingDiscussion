<div id="ygrps-yiv-302010440">I use to work for one of the community colleges in California and did<br/>
enrollment.<br/>
<br/>
There were a rash of folks enrolling very young children in junior/community<br/>
colleges in California about 10 years ago.  They used BOGG&#39;s (Board of<br/>
Govenors Grants) to get the kids enrolled for free and then they would<br/>
&quot;proctor&quot; the classes.  Because of this abuse of the system, the colleges<br/>
changed from no rules to lots of rules.<br/>
<br/>
Which leads to, some of the schools won&#39;t accept anyone under the age of 16.<br/>
You will need to check with your school.<br/>
<br/>
As to defining yourself as a &quot;homeschooler,&quot; that definition does not exist<br/>
in California.  You are either a private school or you are part of the ps<br/>
system or, in some cases, you are working outside the system.<br/>
<br/>
If you are doing an R4, then you list him as a private school student.  The<br/>
general rule with ps is that until 16 they can&#39;t take more than one class.<br/>
After 16 they can take 2.  That is because of the number of hours required<br/>
for the school to collect $$ from the state.<br/>
<br/>
As a private school (R4), you are allowed to determine how many classes any<br/>
of your students are allowed to take.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the schools require that the students take math and English exams<br/>
before they are enrolled.  As a part-time student you shouldn&#39;t need any<br/>
transcripts.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you talk to the registrar, not a counselor and ask for<br/>
the specifics that their board of regents require for their school.<br/>
Unfortunately, most of the counselors aren&#39;t that much help.<br/>

Are you on HSC&#39;s email list?  They have lots of homeschoolers from across<br/>
the state on that list.  There might even be someone who already attends<br/>
the particular college you are interested in.  It&#39;s CA-Homeschooling-HSC <br/>
and it&#39;s at yahoogroups.  I know a lot of the teens go to city or junior<br/>
colleges for classes!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you find answers.  I heard that San Francisco City College was<br/>
getting snarky about homeschoolers but I don&#39;t recall hearing about<br/>
any other school.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
