&lt;&lt; Sandra was obviously deprived, and often. I could have <br/>
*anything* my little heart desired. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I STILL hate window shopping. Always have. Always will. When I have money <br/>
though, I&#39;m a *happy* shopper! &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OBVIOUSLY deprived? <br/>
I&#39;m seeming needy to you?  Really?  Kelly, why would you SAY that? Tell me!<br/>
<br/>
(NOT REALLY. &lt;g&gt; Just acting needy or something.)<br/>
<br/>
When I go shopping with my charge cards in my pocket, sometimes I come home <br/>
having bought not a single thing, but I&#39;m still happy, because I came home <br/>
emptyhanded out of pure and real choice.   If I come home with the vision of <br/>
something I can&#39;t have, it&#39;s not as clean as emptyhanded, I come home needy, and <br/>
lacking.<br/>
<br/>
Life doesn&#39;t only go from 0 into the postive numbers.  There are negative <br/>
numbers, too.<br/>
<br/>
Different people scale their lives differently.   My kids are not needy kids. <br/>
 Here&#39;s a little bit from a longer article which is here:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=-Holly, who just turned nine, gets an allowance of 75 cents per year of <br/>
age, so she was, up to last week, getting $6 a week. Now $6.75.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We took her to Disneyland. She had saved all her birthday gift money <br/>
(which amounted to about $35 from her grandmothers and her brother), and her <br/>
allowance for several weeks, and she had loaned me $20 a few months before and said <br/>
&quot;Keep it for Disneyland.&quot; She had $104, some in cash and some in &quot;the bank of <br/>
dad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-She came back from three days at Disneyland with $84 and a cute safari <br/>
hat. <br/>
<br/>
-=-Nobody discouraged her from spending her money. She just doesn&#39;t NEED <br/>
anything, because she gets lots of things when she wants them, and so she doesn&#39;t <br/>
have that desperation to acquire.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays Holly&#39;s allowance is $9 a month; she&#39;s twelve.  Yesterday she had me <br/>
take her to buy batteries for two toys she has.  One was something she picked <br/>
up at a kind of hobbit gift exchange, and it&#39;s an antique &lt;bwg  15 or 20 year <br/>
old?&gt; electronic recording card (about the size of a pocket calculator) that <br/>
took three watch batteries, but she really wanted to see what it would do.  It <br/>
records one minute of voice.  She has played with it a lot, but it took $12 <br/>
worth of batteries.  The batteries for her pocket spelling dictionary and <br/>
hangman game were another $4.   Two weeks&#39; allowance for batteries, and she didn&#39;t <br/>
complain a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad or good to window shop.  I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t <br/>
personally like it.  I don&#39;t even know if my kids like it or not.  When they go out <br/>
with friends, conversation is usually the main thing they report when they get <br/>
back.  <br/>
<br/>
Because Kelly who wasn&#39;t poor doesn&#39;t like it, and I (poor me) who was poor <br/>
doesn&#39;t either, it&#39;s possible that anyone&#39;s children might not think it&#39;s fun <br/>
either, for whatever personal reasons those might be.<br/>
<br/>
But it does seem to me that it has to do with freedom and choice.   Choosing <br/>
not to buy is in a different emotional category from the inability to buy.<br/>
