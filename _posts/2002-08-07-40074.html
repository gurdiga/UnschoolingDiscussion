<div id="ygrps-yiv-634995780">Tanya - About travelling full time...we are very lucky income-wise because my husband has a small (and I mean SMALL) retirement income from the Army.  However, we don&#39;t plan to be without income.  My parents used to full time RV - they went on the road for about 3 years before going back to part time travelling.  From them, I&#39;ve learned a HUGE amount about earning income on the road.  Campground hosting is a great job for RVers - free spot and small salary.  They recommended to me a magazine called Highways.  It&#39;s targeted at fulltimers.  There&#39;s also a comprehensive campground guide for the nation and a publication that lists all hosting opportunities nationwide.  I was wondering, though, if you&#39;re a little concerned about the variety of homeschooling laws in the states you&#39;ll be passing through?  I guess to avoid problems, we&#39;ll have to research each state&#39;s statutes prior to spending a lot of time there in the school year.  I don&#39;t want to run afoul of tough/unfriendly laws if its not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
For those curious about Halloween/Christmas/Easter:  It&#39;s been awhile since school (counting it in decades...ouch!) so I went online to check my facts prior to posting.  I found a wonderful site that seems very concise and accurate, so I&#39;m going to post my link.  As a disclaimer, this does appear to be a Wiccan site, so if that offends you, please don&#39;t click through.  <br/>

you will have to spend that time somewhere. You will probably keep a PO Box <br/>
in your home-state. That is the state I would concentrate on *knowing* the <br/>
hsing law in. If you aren&#39;t planning on spending more than 3 months (some <br/>
states) to 6 months (most states) in any one state, then I wouldn&#39;t worry <br/>
about learning all the laws! What an exhausting way to spend your time <br/>
anyway! (Unless you have a particular passion with the ins and out&#39;s of hsing <br/>
law?) Besides, I just don&#39;t see the local truant officers spending time at <br/>
campgrounds, national parks and scenic byways. I would hope they think people <br/>
at those places are on vacation. Should you run into an errant truant officer <br/>
in some backwater area, I would just say, &quot;We are on vacation, but I saw a <br/>
couple of kids floating down the river on a raft a few minutes ago. If you <br/>
hurry you might be able to catch them!&quot; Can&#39;t be more difficult than that! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I confess, my interest wasn&#39;t whether or not there is a connection between <br/>
Christian celebrations and Pagan celebrations, that connection is clear. <br/>
Rather, it was with what you said about the Church borrowing Pagan holidays <br/>
in order to win converts. It sounded cynical to me, though I doubt you meant <br/>
it that way. Regardless, I don&#39;t think it is accurate. Maybe it&#39;s simply how <br/>
we look at it.<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it is that the Church essentially appropriated Pagan holidays <br/>
to accommodate *those who had already converted* but who were less than <br/>
willing to part with their old celebrations. It wasn&#39;t as if the Church <br/>
invented the Christmas or Easter celebrations for the sake of &quot;pulling in the <br/>
Pagans.&quot; At least this is the impression I have. <br/>
<br/>
Choosing the date of the Christian celebration of Christ&#39;s resurrection <br/>
(Easter), for instance, seems to have simply been a case of convenience. The <br/>
Church used the dates or annual periods of ancient celebrations to locate its <br/>
new celebrations; times that people were already in the habit of setting <br/>
aside for celebration.<br/>
<br/>
A poor analogy (but the only I can come up with off the top of my head) would <br/>
be the idea that we typically schedule the birthday parties on Saturday or <br/>
Sunday -- not because those are our actual birth dates, but because those <br/>
days happen to be the two days of the week that most people have already set <br/>
aside for things like parties or celebrations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456607439">Moving over a couple of degrees, I think we also need to add a spoonful of &quot;appropriating Pagan celebrations and providing a clear alternative to show which side you were on&quot; to the mix.  Celebrations like Beltane were considered so horrific that the Church wanted  to make it clear that anyone participating was NOT Christian.  Some early converts tried to meld the old with the new (one example in modern times is people who have a shrine to Mary, say, but put voodoo artifacts upon it), and this was considered repugnant by the Authorities, so many things were done to ensure new members did not consider conversion an &quot;either/or&quot; process, including replacing some celebrations altogether, or at least forbidding participating in Pagan rituals.  That was one motivation.  In other cases,  actions were taken to try to stamp out Paganism (like building a Christian church on a site that was previously sacred to Paganism).  So I think you are both right -- it depends on the actual event.  You have to take it on a case by case basis.  Debi<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was a time waaay back in Catholic Church history when priests and monks <br/>
out on missions to convert the heathens did change pagan rites and <br/>
celebrations to suit the needs of the Church. Christmas being celebrated at <br/>
the time it is now celebrated came from the pagan rituals of the winter. When <br/>
the days became so short and nights long, pagans had celebrations of light. <br/>
(I am being very general here) The Catholic Church converted those <br/>
celebrations into their own to force pagans to *join.* The lights, Yule log, <br/>
and the use of evergreen trees all have pagan roots and were adopted by the <br/>
church as a way to ease this transition.<br/>
Christ died at the Passover time. Passover is predetermined and therefore so <br/>
is Easter. Easter is the first Sunday after the first full moon after the <br/>
spring equinox. Lent is the time before Easter so that is how Lent is <br/>
determined as well. It isn&#39;t because of convince. There are Easter traditions <br/>
that have pagan roots that the church adopted to *convence* pagans that <br/>
Easter was what they should be celebrating. <br/>
Halloween, another pagan celebration was converted to a Christian holiday <br/>
because the church didn&#39;t like the idea of celebrating the dead. The day <br/>
(November 1) is called All Souls Day or All Saints Day. Halloween is All <br/>
Hallows Eve, being the day before All Saints Day. <br/>
The church didn&#39;t necessarily invent these holidays as a way to &quot;pull the <br/>
pagans in&quot; but the church certainly did adopt pagan rituals, and use somewhat <br/>
unsavory tactics to &quot;convince&quot; the pagans that the ways of the church were <br/>
the true and right way. <br/>

predetermined just like Easter, although I do not know the exact formula. <br/>
Also, the Jewish calendar is lunar based (hope I am getting this right) and <br/>
since Christ Died at Passover (a Jewish Holy time) Christians had to find a <br/>
way to make their Easter come at (approximately) the same time as his death. <br/>
(My interpretation of the event anyway. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Or in this part of the world.(south texas). we know it as Dia De Los Muertos..day of the dead.. <br/>
BUT.. come to think of it.. i am a bit confused on this.. because it seems to be TWO days.. nov 1 and 2.. so is dia de los muertos the second? or the same as all saints? i have not figured this out yet, it seems.. i bet someone here knows..<br/>

evergreens into the house on Christmas Eve.  The other choice was to ban <br/>
anything that even looked like their old traditions.<br/>
<br/>
There are some Pueblo dances that would have died out had it not been they <br/>
were rededicated to Saints or loaned/connected to Christian holidays.  <br/>

Passover, Christians had to find a way to make Easter fall as close to the <br/>
time as possible. Since the calendars are so different, the universally <br/>
accepted formula was the best way possible. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405936903">The original Easter (ie, Christ&#39;s crucifixion) occured during Passover, so that is why the link between them.  *However*, the Jewish calendar is based on 13 lunar months of 28 days each, whereas North American society today is based on the Julian calendar of 12 months of varying duration.  The Jews can track passover as always occuring on a certain day during one of their lunar months.  They are not concerned about tracking Easter.  *Modern* culture tracks Easter, and does it through the Julian calendar.  That is why they are not celebrated concurrently.  They don&#39;t have a whole lot to do with each other -- kind of like Hannukah and Christmas.  The former is a celebration of Jewish rebels who were able to keep the oil lit in their (previously defiled) temple for 8 days, which was considered miraculous.  It has absolutely no connection with Christmas, which is celebrated December 25 (based on the Julian calendar).  Make sense?  This is not a case of Christians taking over a formerly Jewish celebration and redesigning it for their own ends.   Debi<br/>

Christians assimilated local seasonal customs.  I think they always have done <br/>
so, for 2000 years.<br/>

Oh, I know no one said it.  I forgot the phrase &quot;Unlike the Pagan scenario,&quot;  -- sometimes all the stuff in my head doesn&#39;t quite make it to the screen.  (Problem Between Chair and Keyboard).  I was merely using it to illustrate the point (you know, compare and contrast).  The one thing I really hate about email is that you con&#39;t see a person&#39;s face -- I am smiling and my eyes are twinkling.  I am not feeling snarky or defensive.
