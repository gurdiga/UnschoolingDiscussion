Wouldn&#39;tcha know, I just got some handy-dandy pocket cards that explain UU ~ <br/>
Our covenant to affirm and promote: <br/>
*The inherent worth and dignity of every person<br/>
*Justice, equity and compassion in human relations<br/>
*Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our <br/>
congregations<br/>
*A free and responsible search for truth and meaning<br/>
*The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our <br/>
congregations and in society at large<br/>
*The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all<br/>
*Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part<br/>
<br/>
The living tradition we share draws from many sources:<br/>
**Direct experience of that transcending mystery & wonder...<br/>
**Words & deeds of prophetic women and men which challenge us to confront <br/>
poers and structures of evil with justice, compassion & the transforming <br/>
power of love...<br/>
**Wisdom from the world&#39;s religions which inspires us in our ethical & <br/>
spiritual life...<br/>
**Jewish & Christian teachings which call us to respond to God&#39;s love by <br/>
loving our neighbors... <br/>
**Humanist teachings wich counsel us to heed guidance of reson and the <br/>
results of science...<br/>
**Spiritual teachings of Earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred <br/>
circle of life... <br/>

For my kids, it has been an amazing few months in this church.  They light a <br/>
chalice at the beginning of each *Religious Exploration* class [sunday <br/>
school] and say [with hand motions]: We light this chalice to celebrate <br/>
Unitarian Universalism.  This is the church of the open mind.  This is the <br/>
church of the helping hands.  This is the church of the loving heart.  <br/>
<br/>
Our service invocation is:<br/>
It is a blessing to be<br/>
It is a blessing to be here<br/>
It is a blessing to be here now<br/>
It is a blessing to be here now, together.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve seen someone else on this list talk about a UU conference [sorry, <br/>
don&#39;t remember your name] ~ It&#39;s really an *unschool-y* gathering of people :)<br/>
  Check out your local UU ~ more than once, the coolest people may be <br/>
sleeping in on your first Sunday there &lt;bg&gt; There&#39;s no homily/sermon, <br/>
congregants give *talks* ~ I&#39;ve learned lots of UU jokes, the Lakota creation <br/>
story [in Lakota & English], the connection between Humphry Bogart and a <br/>
local Native Tribe, the German origins of 12 Days of Christmas, original <br/>
Easter stories [pagan roots thru modern] ~ and many more; coming soon: Hindu <br/>
beliefs, more Lakota stories... <br/>
<br/>
Anyone is welcome, this is the one place where Hindus, Jews, Christians, <br/>
Agnostics, Natives, Explorers, Pagans, EVERYONE can celebrate life <br/>
side-by-side, respecting, loving and learning from one another.  In the few <br/>
months we&#39;ve been attending, I&#39;ve made friendships that have changed my life. <br/>
 In fact, I&#39;ve begun volunteering for the Sierra Club thru one member :) The <br/>
kids and I went camping in Spearfish Canyon last weekend with people we met <br/>
at church.  It was incredible!!  <br/>
<br/>
You can also check out uua.org ~ personally, I didn&#39;t *get it* til I went and <br/>
*felt it* in person at our fellowship.  <br/>
Rambling on... happy to share :) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That sounds interesting!<br/>
<br/>
But it depends on what church and probably what area of the country. So if<br/>
you don&#39;t like one, try another if you can.<br/>
<br/>
Our services are pretty standard Protestant. Except the sermon can be about<br/>
anything and draw on anything.<br/>
<br/>
Some churches don&#39;t mention God. Some do. But it&#39;s left up to the listeners<br/>
to decide what that means. It can mean the connectedness of everything.<br/>
Goddesses. Christian God. Whatever.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our UU minister gave a sermon about that last month. It was very interesting<br/>
to think about. Our service is very churchy but not very churchy if that makes<br/>
any sense. There are readings (but they can be from anything...poems, UU ministers,<br/>
the bible, novels...), hymns (some are even tunes that I knew from my episcopalian<br/>
upbringing but with different words), there is a sermon but it is not preachy<br/>
rather it just gives you interesting things to think about. We do have lay led<br/>
services and have speakers sometimes come in. Topics are great including environmentalism,<br/>
war, peace, etc. There is also music ranging from a sax quartet to a piano playing<br/>
show tunes. They celebrate easter, christmas, passover, winter/summer solstices (we<br/>
have a great outdoor wooded circle...there is a stream that runs through the church<br/>
property and we own a lot of land that we keep mostly in its natural state). I loved<br/>
that a couple of weeks ago my 3 yo had a seder in his RE class and then went and<br/>
joined another class to decorate easter eggs. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I have found that I like the ritual in the service and that I really enjoy the topics<br/>
discussed. And the community with like minded people is great. I got to talk with<br/>
one of the church founders at the visioning weekend (our church is only 22 years old)<br/>
and it was really neat to hear about how it started.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786888384">A friend of mine had piqued my curiosity regarding the UU church, so <br/>
I looked up the local church&#39;s website.  I found that the minister is <br/>
an athiest.  Most of the impressions I had about UU was that they are <br/>
open to exploring many beliefs regarding spirituality, but my <br/>
understanding of atheism is that basically they believe there is NO <br/>
god, so I don&#39;t quite get how you have spirituality without any form <br/>
of deity, whether it be god, goddess, buddha, etc.  Am I missing <br/>
something here?  <br/>
<br/>
It also seemed that there was a huge democratic &quot;slant&quot; in the <br/>
sermons shown on the website.  I don&#39;t really fall in line with <br/>
either republican or democrat, so I don&#39;t know that I would be <br/>
comfortable in a setting that was extreme one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my question would be whether these observations are in <br/>
line with the average UU church.  I have not been to any church in <br/>
over 2 years due to my frustrations with the one I had been very <br/>
involved with (non-denominational Christian.)  I am not really sure <br/>
that I feel like I need (or want) a church, but the seeming lack <br/>
of &quot;doctrine&quot; within the UU church did catch my eye.  (Plus the fact <br/>
that I also found out a small group of secular homeschoolers meet at <br/>
the UU church here, as well as an astronomy group...two of my <br/>
passions!)  Any input from an insider (or otherwise) would be great!</div>

 </span></blockquote>It confused me too. Being an atheist also I was uncomfortable with the word<br/>
spirituality since it suggested relationship with God. But it is more than<br/>
that. It&#39;s how we relate to everything. And how everything relates to<br/>
everything else. Carl Sagan said we&#39;re all made of star stuff. Native<br/>
Americans and pagans talk about the interconnectedness of everything. Our<br/>
spirituality affects how we see our place in the world and how we treat each<br/>
other.<br/>

atmosphere at any particular church is going to depend on who are the<br/>
loudest talkers ;-) It won&#39;t mean everyone agrees.<br/>
