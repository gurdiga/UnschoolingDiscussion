<div id="ygrps-yiv-576665282">My husband just called and informed me he&#39;s bringing my son home after <br/>
a &quot;Field Day&quot; that our community had at a local park.  (I went for a couple <br/>
of hours this morning, then had to come home.)  He said our son, Conner, is <br/>
&quot;bummed,&quot; because he didn&#39;t get a single ribbon for excelling in any one <br/>
event.  I, myself, couldn&#39;t care less.  I just wanted him to get out in the <br/>
fresh air and enjoy himself.  But seems there were some competitions that <br/>
were stiff and he is disappointed.  Do you all have any suggestions on what I <br/>
can say to him when he gets home to lighten his mood?  He is very sensitive. <br/>

<br/>
Thanks a lot, everyone,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865892445">I don&#39;t normally reply to this kind of question because there are so<br/>
many others more qualified to comment, with older boys and more<br/>
experience. However since you may have a time crunch I will make a small<br/>
suggestion, coming basically from &quot;How to Talk So Your Kids Will<br/>
Listen..&quot; and books/articles of that ilk. <br/>
<br/>
It is this: Don&#39;t try to lighten his mood, that may not help him to<br/>
process his feelings. If he talks about how badly he feels, honor his<br/>
feelings by repeating back to him without judgment or comment. You know,<br/>
words like &quot; you had a tough time&quot; or &quot;sounds like you feel pretty<br/>
shitty&quot;, without adding a &quot;but..&quot; of any kind. Feeling understood will<br/>
probably genuinely lighten his mood quicker than anything else would,<br/>
including minimizing the importance of the event itself. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

I hate to do this on such a serious thread, but I just had to laugh when I <br/>
read this!  If I said that to my kids, they&#39;d have an instant mood change <br/>
and die laughing!  I remember once when our daughter was having a hard time <br/>
with a friend.  The kid was making fun of her and my husband told her (Our <br/>
daughter) to tell her friend to kiss her ass!  I was stunned, don&#39;t get me <br/>
wrong, we can cuss with the best of them, but I really didn&#39;t think he&#39;d say <br/>
something like that to her!  Real kicker is she went and told her friend to <br/>
kiss her ass!  Shut the kid up but the mom called, pretty upset. LOL  My <br/>
dumb husband sat in the background telling me to tell HER to shut up and <br/>
kiss MY ass.    I could hardly keep it together long enough to talk to her <br/>
on the phone!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That reminded me of the time my son Sam was in Kindergarten and a big <br/>
kid, he was assigned to sit next to on the bus, was picking on him.  <br/>
The kid had whacked him on the shoulder with the back of his hand a <br/>
little to hard a few times and one day whacked him in the crotch.  <br/>
When he told me this, I was livid.  My dh then comes out and says, &quot; <br/>
If he ever does that again just kick him in the balls and run like <br/>
hell&quot;.  My kids just started rolling on the floor laughing at the <br/>
thought of it and the fact that my dh had said that.<br/>
I wanted to be mad at him for telling Sam to take that approach, but <br/>
everyone was laughing so hard that I just started laughing too.  <br/>
Fortunately, he was moved away from this kid soon after.<br/>

Let us know how it went.  I&#39;m probably too late.<br/>
<br/>
I would distract the kid with something comforting.  A movie, rent a video, <br/>
play a card game he likes, something different from what he was doing.  And <br/>
the next day I would ask what he liked best about what happened.  After some <br/>
time passes and the physical, biochemical components of the frustration and <br/>
the embarrassment and being tired and hungry (whatever all) are gone, he&#39;ll <br/>
probably be seeing the day in a better light.<br/>

<br/>
Hehe, maybe you will in SC!  Funny because he really enjoys things you say <br/>
as well.  (I read or quote your emails to him a lot. &lt;g&gt;)  I think you&#39;d get <br/>
along splendidly.  He&#39;s pretty opinionated and in your face.  In a good way. <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;  My maternal family always tells me I definitely found the right man.  <br/>
They are very quiet and reserved Episcopalians and we are the loud, <br/>
cantankerous, heathen agnostics. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766758475">I am so happy to be coming to the conference, because my husband will<br/>
finally meet some unschooling fathers. (Actually that is about good<br/>
reason 55 that I am happy to be coming!) I don&#39;t have any other<br/>
unschoolers in my local group, although most are relaxed/eclectic or<br/>
unit studies type of folks. Even so, he has rarely met a father at Park<br/>
Day.<br/>
