Seriously though, DH wants to spend another year in the US. I&#39;ve sort of agreed as long as its not Virginia. Our choices, based on current job offers are Syracuse, NY, Colorado Springs, CO and<br/>

It would be nice if the state was friendly to unschoolers but its not essential as I don&#39;t intend to announce myself when I arrive and it took 18 months for someone here to snitch to the school board<br/>
about me. We&#39;ll be gone within the year back to the UK.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since you&#39;re not going to be here for the long haul, Shyrley, New York <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be so bad.  You could stay underground (I definitely WON&#39;T <br/>
snitch).  That testing requirement is every other year and can start in <br/>
either fourth grade or fifth grade.  I&#39;m not sure how old your young&#39;uns <br/>
are, but if you&#39;re only going to be in New York for one year, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
sweat it.  All those requirements can be annoying, but everything depends <br/>
on the school district around here.  I just happen to have (whispering, <br/>
here) a rather apathetic school district who couldn&#39;t care less about <br/>
me.  Some of them, though, seem to have something to prove and they try to <br/>
get in your face, or so I understand.  I was going to stay underground, but <br/>
for some reason that I can&#39;t remember now I chickened out and sent in the <br/>
required letter of intent and individualized home instruction plan (&quot;I plan <br/>
to wear my pajamas until 1 p.m. Mondays, Wednesdays and alternating <br/>
Thursdays...&quot;).  But, I had help on all the other paperwork stuff, and I&#39;m <br/>
just skating along.  The school district (whispering here again) never <br/>
contacts me or acknowledges my paperwork.  Great!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of fleeing the country anyway because of all the madness, so <br/>
maybe we&#39;ll never have to deal with the testing requirement and the <br/>
smallpox vaccination requirement and all the other weird horrors that seem <br/>
to be coming down the pike...  I&#39;m rambling.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Shyrley, you probably can&#39;t go too wrong no matter where you end up <br/>
if you only have to be there for a year.  If I lived closer to Syracuse, <br/>
I&#39;d tell you all sorts of stuff so you&#39;d pick NY, but it&#39;s several hours&#39; <br/>
drive from here, only a little closer to me than you are right now.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

refused to tell me who or how but I rather think it was a &#39;who&#39; mainly cos my kids aren&#39;t registered anywhere - no doctors etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think I must have annoyed someone on a homeschooling list becaise I&#39;m pretty outspoken (loud n opinionated) so they turned me in. Ho hum.<br/>
It did mean I spent an hour translating the Notice of Intent to Homeschool form into Welsh. Virginia law doesn&#39;t say you have to file in English :-) and I&#39;m feeling petty.<br/>
I just called the school board too and asked about grades. They said I can put my kids in whatever grade feels appropriate and test for that grade at the end of the year. This means we will do the Grade<br/>
1 tests :-)<br/>

Where do you live? Here in NYC we have NYCHEA a support group founded <br/>
by unschoolers 20+ years ago. It is not an unschooling group per se <br/>
because it is an inclusive support group but we have many people who <br/>
have been unschooling for a time.<br/>
<br/>
You can also try reaching NYers at NY-Alert at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NY-alert/.">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NY-alert/.</a> It is a state-wide list. <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nyhen.org">http://www.nyhen.org</a>&gt;NYHEN is a state off-shoot of NHEN.<br/>
<br/>
There is really not a way out these regulations but a strategy. NY <br/>
state has the strictest compulsory laws after PA. Compliance is all <br/>
in the way you fill out the reports and how much importance you give <br/>
to the testing (you have to test the kids at some point or another).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157441911">Hi Sryrley,<br/>
We unschool in NY.  I have never run into any problems.  We have been with 2 <br/>
school districts and none has ever required a detailed curriculum.  Our <br/>
current district only gave enough space on the form for me to write we will <br/>
be using materials in our home and outside resources. Our district tells the <br/>
subjects covered, but not what to teach in the subjects.<br/>
For our old school district, I used the World Book of Knowledge website to <br/>
list what the kids would &quot;learn&quot; about.  The quarterly reports are easy: 0 <br/>
days absent, 100% completed and grade of excellent.  I put that in the <br/>
column for the first subject and then use ditto marks for all the rest.  <br/>
There is no annual testing.  You start in 4th or 5th grade and test every <br/>
other year.<br/>
We give the test at home, I sit with the child at the table and we go <br/>
through it together.  I order it early so we have lots of time to work on <br/>
it.  We use the California Achievement Test.  The non-test years, I send a <br/>
few paragraphs about what the child has &quot;learned&quot;, using the World Book of <br/>
Knowledge and the child&#39;s real interests.<br/>
<br/>
A funny and true story:  Homeschooling friends in our old district had <br/>
remodeled their kitchen, while cleaning up they found their quarterly <br/>
reports that should have been sent about a month ago.  Mrs. B. called the <br/>
school to apologize.  The school said,&quot; Oh, we thought you had sent them and <br/>
we had lost them!&quot;  Shows how much they care about the quarterlies.<br/>

  days absent, 100% completed and grade of excellent.  I put that in the <br/>
  column for the first subject and then use ditto marks for all the rest.  <br/>
  There is no annual testing.  You start in 4th or 5th grade and test every <br/>
  other year.<br/>
  We give the test at home, I sit with the child at the table and we go <br/>
  through it together.  I order it early so we have lots of time to work on <br/>
  it.  We use the California Achievement Test.  The non-test years, I send a <br/>
  few paragraphs about what the child has &quot;learned&quot;, using the World Book of <br/>
  Knowledge and the child&#39;s real interests.<br/>
<br/>
  A funny and true story:  Homeschooling friends in our old district had <br/>
  remodeled their kitchen, while cleaning up they found their quarterly <br/>
  reports that should have been sent about a month ago.  Mrs. B. called the <br/>
  school to apologize.  The school said,&quot; Oh, we thought you had sent them and <br/>
  we had lost them!&quot;  Shows how much they care about the quarterlies.<br/>

  &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling in NY<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I&#39;ve just been redaing state laws for HS in NY.<br/>
  &gt;Not a pleasant experience...<br/>
  &gt;Detailed curriculum, they tell you what to teach in what grades, quarterly <br/>
  &gt;reports plus annual testing.<br/>
  &gt;Does anyone unschool in NY and how do they do it?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;We might have to move to Minnesota instead, or Colorado Springs.<br/>
