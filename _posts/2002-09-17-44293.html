Grandma can&#39;t let this whole homeschooling thing sink in. I perused Sandra&#39;s <br/>

If she starts in, I&#39;m going to hand her some of the really pointed articles <br/>
and ask her to read them or else make it a taboo topic.<br/>
I think we have every right to refuse to talk about it with anyone that won&#39;t <br/>
educate themselves a little.<br/>
Don&#39;t let them wear you down....just say no.<br/>
The other thing I&#39;m going to try is being offensive. (not in the rude way, in <br/>
the proactive way:)<br/>
&quot;The kids are just loving their swimming lately, they have been building <br/>
medieval armor, man Sierra sure can write beautifully, Jared can add three <br/>
digits in his head, blah, blah, blah, blah....&quot;<br/>
Keep them so full of joyful information that they don&#39;t get a chance to have <br/>
any doubts about our family!! hehe<br/>

Thanks, Ren!<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m ready to ask people &quot;what do you know about homeschooling?&quot;<br/>
(in a mild tone of voice).<br/>
<br/>
I remind myself that I have read tens of books, hundreds of articles and<br/>
thousands of posts about homeschooling.  (Possibly tens of thousands of<br/>
posts. &lt;g&gt;)  Not to mention I have years of experience unschooling my<br/>
own child.  In this area, my family members are facing a fairly large<br/>
&quot;ignorance gap&quot;.  I&#39;ll try to remember that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961367861">Regarding ammo..<br/>
I also like the joyful junk.  I think people are so used to hearing negative things that they really don&#39;t know what to say when they hear someone actually enjoying their kids.  I love just watching peoples faces after I say..&quot;We are having so much fun!&quot;<br/>
Also, I practice on my husband, he doesn&#39;t know it tho&#39;.  Like the other night our girls, 5 & 7, were playing on the computer, Jumpstart Spanish, and they kept running into our room yelling different Spanish things at us. It was great, all I had to do was look at my husband and smile and he goes &quot; yeah, yeah..&quot;.<br/>
For me, I just need to be patient and more observant and I eventually see the ammo right here in my home.<br/>
Good luck everyone with your challenging visitors, I also have my mother coming this weekend.  She has no clue about our learning,  she will after this weekend.  Can&#39;t wait to see what she has to say after she sees my ds playing the PS2 and that we stopped violin and cello lessons, and he hasn&#39;t read a book in a month!! Horrors!  I am just now learning to accept these things, can you tell?<br/>
I am also still keeping the instruments around but I could tell they weren&#39;t that passionate about the lessons anymore,  everyone is &quot;ohhh, and they were so good!&quot;..  They seem so sad!(The other people)<br/>
<br/>
  I have to believe that if that is their passion they will come back to it.  Growing up, I also played piano and violin through grade school and high school.  Then I quit when I went to college,  I do think back now and wish I would have continued, but then would I have developed into the person I am now?  I think all those things are really important and now I enjoy playing.  If I want, I can always pick them up again or learn another!  Thanks John Holt!<br/>
