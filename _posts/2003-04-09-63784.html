<br/>
My friend. Miranda, was assistant manger in a french restaurant on a very <br/>
busy night. They had several young Vietnamese men as waiters and busboys. The <br/>
manager walked by and asked one of the busboys to please open a can of <br/>
cherries and pour it over the cheesecake on the dessert cart. The fellow did <br/>
as he was told. A waiter cut a piece and served it. My friend Miranda saw as <br/>
she walked by that it was NOT cherries, but green OLIVES! on the cake. <br/>
<br/>
Before she went to apologize to the guest with the slice, she told the <br/>
manager. The manager held Miranda back and took care of it herself. She <br/>
walked up and asked the guest how she liked her cheesecake. The woman RAVED <br/>
about how clever and innovative the chef must be! That was the best cake <br/>
she&#39;d ever had, and could she have the recipe! &lt;G&gt; The manager smiled and <br/>
said and that she was glad she liked it---and she would tell the chef how <br/>
happy the guest was!<br/>
<br/>
Miranda says she learned a valuable lesson in restaurant management that day! <br/>
