<div id="ygrps-yiv-817418118">Hi Sonia and all,<br/>
<br/>
I am the one who was posting Aletha Solter articles. I have read all three<br/>
of her books, &quot;The Aware Baby&quot;, &quot;Helping Young Children Flourish&quot; and &quot;Tears<br/>
and Tantrums&quot;. I would highly recommend all three. If you are interested in<br/>
talking to parents who use Aletha Solter&#39;s approach to parenting<br/>
specifically, there is an aware-parenting e-group and here is the link:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:awareparenting@egroups.com">awareparenting@egroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One key aspect of Aware parenting is developing a deep understanding of how<br/>
our own upbringing affects our relationships with our children as well as<br/>
with everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any specific questions, feel free to contact me.<br/>
<br/>
There are also a lot of good links at Aletha Solter&#39;s web site<br/>
