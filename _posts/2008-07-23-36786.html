in Australia (yesterday already to us Americans ;)) -- and it didn&#39;t take<br/>
long for me to follow his example... I just couldn&#39;t turn off Dune at<br/>
midnight & I happened to make a spectacular batch of Oh My God Brownies. Now<br/>
I&#39;m thinking my day shouldn&#39;t *really* start until after I&#39;ve slept... but<br/>
that much thinking is *sure* to lead to some learnin&#39;!!<br/>
Tonight I got to share your concept with a school teacher in my bowling<br/>
league, he *loved* the idea :D<br/>
Happy Birthday Sandra & I&#39;m so glad you were born!! Kirby can give you a big<br/>
birthday hug in my stead ;)<br/>

Rats, I forgot!! So did the rest of my family, apparently.... the latest  <br/>
riser has been up less than a half hour and already learned something. We a  <br/>
family of failures-we failed to Learn Nothing. LOL Isn&#39;t that an example of a  <br/>
double negative? ;~)<br/>

Happy Birthday, Sandra!<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Brett (Holly&#39;s boyfriend lately, but Kirby&#39;s friend for several  <br/>
years) went to get him at the airport and was supposed to take him to  <br/>
dinner, so I thought we had lots of time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keith overflowed the portable evaporative cooler we got to put in the  <br/>
library (the old one died last summer), so Kirby can stay up there  <br/>
without baking.   So I was up there with the carpet cleaner vacuuming  <br/>
water out of the carpet when Kirby showed up early.  They decided to  <br/>
come back to the house instead of out to eat.   I heard him talking  <br/>
to others and I wanted to finish and then go greet him, but he came  <br/>
right up there and gave me a big hug right where I vacuumed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few hours later I came upstairs and he was leaning on the kitchen  <br/>
counter so I saw him all the way up the stairs and I said &quot;You&#39;re a  <br/>
good birthday present.&quot;  He said &quot;You are too!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend this visits-for-birthday-gifts thing.<br/>

OH!  Very bad sentence, and the comma made it worse.<br/>
<br/>
We got a cooler so Kirby will be comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Keith putting in more water than it can hold will NOT be the reason  <br/>
Kirby will not bake. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335864614">Dear Sandra Happy Birthday!!<br/>
Thank you for all you have done for us unschooling families. <br/>
As for Learn Nothing Day I have completely failed at it.<br/>
I had my cousin spend the night yesterday and he just left today.<br/>
I have not seen him in 14 years and I tell you that we have talked for  hours and all this talking can only lead to one thing....<br/>
We talked about waves, tsunamis, family, friendship, pot ( yes the green kind), about Hawaiian dialect ( he lives in the North Shore) so I learned a few things...sorry.....<br/>
So Happy Learn Nothing Day for all!!!<br/>
I FAILED!<br/>

information about something else and was going to read that, then I<br/>
realised what I was doing, went back to where I read the word I wanted<br/>
to know the meaning of, which was in the caption to a photo posted<br/>
online by one of my Facebook friends, and asked him to tell me what it<br/>
meant, thinking he wouldn&#39;t reply until Learn Nothing Day was over,<br/>
which he didn&#39;t. Then I watched an episode of Mythbusters with my<br/>
son and inadvertently learned some things I didn&#39;t know about ninjas. <br/>
<br/>
So, one way or another, I did fail very quickly! Well before Learning<br/>
Nothing Day in America. :)<br/>
