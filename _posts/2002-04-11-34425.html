&lt;&lt; I think that learning to follow<br/>
through on your agreements is character building, and that in my book is<br/>
absolutely necessary. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Following through on a commitment to do something which turns out to be <br/>
harmful or counterproductive or wasteful or soul-draining builds pain and <br/>
sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes I would.  If I have made a commitment to something, I need to see it<br/>
though to the end, at 11 or 36 years of age.  A commitment is a<br/>
commitment. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
An eleven year old is not legally of an age to make binding contracts.<br/>
A commitment without knowing what really is to come is entering a tunnel <br/>
blindly.  To follow every blind tunnel to its end  no matter how painful is <br/>
not wise.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s better to learn not to make commitments to things not tested a <br/>
bit first.<br/>
