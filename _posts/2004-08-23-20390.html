I am really trying to bow out of this discussion after Sandra said I was <br/>
going into too much detail about a baby. But people keep posting things <br/>
that I feel I must address.<br/>
*********I&#39;m posting about the idea. Not you. Not your baby girl. Only about <br/>
the idea of adults in general being amused by crying children*** <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. It&#39;s NOT major. I know my child and I am not minimizing her emotions <br/>
just because they aren&#39;t physical pain. If it was major, the crying <br/>
would go on for a lot longer and she would want to be held, snuggled, <br/>
etc. This is just MINOR frustration, disappointment that she prefers to <br/>
work out on her own. I am totally there for her 110%.<br/>
<br/>
****In my last post I mentioned that it may very well be major to the person <br/>
who is crying because when that rush of emotion comes, it may come hard and <br/>
fast and strong. Maybe, on the idea that there are different levels of <br/>
disappointment to little tiny people, we&#39;ll have to understand that we have different <br/>
beliefs. We never WILL know that answer becasue most of the humans on the <br/>
planet can&#39;t really understand and conceptualize what is going on inside another <br/>
human, can they?*****<br/>
<br/>
2. Perhaps you missed the beginning of the thread, but the whole reason <br/>
why I mentioned DH finding this amusing in the first place was because I <br/>
cautioned him not to laugh. Because it doesn&#39;t happen every time, just <br/>
sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
***for others reading this thread, who may be reading with the realization <br/>
that a similar issue has gone on in their house, I want to say that sometimes <br/>
can be too often.****<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not unfeeling or lacking in compassion. Neither am I.<br/>
3. We treat each other with compassion in this family and we are setting <br/>
a very good example in general for DD in the way we treat each other in <br/>
general on a day to day basis. I know how powerful teaching by example <br/>
is.<br/>

********I don&#39;t think I said that you were uncaring. I&#39;m talking about the <br/>
idea.<br/>
