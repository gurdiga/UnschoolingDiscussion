<br/>
For years, until organic and humanely killed meat was more easily <br/>
available, I would only eat what my family hunted. Luckily between my <br/>
brother and my nieces husband I was able to fill the freezer and have <br/>
what I needed. <br/>
<br/>
Of course hearing the hunting horror stories about the careless idiots <br/>
that didn&#39;t bother to track what they hit or was only hunting for a <br/>
trophy was appalling as well.<br/>
<br/>
I think this thread brought up issues like breeding animals for <br/>
experimentation.. which I haven&#39;t seen any evidence of any great results <br/>
from the hoards of torture that has been going on for the past 50 or so <br/>
years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702108146">&lt;&lt;the same rules apply when adopting a child for the first few years or so,<br/>
why not an animal?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is incorrect.  Prior to finalizing an adoption, the placing agency is<br/>
still responsible for the welfare of the child.  The agency, the family, or<br/>
the child, if old enough, is able to terminate that placement.  It is a get<br/>
to know each other time.  The instant of the finalization, family becomes<br/>
totally responsible for the child and all supervision by the agency ceases.<br/>
<br/>
I can see shelters being concerned about the welfare of an animal.  A more<br/>
appropriate rule I think would be say a 1 month trial period, during which<br/>
the shelter or the owner could return the animal to the shelter and the<br/>
owner get their money back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678042052">Here in several of the Northern California counties there are groups that<br/>
are working hard to eliminate or at least reduce the ferel cat populations.<br/>
they trap them, neuter them and then find ranchers that will allow them to<br/>
be turned loose on their land.  There is one sheep ranch on the coast in<br/>
Sonoma County that has taken a couple hundred of the cats.  Of course, he<br/>
has several thousand acres, so they aren&#39;t a problem for him.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a group in Santa Rosa who has been trapping the ferel cats<br/>
that run around the city (the city is built over several creeks that have<br/>
been routed through underground canals), neutering them and then turning<br/>
them back loose right in the city.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185303966">Yummy!  I love rabbit stew!<br/>
<br/>
Julie, I appreciate your bluntness very much.  You tell it the way it is <br/>
for you.<br/>
<br/>
Having been brought up in the city and suburbs, I don&#39;t think I could <br/>
bring myself to kill a little rabbit, however.  I have been too far <br/>
removed from nature and the farming life to have the experiences you <br/>
speak about, Julie.  One of my best friends grew up on a farm in <br/>
Indiana.  She is full of wonderful stories of how her family made a <br/>
living.   They grow their own food and raise their own animals to sell <br/>
and feed themselves.<br/>
<br/>
This has been going on for thousands of years.  We are carnivorous <br/>
mammals.  If you don&#39;t believe me, look at your teeth in the mirror.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we can sustain ourselves on soy products, vegetables, fruits, <br/>
nuts, etc., as I did as a vegan for several years.  But, I prefer to <br/>
follow my more natural desire and inclinations which is to eat meat.  I <br/>
don&#39;t believe in suppressing anything, and that includes my desire to <br/>
eat other living beings.  It is a very natural thing for us to do.  <br/>
Isn&#39;t that what other carnivorous animals do?  We are at the top of the <br/>
food chain and we should not be ashamed of it.<br/>
<br/>
Mimi<br/>
(Who has rescued at least 5 dogs, 20 cats and 3 birds.)  No, I didn&#39;t <br/>
eat them.  In the cultures which I grew up in, we don&#39;t eat dogs, cats <br/>
or sparrows.  Well, actually, I do have an old friend, an old Greek guy <br/>
who I once saw steal baby sparrows out of their nest.  He took them <br/>
home, pickled them and ate them.  This same man was a little boy during <br/>
WWII on a Greek island occupied by the Germans.  He told me many stories <br/>
of how so many Greeks starved to death during the war and how he <br/>
remembered eating grass roots to stay alive.  He saw these birds as a <br/>
treat and a delicacy.  I wasn&#39;t about to judge him, even though I was a <br/>
vegetarian at the time.<br/>
<br/>
