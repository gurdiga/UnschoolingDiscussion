<div id="ygrps-yiv-919150333"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am completely confused by your post.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I regret that.  I&#39;ll try to be more clear below.<br/>
<br/>
Please understand that I answered your post after picking up digests.<br/>
Therefore, I learned after I&#39;d already replied to it that you&#39;d resolved the<br/>
issue with your son.  This happens regularly here, because many people do<br/>
receive on digest.  I wasn&#39;t trying to beat a dead horse.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Regarding music, I play mutliple instruments, and I never even mentioned<br/>
&gt; piano, so I&#39;m not sure why everyone is assuming that I am talking about piano.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about everybody, being only one somebody, but I assumed that<br/>
you were talking about piano because your vision of notation sounded limited<br/>
to the idea of one black spot, one place on the instrument.  Only piano has<br/>
that kind of visual link.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; In every instrument the notation of &quot;C&quot; means &quot;C&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not on a transposing instrument.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On <br/>
&gt; the violin, its a particular finger position.  On the guitar, it is also a<br/>
&gt; particular finger position.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But here is my point.  A note on the treble clef staff does not always send<br/>
you to a particular finger placement.  For example, the &quot;A&quot; that is the<br/>
second space on the treble clef is an open string on my violin.  But it&#39;s<br/>
also a stopped note on the two lower strings, and can be played with any of<br/>
the 4 fingers, for a total of 9 locations.  It&#39;s even worse on guitar, with<br/>
more than 4 strings!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On a saxophone or trumpet, it is a finger<br/>
&gt; positioning, or a combination of finger positions that only vary depending on<br/>
&gt; the octave involved.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the trumpet, those 3 little valves only improve the pitch.  A great<br/>
trumpet player plays all the notes with the mouth by changing lip and tongue<br/>
positions and the speed and support of the breath.  I don&#39;t know much about<br/>
saxaphone, sorry.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; But &quot;c&quot; is still &quot;c&quot;.  That never changes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, it&#39;s c.  But it&#39;s a lot more abstract than you made it sound.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see music as abstract at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do.  I hope that it&#39;s more clear *why* I do.  You can see it as not<br/>
abstract if you want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what way is it &quot;multistep&quot; other than to learn the notation and how it<br/>
&gt; accomplished on the particular instrument you are playing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Multistep music.  Okay.  I&#39;m a professional musician, and this is my concept<br/>
of the steps.  The first 3 steps take about 3 seconds for me.  I&#39;ve spent<br/>
entire lessons working through them with kids, though.<br/>
<br/>
New music: <br/>
Step 1: composer.  That affects the way I look at the music.  Not just in<br/>
interpretation, but also how I read the notes.  Ornaments (turns, trills,<br/>
mordents, etc.) are read differently in differnet periods.<br/>
<br/>
Step 2: key signature.  quick scan to see if it changes anyplace.<br/>
<br/>
Step 3: time signature, and a glace above at the tempo marking.  Allegro is<br/>
a pretty abstract concept in itself (fast? how fast?).  select tempo.<br/>
negotiate with other people if necessary, or take a look at what the<br/>
conductor wants.<br/>
<br/>
Step 4: <br/>
notes.  I make a million decisions every minute as I play.  I take the notes<br/>
on the page and decide, while playing, where to play them on the instrument.<br/>
That&#39;s not interpretative, that&#39;s functional.  Can I reach the next note if<br/>
I play this one here, with this finger.<br/>
<br/>
and so on. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; After that, there are many ways to play the same note on a particular<br/>
&gt; instrument. Take the violin for example.  You can play a note, use vibrato, or<br/>
&gt; use pizzacato, all of which is in the notation on the music.  But you are<br/>
&gt; still playing the same note, and each symbol on the paper represents one<br/>
&gt; thing, and the technique to play the music the way its written never changes,<br/>
&gt; even though the style might.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope that what I&#39;ve written above helps you understand why I say that<br/>
there are different techniques to play the notes the way they are written.<br/>
And vibrato, for the record, is never written into the music I play.  That&#39;s<br/>
dropped about the 2nd year of playing.  I make decisions about bow stroke,<br/>
vibrato, and such myself.  But that&#39;s stylistic, which you aren&#39;t thinking<br/>
of as technical.  I do, because there&#39;s a technical approach to each piece<br/>
of style, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; In contrast to music, there are many technical ways to solve a single problem<br/>
&gt; in math.  When adding, you can add from right to left, you can add from left<br/>
&gt; to right, you can estimate and subract, you can mentally compute it in your<br/>
&gt; head by any combination of these methods.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course.  But if you understand the CONCEPT of what you are trying to do,<br/>
than the notes fall into place.  If you understand the CONCEPT of the math<br/>
problem you are trying to solve, then you choose the technical way that<br/>
makes the most sense to you.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning players want to learn the technical steps without the concepts.<br/>
If it says this black dot, do I play D string with second finger?  Getting<br/>
beyond that is the first step to really playing music.<br/>
<br/>
School children are told to learn the technical steps without the concepts.<br/>
And then they forget the steps.  Getting beyond that is the route to really<br/>
understanding math.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What difference does it make<br/>
&gt; that you flip the fraction over and mulitply if you haven&#39;t got any idea WHY<br/>
&gt; you would do that.  If you understand the concepts, you see why that works.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was a question I asked for myself.  That one had nothing to do with my son.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But my point is the same.  You must understand the concept before you can<br/>
teach it.<br/>
<br/>
Great violinists do not always make great teachers.  I&#39;ve studied with great<br/>
players who could not explain what they did to save their life.  They just<br/>
don&#39;t know.  And that&#39;s no help to me or anyone else.  Great teachers are<br/>
people who understand WHY you do what you do, and don&#39;t just do something<br/>
instinctually.  They can explain it.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; If you don&#39;t get it, why are you trying to teach him to not get it? &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because he asked me to teach him the way his friends learn.   I thought that<br/>
&gt; was what he wanted, so thats what I did.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The impression I feel like you had given here was that you were teaching<br/>
your son.  Teaching.  If you don&#39;t understand the concepts behind it, you<br/>
can&#39;t teach it.  That was my point.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that you put the book away.  But I hope that you don&#39;t fall into<br/>
this trap again.  You don&#39;t have to teach him anything, but if asked to<br/>
teach something, by someone, it should be something you really understand.<br/>
In my humble opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832108154">THank you SO much for writing this.  I really appreciate the time and thought you put into it.  See comments below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; I am completely confused by your post.<br/>

  No problem.  I figured it was something like that :o).  I noticed I&#39;ve been getting some posts out of order myself.  Thats why I recapped.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; In every instrument the notation of &quot;C&quot; means &quot;C&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Not on a transposing instrument.<br/>
<br/>
  Ok, this is new to me.  I&#39;ll look it up, but if you feel like it, I&#39;d be glad to hear more about it.  Given your example of a violin, I assume that is considered a &quot;transposing instrument&quot;.  I&#39;ve never heard it called that.  I&#39;ll check it out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; On <br/>
  &gt; the violin, its a particular finger position.  On the guitar, it is also a<br/>
  &gt; particular finger position.<br/>

  second space on the treble clef is an open string on my violin.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  True.  I guess I always considered &quot;open&quot; to be another finger position.<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;On the trumpet, those 3 little valves only improve the pitch.  A great<br/>

  saxaphone, sorry.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I didn&#39;t know that about the trumpet, but it does make sense since there are only so many combinations of fingerings with 3 valves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; what way is it &quot;multistep&quot; other than to learn the notation and how it<br/>
  &gt; accomplished on the particular instrument you are playing?<br/>

<br/>
  &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  You know something, I totally agree with you.  I think when we are talking about music, what I call stylistic differences (allegro, etc), you call abstract. And I do think stylistic differences *are* abstract.<br/>
<br/>
   When I think of technical issues, I&#39;m thinking of the notes themselves, or the notation for &quot;up bow&quot; or &quot;down bow&quot;, pizz, etc.  Those things mean something specific, but other things mean something of creative license.<br/>
<br/>
  And creative license is abstract, even though there are also techniques to style.<br/>
<br/>
  I *think* we agree, but we were maybe saying it different ways.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

  I completely agree with you. Thank you so much for going back and explaining it.  I hope I don&#39;t fall into that trap again too.  The truth is, I fall back on textbooks (especially in math) because I *don&#39;t* understand everything, and even when I do, I have a hard time teaching it. <br/>
<br/>
  But given the fact he appeared interested, I was hoping it would all make more sense in spite of me. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I make a dozen decisions, not a million. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
But my main instrument lately is recorder.  It&#39;s fairly crude, but even <br/>
there, I see the note, and I feel in my hands whether I have an F instrument <br/>
or a C instrument.  If I&#39;ve been just playing one for a whole hour, I&#39;m not <br/>
thinking that anymore, but in the set of music we&#39;ve been doing lately I <br/>
switch between alto and soprano a fair amount.<br/>
<br/>
A G on the paper is a different combo of fingers depending which recorder I <br/>
have.  Good.  I&#39;m going.<br/>
<br/>
When I get to (on an alto, I&#39;ll use as an example) a low E, there are two <br/>
equally good fingerings to use, and it depends which notes it&#39;s next to which <br/>
one I&#39;m going to use.  No sense moving three fingers when I can just move <br/>
one.  Other combos are better with the other fingering.<br/>
<br/>
In a fast run, I can use a trill/alternate fingering sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
On my Küng recorder, the high A is sharp, always, and so I shade that by <br/>
putting my fourth finger, right hand, close to the surface of a hole.  If I&#39;m <br/>
using the Moeck or a plastic Yamaha, that A is fine without shading it down.  <br/>
But those other two have a harder time going above high C.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing that same recorder since I was 19, off and on, though, and <br/>
I remember it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not abstraction, that&#39;s detailed particulars.  <br/>
<br/>
The idea that one note represents one set of fingerings isn&#39;t true of all <br/>
instruments.  Bass recorders famously have to be learned, each one, by each <br/>
musician.  The notes in the middle of the range are likely to be good as on <br/>
higher pitched recorders.  But when you get to the higher and lower notes you <br/>
kinda have to find each one for that particular instrument.  It&#39;s not a wild <br/>
search, there are likelihoods and physical (as in physics) realities.  But <br/>
nobody here can say &quot;On any bass recorder, a low A is fingered like this.&quot;  <br/>
The most they can say is &quot;Might be, on an F bass, like this; try it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And still people play recorders!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And people still love math, if they love it, because of the patterns and the <br/>
flow of ideas and relationships between things, not because the formulas are <br/>
pretty on paper.  Because they liked and understood math first and THEN <br/>
wanted to learn the notation so someone could show them some cool other <br/>
stuff.  School&#39;s math methods can kill that dead for all but the lucky few <br/>
who understood math in their heads, on their fingers, on chessboards, or in <br/>
their yards on the fencewire before they got there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not quite.  A certain fingering on trumpet or French horn will get you into<br/>
a series of partials.  Which of the partials you get depends on the lip.  So<br/>
on horn, an open fingering will get you the C two octaves below middle<br/>
(written) C, the C above that, the G above that, middle C, then E, G, C, D,<br/>
E, G, A, C.  There are also some other notes you can get, but they don&#39;t<br/>
tend to be in tune.  As you can see, the higher you go in the partial, the<br/>
closer together the notes are.  And *that&#39;s* the reason horn players tend to<br/>
miss more notes than other instrumentalists.  They play high in the<br/>
partials.  Trumpets play lower in theirs.  If I remember my one quarter of<br/>
trombone correctly, the positions work the same way as the fingerings on<br/>
trumpet or horn.  The position gets you into the right partial.  Then your<br/>
lips decide where in the partial.<br/>
<br/>
As for improving the pitch, I can&#39;t remember how it&#39;s done on the trumpet.<br/>
On the horn, you do it some with your lips, but you also move the right hand<br/>
in and out of the bell for tuning.<br/>
