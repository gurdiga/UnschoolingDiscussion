<div id="ygrps-yiv-461891915">I went to court for my divorce trial this morning.  My soon to be ex dh announced that I did not discuss the issue with him before I took the kids out of school to homeschool them.  This is not true but that is not the issue at hand.<br/>
<br/>
The judge an old, graying woman decided that this upset her greatly.  She believes this does a grave injustice to the kids, especially those going though a divorce.  She believes that children belong in school.  <br/>
<br/>
So she appointed a legal guardian to research this situation both in our home and at school.  Now I am furious that someone should challenge my decision to home school my kids.  That is a violation of my rights.<br/>
<br/>
So what do I do next?  Do I need to retain an edcational attorney? (which I do not have the money for?)<br/>

Thanks<br/>

&gt;  Hi Carole,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You need to contact the Home School Legal Defense Association.  They <br/>
are wonderful! I think it&#39;s www.hsld.org.  If not, just do a search.  <br/>
It&#39;s $100/yr. per family to join.  After that, they will do <br/>
everything possible to defend your right to homeschool at no <br/>
additional charge.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you,<br/>
<br/>

You will, if you have not already, probably have to write a letter of intent stating that you want to pull your kids out of school. I love how people think they know whats best for our own kids when all they really know is what they grew up with. In the state of CT you do not need a letter of intent by law although some people will claim that you do because of the wording. It is not a law. i attatched some info for you and you should visit the following websites: the NHELD, ct legal defense website. there are a ton of support groups who would LOVE to help too. good luck.<br/>

Uch, please don&#39;t.<br/>
Unless you are using an approved curriculum/unit study/hs resource of the month, they will not represent you. they don&#39;t like unschoolers.<br/>
They also specifically state somewhere on their website that they do not get involved in domestic cases.<br/>
So an unschooler in the middle of a divorce trial gets nothing from them.<br/>

responded promptly and with great information. I believe she is the best<br/>

<br/>
So she appointed a legal guardian to research this situation both in our home and at school. Now I am furious that someone should challenge my decision to home school my kids. That is a violation of my rights.<br/>

So what do I do next? Do I need to retain an edcational attorney? (which I do not have the money for?)<br/>

&gt;&gt;  Hi Carole,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You need to contact the Home School Legal Defense Association.  They<br/>
&gt; are wonderful! I think it&#39;s www.hsld.org.  If not, just do a search.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s $100/yr. per family to join.  After that, they will do<br/>
&gt; everything possible to defend your right to homeschool at no<br/>
&gt; additional charge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best of luck to you,<br/>

H$LDA won&#39;t defend unschoolers.  One of my friends applied, stating her <br/>
preferred method of teaching (not to) and curriculum (none) -- they <br/>
sent back the check. They also will not get involved in divorce cases.<br/>

<br/>
If you haven&#39;t investigated the information against HSLDA then *your*  <br/>
&quot;personal opinion&quot; is merely your understanding of Michael Farris&#39;s  <br/>
opinion of his own organization (that has made him a very wealthy  <br/>
powerful man.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also some information and a lot of links, including how to  <br/>
investigate HSLDA&#39;s practices in your own state, at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/articles/102299.htm">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/articles/102299.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers make HSLDA nervous. Because we don&#39;t stick to the school  <br/>
schedule of learning we potentially draw government attention to all  <br/>
homeschoolers and potentially cause legislatures to create  <br/>
regulations that will allow the government to check up on  <br/>
homeschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA doesn&#39;t want government intrusion into homeschooling. (Nor do  <br/>
other homeschoolers.) But they don&#39;t mind regulation that favors  <br/>
school at homers -- like periodic testing -- since most of their  <br/>
members are. There&#39;s the interesting case of Michigan that went from  <br/>
no regulation to more difficult:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/leginfo/detail_code.asp?StateCode=Michigan">http://www.nhen.org/leginfo/detail_code.asp?StateCode=Michigan</a><br/>
<br/>
The first part is state information and you can scroll down to &quot;The  <br/>
hearing procedure required by the Michigan Supreme Court in Bennett  <br/>
effectively freed home schooling families from any regulation&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The pertinent section is:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This was the state of the law until the Legislature enacted the  <br/>
&gt; Revised School Code in December, 1995. Under the influence of a  <br/>
&gt; misguided state senator [he admitted this when faced with the  <br/>
&gt; problems created by the Revised School Code] who was a new home  <br/>
&gt; schooler, the Senate inserted a provision defining home-schooling  <br/>
&gt; in terms of a separate exemption to the compulsory attendance law,  <br/>
&gt; the infamous subsection (3)(f). This so-called exemption was made  <br/>
&gt; even more onerous in the Michigan House under the guidance of a  <br/>
&gt; home-schooling representative who was closely allied with HSLDA.  <br/>
&gt; The exemption was expanded in the House to include standards that  <br/>
&gt; would have permitted local school district officials to closely  <br/>
&gt; regulate home schooling families. Most importantly, the legislative  <br/>
&gt; change defining home schooling upset the status quo that had been  <br/>
&gt; in place since the Supreme Court decisions two and a half years  <br/>
&gt; earlier. There would inevitably be a new round of law suits and  <br/>
&gt; prosecutions, with uncertain results, to interpret and clarify the  <br/>
&gt; new law. Our peace had been shattered. The legal situation  <br/>
&gt; surrounding home-schooling was neither certain nor clear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As soon as those in the home schooling community realized what had  <br/>
&gt; been done to them, a coalition of home schooling families was  <br/>
&gt; formed of those opposed to the change in the law. From this  <br/>
&gt; coalition, two approaches were developed. First, an effort would be  <br/>
&gt; made to obtain the repeal of the new law to return the legal  <br/>
&gt; situation to the peace we had after the 1993 Michigan Supreme Court  <br/>
&gt; decisions. Second, a network would be formed to keep home schooling  <br/>
&gt; families aware of developments that could affect them. This was the  <br/>
&gt; origin of the Home Education Communication Network of Michigan  <br/>
&gt; [HECNM], which may become operational in the near future. The  <br/>
&gt; repeal of subsection (3)(f) was opposed by the Information Network  <br/>
&gt; for Christian Homes [INCH] and HSLDA. They claimed that the new law  <br/>
&gt; was a major improvement!!<br/>

  Does your husband think the kids should be in school?  If so, then she&#39;s speaking to an issue that&#39;s still in contention between the two of you.  <br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s not that judges hate homeschooling -- I know divorced folks who homeschool, even unschool. What makes it different is that the parents agreed on home/unschooling and the judge just signed off on the parents&#39; agreement.  There was nothing else for the judge to do since that was already agreed on.  Until/unless your ex-dh agrees to homeschooling -- or is so completely discredited in every way that you get sole custody -- a judge certainly can order that your children be in school.  Even after a divorce, you still share your children -- where disagreements arise, it&#39;s a matter of lose some, win some.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476641109">Thanks, this does make things easier to understand - distancing myself from the emotion.<br/>
<br/>
Some history here is that I do have sole custody now.  Their dad has not paid child support for 2 years. He does not want to be divorced, so he is trying to find contention to bring to court.  He brought this divorce to trial. I showed up in court month after month for one year.  Each and every time he would look over the divorce agreement and refuse to sign.   Because he wants the child support to be contingent on whether or not he has a job.   Because I have a lousy lawyer and because we saw different judges it has come to this.  <br/>
<br/>
My parents do not believe in home schooling and my Dad is using Francisco to be heard.  <br/>

for one year. Each and every time he would look over the divorce  <br/>
agreement and refuse to sign. Because he wants the child support to  <br/>
be contingent on whether or not he has a job. Because I have a lousy  <br/>
lawyer and because we saw different judges it has come to this. -=-<br/>
<br/>
How much is unschooling worth to you?   If you have sole custody and  <br/>
you ask for divorce without child support, and with full custody,  <br/>
then you can unschool.  (Maybe.)<br/>
<br/>
If you hold out for child support, you&#39;ll probably also have to  <br/>
concede control or some veto power to the one who&#39;s paying child  <br/>
support.<br/>
<br/>
Because none of this is about how children learn, though, I don&#39;t  <br/>
think this is the best list for discussing it.<br/>
<br/>
At first I didn&#39;t mind because I was gone three days and it had  <br/>
already gone toward legality and that, and my own contributions had  <br/>
to do with clarity of thought and with finding the simple moment in  <br/>
the long drawn out proceedings.<br/>

There is no way you can probably justify unschooling to these  <br/>
officials - you&#39;ll need to make sure you talk about homeschooling,  <br/>
only. You could use an unschooling curriculum description, though -  <br/>
rewrite it to be about your own kids, specifically. I think it is  <br/>
pretty impressive. It is here, on Sandra&#39;s site: &lt;http:// <br/>
