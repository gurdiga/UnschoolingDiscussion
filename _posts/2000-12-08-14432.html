&lt;&lt;  I have a friend whose 2 year old<br/>
 daughter has cradle cap.  Is this possible? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sonia, my daughter who just turned 3 had a very mild case of cradle cap until <br/>
after she was 2 years old.  She had scales right on her scalp and her hair <br/>
never grew long until she was almost 2 1/2.  I always shampooed normally <br/>
except I used a soft scalp sponge (the one the hospital gave me) when <br/>
shampooing.  When she was about 2 I started combing her hair when it was wet <br/>
and soapy and the cradle cap would start coming off in little clumps.  I was <br/>
always very gentle and only combed a little bit as my dd&#39;s head would get <br/>
very red if it was messed with too much.  It&#39;s funny to look back now -- her <br/>
hair started growing better after the cradle cap was gone.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
