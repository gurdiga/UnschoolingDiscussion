&gt; In his spare time he&#39;s a helicopter pilot, and he volunteers doing rescue <br/>
&gt; missions. He&#39;s apparently saved a couple lives. Can you imagine being <br/>
&gt; rescued by <br/>
&gt; Han Solo?<br/>

was raised his whole life thinking that his grandma was his mom, and his mom was <br/>
his sister.  Didn&#39;t find out till much later that he was his &quot;sister&#39;s&quot; <br/>
illegitimate son.<br/>
