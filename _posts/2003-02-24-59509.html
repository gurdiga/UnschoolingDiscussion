&lt;&lt; I&#39;m sure there was some damage to her self esteem, mostly<br/>
from other children. I remember one girl in particular saying to her &quot;you<br/>
can&#39;t be in my play, coz you have to read...&quot; :-(   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While Holly was still not reading she was in an acting class and was in a <br/>
play, all homeschoolers, run by the local city theatre.   <br/>
<br/>
In both instances, I read her lines to her, she learned them by ear and knew <br/>
them before she went back.  In the play, they were doing just a section at a <br/>
time and adding on.  She knew her whole part before they were halfway through <br/>
and by the time they performed, she knew EVERY part.<br/>
<br/>
In the other class, she would be the only one who knew her little script, and <br/>
so they would let her go first, and have her cue other kids who were <br/>
forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
I think her inability to read also kept her from being dependent on the <br/>
script or paper and so she could focus her attention on what the lines MEANT <br/>
and what her character was really trying to say.  <br/>

the point where I have trouble remembering exactly what I&#39;ve read because<br/>
it&#39;s so easy to just go look it up.  My later-reading son, however, has an<br/>
excellent memory for what he&#39;s heard and seen.<br/>
