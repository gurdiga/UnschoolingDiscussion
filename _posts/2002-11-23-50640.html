<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144340715">Hi, Folks<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m writing here because I feel a kinship with the ideas that have been <br/>
expressed on this list and I feel that I can get some good perspective from <br/>
people who participate here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a stay-at-home, work-at-home, unschooling mom of an 8-year-old boy <br/>
(he&#39;ll be 8 in just a few weeks).  We live in a rural community and my son <br/>
does not have a whole lot of friends but he really craves other kids.  He <br/>
just loves to play and has a wild, extremely creative imagination.  Playing <br/>
is all he wants to do, and that&#39;s just fine with me because that&#39;s what he <br/>
wants to do.  The tricky part is 1) finding other kids for him to play <br/>
with, and 2) me.<br/>
<br/>
Me, because I&#39;m feeling REALLY depressed lately.  We are going through some <br/>
changes in the house, namely that my husband of 22-1/2 years and I are <br/>
rapidly moving apart, although we continue to live in the same house (we <br/>
can&#39;t afford not to).  DH doesn&#39;t sleep in our bedroom anymore.  We have <br/>
had a family bed since my son was born, and although my son has tried, he <br/>
still does not wish to sleep alone.  It&#39;s been a few weeks since DH moved <br/>
to a different bedroom.  Our son has slept in DH&#39;s bedroom a couple of <br/>
times, but mostly wants to sleep with me.  DH works a lot and has very <br/>
little time to spend with our son.<br/>
<br/>
In the course of a week, I probably have maybe an hour to myself, if <br/>
that.  Sometimes two or three hours, but sometimes just as I get back home <br/>
from driving my son to one of his friend&#39;s house, within a half an hour or <br/>
so, DH gets home from work and, I&#39;m not alone anymore.  Sometimes I feel as <br/>
though I&#39;m on the brink of going just crazy.  I want to run away.  I feel <br/>
that I can&#39;t do anything right, that I suck as a mom.  I second-guess <br/>
everything I do (which I realized earlier is a good thing to a point <br/>
because questioning things is a way to grow).   I have so little patience <br/>
and a much shorter fuse than I used to; I&#39;m tearful most of the time and I <br/>
feel little joy.  My life feels (and, I think, looks) chaotic and out of order.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my dilemma:  My son used to be in school and he absolutely HATED <br/>
it.  But, I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m the best person for him to be around.  As <br/>
I&#39;m writing this, I can see that I need to see someone for some counseling, <br/>
and I will set that up for myself this week.  But, what I am looking for <br/>
from the participants of this list is a perspective that takes unschooling <br/>
into consideration.  I think if he went back to school, it would only <br/>
compound the suffering he&#39;s probably already enduring (i.e., the changes in <br/>
our family and my unhappiness).<br/>
<br/>
I know this sounds like a big mess, and I&#39;m not sure I gave enough <br/>
information for anyone to answer me.  So, please ask questions if you need <br/>
to.  I should say that I feel that the big rift between DH and me was <br/>
caused by me and was his appropriate response to me.  Not that he has no <br/>
responsibility at all in this, but I feel that I precipitated this break up <br/>
in a passive-aggressive way (the story of my life).  I should also say that <br/>
DH and I plan to &quot;settle our affairs&quot; (clear up our debt), sell this house, <br/>
and then buy enough land so that we can build two homes on it, one for him <br/>
and one for me so that our son has us both around all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much for reading this and for any input you may have.<br/>

<br/>
Short-term counselling!  Monday!!<br/>
<br/>
There are hotlines online (phone numbers listed for different parts of the <br/>
country, if you go to google.com and put in depression suicide hotline, and <br/>
they&#39;ll have phone numbers of other places to call in your area.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t delay on that.  Every day is affecting your son and marriage too.  It&#39;s <br/>
not too late to turn it all back around.<br/>
<br/>
Can you go for a little drive with your son?  Can you do a daytrip to a <br/>
nearby town and see a museum or zoo or something?  Eat a happy lunch in a <br/>
pretty restaurant?<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t afford that, can you take the dog on a picnic?<br/>
<br/>
Changes of routine often stave off depression, or at least let you forget for <br/>
a little while.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find other homeschooling families to trade kids with sometimes <br/>
that will help your son&#39;s life be less tied just to you.  While you have <br/>
another kid or two over, he&#39;ll be happily distracted, and the trade off can <br/>
be some days when he&#39;s at the other house.<br/>

can see how this is affecting my son, and it is very upsetting, kind of <br/>
like I was sneezing in his face and giving him a cold, only worse.<br/>

perhaps I have to look harder.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  This is the challenge!  I think I need to look harder.  We do have a <br/>
homeschooling family (school-at-home) that we do exchanges with.  They have <br/>
two sons, one a year younger than my son and the other 3 years <br/>
younger.  The three of them play a lot together but they they see each <br/>
other so much that my son needs breaks from them, and that, of course, <br/>
leads us back to the original problem.  I admit that it&#39;s hard for me to <br/>
search out people when I&#39;m feeling so funky.  I really have to rise above.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your kid-compassionate, mom-compassionate answer.  I <br/>
really do appreciate it.<br/>

One suggestion for your son. Put up &quot;park-day&quot; flyers at the local health <br/>
food stores (there are more &quot;alternatives&quot; that hang out there) and the <br/>
libraries/co-ops/etc. Just BE there every Tuesday---or whatever--- and see <br/>

I&#39;m sorry you are depressed. That&#39;s an interesting arrangement you and your <br/>

good friends, and we both are crazy about that little guy.  Neither of us <br/>
can imagine putting our son in a situation where he would have to be torn <br/>
between us.  So, we plan to remain a family, just a slightly different <br/>
family.  It broke my heart to overhear a conversation my son had with a <br/>
friend of his recently:<br/>
<br/>
MY SON:  Do your parents kiss each other?<br/>
<br/>
FRIEND:  Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
MY SON:  So do mine, only very rarely.<br/>

him to be able to attend some kind of class or program like once a week? <br/>

My boys could have had that EXACT conversation several years ago. But the <br/>
&quot;very rarely&quot; would have been  &quot;NEVER&quot;. Our marriage was so on the rocks--I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even stand to have him in the same room.  Several folks here have <br/>
met us both, and I&#39;m sure they would never have guessed. He and I (the <br/>
aetheist) wound up (through a friend) at Retrovaille---a CATHOLIC church <br/>
troubled marriage encounter/counseling weekned. That was the breakthrough. It <br/>
hasn&#39;t been easy. But not only do I like him again, I actually LOVE him <br/>
again. <br/>
<br/>
I was severely depressed and blamed him for everything (I don&#39;t get suicidal <br/>
when depressed, but HOMOcidal!). It was an awful period---about three years. <br/>
Three miserable years. I&#39;m surprised all of us (any of us) survived.<br/>
<br/>
Get help asap! And if you want info on Retrovaille, let me know.<br/>

MJ,<br/>
I strongly recommend that you get a check up, see your doctor.  The last year and a half has been very hard for me, mostly because of the declining health of my mother and all the things in my life taking care of her has affected.  I began to cry daily.  I felt that my life was a chore.  I rarely had a good day.  <br/>
<br/>
Because my grandmother suffered from clinical depression when I was a teen, I knew I needed to see a doctor.  She put me on Celexa, which is for depression, about 4 months ago and it has made me *normal* again.  She says I will probably be on it for about 8 months, then will wean me off.  But I felt better w/i about 10 days to 2 weeks.  By 4 weeks I felt like myself again.  I can&#39;t say that Celexa is the right thing for you, but I know it&#39;s what brought me back.  And life is good again, no longer a chore.  Thank goodness I didn&#39;t break my leg before the Celexa!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097195948">Sometimes even when things seem like they could be the cause of troubles, <br/>
there can still be an underlying reason for depression. Getting checked is a <br/>
good idea along with counseling as well.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago I was feeling so edgy I wanted to kill someone. Birth <br/>
control pills was all I needed to find the old me. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t take <br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was on Celexa and it worked wonders for her. She was also taking <br/>
counseling as well. They had her on Celexa for a year and then weaned her <br/>
off. It just retrains the brain to release normal levels of seratonin and <br/>
gradually the brain picks up and takes care of it on it&#39;s own. My daughter <br/>
has been off of it now for about 3 months and is doing great.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks very much for this answer.  We have tried classes.  In fact, we do <br/>
take an art class together with the other homeschooling family.  The <br/>
instructor of this class is great because she respects my son&#39;s way of <br/>
doing things, which is that he plays while creating.  For him, the process <br/>
is the important thing and he doesn&#39;t care if he leaves with a product.  I <br/>
could be completely warped here, but I think it&#39;s great that he&#39;s more into <br/>
the process. And, the instructor is really cool because she makes offers to <br/>
show him things, but she doesn&#39;t insist and really lets him do his creative <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
We have tried other classes, but he&#39;s just not interested in <br/>
anything.  Mostly, he resents structure and control.  As we were going to <br/>
try out a new class he said to me, &quot;Mommy, I just don&#39;t want anyone to <br/>
control me.&quot;  For some things that I think he *may* be interested in, I ask <br/>
him to just try something and if he doesn&#39;t like it for any reason <br/>
whatsoever I let it go.  Our community center was offering a series <br/>
of  classes for homeschoolers, and we signed up for a couple of them, <br/>
mainly to meet other homeschoolers.  Unfortunately, they were a total <br/>
bust.  I liked one of the programs, but he couldn&#39;t have cared less, and <br/>
the few other families that did sign up just did not click with my <br/>
son.  Mostly, my son resented anyone telling him what to do, that it was <br/>
time to sit or stand or look at this or look at that.  Goodness, can you <br/>
even imagine a kid like that in school?!?<br/>
<br/>
What he needs is a recess class. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-477306056">I am so sorry you are in this situation.<br/>
<br/>
I can only really comment on your feeling like you aren&#39;t the best person for <br/>
your son to be with right now.  I&#39;m not sure it is possible to convince you <br/>
otherwise, but here goes.  Last year after September 11th, I was feeling like <br/>
I was the worst possible person to be around.  I wish I had gotten help.  <br/>
Instead I planted my kids at a &quot;mom&#39;s day out&quot; program at a local church to <br/>
prepare them for preschool.  I had decided that I was the last person who <br/>
should be with them and that they should just go to school as I was the worst <br/>
Mom possible.  My son, the tender hearted one, became very aggressive in the <br/>
church program.  He didn&#39;t actually bite anyone, he just hovered over a <br/>
grasped appendage threateningly with his mouth open.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had gotten help at the time.  I needed it.  My depression lasted a <br/>
lot longer than it needed to.  Please find some help to get yourself out of <br/>
this.  Your son needs you now more than ever with your marriage in a rocky <br/>
spot.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.  I wish you didn&#39;t have to go through this.<br/>

I know what you mean. My son is pretty much like that also. That and he gets <br/>
bored easily and also loves to be alone and create his own movies and games. <br/>
What I was fortunate to find was a Christian homeschooling association that <br/>
puts on a once a week sports camp for homeschoolers in the area. Now we <br/>
aren&#39;t Christian and although they have some BAG time, (being alone with <br/>
God) and start off with a prayer, we have no problem with this. All the <br/>
people are very nice and no one tries to recruit anyone. They go to two <br/>
parks a day all over our county and another one as well. They run it <br/>
professionally enough like a business, (insurance and counselors all <br/>
certified and fingerprinted) but genuinely love the kids. My son and <br/>
daughter wouldn&#39;t miss it for the world. That plus two park days a month and <br/>
weekly visits with friends and drop in park days are enough for my kids <br/>
right now. If only everyone could have someone like Coach Rick and such an <br/>
organization like his sports camp, it&#39;s great for the kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078467315">Dear MJ,<br/>
It sounds like alot of crap that you all have been going through. I too have <br/>
just come out of a 6-7 month long depressive episode. It was impossible for <br/>
me to make decisioms about ANYthing while in it. what to have for dinner, am <br/>
I unschooling well, should I stay married? All were equally difficult. The <br/>
first thing is to get out of the abyss. I hesitated going into therapy for <br/>
meds because I hate to use allopathy! But I was definately at the point where <br/>
if I didn&#39;t do something I was going to completely break down. I happened to <br/>
be doing some studying and found that a vitamin deficiency could be a <br/>
culpret. So I started taking the B&#39;s, C, and Calcium. Within two days, I felt <br/>
Mostly Normal. (That will be the title of my book one day) I suggest you talk <br/>
to or go see a Nutritionist along with the therapist. I think that I was not <br/>
taking care of myself, and was pretty malnourished. Who knows, that may be a <br/>
factor for you also.<br/>
I could not take care of anything else until I took care of me. Getting a <br/>
child up for school? HAH! Make some playdates for your son, insist that Dad <br/>
tkae care of his son also, he&#39;ll need to while you are in Therapy right? I <br/>
also recommend joint counseling for you both. Even if you don&#39;t continue the <br/>
marriage, there are TONS of issues associated with a break up that still need <br/>
to be addressed that will be easier to discuss while IN counseling, one <br/>
little one being building 2 houses! Yick. WHo knows, maybe it will enable the <br/>
two of you two get past the past and recover your commitment. Divorce and two <br/>
seperate houses won&#39;t change the fact that you are still a family and you <br/>
will be forever.<br/>
So basically, what I&#39;m saying is first get yourself feeling &quot;MostlyNormal&quot; <br/>
and THEN you can make your choices and decisions.<br/>
Love,<br/>

I think its great that your son can recognize this!!  My kids still can&#39;t put their finger on their feelings like that, and they are alot older than your son.  I think they and I have so much deschooling/decontrolling to get through.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Keep your head up and I&#39;m glad you have this group to turn to.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I went through depression times and they still come and go,  but I have to agree with others, talk to someone and sometimes meds can be helpful.  Even if you look at it as something that is short term.    Also, for me getting outside is huge!     And I havn&#39;t done that enough lately.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks very much for this answer.  We have tried classes.  In fact, we do <br/>
take an art class together with the other homeschooling family.  The <br/>
instructor of this class is great because she respects my son&#39;s way of <br/>
doing things, which is that he plays while creating.  For him, the process <br/>
is the important thing and he doesn&#39;t care if he leaves with a product.  I <br/>
could be completely warped here, but I think it&#39;s great that he&#39;s more into <br/>
the process. And, the instructor is really cool because she makes offers to <br/>
show him things, but she doesn&#39;t insist and really lets him do his creative <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
We have tried other classes, but he&#39;s just not interested in <br/>
anything.  Mostly, he resents structure and control.  As we were going to <br/>
try out a new class he said to me, &quot;Mommy, I just don&#39;t want anyone to <br/>
control me.&quot;  For some things that I think he *may* be interested in, I ask <br/>
him to just try something and if he doesn&#39;t like it for any reason <br/>
whatsoever I let it go.  Our community center was offering a series <br/>
of  classes for homeschoolers, and we signed up for a couple of them, <br/>
mainly to meet other homeschoolers.  Unfortunately, they were a total <br/>
bust.  I liked one of the programs, but he couldn&#39;t have cared less, and <br/>
the few other families that did sign up just did not click with my <br/>
son.  Mostly, my son resented anyone telling him what to do, that it was <br/>
time to sit or stand or look at this or look at that.  Goodness, can you <br/>
even imagine a kid like that in school?!?<br/>
<br/>
What he needs is a recess class. :-)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Our marriage was so on the rocks--I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even stand to have him in the same room.  Several folks here have <br/>
met us both, and I&#39;m sure they would never have guessed. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking &quot;WHAT!?  I nver would have guessed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I even looked back up to see who was writing that.<br/>
<br/>
Good job!<br/>
<br/>
As to parents kissing, I have a good story:   When I was seventeen I took my <br/>
new college roommate home to see my house.  It started with her having NO <br/>
CONCEPT of a house with no central heating.  I told her some of the rooms <br/>
(four of eight) had little freestanding gas heaters, and that was it, but <br/>
since it was adobe once it heated up it wasn&#39;t bad.   <br/>
<br/>
She was from St. Louis and her parents had two homes.  One was a modern <br/>
(60&#39;s; it was 1970), big, all-decked out house in a fancy neighborhood.  The <br/>
other was her grandmother&#39;s downtown house with leaded, cutglas windows, <br/>
fancy everything (turn of the century? 1880&#39;s?) and her mother was so rich <br/>
her father had never had to have a job EXCEPT... every single night he went <br/>
and slept at the downtown house to protect it from vandalism because of its <br/>
financial value.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, at my own ratty house, she was thrilled.   We went to the drive-in <br/>
movies in a pickup owned and driven by a Real Indian (Jon Tsosie, my best <br/>
friend at the time), and the horn had to be honked (if it had to be honked) <br/>
by putting a tableknife across the middle of the steering wheel to make <br/>
contact.   This, for the roommate from the East (she kept saying &quot;St. Louis <br/>
isn&#39;t in the East&quot; and we&#39;d laugh and razz her more about it being east of <br/>
New Mexico and even east of Oklahoma!) was the most fun she&#39;d had.  For us it <br/>
was cheap and easy.  We&#39;d&#39;ve gone to the drive in in that old truck anyway.  <br/>
What option?<br/>
<br/>
So back to the kissing.  We got back to Albuquerque, 90 miles south of the <br/>
exotic Espanola weekend, and she told all our dining hall friends how <br/>
WONDERFUL my house was, but especially she said &quot;Her parents KISSED each <br/>
other every time one of them left, and it was really sweet.  They&#39;re really <br/>
in love.  My parents never even sleep in the same house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thursday of that week I got my routine letter from home with a check for $5 <br/>
or $10 in it, and because it was SO routine, I left it on my tray to read <br/>
later.  I forgot and it went down the rollers and into the dishwater.   I <br/>
rushed back and asked for it, not caring about the letter but wanting the <br/>
check.<br/>
<br/>
It was wet and messy, but the check was still good and the letter said my <br/>
parents were getting a divorce and my mom had already started moving out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never written that down before.  I guess I&#39;ll save it for my diary.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Because my grandmother suffered from clinical depression when I was a <br/>
teen, I knew I needed to see a doctor.  She put me on Celexa, which is for <br/>
depression, about 4 months ago and it has made me *normal* again.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh!<br/>
Consider menopause as a factor.   And don&#39;t do drugs without conselling.  <br/>
Counselling can help you avoid a future incident.  Anti-depressants can <br/>
really help, because there&#39;s a physical aspect to severe depression.  But <br/>
that alone isn&#39;t going to teach you how your own attitudes and actions and <br/>
words can help you justify your depression and make your family needlessly <br/>
unhappy.<br/>

Hi, MJ --<br/>
<br/>
My son hasn&#39;t articulated it quite so clearly, but he never says yes to<br/>
offers of &quot;classes&quot;.  However, he loves park days, which are just like a<br/>
great big recess.  I hope that winter where you are will be mild and<br/>
brief, or at least mild-er and brief-er than usual.  (It could happen!)<br/>
<br/>
Mid-winter isn&#39;t very far away, and then they days will start getting<br/>
longer again.<br/>

They divorced after 20 years and later I found out that they had not<br/>
had sex for the last 5 years (not that I wanted to know this tidbit, but<br/>
both parents used me as a sounding board). Luckily they kept it amicable<br/>
