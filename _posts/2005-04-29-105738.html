Sometimes I envision my children as parents, and sometimes as   spouses.<br/>

Here&#39;s a switch in topics, and maybe that&#39;s not a bad thing...<br/>
 <br/>
I went to a concert with my son recently, at a club in Boston. (Bowling for  <br/>
Soup...REALLY fun!)  I learned a bunch of things. <br/>
 <br/>
First, I&#39;d assumed that when you bought a ticket to a concert in a club, it  <br/>
meant they gave you a seat. Apparently you just get a square of space on a <br/>
floor  where you can jump up and down. Luckily, there were not terribly in demand <br/>
seats  at the side, so I was quite comfortable.<br/>
 <br/>
On the way home, we were taking the subway back to the car. There was a  <br/>
group of girls who had also been at the concert, about Julian&#39;s age, maybe a  <br/>
little older. I suddenly realized that I was looking at them in a brand new  <br/>
way...  Each of these girls could be someone Julian loves someday. Yeah, I  know, <br/>
probably not these particular girls, but...  Seeing Julian as this  potential <br/>
partner or dad, and these girls as something more than a bunch of  teenagers on <br/>
the train...  wow!<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s getting OLD!  Or maybe I am....<br/>
