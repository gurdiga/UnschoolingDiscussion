<div id="ygrps-yiv-796828740">Does anyone know the recipe for making peanut brittle in the microwave?<br/>
My dd made it last year for gifts/holiday events.  It was SO extremely much<br/>
simpler than the stovetop way!  And no candy thermometer needed (we don&#39;t<br/>
own one.)<br/>
Also accepting ideas for gift jar type things....where you layer the<br/>
(dry)ingredients in a jar.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah,  I&#39;m looking for a recipe for bath salts.....I think it has epsom<br/>
salts,  baking soda, sea   salt(?),  and essential oils....? not sure if<br/>
this ingredient list is complete and NO idea on proportions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I got some of those jar recipes off of cookierecipe.com last year...the<br/>
oatmeal one in particular was delicious and very well received...<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
