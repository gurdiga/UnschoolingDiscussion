<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291479133">Interesting  item in today&#39;s New York Times, entitled &quot;Study Supports <br/>
Ritalin.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quotes:<br/>
&quot;In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted, researchers<br/>
             have found that the drug Ritalin, the subject of sharp debate <br/>
for three<br/>
          decades, was more effective than behavior-modification therapy in<br/>
          treating children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dr. James T. McCracken, the director of child and adolescent psychiatry<br/>
          at the Neuropyschiatric Institute of the University of California <br/>
at Los<br/>
          Angeles, who was not involved in the research, called the study a<br/>
          landmark and said it proved the benefits of treating hyperactive <br/>
children<br/>
          with a stimulant. &quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Amen, from one who has been both routes . . .   Our 11 year old was diagnosed <br/>
with mild ADD last year during her horrible 4th grade year in our highly <br/>
rated public school system.  We went the Ritalin route for 6 months.  My very <br/>
bright, creative child had every bit of self-confidence knocked out of her <br/>
last year and we were desperate to help her.  <br/>
<br/>
We are now &quot;handling&quot; these issues through home schooling with a liberal dose <br/>
of unschooling!  Emily is an immensely happier child now than she was last <br/>
year.  Yes, she has her moments when her behavior is a little out of control, <br/>
and yes, she sometimes has difficulty concentrating on paperwork for more <br/>
than 20 minutes.  But the beauty of all this, as you know, is that she no <br/>
longer has to conform to the standards imposed on kids in government schools. <br/>
 She went from being very angry at us for taking her out of school to <br/>
becoming the leading fan of home schooling.  <br/>
<br/>
You do what works for your child within your own framework of values and <br/>
philosphy.  When we were going through this last year we heard every opinion <br/>
in the book about Ritalin and tried to keep an open mind while tryng to help <br/>
our child.<br/>

You might find something about the ritalin study on the University of Auckland web<br/>
site www.auckland,ac.nz/ but the site doesn&#39;t agree with my elderly computer, so I<br/>
can&#39;t help you with that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527381239">I simply did a search for Auckland, went to the University and then did a<br/>
search.  They list 6111 studies and four sites with references to Ritalin<br/>
but none of them seem to be the right site.<br/>
