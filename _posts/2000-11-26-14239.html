What a great costume! Sir Alex is adorable as well. How did you make the <br/>
chainmaile? The whole costume looks very authentic. BTW, I think falling in <br/>
mud is very medieval as well; I always picture Medieval life as very muddy, <br/>
at least that is how it is pictured in books and movies! LOL Glad you had a <br/>
good time otherwise.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: Renaissance Festival - Update and pics of my little knight<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks to everyone for your help with my Renaissance questions.  If you all<br/>
&gt;remember, I didn&#39;t know whether or not ds should dress for it.  Well, we took<br/>
&gt;the complete costume and when we got there, ds wanted nothing to do with it.<br/>
&gt;LOL Once during the duelist shows, he wanted it on so we went to the truck<br/>
&gt;and put it on him.  They let us come in with the sword without a problem.  Ds<br/>
&gt;got up on the stage after the guys finished and had a duel with one of them.<br/>
&gt;Luckily, he wanted it off right after and dh took it back to the truck, cause<br/>
&gt;it started pouring down rain.  We were all soaked and ds fell in the mud.<br/>
&gt;All in all, we had a great time, but it was way too expensive to go twice.  I<br/>
&gt;wanted to share some pictures of my little knight with you all.  They were<br/>
&gt;taken just recently and not at the festival or I would have shared them<br/>
&gt;sooner.  I hope you enjoy them and thanks again for your help.<br/>

Making the maille was easier than I would have ever imagined, if not a bit <br/>
monotonous.  We bought the wire in 200 ft. lengths and used seven of them <br/>
total.  I used a drill and a steel rod and wrapped the wire into coils and <br/>
cut the links, one by one, and then attached them with pliers in the pattern <br/>
needed.  I improvised on the shirt with the sleeves (I wanted all the links <br/>
to run the same way), but it came out okay, I think.  I should have not <br/>
worried about the shoulder seams and the direction of the links, so I could <br/>
have tapered the arms, but it was my first try after all, so I&#39;m not too hard <br/>
on myself about that.  And yes, falling in mud is very medieval, but we <br/>
hadn&#39;t taken pictures yet, which is why I&#39;m thankful he didn&#39;t have it on.  I <br/>
can&#39;t get a stain out for the life of me!  MIL says &quot;just do this&quot;, but I say <br/>
&quot;may as well trash it&quot;.<br/>
