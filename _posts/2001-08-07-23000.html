The interesting thing about home schooling and unschooling is that it brings<br/>
together groups of people who have little or nothing in common except how<br/>
they choose to educate their children.  Certainly it is appropriate for you<br/>
to express your views in this forum or any other, but I find it necessary to<br/>
respond to your post because while I believe public education should be<br/>
reformed, we would never be able to agree as a nation on how that reform<br/>
should occur.  I certainly applaud any Administration&#39;s efforts to improve<br/>
the system and I also believe, that for many children and parents, the<br/>
return to the &quot;3rs&quot; approach is certainly better than the current invasive<br/>
approach.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how pre-natal definitions have anything to do with home<br/>
schooling or unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335410781">Unschooling is a way of life, therefore any subject is unschooling since any<br/>
subject is part of life.<br/>
<br/>
The discrimination in question is another one of setting certain standards<br/>
for the poor that don&#39;t apply to all.  If they want to define things, then<br/>
define them for ALL segments of society, not just the poor!<br/>
