<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986365372"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So, did I mess up?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re using &quot;I&quot; statements (I am tierd, I am grumpy, I am frustrated),<br/>
you&#39;re right.  You have the right to feel that way.  No one can take away<br/>
that right.  They can tell you that they didn&#39;t MEAN for you to feel that<br/>
way until the cows come home, but if you feel it, you do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always believed it&#39;s fair to give specific examples, too.  This is what<br/>
happened, that is what happened.  Just the facts, ma&#39;am.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s unfair is telling people &quot;you make me feel (blank)&quot; or &quot;you ALWAYS do<br/>
(blank)&quot;.  It&#39;s not true, and you know that, really.<br/>
<br/>
What happened today?  You lost it.  So?  Your kids saw a grown up lose it,<br/>
speak reasonably about why they&#39;re losing it, and behave like a grown up<br/>
should.  You didn&#39;t smack anybody around.  You didn&#39;t tell them they&#39;re<br/>
rotton horrible brats who never should have been born.  You didn&#39;t scream<br/>
and rant for hours, break things, get drunk, or any number of other idiotic<br/>
things people do when mad.<br/>
<br/>
In short, they saw a mature woman lose it, live through it, and pull herself<br/>
together again.  Sounds to me like you&#39;re doing pretty well, honestly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349368152">The one thing I&#39;m wondering about is the &quot;always&quot; part when you were talking <br/>
to your son. Don&#39;t remember the exact wording now but as in you always have <br/>
to then whatever it was. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not always and saying so makes the <br/>
kid kind of feel like he needs to live up to that expectation. Not a good <br/>
thing. I&#39;ve done it too. Just a wrong choice of words. Made my daugher feel <br/>
real bad. Felt awful afterwards myself. I certainly didn&#39;t mean &quot;always&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure most of us lose it from time to time, especially with younger kids <br/>
and more than a few. It&#39;s okay to have a meltdown and let them know. It&#39;s <br/>
the way we go about it that might come about better. I had a hard time <br/>
reading your post as in getting through it and I&#39;m wondering how the kids <br/>
felt listening to it all. Seems like some tension was there long before the <br/>
actual &quot;Let me tell you what&#39;s going on with me&quot; talk. I&#39;m wondering how <br/>
much of it all they really listened to. When I feel like that, I walk away <br/>
before the tone comes out and before the voice starts to get louder. Then I <br/>
come back when I&#39;m easier to be around. Why would my kids want me to be <br/>
around and listen when I&#39;m like that?  Going off to Walmart isn&#39;t that <br/>
important that it couldn&#39;t wait a few minutes to straighten feelings out. <br/>
Then everyone leaves on a good not in the car. The car can be such a nice <br/>
place for all to be, why make it stressed? Everyone is pretty much a captive <br/>
audience anyway, make it so they want to be there!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That needs repeating! It&#39;s really important in getting to that new way of<br/>
seeing things: ownership of feelings. No one came make us feel something.<br/>
Even if someone calls us nasty names, we&#39;re hearing the words and choosing<br/>
to believe what they think of us is important.<br/>
