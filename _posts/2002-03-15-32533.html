<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220565341">Denise -- as Lynda, Kara, and Tia said today -- the<br/>
GED study guides are available in regular bookstores. <br/>
Seems like we got ours at Waldenbooks.  There were<br/>
four different companies publishing the<br/>
Sears-catalog-sized version last time I noticed,<br/>
priced between ten and twenty dollars.  Using them and<br/>
the PBS GED programs (30 minutes each, a series on<br/>
each major subject area) you can cover everything<br/>
required on the tests.  PBS stations also made<br/>
available the set of GED workbooks for about $25, but<br/>
we didn&#39;t use those.  Local high schools and community<br/>
colleges -- many facilities that offers adult<br/>
education -- often provide pre-testing to check<br/>
readiness for the GED, as well as classes which help<br/>
you catch up on shaky areas.  You can take all or one<br/>
or any of the subjects.  The high school in the town<br/>
we came from last year offered these free of charge<br/>
for anyone eighteen or older. My first daughter wanted<br/>
her GED, to show on paper she had learned something,<br/>
and of course it is easier to find work and enter<br/>
college with a high school or equivalent certificate.<br/>
The GED book was very thorough, and she didn&#39;t have to<br/>
spend much time with it.  She started working at age<br/>
16, did a lot of reading and letter-writing, sewing,<br/>
brief classes and various community activities. I<br/>
taped the PBS programs for her while she was at work<br/>
and she watched them when she had time. She pre-tested<br/>
to feel confident she was ready and soon after her<br/>
18th birthday took her GED test, passing with a pretty<br/>
good score the first time.  The test is in something<br/>
like five sections.  If you don&#39;t pass them all you<br/>
can retake the sections you need.  At that time, there<br/>
was no limit on how many times you could take each<br/>
section.  The community college she attended gave a<br/>
scholarship for the higher GED scores.  <br/>
