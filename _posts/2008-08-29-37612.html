Perhaps those of you living in Europe will do better than I!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

I did great when I had the red dots for reference, also pretty good when I still had country borders to refer to, but when all borders were removed and it was just land mass, not so good (unless I REALLY knew where it was - like cities in the UK and nearby countries). It&#39;s interesting how much I rely on those visual clues when &#39;mapping&#39; a place in my head. I now want to practice mapping without borders - it&#39;s challenging &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
Dh just came by and read my post. He pointed out, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s the way you drive and give directions. Using landmarks to visually mark the way. Like take a left at the Jack In The Box, etc.&quot; I guess that&#39;s just one more confirmation of my visual style!<br/>
Love the game, btw. Thanks for posting it!<br/>

Why not go out on a limb? Isn�t that where the fruit is?<br/>
