I can relate.  I like rules, too.  They make me feel in control.  Hang<br/>
around here too long, though, and you start understanding that the whole<br/>
point is giving your kids control.  Many of my rules are gone these days.  I<br/>
miss a couple of them, but we&#39;re much better off.<br/>
<br/>
If you want your children to choose stuff other than TV, offer other good<br/>
options.  Take trips, get out the craft supplies, see if anybody will play a<br/>
game with you.  But also expect that children need down time, too.  My son<br/>
prefers not to watch TV, but there are days I&#39;d love to throw the gameboy<br/>
out (even though it&#39;s wonderful for so many other reasons...).  But some<br/>
days he wants nothing more than that.  Gotta be a reason for it.  My child<br/>
makes sense in other areas, so I have to trust him in this one.<br/>
