<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332241631">Medical Fact: Babies born to mothers who smoke are usually underweight and sometimes fail to thrive. They are also more likely to contract upper respiratory diseases and allergies. The latter also applies to children who are exposed to second hand smoke. Also you better believe that the tar and nicotene are in mother&#39;s milk if she smokes. Nicotene is a depresant which may account for the baby seeming slow.<br/>

breastfeeding, not pregnancy, but my point was the<br/>

alcohol have an affect on breastmilk, then youb et<br/>
smoking does. Just thought I&#39;d clarify that I&#39;m not an<br/>

<br/>
My mom&#39;s a practicing alcoholic.  She took a nine-year break a few years <br/>
back.  It was nice.  Of three offspring, I am not alcoholic (or the more <br/>
general &quot;substance dependent&quot;), my sister is (and so abstains) and my <br/>
half-brother (who had two alcoholic parents, not just one as my sister and I <br/>
did) is BIGTIME dependent.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s FAS (fetal alcohol syndrome) too, but those aren&#39;t the same thing.  One <br/>
(according to current belief) is from too much alcohol while in development, <br/>
and the other (the alcoholism) is genetic and would have happened even with a <br/>
surrogate-pregnancy or even if my mom had been abstaining from alcohol <br/>
entirely during the pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad for my kids not to be around tobacco and alcohol as so many other <br/>
kids are (and even more were, in the past).  We own some alcohol, but it&#39;s <br/>
not touched over once or twice a month, if that, and then it&#39;s light.  The <br/>
bottles are dusty.  Good for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
As to smoking dope while nursing and the baby seeming slow, that too might be <br/>
plain old genetics.  Not everyone&#39;s zippy and bright-eyed.  Then again, some <br/>
zippy and bright-eyed people don&#39;t make much of their lives, and some who <br/>
seem slow are actually full of thought and ability, it just doesn&#39;t have the <br/>
same outside manifestation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-73790704">There is no medical evidence to support this theory, in fact, there have<br/>
been several studies to the contrary.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A study described in Pediatrics 1994; 93:254-260, (Dreher MC, Nugent K and<br/>
Hudgins R) compared the babies of Rastafarian mothers (smoking up to 5<br/>
joints a day) and non-smoking controls. Both groups of mothers were<br/>
breastfeeding. After one month, the babies of the heavily smoking mothers<br/>
scored better on the developmental testing done. The speculation was that<br/>
the Rastafarian mothers had better social networking and support for being<br/>
new mothers.<br/>
All this evidence goes against the mainstream belief that marijuana is bad.<br/>
-Nikki Lee RN, MSN<br/>
<br/>
And from Merck, Section 22, Chapter 247:  &quot;No conclusive evidence that<br/>
marijuana causes birth defects or interferes with fetal growth and<br/>
development has been found. However, studies suggest that heavy use of<br/>
marijuana during pregnancy may lead to abnormal behavior in newborns.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are dozens of references on the net and the majority state that there<br/>
is no conclusive evidence.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, one study goes on to state that the reason there is no conclusive<br/>
evidence against weed is that almost all of the mothers who smoked weed and<br/>
who had babies with neurological problems, low birth weights, etc., also<br/>
smoked cigerettes, drank or did other drugs.  The general concensus is that<br/>
the babies would have had the same problems even if the mother had given up<br/>
the weed because the damage would have been done by the bad habits they had.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please pardon the Biblical reference - I do not mean to offend:<br/>
<br/>
An M.D. at an integrative clinic explained to me that the &quot;sins of the mother and father to the third and fourth generation&quot; can be interpreted from a health perspective.  In other words, there is a genotypic influence on health.  Why some individuals or families seem to secumb to the slightest assault of bacteria, virus, pollen, toxin, etc may have much to do with the cumulative effect generationally.  This does not mean that we are doomed by these genes, as much can be done to alter the phenotypic expression of the genes (a person genotypically destined to high blood pressure, for instance, can, by change of diet and lifestyle, phenotypically express health devoid of high blood pressure).  We can see this healing in the list members who report great success in treating their depression, allergies, or dc&#39;s autism with encouraging and often astounding result.<br/>
<br/>
The experiment with Dr. Pottenger&#39;s cats began with healthy cats and altered the diet, with one subset of this group becoming infertile by the fourth generation.  <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, the physician referenced above first asks each patient what their spiritual/religious beliefs are, if any, before treating them.  The mind-body connection portion of the treatment is then tailored in such a way as to obtain optimal result for each individual patient.  What this physician&#39;s individual belief system is, I do not know, but I have benefited from his healing touch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981428815">Oh, let me clarify this real quick. I didn&#39;t intend to<br/>
say WEED was what was bad, but was mainly referring to<br/>
smoking cigarettes. (And other things that should not<br/>
be smoked while with child...or ever really, in my<br/>
opinion....)<br/>
But all the people I&#39;ve known who smoked cigs while<br/>
pregnant or breastfeeding were also smoking weed, so I<br/>
mentioned it too, as that was what was being asked<br/>
about. <br/>
Actually &quot;dope&quot; was the term used, so that covers a<br/>
much broader spectrum for me. <br/>
I forget that when most people say that they really<br/>
just mean marijuana. :)<br/>
That&#39;s what I get for having people float in and out<br/>
of my life always that have detailed meanings on<br/>
several different levels of what could be considered<br/>
&quot;dope&quot; to be smoked. <br/>
I don&#39;t know about the kids being &quot;slow...&quot; cuz of<br/>
their breastfeeding mom smoking weed. <br/>
I think it really does depend on the genetics... <br/>
not to say that they would genetically be inclined to<br/>
be &quot;slow&quot; or something without the weed, but the<br/>
genetics of how their mom, family, etc, is affected<br/>
personally by smoking weed. <br/>
Example: I know some people who smoke a hella heap of<br/>
weed and are not in the least the typical &quot;stoned&quot;<br/>
picture of a person, with no short term memory<br/>
whatsoever. Actually are all the more intelligent and<br/>
openminded for it. <br/>
But then I know some people who smoke weed and I can&#39;t<br/>
handle trying to talk to them cuz it is like a mini<br/>
groundhog day episode. The same paragraph of words<br/>
over and over again. Always as though it&#39;s a new<br/>
experience for them. <br/>
It&#39;s all about the tolerance, says I.<br/>
I also think that using rastafarian moms as an example<br/>
is both good and bad, cuz DUH of course their babies<br/>
were scoring high, regardless of weed, diet, race,<br/>
genetics, whatever... they were being raised in a very<br/>
conscious, very loving, open, supportive enviroment. <br/>
But unfortunately those are not the people that are<br/>
usually being referred to when someone talks about<br/>
smoking weed. Sadly, alot of the time, it is young<br/>
mothers (or young at heart anyway), with little or no<br/>
support, who are depressed, or looked down upon for<br/>
one reason or another, who don&#39;t have the education<br/>
(not &quot;schooling&quot; mind you.) to be able to be those<br/>
intelligent open minded types, who smoke weed when<br/>
they &quot;party&quot; and drink, and have a cig to go along<br/>
with it. I think those are the ones that we usually<br/>
refer to. I&#39;ve never heard anyone say &quot;yeah she&#39;s a<br/>
great mom, she&#39;s got that whole rastafarian thing goin<br/>
on. great support system. kid&#39;s so open minded and<br/>
loving. really really smart. too bad she smokes dope<br/>
around it though, even while she&#39;s breastfeeding. that<br/>
can&#39;t be helping.&quot;<br/>
Just a thought. I&#39;m rambly tonight, people, no one<br/>
take me serious enough to be offended, please. <br/>
When I spoke of my ex&#39;s mom and dad I meant they<br/>
smoked cigs, CRACK, what have you. <br/>
Gave him whiskey in his bottle instead of milk, etc.<br/>
So I wasn&#39;t talking about them smoking weed, I was<br/>
talking about &quot;drug use&quot; in general. <br/>
And the study in the book I mentioned was about<br/>
smoking tabacco. <br/>
Just wanted to clear that up. :)<br/>
I was the one who posted weed as a help for arthritis<br/>
pain. <br/>
I only think that whatever the substance is, it<br/>
depends on how it affects you PERSONALLY and the<br/>
addictive capacity for you and your potential person<br/>
in utero. <br/>
Let&#39;s say some people react badly to orange juice. <br/>
To those people I suggest laying off the OJ. ;)<br/>
I think balance is in order for anything. <br/>
Sometimes too much of a good thing.....<br/>

&gt; All this evidence goes against the mainstream belief<br/>
&gt; that marijuana is bad.<br/>
&gt; -Nikki Lee RN, MSN<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And from Merck, Section 22, Chapter 247:  &quot;No<br/>
&gt; conclusive evidence that<br/>
&gt; marijuana causes birth defects or interferes with<br/>
&gt; fetal growth and<br/>
&gt; development has been found. However, studies suggest<br/>
&gt; that heavy use of<br/>
&gt; marijuana during pregnancy may lead to abnormal<br/>
&gt; behavior in newborns.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are dozens of references on the net and the<br/>
&gt; majority state that there<br/>
&gt; is no conclusive evidence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In fact, one study goes on to state that the reason<br/>
&gt; there is no conclusive<br/>
&gt; evidence against weed is that almost all of the<br/>
&gt; mothers who smoked weed and<br/>
&gt; who had babies with neurological problems, low birth<br/>
&gt; weights, etc., also<br/>
&gt; smoked cigerettes, drank or did other drugs.  The<br/>
&gt; general concensus is that<br/>
&gt; the babies would have had the same problems even if<br/>
&gt; the mother had given up<br/>
&gt; the weed because the damage would have been done by<br/>
&gt; the bad habits they had.<br/>
