<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763848698">I wrote an intro recently...4 kids 8 yrs down to 1 yr. and they have <br/>
never been to school.  I had been using different curr. but decided I <br/>
really like the idea of unschooling.  I let the girls pick out many, <br/>
many books from the library recently to learn what THEY want to <br/>
learn.  That&#39;s going ok although my 8 y.o. dd is asking why she has <br/>
to read.  Hmm.  I told her that&#39;s a great way to learn things but she <br/>
claims she doesn&#39;t like to read; this coming from a child that took <br/>
over reading the Magic Tree House series on her own when I ran out of <br/>
time to read one aloud.  Just this past summer she&#39;s been reading <br/>
like crazy.  Perhaps the science books on the solar system (her huge <br/>
interest) she&#39;s checked out are too hard for her and she&#39;s not <br/>
getting out of it what she would like?  I figured she&#39;d read what she <br/>
could and skip what she couldn&#39;t.  When my 6 y.o. dd wants me to read <br/>
some of her Ancient Egypt books we get them out and read.  What is <br/>
bugging me, though, is their desire to watch cartoons, staring <br/>
blankly at the tv.  Perhaps I am the one who needs some deschooling <br/>
but I find myself encouraging other activities, i.e. using the <br/>
computer.  Is that fair?  I was thinking about writing down the <br/>
channels of, say, the History channel, Discovery channel, Animal <br/>
Planet, and encourage those.  They watch by far more tv than I do.<br/>
<br/>
Now some days they are playing together really well, getting out the <br/>
interactive globe to play, playing a board game, do puzzles or <br/>
drawing.  They all still like to play with play doh so that is out <br/>
once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I need a good book to give me direction or maybe a way to <br/>
deschool myself.  Any ideas out there?  I love the idea of letting <br/>
the child lead their own learning but I&#39;m having to sit on my hands!  <br/>
There is so much I want them to know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992110223">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;That&#39;s going ok although my 8 y.o. dd is asking why she has <br/>
to read.  Hmm.  I told her that&#39;s a great way to learn things but she <br/>
claims she doesn&#39;t like to read;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The answer from an Unschooling point of view is &quot;you *don&#39;t* have to read<br/>
anything unless you want to.&quot; Stop pushing reading if you want her to come<br/>
back to it on her own terms. She evidently knows *how* perfectly well. It<br/>
sounds like she wants now to explore other ways of learning and being.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When my 6 y.o. dd wants me to read <br/>
some of her Ancient Egypt books we get them out and read.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would urge you not to get into a habit of comparing your children or their<br/>
activities, even in your mind. They can sense differences in approval and<br/>
disapproval even when it is not voiced.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  What is bugging me, though, is their desire to watch cartoons,<br/>
staring blankly at the tv.  Perhaps I am the one who needs some deschooling <br/>
but I find myself encouraging other activities, i.e. using the <br/>
computer.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While ever you keep restricting, disapproving and judging what they are<br/>
doing as &quot;blankly staring&quot;, they will stay in the &quot;famine reaction&quot; mode<br/>
that looks like zoning into the tv. The more you leave it alone, the faster<br/>
it will pass. Their eyes may be staring, but their minds are not really<br/>
stopping, even if what they are doing is silent consolidation.<br/>
<br/>
Every time you say something that is redirecting, you are lengthening your<br/>
and their journey to genuine trusting Unschooling with joy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is that fair?  I was thinking about writing down the <br/>
channels of, say, the History channel, Discovery channel, Animal <br/>
Planet, and encourage those.  They watch by far more tv than I do.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is still dividing life into the educational, and the non-educational<br/>
and therefore less worthy.<br/>
<br/>
No-one can be &quot;working&quot; all the time. Mainstream culture promotes an<br/>
expectation that kids shouldn&#39;t get to relax and zone out, that every thing<br/>
they do must be educational (or physically active) some how. It is ironic<br/>
that by giving our kids the freedom to appear to be doing nothing, they end<br/>
up truly learning all the time. How wonderful that what Unschoolers are<br/>
learning is the heart and soul warming, &quot;My parents always trust me to make<br/>
my own choices.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Now some days they are playing together really well, getting out the <br/>
interactive globe to play, playing a board game, do puzzles or <br/>
drawing.  They all still like to play with play doh so that is out <br/>
once in a while.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously you are still finding comfort in activities that mimic schoolish<br/>
ones, regardless of how connected or disconnected to their interests and<br/>
passions these may be. If you are giving lots of approval to the schoolish<br/>
appearing games, you may be devaluing their other choices. One result could<br/>
be to make the children feel wrong or vaguely guilty about their &quot;trivial&quot;<br/>
interests; another could be to create secrets between parent and child.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to save judgmental or guiding attitudes for places where it is<br/>
more important, like how they may treat each other or deal with conflict<br/>
between themselves.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I guess I need a good book to give me direction or maybe a way to <br/>
deschool myself.  Any ideas out there?  I love the idea of letting <br/>
the child lead their own learning but I&#39;m having to sit on my hands! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Utilize that energy with following your own learning interests. One of the<br/>
best places to read is www.sandradodd.com/unschooling . She has a section on<br/>
deschooling, as well as a lovely essay about ways of seeing and staying in<br/>
the moment. Another place is Danielle Conger&#39;s website and blog:<br/>
www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;There is so much I want them to know!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keep your passions! But accept that they are *your* passions. Share your<br/>
enjoyment, without expectations. You might get something from exploring the<br/>
idea of &quot;detachment&quot; - an emotional state of acceptance of how others are,<br/>
without regretting how they are not. It is not taking a rejection of some<br/>
offered idea of yours, as a personal rejection of you. <br/>
<br/>
If we are doing this partly to give our children the best chance they have<br/>
of being assertive, courageous, self-aware and thoughtful people, sometimes<br/>
they are going to disagree with our notions of what is important or<br/>
interesting. Mindfully accepting that their interests are equally compelling<br/>
*to them* becomes translated as deeply accepting Who They Are -<br/>
unconditional love expressed in action.<br/>

Relax, pretend it&#39;s &#39;summer vacation&#39; (even if it&#39;s snowing outside ;&#39;) <br/>
and just have some fun.  Allow your children to deschool from <br/>
school-at-home, too.  Start saying &quot;yes&quot; more and just BE with them.  <br/>
Have you sat down to watch some &#39;toons with your children?  There are <br/>
some on Cartoon Network that I just love (and didn&#39;t expect to!) -- <br/>
Power Puff Girls, Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, and Foster&#39;s Home <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-276572438">Wow!  Thank you so much for this post.  I&#39;ve been doing it wrong all <br/>
along!  You&#39;ve really opened my eyes and I guess I need to relax, huh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read some of Sandra Dodd&#39;s site but I need to go back there.<br/>
<br/>
There is one thing I&#39;m confused about.  Is it NOT an unschooling idea <br/>
to let them follow their interests, like with my 8 y.o.?  She loves <br/>
anything about planets and the solar system.  We&#39;ve put glow-in-the-<br/>
dark constellations on her ceiling, hung the planets on the ceiling <br/>
and I thought her wanting to pick out books at the library was the <br/>
right thing to do.  Same for my 6 y.o.  I&#39;ve read some about Ancient <br/>
Egypt to my now 8 y.o. and the 6 y.o. wanted to hear more about <br/>
this.  I don&#39;t want to say No.  And what did you mean about this and <br/>
comparing the kids or their activities?  I just want to get this all <br/>
figured out!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again!  I&#39;ve got my work cut out for me to change my whole <br/>
way of thinking :-)  And I really appreciate all the ideas you all <br/>
have given me.<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Julie --<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe what you first posted about library book selection was <br/>
ambiguous and may have been misunderstood.  Without going back and <br/>
getting the exact quote, I got the impression that you tell them to get <br/>
books on the topics that they want to learn about.  That makes it <br/>
unclear what would happen if a kid wasn&#39;t interested in learning that <br/>
week and just wanted to check out mentally undemanding books or <br/>
magazines, or if they didn&#39;t want to check out anything.  (And I suppose <br/>
a kid who checked out Teen People would learn about Hillary Duff&#39;s love <br/>
live, and a kid checking out Nintendo Power would learn about cheat <br/>
codes and new releases.  I was going to use these as examples of &quot;wasn&#39;t <br/>
interested in learning&quot;, but I realized learning would still occur.  <br/>
Just not learning that fits into a standard curriculum.)<br/>
<br/>
I have a homeschooling friend who limits her kids to two fiction books <br/>
at the library, and insists that they also check out two nonfiction <br/>
books.  This kind of quota system is unlikely to be practiced by someone <br/>
who is really into unschooling.  This isn&#39;t necessarily what you intend <br/>
to do, but it is one of the things that popped into my mind as I was <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Some styles of learning will find a TV program about spiders or <br/>
Egypt more intriguing than a book.  I accept this, even though it <br/>
puzzles me.  I love the beautiful illustrations in Ancient History <br/>
books, and I keep buying them even though my son is uninterested.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088014240">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Have you sat down to watch some &#39;toons with your children?  There are <br/>
some on Cartoon Network that I just love (and didn&#39;t expect to!) -- <br/>
Power Puff Girls, Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, and Foster&#39;s Home <br/>
for Imaginary Friends -- they crack me up!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was equally astonished to find that I love Kim Possible and, of all<br/>
things, Recess, both on Disney. I like those other shows too, but Jayn<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to dig the animation style much. Our hands down favorite,<br/>
(&quot;When is it Saturday, Mom?&quot;) is Winx Club on Fox. (Fox Box Saturday am) We<br/>
have all the dolls too. Finally a little voices doll game that I actually<br/>
enjoy playing with Jayn!<br/>
<br/>
Jayn gets a lot out of the filler segments on the Disney Channel (not Toon<br/>
Disney) which are along the lines of public service announcements. Kids<br/>
following their passions, Kids express themselves, and Kids and their pets.<br/>
She has become very interested in one little girl (somewhere between 9 and<br/>
11 yo I&#39;d guess) who volunteers at a wild animal rescue place with many<br/>
exotic creatures. <br/>
<br/>
There are no ordinary product commercials on the Disney Channel so they fill<br/>
the gaps and ad spaces with music videos, promotions for other programming<br/>
or Disney specific movies and attractions, and these public service<br/>
announcements. We got very excited during one of the stars&#39; &quot;stay in school&quot;<br/>
type of segments to hear that the best friend from &quot;Phil of the Future&quot; is<br/>
home schooled. Jayn hollers &quot;there&#39;s the home schooled girl&quot; every time she<br/>
sees her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779148108">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;There is one thing I&#39;m confused about.  Is it NOT an unschooling idea <br/>
to let them follow their interests, like with my 8 y.o.?  She loves <br/>
anything about planets and the solar system.  We&#39;ve put glow-in-the-<br/>
dark constellations on her ceiling, hung the planets on the ceiling <br/>
and I thought her wanting to pick out books at the library was the <br/>
right thing to do.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is totally one of the foundations of unschooling that *they* follow their<br/>
interests, and we facilitate them. You did your job by taking them to the<br/>
library and helping her carry any books she chose to the car, and putting<br/>
the stars up. Now it is up to her to look at the stars on the ceiling and<br/>
the night sky when she wants to, and up to her to choose to read the books<br/>
or not. Other ways to continue to facilitate that particular interest is to<br/>
*casually* give her a brochure to the local planetarium, mention a website<br/>
that you come across, keep an eye out for new items about imminent meteor<br/>
showers or eclipses. It is still *her* interest. <br/>
<br/>
Nor should she be defined in terms of one overweening passion all the time.<br/>
Sometimes it is tough to look at the totality of a person, if they are seen<br/>
as the one who is interested in ...... We try not to set up a situation<br/>
where the parent is crushed if/when the child moves on to some other<br/>
interest, or that the child feels guilty at abandoning some project or<br/>
concern that has become irrelevant to them. Continuing with an interest just<br/>
to keep Mom happy is not Unschooling with joy. (Not saying this is happening<br/>
at your house, Julie - just offering a general caution).<br/>
<br/>
Many people, when first coming to Unschooling, go overboard and sort of<br/>
&quot;take over&quot; the organization and pace of exploring an interest - with the<br/>
best of intentions - and end up trying to make it more like a unit study.<br/>
Children who have fully decompressed from schoolishness, or have been long<br/>
time Unschoolers, have been known to tell their mother to &quot;Chill, Mom&quot;. It<br/>
has made for some funny stories on the list when Mom realizes what she has<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
However, the unfunny consequence can be that the kids become wary of<br/>
mentioning a new fascination in case it turns into another major undertaking<br/>
with undesired cross country field trips. (Don&#39;t take this to mean that I<br/>
don&#39;t approve of cross country field trips when they are wanted and endorsed<br/>
by everyone concerned!) It is kind of like the Mom hi-jacks the kid&#39;s<br/>
interest, in desperation to force Unschooling into looking like the<br/>
schoolish mode of the dominant ideology.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Same for my 6 y.o.  I&#39;ve read some about Ancient <br/>
Egypt to my now 8 y.o. and the 6 y.o. wanted to hear more about <br/>
this.  I don&#39;t want to say No.  And what did you mean about this and <br/>
comparing the kids or their activities?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Paraphrasing your first post, I was responding to the idea that you were<br/>
disappointed that your 8yo didn&#39;t want to read (sadness and confusion), when<br/>
your 6yo did ask you to read to her often (yippee!). It was never to suggest<br/>
that you should not read to anyone who asks you to. Ancient Egypt and<br/>
Astronomy are certainly equally worthy interests! <br/>
<br/>
Do you see what I mean by the tacit approval for the *way* your younger<br/>
child was choosing to learn, versus your sorrow at the current rejection of<br/>
a skill you value in the elder? If the underlying attitude is informing any<br/>
of your interactions, it doesn&#39;t have to be as blatant as actually saying,<br/>
&quot;See, your little sister wants to read, why don&#39;t you&quot; to be felt as<br/>
criticism and disapproval.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Thank you again!  I&#39;ve got my work cut out for me to change my whole <br/>
way of thinking :-)  And I really appreciate all the ideas you all <br/>
have given me.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Glad to have you here. Keep going with this open questioning attitude; it is<br/>
wonderful to have opportunities to answer questions - they help me with my<br/>
journey.<br/>

Yes, I let them pick out books they are interested in and any other <br/>
books they wish.  I will read aloud if the 8 y.o. wants me to but <br/>
lately she has been reading alot to herself.  I always read aloud to <br/>
the 6 y.o.  We never come out of the library empty-handed :-)<br/>
Does that clear things up?<br/>

I see what you&#39;re saying now.  I think my 8 y.o. has had enough of <br/>
the solar system for now, that&#39;s my impression.  And I don&#39;t make her <br/>
read it either.  She reads what she wants, when she wants.  She <br/>
recently finished the Magic Tree House series (in order, of course!) <br/>
and is finishing up the Junie B. Jones series.<br/>
Just to let you know, my girls are in scouts and Badge Presentation <br/>
is next week.  I asked if they&#39;d like to work on some badges this <br/>
coming week and they were all excited about that.  Looks like we&#39;re <br/>
on to something new!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going over-board following their interests.  Katie <br/>
says she&#39;s had enough of solar system for now.  That happens to be an <br/>
interest of mine also but if she&#39;s had enough, we&#39;re done!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Robyn!<br/>

want. But with me, they don&#39;t (ususally, I ain&#39;t perfect) have to <br/>
whine!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s come a looong way this year, so I know there&#39;s hope, but it&#39;s <br/>
frustrating in the moment(s).<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure what my point is other than to say that feeling <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of all the many wonderful comments that have been written on this <br/>
thread, this comment resonated with me.  I wonder if many parents <br/>
see unschooling as a personal journey?  I do.  I suppose because <br/>
unschooling demands that we not bend to societal expectations; it <br/>
means learning to trust ourselves in trusting our children; it means <br/>
learning to not separate life into compartments, i.e., reading about <br/>
the indigenous life of the Galapagos Islands is &quot;educational&quot; but <br/>
watching &quot;Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy&quot; is not &quot;educational.&quot;  <br/>
And when you stop looking at life that way, life looks different.<br/>

inspiration rather than direction that you&#39;ll get from a good book. :)<br/>
<br/>
I recommend &quot;Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves,&quot; by<br/>
Alison McKee. That&#39;s where I first encountered the term unschooling,<br/>
and the name John Holt. I found it wonderful and exciting and learned<br/>
that &quot;homeschool&quot; can be what we&#39;re already doing with our eight-month<br/>
old son (now nine-month old -- a life of learning and exploration and<br/>
adventure. And the way mt husband & I live our lives already.<br/>
Thatnever, ever has to change. It&#39;s so liberating!<br/>

 I wonder if many parents <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; see unschooling as a personal journey? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been noticing that it&#39;s making me more honest with myself. It <br/>
took a while for me to let go of bedtime controls for ds for a number <br/>
of reasons, but when I really really thought openly and honestly <br/>
about it, I saw that one of my reasons was no longer relevant and one <br/>
wasn&#39;t yet a problem. Yes, in a couple months, when I&#39;m really pg, it <br/>
will get hard to carry a 4 yr old up the stairs, but I can do it now. <br/>
(And when it&#39;s a problem, he&#39;ll probably be more willing to consider <br/>
going upstairs before going to sleep because I&#39;ve been respecting his <br/>
desires.)<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of &quot;reasons&quot; people have for controling their kids <br/>
don&#39;t stand up to the light very well and it ends up being &quot;because I <br/>
said so&quot; more than any real problem.<br/>
