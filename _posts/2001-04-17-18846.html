<div id="ygrps-yiv-831181797">I grew up in a largely Methodist home, and our traditions included the<br/>
dyeing of Easter Eggs (my sister and I had a personal tradition wherein we<br/>
dyed the last egg in every color of dye, coming out something like<br/>
olive-drab in color), an easter bread - usually a braided bread - that my<br/>
mom baked, and the ever-present Easter ham (though I&#39;ve been a vegetarian<br/>
for two decades so I get spared that). Also a green jello concoction that my<br/>
grandma makes that has cottage cheese, pineapple, walnuts, and celery. I<br/>
once had an extended discussion with some co-workers about whether or not<br/>
you could tell someone&#39;s religion by the kind of Jello they made. All my<br/>
Catholic friends did red jello with small marshmallows on top. Most<br/>
Methodists or Presbyterians seemed to favor lime or lemon jellos. We ended<br/>
up having a Jello and board game party where we all brought our family&#39;s<br/>
jello and favorite family board game. It was a hoot, but we got seriously<br/>
sick of jello...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m digressing.... my own Easter tradition is that I always make Key Lime<br/>
Crepes. The heck with regular Easter brunch, these are really sinful and<br/>
yummy :-).<br/>
This year my son dyed most of his eggs green, making them a bit hard to<br/>
find. My daughter threw eggs in dye so fast that we all got tie-dyed in the<br/>
process. The kids ran out of eggs fast so they dyed all the seashells from<br/>
my mom&#39;s collection, then moved on to rocks. They are nothing if not<br/>
creative :-)<br/>
My mom has gotten more tired or lazy or something, she bought dreadful<br/>
store-made hot cross buns instead of making an Easter bread. My grandmother<br/>
has gotten so senile in the last few months that she forgot her green jello<br/>
recipe. The entire Methodist family thing is coming apart at the seams, I<br/>
guess. It&#39;s a bit sad really. On the other hand, my normally gruff step-dad<br/>
held my little daughter&#39;s hand all the way around the yard to search for<br/>
eggs, and the family cat lay down by each egg as if to give the kids a clue.<br/>
The kids turned the dinner chairs over and made them into spaceships and<br/>
re-hid and found the eggs several times just for fun.<br/>

Actually, I don&#39;t know where this tradition comes from.  We don&#39;t do <br/>
jello - but my mom does.  We also always got an empty egg in our <br/>
baskets, to symbolize the empty tomb.  The Easter bunny always hid <br/>
lots of candy - he even hid individual jelly beans!  With my kids, we <br/>
do the toys and not much candy.  DS gets so hyper and cranky whenever <br/>
he gets sugar - or even juice.  Even watered down, juice (and sugar) <br/>
gives me terrible headaches.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for easter dinner, we have deviled eggs, (Funny - I never <br/>
heard of ham for easter before!) vegetable soup, and corn bread.<br/>
<br/>
My mom was not raised in a religious home (though each member of her <br/>
family is currently active in a different church now -like a logic <br/>
problem!!)<br/>
<br/>
And while I&#39;m rambling, has anybody ever tried cyberrebate.com?  I <br/>
was thinking about ordering from there, but I was wondering if it was <br/>
as easy as it looks.<br/>
