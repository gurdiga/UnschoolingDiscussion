<div id="ygrps-yiv-583384533">This applies just to the US but the Department of Ag just issued a mandate<br/>
recently about better training on safe food handling for everyone, not just<br/>
those selling food. In their materials, they claim that the average American<br/>
gets food poisoning twice a year, usually from their own cooking or food<br/>
made by friends or family. In response to their findings, they have a<br/>
program funded and running now for educating anyone who is interested about<br/>
learning to handle and prepare foods safely.<br/>
<br/>
You would want to contact your local county cooperative extension office<br/>
about the program. The class, which I expect is nearly identical throughout<br/>
the US, takes about 2-3 hours and you learn all the ins and outs of<br/>
bacteria, food preservation and more. Well worth taking, especially if<br/>
you&#39;ve a child, or you yourself, selling foods to others. And since the<br/>
county decides on its rules for safe food sales, any questions you had on<br/>
the matter could be easily addressed during the class. It was free here and<br/>
would probably be a free program, or just a few dollars, every where.<br/>
