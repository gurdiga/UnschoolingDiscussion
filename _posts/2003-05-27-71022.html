were probably older earlier, just from hard work, and maybe they <br/>
didn&#39;t make 70, but I bet that folks made 60 (seventh decade). <br/>
Saying &quot;we&quot; only lived to 35 back then...well, &quot;we&quot; did live longer <br/>
than 35. It gets mixed up statistically, averaging in infant and <br/>
childhood mortality. A strong, healthy person, who avoided death by <br/>
childhood disease, and was able to push babies into the world <br/>
successfully, and avoided accidents? Only living to 35? doubt it.<br/>

They were pioneers (their marriage certificate says &quot;Indian Territory&quot; instead <br/>
of Oklahoma).  With his 2 remaining children, he met and married my great <br/>
grandmother, 16 years his jr, and they had 4 more children.  She lived way into <br/>
her 90&#39;s, If I remember right almost 100, I vaguely remember her as I was 4 or 5 <br/>
when she died.  <br/>
