<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582689333">My dh and ds John are playing the RPG Ragnarok online. It&#39;s free and they <br/>
really like it.  Several of ds John&#39;s friends also play.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that John 14 doesn&#39;t want his brother Joshua 10 to play the <br/>
same game.  He really didn&#39;t want his dad to play but felt he couldn&#39;t say <br/>
no when dh asked.  John says it&#39;s not that he thinks they&#39;ll embarass him in <br/>
front of his friends, but he just wants a place to go that&#39;s &quot;his&quot; and not <br/>
the family&#39;s.   So I&#39;m trying to find out if there are any other similar <br/>
games online that are also free.  Can anyone help?  Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169819603">Have you tried Runescape? It&#39;s popular with my kids aged 10 to 15. You can<br/>
play for free, or subscribe for a small fee and get more features.<br/>
<br/>
The other MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. Amazing<br/>
what I learn from my kids!!) That my boys enjoy is World of Warcraft.<br/>
Definitely not free though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12880037">For years Kirby and Marty playe AoN (Alliance of Nations) on AOL.  They said <br/>
it deteriorated, got more mature (i.e. sexual reference) and less fun, too <br/>
crowded.  But...<br/>
<br/>
Last night there was a party here.   One of the regulars was missing.  <br/>
&quot;Is Sadie coming?&quot;<br/>
&quot;She&#39;s still in Germany.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Oh, right!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I seemed to be the only one who didn&#39;t know she was in Germany.  Why?  <br/>
Visiting a guy they all knew from playing AoN.  Kirby met him online about four <br/>
years ago, they said, and liked him, and so he got to interacting regularly <br/>
with Brett, Marty and Sadie.  He&#39;s American, has joined the service ands <br/>
stationed in Germany.  Sa<br/>
Zdie wanted an excuse to visit Germany anyway, so cool!<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s been playing Halo II.   That&#39;s not so cheap.  Kirby and Marty already <br/>
had arranged for DSL and the game itself.  Kirby bought the XBox a couple of <br/>
years ago, I guess.  Holly only had to buy her own headset and pay $50 for a <br/>
year of online.  Keith and I paid for her subscription, because she needed <br/>
something engrossing and distracting so she would stop telling us &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>
ENGLAND!&quot; three or five times a day.  Time was crawling by for her before, but <br/>
now she&#39;s making friends all over the place, learning a LOT of geography and <br/>
history from it (one was in Canterbury, one is in New Zealand, she was on a team <br/>
the other night with four Brits and a few other Americans, against a <br/>
French-speaking team; she has a friend in Arkansas and she&#39;s trying to learn his <br/>
accent &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
