&gt;if you dont teach in a ritualized manner, you can teach by modeling, and <br/>
&gt;answering questions.  so how do children learn to read naturally?  it is not <br/>
&gt;necc for survival<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is in our house! :)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, in today&#39;s society, reading can well be considered a &quot;survival&quot;<br/>
skill (or at least a skill that society at large fully expects of its<br/>
members). ANY child can clearly see that society values reading, hopefully<br/>
most of OUR children (unschooling families) also see that reading is a VERY<br/>
important skill from being with their own parents and siblings and seeing<br/>
them read.<br/>
<br/>
Why do children learn to talk? Because they want to get in on what is<br/>
clearly an important and useful skill. Children will learn to read for the<br/>
same reason.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Brit is five this coming Sunday. She&#39;s been &quot;learning to read&quot;<br/>
since she batted her clenched fists against the paperbacks I read while<br/>
nursing her. She has learned in fits, starts, stages, dry spells and<br/>
everything in between. This week, most of her &quot;reading practice&quot; involves:<br/>
<br/>
a) Watching Blues Clues with her large MagnaDoodle in lap (much handier than<br/>
those tiny &quot;Handy Dandy Notebooks&quot; they sell) and writing the words of the<br/>
clues as Steve shows them on the TV.<br/>
<br/>
b) Writing letters to the girls in her dance class, both by asking me &quot;How<br/>
do you write &#39;Chelsea&#39;?&quot; and by writing letters purely at random on the<br/>
paper.<br/>
<br/>
c) Pointing out repetitive words in the stories I read to her.<br/>
<br/>
Next week may be completely different, she may not work on anything<br/>
resembling reading, or she may do nothing but.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941648940">And The Skylark Sings With Me, by David Albert, is very inspirational for<br/>
parents who aren&#39;t sure HOW to follow their childrens&#39; interests in<br/>
learning.  There are also examples of how parents can find other people<br/>
in the community to help their children learn.  We, as  parents, do not<br/>
need to be our childrens only teachers.  (How limiting that would be!)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But do you know what, she would do nothing about it if I just looked<br/>
&gt;at her and said &quot;great honey - study the ocean!&quot;  So what do you do<br/>
&gt;differently when your child wants to study a subject?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are you sure she wouldn&#39;t?  And would it matter if she didn&#39;t?  Maybe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;need to ask more questions.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;98 % sure (she has done this several times - we get the info and she<br/>
 </span></blockquote>never<br/>
touches it!).  But that aside, I did learn today that she does not really<br/>
know how to ask for the help she needs.  And I have to learn how to<br/>
listen<br/>
and ask the right questions.  Today she said she needed more &quot;structure&quot;<br/>
when  it came to reading.  ?????????  She reads all the time!  So<br/>
needless<br/>
to say alarms went off.  Bottom line (10 minutes and 20 questions later)<br/>
I<br/>
discovered she was uncertain about how to break down words into proper<br/>
syllables and found it tedious - so she would just skip the word when<br/>
reading.  But hey, I rejoice in the fact that at least it bothers her (it<br/>
didn&#39;t use to a year ago!)  So, I&#39;ll do some syllable breakdowns with her<br/>
(perhaps steer her in the direction of some pages in a book on the<br/>
subject)<br/>
and see what she does with it.  Man she makes me work hard!  :o)<br/>

An aside to your daughter&#39;s request for structure in reading:  My<br/>
friend&#39;s homeschooled daughter is an avid reader and keeps asking for<br/>
&quot;spelling tests&quot;.  The irony is that she is also an excellent speller! <br/>
LOL!<br/>
