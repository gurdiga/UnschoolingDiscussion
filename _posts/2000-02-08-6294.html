<div id="ygrps-yiv-726818800">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read this book? - Roots, Shoots, Buckets, and Boots by Sharon <br/>
Lovejoy.  I checked it out from the library last night and it is just <br/>
gorgeous.  It&#39;s about gardening with children.  The illustrations are just <br/>
yummy and the gardening ideas sound like they are magical.  The sunflower <br/>
house is described, along with several other cool things.  I think we are <br/>
going to try to grow the Moon Tent.  It was fascinating to read about night <br/>
time gardening.  I&#39;m going to go buy the book tonight.  I just LOVE finding a <br/>
really terrific book!<br/>

kids see it yet.   Now, if I can just get up from this computer to actually<br/>
go DO some of those gardens. &lt;G&gt;</div>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for passing it along Kim, I was just speaking to my wife about how<br/>
she will be too busy to do any gardening this year and that it would be a<br/>
good plan for me to start reading up on it now... getting ideas etc.  I will<br/>
look for the book you mentioned for sure!</div>
