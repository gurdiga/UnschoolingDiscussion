<div id="ygrps-yiv-791690044">between School at Home and Natural Learning: I just read a lengthy <br/>
description of a &quot;disastrous science experiment&quot; involving the <br/>
disolving of cocoa powder into water, filtering salt water, adding <br/>
the filtered salt water to the cocoa water, tasting it, mom letting <br/>
the kids put it all together while she took care of the baby and the <br/>
resultant kid-made snacks, messes, and attempted clean-ups, asking <br/>
their rocket scientist dad what he thought of the experiment, and the <br/>
one kid who did dare to taste the concoction, pronouncing that it was <br/>
salty...<br/>
<br/>
it was a well-written blog entry, told with humor by a mother of <br/>
four. And at the end of all this colorful description: &quot;we didn&#39;t <br/>
learn anything.&quot; and a promise to fork out the extra cash for the <br/>
teacher&#39;s manual, next time. <br/>
<br/>
Had it been a post to this list, it looks just like &quot;an unschooler&#39;s <br/>
day&quot; LOL except for the part about not learning anything. <br/>

Post that is.<br/>
She will probably get the comment by email AND anyone who looks though <br/>
her archives later will see your comment and ponder on it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70356920">A while back, a schooled friend of ours (probably in 4th or 5th grade <br/>
at the time) mentioned to us that he was &quot;really bad at science.&quot;  <br/>
When we asked him why he thought so, he said something about his <br/>
science teacher always being irritated with him because his <br/>
experiments yielded different results from everyone else&#39;s and was <br/>
further irritated that he thought it was cool when that happened.  <br/>
(How dare he be &quot;wrong&quot; and be happy about it!)  I told him he was <br/>
probably the only person in the class- including the teacher- that had <br/>
the makings of a real scientist.<br/>
