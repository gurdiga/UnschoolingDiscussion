<div id="ygrps-yiv-769050820">I&#39;ve volunteered to organize the mentors and mentees.<br/>
<br/>
After getting ideas from Kelly, this is what I came up with:<br/>
<br/>
1. Mentoring - connecting people up according to interests, and kids&#39; ages.<br/>
<br/>
Mentors: Let me know how many mentees you would take, and your interests.  (Mentors don&#39;t need to be regular posters, but you DO need to be confident in unschooling and willing to share.)<br/>
<br/>
Mentees: Let me know your interests and kids&#39; ages.<br/>
<br/>
I plan on doing this as soon as requests come in so that you can have the chance to email before the conference.  I will do my best to get you as close as possible to your requests.<br/>
<br/>
2. Stickers to announce your druthers - There will be some colored stickers at the registration table for you to put on your name tag (changeable throughout the weekend as you please) signifying things like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been to several L & L conferences and can help you&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m shy, please talk to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Please send your info to me <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jparmer@...">jparmer@...</a><br/>
