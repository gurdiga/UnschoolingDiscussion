<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047355661">&lt;&lt; I realized that she was really studying the drawings, sound, voices, and <br/>
who<br/>
knows what else. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was little he was fascinated by &quot;voice-work&quot;--singing, <br/>
voice-acting for cartoons, voice-overs, ventriloquism, puppetry.  He heard <br/>
voices in a way I never had.  H heard voices like artists see colors.  He <br/>
would recognize a voice on a commercial and say &quot;that&#39;s they guy who does <br/>
Michaelangelo on Ninja Turtles,&quot; and on Sesame Street he figured out which <br/>
all were Jim Henson and which all were Frank Oz.  <br/>
<br/>
Once we were in a little-kids&#39; homeschooling chat.  I was typing for him; he <br/>
was dictating.<br/>
<br/>
One of the kids wrote &quot;Who&#39;s your favorite singer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the time he told me to write &quot;Michael Jackson...&quot;<br/>
and I did, and he added &quot;Julie Andrews,&quot;<br/>
eight or ten other kids had put &quot;Amy Grant.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Nobody else named anyone.<br/>
<br/>
It was a creepy moment in which I felt proud of Kirby and afraid of all other <br/>
homeschoolers on earth.  That&#39;s a weird thing, but it was true at that <br/>
moment.  <br/>
<br/>
I had tried to expose Kirby to anything and everything.  When he was asked <br/>
what singer he liked, he scanned his mind for every singer in every style he <br/>
had ever heard and picked the two he honestly felt were the best singers.  He <br/>
was using the knowledge he had in a guileless and open and honest way.<br/>
<br/>
All I could think was the others were naming one of the few singers their <br/>
parents would let them listen to, and that when she was no longer the #1 <br/>
singer in her (very small) field, they would move on to some other temporary <br/>
favorite.  They weren&#39;t listening to singers in anywhere NEAR the way Kirby <br/>
was listening, nor in the range of exposure to music Kirby was getting.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a moment like that strengthens all resolve and belief in <br/>
unschooling and trusting kids to grow IF you encourage and let them.<br/>
<br/>
I repotted some plants I had kinda forgotten about lately.  They were dusty <br/>
and root-bound and Holly helped me re-pot.  Of course every one of them <br/>
greened up, stretched out, and showed new growth.<br/>
<br/>
Some people keep their kids in a small pot.  Too small and too long.<br/>
I have NO idea how those plants grow, what their roots are thinking, how they <br/>
process what&#39;s in the soil, but I had been starving them in dust.  My job was <br/>
just to make sure they had good, fresh soil and water and sun.  THEY know <br/>
what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
I feel the same way about my kids.  If they want more music, I get more <br/>
music.  More outings?  Let&#39;s go.  More art supplies?  Okay.  Games?  Yes.   <br/>
Super glue and stuff I don&#39;t even recognize?  Parts to fix a TV I&#39;d just as <br/>
soon throw out?  For them it&#39;s good, rich material.<br/>
