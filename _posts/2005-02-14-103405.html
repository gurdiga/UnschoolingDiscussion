&lt;&lt; Search for freecycle instead of the dump. You offer free things from your<br/>
<br/>
home and the one who wants it comes to pick it up. And yes they will take<br/>
<br/>
all kinds of broken things. There is always someone able to fix them. You<br/>
<br/>
can offer anything but meds. Even pets on some free cycle boards. It&#39;s to<br/>
<br/>
help keep the dumps from filling up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cool, thanks!  <br/>
<br/>
I signed up and was going to offer a bed frame, but called the friend who <br/>
gave it to me years ago to give her first refusal, and she wants it back. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good deal, though!  And I&#39;ll say &quot;come and get my scanner&quot; too.  <br/>
<br/>
Freecycle.org and they had groups listed in Germany too, and lots of places.<br/>
