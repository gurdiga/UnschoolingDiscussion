favorite things to do.  He loves to take down all our movies and put them on<br/>
the floor in big webs of connections.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here are a couple of the ways he made the connection from Holes to<br/>
Lord of the Rings.  Feel free to have Abbie e-mail me privately if she is<br/>
interested in having a conversation about this sort of thing (my DH could<br/>
talk for days on the topic...).  :)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;<br/>
Alternate route to Richard Dreyfuss: Henry Winkler from Holes was on Happy<br/>
Days with Ron Howard who was in American Graffiti with Dreyfuss.<br/>
<br/>
Jon Voight (Mr. Sir from Holes) was in Mission: Impossible with Jean Reno.<br/>
Reno starred in The Professional with Natalie Portman.  Portman was, of<br/>
course, Senator Amidala in Star Wars: Episode II.  Christopher Lee played<br/>
Count Duku in Episode II and Saruman in LoTR.<br/>
<br/>
The shortest route I&#39;ve come up with is this: Sigourney Weaver was in<br/>
Working Girl with Harrison Ford.  Ford was in Raiders of the Lost Ark with<br/>
John Rhys-Davies who is Gimli and Treebeard in LoTR.<br/>

My husband and I played this game with each other and came up with a funny!!<br/>

My husband&#39;s sister Michele was married to Tony. Tonys&#39; best friend was Bob<br/>
who was married to Diane. Diane is my first husband&#39;s sister. That&#39;s almost<br/>

And we decided, when a guy has been in as many movies as Kevin Bacon, <br/>
it&#39;s easy to do. But I&#39;ve heard of a spin-off: six degrees of anyone.<br/>
<br/>
The premise being: everyone is connected to anyone else in the world, <br/>
by six degrees, if you only knew enough about people: their friends, <br/>
their families, contacts, etc.<br/>

it is! Now to think of the actors from movies Ron Howard has <br/>
DIRECTED! Darryl Hannah&#39;s (Splash) connections are amazing, having <br/>
been in Steel Magnolias w/ so many women who have been in so many <br/>
other movies...Sally Field in Places in the Heart w/Danny Glover, <br/>
which brings in the movie Roots.<br/>
<br/>
oh, man. Andy Griffith is now in. Shirley Jones (Music Man) brings in <br/>
some of the older movies. I bet we can find that Charlton HEston <br/>
connection we were trying for last night! <br/>
<br/>
And a John Voigt connection. There&#39;s GOT to be some cool ones with <br/>
John Voigt.<br/>

to throw together amazing connections. my favorite personal <br/>
connection is the Family Name, handed down through many generations: <br/>
Spencer. In our generation (my son, my brother, and my dad) it is a <br/>
middle name, but it&#39;s also been a surname in past generations.<br/>
<br/>
The same last name as Princess Diana :) now THERE&#39;S a connection for <br/>
ya! L<br/>
<br/>
My great-gramma corresponded with the daughter of JP Morgan. I wonder <br/>
how many connections there might be from that.<br/>
<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
If I only knew my great-gramma&#39;s total life history: parties, school <br/>
chums...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, here goes.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy Carter: I met Walter Mondale when I was a kid and my dad was in charge<br/>
of security for a speech he was giving. So two degrees from Jimmy Carter<br/>
<br/>
Johnny Rotten: A woman I worked closely with for years at Microsoft also has<br/>
been a professional manager for touring groups and she also managed the &quot;big<br/>
stage&quot; at Bumbershoot every year (Bumbershoot is Seattle&#39;s big music<br/>
festival). So I&#39;m probably 2 degrees from tons of famous musicians through<br/>
her. I just recalled that Johnny Rotten was one of the ones she mentioned<br/>
meeting.<br/>
<br/>
J. Edgar Hoover: My dad was a Special Agent in the FBI from 1962 - 1972 and<br/>
he met Hoover.<br/>
<br/>
Adolph Hitler: This is the most interesting one: My librarian in high school<br/>
lived in Germany during WWII. As a child, she had won a (mandatory) essay<br/>
contest in school, I think it was something along the lines of &quot;Why I love<br/>
Germany&quot;. The prize was that she got to go on a train trip to a big banquet<br/>
and meet Hitler. What struck me as most interesting is that they had been so<br/>
impoverished for so long (remember the huge pre-war depression in Germany)<br/>
that almost all she remembers of the entire trip was that they had *real*<br/>
oranges at the banquet.<br/>
<br/>
Viggo Mortensen: I used to be in a punk rock band and also helped put on<br/>
shows when touring punk bands came to my town. Over the years, I met Exene<br/>
Cervenka several times. She was married to Viggo later (after the period<br/>
when I had met her).<br/>
<br/>
Also, Ginger Rogers and Kirsty Ally used to live by me, and I&#39;ve met them,<br/>
so I&#39;m two degrees from anyone they met as well (think Fred Astaire and the<br/>
like, John Travolta, etc.) as did Richard Bach (author of Jonathan Livinston<br/>
Seagull). Various random punk rock people who are famous now also used to<br/>
hang out at our house when we were doing shows (Henry Rollins is one<br/>
unforgettable one. Jello Biafra is another). Oh yeah, I&#39;ve also met Michael<br/>
Stipe from R.E.M. though I didn&#39;t know who he was at the time, very nice guy<br/>
and we talked about PETA and vegetarianism (which I was really into at the<br/>
time, being newly converted). Oh here&#39;s a funny one. The guy who trained<br/>
animals for all those old corny Disney flicks lived out our way as well. So<br/>
I&#39;ve met &quot;Charlie the Friendly Cougar&quot; (remember that one?) and Rascal the<br/>
raccoon and others.<br/>
<br/>
So, there ya go!<br/>

&lt;&lt;Jimmy Carter: I met Walter Mondale when I was a kid and my dad was in<br/>
charge<br/>
of security for a speech he was giving. So two degrees from Jimmy Carter&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, I have a Jimmy Carter link too. My dad owned a gas station in Beaver<br/>
Falls PA and Jimmy Carter&#39;s motorcade stopped there for gas as they were<br/>
driving through town. (I think he had a rally of some sorts in Pittsburgh)<br/>
My dad ended up actually having Pierre Salinger calling him about doing a<br/>
story because the credit card they used for the gas was no good!! My smart<br/>
ass dad made the remark they should have paid in peanuts!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now Robin you really have me thinking. Lets see, I have met the Ambassador<br/>
to Brazil (years ago) Elke Sommer, Bill ? (what was Maude&#39;s husband name?)<br/>
Terry Bradshaw, Lynn Swan, the big giant brother from Everyone Loves<br/>
Raymond, Danny Marino, been on Oprah. Know Joe Namath. Have a cousin that<br/>
was a CIA operative. (can only imagine who he knows) Had another cousin work<br/>
for the FBI. Met at one time or another most of the Pittsburgh Steelers,<br/>
year 1975. I have to wrack my brain for more. OOh, the Williams sisters at<br/>
the airport and also Rick Flair and some other big old wrestler. You can see<br/>
how infatuated I am by not knowing the names!!!<br/>

with that hair and those eyes!!<br/>
