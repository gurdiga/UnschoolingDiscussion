<div id="ygrps-yiv-293257080">I&#39;m posting a short note to see if anything comes through any of my <br/>
yahoo groups.<br/>
<br/>
getting &quot;bounced&quot; from hotmail, and I posted here, but don&#39;t see my <br/>
post at all, anywhere...to LeeAnn about not ignoring the kids <br/>
anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone besides Lee-Ann see that one?<br/>
<br/>
could someone email me? <br/>
<br/>
thanks, HeidiC</div>
