Thankyou so much - you have no idea how much you made my day!  <br/>
And the Andrew sisters? I love them!  The copy my uncle had was by a man, <br/>
I had no idea the Andrew sisters did that one!  You wouldn&#39;t happen to know where <br/>
I could get a copy of their songs (now, I&#39;m not sure of the title, I&#39;m working from a <br/>
little girls&#39; memory) &quot;Beat me Daddy, Eight to the Bar&quot; and &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot;<br/>
would you?<br/>
