<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541343699">The last &quot;barometers&quot; I sent had nothing to do with barometers, as you<br/>
probably noticed. Here is the real &#39;barometers&#39;:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lateral thinking or Many Answers to a Question<br/>
&gt; By R.G. Keswani<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some time ago I received a call from a colleague. He was about to give a<br/>
&gt; student a zero for this answer to a physics question, while the student<br/>
&gt; claimed a perfect score. The instructor and the student agreed to an<br/>
&gt; impartial arbiter, and I was selected.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I read the examination question: &quot;Show how it is possible to determine the<br/>
&gt; height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The student had answered, &quot;Take the barometer to the top of the building,<br/>
&gt; attach a long rope to it, lower it to the street, and then bring it up,<br/>
&gt; measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is the the height<br/>
&gt; of the building.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The student really had a strong case for full credit since he had really<br/>
&gt; answered the question completely and correctly! On the other hand, if full<br/>
&gt; credit were given, it could well contribute to a high grade in his physics<br/>
&gt; course and to certify competence in physics, but the answer did not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>confirm<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suggested that the student have another try. I gave him six minutes, to<br/>
&gt; answer the question with the warning that the answer should show some<br/>
&gt; knowledge of physics. At the end of five minutes, he had not written<br/>
&gt; anything. I asked if he wished to give up, but he said he had many answers<br/>
&gt; to this problem; he was just thinking of the best one. I excused myself<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; interrupting him and asked him to please go on. In the next minute, he<br/>
&gt; dashed off his answer which read: &quot;Take the barometer to the top of the<br/>
&gt; building and lean over the edge of the roof. Drop the barometer, timing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fall with a stopwatch. &#39;Then using the formula s=0.5at^2, calculate the<br/>
&gt; height of the building.&quot; At this point, I asked my colleague if he would<br/>
&gt; give up. He conceded, and gave the student, almost full credit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While leaving my colleague, I recalled that the student had said that he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other answers to the problem, so I asked him what they were. &quot;Well,&quot; said<br/>
&gt; the student, &quot;there are many ways of getting the height of a tall building<br/>
&gt; with the aid of a barometer. For example, you could take the barometer out<br/>
&gt; on a sunny day and measure the height of the barometer, the length of the<br/>
&gt; its shadow and the length of the shadow of the building, and by the use of<br/>
&gt; simple proportion, determine the height of the building.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Fine&quot;, I said, &quot;and others?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; said the student, &quot;there is a very basic measurement method you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; like. In this method, you take the barometer and begin to walk up the<br/>
&gt; stairs. As you climb the stairs, you mark off the length of the barometer<br/>
&gt; along the wall. You then count the number of marks, and this will give you<br/>
&gt; the height of the building in barometer units.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;A very direct method.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Of course if you want a more sophisticated method, you can tie the<br/>
&gt; barometer to the end of a string, swing it as a pendulum, and determine<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; value of g at the street level and at the top of the building. From the<br/>
&gt; difference between two values of g, the height of the building, in<br/>
&gt; principle, can be calculated&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;On the same tack, you could take the barometer to the top of the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>building,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; attach a long rope to it, lower it to just above the street, and then<br/>
 </span></blockquote>swing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it as a pendulum. You could then calculate the height of the building by<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; period of the precession.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Finally,&quot; he concluded, &quot;there are many other ways of solving the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>problem.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Probably the best.&quot; he said, &quot;is to take the barometer to the basement and<br/>
&gt; knock on the superintendent&#39;s door. When he answers, you speak to him as<br/>
&gt; follows: Sir, here is a fine barometer. If you will tell me the height of<br/>
&gt; the building I will give you this barometer.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At this point, I asked the student if he really did not know the<br/>
&gt; conventional answer to this question. He admitted that he did, but said<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; he was fed up with high school and college instructors trying to teach him<br/>
&gt; how to think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The student was Niels Bohr and the arbiter Rutherford.<br/>
