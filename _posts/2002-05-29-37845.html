Actually, isn&#39;t there some kind of Giant Crab that isn&#39;t really a crab at<br/>
all but a spider down in the deep blue sea?  Possibly not...but this is what<br/>
sprung to mind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, in reality, spiders are not even insects; they are in the same phylae<br/>
(or is it genus, or something?  I can never remember) as crabs and<br/>
lobsters.  So I believe you&#39;re probably technically correct; although I am<br/>
not familiar with exactly which of the particualr name-brands of crabs are<br/>
the largest.<br/>
<br/>
This is why, if you ever hear a biologist-type referring to spiders, they<br/>
will normally NEVER refer to them as insects.<br/>
<br/>
This has gotten my own curiosity piqued; now I&#39;ll have to go research it<br/>
myself!  Hey!  Unschooling is supposed to be for my KIDS!!  ;-)<br/>

But are they bugs?  What are the edges of &quot;bugs&quot;?  (Since it&#39;s a pre-&quot;phylum&quot; <br/>
word I suppose it&#39;s the broad generic thing Anglo Saxons knew about.)<br/>
