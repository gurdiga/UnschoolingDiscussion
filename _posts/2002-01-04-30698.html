<div id="ygrps-yiv-10731469">Greetings - My 14-year-old son and I have recently taken the plunge <br/>
into unschooling, much to the consternation of anyone to whom I <br/>
reveal our decision.  There are some people I just won&#39;t tell (I tell <br/>
them we&#39;re HOME schooling, and they seem better able to handle <br/>
that).  Are there any unschooling teens/parents in the Sacramento <br/>
area?  I&#39;d love to connect with you for support, ideas, etc.  Thanks!<br/>

Have you connected up with this org yet?  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org/">http://www.hsc.org/</a>  I know they<br/>
have a large homeschooling conference every year in Sacremento and it&#39;s<br/>
fairly &quot;unschooly&quot;.<br/>

everybody in the unschooling community there.  Do you want me to forward <br/>
your post to her?  I think she&#39;s away for a few days just now.<br/>
