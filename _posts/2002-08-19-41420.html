<div id="ygrps-yiv-612541978">If we are making a grocery list, then it is &quot;front/back/anybody<br/>
remember palimpsest?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the paper is for visual creativity, then restrictions on how<br/>
much is used or when it is discarded will eliminate certain kinds<br/>
of creativity.  Violation of the edge, elaboration as art,<br/>
positive/negative space certain poem/visual pairings come to<br/>
mind.  Take a look at what is visually pleasing to you and<br/>
evaluate how much of the quality you like comes from the use of<br/>
white space or negative space.  Open up a Shel Silverstein book<br/>
and see why &quot;unused&quot; space contributes to the design.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that $5 a sheet of handmade paper gets used<br/>
profligately, but rather that the artist&#39;s freedom to use 3% of<br/>
that page comes from exploring the process.  If a kid is making<br/>
one mark on a piece of paper and throwing it away repeatedly, I<br/>
would start inquiring.  It may be that what the kid is trying for<br/>
needs to be done in sketch book - or that the wrong tool or<br/>
medium for the effect is being used - or that while the practice<br/>
is satisfying, the paper can be reused for something else<br/>
(grocery lists anyone)?<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that folks were interested in &quot;the grab your left ear&quot;<br/>
example I posted, but that the pyramid builder/Giotto example<br/>
whizzed right past, so the list may have a low quotient of<br/>
visualists, but for the kids&#39; sakes make sure they can explore<br/>
that part of learning too ... just my little plea for art ...</div>

<br/>
  Boy-do-I-feel-dumb question:  Is palimpsest where you turn the paper sideways and write over what is already there, like the pioneers did to conserve paper when they were writing letters because postage was so expensive?     Debi<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-640312402">That&#39;s the most common understanding of it - actually the term<br/>
refers to a heavy &quot;paper&quot; like parchment that can withstand being<br/>
erased and scraped to re-use.<br/>
