<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625639277">I have to make that time - though I find a little bit of time to myself<br/>
goes a long way!  It doesn&#39;t occur to my dh to come home and say -<br/>
&quot;you&#39;ve been with the kids all day, why don&#39;t I give you a break&quot;.  But<br/>
he is a dear and always says yes when I tell him I need time for myself.<br/>
I also make sure to spend time with MY friends.  I invite them over or<br/>
invite myself to their house or we see each other at homeschool<br/>
functions.<br/>
