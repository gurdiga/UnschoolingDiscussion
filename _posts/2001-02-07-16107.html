<br/>
Another case of the risk of the problem nothing <br/>
compared to the risk/stress of the injection!  Heel-<br/>
prick tests are bad enough, no way my baby&#39;s getting <br/>
anything else stuck in &#39;em...  don&#39;t know how accurate <br/>
this is, heard this at ante-natal classes with dd2, but <br/>
apparently vernix is loaded with vit K, so if it&#39;s just <br/>
left on to soak in, and not washed off, then the baby <br/>
gets a lovely big dose, as well as breastmilk <br/>
containing enough of the stuff (naturally, as one might <br/>
expect.)<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to list all of these sites.  My head is <br/>
spinning doing all of this research!  Yesterday, I was at my OB&#39;s and <br/>
just had to open the can of worms slightly to see what he was going <br/>
to say.  I asked if I was Hepatitis B positive (I knew I wasn&#39;t) and <br/>
then asked if I am correct in thinking that my newborn can&#39;t contract <br/>
this disease unless he becomes a person in the high risk catagory.  <br/>
He confirmed that the baby has no chance of getting this disease NOW, <br/>
but did go on to say that the vaccination will provide immunity for <br/>
life against the disease and that when my child is 20 and possibly <br/>
sexual active, we know he won&#39;t get it.  I dropped it there and left <br/>
thinking, &quot;Do I want to inject my baby with the HIB shot now to <br/>
prevent the possibility of something that could happen in 20 years <br/>
from now?&quot;  BIG question!  Does the risk factor of adverse reaction <br/>
at birth outweigh the risk factor in 20 years?<br/>
<br/>
Also, my husband has autoimmune deficiencies such as Ankylosing <br/>
Spondylitis and Crohn&#39;s disease and I am reading that my children <br/>
fall into the catagory of possibly being medically exempt from <br/>
vaccination because of genetics.  When my husband was very, very sick <br/>
with these diseases he had often wondered if some environmental <br/>
factor had triggered these.  My research is pointing to the <br/>
possibility of this vaccination triggering it.  I am trying to take <br/>
this one step at a time, starting with the vaccination given at the <br/>
hospital.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, no, homebirth is not an option since I have scheduled C-Sections <br/>
(please, this is not a subject I&#39;m opening up for negative comments) <br/>
and I have personally wondered, if I didn&#39;t have c-sections, would I <br/>
consider homebirth.  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to read all of the experiences and decisions all of you <br/>
have made regarding vaccinations, it is very helpful & thank you...<br/>

**No problem...I was passing it along from another list.<br/>

<br/>
**From what I&#39;ve read, in college students who were vaccinated for this (hep<br/>
b) it worked only half of the time anyway. This vaccine really seems to be<br/>
one of those where the risks from the shot itself is worse than the<br/>
&quot;protection&quot; it&#39;s supposed to give. I&#39;m going to let my kids decide  this<br/>
for themselves.<br/>

Good luck with your new babe...when are you due?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538217573">On my list of questions re:immunizations is to find out exactly who <br/>
the people that have the diseases are.  I&#39;m not quite that far yet.  <br/>
What I am really concerned about is, if I choose not to vaccinate <br/>
with the HIB, what kind of harrassment am I going to get?  I&#39;d love <br/>
to say that our current pediatrician would be open to discussion on <br/>
this, but I know she wouldn&#39;t be.  How sad...<br/>
<br/>
The baby is scheduled for March 16th so I feel very pressured (by <br/>
myself and the hospital) into making an informed decision.  And <br/>
personally, this subject has not been met with an open-mind by my <br/>
husband.  I&#39;ve broached the subject in a roundabout way and he knows <br/>
that I&#39;m currently looking into it and he will have to choose whether <br/>
or not he wants to look into my findings (just like everything I <br/>
research!).<br/>
<br/>
I live in Illinois and, as I understand the law, I can seek out <br/>
medical exemption based on my husband&#39;s autoimmune diseases or I can <br/>
seek out religious exemption based on my beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
I really am now wondering about more of you on this list and what you <br/>
chose for your children.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, did you immunize yours (I may have missed your answer to this <br/>
on previous posts), your last post suggests that you haven&#39;t.  Just <br/>
curious...<br/>

<br/>
Less and less with each child.  I think Holly&#39;s had none since she left the <br/>
hospital.  When she was little her pediatrician pressed for polio, and first <br/>
I said &quot;killed only&quot; because she hung out with friends whose dad has had <br/>
organ transplants and severe diabetes and needs REALLY not to be around such <br/>
things.  I think after getting the approval for the kiilled polio, I just <br/>
dodged the return visit.  She MIGHT have gotten that one, but I think not.  <br/>
Then on subsequent visits the doctor would say &quot;She&#39;s behind on vaccines&quot; and <br/>
I&#39;d say &quot;I don&#39;t want her to have them,&quot; I&#39;d get one eyebrow up look, and I&#39;d <br/>
give one back and change the subject.  I liked that doctor.  She was young <br/>
and quick and bright and repecected that I wasn&#39;t just pulling stuff out of <br/>
my...  netherparts.<br/>
<br/>
We have been assigned a new primary care physician by our HMO just last <br/>
month, and I don&#39;t know how/who he is.  I had kinda thought of taking the <br/>
whole batch of kids and me in and doing checkups and a meet-the-doctor moment <br/>
(hour &lt;g&gt;).  Maybe I will and maybe I won&#39;t.  But if he gives me pressure <br/>
about vaccinations I&#39;ll switch physicians.<br/>

My baby is due March 11th and I am also looking into this vaccine thing.  I <br/>
asked this list some questions and have gotten a TON of responses!  I am <br/>
still researching and have started with the HIB shot.  My dh is also a little <br/>
leary of not vaccinating, but I just keep telling him that I am doing the <br/>
research, I wouldn&#39;t do it if I thought it would hurt our baby, and that it <br/>
isn&#39;t a forever decision, just right now.  So, good luck to you.  I have not <br/>
mentioned this to my OB, and I probably won&#39;t.  I will, as someone suggested, <br/>
write down on the hospital forms that I do not want the baby vaccinated.  I <br/>
wish I could do a homebirth but our insurance wouldn&#39;t cover it.  So, I am <br/>
prepared to battle with these people if I have too!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113740991">you most likely don&#39;t have to vaccinate your child at all (although I&#39;m<br/>
not familiar with your state&#39;s laws).  Usually those laws only apply to<br/>
including kids in school or something....and if you decline to vaccinate<br/>
at birth and later change your mine, you can always vaccinate later.  You<br/>
can&#39;t go back and unvaccinate, though.  We have one partially vaccinated<br/>
(before I even considered do any research into it...we stopped prior to<br/>
the MMR and he got measles from a vaccinated child), one who was totally<br/>
unvaccinated until fall when he had a 1/2 dose of tetanus (and needs the<br/>
other doses, still) after careful consideration and discussion with our<br/>
family doctor, and one (a baby) who is vaccine free and will remain so<br/>
until age 5 or so unless soemthing changes.  Our family doctor is<br/>
comfortable with this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-222192262">The info on the length of immunity with a Hep B vaccine is misinformation.<br/>
The CDC and the pharmeucutical company themselves have stated that they<br/>
*think* the vaccine&#39;s life is *about* 10 years and are recommending boosters<br/>
every 10 years.  They have stated when questioned on this (some of the folks<br/>
used as guinea pigs have gotten Hep B), that they hope it is longer,<br/>
possibly 20 years but the testing was only done in the late 80&#39;s and early<br/>
90&#39;s so they cannot tell at this time.<br/>

&gt; Also, my husband has autoimmune deficiencies such as Ankylosing<br/>
&gt; Spondylitis and Crohn&#39;s disease and I am reading that my children<br/>
&gt; fall into the catagory of possibly being medically exempt from<br/>
&gt; vaccination because of genetics.  When my husband was very, very sick<br/>
&gt; with these diseases he had often wondered if some environmental<br/>
&gt; factor had triggered these.  My research is pointing to the<br/>
&gt; possibility of this vaccination triggering it.  I am trying to take<br/>
&gt; this one step at a time, starting with the vaccination given at the<br/>
&gt; hospital.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, no, homebirth is not an option since I have scheduled C-Sections<br/>
&gt; (please, this is not a subject I&#39;m opening up for negative comments)<br/>
&gt; and I have personally wondered, if I didn&#39;t have c-sections, would I<br/>
&gt; consider homebirth.  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am happy to read all of the experiences and decisions all of you<br/>
&gt; have made regarding vaccinations, it is very helpful & thank you... </span></blockquote></div>
