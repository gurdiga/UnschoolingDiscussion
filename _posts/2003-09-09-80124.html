&gt;Hi everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t had a chance to write much since moving to WA but I have been<br/>
&gt;&quot;lurking and reading&quot; as often as possible. :-)  We have spent months at <br/>
&gt;doctors.<br/>
&gt;I have been struggling with the &quot;should I put the children back in public<br/>
&gt;and/or am I capable of teaching children with so many challenges&quot; <br/>
&gt;syndrome!  I was<br/>
&gt;OK with one special needs child, but now the test results are in and I have<br/>
&gt;two.  Although I knew something was going on, the diagnosis has caused me to<br/>
&gt;question my skills in teaching two children with very different <br/>
&gt;challenges!  So<br/>
&gt;I will turn to the only ones I know deal with these same challenges on a <br/>
&gt;daily<br/>
&gt;basis.  As a single, adoptive grandmother, I don&#39;t know who else would<br/>
&gt;understand.  I hope you can give me some guidance or at least hear me vent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Jamie (13yo) has multiple diagnosis.  She is a post-renal transplant, and is<br/>
&gt;diagnosed ADHD, OD,OCD, Fetal Alcohol Affect, Anxiety and Attachment <br/>
&gt;disorder,<br/>
&gt;an eating disorder similar to Pradder Willy (sp)(causing our kitchen and all<br/>
&gt;food to need to be in &quot;lock-down&quot; at all times), and  probably is high<br/>
&gt;functioning Aspergers.  She is active in Special Olympics swimming and ice <br/>
&gt;skating as<br/>
&gt;well as ther. horseback riding.  She currently is at about a 3rd grade level<br/>
&gt;in most subjects.  We have found Math-U-See, Saxon Math, Read Naturally to <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;work well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Brian (9yo) is diagnosed with mild ADHD.  He has been struggling with<br/>
&gt;spelling, reading and language since the 1st grade.  His math skills have <br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt;excellent.  So testing was done this summer to try to figure out what is <br/>
&gt;going on.<br/>
&gt;I just met with the phychologist and it seems that Brian is dyslexic, a<br/>
&gt;perfectionist, and gifted in math and science.  He tests at about a 2nd <br/>
&gt;grade level<br/>
&gt;in those subjects he has been struggling in and is at a 7th grade level in<br/>
&gt;math and science.  Ballet is his passion, dancing 4-5 times a week with <br/>
&gt;children<br/>
&gt;that are 12-13yo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, my questions to all of you . . . What curriculums have worked for your<br/>
&gt;children diagnosed with dyslexia?  I am searching for something for his<br/>
&gt;reading, writing, and spelling.  The doctor wants Brian to be allowed to <br/>
&gt;fly with his<br/>
&gt;math and science.  He tests way above grade level and she wants me (or the<br/>
&gt;school) to let him go with it.  Any suggestions anyone?  Patti, do you <br/>
&gt;know of<br/>
&gt;good math/science programs that you possibly used with your older sons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have met with the school super. (and special ed supervisor) at the local<br/>
&gt;public school.  The school &quot;rates&quot; highly on the state level and has 250<br/>
&gt;children K-12.  He assures me that he will &quot;work with me&quot;.  I have gone <br/>
&gt;back and<br/>
&gt;forth concerning public vs home.  The children have done well at home, but <br/>
&gt;is it<br/>
&gt;enough?  Has anyone done a part-time day at the public school?  He seems open<br/>
&gt;to working with me, but for obvious reasons, I don&#39;t trust the public <br/>
&gt;system.<br/>
&gt;If it doesn&#39;t work, how difficult will it be for me to pull the children?<br/>
&gt;Neither has an IEP in WA State.  Once one is in place, how much control <br/>
&gt;will I<br/>
&gt;loose over their schooling?  I was also assured that the school has a zero<br/>
&gt;tolerance for bullies, drugs/alcohol, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If anyone has ANY suggestions or input on public/home, curriculum or just<br/>
&gt;response to my rambling, please let me know.  I need to either meet with the<br/>
&gt;super and enroll them or get the Letter of Intent done ASAP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks, Mona<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022968722">My first thought in reading over this post pretty quickly, was, the <br/>
first child, with all those diagnoses from Fetal Alcohol to OCD...way <br/>
beyond my pale and I have nothing helpful to say about that<br/>
<br/>
however, when I came to the second child, with a diagnosis of adhd... <br/>
I kind of shook my head. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;He has been struggling with<br/>
&gt; &gt;spelling, reading and language since the 1st grade.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>oh, my. Wringing my hands...NOT... (This from a mom with a 9 year old <br/>
who *could legally* be in 4th grade, who isn&#39;t reading yet, either, <br/>
and is really wiggly and doesn&#39;t sit still for long periods very <br/>
well,and most likely has dyslexia...etc.)<br/>
<br/>
IOW, in my opinion, this gramma should not worry about the boy w/the <br/>
adhd &quot;diagnosis.&quot; A lot of that could just be immaturity, you know? <br/>
My chief worry with that one would be that he&#39;s now labeled, and <br/>
probably knows it if he&#39;s as bright as my Katie. Which is a shame. <br/>
Let him age a bit LOL and I bet he&#39;ll grow out of this &quot;mild adhd&quot; <br/>
diagnosis and astound everyone with his stellar math and science <br/>
brain...and hire an assistant for the verbally oriented stuff that <br/>
needs doing when he&#39;s doing Nobel Prize winning research :)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053175686">Hi Mona,<br/>
I&#39;m fairly new to home ed. and I&#39;m in the UK, but have you looked at the<br/>
website for Education Otherwise? I know I&#39;ve seen info. about working with<br/>
dyslexia on there and although we don&#39;t follow curriculums, there might be<br/>
something that helps. There&#39;s also a mail list for EO which I have found<br/>
immensely useful. The address for EO is www.education-otherwise.org .<br/>
Best wishes to you and the children.<br/>
