<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063818134">Hello, my name is Nancy. I have been lurking on this list for about a week <br/>
and a half, and can no longer stand to wait. I am so excited by what I have <br/>
read here.I am on the HEM unschooling list as well.<br/>
I live in Prince George, British Columbia, about 500  miles north of <br/>
Vancouver. WE are on the highway to Alaska if anyone ever goes through.My <br/>
husband and I have two children, Tommy, 7 and Lesley Ann, 18mos. Tommy has <br/>
never gone to school and I thought I was a radical unschooler until I read <br/>
this list. WOW. It feels so right and I am so completely immersed in reading <br/>
the posts that I keep running to the computer to check for new mail.<br/>
I can see that I have a long way to go in letting go of my school mentality <br/>
and controlling behaviours, but I am inspired by what I read here. In Prince <br/>
George, we used to have a small group of unschoolers that met monthly to <br/>
discuss Unschooling. This group has disintegrated over the last year and I <br/>
found this list in my search for community and information to replace it.<br/>
I look forward to reading more of the wisdom and ideas from the people who <br/>
post here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990619605">Welcome Nancy!<br/>
 <br/>
I have read your name over in the HEM list a few times!    <br/>
 <br/>
This is where I hang most of the time!      This group of people have brought so much awareness to my life.   I can&#39;t even tell you how great its been.<br/>
 <br/>
I was reading the Home Ed. Magazine yesterday and there are 5 or 6 people right from this list that had articles or writings in it!    It was great to read them.          <br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s to keeping that unschooling momentum going!<br/>
