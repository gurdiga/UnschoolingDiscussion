<div id="ygrps-yiv-672712056">Hi Zan,<br/>
Thanks for the helpful, considerate ideas and empathy.<br/>
Neat hearing someone else relating.  <br/>
Good suggestions about painting room or chair.. will do and let you know how <br/>
it worked out.<br/>
And yes, I need to create more art with them,  you are right about that.  My <br/>
hubby is the &quot;real artist&quot;  (you know what I mean.)<br/>
He needs to go for it with our son!<br/>
Be blessed,<br/>
Bj<br/>
