<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241458983">-=-I have found that with unschooling my questions are only answered  <br/>
IF I want to &quot;convert&quot; or I agree or am searching for an alternative  <br/>
to my current situation.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think this would be true at a tire store, too, or a pizza joint.   <br/>
If you don&#39;t want tires, why would you expect them to answer a bunch  <br/>
of questions?  If you don&#39;t want pizza, why ask all about ingredients  <br/>
and toppings and prices and comparisons?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not their job to answer questions of anyone who wanders by and  <br/>
plainly states no interest?<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the deal:  Asking IS showing an interest,  so these  <br/>
statement are either contradictory, or this is creepy stalking:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Honestly, unschooling is NOT for me and my family for many  <br/>
reasons. -=-<br/>
-=-I didn&#39;t realize I was asking either of you for help.  I am doing  <br/>
just fine in my &quot;mainstream&quot; world. -=-<br/>
-=- I find that any lifestyle lived in one end of the spectrum or  <br/>
another can be thwarting to some degree.  What disturbs me is the  <br/>
attitude of superiority that the Unschooling Community seems to  <br/>
hold.  There could be some useful techniques or tips from your  <br/>
lifestyle I could use in my life, however, I will never know since no  <br/>
one will answer some basic questions. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Having written to another unschooler eighteen months back, that shows  <br/>
an interest.  Not having gotten over it, and writing more (lengthily,  <br/>
to me, on a Sunday) about something that is CLEARLY available (&quot; I  <br/>
had taken time to browse some sites (including yours) before emailing  <br/>
you.&quot;), what could be the deal?  Harrassment?  An awkward request to  <br/>
be persuaded?  Unhealthy obsession?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Sunday.  Shouldn&#39;t people be spending time with their kids?   <br/>
Mine aren&#39;t even young, but this mom&#39;s kids are both younger.   <br/>
SURELY, certainly, hanging out with them should win out over bugging  <br/>
me.  So it&#39;s not true that there&#39;s no interest.  There&#39;s a deep,  <br/>
abiding, disturbing interest.<br/>
<br/>
[And so far today I was on the phone with Kirby for half an hour  <br/>
(he&#39;s 22), talked to Marty and helped him get ready for his half-day  <br/>
in Santa Fe, and he&#39;s going to go with me to dinner tonight (I didn&#39;t  <br/>
know that when he left, but it&#39;s cool) and I took Holly to rendezvous  <br/>
with the other airsoft players, and then went to get gifts for her  <br/>
birthday-celebrating friend.  We&#39;ll probably miss Desperate  <br/>
Housewives, what we usually do on Sunday  night while we sort  <br/>
laundry.  We&#39;ll watch it online tomorrow or Tuesday.  Lily Tomlin  <br/>
will be on (and was briefly last week), so I found her a couple of  <br/>
old Lily Tomlin bits on YouTube the other day.]<br/>
<br/>
Ah.  Before I go to the list of questions, this:<br/>
-=-There could be some useful techniques or tips from your lifestyle  <br/>
I could use in my life, however, I will never know since no one will  <br/>
answer some basic questions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The other unschooling mom told me she had answered the same questions  <br/>
repeatedly for this person.<br/>
I don&#39;t think the mom who wrote wants answers.  I think she wants to  <br/>
correspond with people she considers prominent, who have been on TV  <br/>
or have websites.  This isn&#39;t healthy or courteous.<br/>
