When people survive divorce, the death of a child, a serious illness or <br/>
accident, they learn from it.   That doesn&#39;t suggest we should try to arrange for <br/>
everyone ot have those experiences.   A curriculum of experiences that each <br/>
soul has to go through?<br/>

Quite a schoolish view of the reincarnational world.  <br/>

<br/>
Sorry--I try to take the automatic who-wrote part off a lot of times even if <br/>
it WAS the author, because I really want it to be about the ideas and not <br/>
about the who.   And because I usually ignore them myself, I don&#39;t notice them as <br/>
much as I should.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to be more careful.<br/>

<br/>
And I see it as an unschooling concept! lol<br/>
<br/>
Learn what you want, when you want to, and no one will<br/>
tell you if that&#39;s right or wrong, it just is as you<br/>
want it, for your own growth.  <br/>
<br/>
Just like unschooling, actually! <br/>
<br/>
With, depending on the spiritual beliefs you might<br/>
have, god, goddess, angels, oversoul, etc as your<br/>
facilitator and guide. <br/>
