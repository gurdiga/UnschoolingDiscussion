hoo!!!)<br/>
BTW, you didn&#39;t happen to be an April Evans before you were an April Wells? I <br/>
only ask because we have a local provider called cox, and I went to school <br/>
with an April Evans. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

Wasn&#39;t he MacGyver at one time?<br/>
I loved that show. When are they going to do another made for TV movie with<br/>
him?<br/>

and the guy they found to play Daniel Jackson is really good but I <br/>
have this thing for James Spader . . . <br/>
