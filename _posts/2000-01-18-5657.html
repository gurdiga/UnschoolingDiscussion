&lt;&lt;I haven&#39;t been very helpful in her pursuit of great historical fiction<br/>
<br/>
regarding this era in American history (we do not cover it here in<br/>
<br/>
Canada...esp. at elementary levels). She is particularly interested in the<br/>
<br/>
1800&#39;s. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the Fleischman&#39;s (Either Sid or Paul) recently published a lively book <br/>
about a girl who ends up travelling with &quot;the bandit&quot; Joaquin Murietta.  I <br/>
don&#39;t remember the title, but maybe you can find it at the library.  I <br/>
enjoyed the book.  It&#39;s set around 1849.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Zorro is a set in California, when it was still part of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had more suggestions.  I&#39;ll be interested to hear what others have <br/>
to say.<br/>
