<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071091658">Hi I am new here. I have a couple of questions.   Have any of you <br/>
taken your kids out of school to unschool? if so at what ages?   <br/>
Do you have high schoolers or have you &quot;graduated&quot; high schoolers?<br/>
       My ds is just beginning to HS. He was in the 7th grade butwould like <br/>
to skip the 8th grade and move on tothe 9th.  He is very smart but has done <br/>
poorly in PS for many years. He asked to HS. His older brother is failing his <br/>
freshman year of high school and planning on taking summer school to try to make <br/>
up some classes. He does not want to HS.  He was brought home in the middle of <br/>
last year, but never allowed himself to enjoy it.<br/>
       I have tried to be flexible with my 7th grader,  but I do tryto get <br/>
him to do some &quot;school work&quot;. He goes back and forth between wanting me to give <br/>
him assignments and telling me I am too pushey. I don&#39;t think he is sure what <br/>
he wants. He certainly has me confused.<br/>
<br/>
       Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

the how our children grow up today.  There is no greater insight into the <br/>
future than recognizing when we save our children, we save ourselves.  Margaret <br/>

I&#39;m pretty inflexible with my kids.  I won&#39;t MAKE them do any academic thing, <br/>
and I won&#39;t let other people make them either.  <br/>
<br/>
That flexibility you&#39;re talking about is a lack of conviction! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you believe he can learn on his own, you need to give him a clear, free <br/>
shot at doing so.  It&#39;s possible to do, but it take some concentration and <br/>
willpower on the part of the parents.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something it will help you to read, and read the one linked at the <br/>
bottom too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642945030"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Have any of you taken your kids out of school to unschool? if so at <br/>
 </span></blockquote>what ages? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son Conor went to public school through the middle of 4th grade. <br/>
He&#39;s 14 now. My daughter Casey only went to one year of preschool and <br/>
a tiny specilaized Kindergarten program. She&#39;s 9 now.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do you have high schoolers or have you &quot;graduated&quot; high schoolers?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Conor would be considered high school age for the upcoming school <br/>
year. But we don&#39;t do school years and we won&#39;t do high school. He&#39;ll <br/>
continue on the path of following his interests and learning for the <br/>
sake of knowledge, not to pass a course. He won&#39;t graduate because he <br/>
doesn&#39;t consider learning something that should ever end. He is <br/>
considering Community College at some point during his teen years.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My ds is just beginning to HS. He was in the 7th grade butwould <br/>
 </span></blockquote>like to skip the 8th grade and move on tothe 9th. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s home now. Why not skip the grades altogether and move on to the <br/>
learning? He (and you) will need time to deschool and get used to <br/>
learning in freedom. Have either of you read The Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook by Grace Lewellyn? Lots of great ideas for teens in there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He is very smart but...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Forget the but. Leave it at &quot;He is very smart.&quot; School is not real <br/>
life. What he will do from now on is his real life. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have tried to be flexible with my 7th grader,  but I do tryto get <br/>
 </span></blockquote>him to do some &quot;school work&quot;. He goes back and forth between wanting <br/>
me to give him assignments and telling me I am too pushey. I don&#39;t <br/>
think he is sure what he wants. He certainly has me confused.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is learning totally removed from school. Your son has <br/>
only known school, so he doesn&#39;t remember what learning outside the <br/>
system is like. That may even be true for you as well. I would <br/>
suggest you keep reading here, read at the unschooling.com website <br/>
and also at sandradodd.com. You&#39;ll have lots of time this summer <br/>
where you won&#39;t feel you have to worry about &quot;schooling&quot; him. Use <br/>
that time to get a better understanding of what learning in true <br/>
freedom can look like.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
