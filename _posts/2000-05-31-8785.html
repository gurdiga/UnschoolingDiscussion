<div id="ygrps-yiv-416327892">I think Derek is the ultimate in unschooled but might not appear so to some<br/>
folks.  He has been in and out of ps as the mood takes him (spell that<br/>
competitive sports &lt;g&gt;).  He goes long enough (and on his own terms, poor<br/>
teachers &lt;&lt;&lt;BEWG&gt;&gt;&gt;) to participate in the sport he is interested in at the<br/>
time and then he is back home again.  He is really math and biology minded,<br/>
wants to be a veterinarian, hates reading (doesn&#39;t do the pleasure thing at<br/>
all, just reads to get the info he needs) and has the socialization thing<br/>
down to a fine science (girl friends from several high schools and some<br/>
from as far away as San Diego), has been to several proms (isn&#39;t that one<br/>
of the NEA&#39;s biggest worries) and he and the other kidlets designed a<br/>
t-shirt that reads &quot;The more the NEA talks, the more I know why I love<br/>
homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He takes what he needs or is interested in and does what he feels is in his<br/>
best interest when he goes to ps.  If he finds something to be redundant,<br/>
he doesn&#39;t do it.  He is polite to the teachers about it but, hey, truth is<br/>
truth and he figures they are supposedly adults and should be able to<br/>
handle it (boy has that gotten us some interesting conferences &lt;g&gt;).  I<br/>
guess what bugs them is that even though he won&#39;t do their whole million<br/>
hours of homework thing and has been vocal in his disdain of multiple<br/>
&quot;guess&quot; questions, he maintains A&#39;s and B&#39;s.  They also get hysterical<br/>
because he bounces in and out of the schools and they scream that he is<br/>
ruining his chance of getting a good eduction, that he will never learn<br/>
good study skills, that a child needs continuity, blah, blah, blah.  He<br/>
then points to the grades and says that he thinks they speak for<br/>
themselves.  I should mention that he has given the speech about how grades<br/>
only prove that someone can take a test and that he thinks time could be<br/>
better spent learning because you love knowledge.  Geez, that one really<br/>
got us a ration %-}<br/>

What a smart kid!  I bet the teachers are beside themselves with what to do <br/>

unschooling.  My 12 year old unschooled boy has decided to try school next<br/>
year.  At first I had thought I would make him do school the school&#39;s way,<br/>
if he was going at all.  Now, I&#39;m having second thoughts, and am thinking<br/>
that I&#39;ll just let him unschool at school, much as your son has been doing.<br/>
 It&#39;s great to hear that someone *is* doing it.  Lars has never yet been<br/>
interested in academics (just learned to read this year) so it&#39;s less<br/>
likely that he&#39;ll have the A&#39;s and B&#39;s to point to, but you never know.<br/>
<br/>
One thing is certain.  He&#39;s certainly disproved the myth about homeschooled<br/>
kids not being well socialized.  He went with  his friend to the school<br/>
dance a couple of weeks ago, and then spent 3 days at school last week.<br/>
His friend couldn&#39;t believe how popular he was.  He just fit right in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921742871">We have always explained to Derek what people would expect of him and made<br/>
it very clear what his options were.  He is then given the option of doing<br/>
it his way or doing it &quot;their&quot; way.  We then explained to him what<br/>
unschooling at school would &quot;cost&quot; him.  He went into it with full<br/>
knowledge and I think that made all the difference.  He knew that ps was<br/>
all about producing mounds of paper and testing, testing, testing.  He knew<br/>
that individuals are frowned on and that he would probably be conferenced<br/>
(this ends at the high school level somewhat).  He also knew that I could<br/>
care less about the grades or conferences and that I would support what he<br/>
was doing.  He also understood that if he wanted to get into a college that<br/>
the grades would start counting in the ps world when he entered 9th grade.<br/>
<br/>
I think if your son knows what will happen and that if he chooses not to<br/>
play their game that you will support him, then he&#39;ll do fine.<br/>

conference, then on to a parent/teacher/student conference, next a<br/>

are usually reserved for &quot;incorragible&quot; and &quot;multi-offenders.&quot;  Derek has<br/>
never been CAP&#39;d but he has been to all of the others and has really<br/>
annoyed them by having read all the rules and regs for the district and<br/>
then got himself a copy of the state regs.  And he always brings along his<br/>
report cards which have comments like &quot;he is so polite in class,&quot; &quot;he&#39;s a<br/>
leader,&quot; &quot;his grades are excellent&quot; and so forth and so on.  They, of<br/>
course, always then comment on him &quot;applying himself more to work<br/>
assignments,&quot; which when you get down to it would appear to be answered by<br/>
the A&#39;s and B&#39;s.<br/>
