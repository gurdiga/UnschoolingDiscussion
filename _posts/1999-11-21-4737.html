<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388555793">No, it comes out quite tasty.  You couldn&#39;t slice it for sandwiches, but<br/>
it&#39;s great plain, or dipped into peanut butter, etc.<br/>
I let them play with it as long as they want to.  They usually do a<br/>
variety of &quot;snakes&quot;, balls, or cut out with cookie cutters.  One child<br/>
once made a &quot;person&quot; with a round face, and pieces for hair, eyes, etc. <br/>
I usually bake at 350 for 8 to 12 minutes.<br/>
