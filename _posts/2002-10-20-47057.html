&gt; Spot looks like a mixed cocker to me. His ears aren&#39;t quite big enough for a<br/>
&gt; true cocker spaniel. I think Dick and Jane got him from the pound!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Back in the good old days, when Cockers were bred to do a job of work and it<br/>
was not &quot;showy&quot; and &quot;typey&quot; for them to have the most extremely long ears<br/>
(to get caught on things in the field) and a ridiculous long, soft coat (to<br/>
have brambles stick in and get the dog hung up and later work their way into<br/>
his skin) and tiny little muzzles (useless for actually picking up a<br/>
woodcock and bringing it back), Spot is what real Cockers looked like.<br/>
<br/>
AKC conformation showing encourages breeders (who are human and want to win)<br/>
to produce extreme dogs who most often don&#39;t look like the field versions of<br/>
the &quot;same breed&quot;. Go to a field trial and watch the winning dogs. Go to a<br/>
dog show and look at Best of Breed. Often, they don&#39;t seem to be the same<br/>
species. There are breeds where the breeders do try to &quot;hold it all<br/>
together&quot; and produce working dogs who can also win in the show ring -- the<br/>
vast majority are not successful.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is a point of irritation to me &lt;g&gt;. I have learned to largely get<br/>
over it, but still... I like the dogs in working breeds who can actually<br/>
work, and I think it&#39;s a pity what&#39;s been done to the Cocker and other nice<br/>
little working spaniels.<br/>
