 I&#39;m wondering why this toy is considered offensive? Or more offensive than a <br/>
 regular GI Joe? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my .02.....<br/>
A regular GI Joe is just a figure depicting someone in the military. Just <br/>
like playing with any doll that depicts some line of work, be it a doctor, <br/>
model or Mom.<br/>
But that &quot;house&quot; is depicting a ruined house with weapons and miltary <br/>
paraphenalia all over it. Obviously it was formerly a family home. Kinda sick <br/>
to me when I think of the fact that warfare has killed and destroyed so many <br/>
families and cities.<br/>
Making something that should be taken seriously, into a toy is just making a <br/>
mockery of the seriousness of war.<br/>
That&#39;s totally different to me than my kids playing with toy guns or GI Joes.<br/>
Neither of which they&#39;ve been very fascinated with actually.<br/>
They prefer the medieval weaponry for the most part.<br/>
I think I&#39;d rather have my kids interested in shooting real guns than playing <br/>
with that GI Joe house. That&#39;s just me though.<br/>
War makes me sick to my stomache, real though it may be.<br/>
And just because a person is interested in guns, shooting, weaponry etc... <br/>
that does not equal making a mockery of the seriousness of war and what it <br/>
does to real people, as that toy does.<br/>

<br/>
In &quot;Material World,&quot; there is a Bosnian family, and the photos of their stuff <br/>
and neighborhood and apartment are truly sad, but true.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s better for kids to have the idea that even private homes become <br/>
involved than to have the more sanitized vision of deserts and jungles and <br/>
battlefields away from towns that kids have from many photos of Desert Storm, <br/>
Viet Nam, and WWII.<br/>
