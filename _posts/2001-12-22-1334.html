So frigging what?!?!?!?<br/>

I truly hope I am misunderstanding your meaning here.  It seems on the<br/>
surface to be the same old hypocritical garbage that most people think of<br/>
when they think of Christianity.  Somehow, because these people think of<br/>
Jesus as a prophet rather than part of God, their lives are somehow less<br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
May your God have mercy on you.<br/>

name of the writer, I have no way to go back and see.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us -- me -- are really anal about keeping up with lists &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are. Sandra said the Jews, Muslims and Christians all worshiped the same<br/>
God. Sheila (I think it was) was pointing out Jews and Muslims don&#39;t worship<br/>
Jesus Christ. It was a difference of opinion on whether it was the same God<br/>
or not, not whether one group of people was better or not.<br/>

said &quot;God&quot; I meant God the overall creator/father, not Jesus the incarnation.<br/>
<br/>
And it was about people killing people about religion (to some extent--we <br/>
could say economics and culture, but religion is the excuse/banner in one <br/>
team&#39;s iconography and democracy and freedom are for the other team.  <br/>
