&lt;&lt; hi all.<br/>
 I need a little help.  I am looking for information on th effects of TV.  <br/>
 Anyone know a good place?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Good morning, Julie!  I read a book on the effects of tv earlier this <br/>
spring, called &quot;The Plug-In Drug: Television, Children and the Family&quot; by <br/>
Marie Winn.  It explained how children go into a trance-like state when <br/>
watching, and how people get addicted to it.  Also, it told how watching <br/>
movement on a screen affects eye muscles in a bad way.  It sites statistics <br/>
about how tv watching lowers academic progress, and how it can easily mess up <br/>
family relationships, too.  There is proof that shows like Sesame Street do <br/>
not give children an educ. boost, and, in fact, have found that the fast <br/>
moving format of the show is done deliberately to keep the viewers &quot;glued&quot; to <br/>
the set.  It also showed examples of how and why kids will become so upset <br/>
when unable  to watch tv.  My kids are down to watching a show or two in the <br/>
morning, and something in the evening before going to bed.  Before now, John <br/>
would cry, and want it on all of the time.  ( We have days where he still <br/>
does.)  I make the kids turn it off, and go outside.  There were times that <br/>
John would turn it back on if he thought I would not know!  It is better now, <br/>
but both boys really like tv.  It does not help that my dh also is a big tv <br/>
fan!  On his days off from work, he always seems to have on a tv, and it <br/>
sometimes (a lot, really) gets to me.  I do think there is a time and place <br/>
for tv, but I do not think it needs to be on just  because the set  is in the <br/>
room.  I think my dh is just as hooked as anyone; so we still need to work on <br/>
this issue, as it is hard to implement a rule about tv viewing if the parent <br/>
wants it on all of the time, too.  Even if he goes outside to do something, <br/>
he hardly ever turns off the tv-- it is just on in an empty room!  Now that <br/>
really bugs me!  But, in fairness, it&#39;s always on at his parent&#39;s house, too; <br/>
I am sure he grew up with it on constantly.  To this day, if his parents host <br/>
a holiday dinner, like Thanksgiving, all of the men sit in front of the tv <br/>
and eat!!  Grrr!                                                                <br/>
                          He also likes to bring the kids videos to watch.  <br/>
Again, I think there is a time and place for them, but I don&#39;t want the kids <br/>
watching movies all of the time either.  What gets hard is when I am tired, <br/>
or having to do something, and it can be so tempting to just pop something in <br/>
the vcr and let the tv babysit for me, and I am guilty of this from time to <br/>
time, but I am trying to not do it very often!  Well, I hope you can find the <br/>
book at your library; it&#39;s a worthwhile read. Sorry to have gone on and on, <br/>
but it is really  an issue that I am concerned about.                           <br/>
                                                            Happy reading,      <br/>
                                                                                <br/>
