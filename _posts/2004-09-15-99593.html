normally send.<br/>
<br/>
1) Maybe some of you in that area would be interested<br/>
2) Maybe this is an indicator of what some of the recent undercurrent of <br/>
unhappiness with unschoolers/unschooling as a separate-from-homeschooling thing <br/>
could be related to, for some people.<br/>

Dear School Liberator Subscriber:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Join the best thinkers on education at SepCon2004, <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
          Our theme is <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        GET THE KIDS OUT <br/>
<br/>
       of HARMFUL SCHOOLS!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---Everyone at SepCon is an intellectually honest <br/>
<br/>
---seeker of truth and a source of bold ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
---What a super event!!  <br/>
<br/>
      Dan Engler, former White House writer<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---I liked the variety of speakers from different <br/>
<br/>
---religious points of view. <br/>
<br/>
     John Mark Reynolds, Founder and Director of the <br/>
<br/>
     Torrey Honors Program, Biola University<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---A must for all physicians who truly care  <br/>
<br/>
---about the children under their care. <br/>
<br/>
     Debra Monde, family physician, Florida <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   That&#39;s a sample of the excitement of all who <br/>
<br/>
have attended the four previous &quot;SepCons&quot; <br/>
<br/>
sponsored by the Alliance for Separation of <br/>
<br/>
School & State.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   SepCon2004 is the conference for those who <br/>
<br/>
recognize that school-by-government simply cannot <br/>
<br/>
be reformed. If we are to ever achieve honest <br/>
<br/>
education---where teachers can honestly tell parents <br/>
<br/>
what they are teaching---we must end government<br/>
<br/>
involvement in schooling &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sepcon.org/index.php">http://sepcon.org/index.php</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
vineyards of educational freedom:<br/>

*****<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that if mainstream, lump-&#39;em-all-together conferences include the likes of Mike Farris, I&#39;ll skip them in favor of the unschooling conferences.  I don&#39;t think I could share the same building with his ilk.<br/>
