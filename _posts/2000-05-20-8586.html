<div id="ygrps-yiv-794794907">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
On my way to meet with the head of an alternative school here in Japan, I <br/>
opened the morning paper today and found the following story on the front <br/>
page about *gakkyu hokai* -- classroom collapse or breakdown in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
This article says a lot about where the Japanese Ministry of Education is <br/>
headed with regard to problems in public schools. Parents are even being <br/>
considered to help teachers &quot;in some cases.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lest we think the Education Ministry in Japan is going soft, bear this in <br/>
mind: The educrats here can definitely see the writing on the wall, both <br/>
in Japan and overseas, where the choices of homelearning and alternative <br/>
education are concerned. Since it knows it cannot outright stop people in <br/>
Japan from making these viable choices, the ministry would no doubt like <br/>
to &quot;lead&quot; the public there, rather than finding itself being led by a <br/>
Japanese grassroots movement that rejects school. We&#39;re seeing some signs <br/>
of such ministry intentions already.<br/>
<br/>
A suspicious bunch, those Education Ministry folks. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Teachers told to take team approach, act fast<br/>
to quell &#39;classroom collapse&#39; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Teachers and other adults must take countermeasures at an early stage and <br/>
deal with problems as a group to curb &quot;classroom collapse,&quot; according to <br/>
an Education Ministry report.<br/>
<br/>
The report, compiled by a team from the National Institute for <br/>
Educational Research, examines 150 cases in which elementary school <br/>
classes did not function. These instances were typified by children <br/>
ignoring teachers and being unruly and destructive.<br/>
<br/>
The report concludes that classroom breakdown can occur at any school -- <br/>
regardless of class size, gender of teacher or age of children. However, <br/>
cases were recorded in which chaos was attributed to a sudden rise in <br/>
class size, it says.<br/>
<br/>
Out of 41 cases in which the class numbered more than 36 children, eight <br/>
classes experienced a sudden rise in numbers -- such as from 21 children <br/>
to 40.<br/>
<br/>
The standard class size at public elementary schools is set at 40, which <br/>
means two classes numbering less than 20 children must be merged.<br/>
<br/>
The most common cause of collapse is &quot;teacher incompetence,&quot; typified by <br/>
oppression or failing to listen to children, the report says. Other <br/>
causes include rogue students with difficult home backgrounds misbehaving <br/>
and influencing others. A lack of leadership by principals is also cited.<br/>
<br/>
The report calls for teachers to swiftly deal with even minor problems to <br/>
prevent them from degenerating. It also suggests taking a flexible stance <br/>
in teaching to make studies interesting and understandable to children. <br/>
<br/>
Teachers are also urged to consult with their colleagues when dealing <br/>
with problems, rather than trying to solve them individually.<br/>
<br/>
Citing one successful example in which three teachers taught arithmetic <br/>
to a class of 44 children, the report says, &quot;It is important to make an <br/>
atmosphere where teachers can discuss problems freely with others at <br/>
staff meetings and study groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Team teaching, sending part-time teachers to assist homeroom teachers and <br/>
utilizing school advisers from local education boards would be effective <br/>
ways of helping teachers solve problems, an official said.<br/>
<br/>
The report says schools should maintain close contact with both parents <br/>
and kindergarten teachers in order to understand each child&#39;s background. <br/>
In some cases, direct participation of parents in classroom teaching is <br/>
also effective, the report says, adding that teachers need to change the <br/>
view that they must &quot;control&quot; pupils.<br/>
<br/>
Children must be the main actors in the classroom and teachers should be <br/>
the ones to support children in learning and solving problems by <br/>
themselves, it says.<br/>
