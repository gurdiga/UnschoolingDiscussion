<div id="ygrps-yiv-325368716">Here are some ideas for how you and your children can play with logic  <br/>
and language.   I found an interesting definition.  When you find a  <br/>
definition with a problem or a paradox or oddity, it might be worth  <br/>
talking about it--not in a critical or AHA! way.  Not like the authors  <br/>
were stupid.  But in light of the fact that language makes definitions  <br/>
difficult, and the details and angles of talking about anything will  <br/>
always open up another topic.<br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
Tack is a term used to describe any of the various equipment and  <br/>
accessories worn by horses in the course of their use as domesticated  <br/>
animals. Saddles, stirrups, bridles, halters, reins, bits, harnesses,  <br/>
martingales, and breastplates are all forms of horse tack. Equipping a  <br/>
horse is often referred to as tacking up.<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
Of that first line, I immediately wondered what they were thinking  <br/>
horses might have worn when they weren&#39;t domesticated animals, or  <br/>
what&#39;s being excepted here because it&#39;s only worn by wild horses and  <br/>
so isn&#39;t &quot;tack.&quot;  I&#39;m picturing the wild horse herds dressing up for  <br/>
May Day or the first day of snow, and thinking of all the little girls  <br/>
and all the My Little Ponies and Breyer horses in the whole world.<br/>
<br/>
But then I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not that horses &quot;wear&quot; tack any more than  <br/>
beds &quot;wear&quot; bedclothes.  So the problematical concept there isn&#39;t  <br/>
domestication, but the term &quot;worn.&quot;  And that gets into species  <br/>
slavery or something very philosophical.  Horses don&#39;t &quot;wear&quot; anything  <br/>
their owners don&#39;t inflict upon them, sometimes with the extreme  <br/>
objection of the horse.<br/>
<br/>
So tack is the stuff people put onto horses for one reason or  <br/>
another.   But that&#39;s not true either, because if a horse wears  <br/>
ribbons braided into its mane, that&#39;s neither natural of wild horses  <br/>
nor is it &quot;tack.&quot;  So somewhere in there tack ends and the My Little  <br/>
Pony girls begin again.<br/>
