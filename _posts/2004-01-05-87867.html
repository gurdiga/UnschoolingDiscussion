<div id="ygrps-yiv-545400222">I was telling Logan a few minutes ago that he could go back to wearing underpants since our clothes dryer will be delivered tomorrow. I suggested he go ahead and take off his wet diaper and put some on. I&#39;m talking to him, and he walks away...I said &quot;Logan, are you ignoring me?&quot; and he said &quot;Yes I AM!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
All I could do was laugh..he did go and get underpants by the way....<br/>
