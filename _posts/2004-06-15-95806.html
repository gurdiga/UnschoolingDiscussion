<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329023641">**Nobody can make a judgment call without the opportunity to do so, and <br/>
too many families wait until puberty to let them even try. **********<br/>
<br/>
**What really irks me is that because I let my kids do this, other parents look at me like I&#39;m &quot;white trash&quot;.**<br/>

I think our culture has gotten really extreme.  We seem to put &quot;hovering&quot; and &quot;worrying&quot; up on a pedestal as if they were the finest forms of parenting available.  I&#39;m a natural born worrying-hoverer and even I don&#39;t think the constant supervision and dictating rules is a great approach to parenting.<br/>
<br/>
There was a book that I read about that dealt with the idea that worry is used as a stick to manipulate moms and that moms should worry less, but I didn&#39;t buy or read the book because it seemed to be pushing the agenda that we should worry less about putting kids in daycare.  And that&#39;s not the path I want to go down.  (Wish I could remember the title of the book, though, because the underlying idea is interesting.)<br/>

Exactly.  And its more about protecting the reputation of the parents than it is about helping the children become the best people they can be.<br/>
