&lt;&lt; Math was also my most feared/hated subject in school as a child, and <br/>
 it had nothing to do with looking cute then either. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The point was that it&#39;s how other people LOOk at  you. Math anxiety is ok, <br/>
acceptable and even &quot;cute&quot;.  Others wouldn&#39;t look on you that way if you had <br/>
reading problems though. You&#39;d more likely be shunned in some way.<br/>
It&#39;s not about you TRYING to look cute, it&#39;s about how society percieves it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; acceptable and even &quot;cute&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do see the point, although I&#39;m not really sure about the cute part. <br/>
I know *I* don&#39;t see it that way, and I&#39;m guessing many others don&#39;t, <br/>
so the generalization bothers me a bit.  Perhaps because I find the <br/>
thought of someone perceiving my distaste for math as &quot;cute&quot; somewhat <br/>
insulting- as if I&#39;m feigning helplessness or something. Yuck. <br/>
<br/>
I agree that math anxiety is more likely to be laughed off than <br/>
reading anxiety, but mabye because that&#39;s because it&#39;s more common and <br/>
therefore more easily understood than reading anxiety?<br/>
<br/>
Others wouldn&#39;t look on you that way if <br/>
you had <br/>

tracking the words across the page and says it gives him a headache.<br/>
He is *able* to read when he needs to, but never reads for pleasure, <br/>
and if the print on something is small and close together he has been <br/>
known to hand it to the person next to him and ask them to read it.<br/>
As far as I know he&#39;s never been shunned for it.  <br/>

the throat and one through my nose.  five or six days later when I <br/>
started to recover from that and the MI that followed, I couldn&#39;t <br/>
read because the words would move around.  I ended up having to go to <br/>
an eye specialist.  They had bruised the muscles around my left eye <br/>
while trying to get the nasal tube in.  (the way dh describes it, it <br/>
was pretty brutal.)  Until those muscles healed, my left eye would <br/>
track across a page.  It was one of the most frustrating experiences <br/>
of my life!  If your brother sees like that, I have every bit of <br/>
possible sympathy for him!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993169993">Why? What is AAEN and what&#39;s the difference? I know of LLearners through my<br/>
LeLeche League leader/friend and she doesn&#39;t do anything that&#39;s stressful if<br/>
she can help it! Can you fill me in? And although our children certainly<br/>
aren&#39;t of the same age I would still love to meet you! And you never know,<br/>
your son may not learn anything, but my son would be in heaven to have an<br/>
older boy to interact with!--no pressure though:)<br/>
