<div id="ygrps-yiv-686329304">Hi all,<br/>
My 14yos and 10yos can go for hours(days) playing D & D (with or <br/>
without the neighbor kids depending on school) Magic cards, Warhammer <br/>
and video games.  My 7yo daughter shadows them but will occasionally <br/>
seek me out ( usually because of some real or imagined infraction by <br/>
her brothers) and we chat or eat or play a game or watch a movie etc.<br/>
So I have few questions/concerns for the list...<br/>
Do you worry when one child seems to control the &quot;to do&quot; list of the <br/>
day?  I know for a fact that when the older one is away the middle <br/>
two play well together and do a larger variety of things. <br/>
Do you worry about the tunnel vision of one interfering with the <br/>
others&#39; potential?<br/>
If they were just as busy with a greater variety of things I guess I <br/>
would be less concerned.<br/>
I have separate play groups and activities for my daughter.<br/>
The boys have their own mainly homeschooled group for...you guessed <br/>
it...D & D<br/>
It seems hard to connect with the boys individally and<br/>
I try to have family activities for all of us but this can aggravate <br/>
the oldest as it does not seem to jive with his agenda. <br/>
  <br/>
Anyone have any words of wisdom??<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Beth<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah...D & D is (Dungeons and Dragons a medieval/fantasy role <br/>
playing game)</div>

<br/>
This is where we are also struggling,  we are doing fun things outside or going to concerts and such and my ds(9) would rather just do the PS2.       Do I just let him and he will eventually see what he is missing?  And then I just hope that the jazz band is in town again, or that we&#39;ll have other opportunities?  <br/>
<br/>
I come into conflict with this because I have 2 brothers who were the same way and my mother would just leave them to their own,  well, now as adults they feel like they weren&#39;t ever included?  Feel very isolated from the family, almost unloved.       Maybe my mother just didn&#39;t do enough &#39;with&#39; us so there was no involvement, or enough interaction.  She didn&#39;t know how?  I don&#39;t know.  We were able to watch TV when ever we wanted, but then that&#39;s all we did. And when my kids are there that&#39;s all they do.  I suppose this was neglect?  Again, I don&#39;t know, just thinking on my computer. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is where an addictive personality come into play? <br/>

We have the same sort of problems here, yet we only have 2 kids.  My son Dillon is almost 10 and often seems to already be an adolescent.  He seems angry a lot, asks us to give away his younger sister, Emma, who is 6.  Dillon has always been outgoing, emotional and affectionate and was very needy as a baby.  Now he yells a lot, has trouble with his temper but never hits.  He just flies off into rages, especially towards Emma.  He acts as though we are the enemy and constantly tells us that we just don&#39;t get it.  We continue to tell him that we will not let him speak to us or others in such an ugly voice.  (See why I think he&#39;s hormonal but think it&#39;s too early?)<br/>
<br/>
Not so awfully long ago the kids could play together all day really well.  Now they play together really well about 30% of the day, the rest of the day they are fussing, or Dillon is.  He&#39;s also recently begun watching lots more TV than usual.  He used to watch 1 or 2 shows then shut it off.  Now he will watch all day and even plans his days around favorite shows. There are not any other kids around for them to play with, either together or separately.  We have 1 neighbor close enough to walk but they are rarely home, are in PS.  Their best friends are about 25-30 minutes away (we are in a very rural area of VA) and are siblings also, so it&#39;s hard to let Dillon do things without his sister.  We manage to on occasion, but I realize he&#39;s needs more time away from family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that all of this is normal developmental stuff, sibling stuff.  I just have a problem dealing with it.  I&#39;ve talked to them both, and to him alone, about how we seem unhappy so much these days.  I&#39;ve taught him deep breathing exercises and point out times to use them.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also added stress in our lives since I too broke my leg, and am more needy and unable to take care of things like I usually do.  Mine is the right leg, so I cannot drive which is a big problem.  But Dad has jumped right in to do what I cannot and the kids have really been great helping out.  I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s my leg.....I think it&#39;s Dillon&#39;s personality and his growing up. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas....suggestions?<br/>

No<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then happily go without him.  <br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s SURELY not fair to the younger one to miss a concert OR to be <br/>
stuck with a whining, surly sibling.<br/>

I have been on both ends of this, as a kid and as a mom.<br/>

Kirby went through a very grumpy stage at that point too.  It was HARD.<br/>
Then he was fine for a few years and got kind rasty around 13/14, and now at <br/>
16 he&#39;s SWEET! (Again, for a while, I guess until the urge to move out <br/>
comes...)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Now they play together really well about 30% of the day, the rest of the <br/>
day they are fussing, or Dillon is. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask Dillon to help you plan some days, so that HE will know when and <br/>
how long you and the rest will be out of the house.  During that time he <br/>
could listen to music or have the TV louder, or do whatever uninterrupted <br/>
thing he&#39;s been frustrated about not getting to do, AND he&#39;ll know when he&#39;s <br/>
needing to be more helpful/cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There&#39;s also added stress in our lives since I too broke my leg, and am <br/>
more needy and unable to take care of things like I usually do.  Mine is the <br/>
right leg, so I cannot drive which is a big problem. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an epidemic!!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s my leg.....I think it&#39;s Dillon&#39;s personality <br/>
and his growing up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  <br/>
<br/>
Treat him a little older than he is and see if that works?  (I mean give him <br/>
responsibilities, freedoms, ask his advice.)  If that seems to frustrate him <br/>
more, maybe treat him a little younger?  Maybe do some sweet things for him <br/>
(what you can do with a broken leg), and thank him nicely for whatever you <br/>
CAN thank him for.  Maybe both of those.  Just treat him like the best of <br/>
himself, or like the boy you want him to be, instead of focussing on the <br/>
irritating core or surface (I&#39;ve thought of it as both) of him.<br/>
<br/>
It will pass!!<br/>

I see 2 problems.  <br/>
<br/>
One, our days go mostly unplanned, especially now that I have a bum leg!  Once a week we drive to town, which is over an hour away, for the kids to do music and dance lessons while I visit my Mom.  Other than that our lives are serendipity.  (maybe that&#39;s part of the problem, too little planning???)<br/>
<br/>
And two, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready to leave him at home alone yet...at least for more than 30 minutes or so.  And there&#39;s nothing we can do in that amount of time being so far away from anything.  I have talked my husband into letting him do alot of things recently that he didn&#39;t feel Dillon was ready for, like starting the fire in the woodstove, driving my Walmart electric chair back into the store, etc.  I will have to jump the hurdle of my husband to leave Dillon alone.  But he is maturing and needs to feel like it.  His favorite time is at night when he is the only one up, locking up and turning off lights.  He wants to &quot;teach&quot; his sister things but approaches it in his own &quot;pedantic&quot; way, so she hears nothing :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll talk to my husband more about adding responsibilities and freedoms and see how that goes.  Sounds like you hit it right on.  Last night he fussed at me about not trusting him when we were in Walmart, I should have understood then that he was fussing about more than driving the electric chair.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342473000">My 7 yr old often is in the middle of doing something and does not want to stop when the rest of us want to go for a walk or across the way to Nana&#39;s house. So I let him stay, while we go do whatever. He&#39;s never been left longer than 20 minutes, and I&#39;m almost always within sight of the house. I always tell him which direction I&#39;m going, so he can come get me or join us if he wants to. So far, he&#39;s never done anything he shouldn&#39;t or anything dangerous, and if he keeps it up, I imagine I&#39;d be able to leave him alone for trips to the store, etc in a couple of years. I&#39;d never ask him to be responsible for someone else, though. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102103898">My son is 9, will be 10 in March,  in this last year I have left him alone.  Maybe for an hour or so,  and then I check on him or call him.  He has been great, and very excited about it.  He does know there are things he can do and can&#39;t do.  For example using the stove, answering the door or phone.  (to reach him I&#39;ll call and hang up, call and hang up, four times) I might be anal about that but I feel that he is safer that way.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure when he&#39;ll be responsible enough to watch his sisters,  my 8 yr old dd did stay with him for a little one time and it was OK,  but I think its unfair to him to give him the responsibility for others so young.  Especially when his emotional development seems to be behind his sister&#39;s.  I&#39;m thinking that within 2 years or so they&#39;ll be fine to hang out alone for a little bit, maybe as dh and I go for a short walk to something. <br/>

In some states leaving a child under a certain age is considered neglect.  Posit something happens that requires the child to call the law or upon someone else for help...it could result in some really nasty reprecussions, aside from the originating situation.  <br/>
<br/>
I do agree with you that many 9 or 10 year olds have the ability to remain by themselves, and I wouldn&#39;t feel that uncomfortable leaving a 10 year old (depending on the child natch) for a bit of time.  Just giving you the info, so you can know best how to protect yourself..... (I think that is when we started leaving our children for a bit...and many a babysitter starts babysitting at the age of 11 or 12.)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  My son is 9, will be 10 in March,  in this last year I have left him alone.  Maybe for an hour or so,  and then I check on him or call him.  He has been great, and very excited about it.  He does know there are things he can do and can&#39;t do.  For example using the stove, answering the door or phone.  (to reach him I&#39;ll call and hang up, call and hang up, four times) I might be anal about that but I feel that he is safer that way.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure when he&#39;ll be responsible enough to watch his sisters,  my 8 yr old dd did stay with him for a little one time and it was OK,  but I think its unfair to him to give him the responsibility for others so young.  Especially when his emotional development seems to be behind his sister&#39;s.  I&#39;m thinking that within 2 years or so they&#39;ll be fine to hang out alone for a little bit, maybe as dh and I go for a short walk to something. <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway,  that&#39;s where we are on it.<br/>
<br/>
  Take Care,<br/>

&lt;&lt; My 7 yr old often is in the middle of doing something and does not want to <br/>
stop when the rest of us want to go for a walk or across the way to Nana&#39;s <br/>
house. So I let him stay, while we go do whatever. He&#39;s never been left <br/>
longer than 20 minutes, and I&#39;m almost always within sight of the house. I <br/>
always tell him which direction I&#39;m going, so he can come get me or join us <br/>
if he wants to. So far, he&#39;s never done anything he shouldn&#39;t or anything <br/>
dangerous, and if he keeps it up, I imagine I&#39;d be able to leave him alone <br/>
for trips to the store, etc in a couple of years. I&#39;d never ask him to be <br/>
responsible for someone else, though.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted to stay home as early as six, when I would go to the store which <br/>
was two blocks away.  She LOVED it.  We would discuss where she would go if <br/>
she needed help, and how far to be from the house in emergencies.  Our house <br/>
has four doors to the outside, which makes me feel much better about a kid <br/>
getting out than any two-door house.  She always had phone numbers of people <br/>
she could call if she just wanted to talk to an adult, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I never had one bit of worry or trouble.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607730826">Yeah, now I now who you mean!  I didn&#39;t know his name, but my 11 year old <br/>
daughter is the one who suddenly said (about a month ago) while we were <br/>
watching Harry Potter for the umteenth time &quot;Hey Snape is the same guy from <br/>
Galaxy Quest!&quot;<br/>
Everyone rewound the movie and checked it out.  I couldn&#39;t believe that I <br/>
never caught it before that!  :-)   I with that some other adults could <br/>
realize that our children can teach us a lot of time (or most of the time)  <br/>

&lt;&lt; OK, OK!  I did a  Google Search on him and found out that he&#39;s an actor! I <br/>
promise I won&#39;t ask before I Google again!  And no, I don&#39;t find him <br/>
&quot;letchworthy&quot; (I like that word!) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first couple of movies I saw him in, I had no attraction whatsoever.  <br/>
Robin Hood I honestly could not watch--I went to the lobby and played video <br/>
games, and I&#39;m a lifelong medieval nut.  That is one movie I really, really <br/>
hate.  I guess I need to rent it and just watch the sheriff&#39;s scenes.  But <br/>
that UGLY GUY keeps coming in, that guy they hired who can hardly act.<br/>
<br/>
Dogma, I didn&#39;t like him.<br/>
<br/>
The first time I was really impressed with his acting was Galaxy Quest.  <br/>
After they situation becomes really busy (&#39;the chase scene,&#39; as it were) he <br/>
starts to be the star of the show for a while!!! Stunningly.<br/>
<br/>
And then I started watching more carefully, loved him in Harry Potter, and <br/>
Shyrley&#39;s devotion touched my soul and I thought &quot;If Shyrley feels this str<br/>
ongly about him, there must be something there,&quot; and I looked again with an <br/>
open heart and I guess I&#39;ll join her church.<br/>

Rickman had the best lines too.<br/>

&#39;I&#39;m going to cut his heart out with a spoon!&#39;<br/>
