I know that all three of my kids have written stuff like that online  <br/>
or talked like that for a short time in a group of friends. All got  <br/>
over it pretty fast and they always knew where and when it would be  <br/>
inappropriate. I haven&#39;t given a lot of thought to the reasons why  <br/>
kids do this, but it is my observation that it is very very common  <br/>
and most parents probably never know about it. I&#39;ve heard parents  <br/>
deny that their kid would do it - when I&#39;d READ stuff their kid had  <br/>
written.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173306254">I would have to agree with this assessment.  My daughter also &quot;talks&quot; like this on her online spaces.   I would not say she &quot;got over it quickly&quot; though.  Its been a couple of years.<br/>
<br/>
But my observation is that this is kind of a kid cultural bonding experience and that they truly are embellishing what they write.  We did talk about the fact that other parents read this stuff and that its not really a &quot;private space&quot; as she calls it.<br/>
<br/>
I had a mom call me because she was very upset about what she saw my daughter writing and I pretty much told her the same thing.  Of course, she didn&#39;t agree, but oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I admit, it is distressing to me, but I also think that when she hits 20, and has a job, or a family, it will no longer be an issue.<br/>

like &quot;quickly.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I asked Roxana (18) what she thought about this - she said the mom  <br/>
should be glad that the daughter knows when talking like that is  <br/>
&quot;appropriate&quot; and when it isn&#39;t. She said that kind of talk is  <br/>
ubiquitous on MySpace or LiveJournal - totally &quot;normal.&quot; She also  <br/>
pointed out that it seems like almost everybody has to say something  <br/>
online, that they wish had stayed private, before they learn that no  <br/>
online posting is ever truly private.<br/>

  I&#39;m really really glad this thread came up because like the original poster, I *was* really worried about it.  <br/>
<br/>
  As for xanga, there *are* some really inappropriate pictures on there (like one kid has a picture of his erection on there, bold faced naked).  Well, its nothing my kids don&#39;t know about already.  And its nothing we haven&#39;t talked about before.  And maybe thats good, because my 10 year old was the one who called the police last year (after only just turning 9) when she witnessed her cousin being molested.  In the midst of the moment, she handled the whole situation extraordinarily well, scaring the guy off and getting everyone to safety....and she also successfully prosecuted him.<br/>
<br/>
  The moms who are upset are the ones who have 10 year old and under kids using the sites (because my 10 year old created a website for them, and it may perhaps blow away their innocence.)  I don&#39;t blame them for being upset, but I guess in our family its always been such an open topic and my youngest already knows a lot about the bad language, etc because of her older brother and sister.  There&#39;s more than just bad language though.  The kids often portray themselves as sexually experienced or &quot;gangsta&quot; and comment each other about how they are going to beat each other up.  And my daughter actually has gotten into a couple of fights but nothing too major.  It all seems very immature to me, but then they *are* immature.<br/>
<br/>
  I go through periods where I hear a lot of tapes running in my head.  I wonder sometimes if I&#39;m a terrible parent because I don&#39;t really worry that much about what my kids are saying on there...its not something I take all that seriously.  I told one mom that I don&#39;t take it all that seriously and she about flipped out on me.  I think she really had to bite her toungue.  And then I panic and start to &quot;crack down&quot;.  I told my 13 year old that I don&#39;t want swearing or references to sex on her site because its *not* private and it sends a bad message.  On the other hand, its a rather safe way to try on different identities as long as they know not to meet people in person without discussing it with me or another adult, or make sure they are making safe (public) arrangements, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  And just the other day I told my daughter that she was leaving references to where she would be on Sat nights, along with her picture and that maybe that was too much information.  Anyone could show up claiming to be someone who comments on her site.  I&#39;m sure it will probably be ok, but I was worried she may not have thought it through completely.<br/>
<br/>
  Having read this thread, I&#39;m actually relieved to hear what the 18 year old daughter said, since my gut agrees with her.  I really do worry that if I make an issue of it, it may become a &quot;self fulfilling prophecy&quot; and my daughter will stop talking to me.  And that would be worse than having the stuff there and guiding her through it. <br/>
<br/>
  Whatever she may be writing on the xanga, she does care about what others think.  Just last night she was trying on a new look and asked my opinion.  She wants to look &quot;preppy&quot; but when she uses clothes that are too small for her, it gives a bad impression.   She actually did take my advice and changed clothes and we agreed that the look she wanted was a great look, but that she needed to get new clothes to accomplish it without the &quot;hooker&quot; overtones :o).<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m glad she took my advice and it just goes to show me that whatever she is writing on her xanga, she really does care about herself and she does take what how I feel into some consideration.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For a while Holly had said she was 17 at MySpace because she wasn&#39;t  <br/>
sure where the age cutoff was for people to see her photos.  And she  <br/>
had a name there for a while that was &quot;Hollywould&quot; which she saw as  <br/>
just spelling humor.  When I explained to her that it would be better  <br/>
not to have what some people would see as suggestive, she was half  <br/>
embarrassed that she hadn&#39;t thought about it that way, and half  <br/>
resentful that she had to be so careful because some people are  <br/>
nasty.   But she changed it to &quot;Kirby&#39;s Sister&quot; which is amusing to  <br/>
Kirby&#39;s friends, and a kind of definite &quot;back off&quot; to anyone who  <br/>
might think she&#39;s young and unattended.  She changed her age to 80  <br/>
for a while (I suggested something that was an obvious lie, not a  <br/>
possible purposeful misrepresentation), and then changed it to 14.   <br/>
So now people can&#39;t see anything but the beginning part of her page  <br/>
unless they&#39;re her &quot;friends&quot; (mutual agreement to link).<br/>
<br/>
If parents attempt to prevent kids from seeing what other teens are  <br/>
doing, the kids will likely imagine worse than it actually is.  And  <br/>
if parental attempt fails, kids have to be sneaky.  If parental  <br/>
attempt succeeds, kids lose the opportunity to learn to sort other  <br/>
kids out when they&#39;re all 14, and if they come into the whole teen  <br/>
scene at 17 or 18 and in person, and haven&#39;t had the opportunity to  <br/>
see how some kids posture and bullshit, and how others are  <br/>
responsible and kind, they&#39;re likely to make some honestly horribly  <br/>
bad mistakes:  non-virtual mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has an offensive, stupid online friend that won&#39;t lead to  <br/>
drugs or pregnancy.   They should experiment with some stupidity from  <br/>
the safety of your home, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a teen we only had school and clubs and church as places  <br/>
to see other kids show their true colors, and we were VERY very often  <br/>
separated from our homes and parents by circumstances, distance,  <br/>
time, work hours, etc.  I have been &quot;stuck&quot; with boys I didn&#39;t trust  <br/>
in various ways and places, but I was &quot;where I was supposed to be,&quot;  <br/>
and assumed to be safe.<br/>
<br/>
When people express fear about online exchanges and webpages, I  <br/>
picture it side-by-side with all I knew and saw from Jr. High and  <br/>
High School.  I am assured from all sources that school is MUCH  <br/>
rougher and more dangerous and less chaperoned now than it was in  <br/>
former decades.   Our kids are not involved in that.<br/>
<br/>
And up another tangent:  Holly showed me her myspace page as she made  <br/>
it.  Every time she makes a change to it she shows me, not because I  <br/>
would make her do it, but because she&#39;s excited about the kinds of  <br/>
tricks she&#39;s learned to put music and links and art on it.  And when  <br/>
she gets a new friend she gets excited, and will show me those.   <br/>
Marty made me a friend first (I have two friends on myspace:  Marty  <br/>
and Holly &lt;g&gt;), and has gotten me to help him get photos to use  <br/>
(Kirby has too).   Because they&#39;re showing me voluntarily, I didn&#39;t  <br/>
have to sneak to see.<br/>
<br/>
If a child isn&#39;t volunteering that and the parent sneaks to see,  <br/>
there is still some sneakiness going on.  I looked at some  <br/>
livejournal stuff that was on the desktop in years past, and saw a  <br/>
few things I wished I hadn&#39;t.  Nothing horribly immoral; nothing  <br/>
illegal.  Just posturing and angst by kids I knew well.  It didn&#39;t  <br/>
hurt them for me to see it, and it didn&#39;t hurt me, but I felt a  <br/>
little peeping-tomish.<br/>

clothes are just clothes and make-up is just make-up and hair grows  <br/>
back and it is easy to insult our kids - when they ask for our  <br/>
opinion they can still get their feelings hurt. We say, &quot;Well the  <br/>
shirt is a little tight,&quot; and they can hear, &quot;You&#39;re too fat,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;You have bad taste.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Hair grows back&quot; has had to be my mantra.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had waist-length hair when he asked me to cut it three years ago <br/>
—all off.<br/>
<br/>
Marty had me shave his head for three years; then he let it grow and  <br/>
it was curly and pretty, and then he got a grocery-store job and off  <br/>
it went.<br/>
<br/>
Holly...   well...<br/>
Half of Holly&#39;s hair is shaved off and the other half is shoulder  <br/>
length, and she took the shaved half out of the middle.<br/>
<br/>
Hair grows back.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly&#39;s wearing something potentially questionable, I think  <br/>
about where she will be going (if anywhere) before I comment on it.    <br/>
Sometimes it doesn&#39;t matter.  And I&#39;ve known adults who were  <br/>
constrained in what they wore by parents or Catholic school or  <br/>
whatever, who when they moved away went CRAZY and bought expensive  <br/>
nasty clothes, heels, nasty underwear, expensive nails and mail-up,  <br/>
and never looked back to even WONDER if it was okay, because in their  <br/>
families they had been told that all that was only for adults, or for  <br/>
sinners, and so when they broke loose of the bonds, they flung  <br/>
themselves WAY, way away.<br/>
<br/>
Letting Holly do a touch of Brittany Spears when she was too young to  <br/>
have a clue (and she was with us, or her brothers, or other families— <br/>
not walking alone to a bus stop) let her get it out of her system.   <br/>
Letting her wear makeup when she was ten let her not have any  <br/>
interest in it now that she&#39;s 14.  I waited, and waited, and WAITED  <br/>
to be 15 so I could wear makeup and get my ears pierced, so by GOD I  <br/>
wore makeup.  (Not for long, but the waiting was ridiculous.  If I  <br/>
could&#39;ve gotten over the urge with kid-stuff or borrowed mom-stuff I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have spent my own teen money on it.  I still remember some  <br/>
irridescent orangish kind of lipstick, purported to be what the cool  <br/>
girls were wearing in London.  GROSS!)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I guess you could say we live by principles, not rules when it comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; to swearing in our house.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ====================<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Could you expand on that, please?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll try.  You tell me if I get it. :)  <br/>
What I mean is that we don&#39;t have a rule about swearing, but we<br/>
generally don&#39;t swear in our family.  (I won&#39;t say never. You might,<br/>
once and a great while, hear a well placed SH**!! here or there.)<br/>
  <br/>
Until recently, I hadn&#39;t thought about implied rules, or rules that<br/>
she assumes are in place. And even if it&#39;s a principle, won&#39;t she<br/>
still feel sneaky? <br/>
<br/>
  I might add that, although we&#39;ve never consciously implemented  any<br/>
rules per se, she&#39;s always been a great rule follower and has prided<br/>
herself on it. I&#39;ll try to explain. Example: When she was younger and<br/>
knew she shouldn&#39;t ride her bike in the street, she would make sure<br/>
everyone that rode bikes with her also stayed on the sidewalk, and got<br/>
angry if they didn&#39;t.  I wish I could remember now how I handled it<br/>
then, because though I&#39;ve always leaned toward a RU parenting style, I<br/>
didn&#39;t then have the insights and information that I do now.  (I<br/>
imagine I would&#39;ve told her how great that was that she stayed on the<br/>
sidewalk and that I was proud of her.)  She has a strong sense of<br/>
&quot;doing what&#39;s right&quot;  and doesn&#39;t always know for herself what that is. <br/>
<br/>
 So, I&#39;ve often wondered in my inner battles, if there are some kids,<br/>
my dd included, who like the safety and boundaries of rules and of<br/>
knowing that they&#39;re doing the &quot;right&quot; thing.  I worry that if I tell<br/>
her it&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; to swear online but there may be consequences,<br/>
(friend&#39;s parent seeing it and passing judgement, for example) that<br/>
she&#39;ll feel (I&#39;m struggling with the right words here) maybe lost<br/>
or even overwhelmed by the responsibility it gives her? For<br/>
her it seems easier to just have a rule to go by. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, more explanation needed again. (Sorry) She often has a hard time<br/>
with too many choices and making decisions. She frequently asks me to<br/>
make decisions for her.  When instead I try to help her realize the<br/>
best decision for herself she&#39;ll get angry and tell me to &quot;just tell<br/>
me what to do!&quot;  The funny thing is that, more times than not, when I<br/>
tell her my opinion, she&#39;ll do the other thing!  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve got millions of different issues I want to address here, <br/>
but this was long enough for now.  I will add that she&#39;s my only child<br/>
(my husband has 2 older- dd & ds ) she&#39;s been attatchement parented,<br/>
(nursed well past school age, family bed even now for the most<br/>
part)and has never been to school, but is now wondering what it&#39;s like<br/>
and wants to try it. (Another post for another day!)  <br/>
Thanks so much for your time and insights.</div>
