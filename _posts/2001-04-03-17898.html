<div id="ygrps-yiv-850894780">Hi Bobbie,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to hear about another person with Melaleuca.  I&#39;ve been a<br/>
customer for 5 years and I&#39;m a Director 2, earning about $500 a month.<br/>
Since I&#39;m 4&#39; 9&quot; and my husbands was always the shortest in his class<br/>
(he&#39;s 5&#39;9&quot; now) much son is on the short end.  He&#39;s actually solid<br/>
muscle, though my mom might call him a skinny boy.  A father was telling<br/>
someone that he could guess any child&#39;s age correctly now that he was a<br/>
parent and pointed to my son and said she was 5.  I turned around and<br/>
said, &quot;Sorry, he&#39;ll be 7 years old near the end of May.&quot;<br/>

<div><font face="Pooh">We used to order from Melaleuca too. But since the move 
from Washington to Montana and a much lower income, I haven&#39;t been able to order 
anything. I don&#39;t even have the information anymore. Maybe some day we can order 
from them again. I do like their antiseptic products...though Naomi hates the 
smell of the oil. LOL!</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44680697">well, I am not &quot;in&quot; melaleuca right now...couldn&#39;t<br/>
afford it. :) But I buy the products when I can from<br/>
others I know who are in it sometimes. Haven&#39;t for a<br/>
really long time, though. Heeh, though I&#39;m just now<br/>
finishing up a bottle of oil that we still had from<br/>
teh dayz when we stockpiled all teh products...mom<br/>
still has some lotion in the older packaging, I think.<br/>
:)<br/>
And cool beans for another short family. That&#39;s us. I<br/>
was so happy when I outgrew my oldest sister at 4&#39;<br/>
11&quot;, and my dad&#39;s mom was about your height. Though my<br/>
boyfriend is not my kids father (my ex husband was 5&#39;<br/>
10&quot;), he is kinda short for a guy, I&#39;m told (who knows<br/>
or cares what &quot;average&quot; is...and so me and my kids and<br/>
him make a cute little short family. :)<br/>
My son was born in May, too, btw. Co-ink-i-dinks are<br/>
everywhere.<br/>
