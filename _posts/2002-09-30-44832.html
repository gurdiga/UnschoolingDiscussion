<br/>
I&#39;m not going through all of what my dog ate, and I don&#39;t think I want to find out what all your dogs ate, but it can be pretty yucky!  But that&#39;s what dogs do for their young&#39;uns...<br/>
<br/>
Weird story..don&#39;t know if I should share...but when my dog was a pup, almost ten years ago, he was playing with my son and jumped on his back...unfortunately he banged my son&#39;s head smack into the corner of the woodwork and we had to go have his head stitched...blood on the floor and I didn&#39;t have time to clean it up, but fully expected the dog to while we were gone.<br/>
<br/>
Well, get home and the floor is still a mess, but once the dog saw our son, he cleaned it up!  I really got the feeling that he was waiting to know that my child was okay!  <br/>
<br/>
Okay,  I know that is anthropomorphism, but heck, it seems to fit.<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

  &gt; My dog ate cat barf once but that&#39;s probably not the same thing, huh?<br/>
