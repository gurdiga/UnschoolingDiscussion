I loved this.  I am this morning way cool because I got a music clip in my <br/>
&quot;boring&quot; e-mail.  I played it at top volume for all to enjoy.  I just wanted to <br/>
share the way they share with me &lt;VBG&gt;.<br/>
Actually I really liked it.  Will share it with my CD recording guru, my <br/>
17yods, who has stared a business recording CD demos for his garage band friends <br/>
in our basement.  <br/>
Thanks for the jolly,<br/>
Beth<br/>
mother, to 5 teens and a 10 yo wanna-be, who often feels hopelessly <br/>
outnumbered and way uncool<br/>
