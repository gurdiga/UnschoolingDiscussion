<div id="ygrps-yiv-929771935">It&#39;s possible.  It takes some creative time management and in some cases some support from other family members, but it is possible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put it to you bluntly...we&#39;re poor.  Dirt poor.  We make it work somehow each day and the key is...we&#39;re all happy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in school and my husband works as a house painter...money is tight and I have to work classes around other people&#39;s schedules.  I think it&#39;s easier having them home than it would be if they were in school, still, though.<br/>

Lots of families have parents who both work full time and homeschool. Lots of <br/>
families have just one parent and s/he works and homeschools. It works. I <br/>
guess I don&#39;t understand what you mean by run-down areas. IMHO it really doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter where you live, does it? We live in a little house, in a poor <br/>
neighborhood, on less than $35,000 a year. (and that is a good, rich year for us!) And <br/>
who hasn&#39;t heard the story of the kid who was homeless, homeschooled out of <br/>
his car and went on to college? There are solutions to everything, obstacles can <br/>
be overcome, mountains scaled, rivers bridged, homeschooling is easier than <br/>
either of those. <br/>

I don&#39;t know that parents who would chose to work around the clock would make <br/>
good unschooling parents, but maybe if there was an interested grandparent <br/>
around. &lt;g&gt;  As far as *run-down* areas go, I live in a very run-down area in <br/>
the middle of a city, and I have no problem unschooling.  I don&#39;t understand how <br/>
where you live could prohibit unschooling.<br/>

care giver (such as a grandparent or another mother). It&#39;s important, imo, for kids to have <br/>
someone involved in their daily lives to support and facilitate their interests and passions <br/>
(and to simply be someone who can drive, provide or discuss).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what a run down area has to do with anything, but maybe someone else does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994817383">By &quot;round the clock&quot; do you mean people like firemen who are away from <br/>
home for 24-hour stretches, or perhaps shift workers with rotating <br/>
shifts? If the kids are young, someone has to be available to take care <br/>
of them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If a parent is not available <br/>
someone else must take care of them, either a friend or family member or <br/>
paid helper. School is often seen as a solution to this problem, but <br/>
would not be effective for 24-hour care.<br/>
<br/>
People who live in run-down areas are frequently better off <br/>
homeschooling as the schools in those areas are often much worse than <br/>
the schools many of us on the list are avoiding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure this addresses what the questioner meant, but it&#39;s as close <br/>
as I could come.<br/>
<br/>
When I became a single parent, my sister helpfully suggested that now <br/>
may be a good time to consider putting my son in kindergarten rather <br/>
than hiring child care to come to my home on weekends only, and working <br/>
only those two days a week. I asked her exactly how that would help, <br/>
since I would now have to arrange before school care, care for my <br/>
4-year-old, transportation to and from school, care for snow days and <br/>
vacation days, and I&#39;d STILL have to work some weekends and arrange care <br/>
for that. School is not the be-all and end all for child care issues.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about this since we have just been approved for a<br/>
pretty small loan and begun house hunting in Los Angeles. Many (but not all)<br/>
of the areas that we could afford to buy might be termed run-down. Perhaps<br/>
the writer is thinking of the parks being scarce or with dangerously old<br/>
equipment? Maybe it has to do with there being bars on all the windows, and<br/>
clearly broken down cars in the street, and lots of gang graffiti on the<br/>
road signs, and little shrines on the streets because of drive by shootings.<br/>
Maybe it is the fear that if your kid is playing in the front yard she might<br/>
get in the way of a bullet. This happens in parts of LA often enough to be<br/>
very discouraging. <br/>

Pardon my ignorance.  Would you mind sharing how a family of 6 gets by on less than $10,000 a year?  I think the information would be very helpful to know when having discussion with those who feel they never have enough.  <br/>

This is likely to turn into something best discussed on other forums.   Let&#39;s <br/>
do it lightly but move back toward unschooling, and if anyone wants to share <br/>
sites where money-saving pointers are, that would be cool too.    But <br/>
obviously, people need to live where rent isn&#39;t $1200 a month to even begin, and I <br/>
know there are families here living in high-rent cities (literally and <br/>
figuratively).<br/>

<br/>
I find that very intriguing! We&#39;ve just been doing some budgeting and <br/>
realized we are spending more than that a year on travel to different places and <br/>
things of interest that Cait wants to experience.  I know we could probably just <br/>
cut out the travel and hotels and events and save money while learning the same <br/>
things through pictures, books and movies and such but I wonder if it would <br/>
be the same?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because of the recent budget discussions here, I&#39;m more aware of what <br/>
we spend on art supplies, costumes, sports equipment, glitter, glue, paint and <br/>
such, all the things that Cait requests for her learning... <br/>
<br/>
It seems almost impossible that a family of SIX could live on 10,000 a year.  <br/>
I don&#39;t doubt you at all, I would like to know if you could send some tips <br/>
and hints for unschooling on a budget?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind sharing.  I receive $300 child support every other week.  I live <br/>
in an urban housing project in a small 3 bdr. townhome.  My rent is <br/>
$300(includes all utilities) and one child support check each mo. goes to that.  The <br/>
other $300 is divided close to this: $100 food, $100 Emily (she takes voice and <br/>
ballet lessons and pays for those out of this as well as buying a few new <br/>
clothes and sometimes goes somewhere w/friends that costs money), $30 phone, $30 <br/>
internet, $40 everything else (money for the other kids, sometimes clothes, <br/>
cleaning supplies, hygiene stuff...)  We get most of our clothes from <br/>
hand-me-downs from friends and relatives.  We eat very simply.<br/>
<br/>
Twice a year there will be a month with 5 Fridays when we get an extra check. <br/>
 We use this money for holiday expenses, doing fun stuff, *special* clothes, <br/>
and ordering stuff from *learning* catalogs.  We also get $500 when my <br/>
ex-husband files his tax return, and we use this money in a similar manner...all <br/>
deciding together how to spend it.<br/>
<br/>
The kids ask for money, video games, DVD&#39;s, and CD&#39;s from their various <br/>
relatives at holiday times.  I ask for family memberships to the zoo and science <br/>
museum.  We have a great library system and can get nearly any DVD&#39;s, videos, <br/>
and CD&#39;s as well as books that we want.  Occasionally we use the bus to go <br/>
somewhere, but most the places we go are within walking distance so we don&#39;t have <br/>
many transportation expenses.<br/>
  <br/>
The children stay with their dad and stepmom every other weekend, and because <br/>
he has a car this gives them a chance to go places they wouldn&#39;t be able to <br/>
otherwise (beaches, nature preserves, daytrips to other cities.)<br/>
I hope this helps.   :)<br/>

I feel that I can certainly offer my kids as many opportunities as I could if <br/>
they were in school, and I worked full-time.  Sometimes I feel limited.  I <br/>
like to travel, and I like to visit the country (grew up in an extremely rural <br/>
area and sometimes miss it).  But I don&#39;t think my kids feel limited.  We talk <br/>
about if I should get a job so we would have more money, and they look at me <br/>
as if I were crazy.  Their opinion is that we have plenty of money.  We do <br/>
handle our money well and prioritize.  Emily is starting a job in a couple of <br/>
weeks and has agreed to add her extra money back into the family&#39;s (her idea not <br/>
mine.)  I think we are all feeling a bit rich at the prospect!  I am glad that <br/>
my kids are growing up learning that you can find a way live on less money.  <br/>

There were a couple of questions like this in the pending posts. I&#39;ve let one <br/>
through and deleted the other.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than discuss this here, are there other websites or discussion groups <br/>
anyone here knows of where we can refer people  who are interested in cooking <br/>
less expensively?<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s post a few resources and get back to unschooling, please.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

We just viewed a movie last evening, &quot;The Other Side of Heaven,&quot; where the defining moment for me was the final statement when the missionary returns home to the US in the 1950&#39;s after three years in the Tonga Islands and comments how the people he was with in the S. Pacific have nothing in the ways of the materials of the US but are the happiest people he has had the privilege of knowing.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;Would you mind sharing how a family of 6 gets by on less than $10,000 a <br/>
  year?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t mind sharing.  I receive $300 child support every other week.  I live <br/>
  in an urban housing project in a small 3 bdr. townhome.  My rent is <br/>
  $300(includes all utilities) and one child support check each mo. goes to that.  The <br/>
  other $300 is divided close to this: $100 food, $100 Emily (she takes voice and <br/>
  ballet lessons and pays for those out of this as well as buying a few new <br/>
  clothes and sometimes goes somewhere w/friends that costs money), $30 phone, $30 <br/>
  internet, $40 everything else (money for the other kids, sometimes clothes, <br/>
  cleaning supplies, hygiene stuff...)  We get most of our clothes from <br/>
  hand-me-downs from friends and relatives.  We eat very simply.<br/>
<br/>
  Twice a year there will be a month with 5 Fridays when we get an extra check. <br/>
  We use this money for holiday expenses, doing fun stuff, *special* clothes, <br/>
  and ordering stuff from *learning* catalogs.  We also get $500 when my <br/>
  ex-husband files his tax return, and we use this money in a similar manner...all <br/>
  deciding together how to spend it.<br/>
<br/>
  The kids ask for money, video games, DVD&#39;s, and CD&#39;s from their various <br/>
  relatives at holiday times.  I ask for family memberships to the zoo and science <br/>
  museum.  We have a great library system and can get nearly any DVD&#39;s, videos, <br/>
  and CD&#39;s as well as books that we want.  Occasionally we use the bus to go <br/>
  somewhere, but most the places we go are within walking distance so we don&#39;t have <br/>
  many transportation expenses.<br/>
    <br/>
  The children stay with their dad and stepmom every other weekend, and because <br/>
  he has a car this gives them a chance to go places they wouldn&#39;t be able to <br/>
  otherwise (beaches, nature preserves, daytrips to other cities.)<br/>
  I hope this helps.   :)<br/>

I have lots more to share but this is probably not the<br/>
