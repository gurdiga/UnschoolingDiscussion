<div id="ygrps-yiv-624529793">***Don&#39;t you want the children to WANT to learn to<br/>
read because the stuff out there is cool??***<br/>
<br/>
Why else would they want to read?<br/>
  <br/>
The reason my children use bob books and other early reading tools *is* because they want to learn to read, and as quickly as possible.  Do you really think that kids who happily use bob books on their road to reading are doing so because the bob books are interesting in and of themselves?  No... they are a means to an end.<br/>
If my children weren&#39;t so interested in learning to read, the bob books would have had no appeal at all.  And the reason they want to learn to read is because &quot;stuff out there is cool,&quot; and sometimes their mother&#39;s voice gives out.  <br/>
<br/>
The complaints about bob books are striking me as very reactive to school rather than separate from school.<br/>
I have a friend that&#39;s so caught up in anti-schoolness that she wants to make it a point this year to plan events for homeschoolers that specifically could not be done by school groups.  When I told her that was totally reactive she got offended, but it&#39;s true.  Why not do what you want, or read what you want, or learn how you want, without worrying about whether it&#39;s too schooly, or whether it&#39;s been done in school or by people who went to school?  <br/>
Throwing out early readers because someone had a bad experience being forced to use them is kind of like throwing out the baby with the bathwater to me.<br/>

could not be done by school groups.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is it that she wants to avoid running into school groups, or is it a <br/>
celebration of the expansion of her learning universe?  That would make a <br/>
difference to me.<br/>
<br/>
My anti-schoolness would lean more toward having NO group outings with other <br/>
families.  But on the other hand, living in a non-industrial place, I love <br/>
factory tours.  And some places deal with groups only, or give a discount to <br/>
groups (the aquarium/biopark here) and so sometimes it&#39;s worth all meeting at <br/>
once to get in, but not necessarily staying together.<br/>

A written book report with an upper righthand block that says<br/>
              Holly Dodd<br/>
              English, Mrs. Dodd<br/>
              September 16, 2002<br/>
is too schooly for me.  <br/>
<br/>
If the purpose and form of the &quot;work&quot; is school specific and doesn&#39;t exist <br/>
outside of school, then I think that&#39;s a reason to avoid it in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If a child WANTED to do that, for fun, an exercise in playing school, then <br/>
fine.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Throwing out early readers because someone had a bad experience being <br/>
forced to use them is kind of like throwing out the baby with the bathwater <br/>
to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would the early readers be the baby or the bathwater?<br/>
<br/>
Women were advised to douche early and often for years.  Lots of our <br/>
grandmothers had those hot water bottle things hanging near the tub.  Vinegar <br/>
and water, or worse.  THEN people figure out that there&#39;s a mucous membrane <br/>
situation and a bacterial environment that would have been better off NOT <br/>
being stripped out that way.  Huh.  How much money was spent doing something <br/>
that was not healthy or productive?    So that was some bathwater worth <br/>
disposing of.<br/>
<br/>
And to the &quot;bad experience&quot; part, another story.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom has gone through two periods in her life when she wasn&#39;t drinking <br/>
much.  Once was when I was in elementary and we had moved away from her <br/>
relatives to northern New Mexico.  The drinking gradually picked up until it <br/>
was bad when I was in high school.  She quit again when Kirby was a baby, <br/>
with AA, and stayed sober 9 years.  That was so she could regain custody of <br/>
my younger half-brother.  <br/>
<br/>
When I say to other friends of mine, &quot;It&#39;s a problem that you drink so much.  <br/>
You should try not to do that to your family,&quot; they invariably say &quot;OH, <br/>
Sandra, this is personal with you, because your mom&#39;s an alcoholic.&quot;   Or <br/>
they&#39;ll say to others, &quot;You know how Sandra is about alcohol, because of her <br/>
mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If my mom were the only alcoholic who&#39;s ever terrorized the neighborhood, set <br/>
a house on fire, run a car into a ditch and lied about it or passed out in a <br/>
red ant bed, then yes.  It would be a total aberration and MY personal <br/>
problem.  But there is a pattern, and there is a principle.  People with <br/>
children should not be &quot;practicing acoholics&quot; if they can find any fortitude <br/>
within them to stop.   Regardless of whether my mom had never been born or if <br/>
she gets on a poster for &quot;alcohol is glamorous,&quot; it causes more damage than <br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
So when I read just &quot;because someone had a bad experience with them,&quot; it <br/>
reminds me of that.  If &quot;someone&quot; had a bad experience with school, you can <br/>
surely multiply that by millions.<br/>
<br/>
Here I have used an extreme example again.  But just as with proportions the <br/>
small-measure ones might not show, and so a larger model often illustrates <br/>
relationships more clearly than something measured in grains or parts of <br/>
seconds.<br/>

<br/>
I think coercion/force is the issue more than the easy readers, and many people associate the easy readers with force- hence the bad feelings about them. <br/>
<br/>
***Is it that she wants to avoid running into school groups, or is it a <br/>

Both, I think.<br/>

<br/>
My friend wouldn&#39;t like that you have to be a part of a group to get a discount (that&#39;s so school-minded!) and refuse to go.<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine my kids wanting to do a book report, so for us it would be part of the bathwater.  That&#39;s my favorite thing about unschooling- picking and choosing what works for individuals.  A person who wanted to be a book reviewer might want to write book report type things.<br/>
<br/>
***&quot;someone&quot; had a bad experience with school, you can <br/>

<br/>
For sure.  But you&#39;re talking about the whole package of school, not just the various bits and parts.  <br/>
Yes, easy readers can be found in school, but so can regualar books like Charlotte&#39;s Web and Harry Potter.  I remember eating ice cream sandwiches in the cafeteria in elementary school and to this day I still love them.  If I was so school phobic that I wanted my kids to have nothing to do with things found in schools I&#39;d have to get rid of many of our favorite novels, lots of sports equipment, all of our paper, paints and writing tools.    That would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rain liked to have me read books to her once, and then she would take<br/>
them and read them herself. That&#39;s what she wanted with the Bob books and<br/>
with many short books after that - that was a big part of her method in<br/>
learning to read. I still don&#39;t know at what point she was memorizing and<br/>
at what point she was reading, and it didn&#39;t ever really matter to me. I<br/>
don&#39;t think she did much sounding out, either - she read by memorizing<br/>
lots of words, and them intuited the rules of phonics much later. It was<br/>
a very private process, though, often she would leave the room and I&#39;d<br/>
see her just surrounded with a stack of picture books, figuring something<br/>
out. When she started to write she did some of the same stuff - rather<br/>
than ask how to spell a word (although she did that too) she&#39;d go and get<br/>
a book or a card or comic that she knew had that word in it, and copy it<br/>
out of there. Because she didn&#39;t read phonetically, writing phonetically<br/>
was very laborious for her and this was easier. <br/>
<br/>
We found an older ex-school textbook reader at a thrift store when she<br/>
was 4 that was all short plays, and she loved that one, too (she also<br/>
acted out the Bob books). Oh, and comic books - she started loving the<br/>
Archies at around 5 or so, reading some words and figuring out the rest<br/>
from the pictures... and she still loves Archies today, if I&#39;m wanting to<br/>
bring her a small treat it&#39;s often a new Archies.<br/>
<br/>
Rain spent a few months in a Montessori kindergarten where most of the<br/>
kids were reading aloud from the Bob books every day, but she was doing a<br/>
series of readers, maybe Bank Street? *That* was a whole different story,<br/>
that was awful - she couldn&#39;t stand the books, she hated being made to<br/>
read them aloud every day. And I&#39;m sure the kids there who were reading<br/>
the Bob books had a totally different experience with them than she&#39;d<br/>
had, they became instruments of torture just like those damn Bank Street<br/>
readers. <br/>

sometimes chose to do things that I associated so much with school and<br/>
coercion, stuff I thought no one would do if they had the option not to.<br/>
Learning cursive was one thing (although learning cursing didn&#39;t surprise<br/>
me :-). Doing pages of addition problems was another, and also that same<br/>
ClueFinders 3rd Grade Adventure game Mary mentioned, which is full of<br/>
traditional school-type stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Our almost-13 yr old unschooled neighbor decided to join the school<br/>
district&#39;s independent study program this fall, which both Rain and his<br/>
older brother can&#39;t even imagine wanting to do. He&#39;s working on his<br/>
second essay on an assigned topic, he has a weekly math class and math<br/>
homework, a biology textbook - the whole shebang. He appears tickled by<br/>
the whole thing, just having a ball. Some of us doubt he&#39;ll be doing it<br/>
in a month or two, we figure the fun may wear off - but it&#39;s certainly<br/>
interesting for all of us.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Reading is a big deal in our culture whether the parents make it so or <br/>
not.  Could you imagine trying to function as an adult if you couldn&#39;t read?  <br/>
Even though ideally there is no pressure on an unschooling child and the <br/>
parents are totally relaxed and &quot;no big deal&quot; about reading, it&#39;s plain <br/>
obvious that it *is* a big deal and it does make life easier.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have done everything in my power to counter those views.<br/>
Reading is ultimately an important tool...but only a tool.<br/>
That&#39;s why my nine year old is not that interested in reading yet, and does <br/>
not feel pressure nor think it&#39;s more important than other things he does.<br/>
I doubt very much that even if I still had easy readers on the shelf (well, <br/>
actually we do have easy readers, just not the bob book type that are so <br/>
obviously to &quot;make&quot; a person able to read)  that he&#39;d choose those books over <br/>
all the other stuff we have available.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot; If my new to reading child came up to me and said &quot;Mom I just read this <br/>
whole book&quot; I&#39;d never say &quot;big deal&quot; or &quot;but honey, that&#39;s just an early <br/>
reader... you might not *really* read for years.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that I would do this? If so, you&#39;re not understanding my point <br/>
at all.<br/>
I don&#39;t think my child would pick those up given the awesom array of cool <br/>
books he has available.<br/>
And he has no pressure of any kind to &quot;get&quot; reading quickly. He&#39;s nine, the <br/>
next child is five...neither of them have ever shown interest in anything dry <br/>
and boring yet.<br/>
If they did we&#39;d have em!<br/>
There is no pressure nor high praise in this home for reading a bob book.<br/>
I am just as excited when he finds a cool bug to look at, or draws an <br/>
interesting dragon.<br/>
All of his accomplishments are worthy, reading a bob book wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
something that excited me anymore or less than these other things he does.<br/>

Hmmm.  I don&#39;t think my kids have ever said, about anything, &quot;let&#39;s get rid of it.&quot;  Some things they use, some they don&#39;t, but so far they haven&#39;t had an overwhelming desire to throw things away... they tend to be packrats, actually.<br/>
I imagine if I was a former curriculum user they might want to see the curriculum chucked out the window, but I&#39;ve never gone that route and so they don&#39;t have negative connections to much.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a three year old who might eventually like the bob books, so why throw things out just because someone else is done with them?<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was little I subscribed to big backyard and he didn&#39;t much care for it.  Since he had a baby brother I decided to save them even though the kid whose name was on them thought they were &quot;lame&quot; and wouldn&#39;t have cared if I threw them out.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;***This example keeps being used in one form or another, and no one here <br/>
has or <br/>
would do that. I&#39;m thinking maybe your characterization of &quot;the other side&quot; <br/>
is false and you&#39;re angry about something that&#39;s only existing in your model <br/>
of the situation.***<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So you would say a different thing to a child than you would to another <br/>
adult?  You wouldn&#39;t give a child your honest opinion about bob books- which <br/>
from one of your posts was that they are a waste of trees, not really <br/>
reading, and nothing to get excited about?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t have any Bob books.  I looked in them and they looked WAY too easy <br/>
for anyone and I put them back down.  I&#39;ve looked in a TON of books and boxes <br/>
and educational this&#39;n&#39;that and put it back down.  <br/>
<br/>
When my kids read something easy I&#39;d smile and say something appropriate like <br/>
&quot;Cool!&quot; or &quot;Yep!&quot; or &quot;Thanks, I didn&#39;t have my glasses on&quot; or whatever it <br/>
was.  <br/>
<br/>
When Marty was first learning to read he liked reading something off a <br/>
billboard or a sign while we were driving and I would say, for fun, &quot;Marty <br/>
STOP.  If I wanted you to learn to read I would&#39;ve sent you to school.&quot;  He <br/>
would laugh and read something else.  I&#39;d tell other people, in front of him, <br/>
&quot;Marty keeps reading things even though nobody taught him.&quot;  And it made him <br/>
laugh there for a few weeks, and I knew he was reading and he knew he was <br/>
reading.  <br/>
<br/>
That same season, though, if someone on an unschooling discussion had said <br/>
&quot;My child is eight and isn&#39;t reading yet&quot; I would have said &quot;Marty either.  <br/>
Sometimes he recognizes or sounds out a word or two, but it will come.  I&#39;m <br/>
not worried.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was nothing to get excited about, where &quot;excited&quot;  means writing to all <br/>
relatives and coming online and saying &quot;MY CHILD CAN READ NOW.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was a step on a journey.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t make a big deal about kids taking steps either.  They walked to <br/>
walk.  They walked to get somewhere.  It was inevitable.<br/>

Too easy because your kids were already reading?  I can&#39;t imagine how they&#39;d be too easy for a kid who wasn&#39;t reading yet, or only just barely sounding out a few words.  Some of the bob books (they progress a little) are too *hard* for my son, he likes the ones he&#39;s already familiar with the best, and they are usually the ones he wants me to listen to him read.<br/>

Well, just because something takes place naturally and gradually and independent of parental input doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not exciting.  (And isn&#39;t &quot;exciting&quot; subjective anyway?)  My children like me to watch them when they learn new skills... my oldest will come get me to show me a new skateboarding trick he&#39;s taught himself in the driveway, or one of them will want me to watch them flip off the diving board at the pool.  They&#39;re excited about such things and it feels right to mirror it back to them.  Isn&#39;t that sort of like you saying &quot;cool!&quot; when one of your kids just read something?  I have a hard time *not* getting excited for and with my kids when they accomplish something they&#39;ve set out to.<br/>

weren&#39;t walking by a certain date. It was just so cool when they did it and <br/>
their little faces just lit up. It was a family happy time. Just because.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, Casey didn&#39;t walk till almost 15 months and Conor didn&#39;t <br/>
talk till 18 months. I didn&#39;t push, didn&#39;t worry. I held Casey&#39;s little hand <br/>
and walked her around for as long as she asked me to. I talked and sang and <br/>
read and cooed with Conor until one day he was talking right back.<br/>

spoken recording or computer program or movie or play or translate it into a<br/>
different language it changes, of course, but it&#39;s fundamental reason for<br/>
being isn&#39;t lost.<br/>
<br/>
(Though some poetry does have a visual element using type conventions and<br/>
placement on the page.)<br/>
<br/>
The same couldn&#39;t be said of the Bob books or other easy readers. A book on<br/>
tape version of the Bob books would be rather meaningless without the books<br/>
;-) And you couldn&#39;t convey the story in Bob books on video since the<br/>
&quot;story&quot; is a side effect of English spelling and pronounciation. Bob books<br/>
in another language couldn&#39;t have the same story since mat, pat and cat<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be visually or auditorially (is that the hearing version of<br/>
seeing?) related.<br/>
<br/>
If the publishers&#39; purpose was to convey information, all easy readers could<br/>
be transfered to video tape or audio tape (for just listening to, not<br/>
following along in the book) to make the information accessible to all kids<br/>
whether reading or not. But that&#39;s not their purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Some authors do manage to transcend the purpose and actually manage to get a<br/>
good story into an easy reader :-) But the good story isn&#39;t why they exist.<br/>

<br/>
Notice I said that books published in the *written* language are meant to be read.  I guess I should have said printed language since I didn&#39;t convey my meaning very well.<br/>
Printed words are always meant to be read by someone, aren&#39;t they?  <br/>
<br/>
Since the purpose of Bob books are to help people learn to read, not to convey ideas (have I said this already?), of course it would make no sense to have them on tape.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that easy readers and bob books can and are sometimes used to force a child into reading before they&#39;re ready, and mabye that&#39;s why some of you are so against them.  I still maintain that in a household where they simply exist as another tool they don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; anyone read any earlier than they want to.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are math workbooks &quot;about math&quot;?  Do they convey information of interest to <br/>
people who are dying to know more about how patterns and mathematics work?<br/>
<br/>
Does a worksheet of easy two-digit addition problems you don&#39;t have to carry <br/>
over a real use of mathematical thinking?<br/>
<br/>
Holly used to like me to make her &quot;math problems&quot; and I would, but I would <br/>
make patterns or tricks in there so she would think more than just each <br/>
problem.  I&#39;d make one whole row all add up to 12, or set a line of <br/>
&quot;problems&quot; where the sums increased incrementally by one, but there was no <br/>
pattern in the other two lines.   Or where there was.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t TELL her what I was doing, she would come and tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Because my husband had explained  something new and important to me, one day <br/>
years ago when I was confessing math anxiety and he was sitting on the toilet <br/>
across the wall probably wishing I&#39;d hush up about math anxiety,   I said the <br/>
only problems I EVER really understood and liked in school were the two, out <br/>
of thirty usually, which were &quot;word problems.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said then I DID understand math, because the word problems were the only <br/>
problems in the whole book.   The others were solutions for unstated word <br/>
problems, without the calculations having been completed.<br/>
<br/>
And so it is in algebra--those forumlas are solutions, not &quot;problems.&quot;  The <br/>
job is calculation, not mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
I felt much better after that day, and s had to do with patterns and <br/>
combinations, not with calculation.   <br/>
<br/>
She probably did 20 of those over the course of two years.  I would just whip <br/>
as many as I could fit on the paper she would bring me and she would go away <br/>
and solve them.<br/>

<br/>
Another part of the puzzle of what I&#39;m thinking without words!<br/>
<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t want to &quot;READ,&quot; they wanted to read specific things.<br/>
<br/>
And while there is a tradition of saying if you want to swim, you need to do <br/>
jumping jacks to strenghten your legs and arms, and if you want to learn <br/>
karate from Pat Morita you have to wax the deck, and if you want to ride a <br/>
horse you have to muck stables for two days first, I&#39;m trying to get away <br/>
from those traditions, some of which are justifiable, and some of which are <br/>
punitive and a little sadistic.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s sadistic to buy Bob books.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying that unless it&#39;s absolutely and clearly and proveably TRUE that a <br/>
child can only learn to read by having three letter words with all short <br/>
vowels, moving on to four letter words with all LONG vowels (where &quot;the&quot; will <br/>
be pronounced with a long &quot;e&quot; regardless of what word follows it, because <br/>
it&#39;s too soon to &quot;teach that rule&quot;), I wasn&#39;t willing to go back to the <br/>
formulaic teaching methods of traditional school reading programs.<br/>
<br/>
By the time they were reading anything real, they knew perfectly well <br/>
instinctively that you say &quot;the(e) egg&quot; but &quot;the(uh) dog&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
With very early reading, sometimes the ability to sound out surpasses the <br/>
knowledge of the language, so kids will be sounding words out which are not <br/>
even words they know.<br/>
<br/>
That does happen with anyone, sometimes, but with five and six year olds it <br/>
happens LOTS.  Too much like me sounding out Italian or Latin to sing church  <br/>
music and not understanding anything but Jesu and Maria.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015633109">***My kids didn&#39;t want to &quot;READ,&quot; they wanted to read specific things.***<br/>
<br/>
The specific things my kid wants to read right now are the bob books.  Not because of the outstanding content, but because (I&#39;m guessing) they&#39;re easy and manageable, and right now it&#39;s letters and letter combinations that interest him (among other things, like listening to me read about volcanoes and Pompeii).  <br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m saying that unless it&#39;s absolutely and clearly and proveably TRUE that a <br/>

it&#39;s too soon to &quot;teach that rule&quot;), I wasn&#39;t willing to go back to the <br/>
formulaic teaching methods of traditional school reading programs.***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone here is trying to prove it necessary.  I&#39;ve only said that they&#39;re useful, sometimes, for some kids.<br/>
And I don&#39;t think that having bob books lying around is utilizing any teaching method, let alone a formulaic one.  I don&#39;t hover or make sure he reads them in the proper order or anything.<br/>
<br/>
From my posts you&#39;d think that bob books are prominently displayed in our home at all times and that a large amount of time is spent with them.  That&#39;s not the case.  All together he&#39;s probably spent ten or fifteen minutes with them in the past week.<br/>
<br/>
***With very early reading, sometimes the ability to sound out surpasses the <br/>
knowledge of the language, so kids will be sounding words out which are not <br/>
even words they know.***<br/>
<br/>
I can see how that might happen.  <br/>
But it hasn&#39;t happened with my older fluent reader nor my budding reader.  My oldest learned to read gradually and easily, and the rare times he&#39;s read aloud to me I&#39;ve noticed an interesting phenomenon... he reads content more than actual words.  For example he&#39;ll paraphrase without thinking about it because he &quot;expects&quot; a sentence to flow a certain way based on the content.<br/>
And this is a child who largely taught himself to read with bob books and other easy readers.  Obviously he didn&#39;t get stuck sounding out without getting the meaning.  My middle son, while &quot;sounding out&quot; words, will look at the picture for clues to what unfamiliar words say.<br/>

<br/>
Not consciously, but I&#39;m sure I spoke differently to my infants than I did to other adults.  Hasn&#39;t it been found that universally mothers speak to babies in similar ways... with a high pitched voice and raised eyebrows, with their faces right in front of the infant&#39;s?<br/>
I&#39;m sure that that&#39;s not how they learn to talk, I&#39;m sure it has more to do with being in a talking environment and picking up language from the people talking normally around them.  But by that logic why have books specifically for children at all?  Why have refridgerator letters or anything with small words if children can, and therefore should, just pick it up from full fledged adult level print?  <br/>
<br/>
***Did you help them walk by breaking down movement to it&#39;s simplest form?***<br/>
<br/>
No, but I remember when they were newly and unsteadily walking I might position a sturdy chair, say, halfway between the coffee table and the wall so they had something to toddle over to and grab.  Planting useful tools in the kid&#39;s environment isn&#39;t the same thing as imposing &quot;teaching&quot; or manipulation on them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here is probably the crux.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with that.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I see Bob Books as little walking-chair-substitutes made just for <br/>
that purpose and no other. A special color, a special size, to stash around <br/>
the room so kids can walk.  And it seems families can just use chairs they <br/>
already have.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s right or all, I&#39;m just trying to clarify my still unclear <br/>
thoughts.<br/>

I do see your point.  But, I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t have anything similar to bob books lying around the house.  Print, yes, but simplified print, no.  Not unless I buy it (or make it) and put it there.<br/>
I have bought step stools for the kitchen so the kids could reach the sink easily.  I could just have used a couple of phone books, I guess, but I went ahead and bought a step stool.  Because they&#39;re more attractive, I guess.<br/>
I have one child who *loves* child sized furniture... chairs and such.  He *could* just use our regular chairs but the little chairs are fun for him for some reason.<br/>

the sake of having the skill. She&#39;s like that. I don&#39;t argue, I facilitate. <br/>
And working on the skill in no way stopped or hindered her other learning.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I hardly think Casey has learned anything by traditional school methods. But <br/>
she likes what she likes. And she liked sounding out short words at the <br/>
beginning. ::shrugs:: Call me a sadist, I let her do it.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think it has to be an either/or situation. Either kids learn <br/>
this way or they don&#39;t. Each kid is different. Mine are very different from <br/>
each other. Probably from the rest of the world too. LOL<br/>
