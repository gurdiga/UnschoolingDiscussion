<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470094083">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
What are the differences between unschoolers playing video games and school kids playing video games?  <br/>
<br/>
If playing the video games with our children is an important factor in maximizing the benefits of video games, then how much playing with them does this mean?  My son is so accomplished that playing with me means coming down about 10 levels.  Can playing with them just mean watching them play and talking about it?<br/>
<br/>
What exactly are the benefits of playing/watching video games with them versus NOT playing/watching the video games with them?  <br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t play video games with them, and they play unlimited, sometimes up to 6 hours a day without a parent present, then is the video game playing becoming detrimental to the child&#39;s development? <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes!<br/>
<br/>
Being with them, knowing why they love what they love, what they&#39;re good at <br/>
in the game, what they&#39;re thinking about it, and learning, whom they&#39;re <br/>
impressing or impressed by.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What exactly are the benefits of playing/watching video games with them <br/>
versus NOT playing/watching the video games with them?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Exactly&quot;? Not vaguely?<br/>
It depends on the child, family and the game what the exact benefits will be.<br/>
<br/>
I think the main danger of NOT playing or even watching is that the parents <br/>
will be ignorant of the depth and difficulty of the game, and could easily and <br/>
thoughtlessly belittle the child for &quot;doing nothing&quot; or wasting time or think <br/>
that it&#39;s a &quot;stupid game.&quot;  Even a parent who&#39;s a great actor and never <br/>
indicates it overtly to the child is still damaging the parental image and <br/>
definition of that child if she even THINKS the child is a time-waster doing and <br/>
learning nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling will work better when the parent really understands the child&#39;s <br/>
days and friends and interests and experiences than when the interactions <br/>
between child and parent are all parentally chosen/approved/slanted.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t even tried to play Halo II, but I&#39;ve hung around it and watched <br/>
enough that I get most of the jokes on Red vs. Blue, and had asked Kirby and <br/>
Marty enough questions about what they were doing and how LAN parties worked that <br/>
when they started playing online I could discuss it fairly intelligently (for <br/>
a non-playing mom).  Yesterday Holly and I were alone in the car (going to <br/>
pick Keith up from the hospital--hooray!) and I told her that Rosie Sorooshian <br/>
had gotten to go to a Halo II LAN party with 16 or 20 kids and Holly said <br/>
probably 16, because that&#39;s how many can play on one hub at once.  (LAN parties are <br/>
where they get lots of computers or gaming systems in one physical building <br/>
and network them together for one big interactive game.)   So I asked Holly if <br/>
that&#39;s why on X-Box live the teams are 8 on 8.  Yes.  That&#39;s why.     COOL! <br/>
<br/>
Kirby played a WONDERFUL video of part of an a capella concert that&#39;s on <br/>
eBaum&#39;s world, with a group of a dozen or so singers doing theme songs and <br/>
background music from video games.  It&#39;s incredible.  Then some of them act out parts <br/>
of the games.   I recognized them (and so could get some of the jokes) on all <br/>
but one of the games, and had to ask which game that one was.   Had I never <br/>
paid attention, we couldn&#39;t have shared that moment and I couldn&#39;t have <br/>
speculated with Kirby about how the music might&#39;ve been arranged and learned.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If we don&#39;t play video games with them, and they play unlimited, sometimes <br/>
up to 6 hours a day without a parent present, then is the video game playing <br/>
becoming detrimental to the child&#39;s development? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I would think that parental non-involvement would become detrimental to the <br/>
relationship between parent and child.  Development would continue, but the <br/>
parent and child relationship would be distanced and more strained, especially if <br/>
the parent oozes disapproval of the child&#39;s interest and involvement with <br/>
games.  Making a child stop playing a video game just because the parent has no <br/>
interest in it wouldn&#39;t be a good move, I don&#39;t think, either.  <br/>
<br/>
Some parents don&#39;t want to really know their children.  If those parents are <br/>
unschoolers, they will run into problems, and it will be a shame if they blame <br/>
video games or TV or books or something the child IS getting feedback from <br/>
and being soothed by.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a real for-instance, or is this hypothetical?<br/>

Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, well, the real for-instance is my latest drop in confidence regarding <br/>
video games timing itself with my ds&#39;s latest passion for Game Cube.  Of <br/>
course!  But, what you are saying about the parent not getting involved <br/>
could strain the relationship with the child b/c tthe parent is not <br/>
understanding and undermining the child - is really ringing true.  My <br/>
knee-jerk reaction wanted to just limit the video games - but I knew I <br/>
couldn&#39;t, knew I wouldn&#39;t be accomplishing anything but fighting and <br/>
resistance and more disconnect.  I was definitely needing some <br/>
reminders/refocusing of my thinking and beliefs surrounding video game <br/>
playing so I could get back on board the confidence boat.  Your comments <br/>
helped tremendously - THANK-YOU - I am not a video game lover at heart, so I <br/>
need some prodding.  On my own, I was already realising that I need to sit <br/>
back down with him and play a little bit, find more out about the games, and <br/>
this has already brought back my respect for the thinking that IS going on <br/>
in various ways while he plays.<br/>
<br/>
It is also very reassuring to hear that he will find benefit in the video <br/>
games even if I&#39;m not playing - b/c I do find it hard to sit down with him <br/>
for the length of time he plays, along with having 2 other children to <br/>
attend to who do not love video games.  His father plays with him alot - so <br/>
they connect deeply over the video games, and I am going to make a more <br/>
concerted effort to get more involved than I have been - I really do love <br/>
admiring what he does, and it sure does make it easier when you understand <br/>
why they&#39;re doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank-you again!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think this applies to *any* interest or hobby a child has, not<br/>
just video games or tv shows.  Not in a smothering or hovering way,<br/>
but I find unschooling means so much MORE parental involvement than<br/>
school-at-home ever did for us.  There is no 3-hour block of<br/>
&quot;learning&quot; and then send them out to play because I&#39;m done for the<br/>
day.  I&#39;m much more concious of who they are as persons because of the<br/>
time spent with them throughout the days.<br/>
<br/>
I go to my son&#39;s historical swordsmanship class and watch and listen<br/>
because I want to be able to talk to him intelligently about it<br/>
afterwards.  I watch my daughter painting her latest work because I<br/>
want to know what she is working on and how it is going.  I play Halo<br/>
II or Luigi&#39;s Haunted Mansion and Animal Crossing with my sons because<br/>
the games are fun and it is time together building a mutual interest<br/>
and skill.  I buy the ingredients for whatever recipe my 13yo son has<br/>
decided he wants to try, and I watch him prepare it and we talk about<br/>
how it goes together and then I eat it (or at least taste it! LOL).<br/>
<br/>
And I love watching them Shine while they do something they enjoy.<br/>
