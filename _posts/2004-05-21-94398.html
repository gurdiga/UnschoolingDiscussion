<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131420892">Matt (6) taught himself all about rhyming words yesterday! He was on <br/>
his swings singing the theme song from Baby Looney Tunes, and out of <br/>
nowhere he said, &quot;Mommy does Tweety rhyme with Sweety&quot;? I <br/>
said, &quot;Yep!&quot; He said, &quot;I thought so!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Then, later in bed, he was playing silly word games. He was being <br/>
REALLY goofy, but I played along. Stuff like &quot;When I say too, you say <br/>
yo&quot; or &quot;When I say ubu, you say bunny&quot; Then the game turned <br/>
into &quot;When I say &quot;bunny&quot;, you say something that rhymes with sheep&quot;. <br/>
We spent quite awhile making up real and silly words that rhymed with <br/>
sheep, laughing about it the whole time. <br/>
<br/>
I found it all very cool. No forced lessons, no teaching him. If he <br/>
hadn&#39;t watched Baby Looney Tunes often enough to learn the theme song <br/>
and if I had thought his word game in bed was too goofy to play along <br/>
with, he might have never learned that yesterday. :)<br/>
