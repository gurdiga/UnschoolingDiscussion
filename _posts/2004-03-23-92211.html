<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760617691">Someone had emailed me offlist with comments and questions on my website--my<br/>
personal journey page. I didn&#39;t have a chance to respond, and now it seems I<br/>
deleted the post accidentally. If you&#39;re out there--could you email me<br/>
again? I really didn&#39;t mean to ignore you--just got delete happy when<br/>
cleaning out my inbox. Sorry!<br/>
