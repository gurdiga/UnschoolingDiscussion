<div id="ygrps-yiv-253246049">&lt;&lt;And you can&#39;t buy absinthe in the stores :-(<br/>
I love absinthe. Britian is one of the few countries where it is still <br/>
legal.<br/>

<br/>
When I think of absinthe I think of those paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec<br/>
of people looking completely stoned with a little glass of something<br/>
bright green.  I&#39;ve always thought it was a pretty powerful drug and<br/>
highly addictive.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Google (as Sandra taught me ; )) and it was fascinating.  Maybe<br/>
someday I&#39;ll visit the UK and try some.  Do they serve it in pubs there?<br/>
