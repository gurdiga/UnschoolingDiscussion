<div id="ygrps-yiv-60585398">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am in need of some advice/information from those who have been there and <br/>
are there.  My son is 8yo and has been struggling for the past 5+ years.  He <br/>
has been diagnosed officially with ADHD, ODD and depression.  They are <br/>
&quot;observing&quot; him for bipolar disorder.  My question is do any of you have <br/>
children with the ADHD diagnosis that go through severe mood swings on a <br/>
constant basis and/or have depression.  The depression is chemical and runs <br/>
heavily in our family.  The doctors recently prescribed him zoloft, which <br/>
honestly don&#39;t seem to be helping that much.  He was on ritalin once several <br/>
years ago - and that route was horrible.  I have tried to keep him drug-free, <br/>
however his mood swings are turning violent and increasing in self-abuse.  <br/>
Anyone have any suggestions/ideas????<br/>
<br/>

Hi Sheri,<br/>
<br/>
I assume you have checked into allergies?  Milk allergies are a very big <br/>
cause of &quot;Add&quot; diagnosis.  Also, allergies can cause depression, as the body <br/>
is working hard to get the &quot;chemical&quot; that it is not tolerating out of it&#39;s <br/>
system.  Eating a High Protein, low carbohydrate diet and avoiding artificial <br/>
coloring is another thing to look at.  There are some wonderful <br/>
natural/herbal remedies, helps that can help with depression.  One of the <br/>
most used is St. John&#39;s Wort - although you need to be careful with it.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t always work on truly clinically depressed people either.   There are <br/>
some combinations that incorporate several herbs that seem to be more <br/>
effective in some people.  You can email me privately for more information, <br/>
or go to your local health food store and ask to speak with an herbalist.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-560812567">{{{{Sherri}}}}}  First of all, let me tell you that I have been there.  My <br/>
son Adam, now 13, had horrible mood swings, went through bouts with OCD and <br/>
depression.  At the age of 10 he was hospitalized for depression.  He <br/>
exhibited suicidal ideation and he was also self-abusing by scratching his <br/>
face when he got especially angry.   It was horrible, and we went through 5 <br/>
different medications.  The one that worked best for him was Desipramine.  <br/>
But that drug is not without risks and he needed cardiograms before he could <br/>
even be put on it.  Now, though, he is off all medications and doing better <br/>
being homeschooled than when he was in public school.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, I also suffer from depression, which is greatly helped by Zoloft.<br/>
<br/>
His OCD and depression and moodswings seem to be strongest when he is <br/>
stressed, so we try to limit his stressors once we&#39;ve identified them.  He is <br/>
much better now, although he still has his moments.. they are definitely <br/>
fewer and farther between.  Some of that, I supposed, may be do to maturity.  <br/>
He is no longer on medication, or in therapy, or in school.<br/>
<br/>
So, I don&#39;t have the answers, but I can tell you that you are not alone, and <br/>
if you can hang in there, it&#39;ll probably get better!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452032075">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list (I&#39;ll intro later) but I have a friend whose son went <br/>
through the same thing. I don&#39;t know what all they tried, but the thing she <br/>
says finally worked was aromatherapy. I would suggest using it in conjunction <br/>
with other treatment -- you might contact a licensed, holistic practitioner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392659831">Is your kid out of school through all of this?  I presume because of the list you<br/>
are on that he is out of school.  I wish I could offer you some assistance but am<br/>
at a loss.  I ask about school because I know that whatever ails your kid will be<br/>
exacerbated by school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062412161">Hi Sheri, I too have a 8 yo son diagnosed with ADHD and ODD. When he was <br/>
younger he had more self-destructive mood swings but now it is very <br/>
infrequent. I don&#39;t know much about bipolar or depression but I do know that <br/>
multivitamins and St. John&#39;s Wort seems to help him keep things under <br/>
control. My prayers are with you! Lori in TX</div>

 </span></blockquote>Discussions on Allergies are always of interest to me because of myself and<br/>
my son.  I have some preservative allergies, hay fever, asthma and<br/>
sensitive skin.  My son shares ALL of these, plus pet allergies, spice<br/>
allergies, and severe and violent allergies to dairy products, eggs and<br/>
nuts.  I have always been prone to depression and I wonder if this could be<br/>
allergy related (I never heard of that connection before.)  My son, being<br/>
only two, does not have any labels stuck on him except busy/active.  I<br/>
wonder, if I was going to send him to PS if he would be labeled as ADD or<br/>
with other learning problems.  I also wonder how his behavior might be<br/>
affected if his allergies were less severe (and therefor less obvious) and<br/>
he was on a les limited diet than he is now.<br/>
