<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635488868">So...<br/>
I&#39;m keeping this baby.  Holly is the babysitter of record, but I do most of <br/>
the work.  That&#39;s okay.  The baby likes me a lot, and is pretty suspicious of <br/>
Holly&#39;s motives and abilities.<br/>
<br/>
So I got up early today, after a night of weird dreams including finding two <br/>
new rooms in our house.  (Those dreams are common, fun and irritating for me.) <br/>
 And it had rained, and I surveyed some little damage, and accepted <br/>
baby-delivery.  Read e-mail with the baby on my lap directing my hands on the keyboard. <br/>
  She can sit now, and inspired by the dream, I gave her some toys and was <br/>
cleaning out one of my storage rooms.  Finding lots of late 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s <br/>
writings and letters and photos.    <br/>
<br/>
We went in back and took a long nap with Pride and Prejudice on.  Kirby came <br/>
to tell me he was going to work (a morning meeting).    I finally woke up <br/>
thinking...  Hank Azaria as Riff Raff...   in the Holy Grail!?   DARN IT.  I had <br/>
imagined a nice Rocky Horror production without remembering we weren&#39;t talking <br/>
about Rocky Horror anymore. &lt;g&gt;  So hours later, I&#39;m saying &quot;Never mind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t help my confusion that one of the things I found and re-filed this <br/>
morning was the bag from when we saw it live.  They had printed &quot;lips&quot; on it, <br/>
and Holly saved hers.  In my junk room. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So sorry... back to asking the right questions.<br/>
About this Holy Grail musical...   Are they doing the same sort of &quot;cast of <br/>
dozen&quot; so that people will be several characters?  <br/>
<br/>
I like sleeping with a baby.  Maybe it&#39;s nice now because it&#39;s been so long, <br/>
but there&#39;s something extra relaxing and important about being there and being <br/>
still when a baby&#39;s asleep.  The dog came and lay with us too.  It was really <br/>
nice.  But stupifying.<br/>

 <br/>
We have a new puppy. He&#39;s four months old now---and all legs! But I still  <br/>
enjoy having him lie on my chest to sleep. I too sleep SOOOO much better with a  <br/>
wee one on my chest! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

--------------<br/>
<br/>
Because she&#39;s a baby?<br/>
<br/>
She seems wary of my husband (probably the beard). He can talk to her, but <br/>
not hold her.<br/>
Ditto, Kirby (not a beard, who knows what?).<br/>
<br/>
Marty she likes lots.<br/>
Holly she likes at a distance.  She seems not to think Holly&#39;s competent and <br/>
she wants me to do whatever it is Holly&#39;s trying to do for her.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, oh!<br/>
She has two older sister, about 7 and 9. They really are NOT way <br/>
competent--like too little to hold her safely.  So maybe she associates Holly with them.<br/>

or sometimes in a sling.  Isaac loves when she carries, holds, and <br/>
plays with him.  <br/>
