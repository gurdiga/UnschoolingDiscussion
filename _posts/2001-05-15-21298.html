<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770159888">I agree . I think it is stressful enough just being a child learning how to<br/>
grow up. Children can learn to deal with stress by talking to their parents<br/>
& observing how their parents deal with stress. The mental muscles are<br/>
exercised by using your brain. Usually through reading, mentally challenging<br/>
games, learning new things, etc. This is a study that *was* done to show the<br/>
things that kept a persons brain active as they age. Stress causes bad<br/>
effects to your brain chemistry. Children exposed to stress early have shown<br/>
to have the same problematic brain patterns as adults in high stress jobs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am saying that it is a parental duty to impose<br/>
boundaries.  When we say &#39;do not touch the element<br/>
coils on the stove, because it is hot and will burn<br/>
you&#39;, that is a boundary.  When we say &#39;you may play<br/>
with your friend for two hours, and then we must go to<br/>
the store to get food for dinner&#39;, that is a boundary.<br/>
 Often children find these boundaries frustrating and<br/>
unpleasant, but for their own good and the good of our<br/>
families, it is important to help our kids learn to<br/>
tolerate a certain amount of frustration, anger, hurt,<br/>
etc.<br/>

unnecessary amount of stress on them later in the form<br/>
of burns, social ostracism, inability to deal with<br/>
grief, etc.  I am obviously not speaking of abuse...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I am saying this as fact.  Many studies have been<br/>
done (in the US and in the Netherlands, particularly)<br/>
on prosocial behavior, depression and anxiety, and<br/>
abusive/aggressive personalities, all of which have<br/>
shown that children who are overprotected from<br/>
experiencing a certain amount of stress grow up<br/>
without being given the chance to learn (primarily<br/>
through parental role modeling and parental behavioral<br/>
training/counseling) valuable skills in dealing with<br/>
stress, adverse behavior of others, frustration,<br/>
anger, compromise and negotiation, prosocial behavior,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You believe that you cannot be supportive *and* set<br/>
boundaries/inflict a certain amount of stress?  My<br/>
son, for instance, finds it extremely stressful to<br/>
talk about or deal with learning social skills such as<br/>
meeting people&#39;s eyes, dealing with bullies, making<br/>
friendly advances to people, etc... but if I indulge<br/>
him in his avoidant behavior he will not learn these<br/>
things, and without them he is vulnerable to a variety<br/>
of abuses from others.  I might look like a bad guy<br/>
for a little while to him... as I did when I did<br/>
holding therapy with him as a toddler... but in the<br/>
long run he will benefit and it will make our<br/>
relationship stronger (as the holding therapy did,<br/>
although at the time it was *very* stressful and<br/>
unpleasant).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why are you assuming that this is not what I am<br/>
espousing?  Why is setting reasonable boundaries not a<br/>
part of our duties to make life a &#39;best possible<br/>
experience&#39;?  Lots of studies show that children feel<br/>
frustrated and angry with boundaries when they are<br/>
inconvenient to temporary urges, but long-term are<br/>
more secure and better able to deal with the<br/>
vicissitudes of life.  What&#39;s so bad about that?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find that the school system available to us is not<br/>
aimed to provide a &#39;reasonable&#39; amount of stress for a<br/>
child of my particular child&#39;s combination of needs<br/>
and personality traits... the amount of stress caused<br/>
by the sexual harassment and physical abuse he is<br/>
experiencing there goes beyond his ability to cope.  I<br/>
could, of course, be wrong.  I hope not.  <br/>
<br/>
I am also not entirely unschooling my child, in the<br/>
pure sense of the word.  I am adjusting the process to<br/>
fit my and my child&#39;s needs as best I can... we will<br/>
have a certain amount of housework scheduled in, for<br/>
instance, although I know my child will find this<br/>
stressful and unpleasant to some degree.  Tough.  I<br/>
find it unpleasant, too, to a much greater degree<br/>
(because it is physically painful for me), but it<br/>
needs to be done, and as part of the family unit he<br/>
has the responsibility (IMO as his parent) to<br/>
participate in the necessary processes of upkeeping<br/>
the family&#39;s quality of life.  I can empathize with<br/>
his frustration, I can help him problem solve to make<br/>
it as easy to tolerate as possible... that will<br/>
hopefully give him some useful coping skills to use in<br/>
the future.  But he still needs to deal with it, like<br/>
it or not, and I will be inflicting stress... and<br/>
believe that it will be good for him.  Same goes for<br/>
the social training.  I think in the end it is more<br/>
important for me to be his parent than to be his<br/>
friend, when I have to choose between one and the<br/>
other... I believe that in doing so I am being more<br/>
truly his friend in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
AND I think he will still manage to find me a<br/>
supportive person in the fulfillment of his dreams...<br/>

that the child could stay with the friend while I went to the grocery<br/>

morning when the child wants to go to the store.  I might suggest we<br/>
order pizza or eat *gasp* spaghettios.<br/>

and adults with relatively easy childhoods, I hear of  people who seem<br/>
happy and fulfilled.  These are the people who are not focusing on the<br/>
horrors of the world.  These are the people that bounce back from the<br/>
burns and social ostracism because these are the people with high self<br/>
esteems, people with unconditional love backing them, people who trust<br/>
the world because, at least, they could trust their parents as toddlers<br/>
and young children, and even teens.  These are the people who can handle<br/>
challenges because boundaries  weren&#39;t arbitrarily crammed down their<br/>
throats.<br/>
<br/>
I am also wondering what your world view is?  Is there not some reason<br/>

&gt; more secure and better able to deal with the<br/>
&gt; vicissitudes of life.  What&#39;s so bad about that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How can a study show that a child is more secure when his trusted<br/>
helpers are voluntarily and methodically planting known stressors in his<br/>
path?  I do not see how a study could use this kind of reasoning.<br/>
Again, I beg to read these many studies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I find that the school system available to us is not<br/>
&gt; aimed to provide a &#39;reasonable&#39; amount of stress for a<br/>
&gt; child of my particular child&#39;s combination of needs<br/>
&gt; and personality traits... the amount of stress caused<br/>
&gt; by the sexual harassment and physical abuse he is<br/>
&gt; experiencing there goes beyond his ability to cope.  I<br/>
&gt; could, of course, be wrong.  I hope not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure he is better off at home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am also not entirely unschooling my child, in the<br/>
&gt; pure sense of the word.  I am adjusting the process to<br/>
&gt; fit my and my child&#39;s needs as best I can... we will<br/>
&gt; have a certain amount of housework scheduled in, for<br/>
&gt; instance, although I know my child will find this<br/>
&gt; stressful and unpleasant to some degree. Tough.  Ifind it unpleasant,<br/>
&gt; too, to a much greater degree<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand that you are ill, and I am sorry, but how do you know that<br/>
you find it more unpleasant?  And if it is so unpleasant, maybe you<br/>
could brainstorm for some better options.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (because it is physically painful for me), but it<br/>
&gt; needs to be done, and as part of the family unit he<br/>
&gt; has the responsibility (IMO as his parent) to<br/>
&gt; participate in the necessary processes of upkeeping<br/>
&gt; the family&#39;s quality of life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is quality of life synonymous with a clean house?  Is quality of life<br/>
synonymous with stress?  Is quality of life synonymous with imposing<br/>
one&#39;s will upon another being?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can empathize with<br/>
&gt; his frustration, I can help him problem solve to make<br/>
&gt; it as easy to tolerate as possible... that will<br/>
&gt; hopefully give him some useful coping skills to use in<br/>
&gt; the future.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But he still needs to deal with it, like<br/>
&gt; it or not, and I will be inflicting stress... and<br/>
&gt; believe that it will be good for him.  Same goes for<br/>
&gt; the social training.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people like to be alone.  Social training, for them, would be<br/>
synonymous to forced basketball practice for someone who loathes sports.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think in the end it is more<br/>
&gt; important for me to be his parent than to be his<br/>
&gt; friend, when I have to choose between one and the<br/>
&gt; other... I believe that in doing so I am being more<br/>
&gt; truly his friend in the long run.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is your distinction between parent and friend?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>

&gt; &gt; Goodness, if that is as much stress as kids can<br/>
&gt; &gt; handle, and in order to be happy and healthy they must<br/>
&gt; &gt; be protected from experiencing anything more<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult, most of them are in for a rather miserable<br/>
&gt; &gt; life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am not saying that is as much as they can handle.  I am saying that<br/>
&gt;children get a pretty incredible amount of stress naturally.  Nobody<br/>
&gt;needs to impose it upon them.  I also think it is a sad statement to say<br/>
&gt;that a child is in for a miserable life if they have a happy childhood.<br/>
&gt;My definition of happy childhood=adult helpers showing children how to<br/>
&gt;avoid stress, not run right into it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am saying that it is a parental duty to impose<br/>
&gt; &gt; boundaries.  When we say &#39;do not touch the element<br/>
&gt; &gt; coils on the stove, because it is hot and will burn<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;, that is a boundary.  When we say &#39;you may play<br/>
&gt; &gt; with your friend for two hours, and then we must<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;must?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; go to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the store to get food for dinner&#39;, that is a boundary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In our house, we would try to find a better solution.  I might suggest<br/>
&gt;that the child could stay with the friend while I went to the grocery<br/>
&gt;store, or wait until Dad got home, or hire a sitter, or wait until the<br/>
&gt;morning when the child wants to go to the store.  I might suggest we<br/>
&gt;order pizza or eat *gasp* spaghettios.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Often children find these boundaries frustrating and<br/>
&gt; &gt; unpleasant, but for their own good and the good of our<br/>
&gt; &gt; families,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How is this good for the family?  I have never seen a family that is<br/>
&gt;happy at the expense of someone else&#39;s happiness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is important to help our kids learn to<br/>
&gt; &gt; tolerate a certain amount of frustration, anger, hurt,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps a parent could help the child learn to experience anger.  A<br/>
&gt;parent need not inflict this frustration or hurt in order to help a<br/>
&gt;child.  The child will get plenty in due time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so, I would love to hear one source stating this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact.  No one needs to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have stress imposed on them, particularly by a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trusted advisor, namely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their parent.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, they do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ummm, nah.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Otherwise the world imposes an<br/>
&gt; &gt; unnecessary amount of stress on them later in the form<br/>
&gt; &gt; of burns, social ostracism, inability to deal with<br/>
&gt; &gt; grief, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do you know this?  When I hear of grown unschoolers, free schoolers,<br/>
&gt;and adults with relatively easy childhoods, I hear of  people who seem<br/>
&gt;happy and fulfilled.  These are the people who are not focusing on the<br/>
&gt;horrors of the world.  These are the people that bounce back from the<br/>
&gt;burns and social ostracism because these are the people with high self<br/>
&gt;esteems, people with unconditional love backing them, people who trust<br/>
&gt;the world because, at least, they could trust their parents as toddlers<br/>
&gt;and young children, and even teens.  These are the people who can handle<br/>
&gt;challenges because boundaries  weren&#39;t arbitrarily crammed down their<br/>
&gt;throats.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am also wondering what your world view is?  Is there not some reason<br/>
&gt;to expect that the world will dish your son a big plate of happiness?<br/>
&gt;If the world gives your son a lovely ride, will this anger boot camp be<br/>
&gt;in vein?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am obviously not speaking of abuse...<br/>
&gt; &gt; see that above I specifically mentioned &#39;reasonable<br/>
&gt; &gt; boundaries&#39; and &#39;natural stressors&#39;, the first of<br/>
&gt; &gt; which are *best* set by loving parents rather than<br/>
&gt; &gt; uncaring outsiders and the second of which are imposed<br/>
&gt; &gt; by life (death of loved ones, accidents, illness,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, I am saying this as fact.  Many studies have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; done (in the US and in the Netherlands, particularly)<br/>
&gt; &gt; on prosocial behavior, depression and anxiety, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; abusive/aggressive personalities, all of which have<br/>
&gt; &gt; shown that children who are overprotected from<br/>
&gt; &gt; experiencing a certain amount of stress grow up<br/>
&gt; &gt; without being given the chance to learn (primarily<br/>
&gt; &gt; through parental role modeling and parental behavioral<br/>
&gt; &gt; training/counseling) valuable skills in dealing with<br/>
&gt; &gt; stress, adverse behavior of others, frustration,<br/>
&gt; &gt; anger, compromise and negotiation, prosocial behavior,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Could you please give me the source, link, reference?  I&#39;d really love<br/>
&gt;to read these numerous studies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You believe that you cannot be supportive *and* set<br/>
&gt; &gt; boundaries/inflict a certain amount of stress?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I believe I am a helper.  And yes, I avoid causing her stress.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes I f*** up, and in that situation, I am the first to tell her,<br/>
&gt;and I am the first to apologize.  Purposely inflicting anything on<br/>
&gt;anyone seems very wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My<br/>
&gt; &gt; son, for instance, finds it extremely stressful to<br/>
&gt; &gt; talk about or deal with learning social skills such as<br/>
&gt; &gt; meeting people&#39;s eyes, dealing with bullies, making<br/>
&gt; &gt; friendly advances to people, etc... but if I indulge<br/>
&gt; &gt; him in his avoidant behavior he will not learn these<br/>
&gt; &gt; things,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or maybe, just like talking or walking, he would learn these things on<br/>
&gt;his own, when he felt ready.  &quot;Sorry, Johnny, I know you can&#39;t swim and<br/>
&gt;you are very afraid of the water, but lets just start you right here in<br/>
&gt;the cold deep end, shall we?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and without them he is vulnerable to a variety<br/>
&gt; &gt; of abuses from others.  I might look like a bad guy<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a little while to him... as I did when I did<br/>
&gt; &gt; holding therapy with him as a toddler<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again, I mention the method used in Son-Rise.<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.option.org/index.html">http://www.option.org/index.html</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ... but in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; long run he will benefit and it will make our<br/>
&gt; &gt; relationship stronger (as the holding therapy did,<br/>
&gt; &gt; although at the time it was *very* stressful and<br/>
&gt; &gt; unpleasant).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do you know it will make your relationship stronger.  Do you feel<br/>
&gt;especially tight with those who have imposed their will on you?  Do you<br/>
&gt;think, &quot;Thank God you knowingly inflicted stress on me, I feel honored,<br/>
&gt;and now we&#39;re just as tight as we can be.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is painful for any loving parent to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their child experience pain and even suffering,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certainly we don&#39;t want our children to experience<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more pain than they can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (developmentally/personality-wise) handle, but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best favor we can do them is teaching them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; effective<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; skills for *handling* those experiences, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protecting them from ever experiencing them at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why?  Why can&#39;t we talk about the best possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; situations for our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; children?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I believe I am.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How is it the best thing to inflict stress?  I suppose you felt it was<br/>
&gt;just jim dandy when Dad said you had to go to bed now even though you<br/>
&gt;weren&#39;t tired?  Or Mom pestered you thirty times a day to say please, as<br/>
&gt;if you weren&#39;t smart enough to figure it out?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why are you assuming that this is not what I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; espousing?  Why is setting reasonable boundaries not a<br/>
&gt; &gt; part of our duties to make life a &#39;best possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience&#39;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Who decides what &quot;reasonable&quot; boundaries are?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lots of studies show that children feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; frustrated and angry with boundaries when they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; inconvenient to temporary urges, but long-term are<br/>
&gt; &gt; more secure and better able to deal with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; vicissitudes of life.  What&#39;s so bad about that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How can a study show that a child is more secure when his trusted<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; AND I think he will still manage to find me a<br/>
&gt; &gt; supportive person in the fulfillment of his dreams...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hope he does.<br/>

  Just on a curiousity level, are you implying that we should not set<br/>
standards for our children?<br/>
 Are you saying, for example, don&#39;t teach them the proper way to brush their<br/>
teeth....who then deals with the pain of tooth decay?  The parent or the<br/>
child?  Isn&#39;t it our responsibility as parents to teach them the correct<br/>
method so that the child has a reduced chance of pain from tooth decay and<br/>
the parent less cost in fixing damaged teeth?<br/>
  Or, don&#39;t teach them the proper way to drive (setting boundries), let them<br/>
learn by their own interest,experiences....please try to  explain that to a<br/>
police officer or to the person your child damaged by their lack of<br/>
boundries.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; by life (death of loved ones, accidents, illness,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; etc).<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Yes, I am saying this as fact.  Many studies have been<br/>
&gt;  &gt; done (in the US and in the Netherlands, particularly)<br/>
&gt;  &gt; on prosocial behavior, depression and anxiety, and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; abusive/aggressive personalities, all of which have<br/>
&gt;  &gt; shown that children who are overprotected from<br/>
&gt;  &gt; experiencing a certain amount of stress grow up<br/>
&gt;  &gt; without being given the chance to learn (primarily<br/>
&gt;  &gt; through parental role modeling and parental behavioral<br/>
&gt;  &gt; training/counseling) valuable skills in dealing with<br/>
&gt;  &gt; stress, adverse behavior of others, frustration,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; anger, compromise and negotiation, prosocial behavior,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; etc.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Could you please give me the source, link, reference?  I&#39;d really love<br/>
&gt;  to read these numerous studies.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; You believe that you cannot be supportive *and* set<br/>
&gt;  &gt; boundaries/inflict a certain amount of stress?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I believe I am a helper.  And yes, I avoid causing her stress.<br/>
&gt;  Sometimes I f*** up, and in that situation, I am the first to tell her,<br/>
&gt;  and I am the first to apologize.  Purposely inflicting anything on<br/>
&gt;  anyone seems very wrong.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; My<br/>
&gt;  &gt; son, for instance, finds it extremely stressful to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; talk about or deal with learning social skills such as<br/>
&gt;  &gt; meeting people&#39;s eyes, dealing with bullies, making<br/>
&gt;  &gt; friendly advances to people, etc... but if I indulge<br/>
&gt;  &gt; him in his avoidant behavior he will not learn these<br/>
&gt;  &gt; things,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Or maybe, just like talking or walking, he would learn these things on<br/>
&gt;  his own, when he felt ready.  &quot;Sorry, Johnny, I know you can&#39;t swim and<br/>
&gt;  you are very afraid of the water, but lets just start you right here in<br/>
&gt;  the cold deep end, shall we?&quot;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; and without them he is vulnerable to a variety<br/>
&gt;  &gt; of abuses from others.  I might look like a bad guy<br/>
&gt;  &gt; for a little while to him... as I did when I did<br/>
&gt;  &gt; holding therapy with him as a toddler<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Again, I mention the method used in Son-Rise.<br/>
&gt;  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.option.org/index.html">http://www.option.org/index.html</a><br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; ... but in the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; long run he will benefit and it will make our<br/>
&gt;  &gt; relationship stronger (as the holding therapy did,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; although at the time it was *very* stressful and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; unpleasant).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  How do you know it will make your relationship stronger.  Do you feel<br/>
&gt;  especially tight with those who have imposed their will on you?  Do you<br/>
&gt;  think, &quot;Thank God you knowingly inflicted stress on me, I feel honored,<br/>
&gt;  and now we&#39;re just as tight as we can be.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; It is painful for any loving parent to see<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; their child experience pain and even suffering,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; certainly we don&#39;t want our children to experience<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; more pain than they can<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; (developmentally/personality-wise) handle, but the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; best favor we can do them is teaching them<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; effective<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; skills for *handling* those experiences, not<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; protecting them from ever experiencing them at<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; all!<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Why?  Why can&#39;t we talk about the best possible<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; situations for our<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt; children?<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I believe I am.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  How is it the best thing to inflict stress?  I suppose you felt it was<br/>
&gt;  just jim dandy when Dad said you had to go to bed now even though you<br/>
&gt;  weren&#39;t tired?  Or Mom pestered you thirty times a day to say please, as<br/>
&gt;  if you weren&#39;t smart enough to figure it out?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Why are you assuming that this is not what I am<br/>
&gt;  &gt; espousing?  Why is setting reasonable boundaries not a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; part of our duties to make life a &#39;best possible<br/>
&gt;  &gt; experience&#39;?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Who decides what &quot;reasonable&quot; boundaries are?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Lots of studies show that children feel<br/>
&gt;  &gt; frustrated and angry with boundaries when they are<br/>
&gt;  &gt; inconvenient to temporary urges, but long-term are<br/>
&gt;  &gt; more secure and better able to deal with the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; vicissitudes of life.  What&#39;s so bad about that?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  How can a study show that a child is more secure when his trusted<br/>
&gt;  helpers are voluntarily and methodically planting known stressors in his<br/>
&gt;  path?  I do not see how a study could use this kind of reasoning.<br/>
&gt;  Again, I beg to read these many studies.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; I find that the school system available to us is not<br/>
&gt;  &gt; aimed to provide a &#39;reasonable&#39; amount of stress for a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; child of my particular child&#39;s combination of needs<br/>
&gt;  &gt; and personality traits... the amount of stress caused<br/>
&gt;  &gt; by the sexual harassment and physical abuse he is<br/>
&gt;  &gt; experiencing there goes beyond his ability to cope.  I<br/>
&gt;  &gt; could, of course, be wrong.  I hope not.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I&#39;m sure he is better off at home.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; I am also not entirely unschooling my child, in the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; pure sense of the word.  I am adjusting the process to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; fit my and my child&#39;s needs as best I can... we will<br/>
&gt;  &gt; have a certain amount of housework scheduled in, for<br/>
&gt;  &gt; instance, although I know my child will find this<br/>
&gt;  &gt; stressful and unpleasant to some degree. Tough.  Ifind it unpleasant,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; too, to a much greater degree<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I understand that you are ill, and I am sorry, but how do you know that<br/>
&gt;  you find it more unpleasant?  And if it is so unpleasant, maybe you<br/>
&gt;  could brainstorm for some better options.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; (because it is physically painful for me), but it<br/>
&gt;  &gt; needs to be done, and as part of the family unit he<br/>
&gt;  &gt; has the responsibility (IMO as his parent) to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; participate in the necessary processes of upkeeping<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the family&#39;s quality of life.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Is quality of life synonymous with a clean house?  Is quality of life<br/>
&gt;  synonymous with stress?  Is quality of life synonymous with imposing<br/>
&gt;  one&#39;s will upon another being?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; I can empathize with<br/>
&gt;  &gt; his frustration, I can help him problem solve to make<br/>
&gt;  &gt; it as easy to tolerate as possible... that will<br/>
&gt;  &gt; hopefully give him some useful coping skills to use in<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the future.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I agree.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; But he still needs to deal with it, like<br/>
&gt;  &gt; it or not, and I will be inflicting stress... and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; believe that it will be good for him.  Same goes for<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the social training.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Some people like to be alone.  Social training, for them, would be<br/>
&gt;  synonymous to forced basketball practice for someone who loathes sports.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; I think in the end it is more<br/>
&gt;  &gt; important for me to be his parent than to be his<br/>
&gt;  &gt; friend, when I have to choose between one and the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; other... I believe that in doing so I am being more<br/>
&gt;  &gt; truly his friend in the long run.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  What is your distinction between parent and friend?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; AND I think he will still manage to find me a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; supportive person in the fulfillment of his dreams...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I hope he does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727819429">Can you explain what stress they are getting naturally if you are removing<br/>
all boundaries and believe that simple lessons in living in the real world<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be taught?  What, &quot;he took my toy&quot; or &quot;waaaa, my Barbie broke?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As to being sent to bed when a parent determined the time, there are more<br/>
than one type of doing this.  The arbitrary, &quot;it is 9 p.m., you will go to<br/>
bed&quot; and the parent who is aware of a child who gets beyond the point of<br/>
knowing their are tired and keeps going like they are in a race with the<br/>
Energizer bunny.  I have one of those and I send her to bed.  The minute her<br/>
head hits the pillow she is out.  If you don&#39;t send her to bed, she gets<br/>
physically ill.  I&#39;m thinking the &quot;stress&quot; of being sent to bed is better<br/>
for her than the &quot;stress&quot; of vomiting and spending a day in bed with a<br/>
fever.<br/>
<br/>
And, children do not &quot;naturally&quot; use phrases such as &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank<br/>
you.&quot;  Quite frankly, without any of the very minimal boundaries talked<br/>
about, I&#39;m not thinking the child is going to grow up to be a very &quot;nice&quot;<br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem, IMHO, with the world today is that society is too<br/>
narcistic.  Parents who lived through WWII went out of their way to give,<br/>
give, give to their kids and now we seeing a whole load of folks that are so<br/>
materialistic that, quite frankly, it sucks!  And their kids are spoiled<br/>
brats that no one wants to be around.<br/>
<br/>
Living in a group and learning give and take is not going to rob any child<br/>
of their childhood or happiness.  Learning to share is not a detrimental<br/>
stress.<br/>
<br/>
I wouln&#39;t go so far as to say a spoiled brat is in for a miserable life, but<br/>
they sure are in for a rude awakening because the rest of the world isn&#39;t<br/>
going to cater to their unrealistic expectations of being catered to.<br/>
<br/>
It seems cruel to cater to a child&#39;s every whim and then expect them to be<br/>
able to handle real life.  The real world isn&#39;t going to run around finding<br/>
other options for something as simple as &quot;it&#39;s time to go shopping, get your<br/>
shoes on.&quot;  The rest of the world isn&#39;t going to say,&quot;oh, I&#39;m sorry this<br/>
doesn&#39;t suit your needs, I&#39;ll pospone the family&#39;s needs or make alternate<br/>
arrangements so that I don&#39;t inconvenience your play time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have met quite a few unschoolers, several of whom are currently attending<br/>
college.  All had some basic social boundaries taught and were expected to<br/>
be contributing members of the family unit.  They don&#39;t consider that to be<br/>
a contributing factor to any childhood unhappiness.  In fact, when I asked a<br/>
friend&#39;s daughter (she is now 22 and attending Stanford), she looked at me<br/>
like I had a screw loose, &quot;Yeah, we had one of *those&quot; in my freshman class,<br/>
he lasted about 3 months and dropped out.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am not saying that is as much as they can handle.  I am saying that<br/>
&gt; &gt;children get a pretty incredible amount of stress naturally.  Nobody<br/>
&gt; &gt;needs to impose it upon them.  I also think it is a sad statement to say<br/>
&gt; &gt;that a child is in for a miserable life if they have a happy childhood.<br/>
&gt; &gt;My definition of happy childhood=adult helpers showing children how to<br/>
&gt; &gt;avoid stress, not run right into it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;must?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In our house, we would try to find a better solution.  I might suggest<br/>
&gt; &gt;that the child could stay with the friend while I went to the grocery<br/>
&gt; &gt;store, or wait until Dad got home, or hire a sitter, or wait until the<br/>
&gt; &gt;morning when the child wants to go to the store.  I might suggest we<br/>
&gt; &gt;order pizza or eat *gasp* spaghettios.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;How is this good for the family?  I have never seen a family that is<br/>
&gt; &gt;happy at the expense of someone else&#39;s happiness.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Perhaps a parent could help the child learn to experience anger.  A<br/>
&gt; &gt;parent need not inflict this frustration or hurt in order to help a<br/>
&gt; &gt;child.  The child will get plenty in due time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Ummm, nah.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;How do you know this?  When I hear of grown unschoolers, free schoolers,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and adults with relatively easy childhoods, I hear of  people who seem<br/>
&gt; &gt;happy and fulfilled.  These are the people who are not focusing on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;horrors of the world.  These are the people that bounce back from the<br/>
&gt; &gt;burns and social ostracism because these are the people with high self<br/>
&gt; &gt;esteems, people with unconditional love backing them, people who trust<br/>
&gt; &gt;the world because, at least, they could trust their parents as toddlers<br/>
&gt; &gt;and young children, and even teens.  These are the people who can handle<br/>
&gt; &gt;challenges because boundaries  weren&#39;t arbitrarily crammed down their<br/>
&gt; &gt;throats.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am also wondering what your world view is?  Is there not some reason<br/>
&gt; &gt;to expect that the world will dish your son a big plate of happiness?<br/>
&gt; &gt;If the world gives your son a lovely ride, will this anger boot camp be<br/>
&gt; &gt;in vein?<br/>

&gt; Studies *consistently* find that Authoritative<br/>
&gt; parenting, which involves a setting of reasonable<br/>
&gt; boundaries combined with a warm, responsive and<br/>
&gt; democratic parenting style, leads to the best results<br/>
&gt; in terms of self concept, prosocial behavior,<br/>
&gt; achievement, coping skills, etc.  In other words, in<br/>
&gt; parenting, as in much of the rest of life, moderation<br/>
&gt; is the best course.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think we need to realize, though, that the people doing these <br/>
studies have a different opinion about what kind of &quot;achievement&quot; is <br/>
important, and what kind of &quot;coping skills&quot; are best.  I do not agree <br/>
that achievement is important, nor that the typical coping skills are <br/>
necessarily healthy (and I have been trained as a psychological <br/>
counselor).  Therefore, I cannot look to these studies to tell me <br/>
what is best for my child, because the parameters of the study will <br/>
only give the researches the answer to the questions they <br/>
asked....and I believe they are asking the wrong questions, <br/>
therefore getting the wrong answers.  <br/>
<br/>
Authoritarian parenting is not good, we agree on that.  But I don&#39;t <br/>
believe authoritative is any better.  I believe there is a kind of <br/>
parenting that is not measured by any study, and has yet to be <br/>
labeled because so few parents use it, and so few researchers <br/>
understand it.  I personally would call it &quot;intuitive parenting&quot;.  All the <br/>
other labels...authoritarian, permissive, etc....focus on the parents <br/>
disciplinary style.  But I don&#39;t believe you have to focus on that.  <br/>
That&#39;s focusing on externals....behavior.  I believe we need to focus <br/>
on what&#39;s inside....thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, which is <br/>
what makes people behave the way they do.  I don&#39;t think the <br/>
studies focus on that type of parenting, and therefore I personally <br/>
don&#39;t put much faith in those traditional, mainstream type of studies.<br/>

I just had to jump in on this one.  All three of my children were eager to say<br/>
please and thank you when they were just little toddlers.  Its what we<br/>
modeled to them and they enjoyed responding in the same manner.  Our<br/>
family still says please and thank you all the time. I think it is very <br/>

to imitate your parents.  Just like cleaning up the house.  They don&#39;t mind<br/>

boundaries&#39; and &#39;natural stressors&#39; to &#39;inflicting<br/>
hurt&#39; and having boundaries &#39;arbitrarily crammed down<br/>
their throats&#39;.  She equates having boundaries to<br/>
having a miserable childhood.  <br/>
<br/>
There is little doubt that Authoritarian parenting is<br/>
the worst style in terms of outcome for the child,if<br/>
one looks at the studies.  Permissive parenting (of<br/>
the warm/responsive type rather than the neglectful<br/>
type... I give Sarah a benefit of the doubt that she<br/>
does not afford me in assuming that she is speaking of<br/>
the *best* form of this style of parenting rather than<br/>
the *worst*) does give the child an initial base of<br/>
self esteem and trust in the world from which to work.<br/>
<br/>
But studies *also* show that permissive parenting<br/>
often leads to immaturity, lack of impulse control,<br/>
lack of independence and self reliance, lack of social<br/>
responsibility; correlational studies establish a<br/>
relationship between permissive parenting styles and<br/>
procrastination, lowered achievement motivation, goal<br/>
avoidance, lowered self esteem, dysfunctional/avoidant<br/>
coping skills, as well as a dysfunctional ability to<br/>
assess the reasons for low achievement and frustration<br/>
(external assessment, leading to goal avoidance and<br/>
feelings of helplessness and anger).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested can start out with:<br/>
<br/>
Baumrind (various)<br/>
Ferrari (various)<br/>
Rothblum (various)<br/>
Glasgow, Dornbusch, Troyer, Steinberg & Ritter<br/>
Crown, Conn, Marlowe & Edwards<br/>
Dornbusch, Ritter, Leiderman, Roberts & Fraleigh<br/>
Effert & Ferrari<br/>
Maccoby & Martin<br/>
Lamborn, Mounts, Steinberg & Dornbusch<br/>
Beswick, Rothblum & Mann<br/>
<br/>
Recently there has also been a study that links<br/>
permissive parenting style with children&#39;s sleep<br/>
disorders, which have been linked by various studies<br/>
to long-term health, behavioral and achievement<br/>
problems.  (look it up for yourself if you are<br/>
interested, search under &#39;permissive parenting and<br/>
sleep&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
Studies *consistently* find that Authoritative<br/>
parenting, which involves a setting of reasonable<br/>
boundaries combined with a warm, responsive and<br/>
democratic parenting style, leads to the best results<br/>
in terms of self concept, prosocial behavior,<br/>
achievement, coping skills, etc.  In other words, in<br/>
parenting, as in much of the rest of life, moderation<br/>
is the best course.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Goodness, if that is as much stress as kids can<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; handle, and in order to be happy and healthy<br/>
&gt; they must<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; be protected from experiencing anything more<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; difficult, most of them are in for a rather<br/>
&gt; miserable<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  I am not saying that is as much as they can<br/>
&gt; handle.  I am saying that<br/>
&gt; &gt;  children get a pretty incredible amount of stress<br/>
&gt; naturally.  Nobody<br/>
&gt; &gt;  needs to impose it upon them.  I also think it is<br/>
&gt; a sad statement to say<br/>
&gt; &gt;  that a child is in for a miserable life if they<br/>
&gt; have a happy childhood.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  My definition of happy childhood=adult helpers<br/>
&gt; showing children how to<br/>
&gt; &gt;  avoid stress, not run right into it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; I am saying that it is a parental duty to<br/>
&gt; impose<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; boundaries.  When we say &#39;do not touch the<br/>
&gt; element<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; coils on the stove, because it is hot and will<br/>
&gt; burn<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; you&#39;, that is a boundary.  When we say &#39;you may<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; with your friend for two hours, and then we<br/>
&gt; must<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  must?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; go to<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; the store to get food for dinner&#39;, that is a<br/>
&gt; boundary.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  In our house, we would try to find a better<br/>
&gt; solution.  I might suggest<br/>
&gt; &gt;  that the child could stay with the friend while I<br/>
&gt; went to the grocery<br/>
&gt; &gt;  store, or wait until Dad got home, or hire a<br/>
&gt; sitter, or wait until the<br/>
&gt; &gt;  morning when the child wants to go to the store. <br/>
&gt; I might suggest we<br/>
&gt; &gt;  order pizza or eat *gasp* spaghettios.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Often children find these boundaries<br/>
&gt; frustrating and<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; unpleasant, but for their own good and the good<br/>
&gt; of our<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; families,<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  How is this good for the family?  I have never<br/>
&gt; seen a family that is<br/>
&gt; &gt;  happy at the expense of someone else&#39;s happiness.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; it is important to help our kids learn to<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; tolerate a certain amount of frustration,<br/>
&gt; anger, hurt,<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Perhaps a parent could help the child learn to<br/>
&gt; experience anger.  A<br/>
&gt; &gt;  parent need not inflict this frustration or hurt<br/>
&gt; in order to help a<br/>
&gt; &gt;  child.  The child will get plenty in due time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; so, I would love to hear one source stating<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; fact.  No one needs to<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; have stress imposed on them, particularly by<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; trusted advisor, namely<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; their parent.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been wanting to dig up and read the details of at least one of these<br/>
studies.  I know that one of the first was done by a researcher named<br/>
Baumrind (Diana?) at UC Berkeley, but when I searched the net a few days<br/>
ago, I struck out.  Has anyone ever found any formal parenting studies<br/>
printed on line?  I&#39;d be interested in following up the links.<br/>
<br/>
I have a sneaking suspicion I&#39;m a permissive parent, and I&#39;d like to figure<br/>
out what makes these authoritative parents so fabulous.  I might steal a<br/>
few ideas from them, if I was convinced it was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Likely, all the kids in these studies went to school and were exposed to<br/>
substantial peer pressure.  Possibly a super-indulged unschooled kid, (like<br/>
mine), might be less likely to drive drunk or treat sex as a competitive<br/>
sport?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing here, as I have no idea how the studies decided which kids had<br/>
good outcomes and which didn&#39;t.  Income level?  Finishing college?  Getting<br/>
and staying married?  Not getting caught with any dire consequences of<br/>
pre-marital sex?  (Would anyone believe that survey responses about sex and<br/>
drug use would be anywhere close to 100% accurate?  I have to think that<br/>
it&#39;s awfully easy for people to lie or misremember, and I mean regular<br/>
people, not just elected officials.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-179298233">&lt;&lt;I am also not entirely unschooling my child, in the<br/>
pure sense of the word.  I am adjusting the process to<br/>
fit my and my child&#39;s needs as best I can... we will<br/>
have a certain amount of housework scheduled in&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We will have...&quot; indicates to me that you haven&#39;t started unschooling yet.  <br/>
It&#39;s okay not to have unschooled yet, but to preach to an unschooling list <br/>
when it&#39;s theoretical to you and not practice is something to which I object.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I can empathize with<br/>
his frustration, I can help him problem solve to make<br/>
it as easy to tolerate as possible... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah.  And you have one child, who is young, and although you already said <br/>
&quot;Tough&quot; you claim you will empathize.  <br/>
<br/>
I will venture that this is not something you&#39;ve thought out fully, let alone <br/>
tried out, and so please qualify your statements in the future with &quot;I think&quot; <br/>
or &quot;it seems&quot; or &quot;I plan to try&quot; instead of &quot;LOTS of studies,&quot; or &quot;IT IS.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think in the end it is more<br/>
important for me to be his parent than to be his<br/>
friend, when I have to choose between one and the<br/>
other... I believe that in doing so I am being more<br/>
truly his friend in the long run.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You need to be yourself, and deal with him himself, not as a teacher or <br/>
friend or parent, but as a compassionate  human.  that&#39;s where it will be <br/>
real, and not role-playing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And, children do not &quot;naturally&quot; use phrases such as &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank<br/>
you.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mine do, because all the adults around them do.  Mine share, because we share <br/>
with them--clothes, money, time, toys--when I&#39;ve had a toy or game or <br/>
curiosity or tool I thought my kids might break, I kept it up or hidden until <br/>
they were old enough to use it, and when they were older I brought it down <br/>
and shared.  I share the computer.  I share the phone.  Not just with my <br/>
kids, for show, but with anyone--friends, houseguests--who&#39;s over and needs <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The real world isn&#39;t going to run around finding<br/>
other options for something as simple as &quot;it&#39;s time to go shopping, get your<br/>
shoes on.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are options, always.  If a restaurant requires shoes, you <br/>
can&#39;t go in without shoes.  Whether a child was raised one way or another, <br/>
he&#39;s going to wear shoes to restaurants.   When people are late, there are <br/>
consequences, whether or not their parents are still alive.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The rest of the world isn&#39;t going to say,&quot;oh, I&#39;m sorry this<br/>
doesn&#39;t suit your needs, I&#39;ll pospone the family&#39;s needs or make alternate<br/>
arrangements so that I don&#39;t inconvenience your play time.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some parts  of the world will and some parts won&#39;t.  Some people get friends <br/>
for whom punctuality isn&#39;t a requirement.<br/>
<br/>
What was that about puking from staying up? <br/>
If staying up too late made me puke, I wouldn&#39;t do it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have bedtimes, and not one has ever puked from being tired, <br/>
just from maybe having flu.  When they have the flu they 1) sleep A LOT, and <br/>
2) very occasionally puke.  Hmmm....  no correlation whatsoever with staying <br/>
up late when they&#39;re not sick.<br/>
<br/>
I have known kids (and adults) to puke from fear and stress.  I wish not to <br/>
add fear and stress purposely to anyone&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I didn&#39;t mean to ramble but I get so SICK of one study after another been <br/>
sited to show us all what a lousy life we are living or how we&#39;d better <br/>
change quick or we are going to ruin our health, children, finances, etc.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the &quot;studies&quot; we&#39;ve been shown over the years by people who want to <br/>
defend their right to be authoritarian parents comes from Christian groups <br/>
trying to gather money either for goods (curricular materials or books) or <br/>
just plain &quot;send us money to do God&#39;s work.&quot;    I have no interest in <br/>
Christian studies which back up Biblical education or whacking children with <br/>
dowels.  I don&#39;t know if those are that sort of study or not.  Gags me, <br/>
though, when I see those.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Permissive parenting is not Doing Nothing... there are<br/>
two styles of permissive parenting; in several of the<br/>
studies these two permissive styles were examined as<br/>
seperate, though related, styles. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YEEK.  There are not &quot;TWO STYLES OF PERMISSIVE PARENTING.&quot;<br/>
All parenting falls along a continuum.  Perhaps for the purposes of a study <br/>
you read there were two categories used, but that doesn&#39;t equal &quot;two styles&quot; <br/>
which are distinct.  They were defined for purposes of statistical analysis. <br/>
Don&#39;t confuse &quot;studies&quot; and statistics with the real world.  They built a <br/>
model to make a point, they weren&#39;t describing the world in objective terms.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;According to the descriptions in the studies, all<br/>
three parenting styles &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are more than three parenting styles.  I would hope that the studies <br/>
you read weren&#39;t all based on the same models.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I go by the definitions in the studies (this seems<br/>
reasonable, as they coined the prases in the first<br/>
place), and by your descriptions of what you would do<br/>
in the particular instances cited.  By their<br/>
definition, what you describe is permissive parenting.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, definitely confusing words with reality.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Let us also throw out<br/>
all definitions of words and terms, because they are<br/>
simply semantics rather than Truths.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, let us see that &quot;Truths&quot; are not easily defined in studies, and that one <br/>
language defines things that another language can&#39;t even name.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Let us assume<br/>
that those who disagree with us fall into the extreme<br/>
end of a range of behavior and demonize them, so that<br/>
we do not have to listen to what they say.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is that what those studies were doing?  That&#39;s what it seemed some of the <br/>
posters here in the last couple of days were doing.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra (wondering if those researchers have even ever heard of &quot;aware&quot; <br/>
parenting as it has been discussed among unschoolers in the past few years)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-729040582">I agree, I hate to do the dishes and so do my DD&#39;s!  Children learn from the influences they have around them.  Which is why we don&#39;t send them to ps!  When we show our children respect, that is what they learn.  Ironically, my father gave me this poem when my first DD was born 15 years ago, let me see if I can find it.  I say ironically, because I don&#39;t believe my parents raised me this way, except for maybe the first part of the poem!  I had to learn a lot of this stuff on my own after I grew up.  Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
Children Learn What They Live<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with criticism, he learns to condemn.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with hostility, he learns to fight.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with ridicule, he learns to be shy.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with shame, he learns to feel guilty.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with tolerance, he learns to be patient.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with encouragement, he learns confidence.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with praise,  he learns to appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with fairness, he learns justice.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with security, he learns to have faith. <br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with approval, he learns to like himself.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives with acceptance and friendship, he learns to find love in the world.<br/>

I just had to jump in on this one.  All three of my children were eager to say<br/>
please and thank you when they were just little toddlers.  Its what we<br/>
modeled to them and they enjoyed responding in the same manner.  Our<br/>
family still says please and thank you all the time. I think it is very <br/>
natural<br/>
to imitate your parents.  Just like cleaning up the house.  They don&#39;t mind<br/>
cleaning, but dislike picking up, exactly how I am and what I model despite<br/>
my best attempts to do what I say and not what I do LOL.<br/>

cutting up posts and taking things out of context to suit the needs of a<br/>
reply; 3) those who are not in on the beginning of a thread should go back<br/>
and read all the posts before jumping in and making accusations, and 4) the<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;I am also not entirely unschooling my child, in the<br/>
&gt; pure sense of the word.  I am adjusting the process to<br/>
&gt; fit my and my child&#39;s needs as best I can... we will<br/>
&gt; have a certain amount of housework scheduled in&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We will have...&quot; indicates to me that you haven&#39;t started unschooling<br/>
yet.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s okay not to have unschooled yet, but to preach to an unschooling list<br/>
&gt; when it&#39;s theoretical to you and not practice is something to which I<br/>
object.<br/>
<br/>
***what it indicates to you is not germane.  She stated that she was not<br/>
&quot;entirely&quot; unschooling her child.  She was not preaching, she was having a<br/>
discussion about differing view points and when questioned about sources<br/>
gave the sources.  In fact, the other party in the discussion was preaching<br/>
that her methods were the &quot;only&quot; acceptable method.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; I can empathize with<br/>
&gt; his frustration, I can help him problem solve to make<br/>
&gt; it as easy to tolerate as possible... &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ah.  And you have one child, who is young, and although you already said<br/>
&gt; &quot;Tough&quot; you claim you will empathize.<br/>
<br/>
***Yellow-rag journalistic techniques.  And, btw, taking a single word out<br/>
of a phrase and using its explative definition, not its phrase based<br/>
definition to form<br/>
the basis for an answer is a form of lying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will venture that this is not something you&#39;ve thought out fully, let<br/>
alone<br/>
&gt; tried out, and so please qualify your statements in the future with &quot;I<br/>
think&quot;<br/>
&gt; or &quot;it seems&quot; or &quot;I plan to try&quot; instead of &quot;LOTS of studies,&quot; or &quot;IT IS.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***Opinions are like parts of the anatomy, everyone has one.  One has no way<br/>
of knowing how well thought out, fully or otherwise another&#39;s reply is.<br/>
Might the same advise be applied to this reply in that it should be prefaced<br/>
with &quot;IMHO&quot; even if the opinion is not &quot;h&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
***&lt;snip&gt; see above list of &quot;rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Mine do, because all the adults around them do.  Mine share, because we<br/>
share<br/>
&gt; with them--clothes, money, time, toys--when I&#39;ve had a toy or game or<br/>
&gt; curiosity or tool I thought my kids might break, I kept it up or hidden<br/>
until<br/>
&gt; they were old enough to use it, and when they were older I brought it down<br/>
&gt; and shared.  I share the computer.  I share the phone.  Not just with my<br/>
&gt; kids, for show, but with anyone--friends, houseguests--who&#39;s over and<br/>
needs<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
<br/>
***Wouldn&#39;t hiding things be a form of lying?  Wouldn&#39;t a trully honest, no<br/>
artificial barriers type of relationship allow the child to learn the<br/>
consequences of what they are or are not old enough to use?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;The real world isn&#39;t going to run around finding<br/>
&gt; other options for something as simple as &quot;it&#39;s time to go shopping, get<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; shoes on.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course there are options, always.  If a restaurant requires shoes, you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t go in without shoes.  Whether a child was raised one way or another,<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s going to wear shoes to restaurants.   When people are late, there are<br/>
&gt; consequences, whether or not their parents are still alive.<br/>
<br/>
***Non-responsive.  The statement was in relationship to someone finding the<br/>
options, not that there weren&#39;t any options.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;The rest of the world isn&#39;t going to say,&quot;oh, I&#39;m sorry this<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t suit your needs, I&#39;ll pospone the family&#39;s needs or make alternate<br/>
&gt; arrangements so that I don&#39;t inconvenience your play time.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some parts  of the world will and some parts won&#39;t.  Some people get<br/>
friends<br/>
&gt; for whom punctuality isn&#39;t a requirement.<br/>
<br/>
***An assumption with no foundation.  It would have been better to state<br/>
that some people will, not whole parts.  Some people may &quot;have&quot; friends for<br/>
whom punctuality isn&#39;t a requirement, I seriously doubt they &quot;get&quot; them<br/>
because of this habit/behavior that is sometimes perceived as a character<br/>
flaw.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What was that about puking from staying up?<br/>
&gt; If staying up too late made me puke, I wouldn&#39;t do it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
***Nor would I, but I am an adult and not a child who has hypoglycemia and<br/>
various renal problems which do not always allow her to act in a purely<br/>
adult rational manner at all times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids don&#39;t have bedtimes, and not one has ever puked from being tired,<br/>
&gt; just from maybe having flu.  When they have the flu they 1) sleep A LOT,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; 2) very occasionally puke.  Hmmm....  no correlation whatsoever with<br/>
staying<br/>
&gt; up late when they&#39;re not sick.<br/>
<br/>
***That&#39;s nice but your limited knowledge base does not give a foundation<br/>
for making an all encompassing statement which assumes (and we know how that<br/>
is spelled) facts not in evidence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have known kids (and adults) to puke from fear and stress.  I wish not<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; add fear and stress purposely to anyone&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
***Good, then we agree that I should send her to bed since &quot;we&quot; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
wish to add to her stress by allowing her to stay up beyond the point that<br/>
her body can handle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;snip &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ah, definitely confusing words with reality.<br/>
<br/>
***This definately should have been prefaced with or followed by &quot;IMHO&quot;<br/>
After all, if everyone has their own &quot;truths,&quot; then surely everyone must<br/>
have their own realities.<br/>

I just figure ANY list of styles of parenting is arbitrary, and another <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223038189">Okay....I&#39;ve seen the term aware parenting...can someone explain to me what it means? I&#39;ve had a busy week this week, mostly staying at a friends house trying to get my car working. The carb is shot...lets hope we can get it fixed by next week. It may mean a new carburetor...but we are gonna try to see if the one on the parts car works first.<br/>

indulgent and imperfect&quot;.<br/>
