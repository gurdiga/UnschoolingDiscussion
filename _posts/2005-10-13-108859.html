<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642078829">We went for an outing yesterday with our homeschool group.  As we <br/>
were walking along through a park my dd Sarah, age 6, sat down on a <br/>
bench and said, &quot;Oh, I am so hungry,&quot; while holding her stomach.  <br/>
<br/>
Another mother was walking along beside us and said, &quot;Oh, listen to <br/>
you, you drama queen.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Sarah asked, &quot;What&#39;s a drama queen.&quot;  I tried to explain it the best <br/>
I could--&quot;like on TV or a show&quot; and I acted it out a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah then became so angry she she stood in the path behind us and <br/>
began to sputter, &quot;Well, I, but, but, but . . .&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other mother looked back at Sarah and said, &quot;I hope you&#39;re not <br/>
having an asthma attack.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I put my arm around Sarah and leaned down and she said, &quot;But I don&#39;t <br/>
want her to call me a drama queen.  I don&#39;t want to talk to her <br/>
anymore.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;You are not a drama queen.  I think she was joking. Now <br/>
let&#39;s <br/>
get back to the car where I have some snacks and drinks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sarah said, &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s funny.  I don&#39;t like this joke.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other mother then said, &quot;Oh, I was just joking but I guess it <br/>
wasn&#39;t funny to you.  I&#39;m sorry.  Can I call you Sleeping Beauty?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sarah said, &quot;No, just call me Sarah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other mother then walked on ahead and I tried to explain labels <br/>
to Sarah.  And how some grown-ups insult kids because they don&#39;t <br/>
want to hear what they have to say.  And how it&#39;s OK to say you are <br/>
hungry when you are.<br/>
<br/>
The funny part is this other mother had asked me about the Live and <br/>
Learn Conference and I had shown her Rue Kream&#39;s book which I had <br/>
brought for another friend to read.  (Still working on Sandra&#39;s!)  <br/>
This other mother opened the book to the part about doing things for <br/>
kids even when they are able to do for themselves.  The other mother <br/>
and I got in to a discussion during which she said &quot;kids have to do <br/>
for themselves or else they will always take the easy way out.&quot;  I <br/>
disagreed and told her so.  (BTW, her kids are 5, 3 and 1!)<br/>
<br/>
This kept me awake last night as I felt that I should have done more <br/>
to protect Sarah.  Wondering what I could have said or done <br/>
differently.  I also pondered finding a new group to hang out with!<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is the other mother was annoyed at my discussion with her <br/>
and also with Sarah, who had been talking nonstop to all of the <br/>
adults in the group during our walk.  I think this other mother <br/>
meant to put Sarah &quot;in her place.&quot;  I told Sarah adults say things <br/>
like this to make kids be quiet and feel bad about asking for things.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just posting this to see if other people out there have <br/>
run in to adults who are threatened by little kids allowed to speak <br/>
their minds and say what they want when they want it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340020350">Hello, this is my first post on this group but I have been lurking  <br/>
for a while now.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have experienced this with my children and other adults.<br/>
<br/>
Some people can be so rude. I used to do more or less what you did  <br/>
and try to explain to my kids that some people feel threatened by a  <br/>
child who speaks their mind or says things how they see them.<br/>
<br/>
But then one day, a woman spoke to my son and I must have been having  <br/>
an off day. I blasted her, please do not address my child unless your  <br/>
comment is a friendly and discussion based one. Kindly refer all  <br/>
snide and vaguely rude comments about any of my children towards me  <br/>
then I can comment back to you on the same level, adult to adult.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally this went down like a lead balloon but as we were in public  <br/>
and I, normally calm and placid, raised my voice in a firm manner,  <br/>
this has not happened again and my children all said how proud they  <br/>
felt that they mother had spoke up for them when they did not know  <br/>
how to react nor understand what the other woman was going on about.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849718656">I think this was written for me.  My daughter Jessica is very outspoken and loves to take care of<br/>
children younger than her (she&#39;s 10).  We were at Church last night and one of the little 2 year<br/>
old boys was crying and she way trying to console him and this lady (who by the way is a parapro<br/>
at public school) said to her &quot;Jessica, if you were in my class at school you would stay in the<br/>
timeout chair all of the time until you realized that the adults are in charge.&quot;  THEN, after<br/>
Church she brought out a craft that the kids had made and one belonged to my daughter.  I told her<br/>
that I thought Jessica was going to get it and she said &quot;That&#39;s what happens when they know their<br/>
parents will do it for them.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
This morning my little girl said &quot;Mama, I hope she&#39;s not going to be working with the youth all of<br/>
the time.&quot;  I had to agree.  By the way (this is not a judgment but fact) this all comes from a<br/>
woman who has a daughter who by 21 has already joined the Marines and gotten out on a medical<br/>
dischargeand has been married and divorced. She has a son who had his license suspended for about<br/>
6 months.<br/>
<br/>
I am totally not judging because I have three teenage sons and but by the Grace of God go I<br/>
however my boys have thus far been wonderful and guess what, THEY ARE ALL HOMESCHOOLED!<br/>
<br/>
Guess I needed a rant.  Sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728845013">This is kind of like the thread I posted a couple weeks ago about people<br/>
being rude to my kids when they talk to them. I basically just talk to my<br/>
kids about how some people just aren&#39;t nice, or whatever the situation might<br/>
be. I try to make them feel like it isn&#39;t their fault someone wasn&#39;t nice to<br/>
them. Which it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It is really hard for me to bite my tounge, and I do most of the time, but<br/>
sometimes it just slips out and I say something to the adult. I try not to<br/>
let my kids think I am picking a fight, but I want them to know that it<br/>
isn&#39;t ok for people to treat others (even kids) like that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919860188">HI Sandra<br/>
<br/>
adult to adult is and has worked out best. If it were another kid  <br/>
that was rude, then the kids would have just responded in their own way.<br/>
<br/>
My son had to give evidence one day about a very rude adult here and  <br/>
when the police officer asked him how he felt he said that he was  <br/>
shocked and surprised as he did not know that adults spoke to kids  <br/>
like that.<br/>
<br/>
Good point!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567728454">When we first moved to Albuquerque a couple of months ago, I bravely  took <br/>
the kids to a homeschool park day after learning that there were kids close  to <br/>
Logan&#39;s age (12). I say bravely because going into new situations for me  is a <br/>
bit like going to get a root canal..only worse.   We arrived and  the kids <br/>
started playing Frisbee and a group of mom&#39;s sitting in a circle on the  grass <br/>
were very welcoming.  <br/>
 <br/>
Brenna (16) and Logan  joined in a game they were playing  and my perception <br/>
was that all was well...a nice fall day...kids playing.   Apparently, two of <br/>
the girls were having a problem not following the &quot;tag&quot;  rules.  It seemed  to <br/>
me, however, that the kids were  working it out.  <br/>
 <br/>
Suddenly, one of the mom&#39;s stood and marched over to a group of the kids  <br/>
(Logan was in the group) and just started berating  two girls in a voice  that <br/>
could be heard all over the park.  <br/>
She said very mean things and used words like &quot;bitching&quot; and I saw Logan  <br/>
just getting smaller and smaller as he tried to edge away. I don&#39;t know if  <br/>
either of the girls were her daughter. She went on and on and then proudly came  <br/>
back to the circle and plopped down as if &quot;her job was done.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not the first time I had seen a parent behave like this but I think it  <br/>
might have been for Logan.  I was surprised as in &quot;I can&#39;t  believe I just saw <br/>
that kind of way.&quot;  He was shocked and sad and  ready to leave.  Brenna was <br/>
appalled and angry that anyone would speak to  kids that way.  <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t know any of them and had been brave enough to get there but not  <br/>
brave enough to intervene.  We left quietly and neither of the kids have  any <br/>
interest in ever going back. <br/>
 <br/>
It was sad because we had hoped it would be a good opportunity to  meet some <br/>
other people..  Mostly sad, though, because those other kids  didn&#39;t seem at <br/>
all surprised by this women&#39;s outburst.  And even sadder,  that the other mom&#39;s <br/>
didn&#39;t even stop their conversations or seem to  notice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566137379">Wow, must be something in the water!  Happened to me twice today.  We <br/>
went to NAS Pensacola&#39;s FT. Barrancas with some friends.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
9:30 a.m. yet and we were the ONLY ONES THERE.  Anyway, while we <br/>
waited for the place to &quot;officially&quot; open my friends son asked if he <br/>
could ride the scooter in the parking lot.  This lady comes marching <br/>
out with a pamphlet saying, &quot;Welcome&quot; with the most see through, <br/>
clinched teeth smile and says, &quot;Um, you need to go ahead and put that <br/>
scooter up, we have ALOT of elderly people that visit here and we do <br/>
not want anyone to get hurt.&quot;  There are no &quot;No scooter/skateboard&quot; <br/>
signs at this place and it was the parking spot not the sidewalk and <br/>
no one else was there.  Then my dd was sitting in the hatch part of <br/>
our car eating a sandwhich and she looks at Brooke and then me and <br/>
says, &quot;You need to eat that at the picnic tables, you cannot take food <br/>
into the Fort area.&quot;  WTH?!?  She was totally mean, a very grumpy <br/>
person and not just disrespectful to the kids but us too.  I&#39;m not <br/>
used to people treating me this way, so I just bit my tongue, so did <br/>
my friend.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few minutes at the ago at the Winn Dixie, I was in the check <br/>
out line.  I had grabbed one of those little $1.49 dollar magazines. <br/>
Zak asked if I had grabbed &quot;People Magazine&quot; to which I told him, &quot;No, <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what it is just grabbed it to read.&quot; Then this bitter <br/>
cashier pipes in and says, &quot;Your mom has to have something to read, <br/>
she can&#39;t be reading baby books to you all the time.  She&#39;s probably <br/>
sick of reading baby books.  You guys should be reading to your mom.&quot;  <br/>
I was pissed.  I said, &quot;Um, my children read to me all the time and <br/>
they read very well.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Why do people act like this?  I just totally do not understand why <br/>
people are so hateful towards kids.  Who knows, maybe the people at <br/>
the park had had their fill of field trip students or something but <br/>
the woman at the grocery store didn&#39;t know what the hell she was <br/>
talking about.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW...Is the Live and Learn Conference in Pensacola next year? Maybe I <br/>
misread it being in NM but at SandraDodd.com it says Pensacola.  I <br/>
want so badly to meet you all!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m 54. As a child I was terrified of a relation (my father&#39;s cousin&#39;s <br/>
husband - whatever that is!). He insisted on everyone eating what was <br/>
put in front of them. My parents always had me sit between them so they <br/>
could eat the food I didn&#39;t want (one up for my parents!). But his <br/>
family... One time we were staying at their bach (holiday home) and my <br/>
cousin was sent to her room for 3 days, allowed out only to the toilet <br/>
and to sit at the table each day until she ate the dinner she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to eat - same plate of food served up at each mealtime. (She lasted <br/>
that long because she was determined - and because her mother and mine <br/>
sneaked food to her). One time at home apparently, he made her eat <br/>
porrige, which she hated, and when she vomited it up he made her... <br/>
well, let&#39;s not even put it into words.<br/>
<br/>
He was an out and out bully and abusive parent. These days he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
get away with it but we are talking 40 - 50 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
He had 7 children.<br/>
<br/>
At his funeral the eldest son got up and told what a bastard his father <br/>
was. He said how glad he was that his father had lasted for two weeks <br/>
after the massive stroke that killed him, unable to move or talk, <br/>
because it had given the now adult kids the chance to tell him all the <br/>
stuff they had bottled up all those years, to tell him what a horrible <br/>
person he had been.<br/>
<br/>
His widow stood up, beaming with joy, and told how one of her daughters <br/>
had given her and her brother airline tickets to go visit family in <br/>
Canada and England now her husband was dead - and talked about how she <br/>
couldn&#39;t wait, and what fun life was going to be now.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been a perfect parent, I&#39;ve made a lot of mistakes - but I <br/>
KNOW my kids won&#39;t be saying that sort of stuff at my funeral!<br/>
<br/>
What a sad, sad man. What a sad, sad death.<br/>
<br/>
We need to protect our kids to the best of our ability - my parents did <br/>
what they could to the best of their ability at that time in history. I <br/>
know I have done better. But I think it doesn&#39;t do us any harm to think <br/>
about the sad lives these sort of people live, and once we are done with <br/>
protecting ourselves and our precious children, feel compassion for <br/>
people whose lives are so sad and bitter and twisted and, well, SAD.<br/>
<br/>
Cally<br/>
PS. Personally I got over my fear of this man when I was about 19. He <br/>
came to dinner, and as I was helping my mother serve up, he said, &quot;No <br/>
mushrooms for me thanks, I really don&#39;t like mushrooms.&quot; I paused a <br/>
moment, shocked. Then I put a huge spoonful of mushrooms on his plate, <br/>
handed it to him and said, &quot;In this house, you eat what&#39;s put in front <br/>
of you.&quot; (Exactly how he used to say it to us.) There was a stunned <br/>
silence. My parents, and his wife froze, terrified. We waited - then R <br/>
picked up his knife and fork and ate. And I was never frightened of him <br/>
again. One of the few times my parents expressed pride in anything I did!</div>

Nonviolent Communication, something like:<br/>
&quot;when I hear you calling me a drama queen I fell sad.<br/>
I need to feel safe knowing I won&#39;t get insulted by<br/>
the people we chose to spend time with, would you be<br/>
willing to find a different way to express your<br/>
feelings about my telling my Mom that I am hungry?&quot;<br/>
I know it sounds a little bit contrived, but with<br/>
practice, it can be made to sound better and can get<br/>
easier to say. I&#39;d love to see us teach our children<br/>
to stop the meaness, and open a dialogue. What if we<br/>
taught them to be examples to people like this woman?<br/>
I am just starting to learn about NVC, so I am by no<br/>
means an expert, but it has helped us a great deal<br/>
already, so I thought I&#39;d bring it up. I highly<br/>
recommend Marshal Rosenberg&#39;s Nonviolent Communication<br/>
Videos (I got them at the library.)<br/>

We just finished two months of Lisa being in the cast of a play with our local children&#39;s theater.  I couldn&#39;t believe some of the condescending things that were said to children AND adults during the course of putting it on!  Overall, though, I guess it was worth it.  Lisa LOVED the expericence and managed not to be a direct target of any of the adults running the show.  In a cast of 63 (which included half a dozen adults), 13 were homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about something that I heard recently.  It may have been Joyce, I&#39;m not sure and I may not have the exact quote.<br/>
<br/>
The sentiment was, What if the only thing they learned was, Can I help you with that?<br/>
<br/>
What a neat idea!  Of course it would be impossible for a child to learn nothing else.  But, what if?  What if millions of children grew up with the idea &quot;Can I help you with that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Too often well-meaning adults believe that children benefit when made to do things on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Or they raise children with the idea that &quot;someday you&#39;ll have to do X so you may as well get used to it now&quot;.  I&#39;ve thought of a response for the next time I hear that.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, someday they will need to have sex, so let&#39;s have them practice it while they are children!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375275990">I agree that people sometimes just aren&#39;t appropriate in their<br/>
behavior to children.  Read Jan Hunt&#39;s article on Child Advocacy<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/intervention1.html)">http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/intervention1.html)</a>.  Children<br/>
need special protection because they are learning and need a safe<br/>
place to do that, not to be punished for getting things wrong and<br/>
certainly not for being themselves though a child!  I like the idea<br/>
Jan Hunt presents because all people need to be treated well whether<br/>
adult or not.  I would love to be able to think on my feet and<br/>
practice Hunt&#39;s suggestion but I have to admit I&#39;m very uncomfortable<br/>
in situations where I feel the need to advocate for children.  It&#39;s<br/>
too easy for me to feel anger above the need(s) of others, and I see<br/>
this as my own immaturity at work.  :(<br/>

Have to say though that in our part of the country (Midlands) if <br/>
someone tries to jump in in front of a queue it is considered <br/>
extremely bad manners, I mean really really really Baaaad manners. <br/>
Everyone waits their turn, this is across the board.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not universal  but for some people (me included) it&#39;s still <br/>
seen as good manners to let an elderly or disabled person get on to <br/>
a bus before you. Also if I&#39;m queuing at the checkout in a <br/>
supermarket and I have a trolley full and someone is behind and has <br/>
only a couple of items I&#39;d let them go before me. Seems fairly <br/>
common practice. I still say thank you to the bus driver when I get <br/>
off, I am not the only one that does this, it&#39;s fairly common.<br/>
<br/>
If someone gets on the bus with a baby,or is pregant or elderly or <br/>
disabled then I&#39;d give up my seat to let them sit down. This is a <br/>
disappearing thing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think many of these manners exist in London at all. Often it <br/>
seems that people visiting London assume the rest of the UK is like <br/>
London. It&#39;s not at all like London and people, manners and language <br/>
can be very very different even if it&#39;s two towns 20 miles away from <br/>
each other.<br/>
<br/>
Have to say that if someone tried to queue jump in front of me I <br/>
would probably say something to them about it.  If you don&#39;t stand <br/>
in the queue then you have to go last.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712358957">Hi Elaine<br/>
<br/>
In Tyne & Wear, just about six miles outside of Newcastle we live.  <br/>
The manners are disgusting. Everyone thinks that our children are so  <br/>
well mannered as they do all the things that you do. Always say  <br/>
please, thank you etc. Let people go in front of them in the  <br/>
supermarket queue if they are queuing with lots of things in a  <br/>
trolley and the person behind has one or two things.<br/>
<br/>
When we first moved here from London, it was shocking. Kids spitting  <br/>
everywhere you look, even the adult males do it. We find this foul.<br/>
<br/>
Little kids as young as eight smoke and you see ten year olds with  <br/>
cans of beer while their mothers sit tanning themselves or smoking pot.<br/>
<br/>
The kids get their rudeness around here and vocabulary from the  <br/>
mothers. We have heard the way that some mothers speak to kids  <br/>
outside and it is highly insulting even swear words  are used. The  <br/>
way that they speak to each other leaves a lot to be desired too.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that though, it seems to be in patches around the  <br/>
North East that we have found this. On the whole the people are  <br/>
genuine and friendly. But then its always the small groups like the  <br/>
ones described above from where we live that spoil the atmosphere for  <br/>
everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
I would not accept adults speaking to my children in an insulting or  <br/>
degrading tone of voice. I think people know that where we live now  <br/>
and keep their distance.<br/>
<br/>

they might need to take the question home and sleep with it.<br/>

I got in that line and stayed very still.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

someone tries to jump in in front of a queue it is considered<br/>

<br/>
Here too, only we&#39;re less likely to queue.   At a bus stop in Albuquerque, <br/>
some people will sit on the bench, some will stand around, some will lean on <br/>
poles or be reading window signs.   When the bus is in view some might line up <br/>
but most won&#39;t.   Generally, a person will make eye contact with those who were <br/>
there before he was, offering for them to go on ahead of him.   So it&#39;s not <br/>
that we don&#39;t know what the order of arrival is, it&#39;s that it&#39;s not that <br/>
pressing.   People with bags or impediments will probably be allowed on first or <br/>
helped out.   Sometimes the person who got there first will hang back and get on <br/>
last, but maybe because he just doesn&#39;t like crowds, or is getting off soon.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s that way everywhere in the country.<br/>
<br/>
At the video store by my house, if there aren&#39;t many people there, we make <br/>
one line for all the windows.   When it&#39;s very crowded, one line would keep <br/>
people from moving around the store, so several lines might form, but not necessari<br/>
ly one per cash register.   And if I&#39;m in the front of my line and I know the <br/>
person at the front of the other line was there before I was, I might gesture <br/>
for her to go ahead when it&#39;s &quot;my turn.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Lots of people say something.   &quot;Thank you&quot; or &quot;Thanks&quot; or &quot;See ya!&quot; or &quot;Have <br/>
a good day.&quot;   <br/>

 It is amazing to me sometimes how only 20 miles here in the UK or even less<br/>
sometimes &lt;g&gt;<br/>
people have such regional differences.  I&#39;ve personally never known people<br/>

visiting all over the UK they often requested &quot;splashed&quot; eggs!! at breakfst<br/>
even though I did tell them it was very<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508016913">I know a man who was born in Peterlee (just a hop, skip and a jump<br/>
from us) who can tell specifically which town someone is from based on<br/>
 relatively subtle differences in their accent.  But, last night,<br/>
