<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101847519">help. I need advice&gt; We unschool our three children, ten, seven and 22months. In the last few days we have been approached by my folks wanting to move in with us. They are getting up in years and recently my father lost his job. They are concerned for their future. I understand where they are coming from. Has anyone had to explain to their families how they unschool? They know we homeschool and have only said they hope I know  what I&#39;m doing! But they have never been around enough as of yet to view how we learn and play. Since we have only been doing this for less than a year I thought I&#39;d cross that bridge later. Well it seems later is now. Any suggestions would be great. Also has anyone had to deschool their children? I&#39;ve heard it can take up to a year? Any comments? Thanks, kimberly</div>

 </span></blockquote>When they arrive, you *could* just say that you&#39;re taking the &quot;three month <br/>
summer break&quot; NOW. That way they could see the learning that happens during <br/>
&quot;break&quot; (and be sure to casually point it out every day!). Then when the <br/>
three months are &quot;up&quot;, you could begin to explain unschooling and how they DO <br/>
learn every day.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling can last longer than a year. I think it depends on the child: how <br/>
long he was in school, how demanding school (and YOU!) were, and how <br/>
sensitive he is. Cameron is extremely sensitive, was 8 years in a demanding <br/>
private school, and was pushed by us to &quot;perform&quot;. He took over a <br/>
year---almost 18 months, I guess, to deschool. Sleeping, watching TV, staring <br/>
at the ceiling a lot, thinking deeply, and &quot;veging out&quot;. He&#39;s still scarred, <br/>
but he&#39;s back to his old (passionate-about-learning five-year-old-like) self.<br/>
<br/>
I think a &quot;tough&quot; child with fewer years in a &quot;less demanding&quot; school, with <br/>
parents that never really worried about his &quot;progress&quot; can probably deschool <br/>
quickly and easily.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;rule of thumb&quot; is one month per year in school---mileage varies.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the grands!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450336108">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question. <br/>
Remember no question is a dumb question : /<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and Deschooling.  When my son left school I deschooled right <br/>
away, now we Unschool. Someone please tell me if I have one of the <br/>
definitions wrong because to me they are the same?  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are your definitions?<br/>
<br/>
Mine: <br/>
DEschooling is the &quot;down time&quot;---the veging out period to &quot;detox&quot; from the <br/>
effects of school. May be short or long depending on the amount of damage <br/>
that was done to the child in the school system (the adult, too---many adults <br/>
have a harder/longer time deschooling to get to unschooling!). Not much <br/>
learning is &quot;visible&quot; as the child is learning to love learning again.<br/>
<br/>
UNschooling is when the freedom takes hold and the learning starts. It&#39;s when <br/>
the peace and wholeness and joy are visible again---when you can see that <br/>
spark in their eyes that all five year olds have! It&#39;s when they start asking <br/>
questions again and enjoying life again. It&#39;s beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
I have one that had to deschool and one that will never see a school. Both <br/>
are amazing to watch. Duncan will always love to learn, but it was lovely to <br/>
watch the fire come back in to Cameron (I just wish it had never left)--but I <br/>
can say I WATCHED it happen! It&#39;s gradual, but obvious.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. And I nagged. You CANNOT count the time as DEschooling UNTIL you quite <br/>
nagging. If you are going smoothly for 3-4 weeks and then nag that couldn&#39;t <br/>
he pick up a book or DO *some*thing?, you need to start counting <br/>
again---&#39;cause you&#39;ve &quot;renigged&quot; on that trust thing! Deschooling starts <br/>
AFTER the nagging stops. Be patient. Yes, I DID wang out right regularly, but <br/>
I was seeing tiny sparks of it working---and I was GLUED to unschooling.com&#39;s <br/>
message boards. That helped A LOT! I had to MAKE myself STOP many <br/>
times!---Deep breaths and busy myself somewhere else. Almost forget he was <br/>
there. I played &quot;hard to get&quot; &lt;g&gt;---in a good way. I waited until he came to <br/>
ME.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, seeing as I have about a dozen passions and am bit of a nut, there&#39;s <br/>
not a problem with their seeing me BUSY! I&#39;m often doing three or four things <br/>
at a time! They NEED to see me veg out! &lt;G&gt; Which usually does happen after a <br/>
huge, long burst of activity---I may lie around for two or three days.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think deschooling YOURself and find your own passions would definitely <br/>
be a BIG step! They learn a lot by example: so let them see you pursue a <br/>
passion or two---something you&#39;ve never done before ---or that is hard or <br/>
intricate. Let them see you struggle a bit. And let them see you totally IN <br/>
LOVE with what you&#39;re doing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665205655">If you are unschooling, and have been, what need is there to deschool?<br/>
<br/>
If your parents are going to move in with you, I think you need to create <br/>
*very* firm boundries about your parenting decisions.  Unschooling is one of <br/>
them.  If we are unashamed, we have nothing to hide.  If they, being <br/>
whomever not your parents, don&#39;t like it, TOUGH!  (I;ve learned that the <br/>
hard way.)  If you bring them into your home, they MUST respect your <br/>
decisions.  I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way!<br/>

<br/>
Fallow phases are common, but if you&#39;re feeling like a long-term dullard with <br/>
no plans to perk up, that could be problematical.<br/>
<br/>
Whether your kids would be happier or not, if you and your husband don&#39;t have <br/>
a broad scope of interests, will the kids suffer from lack of modelling?  <br/>
Genetics?  When you don&#39;t do things, do you also say negative things like, <br/>
&quot;Well that stuff is boring&quot; or &quot;...stupid&quot; or &quot;...for snobs&quot;?  (thinking back <br/>
to things MY mother said about things she didn&#39;t want to bestir herself to do <br/>
or take me to do).<br/>
<br/>
I think my kids have a multi-faceted view of the world because they see me <br/>
and my husband and other adult friends of ours doing things just for fun, <br/>
doing hard things they don&#39;t have to do, getting excited about something <br/>
they&#39;ve learned.<br/>
<br/>
To say parents HAVE to have passionate interests is saying too much, but I&#39;ve <br/>
seen families where the parents want to do nothing but clean house, go to <br/>
work, watch TV and sleep, but somehow they expect their children to involve <br/>
themselves in sports, music, art, research, volunteer work, and feats of <br/>
engineering wonder.  If that doesn&#39;t happen, they stretch and yawn and say <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t working.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt you&#39;re one of those, Heidi.   Maybe you&#39;re just cocooning.  <br/>
Seems sometimes when things get still in a person, and quiet, and then a calm <br/>
restlessness or sense of impending *something* comes, and then they blossom <br/>
out again, some new project, some new ideas, something notable starts to <br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big range between being quiet and not super-busy and being <br/>
paralyzed and negative.  Some people exude negativity about other people&#39;s <br/>
hobbies and interests too.  THAT can be a black hole in a family, teaching <br/>
everybody that if they DO feel enthusiasm for something, not to express it.<br/>

<br/>
I agree about the firm boundaries!<br/>
<br/>
Can you have a point by point discussion with your parents about ways<br/>
you ARE willing to change your life and ways that you AREN&#39;T?  (Then the<br/>
glass isn&#39;t just &quot;half empty&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
For instance, maybe you are willing (if they move in) to buy the foods<br/>
your parents like at the grocery store and cook around their dietary<br/>
restrictions, but you aren&#39;t willing to let them bug your kids about<br/>
what they chose to eat.  Maybe you are willing to have everyone in the<br/>
house be quiet from 9pm onwards every night, but maybe you also want<br/>
everyone in the house to try to be quiet until 1pm the next day.  Maybe<br/>
you aren&#39;t willing for them to comment about what time other people<br/>
choose to get up.  (These are just hypothetical, I&#39;m not suggesting that<br/>
these are the right rules for you.)<br/>
<br/>
I know it would be extremely stressful for me to incorporate other<br/>
adults into my home, at least the ones that I&#39;m related, to.<br/>
<br/>
This is a major decision that requires a lot of thought, and maybe a<br/>
trial visit as a source of information and a reality check.  (It&#39;s hard<br/>
to make a good decision based on unreality.  How much time have your<br/>
parents spent in contact with children in their natural habitat? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
If my parents wanted help and were willing to move, I would probably<br/>
want a solution that had them living about 5 minutes away from my house,<br/>
but not living with me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110273883">Thank you Kelly<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about it, the more I realize, my whole entire life <br/>
has been spent either at school or thinking &quot;school&quot; was the best way <br/>
to educate, so deschooling for REAL is the way to go. I&#39;m much better <br/>
now than I have been, but somehow just burst out with a &quot;NO! read <br/>
this book instead!&quot; once in awhile! L<br/>
<br/>
Just can&#39;t contain meself! L <br/>
<br/>
But maybe accepting myself includes accepting how we do things as a <br/>
family, which will lead to lots of interests and passions based on <br/>
HOW WE DO THINGS and WHAT WE ALREADY ENJOY. Which, to be honest, the <br/>
bread baking has led to so many cool, interesting mornings. So maybe <br/>
we already have a bit of a handle on some of it. <br/>

thanks again. I&#39;m getting there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350720065">Hi Sandra. Thanks for the reply<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Fallow phases are common, but if you&#39;re feeling like a long-term <br/>
 </span></blockquote>dullard with <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; no plans to perk up, that could be problematical.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s just been a really stressful winter for me, with many different <br/>
facets of my life, and homeschooling being a large part of it. The <br/>
awakening that came from ditching the strict scheduled curriculum, <br/>
and then reading Gatto and Holt!!! whew, but with that awakening, the <br/>
doubts. Along with some social stresses and a very tight money <br/>
situation...and being prone to melancholy and introspection, and <br/>
coming out of winter. But we do have &quot;some plans to perk up&quot; (I like <br/>
that phrase ;) like a garden and chickens and swimming when the pool <br/>
opens. Hiking, birding, outdoor cooking, and bagel baking. <br/>
<br/>
When you don&#39;t do things, do you also say negative things like, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Well that stuff is boring&quot; or &quot;...stupid&quot; or &quot;...for snobs&quot;?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(thinking back <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to things MY mother said about things she didn&#39;t want to bestir <br/>
 </span></blockquote>herself to do <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or take me to do).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, we never do that, though there might be some &quot;I just don&#39;t have <br/>
it in me right now,&quot; a bit more than usual at this time. guess I&#39;m <br/>
just coming to a place where I can be contented in my own style of <br/>
doing things for fun or interest or even for responsibility or duty <br/>
and not necessarily because of a passion for them.<br/>
<br/>
Our 15 year old has lots of interests and we cart her here and there <br/>
for many different things. As for our own interests, money is a big <br/>
factor, but it&#39;s more my hubby than me. &quot;How can we do (fill in the <br/>
blank)? No money!&quot; With a little bit of imagination and some work, <br/>
there&#39;s fun things to do for free. My desire has been for us to find <br/>
a family vision, or at least for us parents, or even for just ME, to <br/>
find a passion.<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn&#39;t happen, they stretch and yawn and say <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschooling isn&#39;t working.<br/>
&gt; I seriously doubt you&#39;re one of those, Heidi. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yeah, I don&#39;t see us as doing that, either.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re just cocooning.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Seems sometimes when things get still in a person, and quiet, and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>then a calm <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; restlessness or sense of impending *something* comes, and then they <br/>
 </span></blockquote>blossom <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; out again, some new project, some new ideas, something notable <br/>
 </span></blockquote>starts to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; happen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a big range between being quiet and not super-busy and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>being <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; paralyzed and negative.  Some people exude negativity about other <br/>
 </span></blockquote>people&#39;s <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hobbies and interests too.  THAT can be a black hole in a family, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>teaching <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; everybody that if they DO feel enthusiasm for something, not to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>express it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thanks for the terrific input, sandra<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Yes, I think deschooling YOURself and find your own passions would definitely <br/>
be a BIG step! They learn a lot by example: so let them see you pursue a <br/>
passion or two---something you&#39;ve never done before ---or that is hard or <br/>
intricate. Let them see you struggle a bit. And let them see you totally IN <br/>
LOVE with what you&#39;re doing!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I find that I&#39;m having a hard time with this, finding my own passion isn&#39;t the hard part, but giving myself permission to follow them. I often hear my parents and teachers voices in my head telling me that my interests are pointless and will never amount to anything so why bother. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to get past all that. I tend to get very interested in something, then start wondering if it will &#39;lead anyware productive&#39; and get depressed and never follow through.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m getting a chance to come to terms with all of this and I hope to find a way through it, so that Jaiden and Avery don&#39;t see me never finishing anything.<br/>

Hi, Rebecca --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a tough problem.  I hope you can throw off their attitudes and<br/>
start to spend your time is ways that are pleasing to you, whether or<br/>
not they improve the world or generate income or look good to others.<br/>
<br/>
I lean in the direction of being a couch potato, and am pretty good at<br/>
making those Puritan work ethic voices, the ones that say every moment<br/>
should be productive, go away.<br/>

<br/>
This is me to a T, especially since money is very tight right now. I <br/>
find myself wishing the things I&#39;m into were &quot;productive&quot; as in, of <br/>
monetary value, and then throw up my hands and say phooey on it.<br/>
<br/>
But this deschooling thing, somewhere I read, a month for every year <br/>
I was in school, plus a month for every year that I have considered <br/>
school the only way to learn or &quot;did school at home&quot; with the kids <br/>
(which would be 12 + 8=20 months, or two years, for me! ack) but it <br/>
makes sense, especially after reading Gatto, who points out over and <br/>
over again, and very aptly, the damage that institutionalization does <br/>
to human beings. Get away from the institutional mindset.<br/>
<br/>
well, anyway, I&#39;m thinking aloud again.<br/>

I can relate.  I asked myself:  what is &#39;productive&#39; anyway? For whom is it<br/>
productive?  them? me?  If I am enjoying it, then it IS productive.  It&#39;s<br/>
making me happy and fulfilled.  When and if I stop enjoying it, is ok too. <br/>
But it belongs to me and only me, because no one can feel my feelings.  That<br/>
helped me..now I tend to have too many projects going at once..lol. :-)<br/>

<br/>
CERTIFICATE OF EMPOWERMENT<br/>
<br/>
As bearer of this certificate you are no longer required to depend on the <br/>
advice of experts. You may step back and view the entire world-not just your <br/>
home, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth-as a learning experience, a <br/>
laboratory containing languages (and native speakers thereof), plants, <br/>
animals, history, geology, weather (real live weather, in the sky, not in a <br/>
book), music, art , mathematics, physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, <br/>
and ideas without end. Although collections of these treasures have been <br/>
located in museums for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere <br/>
else, too. <br/>
This authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy your kids; to rejoice <br/>
when your children surpass you in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make <br/>
mistakes, and to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may allow your children <br/>
to experience boredom without taking full responsibility for finding them <br/>
something to do. <br/>
Henceforth you shall neither be required nor expected to finish everything <br/>
you start. Projects, books, experiments and plans may be discontinued as soon <br/>
as something more interesting comes along (or for any other reason) without <br/>
penalty, and picked up again at any time in the future (or never). <br/>
You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>
feel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>
harm. <br/>
You have leave to think your own thoughts, and to encourage your children to <br/>
think theirs. <br/>
Each person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these <br/>
privileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by <br/>
creating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to <br/>
obtain approval to experiment, to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen <br/>
others do are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the first place. <br/>
