<div id="ygrps-yiv-455612514">Grammar (not &quot;grammer&quot;), as has been suggested, is<br/>
most effectively learned by example through reading<br/>
and listening.  In addition, it is useful to know the<br/>
basic terms, which can be found in any simple English<br/>
language text.  I keep a GED study guide to refer to<br/>
as an outline of the basics in all major academic<br/>
areas.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189480728">There, their; plane, plain; and the list goes on.  As to the &quot;to&quot; and &quot;too&quot;<br/>
errors, the general concensus (that would be of folks in business &<br/>
journalism colleges) is that it is a typo not an incorrect useage of the<br/>
words.  Folks simply don&#39;t add on the extra &quot;o&quot; or hit too many &quot;o&#39;s&quot; as<br/>
they rush through their typing.<br/>
<br/>
With letters to the editor, unless you know that the newspaper in question<br/>
takes their letters to the editor straight from e-mail, then the errors are<br/>
not the fault of the writer but rather of the newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
AND, if one really wants to find typo and grammar errors, if you have older<br/>
kidlets, cut them loose with a red pen and a newspaper a piece and tell them<br/>
to go for it.  (Tell them as in a challenge to see how many errors they can<br/>
find, not as in a demand that they do something)<br/>

to, too, two/your,you&#39;re/it&#39;s,its/ and other spelling words-both when I&#39;m<br/>
tired and when I&#39;m really engrossed in a subject rather than when I&#39;m<br/>
trying to make an impression, like in a business letter.  Maybe it&#39;s a<br/>
sign that I have to use some part of my conscious mind to differentiate<br/>

Can&#39;t be. I can&#39;t type without looking at the keys, and not very fast. Maybe<br/>
it&#39;s that I&#39;m not looking at the screen? Nope, I notice as I type that I can<br/>
catch mistakes. I think it may be because I learned to write by writing not<br/>
typing. The connection to the pen/pencil may have something to do with it.<br/>
I wonder if our children type more than write, will they experience this<br/>
while using a pen?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545398444">Back when typewriters were the norm and books had to be typeset, after<br/>
proofing large works such as encyclopedias were given to folks who did not<br/>
speak or read English to input because they would do it letter by letter<br/>
instead of seeing a word and then typing the word.  The human brain is<br/>
inclined, particularly with typing, to take short cuts, or so the world&#39;s<br/>

&gt; When I write in long hand, I rarely spell things wrong, flip letters, or<br/>
&gt; leave out apostrophes. But I do it all the time while typing.<br/>
&gt; I wonder why?<br/>

speak and write correctly. The children would learn by example.<br/>
