&lt;&lt; I guess it was easier to learn <br/>
 both together. I don&#39;t know, but he now knows most of his multiplication and <br/>
 division facts. They truly do learn in &quot;their own way.&quot; Good luck with <br/>
 unschooling!<br/>

Yep.  Both together.  All together.  Mult is repeated addition, etc.  It all <br/>
blends.  Then it makes sense.  <br/>
<br/>
Science that uses math concepts we haven&#39;t gotten to yet -- great time to <br/>
learn that new concept.<br/>
<br/>
Cooking -- great time to mult and divide and measure.<br/>
<br/>
Planting rows of tomatoes -- both of the kids had 3 plants of 3 different <br/>
types each -- how big does this garden need to be??  Boy, that&#39;s pretty big.<br/>
<br/>
etc. etc.<br/>
