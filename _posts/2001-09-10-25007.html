<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910802324">&lt;&lt; This is an interesting post.  I agree that there is the possibility of<br/>
doing too much.  I think there is a fine line between allowing your child<br/>
autonomy over his/her education and allowing your child autonomy over<br/>
you.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday you used &quot;autonomy&quot; when you meant &quot;freedom&quot; and today you&#39;ve used <br/>
it when you should have used &quot;control.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner discusses multiple intelligences:<br/>
musical<br/>
linguistic<br/>
logical/mathematical<br/>
spatial<br/>
bodily/kinesthetic<br/>
interpersonal<br/>
intrapersonal<br/>
nature<br/>
<br/>
What happens on this list is we use linguistic and logical (and <br/>
interpersonal, to an extent) to discuss all the others.  It&#39;s like a little <br/>
window into a big world.<br/>
<br/>
If we were playing soccer here, I&#39;d be carrying water and guarding the <br/>
parking lot, because bodily/kinesthetic is very low level for me.  If we were <br/>
doing nature, counting all the raccoons in some park, I&#39;d be in camp making <br/>
lunch for the rest of you.<br/>
<br/>
So some are disadvantaged by the linguistic-intense nature of these exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
A child cannot have &quot;autonomy&quot; over a parent, because autonomy doesn&#39;t extend <br/>
past <br/>
the individual.<br/>
<br/>
If synonyms were equal in all cases, we wouldn&#39;t have all these words in <br/>
English.  Every term has its own particular meaning, limitations and <br/>
connotations.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If unschooling is a way of life, it seems logical that the way a person<br/>
treats other list members would be the same way they treat/interact with<br/>
their children.  So, do you lecture your children if they use a word<br/>
incorrectly?  If so, by your own definition you are not an unschooler.<br/>

does? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nothing falls under that but gratuitous insult.<br/>
<br/>
Learning through exchange of information is what this list is good for.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been interested in language and precision of speech since I was eight or <br/>
nine, that I remember clearly.  I wasn&#39;t a teacher then.    I studied English <br/>
because I loved it.  College didn&#39;t teach me a love of English, and the <br/>
college of education didn&#39;t teach me how to teach.  I learned that by trial <br/>
and error and experience and experiment.  <br/>
<br/>
But this list is a peer-help situation, as so many organizations and clubs <br/>
and temporary informal groups are.  People come here to share about <br/>
unschooling.  If the words that are being used aren&#39;t meaning what the writer <br/>
wants them to mean, then clarification isn&#39;t a sin.  It happens all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I&#39;m glad for your sake you found something to jump on me about, but <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s cold comfort, but it helps people with perspective, I think, when<br/>
reading posts. Here, we are the sum of our posts instead of the sum of our<br/>
parts.<br/>
<br/>
As some of you know, I was in and around the homeschooling area on AOL for<br/>
years, and the dynamic that evolved was very interesting, and educational ;)<br/>
for me, as it seems to happen in life-in-general and definitely<br/>
online-in-general.<br/>
<br/>
The dynamic involves watching the dance of new people coming in, saying what<br/>
they say, and who they then gravitate toward amongst the established posters<br/>
and which established posters gravitate toward them. Part of that is<br/>
watching people align with each other only because they both dislike the<br/>
third guy, not necessarily that they like each other that well. An &quot;enemy of<br/>
mine enemy&quot; sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if I had my druthers, people would argue ideas here and not<br/>
personal vendettas, and the encampment sort of behavior would end. Lynda<br/>
would stop sending posts filled with exclamation points at your head. I am<br/>
completely at a loss on how that can be accomplished.<br/>

<br/>
As to your last sentence, get over yourself, you aren&#39;t that important.  I<br/>
don&#39;t pay any attention to who is posting until I finish reading and then<br/>
decide to post.  I generally don&#39;t post to anything that has your name on it<br/>
or is part of a conversation that you have posted on just so you won&#39;t get<br/>
hysterical or whine that I&#39;m picking on you.<br/>
<br/>
You will, of course, notice that I used no emphasis since I wouldn&#39;t want<br/>
anyone&#39;s imagination to suddenly perceive those horrid exclamation point<br/>
arrows coming at them.  You will also notice that I didn&#39;t use any &lt;g&gt; in<br/>
the message as I didn&#39;t want anyone to get excited and think I was being<br/>
sarcastic, either.<br/>
