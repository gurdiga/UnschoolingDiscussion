<div id="ygrps-yiv-304605143">You could tell her about Matthew (who Pam knows in person, really really<br/>
well), who didn&#39;t read until he was 11, and who for the very first time<br/>
picked up a novel at the library last week (two weeks before his 13th<br/>
birthday) and who finished it in the middle of a vacation at the beach, and<br/>
who then BEGGED to be taken into town to get the first book in the Artimis<br/>
Fowl series.  The stuff she says about math and money, I just find hard to<br/>
believe.  How could you live in this world and not be exposed to our<br/>
monetary system?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480793710">I agree.  Also, how does she voice her concerns. If she does so<br/>
confrontationally, then that might not be so good, and there may be<br/>
stress in the relationship, which puts a huge damper on any real<br/>
communication. If the children sense that stress then they will also be<br/>
less likely to share information that may make the grandmother feel more<br/>
at ease.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also maybe talk to the grandmother about different kinds of<br/>
knowledge, and how life skills such as communication, general<br/>
information, etc. may not be readily apparent, unless the grandmother is<br/>
spending a lot of time with the children.  Lexie would probably also say<br/>
she has no money skills but really, she does very well adding and<br/>
subtracting money.  All it would take is giving her a bit of money to<br/>
spend to discover exactly how much she comprehends.  (She just walked up<br/>
to the computer and complained that the mail downloading  was too<br/>
slow--&quot;it&#39;s only at 45% mom, that&#39;s not even half way!).<br/>

I thought that too.  Poor every-single-one of them.<br/>
<br/>
I think Carol Rice&#39;s article on late reading (www.unschooling.com and click <br/>
&quot;library&quot;) is really good, and I know THOSE kids personally.   The youngest <br/>
three are regulars here (the oldest one&#39;s up and out, fulltime job at REI, <br/>
bicycle trophies to earn...). <br/>
<br/>
When we moved to this new house I drilled the kids on their address once in a <br/>
while.  It would be too embarrassing (and legally risky) if a homeschooler <br/>
got stopped by police for some reason during school hours and didn&#39;t know his <br/>
address.  So I&#39;m kinda with the grandmother on that one.  There are safety <br/>
reasons to know address and phone, with or without school.<br/>
<br/>
Probably Kirby would say he knew no mathematics if he were asked in that <br/>
fashion.  Yesterday in the car with no paper he and I figured how much more a <br/>
week he would be making now with a 35 cent an hour raise and 22 hours of work <br/>
a week, and it had to do with going by 70 instead of 35, since 11 and 70 are <br/>
easier to work with than 35 and 22. <br/>
<br/>
But no panicky grandmother could even make it through a paragraph like that <br/>
without being angry at the end that I just didn&#39;t get out a paper and show <br/>
him how to multiply 35 by 22 and then show him how to figure out what <br/>
percentage of his old rate the new rate is.<br/>

unschooling links if she&#39;s online.  I&#39;d suggest that she read those with an <br/>
open mind and think about whether that might be the style of homeschooling <br/>
that her grandchildren are using.<br/>
It *is* entirely possible that the mother thinks totally leaving the kids <br/>
on their own with no parental facilitation is the way to unschool.  If the <br/>
kids aren&#39;t being exposed to the world in some way, they aren&#39;t going to be <br/>
learning much about it.  If the grandmother learns something about <br/>
unschooling, she could better decide whether there really is a problem.  If <br/>
she isn&#39;t willing to learn about unschooling with an open mind, then it&#39;s <br/>
really a family problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89968460">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Anne...AnneO to those of you who know me from the boards at <br/>
unschooling.com.  <br/>
Just looking for a little unschooling chatting action today as I have <br/>
some time, and the boards are pretty slow...so I meandered over <br/>
here...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Are these children not already functioning in society?  It seems the <br/>
grandmother is asking school-related questions and seeing her <br/>
grandchildren&#39;s education through the school system&#39;s eyes...but if <br/>
her bottom line question is what she asked above,  &quot;How is this child <br/>
ever going to be able to function in society?&quot; then I would point out <br/>
to her that it seems like that&#39;s exactly what they are doing.<br/>
<br/>
***&gt; While they have a very loving household, as far as their <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; education, this borders on child abuse!***  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is really interesting.  Again.  What&#39;s her bottom line?  One end <br/>
of the sentence says they have a very loving household, the next is <br/>
screaming child abuse?  If she looked at this family with through the <br/>
eyes of a loving grandmother, she would see Love and Success and Joy <br/>
(which I am only assuming is true, as we know nothing of this family <br/>
except for what this grandmother tells us).  But she&#39;s choosing to <br/>
see her family through the eyes of a school system, and that really <br/>
rots.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine my mother-in-law seeing my family through the same <br/>
eyes.  When we are around her, we are full of life and Love and <br/>
conversations and questions, and reading and asking and observing and <br/>
Joy.  But she STILL asks, &quot;So...how&#39;s homeschooling going??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They just don&#39;t get it...and I think it&#39;s important to point out that <br/>
living a fulfilling joyful life is the goal of adults...why not the <br/>
goal of children, also?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37711889">In addition to what everyone else has said, how about rather than dwelling<br/>
on what they don&#39;t know, how about finding out what they do know. What do<br/>
they like to do? What kind of activities are they involved with? What types<br/>
of things do they do with their mom during the day?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d point out that despite what schools lead us to believe, the skills she<br/>
mentioned aren&#39;t skills that take 12 years to master. In fact the older<br/>
someone is the faster they pick the skills up, learning in days and weeks<br/>
rather than months and years because they have real life experience to<br/>
relate the formal information to.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only in school when kids are forced to learn things without needing to<br/>
use them in their lives that learning is difficult. And it&#39;s also only in<br/>
school that kids can&#39;t pick up skills later because 1) the teachers have<br/>
moved on and can&#39;t back up, 2) they&#39;re convinced by years of failure that<br/>
they can&#39;t do it or they&#39;re dumb or it&#39;s too hard, and 3) they decide it&#39;s<br/>
dumb and the schools dumb out of self defense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935009330">I do know a family around where I live that has an 8<br/>
year old boy and a 5 year old girl and the parents<br/>
&quot;homeschool&quot;, but I know that the only schooling the<br/>
kids get is from chores such as feeding the dog and<br/>
folding laundry  and the parents don&#39;t incorporate any<br/>
creative teaching methods into it  they just use the<br/>
kids as little slaves.   The mother used to visit us<br/>
all the time when my kids were little  but the last<br/>
time she visited my 3 year old wrote his name on the<br/>
wall  and she was embarrassed because her kids didn&#39;t<br/>
know how to write their names yet so she hasn&#39;t been<br/>
back.   I have often thought of contacting someone<br/>
about the situation (I know what goes on because I<br/>
live next door to this family)  but would the<br/>
consequences be worse than the problem now.  I finally<br/>
just decided it wasn&#39;t my business and since they stay<br/>
away from us  I don&#39;t worry about it anymore<br/>

<br/>
Some people&#39;s parenting pattern involves having clean clothes laid out, going <br/>
to bed early, getting up, dressing, eating, brusing teeth, getting on the <br/>
bus; whatever; snack, homework, dinner, get ready for school tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
If all of &quot;parenting&quot; revolves around school, as it seemingly can for some <br/>
families, then what would they think &quot;good parenting&quot; would look like in the <br/>
absence of school?<br/>
<br/>
No clothes laid out the night before?  No go to bed early?  No homework?  No <br/>
basing privileges on grades?<br/>
<br/>
What is left, in some people&#39;s minds, without school, is:  nothing.</div>

(JUST JOKING.)<br/>
<br/>
I kinda fear the Dodd jokes because I kinda fear crazy people and I&#39;m afraid <br/>
they&#39;ll trigger someone&#39;s...  well....  craziness.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if they&#39;re already ready to jump all over me for something <br/>
that exists mostly in their own heads...  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I ought to go take a whole long shower and think lovely thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Each of my kids has been very nice to me today in one way or another.  It&#39;s <br/>
been good.  Holly also had a kind of screaming melt-down and I yelled at her <br/>
that if she hadn&#39;t fallen and she wasn&#39;t bleeding to stop screaming, to get <br/>
out, and I&#39;d be down there with her food SOON, but that I had been doing <br/>
something fun with Kirby and Marty and she wasn&#39;t the only kid I had.<br/>
<br/>
But other than THAT embarrassing bit of candor it was a good day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076904696">I just had a couple of things to add regarding this grandmother&#39;s letter...<br/>
<br/>
First, doesn&#39;t it sound like she&#39;s been &quot;quizzing&quot; the kids when mom&#39;s not <br/>
around?  Does anyone else have that problem?  My mother is NOT supportive of <br/>
homeschooling.  One of the first things I told her after we made our decision <br/>
was that we would not tolerate having the kids quizzed.  To my mind, it seems <br/>
like a sneaky thing to do.  I think it also demonstrates to the kids that <br/>
grandma doesn&#39;t trust mom & dad&#39;s judgment.  I know my kids would definitely <br/>
pick up on that.  It seems to me that if grandma spent her time with the kids <br/>
just enjoying them and helping to show them what life is all about (after <br/>
all, she does have a unique perspective since she&#39;s older than mom and dad), <br/>
she&#39;d see how bright and happy they are, and wouldn&#39;t feel the need to test <br/>
their knowledge.  Also, if Grandma IS quizzing them, maybe they just don&#39;t <br/>
want to answer her questions.  Perhaps they sense the tension, and would <br/>
rather talk about something else.  <br/>
<br/>
I do think, in today&#39;s very busy world, that I&#39;d feel more comfortable if the <br/>
kids all knew their address and phone number.  And maybe the girl does know <br/>
them.  After all, grandma isn&#39;t around her 24/7.  Just because she hasn&#39;t <br/>
heard the girl demonstrate the knowledge doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not there.<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to the non-supportive grandmother thing, but if my mother wrote <br/>
someone a letter like that about my family, I&#39;d be very, very angry.  I hope <br/>
this family can get it all worked out.  : (<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738069601">Pam,  <br/>
I don&#39;t know how a grandmother could really understand what these kids<br/>
know. <br/>
She says they have a loving household and it just doesn&#39;t make sense that<br/>
in a loving house hold these kids would be neglected.   <br/>
So, the only thing I can think is that she doesn&#39;t understand about, or<br/>
more likely doesn&#39;t want to understand, natural learning.  <br/>
I&#39;m guessing she has a picture of learning in her mind that is school or<br/>
school at home and since she hasn&#39;t seen &quot;school&quot;  she isn&#39;t seeing<br/>
learning.<br/>
  <br/>
A friend recently commented on an unschooling friend&#39;s child who isn&#39;t<br/>
reading yet, at ten.  I asked her to tell me all the reasons a child of<br/>
ten needed to read.  For pleasure?   Parents can read to kids.  For<br/>
safety?  A child of ten can&#39;t legally be left alone in her state therefor<br/>
not being able to read &quot;Drano&quot; vs &quot;Milk&quot; is a silly argument, unless the<br/>
child is a toddler.  Not to mention non reading children have astounding<br/>
memories and function at their own homes with ease.  For what then?  <br/>
Kids are made to read early in school for the convenience of teachers,<br/>
not for the benefit of the children.  They have to be able to send home<br/>
those worksheets so everyone can see the learning.  <br/>
<br/>
About the address and &#39;phone number.   I think everyone agrees for safety<br/>
reasons kids need to know these, but young unschoolers are always with a<br/>
parent.  At these ages, they probably can&#39;t even be at the public pool<br/>
without a parent, so from the parent&#39;s perspective, short of abduction,<br/>
these kids won&#39;t be in a situation where they need to find their way home<br/>
by themselves.   And let&#39;s face it, how many abducted kids get the chance<br/>
to &#39;phone home?  Knowing address and &#39;phone number can&#39;t keep kids safe<br/>
from bad guys.  Good guys would look it up for a kid.  This is one more<br/>
thing someone else says is important, and we all jump on.  When our kids<br/>
are out by themselves, then yes, it&#39;s good to know, but at young ages,<br/>
when they&#39;re always with a parent?   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe these kids would know nothing about money.  But, if it&#39;s<br/>
true, so what?  Are they working yet?  Paying taxes?  Grocery shopping<br/>
for the entire family on their own?   What are the real reasons kids need<br/>
to know about money, before they&#39;re on their own?  Mostly for the<br/>
convenience of parents.  In a few years these kids will know more about<br/>
money than Granny.  <br/>
<br/>
My son didn&#39;t learn to walk until he was about fifteen months old.  He<br/>
was always in my arms.  But when he wanted down, he learned to walk just<br/>
fine.  If it&#39;s true and these kids don&#39;t know address or money, then I&#39;d<br/>
say it&#39;s because they have attentive parents, and don&#39;t yet have the need<br/>
to know.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what you can tell this grandmother.  When people have only<br/>
one idea of what learning is, how do you give them another in one brief<br/>
letter?   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, no help at all, sorry.</div>

Kids know drano from milk.  And for totally pre-verbal kids, you lock Drano <br/>
up, not teach kids to read the label.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;About the address and &#39;phone number.   I think everyone agrees for safety<br/>

parent.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids have given some daffy answers to people who ask them about <br/>
homeschooling.  Some of the things they have said, if quoted back, would <br/>
sound like they&#39;ve admitted not learning anything, or never being taught <br/>
anything.    If the grandmother asked &quot;Has your mom had you memorize your <br/>
address?&quot;  or &quot;Has your mom taught you your address?&quot;  the kid might answer <br/>
&quot;no&quot; even if he knows the address perfectly well.  Because maybe he doesn&#39;t <br/>
know the concept &quot;memorize&quot; (which is a very schoolish term indeed, and kind <br/>
of a stupid word if you look at it objectively) and maybe his mom did not <br/>
teach him his address, but he sees it on the house every day and knows what <br/>
street he lives on and so he just KNOWS his address.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Knowing address and &#39;phone number can&#39;t keep kids safe<br/>
from bad guys.  Good guys would look it up for a kid.  This is one more<br/>

<br/>
My paranoid scenario for kids not knowing their address was that when we <br/>
moved my boys were eight and eleven.  We don&#39;t register.  If they were out in <br/>
the daytime going to Hollywood Video or the grocery store, which were a block <br/>
and three  outside our back gate without crossing major streets, and if a <br/>
policeman asked where they lived and they didn&#39;t know, it would not be a good <br/>
first impression for them being brought home during school hours.<br/>

<br/>
I am quite new to the concept of unschooling. I think I am getting it <br/>
but I still have some insecurities at times. Most of the time I am <br/>
just amazed by their interests and how intense they are when they <br/>
discover something. They were in the public school system until this <br/>
year. (Daughter - 12, son - 9, son - almost 8, and one who never <br/>
experienced school daughter - 3.)<br/>
<br/>
We began with school at home. What a disaster. Then we began to <br/>
relax, and take a more eclectic approach. Now I am learning to &quot;Trust <br/>
the Children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy everyone&#39;s posts. <br/>

I&#39;ve heard the &quot;perfect&quot; idea before -- either expressed kindly and honestly<br/>
like Kathy did above, with concern that she wasn&#39;t going to &quot;measure up&quot; --<br/>
but also with mega snarkiness (&quot;Well, YOU may be a perfect parent with<br/>
perfect kids who never needs to spank, but I&#39;m NOT!&quot; -- the fact that I nod<br/>
agreeably to this never seems to calm them down for some reason &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Nobody&#39;s perfect. Not even me. &lt;eg&gt; I think what maybe separates a lot of<br/>
unschoolers is that when perfection is lacking, we don&#39;t automatically start<br/>
blaming the kids for our short tempers, or failings (as we all have) as<br/>
parents. Sometimes, my children&#39;s behavior is rude and inconsiderate. But<br/>
sometimes, mine is. Being willing to admit that, to work through it and try<br/>
to do better, may be as close to perfection as any of us can hope for.<br/>

time? Did she store it safely or get rid of it after<br/>
that? <br/>
<br/>
Workshops, studios (paints, glues, cutters of various<br/>
sorts, etc),  and garages, and farm stuff are<br/>
dangerous, too.Sewing machines...Little Sister sewed<br/>
her hand in Mother&#39;s machine ( a horror movie, surreal<br/>
looking mess) I kept mine unplugged with no needle,<br/>
and the treadle machine with the belt off and the<br/>
machine closed up.  Seems like I just had to hover<br/>
within a few feet of my boys until they were 4 or 5,<br/>
then they still had to be where I could hear them and<br/>
be able to tell what their tone of voice or the<br/>
activity noises signified. <br/>
<br/>
That ammonia gives me the shudders. Have you forgiven<br/>
the children&#39;s grandmother? <br/>
<br/>
I still have to monitor Roy and his &quot;chemistry&quot;<br/>
concoctions....some of his ideas are potentially very<br/>
dangerous. He is just skillful enough to make<br/>
dangerous construction projects too. Exposed nails<br/>
sticking out, rickety structures, dagger-like<br/>
splinters...he&#39;s pretty good, but sometimes the<br/>
overall idea eclipses some of the (to him) details.<br/>

<br/>

&gt; the daytime going to Hollywood Video or the grocery store, which <br/>
&gt; were a block <br/>
&gt; and three  outside our back gate without crossing major streets, and <br/>
&gt; if a <br/>
&gt; policeman asked where they lived and they didn&#39;t know, it would not <br/>
&gt; be a good <br/>
&gt; first impression for them being brought home during school hours.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s paranoid, I think that&#39;s a good reason to know your<br/>
address and &#39;phone number, but not every kid will have a good reason at<br/>
eight and eleven.   Dylan knew his early too because we live in a small<br/>
town, but if we lived in a city, where it wasn&#39;t safe to go out alone at<br/>
ten years old  I don&#39;t know that it would have come up, that he should<br/>
have it memorized.  <br/>
<br/>
I really can&#39;t imagine that the eleven year old doesn&#39;t know at least a<br/>
phone number, because she&#39;s probably stayed with friends and needed to<br/>
call home, or wanted to give a friend her number.  So maybe grandma<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to ask the question, but if the eleven year old never<br/>
needed to call home, didn&#39;t ever use it, she might not remember it, even<br/>
if she knew it once.  I sometimes forget my own number for a moment.  <br/>
And if grandma asked in the middle of a movie or a video game maybe &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t know&quot; was a shorter answer than 125 North Belmont, or what ever,<br/>
and grandma should have known better.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little irritated with grandmothers today.  Can you tell? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

is when arranging UPS or FedEx deliveries. The street we live on is a<br/>
dirt road that has three houses on it, and it&#39;s totally surrounded by<br/>
fields for at least a mile in every direction. The actual street sign<br/>
disappeared about a year ago and it hasn&#39;t been replaced, and no one<br/>
really cares - if you have a reason to come here, you know people living<br/>
here and they give you directions (Meghan found it just fine).  The post<br/>
office doesn&#39;t deliver out here, we have a box, and I guess Rain knows<br/>
that address - Box 15 in Dunnigan, if anyone wants to send presents ;-)<br/>
<br/>
She knows our her email address, though... And if she needed to tell<br/>
anyone in authority where she lived, I think she could be clear enough...<br/>
in a rural area like this, the rules are a little different. She knows<br/>
how to get here.<br/>

hearing us repeat it to everyone.  I always say &quot;6145<br/>
Linck L-I-N-C-K Circle&quot;, because it&#39;s spelled weird,<br/>
and that is how she says it, too....not because we<br/>
taught her or because she&#39;s written it down.  She&#39;s<br/>
never been away from us anywhere that she needed to<br/>
use the phone # to call home, and I don&#39;t think she&#39;s<br/>
ever dialed it, but she knows it, just from hearing<br/>
us.  (I just asked her, to be sure, and she looked at<br/>
me funny and asked me why, and I told her my list was<br/>
having a conversation about whether or not kids knew<br/>
their #&#39;s, and so she told me and then went back to<br/>
her cartoon--she&#39;s thinks I&#39;m looney, though!:)  On<br/>
that same note, I still remember my dad&#39;s car phone #<br/>
when I was a kid...even though I never called it.  You<br/>
couldn&#39;t dial direct, so you had to ask for a mobile<br/>
operator and tell him/her the number, so I heard my<br/>
mother repeating it.  She never did have it memorized,<br/>
and can&#39;t believe I still know it--JR38007128 ;)<br/>

<br/>
I grew up in a house without an address.   The directions to my house, <br/>
though, I did know.  It was &quot;8/10 of a mile down Lower San Pedro Road, next <br/>
to the second dirt road, by the Sanchez&#39;s.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, that worked perfectly.  There were no dirt roads to the right, <br/>
because the Rio Grande was past the back fields of everyone on the west side <br/>
of the road, so &quot;by the dirt road&quot; indicated that we were on the left/east <br/>
side.  And there were only two dirt roads connecting upper and lower San <br/>
Pedro, both of which were a mile long.  So 8/10 of a mile meant it was NOT <br/>
&quot;Middle San Pedro&quot; (which was a dirt road wide enough for two cars) but was <br/>
the second dirt road (a one-lane).<br/>
<br/>
But I knew my phone number always. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
