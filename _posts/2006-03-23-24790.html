<div id="ygrps-yiv-651454175">Susan  l loved your artilce on quitting!  I&#39;m a quitter to nice to  <br/>
meet you.  For me it&#39;s not that I quit, you know I&#39;m out of here.   <br/>
For me I need to explore other options, I am always exploring.  My  <br/>
list of what I have taught myself came after quitting violin, guitar,  <br/>
clarinet, track, swimming, girl scouts.  I taught myself, gardening,  <br/>
quilting, sewing, crafting, pottery, cooking, knitting, theory on  <br/>
homeschool education to some degree, drywalling, paintng,  <br/>
construction framing, tiling, how to install a sink, a toliet, a  <br/>
phone line, how to sand floors and stain them and I am always  <br/>
teaching myself to be true to myself.  Yes, sometimes I go years  <br/>
without making pottery, or quilting, but I always come back when the  <br/>
hunger is there, and I always allow myself to.  What a great feeling.<br/>
