&gt; I realize that some of you will answer that its not an issue at your home.  But it *is* an issue here at the present moment and I could use some ideas.<br/>

<br/>
To answer more seriously I think I would look at why *I* found something objectionable and why i didn&#39;t trust my child there. Are you worried that your child will take drugs or drink? Wont be able to stand up to peer pressure?<br/>
Maybe talking it through with your child would be a good thing. Personally I think most kids will try  a bit of drink or smoke a little dope whether their parents approve or not. To me its part of growing up. I would give them taxi money<br/>
or offer to fetch them if that was going to be the case.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d ask them why they wanted to go, what they expected it to be like,<br/>
what they expected to get out of it, etc.  Maybe they want to go because<br/>
their friends are going, maybe they want to see the friends only (and<br/>
could then do it another time), maybe they want to have a shared<br/>
experience with their friends.  Who knows except them?  I&#39;d be sure to<br/>
let them know that if they were in a situation that they weren&#39;t<br/>
comfortable in that they could ALWAYS leave and call me with no<br/>
questions asked unless they wanted me to ask them.  (That is a hard<br/>
one.)  Perhaps a compromise of you going, too, but keeping out of sight<br/>
(or staying in the parking lot) would work, too.<br/>

&gt; I believe probably what you&#39;re thinking of as a skin-head rally in England<br/>
&gt; and what it would be considered in the U.S. are two way different things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you want to a drunken pot party early-rave of punks, that&#39;s okay.<br/>

&gt; Here, you&#39;d be going to a neo-Nazi white-power thing and be given Ku Klux<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ah. Yeah, wouldn&#39;t enjoy that at all.<br/>
The KKK still going? I thought that was a 30&#39;s thing?<br/>
