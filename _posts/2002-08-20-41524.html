&gt;&gt; What is the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned wonders: <br/>
<br/>
To me, unschooling is &quot;radical&quot; homeschooling -- true parenting and full<br/>
responsibility for our children. I&#39;m not sure we need yet another term to<br/>
define when we&#39;re having problems with the meaning of the ones we&#39;ve got.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Radical&quot; means root  (radish)  and thus it refers to the fundamental, the<br/>
basic part of something. Many people see the word, radical, and assume that<br/>
there is a devious anti-social context to it.  &quot;Unschooling&quot; is a<br/>
self-defining term that says, &quot;we don&#39;t do what schools do. Why not leave it<br/>
at that?<br/>

I was interested in word origins as a teen, and I remember finding this<br/>
one (rad-) to be about the most delightful one ever.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of funny, though, that &quot;radical&quot; and &quot;fundamental&quot; are so close in<br/>
original meaning but so different these days in connotation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because Radical Unschooling is already out there. I&#39;ve been seeing it ever<br/>
since I started reading message boards 8 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever actually used it, not really seeing a &quot;them&quot; to<br/>
separate myself from. Though I have seen people comfortably part way to<br/>
unschooling use it to refer to those who are firmly committed to<br/>
unschooling. Not really the best use since it implies stretching the word<br/>
unschooling to encompass almost unschooling. :-/<br/>
