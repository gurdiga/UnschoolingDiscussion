<div id="ygrps-yiv-248042238">Following a couple of side conversations, I thought it might be helpful for <br/>
us to brainstorm some ideas for helping parents be cheery when it&#39;s winter (NZ <br/>
and Australia, you can cast your minds back six months and help us out!!) and <br/>
the kids are little and there news is sad and frustrating and grapes are <br/>
expensive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of my best is cheery music, cheery movies.<br/>
<br/>
I make it a habit to avoid watching TV news, and I don&#39;t get the newspaper.   <br/>
I prefer magazine analysis or online BBC if I really want to read up on <br/>
something that happened last week.  I don&#39;t want the wild crazy speculation and <br/>
fright of what someone thinks is happening right now.   My adrenaline shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be jerked around by things thousands of miles away.  My kids need me whole and <br/>
calm HERE.<br/>
<br/>
Food is good.  If I&#39;m hungry I get cranky or I rush people along.   Have <br/>
snacks.<br/>
<br/>
More ideas?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140411953">Good idea, Sandra.  We&#39;re in western NY with 1/16th inch of ice on the <br/>
insides of our windows.  It&#39;s bitterly cold and the girls, all under 7, <br/>
are really picking at each other bad.  Normally, I&#39;d have them strip <br/>
down and play in the shower or something like that, but it&#39;s too darn <br/>
cold.  We&#39;ve been baking lots of cookies, etc which is okay as long as <br/>
everyone gets to crack an egg.  We watch lots of movies and tv and we go <br/>
to bed early.  I get cranky and pushy when I&#39;m tired.  And we&#39;ve been <br/>
living 24/7 in our pjs cause it&#39;s comfy and the pipes to the washing <br/>
machine are frozen.  Alas, I can&#39;t do laundry ;).  If all this keeps up, <br/>
it&#39;s going to be a long winter.  I would love some fun, new and cheap ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104233065">The smell of food -- whether connected to food or not. Bake cookies or just boil some water on the stovetop with spices (cinnamon, vanilla, whatever) added. .  Bake breadsticks -- or bread, but breadsticks are faster and easier (imo). <br/>
<br/>
 Spritz the house lightly with lemon-essential-oil in water when you dust.<br/>
<br/>
For the mulled wine I just made for our twelfth night party, I started with oranges studded with cloves and baked in a medium oven -- it made the house smell fantastic.   I think I will do it sometime just to make the house smell good (although mulled wine is also often nice in the winter, lol). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195775247">I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people who have fireplaces don&#39;t actually use<br/>
them.  We have a fire every day, and it really changes the atmosphere of<br/>
our house - plus we can have toasted marshmallows and s&#39;mores at a<br/>
moment&#39;s notice :0).  <br/>
 <br/>
I second the no tv news and snack ideas.  Just going to a different<br/>
grocery store and trying some food I&#39;ve never seen before brings<br/>
something new into the house when I&#39;m feeling the winter blahs.  We<br/>
watch a lot of movies in the winter, which is good because we get to see<br/>
new things, but also good because we get to snuggle up together, which<br/>
always makes me feel calm and good.<br/>
 <br/>
I like to reorganize our stuff in the winter too.  Moving things around<br/>
makes the house different, and we often find things we had forgotten and<br/>
play with them like they&#39;re new.  <br/>
 <br/>
When the kids were littler I&#39;d stock up on new bath toys - shaving<br/>
cream, paint, crayons, etc. - so they could take warm baths and I could<br/>
sit in the room with them and hear them giggling, and maybe catch a few<br/>
minutes of reading.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267854787">Send everyone away for a couple of hours. Fill a tub with hot water, washing <br/>
hair in tub while it is filling up. Add some Skin So Soft oil to the bath. Put <br/>
hair up, get into the tub and relax. Prior to doing this, I like to put my <br/>
Misty Celtic Morning CD in the player. It has the flute and nature sounds, and <br/>
is very relaxing. I also like to light candles in the bathroom and turn out the <br/>
lights. I soak. I dry off, wrapped in towel I head for my bedroom, where the <br/>
bed was already made. I moisturize my feet and hands, and give myself a <br/>
manicure and pedicure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566504207">**some ideas for helping parents be cheery when it&#39;s winter...**<br/>
<br/>
I discussed with my husband setting our clock radio to go off at 6:05 <br/>
instead of 6:00am, because the newest deaths in Iraq are announced every <br/>
morning just after 6.  (I&#39;m already outraged and sad and politically <br/>
mobilized, I&#39;m not willing to begin many days each week grieving again <br/>
and again.)<br/>
<br/>
**One of my best is cheery music, cheery movies.<br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
Maybe people could recommend some video comedies?  My son loves anything <br/>
humorous, but when I stand at the video store and look at the boxes, <br/>
they tend not to look amusing.<br/>
<br/>
We all liked Bruce Almighty, even though reviewers weren&#39;t super <br/>
enthusiastic.<br/>
<br/>
**More ideas?**<br/>
<br/>
Invite people over, as much as you can.<br/>
<br/>
**I like to reorganize our stuff in the winter too. **<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not cold enough to snow here, so our garage isn&#39;t super cold.  The <br/>
third rainy day in a row is good day to rummage and reorganize in the <br/>
garage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-440939703">Wow I can sympathize with the original poster. We had soooooo many days like this years ago. I am the curl up and read or sleep  and veg kind of person in the really cold weather- my kids-g&#39;kid, ggk&#39;ds never were/are. Videos/going out was never really an option most of those times-wood fires to  keep going-no vehicle-animals to take care of/milk/small children-long way to town.<br/>
What I absolutely had to do , I found was to turn on and keep on all possible lights-music on-radio. indoor games  that had the kids laughing and running around.they just had to have the physical exercise to make up for not going out -even too much  reading stories made it worse. I was ready to sleep but they werent. sometimes we had to move everyone to one main room as we couldnt keep the whole house warm. Now we are able to heat more rooms and on weekends at least we can import a few friends. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537913611">Watching old cartoons with the kids is always a good way to break a cranky mood.  We get Cartoon Network, so we can watch Tom&Jerry or LooneyTunes, with Bugs Bunny or Coyote & Roadrunner.  We also enjoy watching Duck Dodger in the 24th and a half Century (daffy duck as buck rogers!).<br/>
 <br/>
A bath always works around here, too.... Jello is one snack my kids always love...and happy kids makes it much easier for me to find a good mood!  Hot cocoa and cinnamon toast is a yummy treat! Dan loves maraschino cherries -- they are really cheap and fun, he feels very special with a bowl of several cherries with stems.<br/>
 <br/>
video ideas.... Princess Bride.... A Fish Called Wanda is one we adults loved..... some years ago I saw a video of Blind Date, starring Bruce Willis & Kim Basinger -- a really funny movie along the lines of the most disastrous blind date one could ever have.  <br/>
 <br/>
Play-doh is fun, too, and somehow very therapeutic for me.  Just mashing and squeezing the play-doh, mixing colors. The kids cut out cookies other snacks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104018190">We like to roast marshmallows over the gas stove flame too. Getting out<br/>
in the sun every chance I get helps me. We have a bigger house now so the<br/>
boys have more room to run around. They had sleepover guest this weekend and<br/>
had a great time playing hide and seek in the house.<br/>
<br/>
    The Incredible Mr. Limpet is the movie you are trying to think of Laura.<br/>
We&#39;re going to do a Neverending Story marathon this week. It&#39;s not a comedy<br/>
but we all like it.<br/>
<br/>
    When the boys were babies just getting out of the house to walk around<br/>
the block helped or out on the porch swing. Sometimes I&#39;d keep going around<br/>
and around. Having friends over or visited their house was a change of pace<br/>
and got me out. I&#39;m a talker so it cheered me up.<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;m planning my new flower gardens and such. Looking through books and<br/>
finding things that I think may work out or I can build from. I don&#39;t know<br/>
much about what is local but it&#39;s been fun planning. I wish I&#39;d gotten the<br/>
bulbs I have in the ground right after we moved but I was kidding myself.<br/>
<br/>
    The bird feeders have been fun to watch. Less activity now but there are<br/>
still a few birds around. Bird feeders are new to us too. I have binoculars<br/>
out so we can see them up close<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;ll be working seasonal again the beginning of feb for two weeks. That<br/>
really changes things around here. I&#39;ve always said Feb is the _longest_<br/>
month. I doubt I say that this year. LOL!<br/>

  &gt; We do this with bread dough too.  Just make a batch of bread dough, let<br/>
everyone have a piece to play with, then bake when they are done playing.<br/>
The shapes don&#39;t seem to matter - lumps, ropes, cookie cutter shapes - they<br/>
all taste good!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hats are fun too, I love making balloon hats. One night I sat and watched TV <br/>
and made a car full and took them to my MIL&#39;s birthday party the next night, <br/>
it was mostly adults who came and they just loved them. I noticed everyone who <br/>
left had made sure they took theirs home with them. There are several good <br/>
balloon books and videos out. We love the Captain Visual book, it as a motorcycle <br/>
my son loves to make. I think balloon stuff is a real mood lifter, the hats <br/>
crack me up and wearing them places is a real hoot.<br/>
