<div id="ygrps-yiv-383526058"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;I have had no luck <br/>
&gt; with bunnies {cotton tail} and really don&#39;t want to try them any <br/>
&gt; more. :-(   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not quite 20 years ago, we lived in a development with a large grassy area.  <br/>
One day the maintenance man ran over a nest of bunnies while cutting the <br/>
grass.  My neighbor grabbed the survivors and put them in a birdcage, but gave them <br/>
to me when it became obvious that she was allergic to them.  They all <br/>
survived, but were WILD.  They were very frightened, and would bang against the <br/>
(newer, bigger) cage to get away from anyone who walked by.  We raised them until <br/>
they were old enough to survive on their own.  My husband called a ranger at a <br/>
local state park, who was happy to add new blood to the park&#39;s rabbit <br/>
population.  So we dropped them off there.<br/>
  We missed them, which led us to about ten years of raising domestic <br/>
rabbits.<br/>
<br/>
from another letter:<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt; Today, we watched a <br/>
family of morning doves feeding.  There were four babies and they kept <br/>
falling off the feeding perch.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Last year a couple of doves built a nest on our porch, on a shelf.  They <br/>
raised two chicks, then another two.  This year (I assume it was the same <br/>
couple) they built a new nest.  (My husband threw away the old one right before <br/>
winter.)  Although it was officially Spring, it was COLD, and we found two dead <br/>
baby birds in the nest, abandoned.  A few weeks later mom was back on the nest, <br/>
but no babies (I don&#39;t know what happened this time.)  I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll <br/>
be back.<br/>
