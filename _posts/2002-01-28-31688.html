<div id="ygrps-yiv-530322747">Processing all the information about what is unschooling and what flavour <br/>
a list should hold and other such ideas that have come to pass I have <br/>
come to realize that its *sometimes* into a have and have-not situation.<br/>
<br/>
When someone who has been unschooling for a long time says &#39;you&#39;re not an <br/>
unschooler because you use this or that control&#39;, its highly possible <br/>
their observation is correct.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I stop and think about the ones that aren&#39;t so lucky. The ones that <br/>
don&#39;t have internal support, or even have internal &#39;abuse&#39;. Should they <br/>
now not be able to unschool because they can&#39;t fit their life into all <br/>
the requirements?<br/>
<br/>
I see some great posts from people and then I hear about their lifestyle <br/>
and realize why it might be easier for them to institute the actions in a <br/>
purely unschooling way.<br/>
<br/>
But what about the ones that made some wrong choices in the past, and now <br/>
want to unschool. Shouldn&#39;t they be able to come here and say &#39;I&#39;m <br/>
unschooling as most as I can&#39; without being challanged as to there is no <br/>

issues we are working through at our house.  Bedtime and chores being <br/>
consistently a challenge for me.  That, to me, falls under the realm <br/>

worthy as a learning tool, or interests more or less worthy.<br/>
Bedtimes and chores are about controlling my own sanity!  These <br/>

over the last 5 years.  But, it&#39;s been a slow process.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who would say that they can&#39;t unschool?  Seems to me people have said <br/>
someone like that is not *yet* unschooling, or on the way toward <br/>
unschooling.  Even if they&#39;re told they aren&#39;t unschooling, it doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they never can.  They&#39;re still doing a wonderful thing for their kids, and <br/>
there&#39;s always time to move in one direction or the other as they get their <br/>
bearings.<br/>
<br/>
While I still don&#39;t believe that unschooling &quot;doesn&#39;t work&quot; for some kids, <br/>
I can easily see where it wouldn&#39;t work for some families.  If the parents <br/>
are up tight about their kids getting &quot;behind&quot; and aren&#39;t able to overcome <br/>
that, or if they just can&#39;t stand the sight of their kids appearing to be <br/>
doing nothing, it isn&#39;t going to work.  But it&#39;s the parents it isn&#39;t <br/>
working for, not the kids.<br/>

there.  That person knows that they haven&#39;t got it yet.  It&#39;s something <br/>
else again to say, &quot;I&#39;m unschooling, even though I use a math program and <br/>
require some reading and writing every day.&quot;  Those people get challenged, <br/>
and I think they should be.  I don&#39;t have a problem with anyone wanting to <br/>
homeschool that way.  I&#39;ve even done it myself for a time.  But I wasn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling when I did it that way, and neither are they.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927138715">One of the problems with self-declared experts or those who must have<br/>
someone they can declare an expert is that inorder to keep the title, the<br/>
parameters of their expertise must be sharply defined.<br/>
<br/>
In an area such as unschooling, quite frankly it is ridiculous to then apply<br/>
such a sharp and rigid definition without having a flexibility or gray area<br/>
to border it.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t come instantly to unschooling.  It isn&#39;t something you buy in a<br/>
pouch that you tear open, pour in water and voila you have an unschooler.<br/>
MOST people come to it by degrees, some take baby steps and sometimes 2<br/>
steps forward and one step backward.  Some never make the transition to 100%<br/>
unschooler.  And some completely fall off the whole homeschooling wagon.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I find all this paranoid protection of a term to be just a little<br/>
bit over the edge.  If the term disappears tomorrow, who cares?  If the term<br/>
gets &quot;watered down,&quot; so what.  It won&#39;t change what I am doing nor will it<br/>
stop me from doing it or change how I am doing &quot;it.&quot;  And it sure won&#39;t stop<br/>
me from encouraging others to, if nothing else, take that first step towards<br/>
freeing their children from the whole pigeon-holing mentality of the public<br/>
school system!<br/>
<br/>
What I know for sure is that even getting part way there makes for a better<br/>
life for children!  So keep those baby steps going!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s my ponderings for the day--if this is all about child-led, why is<br/>
a name so important when 99.9% of the children this is suppose to be all<br/>
about couldn&#39;t give a dead rat&#39;s patooty what you call it or who toes the<br/>
line for the unschooling police?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How do you work towards something(taking baby steps, or leaping in <br/>
bounds), if there is no &quot;ideal&quot; you are working towards?<br/>
Some people here are obviously living a life very close to an ideal <br/>
that many can see vividly, and are trying to reach at whatever pace <br/>
is suiting their needs.<br/>
So that ideal has been given a name.  I don&#39;t see a problem with that.<br/>
Obviously some do.  Maybe those people are happy with where they are <br/>
and don&#39;t &quot;see&quot; an ideal. <br/>
I agree that those taking &quot;baby steps&quot; are doing MUCH better for <br/>
their children, than those locked into the ideas our society feeds us <br/>
about education.  But that doesn&#39;t mean they shouldn&#39;t keep striving <br/>
to do better.  And those who are doing better are a wonderful <br/>
resource. <br/>
I don&#39;t see anyone as an expert.  I do see people who have a <br/>
brilliant philosophy, sharing their thoughts.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If the term disappears tomorrow, who cares?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I care. And I can give you reasons why I care. The reasons aren&#39;t intended<br/>
to convince anyone that I&#39;m right and someone else is wrong. The reasons are<br/>
an explanation of why I do what I do. Everyone has their own reasons for<br/>
doing what they do and feeling what they feel. I think we&#39;re each entitled<br/>
to act as we feel is best to achieve the goals *we* feel are important. One<br/>
of my goals is to help keep the definition of unschooling clear because it&#39;s<br/>
important *to me*. (Another is to help newbies who are in a quandry to see<br/>
the illusory barriers in their thinking set up by society that keeps them<br/>
from seeing the true nature of the problems they&#39;re facing.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If the term gets &quot;watered down,&quot; so what.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*My* reasons for caring whether it gets watered down or not is that for<br/>
those *who do* want to let go entirely, there needs to be a clear goal to<br/>
reach.<br/>
<br/>
Unless there are people -- and I don&#39;t mean everyone needs to do this -- but<br/>
people who do speak up and say &quot;*This* is unschooling&quot; and people who<br/>
believe with all their hearts that &quot;*This* place has benefits that that<br/>
place doesn&#39;t have&quot; and speak their minds on it, then many people who could<br/>
have gone farther had they only known will stop at their comfort level<br/>
believing there are no greater benefits.<br/>
<br/>
It *seems* like just living unschooling and showing people unschooling will<br/>
let them understand unschooling without defining it. After all a child<br/>
unschools exactly like that. He follows the path that leads to *his* goal.<br/>
He isn&#39;t seeking out a path that leads to someone&#39;s definition of &quot;Jimmy&#39;s<br/>
goal in life&quot;. He&#39;s setting his own goal and taking his own path.<br/>
<br/>
But, though that may be the *method* of unschooling, the *philosophy* of<br/>
unschooling *isn&#39;t* whatever goal that a family decides suits their family<br/>
best. It *is* a very definite definible goal and helping people reach *that<br/>
particular* goal is different than helping them reach whatever goal they<br/>
feel comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
But just because I want to keep the definition of unschooling clear<br/>
*doesn&#39;t* mean I advocate jumping all over newbies who are unclear on the<br/>
concept and try to brow beat them into accepting my definition.<br/>
<br/>
*How* somenoe handles statements they disagree with is an entirely separate<br/>
issue from *why* they do so. They may seem connected, but they *are*<br/>
separate.<br/>
