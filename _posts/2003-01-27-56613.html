I think in general that phrases we would consider &quot;rude&quot; in America <br/>
are used more in the UK, but with a more tongue-in-cheekiness. I know <br/>
British people who, for instance, would think nothing of calling a <br/>
girlfriend a &quot;stupid cow&quot; to her face, whereas that would more or <br/>
less be grounds for divorce or end of friendship here :-). British <br/>
humor and sarcasm often goes right over American heads. But <br/>
yes, &quot;shut up&quot; is generally thought of to be quite a rude thing to <br/>
say here.<br/>

Truth is that Liam had been indoctrinated to all those words by an older <br/>
friend of his when he was much younger.  I had to then explain to him that <br/>
although there&#39;s really no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; word, there are words that <br/>
you might say in the company of someone else&#39;s mother that will cause you <br/>
not to be invited over to play anymore and you can end up losing a <br/>
friend.  I also cautioned him that sometimes using words off the above list <br/>
to express anger can become a habit (as is often demonstrated for us by <br/>
Liam&#39;s dad) that&#39;s hard to break, and words can leak out of our mouths <br/>
before we&#39;ve had a chance to turn them into something else.<br/>
<br/>
Watching the movie &quot;The Christmas Story&quot; this past year was very helpful in <br/>
illustrating these points.<br/>
<br/>
Liam really got it and does not use &quot;shut up,&quot;  but you&#39;d blush to hear the <br/>
insults he comes up with when he&#39;s playing a particularly challenging <br/>
Nintendo game.  One of the unmentioned benefits of video games!<br/>

<br/>
Butt is a bad word, too??  I&#39;m new to the list.  I have been reading <br/>
for awhile.  Have learned a lot, to say the least.  I&#39;ve used &quot;butt&quot; <br/>
my whole life and no one has ever said anything about it.  My little <br/>
kids use it.  I have been in homes where you can&#39;t say, &quot;I have to <br/>
pee&quot;, either, because it just makes their skin crawl.  I think you <br/>
are supposed to say &quot;I need to use the lavatory&quot; or something.  But <br/>
who ever says that?  And often there is no bath in the bathroom, so <br/>
to state you have to use the &quot;bathroom&quot; would be misleading.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone in Vermont?  I just moved here from Seattle and it is colder <br/>
than you can believe here.  I am freezing my butt off!<br/>

(I don&#39;t see the first three around here as being in the same category. We <br/>
say stupid as long as we don&#39;t actually call someone stupid. Poop is a <br/>
regualr every day word around here!!! Piss is used as in pissed off. My mom <br/>
hates that word but I hear it all the time, even on TV. It doesn&#39;t offend me <br/>
but I will refrain around mom. &lt;BEG&gt; I use bitch on occasion referring to a <br/>
certain someone and bastard, well, it&#39;s just not needed. LOL!!! Goddamn I <br/>
don&#39;t use but the others do come about every now and then. Usually only <br/>
around my hubby, oldest daughter and a friend or two. I guess it all depends <br/>
on where you are and who you are around. As far as shut up goes, we don&#39;t <br/>
use it although on occasion, when our little Beagle gets in her mood and <br/>
starts howling at Ozzy, I have been known to shout it out at her! It&#39;s <br/>
usually right before I have the thought of strangling her. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

Hi Cindy - I&#39;m in MA, not VT, but you just need to develop the<br/>
NEnglander&#39;s view on weather:  Sure it&#39;s only 19 degrees today, but<br/>
doesn&#39;t it feel warm compared to last week?  I hear it might hit 24<br/>
tomorrow, so we&#39;re going to plan something outside to take advantage of<br/>
the nice weather :0).  Is there anything better than hot chocolate and a<br/>
toasted marshmallow?  Just think what those poor saps in *insert warm<br/>
place here* are missing!  (oh, and if you&#39;re ever at my parent&#39;s house,<br/>
just say &quot;excuse me&quot; and go do your business. They don&#39;t want to know<br/>
that butts, pee, or toilets exist!)  ~Rue <br/>

<br/>
OH! That one can be added to the list too. YEP! Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
I INSIST, when other kids tell me and Duncan that ____ is a bad word, that <br/>
there are NO bad words. Some meanings and connotations can be considered <br/>
insulting and inappropriate, and we should all know when to use which words. <br/>
Most Grandmas would rather not hear certain words. Some families have bans on <br/>
some words. Some situations call for certain language. A bunch of 17 year <br/>
olds watching a football game wouldn&#39;t use the same language as when they&#39;re <br/>
at tea with the queen. Common Sense!<br/>
<br/>
My (6 yrold) niece is not allowed to watch Rugrats because Angelica says the <br/>
&quot;S&quot;-word. I asked, &quot;What S-word?&quot; &quot;You know, S-S-S-S-S.&quot;  I was <br/>
stumped--really. She said &quot;S-S-S-S----OOOO , OOOpid&quot; I was floored. She won&#39;t <br/>
even say it outloud.<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t be better to explain that there are times <br/>
and places for everything. To use good judgement. NOT restrictions.<br/>

<br/>
I think in general that phrases we would consider &quot;rude&quot; in America <br/>
are used more in the UK, but with a more tongue-in-cheekiness. I know <br/>
British people who, for instance, would think nothing of calling a <br/>
girlfriend a &quot;stupid cow&quot; to her face, whereas that would more or <br/>
less be grounds for divorce or end of friendship here :-). British <br/>
humor and sarcasm often goes right over American heads. But <br/>
yes, &quot;shut up&quot; is generally thought of to be quite a rude thing to <br/>
say here.<br/>

I only WISH it were 19 degrees!  That sounds bordering on BALMY.  It <br/>
is -2 right now here (20 miles north of Burlington), but was -10 <br/>
earlier today.  Wind chill makes it way below that.  Tomorrow, <br/>
though, is supposed to be around +15, so that is making a move in <br/>
the proper direction.  People in warm climates just don&#39;t have any <br/>
inkling what a sub zero day is really about!  You look outside and <br/>
it is just unbelievably sunny.  Sky is clear.  Just goregous.  The <br/>
snow looks lucious.  And you feel you could just open a window and <br/>
breathe in all that fresh air.  It&#39;s very deceiving.  It&#39;s all new <br/>
to me.  I find that outside activities are just fine at 15 and <br/>
above.  Anything below that, and you are freezing your &quot;fanny&quot; off!  <br/>
Ha ha.  My kids are little, so taking them outside in below zero <br/>
weather is not a very good idea I think.  Even my dogs, who are <br/>
furry like polar bears, think it is a bit chilly.  At this point, we <br/>
are watching quite a lot of cartoons and playing computer games.  <br/>
Once in awhile we&#39;ll look through a book on sea life or something, <br/>
and, since we are practically in our pajamas 24 hours a day when it <br/>
is this cold, even that seems like a bit much in the effort <br/>
department.  Cold makes us lazy.  Hopefully tomorrow we&#39;ll be out <br/>
ice skating or something.  The fact that you don&#39;t have to go to an <br/>
ice rink and pay is a bonus -- free skating right outdoors, <br/>
imagine!  Enjoy your 19 degree weather.  Sounds warm to me!<br/>

friends and I knew the child and how his temper was, the first time I would <br/>
probably have to leave the room to keep from laughing. So in general the <br/>
&quot;bad&quot; words don&#39;t really bother me but when heard in public places from <br/>
people I don&#39;t know, I tend to not like them. My kids hear plenty here from <br/>
us slipping at times and also from movies and even the radio. It&#39;s no big <br/>
deal and they don&#39;t use them. Not sure what I would feel like if one of them <br/>
under the age of say 15 or so would come out with fuck. It&#39;s just the way we <br/>
are and what we are use to. There has been a time or two when Tara and <br/>
Joseph were little and they came out with hell or damn and I thought it was <br/>
hysterical.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, when out in public and I hear the f word a lot from kids around <br/>
all kind of people, I don&#39;t like it and have said something at times.<br/>

You can say those things behind people&#39;s backs in private (&quot;I wish that <br/>

&lt;&lt;  I know <br/>
British people who, for instance, would think nothing of calling a <br/>
girlfriend a &quot;stupid cow&quot; to her face, whereas that would more or <br/>
less be grounds for divorce or end of friendship here :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or even JUST stupid or JUST cow, but yes, the combination would be the end of <br/>
future eye contact.<br/>

<br/>
A side story -<br/>
About a month ago my kids and other kids from our homeschool group had a<br/>
small chess tournament against another chess team from a private (religious)<br/>
school. It was 5 against 5 team members.<br/>
As kids finished up their chess games and went into another room to play, we<br/>
parents were just waiting in the main room for the tournament to end.<br/>
The other  (play) room had a chalk board in it.<br/>
After everyone was done playing and the other team left, one of the mom&#39;s in<br/>
our group went to check the room to make sure everything was cleaned up and<br/>
saw that someone had written on the chalk board &quot;die nigger&quot;.<br/>
There wasn&#39;t even ANY black people anywhere around the place!<br/>
She asked if any of our kids had anything do to with it or if they saw<br/>
anyone writing it.<br/>
Some of our kids said they saw some of the kids from the other school<br/>
fooling around on the chalk board.<br/>
<br/>
The conclusion is that we are SURE that none of our kids wrote that and one<br/>
of the kids from the private school did.<br/>
Driving in the car on the way home, my kids asked us what a &#39;nigger&#39; was -<br/>
they&#39;ve never heard that term and honestly didn&#39;t know what it meant. We<br/>
explained as tactfully as we could and turned it into a history lesson of<br/>
sorts.<br/>
Sad but true story.<br/>
Another &quot;bad&quot; word around here.<br/>
