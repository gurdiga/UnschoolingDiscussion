<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208178171">&lt;So true! I once spent over $200 on groceries&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Danielle!  I thought maybe I was just WAYYYY overboard, I <br/>
also EASILY drop that much in a week, usually a bit more than that.  <br/>
Part of it is all my organic stuff but even when I didn&#39;t buy organic <br/>
I spend that much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417279389">&lt;Within an unschooling context, I think it&#39;s worth suggesting that you <br/>
listen<br/>
to you own body first and what books say and what other people tell you<br/>
second.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good thing to bring up Sandra, I think that is really the key!  People <br/>
don&#39;t listen to their bodies!  I actually was determined here a few <br/>
months ago to retrain myself to eat meat because being a vegetarian is <br/>
not always convenient in social situations; bad decision because my <br/>
body was a MESS!  I don&#39;t know if it was because I haven&#39;t eaten meat <br/>
in 10 years or what but I was all out of whack.  I listened and <br/>
returned to my nice vegetarian life, even stricter than before, and I <br/>
feel SOOOO much better.  I know people who can eat quite a bit of meat <br/>
and feel fine though; same goes for sugar and lots of other things.  <br/>
Different bodies handle things differently and we have to listen to <br/>
our own bodies, same as being mindful of other areas of our lives and <br/>
our kids lives.<br/>
