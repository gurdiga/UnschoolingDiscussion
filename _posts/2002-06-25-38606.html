The one fire was started by the woman who was lost in the national<br/>
forest, which was *closed* at the time because of fire danger so what the<br/>
hell was she doing there?, and she saw a helicopter so she lit a flare to<br/>
signal and by the time it landed the fire was already out of control...<br/>
man, she was an idiot. I hope they bill her. <br/>
<br/>
Gov. Hull was talking about some federal policies that had prevented the<br/>
removal of underbrush for years, she was saying that had a lot to do with<br/>
it all...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been following the Rodeo fire in Arizona in the news. I grew up in<br/>
&gt; Arizona. The White Mountains are burining. Show Low is burning - the main<br/>
&gt; street in town is called Deuce of Clubs, because that was the low card<br/>
&gt; that the winning rancher turned up. We used to go up fishing near there<br/>
&gt; during the summer, at Lake of the Woods in Pinetop-Lakeside, at a cabin<br/>
&gt; in Greer, in Heber-Overgaard. Heber-Overgaard already burned. It&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; biggest fire in Arizona history.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s all very very sad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am SO grieving over this fire.<br/>
I just checked and the fire has consumed 331,000 acres of the largest<br/>
ponderosa pine forest in this continent.<br/>
<br/>
My FIL has a condo and timeshare which he has owned for about 30 yrs. up in<br/>
Pinetop.<br/>
We go up there several times a year and go skiing in the White Mountains.<br/>
It is SUCH beautiful country, and so much is gone now.<br/>
All the people who live in the area and have employement and businesses ,<br/>
etc. will be hurt the most.<br/>
I have no idea what this fire will mean to their future and how they can<br/>
move on.<br/>
I hear they will be receiving federal aid, hopefully that will help.<br/>
And many people are donating articles for Red Cross to give to the 25,000 or<br/>
so people who&#39;ve been evacuated from their homes.<br/>
<br/>
I always thought living in Arizona meant that we were pretty fortunate to be<br/>
untouched by the forces of nature like hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes,<br/>
etc. But this fire has really wiped out a treasure of Arizona (and the<br/>
country) which will probably take 50-100 years to return to it&#39;s original<br/>
state. Though these fires were not originally naturally occuring, they were<br/>
started by humans, which someone makes it worse.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s very, very sad. :-(<br/>
