<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358936758">I am in awe of my little girl, who will be 4 in July. There is something <br/>
about the age of three. There is no doubt watching her how learning happens. <br/>
I remember having the same awe about my oldest daughter when she was three, <br/>
and I sent her to preschool to encourage her brilliance :0(  <br/>
 <br/>
The guilt of what I may have done to that exuberance for the world around her <br/>
just gets me. Getting a second chance to watch my second daughter not be <br/>
interfered with is such a blessing. <br/>
<br/>
She does have a 4yo friend who is going off to kindergarten next year and has <br/>
told my 3yo. This child&#39;s mother works at home, and still sends her to <br/>
daycare a few times a week, or to my house, and she doesn&#39;t even really know <br/>
me. Her child can spend hours in my house unchecked. She even called me up <br/>
and offered me a fulltime childcare opportunity &quot;because she heard I was <br/>
homeschooling now&quot;. Okay, I won&#39;t go there! <br/>
<br/>
But my 3yo asked a few weeks ago could she go to kindergarten when she is <br/>
4yo. I said if she wants to, but she doesn&#39;t have to. She can stay home with <br/>
mommy if she wants. She told me a few days ago she doesn&#39;t want to go to K, <br/>
she wants to stay home with me and homeschool. <br/>
<br/>
I have never used the word homeschool with her, maybe she picked it up by <br/>
hearing my oldest and I talk about it. She has been asking for &quot;homework&quot; so <br/>
she can homeschool now. She draws me pictures of chickens by tracing her hand <br/>
and putting a smiley face on the thumb. <br/>
<br/>
I just discovered she can write a letter A(her name is Ashlyn). Brings back <br/>
memories of when my oldest was almost 4 and could write the letter M(her name <br/>
is Megan). They both taught themselves. I remember telling Megan M circle M <br/>
spelled MOM, and she started writing MOM everywhere. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why Ashlyn changed her mind about kindergarten. Maybe because <br/>
she heard Megan, who was deciding to go to 6th grade middle school next fall, <br/>
abruptly say she was never going back to school and that was that, and she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t care if I ever mentioned school again. She insists I didn&#39;t <br/>
influence her decision, she just came to her senses. <br/>
<br/>
She said her 6th grader cousin was trying to lure her to school yesterday <br/>
with talk of band, dances, lockers, etc. She said she had a comeback for <br/>
everything the cousin brought up. She said she knows she can get those things <br/>
without school. She sounds much more confident about it than a few weeks ago. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
YAY!!!!!!!!!<br/>
