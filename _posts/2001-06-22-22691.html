<div id="ygrps-yiv-547324832">Hi cool list!<br/>
<br/>
 My name is Bronwen.  My husband Lon and I have three children, all unschooled, all the time (hee hee).  Chloe 13, Reed 8, and Gordon 9 months :-)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is an incredibly dedicated ballet dancer and wants to make it a career.  My son is totally into make believe and RPG on game boy.  And my baby is so cute we almost pass out looking at him (hee).  <br/>
<br/>
I am so excited to be on this list.  It is so nice to listen to some like minds.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone do 4-H? we were thinking about it, for little bantam chickens.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Bronwen<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow!  Yeah my friend has them and they are just so neat and eat slugs in your garden- we can have a couple hens but no roosters, because of city ordinences. The chicks must be the size of a cotton ball :-)  Did you sell/give them to your friends? That is one reason we were going to get into the 4-H, because we need to buy them and hopefully 4-H would give us some connections. <br/>
<br/>
And thanks to everyone for the warm welcome :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877017545">the chick chain is a program the 4-H in our area does. you pay $25 for 25 chicks, straight run. you raise the chickens and at the local county fair in the fall, you give the 4-h six of the chickens to sell. You get to keep the rest. When you turn them in, you get your deposit back and they sell the chickens to fund next year. The kids can show the chickens at the fair an possibly win prizes. Our county will give you support information on raising the chicks. I believe it is geared towards fifth and sixth graders. check to see if your county has an agricultural exchange center. They could provide you with info on the local 4-H. What state are you in? did your grandmother grow up here or in Wales?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290812150">I found unschooling.com and did a search on yahoogroups so here I am! <br/>
<br/>
My dh and I will be unschooling our 8yo next year. This year he&#39;s in a private church school where he&#39;s been since age 5. We&#39;ve been going crazy trying to figure out a curriculum and I am so glad I discovered the unschooling site! It sounds a lot more laid back to me, and I&#39;m sure he will be happy with it since he doesn&#39;t like going to school. He does well in his classes - they use a workbook based curriculum - but he doesn&#39;t like all the rules they have and they have gotten more strict on some things this past year. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think we&#39;ll have a lot of fun together as we deschool over the summer and turn next fall into a new summer time! <br/>
<br/>
I own a business and my dh works nights as a jailer. We will be splitting the schooling duties, pretty much. My ds will come to work with me in the mornings until my dh can pick him up then come home. I pretty much want to offer him a lot of things to do while he&#39;s home and I plan to join a local homeschool group. I have a friend that homeschools and she can help me learn where to go and what to do. <br/>
<br/>
At first I was thinking that ds would be watching TV all day. I know he loves cartoon network! But last weekend this is what he did. A He-Man marathon was on he wanted to see. After 4 shows he said he was bored. He watched a tape from the library about dogs and shared with me some information. He watched another He-Man show and then watched a tape about the ocean and seashells. Then he turned the channel to something else and didn&#39;t watch anymore He-Man. This shows me that my child does know what he wants to do and will make &quot;educational&quot; choices if given the freedom to do so. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to be on this list and I hope to learn a lot!<br/>

You&#39;ll find an unlimited source of info on this list. <br/>
 <br/>
Its been my savior, in that so many people on this list speak so many truths to me.  Truths or ideas that most people around me in real life, think are so out there when I bring them up.  It has also been a prod in getting me to think in new ways,  new ways that really seem to be benefitting me as a person and benefitting my family.<br/>

Get ready for a great adventure!<br/>

Hi, Lisa --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not remembering how old your daughter is, but if she&#39;s 8 or older<br/>
you could help her understand the drawbacks of mandatory school learning<br/>
by reading her the fable that&#39;s at the beginning of the Teenage<br/>
Liberation Handbook.  (Maybe your library has it.)  The story describes<br/>
a girl who just wants to pick wild fruit and eat it, but instead, she&#39;s<br/>
sent to some kind of school where to &quot;prepare&quot; her for learning, she has<br/>
to eat big, unappetizing piles of cafeteria food as &quot;eating practice&quot;. <br/>
It&#39;s an interesting way to start a discussion about different styles of<br/>
learning.  It demonstrates vividly how trying to force learning can<br/>
really kill the learning &quot;appetite&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A similar comparison is from Ivan Illych said a worksheet is like taking<br/>
a vitamin C tablet, while learning from life is eating the whole orange.<br/>
 Which is healthier, more natural and more appetizing?  (I&#39;m<br/>
paraphrasing and have a bad memory.  If someone can quote more<br/>
accurately that&#39;s great.  I heard Pat Farenga quote this part in an<br/>
audiotape from the Sacramento conference.  He&#39;s speaking there about<br/>
unschooling again this August.  www.hsc.org   , for people in or near California.)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!   Your daughter should bounce back just fine, but you might<br/>
want to search for information on &quot;deschooling&quot;.  Especially on the<br/>
unschooling.com message boards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
