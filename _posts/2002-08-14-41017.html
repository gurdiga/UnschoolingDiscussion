&lt;&lt; Thank you , thank you, thank you for the definition of metadiscussion <br/>
(this <br/>
 is a new concept to me and I love it). Adopting the ban on metadiscussions <br/>
as <br/>
 described in your post would be very good for the list. You have my vote. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joyce did this several months ago.....suggested it anyway. She didn&#39;t want to <br/>
be an enforcer of some rule, but she gave us the guidelines to help us keep <br/>
the list focused. <br/>
It works fine, but inevitably some newbie will not understand this and slam <br/>
Sandra&#39;s (or someone elses) posting style. It&#39;s going to happen some I <br/>
suppose. But that&#39;s why you&#39;ll see most of the long timers here asking <br/>
everyone to please focus on unschooling.<br/>
