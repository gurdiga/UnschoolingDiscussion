<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502267629">***I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be blasted again with anything I say ***<br/>
<br/>
We are not interested in blasting you.   We&#39;re interested in discussing<br/>
unschooling ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
***There&#39;s got to be a rabble rouser in every crowd ***<br/>
<br/>
No there really doesn&#39;t.   You&#39;re being funny maybe but coming here to<br/>
raise heck doesn&#39;t seem beneficial to anyone, least of all you.<br/>
<br/>
***When I said that if anyone wants to watch TV then they have to be<br/>
willing to be away from the rest of the family, that was sometimes true<br/>
but what usually happens is that this means we all watch TV<br/>
together.  This would not happen if the tv was elsewhere.  If it was in<br/>
the livingroom, we would keep on doing other activities and not tune in<br/>
to what is on the tube.  I see this happen at my mil&#39;s all the time.  She<br/>
turns it on and walks away and they end up watching some really<br/>
inappropriate (in my opinion) things.  We like to watch with the kids so<br/>
we can talk about what they are seeing.***<br/>
<br/>
This makes absolutely no sense.<br/>
You keep the TV away from family life because if it was where you could<br/>
all see it, it might not get watched?<br/>
<br/>
I think we understood the first time.    You banished the TV and anyone<br/>
interested in it to the basement with cold disregard to the needs of the<br/>
other members of the household.    They may learn to regard your<br/>
interests and needs in the same manner.  <br/>
<br/>
***I was raised without a tv for my entire childhood and I thank my<br/>
parents for making that decision.  I know I would have spent many hours<br/>
on my butt watching idiotic shows and commercials***<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t know that because it was never an option for you.   If you had<br/>
chosen TV it would have been your choice and not the TV&#39;s.  You get to<br/>
take responsibility for that.   <br/>
<br/>
***I want my kids outside rather than in front of some mindless show.***<br/>
<br/>
What about what your kids want?    Is part of the reason you&#39;re<br/>
unschooling to help your kids do what they want?    <br/>
<br/>
***Kids need to know there are boundries and that those bounderies will<br/>
move as they are ready.  I know kids who have never had boundries<br/>
with their parents.  They are allowed to have coke and cookies for<br/>
breakfast adn watch r rated movies at age 6.  This doesn&#39;t serve the<br/>
child in the long run as they feel so alone in their decision making. <br/>
There is no one to fall back on, to get advice from. ***<br/>
<br/>
You know, if a coke and cookies are ok after lunch then their ok anytime.<br/>
  They don&#39;t magically change to Drano if you eat them in the morning.   <br/>
It&#39;s exactly the same thing no matter what time of day it&#39;s consumed.  <br/>
Now, if you&#39;re entirely against coke and cookies that&#39;s another matter.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re new to unschooling and don&#39;t completely understand the<br/>
difference between it and neglect.    Unschooling is NOT neglect.   <br/>
Unschooling parents are profoundly involved in their children&#39;s lives, <br/>
helping and supporting  and offering experience.    They are interested<br/>
in keeping their kids safe and helping their children achieve their<br/>
personal goals.   They are NOT interested in forcing children to meet the<br/>
parents goals and expectations.    Unschooled children know they can come<br/>
to their parents for ANY reason, ANY help, with ANY question or problem<br/>
or inspiration or joy and their needs will be met.   Unschooling parents<br/>
become adept at anticipating their children&#39;s needs and inspirations and<br/>
joys and do what they can to help fulfill them.   It is total<br/>
involvement, not lack of involvement.   Total interest in the lives and<br/>
well being of their children.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t really mean to imply we are neglectful did you?   You didn&#39;t<br/>
really imagine we have not given this long thought and consideration and<br/>
much research?   You didn&#39;t imagine we haven&#39;t seen with our own eyes the<br/>
health and joy in our children because of unschooling?<br/>

<br/>
I know of kids like this too, and you seem to be equating our advice with <br/>
that type of parenting (or lack of parenting actually).<br/>
It&#39;s nowhere near the same.<br/>
We rarely have soda in the house, but if when we do, my kids will more likely <br/>
choose oatmeal and soy milk over cookies and soda.  I&#39;ve watched Trevor eat a <br/>
big bowl of ice cream before dinner and then load up on green beans and <br/>
potatoes.<br/>
Food is just food here. They aren&#39;t shamed for eating things I think are <br/>
unhealthy.<br/>
They are given information, both how nutritious certain foods are and also <br/>
the problems certain foods can POTENTIALLY cause. I don&#39;t use scare tactics, <br/>
I try to stick with facts. An occasional soda is unlikely to harm anyone <br/>
unless they&#39;re diabetic or something. As much as I think it&#39;s harmful, I do <br/>
think they are capable of choosing for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
If any of my children were really interested in a particular movie, I would <br/>
find a way to make it work....either by warning them of potentially <br/>
disturbing scenes or helping them edit to their satisfaction.<br/>
I have a 13 y.o. that will not watch rated R. He tells people &quot;I can&#39;t watch <br/>
rated R&quot;, I questioned him on this since I don&#39;t tell him he can&#39;t. His <br/>
answer was &quot;It&#39;s true Mom, I didn&#39;t say YOU wouldn&#39;t let me, I said I can&#39;t <br/>
watch them. I&#39;m not ready for rated R yet&quot;<br/>
Dh and I have tried to get him to watch Braveheart with us, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
feel ready for that intense of a movie yet!! He knows himself. I&#39;m very glad <br/>
for that....a level of self knowing he couldn&#39;t have gained if I&#39;d continued <br/>
to be controlling.<br/>
<br/>
Not forbidding things doesn&#39;t mean &quot;hands off&quot; in any way. We are there, <br/>
guiding with information and being a safety net for our children. That is WAY <br/>
different than someone that only provides unhealthy food, overly intense <br/>
movies and then leaves a child to themselves.<br/>
My children are surrounded by lots and lots of choices. And they make the <br/>
choices that are best for them at any given moment. It&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This kind of comment does bother me.<br/>
You are basically implying that we DO want our children in front of some <br/>
&quot;mindless&quot; show instead of doing other things. I also cringe when I hear <br/>
parents say *I* want my children ___________instead of_________.&quot;<br/>
As though what YOU want for their lives is somehow the only thing that <br/>
matters.<br/>
<br/>
I know that you care deeply for your children...that is very evident. I hope <br/>
you don&#39;t think that by tearing apart idea or trying to help you see another <br/>
side of this issue, you don&#39;t take that as a slam against your parenting.<br/>
I was a loving, caring Mom when I restricted tv.<br/>
But breaking down that wall has made our relationships MUCH better. The kids <br/>
trust me more. I enjoy tv more by seeing it through their eyes.<br/>
I also see no &quot;mindless&quot; viewing going on.<br/>
I see their vocabulary developing rapidly, interest in history, observation <br/>
of human interactions and what drives behavior and good consumer skills being <br/>
developed.<br/>
There is so much to be gained.<br/>
I will never demonize one method of gaining information again....it&#39;s <br/>
nonsense to say any method of communication is &quot;mindless&quot;.<br/>
It shows more about the myths that society has bought into than actual truth.<br/>

on this list.  When they tell the truth as they see it, and not pretend to <br/>
accept another person&#39;s non-unschooling philosophy as &#39;their way&#39; of doing <br/>
things.  I&#39;m on other lists where everyone&#39;s warned to &#39;not rock the boat&#39; <br/>
and very few people actually take on a really new way of looking at <br/>
things.  They just plod along, looking for that magic curriculum that&#39;ll <br/>
make their lives wonderful.  Honest.  It&#39;s the creepiest thing.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that, while on this list, I don&#39;t remember anyone <br/>
actually being mean.  Nobody. Punches aren&#39;t pulled because they aren&#39;t <br/>
even thrown!!!   Sometimes hard truths are said, but if nobody ever said <br/>
the hard truths, would the listener recognize them as quickly and outgrow them?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay, so I&#39;m rambling, but let me leave you with my favorite <br/>
comics-story/thought exercise for this.  (Yeah, I like the comics!):<br/>
A zen master stands before a student and the student asks, What is the <br/>
meaning of life?  The zen master thumps him on the head with a stick.  The <br/>
next day, the same thing happens.  And so on.  And so on.  One day, the <br/>
student doesn&#39;t need to ask and you see the student and master smiling.<br/>
<br/>
I used to think this example was incredibly cruel.  Why didn&#39;t the master <br/>
explain the meaning of life?  It would have been so easy and painless for <br/>
them both!  After many, many years of thinking of this story, I finally <br/>
realized.  The student *couldn&#39;t* grow in understanding until he had gotten <br/>
past the expectations, the false presumptions of how &#39;growing in <br/>
understanding&#39; works.  The master was wacking him to try and help him &#39;wake <br/>
up&#39;, to get him upset enough that he would begin to question his own <br/>
presumptions, his own prejudices and perspectives... to release them.<br/>
<br/>
This list, and another I am on, are like that zen master.  Thumping folks <br/>
on the head, to help them wake up to awareness, to help them realize that <br/>
they need to look past their presumptions and prejudices.  (not that we <br/>
should run around thwacking the searchers with sticks, eh?  A little truth, <br/>
yes.)  I occasionally get thumped, and thank goodness for it.  Sometimes, I <br/>
call a little truth and someone else is &#39;thumped&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Wake Up!  Look Around You!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053138611">yes, thanks ren from me too for re-posting all those old messages that<br/>
you wrote on the list a couple of years ago.  i read them all and it<br/>
was really helpful for me to see where you are coming from.  it sounds<br/>
like i am in the same place you were.<br/>
<br/>
sorry if i have missed replying to many of the posts you all have<br/>
written to me.  this is such a busy list, but i am reading it all.<br/>
let&#39;s just say that i have had my world turned upside down in the last<br/>
few days, ok?<br/>
<br/>
i have major communication problems with my family of origin, and up<br/>
until a few days ago, i was blaming the television for it.  every<br/>
night we would all sit in front of the tv, absorbed in the sitcoms,<br/>
and when the tv wasn&#39;t taking over our life, i would be subjecting to<br/>
teasing and coersion (basically).  i think my family put up a good<br/>
front that everything was okay but i wanted to do different things<br/>
than my sisters and brother, i would have thrived if i were permitted<br/>
to stay at home and draw all day.  <br/>
<br/>
i accept that i can have a good relationship with my<br/>
daughter while including her interests like tv and computer games.<br/>
<br/>
and i accept that i will probably not have a trusting relationship<br/>
with her if i am preventing her from doing something that she likes<br/>
(watching tv).<br/>
<br/>
so if i have as my goal to be an unschooler, and to be available to my<br/>
daughter to explore life with her, just wondering what do i do about<br/>
my anger?  there are so many things i feel i missed out on when i was<br/>
a kid-- i saw tv as the culprit but i can accept that it was only a<br/>
scapegoat-- and i think i force myself too much to be the strong one<br/>
when i don&#39;t feel very in control.  no easy answers, but i thought i&#39;d<br/>
ask anyway.<br/>

comments here and there).  As I was thinking about this today, I  started to equate the personalities here to aspect of the Goddess.  There are those Goddesses who present a soft, gentle and loving<br/>
aspect of the divine (Kwan Yin, Sophia), there are those who are the destroyers of illusions who are anything but gentle (Kali), there are the nurturing earth mothers (Pachamama) and many more.  All of<br/>
these aspects of the divine are represented in the voices on this list.  I feel like I know when I open posts by different poeple that I am going to probably be given one or another of these<br/>
interpretations on any given topic.  That&#39;s OK but sometimes it is a whole lot easier to hear things when they are said with loving, caring words.  That doesn&#39;t mean that those who cut to the quick are<br/>
not loving, caring people.  They just have their own way of expressing it and that way is absolutely appropriate and valid too.  It&#39;s just an awareness;  you could all be saying the same thing but the<br/>
tone with which it is said will resonate with some and not with others.<br/>

You can heal your inner child by doing for your daughter what you wish people <br/>
had done for you.<br/>
<br/>
Each time you have a moment at a decision-making point, think of yourself, at <br/>
her age, and what you would ideally have liked to have had *your* mom say or <br/>
do, and then try to be that ideal mom.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That suggestion is SO great.  There have been several times in the <br/>
past (when I was limiting my daughter&#39;s tv viewing) that she would <br/>
get to play on a friend&#39;s gameboy or playstation, and of course, she <br/>
wanted to have one almost even more than she wanted tv.  And the <br/>
reason that I didn&#39;t want to buy it for her was that I thought, &quot;Oh <br/>
great, one more thing for her to be asking to do all the time that I <br/>
will have to tell her no about.&quot;  As my no&#39;s starting fading into the <br/>
past, I started thinking about the whole gaming thing.  And I <br/>
remembered my dad&#39;s reason for not buying us an Atari when I begged <br/>
to have one:  &quot;There are kids who are robbing people just to get <br/>
quarters to play those games at arcades.&quot;  Even as an adult, I don&#39;t <br/>
get that logic.  <br/>
<br/>
So I had decided to surprise her with a playstation or gamecube for <br/>
her birthday next month.  Imagine my surprise when my nephew brought <br/>
over their old super nintendo for her to have, since they don&#39;t use <br/>
it anymore!  A month ago, I would have been stressed and upset about <br/>
it.  But now it gave me joy!  I am able to look at my daughter <br/>
playing and feel happy, not worried about whether it is going to rot <br/>
her brain or something.<br/>
<br/>
And it is funny because since we have shifted towards unschooling, I <br/>
have been trying to figure out how my daughter can come to see that <br/>
not everything she learns has to come from me.  She has had these <br/>
games for three days now, and she will call me over to help her do <br/>
some task that she is struggling with, and I will try, and I can&#39;t <br/>
even get past the easy part to get to the part where she needs help.  <br/>
She is sitting there telling me I need to to this and that, and I <br/>
just look at her and say, &quot;You know more about this than I do.  I <br/>
can&#39;t help you.  But I know you will figure it out when you play it <br/>
more.&quot;  What a boost for her to realize that there are some really <br/>
neat, fun things she can do better than me, and that she doesn&#39;t need <br/>
me to show her how!  (What a boost for ME!)  <br/>
<br/>
I get kind of wordy in my posts here, but I just am overflowing with <br/>
joy like I have not had in quite some time.  I have always felt like <br/>
I loved parenting until around 18 months when all I ever felt like I <br/>
was doing was saying no.  But by listening to the advice of the wise <br/>
women on this board, I learned to listen to what my heart knew I <br/>
should be doing all along.</div>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes!<br/>
<br/>
Okay I can&#39;t just leave it at that. It&#39;s wonderful advice for everyone I<br/>
think whether you unschool or not. Too many parents I believe just don&#39;t put<br/>
themselves in their children&#39;s place and try to understand. You hear it all<br/>
the time with teenagers. &quot;Gee, don&#39;t you remember when you were that age?&quot; I<br/>
guess it&#39;s not so easy with little children. I&#39;m trying real hard to do that<br/>
now with my children in a different way. When it comes to their emotions<br/>
that I can&#39;t understand and relate to. It&#39;s not easy when I look at my<br/>
children who are totally different from when I was younger and even from<br/>
each other. But if I just try to imagine what is so upsetting for them to be<br/>
acting this way (when they lose it) then it helps me greatly. I never looked<br/>
at like that except when they were babies. Once they got to be 5 or 6, I<br/>
figured they could verbally express what was going on. Never looked at it<br/>
from a different point of view. I think Deb was the one that mentioned how<br/>
her brother bugged her with something that was probably no big deal to<br/>
anyone else. To her it was. Gave me a whole new outlook on what my kids deal<br/>
with. I digress. It&#39;s late.......or early<br/>
<br/>
But yes your daughter wants the tv for a reason. And it might even be just<br/>
to see what it&#39;s all about. But she&#39;ll still be learning something from it,<br/>
no matter what she watches.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for tv, then there is something she needs from it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think when we have unmet needs or unresolved issues from our own <br/>
childhoods they can totally color how we een see our own children.  <br/>
Our responses and decisions are more about us, and we can&#39;t see the <br/>
child in front of us clearly enough to respond to what it is *they* <br/>
need or want.<br/>
I have one example, although it may not be the best analogy.<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up (say, from ages 5 to 12) my mother was a <br/>
complete stage mom, signing my sister and I up for class after class <br/>
and then trying desperately to convince us to stick with it and to <br/>
excel.  We did ice-skating for a while, gymnastics, various <br/>
instruments, tap dancing, and tennis.  Tennis was my big sport for <br/>
years and we travelled to tournaments where I won trophies.  When I <br/>
got to be around 13 I stopped wanting to please my parents and <br/>
started wanting to be with my friends more rather than going to <br/>
practice after school.  My mother was devastated and disappointed.  <br/>
One day I tearfully told her that I felt like she didn&#39;t love me <br/>
just for who I was but for what I did and how &quot;proud&quot; I made her.<br/>
<br/>
She finally realized, and shared with me, that when *she* was <br/>
growing up she desperately wanted to take lessons and do something <br/>
glamorous but her parents couldn&#39;t afford it and didn&#39;t care enough <br/>
to *try* to afford it.  She had to watch all her friends do the <br/>
things that she wanted to do but couldn&#39;t.<br/>
So she was completely reliving her childhood the way *she* wanted it <br/>
through my sister and I.  And all *I* wanted was the freedom to play <br/>
and read my books in peace.  I still want that- I&#39;m very much a <br/>
homebody, but my children love to go out all the time on various <br/>
adventures, and I try to have a balance that keeps everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to give them what you were missing from your own childhood <br/>
provided *they want the same thing*.  I think that what we all <br/>
wanted as children was for someone to listen to *us* and really look <br/>
at what it was that *we* wanted.  If you see your kids too much as <br/>
therapy for your own childhood it can actually backfire on you if it <br/>
prevents you from seeing them as unique individuals who are in a <br/>
totally different situation than you were.<br/>
<br/>
Jana, from what I know about you (I&#39;m also on the CC list) I think <br/>
you are a very dedicated mother and your daughter will be just fine.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll second this advice.<br/>
<br/>
There is a psychology behind re-parenting and it&#39;s applied to adult<br/>
children of alcoholics even if they don&#39;t have children themselves.    In<br/>
some groups you become the parent of a teddy bear, and for weeks or<br/>
months or however long the need is, you have the opportunity to parent<br/>
the teddy bear the way you should have been parented.    It is healing.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has had a difficult time coming to terms with his childhood.  <br/>
He loves his mother and he took care of his father when he was suffering<br/>
and dying from Alzheimer&#39;s disease.    He is a good son.<br/>
If he admits to himself his parents didn&#39;t do the best they could have<br/>
for him he&#39;s disrespecting them.   If he tries to be a better father than<br/>
his father was he&#39;s admitting that things weren&#39;t right at his home.  If<br/>
he admit&#39;s that, he can&#39;t continue to see his mother in the same light<br/>
because she didn&#39;t defend and protect him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s complicated and he really resented that I would defend our son if he<br/>
was upset with him.  He wasn&#39;t angry at me, he was angry at his own mom,<br/>
who didn&#39;t defend him.   <br/>
<br/>
He is a much better parent than his father was and is beginning to heal<br/>
some.  He is mindful and considerate and when he makes a mistake he can<br/>
apologize for it.   It&#39;s harder maybe because his father is gone and<br/>
there is no way for them to clear the air now.  His mother is nearly<br/>
eighty, and alone, he feels like any conversation with her now might be<br/>
damaging to her.   <br/>
<br/>
Healing takes time but every little minute you can make better choices<br/>
and be more mindful.   And when you see your child&#39;s happiness, really<br/>
believe she deserves it and that you did too.  <br/>
<br/>
In a post last year at unschooling.com Sandra shared a letter she&#39;d<br/>
written to a cousin who&#39;s father had just died.   There was a part I<br/>
saved from that letter, it was so beautiful and I taped it inside the<br/>
cupboard door where my husband can see it every day.    I hope it&#39;s ok if<br/>
I share it here.<br/>
This is an excerpt.<br/>
By Sandra Dodd<br/>
<br/>
***Spend time being really sweet to your kids.  Do things with them and<br/>
for them you wish your dad had done for you, and heal yourself some that<br/>
way.  Make your children&#39;s happiness a monument to the life you missed<br/>
having, and that you would have had if things had been the perfect<br/>
fantasy life for you.  Each little decision you make about how to treat<br/>
your children, what to say to them, what to let them do, what to say<br/>
about them to others, could be one step closer to giving them what you<br/>
didn&#39;t have.***<br/>
<br/>
I hope I got that right, it was so perfect the way she wrote it and I&#39;m<br/>
typing from memory.<br/>
Damn, she&#39;s good. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

This will seem picky about words, but it&#39;s really important.<br/>
<br/>
You can unschool all you want to without the blessing or approval of anyone <br/>
on this list.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t *have* to do anything we&#39;re recommending.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re (some of us) are saying is that there are principles on which <br/>
unschooling can be based which will take it all the way from being just the <br/>
absence of schoolwork to becoming a life infused with learning and trust and <br/>
respect.  If that&#39;s your goal, then any area in which you assume your <br/>
children are not very smart and won&#39;t make good choices is likely to block <br/>
your path toward real trust and real respect and real awareness that learning <br/>
happens inside the child, not outside on the surface of a television screen, <br/>
or inside a book or three feet into a museum&#39;s very-cool diorama.  It&#39;s all <br/>
inside the person&#39;s mind and thoughts.<br/>

Wow. That&#39;s a huge discovery you&#39;ve made for yourself. Some people take <br/>
years and years of therapy to dig deeper into family dynamics like you&#39;ve <br/>
described.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;i accept that i can have a good relationship with my daughter while <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I think you wouldn&#39;t have *as* trusting a relationship with her. There <br/>
would always be this one thing that she couldn&#39;t be completely open with you <br/>
about. I am sure there are other aspectsof your relationship that are <br/>
beautiful and trusting and onest and wonderful. This would just be a <br/>
stumbling block to getting at an ever better relationship IMHO.<br/>

<br/>
Let it be, but don&#39;t let it control you or make your decisions for you. You <br/>
can&#39;t *make* it go away, but you can take away its power. I find it helpful <br/>
to step back from those emotions and try to observe them as though they are <br/>
not a part of me. Because in reality they are NOT me. They are just fleeting <br/>
emotions.<br/>
<br/>
I like Sandra&#39;s advice of making the choices you wish your parents had made <br/>
with you. Of listening like you wish you had been listened to. Of initiating <br/>
the communication you wish you had had.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have read studies about how our minds become wired one way for t.v. <br/>
viewing, and new paths are not made while viewing other shows. It is the same <br/>
path when we are 5 that we have when we are 25. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s true for everything we&#39;re exposed to!!! New neural pathways are <br/>
formed when a child is exposed to any new idea or information.  But once that <br/>
neural pathway is formed, it doesn&#39;t change. It&#39;s the same at the time it&#39;s <br/>
formed until the end of your life.<br/>
The difference is whether or not that neural pathway is still being <br/>
stimulated.<br/>
If the pathway is formed as a child, then you may not use it for years and <br/>
years but when introduced to the information that stimulates that pathway it <br/>
will become active again.<br/>
So that is just a bunch of scare tactics that don&#39;t require much thought to <br/>

There is a new device being used for blind people (still in the experimental <br/>
stages). It&#39;s a computer chip, placed in the brain to stimulate sight.<br/>
It only works on people that had sight at one time, since children that are <br/>
blind from birth do not have the proper neural pathways formed in that region <br/>
of the brain.<br/>
The blind person that had sight at one time has those pathways formed.<br/>
They weren&#39;t used for years and years, but once stimulated, they work!!!<br/>
It&#39;s amazing, but shows that neural pathways form and don&#39;t change in <br/>
adulthood. They&#39;re just dormant or useful, depending on the persons interests.<br/>

Playing them through to the end and beating the game. He has worked hard at <br/>
figuring them out (he wasn&#39;t a natural at first) and has kept at it with a <br/>
clear goal in his mind, even when he was extremely frustrated. I remember <br/>
goal setting and sticking with tough things being a goal on his IEP when he <br/>
was still in school. It was a big concern. Guess I can call them and tell <br/>
them to check that one off now. ;-)<br/>

&lt;&lt;Too many parents I believe just don&#39;t put  themselves in their children&#39;s<br/>
place and try to understand.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think parents do do that though they think they&#39;re doing what you meant.<br/>
They put *themselves* with *their* understanding in their kids&#39; place. They<br/>
don&#39;t take on their children&#39;s view point and understanding.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Gee when something makes sense to me why doesn&#39;t it ever come out clear<br/>
enough when I type it??!!!! Yes that&#39;s exactly what I meant. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

Right.  But if someone sets that neural pathway and LIKES the idea that TV is <br/>
evil it might be hard to undo that connectionl<br/>

YES!! I really assumed that others would assume this...but I&#39;m glad you <br/>
clarified.<br/>
I meant in the average, healthy, unharmed human being. :)<br/>

not learn that sometimes you have to do things that you do not want in order to <br/>
obtain a goal (because I don&#39;t make Jason do school things like practice writing etc).<br/>
I kept trying to tell him that if the &quot;something&quot; is important enough to him, then <br/>
he will want to do it but my dad did not seem to agree with me. I want to tell him<br/>
to just watch Jason try to master a computer game...there are some times he gets *so*<br/>
frustrated and I can tell he is not enjoying it. But he keeps at it (and gets help from<br/>
us...usually by watching Jeff or myself play the game) and feels so great when he can<br/>
do it himself. He works at it and once he gets it he plays over and over to see how<br/>
fast he can do it, or to see other things that he might have missed.<br/>
<br/>
It is great to watch. I wish that my dad could see it for what it is, but I think<br/>
that he discounts it since it is &quot;only&quot; a computer game. sigh.<br/>
