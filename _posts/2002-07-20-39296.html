<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t consider commentary &quot;bashing.&quot;  I don&#39;t think you presented <br/>
any theories, anyway--just described current practices and asked whether they <br/>
jibe with unschooling theories.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  It&#39;s nothing major, just encourages her to <br/>
spread her learning between the computer, educational tv, fiction and <br/>
non-fiction, and even a little seatwork.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s the &quot;seatwork&quot; that kills it. <br/>
<br/>
Requiring reading of ANY sort can end up being a dead-end road too, and some <br/>
kids will never back out of that, but just decide they don&#39;t see reading as a <br/>
desirable thing, but as a measurable &quot;good for you&quot; thing.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Seatwork&quot; is SO wholly a school-term it can&#39;t exist in the real school-free <br/>
world.  <br/>
<br/>
All the school you keep, no matter how subtle it is, takes up valuable space <br/>
that could be filled by natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;*I&#39;m VERY flexible on this.  She <br/>
gets to pick the workbook, etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But...  but...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s still a &quot;WORK&quot;book.  &quot;Work&quot; meaning what?  Schoolwork.<br/>
&quot;Work&quot; to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
Play to learn will lead to a lifetime of joy, but workbooks will teach <br/>
children to avoid certain things, or to identify some things as &quot;educational&quot; <br/>
and others as something (various things) else.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Flexibility&quot; about which half hour she has to &quot;do workbooks&quot; is still within <br/>
a school model.  <br/>
<br/>
[IMPERFECT ANALOGY ALERT:  Giving a kid a choice about when and where with <br/>
what implement to get a spanking with is still spanking.]<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Once we&#39;re &#39;back in the groove&#39; (all her <br/>
neighbor friends are back to school) she has to be doing something <br/>
&#39;eduationally productive&#39; between 9 (like she gets up that early...LOL) and <br/>
2ish...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once you really get unschooling, you&#39;ll see 24 hours a day as &quot;educationally <br/>
productive.&quot;  Until you try, that separation will keep learning from flowing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;if she can explain to me why playing with LEGOS is educational&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why should SHE have to do that?  Why can&#39;t you?  And if you can explain that <br/>
to yourself (don&#39;t tell her, it will only make her selfconscious and add to <br/>
that separation of learning from life), why can&#39;t you figure out all the <br/>
other opportunities for learning?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But I allow no junk TV or <br/>
Gameboy/Nintendo/PlayStation, etc. until after 2...does this sound like some <br/>
sort of unschooling?  Or am I way off???&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s way off, because I think the central tenet of unschooling is <br/>
that learning should not be separate from life, and the children can learn <br/>
from EVERYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
To separate life into &quot;productive&quot; and &quot;after 2:00&quot; will create a desire for <br/>
TV and gaming systems that you probably do NOT want to create and don&#39;t mean <br/>
to create. <br/>
<br/>
Kids who really want to eat sugar and ice cream and such when they visit me <br/>
are invariably those kids who have to &quot;clean their plates&quot; or wait until a <br/>
certain time by the clock to &quot;eat junk.&quot;  My kids don&#39;t even have the concept <br/>
of &quot;junk,&quot; we never &quot;have dessert,&quot; and so sweets are no bigger deal to them <br/>
than any other food. <br/>
<br/>
Same with TV.<br/>
<br/>
Same with video games.<br/>
<br/>
They have all they want, which ends up being way less than most people would <br/>
predict they would want if it were unlimited.  But until it&#39;s unlimited they <br/>
cannot possibly self-regulate.<br/>
<br/>
And there are critics of this belief of mine, but for our family and many <br/>
others it has proven golden:  Freedom to sample the world in the company of <br/>
parents, including all kinds of TV and videos and games and goofy activities, <br/>
will lead children to calm, well-rounded lives more quickly than ANY <br/>
schoolish &quot;work&quot; ever, ever in a million years could do.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you have 185 days a year in which you don&#39;t expect learning to happen <br/>
spontaneously and happily?  That&#39;s not how unschooling works.  So having days <br/>
when you DO expect to see learning is the school-schedule you can abandon, <br/>
and need to abandon if you want life to start to flow through and around you <br/>
unimpeded.<br/>

<br/>
I have been homeschooling for about 4 years and very<br/>
much believe in unschooling, and I know it is the very<br/>
best thing for kids.  But I had a hard time letting go<br/>
of the workbook, and what was &quot;real&quot; learning and what<br/>
wasn&#39;t.  I had read all of the unschooling books and<br/>
the John Holt books, and while I agreed 100% with<br/>
everything they said, I couldn&#39;t get over the hurdle. <br/>
I picked up a book that really put it all together for<br/>
me.  Awakening your Child&#39;s Natural Genius by Thomas<br/>
Armstrong kind of gave me a formula if you will on the<br/>
whole learning is everyday belief.  I keep a journal,<br/>
just because I like to, about what my kids do, and I<br/>
am utterly amazed at how much they are learning and<br/>
our discussions in the car range from how important<br/>
water and air are to us (SCIENCE) to how many TV shows<br/>
do you think run in a 24 hour period (MATH) to<br/>
listening to the golden oldies and asking who Elvis<br/>
Presley was (MUSIC APPRECIATION).  It also showed me<br/>
how arrogant it is of us to think that chidren need<br/>
teachers to learn.  I don&#39;t believe God or whatever<br/>
your believe system is would put us here without a<br/>
natural ability to learn on our own. It is up to us<br/>
just to be their guide and to encourage their love of<br/>
learning not kill it.<br/>

workbook style activities?  What if my kids enjoy them? They don&#39;t <br/>
complain or growl at all about doing them, and seem to enjoy the <br/>

at each other like he&#39;d come from Mars.  We learn year round, and <br/>
more times than not &#39;most productively&#39; at hours most parents would <br/>
find inappropriate (mid-late evenings - my kids are night owls.) Our <br/>
hs groups meet for park days and LIFE classes throughout the <br/>
year...we see no need for some arbitrary and unnecessary calendar to <br/>
direct our learning!!!!  I just like to keep her on her toes as to <br/>
how her play is also educational.  (Education does not equal a dirty <br/>
word in our home, it&#39;s actually treasured and appreciated, so there&#39;s <br/>
no negative connotation with learning and playing at the same time.)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Okay, so is the general concensus that there is *no* value in <br/>
workbook style activities?  What if my kids enjoy them? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that requiring a half an hour of something is not conducive to <br/>
enjoyment of it, or to seeing whether the children would choose that.  My <br/>
kids have owned workbooks.  They&#39;re kept with coloring books, and used for <br/>
fun.  No value above enjoyment is placed on them.  They can do them in <br/>
whatever order they want, however they want, or not at all.  Same with <br/>
coloring books.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed school, when I was in school.  That didn&#39;t make it unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just like to keep her on her toes as to <br/>
how her play is also educational.  (Education does not equal a dirty <br/>
word in our home, it&#39;s actually treasured and appreciated, so there&#39;s <br/>
no negative connotation with learning and playing at the same time.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you save the paragraph above somewhere  for a year or three and read it <br/>
again then, I bet you&#39;ll see a change in thinking as you get more into <br/>
natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;but I think its a good life lesson to <br/>
analyze the benefits of activities...although it&#39;s contrived, it&#39;s <br/>
still productive to me...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They you should do it!  Your children shouldn&#39;t need to do what you consider <br/>
productive &quot;to you,&quot; but what seems productive to them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I do see the educational benefits from <br/>
video games and non-educationally intended tv shows (shhh..don&#39;t tell <br/>
her that) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why not?  If you&#39;re into having her analyze lego-play, why would you want to <br/>
keep secrets about what you believe can help her learn?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;but I have a hard time setting NO limits...I think that <br/>
learning happens in everyday life, but too much of any one thing in <br/>
my mind cannot be productive...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not in your mind--it&#39;s in their world.<br/>
<br/>
The benefit of setting limits is often no more than for parents to feel like <br/>
they&#39;re doing a good job at being parents.  If your philosophy changes, your <br/>
practice probably will too. Or you could change your practice first and the <br/>
philosophy could follow after.  But setting limits for the sake of doing so <br/>
isn&#39;t beneficial to anyone, really.<br/>
<br/>
Dani, I think you&#39;re just about there, you just have a collection of <br/>
&quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;goods&quot; which are taking storage space in your head and on your <br/>
schedule.  I hope soon you can let them go!<br/>

<br/>
My youngest son, 10 in May, has just recently become capable of being <br/>
(mostly) still and thinking at the same time. When he was much younger he <br/>
used to really like thinking about numbers while standing on his head, which <br/>
was the closest he ever got to &quot;sitting still&quot; (he even bounced in his <br/>
sleep). It&#39;s one of the reasons I am eternally grateful that we were already <br/>
unschoolers when he was born. Nobody here cares (mostly) if he paces or rocks <br/>
or taps or bounces while he talks and ponders, and we didn&#39;t put him into <br/>
situations where people did care until he grew enough to handle them. <br/>
<br/>
It would be &quot;work&quot; enough for him to be still in the seat.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Not that that kept him from workbooks when he wanted - he&#39;d roll around on <br/>
the floor. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
So what would happen if you no longer required or suggested that they do <br/>
them? My guess is that, like my own daughter, they&#39;d pick them up on <br/>
occassion and do a few pages. But they also might not choose to do one for <br/>
months at a stretch. Or they might stop in the middle of a page to move onto <br/>
something else that catches their interest. The workbooks might lead to <br/>
jumprope, might lead to writing a letter to a friend, might lead to rock <br/>
hunting, might lead to...<br/>
<br/>
For my kids, workbooks are available just as another resource. Thy&#39;re no <br/>
more important than any other item cluttering up my closets.<br/>
