<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397440361">lol ... Poor gal don&#39;t ya just hate trying to explain what ya mean LOL<br/>
I think I do understand what you&#39;re saying :) Hope I can be of a little<br/>
help ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=========<br/>
Do you all have a list of chores that you expect your children to <br/>
do?  <br/>
=========<br/>
I personally do not have a list of chores but if you are wanting to earn<br/>
money for them,<br/>
they know they can come to me and deal on the issue ... for instance my<br/>
daughter is into dragonball z<br/>
but I will not buy the stuff for her (videos etc) so she came to me and<br/>
asked if she did the kitchen<br/>
living room everyday etc ... could she earn a video a week?  ($3 a day -<br/>
sure!)<br/>
When she stopped, I started picking it back up and she just didn&#39;t get the<br/>
money anymore,<br/>
but I never made an issue out of it ...<br/>
<br/>
As far as their bedrooms - If I am having special company, I inspect every<br/>
room prior to their arrival<br/>
and they need to be perfect ... other than that ... as long as there is no<br/>
food in the room and &quot;garbage&quot;<br/>
is thrown into the garbage can, not left in the room, I feel that is their<br/>
domain and I let them keep it<br/>
how they want ... They are pretty neat kids, (NOW - never used to be lol)<br/>
and choose to keep<br/>
things pretty orderly most of the time ... If I notice it is getting a bit<br/>
ridiculous, I will throw in<br/>
a &quot;maybe we should get this cleaned up so you can find what you are looking<br/>
for etc ...&quot;<br/>
But normally it is never an issue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
====================<br/>
Does the loose or non-existant &quot;control&quot; of <br/>
the child&#39;s education STOP when it comes to their responsible <br/>
participation in the everyday running of the family household?<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
No - flexibility in educational issues does not reflect on other areas of<br/>
common living.<br/>
But this depends on the parent - some may be flexible in everything ...<br/>
some may not be.<br/>
We are a team - teams play together, work together - etc so they can enjoy<br/>
life together.<br/>
When I look up the definition MOM in the dictionary, it doesn&#39;t give me a<br/>
list of things<br/>
I have to do just because I am a mom - I birthed you but there are five of<br/>
us in this house<br/>
and we can all help to get done what needs done ... we don&#39;t have &quot;set<br/>
jobs&quot; but if I need<br/>
the trash taken out, I will do it or will ask someone nearby ... <br/>
<br/>
If you help when asked ... I will enjoy giving you a treat or a break once<br/>
in awhile - <br/>
like $5.00 in quarters for video games when we go to the movies ... or<br/>
whatever ...<br/>
but if you cop a tude about it or do not do what needs done, then you have<br/>
earned a No ..<br/>
and when you ask me to do something - I will cash in my NO ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
====================<br/>
Do you have consequences when they don&#39;t do their share of the <br/>
chores?  Do they have tv or stereo taken away?  Are these <br/>
consequences consistently enforced?<br/>
===========<br/>
Yes!  If there is no consistancy, there is no reason to follow<br/>
as you will constantly be testing to find that line, because it<br/>
keeps moving so you are constantly lost!  Wherever you set the lines<br/>
don&#39;t move them - when they test these lines, reinforce them.<br/>
They have to test - thats their job !<br/>
<br/>
I think under certain circumstances we can be mothers of<br/>
grace and offer a break but for the norm ... it must always remain<br/>
consistant ...  I do not ask much of my kids ... I&#39;m a pretty easy<br/>
mom to live with but when they see a line - they know it is not<br/>
worth crossing ,,,  They will not lose their stereo for a day - they <br/>
will lose it until they earn it back ... <br/>
<br/>
I will listen to their reasoning - and see if grace is justified - but<br/>
normally<br/>
excuses will not constitute disobeying ... and if it is blatant direspect<br/>
then<br/>
I will let them offer an explanation but there will never be grace ... as I<br/>
will not tolerate disrepect.... <br/>
<br/>
My oldest pushed us so far (prior to beginning homeschooling)<br/>
that she ended up having a room that looked like a room from<br/>
a shelter ... it had a bed in it and a lamp and that was it ...<br/>
she was given an outfit every day to wear and had nothing<br/>
else in there ... makeup - GONE - hair stuff - GONE ... everything- GONE!!!<br/>
until I saw a positive change (mind you, this was a drastic case<br/>
when she disappeared until 2 in the morning so I was up crying<br/>
and scared until I found her) but I don&#39;t play games ... You blow it -  <br/>
you knew ahead of time the consequences - so you decided they<br/>
were worth it to be able to do what you wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thank the Lord, she never did anything so silly again and we moved<br/>
from the city with the bad influences because of that ... but I was <br/>
not giving an inch on it , as I didn&#39;t want it repeated.<br/>
====================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If they are, then how does that go back to not enforcing consequences <br/>
if the child doesn&#39;t do anything &quot;constructive&quot; towards his or her <br/>
education during the week.  And I&#39;m sure constructive isn&#39;t exactly <br/>
the right word to use either ... that definition and labels issue <br/>
again ... but how do you deal with the issue of being permissive in <br/>
their education and not being or being too permissive in their <br/>
participation in the family&#39;s life?<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
I myself feel the difference in unschooling and homeschooling is <br/>
that you are not breeding a non desire to learn  ... you are creating an<br/>
atmosphere<br/>
where their desire is enlightened enough to think of the things they wish<br/>
to learn when they are ready.<br/>
If I unschool my child and my child is not taking an initiative to learn<br/>
anything ...<br/>
then I as a parent can do one of two things - stand by and watch my child <br/>
become a byproduct of bad parenting - or I can find ways to encourage them<br/>
and ignite that desire to learn new things...  We are not here to corral<br/>
them into<br/>
learning a structured curriculum, but it is our job to be sure they receive<br/>
an education.<br/>
So we encourage and spark in them their desire ...  does that make sense?<br/>
======================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps Kathy :)<br/>
