<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325467561">hi,<br/>
<br/>
coincidentally here in austin we have a milk bank, one of 5 nationally.  last<br/>
night on the news they were calling for donations because the drs have found<br/>
that it can literally be the difference between life and death to a preemie with<br/>
intestinal problems and the demand is growing exponentially so they are in<br/>
serious need for donations.<br/>
<br/>
that said i believe if a mother is uncomfortable or has a strong disdain for<br/>
breast feeding she should not force herself for to do so.  the mother&#39;s comfort<br/>
is critical,  if she has negative feelings it gets into the milk because the<br/>
body does release different hormones when different emotions  are being<br/>
experienced.  so if you don&#39;t like it, imo, it would be healthier not to.<br/>
since the mother and child are so connected the mother happiness is a huge issue<br/>
and no one should force another to comform to something outside themselves.<br/>
inform yes; pressure and guilt trip no the choice should always remain with the<br/>
individual.<br/>
<br/>
personally i was set to nurse as long as my son wanted and i&#39;ve heard of people<br/>
nursing to until 7 which is fine with me.   but much to my surprise and sadness<br/>
when rene&#39; was 13 months he weaned himself.  one day he tried to nurse but<br/>
couldn&#39;t because every time he tried he busted up laughing - all of a sudden it<br/>
became the funniest thing in the whole world and he just couldn&#39;t do it.  i told<br/>
him i wasn&#39;t ready - i was really upset, so he nursed for a 4 hr stretch and<br/>
that was it:(   it was like he did it for me and though i made it available for<br/>
him to nurse after that, he had moved on plain and simple - this will probably<br/>
be his style -when he&#39;s ready he&#39;s ready.  kids are funny.<br/>
