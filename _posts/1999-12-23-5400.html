<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500211206">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am a list owner of another email discussion list called<br/>
Texas Home Educators.   May I ask a favor of you?  Could you forward<br/>
this<br/>
information to your general topic list for any of your subscriber who<br/>
may be<br/>
in Texas.  My desire in forming this list was to give those in Texas a<br/>
place for local information and political alerts.  Here is an<br/>
introduction<br/>
and explanation of what our list encompasses:<br/>
<br/>
This email-based discussion list is a list to serve the Home<br/>
Educators of Texas in discussions of home education styles, philosophy,<br/>
books, curriculum, events, and laws in a Christian atmosphere.<br/>
Although discussions will sometimes stray from the direct purpose, it<br/>
usually does not stray from our children&#39;s interests.<br/>
<br/>
To subscribe email: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:TxHmEd-subscribe@...">TxHmEd-subscribe@...</a><br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in Home Education in Texas, I hope you<br/>
will join us.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this information is a blessing to you.  If I can be<br/>
of any assistance to you, please do not hesitate to ask.<br/>
<br/>
