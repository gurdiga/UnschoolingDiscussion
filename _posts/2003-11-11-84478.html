  **We have been doing &quot;popcorn innoculation&quot; here before movies.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Too funny,  I have to try this.  It would definitely work for me, I always get my fill of popcorn before the movie starts anyway.   I wonder about the rest of my family?  hmmmmm..<br/>
<br/>
  We might be able to afford more movies then.  :)<br/>
