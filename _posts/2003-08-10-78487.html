<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474776553">The only way to get rid of the spam is to use a filter in the email program<br/>
and/or to get a spam killer software.  For my daughters, I use a filter that<br/>
only allows email from addresses that I put in.  If someone that is not on<br/>
the list wants to email her, I get their address and add them.  It&#39;s that<br/>
simple.  I do not allow them to use their email address for anything on the<br/>
web.  I have a dummy address that we use only for freebies and such.  They<br/>
can use this address too.  That way their address isn&#39;t on the web for spam.<br/>
 You may need to ditch the email address and start fresh.<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>
