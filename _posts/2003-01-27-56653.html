<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151935672">When a post is used to &quot;cut and paste&quot; for referencing in another post, if<br/>
it is not snipped, that post and every post it is connected to is then<br/>
pasted into the referencing post.<br/>
<br/>
Not a problem if you are on straight email, absolute torture if you are on<br/>
digest.<br/>
