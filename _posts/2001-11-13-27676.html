&gt; Subject: Why the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a self-righteousness about hating TV (or dairy or caffeine) <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; confess used to make me irritable (or maybe that was the caffeine &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lucky to have outgrown that reaction (unschooling cured me -- the<br/>
&gt; self-righteousness of everyone who thinks and thought I was nuts acted<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; psychiatric immersion).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, that self-righteousness almost amuses me, because the picture <br/>
 </span></blockquote>people<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; paint of television is that smart people either a) Don&#39;t watch it or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>b) Only<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; watch mentally stimulating, tasteful programming.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately I see that same self-rightiousness rearing it&#39;s head in the<br/>
&quot;let them watch whatever they want&quot; camp.  Yeah, I think too many people<br/>
restrict their children&#39;s TV unnecessarily.  I also think there are kids<br/>
and ocassion for which a little restriction is called for.  The problems<br/>
come when you try to make blanket statments about what EVERYBODY should<br/>
be doing.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been blasted here for restricting my son&#39;s TV watching when it was<br/>
actually doing harm.  Yet, I hear it from other sources that I watch too<br/>
much TV and I let my kids watch too much TV.  I guess I should take<br/>
solace in that adage about &quot;if you are pissing off both sides, you must<br/>
be getting something right.&quot;  <br/>

&gt; Pam, who should also just come right out of the closet and admit to <br/>
&gt; liking romance novels.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>EEEWWWWW . . . I&#39;d rather read the dictionary . . . but whatever floats<br/>
your boat!<br/>
