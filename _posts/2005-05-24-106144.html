<div id="ygrps-yiv-80828600">&quot;My dad MADE us wear shoes.  So we wouldn&#39;t get cut/sick/anything that<br/>

cost him money.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And stomp on your feet!! That is awful  :( I&#39;ll try and think of that when<br/>
other kids look enviously at my kids bare feet and try to be mean.<br/>
My kids do leave their shoes at places often. I try and always have a<br/>
back-up in the car, but there have been times when they didn&#39;t have shoes so<br/>
they couldn&#39;t go into a store.<br/>
We&#39;ve have also been know to swing by some big box store and pick up a pair<br/>
of flip-flops; we live in CA and it is rarely too cold for flip-flops, so we<br/>
can make to an event/store.<br/>
My dad is from that old school thought that you get sick because you get<br/>
cold and constantly says whenever my kids get sick it is because of not<br/>
wearing shoes.<br/>
My kids get sick so much less now than when they were in school wearing<br/>
shoes every day!<br/>
<br/>
More power to all the barefooters out there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784169193">&quot;No he won&#39;t.  The decision making repeats over and over and  over.  It&#39;s<br/>
not<br/>
like getting a tattoo.  He could cut his hair off in  the next half hour, in<br/>
the next minute, and then not cut it again for five  years.<br/>
<br/>
When the consequences are less pleasant than the hair is, he can cut the<br/>
hair off.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have to live with it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for putting that into perspective I do have a tendency to become a<br/>
little over-dramatic when it comes to my kids.<br/>
 It is hard for me,  a reforming  Miss People Pleaser, to accept people<br/>
willingly putting themselves in the position of geting negative feedback<br/>
from others.<br/>
But I constanly keep reminding myself- Hey this is (insert kids name) life,<br/>
not mine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322704432">This reminds me of something that happened recently: My youngest Ds<br/>
likes to make unusual fashion statements, (I don&#39;t actually think he<br/>
wants to make a statement just be as comfy in his clothes as<br/>
possible)Older ds had a baseball game I told youngest it was time to <br/>
get dressed,(he was in his boxers) He came out of his room with camo<br/>
shirt , red sweatshorts, his rainbow toe socks and spongebob flip<br/>
flops. I suggested (nicely) that maybe he wanted me to find him<br/>
something else. Thats when DH pulled me aside and said&quot;I thought this<br/>
unschooling thing was to let them choose who they want to be?&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
I think I fell in love with my DH again at that moment, I guess my<br/>
biggest hang-up would be the clothing choices/hygeine.(My oldest is 12<br/>
and his theory is why shower when i&#39;m just gonna get dirty again I<br/>
tried the you&#39;ll ruin the sheets routine, he said he&#39;d rather sleep on<br/>
the floor anyway lol) DH has always been easy going in that area. For<br/>
example my youngest carried around one of my old purses from age 2<br/>
till about age 4 , I was shocked my very manly (hunter, fisher,<br/>
plumber) husband didn&#39;t have a kitten over that one. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Another funny story , about a month or so ago my dad was in the<br/>
hospital, when youngest ds went for a visit he said &quot;pappy what a<br/>
awesome night shirt &quot; he thought it was the coolest, so when pappy<br/>
came home he brought it home for him. You&#39;d have thought it was<br/>
christmas he wore it for a week or so straight (Of course, me being me<br/>
told him &quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t wear it into wal-mart, they might think<br/>
you escaped from the hospital&quot;  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ramble on life is just so much fun since we discovered<br/>
unschooling :)<br/>
<br/>
Have a great night,<br/>
Michele<br/>
