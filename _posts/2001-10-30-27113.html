<div id="ygrps-yiv-824710004">&lt;&lt; And, no offense to anyone who is Jewish on this list but exactly why should<br/>
be help the Israelis invade a land they hadn&#39;t lived in for over a 1000<br/>
years so they could establish a religious community? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with that being the most questionable bit of all.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s actions since then that make us so hated.  <br/>
<br/>
I have read, but not lately (stats might have changed), that American Jews of <br/>
voting age <br/>
outnumber the population of Israel, and that American politicians are afraid <br/>
of lagging in their support for Israel.  Even though Israel has sent spies to <br/>
spy on the U.S.  Even thought Israel has not kept its word to the neighbors, <br/>
or kept to border agreements (thereby not keeping their word to European and <br/>
north American allies).<br/>
<br/>
But saying things like this gets met with &quot;SO, I guess you think Hitler was <br/>
right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No. The extreme rhetoric of either you agree with Hitler or you agree that <br/>
there should be a Jewish state (maintained by the rest of the WWII-allied <br/>
world? or just the U.S.?) is part of what keeps that wound open.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know everything about it, certainly, but I think it makes the U.S. <br/>
look duped and give the world-wide impression that we&#39;re unfair and we don&#39;t <br/>
like Arabs/Moslems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624815803">O.K., here&#39;s another one of my pet peeves since this whole thing started.<br/>
Why can&#39;t our commentators figure out how to pronounce the word Muslim.  It<br/>
is Mooz Lum.  It is NOT the same as the cloth!<br/>

under question also.  The U.S. government is the only country that has never<br/>
signed the Geneva Convention&#39;s Genocide Policy statement.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I agree with that being the most questionable bit of all.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I do too.  I visited Israel for a week in 1984 - a few months before the<br/>
&gt; Intifada started and my view on our support of Israel changed to the core<br/>
&gt; after that visit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No. The extreme rhetoric of either you agree with Hitler or you agree<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; there should be a Jewish state (maintained by the rest of the<br/>
WWII-allied<br/>
&gt; &gt; world? or just the U.S.?) is part of what keeps that wound open.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; This is the rhetoric that Israel certainly tries to push.  Of course the<br/>
&gt; apocalyptic Christian view is that the Second Coming can not occur until<br/>
&gt; there is once again a Jewish state in the Middle East.  I really haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; had time to study and see which came first, the Christian view or the push<br/>
&gt; for a Jewish state in Palestine!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know everything about it, certainly, but I think it makes the<br/>
U.S.<br/>
&gt; &gt; look duped and give the world-wide impression that we&#39;re unfair and we<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; like Arabs/Moslems.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know everything about it either but to me this is one mistake the<br/>
&gt; US keeps making over and over again.  Witness our walking out of the<br/>
&gt; conference on racism in Durban, South Africa the week or so before Sept.<br/>
&gt; 11 - we walked out because our &quot;friend&quot; Israel would probably have been<br/>
&gt; censured for its racist policies.  Nice signal for the rest of the world.<br/>

Mooz... is the second definition in a couple of dictionaries I have, not the <br/>

This is like arguing about whether to pronounce Santa Fe in English or <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472289090">Muslims have asked them to use the Mooz lum pronounciation.  In fact, as<br/>
long as I can remember folks like Mohammed Ali have been correcting them.  I<br/>
guess it irritates me because they kinda shrug and go right back to saying<br/>
it like cloth.  Kinda shows a certain disrespect and who cares attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Or it could be because there are too many folks like O&#39;Reilly on television<br/>
who are bigots and never correct the misinformation they give out.<br/>
<br/>
What started this whole thing was when he had an atheist on his program and<br/>
he more or less called her stupid because she said that Hitler was raised a<br/>
Catholic and he told her she better check her sources before she made<br/>
ridiculous statements.  He then went on to say he would have known if Hitler<br/>
was a Catholic because he went to Catholic school.  Well, hello, Hitler was<br/>
raised a Catholic.<br/>
<br/>
Then she said that in the Bible Jesus said that he did not come to send<br/>
peace but a sword.  Well, O&#39;Reilly came unhinged!  He was exceedingly rude.<br/>
Well, he was wrong again.<br/>
<br/>
Did he apologize to this woman?  No!!!<br/>
<br/>
And he is just one of many that spew &quot;I am an expert&quot; and the general public<br/>
goes forth taking it all as gospel.<br/>
