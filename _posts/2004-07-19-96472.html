I remember going nuts for chewing straws and ice when my wisdom teeth came in <br/>
at around 22.  My mom only had 2 wisdom teeth on the bottom and I got 6!! 2 <br/>
on the bottom and 4 on top, I went through a lot of ice :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also crack my knuckles but my mom started that pulling by my toes when I <br/>
was little, we got huge giggles from it but it stuck with me.<br/>

I did read in my research last night that sometimes ice-chewing is a sign of<br/>
iron deficiency anemia, but it was not a conclusive statement.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If some people think that is sometimes a sign of iron deficiency, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; change the fact that some people just like to mess with ice when their drink<br/>
&gt; is gone.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Actually&quot; is  too  strong a word.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - I wasn&#39;t sure about this and thought it was interesting. I&#39;d <br/>
heart this thing about ice many times, never checked whether or not <br/>
there was any truth in it. So - I just spent some time wandering around <br/>
the internet looking for reliable sources of information and here is <br/>
what I found:<br/>
<br/>
Any kind of super obsessive cravings - like if you can&#39;t be without it <br/>
at all - have to plan your whole day around making sure you have ice to <br/>
crunch on, but it also can be other odd things like orange peels - <br/>
might be a sign of some kind of deficiency, commonly iron or zinc, and <br/>
should trigger a trip to the doctor for some testing.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t about those of us who just like to eat the ice when we&#39;ve <br/>
finished our pepsi. And it isn&#39;t about those who like shaved ice treats <br/>
or even to suck on an ice cube when the weather is hot.<br/>
