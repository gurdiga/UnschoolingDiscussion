<br/>
From the article by Eugene Linden:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;        Eventually, this juggernaut will crash as the consequences of its<br/>
 </span></blockquote>impossible assumptions - infinite resources, infinite tolerances in natural<br/>
systems, and efficient markets - make themselves felt through ecosystem<br/>
collapse, climate change, and economic and political upheaval. When<br/>
instability returns, large numbers of people will turn away from the myths<br/>
of the consumer society, and turn towards religion for explanations of their<br/>
plight. People tend to make a virtue of necessity, and if future material<br/>
prospects become more modest, non-material satisfactions will offer<br/>
solace.&lt;&lt;<br/>
