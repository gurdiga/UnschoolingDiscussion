<div id="ygrps-yiv-126088833"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How do you decide what they have to buy themselves and what you buy<br/>
&gt; for them?  What I sometimes run into is my daughter will spend her<br/>
&gt; money on something--usually yet another stuffed animal.  Then we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; run across something else she wants--something that I also think it<br/>
&gt; would be neat for her to have--and sometimes I end up buying it for<br/>
&gt; her anyway.  Then I end up thinking what&#39;s the point of giving her a<br/>
&gt; set amount in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 6 year old son gets 5 euros a week (used to be $4.50, now closer to $5).<br/>
He started getting an allowance at 5; a small amount which increased when he<br/>
showed good sense with it.  Our deal with him is that 10% goes to the<br/>
church, 10% goes to long-term savings and the rest is &quot;expendable&quot;.  He buys<br/>
birthday presents for his friends out of it (usually about 5 euros per), and<br/>
last year he bought all his own Christmas presents, plus whatever things he<br/>
wanted.  He&#39;s become very good at budgeting, and generally has 10+ euros<br/>
around at any given time.  I gave up some control by giving him an<br/>
allowance, so if he doesn&#39;t buy what I think he should, that&#39;s MY problem.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter spends her money on something and then wants something else<br/>
later in the week, you may want to let her live without it.  It&#39;s the same<br/>
situation we grownups find ourselves in.  If I choose to spend money on<br/>
dinner out one night because I&#39;m too tierd to cook, and a week later some<br/>
folks want to go out for lunch, I may have to forego if I don&#39;t have the<br/>
funds.  As your daughter becomes accustomed to the idea that the &quot;bank of<br/>
Mom&quot; isn&#39;t going to bail her out, she&#39;ll probably become better at<br/>
budgeting.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s so important for kids to learn to manage money -- both to save<br/>
and to spend.  It&#39;s ok to buy junk sometimes...*I* buy junk at the grocery<br/>
now and then, why shouldn&#39;t my son!  We just have to learn to not buy ALL<br/>
junk!<br/>
