&lt;&lt; Does anyone have a typical Statement of Faith from a major exclusionary<br/>
Christian homeschooling group?  That might clarify what specific beliefs<br/>
we are talking about.<br/>

1.  We believe that some parents are called by God to educate their own <br/>
children at home, while other are called by God to send their children to <br/>
private or public schools. <br/>
<br/>
2.We believe that all ministries done in the name and service of Jesus Christ <br/>
are equally important in the sight of God.<br/>
<br/>
3.  We believe that he best education encompasses a balance of training in <br/>
academics, in developing a strong healthy body, in cultivating a deep and <br/>
personal relationship to Christ, and in learning to love and serve others.<br/>
<br/>
4.  To share knowledge concerning how to best educate our children according <br/>
to scriptural principles and the latest and best research concerning child <br/>
development and education practices. <br/>
