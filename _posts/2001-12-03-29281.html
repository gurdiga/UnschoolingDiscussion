&gt; &gt; If you had said this about my child I would have torn your heart <br/>

overwhelm myself to get stuff done. My partner forgets to rinse the kitchen <br/>
sponge.  <br/>
<br/>
Defining someone as &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;willful&quot; is not describing a fault. They are <br/>
judgemental and, I think, really mean terms. I agree that it&#39;s sad that <br/>
anyone would describe their children this way, either to them or to a list of <br/>
hundreds of strangers.<br/>
