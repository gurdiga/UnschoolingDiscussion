 <br/>
 The type of socialization you mentioned is valuable in my opinion, <br/>
especially if the following are all you want your kids to be about:  being <br/>
popular, egotistical, getting into the right college, driving an expensive <br/>
car, getting a high paying yes man job, marrying into the right family, <br/>
knowing all the right people, avoiding the wrong people like the plague, <br/>
keeping up with the Joneses and so on and so on until they retire right <br/>
before they die from the stress and then realize they don&#39;t have a clue who <br/>
they are and just spend the rest of their days in front of the TV set.<br/>
 <br/>
 Not me, and not you guys, or you probably wouldn&#39;t be on this list  :)<br/>
 <br/>
 Sorry, it just came out!   LOL<br/>

   Thankyou for sharing this, I got a real &quot;kick&quot; out of reading it! My ds <br/>
was in ps kindergarten for 6 weeks and he was constantly in trouble for <br/>
trying to socialize with the other students.  I found it amusing that on the <br/>
day we pulled him out of school, his teacher said she would be really <br/>
concerned about his socialization!!!! Rofl!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190897603">hello to all, this is my first time writing here. i notice how many readers<br/>
we have. i love to read but can&#39;t find the time now that i home school. i<br/>
will read a little here and there but not like i use to. i can&#39;t finish a<br/>
book anymore. there are so many reading material that i would love to read.<br/>
i even thought about the bathroom move but it doesn&#39;t work here. i always<br/>
have someone knocking on the door. i barely could do what i have to do, (you<br/>
know what i mean). when the children were in public school i could read more<br/>
often. that&#39;s all gone. i love havng them here but i also love reading.<br/>
well, i thought that perhaps i could get some good ideas from you all. i&#39;m<br/>
reading kid novels now. that&#39;s because the children read it to me. at least<br/>
they are nice too.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; So IS this what &quot;we&quot; are doing?  Keeping the needs<br/>
  of our children upfront and foremost..allowing them<br/>
  to develop at their pace...providing quidance, love<br/>
  support...I understand that some parents don&#39;t take<br/>
  the role of a parent as seriously as I/we  do..so does<br/>
  that make me someone who can be labeled as one who<br/>
  believes in &quot;attachment parenting&quot;? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Yes these all sound good!  Most people when they speak<br/>
  of attachment parenting, they are talking about a lifestyle term that<br/>
  was coined by Dr. Bill and Martha Sears, pediatrician, La Leche<br/>
  League Leader and parents to eight children.  Many people think<br/>
  of AP (attachment parenting) as natural parenting, and often this<br/>
  type of parenting can be found in non-industrialized cultures and<br/>
  considered the norm.  Most Americans practicing AP start from<br/>
  birth, looking to birth their children in the gentle environment,<br/>
  breastfeeding and sleep sharing, and carrying your baby/child in<br/>
  a sling or in arms.  Crying it out and physical punishment<br/>
  are not considered AP.  You do not have to have done all of the<br/>
  above practices to be AP I believe, (example; some women may not have had<br/>
  all the correct information or support to breastfeed their child, but<br/>
practice<br/>
  other attachment/bonding practices).  In turn these practices help you and<br/>
  your child become in tune with each other, so you can better parent etc.<br/>
  There are tons of sites on the<br/>
  web where you can learn more about this.  Hope this helps! ps. I think<br/>
that<br/>
  homeschooling/unschooling is a very natural progression from and early<br/>
  APing lifestyle.<br/>

 All you gardening people, I stumbled into a great newsletter from<br/>

I had to blink and read again when I saw this, cos I&#39;ve gone through this<br/>
last year, I think I&#39;m on the way over it, but it remains to be seem :-)  I<br/>
knew moving would be difficult, since the house was not my choice and would<br/>
not have been my choice, but I was not prepared for the depths of depression<br/>
I went in last year, mostly, if not all, house-related.  Took me a while to<br/>
figure out that I was grieving!  Thanks for affirming my self-diagnosis!!<br/>

  Hi Sandi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; &lt;cut&gt; everyone seemed fine.  Our discussions over the<br/>
  &gt; years have shown that it was much more traumatic than I realized for<br/>
them<br/>
  &gt; even though they adjusted okay.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, already I have become faintly aware of this. Our 12yo who has wanted<br/>
for<br/>
  always to move to the country, started exhibiting strange behaviour, and<br/>
it<br/>
  emerged that although he loves living here, he was still going through a<br/>
major<br/>
  grieving for all that has been his life until now, and has been left<br/>
behind. The<br/>
  2 that weren&#39;t that keen on moving seem almost to be handling it better -<br/>
  perhaps their low expectations enabled them to be pleasantly surprised!<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I had tried to keep them aware of all<br/>
  &gt; plans, choices, etc during the change, but they still felt they had no<br/>
  &gt; choice.<br/>
<br/>
  I do feel bad about this - children have so little choice really, in so<br/>
many<br/>
  areas of their lives. Even when we, as individual families, allow our<br/>
children<br/>
  choice, they soon become aware that other families don&#39;t work like that,<br/>
and<br/>
  that their choice is only theirs by virtue of our choice to allow it.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I always found life in general to be a balancing act.  Home birth,<br/>
  &gt; attachment parenting, homeschooling, all of these things that grow<br/>
children<br/>
  &gt; so well, and have the potential to grow parents well, too, can also be<br/>
  &gt; draining if you don&#39;t find the balance that you need.<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah, and I&#39;ve never been to good at balancing - I always did choose the<br/>
swing<br/>
  rather than the seesaw at the playground &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have an Iain M Banks novel sitting on the office windowsill waiting to be<br/>
read :-)  I bought it for Father&#39;s Day (or birthday, can&#39;t remember which<br/>
:-) ) last year, and dh loved it, but I&#39;ve yet to read it :-)  I need to<br/>
start reading breastfeeding and ap-type books again, since my LLL<br/>
application is getting a kick up the bottom now &lt;g&gt;  I have a second-hand<br/>
copy of a book on gardening with mulch, rather than compost, which I like, I<br/>
think it&#39;s called the No Work Garden, or something like that!  (On the side<br/>
topic of gardening, I got the phone number today of someone local who<br/>
supplies mushroom compost for gardens, will be phoning them on Monday...)<br/>
The last book I read was A Little Princess, I think, oh, hang on, no it was<br/>
a Terry Pratchett Discworld novel from the library!  Anything else?  Don&#39;t<br/>
think so!  99.9% of our books are packed up in boxes in the garage or at my<br/>
mother&#39;s since moving last year, so when I get them out again, I may be<br/>
reading some more.  Will probably re-read Lord of the Rings before the first<br/>
film comes out.  OK, that&#39;s me done (for now &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

  I&#39;m willing to bet that another thing we all have in common, is that we<br/>
  are all avid readers.  After the discussion of Amelia Peabody, I&#39;d like<br/>
  to hear more.  What else do you like to read?  Favorite authors ect..<br/>
  I&#39;m reading my first Amelia Peabody.  Just started it.  I can tell I&#39;ll<br/>
  like it already.<br/>
  Here are some of my favorites.<br/>
  For mystery (my favorite) I love Ruth Rendell.  She has an Inspector<br/>
  Wexford series as well as others.  I also like Martha Grimes.  She too<br/>
  has a series with the same characters.    I also love to read the Emily<br/>
  Pollifax series.  Why can&#39;t I think of the author??<br/>
  I think outside of mystery I really love May Sarton.  I think she has<br/>
  one called &quot;Full Circle&quot;.<br/>
  Right now I&#39;m reading a book by the Dali Lama or rather a phd and him<br/>
  called &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;.  It is wonderful.  I love his philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
  So, what are all of you reading?<br/>

  Another Anne McCaffrey fan!  I have all the books on Pern, and a couple of<br/>
the Rowan series, can&#39;t remember the exact titles right now.  I like David<br/>
Eddings&#39; stuff too.  Not a fantasy nut at all!!<br/>

  &gt;&gt;to hear more.  What else do you like to read?<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Right now I&#39;m reading a book by the Dali Lama or rather a phd and him<br/>
  &gt;&gt;called &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;.  It is wonderful.  I love his philosophy.<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;&gt;So, what are all of you reading?<br/>

  &gt;I LOOOOOOVE that book!  DH and I read it together.  I have the utmost<br/>
  respect for him.  I was fortunate enough to meet him in person and talk<br/>
  with him, and he exudes such a magical aura.  He has a presence that can<br/>
be<br/>
  felt and really affects you when you are near him.  He truly is &quot;an<br/>
  elightened being.&quot;<br/>

  Oops!  and I forgot!  What books do I like to read.  I really enjoy<br/>

  as a way to de-stress and escape for me.  I love Anne McCaffrey, David<br/>
  Brin, Orson Scott Card, Anne Rice, Jean M. Auel, and R. A. Salvatore for<br/>

other<br/>
  spiritual, parenting, psychology, comparative religious, and adoption<br/>
books<br/>
  (just right now.)<br/>

I&#39;d like to, but it&#39;s not big enough really.  I&#39;d like a bathroom big enough<br/>
to put an armchair in, too!  I do like reading in the bath, but ours isn&#39;t<br/>

  Okay, how many of you read in the bathroom? We&#39;ve got a book shelf in both<br/>
  of our bathrooms! (I know it&#39;s not supposed to be the best thing to do,<br/>
but<br/>
  the bathroom sure is a nice quiet reading placing!)<br/>

<br/>
I am on an anthropological quest as I am dealing with those negative folks<br/>
who worry about my kids missing out on all that &quot;socialization&quot; they get in<br/>
school.<br/>
Do you guys  feel that our society over values or emphasizes this value to<br/>

Up here in  New England they are penalized for even being a minute late<br/>
getting in the classroom. I think we may always be late to things we just<br/>
don&#39;t enjoy but even getting to work on time is not something my DH is good<br/>
at even though he likes going to work most days. I look forward to not<br/>
having to be on time for school every morning. Am I teaching negative values<br/>
or just that being on time isn&#39;t as important as sense of self? Socializing<br/>
by being silent and still in a group setting as in the military is also<br/>
against my core beliefs. I am sure all cultures have their peer pressures. I<br/>
am happy that in this day and age we don&#39;t have to give in to any peer<br/>
pressure of any kind  and really know freedom is there something wrong with<br/>
this that I am missing?<br/>

<br/>
The type of socialization you mentioned is valuable in my opinion,<br/>
especially if the following are all you want your kids to be about:  being<br/>
popular, egotisical, getting into the right college, driving an expensive<br/>
car, getting a high paying yes man job, marrying into the right family,<br/>
knowing all the right people, avoiding the wrong people like the plague,<br/>
keeping up with the Joneses and so on and so on until they retire right<br/>
before they die from the stress and then realize they don&#39;t have a clue who<br/>
they are and just spend the rest of their days in front of the TV set.<br/>
<br/>
Not me, and not you guys, or you probably wouldn&#39;t be on this list  :)<br/>

&gt; It seems a lot of people think a better school is more strict, &quot;has<br/>
&gt; higher standards&quot;.  I met a mom who is very proud that her kids<br/>
&gt; kindergarten class is so strict bc the children know what the rules<br/>
&gt; are????<br/>
<br/>
hi,<br/>
<br/>
i went to a b-day party for a 4 yo recently,  all the other kids there met<br/>
in<br/>
daycare,  we were the only homeschoolers.  i found the dynamic between the<br/>
parents and kids really distant, not without love but without closeness.<br/>
the<br/>
parent would stand back and say things like &#39;now uses your words&#39; and the<br/>
kids would be fighting over the toys.  it was odd to me (not the fighting<br/>
part:),  the kids do their thing and the parents do theirs and &#39;never the<br/>
&#39;twain shall meet&#39; just bridged by a bit of vocalization.  it made me think<br/>
that people keep themselves so busy so they don&#39;t have to see what&#39;s really<br/>
happening and if something bad happens they have a good excuse - they were<br/>
too busy.<br/>
<br/>
i have a thing about controlling kids.  boundaries are great but control is<br/>
a<br/>
different story.  i didn&#39;t give birth to prove to the world i can spawn the<br/>
greatest person that ever lived (though rene&#39; (4) informed me last night<br/>
that<br/>
he wants to become &#39;a legend&#39; -i&#39;m not completely convinced he clearly<br/>
understands what that is &lt;lol&gt;) or the most obedient or the kid with the<br/>
best<br/>
manners or any other of their silly accolades.  i did gave birth to<br/>
experience the joy of watching a person develop and find happiness in their<br/>
everyday life and to be of whatever assistance i am able.  i believe<br/>
compassion and good manners are very helpful but only if it is done with<br/>
sincerity not coercion.  this is my problem with schools.<br/>
<br/>
i would be interested in how others step out of the way of their kids and<br/>
not<br/>
pass on all the issue based in social conformity.  from what i&#39;ve seen some<br/>
of the greatest injustices perpetrated against kids is in the name of social<br/>
conformity.  my son is out spoken - for the good or the bad - i make sure he<br/>
knows his voice carries weight.  i also let him know when he&#39;s driving me<br/>
nuts with his incessant talking.   i do not use the word &#39;incessant&#39; lightly<br/>
- he will talk to anyone anytime for as long as they will sit there.  i can<br/>
not even count the number of picnics of total strangers (more often than not<br/>
adult only) he has invited himself to.  he just parks himself without ever<br/>
questioning whether he would be wanted, in his mind of course they would<br/>
want<br/>
to hear what he has to say:)<br/>
<br/>
i am not embarrassed by anything he does.  at first i was tempted to feel he<br/>
was a reflection of me and i would be judged by other because of his<br/>
behavior,  but you know so what.  i know people judge,  their thoughts are<br/>
so &#39;loud&#39; you can&#39;t help but know.  what i&#39;ve found is,  trying to control<br/>
(the use of rules) kids or anyone,  sets you up for a power struggle then<br/>
you<br/>
have to ask yourself &#39;is this really the kind of relationship i want?&#39; and &#39;<br/>
isn&#39;t this just what i have with my parents (or any other person trying to<br/>
have power of you)?&#39;  for me the answers are no and yes respectively.  so i<br/>
accept that i&#39;m breaking with all my &#39;role models&#39; and that leaves me with<br/>
always (at least for now:) having to know why i do what i do and making<br/>
conscious choices so i don&#39;t fall back into repeating what was done to me<br/>
and<br/>
i must afford this right to my kids.  now that i&#39;ve been able to make the<br/>
transition i feel life doesn&#39;t need to be scheduled or planned or have a<br/>
curriculum to succeed and prosper and be happy but just conscious and<br/>
sincere<br/>
involvement is needed.<br/>
<br/>
the other thing i wanted to touch on is that there has been a lot of<br/>
discussion about waldorf, which to be honest i only lightly touched on as<br/>
far<br/>
as reading the emails.  it&#39;s not a big interest of mine though they do<br/>
provide nice products albeit a bit expensive but very good quality.   i<br/>
looked into becoming a waldorf teacher when i lived in northern cal.  but<br/>
backed away.  for me it&#39;s too structured and imposes a reality on to the<br/>
environment rather than allowing one to develop of it&#39;s own accord.   i&#39;m<br/>
not<br/>
as well read on the specific differences between these philosophies because<br/>
i<br/>
make mine up as i go and find i&#39;m much happier doing it that way.   it&#39;s<br/>
hard<br/>
for me to conform to even the alternative methods and this is why i&#39;m on<br/>
this<br/>
list because for me unschooling is more of a philosophical base and methods<br/>
such as waldorf are more of a structure you &#39;live&#39; in.  just some thoughts<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
 I also know two hs families who live right next to a school.  They use<br/>
 the playground after school hours. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL--same here!<br/>
<br/>
Marcie<br/>
<br/>
not only do we live across the street for an elementary school but beside<br/>
and<br/>
behind us is a daycare.  funny how things happen :)<br/>
<br/>
-susan<br/>
<br/>
ps.  someone was talking about other unschooling lists and said they missed<br/>
the philosophical topics found there.   personal i would love to see those<br/>
kinds of topics grow here.  so if anyone is so inclined i would join in<br/>
though i must admit i do get behind in the messages presently i&#39;ve got<br/>
nearly<br/>
200 just from this group to read:0<br/>

<br/>
Susan I am in agreement with you too about the structure of the Waldorf way<br/>
I just like to borrow from what I have appreciated about them esp. their<br/>
books and art. I would have preferred to become a Waldorf teacher as opposed<br/>
to a regular elem. teacher in the olden days because I would have liked to<br/>
further develop that artist that I was ( I realize I still can blossom at<br/>
home along side my own children) I think lots of parents have trouble out<br/>
there in Waldorf land and still have to worry about the &quot;waldorf police&quot; who<br/>
have in some cases literally gone after them! I had a bad experience looking<br/>
into being a teacher at Antioch was totally dissed by the woman who ran the<br/>
program and I was over the age of 35 at the time I looked into it.<br/>
I have also gone to Hampshire College a great place for nonconforming<br/>
&#39;unschoolers&quot; if you can afford it. I think they give scholarships nowadays.<br/>
I had trouble with the drug culture that was there but hopefully those days<br/>
are gone.<br/>
Tell us more about your son he sounds so vibrant and full of self esteem!<br/>

 I didn&#39;t know it was called &quot;unschooling&quot;, but I am happy to find lots of<br/>

Subject: We Want Our Children to Be Suckers!<br/>
<br/>
We Want Our Children to Be Suckers!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  That&#39;s right.  We hope our children become real suckers.  And we also<br/>
want them to be suck-sessful adults.<br/>
<br/>
We derived our non-traditional definition of sucker from Henry David Thoreau<br/>
&#39;s words in his classic Walden.  He wrote that he &quot;...went to the woods to<br/>
live deliberately...to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A sucker single-mindedly goes after that marrow.  A sucker hungers for<br/>
knowledge.  A sucker notes the changes of seasons, the migration of birds,<br/>
the budding of flowers, the artistry of the morning dew.  A sucker is as<br/>
comfortable with the technology of the present as the wisdom of the ages.  A<br/>
sucker is deeply moved in the face of human triumph or tragedy.  A sucker is<br/>
all there, fully awake, completely embracing all that life has to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Sound like a worthy goal for children?  We think so.  Here are three steps<br/>
to help children learn to be suckers:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be a sucker yourself<br/>
<br/>
Model a passion for learning.  Be open-minded.  Try new things all of the<br/>
time.  Focus on stockpiling experiences rather than material objects.<br/>
Travel slowly, stopping and lingering along the way.  Chat with the people<br/>
you meet.  Savor your food.  Don&#39;t jump to conclusions.  Pick the minds of<br/>
people who know the ropes.  Enjoy sunrises and sunsets. Become adept at<br/>
looking through telescopes, microscopes, and just under your nose.  When<br/>
your children see how much fun you&#39;re having, nothing will stop them from<br/>
joining in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give children time and space<br/>
<br/>
Overscheduling our children&#39;s lives may make them into &quot;successes&quot; in the<br/>
eyes of the world, but it won&#39;t help them to be suckers. For that you&#39;ve got<br/>
to leave them alone.  Let them build their play forts, play their street<br/>
games, and experiment in the kitchen.  Encourage creativity.  Expose them to<br/>
the very best in life and let them choose what they want.  Give them the<br/>
tinder and matches, but let them light their own fires of passion.  The<br/>
ability to suck the marrow out of life comes slowly over many years.  So don<br/>
&#39;t expect immediate, quantifiable results.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seek inspiration from other suckers<br/>
<br/>
Mandy and I place our faith in the premise that &quot;a sucker is born every<br/>
minute.&quot;  We believe that everyone can be a sucker, but too many get lured<br/>
away from that. They may be led to believe that happiness has to do with<br/>
money, status, or position.  Far too often those pursuits engulf lives, and<br/>
distract would-be suckers from the path.<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, you can find real suckers everywhere.  They are the ones<br/>
who are involved and active.  They are multi-faceted people, always<br/>
learning, always growing, always changing.  Such people need to be  your<br/>
lifelines.  You can also read about great suckers in history; people who did<br/>
extraordinary things, who were committed to living each day to the fullest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The lifelong quest<br/>
<br/>
Suck-sess has to do with cutting through the veneer of life and getting at<br/>
its essence.  It has to do with throwing out agendas and living<br/>
spontaneously.   It&#39;s about bringing our exterior world in harmony with our<br/>
interior.  It&#39;s about reducing our baggage.  It&#39;s about getting wrapped up<br/>
in the ecstasy of the moment rather than postponing happiness for a later<br/>
date.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, suck-sess is the nectar of life.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re so intent<br/>
on teaching our children how to be real suckers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Subject: thanks for the warm welcome<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see...<br/>
<br/>
Once I read about unschooling in the &quot;Homeschooling book of Answers&quot;...I<br/>
knew<br/>
that was the route for us...It was kinda hard to imagine exactly what or how<br/>
to teach my children...in fact when I looked at the home idea of home<br/>
schooling, choosing curriculums, setting up &#39;academic learning&#39; time...I<br/>
felt<br/>
kida overwhelmed...<br/>
<br/>
Then I got into the Unschooling Handbook...what the author said makes so<br/>
much<br/>
sense...I already instill alot of trust in my boys to figure things out on<br/>
their own and to be able to make choices that further thier own interests...<br/>
<br/>
Also I experienced a sense of relief with the idea that I didn&#39;t have to go<br/>
and buy a curriculum...I have made some plans to create a more learning<br/>
encouraged environment in my den/home office space...I keep my sewing<br/>
machine<br/>
there but soon that will be moved to my bedroom...(it was in my bedroom when<br/>
I lived in a two bedroom apt...)  I am moving a sofa and loveseat to the den<br/>
and adding some bookshelves...and I wanted to get some books that are more<br/>
like reference books rite now...such as a basic math book...that can help me<br/>
and the boys understand what we are learning...not so much a text book...but<br/>
like a how to book...if that makes sense and I also want to get a book on<br/>
grammar that explains all the &#39;rules&#39; so that we can understand them...I had<br/>
one a while back when I did alot of writing and aspired to be a sci fi and<br/>
fantasy author (I have some great ideas)...now I got the APA manual on how<br/>
to<br/>
write journal articles related to the medical and nursing fields (a<br/>
requirement for college)  now I just want something basic that is easy to<br/>
understand that can answer on the spot questions...as for science and social<br/>
studies and other educational &#39;requirements&#39;...well I don&#39;t feel that there<br/>
is any one book we should have so I plan on acquiring whatever seems<br/>
interesting at the time...there are some field trips planned in the near<br/>
future (especially around paydays) to several of the local<br/>
bookstores...(wink)<br/>
<br/>
So far the hardest thing has been sharing my computer with the boys...but<br/>
since I have a laptop as well as a pc...that isn&#39;t as hard as I thought it<br/>
would be...<br/>
<br/>
I am having fun and wish that I had gotten the inspiration for this desision<br/>
a year or so ago...but as I place my faith in God...God brings into our life<br/>
what we need when we need it...<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon...the boys again asked...&quot;When does homeschool start?&quot;  so I<br/>
asked<br/>
what is homeschool and we talked about all the things we did in the last few<br/>
days that helped us to learn something new and exciting...I happened to pick<br/>
up a couple of grade appropriate &#39;curriculum&#39; work books at costco and let<br/>
them know that anytime they felt a need to sit down and do &#39;class work&#39; they<br/>
were welcome to...we laughed at that...then they promptly went outside to<br/>
play with friends...it is so nice to have the wieght of ps off our<br/>
shoulders...and I feel like I am getting some quality time with them...I<br/>
always felt that I was competing with ps for thier time...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This letter must be all over the place...I am just excited about unschooling<br/>
and having a forum to share our experiences!!!<br/>
<br/>

John,,,,<br/>
that was great,,,a wonderful twist on &#39;sucker&#39;, and very true to what a<br/>
&#39;true<br/>
sucker&#39; is--one who puts the emphasis on what can i get out of this<br/>
experience, but not in a superficial way,,or in a me thing,,,,but in a very<br/>
deep need to know for the sake of knowing and nothing else kind of way.  I<br/>
loved it.  Thanks for touching that part.<br/>
