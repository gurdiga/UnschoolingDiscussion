&lt;&lt;   I try to be the best mother I can, because I had the best <br/>
 father. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My Dad has inspired me to be a better Mom many times.  He told me (when <br/>
Trevor was a very little guy) that when I got frustrated and angry to just <br/>
hug my child instead of berate him.<br/>
So sweet.<br/>
And he inspired me again a couple days ago...<br/>
Trevor was taking my camera equipment out to the car for our resource day.<br/>
It was two cameras with several lenses, filters and a videocamera which had <br/>
recordings of Christmas, Jalens first haircut, Trevor and Jalens Birthdays <br/>
etc....<br/>
Well, he set them on the trunk, instead of in it, and we drove of and <br/>
destroyed almost ALL of the equipment.<br/>
It made me ill.<br/>
Ten years of collecting stuff and about $2,000 down the tube in a moment.<br/>
I was physically ill and crying. It was awful. I was so mad at first, but had <br/>
time to cool off  while driving around looking for parts that may have <br/>
survived (after dropping the kids off at resource day)<br/>
I remembered when I wrecked my Dads truck and how scared I was. I just KNEW I <br/>
was in deep S***. But when Dad sat down for &quot;the talk&quot; he just told me how <br/>
glad he was that I didn&#39;t get hurt and that he hoped I learned something <br/>
important and I&#39;d be a safer driver from that day forth.<br/>
It was sweet and calm, not what I had expected at all...even though he was <br/>
almost always sweet and calm :)<br/>
So I thought of that when Trevor and I were talking about my cameras.<br/>
Trevor cried and I told him these things happen in life and it really sucks <br/>
because I can&#39;t replace a lot of it, but in the end it was just stuff. And <br/>
people matter more than stuff and I wasn&#39;t angry at him, just sad because I <br/>
didn&#39;t have my equipment anymore.<br/>
He felt so awful already, he didn&#39;t need anything to add to his misery.<br/>
But I thank my Dad for the inspiration to be sweet and calm in the face of a <br/>
minor disaster. He is a good example, I&#39;m lucky to still have him.<br/>
My Mom died last year, I miss her terrible.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
