Oh, my daughter was always into the crayons.  There was no keeping them up<br/>
from her - EVER.  We cleaned the walls once and then decided that paint<br/>
would have to be done when we decided to move (we lived in an apartment).<br/>
When we cleaned the walls, we discovered MOM written on the wall.  I looked<br/>
at my husband and asked him how you reprimanded your child for learning to<br/>
write with you in mind.  I even had to call my mom and tell her about it, it<br/>
was too cute.  We never appreciated the &quot;mural&quot; of crayon all over the walls<br/>
and the ceiling (they had bunk beds), but we always reminded that coloring<br/>
was for paper not the wall.  The only thing we couldn&#39;t paint over or get<br/>
off was a pink highlighter she had gotten one time, it kept bleeding through<br/>
even the primer on the wall when we painted.  Very faint, at least.  Some of<br/>
the other things my kids did really put coloring on the wall in<br/>
perspective - there were worse and more damaging things they (especially my<br/>
daughter) could come up with to do - and they did.  Just my 2 cents worth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-554559635">Our 2yo is a whirlwind.  If there is something she&#39;s not supposed to do,<br/>
she&#39;s doing it.  At the library she&#39;s trying to climb the bookshelves<br/>
and run up and down the ramp.  Distraction doesn&#39;t work, I end up just<br/>
trying to keep her from getting hurt the entire time we&#39;re there.    Our<br/>
Homeschool group got a great deal at the local bowling lanes, we can<br/>
bowl for 2 hours at $6.50 per person - includes shoes.  Vivien doesn&#39;t<br/>
like to bowl but Isabel loves it so I just signed her up and brought<br/>
stuff for Vivi, my 2yo, to do.  At the end of the 2 hours Vivi had been<br/>
in every nook and cranny at the bowling alley, and when we went to go I<br/>
turned around and she had disappeared again.  She was all the way down<br/>
the far lane that led to the door that goes behind the lanes!  I caught<br/>
up with her just before she got through the door.  I would like some<br/>
good advice to keep her out of trouble without always having to say<br/>
&quot;NO!&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
She loves our cats (3) but she hurts them.  She&#39;ll walk up and grab them<br/>
by the throat and pick them up.  She sits on them!  My response to this<br/>
point has been &quot;You are hurting her, honey . let her go.&quot;  She&#39;s been<br/>
bit and scratched and still keeps going after them.  I feel like I say<br/>
&quot;no&quot; or &quot;not&quot; a lot to this child . &quot;not here&quot;  &quot;not that&quot;.  Advice from<br/>
those that have been there would be a big help.  Do I just avoid places<br/>
for now?  We take her to as many places as we can where she can climb<br/>
and jump, we have a mini trampoline that is in the living room for her<br/>
to jump on instead of the furniture (we&#39;ve already been through one<br/>
couch and love seat), the walls are colored here as well &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, Rheta, your daughter sounds like mine!!!!!! Right down to your <br/>
description of the library trip,  it&#39;s as if you were with us two weeks ago. My son is <br/>
8.5, and we try to do trips  with other  unschooling friends. sometimes <br/>
theyare a disaster and sometimes great. If there is lots of room and fun stuff to <br/>
do, we are ok, but I find that dd2.5 gets so stimulated and excited by <br/>
experiences it can get wild really fast.<br/>
I find I have to be really up for the challenge, otherwise we are best to <br/>
stay home.Some days I worry that ds is not getting needs met, other times I can <br/>
tell myself it is not forever. I am going to try to leave her with Grandma <br/>
soon, sometimes I will take Grandma along to help or a young kid or one of my <br/>
friends will offer to help.<br/>
At home, we have a huge house, with a small climber in the livingroom, and a <br/>
great big sundeck. WE have a trampoline outside(with a net) and swings and <br/>
lots of bike rides and walks. Those things have helped, along with her having <br/>
some friends that are a little bit older to play with her. It has been an amazing <br/>
journey with this busy little bee, and certainly has gotten us moving around <br/>
here.!!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest was JUST like that. I thought all 2 yo&#39;s were like that, <br/>
didn&#39;t realize how much more watching she needed than other kids. But <br/>
one evening I was at a backyard barbeque at a very rich friend&#39;s <br/>
&quot;house&quot; - and I was following Roya around the back yard (we called it <br/>
their national park &lt;G&gt; - it had woods, creek, a cabin, and a lake) and <br/>
I took a 3 second breather, handing her off to a friend to watch for a <br/>
few minutes, and another person at the party said, &quot;Boy, I noticed you <br/>
REALLY have your hands full with her.&quot; I did a double-take - this <br/>
person had SEVEN children under 11 years old and she thought &quot;I&quot; had my <br/>
hands full with my one?<br/>
<br/>
I started taking my eyes off of her for a minute at a time &lt;g&gt; and <br/>
noticed that not ALL 2 and 3 year olds were truly as into EVERYTHING as <br/>
she was.<br/>
<br/>
Then I had more children and they were nothing like her in that regard.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re fine. There is no answer other than to watch her all the time - <br/>
this is the time for it, it won&#39;t last. Call in reinforcements when <br/>
possible, to give yourself a break. She does sleep occasionally, right? <br/>
Plan to use that time wisely.  Choose where you go so that it&#39;ll be <br/>
more safe for the younger sibling. Bowling alleys aren&#39;t the only place <br/>
that may not work well &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939089527">Hi! I should probably introduce myself to the group. My name is <br/>
Tara, and I have been lurking for a while. I have made some small <br/>
posts here and there, but have not formally introduced myself. I <br/>
have a three and a half yo boy named Jacob. I am staying at home <br/>
with him, and unschooling. This thread has really taken me back. <br/>
Jacob is also very spirited. I also didn&#39;t realize when he was <br/>
younger that other children were not like this. When he was that age <br/>
he was constantly into anything that he was around. He would pick <br/>
stuff up, look at them, see how they works, manipulate everyting and <br/>
climb everything. He was just constantly experimenting with anything <br/>
he could find. He would run down the isles at the grocery store, the <br/>
library, and anywhere else.  I find that because he threw himself <br/>
into so much, so fast, he learned quite a lot about safety on his <br/>
own, through experience, very quickly. He has gotten to the point <br/>
now where he understands safety issues quite well, and that it is a <br/>
good idea to stay close to me out in public. With him, once he was <br/>
able to verbally ask about things, it moved from getting into to <br/>
everything, to CONSTANTLY asking about EVERYTHING.  So although I <br/>
know it takes a lot of energy on your part, just relax and enjoy <br/>
this extremely curious being, knowing that you are doing what is <br/>
best for them just by allowing them to explore and to learn from the <br/>
world around them. It was definately a challenge then (and now) but <br/>
he has really brought out my curiousity about life again. It is <br/>
great, and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. - Tara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000017342">I say &quot;Instead of (doing xxx), let&#39;s (xxxx - insert whatever I want to<br/>
redirect them to)&quot; - so for this example I might say &quot;Hey Luke, instead of<br/>
drawing on the wall let&#39;s go find some paper.&quot;  Or if he rejects the paper I<br/>
counter with painting or other suggestions until we hit upon one he likes.<br/>
I like this because the &quot;instead of&quot; draws them to anticipate a suggestion<br/>
and they listen more readily.<br/>
