<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225193469">Today I informed the school, in writing, that Jack would not be back <br/>
next fall. The principal called me and asked for a more detailed <br/>
account as to why Jack wouldn&#39;t be back. I told her this wasn&#39;t <br/>
required by Kansas law, but she requested again (nicely) that, would <br/>
I please give her more of a reason than &quot;Jack won&#39;t be back next <br/>
year.&quot; I was wondering if Sandra (or anyone) would allow me to email <br/>
off list a copy of the letter I wrote this afternoon, and critique it <br/>
for me? <br/>
