<div><strong>My DD has her birthday on the 21st of December.&nbsp; So we always 
have a separate birthday party for her.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want her to feel cheated, 
like my sister did!&nbsp; Another idea that I heard of is to decorate the 
Christmas tree with birthday decorations!&nbsp; I always let my daughter decide 
what she wants.&nbsp; Last year she chose to go to Disneyland, the year before, 
whalewatching!&nbsp; I also make sure and buy separate gifts for birthday and 
Christmas.&nbsp; It may mean less gifts for everyone, but they don&#39;t know!&nbsp; 
Christmas is too commercial anyway!&nbsp; I try for the family traditions. Both 
old and new!&nbsp; Like making a gingerbread house and making our own 
ornaments.&nbsp; We also go to the Harbor and see the boat parade!&nbsp; I hope 
that offsets the lack of gifts that they may receive.&nbsp; Of course, what they 
don&#39;t know, won&#39;t hurt them!</strong></div>

This year the big gift for my boys is going to be a new, bigger dress up trunk and some new props and outfits for it.  Some of it we are buying, but other things we are making.  We have a couple of other things for each of them, stockings and Thomas&#39; birthday gifts, that&#39;s it.  I feel secure in the knowledge that the warm and intimate family celebration, full of love and tradition, will be far better a gift for them than a mountain of presents.  <br/>
<br/>
I come from a dysfunctional family, and there are usually enough presents to dwarf the tree.  I am sick to death of mounds of useless and gimicky junk, with little or no thought put into their selection.  Blech.<br/>
