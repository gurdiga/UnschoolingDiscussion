My computer was down and out for a few days (prob. the reason I didn&#39;t know<br/>
you had already talked about the atkins diet). Anyway, before I went into<br/>

<br/>
&gt; The Atkins diet, which I have the cookbook for here, designed for<br/>
&gt; folk with weight problems and blood-sugar imbalances (with a<br/>
&gt; specific section on yeast-infection) limits carbs to 20g per day for<br/>
&gt; 2 weeks, gradually increasing until a more &#39;normal&#39; level, one at<br/>
&gt; which the person following the program is comfortable, is found.<br/>
&gt; The point is actually for the body to go into ketosis, therefore<br/>
&gt; using the resources the body has built up over the years.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; imperative to drink LOTS of water during this period (as always,<br/>
&gt; but particularly so) since toxins trapped in fat cells will suddenly<br/>
&gt; find themselves free to travel around the body, and also to flush<br/>
&gt; the waste products from digesting protein away.  One also needs<br/>
&gt; to be aware that withdrawal syptoms from carbohydrates will<br/>
&gt; probably arise, along with the effects of said toxins.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; followed the diet fully, but have felt considerably better since<br/>
&gt; stopping eating regular breakfast cereal and eating omelette or<br/>
&gt; bacon or ham.  I think this is becoming a circular argument, since<br/>
&gt; I believe I&#39;ve said this before.  Yes it could be the reduction of<br/>
&gt; milk in my diet from cutting out cereal, but I think it&#39;s the protein-<br/>
&gt; balance that&#39;s more critical to me.<br/>
