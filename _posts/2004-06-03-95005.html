<div id="ygrps-yiv-351051423">I&#39;d be interested in hearing more examination of this as a principle <br/>
to help people get to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;ve heard of music therapy working because it starts with music that <br/>
matches the person&#39;s current mood, establishing a &quot;link&quot; so that as the music <br/>
becomes more happy and positive, the mood is more likely to move along with <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
       And there&#39;s the old saying about not letting &quot;the perfect be the enemy <br/>
of the good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       OTOH, I guess one disadvantage is that it might make it easier for <br/>
some folks to settle where they are and not continue the journey toward abundant <br/>
unschooling. The problems multiply if they not only settle there, but set up <br/>
shop as unschooling meeter-greeters -- without disclosing that UnschoolingWorld <br/>
is really still a couple of hundred miles down the road. <br/>
<br/>
       It reminds me of the signs implying you&#39;ve reached the gates of <br/>
DisneyWorld, while you&#39;re still a couple of counties north (with children very ready <br/>
to be there NOW.) Yes, travelers perhaps have come a long way and they&#39;re on <br/>
the right road, and that&#39;s good -- but it&#39;s a problem if you stop in Ocala and <br/>
then badmouth DisneyWorld forevermore as nothing but horsefarms and highway!  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Recently at a homeschool meeting I went to, someone was looking for an<br/>
&gt; easier way to teach penmanship than making her kids write for 30 minutes<br/>
&gt; every day, which they hated and fought.  (they were only 7 and 8) The mom<br/>
&gt; was miles away from getting unschooling and maybe didn&#39;t even know what it<br/>
&gt; was.  I gave my opinion.... that I felt it was a left brain/right brain<br/>
&gt; thing and some people were just good at it and found it easy and others<br/>
&gt; would always have a hard time and have messy writing, so forcing practice<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t really make a huge difference in the long run.  But this is a mom who<br/>
&gt; feels that practice makes perfect, so telling her to ..just not worry about<br/>
&gt; it.....didn&#39;t really reach her.  Someone else offered a suggestion of a game<br/>
&gt; that involves writing, but much less writing than she otherwise would have<br/>
&gt; her children do.  The mom embraced the idea of a game and slacking off on<br/>
&gt; her standards of writing for 30 minutes a day.  The person giving the advice<br/>
&gt; leans heavily toward unschooling and I was surprised at her advice.  I<br/>
&gt; talked with her alone afterwards and she mentioned to me what I said above,<br/>
&gt; that sometimes you have to meet a person where they are.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think I did her  disservice by talking how an unschooler approaches<br/>
&gt; penmanship but perhaps the person offering her something concrete to do,<br/>
&gt; gave her advice that she will actually use.  Maybe some day she&#39;ll put it<br/>
&gt; all together and get unschooling but maybe not.  Either way, her kids have<br/>
&gt; it a little easier now getting to play a game, instead of having the do copy<br/>
&gt; work for 30 minutes a day.  <br/>

person/people to  &quot;master the information&quot; and then (and only then, after <br/>
they&#39;ve shown somehow like passing a test or spitting the information back or <br/>
being observed in person) going on to step two.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m doing NOTHING like that unless I get paid enough to salve my soul for <br/>
having compromised my principles.  But in the case of unschooling, it&#39;s ironic <br/>
and amusing enough when I stand up and deliver a presentation to people who are <br/>
sitting in rows taking notes.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times, especially at unschooling.com, people will give interim ideas, <br/>
of how to move from one place to another.  But I think jross is right that <br/>
unless you&#39;re clear that that will help them relax, and don&#39;t say &quot;and then <br/>
you&#39;ll be unschooling,&quot; you confuse an issue (if the issue is part of your goal).<br/>
<br/>
Meeting a person in passing, I can give what might here seem like wimpy <br/>
information.  If they say &quot;It&#39;s so hard to finish the work during the day&quot; I can <br/>
EASILY say &quot;What&#39;s wrong with nighttime and weekends?  Spread it out.&quot;  and <br/>
sometimes I throw in &quot;My kids have learned the same things with NO &#39;work <br/>
finishing.&#39;&quot;<br/>

Reminds me of LLL. If someone comes to a meeting, I felt fine explaingin demand nursing. <br/>
If a friend from church is exasperated with her child who &quot;won&#39;t follow a schedule,&quot; I try to <br/>
help her see the neediness of the child from the child&#39;s point of view and offer both my <br/>
experience of demand feeding and some tips for how to meet her child&#39;s point of need <br/>
(the one she shared with me).<br/>
<br/>
That may or may not have led to demand feeding, but it might plant a seed of respect for <br/>
the child that has a chance to grow.<br/>

<br/>
What springs to mind for me is something sequential, like a 12 step <br/>
program or 7 principles.  I realize that unschooling isn&#39;t exactly <br/>
linear, but there are maybe &quot;elementary&quot; unschooling practices and then <br/>
further advanced stuff.  I mean that I think finding ways not to yell, <br/>
or to be kinder in speech probably comes before having really loose <br/>
bedtimes.  (Because a screaming mom seems likely to collide with a <br/>
staying up late kid, especially when there are bumps in the transition <br/>
that cut into how much sleep she gets.)<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling comes before most things.<br/>
<br/>
We could discuss how we all came to unschooling, which changes we made <br/>
first and which later, if it was a slow process.  It would be <br/>
interesting to see how much variation there is.<br/>

<br/>
Like with food. Not controling doesn&#39;t mean never having influence. <br/>
You talk about how our bodies work, how they need different foods, <br/>
how some foods give us more energy than others, you involve the child <br/>
in buying and preparing food...and so on.<br/>
<br/>
It might help some people to see the active side more, or sooner. <br/>

Ah.  More respectful of the child.<br/>

That&#39;s sometimes the biggest jump.  Sometimes someone can unschool a while <br/>

<br/>
I think being more respectful of the child is a huge jump because <br/>
most parents think what they are doing is respectful.  I got in a <br/>
huge &quot;discussion&quot; on a pre-unschooling list about not controlling tv <br/>
and food.  I said I didn&#39;t control these things because I respected <br/>
my son as a whole person who knew what he wanted and needed.  Many of <br/>
the other posters got really upset about this and said that they <br/>
respected their kids too and that that was why they controlled what <br/>
they ate and watched.  I said that wasn&#39;t respect, that was distrust <br/>
and control.  <br/>
<br/>
So maybe different people have different definitions of what respect <br/>
is?  To me telling a person what to do with no regard to what that <br/>
person wants isn&#39;t respect.  But many people in that discussion <br/>
thought what I was doing wasn&#39;t respectful because I was letting my <br/>
son eat candy if he wanted it and therefore letting him poison his <br/>
body.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up unsubbing from the group after being called many names.  I <br/>
did explain many times that my son is not living in a vacuum with his <br/>
choices, that I had a lot of input, but they just couldn&#39;t seem to <br/>
believe it.  They thought I was negligent.  So is there a way to get <br/>
people to see that controlling isn&#39;t respectful?  Can controlling <br/>
someone be respectful?  <br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts on this topic.<br/>

Send them this, and if you write something similar or better I&#39;d be glad to <br/>
link it!  <br/>

Yeah, I can sort of see columns with &quot;more of this&quot; and &quot;less of that&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
I think I don&#39;t do enough strewing. (I think that&#39;s part of why it&#39;s <br/>
been so &quot;blah&quot; around here.)  In the past year we were in financial <br/>
straits, so I was vigilantly and ridiculously frugal.  So I&#39;m trying to <br/>
relax and fix that.<br/>
<br/>
And I still think schoolishly and remedially sometimes.  I was reading a <br/>
kids&#39; magazine with ads for other mags like Calliope and others.  I <br/>
looked at the American History magazine and thought &quot;Nah, James already <br/>
knows a lot about American History.&quot;  And then I was attracted to the <br/>
kids magazine about World History, but wondered if it would be a waste <br/>
of money because &quot;he might never get interested in World History&quot;.  Then <br/>
I kind of smacked myself in the forehead because I had leaned towards <br/>
the magazine that would fill in his &quot;deficiency&quot; (World History) and <br/>
ignored the one that fit better with his actual interest, American <br/>
History.  (He loved Liberty&#39;s Kids and likes to hear narratives about <br/>
WWII, esp. the battle of Midway.)<br/>

PS  If I ever get to an unschooling conference with my husband, I&#39;m <br/>
going to persuade him to re-enact the battle of Midway in the hotel <br/>
swimming pool with Cuisenaire rods.  (or some floating facsimile).  You <br/>
don&#39;t want to miss that!</div>

Well consider the not-so-long-ago &quot;respect for women&quot; that kept girls in the <br/>
house or with an adult female chaperone at all times, kept wives home unless <br/>
they were out with a husband.  (Wait...that&#39;s still going on in a lot of <br/>
families now, and a lot of those are homeschooling families.   :-/  )<br/>
<br/>
And in other cultures respect for women is keeping them draped and veiled and <br/>
not speaking to any men outside their own families.  Respect for women keeps <br/>
them from working and having jobs.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, the justifications for those things are that women are special, and <br/>
fragile, and should be protected.<br/>
