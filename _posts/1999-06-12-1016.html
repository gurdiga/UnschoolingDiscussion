are best friends and playmates.  This family and  closeness and special<br/>
sibling relationship is one of the benefits of unschooling, for me.  We<br/>
interact mostly with family and close friends.  But, from time to time,<br/>
they make &quot;playdates&quot; with 1 of their friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525749555"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If a child is making her own learning<br/>
&gt; experience, I don&#39;t care if she uses curriculum or not, though I<br/>
&gt; have yet to meet an elementary age child who would choose<br/>
&gt; curriculum if given the choice. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree wholeheartedly with this statement.  Wanted to let you know that<br/>
both of my children have chosen workbooks from time to time.  I do not<br/>
have a curriculum though, they occasionally like to sit and do exercises<br/>
in their workbooks and have Mom guide them.  Sometimes my kids have even<br/>
wanted to &quot;play&quot; school, where I am the teacher and they the students,<br/>
and somehow they had the notion this is what &quot;homeschooling&quot; was.  Since<br/>
it was what they wanted, we did do this once or twice.  I had a little<br/>
chalkboard and I assinged a picture or some alphabet to my at the time<br/>
5yr.old, or once I taught my 7 yr.old the concept of odd and even<br/>
numbers on the board, but it was definately &quot;child led learning&quot;, he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have learned it if he wasn&#39;t interested.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know,  I tried to answer this and it got really wordy, and I&#39;m still not <br/>
sure I answered the question.  I don&#39;t know if there are special issues, <br/>
because we&#39;ve never had more than one child, so I don&#39;t have anything to <br/>
compare to.<br/>
<br/>
All I know is, that my son manages to keep himself busy, and rarely asks to <br/>
have friends over.  He thrilled when they do come over, or we go someplace <br/>
for a visit, but he is so used to being on his own, that I honestly don&#39;t <br/>
think it occurs to him.  We belong to a support group that meets at least one <br/>
time a week, and often I try to wrangle some other &quot;kid time&quot; for him during <br/>
the week, but it doesn&#39;t always happen.  Unfortunely, we live about 40 miles <br/>
away from our best friends, if they lived across the street, I think our <br/>
lives would be considerably different.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>that would be me. and yes there are. the boredom and he talks about. but he<br/>
usually finds something to do or i help. We have lots fo friends over and<br/>
we do lots of stuff with others. we also play alot of games. which i find<br/>
is unschooling at its finest. I dont have any problems with it.<br/>
