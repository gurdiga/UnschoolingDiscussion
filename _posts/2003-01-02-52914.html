<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634404278">Ever since you decided to give Ned Vare the boot from the unschooling list, <br/>
I&#39;ve been disenchanted with the list. It&#39;s not that I was particularly wild <br/>
about all of his posts. It&#39;s just that the whole philosophy of <br/>
open-mindedness that I thought must naturally be part and parcel of <br/>
unschooling, runs against censorship. In rare instances where a poster might <br/>
be particularly lewd, bigoted, or hateful I might understand censorship. But <br/>
I believe Ned&#39;s (and there are probably other unfortunates who have run <br/>
against the popular sentiment of the powers that be at unschooling.com, and <br/>
been booted) only offense was to have an agenda and opinions that ran against <br/>
the popular grain. I was insulted and incensed that I was not given the <br/>
option to read or to delete his posts myself. I seek out forums such as <br/>
unschooling.com because I often discover and either change or reinforce my <br/>
beliefs and way of thinking by involving myself in provocative artistic, <br/>
intellectual or emotional discourse. Often, those who upset me, and push me, <br/>
force me out of a complacent mindset and position me to learn in ways that <br/>
neither they nor I can have imagined. Spoonfeeding is for babies. Removing <br/>
the antagonistic people from your list (if you continue to do so) will surely <br/>
make the list and what you stand for irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Nick is still on HEM-Unschooling<br/>
(another HEM-sponsored unschooling list) <br/>
and I think still on the politics list that was spun off this one for that <br/>
purpose.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ned&#39;s offense was to insist on badmouthing schools, which he just did again <br/>
this week (inappropriately, to someone whose kids have never even BEEN in <br/>
school).  If you really like that stuff he&#39;s still on an HEM list, and still <br/>
pushing phonics and all...<br/>

Who is this Ned Vare? ( the same person as the &quot;Nick&quot; that Sandra <br/>
mentioned?)  What list did he get booted from?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116570817">Hi, I thought I would introduce myself. I just joined<br/>
yesterday. My name is Annette. I am married to my<br/>
wonderful husband and father to our children Don for<br/>
the past 18 years. Our kids are 16 yo Ian, 14 yo<br/>
Hannah, 10 year old Molly and 22 month old Laurel. I<br/>
am a long time home schooler with this being my 11th<br/>
year. <br/>
<br/>
My two oldest kids chose to try school out. My son was<br/>
there for 3 years from 8th grade though his sophomore<br/>
year. He is now back home and working toward early<br/>
graduation at the end of this year. <br/>
<br/>
Hannah (my 14 yo) went to school in the 6th grade and<br/>
has continued on there. She is in a wonderful school<br/>
(as far as public schools go) out in the country that<br/>
does a lot of hands on, interesting, living educating<br/>
of the children there. <br/>
<br/>
Molly (my 10 yo) is severely (diagnosed) dyslexic.<br/>
That has been a long road for the both of us. She is a<br/>
wonderful child, with a brilliant, creative mind. She<br/>
loves art of all types and spends as much time as she<br/>
can squeeze out of each day either painting, drawing,<br/>
or sculpting. She also loves sports and plays on<br/>
several rec league teams throughout the year. She was<br/>
a team gymnast for awhile, but opted out when the goal<br/>
of perfection became more of a pressure than fun. <br/>
<br/>
Laurel just bobs along hanging out with all of us at<br/>
various times. She keeps life full of fun. It is so<br/>
wonderful having a little one in the house again. Will<br/>
I ever get my fill of babies and toddlers?! I think we<br/>
are at the point now where we will have to wait for<br/>
grandkids if we want any more babies running through<br/>
our house. :o) But you never know!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to reading everyone&#39;s posts and getting<br/>
to know all of you to some degree. I understand this<br/>
is a large, high volume, list. I hope I can keep up!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and peace upon this New Year for us all.<br/>
  Annette<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry you see it that way. It wasn&#39;t a lightly made decision.<br/>
<br/>
What it boils down to is Ned generated way too much mail (including<br/>
responses to him) on a topic (homeschooling freedoms) that wasn&#39;t what<br/>
people had signed on to this list to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
If people wanted to read about it as much as Ned wanted to write about it,<br/>
there would be a lot more people on his list. I&#39;ll post it again, if anyone<br/>
is interested:<br/>
<br/>
HomeschoolFreedom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>
<br/>
Ned posts there occasionally but I think he&#39;s most active on NHEN&#39;s<br/>
political action list. (I&#39;m not sure of the name. Check at<br/>
http://www.nhen.org)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, HEM just started a new list for anyone interested in the politics of<br/>
homeschooling:<br/>
