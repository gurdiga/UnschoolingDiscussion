<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374398482"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I find your use of words here rather difficult to grasp. Its one thing to <br/>
&gt;&gt;tear apart a subject, and another to tear apart ones skills as a parent.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay. Perhaps the phrase tear apart, even referring to an idea, is making <br/>
you uncomfortable. That&#39;s not my intent. How about discuss, debate, ponder, <br/>
revisit, re-evaluate an idea? And I&#39;ll state again, I was NOT talking about <br/>
anyone&#39;s skills as a parent. Really. I will be the first one to lay my <br/>
parenting skills bare to show what I have learned and still need to learn. I <br/>
have no need or desire to tear apart anyone.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If you are the Mary, that Teresa has written about. Than I will shall let <br/>
&gt;&gt;this die out right here and now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL! I have no idea if I&#39;m &quot;the Mary that Teresa has written about.&quot; What an <br/>
interesting comment to make.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And as a member of this group, I will respond when I so chose.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
