<div id="ygrps-yiv-555328672">I have a friend who&#39;s not online and has four kids.   The oldest has turned <br/>
eight.   She&#39;s near Pe Ell.   I&#39;ve known the mom since she was a teenager in <br/>
Santa Fe; she used to take Kirby and Marty swimming when they were toddlers.   <br/>
<br/>
If anyone on the list has suggestions for an answer to this, please write to <br/>
me on the side, SandraDodd @ aol.com<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...WA regs about homeschooling.   Maia is eight now.   Can you point me in <br/>
the right direction, or can I just keep ignoring it?   I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;d like to   let her know is how risky &quot;just ignoring it&quot; is for <br/>
her.   They don&#39;t live right in town, the parents are together, all children <br/>
are their own, her mom thinks it&#39;s great that she didn&#39;t send the kids to <br/>
school, and the kids haven&#39;t been to school.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure each area of the state is different, Sandra,<br/>
but I am in Washington and don&#39;t report, and I know<br/>
others here who don&#39;t report, either--and I&#39;ve never<br/>
known anyone to have a problem with it.  Especially<br/>
with little kids, it&#39;s always easy to say &quot;Oh, yeah, I<br/>
just forgot....sorry!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard there is an unschooling-friendly<br/>
place in Spokane that many people use for<br/>
&quot;evaluations&quot; that are mostly painless, from what I<br/>
understand...<br/>

<br/>
Washington state public schools have developed programs through the Alternative Education statutes.  These are called ALE - Alternative Learning Experience.  The students enrolled are considered Full-Time Public School Students and are required to follow the rules of the program.  The child&#39;s education is planned in consultation with a school district employee.<br/>
<br/>
When a child participates in the ALE program, his/her records are the property of the state.  You can be sure that these programs require testing!  Plus, it is one day per week for the school year, not just &quot;one day&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Under Washington state&#39;s Home-Based Instruction  statutes, (aka homeschooling) the results of the annual test/assessment are for the parent&#39;s use.  We are not required to share the results with anybody.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>FALSE.  Annual testing OR assessment is required.  I do a mail order assessment through www.familylearning.org and it is relatively painless ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just too wimpy to stop following the law.  It really is painless to fill out a form with the school district that has only my child&#39;s name and age and states that I am responsible for their education.  The annual assessment is a bit of a burden, primarily because I have to pay to get the required official signature on it.  My kids do not participate in the assessement.  It is something I write, not something they have to do.<br/>
<br/>
It is very easy to unschool in Washington state, whether you follow the law or not.  The law gives the parent total responsibility over methods, timing, philosophy, and curriculum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224235681">I think it&#39;s dangerous for any homeschoolers to ignore their state<br/>
laws, as it jeopardizes not only the individual family, but the rest<br/>
of us, as well.  <br/>
<br/>
WA is an easy state for unschooler compliance (declare annually; test<br/>
or assess annually).  She could, as well, jump the state line, move to<br/>
ID, and have no compliance issues at all.<br/>
<br/>
Non-compliance with state law risks both the children being placed in<br/>
public school, and the children being placed in foster care.  It&#39;s<br/>
simply not worth it.<br/>
