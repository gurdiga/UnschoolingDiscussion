LOL!! Sorry.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Any suggestions for playdoh in the carpet?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t had to deal with that one......yet. My kids do playdoh in the dining <br/>
room and it&#39;s all tiled.<br/>
Have you tried alcohol with that too? I&#39;ve never had luck with sticky stuff <br/>
and ice, it takes off some but never all of what I&#39;m trying to remove. Maybe <br/>
try dry cleaning solvent too, that might work.<br/>

Oh oh, (blushing) I&#39;ve never used the stuff. I just thought maybe the <br/>
grocery store or Target would have it. Sorry.<br/>

    Thanks. And it&#39;s ok Mary, no reason to be embarrassed. I&#39;ve been looking<br/>
on and off for years. I hadn&#39;t been looking for anything dry. I was looking<br/>
for a liquid. Funny how you get something stuck in your head that it should<br/>
be like. :-)<br/>
