<div id="ygrps-yiv-348987191">I&#39;m not convinced one can unschool &quot;to a point&quot;.  Saying you &quot;want to be<br/>
sure&quot; the children learn some basics implies that you don&#39;t believe they<br/>
will learn on their own.  Is it fear driving this need &quot;to teach&quot; certain<br/>
basics.<br/>
I think unschooling is a process fro most parents, too.  I know I went to<br/>
school for many years....it&#39;s a challenge to get all the way out-of the-box.<br/>
That is,  it can be difficult to let go of the idea that all that &quot;teaching&quot;<br/>
doesn&#39;t really work.  Have you read Learning All The Time,  How Children<br/>
Fail,  any John Holt?<br/>

I like the concept of unschooling and do it to a point, but still want to<br/>
be sure my kids learn some basics.<br/>

emotional I think. Also melty like you say. I can tell when it is <br/>
happening,dh has a tougher time identifying this and feels she is doing it on <br/>
purpose. I am trying to show him the light. :o) 5 reminds me of 3.<br/>
