<div id="ygrps-yiv-878779050">I have had a FAS baby in foster care several times and a drug baby once, <br/>
still have the drug baby.  (I still have the drug baby - he is 10 yo).  It is <br/>
a great challenge, stressful, time consuming, frustrating, etc., but the <br/>
reward of helping a little life off to a good start in spite of the problems <br/>
involved is worth every minute of it to me.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how it goes.  I will be glad to give whatever support I can.  I <br/>
am also a sped teacher and have had numerous FAS  children, all the way from <br/>
3 yo to 15 yo.  I will be glad to share whatever I can.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i speak as an adoptive parent who has researched this a little prior to our <br/>
adoption of a child from russia - i am not a doctor, and don&#39;t play one on <br/>
tv.  but, it is my understanding that fas has quite a wide range of <br/>
behaviours/symptons depending on the severity of the damage done.  it can <br/>
range from some very basic attention deficit type problems all the way up to <br/>
mental retardation.  in the infant stage it may resemble something like a <br/>
colicky baby all the way up to an infant who is pretty much unresponsive to <br/>
most stimuli.  i would think, that while it may be more difficult than a <br/>
perfectly healthy infant, the real difficulty with fas children is when they <br/>
actually start moving.  i have heard stories of kids being unable to be left <br/>
at home alone in the teen years, because they were unable to do basic things <br/>
like remember to turn of the water, stove, etc.  i hope this helps.  i admire <br/>
your ability to be a foster parent!  <br/>
