<div id="ygrps-yiv-529099603">My son (12 1/2) is interested in a computer program to help him learn <br/>
Spanish.  We tried a couple from the library, but they were boring.  Does <br/>
anyone know of a good computer program that might interest him?<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

Spain or Latin America.  The more the language feels familiar to him, the<br/>
easier it will be to actually speak it at some point.  There might be TV<br/>
shows in Spanish where you live as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007133405">My girls and I really enjoy the Rosetta Stone program.  You learn a lot<br/>
just playing it for fun.  Billy has it at fun books.  For $20 you can<br/>
get the first 22 or so lessons and see if you like it.<br/>

the website of the designers of Rosetta Stone. It should be easy to find<br/>
with Google.<br/>
