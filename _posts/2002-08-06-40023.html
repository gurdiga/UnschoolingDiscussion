Education is the strange, intimidating, awe inspiring process of discovering<br/>
how much we don&#39;t know. The more we learn, the more we realize how little we<br/>
know of what there is. It&#39;s what makes some say, I don&#39;t know whether to<br/>
laugh or cry.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the good news: Two of the most brilliant people ever to live,<br/>
Einstein and Richard Feynman, both were known for their beliefs that living<br/>
was playing. To them, their brilliance and humanity came from their ability<br/>
to play with ideas and knowledge. Unschooling just might mean something<br/>
similar -- the ability to play, and not to take seriously the words and/or<br/>
methods of pedagogy.<br/>
