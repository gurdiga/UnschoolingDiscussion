<div id="ygrps-yiv-320943">Hey all, jacli here :)<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  I have to be honest here.  I started<br/>
babysitting my<br/>
little brother when I was 8.  Now maybe it is different now<br/>
than in<br/>
the late 70s but when I was little most everybody was a<br/>
babysitting <br/>
pro by the time they hit 11 or 12.  <br/>
I really think it is a matter of case by case.  You have to<br/>
know your <br/>
child and their level of maturity.  I have met very mature<br/>
10 year olds and<br/>
incredibly immature 30 year olds.  <br/>
<br/>
At the time same time I think that if you feel very<br/>
strongly that your neighbor<br/>
is behaving irresponsibly toward his children and<br/>
abandoning them why <br/>
not confront him?  It maybe that you are right but it may<br/>
also be that if you<br/>
confront him with your perceptions he may adjust his.<br/>
Also, while I&#39;m sure the <br/>
little boy you spoke with is a nice kid, he is just that.<br/>
He may not have all the facts or he may have them but<br/>
simply not have shared them with you.<br/>
<br/>
Well, hope this helps :)  take care, Jacli<br/>

&lt;Hey everybody,<br/>
&lt;I&#39;m fuming here and need to get some perspective on this<br/>
situation before I<br/>
&lt;make a decsion... My dd later informed me that just<br/>
yesterday<br/>
&lt;the guy dropped both boys off on our street while he ran a<br/>
few errands.   He<br/>
&lt;did not ask anyone to supervise his children or inform<br/>
anyone that he was<br/>
&lt;not home....&gt;</div>
