&gt; I&#39;d love to hear your success stories in allowing your children to unfold<br/>
&gt; and trusing that they will eventually enjoy or perhaps have an inkling of<br/>
&gt; interest in things like reading and figuring things out with numbers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son is an intelligent, sweet boy who has grown up being read to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nightly.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He adores being read to, he just has not interest in reading.  He also is<br/>
&gt; not very skilled - reads very, very slowly without any degree of fluency.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m fighting the urge within myself to &#39;go to the authorities&#39; and have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>him<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &#39;tested&#39;, etc.  I&#39;m trying to remind myself that he is unique and he will<br/>
&gt; bloom in his own time, but I need some support!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t exactly a success story, but I can tell you what happened when I<br/>
gave in to those fears about my son at almost 12 and forced daily phonics<br/>
practice on him.  He did learn to read, but he also learned to dislike<br/>
reading.  He even stopped letting me read to him.<br/>
<br/>
Chin up.  He&#39;ll do it.<br/>
