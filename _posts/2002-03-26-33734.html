<div id="ygrps-yiv-733835116">Just to give an update, there are atleast 5 families planning to come <br/>
this day.  <br/>
If you&#39;re near the area and want to meet other unschoolers, come on <br/>
out!<br/>
I&#39;m hoping for warm and sunny that day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71727908">Oh,  how I wish it were possible for us!!  I am in a real r-u-t with lack of<br/>
unschooling support.  I have persevered this far (&quot;school year&quot;)  with a<br/>
&#39;field trip&#39;  and &#39;gym class&#39; group.....it&#39;s more wearing than I expected -<br/>
the constant discussions of curriculum.  Why taching our children Latin is<br/>
*essential* (though none of the moms took it save one with 2 yrs in high<br/>
school)!    And the askance looks when I respond to questions about our<br/>
curriculum usage.  ( I usually say something along the lines.....we don&#39;t<br/>
use a specific curriculum,  we draw from a large variety of resources.)  Of<br/>
course,  the fact that my 10 yr old is a late reader has clinched for them<br/>
that my lack of specific curriculum causes failure.<br/>
Susan,    venting over for the day!!!<br/>
