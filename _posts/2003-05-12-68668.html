non-homeschool<br/>

Interesting that this should come up now.  My husband and I have been<br/>
discussing this at length for a while now.  We&#39;ve recently lost a bunch<br/>
of friends (ok, we know where some of them are, it&#39;s just when we go<br/>
there there&#39;s some one else living there - they&#39;ve moved).  Two families<br/>
have moved far away, one family has dissolved in a sea of drugs and<br/>
fighting, one has left us because of our family/schooling choices (she<br/>
was a friend from high school, I&#39;d known her for over 25 years), and our<br/>
homeschooling group is disintegrating due to lack of interest and who<br/>
knows what else.<br/>
<br/>
The long term friendship has been the hardest for me, I thought it would<br/>
always be there.<br/>
<br/>
The homeschooling group is also hard.  Most aren&#39;t interested in getting<br/>
together anymore, every time a new family shows up they are turned off<br/>
by the group and it&#39;s cliqueishness (is that a word?) and they leave<br/>
us.  It&#39;s the only group in town, except for the Christian group and<br/>
they make you sign a statement of faith form before joining, so that&#39;s<br/>
out for us.<br/>
<br/>
So here we are, losing our friends, lost our homeschooling group (I&#39;m<br/>
tired of fighting for it, I feel like I&#39;m the only one), and struggling<br/>
to find new friends.  We lost our non homeschool friends a long time<br/>
ago, when their children started school.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel I am doing my kids a disservice by not sending them to<br/>
school, but then I slap myself on the head and our life goes on<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This is a little disjointed, sorry for that.  I just wanted to say that<br/>
it&#39;s happening here too.  And I&#39;m hoping that this summer brings new<br/>
friends for my kids to play with.<br/>
