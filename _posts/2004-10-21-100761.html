<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358120539">The peak of the Orionid meteor shower is tonight (I think) so if your sky<br/>
is clear, have a look.   <br/>
Next Wednesday is a total lunar eclipse beginning 7:14pm Mountain time. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been laying on the trampoline under a pile of blankets looking for<br/>
shooting stars.   Last night was very cold so we didn&#39;t say out long and<br/>
the sky was patchy with clouds so we weren&#39;t getting great views.  But<br/>
this morning we were up at four and it was foggy and spooky but just over<br/>
head the a little circle of sky was clear and bright and we saw three<br/>
shooting stars per minute.   It was lovely! <br/>
<br/>
We also heard a small? group of cranes flying over and the swans have<br/>
been straggling past for the last week.  If you&#39;re in the flyway and your<br/>
eyes are skyward, make sure your mouths are closed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
