<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710463346">Ok, Ok, so a lot of us seem to have the same problem here, hmmmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don&#39;t have to worry about waking my husband up, he would put a <br/>
hurtin&#39; on me!  I don&#39;t have to worry about having to jump in the sack with <br/>
him when he turns in, he doesn&#39;t usually ask me to.  So, I have those two <br/>
problems licked.  Of course, I am not the kind of woman who will wait on him <br/>
hand and foot either, so maybe he grown to accept that I am going to do what <br/>
I am going to do.  It does help that he is a loner type of guy, and he likes <br/>
to sleep... a lot if he can help it.  That gives me some slack when I need <br/>
it, which is a lot, because I am extremely independent.  So, if he is just <br/>
looking for me to sit or lie next to him out of habit, I am not playing <br/>
along.  That is when I feel like furniture.  And since I have started working <br/>
again, I don&#39;t feel like furniture as much anymore :o)  <br/>
<br/>
He will just throw some attitude around till I corner him and make him spill <br/>
his guts.  Then I will let him know how selfish he is and let him know how <br/>
much I love him!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, families are complex things.  It is hard to get everything right all of <br/>
the time, or even part of the time.  But I think homeschooling does put an <br/>
interesting, more complex twist on things.  Those of us at home with the <br/>
kiddies can get pretty overwhelmed by around 7:00 Pm.  we have NO time to <br/>
ourselves all day, not even to go potty!!!!  We do ache for time to de-stress <br/>
and absorb what our day has brought us...anticipating the next and things we <br/>
need to address or change.  Things we need to get done.  Growth phases of the <br/>
kids to figure out and very high levels of patience to maintain.  And who are <br/>
we in all of this?  Are we only our children or our spouses?  Or do we have <br/>
an identity and interests unique to ourselves?  I don&#39;t think I gave up being <br/>
an individual and a person when I got married and had children... I don&#39;t <br/>
think I ever agreed to totally eliminate any sense of self.  Though I have <br/>
been the first to sacrifice my needs and wants in support of my spouse and <br/>
children.  There are times when that is just not feasable or warranted.<br/>
<br/>
No solutions here.  I have no answers.  Just keep honestly communicating.  It <br/>
is nothing to lose a marriage over.  But you can&#39;t lose your own identity for <br/>
your marriage either.  If your mate loves and respects you, they will allow <br/>
you your space and come up with other ways to make time together.  I only <br/>
know to respond in defense when I feel myself slipping away and I feel as <br/>
though I can&#39;t identify myself.  Like someone said, &quot;if Mama aint happy, aint <br/>
no body happy!&quot;.  And that is true in my house.  dad got a call at work today <br/>
about his selfish, defiant son from his frantic, I have had it, wife.  <br/>
Needless to say a family conference was held when he got home!  And I let <br/>
them all have it!  We had the &quot;more joy in giving than receiving <br/>
conversation&quot; as I glared at my hubby &lt;g&gt;.  And more of the &quot;stop taking <br/>
advantage my patience and commitment to you&quot; and &quot;do you see the socks on the <br/>
floor or dirty dishes in the sink, who you leavin&#39; em for????&quot;  Younger Ds of <br/>
course starts having to go the bathroom in fear of the pending nothing.  But <br/>
it generally takes mom having a hairy kiniption fit to get the guys <br/>
motivated.  And that saddens me greatly.  Makes me wonder if I have any value <br/>
other than to be taken advantage of and be manipulated into being a household <br/>
servant.  When I work, and am doing things publically for work, I get a lot <br/>
of credit and encouragement and thanks for the work I do.  But I wish I got <br/>
more of that at home.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I would say we as parents, definitely have to take our time to heal <br/>
ourselves, reflect, look forward, and just be ourselves ... if we can <br/>
remember who we are.  I am going to set up date night with hubby once a <br/>
week...that is probably enough for him &lt;g&gt;.  I do enjoy talking with him and <br/>
spending time with him.  I am sure we can commit to carving out a notch of <br/>
time everyday while I am preparing dinner or something like that.  If we are <br/>
committed to each other, we will make it work.  Not me making it work for <br/>
him.  Us making it work for each other.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that helps is that I am an eternal optimist and know there is <br/>
indeed a solution to every problem I face.  Though it may not manifest itself <br/>
to me at that moment, in due time and with patience, it will work itself out. <br/>
 So I needn&#39;t freak out nealry as much as I used to.  I only need to get <br/>
online with this list, visit a friend, go shopping, talk to my mom, or just <br/>
spend time in the tub with my candles and a bottle of Zima once in a great <br/>
while &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have to go back to work and get something accomplished or I will be <br/>
spending more time with my hubby than I think, hahaha.  A grantwriter who <br/>
writes no grants is of no good use ... wouldn&#39;t ya say?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165745360">Kim and everyone that was so kind in addressing my discussion,<br/>
     I waited until my husband came home from work, then I &quot;invited&quot; him to <br/>
go out with me tonight, so we could talk.  I am not sure that we fixed <br/>
everything in one night, but we at least had a good conversation.  <br/>
     I discovered tonight, that my husband has always had these feelings <br/>
about &quot;early risers&quot; and &quot;late risers&quot;.  He just figured that as I &quot;matured&quot; <br/>
that I would become more &quot;normal &quot;.  We discussed this in length, and I <br/>
discovered that he really thought that almost everyone was like him.  He <br/>
figured that there was just a very small minority that actually liked staying <br/>
up late, sleeping late, and working 2nd or 3rd shift if they had to work out <br/>
of the home.  He also tends to think that those who choose to live that type <br/>
of lifestyle are lazy!  Well, I went through all the different types of <br/>
workers that work 2nd or 3rd (including doctors, nurses, firemen, emergency <br/>
team personnel, policeman, factory workers, restaurant workers, etc).  He <br/>
said that these people only work that shift because they &quot;have&quot; to, that they <br/>
can&#39;t find another 1st shift job that pays as well and that when they do, <br/>
they would become part of the majority that works 1st shift!  I had to <br/>
clarify to him, that this &quot;idea&quot; of his wasn&#39;t necessarily true.  I think <br/>
that he finally agreed &quot;a little&quot;, but he hasn&#39;t really changed his mind <br/>
about it.  He did say that he doesn&#39;t care if we all stay up late, if we <br/>
really keep quiet so that he can get some sleep before work.  Of course, I <br/>
agreed upon this!  This is what I have been trying to do all along!<br/>
     Unfortunately, he added on the end of the conversation, that we should <br/>
still get up at a &quot;reasonable&quot; hour.  When I asked him what this was, he <br/>
mentioned between 7:00 am and 8:00 am.  Of course, this seemed to begin the <br/>
whole conversation all over again, so I almost felt like I had gotten <br/>
absolutely nowhere!!!  Anyway, we talked all over again, how the words <br/>
&quot;reasonable hour&quot; means different things to different people.  Anyway, I did <br/>
stress that as long as we accomplished everything in our day, that someone <br/>
that rises and goes to bed early does, that is shouldn&#39;t matter.  He did <br/>
agree to this, but he still things people like me are weird!  :)  Oh well, I <br/>
couldn&#39;t quite deny that, since I probably am!  Ha ha.<br/>
     We also discussed his temper.  He said that he hadn&#39;t realized that he <br/>
had been yelling like that, but that he hadn&#39;t gotten used to the earlier <br/>
hours of his new job yet, and that he has been feeling really tired in the <br/>
morning.  He said that he sometimes felt like he was fighting off sleep on <br/>
the way to work!  I told him that he needed to let me and the kids know that, <br/>
so we could let him go to bed even earlier, and we could be quiet alot <br/>
earlier in the evening.<br/>
     I was very happy with the turnout of our discussion tonight.  I know <br/>
that we will still probably have to &quot;work&quot; at it and adapt to each others <br/>
schedule, but at least we finally know where the other person stands.  I <br/>
wasn&#39;t aware that he thought that he could change me (after 19 years) and I <br/>
imagine that he is a little dissapointed to find out that I probably won&#39;t <br/>
change.  However, we did agree to compromise at times, and to be sensitive to <br/>
how the other person feels about things.  We also agreed to try and accept <br/>
those things about each other that are so different.  <br/>
     I know that this doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t ever be any more problems, but <br/>
I do feel like we are back to communicating and getting along.  Tonight was <br/>
so much better!  The kids are playing in a different bedroom (he said that <br/>
even when they were quiet, in the bedroom above ours, he could still hear <br/>
every tiny noise.  He said that that was what was keeping him up at nights), <br/>
so that they don&#39;t keep their dad awake.  He hasn&#39;t yelled or came out of the <br/>
bedroom even once tonight, so so far, so good!   Thanks for all the advice <br/>
and shared woes!<br/>

WooHoo!  I am so happy for you.  Communication is the best thing in the <br/>
world.  We find that we didn&#39;t even know what was right before our eyes.  <br/>
Here you all thought you were being so quiet and you were upset because you <br/>
had all been doing so much to keep quiet, yet, your husband could hear <br/>
everything upstairs.  He thought you knew that and didn&#39;t care.  Round and <br/>
Round it goes, doesn&#39;t stop until we TALK!  I think we all have to just keep <br/>
reminding ourselves of that, it is very easy to loose sight of.  <br/>

I have to commend you, it takes courage to really sit down and confront <br/>
issues, so, congrats , you go girl!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this list a few days ago, and thought I would chime in since I<br/>
had this same problem with my youngest son.  Long afternoon naps early<br/>
riser.. the only thing that worked with him was getting older (sorry!  I<br/>
know that is probably NOT what you want to hear!)  Once he got a little<br/>
older (I think by about 3 or 3 1/2) he quit taking naps and ended up<br/>
sleeping later in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s frustrating for everyone, but it is also likely to change by itself.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

     Hey, what a great idea!   I really think it might work, if I show him <br/>
people that he actually admires.  I am going to tell him the story about <br/>
Winston Churchill, and then I am going to look up some more people.  That is <br/>
such a coooolllll idea!<br/>
     I am not sure what to tell you to do about your son.  My kids were <br/>
always wanting to stay up late with mom and dad.  It was always such a <br/>
struggle to get them to bed at night, that we would finally give in and let <br/>
them stay up with us (except for when they were school age and in public <br/>
school----boy, I&#39;m glad we&#39;re not going that route any more!).  When we <br/>
started letting them stay up until 10:00 or 11:00 at night, they went to <br/>
sleep quicker and slept much later in the morning.  As a matter of fact, my <br/>
daughter did this before she turned a year old and scared me half to death!  <br/>
I came awake and shook her (gently but very frightened!) as she lay next to <br/>
me!  She was so deeply asleep that she barely seemed to be breathing, and <br/>
here it was 10:00 in the morning and she hadn&#39;t woke me up yet!  Of course, I <br/>
may have slept through her last nursing since she generally nursed on & off <br/>
all night, while we both slept!   LOL<br/>

the hall outside of his door to help with the noise? my husband works four<br/>
days of day shift, followed  by four days offf and then four days of night<br/>
shift! so he has gone to putting the fan in the room or turning on the<br/>
airconditioner to help block the noise and it really helps alot!!! also you<br/>
should probably do like I did with my husband who  sounds an awful lot like<br/>
mine!  look him in the face and explain to him that he is who he is and you<br/>
will never be him not now not ever, you are you and he will never be you no<br/>
matter how hard you try to make him you  it won&#39;t happen so he needs to stop<br/>
trying to turn you and your family into him!!!! it helps for a while but<br/>
they need reminding frequently that differences in people are what make the<br/>
world so wonderful if we were all the same we would have to kill one<br/>
another!!!!<br/>

8:30!! not one minute later! he would just walk in look at us and say see ya<br/>
I&#39;m going to bed! even if we ate dinner late and were still at the table, he<br/>
would get frantic about not going to bed on his time table!! ( he is alot<br/>

will sit in her room working on math, english, reading whatever just hanging<br/>
out! and this makes my husband nuts, he thinks they should all be in bed by<br/>
8:00 so we have the night alone, which I don&#39;t understand anyway because he<br/>
never even sits down, hes always all over the house working on projects???<br/>

the kids make while he&#39;s trying to sleep! Also, you could get him those <br/>
earplugs that are made out of rubber or foam or something. They really work. <br/>
In MY house, it&#39;s my 14 yo dd who complains about the noise we make in the <br/>
morning--and I&#39;m not talking about EARLY morning, either! I&#39;m talking 9:00 <br/>
am! We just try to ignore her tirades, though! I feel sorry for her future <br/>

&lt;&lt; Tami, have you tried a noise machine or a simple box fan in his room or in<br/>
 the hall outside of his door to help with the noise? &gt;&gt;<br/>
I am also one that can verify that after a few nights of the fan, you do not <br/>
hear a thing! When I left my first husband, I slept very lightly, and had <br/>
nothing on. He is a stalker, etc. and I wanted to be sure that I could hear <br/>
EVERYTHING. (He stole our children from my college, and other various things <br/>
happened) <br/>
    When I remarried, my husband could not sleep without background noise, <br/>
grrr. After a few sleepless nights, my mind was trying to search out the <br/>
children, I finally crashed, and now can sleep with the cd player (which is <br/>
on random, making a horrible shuffling noise) and the fan. I do not hear the <br/>
children until they want something! Normally FOOD...<br/>
The fan is an exellent idea. and you can still hear the alarm clock.<br/>

Not really...  it just gets smellier as the filter gets dirtier.  But, I&#39;m <br/>
the smoker in this family not the dh...  I smoke in the house, but not in the <br/>
bedrooms, just the common area.  Not to say that it doesn&#39;t smell like smoke <br/>
all over the house, but, I just don&#39;t light up in the bedroom.  You know my <br/>

 days of day shift, followed  by four days offf and then four days of night<br/>
 shift! so he has gone to putting the fan in the room or turning on the<br/>
 airconditioner to help block the noise and it really helps alot!!! also you<br/>
 should probably do like I did with my husband who  sounds an awful lot like<br/>
 mine!  look him in the face and explain to him that he is who he is and you<br/>
 will never be him not now not ever, &gt;&gt;<br/>

      That sounds like a good idea to try also.  I will have to run in by my <br/>
husband and see if he would mind putting a fan in the room to make noise.  <br/>
I&#39;ll see what he says.<br/>
      Yes, I have told him that I am not him and never will be.  You are <br/>

the next time my husband complains about the noise (when I am trying very <br/>

then I am going to act the exact same way and show him what he sounds like!  <br/>

I admit that I am pretty naive about stuff like that, but it sure seems like <br/>
there should be something out there for your protection.  It is horrible that <br/>
anyone should have to go through life with the fear of being stalked.  Thank <br/>

The laws on stalking are so nondescript. Police are usually defiant about <br/>
dealing with women in stalking situations, for women &quot;make up things, are so <br/>
overemotional, want to get back at the ex, and don&#39;t think before they <br/>
react&quot;. Believe me, when my exhusband went to my son&#39;s school and WALKED into <br/>
HIS classroom, these were some of the answers that I heard as to why I was <br/>
calling the police. It is something that police DO NOT want to deal with. I <br/>
called one night (around 7p, just afterdark) because I was having someone <br/>
knock on my back door, leave cute packages, and run. The packages contained <br/>
things such as my daughter&#39;s first birthday invite, my son&#39;s school homework, <br/>
my car registration... The police first said that they would be out when they <br/>
could come around, and when they got to my apt (after midnight), said many <br/>
things. That someone was going thru my trash (my car registration? Stacie&#39;s <br/>
birthday was 9 months previous), that since I lived in a poor section of <br/>
town, they could not say it was him, and that I should just get on with my <br/>
life and leave him alone. What!!! My ex was in criminal justice classes, and <br/>
when I had him arrested he was one semester away from academy. I am firm in <br/>
my belief that he knows what lines to walk, and exactly how to do it, because <br/>
criminal psychology was already studied. He knows what he is doing. I have <br/>
not told him that we are homeschooling. I am hoping that he will just think <br/>
htat the children are at another school, and give me some freedom for my <br/>
children. I have become a women&#39;s rights advocate, and I want to have women <br/>
know that it is possible for that real great guy that is just sonosey, and <br/>
does not want them to dress (or behave, whatever) a certian way, is the first <br/>
steps. My goal is to make women aware that men (and women) are out there, and <br/>
that these people will hurt you! <br/>
Sorry, I went off in my little world. I do that every now and again. <br/>
My children want lunch, I should feed them.<br/>

     That is quite all right.  You are entitled to do that after what you <br/>
have been through.<br/>
I guess I have really been naive, since I have never known anybody that had <br/>
to deal with something like that.  <br/>
     My best friends husband left her over a year ago.  They had been married <br/>
for about 10 years and had two kids.  Three years previously, he had suddenly <br/>
started acting really strange.  He had an affair and his behavior was very <br/>
&quot;odd&quot; in other ways.  He was arrested a few times for &quot;indecent behavior&quot; and <br/>
mouthing off at a policemen, and also for being drunk.  They finally found <br/>
out that he was manic depressive and put him on medication.<br/>
     The problem is that ever since highschool, her husband had been a &quot;con&quot; <br/>
and a &quot;manipulator&quot;.  She thought it was fun when they first met, but after <br/>
they had kids, she wanted him to grow up.  Well, when he went off his <br/>
medicine (for being manic) again, over a year ago, he started doing all those <br/>
&quot;weird&quot; things again.  He got arrested again a few times, then ended up in <br/>
the Physciatric Ward (he voluntarily went in).  During this time, he ran into <br/>
the girl that he had the affair with years earlier, and they started up <br/>
again.  He asked my friend for a divorce, then moved in with the other girl.<br/>
     Well, after he got back on the medicine, he asked for my friend to get <br/>
back with him (even though he was still living with the other girl, and had <br/>
even asked her to marry him).  My friend refused, saying that she and the <br/>
children couldn&#39;t live with his &quot;wild outbursts&quot; anymore.  (He gets very <br/>
violent and abusive when he&#39;s manic).<br/>
     Well, to make a long story short, he has married this other girl (who <br/>
had had a good job and has saved back alot of money-----poor girl, he is <br/>
taking her for as much as she has got!).  Now he is taking my friend to <br/>
court, to try to get the kids.  He has behaved very badly to my 17 year old <br/>
son while he was babysitting (kept calling every few minutes and yelling at <br/>
the kids, because he thought that he should have them not the <br/>
babysitter-----but because of his &quot;manic&quot; past, he isn&#39;t allowed to have them <br/>
without supervision).  Well, he has &quot;conned&quot; and &quot;manipulated&quot; enough people <br/>
into believing that there is NOTHING wrong with him, that my friend is a <br/>
lier, that she leaves the kids with no babysitter (my 17 year old son was <br/>
that babysitter, and he is almost 18), and that he is stable and a great <br/>
father.  The scary thing is, that it seems to be working!!!!  He is trying to <br/>
get out of paying child support, medical bills or anything else.  He is <br/>
constantly calling my friend (at work, at home----sometimes every 10 to 15 <br/>
minutes!, he even pages her when she is out somewhere!)  She is getting very <br/>
paranoid.  Although he isn&#39;t quite &quot;stalking&quot; her, he is driving her crazy, <br/>
and he isn&#39;t letting her live her own life, although he sure is going on with <br/>
his!!   I am beginning to get  a taste of what the law does in these cases, <br/>
as he seems to be getting all the breaks, and she is getting none!  Oh well, <br/>
we will see what happens on their court date.<br/>
     Thank you for telling me your story.  It has sure opened up my eyes!  I <br/>
sure hope that he leaves you alone after this!  Good luck.<br/>

Tell your friend to GET IT IN WRITING! This is so important with Friend of <br/>
the Court. She needs to start hitting him with harassment charges and she can <br/>
request that e has a psych evaluation before she allows him any visitation. I <br/>
have so much to say... First give her a hug, and tell her that you back her. <br/>
We do not like to hear it all the time, but boy does it feel good at two in <br/>
the morning after the 12th phone call from the ex. Feel free to give her my <br/>
email addy (if she can access email) and let her know that she needs to stand <br/>
firm. I do know how the courts will look at him, and then her, and then side <br/>
with him. It is so frustrating, and it makes you sooo mad to know that he is <br/>
pulling all the right strings. She just needs to be firm. I ended up getting <br/>
Privacy manager on my phone this month. It does not allow any unknown, out of <br/>
area, or blocked calls to come thru my phone. Tell her not to change her <br/>
beeper, phone, or anything. He will know that it gets to her, and keep <br/>
finding the new numbers anyhow. That is common of manipulators. Documentation <br/>
is so important. Tell her to screen the calls, and to ignore him. Do not <br/>
change messages. But change the route that she takes for work, school etc. <br/>
And the same with the children. Let someone know the new route, so that if <br/>
something happens, someone knows where they should be. It is so mind blowing <br/>
when you are going thru it, or knows someone in it. We actually taught my son <br/>
that he is to run to doors, and bang and force his way in if need be, to get <br/>
away from my ex. We gave him good houses to head for if he saw my ex, but was <br/>
not approached. Children know when something is not good. I hope and pray <br/>
that your friend will be ok, and that she makes the court see, and he gets <br/>
his just reward.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Tell your friend to GET IT IN WRITING! This is so important with Friend of <br/>
 the Court. She needs to start hitting him with harassment charges and she <br/>
can <br/>
 request that e has a psych evaluation before she allows him any visitation. <br/>
I <br/>
 have so much to say... First give her a hug, and tell her that you back her. <br/>
 We do not like to hear it all the time, but boy does it feel good at two in <br/>
 the morning after the 12th phone call from the ex. Feel free to give her my <br/>
 email addy (if she can access email) and let her know that she needs to <br/>
stand <br/>
 firm. I do know how the courts will look at him, and then her, and then side <br/>
 with him. It is so frustrating, and it makes you sooo mad to know that he is <br/>
 pulling all the right strings. She just needs to be firm. I ended up getting <br/>
 Privacy manager on my phone this month. It does not allow any unknown, out <br/>
of <br/>
 area, or blocked calls to come thru my phone. Tell her not to change her <br/>
 beeper, phone, or anything. He will know that it gets to her, and keep <br/>
 finding the new numbers anyhow. That is common of manipulators. <br/>
Documentation <br/>
 is so important. Tell her to screen the calls, and to ignore him. Do not <br/>
 change messages. But change the route that she takes for work, school etc. <br/>
 And the same with the children. Let someone know the new route, so that if <br/>
 something happens, someone knows where they should be. It is so mind blowing <br/>
 when you are going thru it, or knows someone in it. We actually taught my <br/>
son <br/>
 that he is to run to doors, and bang and force his way in if need be, to get <br/>
 away from my ex. We gave him good houses to head for if he saw my ex, but <br/>
was <br/>
 not approached. Children know when something is not good. I hope and pray <br/>
 that your friend will be ok, and that she makes the court see, and he gets <br/>
 his just reward. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stephanie,<br/>
     She has been keeping a log of everything that he says and does.  Her <br/>
lawyer has asked that I start doing the same (he kept calling me all the <br/>
time, when they first broke up, pretending to need someone to talk to; <br/>
however his conversations kept going to the subject of sex.  My friend said <br/>
that he had become &quot;fixated&quot; with me about a year before he left her.  She <br/>
was afraid that he was trying to get together with me.  I was very <br/>
embarrassed at the things he would say on the phone, so my husband took the <br/>
phone from me one night and told him to quit calling me.) since I have <br/>
started keeping her kids on the weekends.  She just began a new job where she <br/>
works from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for 15 hour shifts (from 3:00 pm the <br/>
previous day to 7:00 am the next morning, then she goes home and gets a few <br/>
hours of sleep and has to be back to work at 3:00 pm again.).  I have the <br/>
kids from Friday after school until she picks them up at 7:20 am Monday <br/>
morning to take them to school.  She took this new job because the pay will <br/>
be fantastic (she is a COTA----Certified Occupation Therapy Assistant) and <br/>
she has all week to spend with the kids.  Anyway her ex is really ticked, <br/>
because he thinks that he should have the kids while she works on weekends, <br/>
so he is causing a stink about it.  So now I also have to keep a log of every <br/>
time he calls here to talk to me or one of the kids.<br/>
    Thanks for telling me about not changing her number.  She had just <br/>
decided to try changing her pager number so that he can&#39;t keep paging her all <br/>
the time.  I will pass on what you said to her about that.<br/>
     Unfortunately she can&#39;t afford to buy a computer or get on the internet <br/>
(she just graduated from college in December, and she is just now getting a <br/>
good job.  Before she was only making $7.00 an hour, and her ex was not <br/>
giving her child support. (He was supposed to be, but our court system here <br/>
is really slow about going after the dads that are failing to pay).  They <br/>
just took her off of food stamps and free lunches for her kids at school.  <br/>
She is feeling like she is sinking right now, and it really bothers her to <br/>
watch her husband take off on vacations, buy a new computer and get on the <br/>
internet, go out and spend hundreds of dollars on CDs at Barnes & Nobles, and <br/>
buy the kids expensive presents every time she turns around.  She can barely <br/>
make ends meet, and she feels like there is no way that she can compete with <br/>
everything he keeps getting the kids.<br/>
However, even with all the presents, her kids really don&#39;t want to go see <br/>
their dad, because of the way he acts.  She has been very good with <br/>
visitation however (even though that means that she has to spend a few hours <br/>
in his presence also, since he only has visitation with her supervision).  <br/>
She always makes sure that he sees the kids at least twice a week, and <br/>
sometimes ever 3 or 4 times.  She is trying to give him the benefit of the <br/>
doubt through all of this (he claims that he has changed, and needs to be <br/>
given the chance to prove it) and not keep the kids from their father.  <br/>
However, with all the things he has pulled lately (like taking her back to <br/>
court to get custody of the kids, and then lying to people about her <br/>
reputation), it is really getting hard for her to keep it up.  Anyway, since <br/>
she doesn&#39;t have a computer hooked to the internet, I can&#39;t give her your <br/>
e-maid address. <br/>
I will pass on your messages though, and she can use mine if there is <br/>
anything she needs to talk to you about.  <br/>
     Well thanks for all your advice.  I will tell her the things you have <br/>
told me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I hope it is possible to get his phone records, or logs from the phone <br/>
system <br/>
 from her employer and prove this harrassment in court.  That would help make <br/>
 him look bad.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thankfully alot of it is on tape.  He has actually called her every 15 <br/>
minutes and left nasty, ugly and screaming messages on the answering machine. <br/>
 Her answering machine has the little tapes that you can take out and keep, <br/>
so she keeps buying new ones and keeping the old ones to use as proof in <br/>
court.  This is at least one thing she has going for her as evidence.  Her ex <br/>
is a real smooth operator, and we will need these tapes to prove that he is <br/>
lying!<br/>
