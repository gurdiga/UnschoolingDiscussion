<div id="ygrps-yiv-41967601">Whoever wrote the end of year narratives, would you please forward <br/>
them to me. I can&#39;t seem to locate them by paging back through the <br/>
reams of posts. I met a mom yesterday who is interested in helping <br/>
her daughter visualize her learning progression and I wanted to share <br/>
your version.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Pat<br/>
