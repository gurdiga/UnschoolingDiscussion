<br/>
If you make them do it, that can easily get them NOT to write.<br/>
<br/>
Ten is young to be writing stories.  Seven is young to write anything.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have done most of their writing on on-line role-playing games which <br/>
work with text messages.  LOTS of writing.  And a kind of writing which never <br/>
happens in school, which is real-time writing which gets a response and <br/>
changes what someone else does, right then.  Whether what they&#39;re doing is <br/>
&quot;REAL&quot; or not, it&#39;s as real as football, and safer.<br/>

doing than writing.  (I thought he expressed himself quite well.)  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Kirby says there are some out on the internet.  They&#39;re called MUDs and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know why.  And on AOL there is AON (Alliance of Nations) which people <br/>
get into by applying, learning rules, and being accepted in.  That one might <br/>
be too fast and rough for younger players (maybe not; not sure).  AON is like <br/>
a complex set of parallel D&D worlds.  They involve chatrooms, instant <br/>
messages, private chat rooms, online dice, and reporting the results of <br/>
battles to specific record keepers in each world.  <br/>
<br/>
There are others which have some action and some writing.  For those you buy <br/>
a disk or download a program, and buy into the game ($10 a month for some?  <br/>
less for some?) and I&#39;m not knowing the names right now; sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s getting ready to go to work (he came down once to talk to me but he <br/>
needs to leave within moments) and Marty&#39;s still asleep.  Maybe others here <br/>
can contribute??<br/>

Making them do it is a sure way for them to hate writing and NOT do it for <br/>
pleasure.<br/>
Drawing is a great way to develop early writing skills, writing letters to a <br/>
pen pal IS writing, real writing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>my son hasn&#39;t really touched a pencil or pen now that we started unschooling. <br/>
 He is ambidextrous and uses both hands. In school he was being forced to <br/>
pick one and his writing is very poor so is his drawing, I think a lot of it <br/>
comes from the pressure he was put under to pick a hand.  Now he does what he <br/>
wants with what ever hand sometimes he eats right sometimes he eats left, <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter to me, and when he is ready to try the pens, paper, pencils, <br/>
marker and all are all where he can get them.  <br/>

like your daughter&#39;s, is fairly practical -- lists, letters and such.  I<br/>
rarely meet children who can&#39;t think up little stories in their play, and<br/>
most children learn the mechanics of writing, too.  But is it necessary that<br/>
they use these two skills together?<br/>

As for your son, good for him, being able to write words at 7.  Most of the<br/>
boys in my son&#39;s scout troop are 7 and still struggling to write.  If he&#39;s<br/>
drawing a lot, he&#39;s probably getting some really good fine motor skill<br/>
development out of that, too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think making them write is necessarily going to encourage an<br/>
interest in it.  My 6 year old son&#39;s writing has gotten better lately mainly<br/>
from his desire to be helpful.  He writes things on the grocery list for me<br/>
when my hands are all messy in the kitchen.  That&#39;s about it for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520428555">some thoughts on writing..<br/>
<br/>
*email and instant messenger<br/>
*storytelling software .. they write the story and then use clip art to <br/>
decorate. All three of my kids love this, even the four year old likes <br/>
to have his sister help him with stories.<br/>
* keep a journal BUT.. make it cool looking, get lots of colored pens, <br/>
and they don&#39;t have to WRITE in it.. they can draw, doodle, paste <br/>
pictures, photos, ticket stubs, anything they want, and let them share, <br/>
and be really interested when they do.<br/>
* put on puppet shows or act out stories.. still storytelling and be the <br/>
audience.<br/>
* what did you do today? this is non-fiction writing, just orally. Same <br/>
sort of thought process. and listen to this too.<br/>
<br/>
Let them learn how to use language, document what they do, share what <br/>
they do with others, and they will learn to write as they *need* to <br/>
write.<br/>
<br/>
8 yo dd likes to write stories and keep a journal. She also uses her <br/>
dolls to act out recent experiences.. it&#39;s her way of processing.<br/>
<br/>
12 yo dd is currently working on a script, for a play that is about <br/>
honoring nature, and already has one booking to perform it at an <br/>
environmental fair in the spring. She&#39;s also currently recruiting kids <br/>
to be in it.<br/>
<br/>
4 yo loves to tell what he did, participate in discussions, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
writing is communication and storytelling. Start with the purpose rather <br/>
than the process. I don&#39;t ever make them write, except thank-you notes, <br/>
and they often use drawing or email or e-cards to do that.<br/>

her friends that live around us to be in this movie. She has done well with <br/>
it, all she wants from me is some help with scripts, and maybe some ideas <br/>
about props, and other &quot;movie&quot; things. It is great when kids use their <br/>
imagination for things like this. Have you ever thought of sending your dd&#39;s <br/>

to be able to share their scripts, plays, poems and such. You may or may not <br/>
be &quot;discovered&quot; there, but your &quot;peers&quot; will critique your work, it will be <br/>

 <br/>
I really believe that at his age it isn&#39;t something to worry about.     He knows how to write all his letters, print and cursive.  He can read.   When he has a reason to write, he&#39;ll write.        Some people aren&#39;t writers, some are.   My son can wire things and build things and figure out things that I have no clue about,  I never had to do those things.   And I&#39;m OK,  so   really,  each to his own,   I think anyway!<br/>
