<div id="ygrps-yiv-6791214"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Does anyone have<br/>
&gt; ideas on easy readers that are a little more interesting for tweens? (That<br/>
&gt; would inolve babysitting, horses or Mary Kate and Ashley? LOL )<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We used some nice easy reader Science books from Hello, Reader series that<br/>
were about bugs, animals, etc.  DK also has some simple readers that are<br/>
sciencey.  I know that&#39;s not babysitting, etc., but at least it&#39;s not about<br/>
kindergarten!  I got those off the shelf at Barnes and Noble.  Thin<br/>
paperbacks, $3-5 each.<br/>
