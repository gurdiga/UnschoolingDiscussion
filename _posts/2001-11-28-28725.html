SIX HUMANS<br/>
Six humans trapped by happenstance<br/>
In black and bitter cold;<br/>
<br/>
one possessed a stick of wood,<br/>
Or so the story&#39;s told.<br/>
<br/>
Their dying fire in need of logs,<br/>
The first woman held her&#39;s back,<br/>
For on the faces around the fire,<br/>
She noticed one was black.<br/>
<br/>
The next man looking across the way<br/>
Saw one not of his church,<br/>
And couldn&#39;t bring himself to give<br/>
The fire his stick of birch.<br/>
<br/>
The third one sat in tattered clothes -<br/>
He gave his coat a hitch;<br/>
Why should his log be put to use<br/>
To warm the idle rich?<br/>
<br/>
The rich man just sat back and thought<br/>
Of the wealth he had in store,<br/>
And how to keep what he had earned<br/>
From the lazy, shiftless poor.<br/>
<br/>
The black man&#39;s face bespoke revenge<br/>
As the fire passed from his sight;<br/>
For all he saw in his stick of wood<br/>
Was a chance to spite the white.<br/>
<br/>
And the last man of this forlorn group<br/>
Did naught except for gain;<br/>
Giving only to those who gave,<br/>
Was how he played the game.<br/>
<br/>
The logs held tight in death&#39;s still hands<br/>
Was proof of human sin.<br/>
They didn&#39;t die from the cold without,<br/>
They died from the cold within.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203145127">%-}  So many folks overlap (in a nice way &lt;g&gt;) from group to group that I&#39;m<br/>
sometimes not sure which list I am responding to a post on.  Or maybe it is<br/>

question about one of my posts and I almost didn&#39;t know who she was<br/>
because the subject line had the &quot;wrong&quot; group in it!<br/>
