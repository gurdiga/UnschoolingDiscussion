Popular Culture and Philosophy series<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Robyn Coburn tipped me off that there&#39;s a book called &quot;South Park and  <br/>
Philosophy&quot; so I went to Amazon, where I found it used (not  <br/>
absolutely inexpensive, but still...) but I also discovered there&#39;s a  <br/>
whole series.<br/>
<br/>
For older teens, for husbands/dads, for relatives who are on the cusp  <br/>
of considering that maybe popular culture isn&#39;t altogether a waste of  <br/>
time, these might make great holiday gifts, either new from the  <br/>
publisher or used from other sources.<br/>
<br/>
They have books on Seinfeld, The Simpsons, The Matrix, Buffy, Lord of  <br/>
the Rings, Baseball, The Sopranos, Woody Allen, Harry Potter, Mel  <br/>
Gibson&#39;s Passion, Star Wars, Superheroes and Philosophy (they all  <br/>
end ...and Philosophy, I should&#39;ve said), The Atkins Diet, Chronicles  <br/>
of Narnia, Hip Hop, Bob Dylan, Harley Davidson.   Well go look at the  <br/>
site.  There are more.  Hitchcock.  The Beatles.<br/>
<br/>
The name of the Monty Python one is especially cute:<br/>
<br/>
Monty Python and Philosophy:  Nudge Nudge, Think Think!<br/>
<br/>
Even if they&#39;re not easy reading, even if the person you give it to  <br/>
doesn&#39;t read it, it&#39;s still like a talisman to prove that  <br/>
philosophers can find value in these things.   We all already know  <br/>
our kids can!<br/>

  I just got 3 different Simpsons themed books: The Simpsons and Philosophy, The Psychology of The Simpsons, and What&#39;s Science Ever Done For Us (What The Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life and the Universe). Can you tell she likes the Simpsons &lt;g&gt;? She&#39;s started with the psych book first, and really likes it. If she enjoys the Simpsons philosophy book, I&#39;ll see if she&#39;s interested in another one from the series. I&#39;ll have to see if the psych and science books are part of a series as well. I didn&#39;t know they did so many. Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009456939">This is a great series.  I always enjoy perusing them at the bookstore.  You<br/>
have given me new motivation to find my copy of &quot;Superheroes and Philosophy:<br/>
Truth, Justice, and the Socratic Way&quot;; I have had it in the back of my mind<br/>
for a while, now I just need to figure out which box. :)  I have shared them<br/>
with my son, 15, and he seemed interested in the Simpsons and Matrix<br/>
volumes.  I would have bought him one, but, due to financial constraints, he<br/>
chose the guidebook to Pokemon Diamond.  I am thinking Christmas now.  I did<br/>
not realize how many topics were available.  Thanks for the link, Sandra.<br/>

Here&#39;s a link to another book - The Physics of Buffyverse<br/>

This author gave a Skeptics Society talk at Caltech earlier this year, which <br/>
I sadly missed. The customer reviews suggest that it is way more than just <br/>
physics.<br/>
