<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That goal can be hard to embrace. For one thing it makes it seem like<br/>
&gt; unschoolers don&#39;t care where kids end up<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When in reality what I am experiencing with my 16yro is that I don&#39;t know <br/>
where he will end up. Right now he is teaching snowboarding and loving it and <br/>
that could end up being a part of his life forever, maybe he will always teach <br/>
snowboarding, but maybe not. Maybe he will teach this year and maybe next but <br/>
who knows? Maybe he will eventually quit teaching it and just enjoy the sport <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
He is also enrolled to start a workshop on mixing music at the beginning of <br/>
February as he is very into music and this kind of thing. Maybe he will bump <br/>
into his life&#39;s passion at this workshop, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
He has also landed a part in a musical being put on by a local children&#39;s <br/>
theater company. Maybe one day he will be on Broadway, maybe he will become <br/>
interested in becoming a director or a light technician or maybe none of these or <br/>
maybe something I have not even mentioned or thought of.<br/>
<br/>
What I see is that all of these opportunities are unique and life expanding. <br/>
As the one who facilitates, offers and arranges these experiences I only know <br/>
the things that I see. I see the immediate learning opportunities involved in <br/>
each and I am also aware of many of the more less apparent ones. It is after <br/>
and beyond these that I think the magic begins, that is where I have to let go <br/>
and trust that there are a hundred other options out there waiting to happen <br/>
that I can only dream of, most I will never know that happen. Probably a good <br/>
many will not become evident for years to come. I liken it to reading a book, <br/>
even if we all read the same book we are each going to come away with something <br/>
different if even ever so slightly. That is how I see my part in this, I just <br/>
keep trying to look for ways to allow my kids to taste life in as many <br/>
different situations as I can, not knowing when or where the magic happens but <br/>
trusting that it does.<br/>
Oh, and I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I love doing what I do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486006313">And this idea that we will discover this one THING we are supposed to do for<br/>
our whole lives?  Even those people who did work for the same company all<br/>
their lives had interests outside which changed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care what my kids end up doing with their lives so long as they can<br/>
support themselves (or marry someone who will -evil grin-) and are happy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, that is such a wonderful way to view unschooling and exactly how I feel. <br/>
 There is magic in unchooling.  The magic of watching the human mind grow and <br/>
develop. To see the spark in their eyes when they get it!  <br/>
That&#39;s magic.<br/>
