<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138051445">One of my all time favorite movies is Rudy. No matter how many times I see <br/>
it, I cry at the end every time. I&#39;ts a must for all my kids to see at a <br/>
certain point in time! True story too.<br/>
<br/>
Another favorite is My Cousin Vinny. Totally different kind of movie but a <br/>
classis in my eyes none the less. I actually watched this one while Joseph <br/>
was being born. Even the Dr. kept turning around to see what was going on!!!<br/>
