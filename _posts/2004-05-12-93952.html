<br/>
Look at garage sales for different colors of exterior latex and paint a<br/>
mural on the fence.  It could be dinosaurs or a spaceship invasion or<br/>
jungle animals or racing cars or a Marc Chagall scene or anything.  <br/>
<br/>
You can buy paint for concrete and paint a habitat or a roadway for Hot<br/>
Wheels or a twister mat or something on the concrete, if it&#39;s a wide flat<br/>
surface...I&#39;m not picturing the yard well... sorry if that&#39;s a goofy<br/>
idea. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331584712">If your landlord won&#39;t let you paint the fence you could make a large mural<br/>
on a canvas tarp and then seal it up with poly and hang it on the fence. :)<br/>
