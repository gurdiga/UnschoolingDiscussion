<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236260651">Read what I wrote.  In some cases (SOME cases) this happens in mammals<br/>
INCLUDING humans.  Not ALL cases, not ALL the time, not ALL antibiotics but<br/>
it can and does happen.  BTW, penicillin and sulfa drugs are the worst<br/>
offenders.<br/>
<br/>
And please reread your own answer in which you yourself state &quot;MOST&quot; drugs.<br/>
There is no medical webside, or there shouldn&#39;t be, that states absolutes!<br/>
Anyone who has ever worked in the medical profession will tell you,<br/>
including your own doctor (or he should if he is a good doctor and not a<br/>
hack), that there is no such thing as an answer in medicine that says<br/>
ALWAYS.<br/>
<br/>
The statement was in reference to generalities and the original statement<br/>
&quot;It isn&#39;t a &quot;sweeping generality&quot; to say that any other mammal should be<br/>
breastfed,&quot; which is in fact a sweeping generality.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Believe&quot; and &quot;fact&quot; are not synonymous.  It is a fact that SOME humans and<br/>
other mammals bodies act as a sieve and the amount of antibiotic or other<br/>
substance that goes into their body goes through and out in the breast milk<br/>
in the same concentration it goes in.  It doesn&#39;t happen often in humans but<br/>
it does happen.  It happens relatively frequently in some mammals, in<br/>
particular some breeds of dogs.  In those breeds when a c-section is done,<br/>
wise breeders do not let the vets give the bitches antibiotics because there<br/>
is a very real posibility that the puppies will die if they injest the<br/>
bitch&#39;s milk after she is given antibiotics.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the statement stands as stated which was qualified by &quot;some,&quot;<br/>
&quot;uncommon&quot; and other such words.<br/>

drugs. When I knew I would have to take something, I had no idea how <br/>
misinformed I was about drugs, in this case antiobiotics and breastfeeding. I <br/>
was not willing for any reason to give up  breastfeeding and was prepared to <br/>
do anything, including not taking antiobiotics for an abcess. I was glad to <br/>
find out I didn&#39;t have to. Of course there are no absolutes. . . I definitely <br/>
believe in the gray area, but I also think there is a lot of misinformation <br/>
among health (s)care providers about breastfeeding. That has been my own <br/>
experience anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481326179">The studies that have already been done were on cow&#39;s milk and on the<br/>
residuals in the flesh of beef, lamb, pork and chicken.  The most current<br/>
study is on human milk as more and more women are nursing because of<br/>
attachment parenting, LLL, natural child birth, midwifery, etc. being<br/>
accepted as not just something that &quot;hippies&quot; do, more and more women are<br/>
nursing for longer periods of time.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; yeh, that would be antibiotics in cow milk, cow meat, etc.  Not enough<br/>
&gt; kids nurse long enough to be bothered.<br/>

&gt; &quot;The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that<br/>
&gt; English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don&#39;t just borrow<br/>
&gt; words; on<br/>
&gt; occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them<br/>
&gt; unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.&quot;-- James D. Nicoll<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; actually, the way it works is that most, in fact the VAST majority of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; medications--even the ones tha do show up in milk, are less harmful<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not nursing at all is.<br/>

drugs<br/>
&gt; &gt; taken<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by lactating mothers show up in very small amounts in breast milk. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have not<br/>

some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; medication for dental work a while back and researched this<br/>
extensively<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found to my surprise that there was very little I could not take.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534352703">Not necessarily.  If the major marijuana metabolite<br/>
(11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-THC) is what is present in the mother&#39;s body, it<br/>
does not pass through the placental barrier, nor does the fetus break 9-THC<br/>
down into 11 nor like the mother&#39;s body does.   Delta-9-THC does, however,<br/>
cross the placenta and enter the fetus.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike cocaine, herion and meth, babies are not born &quot;addicted&quot; (in the<br/>
accepted definition of the word) to weed nor do they go through withdrawals.<br/>
Most hospitals do not test new borns for THC nor do they have an infant<br/>
detox program for weed.<br/>

pregnancy unless the hospital put it on detox at birth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443588033">I first learned about this when we raised English Bulldogs.  Most bulls<br/>
can&#39;t deliver naturally and are done by c-section.  Being a novice, I didn&#39;t<br/>
pay as much attention as I should have when we bought the bitch and then had<br/>
her bred.  Our vet was not a bulldog specialist.  He gave her antibiotics<br/>
after the c-section as a routine thing, not as a necessary thing.  He did<br/>
not tell me about it.  All but one of the puppies died--the one that<br/>
couldn&#39;t nurse.  I had an autoposy done ($250 back in the dark ages) and<br/>
they had died of anaphalactic shock induced by penicillin which came through<br/>
the milk post surgery.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have all the books on this where I can get to them.  However, years<br/>
later when I worked as Nursing Services Coordinator, I did coordination of<br/>
ECUs for nursing staff (they have to complete so many ECUs to keep their<br/>
license current) and one of the videos and talks was on this very thing and<br/>
what to watch for in the new baby nursery and the ICN (ours locally had<br/>
mothers who wanted to nurse come in and nurse ICN babies if they (both)<br/>
could.  It is rare but not totally unheard of.  I suppose I could find it in<br/>
one of the nursing books.<br/>
