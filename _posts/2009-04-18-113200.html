<br/>
You know the vitality of feeling supported, understood, encouraged and alive?  Radical unschooling represents a life lived from the inside out.  Live freely, explore passions, and make deep connections.  Immerse yourself in unschooling at the inaugural Good Vibrations Unschooling Conference in San Diego, CA.  Whether you are curious about unschooling or were among the first, this gathering is for you.<br/>
For FOUR full days, we&#39;ll inspire, discuss, play and spread lots of bubbly energy as only unschoolers can. Children are happily welcomed, so bring the whole family- there&#39;s something for everyone!  Come ask questions, offer your sage advice, relax, renew and recharge with unschoolers from all over.  Leave invigorated and whole and maybe a little sandy!<br/>
<br/>
Our base camp for Good Vibrations is the Doubletree Hotel San Diego/Del Mar, a beautiful and conveniently located hotel less than two miles from the world-renowned Torrey Pines State Reserve and Beach.  Between sessions, swim in their gorgeous heated pool beneath palm trees, go for a hike at the reserve, or take a nap in the luxurious Sweet Dreams beds.  Feel pampered while on this special family vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Things will get rolling Thursday with registration from Noon-2:00. Once you&#39;ve registered at the hotel, head over to the beach for the Welcoming Party!  Get to know fellow unschoolers with games, laughter and digging your toes in the sand.  <br/>
Friday through Sunday afternoon a variety of activities are planned.  Hear presentations from some of the most inspiring voices from the unschooling community.  Play in a funshop or just kick back by the pool.  Get your game on in a room devoted to video gaming fans.  Stretch your mind at a roundtable discussion; get new ideas and practical solutions to enhance your unschooling life.  Men are invited to throw caution to the wind at the meeting of SSUDs (Secret Society of Unschooling Dads).  Find new friends in the lobby and head out for lunch in a nearby beach-town caf√©.  <br/>

Sandra Dodd, long-time unschooling and peaceful parenting advocate, writer and speaker, will be sharing her extensive understanding of unschooling with two informative, inspiring presentations.  Having always unschooled her three grown and very nearly-grown children, Sandra has inspired countless families with her ruminations and experience of choosing happiness to create an environment in which learning thrives.<br/>

Pam Sorooshian has shared advice and help for unschooling for many, many years through several avenues, mainly writing and speaking.

Roya Sorooshian, grown, happy, productive 4th grade dropout and radical unschooler will be answering the burning question on everyone&#39;s lips:  Will unschoolers raise their children the same way?  Come find out as you hear Roya Repeating Herself.<br/>
