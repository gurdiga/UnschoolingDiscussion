<div id="ygrps-yiv-545869711">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re on a roll here in Japan with homelearning stories in the news!<br/>
<br/>
On Aug. 28, the Asahi Evening News ran a large spread on homelearning in <br/>
Japan, and just a few days ago, the Daily Yomiuri newspaper followed up <br/>
with a hefty story on the same subject.<br/>
<br/>
A word or two of forewarning about the Daily Yomiuri article that follows:<br/>
<br/>
The story appears generally well-written and researched. But there is one <br/>
glaring omission. The writer fails to note that the new &quot;Homeschool <br/>
Support Association of Japan&quot; (HoSA), a nonprofit organization, is <br/>
neither independent nor neutral. It was created recently by a very much <br/>
for-profit corporation called Atmark, which is also mentioned in the <br/>
story. Mr. Kozo Hino, a Japanese businessman, serves as a head of both <br/>
Atmark and HoSA.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us in the homelearning community in Japan are wary of this setup: <br/>
On the one hand, the Homeschool Support Association of Japan is <br/>
*officially* supported by a long list of Japanese companies and <br/>
educational institutions (read: schools). At the same time, the HoSA is <br/>
officially endorsed by one -- count &#39;em ONE -- genuine, longtime <br/>
homelearning parent in Japan, and that is Ms. Yoshiko Kubo, who is <br/>
featured in the story. Moreover, the HoSA has one -- count &#39;em ONE -- <br/>
overseas homelearning advocate on its official supporters list, and that <br/>
is Mr. Christopher Klicka, senior counsel of the US-based Home School <br/>
Legal Defense Association. All of this can be confirmed (in Japanese) at <br/>
the HoSA website at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschool.ne.jp/Hosa/yakuin.html">http://www.homeschool.ne.jp/Hosa/yakuin.html</a><br/>
<br/>
It is also more than a little unsettling that such a questionable <br/>
organization as the HoSA, as stated in the story below, sees its function <br/>
as &quot;investigating exactly how many homeschoolers there are in Japan and <br/>
working on ways to bring them together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As for the motives of Atmark, HoSA&#39;s parent company, in providing its <br/>
Internet-based learning services to prospective homelearning clients: It <br/>
is quite ironic -- and very revealing -- that the Atmark spokesperson in <br/>
the following story quotes a need for Japanese workers to be more <br/>
competitive with American ones. It is ironic because Atmark itself, a <br/>
Japanese for-profit corporation, has recently made its debut in the <br/>
worldwide home-education market by forming a tie-up with a U.S. <br/>
education-related organization, the Alger Learning Center & Independence <br/>
High School (www.independent-learning.com), based in Washington state, <br/>
USA. Not to mention that Atmark/HoSA has been seeking support from the <br/>
controversial, US-based HSLDA. And they say *politics* makes strange <br/>
bedfellows....  <br/>
<br/>
And then there is the intimidating, almost threatening, talk in the <br/>
following story about the Japanese Ministry of Education&#39;s stance on <br/>
homelearning. For the record, folks: The Education Ministry has taken no <br/>
OFFICIAL position on home education in Japan one way or the other, as far <br/>
as we are aware. (Education Ministry officials do, however, love to speak <br/>
&quot;unofficially&quot; and without being named, as in this newspaper story, so <br/>
that nobody is held accountable for any statement about home-based <br/>
education that comes out of the ministry&#39;s offices. Clever, eh?)<br/>
<br/>
While it is true that under current statutes, parents in Japan do have a <br/>
legal obligation (reportedly at the risk of being fined) to make sure <br/>
their children get a proper education, Japanese homelearning families are <br/>
easily getting around that stipulation by letting their children -- <br/>
rather than the parents -- make the ultimate decision to leave the public <br/>
school system and learn at home.<br/>
<br/>
True, as the story states, the ministry has not given its legal blessing <br/>
yet to homelearning in Japan. But it is also true that the ministry is <br/>
generally not standing in the way of those families who opt to learn at <br/>
home. Harassment of homelearning families in Japan by the Ministry of <br/>
Education is indeed rare at present.<br/>
<br/>
OK, enough forewarning, now on to the news....<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

STAY-AT-HOME KIDS SHUNNING THE SYSTEM<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By Tim Large<br/>
Daily Yomiuri Staff Writer<br/>
<br/>
For Yoshiko Kubo, it was the bullying that clinched it. During two weeks <br/>
of teacher training at the local middle school, the mother of two saw <br/>
enough nastiness to put her off the school system for good. &quot;The teachers <br/>
were doing everything they could to stop it, but there was terrible <br/>
bullying -- during class, everywhere, every day,&quot; she said. &quot;I decided <br/>
there was no way I could send my daughters there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So Kubo chose to do what until recently was almost unheard of in Japan: <br/>
educate her children herself at home.<br/>
<br/>
Six years later, Asuka and Sakura, 12 and 9, respectively, find turning <br/>
up to class as easy as tumbling out of bed. Though they are officially <br/>
registered at the local primary school, neither has knownthe chime of the <br/>
recess bell or the squeak of chalk upon a blackboard. But, according to <br/>
their mother, they are noworse off for that.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At regular school, everything is decided by adults,&quot; said Kubo, who <br/>
works evenings at a cram school in Chiba Prefecture. &quot;There&#39;s a schedule: <br/>
Do this, do that, follow the rules. Homeschooled children have to take <br/>
responsibility for themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She went on to describe a typical day. Getting up in the morning whenever <br/>
they want, Asuka and Sakura take turns making breakfast and doing the <br/>
dishes. They then settle down in a room of their choice to do their daily <br/>
assignments: arithmetic, English, geography, science. Fifteen or 20 <br/>
minutes is usually sufficient to complete a given exercise. Kubo and the <br/>
children&#39;s grandparents are on hand to answer questions.<br/>
<br/>
Afternoons are for reading at the local library (or going on field trips <br/>
to museums and galleries). Kubo is confident that by engrossing <br/>
themselves in books for up to three hours a day, they will stretch their <br/>
language skills and pick up a wealth of knowledge on the way.<br/>
<br/>
By and large, the point is to follow their own noses, she added. If <br/>
something strikes them as interesting, they have the freedom, motivation <br/>
and investigative skills to pursue it for all it&#39;s worth.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At the moment, my eldest is interested in weaving. She wanted to make a <br/>
big loom, so the other day we bought all the materials. Now, every <br/>
morning, it&#39;s clackity-clackity-clack,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
While unusual, Asuka and Sakura are not unique. Nobody knows exactly how <br/>
many children are being taught at home in Japan, but unofficial estimates <br/>
put the figure at somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000. What is clear is <br/>
that the trend is growing.<br/>
<br/>
Statistically speaking, their numbers are hidden among the swelling ranks <br/>
of Japan&#39;s &quot;truant&quot; population. According to the Education Ministry, a <br/>
record 130,000 primary and middle school students were registered as <br/>
absent from school for 30 days or more in 1999.<br/>
<br/>
Most discussions of absenteeism focus on bullying, delinquency and <br/>
psychological problems among juveniles. Certainly, a good many families <br/>
opt for homeschooling by default. It is a last resort for children who <br/>
simply will not -- or cannot -- go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, there is a growing awareness that increasing numbers are shunning <br/>
the school system for proactive reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Kubo&#39;s family is a case in point. True, it was the bullying she witnessed <br/>
while training for her teacher&#39;s certificate that settled the matter. But <br/>
she had long been interested in homeschooling, she said, ever since an <br/>
American friend raved about its benefits.<br/>
<br/>
To be sure, she is not alone in feeling that Japan&#39;s rigid school system <br/>
is ill-equipped for the job of fostering creative, responsible <br/>
individuals. Aside from the national soul-searching sparked by the recent <br/>
phenomenon of so-called classroom breakdown, the received wisdom is that <br/>
the times themselves demand new paradigms for learning. This feeling was <br/>
reflected in a proposal for the introduction of a three-day school week <br/>
by former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi&#39;s private advisory council in <br/>
January.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The most important question to ask of education is how far and how <br/>
richly children are being stretched,&quot; said education critic and former <br/>
schoolteacher Naoki Ogi. &quot;It&#39;s not as simple as saying, &#39;You&#39;ve got to go <br/>
to school.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jun Adachi, an adviser at Atmark Learning Inc., a company specializing in <br/>
alternative approaches to education, agreed. &quot;We&#39;re no longer looking for <br/>
factory workers who show up on time and don&#39;t say anything and just obey <br/>
the rules,&quot; he said. &quot;To compete with American workers, we need better <br/>
thinkers, and the school system doesn&#39;t seem to generate enough of them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In April, Atmark Learning launched Inter-Highschool, an online curriculum <br/>
tailored specifically for homeschoolers. The Internet school currently <br/>
boasts about 30 enrollees.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are trying to offer a different type of skill set, and we think that <br/>
homeschooling is the way to generate that,&quot; Adachi said.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the general feeling that reform is sorely needed, homeschooling <br/>
families still find themselves up against a wall of opposition. There is <br/>
the legal question, for starters. Under the School Education Law, parents <br/>
can be prosecuted for failing to see that their children attend school, <br/>
though such cases are rare.<br/>
<br/>
Home-education advocates counter that the Constitution is on their side. <br/>
They point out that while Article 26 states that citizens &quot;shall be <br/>
obligated to have all boys and girls under their protection receive <br/>
ordinary education,&quot; it does not specify where this &quot;ordinary education&quot; <br/>
should take place.<br/>
<br/>
Cut off from the real world?<br/>
<br/>
The Education Ministry, meanwhile, refuses to recognize homeschooling as <br/>
a valid alternative to the nation&#39;s system of compulsory education. A <br/>
reason commonly cited is that children schooled at home are denied the <br/>
valuable socialization that takes place in the classroom and in the <br/>
playground.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Learning is not just about filling your head with knowledge,&quot; a ministry <br/>
official commented. &quot;It&#39;s about hearing what your friends think. It&#39;s <br/>
about realizing that people have different opinions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kubo herself admitted this was one of her greatest concerns. While her <br/>
daughters are not hermetically sealed from the outside world -- they have <br/>
made buddies at swimming club, for example -- they do sometimes wish they <br/>
had more friends, she said.<br/>
<br/>
Christopher Klicka, senior counsel for the Virginia-based Home School <br/>
Legal Defense Association, rejects the socialization argument on the <br/>
grounds that club and community activities offer ample opportunities to <br/>
mix with others. He also said a little bit of protection could be a good <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s a lot of negative socialization that goes on, and there&#39;s <br/>
positive socialization,&quot; he said. &quot;Homeschoolers excel in positive <br/>
socialization.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Klicka, who has defended thousands of homeschooling families in the <br/>
United States in legal conflicts, cited one court case in which a <br/>
prosecutor argued that children taught at home &quot;don&#39;t have the <br/>
opportunity to meet up with the bully in the class and have to deal with <br/>
that. And we&#39;re like, is that a big advantage to be able to meet with a <br/>
bully?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The author of &quot;Home Schooling: The Right Choice&quot; was in Tokyo last month <br/>
to advise the recently launched Home School Support Association of Japan <br/>
(Hosa), a nonprofit organization set up to champion the rights of <br/>
homeschooling families. The association is currently investigating <br/>
exactly how many homeschoolers there are in Japan and working on ways to <br/>
bring them together.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I began my work 15 years ago, it was only legal in five (U.S.) <br/>
states to teach children at home, and now it&#39;s legal in all 50 states,&quot; <br/>
said Klicka, who has homeschooled his own seven children. &quot;The parents in <br/>
America went through much to win a very basic and fundamental right...and <br/>
our hope is that Japan can avoid the mistakes that we had in America, <br/>
that this does not have to be a battle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It will be if critics have their way. Aside from the knotty issue of <br/>
socialization, opponents of homeschooling question whether most parents <br/>
are pedagogically and economically able to take over the job of schools.<br/>
<br/>
Tsuyoshi Suzuki, assistant professor of education philosophy at Aichi <br/>
University of Education, agrees with homeschooling in principle. But he <br/>
argues that as long as it is available only to a minority of families, it <br/>
cannot be considered a realistic alternative to the school system.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To a certain extent, it depends on parents having high incomes, having a <br/>
high level of education themselves and being able to take responsibility <br/>
(for their children&#39;s learning) right to the end. In Japan, many of the <br/>
people who are removing their kids from the school system are not <br/>
especially like that,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
Home-education advocates point to a recent study of more than 20,000 U.S. <br/>
students to make their case. According to &quot;The Scholastic and Demographic <br/>
Characteristics of Home School Students in 1998,&quot; on average, U.S. <br/>
homeschoolers outperform their public school counterparts by 30 to 37 <br/>
percentile points on national standardized achievement tests across all <br/>
subjects. Parents&#39; educational background, teaching credentials and <br/>
income levels have no substantive impact on academic performance, the <br/>
report concludes. What is more, a high percentage of homeschoolers go on <br/>
to prestigious universities or start their own businesses.<br/>
<br/>
Such findings come as encouragement to Kubo, who, for all her conviction, <br/>
sometimes feels she is stumbling in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I first started six years ago, there was hardly any information <br/>
about homeschooling in Japan,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&#39;t know anyone who was <br/>
actually doing homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She added: &quot;I think I&#39;m doing the right thing, but sometimes I can&#39;t help <br/>
wondering.&quot;<br/>
