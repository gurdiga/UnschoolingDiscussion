 </span></blockquote>My daughter did not start off going to school, but it was always her choice <br/>
and she did choose to go to school for a half year once and a full year last <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
I was in college to get my masters in education after I had her, and started <br/>
looking into homeschooling because a neighbor was doing it, and I thought she <br/>
was nuts. Once I began researching it (before the internet for me), it became <br/>
clear that I would not only homeschool her, but unschooling was the way for <br/>
us. However, it has taken me a long time to get to a comfortable spot in <br/>
unschooling and letting go. After her experiences with school, my daughter <br/>
has decided to not ever return. It wasn&#39;t that it was so bad for her, but she <br/>
doesn&#39;t like having her freedom taken away. And now she has found that <br/>
unschooling is the way for her as she sees where it can take her. She had <br/>
trouble understanding before,  probably due to my inadequacies about it. My <br/>
son who is almost 2 will have a completely different experience as the way <br/>
will have been paved by his sister. A good thing too, as his grandparents <br/>
(which are different from hers) are both long time teachers, now retired, so <br/>
it will help that I have the resolve and attitude I have now about it. I was <br/>
unsure before, but now stand full of confidence in what we are doing. I <br/>
always knew it felt right but did not have the ability  to deal with <br/>
mainstream people.<br/>
