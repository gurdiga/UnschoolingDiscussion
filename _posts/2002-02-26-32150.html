&gt;<br/>
&gt;  can anyone PLEASE give me<br/>
&gt; &gt; some advice?  thank you!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sure - relax and take care of the new baby!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ve been unschooling for 4 years.  My children have continued to learn,<br/>
&gt;day after day, without any structured lessons.  My 8yo is picking up<br/>
&gt;multiplication on his own.  My 14yo has studied algebra, chemistry and<br/>
&gt;American and Texas history on his own initiative.  No workbooks - just<br/>
&gt;plenty of access to the library, to the Internet, to Mom and Dad, and to<br/>
&gt;other adults who will answer his questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Read some of John Holt&#39;s books.  Read this article that was in the Houston<br/>
&gt;Chronicle yesterday.   The author, Crispin Sartwell, is chairman of<br/>
&gt;humanities and sciences at the Maryland Institute<br/>
&gt;College of Art in Baltimore:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1262000">http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1262000</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Deschool yourself.   Know that the educational system doesn&#39;t work, so that<br/>
&gt;copying it won&#39;t work at home either.  People learn naturally because <br/>
&gt;that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;what Nature intends for them to do.  Perhaps they won&#39;t learn the same<br/>
&gt;things kids at school are learning -  but they&#39;ll be able to learn them, at<br/>
&gt;any time they become important.  An education is not just a<br/>
&gt;government-mandated set of classes on specific subjects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The longer we unschool, the happier we are with it.  DH thought it would<br/>
&gt;work for our first child, who is intellectually gifted, but didn&#39;t expect <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;to work for our second, who is intellectually average.  It works well for<br/>
&gt;both of them.  It&#39;s the &quot;average&quot; kid who&#39;s figuring out multiplication and<br/>
&gt;division on his own, with Legos and cookies and video games.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It works!  Trust yourself, trust the kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009047961">Psam,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback.  My son is 9 1/2 and couldn&#39;t really give a rip <br/>
right now when it comes to math.  I am doing my best to leave it alone, but <br/>
I admit to sometimes feeling pressure (which I put on myself, of course).  <br/>
But your explanation caused me to remember that, just the other day, Dylan <br/>
&quot;discovered&quot;  Calvin & Hobbes, and began reading with a fervor...something <br/>
he&#39;d been totally unwilling to do up &#39;til then...and he was so taken with <br/>
the book that, having read 24 pages the first night, he looked ahead to see <br/>
how many pages the book contained and estimated he had only 4 more days of <br/>
material left.<br/>
<br/>
Your response lends comfort, as it helps me realize that my son may one day <br/>
have an interest in math, as he now does with reading (of the sort that <br/>
suits him).<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on this one?:  He stopped me short just yesterday when he <br/>
misspoke.  I can&#39;t even remember what the word was, but let&#39;s just say he <br/>
used &quot;seen&quot;  when the proper word usage would have been &quot;saw.&quot;  I gently <br/>
reminded him in what context the word would appropriately be used and he <br/>
retorted &quot;I talk the way I talk and that is that.&quot;  Talk about a dressing <br/>
down!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s such a teriffic kid, and I want the best for him, and I want to stay <br/>
out of his way.  But does anyone have any suggestions on what to do about a <br/>
situation like this?  I don&#39;t want to trample all over him and &quot;correct&quot;  <br/>
him all of the time (and there are lots of things I choose to let go and <br/>
don&#39;t point out to him), but if I don&#39;t offer the proper grammar usage, at <br/>
least from time to time, where will he get it?<br/>
<br/>

how gently. I don&#39;t do it to other people. The whol idea of prescriptive<br/>
grammar is controversial, anyway, ask a linguist. People eventually end<br/>
up talking the way peope, around them and/or people in books they read<br/>
talk, barring a languagfe disorder of some sort.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is very hard not to correct, but I really don&#39;t unless I&#39;m<br/>
sure it&#39;s welcome. The one exception seems to be word pronounciation - a<br/>
lot of big readers (including me) end up promouncing words that they&#39;ve<br/>
read but never heard incorrectly. I never minded a gentle correction on<br/>
that, and Cacie doesn&#39;t seem to either... but her dad did, so he still<br/>
pronounces pseudonym as swade -o - nim and I don&#39;t comment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-304395912">Freedompanther, he will eventually talk the way his parents talk.  In the<br/>
meantime, rather than correct him, you might try paraphrasing him with<br/>
the proper words.This demonstrates both that you are listening and how to<br/>
say it properly, without scolding.  Y&#39;know, there&#39;s nothing wrong with<br/>
using slang.  My children use all kinds of special slang words to talk<br/>
that they pick up at the teen center and among friends.  I used to go to<br/>
a school with 3% white and 94% black people.  And I could not believe how<br/>
snobby those white people were when they would criticize the slang talk<br/>
of the black people, which I thought was very cool and<br/>
interesting(ebonics?).  I once sang in a choir with Jester Hairston and<br/>
he explained how the African slaves could not pronounce certain sounds in<br/>
English, then passed that style of speech to their children and so forth.<br/>
 He said you wouldn&#39;t criticize a Frenchman for not being able to say<br/>
certain vowels or consonants in English.  I come from a hispanic<br/>
background, and my cousins would talk their street chicano slang to their<br/>
buddies, then turn around and talk perfect English to me.  I, on the<br/>
other hand, grew up reading a lot of books and learned languange really<br/>
by reading so much.  But I still talk like my parents, especially like my<br/>
step mom&#39;s family with whom I am very close and they say &quot;ain&#39;t&quot; and <br/>
&quot;whole &#39;nother&quot; and use all sorts of country bumpkin-type idioms in their<br/>
conversation.  Sometimes I feel embarrassed that I talk like that and I<br/>
work on sounding more dignified, especially when I am speaking in public.<br/>
 But, sure&#39;nuff, at home with my kids I sound like reeeal country<br/>
bumpkin, if you can do that with a hispanic, high pitched voice like<br/>
mine.  Then throw in a few curse words I learned from my stepdad, and I<br/>
am extremely improper in my word usage when I&#39;m relaxed.  But at work, I<br/>
am very professional.  And with most of my friends I talk clearly and<br/>
properly.  My mother is from New York and is extremely articulate, so I<br/>
must get that from her.  All this to say, don&#39;t be afraid that people<br/>
will not respect your child for the way he speaks.  He will learn on his<br/>
own that if you want people to respect you and really listen to your<br/>
opinion, you have to conform a little to accepted standards of<br/>
communication.  But that will probably come by being embarrassed a few<br/>
times rather than by being scolded.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721923046">Wow, Dar,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what we were going to do when Dylan ran out of Calvin books. <br/>
  I&#39;ve been racing to buy them up so he doesn&#39;t run out of material.  I know <br/>
my hubby and I have always liked The Far Side, and I didn&#39;t even know they <br/>
had books out.  I will have to look for Asterix, also.  I&#39;ve never heard of <br/>
that one.<br/>
<br/>
More on Calvin:  Dylan&#39;s reading last night prompted him to follow the lead <br/>
of Calvin who creating a huge &quot;snow head&quot;  peering out over the crest of a <br/>
hill.  First thing this morning, he donned his snow gear and went out side <br/>
to build one.  I haven&#39;t been able to interest Dylan in leaving the house <br/>
all winter (although he gets out when at friends&#39; homes).  And he went out <br/>
all by himself, while I was otherwise involved.  And he&#39;s building things, <br/>
inspired again and again by Calvin.  (Dylan just hollered to me from his <br/>
bedroom &quot;Mom, I&#39;m on page 62...(bragging - I love it!).<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I can let the grammar thing go!  My husband had to correct my <br/>
grammar when we worked together, and I was seventeen.  I was never made <br/>
aware, prior to that time, that I was misspeaking at all.  And, yes, I was <br/>
mortified...but I was very motivated to learn the &quot;accepted&quot;  way to express <br/>
myself using those terms.  Perhaps you and Kolleen are right, though.  I&#39;m <br/>
going to see if I&#39;m up to the task of &quot;letting things slide.&quot;  Might require <br/>
some intense prayer on my part!!  (Dylan is cackling hysterically, now, as <br/>
he&#39;s reading a strip about Calvin getting the snot beaten out of him by <br/>
Susie...he loves it when Calvin&#39;s male ego gets a good bashing.  Actually, I <br/>
do tooo!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your willingness to share your thoughts.  Much appreciated.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &quot;discovered&quot;  Calvin & Hobbes, and began reading with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fervor...something  he&#39;d been totally unwilling to do up &#39;til then...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Calvin and Hobbes are the bomb. We have the whole set, plus an extra copy<br/>
&gt;of Yukon Ho! we ended up with somehow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;and he was so taken  with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the book that, having read 24 pages the first night, he looked ahead<br/>
&gt;to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; how many pages the book contained and estimated he had only 4 more<br/>
&gt; &gt; days of  material left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is why I think that separating &quot;math&quot; from &quot;life&quot; is harmful. Stuff<br/>
&gt;like this happens all the time, we&#39;re just not conditioned to see it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Your response lends comfort, as it helps me realize that my son may<br/>
&gt;one day<br/>
&gt; &gt; have an interest in math, as he now does with reading (of the sort<br/>
&gt; &gt; that  suits him).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s the lovely thing about unschooling - he only has to read what<br/>
&gt;suits him. My daughter spent at least a year reading nothing but Calvin,<br/>
&gt;the Far Side, Asterix, and the Archies...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any thoughts on this one?:  He stopped me short just yesterday when  he<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; misspoke.  I can&#39;t even remember what the word was, but let&#39;s just  say<br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt; &gt; used &quot;seen&quot;  when the proper word usage would have been &quot;saw.&quot;  I<br/>
&gt;gently<br/>
&gt; &gt; reminded him in what context the word would appropriately be used<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he  retorted &quot;I talk the way I talk and that is that.&quot;  Talk about<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; dressing  down!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would feel pretty ashamed if someone corrected my grammar, no matter<br/>
&gt;how gently. I don&#39;t do it to other people. The whol idea of prescriptive<br/>
&gt;grammar is controversial, anyway, ask a linguist. People eventually end<br/>
&gt;up talking the way peope, around them and/or people in books they read<br/>
&gt;talk, barring a languagfe disorder of some sort.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sometimes it is very hard not to correct, but I really don&#39;t unless I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;sure it&#39;s welcome. The one exception seems to be word pronounciation - a<br/>
&gt;lot of big readers (including me) end up promouncing words that they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;read but never heard incorrectly. I never minded a gentle correction on<br/>
&gt;that, and Cacie doesn&#39;t seem to either... but her dad did, so he still<br/>
&gt;pronounces pseudonym as swade -o - nim and I don&#39;t comment.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I assume he learned the correct grammar from my husband and me, but I <br/>
can only imagine the incorrect grammar he&#39;s using he is picking up from <br/>
friends or television.  He DOES spend more time at home with us, so that may <br/>
be our salvation, eh?  Thanks for your input!<br/>

He&#39;ll get it by hearing it. His mistakes don&#39;t need to get corrected by<br/>
others, if he hears the good stuff, he&#39;ll use the good stuff.<br/>
I sometimes ask, &quot;Would you like me to give you tips about X when I think of<br/>
it?&quot; Sometimes I say this about a recipe/cooking, sometimes about words in a<br/>

&gt;&gt;----- &gt;   Please fill me in.  How old is your child who is figuring out<br/>
&gt;&gt;multiplication<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;   and division on his own with Legos, cookies, and video games?  How is<br/>
&gt;&gt;he<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;   &quot;doing this on this own?&quot;  I guess the real question is, what<br/>
&gt;&gt;interaction do<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;   you have with him to ensure that he is &quot;learning&quot;  these things?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;He&#39;s 8 years old.  It started when he wanted cookies for himself and his<br/>
&gt;&gt;brother - two for each.  &quot;How many is that?&quot;  I&#39;d ask, and he&#39;d count up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;his fingers.  Then I showed him that 2X2 is the same thing as 2+2.  Then I<br/>
&gt;&gt;had to make sure he understood that 3 X 3 wasn&#39;t 3+3, LOL!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;He&#39;s also saving money to buy something.  He gets $4 per week allowance.<br/>
&gt;&gt;He&#39;s been figuring out how many weeks it will take to get $38 at $4 per<br/>
&gt;&gt;week<br/>
&gt;&gt;. . . slowly but surely, he&#39;s making the connections.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;He gets his Legos and puts them in rows - 4 in one row, and 4 in the next<br/>
&gt;&gt;row, and 4 in the next, and says, &quot;See, Mommy?  4 X 3 is 12!&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I can tell he&#39;s doing it, because we talk about it.  I don&#39;t teach - but I<br/>
&gt;&gt;interject ideas into our conversations, like pointing out that there&#39;s an<br/>
&gt;&gt;easier way to figure up how much allowance he&#39;ll have in 7 weeks than<br/>
&gt;&gt;adding<br/>
&gt;&gt;4+4+4+4+4+4+4.  When he wants to know more, I show him.  When he loses<br/>
&gt;&gt;interest, I stop.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;He&#39;s fascinated by math right now.   He plays with his calculator a lot.<br/>
&gt;&gt;He<br/>
&gt;&gt;has figured out how much older he is than each of the cats, how much older<br/>
&gt;&gt;is brother is than each of the cats, etc.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;It&#39;s easy to tell what&#39;s going on, and to encourage it with real-life<br/>
&gt;&gt;examples.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;He&#39;s been figuring out how many weeks it will take to get $38 at $4 per<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;week<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;. . . slowly but surely, he&#39;s making the connections.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;He gets his Legos and puts them in rows - 4 in one row, and 4 in the <br/>
&gt;next<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;row, and 4 in the next, and says, &quot;See, Mommy?  4 X 3 is 12!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I can tell he&#39;s doing it, because we talk about it.  I don&#39;t teach - but <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;interject ideas into our conversations, like pointing out that there&#39;s <br/>
&gt;an<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;easier way to figure up how much allowance he&#39;ll have in 7 weeks than<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;adding<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;4+4+4+4+4+4+4.  When he wants to know more, I show him.  When he loses<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;interest, I stop.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;He&#39;s fascinated by math right now.   He plays with his calculator a lot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;He<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;has figured out how much older he is than each of the cats, how much <br/>
&gt;older<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;is brother is than each of the cats, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;It&#39;s easy to tell what&#39;s going on, and to encourage it with real-life<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;examples.<br/>

to wean him of that, because it truly serves no purpose other than to make us <br/>
feel stupid and inferior, which is probably our own issue. I think my point <br/>
is that to insist on one way of &quot;correct&quot; grammar or speaking is narrow <br/>

I&#39;m not sure I like this explanation. I suppose there were English sounds<br/>
that weren&#39;t used in their native languages, and it is more difficult to<br/>
pick up certain sounds after that critical window (although possible),<br/>
but the vast majority - I think something like 98% - of slaves in America<br/>
were born right here in this country. And, of course, at birth any human<br/>
being can pronounce the same sounds any other human being can<br/>
pronounce.... Cacie babbled using speech sounds used in !Kung but not in<br/>
English, although she hasn&#39;t now used them in years. <br/>
<br/>
 African American Vernacular English (AKA &quot;ebonics, or Black Standard<br/>
English) is not  &quot;slang&quot;. The original controversy in Oakland was about<br/>
whether or not it was a separate language, with the school district<br/>
arguing that it was. The other POV is that it&#39;s a dialect. AAVE is<br/>
definitely a whole communication system, with its own morphological,<br/>
phonological, and syntactic rules.<br/>
<br/>
There are two leading theories on how AAVE evolved. One is the dialect<br/>
theory, which is that African slaves had difficulty learning English and<br/>
made a  number of errors, which were then passed on to subsequent<br/>
generations. I don&#39;t like this theory, since the implication for me is<br/>
that the African people were stupider than the European people who were<br/>
able to learn English just fine. The other theory is that the African<br/>
slaves, coming from many different areas, were trying to develop a way to<br/>
communicate with each other, and in doing so created a pidgin, consisting<br/>
of Engliagh words, some African vocabulary familiar to many groups, and<br/>
many of the African patterns of syntax and phonology. This eventually<br/>
developed into a creole, that is, a separate language.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I just want to throw in that AAVE if in no way an &quot;inferior&quot;<br/>
English - it&#39;s a different dialect, or language, depending on your POV,<br/>
but no langauge or dialect is better or worse than any other. In many<br/>
countries (Sweden comes immediately to mind) many children learn one<br/>
language at home and another at school, and do fine... these languages<br/>
(Swedish and Norwegian) are generally understood by speakers of the<br/>
other, like standard english and AAVE, but are separate, distinct<br/>
langauges.<br/>
<br/>
I obviously find this fascinating, and have read a lot of books on the<br/>
subject, which I would recommend if I could remember the titles...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053772537">I never would have believed this before I started unschooling, but my <br/>
7 year old daughter taught herself about multiplication as well, <br/>
because of her allowance. She was getting $2.50/week (Cdn - poor <br/>
kid!). She asked my husband and I if she could have her allowance <br/>
increased to $10/week and then showed us at that amount that it would <br/>
take 10 weeks for her to have $100. Then it just clicked for her. She <br/>
looked at what she had written and she said, &quot;Hey, 10x10 is 100.&quot; <br/>
There&#39;s no way that could have been taught to her if she wasn&#39;t ready <br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
Just the other day, she did something else that surprised me. She <br/>
counted some play money that she had that totalled $51,865.00. She <br/>
had hundred dollar bills, twenties, fives and one 50 thousand dollar <br/>
bill. She counted all the small bills first and kept a running total <br/>
in her mind. When she reached 1,865.00 she had to go and get the <br/>
calculator because she couldn&#39;t picture 50,000 added on to the first <br/>
amount. She keyed in 5,000 at first and asked me if it was right. <br/>
When I asked her what she read, she said five thousand and realized <br/>
that she needed to add another zero. She added the 50,000 to the <br/>
1865.00 and got the right answer! Then she tossed the money into her <br/>
room and ran off to watch tv. Apparently, the &quot;lesson&quot; was over.<br/>
<br/>
Because both of my kids are interested in money, I opened bank <br/>
accounts for them and they each have debit cards. I am amused by the <br/>
number of people who are surprised that a 7 and 12 year old have <br/>
their own cards and are allowed to operate the debit machine on their <br/>
own. Isn&#39;t this what education is supposed to teach - how to <br/>
participate in society? In my mind, commerce is one of the main <br/>
reasons that math is taught in school. Learning it this way, makes <br/>
the math relevant to their life.<br/>
