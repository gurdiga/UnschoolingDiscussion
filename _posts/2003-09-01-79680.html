&gt; No, he hasn&#39;t done anything about it.  He just hasn&#39;t done anything.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not a class he GOES to, it&#39;s a self-study program, which he<br/>
&gt; requested that we purchase.  He has NOT said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to study<br/>
&gt; this&quot; he just isn&#39;t studying, after he asked me to get the course for<br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son often does nothing with something he&#39;s asked for, sometimes for quite<br/>
some time.  We went havers with him on a mini video camera for Christmas<br/>
last year.  He&#39;s used it some but not very much.  But it turns out there are<br/>
some things he needs that we didn&#39;t know about.  Now we&#39;re going to get him<br/>
what he needs to start using it.  Even then, if he doesn&#39;t use it right away<br/>
we&#39;re not going to guilt him about it.  We&#39;ll find out if it&#39;s because he<br/>
still needs something, whether it&#39;s equipment or help or instruction.  If he<br/>
still doesn&#39;t use it, he might prefer to sell it and get something<br/>
different.  Who knows?<br/>
