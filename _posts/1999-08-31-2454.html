Check out Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kahn or Kuhn i think.<br/>
*********<br/>
Got it!  and his book about competition..<br/>
<br/>
Went to a talk he gave once - he&#39;s cool - but dosen&#39;t like homeschooling -<br/>
at least he didn&#39;t then.<br/>
<br/>
Some yada, yada stuff about improving the schools for everyone instead of<br/>
taking your ball and going home.  Couldn&#39;t get that even GOOD schools are<br/>
still schools.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hear that his new book is titled _The Schools Our Children Deserve_.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have a copy yet, but it would be interesting to write a review that <br/>
shows how well homeschools provide what our children deserve, even going <br/>
point by point down whatever list he provides.<br/>
