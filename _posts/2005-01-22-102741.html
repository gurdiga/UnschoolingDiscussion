<div id="ygrps-yiv-903607237">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My family and I have just moved to the L.A. area and are looking <br/>
to move to Santa Monica. We are Unschoolers and since there <br/>
isn&#39;t one already, I&#39;ve created a Santa Monica Unschoolers yahoo <br/>
group. If you are interested in joining, please visit:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SantaMonicaUnschoolers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SantaMonicaUnschoolers/</a><br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Denise Thomas</div>
