small fortune on the Saxon.-=-<br/>

Pam was suggesting that IF you were going to use math materials, Saxon wasn&#39;t <br/>
a good choice.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to be &quot;spending additional money&quot; on math stuff.   <br/>

<br/>
This is not an unschooling topic.   Unschooling isn&#39;t free, but it&#39;s not &quot;a <br/>
cost of homeschooling&quot; situation.<br/>
<br/>

kids went to ps, but the emotional cost was indescribeable, but he just <br/>
doesn&#39;t get it.  Yet.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Remind him.   A museum membership is less than &quot;school clothes&quot; bought once.  <br/>
 A toy or video is the cost of a backpack (which might be lost or stolen).<br/>

The emotional cost was high.<br/>
You can do that kind of damage at home, though, if you aren&#39;t careful.<br/>

Yeah.  My only child is 11, but I&#39;m already counting on my fingers and <br/>
realizing that he&#39;s not going to be a child in my house forever and so <br/>
I&#39;m trying to squeeze more enjoyment into the years we have left.<br/>

To me, vocabulary lessons seem especially unnecessary.  Having a <br/>
sparkling adult vocabulary is where my son excells (probably because he <br/>
has two doting adults to talk to frequently), even though there&#39;s very <br/>
little in my house that looks like a textbook or a lesson.  It&#39;s pretty <br/>

Hooray!  I&#39;m very happy for you.  <br/>

As for the Saxon, if it&#39;s in good shape you can sell it to a family that<br/>
hasn&#39;t come to unschooling.  They&#39;ll be happy to get a good deal and you can<br/>
recoop some of your costs and spend it on something your kids would like<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-304680956">My 13yo hated the spelling books we were using so I thought that I would kill two birds with one stone by having him study the vocabulary words and learn how to spell them at the same time.  That&#39;s actually the biggest problem is that his spelling is so horrible.  Yesterday his 9yo brother asked him how to spell &quot;peace&quot; and Logan told him it was spelled p-i-e-a-s-e.  It makes me cringe because I just think that it looks bad when something is misspelled, even though I&#39;m not the world&#39;s greatest speller.  <br/>
He knows how to use a dictionary and I tell him how to spell words if he asks, but he just doesn&#39;t seem to care if he spells something wrong...he tells me that&#39;s what Spell Check is for.  I did point out that a lot of things aren&#39;t written on a computer, but he&#39;s just not interested right now, so I&#39;m just going to drop it.  I mean, it&#39;s not as though it was working to have a structured program, so now I&#39;m going to do it the way that I want to do it...unschooling:-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point that the structured program wasn&#39;t working anyway. Very  <br/>
likely it was counterproductive, for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
If it isn&#39;t bothering him that his spelling is not very good, then  <br/>
I&#39;d just let it completely go - no reaction, help when asked, ignore  <br/>
otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
If you can read it out of his sight, so he doesn&#39;t get the feeling  <br/>
you think there is something wrong with him, you might get some  <br/>
useful insight and some ways to give him some practical help from  <br/>
this book:<br/>
My Kid Can&#39;t Spell : Understanding and Assisting Your Child&#39;s  <br/>
Literacy Development by J. Richard Gentry.<br/>
<br/>
Spelling isn&#39;t very important these days - which is nice for those  <br/>
people whose brains just don&#39;t seem to be built for spelling well.<br/>
<br/>
My 14 yo was a very poor speller - it bothered her quite a bit a  <br/>
couple of years ago, but then she started IMing with friends, online,  <br/>
a LOT. Over time she got better and better and now she&#39;s pretty good  <br/>
at it. No lessons.<br/>

I don&#39;t think this is true.  It may not be as important as it used to be, but in the business world at least, it doesn&#39;t look very good to send out memos with misspelled words.  Yes, there is spell check, but it&#39;s not always available.<br/>

I&#39;m not saying that there aren&#39;t ways to get around not being able to spell well.  I just don&#39;t think that saying &quot;spelling isn&#39;t important&quot; is a totally true statement for most people.  To me that&#39;s like saying &quot;knowing basic math isn&#39;t important.&quot;  Some things ARE important.  It doesn&#39;t mean that we have to shove things down our kids&#39; throats or hand out worksheets for them to complete, but pretending they don&#39;t matter doesn&#39;t make it so, IMO. <br/>

And, I believe there are hand-held spellcheckers, about the size of <br/>

couldn&#39;t do it unassisted, he could carry something like this(plus spare <br/>

 <br/>
People have different and differing abilities.  NOT everyone who  thinks <br/>
spelling might be important to the will have the same spelling abilities  or <br/>
talent.  Not everyone would have the ability to learn to spell to the  same extent.<br/>
 <br/>
Not everyone could learn to be a bookkeeper to the same extent, nor to  sail <br/>
sailboats, nor to rope calves, nor to play tennis.<br/>
 <br/>
Some people&#39;s abilities are greater than others&#39; in various  areas.<br/>
 <br/>
The ability to spell is not necessary to anyone&#39;s future.  Some people  spell <br/>
well and easily.  Holly notices typos and cares.  We just got  e-mail from a <br/>
college student friend who misspelled something.  Holly  knew.  We both <br/>
understood it.  It was just e-mail, and it doesn&#39;t  matter.  <br/>
 <br/>
I started to say as long as some people can spell, they can spell for the  <br/>
rest of us, but if it were to evolve somehow to the point that NOone could  <br/>
spell, then there would be nobody to catch typos and it wouldn&#39;t matter anymore.  <br/>

all that important.  Really, in the english language, people used to <br/>
make their own ways to spell things on how they thought they sounded <br/>
and everyone spelled things a little differently based on their own <br/>
interpretation of the word.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine told me that in Germany, they have decided to go <br/>
with that again.  They no longer make everyone spell everything the <br/>
same in schools.  This was in a large part due to the fact that so <br/>
many non-german speaking people weren&#39;t able to pass the tests and <br/>
such to graduate, largely due to things like spelling.<br/>

important in order to learn to spell properly.<br/>
<br/>
Spelling is inherently useful. When someone finds it useful and  <br/>
meaningful for them personally, they&#39;ll figure out how to spell  <br/>
(either by memorizing or using a spellchecker or asking someone to  <br/>
proofread or whatever gets the job done.)<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was writing things for herself she didn&#39;t much care  <br/>
about spelling. The point was just to put the thoughts down on paper.  <br/>
Now that she&#39;s communicating with others, she is more aware of  <br/>
spelling and uses spellcheck or asks just because spelling the  <br/>
standard way is useful.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are less likely to care about spelling if others equate a lack  <br/>
of ability to spell with not caring about spelling and so take the  <br/>
opportunity to tell the child how important spelling is.<br/>
<br/>
And some people just can&#39;t spell. There does seem to be a spelling  <br/>
gene. There are loads of professional people who went through school  <br/>
with all it&#39;s spelling tests and messages about how important  <br/>
spelling is who can&#39;t spell and they do just fine. (My guess is that  <br/>
not all of them are naturally untalented spellers. Some might just be  <br/>
late bloomers who were pressured and shamed about spelling and  <br/>
decided spelling just wasn&#39;t important in order to protect themselves.)<br/>
<br/>
If you could barely draw a stick figure and every time someone saw  <br/>
one of your stick figures they took the opportunity to tell you how  <br/>
important it is to draw well how motivated would you be to draw better?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not necesarily.  I often miss typos in reading because I&#39;m reading for content and meaning and not focusing on spelling.  Emails come through lists like this all the time with poor spelling or grammar, yet it is usually quite easy to figure out what the person is saying.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t take this to mean that I don&#39;t think spelling matters.  I just don&#39;t think it is the highly critical thing that some people would like us to believe.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to find them on the internet, but I have received several emails over the years with words purposely mispelled or repeated.  Most people when they read these phrases are quite able to read what it means.  Does anyone have any of these handy?  A friend sent me one recently in which &quot;they&quot; have decided to simplify English spelling by deleting letters with the same sound.  For instance, we don&#39;t need both &quot;c&quot; and &quot;k&quot;.  The email is a joke, and by the end of it the words are not spelled &quot;correctly&quot; but it is easy enough to read them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
This ability to gloss over mistakes is important to consider in editing.  A friend (in his 70s) said that in college they used to edit papers by going from the end to the beginning one word at a time.  Otherwise, they would read right over mispellings because their mind knew what it was supposed to be and didn&#39;t always see what it was.  This was in the days before word processors and spell check.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve discussed the role of editors with my kids.  We like to catch typos in published materials.<br/>

Kirby doesn&#39;t much care.<br/>
Marty doesn&#39;t spell as well as Holly does, but is willing to be corrected.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is that none of them has any emotion attached to it, or shame.<br/>

She&#39;s happiest when it&#39;s not her typo. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Me, I know that misspellings are moral failings, a sign of laziness, a lack <br/>

That is WAY, way (way) too much to attach to mixing up the spellings of desert <br/>

Hint, it is from one of the songs in Disney&#39;s Beauty and the Beast.  Lisa was in this production recently with our local children&#39;s theater, and Jackie and I ran the concessions and watched almost every show.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of a cast member drew black and white sketches of the main characters and sold them for 50 cents a set.  We picked up a couple.  The girls spent quite a while today coloring them in.  Lisa is making a scrapbook of her experience of being in the play.  Jackie wrote the words above on the sketch of Belle that she had colored.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was interesting in light of the recent spelling conversation.  Jackie is 10 and has just started reading in the past few months.  She loves to write, so I spend a lot of time telling her how to spell things.  This time, though, she didn&#39;t ask for help - just wrote it down.<br/>
<br/>
Another tiny note is that our local McDonalds advertised the play on their reader board.  We stopped to take a photo for Lisa&#39;s scrap book.  They mispelled the name of the school where the play is showing.  It is Chief Joseph, but they spelled it Cheif.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148874091">Funny, there is one more spelling-related thing that Jackie did yesterday.  The girls were ready for bed and I came in to read to them.  Jackie (10) had been writing in a notebook and asked if she could use the computer in that room to type something.<br/>
<br/>
She had written a poem.  She typed it all up on one line, then typed/wrote a second poem.  She asked one or two questions about spelling while she was doing it.<br/>
<br/>
She read the poems to us, then asked me to look at the spelling.  I did, and explained that the words underlined in red were misspelled.  She was amazed and thought that was just the coolest thing!<br/>
<br/>
She started a third poem and was going to use spell check as she wrote each word.  Lisa (12) said it&#39;s easier to write it first, then go back and fix the spelling.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are new to unschooling, I will add that these are girls who have never had a &quot;spelling lesson&quot;.  All of their writing and spelling has been when they have chosen to write something and chosen to ask how to spell something.  Both will sometimes ask me how to spell a word, then stop me before I finish spelling it for them, saying, &quot;oh, I know that one&quot;.<br/>

listening five times and writing like crazy.    <br/>

Dictaphone.   Do they make dictaphones for CDs?   Foot pedals for boomboxes?<br/>

me: someone without the baggage is so much more likely to choose to <br/>
work on a &quot;weakness&quot; than those of us with baggage! <br/>
<br/>
Personally, my spelling has improved now that I just keep a browser <br/>
window open and google words I&#39;m not sure of. Google so politely <br/>
asks &quot;did you mean...&quot; so I don&#39;t feel bad! Many, many years of <br/>
schooling and being corrected not-so-nicely didn&#39;t help neary as <br/>
much.<br/>

A friend of mine told me that in Germany, they have decided to go <br/>
with that again.  They no longer make everyone spell everything the <br/>
same in schools.  This was in a large part due to the fact that so <br/>
many non-german speaking people weren&#39;t able to pass the tests and <br/>
such to graduate, largely due to things like spelling.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I have serious doubts about this. German is VERY phonetic! I can&#39;t imagine Germany passing---or even *considering*---something like this. Conjugating the verbs and declining the nouns ---well, THAT&#39;s another issue! &lt;G&gt; But I don&#39;t think spelling would ever become a problem in Germany. <br/>
