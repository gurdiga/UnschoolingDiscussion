<div id="ygrps-yiv-314256448">I&#39;m interested in families&#39; experiences with children learning how to <br/>
play musical instruments when the parents themselves do not play.  I <br/>
want to provide my children with the opportunities to learn how to <br/>
play various musical instruments, but am concerned that because <br/>
neither I nor my partner really play an instrument that my children <br/>
may lack some good opportunities to learn how.  I know there are lots <br/>
of options, classes, lessons, and learning to play along with the <br/>
child.  I am interested in personal stories for inspiration and <br/>
preparation...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insight!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-436597565">I have 2 wonderful examples. I do not play any instruments, just sing. <br/>
My 18 yo son plays guitar and writes songs. My 14 yo son has been <br/>
playing the drums since he was 11. They both showed interest in music <br/>
about 3 to 4 years ago. When the drummer expressed interest in learning <br/>
drums, we got him a practice pad and found someone who could show him <br/>
the basics. We also checked a really neat book out from the library <br/>
called 100 rock drum rhythms or some such thing. It had an audio CD with <br/>
it. We talked a lot about what he was learning and that often led to me <br/>
recommending different musicians he could listen to, Neal Peart of Rush <br/>
is one that comes to mind. we found someone who did play that was <br/>
willing to spend a little time with him each week. within a year, we had <br/>
to buy him a drum set for Christmas. The guitarist went through a <br/>
similar pattern. The big thing is they both chose to  practice and apply <br/>
what they were learning and it gave them a good foundation to build  <br/>
upon.  They now have a band together with another friend who plays bass. <br/>
At present they have played 2 shows and a local band has asked if they <br/>
can possibly open for them maybe this spring. If your child finds music <br/>
is what they want to do, there are lots of opportunities to learn, <br/>
sometimes you just have to get a little creative.<br/>
