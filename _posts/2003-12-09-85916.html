 <br/>
Sarah is working on reading a chapter book! We found this &quot;Brownie Girl Scout Book&quot; at the Treasure Chest one day awhile ago. We both forgot about it, so I&#39;ve not read it to her. She recently found it again, and today is working on reading it herself!! Her reading has really taken off lately, and I know finding books SHE&#39;S interested in has really helped. <br/>
