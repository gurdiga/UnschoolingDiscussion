<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744055666">It would appear the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not exaggeration to say that the undecided could go one way or<br/>
another.&quot; - George Bush, Former President of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have opinions of my own - strong opinions - but I don&#39;t always agree<br/>
with them.&quot; - George Bush, Former President of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
And the shining example himself &lt;g&gt;:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It isn&#39;t pollution that&#39;s harming the environment.  It&#39;s the impurities in<br/>
our air and water that are doing it.&quot; - Former Vice President Dan Quayle <br/>
(Right on Danny!)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I love California.  I practically grew up in Phoenix.&quot; - Former Vice<br/>
President Dan Quayle.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If we don&#39;t succeed, we run the risk of failure.&quot; - Dan Quayle.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are ready for an unforeseen event that may or may not occur.&quot; - Dan<br/>
Quayle.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The loss of life will be irreplaceable.&quot; - Dan Quayle.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I was recently on a tour of Latin America, and the only regret I have is<br/>
that I didn&#39;t study my Latin harder in school so I could converse with<br/>
those people.&quot; - Dan Quayle.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What a waste it is to lose one&#39;s mind.  Or not to have a mind is being<br/>
very wasteful.  How true that is.&quot; - Dan Quayle (He always seems to outdo<br/>
himself.)<br/>
