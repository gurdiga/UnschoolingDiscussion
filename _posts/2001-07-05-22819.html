--&gt; It&#39;s Independence Day, the greatest single day<br/>
not only in our nation&#39;s history, but in the history<br/>
of modern civilization. But do American children know<br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
--&gt; Fox news reports that &quot;one in five U.S. teens doesn&#39;t<br/>
know from which country America declared its independence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--&gt; The article continues, &quot;&#39;When you look at these<br/>
numbers, it means that more than 5 million U.S. teenagers<br/>
don&#39;t understand the true meaning of Independence Day,&#39;<br/>
said Colin Campbell, president of the foundation that<br/>
runs Colonial Williamsburg, the restored 18th-century<br/>
capital.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--&gt; And why should they? Do teenagers--young adults<br/>
held in suspended animation--have the slightest taste of<br/>
independence in their own lives? Maybe, just maybe the<br/>
fault is not in the teenagers.<br/>
<br/>
--&gt; Give them Matthew Spalding&#39;s essay &quot;Independence<br/>
Forever: The 225th Anniversary of the Fourth of July&quot;<br/>
or better yet read it aloud with your family. Make it a<br/>
tradition every July 4th. Don&#39;t wait for your public<br/>
school personnel to do it. It may be a long wait.<br/>

the Independent Institute in Oakland are sponsoring an<br/>
evening discussion on public education--&quot;Why Are the Public<br/>
Schools Failing and What Can Be Done about It.&quot; Authors<br/>

--&gt; Bilingual opponents are making progress in Colorado,<br/>
the Rocky Mountain News reports. (California opponents<br/>
have gained ground recently, too.) Bilingual is out,<br/>
&quot;sheltered English immersion&quot; is in. That&#39;s one year<br/>
bilingual followed by sink or swim. Leave it to<br/>
public school employees to come up with such a term.<br/>
<br/>
--&gt; But should parents be forbidden from having their<br/>
children taught in whatever language they want? I am required<br/>
by law to teach my children in English. What would Patrick<br/>
Henry say about this? More on this next time...<br/>
<br/>
--&gt; And this from--where else?--California: A bill to<br/>
create a new statewide cursive handwriting competition to<br/>
encourage good penmanship. &quot;&#39;Not every young person is going<br/>
to grow up to be a doctor,&#39; joked the author, state senator Ross<br/>
Johnson. He said schools have been neglecting penmanship<br/>
&quot;in the rush to use technology.&quot;[AP] Wow, a state senator<br/>
and a comedian, too. Look out Jay Leno...<br/>

The Battle for Image<br/>
by Cathy Cuthbert<br/>
<br/>
Mom Held in Killing 5 Kids: Children May Have Died in Tub<br/>
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle<br/>
June 27, 2001Houston TX--In a heart-rending case that<br/>
may stem from postpartum depression, a Clear Lake woman<br/>
who attempted suicide in 1999 was charged in the deaths<br/>
of her five children Wednesday amid shocking evidence<br/>
that she drowned them at home in a bathtub. . .<br/>
<br/>
In &quot;The Revolution Was&quot; Garet Garrett tells us that<br/>
&quot;Lasswell and Blumenstock, in World Revolutionary Propaganda,<br/>
define propaganda as &#39;the manipulation of symbols to control<br/>
controversial attitudes.&#39; Symbols they define as &#39;words and<br/>
word substitutes like pictures and gestures.&#39; And the purpose<br/>
of revolutionary propaganda &#39;is to arouse hostile attitudes<br/>
toward symbols and practices of the established order.&#39;&quot;<br/>
(People&#39;s Pottage, Truth Seeker Books 1992, p. 26.)<br/>
<br/>
There can be no doubt whatsoever that over my lifetime,<br/>
the revolutionary propaganda flame thrower has been turned on<br/>
full blast and aimed squarely at human familial relationships.<br/>
I will not use the hackneyed phrase &quot;traditional family<br/>
values&quot; because it is silly. It implies that familial<br/>
relationships are mere habit handed down from previous<br/>
generations and not based on the nature of our species.<br/>
After all, values can change and habits can be broken.<br/>
<br/>
No, it isn&#39;t traditional family values that have been<br/>
in the revolutionary cross hairs, but the biological basis<br/>
of the family itself. In one generation&#39;s time, popular<br/>
sentiment toward the biological role of parents has<br/>
reversed so completely that it is now possible for a<br/>
editorial writer to seriously suggest that mothers who<br/>
stay home with their children to learn and work and live<br/>
their lives as a family are holding them &quot;captive.&quot;<br/>
Despite the long history of the human race throughout<br/>
which children have spent their days at their parents&#39;<br/>
side, such an arrangement can now be called aberrant,<br/>
isolating, prison-like.<br/>
<br/>
How did this happen? It wasn&#39;t via a direct attack on<br/>
motherhood, as any bespectacled revolutionary would know<br/>
is impossible. Rather, other symbols were manipulated.<br/>
The image of the suited, executive woman dropping her<br/>
children off at daycare at 6:45 am on her way to work<br/>
comes to mind. The image of a dozen or so pre-school<br/>
children playing in a well-stocked, primary-colored<br/>
activities room under the watchful care of a certified<br/>
expert is another. The image of the homeschool mother<br/>
is yet a third.<br/>
<br/>
These three key images are the main battleground in the<br/>
human familial relationship propaganda war. The revolutionaries<br/>
have had it all their way for 25 years or so. To most<br/>
people, executive mom and institutionalized pre-schooler<br/>
have become positive images and the homeschool mother<br/>
has become at best a tarnished one. But lately, some<br/>
inconvenient facts have been tripping the revolutionaries<br/>
up. A growing number of executive moms are realizing<br/>
that having a full-time career translates into being<br/>
less than even a part time mother. A recent study hinted<br/>
at what every stay-at-home mother knows, that children<br/>
who spend most of their time confined in a room with<br/>
agemates exhibit behavior problems as a result. And an<br/>
impressive amount of research and anecdotal evidence<br/>
show that homeschooling is successful.<br/>
<br/>
Still, the war goes on and we homeschool mothers are<br/>
keenly aware that it will never end. Just one year<br/>
ago, I wrote:<br/>
<br/>
    Surely, the legislation is already written and<br/>
    waiting for the perfect situation-a violently<br/>
    abusive, mass murdering, crack addict of a<br/>
    [homeschooling] parent found holdup in a house<br/>
    with half a dozen twisted, little skeletons buried<br/>
    in the basement. The neighbors say, &quot;They seemed<br/>
    like a nice family, kind of quiet. Said they homeschool.<br/>
    We had no idea...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is no solace in being prophetic. Tonight, I<br/>
silently stood over my children, taking in their<br/>
peaceful faces as they dreamed their pleasant dreams,<br/>
and felt the sting of tears as I thought of what<br/>
happened in the Yates house that cruel morning. The<br/>
revolutionaries would have us believe that homeschooling<br/>
was the cause. So far, there have been two accusatory<br/>
editorials and, as a result, my inbox is jammed with<br/>
emails from homeschoolers across the country all saying<br/>
essentially the same thing-&quot;Brace yourselves, here it<br/>
comes.&quot; We all knew it would.<br/>
<br/>
It is the measure of how thoroughly politicized our<br/>
culture has become that the heinous crimes of one woman,<br/>
drugged and in abject despair, can be used to cast doubt<br/>
on the quintessential image of motherhood that is<br/>
homeschooling. That the sacrifices homeschool families<br/>
make can be perversely twisted into selfishness-or<br/>
worse, abuse-lays plain the ferocity of the propaganda war.<br/>
<br/>
Is Froma Harrop&#39;s Seattle Times editorial <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorialsopinion/134311368_harrop28.html">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorialsopinion/134311368_harrop28.html</a> <br/>
<br/>
an ignorant rant or excellent piece of coldly<br/>
calculated revolutionary propaganda? It hardly matters<br/>
for the effect is the same. Homeschool mothers have<br/>
witnessed her attack and are now on the offensive. Harrop<br/>
is likely to get more mail in response to that one editorial<br/>
than she has for all her previous editorials combined,<br/>
as the battle for image endlessly drags on.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers are not deterred by bad press-we cannot<br/>
afford the luxury. Yet every day we wonder why we are<br/>
trapped in this battle that we did not start and never<br/>
wanted. Why are we demonized for sharing our lives with<br/>
our sons and daughters? Why has mother become a political<br/>
symbol rather than a warm and safe apparition who checks<br/>
on children in the night, and drops a kiss on their<br/>
foreheads as they sleep?<br/>

FINAL THOUGHT<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned with the increasing numbers of school<br/>
children who are experiencing burnout as they go through<br/>
the year in traditional schools. They struggle to<br/>
remain in an educational system that professes to care<br/>
about the individual child, but refuses to recognize<br/>
individual talents and overlooks potential individual<br/>
goals in the name of team effort. A principle that<br/>
seems to have been forgotten by those in the academic<br/>
world is that the child is a person first and a student<br/>
second. --Shirley M.R. Minster, &quot;Student Burnout - What&#39;s<br/>
at Stake?&quot;<br/>
