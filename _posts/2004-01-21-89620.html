<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I can see &gt;how the &quot;fear of reprisal&quot; is a pivotal issue. But, I&#39;m <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wondering how one would define &quot;fear of &gt;reprisal.&quot; What exactly <br/>
would that reprisal be? Eternal damnation? Is it possible to be truly <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;okay with the idea of one&#39;s children being eternally damned because <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a parent values the &gt;autonomy of their choices?<br/>
 <br/>
1 - When I read &quot;fear of reprisal&quot; I realized that the thread started <br/>
talking about Eternal Damnation - and yet I know all too well the <br/>
painful reprisals of my former church and some others.  Fear can be <br/>
of man or of the unseen.  People can exercise outward forms of their <br/>
religion because of a vague fear of hell, because of fear of being <br/>
humiliated or because of fear of being beaten, ostracized, etc.  <br/>
Interestingly enough, schools have throughout history employed the <br/>
same punishments.  And with the same results: either outright <br/>
rejection or else outward practice without understanding.<br/>
<br/>
2 - Because God himself is &quot;truly ok with&quot; us making our own choices <br/>
and allowing us to not choose Him, then I feel obligated to emulate <br/>
that to the best of my ability.  <br/>
<br/>
3 - Because Eternal Damnation is just not too real here, many <br/>
churches and control-freak leaders feel compelled to institute a hell-<br/>
on-earth. I spent many years in one.  Supposedly this will &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
people to avoid hell.  In my case it was successful - I learned to <br/>
avoid those people and groups.<br/>
<br/>
4 - I presume that emulating heaven will be more motivating to others <br/>
to want to learn about it and visit, eh?  And so, that&#39;s my job, when <br/>
I remember to do it.  I mostly remember to do it when I am not <br/>
obsessing about avoiding hell in the future, or obsessing about the <br/>
people who have tried to make my life into a living hell in the <br/>
past.  Now, as for teaching children, I&#39;d presume that unschooling <br/>
them toward their natural positive interests and gifts would be a lot <br/>
more likely to interest them in eternal happiness.  There is this <br/>
Bible verse, &quot;Parents, do not irritate your children.&quot;  Hmmmmmm<br/>
<br/>
It may have been already said, but unschoolers who also believe in <br/>
Christ are getting &quot;it&quot; from both sides, as to whether one can <br/>
unschool and &quot;be a Christian&quot;.  Ironic.  harsh!<br/>
<br/>
The only mention I know of in the Bible regarding &quot;unschooled&quot; is a <br/>
positive one, and the term &quot;Christian&quot; was coined to be derogatory, <br/>
and is not a Biblical term.  So hey, why not?<br/>
<br/>
I just hope we can avoid the &quot;What and who really is unschooling?&quot; <br/>
discussion, pretty please? It is sooooooo boring and we only find out <br/>
in the end that no one is &quot;not doing school&quot; quite perfectly enough <br/>
for the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t learn of &quot;original sin&quot; in my childhood church either.  <br/>
Later I reconciled the concept more like &quot;nobody&#39;s perfect&quot;.  <br/>
Certainly my compassionate honesty with my child will cover those <br/>
times that I am hurt, disappointed, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If we are both travelling to the city on the train, can&#39;t we just <br/>
make interesting conversation together on the way?  I see unschooling <br/>
and faith as simultaneous journeys to a distant location.  I tend to <br/>
see and talk to those who are coming &quot;from&quot; a place near me, and yet <br/>
I also might encourage someone else to make the trip, and they might <br/>
have to take a completely different mode of transportation or route.<br/>
<br/>
As to the large Christ-Centered Unschooling list (CCU-List) -- well, <br/>
it *is* a resource -- maybe for those coming from a certain direction <br/>
into that city I just referred to.  It&#39;s a research and fun-oriented <br/>
group for encouragement, quite a diverse group.  However, there are <br/>
no archives and it often has a high volume of mail.  There are many <br/>
other lists that are also Christian Unschooling resources.  One other <br/>
large one is the &quot;Delight-Driven&quot; list, and then there is a weekly <br/>
Christian unschooling chat, too, on www.HomeschoolChat.us<br/>
<br/>
Sandra mentioned priorities.  I&#39;d say that due to my divorce I had to <br/>
turn to unschooling to survive in a shark-pool of other priorities, <br/>
and so my kids could see their dad and lower their own stress.  One <br/>
person can only do so much, and schools more and more looked like <br/>
places to be avoided. So I would have been a failure as a mom for not <br/>
making them attend and do schoolwork, or a failure as a mom for not <br/>
doing school-at-home because I just plain couldn&#39;t take the time, or <br/>
else I could listen to my children&#39;s gifts and my own talents and we <br/>
could enjoy each other&#39;s company.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and my faith both hold IMHO that we  - child and adult -  <br/>
are equals learning together; are all, in fact, children with so much <br/>
more to learn and so much growing to do.<br/>
<br/>

I think that&#39;s the one thing that hasn&#39;t been said.  Good point.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers get grief from outside AND inside the homeschooling world.  I <br/>
hadn&#39;t thought that Christian unschoolers have it from four directions, then.   <br/>

That IS harsh!<br/>

with you.  Never felt dissed in any way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true, though, as happyadvocate pointed out, that<br/>
Christian unschoolers get from the christian community<br/>
&quot;you are sinning, you are too permissive, you need to<br/>
read these scriptures again because they really<br/>
say...&quot; and then we get from the secular unschooling<br/>
community, &quot;I don&#39;t think you can unschool if you hold<br/>
these beliefs&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Now try being a family that is christian, unschooler,<br/>
1/2 vegetarian and who follow the Feingold program for<br/>
kids with food additive allergies.<br/>
<br/>
I long ago realized that I would never ever find a<br/>
&quot;support group&quot; in which this square peg fits, and<br/>
that it was ok.  A support group of one, or a member<br/>
of many different ones, I&#39;ve done it both ways.  It&#39;s<br/>
all good.<br/>

It&#39;s like we are pariahs no matter where we go. No one in either camp <br/>
is ever really comfortable with us (or so it seems).  So to one camp <br/>
they call into question our very faith, the other camp calls into <br/>
question our life philosophy. Ugh! (BTW, I am not saying this to <br/>
anyone who is truly curious. Just to anyone who would make snap <br/>
judgements about christian unschoolers.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***Kelly, thanks for your concern.  I agree with WifeToVegMan.  I&#39;d <br/>
also say that you express yourself well, so I did understand your <br/>
questions to *be* questions.  After I hit &quot;send&quot; I thought I should <br/>
have added that reassurance. No prob here.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I enjoyed participating in the interchange.  Questions help <br/>
me to think, to phrase my thoughts, and to limit my ramblings <br/>
(somewhat Ha!).<br/>
<br/>
I have found other threads in the past on this list to seem very <br/>
harsh (IMHO) towards the professed Christians.  I am hoping this gap <br/>
is narrowing or the people softening some.  (I do not mean you, <br/>
Kelly, and I doubt by your current tone that you had anything to do <br/>
with that, so I am not directing this at you.) <br/>
<br/>
Having been beaten (literally and verbally) in my own (former) <br/>
church, I self-diagnosed as PTSD and tend to get &quot;gun-shy&quot; if I feel <br/>
targeted, especially by more than one individual at a time.  Which <br/>
was why I stayed a member here and said little or nothing for a long <br/>
time. It&#39;s real easy to get rid of me!  I just set this aside and <br/>
figured I&#39;d read archives if I needed something.  But see, you <br/>
(Kelly) didn&#39;t scare me off ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Back to the topic:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling gives us - my sons and I - the freedom to exit when <br/>
needed.  There are so many positive reasons to unschool, towards our <br/>
gifts and interests.  There are also many, many different injuries <br/>
and disabilities which give people reasons to move away from <br/>
something.  An example would be my youngest, who was in a private <br/>
school and was assigned to write an autobiography.  He began asking <br/>
me questions and learned about &quot;the beating&quot; and immediately decided -<br/>
 stated clearly that - he did not want to write about his dad. He <br/>
told the teacher that he had been planning to write his <br/>
autobiography &quot;when I am 32&quot; and was not going to change that <br/>
decision now.  (Somehow the sweatheart &quot;got away with it&quot; and I <br/>
pulled him out later when he was beaten at lunch.)<br/>
<br/>
Attending The Evergreen State College (TESC), we wrote &quot;self-<br/>
evaluations&quot;.  The process was as educational as anything I have ever <br/>
done.  I was able to resurrect my self-esteem from a complete and <br/>
total failure to do a planned project, by explaining that once inside <br/>
the research, I realized the field was already completely covered, <br/>
and there was no point in rewriting it.  I don&#39;t think I mentioned <br/>
that that would have been really BORING!  But I didn&#39;t have to, <br/>
because I had taken a different tangent at that point and written <br/>
something new, so my work was accepted for the credit.  I had already <br/>
gone through this process because I was interested in my topic and I <br/>
have to laugh at myself for going on to the interesting topic, and <br/>
then later &quot;worrying&quot; about the credit!  That, to me, is the gift of <br/>
unschooling.  And a gift I can give to my children, to my students <br/>
when hired to help people, and to MYSELF.  The gift of being able to <br/>
do something interesting!<br/>
<br/>
I think the term &quot;learning&quot; has been hijacked by the institutions.  <br/>
And I just realized that we keep playing into their hands by using it <br/>
from the view inside the school box.  Kids aren&#39;t &quot;learning&quot; (!?) <br/>
Well, kids are always seeking to learn and so they are either <br/>
learning things we didn&#39;t plan to teach them, or they are bored <br/>
because they aren&#39;t given nourishment for their brains and personal <br/>
growth.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Learning&quot; in psychological terms is defined as a change in <br/>
behavior.  I look at it from inside the learning person - looking out <br/>
at the world.  If I (the student) change my behavior then I <br/>
have &quot;learned&quot; something.  Sometimes I like the change in myself and <br/>
sometimes I get help to overcome a &quot;lesson&quot; that came from a negative <br/>
experience.  Once I &quot;know how to learn&quot; I can self-regulate <br/>
my &quot;lessons&quot;.  If I don&#39;t like that I am angry from being abused, for <br/>
example, then I can research ways to calm down, forget it, or recycle <br/>
that energy, like helping others or writing.  I exercise, therefore, <br/>
some conscious control over what I am learning.<br/>
<br/>
The institutionalized term, &quot;learning&quot; looks from inside the adults <br/>
and committees out at the student.  It compares behavior to their <br/>
stated goals, and if there *is* a change in behavior that wasn&#39;t on <br/>
the list, then it is &quot;not learning&quot;.  That, however, is inconsistent <br/>
with Psychologist&#39;s terms.  (There is a  movement amongst the <br/>
teaching profession for it to become a &quot;science&quot; &lt;g&gt; but I have never <br/>
heard it mentioned that this would require reconciliation of concepts <br/>
and terminology with other sciences.)  Anyway, such measurements have <br/>
nothing to do with my life or yours, nor that of any given student.  <br/>
And any learning, real though it may be, that wasn&#39;t on the <br/>
institutional list, doesn&#39;t &quot;count&quot;.  Except, in my experience, at <br/>
TESC.  And then, my &quot;Christian&quot; faith was criticized and not <br/>
accepted, so I was once again marching to a different drummer.  It <br/>
seems I always am!<br/>
<br/>
Washington law allows a teacher to write an evaluation of a student <br/>
as an annual option to standardized testing.  What I love about this <br/>
process is being able to find and record and encourage the <br/>
individual &quot;learning&quot; that was so important to the homeschool parent <br/>
and child but which may have been otherwise lost or &quot;not counted&quot;, if <br/>
not queried on a test or forgotten due to stress.<br/>
<br/>
On this list this week, tt has been fulfilling to be able to have an <br/>
intellectual discussion about what is necessarily (and shoudl be!) an <br/>
extremely emotional topic - freedom, personal growth, and parenting!  <br/>
There are no roadmaps here.  <br/>
<br/>
As to defining:  I asked about not &quot;doing&quot; that discussion.  I love <br/>
discussing the examples and ideas and etc., but I won&#39;t be letting <br/>
any unschooler tell me what to think or believe, or who I &quot;am&quot; or <br/>
whether I can use a certain word or term, any more than I will let <br/>
the PS so dictate.  There is a way of discussing, as Sandra said, <br/>
what is &quot;not&quot; unschooling, but then are we talking about achieving <br/>
freedom, or including moving towards freedom; and if the latter, for <br/>
a minute, an hour, a day, a year?  <br/>
<br/>
I like discussing the details, the research, comparisons, and <br/>
sharing.  I detest legalism in any of its forms.  Yes, we can ditch <br/>
schooling or ditch Christ and still be legalistic! It&#39;s like trading <br/>
off one addiction for another - a common human event -  if we can not <br/>
see that our own lifelong institutionalization has made us seek to <br/>
impose structure on our efforts to be unstructured.  Maybe the grown <br/>
children who have not been institutionalized will be able to <br/>
objectively compare their experiences with those of others <br/>
and &quot;define&quot; what we do (or do not do.)<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of the CCU-List, there are no &quot;experts&quot; there to tell <br/>
the group members how they should think or believe.  It&#39;s just <br/>
peachy, if you ask me.  If I can develop that kind of friendships and <br/>
equality here I&#39;d stay I suppose, if I can manage to do all this <br/>
reading!  <br/>
<br/>
For now, it&#39;s intellectually interesting  ;-)  (and not emotionally <br/>
painful)<br/>
<br/>

a &quot;real, live person&quot; to talk to once in a while. Not to say that <br/>
you guys aren&#39;t great!!! LOL.  My schedule makes it almost <br/>
impossible to join one of the traditional groups inthe area. <br/>
<br/>
My son mentioned yesterday maybe going to school next year.  I <br/>
really think that if he had other homeschoolers/unschoolers to play <br/>
with on a regular basis, he wouldn&#39;t feel like he was missing out on <br/>
something at school. Sigh.  I try not to let it get to me when he <br/>
says these things. He&#39;s only just started getting used to <br/>
unschooling but it does make me question myself.  I want to do what <br/>
is best for him, but he doesn&#39;t really know what he wants.  He is <br/>
only seven.  He likes the novelty of school, but he hates homework <br/>
and tests.  He likes the freedom he has at home, but misses being <br/>
around other kids. At the same time he was going to the school for <br/>
music and art and PE until recently and told me he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
go anymore because the kids make too much noise and they don&#39;t <br/>
really get to do much.  So I said that&#39;s fine and he could choose if <br/>
he wanted to go or not.  <br/>

But that&#39;s internal to you and shouldn&#39;t affect what you want happening <br/>

<br/>
If someone tells you what to believe (meaning what they think you should <br/>
believe) they have no way to enforce that, or even to determine if your thinking <br/>
did change.<br/>
<br/>
So saying you don&#39;t want that to happen is just kind of talking to yourself <br/>
(out loud to 1400 readers &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is a way of discussing, as Sandra said, <br/>

<br/>
Some people spend a minute there and get scared and run back to the fold.<br/>
<br/>
Some see the freedom only in academic terms.  Some let it ooze into every <br/>
pore of their  being.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter.  We&#39;re talking about talking about it, and what people <br/>
take away from the discussions is beyond the power of any committee or democratic <br/>
governing body or gestapo to control.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking about ideas.<br/>
Take &#39;em or leave &#39;em.  Think them or think about something else.<br/>
