<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819092672">We just added a David Gutterson book to our arsenal of unschooling/natural <br/>
learning materials for our resource table at the weekly group get together.<br/>
What a voice!  The very first thing that caught my eye was how school is such <br/>
a driving force in our society...I&#39;ll have to read more later.<br/>
It will be a big help to the families coming to our group for information....<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
