<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143009219"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Here the AEP are programs by the district to entice new homeschooler <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and suck them back into the system were they (the district) have the <br/>
control. And then to tell the bold face lie that you are still a <br/>
homeschooler.   &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d made that choice it would be your choice. If you didn&#39;t choose to <br/>
participate, then you didn&#39;t. Either way, it wouldn&#39;t mean someone else <br/>
should tell you that you&#39;re not a real homeschooler, especially in the rest <br/>
of the homeschooling world where MANY people are enrolled (voluntarily) in <br/>
controlling programs - many of them private - and are still considered part <br/>
of the homeschooling community. People voluntarily sign up for all kinds of <br/>
correspondence schools, for example, and still consider themselves part of <br/>
the homeschooling community. People buy the full Calvert Curriculum with <br/>
teacher support and do just what the teacher tells them to do and send their <br/>
kids papers in to be graded, but they still consider themselves part of the <br/>
homeschooling community. Shall we start telling them that they aren&#39;t real <br/>
homeschoolers since they&#39;ve given up so much control (and they PAY to give up <br/>
that control so they don&#39;t even have the excuse of getting free materials).<br/>
<br/>
What effect does telling people that they aren&#39;t real homeschoolers have on <br/>
those who choose the public school programs? Does it mean that the public <br/>
schools are going to shut down their programs and stop their nefarious <br/>
activities? <br/>
<br/>
No, but it isolates those people in those programs even more than the public <br/>
schools try to do already. It makes them leave open email lists when they <br/>
have to hear, yet again, that they&#39;re not real homeschoolers. The more <br/>
isolated they are, the LESS aware they will be of the importance of <br/>
maintaining the option to homeschool independently and that is <br/>
counterproductive.<br/>
<br/>
To tell people that are in certain programs that they aren&#39;t real <br/>
homeschoolers is hurtful for no good reason and it doesn&#39;t do anything at all <br/>
to reduce the possible negative impacts of the programs themselves.<br/>

If someone here is enrolled in The Family School and says &quot;we&#39;re <br/>
homeschooling,&quot; I will say right then and there, &quot;No, you&#39;re in an <br/>
alternative school program.&quot;  They are not only required to be in school <br/>
LOTS, but the parents are required to attend weekly meetings on perpetual <br/>
threat of the family being dropped from the program.   (&quot;We have a waiting <br/>
list, so we only want dedicated families.&quot;)  There&#39;s no &quot;home&quot; left.  The <br/>
families have much less autonomy and privacy than if the kids were in a <br/>
regular all-day program.<br/>
<br/>
If someone here is doing Calvert by mail, they can do all their work naked in <br/>
the middle of a Saturday night if they want to, and they can be at home.  And <br/>
the parents can help them as much as they want.  And they can do the work in <br/>
whatever order they want, and can speed up, slow down, personalize, take a <br/>
month off, go on vacation and take the work with them or not...  Calvert has <br/>
been practically the definition of &quot;homeschooling&quot; since before John Holt <br/>
believed in homeschooling.  I remember seeing the ads in the back of National <br/>
Geographic when I was a kid and imagining it to be only for shut-in, <br/>
bedridden or deformed children, or missionary families in Zimbabwe or up some <br/>
tributary of the Amazon.<br/>

If I was drinking coffee, I&#39;d have spewed! I believe this is exactly what my<br/>
Father thinks of homeschoolers! (Incidentally, He is very supportive but he<br/>
thinks I&#39;m weird)<br/>
