<div id="ygrps-yiv-840315412">Thanks for sharing all that about your new dog, Dar.<br/>
When I read what Julie wrote about how she had the &quot;perfect&quot; dog for you, I<br/>
was hoping you would get the dog.<br/>
I&#39;m glad it all worked out, for all of you!<br/>

&gt; Julie sent a post right about Nana, the border collie who had wandered up<br/>
&gt; to her porch a few months ago and needed a new place to live. We emailed<br/>
&gt; back and forth a few times, and Nana arrived at the Sacramento airport<br/>
&gt; last Tuesdays. Yes, we have a DOG!<br/>
