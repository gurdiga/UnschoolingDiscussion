<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931073446">Okay, my two cents.........<br/>
My father 64 yr. old, a dentist, went to college after eight years in air<br/>
force, they then paid for college and dental school and &quot;we&quot; served our<br/>
country, everywhere. Libya, Australia, France etc...After returning to the<br/>
states and opening a his private practice at age 37 with three kids, my<br/>
father earned between $50,000 and $65,000 for the next 25 years. We weren&#39;t<br/>
poor, or rich, quite comfortable was how I recall it. Upon deciding to<br/>
retire, my dad gave his practice, yes GAVE it to an outstanding young family<br/>
man. He had also &quot;earned&quot; his education through the military. He had three<br/>
children and made the honor roll frequently, despite working full time as a<br/>
student in the military. So, that part about greedy doctors and<br/>
dentists...careful....not everyone fits into all categories. By the way, my<br/>
father&#39;s associate retired two years before my father and sold his patients<br/>
records only for $200,000 My father stayed on at his practice for one year<br/>
to help transition his patients to the new &quot;young&quot; doctor. I only wish I<br/>
lived in Michigan still so he could be my dentist as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786335597">No offense but this sort of post is irritating, or at least part of it since<br/>
it is based on not reading what was written.  It is nice that your father<br/>
wasn&#39;t greedy.  However, I don&#39;t need to be &quot;careful....not everyone fits<br/>
into all categories,&quot; since that is precisely what I said.  Had you read<br/>
more carefully, you would have seen that I said &quot;I think a lot of&quot; which<br/>
does not mean that I think ALL doctors and dentists are greedy.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll add my two cents as well.<br/>
<br/>
As some of you may know, both my sons have some pretty serious health <br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
I would hardly call the doctors at the Hematology/Oncology Clinic at <br/>
Texas Children&#39;s Hospital greedy and/or lazy.  I was around these <br/>
wonderful people on a daily basis for months at a time.  They work very <br/>
hard and tirelessly to treat and cure many terrible illnesses.  Their <br/>
patient load is gets bigger on a yearly basis and they can&#39;t help but <br/>
get personally involved with the children and their families when they <br/>
see them on a daily basis battling some life-threatening disease.<br/>
<br/>
Their job is a very difficult and demanding one.  It&#39;s emotionally <br/>
draining and physically exhausting.  I recall many times when our bone <br/>
marrow/oncologist came in to check on his patients on his days off.  He <br/>
was there almost every single day even though his unit was covered by <br/>
another doctor.<br/>
<br/>
I have much respect for the quality of the care and the research (in the <br/>
labs)  as well as the enormous amount of time (including personal time) <br/>
they give to their patients.<br/>
<br/>
