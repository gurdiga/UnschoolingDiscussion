<br/>
       Wonderful as unschooling is, there&#39;s real stuff to watch out for, <br/>
however much we love and trust our maturing teens.  Because of unschooling, my <br/>
almost 14-year-old dd is better equipped for joyful abundance than most teens, <br/>
but she is not bullet-proof. <br/>
<br/>
       My dd and I agree that her life is authentic, and much richer and <br/>
better than the stereotypical teenager&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
       Her life also is different from other unschooled teens described in <br/>
this thread. She reads ALL the time, except when she&#39;s singing, dancing or <br/>
cooking, and doesn&#39;t care for video games, piercing or tattooing, OR organized <br/>
religion, or workbooks or academics, or the company or music of most people her <br/>
age.<br/>
<br/>
       And here&#39;s something silly (shaking my head) -- she says yes&#39;m and <br/>
nossir, all the time! We never asked or expected she would do this. My dh the <br/>
inveterate Yankee is completely baffled by her manners. <br/>
<br/>
       She might have picked this up somehow from our Southern town or from <br/>
wanting to be a character in Gone With the Wind -- the point is that it didn&#39;t <br/>
come from us.<br/>
<br/>
       Her little brother shows no such tendency toward manners &lt;g&gt; and of <br/>
course there are many large and small differences between them, which also <br/>
didn&#39;t come from us.<br/>
<br/>
    Unschooled teens live in reality with everybody else. Dd must deal with a <br/>
world full of communicable diseases, pathologies, prejudices and bad acts by <br/>
others, not to mention the biological reality of her own genetics and body <br/>
chemistry, such as hormones. <br/>
<br/>
       Add that to the sobering scientific finding that no matter how mature <br/>
and responsible unschooling helps my dd become, her prefrontal cortex won&#39;t be <br/>
completely developed until at least the end of her teens (even later for <br/>
boys.) <br/>
<br/>
       So I conclude that the self-control, judgment, and decision-making <br/>
critical to her safety and lasting happiness WILL be affected by an unpredictable <br/>
stew of such variables, rather than determined solely by our unschooling <br/>
lifestyle. Much as I wish otherwise!<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;m remembering now that I had more than one friend who grew up to <br/>
embrace homosexuality (not unschoolers because I&#39;d never heard of unschoolers <br/>
back then - lol - just lesbians! Does that makes unschooling the more extreme of <br/>
the two?) <br/>
<br/>
       I know of nothing in the way they were parented or schooled that <br/>
either caused -- or would have prevented -- it.<br/>
<br/>
       So how might we make a balanced, helpful &quot;principle&quot; for unschooling <br/>
parents out of this discussion of various teen behaviors, choices and risks?<br/>
<br/>
      This seems unlike the corporal punishment discussion, in which a <br/>
convincing case was made that unschooling and hitting as discipline don&#39;t mix. <br/>
That&#39;s something in the control of adults, to have no hitting. <br/>
<br/>
       But this is harder. Now we&#39;re talking about choices in control of <br/>
unschooling teens, not parents. <br/>
<br/>
       And (shudder) things beyond the control of anybody.   JJ<br/>

I&#39;m going to jump in here with a couple of guesses:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Julie S may be hoping JJ wasn&#39;t shuddering over the idea that some people<br/>
are homosexual.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
JJ seemed to be shuddering over the fact that there are scary things out in<br/>
the world that are outside of our control, such as life threatening diseases<br/>
and horrible individuals.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Am I right?<br/>

One doesn&#39;t *embrace* homosexuality, unless you mean coming to terms with <br/>
the sexuality one has been born with. There is nothing a parent can do to <br/>
cause or prevent homosexuality.<br/>

&gt; Right, it won&#39;t. We don&#39;t control much of anything. It&#39;s all a<br/>
&gt; journey and a pretty unpredictable one at that. My dad<br/>
&gt; afffectionately called his life with his self-directed offspring<br/>
&gt; a &quot;white-knuckle trip.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Sorry, but I don&#39;t have a clue what you hope you misunderstood. I did<br/>
&gt; try hard to be clear.  JJ<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well......um.......unschooling and parenting won&#39;t make you short<br/>
&gt; or tall<br/>
&gt; &gt; either.  And I don&#39;t get the &quot;shudder&quot; thing at all.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His life is NOT the stereotypical teenaged boy&#39;s life.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; richer, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; real, and it&#39;s better.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        Yes but. . . or should I say yes AND . . .<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        Wonderful as unschooling is, there&#39;s real stuff to watch<br/>
&gt; out for,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; however much we love and trust our maturing teens.  Because of<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling, my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; almost 14-year-old dd is better equipped for joyful abundance<br/>
&gt; than most<br/>
&gt; &gt; teens,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but she is not bullet-proof.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        My dd and I agree that her life is authentic, and much<br/>
&gt; richer and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; better than the stereotypical teenager&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        Her life also is different from other unschooled teens<br/>
&gt; described in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this thread. She reads ALL the time, except when she&#39;s singing,<br/>
&gt; dancing or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cooking, and doesn&#39;t care for video games, piercing or tattooing,<br/>
&gt; OR<br/>
&gt; &gt; organized<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; religion, or workbooks or academics, or the company or music of<br/>
&gt; most<br/>
&gt; &gt; people her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; age.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        And here&#39;s something silly (shaking my head) -- she says<br/>
&gt; yes&#39;m and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nossir, all the time! We never asked or expected she would do<br/>
&gt; this. My dh<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; inveterate Yankee is completely baffled by her manners.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        She might have picked this up somehow from our Southern<br/>
&gt; town or<br/>
&gt; &gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wanting to be a character in Gone With the Wind -- the point is<br/>
&gt; that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; come from us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        Her little brother shows no such tendency toward manners<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt; and of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; course there are many large and small differences between them,<br/>
&gt; which also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t come from us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     Unschooled teens live in reality with everybody else. Dd must<br/>
&gt; deal<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; world full of communicable diseases, pathologies, prejudices and<br/>
&gt; bad acts<br/>
&gt; &gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; others, not to mention the biological reality of her own genetics<br/>
&gt; and body<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; chemistry, such as hormones.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        Add that to the sobering scientific finding that no matter<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; mature<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and responsible unschooling helps my dd become, her prefrontal<br/>
&gt; cortex<br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; completely developed until at least the end of her teens (even<br/>
&gt; later for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boys.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        So I conclude that the self-control, judgment, and<br/>
&gt; decision-making<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; critical to her safety and lasting happiness WILL be affected by<br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; unpredictable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stew of such variables, rather than determined solely by our<br/>
&gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lifestyle. Much as I wish otherwise!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        I&#39;m remembering now that I had more than one friend who<br/>
&gt; grew up to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; embrace homosexuality (not unschoolers because I&#39;d never heard of<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschoolers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back then - lol - just lesbians! Does that makes unschooling the<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; extreme of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the two?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt;        So how might we make a balanced, helpful &quot;principle&quot;<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parents out of this discussion of various teen behaviors, choices<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; risks?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;       This seems unlike the corporal punishment discussion, in<br/>
&gt; which a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; convincing case was made that unschooling and hitting as<br/>
&gt; discipline don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; mix.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s something in the control of adults, to have no hitting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        But this is harder. Now we&#39;re talking about choices in<br/>
&gt; control of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling teens, not parents.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;        And (shudder) things beyond the control of anybody.   JJ<br/>

They don&#39;t have to do that at school.  Those life-problems seen from the <br/>
viewpoint and through the lens of school are magnified in unnatural ways.  They&#39;re <br/>
not analyzing those things with a group of people their own age who are <br/>
together because they couldn&#39;t afford private school and they happen to live in the <br/>
same neighborhood.<br/>

Because it&#39;s better for people to &quot;embrace&quot; their own genetic realities than <br/>
to reject them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; So how might we make a balanced, helpful &quot;principle&quot; for<br/>
<br/>
unschooling parents out of this discussion of various teen behaviors, choices <br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
risks?... <br/>
Now we&#39;re talking about choices in control of unschooling teens, not <br/>
parents.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This discussion won&#39;t make me change my principles.  My children are growing <br/>
up treated like people.  Young people, but the people they are and not &quot;people <br/>
they will become.&quot;  They&#39;re not &quot;teens&quot; in any hard-and-fast way.   Marty <br/>
Dodd is fourteen years old right now.  He&#39;s been raised with as much freedom as <br/>
he could have and still be safely where he wants to be since he was born.  He <br/>
have not pushed him away, and we haven&#39;t prevented his venturing out.  The same <br/>
way when he was learning to walk we let him walk away a bit if he wanted to <br/>
and he came back every time, we let him go out away from the house a bit if he <br/>
wants to and he comes back every time.<br/>
<br/>
The principle hasn&#39;t changed a bit.  The range and mobility have, but his <br/>
desire to live in the  peace and warmth and security to which he has become <br/>
accustomed have not changed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She . . .and doesn&#39;t care for . . . the company. . .of most<br/>
<br/>
people her age.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; social lives involve people younger and older.  Kirby&#39;s range is <br/>
13-30 these days. Kirby is 17.  Marty&#39;s 13-21 (his oldest regular friend is off <br/>
at college in another town, but when he&#39;s home they play games for hours; <br/>
Marty&#39;s 14), and Holly (12) has friends from six to 20.<br/>
<br/>
But because I&#39;m around kids their age (and other ages) many of whom are <br/>
homeschooled too and others of whom are in school, I DO have a current perspective <br/>
on the differences and in the advantages of homeschooling. Some of those <br/>
others who were traditionally schooled wouldn&#39;t be in such mixed-age social <br/>
situations if they hadn&#39;t started hanging around with my kids.  They like it.  Some <br/>
of them have a hard time at first not dismissing the younger people, but they <br/>
either change or wander off, usually.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard anyone claim unschooling is &quot;bulletproof&quot; so once again a <br/>
detractor is bringing up a previously unheard argument.  That&#39;s called &quot;a straw <br/>
man,&quot; and I really don&#39;t like it as a rhetorical device on this list.   <br/>
<br/>
If unschooling isn&#39;t better or best, let&#39;s disband the group and go and do <br/>
what we think IS best.   If I didn&#39;t think unschooling wasn&#39;t a better situation <br/>
than my freely-available alternatives, I wouldn&#39;t be doing it myself and sure <br/>
as hell wouldn&#39;t be spending this much energy helping others do it.<br/>
