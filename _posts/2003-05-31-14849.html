<div id="ygrps-yiv-875198690">Thought I&#39;d contribute to springtime happenings...<br/>
<br/>
Tim, my dh, and I were enjoying a cup of coffee this morning.   We are sitting just off our kitchen, next to our screen porch.  (Couldn&#39;t go out in the porch this a.m., too cool)   Anyway,,, I take a sip of coffee and lookup,  here, a hummingbird has flown right into the screen.   <br/>
<br/>
Ya see, last summer we hadn&#39;t finished the screen and they would fly right through.  We kept saying, &quot;oohh,  that porch is going to be a rude awakening for the hummingbirds!&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
He was stuck for maybe 20 seconds and visions of Flit (I think that was his name of the hummingbird in the movie Pocahontas) stuck in the canoe, came to mind.     It was pretty funny,  he&#39;s fine, went and drank from the feeder.    <br/>
<br/>
I know my tune would probably be different if he would have gotten hurt,  but he was so darn cute flying there,  then backing out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love watching those little birds!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-396305768">Last week my girls got to get up close and personal with a hummingbird, <br/>
which is very rare, but has happened twice to me.  They were out playing <br/>
in the back lawn and there was a hummingbird just sitting in the grass <br/>
and it didn&#39;t fly away.  They got to get right up to it and see all it&#39;s <br/>
colors.  This happened to me a few years ago on the steps going up our <br/>
back porch.  Each time, when I went to nudge the bird, it just flew <br/>
away.  I&#39;m pretty sure they were young and paralyzed with fear until my <br/>
hand coming at them startled them into motion.  But they really are <br/>
amazing creatures!  I love sitting in my screened porch just off my <br/>
kitchen, sipping coffee and watching the hummingbirds sipping off the <br/>
trumpet vine flowers that cover the side screen.  It&#39;s just awesome. <br/>
 Happy spring...and summer!  HeidiC.<br/>
