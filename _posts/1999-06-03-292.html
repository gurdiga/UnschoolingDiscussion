<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033616741">Lisa, This is a wonderful response!!  So many times I&#39;ve had to defend my<br/>
position on TV and other non-traditional forms of learning activities.   I<br/>
let my children watch all sorts of Movies, because their attention span has<br/>
grown huge leaps and bonds and it helps their imagination take off.  My<br/>
Three year old wants to learn all he can about Dinosaurs, and knows words<br/>
like Tyrannosaurus Rex, and Pterodactyl because of movies like Jurassic<br/>
Park, and We&#39;re Back.  Television has given me some of the best<br/>
opportunities to discuss things like being nice, getting frustrated, the<br/>
solar system and so much more with my 5 year old.  Shows like Blue&#39;s Clues<br/>
discusses EVERYTHING!  We love it.  The Disney Channel, Nick Jr. and the<br/>
Discovery channel are great discussion starters... heck even the dumb<br/>
cartoons from my childhood on the Cartoon network can start discussions on<br/>
things like how to react to dumb situations, and how cartoons have changed<br/>
with computer animation.  It&#39;s all about what you choose to discuss with<br/>
your kids.  The world is a tool, it doesn&#39;t have to be mind numbing!<br/>

&gt; vocabulary thing again).  Is he typing... um.. writing at all. Does he<br/>
