 </span></blockquote>The picture I formed in my head when I read this was, the government <br/>
regulating just how those vouchers are spent.  You don&#39;t just get <br/>
money without having to account for it.  Ideally we should get the <br/>
money for our children that is being spent on other citizens <br/>
children, but I don&#39;t see how that could come without a cost of <br/>
another kind.  I don&#39;t want to have to account to anyone and when you <br/>
accept money from the government, there is accountability.  Why would <br/>
we want to bring that on ourselves?  <br/>
I chose to take my children out of the system and i don&#39;t want <br/>
anything else to do with it.  Asking for our fair share comes with a <br/>
whole lot more than we are bargaining for.  there is no getting <br/>
around that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707065836">That could be dealt with, using a bit of political finesse. Of course just about everyone would agree that there have to be limits on how educational money could be spent. (If there&#39;s someone here who wants to try to justify parents spending their vouchers at Bob&#39;s House-&#39;O-Whiskey and the the !LIVE!GIRLS! Adult Book and Video store, don&#39;t let me stop you.) <br/>
 <br/>
There are ways to present this to the public so that they think they came up with the idea of restricting use of vouchers to &quot;regular&quot; bookstores, educational supply stores, curriculum vendors, etc. <br/>
 <br/>
There is one hitch, and that&#39;s that bugaboo about &quot;religious&quot; materials. Frankly, I think that lots of stuff that doesn&#39;t look &quot;religious&quot; can be shown to support one or another spiritual worldview (consider those Pagans who claim science and math as sacred arts), but it wouldn&#39;t bother me too much if the skittish public struck out such funding -- there&#39;s plenty of other stuff that parents could use that money for. <br/>
 <br/>
Parity would require all kids in a school district to be granted the same amount of money, depending maybe on age. Voters in the district would decide how much each kid got. Kids with special needs would be identified by the district (or to the district), and their needs would be met via a special fund. Schools would have no gain in over-identifying special needs kids, since they have no guarantee that their schools would get the money. <br/>
 <br/>
(Actually, to make this really work, all public school become charter schools, and no kids is ever automatically sent to a particular school. All  public schools in a given area -- say, a county -- are open-enrollment. And all compete with private schools.) <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been saying this on the Internet for more than 10 years now, but to this day I haven&#39;t been made Queen of the World, so it hasn&#39;t happened. (But I may get the crown any day now.) <br/>

When I was teaching I had $200 to spend.  Not much.  I thought hard.   Could <br/>
I buy Scrabble games?  SURE!  They handed me the approved-educational-supply <br/>
catalog from the company that takes vouchers.  $15 for the game.<br/>
<br/>
Can I go buy it at T,G & Y  (translate to &quot;Walmart,&quot; those of you too young)? <br/>
 <br/>
Oh no, they don&#39;t take vouchers.<br/>
<br/>
Can I buy something with a voucher and resell it and take the cash to a <br/>
thrift store and buy scrabble games?   <br/>
<br/>
What about inventory time?<br/>
<br/>
For the price of a scrabble game I got ten or so books from Scholastic, and <br/>
made a Password game with 3x5 cards.<br/>
<br/>
The whole &quot;you have to use a voucher&quot; scam is making the shareholders in some <br/>
educational supply companies richer than they need to be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, it wouldn&#39;t have to vouchers as such.  The program my son is <br/>
registered with gives the parents a small resource allowance each year.  We <br/>
have to spend the money and then send in receipts for reimbursement.  They <br/>
are quite flexible about what we can spend money on.  We&#39;ve gotten <br/>
printers, a scanner, and a CD burner.  We&#39;ve had sports and scouts <br/>
registrations paid for, as well as books and lessons.  The only things not <br/>
allowed are overt religious materials and supplies for classes.  They&#39;ll <br/>
pay for skating lessons, for instance, but not skates.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this would be difficult for low-income parents.  And it would <br/>
require a fair amount of bureaucracy.<br/>

I see vouchers as being a sort of Traveler&#39;s Cheque that can be spent almost anywhere, including Wal-Mart and any second-hand store that doesn&#39;t have a &quot;cash only&quot; policy.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree that the &quot;educational supply&quot; stores can be over-priced. I wonder how long they&#39;d keep their prices up (or stay in business) if the system were changed?<br/>

I know, but if it&#39;s government money to be spent to government specs, some <br/>
states could very easily say &quot;it has to be educational&quot; and that could limit <br/>
it to certain vendors.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-297588542">Of course toys are educational. It says so right on the box. Not to be flip, but I&#39;d bet the toy (or at least game) manufacturers would stand behind us on that one, and they have money and lawyers.  Their first argument might be, &quot;...and that&#39;s why our games are carried by X, Y, and Z educational supply companies.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Of course it&#39;d be a state-by-state battle, as is every educational issue. And certainly some of us would initially get a better deal than others. Just like homeschooling. <br/>
