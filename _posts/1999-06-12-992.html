&gt; He looked at us and said &quot;my ice falls whenever I get to a 30 degree<br/>
&gt; angle with the bottle&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  Does he have any theories on why that is?  Does it change as<br/>
the size of the ice changes, or did he stop doing it before he could see<br/>
that?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He didn&#39;t fill us in on any more. He took his ice outside and showed his<br/>
brother&#39;s hsed friend what he was doing then began to build a new computer<br/>
to sell... I&#39;m sure this won&#39;t be the last time that he will play with his<br/>
ice now that he&#39;s found it. <br/>
<br/>
BTW math games that he loves include monopoly, payday, racko, quadrice,<br/>
playing with the thinking puzzles for cuisenaire rods. One of our favorite<br/>
catalogs is Pig out on Math you can get a free catalog off the net. It&#39;s<br/>
filled with things like buckets of multi sided dice and books like those by<br/>
Marilyn burns. But my son touch a workbook? Right&lt;g&gt;<br/>
