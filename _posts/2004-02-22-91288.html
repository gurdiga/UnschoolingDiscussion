I wrote this a few weeks ago about this very thing:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Three Stages of Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
My son Cameron (16) and I recently started sitting in on a college Sociology <br/>
class. He asked for and received electric guitar lessons for his birthday. <br/>
Mondays he goes to a nearby school and takes African drumming lessons. He&#39;s <br/>
taking a weekly film class starting in March, and we&#39;ll be sending him to a <br/>
weeklong film school in Maine in May. Duncan (almost 8) just started karate lessons. <br/>
Ben (my husband) has just finished a class (with tests and all) that&#39;s <br/>
required before he can put on Lt Col (Air National Guard) and is now in NJ for three <br/>
weeks of &quot;rah-rah&quot; and classroom training and tests for the two new drugs he <br/>
will be selling. I&#39;m going to a one-day intensive &quot;Bee School&quot; to learn to take <br/>
care of my Christmas present: two beehives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron said the other day, &quot;For Unschoolers, we sure are taking a lot of <br/>
schooly classes!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
That got me thinking...especially since we are one of those families that <br/>
discovered unschooling after years and years of schooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I think that there are three &quot;Stages of Unschooling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Stage I<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
The first stage is the longest and most difficult and involves getting rid of <br/>
all school-think, which includes classes and &quot;instruction&quot; and school-speak. <br/>
We have to rid ourselves of the reliance on schools and teachers and testing <br/>
and book-worship. We need to look deeply into the difference between &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
and &quot;learn&quot;. We ban classes and structure and nagging. It&#39;s accepting that <br/>
grades and requirements and diplomas and curricula and extrinsic motivations truly <br/>
have no meaning in an unschooling life. It&#39;s realizing that the whole world is <br/>
related and inter-related: it&#39;s about NOT dividing the world into subjects: <br/>
math is science is art is history is literature is FUN! It&#39;s a time for <br/>
reflection on how we&#39;ve learned the things that really matter in our adult lives. <br/>
It&#39;s hard to let go of all that school-think, to go beyond what we&#39;ve been <br/>
*taught* was important and to value ALL learning as important.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s realizing that we learn what WE believe is important WHEN we are ready. <br/>
And it&#39;s realizing that what&#39;s important often changes. It&#39;s about abolishing <br/>
coercion in learning and about the freedom to change passions. It&#39;s <br/>
understanding that learning doesn&#39;t stop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Face it, almost all of you reading this in 2004 went to school---at least for <br/>
12 years, maybe as many as 22 or 25 years! School is so ingrained in us, that <br/>
it&#39;s hard to think any other way. We appreciate &quot;straight A students&quot; and <br/>
&quot;AP&quot; classes and college prep high schools and term papers and &quot;higher math&quot; and <br/>
high SAT/ACT scores. &quot;Good&quot; students are given preferential treatment by <br/>
everyone: pizzas for reading and Chuck E. Cheese tokens for good report cards. Even <br/>
our child&#39;s car insurance is lowered if we have an &quot;A student&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Stage one is about ridding our minds of those things, about really thinking <br/>
about learning in a holistic manner. It&#39;s about examining how we learned what <br/>
truly interests us---especially those things that didn&#39;t require a &quot;teacher&quot;. <br/>
What are your passions? HOW did you learn to do those things? In a classroom?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Two of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses are NOT <br/>
taught in any grade, middle, or high school *I* know of. But I wanted to learn <br/>
everything I could about them. My parents gave me dogs and horses. They bought <br/>
me books and paid for me to take riding lessons and dog obedience classes. <br/>
They paid for dog and horse shows and equipment. My passion threw me into <br/>
reading every book I could find (there were no videos back then----or &quot;Animal <br/>
Planet&quot;!). By twelve I could identify every breed of dog and horse that I had ever <br/>
seen or read about and tell you how it was developed, where, why, and by whom. <br/>
I spent every weekend and every afternoon at a dog show/horse show/event/trial <br/>
or just hanging around the stable or kennel. I asked thousands of questions <br/>
and &quot;got my hands dirty&quot;. Many of my friends were adults with the same <br/>
passions. Training, breeding, grooming, showing, husbandry----all of these things I <br/>
learned because I was consumed by them!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
But, of course, dogs and horses are NOT school subjects---and are completely <br/>
unimportant in the school world. What if I had waited for a teacher to come <br/>
along and say, &quot;Today we are learning all about dog and horses&quot;? Not only would <br/>
I have waited all my life, the teacher would only have given me a &quot;taste&quot; of <br/>
the subject!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
OH! And you *can&#39;t* make a living with dogs and horses---right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Stage one is often referred to as DEschooling. It&#39;s the period of time we <br/>
need to give ourselves in order to &quot;step away from the box&quot; of school and <br/>
school-think. Ask yourself why and how you learned your passion: whether it was <br/>
music, cooking, flying, gardening, or long-distance running. Or even more <br/>
&quot;academic-like&quot; passions, like Shakespeare, chemistry, World War II, or a foreign <br/>
language. When you are comfortable with how learning happens by indulging in <br/>
passions and making connections in your learning, you are quickly heading towards <br/>
stage two.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Stage II<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Once you are comfortable with the idea of immersion learning----and you&#39;re <br/>
over wanting or needing classes and structure, you&#39;re finally over the <br/>
deschooling hump and are actively in the process of UNschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Stage two involves really immersing ourselves----and allowing our children to <br/>
immerse themselves---into passions and even into slight, fleeting interests. <br/>
Seeing connections and making connections and yet realizing that some things <br/>
*might* not connect for YEARS is the most important part of stage two.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Connection: I remember lying in my bed when I was about 11 or 12. My bed was <br/>
behind the door, so that, when open, the door obscured the head of my bed. I <br/>
had tied a string to my doorknob. I would try to shut my door with my finger at <br/>
the point of the doorjamb; then I would open the door back up with a pull on <br/>
the string. It took *a lot* of pressure (and pain!) to close my door at the <br/>
point of the jamb. But every inch closer to the door knob I got, it would be <br/>
easier and easier to close, so that by the time I was right at the edge of the <br/>
door (by the knob), I could almost &quot;blow&quot; it shut. I had &quot;discovered&quot; <br/>
torque----but it had no name!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
School&#39;s idea that children should be given the definition of torque and then <br/>
have it explained is backwards. It was so simple for me to understand the <br/>
definition of torque because I already had made the personal and meaningful <br/>
connection with my bedroom door.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Passion: There are people who invest their time (and many even make a living) <br/>
studying Elizabethan fashion or reading/writing about the works of John <br/>
Steinbeck or determining whether an 17th century chair is a forgery or watching <br/>
birds make nests/feed their young or , as I heard on the radio yesterday: there&#39;s <br/>
this guy who&#39;s getting his Masters degree in Soil Science! Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
If allowed (and often, even if not allowed!), a child will pursue his career <br/>
by following his passion(s). A wise parent will encourage this pursuit of <br/>
passion, because it may be what the child decides to devote his life&#39;s work to. <br/>
Maybe *more* importantly, that wise parent will step aside when a passion <br/>
becomes &quot;old&quot; because the parent will know that *some* connection has been made with <br/>
this fleeting passion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
From 10-12 years old, Cameron was a magician. I actually thought that he <br/>
would become the next Lance Burton or Jeff McBride (who once referred to Cameron <br/>
as &quot;mini-me&quot;!). He was so passionate about magic, he would practice and perform <br/>
ALL day! Insert here: &quot;If I let him, Cameron would sit around and do magic <br/>
ALL DAY!&quot; Well, he DID! Until the day when he quit. I was stunned! He&#39;d lost all <br/>
interest. We&#39;d put thousands of dollars into costumes and tricks and gimmicks <br/>
and conventions and tapes and books and private sessions with famous <br/>
magicians---and he just up and quit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
At first I was incredulous. Then I realized it was just an intense, fleeting <br/>
passion. We still have a huge box of magic upstairs in the attic. He can come <br/>
back to it whenever----or not. What&#39;s important is that it inspired him and f<br/>
ed a passion and entertained him (and us and hundreds more). He met some truly <br/>
fascinating people and made connections that will last a lifetime---because he <br/>
had an interest, a passion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Stage one, deschooling, is a very uncomfortable time! It&#39;s a period of <br/>
intense questioning and of challenging yourself to think differently. This is <br/>
difficult, but it can be done---as with all learning: when you&#39;re ready to!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Stage two may be even more uncomfortable, because you&#39;re actually  putting <br/>
the ideas into action: you&#39;re allowing the passions to take over and you&#39;re not <br/>
pushing the three &quot;R&#39;s&quot;. You are beginning to trust that the child will learn <br/>
and you&#39;re respecting his choices. You&#39;re UNschooling! And the more you do it, <br/>
the easier it gets!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Stage three is freedom and joy and trust and respect and desire: Radical <br/>
Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Stage III<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
The third and final stage is when we can honestly and sincerely look at ALL <br/>
learning as equal and not hold one &quot;method&quot; or style or subject or means of <br/>
obtaining information above another. By stage three, we live and breathe <br/>
unschooling---it&#39;s such a part of our day-to-day living that we can&#39;t separate it from <br/>
our lives: it&#39;s not just the &quot;educational&quot; part because *everything* is <br/>
educational. We can apply unschooling principles to bedtimes and eating and video <br/>
gaming and TV and &quot;chores&quot;. We know that our children will learn because it&#39;s <br/>
what they were born to do; they&#39;re hard-wired to learn. Learning is how the <br/>
human species survives and progresses and succeeds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
This is the stage when we can effectively and confidently start giving out <br/>
unschooling information to the uninformed or misinformed because we &quot;get it.&quot; We <br/>
can live our lives joyfully because we&#39;re not worried whether Susie will pass <br/>
her algebra or whether Johnny will be able to get into a good college, <br/>
because they WILL if they want to. We know that they will pursue their <br/>
passions...well, passionately! And that each day will bring more connections and learning <br/>
opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
This is the stage when classes and instruction may eke back into our lives, <br/>
as it recently has in our family&#39;s. We don&#39;t give more weight to the learning <br/>
that is happening in Sociology-101 or karate or bee-keeping just because it&#39;s <br/>
happening in a classroom situation. A class is just another means of pursuing <br/>
our passions, making the connections, and receiving the information. Learning <br/>
happens all the time in all places---*even* in a classroom!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t want to give the impression that acceptance of class/book learning <br/>
automatically makes you a Radical Unschooler. Stage III cannot &quot;just happen&quot;: <br/>
you&#39;ll have to go through Stages I and II first. For those of us that attended <br/>
school, deschooling will always exist at a lower level throughout our lives. <br/>
The next generation (our unschooled children) will not have this stage to work <br/>
through: they&#39;ll be able to see all learning as equal and good from the get-go.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a process: getting rid of the school-think and structure, becoming <br/>
comfortable and implementing immersion learning, and *then* accepting ALL learning <br/>
as equally valuable.<br/>
<br/>

  -------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
When reading your stage III description, I found myself thinking that in some ways, classes happen because they&#39;re one of the more expedient ways to gain information in a school-driven culture. I think that many of us would be just as happy (maybe happier!) to learn bee-keeping from a neighbor who&#39;s been doing it for years. But we&#39;re not always lucky enough for a situation like this to present itself, so we seek out the next best solution--a class on bee-keeping. Mentoring relationships and informal groups, in my opinion, are far more valuable than classroom instruction. It&#39;s just that they aren&#39;t always options, whereas you can find a class on just about anything. Sometimes, a person can read as much about a subject as they can get their hands on--from books to the internet--but no amount of reading will provide the same insight as just talking to someone else with actual experience in the subject. I think that&#39;s why we seek out classes, not because there&#39;s value in taking and passing a class to achieve some kind of credential. Does that make sense? So it&#39;s a shift in purpose and perspective that unschoolers undergo before they return to &quot;class.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Going back to an earlier discussion on courses...<br/>
<br/>
I, too, enjoyed the intellectual exchange that happened in my grad classes. But I enjoyed it in much the same way as I enjoy this list: I liked debating and thinking with other people interested in the same issues. I didn&#39;t *like* the trappings of formal classes. Some of the best discussions and learning I had were the informal ones, after classes at a local bar or coffee shop, informal discussion circles where professors and grad students were on an equal playing field--just a group of people of various ages and backgrounds having an honest, intellectual exchange about a shared interest. These were the best times, in my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I&#39;m just pointing out that classes happen, but only because they&#39;re sometimes a necessary evil *g*. (Maybe one that it&#39;s worth thinking more about how to bypass?) Unschoolers would probably gain the same information, interaction and experience in a more unschooly way through mentoring and informal groups than they do from classes. It&#39;s just that sometimes the choice isn&#39;t there, you know?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       It&#39;s this way for me and for my family. Formal instruction of any kind <br/>
imitates life, rather than the other way around. <br/>
<br/>
       So the closer it can come to learning as we enjoy it in life, without <br/>
sacrificing the somewhat artificial convenience and coverage that are its only <br/>
excuse for existing in the first place, the better I like it. :)  JJ<br/>
