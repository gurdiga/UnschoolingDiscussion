<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771330152">My 7 month old has slept through the night since birth.  No kidding, at <br/>
*least* 6 hours at a time.  I always woke her up after 6 to nurse, but there <br/>
were times she would sleep 8-10 if I was past exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
My 22 month old wakes up 1-3 times most nights.  Sometimes he is hysterical, <br/>
others he just needs to be tucked in and loved on.<br/>
<br/>
My (almost) 3 year old occasionaly wakes up screaming and climbs into my bed <br/>
and falls fast asleep.<br/>
<br/>
My 4 yr old wakes up once EVERY night, usually softly crying and just needs <br/>
a hug then smiles and trots back off to bed.  If she needs extra comfort, <br/>
she climbs in my bed or brings all her bedding and sets up shop on the floor <br/>
next to me bed and goes back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
The others sleep all night, I assume because I don&#39;t see them unless I peek <br/>
in or run into them in the loo. :)<br/>
<br/>
I wake up about 90 times during the night.  My husband snoring, talking, the <br/>
kids climbing in bed or crying, having to pee, thirsty.<br/>
<br/>
All this jibberish is to say that sleeping through the night is rare, in my <br/>
opinion.  Almost everyone wakes at some point, most of us are just better <br/>
able to roll over and fall back asleep.  The little ones usually just need <br/>
some extra attention or a warm snuggle-buddy and tend to do just fine.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t met a child yet that won&#39;t fall asleep happily in an occupied <br/>
parental bed, save those with night terrors and that just takes patience and <br/>
understanding until that stage passes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392707709">Last night dh and I were up all night with two year old and new kitty (what was I thinking) the new kitty chased the old Cat around our bedroom all night. When little baby woke up, I remembered what Sandra said about a good warm body and took her in with me. She was fast asleep in 5 minutes, so was I. It was a nice night:) Kelli<br/>
