<div id="ygrps-yiv-982978967">Here&#39;s another positive article about how technology actually can <br/>
create learning rather than damage young brains, in new ways that old teachers are <br/>
deeply suspicious of and still resist. This one isn&#39;t linked anywhere that I <br/>
know of. I saved it just because we play tennis &lt;g&gt;. The original newspaper <br/>
link may still work, and if not, email me if you want a copy of the whole <br/>
article and I will forward.  JJ<br/>

A Coach&#39;s Digital Tools Take Center Court<br/>

THE serve explodes off Jeff Salzenstein&#39;s racket. It is a round yellow <br/>
missile, traveling 130 miles per hour and capable of freezing the world&#39;s top tennis <br/>
players in their Reeboks. But this rocket underscores its server&#39;s <br/>
consternation. If he can hit a ball like this, Salzenstein wonders until it hurts, why <br/>
must he toil only on the outskirts of greatness?<br/>
<br/>
Enter the nutritionist, spiritual adviser, stretching coach and yoga <br/>
instructor. Salzenstein consults each to help him to rise above his world tennis <br/>
ranking: No. 125, or relative obscurity. And he comes here, to the Peninsula Tennis <br/>
Club, to sit in front of John Yandell&#39;s &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=SNE&quot;">http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=SNE&quot;</a>&gt;Sony&lt;/A&gt; laptop computer and figure out <br/>
if ones and zeroes will at last unlock his full potential. . .<br/>
<br/>
The major sports increasingly employ technology not just to improve their <br/>
equipment and safety, but also to train, using computers to quantify performance <br/>
and help athletes push their potential. Tennis has not been in the forefront, <br/>
but Yandell believes the future of the sport&#39;s instruction will revolve around <br/>
digital imagery, and he is working with Salzenstein to prove his point.<br/>
<br/>
A coach with a Yale history degree who once tutored John McEnroe on his <br/>
serve, Yandell proposes a seemingly simple concept. He wants to use digital <br/>
photography to break down the serves, forehands and backhands of the greatest players <br/>
of all time, then let others modify their own swings to incorporate some of <br/>
the most successful techniques.<br/>
<br/>
He plans to videotape the world&#39;s best players in three dimensions using <br/>
super-high-speed digital cameras. Then he wants to reduce the tennis swing to a <br/>
science; he wants to measure the precise position of the arm at impact, the path <br/>
of the racket head over the full swing, and the speed and angles of body <br/>
rotation.<br/>
<br/>
He would like to change the way people teach tennis, which he said is &quot;an <br/>
invisible game&quot; because neither coaches nor fans really know what is happening. <br/>
The trouble, he said, is that the swing happens so quickly that the naked eye <br/>
cannot pick up what separates the swing mechanics of the greats from mere <br/>
mortals or near-greats like Jeff Salzenstein.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The basic issues of technique are in complete disarray, confusion and <br/>
dispute among the so-called experts and authorities,&quot; Yandell said. &quot;If you get the <br/>
best coaches after a couple of beers, they&#39;ll tell you, &#39;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s <br/>
really happening.&#39; &quot;<br/>
