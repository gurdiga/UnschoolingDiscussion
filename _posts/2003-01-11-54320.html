My older boys have all enjoyed having their own things to do outside the famly - and we have enouraged this. So, they have time to be themselves without family around always...Mostly, this has been volunteer work ( at a maritime museum, doing gardening) or part time paid work. They have also organised regular things with friends - a golfing afternoon each Wednesday with a couple of other friends, they play war games  on Saturday afternoons with friends at different houses, joined a youth version of a political party...They like to have to have their own interests, on their own time, in their own way...Might be what your son is looking for and maybe he could do these sort of things, without resorting to school and school restrictions on his time...Leonie W. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is easy......the older ones tend to watch the younger ones......The <br/>
youngers ones usually pick up on things that the older ones are doing.<br/>
My oldest daughter will often print up things from the free worksheets or <br/>
coloring pages.<br/>
They 6 yr old has pretty much learn by watching. She is writing on her own. <br/>
She sees her older sisters writing letters to friends and traces really well.<br/>
Our 18 month old often steals the 3 & 6 yr old&#39;s pencils and gets paper and <br/>
scribbles already.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have always asked them if they wanted to go and all of them have said no. <br/>
They enjoy being with each other and if someone is sick or has a hospital <br/>
emergency, they will not function well until everything is back in it&#39;s place <br/>
or they get a call telling them that everything is ok . They have that <br/>
closeness even though they will fight.......<br/>

Well I don&#39;t have a large family but with my 3 youngest, I find it actually <br/>
easier than when there is just one. They all keep each other occupied and <br/>
each one has interests that the others pick up on also. The two middle ones <br/>
are almost 7 and just 8 and the baby is 2. The two older ones are great with <br/>
their little sister and she adores them. I find her so much different at <br/>
this age then all of my other three were. I know it&#39;s because of the <br/>
interaction she has with them and her trying to kep up and do what they do. <br/>
I&#39;ve been around families with only one or two children and see a definite <br/>
difference in how they need to homeschool or unschool. Not a bad thing, just <br/>
different.<br/>
