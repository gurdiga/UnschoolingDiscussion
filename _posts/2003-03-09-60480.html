<div id="ygrps-yiv-371946255">I know this issue as been discussed many times before but will you please bear with me.  I have been reading Kids, Parents and Power Struggles by Mary Kurcinka and she says that consequences are important.  That they should be stated beforehand so that the child knows he is making a choice.  Example:  if you hit a friend no more inviting friends for two days.<br/>
<br/>
I know many of you feel that the natural consequences are more than enough for example, child feeling bad for hitting friend, friend being angry...  Are there any situations were you do have imposed consequences?  If so, do you decide with your child?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,  <br/>

Well, you chose to read that book.  Is it because you have power struggles?<br/>
<br/>
We decided a long long time ago to have discussions instead of power <br/>
struggles, and to base what we would &quot;let&quot; our kids do on what was good for <br/>
them and what wouldn&#39;t hurt them, rather than on arbitrary made-up (or <br/>
traditional) rules and times and such.   <br/>
<br/>
We made the decision based in large part on watching the kids and families <br/>
around us, and seeing that the more rules there were the more struggle there <br/>
was, and the more rules there were the less the child and parent felt they <br/>
were living together as partners.  They were adversaries.  We didn&#39;t want to <br/>
be adversarial.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know many of you feel that the natural consequences are more than enough <br/>

<br/>
Throw in &quot;mom reminds child that hitting isn&#39;t good; child thinks about what <br/>
mom says.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere between imposing consequences from a list (however many swats or <br/>
hours or minutes of groundedness or time-out or whatever) and pure reliance <br/>
on natural consequences (you&#39;ll just lose all your friends, that&#39;s all; then <br/>
you&#39;ll learn)  there is a vast area of reason, discussion, example, <br/>
compassion, speculation, explanation, planning how to avoid similar <br/>
situations in the future, of reminding the child that what he does affect HIM <br/>
too, affects the good person he wants to be.<br/>
<br/>

Sometimes if Marty can&#39;t get quiet late at night I ask him to just go to bed. <br/>
 But it&#39;s not a consequence for a transgression as much as it is a reminder <br/>
that staying up needs to involve letting other people sleep. It&#39;s the <br/>
principle, not the rule.  If I&#39;m awake enough to discuss it with him, he must <br/>
have woken ME up, at least, and shouldn&#39;t have.  That&#39;s a natural <br/>
consequence, when he wakes someone up and they come and tell him about it.<br/>
<br/>
The other night Kirby, Marty and Joey (our squatter-kid who legally lives <br/>
about eight blocks away but who is here more than half the time) were <br/>
watching a Back to the Future marathon (because Joyce gave us her video set <br/>
when she upgraded to DVD--THANKS!) and sometimes those movies get loud.  And <br/>
Marty got loud too.  I was still awake, and sometimes went in to see certain <br/>
scenes, and then would go about my other stuff.  But at one point Holly <br/>
stomped downstairs and told them all to BE QUIET OR GO TO SLEEP.  She didn&#39;t <br/>
see me in here on the computer, so I didn&#39;t say anything.  I was really <br/>
amused, though.  And that was some natural consequence.  They got quieter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092095536">I am reading the book because I really like the author and she has lots of good ideas on how to monitor your emotions and your kids emotions.  Like every book, I am taking what I like and discarding the rest.  The only time we have power struggles is when we have to go somewhere at a specific time.  Sometimes warning him before and letting him choose something to bring and choose what he wears... works but other times nothing does.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I agree with that and I do that too.  We have a great relationship and I discuss things with him all the time and at 2 1/2 he understands a lot of things.  Some things are hard to explain though.  Like when we have to go for supper at my parents and he wants to stay home.  I explain to him that grandma prepared a nice supper for us and she will be upset if we don&#39;t go but he is upset if we go so it&#39;s like telling him her feelings are more important than is.  Anyways, I am reading the  book for new ideas on how to make transitions easier for him I guess.  I don&#39;t believe in time-outs either or spanking.  I also never threaten or impose consequences, but I just wanted your take on this because it&#39;s hard not to question myself sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
