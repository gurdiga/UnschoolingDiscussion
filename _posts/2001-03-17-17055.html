Turn Beauty Inside Out is our ongoing public awareness and action <br/>
campaign<br/>
to change the unhealthy messages about beauty that harm kids and <br/>
adults.<br/>
The campaign celebrates Inner Beauty-the beauty of action, caring and <br/>
making<br/>
the world a better place in ways both large and small.<br/>
<br/>
The special (full-color!) May/June 2001 issue of New Moon with the <br/>
theme of<br/>
&quot;25 Beautiful Girls&quot; spreads our message and involves all our readers <br/>
in the<br/>
campaign.<br/>

year).<br/>

Girls Inc. in Sioux City, IA. Are holding classes during the month of <br/>
May.<br/>
The 8 week session of classes for 10-11 year old is focusing on Inner <br/>
vs.<br/>
Outer beauty. They will be taking a values survey and completing a <br/>
body<br/>
image checklist. Then the girls will examine advertisements from <br/>
magazines<br/>
and analyze the magazine&#39;s message about body image. The girls will <br/>
write<br/>
some letters to the editors, etc. They will use the Internet, several<br/>
websites have projects where they put ads online to analyze regarding <br/>
body<br/>
image and society&#39;s portrayal of beauty. The girls will also examine <br/>
their<br/>
own personal inner beauty and will be involved in several related<br/>
activities. They will talk about eating disorders and other ways women <br/>
hurt<br/>
themselves trying to achieve what they believe is the &quot;perfect body.&quot;<br/>
