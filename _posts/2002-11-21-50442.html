<div id="ygrps-yiv-764663868">ALAN RICKMAN SUCKS! <br/>
<br/>
Now that I have your attention!&lt;GGG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;all, I&#39;ve had about all of this as I can handle. I figured I&#39;d bring it <br/>
here to show you guys what I&#39;m up against in SC. It&#39;s absolutely <br/>
unbelievable! This has been going on for two-three days. Sandra&#39;s seen a few, <br/>
but nothing like this! I have absolutely NO DOUBTS that this woman will EVER <br/>
read here, so I have no qualms about publicly posting. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I said I wouldn&#39;t reply, but I will one last time.  If<br/>
a child likes to paint, a prent can incorp. history,<br/>
science and math into it.  A child likes to cook,<br/>
measuring cup is math, evolution from cake batter to<br/>
cake bread is science and so on.  If a parent teaches<br/>
math one week, science the next, that is learning.  If<br/>
you take a drive and the sign says ten miles to go and<br/>
then 8 miles to go then you can incorp. that as<br/>
educational teaching of math.  One last time, how you<br/>
teach your child is your choice,  to out right refuse<br/>
to teach your child is another!  Child led learning<br/>
allows the child to learn in the manner the parent<br/>
decides is suited to that child.  Child led learning<br/>
is still guided with the parents help and the parent<br/>
keeping a record of that childs progress with or<br/>
without an actual grading system of points.  I am only<br/>
saying a parent who thinks unschooling means your<br/>
child does not have to leearn to read and write, add<br/>
and subtract just because the world  requires this or<br/>
the child feels they don&#39;t want to is taking the term<br/>
unschooling out of context.  Your can teach your child<br/>
using unconvetional methods, you have to keep a<br/>
portfolio of your childs learning progress, and the<br/>
law does mandate required subjects and it mandates 180<br/>
days of such learning.  If you are teaching or<br/>
allowing your child to learn in a manner that is<br/>
learning, your teaching!  If your child plays all day,<br/>
has no clue at age 9 how to read see spot run, you are<br/>
not unschooling, you are just not schooling period! <br/>
That is the point I am trying to get across.  There is<br/>
a major dif. in unschooling and not schooling. <br/>
Unschooling still teaches in one manner or another. <br/>
Not Schooling means your child is not learning<br/>
anything he/she will need to know to make it in this<br/>
life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you guys BELIEVE this? I&#39;m having a hard time even forming a response <br/>
because I get too angry. I may need to unsub---but I hate to leave it like <br/>
this. BTW, Myranda has responded very well several times! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

It&#39;s the difference between teaching and learning. I do hope Sandra will <br/>
chime in with her wonderful description of learning VS teaching---about the <br/>
song and dance. I have it here in my &quot;Book of Sandra&quot;  (right next to my <br/>
&quot;Book of Joyce&quot;, my &quot;Book of Anne&quot;, my Book of Deb&quot; ---which I just added <br/>
too! Thank you! &lt;G&gt;, and others). I&#39;ll just have to sift through it if she <br/>
doesn&#39;t come through for me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m publishing after the next conference. I am. Really. We all need to talk! &lt;<br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Actually, facilitating is probably a<br/>
better word. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just a better word, it&#39;s an entire 180-degree turn and a whole <br/>
different concept of life.<br/>
<br/>
If children can&#39;t learn without being taught, then there is no unschooling.  <br/>
There is no natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent thinks she has to teach, or thinks the child learned to walk and <br/>
talk because she taught him to, that parent will be sure that reading and <br/>
writing must be taught.  But if a parent sees that all a child needs to learn <br/>
to walk is some safe stuff to pull up on, and that kids will learn to talk <br/>
from just playing with talking, being talked to, getting feedback on what he <br/>
tries to say... then that parent will be more ready to understand how a child <br/>
can learn to read the same way.<br/>
<br/>
So &quot;teaching&quot; as a favored idea or point of pride can be a block to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean (as so many seem to think) that not teaching inhibits <br/>
learning, in a busy unschooling family.  Learning WITH children is BIG <br/>
learning. <br/>
<br/>
School did a job on most of its attendees, one way or another.  Some will go <br/>
to the grave thinking math HAS to look like thirty exercises at the end of a <br/>
vague math lesson in a government book.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s this debate about? Why does she feel it&#39;s necessary to draw this line<br/>
between kids who are learning and kids who aren&#39;t? Why do the supposed<br/>
nonlearning kids concern her? Has HSLDA convinced her that there are radical<br/>
homeschoolers who deliberately keep their children ignorant as a way of<br/>
thumbing their noses at the government, and are therefore a threat to all<br/>
homeschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like she&#39;s saying &quot;I&#39;m not talking about real homeschoolers who<br/>
might even call themselves unschoolers. I&#39;m talking about *them.* You know.<br/>
THEM. The ones whose kids aren&#39;t learning anything. The ones who say they&#39;re<br/>
homeschooling but really aren&#39;t. So it sounds like she&#39;s trying to distance<br/>
herself from being lumped with people who will cause homeschoolers to come<br/>
under more scrutiny.<br/>
<br/>
But how did the subject of &quot;those kids&quot; come up? Did it come up just from a<br/>
discussion of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One last time, how you<br/>
&gt; teach your child is your choice,  to out right refuse<br/>
&gt; to teach your child is another!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like a word use barrier or being trapped in a paradigm. When she<br/>
sees &quot;no teaching&quot; she reads &quot;no learning.&quot; Regardless of how you explain<br/>
that no teaching doesn&#39;t mean no learning, she&#39;s not going to get it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you are teaching or<br/>
&gt; allowing your child to learn in a manner that is<br/>
&gt; learning, your teaching!  If your child plays all day,<br/>
&gt; has no clue at age 9 how to read see spot run, you are<br/>
&gt; not unschooling, you are just not schooling period!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to explain to someone who has no concept of food<br/>
being grown, only bought at a grocery store. You&#39;re saying you don&#39;t buy<br/>
food from the grocery store and she&#39;s reading you don&#39;t have food in the<br/>
house. The concept of farming is lost on her because you aren&#39;t getting<br/>
*her* point that if you don&#39;t buy food at the grocery you can&#39;t have food in<br/>
the house so therefore you&#39;re starving your family.<br/>
<br/>
And her food choices are limited to what&#39;s in the grocery store (clearly<br/>
educational stuff and activities) so the idea of eating anything else<br/>
(playing) is like saying you eat cardboard and sand.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Child led learning<br/>
&gt; allows the child to learn in the manner the parent<br/>
&gt; decides is suited to that child.  Child led learning<br/>
&gt; is still guided with the parents help and the parent<br/>
&gt; keeping a record of that childs progress with or<br/>
&gt; without an actual grading system of points.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Though the first sentence is nonsense, the second makes it sound like she&#39;s<br/>
trying to say something about if you can do the stuff the state requires to<br/>
the state&#39;s satisfaction then obviously you&#39;ve taught them, how else would<br/>
someone be able to fill out the paperwork.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645027807">I didn&#39;t re-read the whole post Kelly sent you guys... but I think it was an earlier one that this woman clearly stated that if you&#39;re not teaching your children (read: they&#39;re not learning) then you are sickening, neglectful, are not following state law, and may/will have your kids taken away from you. :::sigh::: And to think I just finally remembered to &quot;get legal&quot; and join her sister&#39;s association this last month. I swear, I&#39;m gonna start my own as soon as I have a little bit of time! <br/>

  &gt; the child feels they don&#39;t want to is taking the term<br/>
  &gt; unschooling out of context.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  What&#39;s this debate about? Why does she feel it&#39;s necessary to draw this line<br/>
  between kids who are learning and kids who aren&#39;t? Why do the supposed<br/>
  nonlearning kids concern her? Has HSLDA convinced her that there are radical<br/>
  homeschoolers who deliberately keep their children ignorant as a way of<br/>
  thumbing their noses at the government, and are therefore a threat to all<br/>
  homeschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
  It sounds like she&#39;s saying &quot;I&#39;m not talking about real homeschoolers who<br/>
  might even call themselves unschoolers. I&#39;m talking about *them.* You know.<br/>
  THEM. The ones whose kids aren&#39;t learning anything. The ones who say they&#39;re<br/>
  homeschooling but really aren&#39;t. So it sounds like she&#39;s trying to distance<br/>
  herself from being lumped with people who will cause homeschoolers to come<br/>
  under more scrutiny.<br/>
<br/>
  But how did the subject of &quot;those kids&quot; come up? Did it come up just from a<br/>
  discussion of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; One last time, how you<br/>
  &gt; teach your child is your choice,  to out right refuse<br/>
  &gt; to teach your child is another!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This sounds like a word use barrier or being trapped in a paradigm. When she<br/>
  sees &quot;no teaching&quot; she reads &quot;no learning.&quot; Regardless of how you explain<br/>
  that no teaching doesn&#39;t mean no learning, she&#39;s not going to get it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; If you are teaching or<br/>
  &gt; allowing your child to learn in a manner that is<br/>
  &gt; learning, your teaching!  If your child plays all day,<br/>
  &gt; has no clue at age 9 how to read see spot run, you are<br/>
  &gt; not unschooling, you are just not schooling period!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to explain to someone who has no concept of food<br/>
  being grown, only bought at a grocery store. You&#39;re saying you don&#39;t buy<br/>
  food from the grocery store and she&#39;s reading you don&#39;t have food in the<br/>
  house. The concept of farming is lost on her because you aren&#39;t getting<br/>
  *her* point that if you don&#39;t buy food at the grocery you can&#39;t have food in<br/>
  the house so therefore you&#39;re starving your family.<br/>
<br/>
  And her food choices are limited to what&#39;s in the grocery store (clearly<br/>
  educational stuff and activities) so the idea of eating anything else<br/>
  (playing) is like saying you eat cardboard and sand.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; Child led learning<br/>
  &gt; allows the child to learn in the manner the parent<br/>
  &gt; decides is suited to that child.  Child led learning<br/>
  &gt; is still guided with the parents help and the parent<br/>
  &gt; keeping a record of that childs progress with or<br/>
  &gt; without an actual grading system of points.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Though the first sentence is nonsense, the second makes it sound like she&#39;s<br/>
  trying to say something about if you can do the stuff the state requires to<br/>
  the state&#39;s satisfaction then obviously you&#39;ve taught them, how else would<br/>
  someone be able to fill out the paperwork.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2246297">I doubt very seriously she knows..... if she did, it would be a serious breach of confidentiality. For all her sister knows, I was registered with the school board before transferring to her association, anyway. They both just don&#39;t understand unschooling and have already made up their minds as to what they think it is. <br/>

<br/>
And I think that WAS the sister. Her writing was too----well, that&#39;s been <br/>
discussed on this list ad nauseum. I didn&#39;t want to be associated with an <br/>
organization whose head doesn&#39;t have a grasp on the written word (spelling, <br/>
punctuation, grammar, etc). Sorry. I am prejudiced that way. Her <br/>
ignorance/lack of &quot;education&quot; would surely reflect on a state accountability <br/>
association---and maybe me by association. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I was right.<br/>
