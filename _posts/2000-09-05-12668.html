<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990826765">A couple thoughts have come to me as I&#39;m reading these posts.  Things I may <br/>
try in the future, should I have such a need:  Clapping my hands together, <br/>
once, and loudly; whispering to the child.<br/>
<br/>
I think the first might be most appropriate in an emergency situation whereas <br/>
the second might work in a &#39;melt down&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Whispering to a group of children is a technique I have used many times when <br/>
trying to get their attention for group activities.  It works wonders.  There <br/>
is something about using that calm, quiet tone that gets their attention and <br/>
can work wonders.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW,<br/>
