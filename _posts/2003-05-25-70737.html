<div id="ygrps-yiv-520818867">As I was leaving the park one day (leaving because Jonathan had kicked<br/>
another child) I stopped to talk with another parent (to apologize) I said,<br/>
&quot;If I had stopped raising kids after my daughter I could have boasted being<br/>
a perfect parent.&quot;<br/>

He got a good laugh out of that one.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Cameron was *such* an easy child. I, too, thought that *I* was the<br/>
&gt; &gt; perfect<br/>
&gt; &gt; parent. Everyone else was just doing it WRONG!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then I had Duncan. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh, you were the victim of the Creators&#39; master plan to birth as many<br/>
&gt; &gt; children as possible to unschooling parents!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I always joke around that the birthing Goddess gave me Alex *first*, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; happy,<br/>
&gt; &gt; content, gorgeous child, to &quot;trick&quot; me into having more children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; well, actually...no.  There are eight years between my boys. Duncan is our<br/>
&gt; surprise! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
