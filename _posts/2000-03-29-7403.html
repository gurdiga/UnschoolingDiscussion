I can relate to the coughing at bedtime thing! We are just coming off <br/>
whooping cough around here and when one of my 3 ds&#39;s comes near me while i&#39;m <br/>
nursing baby emma to sleep, i lose it!LOL! and run from the scene with the <br/>
baby hanging on the breast to find a non-coughing room!LOL!<br/>

Oh, how scary!  Did you all have it?  I&#39;m afraid I would come unglued if I <br/>
heard one of my little ones making that awful cough!  Best wishes for a <br/>
speedy recovery to everyone at your house!<br/>

<div><font size="2">lol!&nbsp; tonight, after getting home from the pictures, 
(Lake Placid, fun :-) ) to find my mum taking the girls upstairs, I end up going 
upto get them to sleep.&nbsp; BUT!!!&nbsp; I lie down with them, telling them 
I&#39;m not going to sleep, just lying down while they go because I have to drive 
Granny Ruby home.&nbsp; After nursing on each side, dd2 starts shuffling around, 
and I can hear mum gabbing on to dh downstairs, so they can too, so I ask dh to 
close the door.&nbsp; I go back to bed and get grizzled at for hogging the 
duvet, HA!&nbsp; It&#39;s a single duvet and I&#39;m just covering myself, so I grizzle 
back, and I get told to go and take GR home!&nbsp; So, after getting assurances 
that they would close their eyes and go to sleep, I did, and they did, and I&#39;m 
stunned!!!!!</font></div>
