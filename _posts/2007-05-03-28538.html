Actually, he&#39;s at  Bennigan&#39;s, at Josh & Drew&#39;s birthday party, where  <br/>
Sadie and Brett and a few others are singing karaoke.  Holly and I  <br/>
took him by there after we picked him up at the airport.  We have  <br/>
airport photos, but no restaurant photos.  Holly needs to go to work  <br/>
early or we might&#39;ve stayed there.<br/>
