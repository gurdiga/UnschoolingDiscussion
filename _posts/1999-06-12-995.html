kids are always correcting me). He wanted to learn to play the violin sohe <br/>
called the Institute of Music.They told him he was too old. I got him _Never <br/>
Too Late_(John Holt) for his birthday. He decided to learn the recorder and <br/>
piano(he bought himself a keyboard).<br/>
He now takes classes at the local community college, volunteers at about 4 or <br/>
5 different places, goes to the gym 4 times a week,  and walks daily.<br/>
