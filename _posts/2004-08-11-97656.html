 </span></blockquote>I forwarded Kathryn&#39;s &quot;11 really cool things about the L&L conference&quot; to <br/>
my wee little local group of unschoolers, but I added a paragraph or two, <br/>
and I wanted to share those words here, just in case there&#39;s someone who&#39;s <br/>
sitting on the fence about going.  Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(Having attended the last two unschooling conferences in Columbia, SC), <br/>
&gt;probably the best reason for attending is not on the list of 11 really <br/>
&gt;cool things:  That is the sense of being part of and connecting with a <br/>
&gt;community of folks who are doing the very same thing you&#39;re doing or are <br/>
&gt;trying to do, a community of folks who understand and encourage you and <br/>
&gt;your kids to be who you are.  It was a great experience for Liam and me to <br/>
&gt;see so many other families being respectful towards and joyful with their <br/>
&gt;children and it was great to feel &quot;normal&quot; instead of &quot;out there&quot; with <br/>
&gt;300-plus other families.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Money and scheduling are going to prevent us from being able to go this <br/>
&gt;year, but if there&#39;s any chance you can possibly go, I strongly and <br/>
&gt;emphatically endorse this conference, **especially** if you have a spouse <br/>
&gt;who needs a fuller understanding of what you&#39;re doing and why!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s all I know.<br/>
