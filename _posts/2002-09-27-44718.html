  I know what you mean about &quot;pressed to use her skills&quot;.  For a long time<br/>
my high school art teacher would stop me on the street to express her digust<br/>
with me that I hadn&#39;t gone on to college.  Imagine if I had gone to college<br/>
and then had stayed home with my children anyway.  The poor woman would<br/>
probably have had a coronary at the sight of me~<br/>

...Our 15yod has thought for a long time it was a waste to go to college and<br/>
spend<br/>
tons of money...most likely come out with debt and end up doing what she<br/>
wants in the first place ~ be a mom!<br/>
  She would be pressed to use her &quot;skills&quot; later on when she would rather<br/>
be at home with her children anyway...<br/>
