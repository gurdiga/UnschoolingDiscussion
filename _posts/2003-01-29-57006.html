<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s been great asking questions and learning about unschooling.  I have a <br/>
&gt; few questions I&#39;d like some of the experienced and new unschoolers to <br/>
&gt; answer if they would like to do that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. Do most unschoolers feel that their lifestyle has come about as a <br/>
&gt; process, or working transformation, or have many unschoolers been <br/>
&gt; unschoolers since their children were babies? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. Are there certain situations, where unschooling just doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
&gt; work, or do most unschoolers unschool 100% of the time? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have met only a few unschoolers and watched and talked to them about how <br/>
&gt; they unschool.  They all in conversations seem to be saying what most of <br/>
&gt; the posters on this board say, but when I watch them interact with their <br/>
&gt; children, I can see where they make decisions for their children, and <br/>
&gt; coerce them into doing something they want.  An example of this is at a <br/>
&gt; potluck one of the children wanted to eat something he&#39;s allergic to, but <br/>
&gt; his mom wouldn&#39;t let him do that.  Another situation is when it was time to <br/>
&gt; leave, we had to be out of the rented space at 2:30pm, the child wanted to <br/>
&gt; stay longer.  The mother ended up having to pick him up and take him out <br/>
&gt; because reasoning with him wasn&#39;t working.  Would most of you do things <br/>
&gt; differently in situations similar to this? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried to figure out how to do things so my children get to make <br/>
&gt; decisions on their own, but often times their decision doesn&#39;t just affect <br/>
&gt; me and my family, but it affects others.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. How do you handle situations where a small child wants to do something, <br/>
&gt; but what he wants to do affects everyone, not just the child and the <br/>
&gt; family?   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; An example of this is when my son was playing around and wouldn&#39;t get ready <br/>
&gt; to go out to dinner.  Everyone was patiently waiting and encouraging him to <br/>
&gt; get ready.  It isn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t want to go, but because of his age, he <br/>
&gt; has no sense of time, or no concern for others feelings.  My father-in-law <br/>
&gt; needed to eat soon because he&#39;s on a schedule like I am when it comes to <br/>
&gt; eating. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cameron was in sixth grade at a progressive private school when we decided to <br/>
make a change. I say we took a sharp LEFT turn when we found unschooling. <br/>
It&#39;s a process. We feel that we&#39;ve &quot;arrived&quot; though! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been said here several times, but there IS a paradigm shift. Almost <br/>
everything has to change to &quot;get it&quot;. We&#39;ve all been brainwashed for YEARS. <br/>
That&#39;s a lot of &quot;dirt&quot; to get back into our heads!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s 99.7 %. With real unschoolers. We may have lapses. We&#39;re not <br/>
quite perfect! &lt;G&gt; I&#39;m not pleasant when I&#39;m over-hungry, but my sweet boys <br/>
will remind me to eat if I get crabby. Or bring me food. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, thank you for specifics. <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a true allergy, she was possibly saving his life! <br/>
This ISN&#39;T NCP/TCS where you let the child do &quot;whatever&quot; to his obvious <br/>
detriment or that of another. It would matter more WHY and HOW she <br/>
acted/reacted. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You have to realize: we hear people come here every week who say that they <br/>
unschool except for math. They unschool with educational things. But they <br/>
require chores and they ground for such-and-such offense and they don&#39;t allow <br/>
certain language in the houses.<br/>
<br/>
MANY who profess to be unschoolers....AREN&#39;T. Or maybe they&#39;re wannabees who <br/>
haven&#39;t yet &quot;arrived&quot;. Or maybe they&#39;re hungry! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

WANT to please. They don&#39;t always know HOW. It&#39;s our job to help them gently.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you were to speak with him as you would with ANY other person: &quot;We REALLY <br/>
need to go now. Opa MUST have some food---you know, or he&#39;ll get sick and <br/>
crabby like ME! Let&#39;s get a move on! Here, I have your shoes.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your whole post was helpful to me, Kelly.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I&#39;ve taken away from this list is a shift in how <br/>
we see our role in the home. Until now, even though I consider <br/>
us to be nurturing and attentive to our kids feelings, I&#39;ve still felt <br/>
that we were the authorities and that we were enforcing <br/>
household rules. (I probably wouldn&#39;t ahve put it in that crass <br/>
language, but after being here for over a month, I see now that <br/>
that is in practice how we lived.)<br/>
<br/>
Now we have made (are making) a shift to having principles and <br/>
offering support. I see us as facilitators and resources rather <br/>
than leaders. And I see our home being run by principles rather <br/>
than requirments.<br/>
<br/>
This was a big mind shift. And as you said, I was much further <br/>
along that continuum with my attitude toward &quot;school&quot; courses <br/>
and education than I was with our home life.<br/>
<br/>
The other night I was sharing a lot of this with my husband. He <br/>
was frustrated that our 15 yr old hasn&#39;t had the gumption to get a <br/>
job. The 15 yr old says he wants one, but he forgets to follow <br/>
through or he fills out the app and never turns it in.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, we would have just said, &quot;Well he&#39;s not working <br/>
then.&quot; Sort of a holding him accountable thing.<br/>
<br/>
But last night we realized that we could simply support him and <br/>
help him. We could drive him around, help him figure out what <br/>
he wants to do and then make sure he knows how to present <br/>
himself, etc. it was weird. It seemed so obvious once we talked <br/>
about it, but I believe we wouldn&#39;t have seen it until we thought <br/>
about offering help instead of feeling we were capitulating to his <br/>
weakness.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just thought I&#39;d add that story to the pot.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Probably. I would have made somewhere else seem like a MUCH better place. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve carried kids out, but we&#39;ve all been happier when I could persuade them <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
Way before I had children, I took education classes taught by school reform <br/>
advocates who had me read about Summerhill and John Holt and read the <br/>
inner-city-teaching books that were coming out then, late 1960&#39;s, early <br/>
1970&#39;s.  Jonathan Kozol.  I forget who all.<br/>
<br/>
When the liberal modern methods didn&#39;t work so well because kids were forced <br/>
to be there and I was forced to give grades, and rank kids, and keep kids <br/>
&quot;showing progress&quot; and all that, it was discouraging.<br/>
<br/>
Years passed.  I spent most of those ensuing years heavily involved in the <br/>
Society for Creative Anachronism, where people learn some pretty far-ranging <br/>
things for free, for fun, just because they need to know or want to know.  <br/>
And I saw many of them get to the point that they had jobs doing costumes for <br/>
operas, or armor for museums, or calligraphy for government projects and <br/>
movies.  And lots more did it just for the joy of it.<br/>
<br/>
When I had Kirby I joined La Leche League, and through that a babysitting <br/>
co-op that devolved into just a playgroup after a few years.   There were <br/>
four homeschooling families in that co-op.  I didn&#39;t intend to homeschool, <br/>
but I and my kids knew these families in their homes, and knew their kids in <br/>
our homes.  <br/>
<br/>
What a lucky lab situation for me!!  Two families were structured and two <br/>
were unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The main differences were the unschooled kids were nicer and more honest.  <br/>
The unschooling families had warmer relationships with their kids.  Kids <br/>
would come up and sit with their moms and dads instead of avoiding them in <br/>
situations like barbecues or parties.  Those kids would have conversations <br/>
with me like I was just another kid, just another person.  The <br/>
structured-family kids were like kids who went to school.  I saw no <br/>
differences in the patterns or the relationships between the parents and <br/>
kids, even though these moms were as involved in La Leche League as others in <br/>
the group.<br/>
<br/>
Then Kirby came to seem like a kid who should stay home.  I didn&#39;t consider <br/>
buying a curriculum.  I re-read all applicable books then in my possession <br/>
(Whole Child, Whole Parent; some Holt; Chop Wood, Carry Water), I subscribed <br/>
to Growing Without Schooling, and read each issue cover to cover, publication <br/>
declarations, ads and personals and all.<br/>
<br/>
I figured if it wasn&#39;t working I could switch to something else, but of <br/>
course it did work.<br/>
<br/>
So my transformation happened gradually and in the absence of kids.<br/>
<br/>
There were three kids in there years before Kirby, who were 3, 10 and 12 <br/>
(plus three years for each) who were in the custody of my first husband and <br/>
me.  His youngest sister and brother, and my half brother.  I learned a lot <br/>
of what didn&#39;t work, what might work, and what I could do better in the <br/>
future.  I was 21 to 24 during those years.<br/>

<br/>
I probably should have mentioned in my summary a minute ago that we had the <br/>
home life stuff fairly well down (except we still attempted regular jobs <br/>
sometimes, sporadically) before Kirby was school age.  We didn&#39;t make him <br/>
eat, we let him eat dessert first at restaurants if it seemed they could get <br/>
pie there quicker than they could chicken strips, or potatoes, or whatever.  <br/>
He would still eat the other foods.  And we were good with letting them have <br/>
power of choice and range of movement (choosing where to be at parks or malls <br/>
or whatever instead of dragging them along where we wanted to be).<br/>
<br/>
So we were convinced in advance that they had the full power to make good <br/>
decisions and we didn&#39;t have any superstitions about what would happen if you <br/>
&quot;let kids have their way.&quot;<br/>

oldest was about 2 1/2 and my youngest was about 2 months old.  It had <br/>
nothing to do with &quot;school&quot; or &quot;curriculum&quot; choices and I didn&#39;t even know at <br/>
the time that such a thing as unschooling existed but my thinking back then <br/>
was so much the same.  It talked about how we (dh and I) had talked about <br/>
spanking and discipline before the boys were born and had decided to not use <br/>
punishment.  And it talked about how when my first son was a baby he demanded <br/>
a lot of closeness with us.  How we had abandoned our thinking about children <br/>
and went with our gut instincts and held him and created a family bed etc.  <br/>
The letter talked about how we came to the conclusion to never make decisions <br/>
for our children about food.  They would decide when, where, what and how <br/>
much to eat.  etc. <br/>
<br/>
 My dh didn&#39;t know about the letter and when I showed him he assumed I had <br/>
just written it.  When I told him I had written it years ago he was so <br/>
pleased with how everything had gone and is going now.  How our thinking <br/>
then, even though we were nervous about our decisions, had been so right.  At <br/>
that time we didn&#39;t have the Internet and were in the military and had no <br/>
support system but each other.<br/>
<br/>
All these gut instincts totally went against everything we were taught were <br/>
proper parenting techniques.  But everything we did then put us in a place to <br/>
be so receptive to the unschooling concept when we discovered it.  So our <br/>
boys have never been made to do anything they didn&#39;t want to and when my <br/>
oldest became old enough and everyone was asking us about preschool we <br/>
gravitated toward letting him make the decisions then as well.  It all seemed <br/>
to flow so nicely for us.  No major revelations, no deschooling, no belief <br/>
changes etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I&#39;ve always been one, having &quot;risen out of&quot; school myself. <br/>
Neither my husband or I finished high school in a traditional way. I <br/>
think we both realized the futility and uselessness of the system, <br/>
and neither wanted to apply it to our kids. We never once thought <br/>
about sending the kids to school.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; work, or do most unschoolers unschool 100% of the time? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it works for anything you&#39;re willing or able to have patience <br/>
for, and you have to have enough self-knowledge not to have a hidden <br/>
agenda that they learn subject X by age Y. <br/>
<br/>
The only thing we haven&#39;t unschooled is swimming. I&#39;m pretty adamant <br/>
that my kids know how to swim. We&#39;re around water all the time, and I <br/>
think it&#39;s an important thing to know. I&#39;ve told them that either I <br/>
will teach them or they can take lessons. My son just opted to drop <br/>
lessons and have me continue teaching him. As soon as they&#39;re <br/>
proficient swimmers, we&#39;ll stop. But I wasn&#39;t willing to wait until <br/>
whatever age they thought it would be good to learn to swim. I guess <br/>
because I&#39;ve pulled a 7 year old boy from a river where he would&#39;ve <br/>
drowned, I&#39;ve got strong feelings on this one. Everything else I&#39;m <br/>
willing to be patient with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have met only a few unschoolers and watched and talked to them <br/>
 </span></blockquote>about how <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they unschool.  They all in conversations seem to be saying what <br/>
 </span></blockquote>most of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the posters on this board say, but when I watch them interact with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>their <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children, I can see where they make decisions for their children, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; coerce them into doing something they want.  An example of this is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>at a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; potluck one of the children wanted to eat something he&#39;s allergic <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to, but <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; his mom wouldn&#39;t let him do that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two comments on this one. Number one is that I don&#39;t think <br/>
unschooling and non-coercive parenting  (NCP) are the same thing. As <br/>
the mom of a food-allergic kid, I have no problem &quot;coercing&quot; my child <br/>
and not allowing him to eat something he&#39;s allergic to. Especially <br/>
before we had him treated and his allergies were of the life-<br/>
threatening variety. I also wouldn&#39;t allow him to step out in front <br/>
of a speeding truck, which is more or less the equivalent for an <br/>
allergic kid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Another situation is when it was time to <br/>
&gt; leave, we had to be out of the rented space at 2:30pm, the child <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wanted to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stay longer.  The mother ended up having to pick him up and take <br/>
 </span></blockquote>him out <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because reasoning with him wasn&#39;t working.  Would most of you do <br/>
 </span></blockquote>things <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; differently in situations similar to this? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, with the allergy thing, we&#39;ve done a lot of discussions to help <br/>
the kids understand what living with a food allergy means so that <br/>
they can take control of it themselves, but when they were younger we <br/>
did a lot of &quot;coercing&quot; for lack of a better word. And still, if <br/>
there&#39;s an unknown food, I have to read the ingredients and make the <br/>
decision, because neither of them is at the point they can do that <br/>
yet. If that&#39;s coercive, so be it. I don&#39;t see unschooling as <br/>
allowing my kids to die or live in terrible health.<br/>
<br/>
As far as leaving someplace, I always try to set up the situation so <br/>
that we don&#39;t get into a power struggle about leaving. I don&#39;t think <br/>
I&#39;ve had to pick my kids up since they were small toddlers. But <br/>
neither would it be negotiable if it is a rented space. If I knew <br/>
that transitioning away from the activity was likely to be a big <br/>
problem, I&#39;d probably try to set up the situation so that we had <br/>
something interesting to do next, even just a special Lego project at <br/>
home to do. But that doesn&#39;t always work. If it came down to it, yeah <br/>
I&#39;d pick my kid up and carry them out. At some point, I feel you have <br/>
to balance courtesy for others (like the group who might want to <br/>
continue renting that space, or the next group who had the space <br/>
rented) with your child&#39;s immediate comfort level. A lot of it is age <br/>
dependent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve tried to figure out how to do things so my children get to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>make <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; decisions on their own, but often times their decision doesn&#39;t just <br/>
 </span></blockquote>affect <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; me and my family, but it affects others.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a balancing act, for sure!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. How do you handle situations where a small child wants to do <br/>
 </span></blockquote>something, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but what he wants to do affects everyone, not just the child and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; family?   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try to think out of the box and find ways to make it work for <br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; An example of this is when my son was playing around and wouldn&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>get ready <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to go out to dinner.  Everyone was patiently waiting and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>encouraging him to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get ready.  It isn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t want to go, but because of his <br/>
 </span></blockquote>age, he <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has no sense of time, or no concern for others feelings.  My father-<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in-law <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; needed to eat soon because he&#39;s on a schedule like I am when it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>comes to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; eating. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, first of all, I&#39;d say that if your FIL needs to eat, that&#39;s <br/>
something he needs to take responsibility for. I also need to eat <br/>
frequently, and I&#39;m never without a small bag of nuts, a fruit <br/>
leather, some carrot sticks, etc. in my purse. That way I&#39;m not <br/>
dependent on anyone else&#39;s whims for getting my own needs taken care <br/>
of. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I&#39;d take a look at whether going out to a restaurant is a <br/>
good idea if you&#39;ve got a child that is going to make it difficult. <br/>
There were several years where we just didn&#39;t do restaurants because <br/>
the kids really weren&#39;t capable of sitting still, being quiet enough, <br/>
etc. and it would&#39;ve been a miserable situation. If you have to drag <br/>
a kid kicking and screaming to a restaurant, what&#39;s the point of <br/>
spending the money to have a nice meal, KWIM? So we try to set up <br/>
situations where everyone wins. If we wanted to have a nice meal at a <br/>
restaurant, we waited until my mom was visiting and could hang out <br/>
with the kids. <br/>
I&#39;m not trying to evade the question - there *are* times when a kid <br/>
has to do something they simply don&#39;t want to do. It might be <br/>
accompanying a parent to a doctor&#39;s appointment that they couldn&#39;t <br/>
schedule for any other time, and they couldn&#39;t find someone to be <br/>
with the kids. At those times, I just try my best to make it pleasant <br/>
for the kids. Bring along a special book or toy, etc.<br/>
If getting ready to go is a problem, get them ready before they start <br/>
playing. I&#39;ve found it&#39;s easier to ask my kids to get dressed, hair <br/>
combed, teeth brushed right when we get out of bed, for instance. If <br/>
I wait until they&#39;re deep in play and we need to get somewhere, it&#39;s <br/>
much more difficult and we end up being late. If need be, I&#39;ll put <br/>
their shoes in the car, and they can put them on when they get there. <br/>
With my kids at an age where time relevance and distractibility are <br/>
big issues, I just do my best to make it easy for them. Doesn&#39;t <br/>
always work though.<br/>
I find that when I am able to think creatively, find way to do things <br/>
I want to do that also keeps the kids happy, bring along distractions <br/>
for things they don&#39;t want to do, and try and help them as much as <br/>
possible with getting ready to go places, usually we have a fairly <br/>
easy time of it. <br/>
I also think it helps if you&#39;re usually easy-going. My kids know that <br/>
most of the time, I&#39;m willing to roll with their schedule. A two hour <br/>
playdate can often turn into a five hour playdate, and I&#39;m willing to <br/>
just hang around at a park or pool or beach just so they can have <br/>
more time with their friends. It helps that their friend&#39;s moms are <br/>
usually my good friends, so it&#39;s a bonus for all of us. :-) But given <br/>
all of that, when I do need to go someplace and we do have to leave, <br/>
they&#39;re usually pretty understanding because I don&#39;t arbitrarily <br/>
force them to do that all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I think the same thing goes for the swimming lessons. I explained to <br/>
them that, while I&#39;m perfectly willing to let them follow their <br/>
agenda on everything else, there&#39;s this one thing that I want them to <br/>
learn now, for their own safety. Neither of them has complained about <br/>
it or balked at it. I think they trust that if I feel it&#39;s important <br/>
enough to have them learn it now, then it is important. If I forced <br/>
them to learn other, more arbitrary things all the time, they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have that trust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862587190">I need some advice on what to offer to my DH as inspiration to support me in<br/>
homeschooling my 2 boys. Have any of you  had spouses that were not on board<br/>
in the beginning. My boys are young 5 and 2 1/2 and have not been in school<br/>
so i feel lucky that i am not being challanged on pulling them out. However,<br/>
my DH is  an admisitrator at a community college. Director of student life,<br/>
and he says he sees homeschoolers that don&#39;t function socially. Although i<br/>
don&#39;t buy that socialization myth, that is where he is. We are also coming<br/>
form a historu of educators in the Public Schools. His father was the<br/>
principal of the local school for 30 years. I would love some ideas to help<br/>
shape a paradigm shift for him.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; The mother ended up having to pick him up and take him out<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; because reasoning with him wasn&#39;t working.  Would most of you do things<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; differently in situations similar to this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Probably. I would have made somewhere else seem like a MUCH better place. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve carried kids out, but we&#39;ve all been happier when I could persuade them<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Way before I had children, I took education classes taught by school reform<br/>
&gt; advocates who had me read about Summerhill and John Holt and read the<br/>
&gt; inner-city-teaching books that were coming out then, late 1960&#39;s, early<br/>
&gt; 1970&#39;s.  Jonathan Kozol.  I forget who all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When the liberal modern methods didn&#39;t work so well because kids were forced<br/>
&gt; to be there and I was forced to give grades, and rank kids, and keep kids<br/>
&gt; &quot;showing progress&quot; and all that, it was discouraging.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Years passed.  I spent most of those ensuing years heavily involved in the<br/>
&gt; Society for Creative Anachronism, where people learn some pretty far-ranging<br/>
&gt; things for free, for fun, just because they need to know or want to know.<br/>
&gt; And I saw many of them get to the point that they had jobs doing costumes for<br/>
&gt; operas, or armor for museums, or calligraphy for government projects and<br/>
&gt; movies.  And lots more did it just for the joy of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I had Kirby I joined La Leche League, and through that a babysitting<br/>
&gt; co-op that devolved into just a playgroup after a few years.   There were<br/>
&gt; four homeschooling families in that co-op.  I didn&#39;t intend to homeschool,<br/>
&gt; but I and my kids knew these families in their homes, and knew their kids in<br/>
&gt; our homes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What a lucky lab situation for me!!  Two families were structured and two<br/>
&gt; were unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The main differences were the unschooled kids were nicer and more honest.<br/>
&gt; The unschooling families had warmer relationships with their kids.  Kids<br/>
&gt; would come up and sit with their moms and dads instead of avoiding them in<br/>
&gt; situations like barbecues or parties.  Those kids would have conversations<br/>
&gt; with me like I was just another kid, just another person.  The<br/>
&gt; structured-family kids were like kids who went to school.  I saw no<br/>
&gt; differences in the patterns or the relationships between the parents and<br/>
&gt; kids, even though these moms were as involved in La Leche League as others in<br/>
&gt; the group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then Kirby came to seem like a kid who should stay home.  I didn&#39;t consider<br/>
&gt; buying a curriculum.  I re-read all applicable books then in my possession<br/>
&gt; (Whole Child, Whole Parent; some Holt; Chop Wood, Carry Water), I subscribed<br/>
&gt; to Growing Without Schooling, and read each issue cover to cover, publication<br/>
&gt; declarations, ads and personals and all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I figured if it wasn&#39;t working I could switch to something else, but of<br/>
&gt; course it did work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So my transformation happened gradually and in the absence of kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There were three kids in there years before Kirby, who were 3, 10 and 12<br/>
&gt; (plus three years for each) who were in the custody of my first husband and<br/>
&gt; me.  His youngest sister and brother, and my half brother.  I learned a lot<br/>
&gt; of what didn&#39;t work, what might work, and what I could do better in the<br/>
&gt; future.  I was 21 to 24 during those years.<br/>

posting about a concern for too much TV. I too share that concern!  My 5yr<br/>

needs to me limited based on the fact that TV actually changes the way that<br/>
the brain forms! The neuron synapses are actually developed differently. The<br/>
other effects of tv  is that is filling thier brains with &quot;other peoples<br/>
ideas&quot; of the world and how to do things, what to buy, how to believe etc.<br/>
instead of having them go inside thmselves to discover there own creativity<br/>
and passions. Just as i don&#39;t want the school system to impose their ideas<br/>
as to what eh world should be and thoughts to have, so too i don&#39;t the TV to<br/>
dictate that  either.<br/>

We have a pool, so we&#39;re ULTRA-freaky about drowning! <br/>
<br/>
We never &quot;did&quot; swimming lessons. He spent most of his first years on the <br/>
steps or in our arms or with &quot;swimmies/wings/whatever-you-call-them&quot;. When HE <br/>
was ready, he took the wings off. He kept his head above water until HE was <br/>
ready to go under. He stayed near the edge until HE was ready to venture out. <br/>
He&#39;s a fish.<br/>
<br/>
He watched us. He felt us. He copied us. And he had the opportunity from <br/>
April (brrr) to November to swim almost daily. So he swims. And he doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to have to &quot;relearn&quot; every year as our friends&#39; children (who took <br/>
lessons) do. Maybe because he &quot;owns&quot; the learning.<br/>

I also enjoyed your post very much.  I wanted to share what worked for my<br/>
kids with regards to swimming.  They never had lessons.    My kids were<br/>
exposed to the water from the time they were babies.  I even dunked them<br/>
under, with their permission from the time they were really little.  They<br/>
saw me dunking under and comfortable in the water and didn&#39;t think it was<br/>
unusual.  I would blow in their faces and they would automatically hold<br/>
their breath, then I would immerse them, with a smile, and bring them back<br/>
up, telling them what a great job they did.  I NEVER did this unless they<br/>
agreed to it and knew it was coming.  They never inhaled the water.  <br/>
 <br/>
My kids knew they could trust me in the water.  When they were very small ,<br/>
I would swim on my back with them on my tummy, laying on their backs or<br/>
sitting up.  We spend the summers on the lake and in the winter we get a<br/>
three month membership to a local pool and gym.  I think the main thing that<br/>
has helped them, is that I am with them in the water all the time instead of<br/>
watching from the sidelines and that they have been exposed to the water a<br/>
*lot.*  <br/>
 <br/>
One child could swim underwater at 2 and keep her head above the water at 3.<br/>
The other could swim underwater at 3 and keep her head above at 4.  I showed<br/>
them how to float on their backs while they were little, so they knew they<br/>
could always rest if they needed to.  I supported them while they laid in<br/>
the water on their backs with my hand and gradually went to supporting them<br/>
with one finger, and eventually they trusted that they would float.  At 6<br/>
and 8, both are learning to do the crawl and the backstroke.  They want to<br/>
do them, because they see me doing them.   <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really like that method too, in *theory*. I&#39;ve got every book out <br/>
there about water babies, kids in water, everything. I read them all <br/>
before my kids were born. Both of my kids were born in birth tubs, <br/>
quite literally born into the water! I&#39;m a swimmer, have been a fish <br/>
all my life, never miss a chance to swim. I swim in lakes all summer, <br/>
oceans, rivers, pools - whenever I can! I&#39;ve been a lifeguard, a <br/>
swimming teacher, and a swim coach. I was pretty confident my kids <br/>
would love the water too, especially after reading all those <br/>
encouraging books. And for my daughter, she loved this method, she <br/>
was in the pool from when she was just a few weeks old. She&#39;s always <br/>
been a fish. If all my kids were like her, I&#39;d totally believe that <br/>
this method worked great for all kids! But my son is not like that at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
For my son it just didn&#39;t work. He screamed if his feet touched <br/>
water. He wouldn&#39;t go in water at all. It might help if people <br/>
understood what SID (sensory integration dysfunction) is, I guess. <br/>
Some SID people are very sensory avoidant, as in extremely so. <br/>
Mackenzie once screamed for an entire hour because one grain of sand <br/>
was on his foot (even after we got it off). On a 2 week vacation in <br/>
Hawaii, he not only wouldn&#39;t go in the water, he wouldn&#39;t walk on the <br/>
beach, nor would he be carried over the beach. We spent 14 days there <br/>
without going to the beach as a family. He never went near the pool. <br/>
It can be very difficult for kids like this to deal with extreme <br/>
sensory input, such as being immersed in water. As a baby, I knew <br/>
something was wrong, it just took us several years to figure it out. <br/>
<br/>
With Mackenzie, swimming lessons with an extremely patient teacher <br/>
were what worked best to get him into the water, get him used to it <br/>
and comfortable there (this was at age 5, mind you). One year later, <br/>
he&#39;s a fish! He liked the teacher, he liked the lessons, that&#39;s just <br/>
what happened to work for him. Plus, of course, we had done a ton of <br/>
work (dietary, occupational therapy, home exercises) to help his body <br/>
get past his SID issues that were making every day extremely <br/>
difficult for him. The combination, for him, worked great. Sure, I <br/>
wish it had been as easy as it was with his sister - just taking him <br/>
in as a baby and gradually getting him comfortable in the water - but <br/>
that was not to be. <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line was that we found something he enjoyed that helped him <br/>
get comfortable in the water. Now he wants to join the swim team, and <br/>
wants to do a kid&#39;s triathlon, so he&#39;s working hard on his freestyle <br/>
stroke. We watched an Ironman video last night so that he could see <br/>
what good swimmers do with their bodies under the water. He really <br/>
likes to be able to visualize doing something in order to do it with <br/>
his body (same way I learn, which is why I suggested watching the <br/>
video). <br/>
<br/>
Getting him to swim wasn&#39;t &quot;unschooling&quot; in that I did say that he <br/>
*needed* to learn how to swim, and I wasn&#39;t willing to wait for him <br/>
to want to do it (which might have been never). But we did work with <br/>
him to find a way that worked best for him. Immersing him as a baby, <br/>
toddler, or young child was just not going to cut it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t speak for the person who originally posted that t.v. <br/>
was &quot;known&quot; to change the workings of the brain, but I think that <br/>
many people who are doing attachment parenting and are in sync with <br/>
that way of thinking at some point read Joseph Chilton Pearce who <br/>
really goes off in a big way on t.v.  I think he had two books after <br/>
the Magical Child book that really went into detail about the horror <br/>
of t.v. and how everyone was going to end up stupid and it should be <br/>
absolutely avoided.  Basically, that the brain couldn&#39;t develop <br/>
correctly, that you would be skipping all sorts of developmental <br/>
stages and then, once that time was up, poof, you were wrecked.  <br/>
It&#39;s a little like the Waldorf way of thinking about stages <br/>
of &quot;incarnation&quot; or whatever.  I also think that Holt plugged <br/>
Pearce&#39;s book, and you might get to the Magical Child through John <br/>
Holt as well.  I read the Magical Child and the one after that, <br/>
something like Evolution&#39;s End (?) and they stuck with me a long <br/>
time, because they were so fatalistic in many ways.  Extremely <br/>
scary, if you took them to heart.  I think some of his ideas may <br/>
come into my head when my own children are in front of the t.v., as <br/>
well, and it is hard to shake.  I would have to go back and look at <br/>
his specific wording and documentation, but I think for many people, <br/>
these books may have left traces of fear and horror.  I did premed <br/>
in college, but I can&#39;t remember much of it and don&#39;t really know <br/>
how the neurons form and what not (Shyrley?).  I&#39;m not that <br/>
compelled to look it up.  My children, well, mostly the older one <br/>
(4) does watch some t.v., and right now when we have just moved to <br/>
Vermont in the midst of the coldest winter I&#39;ve ever experienced, we <br/>
have it on for a couple hours a day, which is way more than we are <br/>
used to (we are used to going outside all winter and messing around <br/>
in puddles in Seattle -- here it is below zero most days and windy, <br/>
and you start gasping when you are outside for more than 10 <br/>
minutes).  We have plenty of things to do here, in terms of books <br/>
and art projects and toys and games, but then we get tired and the <br/>
t.v. comes on so we can just lay around and veg really.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that Joseph Chilton Pearce knows that much about <br/>
everything (he is not a science expert that I am aware of), but I <br/>
don&#39;t know for sure.  Can someone just tell me he is full of it <br/>
please?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, cool.  Now I can relax!  Ha ha.  There seem to be many <br/>
homeschooling families who just don&#39;t own t.v.&#39;s, probably for a <br/>
variety of reasons, but maybe because they think that t.v.&#39;s are <br/>
inherently very bad for people?  So there is that thought that goes <br/>
through the homeschooling culture for sure.  I&#39;m not totally <br/>
convinced that t.v. is &quot;good&quot; for a person, but maybe it&#39;s not <br/>
really bad either, huh?  I do know that for myself, if I watch much <br/>
t.v., it feels a little addictive and I tend to forget how much time <br/>
has passed, and that there were other things that I had planned to <br/>
do that I might have enjoyed more, had I actually gotten them <br/>
started, but then it gets late and I don&#39;t feel like dragging out <br/>
something to start on, and there it goes.  Sometimes it feels like a <br/>
huge time wasting mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
Are there people on this list that DON&#39;T own t.v.&#39;s?  Just wondering.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar note, the first homeschooled family of teenaged kids <br/>
that I met, in Seattle, who got me onto the idea of unschooling for <br/>
my own kids, were just about the coolest beings I had ever met.  I <br/>
just absolutely gravitated towards them.  They were marvelous <br/>
beings.  I would have enjoyed them as friends, and I had never <br/>
thought that about 15, 16 and 17 year olds before.  Anyway, their <br/>
parents were asked by a group forum &quot;well, what did you do, if you <br/>
didn&#39;t have textbooks, didn&#39;t have any curriculum or course of <br/>
study?&quot;  The parents looked at each other and laughed.  The mom sort <br/>
of sheepishly responded, &quot;well, we read aloud every day, sometimes <br/>
for about 2-3 hours&quot;, trying to make it seem like they had done <br/>
something &quot;productive&quot;.  And the father, very proud of the fact that <br/>
the kids were so marvelous and hadn&#39;t done things in the &quot;usual&quot; <br/>
manner, said, &quot;heck, they really just played video games all day!  <br/>
Seriously.  Like 3-4 hours of video games every day.&quot;  He was <br/>
probably over simplifying, but at the time I thought that was so <br/>
amazing.  Had they REALLY played video games all day?  The kids were <br/>
all musical marvels in truth, and had played music half the day and <br/>
video games the other (okay, and probably done a few other things in <br/>
between).  But, I remember some people just kind of dismissing the <br/>
whole family at that point, saying something like, &quot;well, I was so <br/>
disappointed to hear that they played video games.  And did you hear <br/>
their grammar?  It was horrible.  I won&#39;t want my kids playing video <br/>
games all day, that&#39;s for sure.&quot;  Their grammar, to me, was <br/>
impeccable, actually.  They used colloquialisms, because they were <br/>
hip and were teenagers.  But they didn&#39;t make errors in grammar, I <br/>
don&#39;t think.  For the nay sayers, though, I think it was just a way <br/>
of dismissing something that didn&#39;t fit into one&#39;s framework -- the <br/>
video game thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really in sync with the movement, but there is an article on <br/>
the Taking Children Seriously site by the physicist David D (can&#39;t <br/>
recall spelling) about computer games, that is worth reading.  He <br/>
basically says that people see that kids like something, in this <br/>
instance computer games, and they immediately set out to prove that <br/>
it is bad.  He thinks that they never have any real evidence, but <br/>
that they already determine ahead of time that the thing (whatever <br/>
it is) that kids like is bad and they just bring a bunch of semi-<br/>
evidence together to try to prove their point.  But that the truth <br/>
is, the fact that the kids like it so much is what is bothering them <br/>
in the first place.  It just doesn&#39;t sit well with them type thing.  <br/>
Good article, anyway.<br/>

&gt; &gt; As a responsible parent, you should look at more than one person&#39;s<br/>
&gt; evidence.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are two anti-TV books &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t speak for the person who originally posted that t.v.<br/>
&gt; was &quot;known&quot; to change the workings of the brain, but I think that<br/>
&gt; many people who are doing attachment parenting and are in sync with<br/>
&gt; that way of thinking at some point read Joseph Chilton Pearce who<br/>
&gt; really goes off in a big way on t.v.  I think he had two books after<br/>
&gt; the Magical Child book that really went into detail about the horror<br/>
&gt; of t.v. and how everyone was going to end up stupid and it should be<br/>
&gt; absolutely avoided.  Basically, that the brain couldn&#39;t develop<br/>
&gt; correctly, that you would be skipping all sorts of developmental<br/>
&gt; stages and then, once that time was up, poof, you were wrecked.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a little like the Waldorf way of thinking about stages<br/>
&gt; of &quot;incarnation&quot; or whatever.  I also think that Holt plugged<br/>
&gt; Pearce&#39;s book, and you might get to the Magical Child through John<br/>
&gt; Holt as well.  I read the Magical Child and the one after that,<br/>
&gt; something like Evolution&#39;s End (?) and they stuck with me a long<br/>
&gt; time, because they were so fatalistic in many ways.  Extremely<br/>
&gt; scary, if you took them to heart.  I think some of his ideas may<br/>
&gt; come into my head when my own children are in front of the t.v., as<br/>
&gt; well, and it is hard to shake.  I would have to go back and look at<br/>
&gt; his specific wording and documentation, but I think for many people,<br/>
&gt; these books may have left traces of fear and horror.  I did premed<br/>
&gt; in college, but I can&#39;t remember much of it and don&#39;t really know<br/>
&gt; how the neurons form and what not (Shyrley?).  I&#39;m not that<br/>
&gt; compelled to look it up.  My children, well, mostly the older one<br/>
&gt; (4) does watch some t.v., and right now when we have just moved to<br/>
&gt; Vermont in the midst of the coldest winter I&#39;ve ever experienced, we<br/>
&gt; have it on for a couple hours a day, which is way more than we are<br/>
&gt; used to (we are used to going outside all winter and messing around<br/>
&gt; in puddles in Seattle -- here it is below zero most days and windy,<br/>
&gt; and you start gasping when you are outside for more than 10<br/>
&gt; minutes).  We have plenty of things to do here, in terms of books<br/>
&gt; and art projects and toys and games, but then we get tired and the<br/>
&gt; t.v. comes on so we can just lay around and veg really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think that Joseph Chilton Pearce knows that much about<br/>
&gt; everything (he is not a science expert that I am aware of), but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know for sure.  Can someone just tell me he is full of it<br/>
&gt; please?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, keeping a keen eye on neurological research as I do, I&#39;ve never seen his name in any journal. While not all aspects of brain development are understood those studies which have been done properly<br/>
don&#39;t assign any problems to TV in itself. Problems develop when human interaction is missing from the rest of the child&#39;s life.<br/>
Pop news shows then take bits of studies and come up with fearsome headlines &#39;TV STOPS BRAIN DEVELOPMENT!!!!!!!!!&#39; etc when if you read the research it turns out that there is a statistical correlation<br/>
between low achievemnt and hours of TV watched in *some* families. Further reading of the study usually reveals that those families are ones where the child is left with the electronic babysitter and<br/>
rarely spoken too or read too.<br/>
It&#39;s also a long leap to then say TV affects actual neural development, especially since we can&#39;t really know that 100% without examining the brain itself. And thats unethical.<br/>
<br/>
100 years ago there was an outcry against women learning cos it would &#39;affect their brains, make them man-like and shrivel their uterus&#39;s&#39;<br/>
uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, don&#39;t believe everything you read in a book. It&#39;s been sold with an agenda. I mean, how many would he have sold if he&#39;d written &#39;Hey parents, you&#39;re all doing great and I&#39;m not going to make<br/>
you feel guilty.&#39;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But the question is how does the research stack up against real live<br/>
unschooled kids with no limits? Theories are great, but if they don&#39;t<br/>
describe what happens in reality, then how great are they really?<br/>
<br/>
Here we have a bunch of families that don&#39;t limit TV but haven&#39;t seen the<br/>
negative effects everyone predicts will happen. Kids who aren&#39;t limited<br/>
treat TV a lot like they treat books. It&#39;s a resource. And like books, some<br/>
like it more than others.<br/>
<br/>
One thing it&#39;s helpful to keep in mind when reading reasearch about kids is<br/>
that all studies are based on schooled kids. Kids who watch TV after school<br/>
are watching it for different reasons than unschooled kids who have free<br/>
access. Schooled kids often watch TV as down time from the pressures of<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
School comes at a huge emotional and time cost. There&#39;s not just the time<br/>
spent there, but the time spent getting ready, time spent doing homework,<br/>
time spent recovering. That doesn&#39;t leave a lot of time for them to do other<br/>
more creative things. Not to mention reconnecting with their families.<br/>
<br/>
Hhow many adults come home from work ready engage in activities that are<br/>
creative or could spark creativity? Is it blamed on TV? Or is it seen<br/>
clearly as a result of work?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shyrley, I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your posts. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And did you know that in Jane Austen&#39;s time the novel was <br/>
considered a dreadful source of rubbish not fit for the educated? <br/>
Her novel Northanger Abbey makes lots of allusions to this fact. <br/>
People had to hide that they enjoyed reading fiction! Reminds <br/>
me of our current television debate.<br/>
<br/>
My prediction is that TV will stop being considered dangerous <br/>
after  couple hundred years go by and we find something else to <br/>
harp on.<br/>
<br/>
Since we&#39;ve stopped being TV paranoid, I&#39;ve been amazed at <br/>
how much *I&#39;ve* learned by watching TV again.<br/>
