<div id="ygrps-yiv-56497872">My 12 yr old wants to play <br/>
Animal Crossing with others- using the wireless connection.<br/>
<br/>
Any animal crossing players out there?<br/>
Do you have a wireless connection setup on your Nintendo ?<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you want a long distance friend... i suppose this is<br/>
sort of like a pen pal ... but only for animal crossing.<br/>
<br/>
THX, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366929364">you can play one of 2 ways-<br/>
<br/>
- within 30ft range of the other player... like in the same room/house.<br/>
or<br/>
- using a wireless Internet.<br/>
<br/>
but for security reasons- you must know the name of the person you want to<br/>
play with so you can connect to them by knowing their player name.  you can<br/>
not search for random people who are playing at the same time .  so... thats<br/>
why we were trying to find a like minded- maybe- homeschooler- to play with<br/>
via wireless interenet.<br/>
