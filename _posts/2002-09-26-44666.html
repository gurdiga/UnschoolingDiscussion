<div id="ygrps-yiv-179015076">I sure hope you guys going to the conference will talk about it lots and lots when you get back!!! I want to know alllll about it! LOL<br/>

<br/>
  Sure!  Come on out!  But not until after the conference.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe you should take your neighbor cookies, and offer to help him, tell him <br/>
  stories about how cool your kids are and ask if he&#39;d like you to come over <br/>
  EVERY day to reassure him about homeschooling!  He&#39;ll say no. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
