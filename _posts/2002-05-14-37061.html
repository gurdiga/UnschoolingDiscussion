<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917826520">I am a homeschooling mother of four children ranging in ages from 7 <br/>
to 17 years.  Finances have always been tight for us, but we <br/>
managed.  Well, in the past two years I had the opportunity to begin <br/>
doing medical transcription at home.  I had been feeling the need to <br/>
develop a job skill for the future and to add to the family&#39;s <br/>
finances.  So, I began to work.  It really is a good thing.  I am <br/>
still present for the kids at home.  I can still stop to drive <br/>
someone somewhere, etc.  However, I feel a little bit driven with <br/>
housework, trying to do an hour of math or history in the mornings, <br/>
facilitate social interactions for the kids, etc.  I would be <br/>
interested in hearing about other people&#39;s experiences with working <br/>
and homeschooling.  <br/>
