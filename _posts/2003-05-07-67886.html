<div id="ygrps-yiv-466839352">-=-You know, I think you took what I said all wrong. I don&#39;t believe in <br/>
<br/>
whatever. We can never really have all the knowledge we need. We <br/>
<br/>
learn new things everyday. Maybe this list isn&#39;t for me then, if I <br/>
<br/>
can&#39;t express my opinion and thoughts. I thought it was very well <br/>
<br/>
written. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Tammy, you could be right about me taking it wrong.  I&#39;m sorry.  I saw yours <br/>
and responded before i saw the original question.   Everyone learns new <br/>
things every  day, but they don&#39;t need to be TAUGHT new things in most cases. <br/>
 Too much teaching can cause people to expect and to need more teaching.<br/>
<br/>
So I think this is what you responded to: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- Do we choose unschooling <br/>
<br/>
 because of our learning style or our child&#39;s learning style or <br/>
<br/>
 because it&#39;s &quot;right&quot;?  If you had a child who loves to read and do <br/>
<br/>
workbooks, would you school at home instead?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If not, please feel free to clarify.  You hadn&#39;t quoted anything before you <br/>
&quot;shared,&quot; and looking back I see that the whole post was appended at the <br/>
bottom.  I didn&#39;t read past your signature and for a new member to the group, <br/>
what you wrote seemed not to show much regard to unschooling as an ideal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry if I misunderstood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135094356">any artists who work at home in a studio while they unschool their kids?<br/>
<br/>
i have some challenges right now related to discovering how to pursue<br/>
my art.  sorry, this post is just about myself and my deschooling and<br/>
is not related directly to my daughter&#39;s learning except in how it<br/>
will help me get out of the way of her learning.  i just sent a post<br/>
to the list about how i found it so hard to read for pleasure after<br/>
attending university English literature classes.  well, i have a<br/>
similar thing going on with learning art.<br/>
<br/>
i want to do art for a career; i was lucky to meet a mentor who really<br/>
turned me on to my ability to express myself in painting-- this is<br/>
when i was 16.  he showed me to own my own learning process and not<br/>
jump through other peoples&#39; hoops-- i think this is where i first<br/>
discovered the spirit of unschooling, though i didn&#39;t call it that at<br/>
the time, and it didn&#39;t spill over into other areas of my life until<br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
i knew at that age that there was no chance in hell i would ever<br/>
attend an institution to study art.  i saw art schools as highly<br/>
competitive, arbitrary, and insular.  i cared so much about it because<br/>
i cared so much about what it meant for me to paint.  anyway, i am<br/>
left in the position now of never having attended an art institution<br/>
but being at the point where i need the skills, community, and backing<br/>
that getting a degree provides.  at least, i think i do.  i would like<br/>
to be able to attend school to learn what i need to learn, but i don&#39;t<br/>
want to get &quot;swallowed up&quot; by the idiocy of it.  so i am just<br/>
wondering if anyone has any experience related to this?  is there a<br/>
way to build artistic community and learn specific skills and<br/>
techniques without university?<br/>
<br/>
i have taken an art class when my daughter was old enough to be okay<br/>
with me leaving, and i hated it and loved it at the same time.  i find<br/>
myself coming home from university and writing reams of discourse in<br/>
my journals about all the things i would change if i ruled the world.<br/>
&lt;g&gt; there is another part of me who feels all i need to do is learn<br/>
how to do art for the pleasure of it and the meaning of it and that&#39;s<br/>
all, but then i see that i have probably spent the last 10 years<br/>
trying to do it on my own, and i don&#39;t see a lot of &quot;results&quot; (meaning<br/>
works produced) by this method.  i also feel i am living way below my<br/>
potential.  hope i made sense.  thanks, jana</div>
