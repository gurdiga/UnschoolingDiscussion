from 800padutch.com:<br/>
Do Amish children go to school?<br/>
<br/>
Yes...for the many Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite children living in <br/>
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the ringing school bell signals a time to <br/>
shift attention from field work to school work, a time to drop the hoe and <br/>
pick up a pencil. <br/>
Old Order children attend one-room schools through the eighth grade and are <br/>
usually taught by a young, unmarried Christian woman. As a result of the <br/>
County&#39;s growing Old Order population, enrollment in their one-room schools <br/>
is surging. During recent years Old Order leaders have been over-seeing the <br/>
construction of new one-room school buildings at the rate of about five per <br/>
year.<br/>
A 1972 Supreme Court ruling exempted the Old Order sects from compulsory <br/>
attendance laws beyond the eighth grade. The one-room schools restrict <br/>
worldly influences and stress the basics such as reading, writing and <br/>
arithmetic. The importance of the community and cooperation among its members <br/>
are also emphasized<br/>
