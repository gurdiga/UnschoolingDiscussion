PRESS RELEASE<br/>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- October 14, 2003HOMESCHOOLERS:   SEND CBS NEWS BACK <br/>
TO THE BOOKS<br/>
<br/>
(RALEIGH) -- An &quot;Eye on America&quot; segment in the October 13 edition of The CBS <br/>
Evening News suggested that a tragic murder-suicide in a rural county two <br/>
years ago was somehow evidence of the &quot;dark side&quot; of home-schooling. <br/>
Correspondent Vince Gonzales portrayed home education as a haven for potential abusers and <br/>
worse. In fact, the Warren family -- whose 14-year-old son killed two <br/>
teen-aged siblings and then himself in July 2001 -- had chosen to duck North <br/>
Carolina&#39;s homeschool law. CBS News could show no evidence that the Warrens were <br/>
typical of homeschoolers, or that this senseless tragedy would have been averted by <br/>
more educational regulations.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT CBS OVERLOOKED<br/>
<br/>
In North Carolina, homeschooling has grown from a few dozen families in 1984 <br/>
to nearly 29,000 this year. Considering there are well over 100,000 N.C. <br/>
parents and children in home education today, a two-year-old tragedy involving a <br/>
single family -- already in trouble -- is so rare and remarkable that it defies <br/>
logical connection. <br/>
<br/>
There are other facts which CBS failed to mention; for example, there were <br/>
already numerous child protection laws and regulations on the books that state <br/>
agencies could have used to safeguard the Warren children. Social Services had <br/>
not only contacted the family on numerous occasions -- they had already <br/>
removed the children from the home for a time. In spite of all the laws and agencies <br/>
in place and involved, the system was still not able to prevent the deaths of <br/>
these children. And besides that, long before the tragedy occurred, the <br/>
family had consciously dropped out of compliance with the homeschool statute, and <br/>
from that point on they were simply truant from the public school system.<br/>
<br/>
Given then a truant family, with a criminal record in another state, already <br/>
reported to Social Services by their neighbors and receiving regular contact <br/>
from them -- how many rules, how many systems, how much intervention does it <br/>
take to prevent an unpredictable and senseless tragedy? <br/>
<br/>
If a family chooses to disregard the law entirely, how could more rules help? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And how can such a singular case guide policy toward 100,000 other citizens <br/>
who comply with the existing law? <br/>
<br/>
THE REAL STORY<br/>
<br/>
The real story is that homeschooling is a proven path to educational <br/>
achievement and preparation for adulthood and citizenship -- without government <br/>
funding, assistance, or direction. Our organization, North Carolinians for Home <br/>
Education, has a twenty-year history of service to the homeschool community. Tens <br/>
of thousands of parents and students have attended our conferences, seminars, <br/>
and other events, and we are privileged to know large numbers of these <br/>
families personally. And we know that first-hand observation confirms the reports of <br/>
numerous scholars and researchers -- these are strong, active, and law-abiding <br/>
families, producing a generation of bright and sociable graduates -- <br/>
well-equipped for college, career, or families of their own.<br/>
<br/>
( CONTINUED )<br/>
<br/>
The case highlighted by CBS News was not a matter of educational choice, but <br/>
of murder and suicide -- motive unknown -- and something far more serious than <br/>
whether students learn phonics, or which algebra book they use, or even <br/>
whether taught by their parents or by government-certified educators. <br/>
<br/>
When one family has chosen to disregard the law, there is no logic to <br/>
tightening a regulatory vice on 29,000 North Carolina families that do play by the <br/>
rules. <br/>
<br/>
And using old news to suggest that parents who desire the freedom to choose <br/>
their children&#39;s schooling arrangements are part of a sinister pattern of <br/>
abuse, neglect, and worse -- to coin a phrase, it simply doesn&#39;t add up. Maybe CBS <br/>
News should review their notes.<br/>

Hi <br/>
I am new to this list but been unschooling my 9 year old son for a few years. <br/>
I cried as I read this post, Sandra. I feel it might be worth some regulation just to be able to protect the children who are being abused and must feel so alone. No one knows and no one cares. <br/>
Don&#39;t have any brilliant ideas but wanted to share these feelings.<br/>

their parents. The parents were previously convicted of child abuse. <br/>
That news report should have been about how social services failed <br/>
those children. And maybe a side note about how it is clear that <br/>
regulating homeschooling is a misplaced effort since that family in <br/>
North Carolina, where they already do have more homeschool regulations <br/>
in place than many other states, wasn&#39;t even in compliance with their <br/>
current regulations. What good would even more regulations do?<br/>
<br/>
It is sad. It is tragic. It isn&#39;t a homeschooling issue.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465381174">But the problem is that the homeschool regulations don&#39;t address the issue<br/>
of abuse -- even in the highly regulated states (like PA where I live) you<br/>
are at most, required to see an evaluator once a year (and I think you can<br/>
even do the evaluation by phone).  The state might step in if your 16 yo<br/>
can&#39;t read, it won&#39;t have any information as to whether she is having sex<br/>
with her father.<br/>
<br/>
And the people in the CBS story (as I understand it from second-hand email<br/>
reports) weren&#39;t complying with the regulations already in place and WERE<br/>
already under the notice of the appropriate social services agencies which<br/>
weren&#39;t doing anything.<br/>
<br/>
Is the only solution (and one that clearly doesn&#39;t work all the time) to<br/>
have daily government inspections....er...indoctrination...er..<br/>
education....?<br/>

&lt;&lt; It is sad. It is tragic. It isn&#39;t a homeschooling issue. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If homeschoolers totally deny the possibility, though, it&#39;s just our <br/>
ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My main irritation with Bowling for Columbine is that of all the stretches of <br/>
&quot;logic&quot; taken to try to explain school shootings, school itself was just <br/>
about spared!!  SCHOOLS CAUSE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, not video games, not parents, not <br/>
Lockheed missile plants, not George Bush.  The only person on that <br/>
&quot;documentary&quot; who said &quot;schools&quot; was Matt Stone, one of the South Park creators/artists.<br/>
<br/>
Someone saying school shootings are not the school&#39;s fault is probably <br/>
telling the truth by one definition of &quot;fault&quot; (whole and unshared fault), but <br/>
homeschooling CAN (and I would bet anything does) hide abuse, and those who want to <br/>
abuse can (thanks to the work of many people like us) and some do homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
The one family discussed on the news was one that had lots of contact with <br/>
social services.  We can&#39;t ethically tie a bow around them and say &quot;exception,  <br/>
not a homeschooling issue, they&#39;re the only ones.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re probably not the only ones.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t solve that problem, but I don&#39;t think totally burying it is right <br/>
either.  <br/>
<br/>
At some point the fulcrum point is crossed, and the rhetoric which protects <br/>
our rights to privacy could create a little too much privacy for bad guys.<br/>

should be caring for them?<br/>
<br/>
THAT nobody is denying.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I&#39;m denying is that ncreasing homeschooling regulations <br/>
will help the situation.<br/>
<br/>
If I thought that imposing regulations on homeschoolers would help, I&#39;d <br/>
be first to lobby for such regulations. I WISH that all it would take <br/>
would be the rest of us willing to have our kids tested once a year or <br/>
report our curriculum to the local school district. I&#39;d support it IF I <br/>
thought there was a chance that any child would be protected from <br/>
abusive parents because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t going to work. Law-abiding homeschoolers will <br/>
have to bear the burden of excessive regulations while abusive parents <br/>
will hide their kids just like they do now.<br/>

<br/>
No.  My personal wish is that all the homeschoolers who might ever talk to <br/>
anyone outside of other homeschoolers will just be aware that there are <br/>
separatist, crazed, gun-toting, snake-handling, neglectful, abusive homeschoolers so <br/>
that they  never make the embarrassing mistake of saying that anyone who would <br/>
think there ARE such things are idiots.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like that famous rhetorical three-legged dog.  I&#39;ve seen three different <br/>
real-life and functional three-legged dogs now without even trying, over my <br/>
lifetime.  It seemed really important to me to explain to my children the <br/>
importance of three-legged dogs.<br/>
<br/>
The importance of three-legged dogs is this:  Any statement that says all <br/>
dogs have four legs is false.  MOST dogs have four legs is true.  <br/>
<br/>
Any statement that says all homeschoolers love their children and have open <br/>
liberal ideas about exposing their children to all the best the world has to <br/>
offer is false.  A statement that says MOST homeschoolers love their children <br/>

Harassed teachers with 30+ kids fail to pick it up or they don&#39;t care or <br/>
the child is already known to social services, like Victoria Climbie in <br/>
London, who fail to prevent their deaths or abuse.<br/>
Short of having a social worker live with each family, school or <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have not had a chance to see this and would like to.  One major <br/>
issue that I felt was not dealt with enough after the shootings was <br/>
that of bullies.  It was mentioned but never explored in detail, <br/>
maybe for the reason of not blaming the victims (the other <br/>
students).  This is understandable, but personally I felt shooters <br/>
behavior was largely created by daily abuse from other students.  If <br/>
humiliated enough, eventually you lash out.  It is horrible their <br/>
pain was not seen MUCH earlier.  If it had, possibly interventions <br/>
years before could have stopped their anger.  NOt to say in any way, <br/>
their behavior was excusable or justifiable.  Instead to say that <br/>
this is another case where children were abused within the walls of <br/>
schools and here is an extreme case of what can happen when there is <br/>
are no guidelines in place to moniter and deal with bullying <br/>
behavior.  This is certainly a much more common occurance than <br/>
abusive homeschooling parents.  Also, we do not see news reports <br/>
claiming the need for more government regualtions on parents whose <br/>
children have been caught bullying in schools.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with some other posters.  These people were not <br/>
technically homeschoolers.  If you are not complying with any <br/>
regualtions than you are turant, that should have been picked up by <br/>
soical services earlier and the children should have been checked <br/>
for that reason.  If you do not comply with homeschool regualtions, <br/>
I would think it would be the social workers who would be given your <br/>
case therefore making it an entirely different department.  I do not <br/>
feel I should carry the burden of such people anymore than when I <br/>
was a teacher did I feel I would be clumped into a catagory of <br/>
teachers that abused their children (i.e. a case just a few weeks <br/>
ago in Miami where a teacher and assistant used duct tape to tape <br/>
the mouths of offending kindergardeners.)<br/>

Yeah.  Those points would be good to make if people talk about abuse and <br/>
homeschooling.  <br/>
There are lots of parents, too, who seem to totally neglect their kids, think <br/>
school will pick up all the slack--breakfast, social support, sex ed, moral <br/>
guidance, art and music. And for every one of them, there&#39;s another parent <br/>
saying &quot;It&#39;s not your place to tell my kid what&#39;s right or wrong.&quot;<br/>

So some kids are neglected at home AND neglected at school, and that&#39;s so sad <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185305036">Pam&#39;s point goes to the heart of what&#39;s wrong with most school reform <br/>

       If there were one answer that really worked for everyone and for <br/>
society, there would only be one answer. No one would debate it or argue that it <br/>
was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
       And no one would be ignorant, unemployed, fat, abused, poor or <br/>
unloved.<br/>
<br/>
       But whatever it is that one wishes to foster or prevent, there is NO <br/>
clear answer  that works for all individuals, or for society generally. <br/>
Thinking for oneself comes about as close to a silver bullet for all these problems <br/>

much better bet to bring about any social good than regulation and inspection, <br/>

there&#39;s no option, it&#39;s not mentioned as a factor.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling, though, being not only an option but an inconvenient option, <br/>
just glows and glares.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s Catholic and robs a filling station nobody&#39;s going to say &quot;A <br/>
5&#39;10&quot; Catholic man robbed the Texaco...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s something unusual about him, though, THEN it&#39;s going to be <br/>
mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
A Mormon missionary on a bicycle robbed the Texaco...<br/>
That will make news.<br/>
<br/>
A 4&#39;2&quot; man with satanic symbols tattooed on his neck robbed the Texaco at <br/>
gunpoint.  Yeah.    Then his height and apparent religion might be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
So for now, being a homeschooler is like being a dishonest missionary or a <br/>
Satanic midget (little person of an anti-Christian persuasion).   <br/>
<br/>
For years if someone did something AND was in the SCA, we&#39;d hear about it.  <br/>
<br/>
Years passed, and being in the SCA just wasn&#39;t worth mentioning anymore.  It <br/>
was too common, and not seen as a factor that would drive people to stick <br/>
knives in each other&#39;s doors or to threaten a gas-company meter reader with a <br/>
rattan sword.  (That one was reported without SCA mention, but we all knew what a <br/>
duct-taped piece of rattan was.)<br/>
<br/>
D&D used to be worth of mention too.  If a kid&#39;s car swerved off the road and <br/>
dice fell out, they&#39;d mention he was a reclusive D&D player.   <br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling will pass as an identifying factor, I think.  Give it just <br/>
about enough years that all OUR kids are grown up.  :-/<br/>

&gt;&gt; knives in each other&#39;s doors or to threaten a gas-company meter reader<br/>
&gt;&gt; with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; rattan sword.  (That one was reported without SCA mention, but we all<br/>
&gt;&gt; knew what a<br/>
&gt;&gt; duct-taped piece of rattan was.)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; D&D used to be worth of mention too.  If a kid&#39;s car swerved off the<br/>
&gt;&gt; road and<br/>
&gt;&gt; dice fell out, they&#39;d mention he was a reclusive D&D player.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Homeschooling will pass as an identifying factor, I think.  Give it  <br/>
&gt;&gt; just<br/>
&gt;&gt; about enough years that all OUR kids are grown up.  :-/<br/>

some of the information from it - if you&#39;re writing to CBS. The first <br/>
is something they wrote to homeschooling leaders and that is followed <br/>
by their weekly &quot;e-lert&quot; which goes to HSLDA members or anybody who <br/>

 &gt; titled &quot;The Dark Side of Homeschooling&quot; and will run a further<br/>
 </span></blockquote>report<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; this evening. The reports focus on a handful of child abuse cases<br/>
 &gt; during the past 5 to 10 years involving families claiming to be<br/>
 &gt; homeschoolers.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Last night&#39;s segment discussed the murder of Kyle, 13, and Marnie<br/>
 &gt; Warren, 19, by their brother Brandon, 14, and his subsequent<br/>

 &gt; We are outraged that CBS would ignore the obvious facts and draw the<br/>
 &gt; erroneous conclusion that homeschoolers need to be strictly<br/>
 &gt; regulated. The story is a shameless attempt to smear an entire<br/>

 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; The real story is CBS&#39;s bias against homeschooling and it is using<br/>
 &gt; this distorted story to encourage the regulation of homeschoolers.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Please call Viacom (parent company of CBS) and CBS to express your<br/>
 &gt; opposition to the biased reporting and smear campaign against<br/>
 &gt; homeschooling. Highlight the fact that homeschooling was not the<br/>

I also told CBS that I would be boycotting the advertisers of the show and I&#39;ll be telling the advertisers that....hell...I may boycott CBS! Perhaps we could go to the petition site - circulate it and send it to CBS. We could demand that they present the real facts of homeschooling.<br/>
