<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560653548"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Arithmetic is the manipulation of numbers.  It&#39;s a basic part of much math,<br/>
&gt; but nowhere near the entire thing.  It&#39;s just the part that schools seem to<br/>
&gt; focus on, at least until you get to graduate level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Linda - What a great post on math.  I think the above is what I&#39;m <br/>
referring to when I say that dh and ds really &quot;get&quot; math and dd and I <br/>
don&#39;t.  Both my daughter and I are great at computation - at plugging <br/>
numbers into formulas and that is what ps rewarded.   Dh struggles <br/>
with his students all the time who say - if you can just give me the <br/>
formula,  I can do it.  Problem is - they can&#39;t figure out what <br/>
formula they need or why they need it.  Ds sees the bigger picture.<br/>
He looks at it first,  and then figures out what it all means.  I <br/>
think a lot of unschoolers are like this because they haven&#39;t been <br/>
taught to rely on the formula or the memorized rules.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651909501"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; OK, let me try again.  Does unschooling teach a child to recognize<br/>
&gt; &gt; the mathematic symbols used in textbooks?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; a child anything.  They learn, which is<br/>
&gt; different.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But do unschoolers learn the mathematic symbols used in textbooks? <br/>
&gt; Sure, if they have a reason to do so.  If they want to be able to<br/>
&gt; communicate math concepts, then yes, they&#39;ll need to learn standard<br/>
&gt; notation, just like if they want to write to someone and have it<br/>
&gt; understandable, they need to learn how to write in the language they<br/>
&gt; speak.  Same thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  To comment on mathematical symbols to both of you, Sterling at only <br/>
3yo has demonstrated that he knows the math symbols on several <br/>
occasions.  where he learned them from, i don&#39;t know.  he&#39;s always <br/>
had a fascination with calculators and perhaps while playing with <br/>
them he&#39;s asked me &quot;what&#39;s this&quot; and i just answered him without <br/>
thinking about it.   We&#39;ve also played some math games on the <br/>
internet and maybe he&#39;s picked it up from reading outloud.  a couple <br/>
months ago, we got the book &quot;One guinea pig is not enough&quot; from the <br/>
library.  it&#39;s a really cute story that incorporates simple math <br/>
equations into the story.  he read 1 + 1 as 1 plus 1.   another cute <br/>
story &quot;bunches and bunches of bunnies&quot; is similiar but multipication. <br/>
 he read 10 X 10 as 10 times 10.   so yes, they do learn to recognize <br/>
the math symbols without a math textbook.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; From the unschoolers I&#39;ve known math<br/>
&gt; &gt; is mostly mental math - which is great - yet I don&#39;t see where<br/>
&gt; &gt; they experience the math sentence and different layouts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; mathematic problems on paper.  I would think this could<br/>
&gt; &gt; potentially cause a problem at some point would it not?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think this is an interesting thing to think about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I love the movie &quot;Little Man Tate&quot;.   and my question is, if a child <br/>
can do mental math, then why would we want to force them to put it <br/>
down on paper?  I always envied people who could calculate simple <br/>
math in their heads faster than i could reach for the calculator or <br/>
paper and pencil.  and when doing complex math mentally?  whew!  <br/>
these people deserve a medal in my opinion, not criticism of their <br/>
inadequacy cuz they can&#39;t put it on paper or rather &quot;don&#39;t need&quot; paper!  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All along.  Time is a big math concept motivator, as is money.  Body<br/>
&gt; parts- two of some ten of some, why?  Why are bodies mostly (but not<br/>
&gt; totally) symmetrical?  Why do some things fit together, others<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t?  Why do some stacks of things balance, others don&#39;t?  Why is<br/>
&gt; it that if you want to build a lego thing that is twice as tall and<br/>
&gt; twice as wide and twice as long as the one you have, it takes 8<br/>
&gt; times as many blocks?  Why is it that two glasses can be different<br/>
&gt; heights, but hold the same amount?  Why isn&#39;t a taller one always<br/>
&gt; &quot;bigger&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i love your examples!  My son has been a big lego fan since his <br/>
first 6 piece set at age 7 months.  he also loves his hotwheels where he <br/>
loves to experiment with velocity and what variables will change the <br/>
velocity of them - adding a steeper slope in the track, curves, etc. <br/>
and even if the slope is the same, why do some cars go faster than <br/>
others?  what makes his bus which certainly is not very aerodynamic, <br/>
go faster than 90% of his cars and trucks?  h-m-m-m....  i haven&#39;t <br/>
even figured that one out yet either but i&#39;m sure he will figure it <br/>
out before me one of these days.<br/>

the dots on top and underneath?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So, we did a little thing with pattern blocks and stuffed animals:  &quot;If each <br/>
of these 3 stuffed animals get 4 pattern blocks, then that&#39;s 12 blocks <br/>
altogether&quot; - and, of course, in reverse for division. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a curious one, though.  After we watched Camelot, (2 years later), we <br/>
spent days discussing why King Arthur had to let Guinevere die.  She still <br/>
thought it was dumb &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been gone a couple days (dh is only home on weekends, sigh)  But,<br/>
wanted to point out that I am not trying to criticize anyone because they<br/>
can&#39;t put math sentences on paper.  My thinking is that we need to know how<br/>
to communicate math problems on paper just as we do the English language.<br/>
If we work with others that need to know how we arrived at our math answers<br/>
and cannot communicate it in writing we could be somewhat hindered could we<br/>
not?<br/>
