<div id="ygrps-yiv-297122290">David, I would love to see this.  Don&#39;t worry too much about cluttering<br/>
the list, esp if it applies to unschooling!  I skip long passages if they<br/>
don&#39;t interest me right now.  Or e-mail to me personally.  I saw your<br/>
book in the GWS catalog and it is on my reading list now.<br/>
We have an old piano and two banjos (Would like to sell one, but that&#39;s<br/>
another matter).  I played violin as a kid.  Would also like to share<br/>
singing with my kids.  All skills I&#39;m sorely lacking in (in my school,<br/>
kids who played an instrument didn&#39;t get singing class anymore!)  We&#39;ve<br/>
tried some local classes, but they&#39;re expensive or too schoolish or<br/>
offered to such narrow age groups that they just don&#39;t work for me right<br/>
now.<br/>

accept Word attachments -- don&#39;t want to clutter up the list.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-78061788">I&#39;ll be happy to send it to you personally.  I know I don&#39;t like to<br/>
receive attachments that I didn&#39;t request, especially as they can<br/>
contain viruses, and I think it&#39;s only good computer courtesy to offer,<br/>
but not to send en-masse.<br/>
