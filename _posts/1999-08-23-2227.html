&gt;Now, there&#39;s a thought -- I wonder, have any of you unschooled or are any of <br/>
&gt;you unschooling any children who are not your own?  How did it come about?  <br/>
&gt;Would you do it again?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My niece was here for the summer (about 6 weeks of it) and although she<br/>
loved school for the first 8 years, she is really beginning to hate it.<br/>
She is still a straight A, honor-roll student, as she always has been.  But<br/>
she feels the pressure of the stress of school, the expectations placed on<br/>
her because she is a high achiever, and she does not feel that school is<br/>
meeting her emotional or educational needs.  She lives in a very depressed<br/>
area (one of the worst in the country) and as she gets older she finds<br/>
there are less opportunites for her in the IS (Institutionalized Schooling)<br/>
system.  <br/>
<br/>
When she was here I gave her lots of info and we had a lot of discussions<br/>
about Homeschooling, and Unschooling in particular. She was VERY<br/>
interested, but I do not think that either of her parents is in a place<br/>
(financially or emotionally) to be able to let her Unschool.  We are still<br/>
talking (over phone and corespondence) about her options and I am sending<br/>
along any kind of info for her Mom, in case she makes a decision in my<br/>
niece&#39;s favor for Unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
She is 13, and we talked about how I took myself out of school at 14<br/>
because it was not serving my needs and was Unschooling myself to a great<br/>
degree.  I don&#39;t know if she would be assertive enough to do that, nor<br/>
would I want to cause a problem in her house, but I think it lets her see<br/>
her education in another light (ie: the it is for HER and not to please her<br/>
parents or teachers or for Grandma&#39;s grade money in the summer or<br/>
whatever.)  She is a great kid, and she pushes herself very hard.  I don&#39;t<br/>
see the need for any outside pressures on her and I feel for her being so<br/>
pressed to the grindstone.  I don&#39;t think she has really had much of a<br/>
childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to answer your question.  Although she was not here all that long<br/>
this summer, I think it was long enough to make a difference for her.  I<br/>
was afraid she might have been bored, as most of our days were spent<br/>
hanging around the house while I took care of the boys and she read,<br/>
watched t.v., worked on complex art coloring books I have, made some beaded<br/>
jewelry or talked with me.  We went to the zoo a couple of times and once<br/>
to the little amusement park in town, and went shopping, made a stop at the<br/>
used bookstore to trade some books, and just did every day stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
My fears of her being bored or disappointed were dispelled a couple of<br/>
weeks after she went back to my parents&#39; house to finish her vacation.  I<br/>
spoke with her on the phone, and was asking her how she was doing etc.  She<br/>
was having a good time visiting with her 15 year old cousin from the East<br/>
coast who was also at Grandma&#39;s house for a visit.  She said that they had<br/>
talked (she and her cousin) and had decided that they were BOTH coming here<br/>
next summer, but that they were going to stay the WHOLE summer this time!!<br/>
Fine with me!  I will be happy to spend time with them both.  They are<br/>
growing into really interesting and beautiful young women (inside and out.)<br/>

finished by then, so we&#39;ll have plenty of extra room!<br/>
