&quot;On candy and other limits&quot; <br/>

[Joyce (indented) responding to unnamed skeptic (in  boldface):]  <br/>
I just have to add my two cents prefacing my comments by declaring my bias  <br/>
as a person who leans toward obsessive complusive ie &quot;addictive&quot; behavior.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think decisions made in response to obsessive compulsive  behavior <br/>
are a good model to offer to others to make sound decisions  from.<br/>
I do limit my kids&#39; sugar consumption for multiple reasons,  not the least of <br/>
which is a family history of diabetes/ late onset which is  directly related <br/>
to over intake of refined carbohydrates and insulin  resistence....  <br/>
I see a number of flaws in your reasoning. I suspect that you  don&#39;t want <br/>
them pointed out and just want it known that you don&#39;t agree with  what&#39;s being <br/>
said because you have reasons that make sense to you.  <br/>
But, this is a discussion list and the purpose of the list is to hold ideas  <br/>
up to examination and to help people make rational decisions. If anyone  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want their ideas examined, its best not to post them.  <br/>
Here&#39;s what I see:  <br/>
If your kids are overweight then you&#39;re offering general advice based on a  <br/>
nongeneral situation. (There *are* other options besides control even for  <br/>
special circumstances.)  <br/>
If your kids are not overweight, then you are imposing a solution to a  <br/>
problem that you only fear may exist in the future.  <br/>
If by late onset diabetes you mean type 2, the connection isn&#39;t directly to  <br/>
sugar but to being overweight. The problem is taking in too many calories and  <br/>
not expending enough and becoming overweight. Being overweight doesn&#39;t cause  <br/>
type 2 diabetes, e.g. all overweight people become diabetic, but being  <br/>
overweight seems to be a factor.<br/>
My kids recognize that when  they do eat a ton of sugar (say after a birthday <br/>
party or what have you) they  feel physically ill and grumpy... My seven year <br/>
old o naturally doesn&#39;t care for  refined sugar, he will choose an apple over <br/>
birthday cake every time. Our family  candy rule is three pieces per day <br/>
after a healthy meal... (and they are welcome  to throw away and try again if they <br/>
hate something, so it&#39;s actually  three...).  <br/>
If they aren&#39;t drawn to sugar, then why limit  it?<br/>
They are nine and seven and they have no problem with  limits.on TV, movies, <br/>
computer time, candy consumption, etc.  <br/>
If by &quot;no problem&quot; you mean they don&#39;t complain, depending on  personality <br/>
and family atmosphere, some kids will learn that complaining isn&#39;t  worth the <br/>
effort.  <br/>
If by &quot;no problem&quot; you mean that without limits they choose the way you  <br/>
would choose for them, then why have limits?  <br/>
(I&#39;d be concerned, though, if my daughter were making the same decisions I  <br/>
would. It would suggest to me that she was memorizing rules rather than  <br/>
learning what&#39;s right for her by experimentation. We try to help people see  that <br/>
children will choose what&#39;s right for *them*, though, not choose what  we&#39;d <br/>
choose for them. They *will* choose differently. But they won&#39;t eat  nothing but <br/>
sugar and fat, and won&#39;t do nothing but watch TV and play video  games.)  <br/>
Some people, such as those who are naturally drawn to rules, who live under  <br/>
limitations accept the rules and stick to them. They live in fear and the  <br/>
rules are like talismans that will keep the boogeyman away. What happens when  <br/>
they are faced with new situations that they don&#39;t have rules in place for?  <br/>
People often extrapolate from the nonsense and extend the rules. But rational  <br/>
thought would reveal shoddy foundations for decision making.  <br/>
If the reasons behind rules make sense, then there isn&#39;t a reason to make a  <br/>
rule. But people who follow rules, aren&#39;t learning how to make decisions. They <br/>
 are only learning to follow someone else&#39;s rules.  <br/>
If the reasons behind rules are nonsense, then people memorize nonsense and  <br/>
use that as a foundation for decision making.  <br/>
If your kids have memorized that too much sugar will cause diabetes so it&#39;s  <br/>
good to avoid sugar, they&#39;ve memorized nonsense and are basing decisions on  <br/>
nonsense.  <br/>
If they recognize that sugar will make them feel yucky, then, without  rules, <br/>
they are free to decide each time if the future yucky feeling is worth  it or <br/>
not. They&#39;ll be listening to their bodies, not a rule they&#39;ve memorized.   <br/>
<br/>
They are nine and seven and they have no problem with  limits on TV, movies, <br/>
computer time, candy consumption, etc.  <br/>
If they are memorizing rules that say any time beyond x spent on  TV, movies, <br/>
computer is damaging, then they&#39;re memorizing your responses to  your fears <br/>
not listening to their bodies or coming to rational decisions  through trial <br/>
and error about what&#39;s right for their unique selves.  <br/>
