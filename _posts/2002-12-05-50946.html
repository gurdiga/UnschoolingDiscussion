 </span></blockquote>Since this is an unschooling list the suggestions you&#39;re likely to get are<br/>
on the order of learning to appreciate the opportunities that life provides<br/>
for writing. And to learn to see that writing, like speaking, are methods<br/>
people use when they have ideas in their heads they feel the need to express<br/>
to others -- or sometimes to themselves. If there is no need to express,<br/>
then there isn&#39;t much need to write or speak.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep. I see that in my five kids. The ones who are always <br/>
communicating or expressing themselves in one way or another - <br/>
talking, singing, drawing, writing -  are the ones who&#39;ve taken to <br/>
writing at great length, whether writing notes, filling out forms, <br/>
making lists, writing letters, writing in journals, or, like one son, <br/>
constantly writing stories. A couple of others, who are less <br/>
interested in communicating, and more interested in doing things with <br/>
their hands (they&#39;re both really into mechanics, classic car <br/>
restoring, and construction of various types), only occasionally <br/>
bother to write anything. I know they can, they just prefer not to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576803425">I have been mostly a lurker here, but I just HAVE to jump in on this one.<br/>
&lt;G&gt; To the mother of Lars- he&#39;s an excellent writer! I thought he shared<br/>
his thoughts very well! So he can&#39;t spell- big deal- there are lot&#39;s of<br/>
&quot;educated&quot; adults who can&#39;t either. That&#39;s what dictionary&#39;s are for, and<br/>
why every word processor comes with a spell-checker.Spelling is something<br/>
that comes natural to some and not others, and quite frankly phonetic<br/>
spelling is often more logical! If he needs to write something in life,<br/>
like a job resume, or letter, or whatever that requires correct spelling-<br/>
he can use those resources.&quot;Writing &quot; is about saying what you want to<br/>
say, communicating your thoughts to others, NOT about spelling. In other<br/>
words, don&#39;t stress it &lt;G&gt;<br/>
