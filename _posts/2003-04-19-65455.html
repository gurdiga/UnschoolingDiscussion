 </span></blockquote>Yes, I think you&#39;re right. Below is something someone posted to our local <br/>
list which addresses this issue. BTW, when I got up this morning and signed <br/>
on, I had Digest #3330 waiting for me, which means I missed 9 others!<br/>

Why does list mail come out of order or hours/days late or never appear at<br/>
all? Why do my AOL members not get all the list mail or digests? Why does it<br/>
take hours or days for list mail to get to my Hotmail or Yahoo email box<br/>
...?<br/>
<br/>
Because AOL, MSN, Yahoo email, Hotmail, Earthlink, et al, are large email<br/>
providers. They get literally tons of email and they have to watch their<br/>
servers carefully because they can get overloaded. So they prioritize. They<br/>
give private email priority over group or list mail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yahoogroups is the largest email list provider (pay or free) and they send<br/>
out literally tons of mail. Large chunks of that mail go to the largest<br/>
email providers like AOL, MSN, Yahoo email, Hotmail, Earthlink, etc. Since<br/>
those large email providers give priority to private email, when their<br/>
servers are busy, they will refuse connections with Yahoogroups.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, Yahoogroups tries to connect to them but their incoming mail<br/>
servers say no, try again later. So Yahoogroups holds the mail and waits,<br/>
tries again later until the email provider (AOL, MSN, Yahoo email, etc) will<br/>
accept the connection and receive the mail from Yahoogroups.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s why things come late and out of order. In addition, AOL has<br/>
admitted that they trash some email from Yahoogroups when their servers are<br/>
busy, so some Yahoogroups mail is lost and never delivered to AOL members.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This also applies to the confirmations sent by Yahoogroups to confirm your<br/>
email address or your subscription or unsubscription requests as well as<br/>
notices to listowners and moderators about pending posts or members.<br/>
Sometimes these confirmations and notifications take hours or days to get to<br/>
you or never show up at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to check things out, you can review the full headers of<br/>
delayed messages. The Received: lines at the top of the headers are the most<br/>
recent, the top one will be when your ISP or mail provider received it from<br/>
Yahoogroups. The Received: lines before that one are transfers between<br/>
internal Yahoogroups servers. So look at the time on the topmost Received<br/>
line and compare it to the time on the Received line just below that. Adjust<br/>
for time differences if necessary and if there&#39;s a big gap, it means<br/>
Yahoogroups was trying to contact your ISP or mail provider and couldn&#39;t get<br/>
thru, so they waited and tried again and again until they got thru.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the case of AOL, it&#39;s also possible there&#39;s a delay after AOL received it<br/>
and before they delivered it to the AOLer&#39;s mail box as AOL has admitted<br/>
that they do sometimes accept mail from Yahoogroups and then hold it<br/>
somewhere in their system until their servers are not so busy and then<br/>
deliver it to the AOL member&#39;s mail box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes an ISP or mail provider isn&#39;t reachable after hours or days or<br/>
trying to send mail and then Yahoogroups considers it a soft bounce. Some<br/>
Yahoogroups list owners that use Yahoo email have reported seeing a message<br/>
in their bounce history (go to My Preferences and click on Bounce History)<br/>
that says &quot;Yahoo mail servers unreachable for too long&quot;. This means<br/>
Yahoogroups tried to send mail to them for a long period and finally gave<br/>
up. This may happen with any of the large ISPs or mail providers if they<br/>
experience temporary server problems and have to severely curtail their<br/>
incoming mail for a period of time until the servers are fixed and list mail<br/>
like Yahoogroups is always the first thing they restrict.   <br/>
