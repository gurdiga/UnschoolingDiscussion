<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849440801">On the digest I just received, only about three sentences of a post of mine showed up. I assume that&#39;s true for the rest of the digests, but if not, I apologize in advance for re-posting this:<br/>
<br/>
I used todcorresponde with a woman from the Wash., D.C. area names Jean who runs a homeschool theater group there. We were about to exchange tapes of each other&#39;s homeschool theater productions when I had big computer problems and lost<br/>
her address.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you heard of such a person? I seem to remember she got into some<br/>
disputes with people who thought she was excluding kids who didn&#39;t<br/>
homeschool--I think she was even mentioned in Newsweek at one time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any tips....<br/>
<br/>
