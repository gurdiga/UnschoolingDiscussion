<div id="ygrps-yiv-274164984">&lt;&lt;This might be a good segue, though, into a discussion of what we DO<br/>
want for <br/>
our kids? What IS the goal of our family&#39;s unschooling life - in terms of<br/>
<br/>
what we hope our kids will get out of it?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so glad you asked!  My main goal in unschooling is to protect my<br/>
children&#39;s passion for learning.  Mine died for a period while being<br/>
schooled and it awakened slowly when I began college.  I never finished<br/>
college (no degree) but I gave myself the permission to stay a student<br/>
for the rest of my life.<br/>
<br/>
I want my children to be curious and in charge of their learning for<br/>
their entire lives.  I want them to see the world as unlimited and<br/>
friendly rather than punitive and laborious.<br/>
