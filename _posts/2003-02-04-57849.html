&lt;&lt; I actually don&#39;t think I am too surprised that boys do better as <br/>
unschoolers as opposed to &quot;school at home&quot; because studies (I don&#39;t have any <br/>
specifics) show that schools are set up for girls to succeed in their general <br/>
learning styles and not boys. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, perhaps with the academics. But girls actually learn better when in <br/>
groups, and facing each other. NOT the way they have desks set up in school.<br/>
Many studies have found that girls do better talking things over in group <br/>
situations and schools are definitely not set up for them.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
