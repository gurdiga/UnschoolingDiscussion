&gt;   Being in front of a screen IS  time together for us. Granted my kids are <br/>
&gt; younger but some of the best moments are when we&#39;re curled up with each other, <br/>
&gt; talking about the movie we&#39;re watching or laughing at a show.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       Eight-year-old DS loves sound. Not only will he try to sing ALL the <br/>
vocal parts instead of picking just one, but he also uses his voice to imitate <br/>
all the instruments and sound effects from his favorite songs, movies and <br/>
shows. Hearing him do the theme to Star Wars or Indiana Jones or Duck Dodgers is <br/>
quite an experience!<br/>
<br/>
       Duck Dodgers is based on Daffy Duck, which led DS  to golden-oldie <br/>
LooneyTunes, so for a couple of months now, he&#39;s been falling asleep to a CD with <br/>
classical cartoon tracks such as What&#39;s Opera Doc? -- be vewwy quiet, I&#39;m <br/>
hunting wabbit -- and the Bugs and Elmer Fudd spoof on the Barber of Seville <br/>
(Figaro, Figaro, Feeeee-garo!)<br/>
<br/>
       Because he&#39;s been so excited about this of late, we&#39;ve been looking <br/>
for classic LooneyTunes on DVD. Friday we went out to a book and music shop near <br/>
the university here, in a terrible rainstorm, because the day before his <br/>
voice coach had suggested it to him as a possible source, after they&#39;d finished <br/>
singing Animaniac songs together. <br/>
<br/>
       BTW, it seems the Animaniacs also are tv cartoons, from Steven <br/>
Speilberg, but neither I nor DS had ever heard of them. Odd, with all the screen time <br/>
we enjoy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       Anyway, we struck gold literally, found a four-disc set, the <br/>
quintessential Golden LooneyTunes Collection.<br/>
<br/>
       And we watched it together, all of Friday night and all day Saturday, <br/>
practically without breaks. Laughing our heads off and talking about <br/>
everything under the sun. It was deeply satisfying. :)  JJ<br/>

There are two singalong videos of Animaniacs.  The Nations of the World and <br/>
all the capitals of the U.S. States are two of my kids&#39; favorites.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353070094">Animaniacs!  Great cartoon.  I watched it every day<br/>
before I went to work, when I was preggie with Alex. <br/>
So, that makes it about 10 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
They have it on Amazon.com, on VHS, but not DVD. ( So<br/>
I can&#39;t get it from Netflix, too bad)<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t play it on any channel, I&#39;ve seen. ;-( <br/>
<br/>
They have Pinky and the Brain on VHS too. ( They were<br/>
on Animaniacs)  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What are we going to do tonite, Brain?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Try to take over the WORLD!&quot;  <br/>

I think I&#39;ll look for that, I didn&#39;t find it in my<br/>

Just to clarify &lt;bg&gt; In the State Capitols song, they mistakenly say the <br/>
capitol of South Dakota (as it&#39;s spelled and intended): Pierre (pee-air); however, <br/>
the locals say it: peer.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Old people in Pueblo, Colorado pronounce it PEE eb lo too, but they&#39;re goofy.<br/>
(And it&#39;s not the capital.)<br/>
<br/>
And people from Wisconsin say &quot;Wisconsin&quot; funny, but there are so few of them <br/>
it hardly matters to the millions of people who say it the way it looks like <br/>
it should sound because WE LEARNED PHONETICS!!  Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
I was coached in how to pronounce it the local way by some poor woman who <br/>
grew up there.  It was kinda like this.   (I have to clear my throat and swallow <br/>
first.)<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Peer, South Dakota&quot; huh?  I&#39;ll have to remember that.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Or not.<br/>
<br/>
In the days before Radio and TELEvision, when people were more <br/>
phonics-disabled (meaning limited to learning phonetically at times) many people said <br/>
&quot;Albukirk&quot; instead of Albuquerque, but then they heard the few people who&#39;d actually <br/>
been there say it on TV, I guess, and it quit happening.<br/>
<br/>
Bugs Bunny could always say it correctly, but he&#39;d been here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-542227992">LOL  I didn&#39;t know other people said it differently.  Being neighbors <br/>
of &quot;wi SKAAN sun&quot; I thought that the pronunciation was that way for <br/>
everyone.  LOL<br/>
