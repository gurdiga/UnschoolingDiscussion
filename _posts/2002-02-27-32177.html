<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453059704">Dar, what an interesting subject you have researched.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
Jester was giving an explanation of ebonics or a separate language, but<br/>
was saying we do end up pronouncing things like what is modeled for us,<br/>
mostly by our parents.  He did demonstrate how foreigners do have trouble<br/>
pronouncing sounds the same as the natural citizens.  And he said the<br/>
slaves were surrounded by slaves, not white people, for examples of how<br/>
to speak.  (His examples were very convincing). He did his best to get<br/>
white choirs to sing like they were black, and to establish rapport with<br/>
what was predominantly white middle class audiences.  He would have the<br/>
lighting people put the lights on the audience and dim the light on stage<br/>
saying, &quot;You are the real show, this is about you.&quot;  I think he was<br/>
helping them to not be so afraid of our differences.  Like I said, my<br/>
cousins would be talking with their gang in their chicano accent, then<br/>
turn and talk to me in plain English.  They didn&#39;t talk that way because<br/>
they didn&#39;t know how to talk better, but to communicate with their pals. <br/>
I agree there is no need to think one way is better, especially when we<br/>
see why people talk the way they do. The kids I went to school with could<br/>
speak English well, but around their friends or family spoke with their<br/>
own unique sounds. Of course, I also knew a lot of them who felt it was<br/>
degrading to talk &quot;ebonics&quot; and would even tell their friends, &quot;Speak<br/>
English when you talk to me!&quot;  Because they felt it made them sound<br/>
ignorant.  I knew a blonde haired, blue eyed girl who lived in a black<br/>
neighborhood and her step dad was black, and she was totally accepted<br/>
among her black peers, many of whom were prejudiced of whites, I think<br/>
partly because if you heard only her voice you would not know she was<br/>
white.  I used to envy her because she always got asked to dance at the<br/>
school dances.  I lived in Arkansas for a time and they have their own<br/>
idioms and speech sounds, so that I often misunderstood what people were<br/>
saying to me and they misunderstood me.  I found myself constantly<br/>
paraphrasing to make sure I understood them.   I read a local historian&#39;s<br/>
view that their accents came originally from England, believe it or not. <br/>
My brother in law is embarrassed by his &quot;hillbilly&quot; talk so he&#39;s rather<br/>
taciturn.  I find their way of talking to be charming.  I met a man there<br/>
whose parents have very heavy Arkansas accents, yet he sounds like he&#39;s<br/>
from California.  He learned how to talk from watching the news and<br/>
mimicking the sounds they made.  Why, because he felt ashamed of his<br/>
accent.  Doctors and lawyers have a way of talking among their peers that<br/>
everyone in the profession understands, but confuses those outside.  A<br/>
smart professional will talk in a simple form to the public and use<br/>
professional jargon among peers.  I guess speech is not just about<br/>
getting our point across to one another and hearing one another, but is<br/>
also about establishing our common identity with one another.<br/>
