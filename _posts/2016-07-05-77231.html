<p>I hope it&#39;s okay to mine for data in this group - if not, feel free not to approve the message, Sandra.<br>
<br>
I wanted to put together some data on what age unschooled children learn to read. Perhaps a bell curve, if I get enough data (and if indeed it turns out to follow a normal distribution!). For my own interest, and to share in groups when the inevitable reading
 questions come up. If it&#39;s interesting enough, maybe Sandra will share it on her website.<br>
<br>
I think it&#39;s going to work best if the data only comes from kids who were always unschooled, otherwise there could be some bias? Maybe pre-school or Kinder wouldn&#39;t matter so much, but not any kids who went to school from grade 1 onwards?<br>
<br>
So - all I need is what age your unschooled child/ren learnt to read - properly read - read anything they wanted, not awkwardly or sounding out.<br>
<br>
My own data - age 8.75<br>
<br>
Thanks! I&#39;ll bring the results back when I get them!<br>

<p>I hope it&#39;s okay to mine for data in this group - if not, feel free not to approve the message, Sandra.<br>
<br>
I wanted to put together some data on what age unschooled children learn to read. Perhaps a bell curve, if I get enough data (and if indeed it turns out to follow a normal distribution!). For my own interest, and to share in groups when the inevitable reading
 questions come up. If it&#39;s interesting enough, maybe Sandra will share it on her website.<br>
<br>
I think it&#39;s going to work best if the data only comes from kids who were always unschooled, otherwise there could be some bias? Maybe pre-school or Kinder wouldn&#39;t matter so much, but not any kids who went to school from grade 1 onwards?<br>
<br>
So - all I need is what age your unschooled child/ren learnt to read - properly read - read anything they wanted, not awkwardly or sounding out.<br>
<br>
My own data - age 8.75<br>
<br>
Thanks! I&#39;ll bring the results back when I get them!<br>

<div>Now Jo what do you call learn to read? </div>
<div>In schools kids are said to be learning at 5 or 6 but they really have a set or words and read only books with those words.</div>
<div>Sometimes they can read and not understand much if at all of what they are reading .</div>
<div>I can read Korean Hangul but cannot understand most of it.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Or are you taking kids that can read almost anything and understand all they are reading? </div>

Do you want to clarify so you sort “beginning to decode” from fluent reading?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems lots of unschooled kids do go from confusion to fluency pretty quickly!<br/>
Kids at school might too, but it’s buried under all that confusing data about reading readiness and parcipation and phonics and writing and…  it’s hard for it to show in a group of +/- twenty kids.  But one kid home picking something up and reading it is glaring and exciting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898947603"><p dir="ltr">My oldest was &quot;taught by me&quot; (we did homeschool lessons as I thought I was seeing cues she was ready) at 4 - then she went to preschool and the teachers told me they would have her read to the other kids there.  So, by school standards she was reading - and at home she would read dinosaur encyclopedias and such, and could apparently comprehend the information, or at the least she was always reciting it to anyone that would listen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But when I kept her home for good, she took some time off reading completely, while we both de-schooled.  I recall her not appearing to enjoy it, or feeling overwhelmed by me suggesting reading materials so I backed off for a year or so.  Around 6 she was reading for joy again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her sister has always unschooled, and I believe I noticed she was reading *and* comprehending anything easily and fluently at about 8.5 or so.</p></div>

One thing that pops to mind is when I tell people about the successes I read of here they often point to confirmation bias - only those for whom things go well stick around so how do we know it can really work?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101009117"><div dir="ltr"><div><div>My son began reading words, phrases, and short sentences at about 3 years old--posters at the library, packages at the market, signs while driving. At five he sat down one day and read, aloud, from start to finish, and with remarkable inflection, a three chapter book. At 9 yrs old he can read as well as many adults I know, though his understanding of context is more limited. He&#39;s always been interested in systems, organization and how things work. As a toddler he loved those Leap Frog videos, but then got really angry when he discovered the &#39;rules&#39; they teach have so many, many exceptions.<br><br>My daughter, his twin sister, was between 7 and 8 when she began reading on her own. She still asks for assistance figuring out new words. It&#39;s Interesting to me that she loves to write (as in put words on paper) and that my son will write music notes, but hates writing words--even his own name. My daughter also used to write in a beautifully pictorial way--her name would be a spiral of letters with little images sprinkled in-between. She was quite adamant that writing need not be left to right and was so excited to find manga graphic novels at the library as proof! She&#39;s since adopted a more conventional approach when what she&#39;s writing needs to be read, but still includes words, letters and symbols in her drawings. <br><br></div><div>Tori<br></div><div>mama to Tolinka &amp; Obi, both 9 yrs old<br></div><br></div><br></div></div>

<br/>
The range of unschooling discussions is pretty broad, and the data set might not be as solid (even if it’s larger) as if it comes from people whose philosophy is known to Jo.<br/>
<br/>
There was an online poll done by Peter Grey, about reading, a couple of years ago. ;-)<br/>
