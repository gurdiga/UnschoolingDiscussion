<div id="ygrps-yiv-831137195">I&#39;ve been fixing up this mixture in mason jars all month to give away  as <br/>
xmas presents.  I make it in bulk, sometimes using 2 whole large  boxes of <br/>
oatmeal, sometimes fudging on the amount of nuts (I used walnuts, too)  and the <br/>
powdered milk.  Oh, and I used raisins instead of dried fruit bits,  because I&#39;m <br/>
not in a food co-op.  The recipe as is wasn&#39;t sweet enough  for Will, so if I <br/>
was giving it to people who&#39;s kids are known to be picky, I  put extra sugar in <br/>
it so they wouldn&#39;t be turned off on first taste.  It&#39;s  very rich and keeps <br/>
me full well until lunch and keeps well in a sealed  container.<br/>
 <br/>
BREAKFAST OATMEAL SURPRISE<br/>
2 cups quick-cooking oatmeal, uncooked        Combine all ingredients in a <br/>
heavy duty <br/>
1/2 cup dried fruit  bits                                   ziploc  bag.  To <br/>
serve, pour boiling water<br/>
1/3 cup chopped  pecans                                over desired amonut of <br/>
oatmeal mixture, <br/>
1/4 cup brown  sugar                                       barely covering <br/>
mixture.  Stir and let <br/>
1/2 tsp ground  cinnamon                                 stand 2 minutes.<br/>
1/2 cup instant nonfat dry milk powder<br/>

<br/>
It reminds me of 1976 when I went to Kodiak for the summer to work in the canneries (and stayed 9 years, but that is another story...)  One of my friends would put dry cereal and powdered milk in a Tupperware bowl with a lid and add water to it at lunch time.<br/>
<br/>
I love my oatmeal with dried fruit and nuts too.<br/>

I can&#39;t seem to find where it gives the proportions of mix and water <br/>
when cooking it to eat. Is it the same ratio as regular oatmeal (1 <br/>
scoop oats 2 scoops water)? I&#39;d probably use the pecans, as DH is <br/>
allergic to walnuts (okay he says he isn&#39;t but when he eats them his <br/>
mouth and throat get itchy...)<br/>

Sorry about that.  It came out okay on mine.  <br/>
 <br/>
You just put in the amount of hot water you like, enough to barely cover,  <br/>
usually.  More or less.  The longer it sits the thicker it  gets.  I always <br/>
think I&#39;ve poured too much water, but it thickens  right up.  I usually put the <br/>
tea kettle on the stove, then boot up my  computer, then pour the water over the <br/>
tea in the mug and the oatmeal in the  bowl.  Then I eat the oatmeal while <br/>
the tea is brewing  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll retype it better:<br/>
 <br/>
2 cups quick-cooking oatmeal, uncooked<br/>
1/2 cup dried fruit bits (or raisins)<br/>
1/3 cup chopped pecans or walnuts<br/>
1/4 cup brown sugar<br/>
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon<br/>
1/2 cup instant nonfat dry milk powder<br/>
 <br/>
Combine all ingredients in a heavy duty ziploc bag.  To serve, pour  boiling <br/>
water over desired amount of oatmeal mixture, barely covering  mixture.  Stir <br/>
and let stand 2 minutes.<br/>
