Natural learning doesn&#39;t know what the laws are.   Children learn the way <br/>
they would learn if schools had never been considered by anyone in the history of <br/>
the world.   They learn by adding to what they already know.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s exactly and simply how learning works:    one adds to what he knows.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No problem by me - there&#39;s probably a list somewhere for FL. I&#39;m up <br/>
here in reg free CT. My main point was not so much to discuss the <br/>
ins and outs of FL law as to point out a flaw in the either/or <br/>
logic - even in FL it&#39;s not simply either test OR portfolio to <br/>
comply with the law.<br/>
