&lt;&lt;  Now it&#39;s just a matter of course, and I have learned that the &quot;rough <br/>
housing&quot; seems to serve a real need between the kids and their dad.  I hope <br/>
that&#39;s how the sword play evolves, too.   Debi &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read in a book once (many years ago, heaven knows what the name was) about <br/>
the importance of both male and female figures in a child&#39;s life.<br/>
Father&#39;s tend to be physical, wrestling and tickling a lot. While mothers <br/>
tend to the hugging, story reading stuff. Not that we don&#39;t do both, but it <br/>
seems that Father&#39;s like the kind of play that excites their children. I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed that my boys are very physical whether it&#39;s in a happy way or an <br/>
angry way. They just are.<br/>
More physical than my daughter, although I&#39;m sure there are plenty of <br/>
exceptions. Both types of play (the calm and the excitable) are really <br/>
important to a child&#39;s development. They get something good from both. So <br/>
although the tickly, wrestly stuff may not be your personality preferance, it <br/>
seems to be good for kids (assuming they are voluntarily participating of <br/>
course!!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93072807">Oh! And I forgot to mention that both my 9 and 12 y.o. boys have real weapons <br/>
too. They saw daggers at the SCA event we&#39;ve been to twice and HAD to have <br/>
them. Trevor had three daggers (or is it two? I think he sold one) and Jared <br/>
has two. They are deadly weapons, very cool looking and on very high shelves <br/>
to keep them from the babsy boy.<br/>
They know that I am serious about the safety issue of having weapons in a <br/>
home with a little person, and they&#39;ve done fine so far.<br/>
They don&#39;t even take them out except to show them off. They&#39;ve never done <br/>
anything dangerous with them. And they have gotten immense enjoyment from <br/>
these items.<br/>
During the SCA events they can cut up their meat with a really cool, very <br/>
period weapon. fun!<br/>

&lt;&lt;   I thought I had made all my decisions in these areas long before I ever <br/>
had children,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
Well Debi,  I guess you could say that wouldn&#39;t be very unschoolish. If we <br/>
make decisions about our children before they&#39;re born, we aren&#39;t able to get <br/>
their point of view first eh?<br/>
I certainly had made decisions about sending my kids to school and such <br/>
before they were born. Thank goodness I have actual experience now, not just <br/>
some vague ideas about how to be a parent before they even existed.<br/>
Our children are our guides, just as we are theirs.  Listening to their <br/>
views, their needs and their desires is the ultimately important thing in <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
You can&#39;t do that if you&#39;ve already made up your mind before the child is <br/>
even there.<br/>
I think being open to many possibilities is a key to unschooling success. <br/>
Often that means changing our minds on things we thought we knew.  Just keep <br/>
listening to them, they know what they need.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2302<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son knows the difference between playing and fighting, and I trust that he<br/>
&gt;has enough respect for others&#39; life and liberty that he would not use a gun to<br/>
&gt; interfere with those things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly!  In looking at various web pages in support of video games, I came<br/>
across this page (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/cms/games/current.html)">http://web.mit.edu/cms/games/current.html)</a> about the<br/>
effects of video games on children.  It&#39;s not my intention to hijack this<br/>
discussion and turn it into one about video games but this quote in<br/>
particular speaks about all kinds of play:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If we don&#39;t distinguish between aggressive play and aggressive behavior, we<br/>
lose the whole value of play - which is to do things in fantasy that you<br/>
don&#39;t actually have to carry out in reality.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is part of a much longer transcript of a talk given by Geoffrey<br/>
Goldstein at MIT entitled &quot;Computer and video games come of age, a national<br/>
conference to explore the current state of an emerging entertainment<br/>
medium,&quot; <br/>

OH!<br/>
REAL daggers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought you were writting about &quot;boffer-daggers&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s  another kinda-fun toy.  Just foam, no PVC, enough tape to make it <br/>
rigid.  They can use boffer and dagger, or just have a &quot;knife fight,&quot; and for <br/>
boys who want more physical activity it can be pretty strenuous.  <br/>
<br/>
In all of this, remind them to be chivalrous and courteous and not aim for <br/>
faces, heads, groins.<br/>

been tremendous fun.  We bought him a pair of over-large inflatable swords <br/>
and shields (made of the kind of durable material you might find in an air <br/>
mattress).  He could really go to town with those, and the laughing never <br/>
stopped!  I &quot;think&quot; Hearthsong sells them, but I could be all wrong.<br/>

Maybe I&#39;m wrong, I know you&#39;re a Taoist Mary, but aren&#39;t you a pacifist?  I <br/>
am positive you are a peaceloving individual, but maybe I stated it wrong <br/>
when I used the term pacifist. Sorry if I used the wrong label (I hate labels <br/>
sometimes!!:)<br/>
Anyway, I thought it might be helpful for her to hear how another Mom with <br/>
similar views would handle weaponry fascination.<br/>

have no problem with sweet, positive or nurturing type labels.<br/>
