<div id="ygrps-yiv-616361550">Please pardon the cross-duplication, but I wanted to tell those of you going to <br/>
conferences (Learnapalooza in Kansas City at the end of May or Live and Learn in <br/>
Boston at the end of August) about a possible purchase.  Even if you&#39;re not going to <br/>
conferences, you may be interested in this for other possible vacation spots.<br/>
<br/>
I am IN NO WAY affiliated with the company that produces the Entertainment books <br/>
and I stand to gain nothing by this endorsement.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I purchased Entertainment books (offer a large selection of 2-for-1 <br/>
discount coupons) for Kansas City and Boston recently.  They are normally around <br/>
$30-$40.  They are currently $9.99, plus $5 for each book for shipping.  We plan on <br/>
spending some time in KC and Boston after the conferences.  I just received them <br/>
yesterday and know that we will MORE than make up the $15 price for each, just in <br/>
pizza and fast food coupons, let alone museum discounts.  The coupons expire on <br/>
Nov. 1, 2004.<br/>
<br/>
You can go to www.entertainment.com and look at the coupons each book offers.  <br/>
You can purchase for other cities there, too.  Right now, all of the books for any city <br/>
are $9.99.  <br/>
<br/>
We plan on using whatever coupons we can while in the cities, then passing the <br/>
books on to someone there, or perhaps leave them in the hotel lobby.<br/>
