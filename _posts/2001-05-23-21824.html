<div id="ygrps-yiv-447160891">Hi <br/>
I dont post often, and it seems the only time I do is when I have a problem. <br/>
Sorry. I do read almost every post though. I have a hard time to put my <br/>
thoughts into words so I like to just read. Anyway I have had my 9 almost 10 <br/>
year old home for 2 years now , we started off with school at home and it was <br/>
horrible. I found this list not long after starting to homeschool. I went <br/>
through the deschooling and got alot of good advice from people of the list. <br/>
we did unschooling from Id say March through the summer. Then just as school <br/>
was about to start I got nervous because my daughter wasnt doing anything ( I <br/>
know , I know I should have left her alone) so I spent the money to sign her <br/>
up for Laurel Springs because I thought she needed the structure (ahem)  We <br/>
used that curriculum and it was good I thought , but the battles ........Need <br/>
I say more? We more or less wasted our money because 90% of the materials <br/>
went unused and now I feel like a failure for not following through with <br/>
anything Unschooling or schooling. I have tried to lay off of her as I feel <br/>
it is my fault for not being consistant. We have not done any school work at <br/>
all since aroung Feb. vaca. ( I notice this seems to be our cut off point) <br/>
I have so many things going on in my head , I dont know what is right or <br/>
wrong any more. I seriously considered putting her back in school for 5th <br/>
grade, my husband strongly against this , he feels that she has been out of <br/>
school for too long and is afraid she will have the shock of her life when <br/>
she gets there. Also he does not want to undo what we HAVE accomplished with <br/>
her. As far as what she wants , I have asked her if she would like to go <br/>
back. She goes back and forth with it , she likes the idea of having so many <br/>
kids around and the music concerts and the not feeling alone part (shes an <br/>
only child and there are no support groups around) But to actually go back to <br/>
school for school she doesnt like that at all. So I have not pushed the issue <br/>
with her ,but for myself I am driving myself crazy. At one point I had it all <br/>
set in my head that she was definately going back. Let me tell you the <br/>
feelings and thoughts that saved me from that. First I felt relieved, as you <br/>
all know homeschooling is a way of life therefore it is on my mind 24/7 I was <br/>
running out of ideas and was sick of being worried about if I was doing it <br/>
right or not.<br/>
Second I felt sad that I was giving up on her. (not on her part , on mine)<br/>
Third I was mad at myself for not being strong enough, creative enough, <br/>
patient enough.<br/>
Fourth., I was scared, of what would  school do to her. the kids the teachers <br/>
the STRUCTURE. <br/>
Then finally I decided that I just cant do it. I cannot send her back to <br/>
school. Period. <br/>
My bestfriend whom I trust implicitly with my feelings and I have had some <br/>
real good arguments about the fact that she is missing out on so much(her <br/>
thoughts ,not mine) we have finally agreed to disagree . All of her kids are <br/>
very popular and straight A students. You know the type , and dont get me <br/>
wrong I am happy for her and her kids. I always encourage them and talk <br/>
&quot;school&quot; with them. Because it makes them happy. okay enough of that. <br/>
My point is I am back to Unschooling. I know about the deschooling part of <br/>
it, and I think she has been deschooling, doing whatever comes along and such.<br/>
The child is a t.v. addict and I have completely laid off when it comes to <br/>
these things feeling that soon or later she will get bored and find something <br/>
to do. NOT. I swear sometimes I can see the brain cells floating off towards <br/>
the set. (that was supposed to be a joke) <br/>
Every one I know is giving me a hard time about , Im not tough enough on her <br/>
, she has no structure. She has no bedtime. She sleeps late in the <br/>
morning(what kind of a life is that for a child, hehee) Sometimes I can laugh <br/>
at that and sometimes it really bothers me.<br/>
Sometimes you can see the fact that she hasnt learned what the school kids <br/>
have and sometimes you would never know. ( This in itself does not bother me <br/>
, the fact that it bothers my family and my close friends does. They cannot <br/>
not see the big picture , they do not have any clue as to what I am trying to <br/>
get done.) Sometimes I can look going to the bank as a learning experience <br/>
other times I scoff and say who am I kidding she hasnt heard a word you have <br/>
said. Sometimes she fools me and she has!! Alot of times she has not.<br/>
Im afraid that if I dont bring things up she will  miss it. Im afraid if I <br/>
let my guard down and just live then she wont learn anything.  It must work <br/>
so many of you do it and your kids are learning. Some of them are <br/>
overlearning or over achievers . I keeep waiting for that. It has not come <br/>
yet. I keep my mouth shut. and I encourage her as often as possible. I keep <br/>
thinking just how much t.v. can she watch , how long can she play that <br/>
gameboy. She seems bored out of her mind ,but says she isnt. When I walk into <br/>
the room and she is watching t.v. or playing her gameboy, I quickly go away <br/>
and try to keep myself busy to keep from saying something like &quot;You are <br/>
watching t.v. again. &quot; well something to that effect. When she gets excited <br/>
that she just got to the next level on her gameboy. I do try to encourage <br/>
that and get excited for her. (sometimes that is a small feat for me)<br/>
I am sorry this is so long and kind of jumbled , but I had to get it out and <br/>
I had to talk to someone who is not going to tell me I am ruining her life. I <br/>
had to get some answers from someone. Thanks for reading. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431346014">Tamie, are you a Libra!?<br/>
<br/>
(Joking.)<br/>
<br/>
Is there a reason you can&#39;t get out of the house every day with your <br/>
daughter?  If she&#39;s watching TV, maybe that&#39;s the best, noisiest, most <br/>
stimulating thing and she is needing more stimulation.<br/>
<br/>
Is she in any music programs or lessons?  <br/>
<br/>
Can TV be augmented by new and different (or repeat-of-the-favorite) videos <br/>
that you enjoy too so you can hang out with her?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927748442">Hi Tamie,<br/>
<br/>
It will be okay.  Good thing we are not trying to produce products :).<br/>
I think she is one lucky young lady to have a Mom willing to jump<br/>
outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
Does your daughter know any other unschoolers?  Is there a group she<br/>
might like?  Does she have any interests in volunteering at the zoo, a<br/>
shelter, the neighbors?  Does she have access to the library?  Does she<br/>
like to sew, knit, garden, draw?  I would definitely keep appropriate<br/>
materials around for the moment she&#39;d like to try something she&#39;s seen<br/>
on TV (I&#39;m thinking Zoom, but there&#39;s also the cooking channel, HGTV,<br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
TV is a great escape.  I say, let her have it.  Join her for a couple<br/>
days, or whatever.  Read a book by Holt next to her while she watches,<br/>
be open to a conversation about boys, sex, food, whatever that might<br/>
come from a show.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend reading this article on video games:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/Articles/VideoGamesInterview.html">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/Articles/VideoGamesInterview.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Do you know what she likes about TV?  Is it the actors?  Maybe she&#39;d<br/>
like to join a fan club, or hop online to chat with other TV people (or<br/>
gameboy people).  Does she like the costumes?  Perhaps she&#39;d like to sew<br/>
one herself, or study period dress.  Is it mainly the escape?  I like<br/>
that, too.  I also like to knit, garden, take long baths, listen to loud<br/>
music, and read great books to escape.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking she&#39;s very lucky not to have a bedtime.  What&#39;s the point<br/>
anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Are you doing everything *you* want?  Reading, crafting, starting a home<br/>
business?  I have found that taking care of my own interests and<br/>
discussing them when my family wants me to, has really inspired others<br/>
to pursue their own goals.  Plus, I get so busy that I have very little<br/>
time to worry about how much TV they watch :o)  The forbidden fruit and<br/>
all that.<br/>
<br/>
Good for you, Tamie!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-158559933">Dear Tamie<br/>
<br/>
Your lovely daughter sounds quite normal, that is what<br/>
lots public school kids do, too, when they can!<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that she liked the idea of concerts and<br/>
other kids........sounds like music to me.....do you<br/>
and she have a music preference?  Dance?  are there<br/>
any dance groups or classes anywhere?  In past lives<br/>
I&#39;ve met some wonderful people through Scottish<br/>
Country Dancing, Contra Dancing, Intertribal Pow Wows,<br/>
Square Dancing, Country Dancing, Ballete,<br/>
International Folk Dancing, Modern, Jazz, Water<br/>
Ballete, Little Theatre,  my sister does lots with<br/>
puppets.....puppet shows and theatre....there are also<br/>
martial arts of all varieties which build persoanl<br/>
power,too.  Activieies that build strngth and empower<br/>
tend to make TV boring. And gameboys tedious. The arts<br/>
and crafts that someone mentioned can counteract that,<br/>
and you can watch a movie at the same time.  You can<br/>
rewind, if you get thirsty or something. Quilting is a<br/>
wonderfull way to start sewing.  Pot holders are just<br/>
little tiny quilts!  <br/>
<br/>
Besides......soon enough.....it&#39;ll wear off.  She&#39;ll<br/>
outgrow her clothes and HAVE to go shopping with you,<br/>
or learn how to make them! Also she&#39;ll get hungry and<br/>
thrirsty and HAVE to come out......you can grab her<br/>
attention then!  Let her choose the supper menu and<br/>
shop for it and cook it once a week or so. If she only<br/>
wants to cook carry-out pizza, make her find the best<br/>
deal! and make sure there is enough for everybody on<br/>
whatever budget she has to stick to, also don&#39;t let<br/>
her forget beverages! Desert?  Salad?  anybody have<br/>
allergies?  lots to think about when preparing food<br/>
for a family.  It is an empowering activity.<br/>
<br/>
I was awarded custody of my little sister when she was<br/>
11.  She survived. I wasn&#39;t sure that I would, all the<br/>
time, though!!  When she decided to go to college she<br/>
got a GED. She did that on her own. She now has BA in<br/>
Design and MS in Library Science. For a long time she<br/>
was a &quot;stay in her room&quot;  young person, too. And a<br/>
shut the door and climb out the window girl, later,<br/>
too!! If you would like to share specifics some more,<br/>
I&#39;m not adverse to talking off list. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be OK.....but sounds like you need something<br/>
for yourself!! What do YOU like to do?  Just do it. <br/>
She can&#39;t help but be interested, even if it does just<br/>
seem nosey, at first. Especially if you kind of hide<br/>
what you are working on, as if it is a surprise for<br/>
someone....<br/>
<br/>
Sharon <br/>
<br/>
ps  if you REALLY have to cower in the fetal position,<br/>
get in bed, it is much more comfortable, and you<br/>
probably are tired! Do you stay up waiting for you<br/>
daughter to sleep, then worry, then get up with your<br/>
husband in the morning? That you may be exhausted is<br/>
one reason you might feel so frustrated.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993170345">Hi Sarah,<br/>
Thanks for being so supportive. Kearstin has many interests, she goes back <br/>
and forth(she likes that ;) ) Right now she is trying to raise a baby turtle <br/>
that she found. This has been alot of fun for all of actually , even Daddy <br/>
kicked in his expertise. But this is the first time in awhile that she has <br/>
gotten excited about something and she is already getting bored , the poor <br/>
turtle doesnt roll over , play dead , fetch, and damn it he refuses to get <br/>
the paper. We (hubby and I) spent alot of money housing this turtle and spent <br/>
hours reading about what to do with it and now I think he will be orphaned to <br/>
the &quot;grandparents&quot; thats what she calls us. She would love to sew I think . <br/>
Ill have to look into that. , as far as is she interested in any specific on <br/>
the t.v. , no I dont think so , she mostly seems to be vegging. I have sat <br/>
with her and try to see what she sees but you see I am at a disadvantage a <br/>
big one . I hate t.v. , always have, I would rather have my face stuck in a <br/>
book. she watches with her Dad alot. and they seem to laugh alot. I havent <br/>
quit figured out why. Dont get me wrong I will watch t.v. occasionally and I <br/>
will laugh too but only at cartoons LOL. and usually not more that a 1/2 <br/>
hour. Give me a book almost any book and Ill disappear and forget everything <br/>
around me. <br/>
As far as doing things for me , I definately do. We have two horses and I <br/>
spend alot of time at the barn, she really has no interest.That kills me <br/>
because when I was a kid I would have done anything for a horse.I dont push <br/>
it on her she does her own thing when were there. She does have a thing for <br/>
rocks.   ??? Im not sure what her thing is yet but she can spend hours <br/>
sitting on this little hill and she has one of my horse brushes and her &quot;rock <br/>
hammer&quot; and she crushes them then brushes them off then crushes them some <br/>
more. When I asked her what she was doing she got her little sheepish grin <br/>
and says she likes to see all the different colors that the rock has. She <br/>
never brings them home. <br/>
She also sometimes gets mad at me for doing the things I like to do. When I <br/>
ask her what else she would want to do she says &quot;I dont know&quot; then she takes <br/>
off and I dont see her for a couple of hours. <br/>
Anyway sorry this was so long again <br/>
Thanks for your input though I really appreciate it.<br/>

Kearstin does love music , she picks up anything that has a tune , we have <br/>
known this since she was very young. I wonder if I should have turned the <br/>
music down in the car when she was a baby. (I was a young mother) the music <br/>
was always on. She likes any and all. She is the only kid I know of that can <br/>
sing the Ann Murray commercial to a T. Its very cute to watch. She takes <br/>
flute lessons and likes it , but got bored with doing it at home, does really <br/>
good at lessons then forgets it till the next week.<br/>
She does have alot of interests it just seems that she loses interests so <br/>
easy and gets really bored, with everything , she never finishes anything <br/>
(neither do I)  . <br/>
The cooking for the family idea is a great one , she likes to cook , I never <br/>
thought about asking her to do the&quot;menu&quot;  Thanks for that one. I will ask her.<br/>
Sounds like you did a great job with your sister.Shes lucky to have you and <br/>
maybe you werer lucky to have her. I have a younger sister that was born when <br/>
I was 11 and my older sister and I ALWAYS had her , she slept in my room so <br/>
it was me who got to get up for late night feedings because mom worked <br/>
nights. That taught me alot. Also have a brother who was born when I was 16. <br/>
My father had custody of him as his mother is manic depressive but also <br/>
abuses drugs and drinks too much. So she is always out of balance. My father <br/>
is a truck driver so I had my brother alot too. I actually loved it.<br/>
<br/>
When I curl up I will make sure that Im in bed. (with a book and a cup of <br/>
coffee)<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>

Son #3 found a baby turtle in the river about 8 or 9 years ago.  He was<br/>
about the size of a fifty cent piece.  He brought him home in the bottom of<br/>
a Pepsi cup.<br/>
<br/>
He has Tennessee and Sweet Pea &quot;trained&quot; so they come up and &quot;beg&quot; and eat<br/>
shrimp out of his hands.  Hubby has Tennesee &quot;trained&quot; to make noises at<br/>
him.  And believe me, that is a strange site to see!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and a friend&#39;s, April, likes to go for &quot;walks&quot; on their lawn (no<br/>
fertilizers or weed killers allowed) and actually comes when they call her.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her not to give up hope, though, I agree, you&#39;ll probably never be able<br/>
to teach them to fetch &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
P.S. What kind of turtle is it?  Tennessee is a Western Pond, Sweet Pea is a<br/>
Red-Eared Slider and April is a Reeves.<br/>

better known as Sun turtles. Cant find that term in any of the books or <br/>
anywhere on the internet though. Right now we are still trying to get him to <br/>
eat. A friend of ours who owes a pet store told us that he could go weeks <br/>
without eating and to just keep it available sooner or later he is going to <br/>
eat. He is really cute. I always liked turtles and wanted a tortoise. I <br/>
wanted one of those huge Galopagus tortoises but they are running 3,ooo for <br/>
captive bred. Thats a little steep. But my second choice was a leapard <br/>
turtle. They are very striking. Bright yellow and black stripes. And get <br/>

Sorry I cant help you with that song. Never heard of the show either. Glad to <br/>
know we are not the only ones who Never, Ever finish anything I guess the <br/>
truth is I get bored easy too.  Kearstin sings to herself all the time. To <br/>
tell the truth at this point I cant think straight when Im driving , shes <br/>
forever telling me to &quot;turn it up mom, sing with me mom!!&quot; I keep telling Mom <br/>
cant sing but she doesnt care until I open my big mouth then she constantly <br/>
corrects me. &quot;no mom , its supposed to sound like....&quot; I can never get it <br/>
right. Last year we brought my younger sister to Conn. to start her first <br/>
year of college. and she made me sing Brother John all the way home in a loud <br/>
voice , in a soft voice, in a mad voice , in a happy voice, in silly voice, <br/>
in a serious voice . oh yeah we got them all. And I personally never want to <br/>
hear that particular song again. I have to admit though we did have a good <br/>
time, and I absolutely love to hear her real laugh. The Belly Giggle is what <br/>
we call it. She doesnt show that side of herself that often. <br/>
Good luck with your song.<br/>

We found that our turtles are very picky eaters and don&#39;t like being fed<br/>
only one thing.  We buy shrimp, dried turtle food and mix it with some koi<br/>
food (non-sinking types only) and give them goldfish grass.  We also buy<br/>
feeder goldfish and put them in the tank.  Some weeks they eat a lot, some<br/>
weeks they eat nothing.  Some weeks they clean up only the dry food, some<br/>
weeks they only want shrimp.  They eat lots less in the winter and more in<br/>
the spring and summer.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, that&#39;s a bucket of money for a tortoise.   Out here we can buy captive<br/>
bred tortoises for about $300 (for the big ones you see in the zoo) and  max<br/>
$700 for the African dwarf ones.  I like the pet shop that sells them<br/>
because they will only sell them after folks read all about their care and<br/>
make arrangements for them in wills or in some other manner since they<br/>
outlive people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843722151">**Right now she is trying to raise a baby turtle <br/>
that she found. This has been alot of fun for all of actually , even Daddy <br/>
kicked in his expertise. But this is the first time in awhile that she has <br/>
gotten excited about something and she is already getting bored , the poor <br/>
turtle doesnt roll over , play dead , fetch, and damn it he refuses to get <br/>
the paper.**<br/>
<br/>
In our city (San Jose) there is a fun reptile store.  It&#39;s an opportunity<br/>
to observe a lot of interesting animal behavior without having to own<br/>
anything.  (A bargain!)  So, if there is one in your community, it&#39;s a fun<br/>
outing, and you have to buy turtle food anyway.  I think the store here has<br/>
a website, www.coolreptiles.com, but I&#39;m not positive that&#39;s the correct<br/>
URL.<br/>
<br/>
**She does have a thing for <br/>
rocks.   ??? Im not sure what her thing is yet but she can spend hours <br/>
sitting on this little hill and she has one of my horse brushes and her<br/>
&quot;rock <br/>
hammer&quot; and she crushes them then brushes them off then crushes them some <br/>
more. When I asked her what she was doing she got her little sheepish grin <br/>
and says she likes to see all the different colors that the rock has. She <br/>
never brings them home. **<br/>
<br/>
I want to recommend (to everyone) a picture book that I enjoyed called<br/>
_Stone Girl, Bone Girl_ about a turn of the century English girl who was a<br/>
noted fossil hunter as a child.  (right level for kids from 5-9, I would<br/>

so.  I hate to take money out of your pocket for something that you may or<br/>
may not like.<br/>
<br/>
Looking it up on Amazon, I see the author is Laurence Anholt.  Their price<br/>
is $12.76.<br/>
<br/>
There are three reviews on the Amazon site, and 2 links to other books<br/>
about Mary Anning.  (One of which you may like better, or may be able to<br/>
get cheaper.)<br/>
<br/>
You can also get an idea what the artwork looks like from the cover<br/>
picture.  It&#39;s swirling, bright folk art.  Some of the inside pages are a<br/>
little surreal.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy it.<br/>

P.S.  (I&#39;ve had good luck with bibliofind.com for finding inexpensive used<br/>
copies of interesting books.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401923278">Yes , Yes , Yes . this is sort of what happens. I guess I learned to keep my <br/>
big fat mouth shut , I guess I can stand up tall , have the hubby tie the <br/>
rope from head to toe and gag me. This isnt always the case mind you, but I <br/>
do , do it alot. <br/>
Maybe my poor baby is scared of me!!!  LOL<br/>

&gt;for a $7.95 book - found it for $55.  I don&#39;t think so!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a surprise to me.  I just found out yesterday, when I was trying to<br/>
find Rick&#39;s textbooks at a discount.<br/>
<br/>
And I had also forgotten that Half.com was swallowed by Ebay.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, there are fewer places to look when you want books.<br/>
<br/>
I have a very negative impression of the Amazon rare book search<br/>
capability.  Bibliofind used to be consistently better / cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever used abe.books?<br/>

P.S.  (I didn&#39;t get park announcements from SCV for last week.)</div>
