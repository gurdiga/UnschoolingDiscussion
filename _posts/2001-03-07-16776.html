<br>You cannot possibly, is my opinion.
<br>
<br>&lt;&lt;.  She has a 10 year
<br>old who hates math and is using a textbook.   Do you have any
<br>suggestions for user friendly math books.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<br>If she uses a textbook or makes her kids use even user-friendly math books, 
<br>she&#39;s not unschooling and to pretend or believe otherwise will be a big rock 
<br>in the road for her getting to real unschooling and (MAYBE) arranging life so 
<br>that her 10 year old doesn&#39;t hate math from now on. &nbsp;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461406993">Maybe she doesn&#39;t hate math.  Maybe she hates being forced to do math.   A<br/>
book can only be user friendly to someone who WANTS to read it.<br/>

Can someone who says that they unschool most subjects, but not (insert<br/>
subject here) explain this thinking to me?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602274000">Sherry,<br/>
I had the same problem. I solved that by not requiring any math workbooks<br/>
at all. What we have been doing is learning math (shhh, don&#39;t tell) by<br/>
playing games. Yahtzee works wonderfully for addition and multiplication<br/>
skills, Uno and racko are also good. There is a website that was showing<br/>
bingo math that you could download into the computer, but I think we are<br/>
going to make our own. IT is so easy...make a template for a bingo card<br/>
on your write program whatever that is and then print that template out.<br/>
in the squares, put numbers that will correspond with what the announcer<br/>
says. Example=N 6x6 so would be answer 36 in the square. You can make<br/>
these up out of poster board, construction papers, etc and use beans,<br/>
beads, pennies, etc to put over the squares. It can be a project that<br/>
both parent and child create and its fun. You can do addition bingo,<br/>
subtraction, bingo, multiplication bingo, division bingo, etc. You can<br/>
also teach fractions by cooking...using cooking skills for fractions<br/>
helps the child learn actual math and have fun at the same time! (and it<br/>
also has practical applications). Another suggestion is to use Monopoly<br/>
or life or other games that also promote math skills. One I like is Math<br/>
Games and Activities from around the world (The Sycamore Tree 14.95),<br/>
Amazing Math with your kids (sycamore tree 14.95) and Money Dominoes (the<br/>
sycamore tree 10.25). I have not used these last three, but I am planning<br/>
on buying them. Some kids just simply hate worksheets and repition...and<br/>
this is one way to help them enjoy math without feeling like they are<br/>
being bogged down.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Lenise</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I don&#39;t use anythng.&nbsp; The kids, however, use 
the world around them.&nbsp; They go to the shops, count their pocket money 
again and again.&nbsp; My second daughter,&nbsp; who unlike my first, was never 
asked or forced to do any workbooks, actully loves doing them.&nbsp; She gets 
dressed up in a school uniform we got from a charity shop and plays 
school.&nbsp; Her big sister gives her worksheets to do.&nbsp; That happens once 
in a while, but moslty, she plays, and play invovles logic, and strategy, and 
geometry and systematic thinking.&nbsp; THey build dens, use lego and K&#39;nex, 
count as high as they can, measure each others body parts, measure how fast they 
are growing, keep time to music, design patterns, construct models out of paper, 
share things out between them, etc. My 10 year old now likes to ask about square 
roots and imaginary numbers and other things just because they are interesting 
to her.&nbsp; An important point is that it doesn&#39;t actually matter what they 
learn as long as they are doing what THEY want to do.&nbsp; I don&#39;t like the 
idea of watching what my children do in order to tick off imaginary boxes about 
their achievements.&nbsp; I was recently at a freind&#39;s house, a friend whose 
children go to school, and was looking at the literature about maths that the 
school sent home to parents about what the children would be doing this year in 
maths.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was so pathetic and narrow minded and there was 
little more than the erroneous idea that maths is all about adding up and taking 
away.&nbsp; My children&#39;s understanding of mathematical concepts is way ahead of 
what these teachers expected of their pupils, but probably way behind what they 
would be expected to perform, ie, to recite their time tables or some such 
nonsense.&nbsp; It is, I suppose another example of how unschooling works, even 
when the academic goals are considered.&nbsp; But, of course, none of us should 
decide what our childrens&#39; goals are for them.&nbsp; If they want to learn math, 
they will, if they don&#39;t, they will still be able to function in a world full of 
calculators.</font></div>

<br>
<br>Just browsing around our living room and thought I would send off these 
<br>titles:
<br>
<br>The Number Devil -- a fun book about a boy who &quot;hates math&quot; in school and has 
<br>these dreams in which The Number Devil takes him on mathematical adventures 
<br>(less arithmetic, more math, as the devil explains) and he has some fun with 
<br>it. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>The Man Who Counted -- the travels and adventures of a Man Who Counts -- he 
<br>figures out math/logic puzzles as he travels through the Middle East visiting 
<br>camel herders and kings and others and settling disputes or solving problems 
<br>in their lives.
<br>
<br>We are also currently browsing in The Cartoon Guide to Physics -- not too 
<br>math heavy but a fun intro. &nbsp;This is a good series of books -- they have a 
<br>Cartoon Guide to History, etc. -- and might be a way to blend a couple of 
<br>areas. &nbsp;And I am reading (and sharing with my son) a book called Chaos -- 
<br>explaining the science of chaos, as if a Mom doesn&#39;t know what that is -- but 
<br>it is very readable and my son and I have looked at the examples (weather 
<br>systems and waterwheels so far) and they involve some math.
<br>
<br>We also have a few CDs that the kids use -- the Math Blaster series for 
<br>practice/drill type things, Geometry Blaster is actually fun, Math in the 
<br>Real World -- a rock band travels around and has to figure out math-related 
<br>situations, Rollercoaster Tycoon -- you build a theme park, Thinking Things, 
<br>etc. &nbsp;There are tons of fun CDs out and you just about can&#39;t avoid using some 
<br>sort of math.
<br>
<br>Then, of course, board games -- backgammon, chess, Pokemon (yes, Pokemon), 
<br>Powerpuff Girls (ugh -- but my 6 yo daughter likes it!), card games -- they 
<br>both like poker, Monopoly, whatever you family likes.
<br>
<br>The Math Shark -- a hand-held gizmo for math practice. &nbsp;Any number of games 
<br>the kids download from online -- silly but there&#39;s some content in some of 
<br>them. &nbsp;The calculator -- my daughter likes it but then I can&#39;t find it when I 
<br>want to work!
<br>
<br>Anyway, that&#39;s what is in my living room. &nbsp;Guess I better straighten up a 
<br>little! :)

sections for using math in real life.&nbsp; For example there is a section on 
bills &amp; budgets and shows how to make a budget, how to balance a checkbook, 
etc... then there is one for investments showing how to figure out percentages 
for earnings and then a tax section plus many more but it all has to do with how 
we REALLY use math, unlike problem after problem in some book........it may end

 </span></blockquote>I thought this might be something nice to share on<br/>
those lines. My ds is only 5 but he of course &quot;worked&quot;<br/>
with me when I manned my sis&#39;s store in the mall. He<br/>
felt he was earning his money by helping pick up after<br/>
around the place, especially after his crafts and<br/>
stuff. Anyway, he would get 2 dollars everyday that he<br/>
came to work with me and he was saving up for a<br/>
marionette puppet in a store upstairs that was 15<br/>
dollars. He would everyday subtract how much he had<br/>
made so far and try to figure out how much he had<br/>
left, then ask me how many more dayz it would take. He<br/>
saved it up and bought what he wanted and he hardly<br/>
ever plays with it but it is special cuz he did it<br/>
himself. Now when him or his sister gets some pocket<br/>
change from me he advises her &quot;save it, Aspen, cuz<br/>
then tomorrow you could get two more quarters and then<br/>
two more and two more and you can save it up to buy<br/>
something you want.&quot; It&#39;s cute. :)<br/>

I&#39;ll quote you there, if you don&#39;t mind. <br/>
