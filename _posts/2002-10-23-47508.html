<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436346481">We&#39;re making it and I just wanted to share. Our son Joseph has always had a <br/>
hard time with anger and not knowing what to do with it. Usually the result <br/>
has been to hit his sister. It&#39;s something we&#39;ve been working on for awhile. <br/>
I usually separate them and try talking to him and giving him other <br/>
alternatives. He usually just doesn&#39;t want to talk or even admit he&#39;s mad. <br/>
For quite a while they couldn&#39;t play in his room because I can&#39;t see in <br/>
there and that&#39;s always when there was a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short. My daughter still knows how to push his buttons and we&#39;re <br/>
working on that too. They wre outside yesterday and playing with bubbles. <br/>
Joseph had this big bubble wand and Sierra came in saying Joseph just threw <br/>
it down on the ground and broke it. Joseph came right in with a scowl and I <br/>
asked what happened. He said he threw it and it broke. I asked why and he <br/>
said, &quot;Because Sierra made me so very mad!&quot; Well what a revelation that was. <br/>
That was the first time he&#39;s actually admitted that quickly what he was <br/>
feeling and why he did something. So I told him I understood he was mad and <br/>
good for him that he threw the bubble wand and didn&#39;t hit his sister. Well <br/>
the look on his face was priceless. He actually did something good!!! <br/>
Meaning he was feeling awful and although the outcome wasn&#39;t great (broken <br/>
bubble wand) he still did a right thing by not hurting. So I had a talk with <br/>
him and then with his sister who was pushing buttons and is so good at it.<br/>
<br/>
At the dinner table we talked about how he handled the situation and his dad <br/>
was very proud too. I saw confidence in Joseph that he can now handle things <br/>
differently. My mom was there for dinner and had to throw in &quot;but he broke <br/>
the bubble wand&quot; to which we quickly said so what, his sister wasn&#39;t hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Might not sound like a big deal but it was to us and also Joseph. He&#39;s been <br/>
struggling with his anger for a while now. See, I&#39;ve been listening here. <br/>

If you want the handout, just mail me a self addressed, stamped envelope.<br/>
If a lot of people want it, I&#39;ll also need $1.00 to help with copying and <br/>

<br/>
I have an &quot;I did it and it&#39;s working!&quot; story, too.<br/>
<br/>
Tim and I were having fun last night, just goofing around, when he asked if<br/>
I&#39;d read more of our current book.  I said, &quot;Sure, kick off your shoes and<br/>
hop up on the sofa with me.&quot;  So, still feeling silly, he literally kicked<br/>
off a shoe.  <br/>
<br/>
It hit probably the only thing breakable in the entire house that&#39;s not in a<br/>
cabinet; a ceramic goblet that belongs to his father&#39;s.  As the potter later<br/>
said when I talked to him, &quot;It flunked the bounce test&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Tim flipped and started screaming, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; over and over.  I<br/>
took a deep breath and said, &quot;Me too.&quot;  So we cried over it together, and<br/>
called dh to apologize to him (because Tim wanted to get telling Daddy about<br/>
it over with), and cried some more.<br/>
<br/>
Then we got out the broom and dustpan, and swept up the mess, and called the<br/>
potter who made it, and asked him to make us another, wrote him a check, and<br/>
it was over.  (Oh, and we found a spot in a cupboard where the new one can<br/>
live!)<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I actually did it right for once, and didn&#39;t punish over<br/>
something, and Tim felt what he was supposed to feel (sorrow over having<br/>
broken something we cared about) instead of what he shouldn&#39;t have had to<br/>
feel (fear and anger because I screamed at him or punished him).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.  I can do this!<br/>

Great Ren!! Kudos for us both today. And who said an old dog can&#39;t learn new <br/>
tricks?! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And by the way, you made me nuts when I first started to read that post. I <br/>
was thinking &quot;Gee, Sierra wasn&#39;t playing with a skateboard.&quot; Thought maybe I <br/>
had posted about my daughter and lost my mind and forgot!!!!<br/>

I can mail it to you if you want to email me your address.....the handout for <br/>
the conference consisted of about 4-5 pages of a list of simple, cheap things <br/>
to have fun with.<br/>
I am also going to be working on posting some cool ideas and recipes to our <br/>
new webpage (LeAanne is working on it!!!) which should be up and running soon.<br/>
She&#39;s waiting on me to get some stuff emailed and then we should have a link <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785978547">Well my whole workshop at the conference was about fun things <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to do on a <br/>
&gt; budget.<br/>
&gt; If you want the handout, just mail me a self addressed, <br/>
&gt; stamped envelope.<br/>
&gt; If a lot of people want it, I&#39;ll also need $1.00 to help with <br/>
&gt; copying and <br/>
&gt; mailing costs. OR, if you&#39;re patient, I&#39;ll retype it online <br/>
&gt; and email some <br/>
&gt; ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would be interested too. Where do I send my dollar????  Also, was it<br/>
taped? If so do you know how I could get a copy and the cost?<br/>
thanks for sharing this,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625147895"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starsuncloud@...">starsuncloud@...</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I can mail it to you if you want to email me your address.....the handout <br/>
for the conference consisted of about 4-5 pages of a list of simple, cheap <br/>
things to have fun with.<br/>
I am also going to be working on posting some cool ideas and recipes to our <br/>
new webpage (LeAanne is working on it!!!) which should be up and running <br/>
soon. She&#39;s waiting on me to get some stuff emailed and then we should have <br/>
a link&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh I want one too. I could always use ideas. I&#39;m creatively challenged!! Do <br/>
you want to send me your address and I&#39;ll send you a SASE. Will a legal size <br/>
envelope be enough?<br/>
