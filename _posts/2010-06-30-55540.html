<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137072447">Because this is relevant to Sandra&#39;s angst over the situation I thought I would bring it here. <br/>
<br/>
I am unpaid. I stay at home with my children and I help them and I help my husband and I help my dog and I help my cats and we have a good life. Sometimes I write on a few lists about unschooling. Sometimes I write about marriage. Nobody pays me and I have no aspirations that I&#39;m helping other folks make money. <br/>
<br/>
The other day David and I cooked a meal for a campload of people. The camp of people wanted to pay us for the food we made. We didn&#39;t want to be paid, it was a gift. Payment would have made it a service instead of a gift. Claire, your thanking me for my gift of my experience and my knowledge as it applies to your ability to make a living using it sullies it in a similar way. You&#39;ve turned me into a freebie resource for your livelihood. <br/>
<br/>
I imagine that a lot of people on this list use the gifts of knowledge and experience that are offered here in their day-to-day lives, beyond the parent-child interactions. I know that my actions beyond my family are informed by things that I have learned on this list. But I don&#39;t want to know that I am acting as a private researcher for someone who is leaving me unpaid. It&#39;s like when lots of grad student have their ideas and work stolen by their professors for a publication. It isn&#39;t sharing any more. It&#39;s freeloading, it&#39;s theft, it&#39;s something wrong. <br/>
<br/>
Recently there have been instances of news shows interviewing unschoolers about what they do, and those unschoolers have been edited to look amusing and nuts and a bit irresponsible. I recognize that what you are doing isn&#39;t to the same degree, but there is a level of you taking us for a ride for your own gain that is similar to these news shows. It doesn&#39;t make this list or these people bad to be nervous of someone who comes and preaches and takes and doesn&#39;t offer anything of value in return, not even honest curiousity. <br/>
<br/>
So you aren&#39;t really welcome. It wasn&#39;t actually aimed at you. I&#39;m happy to do what I do when I do it. It&#39;s actually pretty easy to research stuff for your own self as Su skillfully demonstrated. I&#39;m just sometimes a bit of a show off. <br/>
