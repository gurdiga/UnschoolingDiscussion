<div id="ygrps-yiv-722865673">I&#39;m wondering if I took the right approach on an issue with my SIL <br/>
and niece, so I thought I&#39;d throw it out to you all, and get opinions.<br/>
My niece goes to PS and my SIL teaches 4th grade.  My SIL and I <br/>
started out with the same parenting beliefs (fam bed, BF...) in fact, <br/>
she influenced me a lot.  Ordered me Mothering, told me about LLL. <br/>
Anyway, over the years, we have gone in different directions, but <br/>
have remained good friends, though our busy separate lives, keep us <br/>
from seeing each other very much.  <br/>
Their family dynamics are pretty different from ours. My niece is in <br/>
7th grade and is going through all that stuff(crap) that goes on <br/>
socially for kids in school.  She has been dealing with lots of <br/>
school/social stuff for years, but they think it&#39;s all normal, and <br/>
necessary for a healthy upbringing..yada,yada...  My niece just made <br/>
the honor role.  She excels academically. <br/>
I have a good relationship with my niece.  I like her a lot, and we <br/>
get along well.  We talk a lot, and joke around a lot.  She comes <br/>
over just to hang out and play with my little ones.  But we&#39;ve had <br/>
one issue that keeps coming between us.  My mother!  My mom and I <br/>
have gotten really close over the past 5 years or so.  She stopped <br/>
working, I started homeschooling and we have been able to get <br/>
together quite a bit because of this.  My mom lives in FL(I live in <br/>
MD), so I visit every winter, sometimes twice(this year, it looks <br/>
like 3 times.  She comes up and spends the summer in our resort town <br/>
in her own apt. and we spend most days at the beach with her.  My <br/>
children adore her, and so do I really.  My niece has a lot of <br/>
problems with all the time we get to spend with her, and she doesn&#39;t.<br/>
She has made it clear over the years that we have infringed on her <br/>
private Grandmom time.  We&#39;ll come to the beach one day, and she&#39;ll <br/>
roll her eyes at the fact that we are there.  She complains loudly <br/>
about the fact that we always get to go to FL and visit.  My mom <br/>
tries to make special times with just her, but has come to feel that <br/>
my niece can be a little obnoxious about the way she expresses her <br/>
rights to have her to herself, orto  have equal time.  So every time <br/>
my kids get to see her,  my mother is suppose to make sure my niece <br/>
gets as many times spent with her too.<br/>
I can understand this, coming from the mind of a 12 year old, but my <br/>
SIL seems to encourage this behavior.  She makes comments to me about <br/>
my nieces feelings, and how much time we get to spend with my mom.  <br/>
She seems to be implying I should purposely spend less time with my <br/>
mom to make it fair for her daughter.  <br/>
My first thoughts to these incedents are, &quot;tough!&quot;.  We chose to have <br/>
a free lifestyle,  my mother encourages us to come, and invites us to <br/>
do things, and loves being with my kids, and has always made that <br/>
clear, why should I change anything!?<br/>
Boy this is getting long.  <br/>
Well the latest is, my mom suggested we come for Easter this year.  <br/>
My 11yo dd said she wanted to have Easter at our house, so we said we <br/>
would come a different time.  Then we found out my dh was going to be <br/>
away for Easter, and my dd siad that going to FL would be better than <br/>
being here without dad.  My mother was here for a funeral, and I had <br/>
taken my dd and my niece to the funeral 1 1/2 hrs away and met my <br/>
mother there.  The girls drove back with her, and my niece made plans <br/>
to come to FL over Easter for her spring break.  She wanted my dd to <br/>
come too, but my dd didn&#39;t want to.  So a few days after this, we <br/>
deide that going for Easter would be fun, and I didn&#39;t realize my<br/>
 niece was planning on going(niether did my mother, because they had <br/>
had the one conversation, and she hadn&#39;t heard from her or my SIL <br/>
again about it.  So when I called to say, that we changed our minds <br/>
and would be coming, she was very happy.  Then last night my SIL <br/>
called and when I told her we were going for Easter, she told my <br/>
niece, and my niece stormed off into her room, apparently devistated <br/>
by the fact that we all would bbe there too, and that would RUIN her <br/>
time.<br/>
My SIL was telling me all of this, and I didn&#39;t know what to say.  I <br/>
was kind of ticked and thought she was being rude to imply that maybe <br/>
we should change our plans now.  I have 4 kids and we had already <br/>
discussed that we would be going for Easter.  My 11yo was infuriated <br/>
that my niece would act like this(once again) and she was saying that <br/>
if we changed our plans for someone who was being rude and selfish, <br/>
that SHE would have a fit to.  Well, she did.  We spent the entire <br/>
evening discussing it, and I decided I would have no fun being there, <br/>
knowing my niece wouldn&#39;t want us there.  My niece called and talked <br/>
to my dd, and said she wasn&#39;t going to go at Easter and would pick <br/>
another time to go (my dd thought she was being a big baby, but I <br/>
thought she actually made a good decision, probably with the help of <br/>
her mother)I decided that since we are the ones that have the <br/>
freedom, that we could choose another time to go, since it was so <br/>
important to her, to not have all of us there.  My dd reluctantly <br/>
agreed, with the promise of us getting to go twice(once when my <br/>
parents wouldn&#39;t be there and we would house sit, then again, after <br/>
Easter.  My niece immediately felt bad, that we changed our plans for <br/>
her.  I think my SIL did too.  She told me that my niece said &quot;now I <br/>
don&#39;t want to go at all! and started to cry.<br/>
They called this morning with new plans and we are still working out <br/>
the details.  Though we&#39;re still not going for Easter.<br/>
I was a little hurt by my niece, and angry at my SIL handling of her <br/>
daughters attitude about it all, but I bit the bullet and put on a <br/>
happy face and said it was all fine.  And really it mostly is.  I <br/>
feel better.  The behavoir and attitude is theirs to deal with now, <br/>
and it will all work out fine.<br/>
I just have a nagging feeling, I have just justified my nieces <br/>
behavior, and I still feel hurt at the fact that she can so easily <br/>
let us know how much she doesn&#39;t want us around at times.<br/>
I can see how having 4 kids around ages 2 to 11 can very much change <br/>
the dynamics of any environment, but I still think it&#39;s rude to <br/>
express those feelings.  <br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s pretty much over now, and I am doing my best to not have <br/>
any hard feelings about it all.  They are still very important to me, <br/>
and I guess that is why it hurts a little.  <br/>
It always makes me feel better to type it all out.  I usually end up <br/>
deleting what I write, because I figure out my feelings by the end, <br/>
but I&#39;m still going to send this one.<br/>
