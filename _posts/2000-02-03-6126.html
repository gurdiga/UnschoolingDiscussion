<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708031549">Hi Kim-<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen the Frasier episode where Niles *starts* to run w/scissors and then looks down and starts walking very slowly and carefully?<br/>
<br/>
Or the latest Weird Al Yankovic CD untitled &quot;Running With Scissors&quot;.  Both just cracked me up.<br/>
<br/>
I used to listen to Weird Al back in his Dr. Demento days when I was in college.  gulp-20 yrs ago.  I find it delightful that my boys now enjoy listening to him.  :-)<br/>
