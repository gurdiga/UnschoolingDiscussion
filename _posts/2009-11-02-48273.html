<div id="ygrps-yiv-643358123">I think this is my first post, although I&#39;ve been reading here for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 sons, one 15 and the other 13.  They&#39;ve been out of school for 3 years now and feeling more like unschoolers for the past yearish.  It&#39;s been a continual world shift for the past few years and I like the direction we are headed, although it is uncomfortable at times.<br/>
<br/>
And this is one of those times that I need more insight.  My 15 year old has been close friends with a neighbor boy for the past 4 years. He is 18.  He&#39;s kind of a wild child with a very controlling mother. The friend hangs out here a lot, and I do like him. He was very much into drinking and partying just before becoming of legal age (I&#39;m in Quebec, the drinking age is 18) and has continued in that vein but more openly now. DS15 is very open about talking to me about his friend&#39;s antics.  DS15 has gone to a couple parties with the friend and has had a couple drinks at them.  I&#39;m not hugely concerned over that other than the whole underaged bit. There was a Halloween party he was supposed to attend with the friend, but didn&#39;t.  He told me later that there was a lot of pot being smoked and his friend, who did smoke, drove home after the party. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my problem, he is a new driver--he just got his license a month ago. He has driven with my son to the local stores no problem there. Last night was a neighborhood &#39;movie night&#39; where the guys head off to a nieghbor&#39;s house for action flicks and the gals head off for their movies.  My son came home to grab a burger before heading out.  Of course his friend had to drive the distance it would have taken 2 minutes to walk.  I was sitting up in the computer room and the window was open. Moments later I heard the screeching of tires in the opposite direction of the house they were going to.  Then I heard it again. Then a car driving down the next street with the loud music going toward the direction of the neighbor&#39;s.  I called over to their house and asked for my son.  He had just arrived and I asked him about what I had heard.  He was very quiet and didn&#39;t want to answer my question, probably because he didn&#39;t want to lie to me.  I hung up after expressing my concern.<br/>
<br/>
Later that night, after we were all home again, I asked him about it.  He said, yes it was them.  The friend wanted to show off how powerful the motor of the car was and went to a parking lot at the nearby park to do donuts.  He said he talked to his friend after my call about how the donuts were a bad idea. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m worried that my son driving with his friend is a bad idea all around.  My son is generally quite good about setting limits with his friend and being the voice of reason.  I&#39;m trying to figure out where I can draw the line and be respectful of my son&#39;s choices. Or how to approach this differently.<br/>
<br/>
And, as an aside, please tell me how I could have edited this down while retaining the pertinent information. I realize this is quite long.<br/>

I&#39;m not a huge fan of scare tactics, but have you talked to him about the reality of drivers like that?  Every person that I&#39;ve known personally that has been killed in a car accident, the accident has been directly caused by wild driving and drinking by teenagers.  <br/>
<br/>
Has your son been scared while driving with him?  If he&#39;s good about setting limits and reasoning with his friend, you may have nothing to worry about.  Doing donuts in a parking lot is kind of fun, not entirely dangerous.  Drinking and driving is dangerous, reckless driving on the road is dangerous.  I&#39;d be concerned too.  If your son feels safe driving with him though, I&#39;d be inclined to trust that.  He has the choice to ride with him, or get another ride.  I&#39;d also be inclined to talk directly to the teen driver as well, just to make sure he knows that you are concerned, but would like to trust him. <br/>

I don&#39;t know, it didn&#39;t seem terribly long and you gave important details.<br/>

Definitely this.   I&#39;d just plainly tell him that if he wanted to be a  <br/>
dick, not to do it while my kid was in the car.<br/>
