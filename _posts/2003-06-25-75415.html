<div id="ygrps-yiv-915918771">can you answer me a question, Sandra?<br/>
<br/>
Did you post that after Christina of &quot;unschooled automan&quot; fame, or <br/>
before?<br/>
<br/>
I have spent SOME KIND OF TIME clicking through messages, and have <br/>
something of a system down, but Christina was here at the beginning <br/>
of June (Just got that far this evening) and the beginning of June <br/>
seems too late for that post. I seem to remember it coming sooner?<br/>
<br/>
anyway<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh. Mrs. Focus on One Thing Until Her Eyeballs Fall Out. Now I <br/>
GOTTA find that post. It&#39;s a matter of PRINCIPLE at this point. It&#39;s <br/>
that post, or BUST...<br/>

I have no idea.  It seems like it was a month or so ago.  Sheesh.<br/>

I tried looking on my Mac by phrases I could think of that might have been <br/>
in, and checked google in case maybe it was on the bulletin board.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had company today and didn&#39;t expect it to last so long (Holly ended up <br/>
babysitting, and Marty spent hours online and Kirby needed karate transport, <br/>
and we cleaned up the library and... just got back online after 12 hours.  Very <br/>
sorry.<br/>

stripe that says Messages. That will display for you 20 or 30 messages at a<br/>
time. They used to come with no ads but I think Yahoo has figured out how to<br/>
sprinkle them down the page but it&#39;s less annoying than clicking on<br/>
individual messages to find the one you want.<br/>
<br/>
And, if you know which message you last checked, you can go right to it with<br/>
the &quot;Msg #&quot; option in the green stripe beneath &quot;Expand Messages&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141019989">I hadn&#39;t thought of expanding the messages, but I was using <br/>
the &quot;message number&quot; and also, picking only Sandra Dodd&#39;s posts, and <br/>
also, whenever I saw her name, I looked to see how many KB the post <br/>
was. Didn&#39;t look at anything under about 4KB, because it was a bit <br/>
longer of a post...maybe that was my mistake. Started my search at <br/>
the end of April (when I started lurking here/posting here regularly) <br/>
and pretty much clicked on anything that looked promising.<br/>
<br/>
still...lots of time spent. I&#39;ll try the expanded messages...maybe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-930396807">I don&#39;t think this is the one I was thinking about, but if it&#39;s the one the <br/>
original searcher was looking for, GOOD!  <br/>
<br/>
I thought there had been a response to advantages to late reading, and I <br/>
wrote that Holly learned her lines better because she couldn&#39;t read.  Other were <br/>
depending on the script, but Holly couldn&#39;t, so she learned it by having it <br/>
read to her, and by paying extra sharp attention during rehearsals because she <br/>
was afraid her non-reading would put her behind.  What I discovered was that <br/>
most of the reading kids were behind because they went through so many rehearsals <br/>
with a script in hand.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If the <br/>
homeschooler&#39;s theater has it&#39;s performance set for May 10, and first <br/>
rehearsal is April 1, an unschooler can see that it would be best to know <br/>
their lines by then. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh right! That&#39;s an example I forgot to give. Holly was in a play, put on <br/>
by the city&#39;s theatre, but an all-homeschoolers&#39; session with daytime <br/>
rehearsals.<br/>
<br/>
Holly learned all her lines early, since she couldn&#39;t read and needed help.<br/>
As rehearsals went on, she learned everyone else&#39;s lines too. Since they <br/>
were leaning on being able to read from scripts during rehearsals, they <br/>
weren&#39;t memorizing their lines.<br/>
<br/>
When the performance came two of the three main characters were Holly and her <br/>
best friend, who knew their lines. The third didn&#39;t know his. A couple of <br/>
times when it didn&#39;t matter, one of them said his line, and left the response <br/>
to him. If he didn&#39;t catch it, the other of the girls would say the <br/>
response. (Most of what they were doing was exposition or dialog that wasn&#39;t <br/>
at all character specific.) If it made him mad, he didn&#39;t dare say so, <br/>
because he didn&#39;t know his part.<br/>
<br/>
But Holly was so disgusted with the others, she had no interest in the next <br/>
play they offered.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too bad. Somehow she met deadlines TOO well?<br/>

to model after, not familiar with most of them, so other than that, I <br/>
would say:<br/>
<br/>
Searching for local unschoolers/groups<br/>
<br/>
Newbies/getting started<br/>
<br/>
Alternative parenting discussions(for things that are child-led like <br/>
unschooling, but not about unschooling, like freedom of tv, eating <br/>
and food, discipline/spanking, attachment parenting)<br/>
<br/>
Problem and doubts, a help board<br/>
<br/>
Christian unschooling(for those who are sensitive and not easily <br/>
assured by the the disclaimers that this list is not referring to <br/>
them, who unschool in the freedom of christ and not for some <br/>
political agenda)<br/>
<br/>
Political issues<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling in the media<br/>
<br/>
Documentation and assessment for those who need help reporting what <br/>
they do as educational<br/>
<br/>
even a debate list would be great, so i can refer people who know <br/>
nothing about unschooling but love telling me why it doesn&#39;t work and <br/>
can&#39;t work for most kids<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181429291"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  What are *you* looking for in an unschooling list?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another list I am on is actually broken down into two lists, one for<br/>
discussion of strictly homeschooling topics, and the other for<br/>
general discussion.  It works, but the strictly homeschooling one is<br/>
very dry.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this list could be separated like that.  It seems one<br/>
minute the thread IS about unschooling, then the next minute it is<br/>
off on a tangent that has very little to do with unschooling, but is<br/>
none-the-less an intriguing conversation.  And since unschooling<br/>
incorporates parenting issues, not just schooling issues, it would be<br/>
hard to make the distinction between what is and what isn&#39;t.  (Okay,<br/>
the whole doable thread may have been pretty obvious... ;)<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy the general conversational threads, but I recognize they<br/>
clutter up the list for people who are new to the group, or people<br/>
who just don&#39;t have the time to spend reading all the conversation to<br/>
get a little about unschooling.  But maybe somehow (?) they could be<br/>
separated without losing the momentum?<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to hearing other ideas!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I LOVE this is what we did today posts. :)  I would subscribe to a <br/>
list like that too.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what we did today.  <br/>
<br/>
This was a special day for my daughter.  She had been looking forward <br/>
to this day for awhile--a day where she and I go to the mall together <br/>
for a shopping spree with her birthday money.  We stopped at burger <br/>
king on the way and got an odor-rama card (scratch and sniff card to <br/>
use during the movie where the rugrats meet the wild thornberries).  <br/>
Then we went to the 11:15 movie, spent all afternoon shopping, went <br/>
to the 4:45 Bruce Almighty movie, stopped at taco bell and then came <br/>
home.  Right before the 4:45 movie we put all our shopping bags in <br/>
the HOT car.  When we got back in the car after taco bell, the bath <br/>
and body works bag was overflowing with PURPLE BUBBLES!  The heat had <br/>
caused the lid of the grape foam soap to pop off.  We went back into <br/>
the mall with our bubbly bag (dropping purple bubbles along the way), <br/>
showed them our bag, and they gave us a new purple foam soap. :)  <br/>
<br/>
Throughout our day we talked about materialism, calculated percents-<br/>
off, talked about saving money for good sales, and talked about <br/>
chemcial reactions.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, back at home, my husband spent much of his day in the <br/>
swimming pool with the boys.  He was so excited when we got home to <br/>
report that our 4 year old is jumping in on his own and swimming <br/>
underwater to him and that our 6 year old is going down the slide and <br/>
swimming to the ladder himself.  They had a blast today. <br/>
<br/>
On the way to and from the mall (45 minute drive) dd and I listened <br/>
to Harry Potter on audio tape.  <br/>
<br/>
When we got home, I talked to the boys about their day, took a <br/>
shower, rested on my bed and read a little bit of a book that I&#39;m <br/>
reading, and got on the computer for a few minutes.  My six year old, <br/>
who isn&#39;t reading yet and is very into Thomas the tank engine and <br/>
computer games, brought me some pieces of paper.  He said that they <br/>
were tickets and wanted to know if I would like to &quot;buy&quot; one.  He had <br/>
written Thomas on each one of them.  I bought a ticket from him with <br/>
pretend money. :) Then I took him up to bed and read a Rokenbok flyer <br/>
to him.  He has decided that he wants to start buying Rokenbok stuff <br/>
and is very excited about his birthday so that he can get money to <br/>
buy the stuff with.  He has talked his little brother into combining <br/>
their birthday money so that they can buy it quicker. After I read <br/>
the flyer to him (descriptions, testimonials, prices, etc.), he fell <br/>
asleep with his rokenbok flyer as he has done every night for the <br/>
last week. :)  I tucked my 4 year old in, and then went into my <br/>
daugher&#39;s room for a Yu-gi-oh match.  We have recently started <br/>
playing the game and to our delight, found a card store only 1/2 an <br/>
hour from us that is having a tournament on Saturday!  She wants to <br/>
enter the tournament and we want to practice and try to learn all the <br/>
rules we need to know by then.  (She&#39;s trying to talk me into <br/>
entering too!)  There are still some things we haven&#39;t done yet, like <br/>
learn how to do polymerization and the 15-card side decks.  We were <br/>
up playing yu-gi-oh until almost 1:00!  I think we&#39;ll sleep in <br/>
tomorrow.</div>

<br/>
At first it&#39;s not that simple and later it is.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of something you can do really well, without thinking about it, <br/>
that others can&#39;t manage to fumble through, maybe it&#39;s like that.  Maybe <br/>
you&#39;re a diver?  Maybe you knit?  Maybe you can decorate cakes?  (I can do none of <br/>
that, not even a little.)<br/>
<br/>
Kirby can use a Nintendo remote control like I can play recorder--just think <br/>
what you want to do, and its happening without conscious thought about which <br/>
fingers are where at all.<br/>
<br/>
So first unschooling is a little awkward and seems wrong and unnatural.  And <br/>
what makes the transition happen, I think, is the mom changing her perspective <br/>
and the filter through which she&#39;s seeing &quot;just living.&quot;  One day you&#39;ll see <br/>
something glorious that you wouldn&#39;t have noticed before.  And once you see <br/>
it, you&#39;ll be eagerly hoping to see another wonderful sparkly thing like that, <br/>
and you will.    I can&#39;t tell you what the thing will be.  Then you would be <br/>
looking for that, instead of being open to whatever magic your kids will show <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how new you are to the list.  If not TOO new, some or all of <br/>
this might be repetitive, but here are some collections of ideas, and various <br/>
people&#39;s accounts of &quot;typical days&quot;--<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;However, since I&#39;m trying to understand what unschoolers (moms and kids)<br/>
do<br/>
all day, (It seems like you&#39;re saying, &quot;Just live.&quot; It can&#39;t be that<br/>
simple, can it?) I&#39;d love to see more &quot;this is what we did today&quot;<br/>
posts.&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m up and it&#39;s late and I&#39;m not sleepy so I&#39;ll see if I can help.<br/>
<br/>
Frst thing this morning we discovered that Sierra lost her tooth during the<br/>
night so I sent her off to find it while I got out of bed. She found the<br/>
tooth and I greeted the rest of the household. Let the dog outside and hosed<br/>
poop and cleaned up fallen mangoes while Sierra and Alyssa watched tv and<br/>
Joseph played in his room. Then Sierra hit the computer and Joseph joined<br/>
her to watch. I was getting ready to go out and have no idea what they<br/>
played but it sounded like fun. Alyssa played in her room, watched tv,<br/>
visited with my mom and visited with me. Then one by one they decided to eat<br/>
so I fixed breakfast and that went on for about 30 minutes. Then I cleaned<br/>
up all the while talking to the kids while they ate and we had on tv also.<br/>
It was Blues Clues and Scooby. Joseph and Sierra played YuGiOh cards in the<br/>
playroom with a twist. They set up a huge gameboard with the foam play<br/>
squares we have complete with barricades and such that they incorporated<br/>
into the game. It was too complicated for me to follow but they played that<br/>
for about an hour. All the while Alyssa was all over the house playing with<br/>
the dog, her toys and me. When Joseph and Sierra had enough, they cleaned up<br/>
and Alyssa came out to help as she wanted the tent up in the playroom.<br/>
Joseph went back in his room on the computer and I set up the tent for<br/>
Alyssa. Sierra asked her if she could play in there so they both took in<br/>
their Polly Pocket dolls, some stuffed animals and plastic links. (the links<br/>
were rain) About 20 minutes later Joseph came out and asked if he could play<br/>
too. Good thing it&#39;s a big tent.<br/>
<br/>
They played in there for quite awhile. When they were done we all helped to<br/>
clean it up. I left the house to take Tara&#39;s car for window tinting and came<br/>
home with my husband. Joe played with all three of them for awhile, ate<br/>
something and left again. They watched some tv and ran around the house<br/>
playing hide and seek. It&#39;s Alyssa&#39;s new favorite game and Joseph and Sierra<br/>
have been very obliging. Then they played something where Alyssa was a leach<br/>
and she chased them and would stick to them and suck out all their blood!!!!<br/>
That was Joseph&#39;s idea. Joseph ate and of course Alyssa is snacking the<br/>
whole day anyway.  Joseph and Sierra went through all their coloring and<br/>
puzzle books and were working in them. Alyssa joined in. Then they all found<br/>
tattoos that I put on them. Then they played with Furbies. Joe came home, I<br/>
left with him and Tara to go and get her car. Tara and I went grocery<br/>
shopping. She drove me around. How nice. I almost got carded at the grocery<br/>
store for beer. How nice again!!!<br/>
<br/>
Came home and fed the kids again. Joseph and Sierra went swimming. Alyssa<br/>
went to my moms and played with dolls, ate and colored. When the kids came<br/>
in from the pool, they went back outside after they dried off. Then all 3<br/>
kids ended up in Sierra&#39;s room playing I&#39;m not sure what. They eventually<br/>
ended up at the dining room table all drawing and playing with their people.<br/>
Alyssa started about 3 movies during the course of the day and never made it<br/>
through more than 10 minutes. Joseph and Sierra cleared off the dining room<br/>
as I asked them too because we have friends coming over tomorrow. Next thing<br/>
I knew it was about 11:30 where I suggested bed. Sierra and Alyssa were at<br/>
my moms and Joseph was drawing. The two girls went to bed and Joseph cleaned<br/>
his room and then started drawing again. He went to bed around midnight.<br/>
<br/>
Today was a day where the 3 little ones were very busy both alone and with<br/>
each other more so than usual. It was also a day where they were on their<br/>
own more than usual too. Most days have some reading or tv watching with me.<br/>
Or game playing or puzzles. I wasn&#39;t needed today but to just be around.<br/>
That and to put up the tent. The activities vary but our at home days<br/>
without friends are pretty much like this. It IS just living.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree. I find the message boards much more information friendly. All the<br/>
posts are separated by thread instead of a big crazy lump. The threads are<br/>
archived there so new people can go back and read entire threads. I think<br/>
it&#39;s great :-)<br/>
<br/>
And Anne Ohman&#39;s writing is exclusive to the message boards. That should be<br/>
reason enough for anyone! :-)<br/>
<br/>
But some people like lists better. Like Helen :-)<br/>
<br/>
And some people don&#39;t like message boards.<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps another question is, if you do like message boards and would use<br/>
them if x, y and z were changed, what are your x&#39;s, y&#39;s and z&#39;s? What is it<br/>
about the Unschooling.com message boards that makes them more trouble than<br/>
they&#39;re worth?<br/>
<br/>
NOW, FIRST, BEFORE YOU ANSWER! Be aware that there are more ways to navigate<br/>
the boards than the default one which, I believe, displays a list of topics<br/>
and the subtopics. To me, that&#39;s a very confusing way to use the boards.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s last day. There&#39;s new messages. There&#39;s tree view. New messages in<br/>
tree view displays posts similar to email on threaded view, except better.<br/>
The threading on the message baord is accurate and you get a little snippet<br/>
from each post to give you an idea of whether it&#39;s worth checking or not.<br/>
<br/>
So, knowing that, is one of the things holding you back a lack of clear<br/>
directions on how to use the message boards?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which ties in with the post I had on seeing differences within similarities.<br/>
(Darn, that was on the message boards. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s natural to divide thing up and categorize them. This is learning. This<br/>
is playing. Our brains want to do that so we don&#39;t have to think so hard<br/>
about what something means. We can mentally put it in it&#39;s category and<br/>
immediately know a lot about it. That&#39;s a good thing. We don&#39;t need to<br/>
relearn what we know about an animal every time we meet a new cat. We<br/>
already know lots about cats and just fill in what&#39;s unique about this cat.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes categories blind us to differences within a category and the<br/>
similarities between categories.<br/>
<br/>
So when we discuss unschooling, we try to help people reexamine their<br/>
concepts (categories) of learning and play, usually by telling people to<br/>
eliminate the categories themselves so they can start fresh. Just call<br/>
everything living and you&#39;ll start to reorganize your categories without the<br/>
divisions imposed by school.<br/>

And some people don&#39;t WANT philosophy.  It scares them.  It&#39;s too much <br/>
personal reflection and personal change.  <br/>
<br/>
They want us to tell them what they need to do so that their children will be <br/>
happy unschoolers.<br/>
But they want the advice to take the form of &quot;Buy these ten games, these five <br/>
movie, these fifteen books, and at 9:00 every morning...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the first and best piece of unschooling advice is to ignore any advice <br/>
that looks just like that.<br/>
<br/>
So WHICH games does a family new to unschooling buy?  We can&#39;t tell them.  We <br/>
can talk about what games we liked and why, but if another family bought <br/>
everything we had, duplicated our entire stash of stuff (or just inherited our <br/>
whole house, dust, stash of stuff and all) it would probably NOT be what was <br/>
useful or interesting to their kids.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re asked whether unschooling is easy or hard, it&#39;s both.  It&#39;s <br/>
