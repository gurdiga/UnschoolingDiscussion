<div id="ygrps-yiv-114054407">**I absolutely think fms has given me a chance to understand<br/>
  what&#39;s important and what&#39;s not.  It&#39;s given me (and my whole family) a new<br/>
  perspective on the ups and downs of life, and on how we want to live our<br/>
  lives. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Yes,  this is so true for us too.<br/>
<br/>
  When I was diagnosed,  I was somewhat resentful.  Sick of hurting and being tired all the time.   But truly, I didn&#39;t have a clue on how to take care of myself.  I had always exercised and such, but never really listened to my body.   Now I have that ability and am trying to teach my kids the same.<br/>
<br/>
  It has given me a new way of looking at life.  Seeing that you can make things better from something not so great.  <br/>
<br/>
  There must be quite a few of us on this list,  if I am remembering correctly.<br/>
