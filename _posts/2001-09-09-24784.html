<div id="ygrps-yiv-904620867">&lt;&lt;I only DICTATE that something get done&gt;&gt; (emphasis mine)<br/>
<br/>
Either you are poorly choosing your words or you are still unclear on the<br/>
concept of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Either the kids are free to come and go from activities and interests as<br/>
they choose (which means you are not dictating) or else the kids no longer<br/>
want to follow the agreement in which case you might be dictating (but not<br/>
unschooling).  Here in lies the dilemma.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497862966">Hello,<br/>
Did anyone see CNN&#39;s show Crossfire this past week? Michael Farris, HSLDA,<br/>
was on, and he agreed with a negative comment about unschooling. He went on<br/>
to say that appropriate homeschooling is way different and far removed from<br/>
2/3  of homeschoolers, who are the Christian based majority.(a condensed<br/>
version of his opinions stated as facts)<br/>
 I missed most of the show, but the part I saw further convinced me that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have children at the heart of his cause, and I wish he would stop<br/>
speaking on my family&#39;s behalf-well I guess not my family, because we are<br/>
not appropriate.<br/>
