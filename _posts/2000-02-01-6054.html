<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252818554">After some deliberation, the kids decided that as a part of our <br/>
&#39;homeschooling&#39;...they would teach me how to roller blade...you know get me <br/>
on those roller blades that I got for christmas.  So our second official day, <br/>
we go out to this park about a mile from our apartment, we decided this would <br/>
be better sonce they don&#39;t want me to get hurt I can start out on the grass.  <br/>
I am beginning to get the hang of  roller blading on the grass and my seven <br/>
year advances me to the sidewalk...that is when my nine year old decides that <br/>
he is tired of roller blading and wants to play on big toy.  So I give him <br/>
the car keys to change out his blades for his shoes...(can you see where this <br/>
is leading?)<br/>
<br/>
I even make a point of explaining to him that if he leaves the keys in the <br/>
trunk then we have no way to get into the car.  Then he takes off for the <br/>
car.  Meanwhile I get into the whole sidewalk thing with the roller <br/>
blades...Mostly I am concentrating on keeping my balance...there is a reason <br/>
why my mom didn&#39;t name me Grace...she had a premonition when I was <br/>
born...well after a few minutes...my older son returned with his head <br/>
drooping...he starts out,,,&quot;Mom...I...it was an accident...&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
The first thing that comes to my mind is that he is playing with me...he <br/>
likes to play practical jokes from time to time...so I smile and I <br/>
say...&quot;Scotti, your playing with me rite...?&quot;  He says no really...I left the <br/>
keys in the trunk.  And I say...No really Scotti...you have got to be playing <br/>
with my mind.&quot;...and of course he says he isn&#39;t...well...we go over to the <br/>
car...and I am hoping that he deactivated the alarm before getting into the <br/>
trunk...but he didn&#39;t...car is locked...<br/>
<br/>
My other son is like...call grandma (she live next door) or aunt didi (she <br/>
also lives next door)...and of course they went to lunch right after we went <br/>
to the part...and all my change is locked in the car as well...there is no <br/>
other choice...we gotta walk home...so there we are trekking across the <br/>
park...my youngest in roller blades...me in socks and carrying my roller <br/>
blades...not enough experience to roller blade a mile...and my older son <br/>
kinda moping along.  <br/>
<br/>
I let him know that I am not mad at him and as we walk home I ask...&quot;and so <br/>
what did we learn today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*excert from the book that we will write some day called...&quot;The Adventures of <br/>
Unschooling as told by Three Learners&quot;<br/>
