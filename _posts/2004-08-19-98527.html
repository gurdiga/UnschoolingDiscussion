Choice of home school should be an easy one<br/>

When I graduated from high school this past spring, I did not wear a <br/>
cap and<br/>
gown. Nor did I walk down a crowded aisle of an auditorium to accept <br/>
my<br/>
diploma from a school official. Instead, I came home from my last<br/>
joint-enrollment class at Georgia Perimeter College, walked up to my <br/>
mom,<br/>
and said: &quot;Hey Mom, I&#39;m done!&quot; My family later went out to eat and<br/>
celebrate.<br/>
 <br/>
I am a proud product of the nontraditional education method known as <br/>
home<br/>
schooling. Actually, calling it nontraditional is a bit of an <br/>
inaccuracy.<br/>
Before public schools were a reality, home school was pretty much the <br/>
only<br/>
way to get an education. But in today&#39;s world, it is often seen as an<br/>
anomaly.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope I don&#39;t offend anyone (although I probably will), but the <br/>
truth is,<br/>
Georgia&#39;s school system is terrible. Our SAT scores rank 50th in the <br/>
nation.<br/>
Our schools are overcrowded and understaffed, resulting in less one-<br/>
on-one<br/>
time between teachers and students. The teachers we do have are <br/>
usually<br/>
overworked, underpaid and stressed beyond reason.<br/>
 <br/>
Additionally, there&#39;s a whole mentality that comes with public <br/>
school - you<br/>
learn what the school tells you to learn, when and how they tell you <br/>
to<br/>
learn it.<br/>
 <br/>
If the school board decides the theory of evolution or the Civil War <br/>
should<br/>
not be a part of the curriculum, you may not learn about those <br/>
subjects<br/>
until college. Everyone is measured against a standard, and if you <br/>
fall<br/>
short of that standard, you&#39;re lost.<br/>
 <br/>
Once you&#39;ve taken into account school violence, budget cuts, zero <br/>
tolerance<br/>
and, of course, the teen drama (such as cliques and gossip), school <br/>
isn&#39;t<br/>
always the ideal learning center it is meant to be.<br/>
 <br/>
Home schooling is one of the fastest-growing forms of education in the<br/>
United States. In 2003 there were an estimated 1.7 million to 2.1 <br/>
million<br/>
children (grades k-12) receiving a home school education, according <br/>
to the<br/>
National Home Education Research Institute.<br/>
 <br/>
Compare that to 1973, when there were only 10,000 children home <br/>
schooling.<br/>
Georgia has a fair number of home schooled students - 31,732 as of <br/>
2002. And<br/>
contrary to popular belief, home schooled kids are not isolated, anti-<br/>
social<br/>
weirdos. We make up a large and diverse community.<br/>
 <br/>
As a home schooled student I didn&#39;t have to deal with unnecessary<br/>
distractions and I could focus on my education. I could also study <br/>
things<br/>
that interested me, so while most of my high-school-age buddies were <br/>
griping<br/>
about having to read &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (which I had read back in <br/>
middle<br/>
school after seeing the play) and having to write reports about the<br/>
Renaissance, I was happily reading &quot;Beloved&quot; and learning about the<br/>
Zapatista movement.<br/>
 <br/>
One question that I&#39;m often asked is: &quot;How do you make friends?&quot; <br/>
Apparently<br/>
there&#39;s this assumption that since I&#39;m taught at home, I never go <br/>
outside.<br/>
Nothing could be further from the truth.<br/>
 <br/>
I was always superbusy, often doing things my peers couldn&#39;t do <br/>
because of<br/>
their school schedules. I&#39;ve taught a creative writing class at Brown <br/>
Middle<br/>
School and traveled to Brazil and Germany.<br/>
 <br/>
My activities and hobbies - which include theater, dance, filmmaking <br/>
and<br/>
journalism - have ensured cool people surround me and that I usually <br/>
have<br/>
someone to hang out with on Friday nights.<br/>
 <br/>
This fall, I will continue my education at Sarah Lawrence College in <br/>
New<br/>
York. Though I&#39;m somewhat anxious, I&#39;m not intimidated. A home school<br/>
education has definitely given me the tools to succeed in college and <br/>
in<br/>
life.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks to my learning environment, I&#39;m independent, self-motivated, <br/>
focused<br/>
and ready to take on the world.<br/>
