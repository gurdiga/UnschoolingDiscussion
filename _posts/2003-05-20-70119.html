<div id="ygrps-yiv-537122383">Not a novel, but my dd has really enjoyed books published by American Girl,<br/>
the same company that makes the historic dolls.  They have books on physical<br/>
changes as you grow (The Care and Keeping of You), relationships with boys,<br/>
and all kinds of other real life things.<br/>

found some of these at our local used book store.<br/>
<br/>
She also really liked Totally Private and Personal, a book written by a<br/>
young woman about journaling, that talks a lot about feelings.<br/>

who was homeschooled, at least partly.  (I don&#39;t know all the details.)<br/>
<br/>
Lisa is 10, but started reading some of these books around age 8.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230947434">A Wrinkle in Time has a good beginning that emphasizes how alienated the<br/>
heroine feels, but it may be on the mature side for an 8 year old.<br/>
<br/>
In a lot of ways Harry Potter is about being different.  Especially<br/>
about  being different in ways that your &quot;family&quot; doesn&#39;t accept.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was 8 he really liked me to read the Star Trek the Next<br/>
Generation Star Fleet Academy books.  Those center on things like<br/>
&quot;what&#39;s it like to be the first Klingon at Star Fleet Academy?&quot; (#1) and<br/>
&quot;what&#39;s it like to be the first android, ditto ditto?&quot; (#6)  These books<br/>
are a little superficial in their plot resolution, but they still have<br/>
good stuff to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Reading science fiction seems like a good approach for anyone who feels<br/>
different.  Because when the kid outgrows unschooling conventions &lt;g&gt;<br/>
she can then start attending science fiction conventions and meet lots<br/>
of people who &quot;feel different&quot; and think different.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t seem to think of anything that specifically addresses<br/>
discovering that other people who seem different actually feel the same<br/>
on the inside.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually what I&#39;m looking for is the opposite.  Skye seems like a normal<br/>
everyday kid, but she *feels* like she&#39;s different, doesn&#39;t fit in.  And<br/>
pretty well all her friends are unschooled or relaxed homeschooled.  So I<br/>
think it&#39;s more like what most jr. high kids feel, that everyone has it more<br/>
together than they do.  At a recent birthday party (all or mostly<br/>
homeschooled kids) they got talking about Yu Gi Oh (sp?) cards, and she lied<br/>
and said she had a whole bunch of them.  She doesn&#39;t have any.  Now she&#39;s<br/>
afraid to have anyone over because they&#39;ll find out she doesn&#39;t really have<br/>
them.  I guess it&#39;s that pressure kids feel to fit in that I&#39;m looking for<br/>
books about.<br/>

Stargirl was really good with a very *different* homeschooled <br/>
character. It might be a little &quot;old&quot; in some themes, but that <br/>
depends on the child I think.<br/>

I have a suggestion for a children&#39;s book that deals with being different and that its OK,  My dd who is 8 loved it,  Its called A Bad Case of Stripes  by David Shannon.   It talks about being ourselves even if it different from the masses.   Great pictures in it!<br/>

her antlers and she is perfectly calm, smiling the whole book and <br/>
still manages to find practical uses for her differences.  I love <br/>
that little book!<br/>
