Sandra said &quot;Your WRITING isn&#39;t indicating&quot; and &quot;you haven&#39;t SHOWN or TOLD<br/>
us&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*All* that people have to discuss are what we *choose* to say. What we<br/>
*choose* (*and* not choose) to say builds a picture in someone else&#39;s head.<br/>
It&#39;s the point of communication.<br/>
<br/>
If the majority of our words and examples are about control, regardless of<br/>
how much we *say* we are free, then people can&#39;t help but build up a mental<br/>
picture of control.<br/>
<br/>
Quite often our words can convey more than the simple meanings of the words<br/>
because they are in a common cultural context. If I say &quot;I ate at McDonalds<br/>
yesterday&quot; it conveys more than &quot;I ate at Jason&#39;s yesterday.&quot; The second<br/>
doesn&#39;t convey more than I didn&#39;t eat at home. The first carries an<br/>
impression of ambience, food, price, architecture, patrons.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly if I say &quot;I ate at Mr. Donuts&quot; to an American it would carry<br/>
one impression, but a different impression to a Japanese person. (They sell<br/>
Chinese food there along with the donuts!)<br/>
<br/>
You can call house maintenance stuff chores if you like, but if the general<br/>
cultural connotation of &quot;chores&quot; is different than what you mean, then what<br/>
you&#39;ve communicated isn&#39;t what you&#39;ve intended. Happens all the time,<br/>
especially when talking to people who don&#39;t share our cultural or family<br/>
context. But it isn&#39;t the recipients who is wrong in their interpretation.<br/>
The responsibility is on the person who&#39;s trying to communicate. *If* their<br/>
purpose is communication. *If* someone finds it more important to be right<br/>
than to communicate then the rules are different, of course ;-)<br/>
