spend the rest of her life getting over it. And, I should mention that she <br/>
had NO problems in school and was a superstar student and very liked by <br/>
teachers and other kids alike. There are lessons learned there - lessons that <br/>
are REALLY learned and when something is REALLY learned it is hard, very very <br/>
hard, to unlearn it. (Read Frank Smith - The Book of Learning and Forgetting)<br/>
