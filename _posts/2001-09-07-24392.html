<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068792298">Hi Michele!<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that &quot;anti-chore&quot; post in response to someone who was questioning chores on the Continuum Concept e-list. <br/>
<br/>
here is an article for our local hs newsletter about &quot;The Continuum Concept&quot;<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
THE CONTINUUM CONCEPT<br/>
<br/>
Many families that choose to allow their children to follow their interests and control their own learning like to read books to encourage and support the &quot;unschooling&quot; philosophy. John Holt (of course!),  Nancy Griffith (The Unschoolers Handbook -gee,she lives in Roseville), and other authors have written books that deal specifically with these educational ideas.  I think it is also interesting to see how other books really support our thoughts about learning even though their focus is directed elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
One book that is super neat in many ways is The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedlof.  John Holt himself said of it, &quot;If the world could be saved by a book, this just might be the book.&quot; pretty powerful stuff hu?  To summarize, this woman-Jean, spent time with some indigenous people in South America and made observations about the way children are treated.  Her idea is that there is a way to fulfill the &quot;continuum&quot; of human biological and cultural existence, and we are not (obviously) doing it right around here!  <br/>
 <br/>
One of the most important tenants is what she calls the &quot;in-arms&quot; phase were babies, until they choose otherwise, are held and carried continually, even while asleep.  When a baby&#39;s basic human needs of touch, milk and warmth are constantly met, the idea is that they can get on with other things, like learning and growing, and they will have deep in their psyche a true knowledge that they are important, respected and loved.  <br/>
<br/>
Another equally important idea in the book is the attitude toward small people that these indigenous people have.  The key word is &quot;choose&quot; in the above paragraph.  Babies and children are treated just as any other person in that they can decide what is best for them and it is understood that each child will choose socially acceptable behaviors because it is their instinct to do so.  It is also understood that a person&#39;s uniqueness will be reflected in their choices (this is sounding more like homeschooling...!).  What is interesting is that for these people, childcare is a non-activity.  Their life is not &quot;child-centered&quot;.  The children are not surrounded by adults who worry about their development and learning--who plan their activities based on the latest research.  Instead, the children have adults around them that concern themselves with their interests and their adult roles in the community. Children are not given &quot;help&quot; they didn&#39;t ask for, which implies a lack of trust and they are not coddled, but respected.<br/>
 <br/>
I could keep writing forever, but reading the book is better.  Also, on the web page, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.continuum-concept.org/">http://www.continuum-concept.org/</a> you can click on &quot;Understanding the Concept&quot; and other articles. This book describes &quot;unschooling&quot; at it&#39;s finest-- the result of fulfilling the &quot;continuum&quot; are human beings as they are meant to be;  relaxed, calm, happy, intelligent and helping the community in ways reflecting their own talents.  This is what we want for our children.  <br/>
