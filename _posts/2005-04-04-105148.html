I  get your point, but have to correct one little thing - people don&#39;t <br/>
count  as unemployed UNLESS they are actively seeking work. Parents who <br/>
choose  stay home with their kids don&#39;t count as unemployed - they don&#39;t <br/>
hurt the  employment statistics at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804826199">They do it pretty much the same way we do. When computing the <br/>
unemployment rate, the numerator counts only those who: (1) are not <br/>
working (2) currently available for work, and (3) are actively taking <br/>
steps to seek work. The denominator is the entire labor force which <br/>
includes (1) the unemployed as defined in the numerator and (2) people <br/>
who are working.<br/>
<br/>
So - if you have a population of 200 people and 75 of those are <br/>
stay-at-home parents (by choice) and 75 others are in institutions such <br/>
as schools, hospitals or prisons or retired or for some reason have <br/>
given up looking for work, then the labor force is composed of only the <br/>
other 50 people. If, of those 50, 45 are working and 5 are not working, <br/>
but are available and actively seeking work, then the unemployment rate <br/>
is 5/50 or .10 or 10 percent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355204288">You are absolutely right.  The denominator is made of those people who<br/>
are &quot;economically active&quot;.  Which isn&#39;t a small point, really, it<br/>
blows my whole rant. <br/>
<br/>
Sigh, well, anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s down to GDP?  The more women working the greater the tax<br/>
base?  And the fewer pensioners later on who have to be fully funded<br/>
by the government? <br/>

people into the labor force.<br/>
<br/>
And - GDP gets bonus points when a stay-at-home mom goes into the <br/>
workforce. Not only does GDP count what she produces at work, but now <br/>
the &quot;professional&quot; childcare (that she used to do &quot;for free&quot;) also gets <br/>
counted in GDP.<br/>

When I was a teenager and Ms. Magazine was new and I bought my t-shirts from <br/>
their pages, I thought the most noble thing I could do would be to get a great <br/>
job and hire other women to clean my house and take care of my kids so we&#39;d <br/>
ALL have jobs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading Escape from Childhood by John Holt, and some of the basis for his <br/>
assertions in one section is purely women&#39;s-movement political spin on <br/>
medieval history.  Having ever since then been more interested in medieval history <br/>
than any of the other of it, and then getting this through-the-knothole view of <br/>
the 70&#39;s through this John Holt book I&#39;d never read, I&#39;m embarrassed for what <br/>
passed for &quot;research&quot; in those days (as people in the future will probably be <br/>
embarrassed on bahalf of ours).  He says over and OVER and over and over (I&#39;m <br/>
going to count, but it passed six) that the modern family was &quot;invented,&quot; but <br/>
rather than blaming the post-WWII return to the homes and all the new suburbs <br/>
which would seem justifiable to me, he was citing women&#39;s &quot;historians&quot; <br/>
talking about when, whether and why there could&#39;ve been family units over the past <br/>
few hundred years in Europe, mostly.   In the 70&#39;s, they&#39;d&#39;ve been reading <br/>
stuff collected earlier.  And it wasn&#39;t until the 1980&#39;s that social history <br/>
really got its stride and GOOD evidence started being collected in sufficient <br/>
quantities that comparisons could be made.    <br/>
<br/>
There are other stories in the book I&#39;m really glad he found, but that lame <br/>
invention of the family&quot; was starting to make me twitch, partly because I <br/>
remember those days and how the women&#39;s movement would grasp at ANYthing that <br/>
justified going to work (which many women had been having to do all along anyway, <br/>
and the equal pay for equal work business was crucially important), and that <br/>
justified their not having children at all, or having children they didn&#39;t get <br/>
too attached to.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember their spin on the &quot;infants need to bond&quot; research.  Yes, they <br/>
said, but it doesn&#39;t have to be with their mother, it can be with any adult.<br/>
<br/>
I think back on that now with deepest sorrow for a badillion children who <br/>
might&#39;ve bonded with the first few babysitters or daycare workers or elderly <br/>
relatives, and then the next one, and the next one, and then gave up from the <br/>
grief of instability of relationships.  They&#39;re all around me, those adults.<br/>

<br/>
Holt had this idea that the modern family was a place where children were<br/>
more like pets and were not taken seriously.   They were inconvenient<br/>
little things that parents had to protected and shelter until they were<br/>
big enough to leave home.  They couldn&#39;t really do much, didn&#39;t know<br/>
much, had to be supervised, etc.  Holt believed that this view of<br/>
children wasn&#39;t always the view of children.  Other era&#39;s saw children as<br/>
capable and, though it wasn&#39;t necessarily good for kids and rarely of the<br/>
child&#39;s choosing, kids were taken seriously, given serious jobs and had<br/>
big responsibilities at a young age.   <br/>
<br/>
He compared the attitudes that children needed to be taken care of with<br/>
the earlier attitudes that women needed to be taken care of and he did so<br/>
for shock value.  He thought in the new age of awareness about women&#39;s<br/>
issues he could jolt people into thinking about children&#39;s issues in the<br/>
same way.   I also think he sort of wanted to seem cool and hip to those<br/>
liberated women he was exchanging letters with. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t know diddles about medieval history or family units of Europe<br/>
hundreds of years ago.  I just think his hope was to startle people into<br/>
new thinking about the way parents and schools were treating kids in the<br/>
sixties and seventies when he was spending lots of time looking at kids<br/>
and schools.  <br/>
<br/>
I think, if Holt had had a little more time on the planet, he would have<br/>
something new to say about &quot;Escape from Childhood.&quot;  He had that kind of<br/>
mind made him work a thing over and over and I think he would have<br/>
changed some of his ideas over time and probably did.  I wish we could<br/>
have asked him.&lt;g&gt;      <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a letter Holt wrote to his editor at Dutton when he first started<br/>
working on Escape from Childhood.  It doesn&#39;t go into the details of the<br/>
book but gives a little glimpse of the writer.  In the letter he&#39;s not<br/>
sure what the title of his new book will be but he&#39;s considering Out of<br/>
the Prison of Childhood and Escape from the Prison of Childhood.   The<br/>
letter appears in  &quot;A Life Worth Living, Selected Letters of John Holt&quot; <br/>
and I can send you a copy of the letter, Sandra, if you don&#39;t have that<br/>
book.  It&#39;s in my drafts folder, I think.  Might be fun for you to see<br/>
his thoughts as he started the book you&#39;re reading now these thirty two<br/>
years later.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
