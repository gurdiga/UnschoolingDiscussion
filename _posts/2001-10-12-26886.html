&gt; Thanks Karri,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got this page and I understand? most of the procedure but I <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t find how much the seller is charged to use the service. Is it <br/>
&gt; a flat fee? Are you only charged if the item sells? <br/>
&gt; Thanks, Leslie<br/>
<br/>

When I wanted to learn about e-bay, here is what I did.<br/>
I took one small item that was not important and used it as a test sale. <br/>
Walking through the process with something that was pretty<br/>
inconsequential was very helpful.<br/>
If I remember correctly, there was a listing fee for each item in the<br/>
neighborhood of 25 cents.  There were other fees and you will see what<br/>
they are as you walk through the process.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
<br/>
