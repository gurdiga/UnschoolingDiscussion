 </span></blockquote>Well if they&#39;re real young I&#39;d call it an invitation to chaos. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re older I&#39;d call it part of a rich environment.<br/>
<br/>
But an even more important part is you and your attitude towards life and<br/>
learning. If you embrace life, if you&#39;re interested in learning new things,<br/>
if you&#39;re steering new things through their lives so they have opportunities<br/>
to develop new interests, if you respect, encourage and facilitate their<br/>
explorations as important regardless of whether they bear any resemblance to<br/>
academics, then I&#39;d call that unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376090651">Sounds like my house, we have 2 book shelves and a kinda linnen closet full <br/>
of art supplies, various books we&#39;ve aquired over the years, board games, <br/>
construction toys, binoculars, jars, etc etc etc. We also have a toy room <br/>
full of ... well ... toys, and everything else that isn&#39;t a &quot;toy&quot;. I think of <br/>
it as having kids. I&#39;m sure there are non-homeschooling families with his <br/>
setup. I think it&#39;s what you do with it, or don&#39;t do with it is more like it. <br/>
Our &quot;stuff closet&quot; is always a disaster because the children come and go in <br/>
and out of it as they please. If you have a clean stuff closet, I&#39;d probably <br/>
say it&#39;s not unschooling, unless of course your kids just aren&#39;t in a stuff <br/>
closet phase, or you or your kids are neat freaks (not that there&#39;s anything <br/>
wrong with being a neat freak. If you are send a pinch of it my way). <br/>
<br/>
Awaiting the responses to this thread.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; &quot;Hey, thanks for the writing box suggestion, but we don&#39;t <br/>
 believe in forced learning. BTW, the kids don&#39;t use a curriculum, we do <br/>
 what&#39;s called unschooling or child-led learning, we let them pick and choose <br/>
 freely from all the world and this just doesn&#39;t fit our ideal. How about I <br/>
 give you a book on unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
I would however, give her some literature to read about homeschooling and <br/>
unschooling. But I wouldn&#39;t try to explain anything in detail.<br/>
The reason is that it probaby won&#39;t drastically change her mind, it may set <br/>
off warning bells for her that you&#39;re being neglectful in some way and cause <br/>
even more problems at this point.<br/>
She may come around. But some people never do get it. My Grandmother is one. <br/>
Every year I think she&#39;s secretly (and sometimes not so secretly) hoping my <br/>
kids will end up in school. I&#39;ve explained to her that we believe by <br/>
homeschooling our children they can learn at their own pace, but a couple <br/>
days ago I get this handwritten letter listing all of MY responsiblities. <br/>
They are well off financially and she was offering to pay for a tutor to <br/>
&quot;bring them up to grade level&quot; by next fall. She feels that after listing all <br/>
my responsibilites, I just have too much to deal with. <br/>
Initially I was appalled. How does she know if they are at &quot;grade level&quot; or <br/>
not anyway?<br/>
But it is totally pointless to sit down and explain unschooling to her.<br/>
She will just get more worried and stressed out.<br/>
Often the best approach with these type of relatives is to be vague.<br/>
&quot;Well, they&#39;re doing really well right now, they can always go to school if <br/>
this doesn&#39;t work out&quot;  or saying that you prefer to teach them with your own <br/>
curriculum (which is basically true) can be better than telling them you <br/>
don&#39;t do school.<br/>
It will freak her out and make your life harder possibly.<br/>
Be vague is my advice. Accept her gift of cards, it&#39;s not invasive....but <br/>
leave them sitting and let your kids decide if they&#39;ll ever touch them or not.<br/>
If they never look at the cards and she wonders about it, you can just say <br/>
that they&#39;re doing other projects they like better right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287654526">I totally agree with you Ren, being vague with my Mom (and others) <br/>
works best for us.  This is the conclusion I&#39;ve come to after years <br/>
of trying to explain and get my family to read more about it... it <br/>
helps that we&#39;ve moved over a couple thousand miles away though &lt;G&gt; <br/>
My stand-by response to most people is something like:  &quot;Oh the <br/>
internet has such a ton of information on homeschooling now, and you <br/>
can buy any number of curriculums (I neglect to say we haven&#39;t <br/>
purchased one), there are books that tell you what your kids need to <br/>
know at each grade level (I leave out the fact that I don&#39;t use them <br/>
for that purpose), and I mostly put it together myself (stretching it <br/>
there, the kids really are the ones that do that!).  <br/>
&quot;Bring them up to grade level&quot;.... yikes, that would get my dander <br/>
up...  I forget what grade they&#39;re supposed to be in! <br/>

&gt; She may come around. But some people never do get it. My <br/>
Grandmother is one. <br/>
&gt; Every year I think she&#39;s secretly (and sometimes not so secretly) <br/>
hoping my <br/>
&gt; kids will end up in school. I&#39;ve explained to her that we believe <br/>
by <br/>
&gt; homeschooling our children they can learn at their own pace, but a <br/>
couple <br/>
&gt; days ago I get this handwritten letter listing all of MY <br/>
responsiblities. <br/>
&gt; They are well off financially and she was offering to pay for a <br/>
tutor to <br/>
&gt; &quot;bring them up to grade level&quot; by next fall. She feels that after <br/>
listing all <br/>
&gt; my responsibilites, I just have too much to deal with. <br/>
&gt; Initially I was appalled. How does she know if they are at &quot;grade <br/>
level&quot; or <br/>
&gt; not anyway?<br/>
&gt; But it is totally pointless to sit down and explain unschooling to <br/>
her.<br/>
&gt; She will just get more worried and stressed out.<br/>
&gt; Often the best approach with these type of relatives is to be vague.<br/>

Same here!! 12 y.o. ds and I sat down and figured it out the other day <br/>
because we couldn&#39;t remember. We had to go forward from the one year he spent <br/>
in Kindergarten because I honestly couldn&#39;t tell him, and he wanted to know.<br/>
