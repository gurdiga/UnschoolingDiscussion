<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531930083">Greetings.  My family and I are headed to New Mexico in two weeks.  We&#39;ll be staying in Chimayo and we plan to hit Bandelier and Santa Fe.  We have been researching fun things to do in the area and would love to hear from anyone who has come upon something they loved.  My kids are 9 and 7.<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
