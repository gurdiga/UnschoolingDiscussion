<div id="ygrps-yiv-114837191">Hi, I&#39;m new to this list so thought I would lurk for a while, but found this <br/>
note by Susan in my first digest, and couldn&#39;t resist commenting :)  Intro <br/>
first, though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been unschooling 10 years this month; took my older two kids out of <br/>
school 2/3 of the way through 5th grade when the older was suicidally <br/>
depressed due to school experiences and the younger, though he had skipped <br/>
two years of school, was still grossly unchallenged.  I knew no other hsers <br/>
but one family who did school at home, which I didn&#39;t feel would work in our <br/>
situation, but figured a tiny bit of structure would be needed.  However, my <br/>
oldest son&#39;s intense need to deschool led directly to unschooling, and we <br/>
never looked back.<br/>
<br/>
The boys are now very nearly 21 (2 weeks) and 18.  The elder is in the Army, <br/>
has been since before he turned 18, and is doing very well.  Getting him in <br/>
the Army was a challenge, as our Clonlara diploma was not recognized as <br/>
valid.  But we got past that hurdle, then 6 weeks after Chris joined, my dh <br/>
retired from the Army, and we left TX to move onto our land in MI, where we <br/>
now have a small farm.  The younger son left home a few weeks after his 18th <br/>
birthday to move *back* to TX :) where he&#39;s employed by an Internet ecommerce <br/>
company, and making a very nice salary along with 80 hour workweeks.  <br/>
Personally, I hope he quits and finds something less stressful, but that&#39;s <br/>
what he wants for now :)<br/>
 <br/>
My youngest child is a girl, 8 going on 18, who is exceptionally sensitive <br/>
and strongwilled, so life is never dull.  At the moment she&#39;s minding the <br/>
batch of 28 baby chicks we picked up this morning.  We still unschool, in the <br/>
manner I&#39;ve been told is nowadays called &#39;radical unschooling&#39;, meaning, I&#39;m <br/>
told, folks who don&#39;t use unit studies.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the comment.  Susan wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; imo the fact that you wanted to learn piano and the opportunity to acquire <br/>
this skill was not afforded to you would say to me that you were not <br/>
unschooled because your parents did not respect your desires and did not <br/>
follow your lead.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I strongly disagree with this :)  Unschooling, IMO, is indeed about following <br/>
the child&#39;s lead--I like to refer to it as child-led learning.  However, <br/>
parents are not obligated to allow the child to lead anywhere she wants!  I <br/>
don&#39;t think you&#39;d let your child lead you to give her lessons in arson, if <br/>
she were interested in burning things, would you? :)  There are always limits <br/>
in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
If my daughter had her way, we&#39;d provide gymnastics, swimming, horseback <br/>
riding, piano lessons, and a host of other enriching activities.  I would <br/>
love to give her ample opportunity for each and every one of these <br/>
activities, but there&#39;s a few problems.  One, there&#39;s simply not enough time <br/>
to do all these things; Two, we don&#39;t have the money; and Three, she is not <br/>
real serious about any of the ones she&#39;s tried so far.<br/>
<br/>
Where I can work out lessons that I feel are of the quality that provides <br/>
learning with respect, for a reasonable amount of money or labor (I have <br/>
bartered my labor for her lessons with friends), I give my daughter chances <br/>
to try different activities.  But when she doesn&#39;t follow through on her end <br/>
of the deal--for example, wearing the safety equipment needed, or placing her <br/>
hands on the keys like her teachers says--then it&#39;s time to rethink the <br/>
lessons.  Periodically we&#39;ll give her a new chance to try if she&#39;s still <br/>
interested, and if she&#39;s willing to be fully cooperative with the <br/>
restrictions inherent in the situation, then lessons will continue as long as <br/>
she is cooperative and we can work out any other problems.  But I&#39;m under no <br/>
obligation to provide opportunities to someone who won&#39;t appreciate and make <br/>
the most of them.<br/>
<br/>
If my child had a burning *need* to do something--for example, a child who is <br/>
a serious competitive swimmer, or who finds that music, or animals, or <br/>
whatever, is her life, then I would move heaven and earth to provide that <br/>
opportunity.  But most kids are just experimenting, which is fine, if done <br/>
with the understanding that it not take over the family&#39;s time and income.<br/>
<br/>
Well, so much for my plan to lurk :)<br/>

hear more about how you got past this hurdle. I&#39;m gathering info on<br/>
college/career stuff and I&#39;d love to hear the details.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
