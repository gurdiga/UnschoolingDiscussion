<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078739596">**the closest I could  come to were the families where the mother is<br/>
calmly telling <br/>
her child  why he/she shouldn&#39;t hit mommy ---but that is not what<br/>
unschooling is  <br/>
about, correct? And I&#39;m not talking about unschooling in an academic <br/>
way but within <br/>
the family as a whole.**<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is strictly speaking not doing school. The way it&#39;s<br/>
done is by trusting <br/>
kids instincts about what interests them and helping them explore<br/>
(and expand) their <br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
The idea you&#39;re trying to express is expanding the unschooling<br/>
philosophy of <br/>
trusting kids into parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s called respectful parenting. Sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
called mindful parenting. It <br/>
doesn&#39;t have an official name unfortunately! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, yes, it goes well beyond saying &quot;This is why you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t hit mommy ...&quot; ;-<br/>
)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s treating kids the way fellow human being appreciate being<br/>
treated. It&#39;s helping <br/>
them get what they want. It&#39;s being their partner as they explore<br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
**I was wondering what type, if any, limits  are there ---do y&#39;all<br/>
set? What do you not <br/>
approve of? Perhaps there is  nothing and I am still not seeing<br/>
everything in the <br/>
same way.**<br/>
<br/>
With traditional parenting parents and children are adversaries.<br/>
Parents decide what <br/>
the child must and must not do.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Good&quot; (traditional) parents are reasonable in their<br/>
expectations. But the relationship <br/>
is about the parents holding all the power and letting the kids do<br/>
what the parents <br/>
approve of.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parenting is about being a child&#39;s partner rather than<br/>
their adversary. It&#39;s <br/>
about helping them get what they want rather than finding techniques<br/>
to make them <br/>
do what the parent wants.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately that explanation works better after someone understands<br/>
mindful <br/>
parenting because after reading that explanation some people will ask<br/>
&quot;So you&#39;re <br/>
saying that if your child wanted to play in traffic you&#39;d let<br/>
them?!&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
First kids may want to play but they *also* want to be safe and they<br/>
trust us to <br/>
keep them safe. So we&#39;d help them play *and* be safe. That could<br/>
mean distraction <br/>
to something even better. Saying &quot;The cars will hurt you in the<br/>
street. Hey, let&#39;s go <br/>
do the slide.&quot; If they&#39;re very young and can&#39;t stay away<br/>
from the street then it&#39;s best <br/>
to avoid places like that until they are able to understand.<br/>
<br/>
(It&#39;s much easier to explain with real examples because the<br/>
answer will come from <br/>
why a child wants to do something rather than what they want to do.)<br/>
<br/>
So there isn&#39;t a &quot;let&quot;. There&#39;s helping a child get<br/>
what they really want (and avoid <br/>
what they don&#39;t want and perhaps don&#39;t understand.)<br/>
<br/>
Second, sometimes kids do want something that we *think* will be<br/>
unsafe: lots of <br/>
sweets, lots of TV, video games, horror movies, violent video games,<br/>
movies with <br/>
adult content.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of words have been written about trusting kids with food<br/>
and tv and <br/>
video games! (Sandra has some collected at her website<br/>
(http://sandradodd.com/<br/>
unschooling) Basically the idea is to help kids be happy :-)<br/>
<br/>
A brief summary of the TV debate is that if kids are given the<br/>
freedom to watch as <br/>
much as they want whenever they want they will turn it off when<br/>
they&#39;re done.<br/>
<br/>
(There are a bunch of caveats: *If* there are better options for<br/>
them. (In other words <br/>
as long as TV isn&#39;t the least boring option. They need to have<br/>
choices that *they* <br/>
find interesting.) *If* their TV viewing hasn&#39;t been controlled<br/>
before. *If* they don&#39;t <br/>
fear that limits will be placed on how much they can watch. *If* they<br/>
aren&#39;t <br/>
prepubescent ;-) (My daughter watched a *lot* of TV when she was 10<br/>
and 11. But I <br/>
trusted her and whatever she needed she got out of it and moved onto<br/>
other <br/>
interests.)<br/>
<br/>
A more illustrative example might be a child who wants to watch a<br/>
horror movie. How <br/>
do you help them get that when you fear they may have nightmares or<br/>
it might be <br/>
too scary? Do you just &quot;let them&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
No. Kids want to be happy so we *help* them. And the first best way<br/>
is by <br/>
understanding and knowing them. My daughter liked fantasy action<br/>
movies but she <br/>
didn&#39;t like moving skeletons. So before seeing a movie I&#39;d<br/>
check with the Screen It! <br/>
(http://www.screenit.com) website. (The front page makes it look like<br/>
you have to <br/>
pay but you can go right in. Becoming a member just gets it the site<br/>
ad free and <br/>
some other extras.) They give good details of what a movie contains<br/>
that might <br/>
bother a child. I&#39;d summarize the things that might bother her<br/>
and if she still wanted <br/>
to see it I&#39;d memorize where in the movie it was and remind her<br/>
to close her eyes <br/>
when we got to that point.<br/>
<br/>
If a child has nightmares, there&#39;s lots of other options than<br/>
watching a scary movie <br/>
straight through right before bed! So we empower them :-) Let them<br/>
know they can <br/>
watch it during the day, leave and go do something else, stop the<br/>
movie, fast <br/>
forward, pause and talk about it, watch the &quot;making of&quot; to<br/>
see how the special <br/>
effects are done.<br/>
<br/>
We empower kids by helping them figure out how to have control over<br/>
the things that <br/>
might bother them.<br/>
<br/>
That often doesn&#39;t make sense to people who have controlled their<br/>
kids because <br/>
they &quot;know&quot; their kids aren&#39;t reasonable. They might say<br/>
&quot;No, you can&#39;t see it. The <br/>
movie has zombies in it and you know you know zombies give you<br/>
nightmares.&quot; And <br/>
a controlled child might fight to watch the movie, convincing the<br/>
parent that the child <br/>
has no common sense so the parent obviously must make decisions for<br/>
the child.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not that the child is unreasonable but that the child<br/>
wants to be able to <br/>
choose for themselves. If they&#39;re used to fighting for the right<br/>
to choose, they&#39;ll fight <br/>
even for things they don&#39;t entirely want ;-) They just want the<br/>
power to decide for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
When kids&#39; worlds are divided between what they&#39;re allowed to<br/>
do and what they <br/>
aren&#39;t allowed to do, they will want to do what they aren&#39;t<br/>
allowed. (Partly it&#39;s wanting <br/>
to prove that they can handle what someone thinks they can&#39;t.<br/>
Partly it&#39;s wanting <br/>
the ability to make their own choices.)<br/>
<br/>
But when kids&#39; worlds are divided between what they want to do<br/>
and what they don&#39;t <br/>
want to do there isn&#39;t any reason for them to choose what they<br/>
don&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the &quot;short&quot; version, anyway ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805569834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Anyway, yes, it goes well beyond saying &quot;This is why you<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t hit mommy ...&quot; ;-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So I&#39;m wondering, what would you say to a child who is hitting mommy?<br/>
  If you tell him firmly to stop and he says no and continues anyway?   <br/>
<br/>
I ask, because I can give a real life recent example.  I&#39;ll tell what<br/>
I did, but I wonder if others would handle it differently. <br/>
<br/>
We were swimming at a friend&#39;s house.  Luke (who&#39;s 6) was in a big<br/>
inter-tube type thing that he was filling up with water.  He was<br/>
handing me the plastic bucket, and I was filling it up with water and<br/>
handing it to him.  Matt (who&#39;s 8)had been playing with us but got<br/>
sick of it and wanted to get out of the pool.  Luke heard him ask me<br/>
to get out of the pool with him and got upset and said in a pleading<br/>
kind of voice, &quot;No, don&#39;t get out of the pool, I want you to stay here<br/>
with me&quot;.  So I had one boy begging me to stay in with him and one boy<br/>
begging me to get out with him.  So I told Matt that I wanted to stay<br/>
in with Luke for awhile, but that he could wrap up in a towel and sit<br/>
on the deck and talk with us.  Or he could change into dry clothes and<br/>
come back down and sit on the deck and be with us.   Or he could go<br/>
into the house, where his sister and friend were, and watch tv, play<br/>
with toys or video games, get a snack and drink, etc.  Or I would call<br/>
his dad, who wouldn&#39;t mind coming to get him and take him home and<br/>
hang out with him for awhile.  None of that satisfied him, and he just<br/>
insisted that I get out NOW.  He started pulling on me and I just<br/>
calmly told him that no, Luke needed me in the pool right now, and<br/>
re-stated his options.  I was trying to think of new options that<br/>
would satisfy both boys but wasn&#39;t coming up with anything else.  <br/>
<br/>
When pulling on me didn&#39;t work, he started hitting and punching. He<br/>
said &quot;Come now&quot; over and over.  So I held his hands to keep him from<br/>
hitting me, and told him to stop, that I wouldn&#39;t tolerate him hitting<br/>
me. But he didn&#39;t stop when I told him to, and I spent probably 15<br/>
minutes keeping him from hitting me--telling him no, holding his hands<br/>
so he couldn&#39;t hit, until he finally gave up.  He went in and got<br/>
changed, got himself a drink, and came out to the pool deck and sat<br/>
down and talked to us.  But obviously, what I would like to figure out<br/>
is how to avoid that kind of struggle. I shouldn&#39;t have to hold an 8<br/>
year old back from hitting me for 15 minutes.  I can do it now, but in<br/>
a few years he might be physically stronger than me.   If he had been<br/>
the only child who needed me to be doing something with him, then I<br/>
would have gotten out of the pool right away with him--but that wasn&#39;t<br/>
the case.  I had another child who would have been equally upset if I<br/>
HAD gotten out of the pool with Matt.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a similar issue with kids hitting each other.  The fighting<br/>
escalated for awhile during the last few months. I&#39;ve told them it&#39;s<br/>
not acceptable.  I&#39;ve told them to come to me when they&#39;re frustrated<br/>
and talk to me first before they hit--they sometimes do and they<br/>
sometimes don&#39;t.  There is still sometimes hitting and kicking and<br/>
crying and &quot;he hit me first&quot; and &quot;he hit me so now I AM going to hit<br/>
him back, and don&#39;t try to stop me&quot; and me holding frustrated kids<br/>
back and me fervently trying to explain why you shouldn&#39;t hit your<br/>
mommy or brother or sister.  <br/>
<br/>
Once, after a particularly nasty fist fight that involved all 3 kids<br/>
including the 12 year old, I just sat them down and said, &quot;Look, you<br/>
guys have an incredible amount of freedom and incredible opportunities<br/>
to do all kinds of cool things that lots of kids don&#39;t have.  We have<br/>
a really cool lifestyle here and when fights like this happen our life<br/>
isn&#39;t anywhere near as fun and nice as it could be for any of us.  If<br/>
you want to continue to have the amount of freedom that you have, this<br/>
kind of fighting can&#39;t continue.&quot;   I haven&#39;t threatened with a loss<br/>
of freedom or privelages for YEARS now, and now here I was saying, &quot;No<br/>
fighting or there will be some loss of freedom (I didn&#39;t say what kind<br/>
of loss of freedom, just kind of emphasized that the kind of fighting<br/>
that&#39;s been happening more and more lately simply can&#39;t continue or<br/>
(something that I didn&#39;t describe).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not entirely happy with the way I worded it to them, but at the<br/>
time it was the best I could come up with.  <br/>
<br/>
So they wanted to know &quot;or what&quot; specifically.  What would I do if<br/>
they continue to hurt each other?  Would they have to go to school? <br/>
Would I start being as strict as some other moms that we know?  What<br/>
specifically?  In other words, is it worth it to them to stop hurting<br/>
each other?  What are the stakes?  <br/>
<br/>
The thing is, they know me well.  They know I won&#39;t send them to<br/>
school.  They know I won&#39;t ground them or take away stuff.  They know<br/>
I won&#39;t even threaten to.   So I just told them, &quot;Look, let&#39;s not even<br/>
talk about what I *could* do.  You know I don&#39;t want to make you go to<br/>
school or get real strict with you.  But this is important.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be making this big of a deal about it if it isn&#39;t.  As a<br/>
family, it&#39;s important to all of us to have a home where people don&#39;t<br/>
get hurt, so let&#39;s just all work toward having this be a place where<br/>
people don&#39;t have to worry about getting hurt because that&#39;s a good<br/>
deal for everyone&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
And since that talk, things *have* been better.  I&#39;m still breaking up<br/>
fights every once in awhile, and still every once in awhile saying,<br/>
&quot;Remember, it&#39;s just not acceptable to hit even if you&#39;re (angry,<br/>
frustrated, etc.).  It&#39;s not okay to threaten to dump soda on your<br/>
sister&#39;s head, it&#39;s not okay to hit him because he threatened to dump<br/>
soda on your head, it&#39;s not okay to hit her because she hit you<br/>
because you threatened to dump soda on your head.  And I&#39;m still<br/>
sometimes hearing &quot;I&#39;m going to hit him no matter what you say, and<br/>
he&#39;s not my brother&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Matt said to me, &quot;Mom, you told me not to hit my brother and not to<br/>
annoy him so that he wants to hit me.  But when you tell me that, YOU<br/>
annoy me.  I don&#39;t LIKE you telling me that.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But so far I&#39;ve been able to keep things from escalating into anything<br/>
big.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Joyce, LOL. That explains a lot. My biggest fears, and yes I <br/>
realize they are *my* fears &lt;g&gt;, are not what my kids want inside the <br/>
home but the fear with the strangers outside the home. And even that is <br/>
broken down into two groups: The friends who may do things that I, as a <br/>
parent, would hope my child does not want to do: stealing. alcohol, <br/>
drugs, sex, etc. At that point I need to trust in my child, right? Trust <br/>
that she will do what she feels is best for her, knowing she has <br/>
received the education concerning these things?<br/>
And the second are the strangers. The kidnappers, pedophiles, etc. And <br/>
not just the stranger ones but the ones that a person knows and trusts <br/>
as well. I&#39;m sure that weighs more heavily on my mind then someone who <br/>
has never had anything &quot;criminal&quot; happen to them but is the best <br/>
attitude to take a deep breath and have trust in a higher power?<br/>
It may be easier if some of the kids in this complex haven&#39;t been <br/>
calling my daughter fatty, among other things, for the pass three years. <br/>
It&#39;s hard for a mother to hear, but I have explained that it is not <br/>
about her but about the person speaking. I think she has a good grasp of <br/>
it but it still hurts and hurts me probably more. So every time she goes <br/>
out to play my stomach does flips. My faith in mankind has not lifted <br/>
since I moved in here. LOL<br/>

important to you than what he wanted.  That probably didn&#39;t feel very<br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
You gave Matt lots of great options, but it sounds like what he wanted<br/>
was you (how flattering &lt;G&gt;).  You could have offered to get out with<br/>
him for a few minutes, wrap him in a towel, maybe even run in to get<br/>
him a snack, or just sit with him on the side of the pool for a minute<br/>
or two, with an arm around him if he wanted.  I know that when I was a<br/>
child and I was wet and getting kind of cold and shivery, it felt<br/>
great to have an adult&#39;s strong hands wrap me up and dry me off.  <br/>
<br/>
Then you could get back in with Luke and play some more.  You could<br/>
even alternate every few minutes, if the boys felt they each needed<br/>
some more time with you.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to do when you aren&#39;t sure what to do is to state the<br/>
problem and offer it back to your kids.  &quot;Matt wants me to get out,<br/>
Luke wants me to stay in.  What both of you want is important to me. <br/>
I can&#39;t do both at once.  Do you guys have some ideas about how to<br/>
work this out?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids will surprise you with the solutions they come up with.<br/>
 Even when they can&#39;t think of anything, you&#39;ve done a few helpful<br/>
things:  1)  You&#39;ve put yourself in win/win mode and given yourself a<br/>
few minutes to think just by re-stating the situation; 2) You&#39;ve<br/>
helped your children to see the whole issue, not just their side of<br/>
it; and 3)  You&#39;ve given them a chance to see good problem-solving in<br/>
action and to at least start thinking about things that way -- and<br/>
problem-solving is a skill they will need and use all their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this may not seem to address your actual problem of<br/>
hitting.  That&#39;s because usually, by age 8, a child is hitting out of<br/>
frustration at not being heard or having needs met -- because there<br/>
isn&#39;t enough problem-solving going on.  (As opposed to the hitting<br/>
kids will do at 2 or 3, when they&#39;re gauging the reaction of others<br/>
and their language skills just aren&#39;t up to their communication skills<br/>
yet -- a different kind of frustration.)  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the fighting going on, are you present with the kids,<br/>
helping them problem-solve as they&#39;re playing?  Or are you in another<br/>
room and only coming in when a problem breaks out?  That can make a<br/>
world of difference.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t read it already, you might find _Siblings Without<br/>
Rivalry_ a good read (and an easy one, too) about facilitating better<br/>
communication and problem-solving.<br/>

With eight years between children, this has never been a problem for us <br/>
(two onelies), so I really don&#39;t have much first-hand advice.<br/>
<br/>
But, in this instance, with one child *in* the water, HE would get my <br/>
attention. The child out of the pool isn&#39;t in need as much. Safety <br/>
should be a good enough answer/reason.  You&#39;re not &quot;chosing&quot; one child <br/>
over the other, but one situation over the other.<br/>
<br/>
As for the hitting and fighting...I&#39;ll leave that to more experienced <br/>
moms.<br/>

Do you suppose there is an underlying concern about favoritism?  I mean <br/>
all kids seem to sometimes think they are getting the short end of the <br/>
stick.  But in some cases parents defend the youngest child more and <br/>
criticize the oldest child more (for fairly understandable reasons), and <br/>
that can seem very biased to the kid who is oldest.<br/>
<br/>
**But, in this instance, with one child *in* the water, HE would get my<br/>
attention.**<br/>
<br/>
Sure, but explicitly state your reason in case the other child is <br/>
failing to comprehend it.  I wouldn&#39;t leave the pool, either, unless <br/>
perhaps my friend wasn&#39;t busy lifeguarding her own kids and could safely <br/>
watch mine.  I understand the assumption that the kid IN the pool wants <br/>
to stay in the pool, but it might be worth asking &quot;want to get out at <br/>
warm up?&quot; or &quot;want to go inside and have a snack?&quot; so that the other <br/>
child sees you trying.<br/>
<br/>
The only thinga I can think of to add are validating the departing <br/>
child&#39;s desires (verbally -- &quot;I wish I could&quot;) and finding out more <br/>
explicitly what he wanted you with him for.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When pulling on me didn&#39;t work, he started hitting and punching. He<br/>
&gt; said &quot;Come now&quot; over and over.  So I held his hands to keep him from<br/>
&gt; hitting me, and told him to stop, that I wouldn&#39;t tolerate him hitting<br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where was his dad?<br/>
<br/>
From the account, it sounds like too much talking, not calling for assistance <br/>
soon enough, and VERY likely that he needed to talk to you in private or that <br/>
he was uncomfortable about something that had nothing to do with you or the <br/>
pool.<br/>
<br/>
You were at someone else&#39;s house and one of your children really wanted to be <br/>
with you privately.   I would have called the dad and see which child seemed <br/>
most willing to have the dad replace you in the situation.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-But he didn&#39;t stop when I told him to, and I spent probably 15<br/>
minutes keeping him from hitting me--telling him no, holding his hands<br/>
so he couldn&#39;t hit, until he finally gave up. -=-<br/>
<br/>
From his point of view, you didn&#39;t pay attention to what he needed and for a <br/>
whole fifteen minutes you weren&#39;t with EITHER child, really.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I shouldn&#39;t have to hold an 8<br/>
year old back from hitting me for 15 minutes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nothing like that should last for fifteen minutes.    If what you were doing <br/>
wasn&#39;t helping, it wasn&#39;t the right thing to do.   You were in a swimming <br/>
pool.   Why didn&#39;t you just cast yourself off and get out of his reach?   Why didn&#39;<br/>
t anyone else who was there that day go and get the other parent, or come and <br/>
try to distract the child?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I can do it now, but in<br/>
a few years he might be physically stronger than me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If by then you haven&#39;t discussed and developed other ways to communicate, <br/>
that will be a lack of communication.   When he doesn&#39;t need you, when you&#39;re not <br/>
busy and he&#39;s not busy, discuss that.   Ask him and listen to him about why <br/>
he needed you so immediately, and figure out ways for him to communicate to you <br/>
what he needs in words.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-  If he had been<br/>
the only child who needed me to be doing something with him, then I<br/>
would have gotten out of the pool right away with him--but that wasn&#39;t<br/>
the case.  I had another child who would have been equally upset-=-<br/>
<br/>
But whose need was greater?   One had a greater need, and it&#39;s possible you <br/>
could have given both PART of what they wanted, instead of (as it seems) <br/>
depriving both of your kind attention.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve told them it&#39;s not acceptable. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Blah blah blah.   Using big words on little kids is not communication.   What <br/>
does &quot;acceptable&quot; mean in such a case?   Or what?    Talk to them about what <br/>
it REALLY does, in immediate terms.<br/>
<br/>
-=-and me fervently trying to explain why-=-<br/>
<br/>
Too much talking.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I haven&#39;t threatened with a loss<br/>
of freedom or privelages for YEARS now, and now here I was saying, &quot;No<br/>
fighting or there will be some loss of freedom (I didn&#39;t say what kind<br/>
of loss of freedom,-=-<br/>
<br/>
And they probably rightly guessed that you didn&#39;t know.   It was a false <br/>
threat and your &quot;punishment&quot; would have caused more frustration and resentment and <br/>
more hitting, quite likely.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  I&#39;m still breaking up<br/>
fights every once in awhile, and still every once in awhile saying,<br/>
&quot;Remember, it&#39;s just not acceptable to hit even if you&#39;re (angry,<br/>
frustrated, etc.).  It&#39;s not okay to threaten to dump soda on your<br/>
sister&#39;s head, it&#39;s not okay to hit him because he threatened to dump<br/>
soda on your head, it&#39;s not okay to hit her because she hit you<br/>
because you threatened to dump soda on your head. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I would scream if you make a speech like that to me when I was already angry <br/>
enough to hit.<br/>
If someone is that angry, say &quot;STOP!&quot; and say it like you mean it.   Say it <br/>
short and commandingly and get all but the one kid OUT of the room and wait <br/>
until they&#39;re gone out of earshot and then let him calm down and tell his side.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And I&#39;m still<br/>
sometimes hearing &quot;I&#39;m going to hit him no matter what you say, and<br/>
he&#39;s not my brother&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because your talking isn&#39;t helping.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Matt said to me, &quot;Mom, you told me not to hit my brother and not to<br/>
annoy him so that he wants to hit me.  But when you tell me that, YOU<br/>
annoy me.  I don&#39;t LIKE you telling me that.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
Their punishment is having to hear you talk and talk and talk in vague terms.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how I&#39;ve handled similar situations.   The privacy is crucial:<br/>

&gt; parent, would hope my child does not want to do: stealing. alcohol,<br/>
&gt; drugs, sex, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Holly was offered drugs in England, both at a campout and on the street in <br/>
SoHo.    Instead of saying &quot;sure,&quot; she said no, and then told me about it in a <br/>
conversational &quot;something exciting happened&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has one particularly needy and nasty friend who would have sex with <br/>
Holly in a heartbeat if she made the offer (if he weren&#39;t afraid of her brothers <br/>
and me, who would hurt him before her really-big daddy ever even heard about <br/>
it, he might make the offer himself).    We&#39;ve warned her jokingly for years, <br/>
though, that Logan thinks she&#39;s cute and she should be careful about being <br/>
alone with Logan.   It hasn&#39;t been said in an ominous, danger-way.   And the boys <br/>
have jokingly warned Logan not to even THINK about Holly, and it&#39;s the kind of <br/>
joke that&#39;s not a joke.   But honestly, Holly kinda likes him and it has <br/>
occurred to me that at some point in the future she might want to hang out with <br/>
him some on her own.         <br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks before she was leaving for England, Logan actually said to <br/>
her (by phone), &quot;We need to go out and do something before you leave for <br/>
England.&quot;   I think she said yeah, maybe, or some such, but as soon as she got off <br/>
the phone she rolled her eyes and laughed and told me what he had said.      <br/>
She spent the last two weeks packing and making lists and playing Halo2 as much <br/>
as she could, knowing she&#39;d play none while she was gone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-etc. At that point I need to trust in my child, right? Trust<br/>
that she will do what she feels is best for her, knowing she has<br/>
received the education concerning these things?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t &quot;trust&quot; it if you don&#39;t do it.<br/>
And &quot;education&quot; isn&#39;t a good unschooling term.   How will she have learned <br/>
about such things?   With my kids it came from movies, conversations about those <br/>
movies; stories and conversations; song lyrics and conversations; accounts <br/>
from older friends about problems in relationships, and family stories and news <br/>
stories and conversations about those.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;m sure that weighs more heavily on my mind then someone who<br/>
has never had anything &quot;criminal&quot; happen to them but is the best<br/>
attitude to take a deep breath and have trust in a higher power?-=-<br/>
<br/>
See above.   Neither &quot;trust&quot; in what amounts to luck nor worry will keep a <br/>
child safe.   The child&#39;s confidence and knowledge and relationship with the <br/>
parents and mental checklist of how to get out of sticky situations will keep her <br/>
safe.   If you can afford a cellphone, make sure anyone who&#39;s out alone away <br/>
from the family has one with her.<br/>

littler one who was still in the pool.  Luke can handle being in the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I have some questions from that article: &quot;What has worked best<br/>
is taking the one away and letting him tell me what happened. While<br/>
he&#39;s calming down and stating his case, I&#39;m asking him what he did to<br/>
try to make things better. &quot;Did you think of doing this?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; or<br/>
&quot;Yes, but it didn&#39;t work.&quot;  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
What do you do if you give all the suggestions you can think of, and<br/>
they say &quot;Yes, but it didn&#39;t work&quot; and then they say, &quot;So if you can&#39;t<br/>
give me any suggestions that I like, then I&#39;m going to hurt him&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
For example, one child wants to hurt her brother because he&#39;s<br/>
constantly and purposefully annoying her (with a big grin on his face,<br/>
acting as if nothing could give him greater pleasure than upsetting<br/>
his sister), and I can&#39;t get the child to stop annoying.  I might be<br/>
able to get him to stop annoying that moment, or that day, but if it<br/>
starts right up again the next day and she&#39;s frustrated and says, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
NOT going to go through this every day, today I AM going to hurt him&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;But I remind them that I&#39;m responsible for seeing that BOTH of them<br/>
are safe in their own homes, and happy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Did they ever resond with, &quot;But I don&#39;t WANT you to care about him and<br/>
I hate him and he&#39;s not my brother and I don&#39;t want him to live here<br/>
anymore&quot;?  Usually when I say that kind of thing it just gets them<br/>
MORE angry.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I remind Kirby he&#39;s older and has a responsibility to show some<br/>
maturity and set an example (as appropriate, if appropriate). And I<br/>
tell him yada yada, Marty needs to be safe in his own home, and not<br/>
feel like his life is ruined because he has an older brother who&#39;s<br/>
bullying him (if appropriate...)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they accept this?  They don&#39;t argue back at you?  &quot;That&#39;s not<br/>
fair&quot; or &quot;But he&#39;s a jerk&quot; or anything?  I get so frustrated when I<br/>
deal with fighting the way you described and while I might stop the<br/>
fighting at the moment, everyone leaves feeling annoyed at ME.   They<br/>
leave angry at ME because I made them stop fighting, and not because I<br/>
don&#39;t give them lots of sympathy and empathy and understanding.  <br/>
<br/>
I think a big reason why the fighting has escalated is because I got<br/>
frustrated and felt that *I* couldn&#39;t deal with anymore so I just<br/>
started walking away.  AND because after I&#39;ve been doing stuff for<br/>
other people for 6, 7 hours with no break for time for myself, I&#39;m<br/>
ready to just walk away and say ENOUGH!  <br/>
<br/>
I know that just walking away isn&#39;t the answer, and I can see that the<br/>
result of doing that is even more fighting.  It&#39;s just tiring!   And<br/>
yeah, I know that parenting can be tiring.  I just wonder if I get<br/>
more tired from it than most people, if my kids have a tendency to<br/>
fight more than other kids, if I just have to keep perservering, etc.<br/>
  I know people who have sent their kids to school because they<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand the fighting and needed the time for themselves and I<br/>
know *that&#39;s* not the answer for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it would be helpful to be a fly on the wall of other<br/>
households sometimes. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173071275">Someone else asked this, but I think it bears repeating.  How present are<br/>
you with the kids during the day?  Are you off cleaning the house and<br/>
cooking or are you in the same room with the kids, tuned in to what they are<br/>
doing?  When they have small disagreements, are you there to help them work<br/>
things out, to help them state their cases and to make sure they listen to<br/>
each other<br/>
<br/>
I spent the first 5 years of my kids&#39; lives on the floor with them or in the<br/>
same room tuned into what they were doing.  I helped them work things out<br/>
and negotiate what they wanted.  They are now 8 and 10 and I can&#39;t even<br/>
imagine anything like what you explained between your children. <br/>
<br/>
The first time I heard one of them called the other a name, we talked about<br/>
name calling and what made that person frustrated to begin with.  We worked<br/>
through the issues until both kids were satisfied that they were listened to<br/>
and understood.   Name calling isn&#39;t an issue at my house.  The same goes<br/>
for hitting.  <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t too late to be present and to help them work things through.  I&#39;d<br/>
recommend you spend a lot of time listening to the kids play and helping<br/>
them communicate.<br/>

<br/>
Seriously though, I wish I would have been an unschooler/attachment <br/>
parenting/gentle parenting mom from the beginning. About 10 years ago <br/>
there was a period of about 2 years, starting right around the time <br/>
my oldest daughter was 4 and my middle child was born, when I got so <br/>
involved in church work that I might as well have been working full <br/>
time.  I nursed the baby and took care of the basics, and did school-<br/>
at-home with the oldest but didn&#39;t play *with* them much at all.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I eventually became an unschooler and swung in the opposite <br/>
direction so extremely that I kind of made myself a servant to them. <br/>
I took the &quot;try not to say no&quot; advice too literally because I didn&#39;t <br/>
know how to have personal limits and didn&#39;t know how to do anything <br/>
nice for myself.  Hard to explain, but they literally got in <br/>
arguments over who got me first (they never wanted to play games <br/>
together, they always wanted just my attention one on one) and <br/>
demanded my time from the time I got up til the time I got in bed.  <br/>
Like the first words out of each child&#39;s mouth in the morning would <br/>
be asking me if I would play a game with just him before I played a <br/>
game with anyone else, and then the next person would claim the next <br/>
time slot, and before the day would even be started I&#39;d be filled up <br/>
with promises to do stuff with them, often with more promised than I <br/>
could possibly accomplish and me not getting enough sleep trying to <br/>
get everything done.  I took NO time for myself for quite awhile, <br/>
literally just giving into demands all day, every day.  <br/>
<br/>
Then people on this list started talking about moms having their own <br/>
interests, and I didn&#39;t understand how anyone could have their own <br/>
interests and be an unschooler.  I figured anything I was interested <br/>
in would have to wait until the kids were grown. And my homeopath <br/>
started talking about respecting myself and loving myself--totally <br/>
new concepts for me that took awhile to adjust to.  So I started <br/>
finding things I was interested in, and had to adjust and learn to <br/>
balance time for myself with time for the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re finding that balance, and things are pretty good, except that <br/>
sometimes, at least once a day--if we have a day with no fighting <br/>
it&#39;s rare--I&#39;m dealing with fighting.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m present with them for a good part of the day now.  But <br/>
sometimes now, after I&#39;ve done stuff for and with them for several <br/>
hours, I take a book of my own and sit and read it, or ask for some <br/>
uninterrupted internet time, or go to the park and do some writing of <br/>
my own, or get together with one of my friends.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I spent the first 5 years of my kids&#39; lives on the floor with them <br/>
 </span></blockquote>or in the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; same room tuned into what they were doing.  I helped them work <br/>
 </span></blockquote>things out<br/>

 </span></blockquote>even<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; imagine anything like what you explained between your children. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If life had a rewind button, I&#39;d go back and do things that way. :)  <br/>
I was just so insecure myself, had no confidence in my ability to <br/>
trust my own instincts let alone trust my kids, I thought I had to be <br/>
doing something &quot;productive&quot; to be worthwhile (serving God through <br/>
the church or serving my husband or being a good housekeeper or <br/>
meeting the physical needs of my children or teaching them what I was <br/>
told they need to know), and had never ever seen anyone parent any <br/>
way other than the strict James Dobson kind of way.  I didn&#39;t have <br/>
the internet when I was pregnant with my first--if I had, gosh, life <br/>
would have been different.  The road to unschooling was NOT an easy <br/>
road for us.  We had to struggle to get where we are now, but I&#39;m <br/>
glad we&#39;re here. :) <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It isn&#39;t too late to be present and to help them work things <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; recommend you spend a lot of time listening to the kids play and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>helping<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them communicate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to keep working on it. I really want them to learn to get <br/>
along.  My poor kids have had to do a lot of adjusting to me learning <br/>
to be the kind of person I want to be. Hopefully you&#39;re right that it <br/>
isn&#39;t too late. :) <br/>

I&#39;ll help them if they need it.<br/>

to walk away and leave you at that person&#39;s mercy?<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t figure out something really clever, maybe just take one kid <br/>
aside if stress starts.   Stop it before there&#39;s yelling or fighting.   Try to <br/>
teach them tricks for recognizing when it&#39;s getting stressful and what to do to <br/>
make it better.   Breathing, walking, going to pet the dog, something...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868514346">Well, Im an old Mom, I have kids between 27 and 7.. so I think you<br/>
have to teach a child way younger than 8 that hitting is a no no. My<br/>
youngest hit a younger neighbor child once when he was about 5. I told<br/>
him in no uncertain terms that this was &quot;not cool&quot; and sent him to his<br/>
room for like a whole ten minutes. You would think the world ended...<br/>
(Punishment is extremely rare in my home, that was his only time out<br/>
in his life) but he got the message. I think it&#39;s about what message<br/>
you are sending and how you send it. I personally feel its extremely<br/>
important to let your children know violence is not the way to solve<br/>
problems at a very early age. I also think it&#39;s a bad idea to<br/>
over-analyze a given situation when it comes to a child using<br/>
violence, especially against a parent. They get bigger than you. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Anyway, yes, it goes well beyond saying &quot;This is why you<br/>
&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t hit mommy ...&quot; ;-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I&#39;m wondering, what would you say to a child who is hitting mommy?<br/>
&gt;   If you tell him firmly to stop and he says no and continues anyway?   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I ask, because I can give a real life recent example.  I&#39;ll tell what<br/>
&gt; I did, but I wonder if others would handle it differently. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We were swimming at a friend&#39;s house.  Luke (who&#39;s 6) was in a big<br/>
&gt; inter-tube type thing that he was filling up with water.  He was<br/>
&gt; handing me the plastic bucket, and I was filling it up with water and<br/>
&gt; handing it to him.  Matt (who&#39;s 8)had been playing with us but got<br/>
&gt; sick of it and wanted to get out of the pool.  Luke heard him ask me<br/>
&gt; to get out of the pool with him and got upset and said in a pleading<br/>
&gt; kind of voice, &quot;No, don&#39;t get out of the pool, I want you to stay here<br/>
&gt; with me&quot;.  So I had one boy begging me to stay in with him and one boy<br/>
&gt; begging me to get out with him.  So I told Matt that I wanted to stay<br/>
&gt; in with Luke for awhile, but that he could wrap up in a towel and sit<br/>
&gt; on the deck and talk with us.  Or he could change into dry clothes and<br/>
&gt; come back down and sit on the deck and be with us.   Or he could go<br/>
&gt; into the house, where his sister and friend were, and watch tv, play<br/>
&gt; with toys or video games, get a snack and drink, etc.  Or I would call<br/>
&gt; his dad, who wouldn&#39;t mind coming to get him and take him home and<br/>
&gt; hang out with him for awhile.  None of that satisfied him, and he just<br/>
&gt; insisted that I get out NOW.  He started pulling on me and I just<br/>
&gt; calmly told him that no, Luke needed me in the pool right now, and<br/>
&gt; re-stated his options.  I was trying to think of new options that<br/>
&gt; would satisfy both boys but wasn&#39;t coming up with anything else.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When pulling on me didn&#39;t work, he started hitting and punching. He<br/>
&gt; said &quot;Come now&quot; over and over.  So I held his hands to keep him from<br/>
&gt; hitting me, and told him to stop, that I wouldn&#39;t tolerate him hitting<br/>
&gt; me. But he didn&#39;t stop when I told him to, and I spent probably 15<br/>
&gt; minutes keeping him from hitting me--telling him no, holding his hands<br/>
&gt; so he couldn&#39;t hit, until he finally gave up.  He went in and got<br/>
&gt; changed, got himself a drink, and came out to the pool deck and sat<br/>
&gt; down and talked to us.  But obviously, what I would like to figure out<br/>
&gt; is how to avoid that kind of struggle. I shouldn&#39;t have to hold an 8<br/>
&gt; year old back from hitting me for 15 minutes.  I can do it now, but in<br/>
&gt; a few years he might be physically stronger than me.   If he had been<br/>
&gt; the only child who needed me to be doing something with him, then I<br/>
&gt; would have gotten out of the pool right away with him--but that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; the case.  I had another child who would have been equally upset if I<br/>
&gt; HAD gotten out of the pool with Matt.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a similar issue with kids hitting each other.  The fighting<br/>
&gt; escalated for awhile during the last few months. I&#39;ve told them it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not acceptable.  I&#39;ve told them to come to me when they&#39;re frustrated<br/>
&gt; and talk to me first before they hit--they sometimes do and they<br/>
&gt; sometimes don&#39;t.  There is still sometimes hitting and kicking and<br/>
&gt; crying and &quot;he hit me first&quot; and &quot;he hit me so now I AM going to hit<br/>
&gt; him back, and don&#39;t try to stop me&quot; and me holding frustrated kids<br/>
&gt; back and me fervently trying to explain why you shouldn&#39;t hit your<br/>
&gt; mommy or brother or sister.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once, after a particularly nasty fist fight that involved all 3 kids<br/>
&gt; including the 12 year old, I just sat them down and said, &quot;Look, you<br/>
&gt; guys have an incredible amount of freedom and incredible opportunities<br/>
&gt; to do all kinds of cool things that lots of kids don&#39;t have.  We have<br/>
&gt; a really cool lifestyle here and when fights like this happen our life<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t anywhere near as fun and nice as it could be for any of us.  If<br/>
&gt; you want to continue to have the amount of freedom that you have, this<br/>
&gt; kind of fighting can&#39;t continue.&quot;   I haven&#39;t threatened with a loss<br/>
&gt; of freedom or privelages for YEARS now, and now here I was saying, &quot;No<br/>
&gt; fighting or there will be some loss of freedom (I didn&#39;t say what kind<br/>
&gt; of loss of freedom, just kind of emphasized that the kind of fighting<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s been happening more and more lately simply can&#39;t continue or<br/>
&gt; (something that I didn&#39;t describe).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not entirely happy with the way I worded it to them, but at the<br/>
&gt; time it was the best I could come up with.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So they wanted to know &quot;or what&quot; specifically.  What would I do if<br/>
&gt; they continue to hurt each other?  Would they have to go to school? <br/>
&gt; Would I start being as strict as some other moms that we know?  What<br/>
&gt; specifically?  In other words, is it worth it to them to stop hurting<br/>
&gt; each other?  What are the stakes?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The thing is, they know me well.  They know I won&#39;t send them to<br/>
&gt; school.  They know I won&#39;t ground them or take away stuff.  They know<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t even threaten to.   So I just told them, &quot;Look, let&#39;s not even<br/>
&gt; talk about what I *could* do.  You know I don&#39;t want to make you go to<br/>
&gt; school or get real strict with you.  But this is important.  I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be making this big of a deal about it if it isn&#39;t.  As a<br/>
&gt; family, it&#39;s important to all of us to have a home where people don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get hurt, so let&#39;s just all work toward having this be a place where<br/>
&gt; people don&#39;t have to worry about getting hurt because that&#39;s a good<br/>
&gt; deal for everyone&quot;.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And since that talk, things *have* been better.  I&#39;m still breaking up<br/>
&gt; fights every once in awhile, and still every once in awhile saying,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Remember, it&#39;s just not acceptable to hit even if you&#39;re (angry,<br/>
&gt; frustrated, etc.).  It&#39;s not okay to threaten to dump soda on your<br/>
&gt; sister&#39;s head, it&#39;s not okay to hit him because he threatened to dump<br/>
&gt; soda on your head, it&#39;s not okay to hit her because she hit you<br/>
&gt; because you threatened to dump soda on your head.  And I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; sometimes hearing &quot;I&#39;m going to hit him no matter what you say, and<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s not my brother&quot;. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Matt said to me, &quot;Mom, you told me not to hit my brother and not to<br/>
&gt; annoy him so that he wants to hit me.  But when you tell me that, YOU<br/>
&gt; annoy me.  I don&#39;t LIKE you telling me that.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But so far I&#39;ve been able to keep things from escalating into anything<br/>
&gt; big.  <br/>

&gt; parenting/gentle parenting mom from the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Better late than never.  But it does sound like the boys don&#39;t think you are<br/>
serious about the not hitting.  Sandra has said it before but each of your<br/>
kids needs to feel safe in their own home.  That is what I would focus on<br/>
for the time being.  Get that under control first.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then I eventually became an unschooler and swung in the opposite<br/>
&gt; direction so extremely that I kind of made myself a servant to them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a healthy way to live either.  :(  People (including kids) will only<br/>
treat you as badly as you allow them to.  I don&#39;t know if you have someone<br/>
in your life with whom you have a healthy give and take relationship, but if<br/>
you do, try to think of how you would interact with them in any given<br/>
circumstances and try to carry that over to your children.<br/>
<br/>
Hard to explain, but they literally got in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; arguments over who got me first (they never wanted to play games<br/>
&gt; together, they always wanted just my attention one on one) and<br/>
&gt; demanded my time from the time I got up til the time I got in bed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is sad that they felt so needy.  I would hope you could spend a little<br/>
one on one time with each of them but also include the other kids in the<br/>
games you play.  It doesn&#39;t feel good to feel left out either.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then people on this list started talking about moms having their own<br/>
&gt; interests, and I didn&#39;t understand how anyone could have their own<br/>
&gt; interests and be an unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my kids were really little, I didn&#39;t have much time for my own<br/>
interests unless they were sleeping.  But it was time well invested.  Maybe<br/>
you need to invest that time now, since you didn&#39;t when they were little.<br/>
Then when they are feeling more stable and loved you will begin to have time<br/>
for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes, I&#39;m present with them for a good part of the day now.  But<br/>
&gt; sometimes now, after I&#39;ve done stuff for and with them for several<br/>
&gt; hours, I take a book of my own and sit and read it, or ask for some<br/>
&gt; uninterrupted internet time, or go to the park and do some writing of<br/>
&gt; my own, or get together with one of my friends.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Still now, if I am doing something for myself and things start to go<br/>
downhill between the girls, I stop what I am doing and address the<br/>
situation.  My kids getting along is one of my top priorities, more so than<br/>
my time for myself.  And the better they get at working things out for<br/>
themselves, the more time I have for myself in the end anyway.<br/>

In my experience, if my son is still annoyed with me, it&#39;s because I<br/>
jumped to pure problem-solving mode too early.  (i.e., &quot;What can we do<br/>
differently?&quot;)  He feels like nobody understands him -- he still wants<br/>
a chance to get his side of the story out and to really be heard and<br/>
validated.  <br/>
<br/>
He may even have some ideas about how things could go differently, if<br/>
I would stop popping in with my suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
So if your kids are saying, &quot;Whatever, if he does that again I&#39;m going<br/>
to hurt him,&quot; it sounds like they need you to be with them  in that<br/>
emotional place for a bit.  &quot;It seems just intolerable when he does<br/>
that, right?  You can&#39;t stand it, you feel like you&#39;re going to<br/>
explode when he does it, you hate it so much.  Is that it or is there<br/>
something else?&quot;  (It can look really gimpy in print, but you can make<br/>
it sound like a kind friend and not use the sing-song mommy voice at<br/>
all.)   <br/>
<br/>
And then let them keep talking, or correct you, and you just keep<br/>
validating how hard that is for them.  Let them really vent it all to<br/>
you as long as they need to, without jumping to the mode of, &quot;Well,<br/>
that may be, but we need to fix this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And you can even go so far as, &quot;I can understand that -- if someone<br/>
were doing that to me, I&#39;d find it so hard to handle.  I remember once<br/>
when I was a kid ...&quot;   Usually, as I&#39;m talking to my son, I do<br/>
remember a similar situation happening to me when I was a child, so I<br/>
tell a brief version of it and I tell how I felt.  I don&#39;t move on to<br/>
&quot;and the moral of the story is&quot; or anything.  It&#39;s a way to get myself<br/>
in my child&#39;s head, and for him to realize that mom really does know<br/>
what he&#39;s talking about.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, my kids just melt when I empathize with them and<br/>
they feel heard.  That&#39;s the key for them getting out of defensive<br/>
mode, and *only* when they are out of defensive mode are they open to<br/>
problem-solving.  If you move to straight problem-solving mode too<br/>
soon, they are being asked to ignore or deny their own feelings.<br/>
<br/>
For that reason, I do think of validating and empathizing as the<br/>
first, key, essential step of problem-solving, though I didn&#39;t specify<br/>
that when I first posted about problem-solving.  <br/>
<br/>
In our house, nothing works without this step.<br/>
<br/>

You said it appeared that I was here to learn something--maybe  you have me <br/>

fighting.  I&#39;m not her.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a long-term unschooler with grown  children.  I did say &quot;forget about  <br/>
unschooling or peaceful parenting&quot;.  I still mean it.  The family in  the OP <br/>
needs something besides just more talk.  It needs action now to stop  one child <br/>
from hurting the other (And again, I don&#39;t mean spanking).  If  that appears <br/>
&quot;violent&quot; to people who practice &quot;non-violent communication&quot;, so be  it.<br/>

over-analyze a given situation when it comes to a child using<br/>

<br/>
This isn&#39;t very helpful, though, without suggesting what you think WILL help. <br/>
  There is analysis (which IS very helpful) and &quot;over analysis&quot; which is <br/>
sometimes a term used by those without the ability to analyze a social situation.<br/>
<br/>
There are other unpalanced situations where analysis is insufficient, or <br/>
perhaps analysis is ALL that&#39;s happening, without any accompanying discussion or <br/>
action.<br/>
<br/>
In the original question here, there seemed to be too much verbalization of <br/>
analysis.   Some people talk to think (or write to think as seems to be lots of <br/>
the purpose of this list, which isn&#39;t too bad a deal).   If the talking is <br/>
aimed aloud at a very young child, though, he might have to learn to ignore the <br/>
mom because so many of her words aren&#39;t useful to him.    <br/>
<br/>
Analysis should include thoughts of how many words a child in a state of <br/>
frustration can really hear, and what level of ideas he&#39;s old enough to <br/>
comprehend.<br/>

<br/>
Good point.   Each needs to say all he wants to say about it.   And sometimes <br/>
one of my kids has an entirely legitimate point about something irrritating <br/>
another one does, and the best I can say is <br/>
&quot;When that starts to bother you, try to get in another room for a while; try <br/>
to get away from it,&quot; or &quot;He might grow out of that, and making a big deal <br/>
about it won&#39;t help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Admitting there are legitimate irritations is honest sympathy.   I remind my <br/>
kids (and they don&#39;t need as much reminding as they get older) that what might <br/>
drive them crazy about another friend of theirs might be the thing other <br/>
people like a lot about him or her.   Not everyone likes the same things.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I share stories of how I felt about my sister, or how my sister must have <br/>
felt about me (as the firstborn) as appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
I always go back to the other person and paraphrase the complaints, to give <br/>
that other kid a chance to consider how to avoid similar situations in the <br/>
future.   <br/>
<br/>
They are constantly getting older and wiser.<br/>

be  it.<br/>
==<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the one who questioned &quot;forgetting peaceful parenting.&quot;  Let me <br/>
clarify, since I&#39;m not calling what you&#39;re saying violent and that <br/>
wasn&#39;t my point in questioning what you said.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that stopping a child from getting hurt is violent.  I <br/>
think ensuring that a household is safe for everyone is peaceful, <br/>
and I said in that previous post that I agreed that she needed to <br/>
physically intervene to keep people safe. <br/>
<br/>
But if a mom is still learning the principles of peaceful parenting, <br/>
principles which also work toward creating a safe household, then I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want her to just forget them.  I wouldn&#39;t want her to throw <br/>
those out as unworkable, &quot;because my kids hit and that&#39;s <br/>
different.&quot;  I think she needs a &quot;both/and&quot; approach, not <br/>
an &quot;either/or&quot; approach.<br/>
<br/>
As a general principle, when a person is heading towards violence, <br/>
if you can actively listen to them, and if you can address their <br/>
needs (the needs that are driving them to violence) and if you can <br/>
treat them like a real person deserving of respect and trust, <br/>
violence will often de-escalate.  I&#39;ve seen it work not just in <br/>
families but at political protests where people and police are <br/>
starting to push and shove.  When done well, it has a history of <br/>
working between warring factions and in situations that are nearing <br/>
litigation. But yes, the ground rule has to be that nobody gets <br/>
hurt, and that will be enforced.<br/>
<br/>
So to get down to specifics, because maybe that will be a more <br/>
helpful discussion to the original poster (and others).  This is the <br/>
kind of intervention that I&#39;ve used in my house, both ensuring <br/>
everyone&#39;s safety *and* using the principles of peaceful parenting <br/>
and good (nonviolent) communication:  <br/>
<br/>
The mom here might need to insist that one of the children leave the <br/>
room, or go to their room or to a private place.  She can say, &quot;You <br/>
need to leave (or &quot;we are going to leave the room&quot;) because I cannot <br/>
let you hurt your brother/sister.  I wouldn&#39;t let anyone come in <br/>
here and hurt you, and I will not let you hurt them.&quot;  She can have <br/>
a backbone and mean it, but at least she&#39;s telling them why it&#39;s <br/>
going on -- that the intent is peaceful.  She can carry someone out <br/>
if she needs to, and she can do it in a restraining way, <br/>
nonviolently.  <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m very eager to hear about what others would do to enforce the <br/>
principle that nobody gets hurt, since that seems to be where some <br/>
of the questions are arising.  Would you do more than remove the <br/>
child?  Would you take away what they were fighting about, if it <br/>
were an item?  I&#39;m asking because I know Karen and Sandra and others <br/>
*are* experienced at this, so I&#39;d like to learn what they would <br/>
physically do to ensure everyone&#39;s safety.)<br/>
<br/>
But after she&#39;s made sure everyone else is okay, she can also come <br/>
back to the child who was hitting or going to hit, with an offering <br/>
of the child&#39;s favorite drink, perhaps.  If the child is still <br/>
raging but not hitting, she can sit with the child, just breathing <br/>
and being there with the child.  If the child is hitting, yes, she <br/>
needs to leave.  <br/>
<br/>
But when the child is able to talk, the mom doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
punitive.  She can sympathize and listen and not focus on the <br/>
hitting at first, but focus on the emotions and the needs of that <br/>
child.  (The mom can share her own emotions -- &quot;you scared me when <br/>
it looked like you would hit, and I knew I had to stop that.&quot;)  Then <br/>
they can talk about ways to handle these feelings and needs other <br/>
than hitting.  <br/>
<br/>
Then the reminder that hurting others really isn&#39;t going to fly can <br/>
come gently, with ideas about things that will work.<br/>
<br/>
And I agree with Sandra&#39;s idea about relating the key points to the <br/>
other person involved -- the parent can act as interpreter and <br/>
mediator, so the real message is conveyed.<br/>
<br/>
Focusing only on the hitting might be focusing on a symptom, not the <br/>
underlying cause.  That&#39;s why I think using good communication *as <br/>
well* is a good idea.  I found the concepts in nonviolent <br/>
communication to be good ones, but if someone doesn&#39;t like that <br/>
title, if it sounds too politically correct or something, they don&#39;t <br/>
have to use it.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
