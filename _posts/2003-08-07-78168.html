 </span></blockquote>I think this is the KEY element right here..  Because someone has a favorite <br/>
of anything, does not mean they do not like, can not tolerate, do not want <br/>
anything to do with the other things in that category.   My favorite ice cream <br/>
flaver is Edy&#39;s Blue Ribbon Chocolate Cake ( O.. MG.. delicious!)  But, I <br/>
wouldnt turn any other flavor of ice cream down.. lol.  I cant think of a flavor I <br/>
hate.., or even dislike.    My favorite color is pink.. I do not care for <br/>
brown.    I can&#39;t pick a favorite movie.. I have too many that I equally like.   A <br/>
list of favorites can go on and on.  The point is, having a favorite does not <br/>
automatically mean you hate &quot;the rest&quot;.    <br/>
<br/>
Kelly  called babies slugs.. some are slugs.. lol.   Mine were screaming <br/>
mimis.   BUT, when they were not crying with colic, they were so sweet and <br/>
wonderful.   More like cherubs than slugs :-)  <br/>
<br/>
 I love the baby stage, to me they ARE growing and learning and changing <br/>
everyday.  They learn to smile, to roll over, sit up, crawl.. They learn to be <br/>
&quot;people&quot;.   I remember being so enthralled when each of my children discovered <br/>
their hands and toes. I  also loved watching them bat thier little hands at <br/>
thier mobiles or toys, seeing them laugh and bounce in thier bouncy seats.. stand <br/>
up on thier tippy toes, they giggle and squeal with delight at the least <br/>
little thing.  You can usually distract and entertain an infant with raspberry( the <br/>
blowing kind, not the eating kind..lol).. that does not last long..When my 8 <br/>
yo is bored , blowing a raspberry has little effect. <br/>
Really, the infant stage is when babies learn the most in the shortest amount <br/>
of time.  Think about it. usually within one year, they go from &#39;slug&quot;.. <br/>
(hehehe) to a babbling, walking, eating, playing, interactive little person.<br/>
<br/>
Babies offer that sweet unconditional love, they are so innocent and <br/>
precious.  They can be &quot;demanding&quot; and needy, but that dependency on me made me feel <br/>
special and .. well.. needed.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
See, my perspective of babyhood is different from Kelly&#39;s.  But that is OK.  <br/>
I could also list the merits of Edys Blue Ribbon Chocolate Cake ice cream, but <br/>
that doesnt mean everyone would like it as much as I do. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, btw, my least favorite age is puberty!   Whether it starts at 9 or 14, <br/>
its the pits.  I wouldnt trade my kids in when they hit puberty, but.. I do need <br/>
a few more of those &quot;escape&quot; days.. lol<br/>
