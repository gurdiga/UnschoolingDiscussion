<div id="ygrps-yiv-604011678">My son&#39;s been having some trouble with the next door neighbor <br/>
kids--they&#39;ve been picking on him. Not really bad, just establishing the <br/>
pecking order. Of course I&#39;m worried, because everyone gets picked on <br/>
and they either deal with it, or it proceeds to real bullying. Out of <br/>
school, my son has the option of staying away from those kids, but he <br/>
hasn&#39;t wanted to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, he came to ask me to tell Alex to stop, and I explained why <br/>
that wouldn&#39;t work--Alex already leavse him alone when I&#39;m there--*he* <br/>
needs to tell Alex, himself. He came to tell me about it several times <br/>
(I was mowing the back, and the neighbors were cooking out in front). <br/>
Finally he came back with a look of triumph! HE had dealt with it! He <br/>
was *so* puffed up with pride. He had talked with Alex&#39;s mom and told <br/>
her of the problems with both kids.  He says he had walked past the mom <br/>
outside saying, &quot;I wish I could tell her about that problem,&quot; and she <br/>
talked to him.<br/>
<br/>
OK, so it&#39;s not the way I would have solved it, but it&#39;s the way he did, <br/>
and he&#39;s feeling so empowered. I can&#39;t express how excited I am, because <br/>
I was the kids that got beat up all the time, so he&#39;s surpassed me! I&#39;m <br/>
so glad, because interpersonal skills are really where I worry about my <br/>
guys, not algebra or such, which is much easier for us than talking to <br/>
the neighbors.<br/>

<br/>
I would talk to Alex myself, especially if my child asked me directly to do <br/>
so.<br/>
I would talk to Alex myself if my child were unsure whether he wanted it <br/>
addressed or not.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I would NOT talk to Alex myself was if my child asked me not to.<br/>
<br/>
Part of my job as mom is helping my child have a safe environment.<br/>
<br/>
It might never have occurred to Alex to behave differently.  Maybe you could <br/>
make a huge difference in Alex&#39;s life, but you have an obligation to make a <br/>
difference in your own children&#39;s lives.<br/>

Sounds like Alex&#39;s mom is the one who took action.  That&#39;s good.  Depending <br/>
what she says to Alex though, Alex might feel he was tattled on.  Had you <br/>
talked to Alex directly,  he wouldn&#39;t be in trouble with his mom (if he is, which <br/>
he might not be).<br/>

I had an &quot;aha&quot; moment from what you wrote.  I like your support for him being empowered.<br/>
<br/>
I think in traditional parenting, if a child solved a problem in a way that is &quot;not the way the parent would have solved it&quot;, then that kind of parent would have told the child that that method of problem solving was *wrong*.<br/>
