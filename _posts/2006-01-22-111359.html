<div id="ygrps-yiv-908615421">I really need some help. There are five of us in the family, dd8, ds7,<br/>
and dd4 and lately every time we want to go on an excursion, all of us<br/>
want to go except ds. I&#39;m not sure what to do about it. We wanted to<br/>
go to the science museum tomorrow for a special exhibit, and when we<br/>
brought it up he said &quot;I&#39;m not going.&quot; We wanted to go for a walk<br/>
today, and he didn&#39;t want to go out. Last week we went to a play, he<br/>
didn&#39;t want to go. Last night he didn&#39;t want to go to dinner at a<br/>
friend&#39;s house. He just doesn&#39;t like to go out to do things. The<br/>
problem is that the rest of us do like to go to do things.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to figure out what is the real problem... it seems like he&#39;s<br/>
not into the driving, but that&#39;s not the only thing. But mostly, he<br/>
yells, screams and says &quot;you can&#39;t make me&quot; and starts throwing things<br/>
and making angry faces. If you heard it from the street you&#39;d think,<br/>
boy they must always be dragging him around, but actually that&#39;s not<br/>
the case. In many situations, we split up and either dh or I stay<br/>
home. I know he&#39;s just not the kind of person who likes to go out a<br/>
lot. So mostly we don&#39;t make him. We don&#39;t sign him up for things, we<br/>
don&#39;t make him go to things, we respect his need to be alone and/or at<br/>
home. We&#39;ve even experimented with leaving him alone for short periods<br/>
of time. But what do we do when all four of us want to go and he<br/>
doesn&#39;t and he can&#39;t stay home alone?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about the particular destination. It&#39;s not like<br/>
we&#39;re making him go grocery shopping or something he really hates. We<br/>
don&#39;t make him do that. And when we&#39;ve made him go to something in the<br/>
past, he always says he&#39;s glad to have gone. We can&#39;t let him stay<br/>
home alone yet. And there&#39;s only one friend&#39;s house he&#39;d like to go to<br/>
and honestly, I just don&#39;t feel right asking them each time we want to<br/>
go somewhere if they can take him.<br/>
<br/>
And I admit it hurts my feelings that he doesn&#39;t want to come with us.<br/>
It makes me feel terrible. I wish he wanted to come. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;d appreciate any advice you all have.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
Liz</div>

Discuss it with her as you did with us.  Offer cash.  Or offer a  <br/>

Are those times when one of you is out with the other kids the only times<br/>
he has one on one time with a parent, alone? <br/>
<br/>
Could he be needing personal, close time with you or his dad, alone?   If<br/>

that will help. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not really. There are lots of times during the day where he asks his<br/>
Dad to play legos or computer with him. And I&#39;d do stuff with him if<br/>
he asked me but he rarely does. I offer to play games and read and<br/>
stuff, but mostly he wants to either play the computer or play legos,<br/>
and doesn&#39;t think of me to do either.<br/>
<br/>
It feels to me more of a control thing. That he hates being forced to<br/>
do things and that if there is any whiff of forcing, he immediately<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do it. But that&#39;s not the only part. He really doesn&#39;t<br/>
like to go out and do stuff as much as others might.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts. (And also for your lists, I love them! We<br/>
had a Deb Lewis-inspired bonfire in an igloo the other day. Thanks!)<br/>

like he&#39;s forced to do it and so that makes him even MORE likely to  <br/>
strongly resist and to get angry when he feels pushed about it, right?<br/>
<br/>
I know a family (maybe still on this list) whose older girls really  <br/>
wanted to go go go and younger brother really did not. They honored  <br/>
his desire to stay home by holding a LOT more activities at their own  <br/>
house and by finding rides with friends for the girls so that mom  <br/>
could stay home more with the younger brother.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be careful about making him feel he has to fight to live his life  <br/>
in a way that suits him. Instead, make it an automatic part of life  <br/>
that you honor his interests.<br/>

Let him have his way so much that he&#39;s willing to let other people  <br/>
have their way.<br/>
If it feels at ALL like a control thing, he needs more control, not  <br/>
less.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t take it personally.  It sounds as though you&#39;re expressing your  <br/>
own hurt feelings about him not wanting to do things with you.<br/>
<br/>
He will be generous with you later on, if you&#39;re generous with him  <br/>
now.  If you try for 50/50 now (what seems to you like 50/50) you&#39;ll  <br/>
end up with little to nothing later, I&#39;m thinking, going by the good  <br/>
and the bad relationships I&#39;ve seen.<br/>

Q:We do alot of things together as a family because it&#39;s just what we  <br/>
do...we don&#39;t offer them the choice to not participate with family/ <br/>
household responsibilites - it&#39;s not really questioned, it&#39;s just  <br/>
what we do.<br/>
<br/>
By relinquishing the desire to control, you help your child onto the  <br/>
path of living mindfully themselves, making choices and decisions  <br/>
mindfully and deliberately, instead of reactively.<br/>
<br/>
How would you react if the lack of choice *were* to be questioned one  <br/>
day? Would your subsequent actions be likely to enhance or detract  <br/>
from your relationship with your children?<br/>
<br/>
You are assuming that given the choice the children would never  <br/>
choose to help. The lists are full of stories of children  <br/>
spontaneously helping, doing unasked cleaning or tidying as gifts for  <br/>
their parents, doing *more* than the children with externally  <br/>
directed chores ever offer or do.<br/>

live his life the way he wants, but it&#39;s also true that he doesn&#39;t<br/>
live alone. There are five of us. We have made a big effort,<br/>
especially in the last year or so where it has gotten more clear that<br/>
he wants to be home, to really try and accomodate his wanting to stay<br/>
home. Dh and I do split up often, we have been experimenting with him<br/>
staying home alone for short stretches of time, we try to keep the<br/>
dragging along to other people&#39;s stuff to a bare minimum. But his<br/>
desire to stay home directly bumps up against other people&#39;s desire to<br/>
go out. If one of us has to stay home with him, that means we don&#39;t<br/>
get to do what we wanted to do (and the other kids don&#39;t get our<br/>
company). <br/>
<br/>
Or if there&#39;s only one parent available, it can mean that he&#39;s<br/>
controlling whether dd8 gets to go to her activities or not. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem right to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But what about the other kids in the family? His controlling the<br/>
situation sometimes means they don&#39;t get any control. It doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
fair. They&#39;ve already conditioned themselves to go along, to some<br/>
extent, with what he wants because he&#39;s very forceful and demanding.<br/>
It&#39;s easier for them to go along. That doesn&#39;t seem right to me either.<br/>
<br/>
And I wish, I wish we could talk about stuff, but in the moment, it&#39;s<br/>
almost impossible to talk to him. While I&#39;m trying to figure out if<br/>
there&#39;s a way to make it more palatable, or trying to figure out if<br/>
there&#39;s a part that he doesn&#39;t like in particular that we could get<br/>
rid of, he&#39;s yelling &quot;I&#39;m not going. Shut up!&quot; Sometimes I try &quot;you<br/>
don&#39;t have to go (for real), but could you tell me why you don&#39;t want<br/>
to go&quot;. I still get &quot;shut up&quot; or nothing.<br/>
<br/>
After the moment, he doesn&#39;t bring it up. He goes on about his life as<br/>
if nothing happened.<br/>
<br/>
If I try to talk about it, we either go right back to the &quot;shut up&quot;<br/>
parts, or he&#39;ll say &quot;I&#39;m really sorry about what happened&quot;, which is<br/>
certainly less abrasive, but mostly feels to me like a gentler version<br/>
of &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about this&quot;. I don&#39;t need or want him to say<br/>
he&#39;s sorry, I just want to know more about the situation and what<br/>
bugged him about it. Is it just going out of the house? Is it going to<br/>
that particular place? Is it driving there? Is there any way to make<br/>
any of the icky parts better so that the rest of us could go?<br/>
<br/>
It also feels sometimes like he speaks a different language. Says<br/>
things that he knows aren&#39;t true, almost daring me to get into an<br/>
argument about those things. (&quot;The car is too cold.&quot; &quot;I could put on<br/>
the heat.&quot; &quot;No, the heat doesn&#39;t work.&quot; (except it does)) Where it<br/>
gets to arguing about a provable fact, I don&#39;t say anymore. It feels<br/>
like more control stuff. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is an interesting point and want to think about it more,<br/>
but right now it feels about 95/5, if that. I can&#39;t think of anything<br/>
we make him do except go places sometimes (once last week, I think).<br/>
Well, we don&#39;t let him yell mean stuff at his sisters or hit them or<br/>
throw stuff at them. But that&#39;s about it. We don&#39;t make him do chores,<br/>
we don&#39;t make him do schooly stuff, we don&#39;t make him eat stuff he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to, we mostly don&#39;t make him go out if he doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to, we do let him play on the computer and play legos as much as he<br/>
wants. We play games with him and read to him when he asks. What else<br/>
could he control that we&#39;re not letting him?<br/>
<br/>
When is it enough? I feel like he has everything he wants, except for<br/>
having to go in the car sometimes (but not all the times) when he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to, and that&#39;s still not enough. And it doesn&#39;t seem fair<br/>
to his sisters or to dh and me. It feels like he&#39;s taking advantage. I<br/>
feel controlled.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i just wanted to chime in a bit here.  when my son was younger, he was <br/>
much more open to having new and different people in our home than he is <br/>
now.  as much as he is resistant to *going & doing*, he prefers that to <br/>
having his home invaded and his things touched by others.  adults are <br/>
less of a threat to him since he can go off into his own space until <br/>
he&#39;s ready to interact AND they tend to be less interested in his <br/>
belongings. ;)<br/>
<br/>
that having been said, by honoring him most of the time and trying to <br/>
find new ways of going about satisfying the rest of our social needs, i <br/>
find that he is much more willing to go along with us and trust that it <br/>
will be a good time.  and when it isn&#39;t, we don&#39;t feel obligated to <br/>
stick with the experience...we just go home!<br/>
<br/>
i also thought it would be a nice idea for my eldest daughter (almost 8) <br/>
to be able to go off to friends&#39; homes and play without the rest of us, <br/>
but she&#39;s been uncomfortable with that idea as well.  she prefers to <br/>
have the security of me or her father there in case things stop being <br/>
fun and she&#39;s too embarrassed to ask to call home.  so i need to honor <br/>
that as well.  i&#39;m sure you can imagine the difficulty in honoring the <br/>
needs/wants of all the different individuals in our home...it is <br/>
definitely a balancing act, to say the least. :)<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m sure as the kids grow and expand more these issues will be a lot <br/>
easier to move around, but right now it is a rough thing to work <br/>
through.  we are all doing the important work of stretching and growing <br/>
and learning how to be generous and compassionate (among other things) <br/>
with one another.  it&#39;s not easy, but it&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>amen! :)  and when you do, i think you&#39;ll find that open-mindedness and <br/>
flexibility beget open-mindedness and flexibility. :) <br/>
<br/>
i see expanding my son&#39;s world as as much of my responsibility as <br/>
honoring his desire to stay home and just *be*.  of course, it needs to <br/>
happen in ways that i think will be enjoyable for him (based on many <br/>
previous experiences), and i myself need to remain open to the fact that <br/>
he still may not have a good time and be willing to cut things short, <br/>
but i recognize that my son tends (much like myself) to feel stuck and <br/>
not know what to do to relieve that feeling.  some people do need a <br/>
gentle, loving push to get things shaken up a bit...i don&#39;t know if that <br/>
fits for the OP, but it does in our life. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549693945">&lt;&lt;Not really. There are lots of times during the day where he  asks his<br/>
Dad to play legos or computer with him. And I&#39;d do stuff with him  if<br/>
he asked me but he rarely does. I offer to play games and read  and<br/>
stuff, but mostly he wants to either play the computer or play  legos,<br/>

That he hates being forced to<br/>

like to go out and do stuff as much as  others might.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
************************************************************************<br/>
This keeps hanging in my mind.... I have four children ages 14 to 22  months. <br/>
 <br/>
I think you said your little boy is 4. At age 4 and the youngest  (or 2nd to <br/>
youngest) brings on new growth and independence. At 3-4 they see the  older <br/>
siblings going and doing and they come to realize they too want some of  that <br/>
control also. A stage or passage onto the next gear in their growth.<br/>
 <br/>
In smaller families those changes may not be as vocal. In larger  families a <br/>
toddler will seek to be their own person and if it  takes getting vocal about <br/>
it so be it until it&#39;s clear as mud.  <br/>
 <br/>
Computer and Lego&#39;s can be his way of shutting everyone out/his own thing  he <br/>
controls.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s four (still a little guy) and at times it can be difficult to balance  <br/>
everyone. He will come round in time but he needs to finish his quest to be  <br/>
heard, understood and his own person. Until then I would consider talking to the <br/>
 older ones and explaining his feelings. Maybe the older ones can help him <br/>
make  cookies or shop for Lego&#39;s or something that he may ask for or do. The <br/>
idea is  to get there before he gets upset or feels out of control. If he reaches <br/>
that  frustration level too many times it will be a much longer span of time <br/>
until he  feels better about his options.<br/>
 <br/>
With the age differences things can turn into &quot;me and them&quot;  ..that can be a <br/>
challenge to overcome those feelings.<br/>

It might just make you angry to hear that, as though I&#39;m not reading  <br/>
what you&#39;ve written.  I am.  But as you&#39;ve cast it all in terms of  <br/>
control, I have to think you&#39;re not seeing that the concept of  <br/>
control is limiting your thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t be the age he is forever.  People say that and it&#39;s simply  <br/>
true, BUT... if his needs aren&#39;t met he WILL stay in that same state  <br/>
of neediness.  So you could extend his &quot;problem&quot; (what you&#39;re seeing  <br/>
as a family-debilitating problem) by not dealing with it where it is,  <br/>
when it is.   And by &quot;dealing with it&quot; I don&#39;t mean to try to change it.<br/>
<br/>
If there was something absolutely clearly physically wrong with your  <br/>
son so that he couldn&#39;t go (think extreme... he&#39;s on machinery, or in  <br/>
a full body cast or something) you would make arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
If you find a babysitting situation and give him a choice of that or  <br/>
going with you, he might want to go with you instead.<br/>
<br/>
If you just go without making a big deal and then tell good stories  <br/>
about it, he might be more tempted to go the next time.  If you&#39;re  <br/>
being negative before you leave he&#39;ll be less likely to want to go  <br/>
with you.  If you&#39;re negative when you get back (with messages like  <br/>
&quot;You should&#39;ve gone&quot; and &quot;I wish you&#39;d been there&quot; and &quot;You really  <br/>
missed something&quot; he will feel criticized on both ends of the  <br/>
outing.  If you can manage to be sweet and positive before and sweet  <br/>
after, you&#39;ll be a more inviting possibility for him.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re just talking about it all too much.  Maybe he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
KNOW why he doesn&#39;t want to go, and so it&#39;s not that he doesn&#39;t want  <br/>
to tell you, it&#39;s that he just doesn&#39;t KNOW why.  That&#39;s okay.  Let  <br/>
him not know.  Don&#39;t press him to explain it.<br/>
<br/>
It seems maybe your fantasy view of the whole family doing something  <br/>
together is being wounded, and you&#39;re taking it personally.   <br/>
Yesterday Keith invited all of us to go out to a Chinese buffet.   <br/>
Holly didn&#39;t want to go, and so I said I would stay with her.   Kirby  <br/>
didn&#39;t want to go.  I tried to press him to go and then thought  <br/>
better of it so gave him the counter arguments that made it a fair  <br/>
decision again.  Keith and Marty went and had a good time.  I could  <br/>
have case the whole thing in a negative light and pressed Kirby and  <br/>
Holly to go, but that would not have added to the positive tone of  <br/>
the afternoon.  As it was, it cost only 2/5 of what it would have  <br/>
cost, and everyone who did go ate and had fun.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s movies you&#39;re talking about, rend more DVDs.  If it&#39;s food,  <br/>
bring fancy take-out.<br/>
<br/>
If your husband goes out with the other kids, find the GOOD parts of  <br/>
that, and be sweet when you stay home, instead of martyrly.  Live  <br/>
through this stage of your lives gracefully and generously.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And it doesn&#39;t seem fair to his sisters or to dh and me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fair&quot; isn&#39;t a good measure.<br/>
Happy is better.<br/>
Everyone can be happy at once if you focus on how to be happy.<br/>
Everyone can be UNhappy if you shine the spotlight on your frustration.<br/>

<br/>
My son Andrew has always been like this, but became more-so at about<br/>
age 7, due to anxiety and stress from going into unknown/unfamiliar<br/>
places, places he hadn&#39;t been before or that were loud and confusing<br/>
or might be crowded, etc.  New experiences would bring on stomach<br/>
pains, tantrums, crying, meltdowns.<br/>
<br/>
At first we didn&#39;t understand why these things were a problem for him,<br/>
and we weren&#39;t unschooling at the time, so I am ashamed to say we<br/>
tried bribing, forcing, cajoling, teasing, punishing, and nothing<br/>
worked.  We thought him as being difficult, stubborn, naughty, ugh!  <br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness (but not soon enough) we learned about unschooling and<br/>
mindful parenting, and gave him complete and total control over when<br/>
and where and how long he goes out and about.  And it wasn&#39;t until<br/>
then, and he matured a bit more, that he was able to explain why those<br/>
things were so hard for him.  <br/>
<br/>
The more we talked to him, the more we realized that for this kid, he<br/>
didn&#39;t have the ability to take past experiences and project what a<br/>
new experience might be like, or even apply it to a similar but<br/>
slightly different experience.  It was like he was always walking<br/>
through a fog bank, with no bearings and no idea what was in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
We told him he didn&#39;t have to do anything he wasn&#39;t comfortable doing,<br/>
and we would invite him to go but never make it mandatory.  Often I<br/>
would stay home with him because I missed my boy so much.  <br/>
<br/>
I would bet it was about a year after we gave him control over that<br/>
area of his life before he started saying, &quot;I think I would like to go<br/>
to the hobby shop&quot; or &quot;Can I go to the grocery store with you?&quot;  And I<br/>
would honor that and take him, and bring him right back home again, no<br/>
extra errands thrown in.  Once he was comfortable with that, it<br/>
expanded some more to maybe two or three stops.  And then going to<br/>
friends&#39; houses.<br/>
<br/>
This past weekend he went to a huge Halo2 party, and a friend spent<br/>
the night before at our house.  All big changes from the way it was,<br/>
because he was allowed to make those decisions himself.<br/>

<br/>
Talking in the moment is no good.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is saying &quot;shut up&quot; or saying nothing,  the mom has said  <br/>
too much.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to him between times, and when you&#39;re not emotional or needy  <br/>
about his responses.  Or maybe even see if there&#39;s someone else he  <br/>
will talk to about it--your husband or one of the siblings.<br/>

rest of us could go?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ask him what would make HIM  comfortable.  Don&#39;t remind him (again)  <br/>
that he needs to make the rest of you happy.<br/>
<br/>
It seems your attention isn&#39;t on what will help him have a happier  <br/>
life, but on the ways in which his happiness is an unfair burden on  <br/>
the rest of you.  You&#39;ve cast him as a bad guy.  He probably doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want to be a bad guy at all, but being told he is he&#39;s more likely to  <br/>
act that way.<br/>
<br/>
Most kids go through a stage of saying no.   Try not to do things  <br/>
that will prolong that need to say no.<br/>

People who sit in the front of the car where the heat is really warm  <br/>

as well in the back.  That heat passes through cold from the engine  <br/>

him, then take a blanket and when he gets in, give him the blanket  <br/>
nicely, generously, and say &quot;Here, in case it&#39;s cold today.&quot;  Give  <br/>
him the option to be warmer in such a way that it&#39;s not another  <br/>
struggle between you and him.<br/>
<br/>
If it seems he speaks a different  language, learn to speak his  <br/>
language.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what you claim he knows isn&#39;t true is him trying to communicate  <br/>
with you that his feelings are NOT your feelings.<br/>

Many times when I was a kid and told my mom that I was hungry, she  <br/>
said &quot;You&#39;re not hungry,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;ve never been hungry a day in your  <br/>
life&quot; or &quot;You can&#39;t be hungry, you just had lunch two hours ago.&quot;     <br/>
I wasn&#39;t saying something I knew wasn&#39;t true.  I wasn&#39;t daring her to  <br/>
get into an argument with me.  She just wanted life to be fair, and  <br/>
she had been a kid during the depression and so she wanted to remind  <br/>
me (born in the 50&#39;s) that my life was better than hers, and that  <br/>
wasn&#39;t fair.  She wanted to &quot;win&quot; in the &quot;will you feed me?&quot; moment  <br/>
and say &quot;No, I won&#39;t.&quot;   But it wasn&#39;t just that she didn&#39;t want me  <br/>
to have food.  She wanted me to feel bad for asking.<br/>
<br/>
If anything you&#39;re doing with your son is even the SHADOW of what my  <br/>
mom did, please cease and desist.  Back away, far away, and try to  <br/>
come at the relationship from a whole different angle.<br/>

controlling whether dd8 gets to go to her activities or not. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem right to me.**<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Liz --<br/>
<br/>
Does more warning help?  (For example if he needs to come to the end of <br/>
his lego project or finish a level in his computer game.)<br/>
<br/>
What about making the waiting time during sister&#39;s activity really, <br/>
really fun.  Have you already been doing that?<br/>
<br/>
Some parents buy the &quot;trailing&quot; kid a Gameboy for playing during <br/>
sister&#39;s dance lessons (for example).  But if you have 5 kids, that&#39;s a <br/>
lot of dollars.  But borrowing one for a couple of weeks from someone <br/>
who doesn&#39;t use theirs much might fly.<br/>
<br/>
I have a husband and a son who really really like to stay home.  Since <br/>
he doesn&#39;t have any siblings (my son, I mean) we just stay home a lot.  <br/>
Now that he&#39;s 11, he stays home when I do nearby errands and short <br/>
outings.  And yeah, sometimes I wish he would come with me.  Now that he <br/>
has a choice, the percentage of times he wants to come to the grocery <br/>
store is about zero.  Sometimes I wish he thought coming to the store <br/>
with me would be a thrill, but he doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**(&quot;The car is too cold.&quot; &quot;I could put on<br/>
the heat.&quot; &quot;No, the heat doesn&#39;t work.&quot; (except it does))**<br/>
<br/>
The heat on my car doesn&#39;t work the first couple of minutes when the <br/>
engine is cold.  Could that be what he means?  Or is it really colder in <br/>
the backseat than in the front?<br/>
<br/>
**It feels like he&#39;s taking advantage.**<br/>
<br/>
Were you forced to do a lot of things as a kid?  Does it seem like he <br/>
has a sweet deal (compared to you) and does that make you feel some <br/>
rivalry or jealousy?<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

If both parents go but one is willing to walk the kid out or to a  <br/>

places. He wanted to stay home with his things - his lego, computer  <br/>
games, bike, skateboard, etc. THAT was his interest and he had almost  <br/>
no interest in anything outside the house.<br/>
<br/>
She did everything she could to honor that desire on his part. It DID  <br/>
restrict her ability to go out. She made arrangements - she WORKED at  <br/>
it because it seemed important.<br/>
<br/>
He is an outgoing VERY sociable 16 year old, today. He is most  <br/>
definitely not even remotely a &quot;homebody&quot; - not by any stretch of the  <br/>
imagination.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants to stay home 99 percent of the time, but mom makes  <br/>
him go 20 percent of the time, that is going to feel, to HIM, like  <br/>
his needs don&#39;t count, like he is being coerced, like his needs and  <br/>
wants are being discounted in favor of his siblings&#39;. And it is going  <br/>
to feel like he is at risk of being coerced into going at any time -  <br/>
on his mother&#39;s whim. AND it is going to seem, to him, like he hasn&#39;t  <br/>
made a big enough deal out of it - hasn&#39;t communicated how MUCH he  <br/>
REALLY doesn&#39;t want to be forced to go.<br/>
<br/>
 From Mom&#39;s point of view it is going to seem like she&#39;s &quot;letting  <br/>
him&quot; stay home 80 percent of the time - way more than meeting him  <br/>
halfway. When he doesn&#39;t see it her way, and pitches fits - actively  <br/>
resists - she can feel taken advantage of and controlled, or she can  <br/>
choose to see that this is TRULY important to him and she can see the  <br/>
fits and resistance as his &quot;only&quot; way of communicating how important  <br/>
this is to him.<br/>
<br/>
There are options - it isn&#39;t a matter of everyone has to be stuck at  <br/>
home because one young child doesn&#39;t want to go. But, yes, it might  <br/>
very well mean that the vision the mother has of the whole family  <br/>
going out to do things together has to be scrapped. It is MOM&#39;s  <br/>
vision, not the son&#39;s. I know how annoying it can be when our own  <br/>
visions, which would be SO wonderful if everybody else would just  <br/>
recognize it and go along with the program, are not shared by our kids.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest making a LONG list of options - brainstorm with the whole  <br/>
family. NO idea is too outlandish, no censoring of ideas, no saying  <br/>
anything is too expensive or not workable. Just list EVERY possible  <br/>
idea - try to get a hundred of them down on paper. One will lead to  <br/>
another. Then pick your top 10 or 20. Keep that list on the  <br/>
refrigerator and when he says he doesn&#39;t want to go - together you  <br/>
can look at the options and together decide which one to pick.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that some options will include him going, but getting  <br/>
something in return. Other options will include nobody going. There  <br/>
will be some options where only he will stay home - give him this in  <br/>
fantasy, at least. And many will include some people going and some  <br/>
staying home.<br/>

away from HIS activities. Just because his activities are at home and  <br/>

I&#39;m not saying it is easy - I&#39;m saying that there is an underlying  <br/>
attitude that he is trying to take advantage of you. But kids do not  <br/>

He is trying to get his needs met.<br/>
<br/>
I have three kids and I KNOW about how the youngest does get dragged  <br/>
away from at-home activities to take older kids to their scheduled  <br/>
activities. Been there; done that. I&#39;m not discounting the  <br/>
difficulty. But you can&#39;t appeal to his sense of fairness - that  <br/>
isn&#39;t developed enough AND it comes with feeling fairly treated.<br/>
<br/>
You told us about his behavior and it sounds like he&#39;s &quot;speaking&quot;  <br/>
loud and clear - but you don&#39;t want to hear what he&#39;s saying because  <br/>
it is too hard. You have my sympathy about the &quot;hardness&quot; of it.<br/>
<br/>
You can make him go in spite of his resistance. You can tell him,  <br/>
over and over, that you&#39;re being fair to only ask him to go some of  <br/>
the time. You KNOW how to do that. Or you can take a deep breath and  <br/>
remember that you brought the issue here and you&#39;re getting ideas and  <br/>
responses from people who have experience, aren&#39;t currently stuck in  <br/>
the situation and so can possibly think more clearly, with more  <br/>
detached perspective. You can ignore the ideas or you can take a leap  <br/>
of faith and try them out. Watch for a little success - do more of  <br/>
what seems to work for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for people here to say that he&#39;s not being fair and  <br/>
you&#39;re right to feel he is trying to take advantage of you -- I don&#39;t  <br/>
think that would be useful in helping you better meet your family&#39;s  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685799488">My 11yo dd is a homebody too.  She has never done well in unfamiliar places and like your son I tried courcing her to go places before I became a unschooling mom.  Now, if she doesn&#39;t want to go, depending who needs to run the errand, either me or dh goes.<br/>
   <br/>
  I give her complete control on any exhibits, museums or other places to go around town.   I&#39;m always offering, but often she says no and I respect that.  We are going to the Live and Learn conference in Sept as a family.  dd has already said she will spend her time in the hotel room on the computer or in the pool with her dad.  We said fine, do what you feel most comfortable doing.<br/>
   <br/>
  We have been only unschooling since April 05, so she still have controll issues and I will honor that.<br/>

My son Andrew has always been like this, but became more-so at about<br/>
age 7, due to anxiety and stress from going into unknown/unfamiliar<br/>
places, places he hadn&#39;t been before or that were loud and confusing<br/>
or might be crowded, etc.  New experiences would bring on stomach<br/>
pains, tantrums, crying, meltdowns.<br/>
<br/>
At first we didn&#39;t understand why these things were a problem for him,<br/>
and we weren&#39;t unschooling at the time, so I am ashamed to say we<br/>
tried bribing, forcing, cajoling, teasing, punishing, and nothing<br/>
worked.  We thought him as being difficult, stubborn, naughty, ugh!  <br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness (but not soon enough) we learned about unschooling and<br/>
mindful parenting, and gave him complete and total control over when<br/>
and where and how long he goes out and about.  And it wasn&#39;t until<br/>
then, and he matured a bit more, that he was able to explain why those<br/>
things were so hard for him.  <br/>
<br/>
The more we talked to him, the more we realized that for this kid, he<br/>
didn&#39;t have the ability to take past experiences and project what a<br/>
new experience might be like, or even apply it to a similar but<br/>
slightly different experience.  It was like he was always walking<br/>
through a fog bank, with no bearings and no idea what was in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
We told him he didn&#39;t have to do anything he wasn&#39;t comfortable doing,<br/>
and we would invite him to go but never make it mandatory.  Often I<br/>
would stay home with him because I missed my boy so much.  <br/>
<br/>
I would bet it was about a year after we gave him control over that<br/>
area of his life before he started saying, &quot;I think I would like to go<br/>
to the hobby shop&quot; or &quot;Can I go to the grocery store with you?&quot;  And I<br/>
would honor that and take him, and bring him right back home again, no<br/>
extra errands thrown in.  Once he was comfortable with that, it<br/>
expanded some more to maybe two or three stops.  And then going to<br/>
friends&#39; houses.<br/>
<br/>
This past weekend he went to a huge Halo2 party, and a friend spent<br/>
the night before at our house.  All big changes from the way it was,<br/>
because he was allowed to make those decisions himself.<br/>

about him when I read the original post.<br/>

Something that has helped when we need him to come with us is finding a <br/>
way to work his intersts into whatever trip we make.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes its asking him to bring in his Foxtrot books to read to me in <br/>
the car, or telling him that we&#39;ll pretend medieval stuff or Star Wars <br/>
stuff on our outing.  He makes up characters for me and I play them <br/>
while we&#39;re out.  If we ask him to come on a hike, he says &quot;No way!&quot;  <br/>
If we ask him to go come play Star Wars on the rocks at the beach, he <br/>
grins and comes along.   <br/>

What is he into?  Ask him how you could make it fun for him, or at <br/>
least tolerable.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not coercive.<br/>
If persuasion is coersion, no one can morally ask another person to  <br/>
go on a date, or make cookies, or share the couch.<br/>
<br/>
If you make him an offer and he understands what&#39;s going on and he  <br/>
accepts the offer, that&#39;s not coercion.<br/>

If you disguise force as choice, or if you give him two really ugly  <br/>

lot from my middle daughter who is now 13 and at times she&#39;ll still be less  <br/>

and well traffic can be bad at all times of the day. The stopping and going  <br/>
gives her a headache and nausea and other times even if where we&#39;re going is <br/>
15  to 20 minutes away she many times doesn&#39;t want to go. Now I make sure that  <br/>
she sits up front most of the time and it helps but not completely. When she <br/>
was  little I moved her booster seat to the middle of the backseat so she <br/>
could  see where we were going.  Now we try to plan a lot of things  either here <br/>
or close to the house. It also helps the keep her mind occupied  while driving <br/>

or drained, it&#39;s so hard to not revert to a little whiny &quot;oh poor me&quot; <br/>
refrain.  Betsy said something helpful to me the other day when I was <br/>
whining about this on another list, that I should probably recognize that <br/>
I&#39;m depleted right now and need to find ways to nourish myself and then <br/>
I&#39;ll be able to be more giving to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think so many of us grew up being told we were asking for too much that <br/>
it&#39;s hard for us to recognize our own needs.  And then we wind up short and <br/>
impatient with our kids because we&#39;re annoyed that our own needs aren&#39;t <br/>
being met - and not because they&#39;re in direct contradiction to our <br/>
children&#39;s needs.  That&#39;s too narrow a way to look at it.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve gone through this before where I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s this big <br/>
contest as to who gets what they want - me or the kids or even me or my <br/>

more care of myself.  Not that that&#39;s easy, but the shift in perspective <br/>

<br/>
Oh, me too.  Just this week there was a moment when I told Marty and  <br/>
Holly I was feeling unappreciated and maybe they needed to figure out  <br/>
when I wasn&#39;t in the mood to be made fun of.  But I just hit that  <br/>
point, said so, and didn&#39;t dwell there.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible for people to just start identifying themselves as  <br/>
&quot;unappreciated&quot; and looking for evidence that they&#39;re &quot;right&quot; that  <br/>
they&#39;re being abused by evil others, and that feeling starts to feed  <br/>
on itself.<br/>
<br/>
For me, saying &quot;Sheesh, I&#39;m feeling whiny&quot; and then taking a few deep  <br/>
breaths, starting the washing machine (and thinking of how much  <br/>
better it will be when people have their favorite clothes ready) and  <br/>
starting the dishwasher (and thinking of how much better it will be  <br/>
when Kirby has his favorite cup and the cheese grater is clean and  <br/>
there&#39;s room for people to make sandwiches) is way more helpful than  <br/>
thinking bad thoughts about other people and feeling that I&#39;m not  <br/>
only whiny, but I SHOULD be whiny, and they should do their own  <br/>
laundry and dishes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think so many of us grew up being told we were asking for too  <br/>

it&#39;s hard for us to recognize our own needs.-=-<br/>
<br/>
One of my mom&#39;s insults that I forgot to include when Ren and I were  <br/>
exchanging mom messages in the talk in St. Louis was this:<br/>
<br/>
You have expensive tastes.<br/>
<br/>
That insult didn&#39;t start until I was fourteen or so and commented on  <br/>
having the cheapest of all socks, clothes, shampoo...   My mom  <br/>
could&#39;ve spent more on everyday things if she didn&#39;t need to spend so  <br/>
much on cigarettes, coffee and beer.  So she chose to blame me for  <br/>
&quot;having expensive tastes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about that this morning, and it might be worth turning  <br/>
into an article.   A kid who&#39;s never seen a Dorling Kindersley book  <br/>
might be more impressed with Little Golden Books.  Once someone has  <br/>
tasted Godiva chocolate, they might be more unhappy with those cheap  <br/>
little things in foil at Easter.   Should we deprive kids of quality  <br/>
things so they&#39;ll be happier with the bottom of the range?<br/>

do something really nice for him (whether he knows it or not) and  <br/>
remind myself that we&#39;re partners, and his happiness is going to add  <br/>
to my happiness.  It doesn&#39;t work in every single case but it&#39;s  <br/>
generally better than the alternative.<br/>

A Beneful commercial on TV just now (Beneful is a kind of dry dog  <br/>
food) has the guy being all sweet with his puppy, and the voice says  <br/>
&quot;You just *think* you&#39;re getting spoiled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What would THAT mean!?<br/>
<br/>
You just think I&#39;m giving you something especially good?<br/>
You just THINK you&#39;re better than other dogs?<br/>
You  just THINK you wouldn&#39;t like other dogfood now?<br/>
<br/>
And... would dogs even think about &quot;being spoiled&quot;? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

&gt; That insult didn&#39;t start until I was fourteen or so and commented on<br/>
&gt; having the cheapest of all socks, clothes, shampoo...   My mom<br/>

&gt; much on cigarettes, coffee and beer.  So she chose to blame me for<br/>
&gt; &quot;having expensive tastes.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was thinking about that this morning, and it might be worth turning<br/>
&gt; into an article.   A kid who&#39;s never seen a Dorling Kindersley book<br/>
&gt; might be more impressed with Little Golden Books.  Once someone has<br/>
&gt; tasted Godiva chocolate, they might be more unhappy with those cheap<br/>
&gt; little things in foil at Easter.   Should we deprive kids of quality<br/>
&gt; things so they&#39;ll be happier with the bottom of the range? </span></blockquote></div>
