<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500138545">Just wanted to introduce myself to this group.  I just joined and <br/>
have just recently....(officially last Sept).come to declaring my <br/>
children&#39;s and my families independence (for that matter) from <br/>
the &quot;norm&quot;.  I am ashamed to say that I was unaware of the RU or just <br/>
plain home schooling option....so I dutifully sent my two wonderfully <br/>
DD off to preschool and than elementary school and secretly I was <br/>
bitter, jealous and very sad to be away from them for so much of the <br/>
day.  About a year ago I became aware of a large home schooling sec <br/>
in my area....and it was truly a light bulb moment...you mean I can <br/>
legally take my children out of school...  OMG really.... where do I <br/>
sign-up !  I spent the rest of the school year education myself on <br/>
everything and all homeschooly...methods, my state laws ect.  I am <br/>
blessed  and not so blessed to live in an area,  with a large <br/>
population of and acceptance of HS.  So when I went public with our <br/>
announcement we did not get hit with the text book Knee Jerk <br/>
reaction......&quot; Your going to do what!&quot;...but instead it was....&quot; <br/>
what curriculum are you going to use&quot;.  Problem, I had no interest in <br/>
curriculums...or schooling at home. I have a degree in Early <br/>
Childhood Education...so I have a fairly good working knowledge of <br/>
how children our by nature.... natural and curious learners. So, <br/>
unschooling, made the most sense for us.   We are still very much in <br/>
the Deschooling stage.... especially  DH,  myself and oldest DD<br/>
(9)...she was been in a schooly situation since the age of 3.  But we <br/>
are happily tugging along so willing to embrace our new freedom from <br/>
the statis quo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-854696499">Sandra, could you please explain what plain english would be for RU? <br/>
Would it be Radical Unschooling or is that still unacceptable, if so <br/>
what words do you use to describe the concept that is often called <br/>
RU/radical unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
My son is very interested in words and where they came from, who was <br/>
the first person to use the word...that kind of thing. As new things <br/>
are being invented we come up with new words, right? The word <br/>
internet or &quot;net&quot; as many of us call it, did not exist before 1982, <br/>
now I would call it plain english wouldn&#39;t you. What&#39;s the <br/>
difference? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-118968686">-=-Sandra, could you please explain what plain english would be for RU?<br/>
Would it be Radical Unschooling or is that still unacceptable, if so<br/>
what words do you use to describe the concept that is often called<br/>
RU/radical unschooling. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
On this list, unless we&#39;re contrasting what we do to what others call  <br/>
unschooling, it&#39;s &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s bad enough that outsiders will have to ask you &quot;What is  <br/>
unschooling?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you refer to &quot;RU&quot; and they as &quot;What&#39;s RU?&quot;  (and the fact that it  <br/>
sounds like &quot;are you&quot; makes it more irritating and off-putting), and  <br/>
you say &quot;Radical Unschooling,&quot; then they still have to ask &quot;What&#39;s  <br/>
Unschooling?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-The word internet or &quot;net&quot; as many of us call it, did not exist  <br/>
before 1982, now I would call it plain english wouldn&#39;t you. What&#39;s  <br/>
the difference? -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;net&quot; has existed for over a thousand years.<br/>
<br/>
To call the internet &quot;the net&quot; is a shortening that&#39;s only  <br/>
appropriate when the people you&#39;re dealing with know what you&#39;re  <br/>
talking about.  If you&#39;re talking to a grandmother who has no  <br/>
computer, to talk about reading about RU on the net wouldn&#39;t even be  <br/>
polite.<br/>

Tell him not to believe everything he reads on the internet.  There&#39;s  <br/>
some blatant nonsense that goes around by e-mail about the origins of  <br/>
terms and phrases.<br/>

There are some stories and links there for people interested in the  <br/>
history of words.  It&#39;s one of my favorite things ever.  When I was  <br/>
nine, I started buying books when I could.  They were usually cheap  <br/>
paperbacks, but two of my earliest purchases were a dictionary and a  <br/>
book of word origins.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see your point.  I was, poorly using the term in my intro..to <br/>
mean..the expansion of this choice in my parenting relationship with my <br/>
two girls. <br/>
Which... acutually from birth and lots of tuning out of my MIL and <br/>
Mom&#39;s voices(and lots of outstounding coaching from my LaLeche <br/>
group)...I have always tried to be more on the peaceful/joyfull side of <br/>
parenting. Respecting my children and thier needs.   Again I guiltfuly <br/>
admit...prior to our plunge....I imposed bed times....made desicion for <br/>
the sake of peace and time and had food control issue. ( this is a big <br/>
one from my childhood ) Regarding food I thought I was doing <br/>
good...cause I wasn&#39;t repeating my parents control...but I see <br/>
that...by not buying certain foods, making comments about what and how <br/>
much they should or shouldn&#39;t eat was...ugh guilting them....I was in <br/>
fact doing them a great disservice. But, I am a believer in when you <br/>
know better..you do better.<br/>
<br/>
My quandary and I remind all that my DD(9) Liv is very much still in <br/>
heavy deschooling mode and surely testing us in all her new found <br/>
freedoms...seems to have taken on more of an aurthitative role when it <br/>
comes to younger sister(7)Lex..she bosses her around has little to no <br/>
patience for her and even gets physical with her..swatting/pushing her <br/>
in announace...We never hit/spanked our children... I try to get to the <br/>
root of the problem engage them in different activities...talk to each <br/>
of them sepertatly about thier feelings..give them ideas of how the <br/>
situtation could have been handled. How do I address  her anger <br/>
properly?  She&#39;s very self consious,self pitting and in her <br/>
words &#39;jealous..she see herself as always geting the shorter <br/>
stick...and again her words &#39;unlucky&#39; .  These are all such real <br/>
feeling I&#39;m trying very hard to validate them...but fear that I&#39;m not <br/>
doing such a good job...as this behavior that  started a few month ago <br/>
continues.  An example this past weekend I took DD&#39;s and friend of <br/>
Liv&#39;s to Hanna Montana Dance Party thrown by Radio Disney. Liv is a big <br/>
fan. They had a contest..and long story short Lex won two front row <br/>
tickets to Hanna Montana concert..of course they both went to the <br/>
concert and had a wonderfull time. But she can&#39;t seem to let go of how  <br/>
unfair it is to her that Lex won. So we had a long talk about luck and <br/>
how some seem to have it more than others...same as stenghtens/talents <br/>
in people..but it&#39;s rooted more I think in jeolusy or better yet <br/>
needing more.  <br/>

Did you declare &quot;do whatever&quot; instead of giving her increasing  <br/>
numbers of &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; yes answer?  A hundred yesses is happy.   <br/>
One big &quot;do whatever  you want&quot; isn&#39;t so happy.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Find things that make her happy, things you can do with her that  <br/>
don&#39;t involve her sister.  Help her get more attention and focus  <br/>
somehow, not as a time to talk about a younger sibling, but just to  <br/>
*be.*<br/>

<br/>
 From that statement, it seems you&#39;re saying you assured her that Lex  <br/>
might always have more luck, and that she might be right, that she  <br/>
might be unlucky.  Maybe playing some dice games would help her think  <br/>
about random factors in life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If she needs more, try to give her more.  Find interesting,  <br/>
distracting, engaging, surprising things for her to see, smell,  <br/>
touch, taste and hear.<br/>

<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>
<time> 9 Jan 2008, at  2:27am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799042173">When things get rough here the best time for me to deal with it is when things are good. When someone is hurt and upset and lashing out, all I can do in that moment is make sure that no one is getting hurt, that everyone is safe, and to give the person who feels so bad, so angry the space and comfort and whatever else they need until there is calm again.  Try and come up with things that you can do to meet Liv&#39;s needs when she isn&#39;t angry or upset or bossing around her sister. Spend more time with her, play games, listen to music, dance to The Best of Both Worlds with wigs on, be more playful, more involved, more present. <br/>
<br/>
I imagine that the deschooling time is a time of feeling a bit lost and a bit unsure of what is expected. It is probably also a point of intense boredom. Having been defined by someone else&#39;s limits for so long it must be hard to figure out something to do without help or input. There is a difference between recovery from school and getting antsy and bored and you have to be aware enough to catch the transition. Not that you should approach it with a top down &quot;gonna give you something to do if you can&#39;t figure out what to do&quot; sort of approach. Unschooling is time intensive. Parenting is time intensive, really, but school and daycare go a long way toward buffering parents from the time they need to invest in their children. Once you&#39;ve given up those sorts buffers it is you who must give that time. <br/>
