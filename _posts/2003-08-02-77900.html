&gt;My husband taught himself calculus and logic from his mom&#39;s college<br/>
&gt;textbooks because he was bored and had completed all the honors courses<br/>
&gt;his hs had to offer.  It was interesting to him and he also studied<br/>
&gt;philosophy this way and had much joy using it arguing with his teachers<br/>
&gt;all day.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I don&#39;t know what else to say but that his interests *will* lead him<br/>

&gt; &gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There&#39;s no reason why it can&#39;t.   For example, if he becomes<br/>
&gt; &gt; interested in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Physics, and he find he needs Algebra, he&#39;ll learn it to help him<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; Physics.  I like that example because I failed Algebra twice in HS,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but got straight<br/>
&gt; &gt; A&#39;s in Physics, all I needed was context to help me understand it.<br/>

&gt;I took freshman english in college 2 times.  The first time was with a<br/>
&gt;very precise assignment oriented professor.  I failed miserably.  The<br/>
&gt;second time I took it with a really laid back lady who encouraged us to<br/>
&gt;just start writing, skip words, rewrite words over when we got stuck on<br/>
&gt;a thought, don&#39;t bother scratching out mistakes - she called it free<br/>
&gt;writing.  We would then take that first draft and put it into more<br/>
&gt;organized form.  I find now that I do best when I start this way too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What kind of choices do you have for vax, home birth,  and organic food<br/>
&gt; &gt; regulation etc?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Vax are optional, at least in BC.  Midwives are covered by our medical <br/>
&gt;plan,<br/>
&gt;but they&#39;ve been saddled with a lot of unnecessary regulations.  There&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;lot of politics around all that right now.  My daughter had one homebirth<br/>
&gt;before midwives were licensed, another with a licensed midwife, and another<br/>
&gt;where they called the midwife half an hour after baby was born.  &lt;g&gt;  I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know too much about the regulation of organics here, but I know there<br/>
&gt;are certification groups.<br/>
&gt;Tia<br/>
&gt;ps I find it ironic that you asked these questions.  My daughter&#39;s first <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;favourite midwife is Heather Hall.  &lt;g&gt;  My Heather was so disappointed <br/>
&gt;when<br/>
&gt;that Heather moved away.<br/>

&gt; &gt; idon&#39;t think Nelson is as bad as the okanagan for spray, and there are <br/>

&gt; &gt; cool unschoolers all over that place. Maureen knows one family in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rossland.Nelson is the one place i would like  to live. Very funky!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One thing that really bothered my daughter about Nelson (She lived there <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;several years) was the number of women there who would attachment-parent <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;a couple of years, then leave the child with the dad or someone else and go<br/>
&gt;off to have some fun or find herself or whatever for months at a time.  I<br/>
&gt;guess she ran into a lot of women who did that.<br/>

&gt;Subject: BRAGGIN&#39; RITES!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this summer finds you all well!  I know I&#39;ve promised and promised to<br/>
&gt;write this, but, due to some crazy circumstances, I just haven&#39;t been able <br/>
&gt;to.<br/>
&gt;First the computer &quot;blew up,&quot; then my cable modem went out (as it would be,<br/>
&gt;right in the middle of trying to write this letter the last time, and <br/>
&gt;before I<br/>
&gt;could hit send).  But, OH well, that&#39;s life, and now I FINALLY HAVE THE <br/>
&gt;CHANCE<br/>
&gt;TO SHARE ABOUT MY DAUGHTER&#39;S AWESOME FORTUNE!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To begin with, tomorrow she gets to leave for an AWESOME, probably once in <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;lifetime trip.  Before I say just where, I do want to extend my thanks (not<br/>
&gt;because I am sending this to anyone there, but because I hope you will all <br/>
&gt;find<br/>
&gt;new found respect for them) to the Cincinnati Museum Center and their Youth<br/>
&gt;Volunteer Program.  If it weren&#39;t for them, this trip wouldn&#39;t even be <br/>
&gt;possible<br/>
&gt;for my daughter.  I hope if you live in & around Cincinnati, you will visit<br/>
&gt;their wonderful Museums & look into the program for your own teens (13 <br/>
&gt;years and<br/>
&gt;up).  If you don&#39;t live here, I hope if you come &quot;passing thru&quot; you&#39;ll <br/>
&gt;decide<br/>
&gt;to stop for a while (if you do, let me know, my DD, may be able to help you<br/>
&gt;out with some free tickets).  Mostly, I thank Don Whittrock & assistant <br/>
&gt;Arden;<br/>
&gt;they are the ones who chose my daughter for this.  I also thank our <br/>
&gt;anonymous d<br/>
&gt;onors!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK, DO I HAVE YA WONDERING YET, LOL?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tomorrow afternoon (Saturday), she&#39;s living for Red Lodge, Montana near<br/>
&gt;Billings, Montana (think Yellowstone, National Park).  While she&#39;ll get to <br/>
&gt;visit<br/>
&gt;Yellowstone, her main reason for being there is to go on a REAL DINOSAUR <br/>
&gt;DIG<br/>
&gt;(LOL, Cheryl, & you didn&#39;t even realize this when you sent the e-mail today <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt;&quot;never being on a REAL Dinosaur Dig).  All of this was made possible by an<br/>
&gt;anonymous donor to the Museum Center, who donated ENOUGH MONEY to send 8 of <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;youths from the youth program.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;12 were asked to write 4 essays & 1 THANK YOU letter to the Anonymous <br/>
&gt;Donor.<br/>
&gt;(The kids did have to be at least 16 to do this.)  They (Don and Arden) <br/>
&gt;ONLY<br/>
&gt;chose those who they thought would be best suited for the trip.  Of the 12,<br/>
&gt;they had to narrow it down (through the essays & thank you letter) to the 8 <br/>
&gt;who<br/>
&gt;are going.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My daughter is SOOOOO PSYCHED!  They fly out tomorrow afternoon!  ALL IS <br/>
&gt;PAID<br/>
&gt;FOR; FLIGHT, FOOD, LODGING, THE DIG, EVERY ASPECT!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Me?  Well, LOL, I&#39;m so happy for her, but at the same time a bit freaked <br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt;by the fact that she&#39;ll be flying AGAIN w/out me (then, LOL, you DON&#39;T want <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;be on a plane w/me, either...unless you have me heavily drugged).  Plus, it<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t like when she went to Washington, DC this past winter (though I was<br/>
&gt;freaked out about that too); at least I could have gotten there in under 12 <br/>
&gt;hours<br/>
&gt;drive time, and who knows, an hour, maybe 1 1/2 tops by plane).  This is A <br/>
&gt;LOT<br/>
&gt;FARTHER away from me than DC!  But, I&#39;d never even try to stop her from <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;trip.  This is a once in a life timer for most of us!  I&#39;d never be able to<br/>
&gt;afford this trip, so she is one lucky kid, and a great essay writer!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BUT, WAIT:  OH YEA, THERE&#39;S MORE!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most of you know my daughter wanted to work at Paramount Kings Island<br/>
&gt;Amusement Park (PKI) last year (she was only 15 then, and I told her I <br/>
&gt;really wanted<br/>
&gt;her to be a &quot;kid&quot; for one more summer; she listened and did).  She came to <br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;in early spring, before PKI opened and asked me to take her to the park to<br/>
&gt;fill out the application.  Beings that she WAS 16 by then AND it was the <br/>
&gt;2nd year<br/>
&gt;in a row she asked, I knew she was serious.  (My one and only &quot;requirement&quot;<br/>
&gt;was that she had to stick w/it since it was just a seasonal job; that&#39;s our<br/>
&gt;rule, you start something, you finish it.)  Well, she&#39;s absolutely LOVED <br/>
&gt;the job<br/>
&gt;and the job absolutely LOVES her!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All summer, they were giving her responsibilities above and beyond what <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;give &quot;most&quot; associates; especially her age.  A few weekends ago, she was <br/>
&gt;told<br/>
&gt;by another supervisor, that the following day, they were going to put <br/>
&gt;Kaycee<br/>
&gt;with one  Supervisors in Charge of one of the mid to large sized picnics <br/>
&gt;(1000<br/>
&gt;- 2000 people).  She was required to pre train those who volunteer there,<br/>
&gt;&quot;place people&quot; in positions she thought would suit them best, schedule <br/>
&gt;breaks,<br/>
&gt;lunches, & suppers, and write end of picnic reports (all the while, <br/>
&gt;watching,<br/>
&gt;supervising, etc., & helping the workers).  She MUST HAVE DONE WELL!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At the end of the night, her supervisor (the MAIN ONE) HANDED HER an<br/>
&gt;application for a Forman position for next year (they&#39;d start training her <br/>
&gt;this year).<br/>
&gt;  IT&#39;S REALLY GOOD NEWS when the Supervisor HANDS YOU that application.<br/>
&gt;Anyone who&#39;s been there once season can apply, but to have it handed to <br/>
&gt;you,<br/>
&gt;without going to the office yourself, says a lot!  And, I must say, PKI <br/>
&gt;does pay<br/>
&gt;well.  She doesn&#39;t make minimum wage (but, I think it&#39;s good even when kids <br/>
&gt;do<br/>
&gt;make Minimum wage; they still learn to work).  On top of the great pay (for <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;kid), she gets a free membership to the park, free food while working, 1/2 <br/>
&gt;off<br/>
&gt;food when not, free tickets for friends, (I&#39;d say family, but we always buy<br/>
&gt;season passes, well except for my brother & his family).  PLUS, she gets a <br/>
&gt;40%<br/>
&gt;discount on ALL PKI Merchandise.  She also gets other perks like discounts <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;other local amusements, like canoeing, dining out, etc.  They also have <br/>
&gt;&quot;after<br/>
&gt;hours PKI ASSOCIATES ONLY&quot; work parties where the supervisors run the <br/>
&gt;rides,<br/>
&gt;and they get to ride and eat all the junk food they can.  That lasted until <br/>
&gt;1 or<br/>
&gt;2 am, late, but in a &quot;safe place.&quot;  I can&#39;t say they don&#39;t work those who<br/>
&gt;will hard.  They do, but it is GREAT practice for the future, I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ll keep you posted on that one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do need to hit the bed, there are a few more things for us to do BEFORE <br/>
&gt;she<br/>
&gt;leaves early afternoon.  Please say your prayers for a safe return, and a<br/>
&gt;fun, educational trip!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And, LOL, THANKS for listening to me go on and on about my daughter, but,<br/>
&gt;geezsh, who just couldn&#39;t w/all this news?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Take Care, & I&#39;ll keep ya&#39; all posted!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tracy<br/>
&gt;PS:  IF SOME OF YOU GOT DOUBLE. TRIPLE, QUADRUPLE, OR MORE OF THESE, I&#39;M<br/>
&gt;SORRY, I COULDN&#39;T IN MY EXCITEMENT REMEMBER WHO IS/ISN&#39;T IN CERTAIN GROUPS <br/>
&gt;(NOT TO<br/>
&gt;MENTION IN MY E-MAIL ADDRESS BOOK MORE THAN ONCE FOR WHATEVER REASON).  SO,<br/>
&gt;SORRY ABOUT THAT!<br/>

&gt;Freewriting is the centerpiece of what I teach. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Peter Elbow popularized the term in his famous work Writing<br/>
&gt;with Power and most colleges now teach it (The Allyn and Bacon<br/>
&gt;Guide to Writing comes to mind). It&#39;s kind of obvious to anyone<br/>
&gt;who writes naturally that you can&#39;t edit your thoughts when you sit<br/>
&gt;down to write. Anything you get on paper can later be crafted and<br/>
&gt;tweaked. But the funny thing is, non-writers don&#39;t know this. So<br/>
&gt;they have to be let in on the big secret: Psst. Get it all out, even<br/>
&gt;the stuff that seems unrelated. Then later go back and cut and<br/>
&gt;paste until you like it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;B&lt;&lt;ut is he reading from interest, or is he<br/>
&gt;reading Chapters 1-3 type thing?  I find that my son recalls just fine when <br/>
&gt;he&#39;s interested, but when he pressures himself to finish or read a certain <br/>
&gt;thing, he just has no retention. &gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I find the same - for me and my sons! lol!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last year, one of my sons read through a Physics and a Chemistry text that <br/>
&gt;were on our shelves. He read through them just because he was ( is) <br/>
&gt;interested in science and he liked the clear explanations in these books.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He was following his interests and thus, has retained more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When he got to parts that he felt he didn&#39;t quite grasp, he asked me <br/>
&gt;questions,. I know little about science but I found that, if I asked him to <br/>
&gt;read aloud the section he was pondering, then I was able to help him break <br/>
&gt;the explanation down into little bits. He then *got* these little bits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think that unschooling is the only way this son can really get into <br/>
&gt;science, on his own schedule. One of his older brothers is into manga and <br/>
&gt;gaming and does the same amount of reading for his interests. They are both <br/>
&gt;learning through unschooling - high school age or not...Leonie<br/>

&gt;Tracy,<br/>
&gt;     What an opportunity and fun trip! Safe travels. We really like Museum<br/>
&gt;Central too. I like the outside (it looks like an old fashion radio)<br/>
&gt;architecture. The place is a blast. I&#39;ll have to email you the next time we<br/>
&gt;come down from Columbus. :-)<br/>

&gt;in a world that is doing its best, night and day,<br/>
&gt;to make you like everybody else.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Volunteer Program.  If it weren&#39;t for them, this trip wouldn&#39;t even be<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; for my daughter.  I hope if you live in & around Cincinnati, you will <br/>
&gt;visit<br/>
&gt; &gt; their wonderful Museums & look into the program for your own teens (13 <br/>
&gt;years<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; up).  If you don&#39;t live here, I hope if you come &quot;passing thru&quot; you&#39;ll <br/>
&gt;decide<br/>
&gt; &gt; to stop for a while (if you do, let me know, my DD, may be able to help <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; out with some free tickets).  Mostly, I thank Don Whittrock & assistant <br/>
&gt;Arden;<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are the ones who chose my daughter for this.  I also thank our <br/>
&gt;anonymous<br/>

&gt;Congratulations!   My three yr. old dinosaur obsessed son is watching one <br/>
&gt;of the Walking W/ Dinosaur BBC specials next to me.  We just read a book <br/>
&gt;about the discovery of the Maiasaura (nest and baby and adults) in Montana! <br/>
&gt;  They talked about a children&#39;s section of the site where kids actually <br/>
&gt;discovered some of the bones.  They mentioned the exhibit being in Bozeman. <br/>
&gt;  Is she part of the Maiasaura dig?  I love Maiasaura.  The name means <br/>
&gt;&quot;good mother&quot;.   I told my 3 yr. old, Jesse, about your daughter and he was <br/>
&gt;really excited.  Good for her.  Let us know how it went when you hear.<br/>

Two more things you need to know.  First, when you&#39;re replying to the digest<br/>
version, it&#39;s nice to change the subject line so people will know what the<br/>
actual subject is.  Also, you need to delete the rest of the digest before<br/>
sending your reply.<br/>
