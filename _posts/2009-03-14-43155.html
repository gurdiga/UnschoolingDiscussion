<br/>
There&#39;s an UNSCHOOLING Conference this Sept in San Diego!!<br/>
<br/>
Good Vibrations Unschooling Conference<br/>
Sept 10-13, 2009<br/>
Doubletree Hotel near Del Mar<br/>
<br/>
EARLY BIRD REGISTRATION ENDS IN LESS THAN 6 WEEKS!!<br/>
<br/>
Start a new tradition--Be here for our inauguration--Start making memories! Be<br/>
a founding family of the Good Vibrations Unschooling Conference.<br/>
<br/>
This is your opportunity to mix it up with other unschoolers in a swirl of<br/>
trust, support and celebration! Our fabulous speakers are ready to inspire with<br/>
radical thoughts, ideas to end resistance and wisdom to make your unschooling<br/>
life the best that it can be. I can feel the energy and excitement already as I<br/>
picture the day at the beach, the wildly entertaining talent show, the dancing,<br/>
the funshops, round-table discussions, unschoolers happy and free, kids trusted<br/>
and loved! It will be amazing! And it&#39;s right in your backyard. Did I mention<br/>
the beach, lounging by the pool? And surfing lessons? Yeah, those, too.<br/>
<br/>
All the exciting details are here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://GoodVibrationsConference.com">http://GoodVibrationsConference.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m especially excited about Roya Sorooshian. She&#39;s a grown unschooler who will<br/>
be one of our main presenters- an absolute delightful person who is living a<br/>
joyful, productive and busy life! Come see what unschooling looks like when<br/>
it&#39;s all grown up. :) And her mom, Pam Sorooshian will be speaking, too,<br/>
sharing the wisdom she&#39;s gleaned through her many years of unschooling. Other<br/>
speakers include Jeff Sabo, Miranda Demarest, Rain Fordyce, Beth Fuller, Erika B<br/>
Perkins and Sandra Dodd, all ready to deliver positive, inspiring unschooling<br/>
messages. You will be refreshed and renewed!<br/>
<br/>
My favorite funshop? Hard to choose. Team Twilight? HSM Dance Party? <br/>
Knitting? Oh, I know- International Candy Tasting!<br/>
<br/>
This conference is where you&#39;ll pick up lots of good vibrations and a lots of<br/>
unschooling friends. We can never have enough, right?<br/>
<br/>
So head on over today to join us in the sun and sand at the discounted rate.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and don&#39;t forget to reserve your hotel room, too. And join the discussion<br/>
group to get in on the chatter.<br/>
<br/>
See you in September!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689828152">I am scheming to go to San Diego for sure.  Please tell me some of the best<br/>
sights one can see there (besides the gloriously beautiful town that is) and<br/>
some good highlights for people who live back East and have no idea what the<br/>
place is like, other than what pictures and movies and music can tell.<br/>
<br/>
I have a nephew who lives about an hour from Vegas, NV and I am hoping we<br/>
can go see him and maybe some other folks too.  :)  Don&#39;t know when but<br/>
hopefully around that same time (Sept) or so.<br/>

These questions would be better asked on the list for discussing the  <br/>
conference, since most of the people on this list won&#39;t go.   Even  <br/>
though I&#39;m excited about this conference and will be speaking there,  <br/>
and I&#39;ll have a new book ready for those who pre-purchased it and all  <br/>
good stuff, I&#39;d rather not discuss local/regional/particular-event  <br/>
things on Always Learning.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is so much to do that we could spend all our time from now until <br/>
then talking about it. This is my home &quot;town&quot; - (Southern California) <br/>
and I really love it here.  What you choose to do is going to depend a <br/>
lot on your family&#39;s interests. There are the obvious places - Sea <br/>
World, San Diego Zoo, Wild Animal Park, Legoland, beaches galore! <br/>
Weather at that time of year is almost always very sunny and warm -- <br/>
typical temperature range for september is about 67 to 78 degrees (low <br/>
to high). Warmer inland - so the Wild Animal Park, for example, would <br/>
likely be up into the 80&#39;s or even the 90&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
In San Diego - with kids:<br/>
<br/>
Beaches -  there are so many gorgeous beaches - you can have a bonfire <br/>
in the evening, too.<br/>
<br/>
Balboa Park is absolutely gorgeous - there are a bunch of different <br/>
gardens to go walk through that are all free and there is a large <br/>
cluster of great museums - I think there are actually about 15 museums. <br/>
The science museum &quot;Fleet Museum&quot; has an astronomy group that sets up <br/>
telescopes on the first Wednesday night of each month (which would be <br/>
the week before the conference, if you&#39;re there that early). Some of the <br/>
museums have some free days on Tuesdays. There are free organ concerts <br/>
in Balboa Park on Sundays. The whole park is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Tijuana, Mexico, is great for a quick half-day visit to a foreign <br/>
country - it is maybe 40 minutes or so from the conference location. You <br/>
can take a Gray Line tour or just go on your own and walk around looking <br/>
in shops, etc. You DO need some ID - if you don&#39;t have a passport you <br/>
need a US or Canadian drivers license plus either a birth certificate or <br/>
green card (there are lots of other options). Kids need a birth <br/>
certificate.<br/>
<br/>
Legoland has homeschool days  on Mondays - it is a HUGE discount. <br/>
Regular price is $63/$53 (adults/kids) and we get in for $17 on <br/>
homeschool Mondays. You have to ask for the discount more than two weeks <br/>
ahead of time - you do it online and one week before your date you can <br/>
download your coupon that is good for up to 6 people.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot more right there in san diego - but you might also want <br/>
to go up the coast a little to see other beaches or go out to the desert <br/>
(google Anza Borrego) to see a little of that or up to Los <br/>
Angeles/Hollywood (I really really like Universal Studios a lot) and, of <br/>
course Disneyland is only an hour and a half away.<br/>
<br/>
There is truly no better place in the world for a family vacation - I <br/>
LIVE here and I can&#39;t get enough of it. Unschooling paradise!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry - got excited and posted without thinking where this was going --- <br/>
but, maybe it&#39;ll get some others excited enough to join us!!! I HOPE <br/>
lots of people do - it is such a wonderful place. Plan to stay a week or <br/>
two! At least!<br/>
