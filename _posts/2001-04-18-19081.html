<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032259767"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Hi everyone. . . I just joined the list yesterday and have spent some time 
<br>looking at some of the archives to get a feel for things. I wanted to give a 
<br>short intro and a comment on this subject since it touches me so much.
<br>
<br>My name is Mary. . .I live in suburbs of Philadelphia. I have a 12 year old 
<br>daughter and a 21 month old son. My daughter, Lelia has been a self-directed 
<br>learner most of her life. (she attended school by her own choice twice). I 
<br>was a single mom while unschooling her until about 3 years ago. I have had 
<br>several different careers in my life and right now I am on hiatus from 
<br>working outside of the home. I love gardening and cooking, and being with my 
<br>family.
<br>
<br>On the subject of Down&#39;s and abortion. . . my belief is that down&#39;s children 
<br>bring many gifts to the people they come to. I have had communication with a 
<br>soul that I might bring birth to and both my husband and I have seen her in 
<br>visions we have had of her with down&#39;s. It would be a privilege for me to 
<br>give birth to her and have the experience of knowing her and sharing in the 
<br>gifts she would bring. I think the fear of the unknown is what some people 
<br>may experience in trying to avoid having a child like this. Fear of something 
<br>different. . I don&#39;t know. I guess everyone has their own issues and 
<br>challenges to overcome. . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just believe that we tend to have a &quot;throw 
<br>away&quot; society. . . we (as a society) throw out that which is damaged, and to 
<br>me this ties into that mentality.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118733260">I have known several people with Down&#39;s Syndrome and agree that they have<br/>
been a particular joy.  However, there is a side to this issue that I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen anyone address.  DS folks sometimes suffer very severe<br/>
health issues.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not familiar enough with the subject to outline them but I&#39;ve spoken<br/>
with a few parents who have suffered along with their children through<br/>
years of pain, doctors, surgeries and even death.  It&#39;s not always just a<br/>
matter of mental issues.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not condoning abortion, mind you.  I just wanted to bring this aspect<br/>
of the condition to mind.<br/>
