<h4>Ticia</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345944565">Since I actually have 2 free hands and am actually able to respond to some posts lately I will post my introduction.<br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
I&#39;m Ticia and Mommy to my 2 kiddos Chloe (4) and Raiden (11mos). We live in Orange County, CA. My parents are from Nebraska and New Mexico and my husbands parents are from Liberia. We are a cultural soup of sorts :). We enjoy camping, doing crafts of all sorts, trying new things and trying out new perspectives at this point...well I do anyhow ;).<br/>
<br/>
I believe strongly in unschooling as far as my experience with the definition has taken me. I have faith in my children&#39;s ability to live life fully...even if it *is* a challenge to my natural tendencies to be quite overbearing (hey, I&#39;m a work in progress). <br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking on this list for a couple of months now and have been enlightened in so many ways as well as had many things to say, but I have a nursing 11mo old who doesn&#39;t allow me much time to respond lately. I talk to my screen a bit too much to be sane ;)<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to post an introduction that has turned very wordy for such an inarticulate person such as myself who has terrible grammar and no sense for expression through the written word :)...give me a palette damnit!! lol!! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making it so far...goodnight and I look forward to getting to know some of you.<br/>
<br/>

Grown-ups never understand anything for<br/>
themselves, and it is tiresome for children <br/>
to be always and forever explaining things to them.<br/>
