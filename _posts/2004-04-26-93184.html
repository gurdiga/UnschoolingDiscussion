<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112311855">Hello, Everyone<br/>
  I have enjoyed reading everyone&#39;s posts(GREAT STUFF). <br/>
Frist<br/>
 I remember watching schoolhouse rock growing up, and I loved it I <br/>
know <br/>
it didn&#39;t help me in school, there was never a chance for it to sink <br/>
in. My two boys love it as well,and if it sinks in great if not OK.<br/>
Secondly <br/>
Our family loves to play cards games my oldest son Paul just learned <br/>
to <br/>
play a card game called HAND and FOOT. He has learned to count by 5&#39;s <br/>
10&#39;s and 20&#39;s.<br/>
Last<br/>
I don&#39;t remember what post I read that talked about the elderly <br/>
feeling like a burden. but It brought back some thoughts form the <br/>
closet. When I was growing up my Grandparents were not around. I <br/>
remember listening to conversation with aunts, uncles about why no <br/>
one wanted them to come and live and the excuces we endless. I also <br/>
remember the frustration of my mom trying to find a babysitter for me <br/>
so she could work. It made me feel like i was to much trouble.<br/>
When my oldest son was two we were in a reatarant having dinner <br/>
and,elderly lady was seated next to us. She asked very loudly to sit <br/>
somewhere else because she didn&#39;t want a &quot;figity little kid <br/>
disrupting her dinner&quot;. The hostes told her that <br/>
there were no other tables. She took the table and after about five <br/>
minutes of staring at us she asked how old ect. Then told me how much <br/>
trouble her two boys were and how she wised there were daycare places <br/>
back then like there are now. Trying very hard to be nice and polite <br/>
i asked if her sons visited and the answer was a very angry &quot;No the <br/>
last <br/>
time I saw them they wanted me to go into a home.&quot; At this point I <br/>
had enough, I know I was disrespectful to an edler but enough is <br/>
enough. <br/>
My coment was &quot;Thats the problem with this world we look for others <br/>
to <br/>
raise our children and care for the elderly&quot;. <br/>
Now when my son asks me why we call and visit grandma so much I tell <br/>
him that&#39;s what we do for family we help out, his answer is alway OK <br/>
can I help. My feeling is that the cycle has to stop somewhere why <br/>
not here.<br/>
I&#39;m very sorry for being so long winded but had to get this of my <br/>
chest be for the little one wakes up thanks for listening<br/>
