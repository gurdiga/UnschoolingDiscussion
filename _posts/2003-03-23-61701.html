<div id="ygrps-yiv-628087955">Just some thoughts here, I am not a christian, have developed my own <br/>
spiritual beliefs based on what I have learned from life so far, and it is <br/>
always changing. Is is not true that children learn more from what we do than <br/>
what we say? As one subscriber to this list attached to her posts&quot;What you <br/>
are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say&quot; Emerson.<br/>
It just seems to me that if children witness their parents LIVING what they <br/>
believe, they will be more likely to live similar choices.. I am having <br/>
trouble articulating this. If the choices of TV, reading, media or events are <br/>
limited, how will they ever think to make the choices for themselves? I think <br/>
of Sandra&#39;s chocolate milk analogy, how will they choose white milk if they <br/>
aren&#39;t allowed to have chocolate?<br/>
If a person lives their spirituality and celebrates it and discusses it <br/>
openly, then the child will see that. If they choose not to embrace that it <br/>
obviously does not work for them at that time? <br/>
I think of the Kahlil Gibran writing(I can&#39;t remember what it is called, like <br/>
I said, I need help here!!!) &quot;Your children are not of you, but through you.&quot;<br/>
He talks about them being as arrows shot from our bows. WE give them the best <br/>
send off we can, but they go their own directions. I am just questioning <br/>
here, and my thoughts are far from organized onthis. Can someone else help me <br/>
say it? It just seems like if a parent shelters the child from the world, how <br/>
can the child make the choices to live in a way that is caring, empathic, <br/>
healthy and suited to the needs of that child?<br/>
We assume that the child who is exposed to Animaniacs will become one? <br/>
I will stop now as the rambling begins.Wish I could write down the things in <br/>
my mind after all these posts. <br/>

He talks about them being as arrows shot from our bows.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s from The Prophet:  <br/>
<br/>
And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, &quot;Speak to us of <br/>
Children.&quot; <br/>
And he said:  <br/>
Your children are not your children.  <br/>
They are the sons and daughters of Life&#39;s longing for itself.  <br/>
They come through you but not from you,  <br/>
And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.  <br/>
You may give them your love but not your thoughts.  <br/>
For they have their own thoughts.  <br/>
You may house their bodies but not their souls,  <br/>
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not <br/>
even in your dreams.  <br/>
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.  <br/>
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.  <br/>
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.  <br/>
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with <br/>
His might that His arrows may go swift and far.  <br/>
Let your bending in the archer&#39;s hand be for gladness;  <br/>
For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is <br/>
stable. <br/>

teenager.   My poor dad, who hardly read, was afraid it would be a bad thing <br/>
for me to own, somehow.  He didn&#39;t know Khalil Gibran was Christian and that <br/>
the whole thing was beautifully reverent.<br/>

Elizabeth, and it just occured to me (I am still really forming my philosophy <br/>
around unschooling) that really, no matter your religion or beliefs, if you <br/>
limit your child, they cannot grow to be who they are. I was not singling out <br/>
christians for sure.I simply wondered about that with regards to the posts of <br/>
the last few days.<br/>
I find I learn so much by reading all these dialogues.Thanks again.<br/>

We spend a great deal of time doing comparative-religion <br/>
type &quot;classes&quot;, and have used a variety of books/resources for doing <br/>
this.  I am not Christian -- and my husbands is sort of an <br/>
agnostic/Spiritual-Seeker himself, and my son fully knows this. We <br/>
do not look to the Bible as a resource whatsoever in our <br/>
discussions. If I was going to do that, I&#39;d go back to the earliest <br/>
recorded version (printed in English) to do so, since the commonly <br/>
used version has been rewritten/taken apart a great deal. When we <br/>
get into teaching/discussing Jesus and/or Christianity, we usually <br/>
take a historical/discerning view... and remind our son that not <br/>
everyone in the world is Christian, and that its OK not to be; and <br/>
doesn&#39;t make us any less the good people that we are.  I personally <br/>
think a lot of times children get interested in such out of cultural <br/>
pressure, and the feeling of being &quot;left-out&quot; or the &quot;different <br/>
one.&quot;  I know that has been much of the case where our 6 1/2 year <br/>
old is concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few books for more comparative religious discussions <br/>
and/or spirituality in general:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197898383">Bible schools are usually a lot of fun.  You could contact different <br/>
churches and see when their Bible schools are.  I don&#39;t think the <br/>
Catholic churches usually do Bible schools, but protestant churches <br/>
do.  Bible schools typically have games, crafts, snacks, Bible <br/>
stories, and music.  They usually go all out decorating and sometimes <br/>
even have things like puppet shows too.  I&#39;m partial to Group&#39;s hands <br/>
on Bible school curriculum, so if you find a church that uses that <br/>
Group for Bible school it&#39;s almost guaranteed to be a fun time.  You <br/>
could actually call around to different churches and say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
looking for a church to send my daughter for Bible school this summer <br/>
and I&#39;m looking for someone who&#39;s using Group curriculum for their <br/>
Bible school program.  What program do you use?  Here&#39;s what they <br/>
will be doing if they use Group:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.groupvbs.com/">http://www.groupvbs.com/</a>  Of course <br/>
there are other programs out there that are great too.  One church I <br/>
know does science experiments at their VBS every day.  Another had a <br/>
western theme when we went two years ago.  They taught the kids how <br/>
to square dance, played cool games and made neat crafts.  <br/>
<br/>
Another idea, if you want more to do on your own is to purchase <br/>
Group&#39;s hands on curriculum.  You don&#39;t have to sit down and <br/>
have &quot;class&quot;, you can just use it as a fun resource book.  If you <br/>
have a Christian book store near you, you  could probably find other <br/>
activity books with craft ideas to go with different Bible stories. <br/>
Here&#39;s the page for the group curriculum: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.grouphobc.com/default.htm">http://www.grouphobc.com/default.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s specifically interested in the crucifixion story, sometimes <br/>
churches put on neat Easter plays.  You could call around and see <br/>
what types of Easter programs the different churches are putting on.  <br/>
<br/>
Note that I am NOT supporting being involved in &quot;church&quot;.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s necessary.  You don&#39;t have to attend every week. But for <br/>
cool things to do involving Christianity, especially for kids, <br/>
sometimes church groups put on cool productions and special events.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you tried the Unitarian church, they {tend} to be much<br/>
&gt; different then regular churches and accept people of all faiths<br/>
&gt; {even pagans and atheists}<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we are more unitarian than anything else...  unfortunately there<br/>
weren&#39;t many kids at the nearby uu church, so it wasn&#39;t very much fun<br/>
for us to go to the services.  but i like the music and the<br/>
philopsophy of the uus.<br/>
