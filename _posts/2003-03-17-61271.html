&lt;&lt; Dreaming&#39;s bad, he should finish his work.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was in school...especially during the elementary years, I would often <br/>
get good marks on my report card but in the comments something about me <br/>
&quot;daydreaming&quot; too much would be noted.<br/>
As if it were a BAD thing!! ACK.<br/>
Good thing my parents laughed it off and didn&#39;t punish me, I&#39;d really be a <br/>
wreck today if I&#39;d been forced to quit daydreaming. :)<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
And how would one DO that anyway?<br/>
<br/>
I think the most you could do would be change the daydreams from happy flying <br/>
ponies to murderous revenge daydreams.<br/>
