<div id="ygrps-yiv-747367257">This is a shameless appeal for funds I posted at  unschooling.com the other <br/>
day.  I&#39;ve been meaning to put it at  UnschoolingDiscussion and AlwaysLearning <br/>
too, and ever day I&#39;d forget or be  rushed and put it off.  I have a drawer <br/>
full of tapes and sticks, a BIG jar  of seeds, and a sweet kid who&#39;s going to <br/>
England.  Please consider helping  me out.  Thanks.  <br/>

Holly&#39;s going to England in a month and is being scheduled to do a workshop  <br/>
at HesFes, probably on Tuesday afternoon, a smallish thing, to discuss <br/>
teenagers  and unschooling. She might be talking about her brothers and some of our <br/>
other  unschooled friends as much as about herself. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s going to England to  visit friends she&#39;s known as long as she can <br/>
remember, from here, who&#39;ve lived  there for six years. She&#39;ll get to go to France <br/>
for a wedding while she&#39;s there,  too. <br/>
It&#39;s all very cool, but Keith is in the hospital and Holly is worried  about <br/>
not having any spending money while she&#39;s there, and that&#39;s smaller than  my <br/>
worries about the situation, but... <br/>
<br/>
In conjunction with the news that  this message board will be retired, I&#39;d <br/>
like to sell off the tapes I have, and  Thinking Sticks, and I have morning <br/>
glory seeds I collected from my many vines  last year, too. I&#39;d like to do a <br/>
selling push so that I&#39;ll have money to  transfer to Holly while she&#39;s there <br/>
without having to trouble Keith for it if  he&#39;s still sick, and it would reassure <br/>
Holly to know I have a fundraising plan  for her so she&#39;ll have spending money <br/>
while she&#39;s there. <br/>
<br/>
I have two  tapes available, one on Peaceful Parenting and an intro to <br/>
unschooling, but I&#39;ll  put the details elsewhere for fear of violating policies <br/>
here. I&#39;ll put info  here very soon: <br/>

<br/>
Oh, and HesFes is in SW  England, and is short (I think) for Home Educators&#39; <br/>
Seaside Festival.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
<br/>

That page is all set and ready to go. <br/>
<br/>
Please, if anyone uses the  PayPal link and it has any problems with it, <br/>
please let me know. And if you did  use that, it should take you to a thank-you <br/>
page with other details. Please let  me know if that&#39;s not working. <br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s still in the hospital for at  least three or five more days (maybe <br/>
more, depending on what happens with the  next round of tests, which can&#39;t be <br/>
done for three or five more days). Luckily,  Holly is playing Halo II online and <br/>
being merrily distracted. <br/>
<br/>
And our  clothes dryer broke. I have contracted to buy a used one. I&#39;m not <br/>
just whining  now. It&#39;s an appeal for sympathy (although honestly deserved <br/>
sympathy!! ) and  further sales tallies. <br/>

--------------[Update on Keith 4/18:  He might be out of the hospital  today <br/>
or tomorrow.  He had a CAT scan this morning and things look good  enough to <br/>
send him home.  He&#39;s got a tube and a drain (gross to describe,  so I won&#39;t) <br/>
and is weak and doesn&#39;t eat much, but he might as well lie around  and watch <br/>
good movies at home as lie around and watch bad cable in the  hospital.  At least <br/>
here we won&#39;t keep waking him up to ask if he&#39;s  asleep.   He&#39;s on short-term <br/>
disability and will be out of work for a  while.]<br/>

I&#39;d be willing to just pitch in $5 for Holly&#39;s trip and because a friend <br/>
gave me some Thinking Sticks once, but paypal does not take me to a <br/>
welcome page. Is your paypal your email?<br/>
BTW, how is Keith doing?<br/>

Keith&#39;s home but weak and not eating much.  He slept this afternoon  but said <br/>
he was having woozy weird half-dreams.  Bummer. I thought his own  bed would <br/>
make it all better.  He has fever but not a high one.<br/>
