<br/>
My name is Bronwen, my husband Lon and I have three children- dd 14, ds 10,<br/>

never been in school (dd went to three months of kindergarten)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866515882">Hi Bronwen,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome back :)<br/>
<br/>
I too have recently came back and I welcome you :)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Tami<br/>
&#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me bows<br/>
to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones, our tired<br/>
feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a dimension that is<br/>
more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the &#39;trappings and the<br/>
suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39;<br/>
and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all that, a space for the<br/>
eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>
