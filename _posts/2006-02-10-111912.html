<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021087475">I&#39;ve been giving my kids allowance for awhile now.  No strings.  They get paid on the first of each month, no matter how tight our finances are (and they are plenty tight!).  It is fun to watch them make choices with THEIR money.<br/>
<br/>
Jackie is eager to earn more.  She has done amazingly well with koolaid/lemonade stands, but that is seasonal.  She regularly asks about getting jobs, but there is not a huge job market for 10 year olds.  We pet-sit and she gets a share of that.  She gets some money for birthdays and randomly from her Gramma.<br/>
<br/>
Today I offered to pay the girls for doing some of the daily tasks that I do.  I made it clear they don&#39;t have to participate.  We discussed how some of their friends only get their allowance IF they have fulfilled obligations.  My girls will continue to get an allowance even if they have no interest in these additional tasks.  It is a way for them to earn more money.  They can choose a task or more any day they wish but don&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not looking for Better Homes and Gardens, but my house has gotten to the point where we can&#39;t find things.  I&#39;ve read Punished By Rewards.  I hope I&#39;m not setting myself up for kids who will only do for money.  However, I&#39;m simply overwhelmed with more to do than I can handle.  Some days it seems that too much of my attention is to basic tasks - laundry, meals, general tidying; yet the house is still a wreck.<br/>
<br/>
When I brought up the idea of paying for tasks, Jackie got excited.  We sat and made a list of things that they could do when they want to.<br/>
<br/>
Jackie said that it seems I&#39;m buying time.  We had a nice talk about that.<br/>
<br/>
Have others found benefits or problems with paying their children for household/yard chores?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I paid Roxana to read to Rosie. I used to pay her a nickel per book  <br/>
for the first 20 books (picture books) and then a dime per book for  <br/>
every book past 20 (per day).  Rosie was the third kid and a bit  <br/>
later reader and had what seemed like a bottomless pit of desire to  <br/>
be read to. Roxana read out loud REALLY well - she did voices, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This worked really well for us.<br/>
<br/>
I still read to her, too, by the way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry this isn&#39;t about chores, but it is about the idea of buying  <br/>
time.  We had a discussion last week.  Kirby spent real money on game  <br/>
money.   When I was asking him about it (not in a critical way, just  <br/>
&quot;what do you mean?&quot;), he and Marty were both jumping in to explain.   <br/>
Kirby was pro, and Marty was critical.  Marty talked about it not  <br/>
being fair or right.  I asked whether it would be like buying  <br/>
neopoints (the only you-earn-spendable-points) game I play.  Marty  <br/>
said yes, exactly.<br/>
<br/>
 From Kirby&#39;s point of view, he could earn points by playing the game  <br/>
more, but he&#39;s already working and teaching karate and should be also  <br/>
taking a couple of karate courses each week, but he would rather hang  <br/>
out with his gaming buddies on those evenings.<br/>
<br/>
So from the idea of buying time, he works at the pizza place and uses  <br/>
those &quot;points&quot; in his game.<br/>
It&#39;s not much different, we figured, from buying a special CCG card  <br/>
rather than hanging out for hours (hundreds of hours, maybe) to find  <br/>
it &quot;naturally&quot; in a trade with other card-game guys.  If someone buys  <br/>
a special Magic or L5R card, or whatever, it&#39;s not considered to be  <br/>
cheating.<br/>
<br/>
Keith paid $300 yesterday for a major tune-up on my van, just because  <br/>
the check engine light came on.  Keith&#39;s dad or brother could have  <br/>
done that to their own van; it was points, plugs, timing, clean-up,  <br/>
new filters, adjustments...   Keith could do that, painstakingly, or  <br/>
he could study and practice and learn to do it faster.  But Keith  <br/>
chose to work at Honeywell for &quot;Honeywell points&quot; and spend them at  <br/>
the auto repair shop. &lt;bwg&gt;   He bought time.<br/>

<br/>
When Holly was a baby, I sometimes paid Kirby to play with Marty.  It  <br/>
wasn&#39;t to let Marty play with him, it was to play what Marty wanted  <br/>
to play, at Marty&#39;s speed, Marty&#39;s way.   It was never for more than  <br/>
about a half an hour, and Kirby didn&#39;t have to.  His desire in those  <br/>
days was Ninja Turtle figures, and he was only five and six and seven  <br/>
in those days.<br/>
<br/>
I had never thought about it before, but that might have contributed  <br/>
to  Kirby&#39;s being good at running Pokemon League when he first  <br/>
started working at the gaming shop when he was fourteen.  That&#39;s why  <br/>
they hired him, because he was good at helping the younger kids, and  <br/>
he understood all the intricacies of Pokeman Gymnasium business, but  <br/>
the company would only &quot;count the wins&quot; if a store employee had run  <br/>
the tournament.  So Kirby was given a job, and I used to hear mushy  <br/>
reports from parents and older store employees about how good he was  <br/>
with the kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How do places of business get people to go to work without &quot;bribery&quot;?<br/>
How do you get an auto dealer to give you a car without bribery?<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s supposed to do something anyway and holds out on you  <br/>
until you pay them, that&#39;s a bribe.   If something is not someone&#39;s  <br/>
job or someone&#39;s property and they negotiate for an exchange, that&#39;s   <br/>
commerce, not bribery.<br/>
<br/>
There are some truisms that are spoken without real examination and I  <br/>
think the very vague rules against bribery are right up top there.<br/>
<br/>
In a situation in which a kid is supposed to be absolutely obedient  <br/>
to any spoken whim of the parent, and other parents are advising and  <br/>
encouraging that parent to &quot;demand obedience,&quot; then those advisors  <br/>
and watchers would say &quot;Don&#39;t bribe your child to cooperate, MAKE him  <br/>
cooperate.&quot;  MAKE him go to bed at 8:00, brush his teeth the way you  <br/>
told him to, eat spinach, wear shoes that hurt, MAKE him babysit,  <br/>
fold the laundry, do the dishes, read to his brother.  Don&#39;t  pay him  <br/>
to do what he is &quot;supposed&quot; to do, and what he &quot;ought&quot; to do.<br/>
<br/>
The phrases &quot;ought to&quot; and &quot;supposed to&quot; are so old, and have been  <br/>
recited for so many years (hundreds, in the case of &quot;ought to&quot; at  <br/>
least) without conscious thought that people don&#39;t even think about  <br/>
what they literally mean.  &quot;Supposed to&quot; is kind of easy; you can  <br/>
deconstruct it, and it loses a lot of power.  &quot;Ought&quot; is related to  <br/>
owing and debt.  Obligation.  No choice except dishonor.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not uncommon for families to require children to take care of  <br/>
younger siblings, but it does suggest a situation in which that child  <br/>
is the powerless property of the parent.   If a parent decides to  <br/>
respect the child&#39;s wishes and freedom and still wants him to sit  <br/>
with a younger child and read or play, the older child should be  <br/>
thought of as a free agent, another human.<br/>
<br/>
If you asked an adult friend to take care of your child, would you  <br/>
say &quot;And I&#39;m not going to bribe you to do this, either, just do  <br/>
it!&quot;?    Not a good way to keep friends. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A friend might well *offer* to keep your child sometimes, but if you  <br/>
expected it all the time, or assumed it would be free and at your  <br/>
convenience, that would be asking too much.   So if you look at the  <br/>
situation that way, asking your older child to put his needs aside  <br/>
for your benefit, the &quot;ought&quot; is on your end, and you owe him, rather  <br/>
than him owing you.<br/>
<br/>
Then we can come up against another phrase spoken for generations,  <br/>
and that is &quot;I don&#39;t owe you anything,&quot; which has been spoken by  <br/>
parents to children for a long time, but it&#39;s harsh and mean, and in  <br/>
these days of choice, and in the light of compassion, it&#39;s just not  <br/>
even true.<br/>
<br/>
With over six billion people on the planet, for a parent to expect a  <br/>
child to say &quot;Than you SO much that you brought me into the world and  <br/>
gave me life!&quot; is quite a stretch.  Life can be harsh and painful.   <br/>
There is some difference when the mother has absolutely no choice  <br/>
whatsoever, but in this culture there are lots of ways and times to  <br/>
say &quot;No&quot; and have it be legal and moral, unlike the life 500 years  <br/>
ago of a 14 year old child bride who was quite literally given to her  <br/>
husband by her father and might have four children before she was (by  <br/>
today&#39;s count) grown.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think giving a child something you have in exchange for him  <br/>
doing something he doesn&#39;t owe you to be bribery.<br/>

<br/>
According to Encarta Dictionary &quot;offering bribes&quot; means<br/>
  &quot;the offering of money or other incentives to persuade somebody to do<br/>
something, especially something dishonest or illegal&quot;, so no wonder the<br/>
word/concept has a bad rap in parenting circles. Maybe people who are afraid<br/>
of bribery have the instinctive understanding that the desired<br/>
&quot;good/compliant behavior&quot; might be fundamentally inauthentic and a<br/>
suppression of true needs so it really is persuading a child to do something<br/>
&quot;dishonest&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that offering to pay your child for a job of work is in the<br/>
same league as that kind of bribery. If you would pay another sitter to be a<br/>
companion then surely it is ok to pay someone in the family in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about just saying &quot;Would you like to earn some extra money by .....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think honestly offering to pay a child, with the option to decline, is<br/>
much more empowering to the child than any concept of bribery which<br/>
disempowers by removing choice and creating obligation. Earning is the<br/>
opposite of bribery.<br/>
<br/>
I kinda wish that we could reclaim the word bribery so that every act of<br/>
kindness or expression of thanks doesn&#39;t get tainted with the idea that some<br/>
kind of debt bargain is being made. It makes me feel sad to think that<br/>
people are out there thinking that any time they might come home with a toy<br/>
they are &quot;bribing&quot; their child for good behavior, so they refrain from doing<br/>
it, or do it with strings attached. <br/>
<br/>
I like to give Jayn stuff without expectation or conditions. So far she has<br/>
emphatically refused any kind of allowance. The whole idea distresses her.<br/>
