Hey, Tuck. No we weren&#39;t penalized at all. That was the 1950s and 60s in<br/>
New York State. I think there were enough Jews so that it was acceptable<br/>
to take off without anyone freaking out. They are so uptight here in FL<br/>
too about days off - - I think it has to do with money from the state of<br/>
federal government which has requirements about attendance.<br/>
<br/>
The best time of yeaer though was in the wintertime when it always would<br/>
blizzard and we&#39;d get about 2 weeks off of school while they cleared all<br/>
the roads. IT was great - winter vacation! We were snowed in and my dad<br/>
dressed up in his red hunting suit and went to get bread and milk from<br/>
the store for all our neighbors. I remember the time he fell waayy down<br/>
in the snow off a wall that couldn&#39;t be seen, and had to struggle out<br/>
somehow. The snow was several feet high and covered everything.<br/>
