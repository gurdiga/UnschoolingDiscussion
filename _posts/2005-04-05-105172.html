<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447123014">&lt;&lt;That being said, you took this opportunity to discuss words, language, and<br/>
the sex industry with your children.  Have you considered sharing that fact<br/>
with your father?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (14) wanted to take this on herself, as soon as she heard he&#39;d<br/>
been concerned.  She wrote a follow-up letter to her whole list, apologizing<br/>
to &quot;anyone&quot; (even though it was probably only grandpa who was offended) who<br/>
she may have offended or hurt by sending along what was only a joke to her.<br/>
She also took the chance to say that we had been discussing words and the<br/>
use of language, and that she was really thinking a lot about it (which was<br/>
all true).  She received lots of warm thoughtful and intelligent responses<br/>
from the rest of her list, which continued to enrich the whole conversation.<br/>
<br/>
So, she handled it perfectly (in my opinion), and at the same time<br/>
accidentally presented a great case for unschooling, to anyone capable of<br/>
reading between the lines.<br/>

Hi Amy,<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter certainly did handle the situation with maturity and respect.  She is a wonderful example of unschooling at work.<br/>
