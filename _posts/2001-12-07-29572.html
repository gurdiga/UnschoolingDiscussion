<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887483316">I began home-schooling just this year for my daughter for <br/>
kindergarten.  I do school-at-home, but for many aspects of the <br/>
curriculum I chose, my daughter is bored and I feel if I would have to <br/>
force her to continue, which I don&#39;t want to do.  Unschooling is a <br/>
&quot;theory&quot; that intrigues me, but what is a typical day, week like for <br/>
someone this young.  She is too young to do her own research or plan <br/>
activities around her interests.  I also have two younger children, so <br/>
the preplanned curriculum is helpful to me on those days the other <br/>
children are needing more of my time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
I know a few homeschoolers, but no unschoolers.  Is there a support <br/>
group in the Carol Stream, Illinois area where I could go and interact <br/>
with other unschoolers to see examples of unschooling at work?</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a lot of this boils down to the parents needing to unlearn <br/>
what they were &quot;taught&quot; at school.  Too many people believe that you <br/>
have to learn the same things the same way as everyone else.  Once <br/>
you are past that idea, it gets much easier.  <br/>
<br/>
Really, look at the problems in today&#39;s public schools . . . <br/>
everything is geared (and becoming moreso) toward uniformity.  Every <br/>
kid is supposed to do the same things at the same time in the same <br/>
way.  That concept is a lot of cause of the demise of our public <br/>
school system.  If your child is not dead average in every subject, <br/>
schools are not going to be what works best for them.  And that does <br/>
not even address the &quot;socialization problem&quot; in the schools.  The say <br/>
our kids aren&#39;t properly socialized, have you ever watched what goes <br/>
on in a high school?   It can be barbaric.<br/>
<br/>
And this uniformity is relatively new.  Up until about 75 year ago, <br/>
our schools were one room school houses where multiple age groups <br/>
shared a classroom.  <br/>
<br/>
So, my advice is to stop and look around!  Do you believe what you do <br/>
because it is how you grew up and therefore must be &quot;right&quot; somehow.  <br/>
Have you every really stopped and pondered it all?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually she isn&#39;t too young. She&#39;s been reaseaching and planning (or at<br/>
least persuing) activities around her interests since she was born.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to realize that unschooling *won&#39;t* look like kids persuing<br/>
schoolish activities on their own. Unschooling looks like the way she<br/>
learned to speak English, which was as a side effect of using it to get what<br/>
she wanted. You didn&#39;t care that she was talking about squishy peas and<br/>
poopy diapers ;-) You knew she&#39;d *get* English no matter how she used it.<br/>
<br/>
Kids playing *is* their learning. They play for a reason because *that&#39;s*<br/>
how they learn. :-) It doesn&#39;t look at all like school or learning but it<br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
Help her learn more about what she&#39;s interested in, even if it&#39;s a video<br/>
game or making mud pies. She&#39;ll *use* -- and learn -- the basics because<br/>
they&#39;re basic to living.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might also want to consider just what your daughter would actually be <br/>
learning if she went to kindergarten.   Around here, they learn a bit about <br/>
their communities.  Homeschoolers learn that just by being out of school <br/>
and going out into the community with their parents.  They learn to play <br/>
with other kids.  That&#39;s not too hard to provide, either through <br/>
homeschooling groups (large or small) or with after school classes.  And <br/>
they learn something about letters and numbers.  Kids that age are so <br/>
naturally curious about letters and numbers.  If they aren&#39;t curious yet, <br/>
it&#39;s probably either because they aren&#39;t ready or there aren&#39;t very many <br/>
letters or numbers in their environment.  Both are easy to fix, the first, <br/>
by waiting, the second by changing the environment so that it includes more <br/>
of them.  (Lots of books, counting things, refrigerator letters, books <br/>
lying around, alphabet posters, figuring out how many plates and cups to <br/>
put on the table)  There are tons of things you can do to encourage <br/>
exploration of these things without using curriculum.  The main one is just <br/>
talking about what you&#39;re doing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a first grader and a 4 year old.  What I do when I get an urge<br/>
to teach them is watch them play for awhile.  I can then see that they<br/>
don&#39;t need my help.  *But* I&#39;ve been on this path for some time and on<br/>
lists like this one to help.  At first it was hard to see how they<br/>
were learning &quot;school&quot; things when they played...<br/>
<br/>
Our one typical day is like  this :<br/>
Mondays are our out of the house day.  Megan signed up for nature walks<br/>
and a Spanish for non-reader class.  We leave at 9:30 and get back about<br/>
4.  They play with friends some of the time too - between the classes.<br/>
<br/>
All the other days don&#39;t follow any pattern.  This week my daughter <br/>
decided that we were having a mushroom party on Tu. so she made a lot<br/>
of mushroom shaped pictures, a picture of a mushroom princess.  We also<br/>
went walking outside to see what types we could find.  The past few<br/>
days we&#39;ve been doing lots of Lego (math), reading and artwork.  On Momday<br/>
I copied some pages out of books for them - things I knew they&#39;d like.<br/>
So we have dot-to-dot dinosaur pages and mazes all over the living room<br/>
floor now.  We saw albino redwood trees on Monday and so we&#39;ve had<br/>
some interesting discussions about why they were white.  We are planning<br/>
on taking my DH to see them this weekend!<br/>
<br/>
They have several PBS shows they like (Reading Rainbow, Sagwa, Zooboomafoo,<br/>
Clifford).  Going to the store with me is an opportunity to learn more<br/>
about our community.  Sometimes we see police or fire vehicles and we<br/>
talk about them.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-581224415">My kids aren&#39;t quite that old, but they&#39;re great at planning their own<br/>
activities--my 4-year-old regularly asks me to get him his train set, and my<br/>
nearly-two asks to go on a merry-go-round.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, kids rarely plan their own workbooks and phonics lessons,<br/>
but they do ask what signs say, or ask you to read them a book, or ask what,<br/>
why, or how. Remember, too, that watching you interact with the little ones<br/>
is important social (interpersonal) studies.<br/>

never heard of such a thing all those years I grew up there.<br/>
