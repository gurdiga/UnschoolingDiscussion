     I agree with what you said about civil disobedience.  I also would flee <br/>
the state if they were going to put my child in one of those camps, <br/>
particularly under these circumstances.  But his parents are not in a <br/>
position to do so.  They are also probably going to have to rely on the <br/>
public defender as his attorney.  I&#39;m afraid he will be just another number <br/>
to the public defender.  There are other kids with similar situations whom he <br/>
is representing and they are all being handled similarily.  He also asked <br/>
whether his stuttering and words delay was real or &quot;just an act.&quot;  He said, <br/>
&quot;you know how these kids are.&quot;<br/>
     I also feel it is outrageous.  I think I mentioned that this is a first <br/>
offense for him.  How can anyone think that he&#39;s going to come out of that <br/>
camp better or that this is a good thing for our society?  I really am <br/>
bothered by the tie-in between the school district, police, and courts in <br/>
Lancaster.  I question whether it is constitutional because I don&#39;t see a lot <br/>
of due process in many of their procedures.  Parents are given tickets when <br/>
their kids violate the rules (dress code, being late to class, missing too <br/>
much school, etc.) and they just have to pay them.  Worse, this is a <br/>
community that has been hit hard by recession and tends to have a lot of <br/>
families on low incomes who lack the resources to fight this.<br/>
     I don&#39;t know exactly how to get the word out on this.  I even tried <br/>
contacting the ACLU because I thought they looked at cases that they felt <br/>
were constitutional violations but they haven&#39;t returned my calls.  Maybe I <br/>
should call the L.A. Times.  I don&#39;t know if the local Lancaster newspaper <br/>
will respond to this because it is so common there.<br/>
     Your web site looks interesting.  I&#39;m going to check it out right away.  <br/>
Thanks for your concern...<br/>

Is there a place the parents can send him? I would be willing to take him, if <br/>
someone can get him here! I, at one time, was a misunderstood child, so I <br/>
know how bad the system can be when they feel the urge to push their weight <br/>
around. I am praying for your family, and for your nephew. This is so <br/>
horrible! Keep us updated, please! Any information that you can send me would <br/>
be helpful, for I will send a letter to my newspaper, and if I can get ABC <br/>
and NBC email address, we can do something there! I guess this is the exact <br/>
reason our homeschool motto is &quot;Protecting Our Children&quot; I am very much <br/>
behind you! <br/>

   You are really kind!  That is so generous of you to offer to have him go <br/>
there.  I don&#39;t think his parents would consider that right now but we are <br/>
going to research all that we can and use the time until Dec 6.  when he has <br/>
to go back to court.  I looked up the web sites Joel posted (loved both) and <br/>
I&#39;m going to look into what&#39;s on the social justice one.  I really would like <br/>
someone to investigate what&#39;s going on in that town because it goes far <br/>
beyond this situation.<br/>
    During the last school year, my nephew went back to get a book from his <br/>
locker, then saw a friend and started talking instead of hurrying to class, <br/>
and was taken to the office for truancy.  They called the police who gave him <br/>
a ticket, handcuffed him, and took him to where his father worked since his <br/>
mother wasn&#39;t home at the time.  These kinds of things are happening all the <br/>
time in Lancaster now and it is making too many people there lose all faith <br/>
in the justice system.  <br/>
    I love the motto at the Natural Child website (children behave as well as <br/>
they are treated).  I think it would be great if we all marched around the <br/>
school there holding up signs that said just that.  I believe some of those <br/>
adults need to be shamed into remembering the ideals they must have once had <br/>
and seeing how far away from them they now are.  <br/>
    Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and ideas.  His mom is <br/>
going to ask the pediatrician for a note about his physical problems as <br/>
someone suggested.  I don&#39;t know how the not eating issue figures in for the <br/>
school district.  It was brought up to them before and they said it was <br/>
completely irrelevant.  I&#39;ll keep you all posted about any new developments.<br/>

You might consider getting that  letter from the pediatrician to include<br/>
specifically that your nephew needs to eat regular meals (rocket science eh?).<br/>
The kid is entitled to eat.  Unreasonable on their part to deny him food I would<br/>
think.  Also why don&#39;t you get the email addresses of the board, local paper,<br/>
principal, ACLU in Lancaster  and post those so we can all (respectfully, in<br/>
spite of the temptation) let them know our carefully considered thoughts<br/>
regarding their misguided approach to these matters.  Just another suggestion.<br/>
Hang in there.<br/>

As an aside Jan Hunt the founder of NaturalChild.com is going to be on Canada AM<br/>
on Monday (around 7am to 8am PST) talking about the &quot;co-sleeping issue&quot;.  See<br/>

Of course Canada AM may not be readily available in the lower 48 eh?  Oh well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133305565">Thanks everyone so much for your support with this!  Joel, that is a <br/>
great idea to get the addresses and post them on here.  I will do that within <br/>
the next couple of days.  There is no ACLU in Lancaster but I will post the <br/>
main Southern California one as well as the closest one to Lancaster. <br/>
    I am going to check on the eating issue and see if the pediatrician will <br/>
address it.  I will also see if his parents want to look into a civil suit.<br/>
    Vicki in Valenica, thanks for your concern.  I will check into all the <br/>
suggestions offered and keep you all updated.  I so appreciate having found <br/>
this group!  Thanks again...<br/>
