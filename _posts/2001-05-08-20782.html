I have such a hard time getting jobs and going to school.  For example, I<br/>
can apply for a job but I cannot go to an interview, because if I get<br/>
hired that means my freedom is gone.  I can go to a certain extent.  It&#39;s<br/>
a good thing and a bad thing, I guess.  It&#39;s bad because I can&#39;t apply my<br/>
natural unsheepness in too many places in real society.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773725687">Which is precisely why so many &quot;adults&quot; are &quot;dropping out&quot; and going to<br/>
simple living and homesteading, finding alternative means of supporting<br/>
themselves, operating homebased businesses, living off the land.<br/>
