&lt;&lt; Because it is offensive to suggest that those who disagree with you <br/>
definition of<br/>
unschooling go somewhere else. We are here to flesh out our ideas and <br/>
discover, perhaps,<br/>
new ways of thinking. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe spending more time discussing unschooling, then, and less discussing <br/>
the list itself would help everyone&#39;s ideas, discovery and thinking.  Less <br/>
time being offended and more time telling us about your unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been ten years and some now since my oldest didn&#39;t go to kindergarten.  <br/>
Two other kids we thought might go to school decided not to, and all three <br/>
are in the double digits.  I wouldn&#39;t change it for anything.  They&#39;re witty <br/>
and thoughtful and they never, ever go to sleep crying.  They wake up happy <br/>
to be awake.  That&#39;s pretty different from my own childhood, and I&#39;m thrilled <br/>
about it.  I&#39;m glad to help other people figure out how to achieve some of <br/>
that peace and togetherness in their own families.  There ARE some tricks <br/>
that work, and some pitfalls to avoid, and some ways to change thinking in <br/>
very simple ways that produce profound changes of direction.<br/>
