    The rabbi of Berdichev saw a man hurrying along the street, looking neither right nor left.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Why are rushing so much?&quot; he asked the man.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;I&#39;m rushing after my livelihood,&quot; the man answered.<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;And how do you know,&quot; said the rabbi, &quot;that your livelihood is running on before you so that you have to rush after it? Perhaps it&#39;s behind you, and all you need to do is stand still.&quot; <br/>
    Tale about Hasidic rabbi Levi Isaac ben Meir of Berdichev<br/>
