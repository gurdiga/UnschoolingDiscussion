that.  My youngest did that, and my LLL leader friend told me he wanted to<br/>
suck more than he wanted to eat.  She told me to use the same breast for 3-4<br/>
hours, then switch.  It made all the difference.  He was spending a lot of<br/>
time sucking, which he needed, and less time actually &quot;eating&quot;.<br/>

Yes, but didn&#39;t you just hate the lopsided boobies? &lt;g&gt; I remember many a <br/>
morning when Moly would go through a marathon night nursing I would wake up to <br/>
two very different shaped breasts. <br/>
