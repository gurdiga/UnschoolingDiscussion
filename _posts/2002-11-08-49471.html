That&#39;s not the stuffy English.  <br/>
<br/>
Shakespeare is the stuffy stuff of the same period.  Big words, convoluted <br/>
speeches...<br/>
<br/>
The King James is famed for having used the simplest and most direct of <br/>
English available at the time.  Most of the words used were native Saxon <br/>
words.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of native Saxon...  In the days before English was as we know <br/>
it, before it was even Anglo-Saxon, there was a Saxon Gospel (continental) <br/>
translated, more loosely, called The Heliand.  I have a copy, but I can&#39;t get <br/>
to it until my leg is well.    It is wonderful, but certainly NOT the attempt <br/>
at literal translation.  In fact, it is specifically changed from fisherman <br/>
and shepherds, which the Germanic tribes could NOT identify themselves with <br/>
in any way, and it was Jesus as a strong thane, with his warrior companions <br/>
(the disciples).<br/>
<br/>
Since I can&#39;t find it to give you some of my favorite quotes, I found a class <br/>
handout online that has several quotes, with notes:<br/>

them God&#39;s Spell, though generous and good, had a powerful mind: the noble, <br/>

&gt; &gt; I must defend English.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s not the stuffy English.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shakespeare is the stuffy stuff of the same period.  Big words,<br/>
&gt; &gt; convoluted<br/>
&gt; &gt; speeches...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The King James is famed for having used the simplest and most direct <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; English available at the time.  Most of the words used were native <br/>
&gt; Saxon<br/>
&gt; &gt; words.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And speaking of native Saxon...  In the days before English was as we<br/>
&gt; &gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; it, before it was even Anglo-Saxon, there was a Saxon Gospel<br/>
&gt; &gt; (continental)<br/>
&gt; &gt; translated, more loosely, called The Heliand.  I have a copy, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; &gt; to it until my leg is well.    It is wonderful, but certainly NOT the<br/>
&gt; &gt; attempt<br/>
&gt; &gt; at literal translation.  In fact, it is specifically changed from<br/>
&gt; &gt; fisherman<br/>
&gt; &gt; and shepherds, which the Germanic tribes could NOT identify themselves<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; in any way, and it was Jesus as a strong thane, with his warrior<br/>
&gt; &gt; companions<br/>
&gt; &gt; (the disciples).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since I can&#39;t find it to give you some of my favorite quotes, I <br/>
&gt; found a<br/>
&gt; &gt; class<br/>
&gt; &gt; handout online that has several quotes, with notes:<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a sample, but there is more at that page, and if you want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; google<br/>
&gt; &gt; yourself up some more references or samples, go to www.google.com, <br/>

&gt; &gt; Heliand Saxon gospel<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-Matthew and Mark, Luke and John were their names. They were dear to<br/>
&gt; &gt; God,<br/>
&gt; &gt; worthy of the work. The ruling God had placed the Holy Spirit firmly <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; those<br/>
&gt; &gt; heroes&#39; hearts, together with many a wise word, as well as a devout<br/>
&gt; &gt; attitude<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a powerful mind, so that they could lift up their holy voices to<br/>
&gt; &gt; chant<br/>
&gt; &gt; God&#39;s spell.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4 There is nothing like it in words anywhere in this world! Nothing <br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; glorify the Ruler, our dear Chieftain, more! Nor is there anything <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; better fells every evil creature or work of wickedness, nor better<br/>
&gt; &gt; withstand<br/>
&gt; &gt; the hatred and aggression of enemies. This is so, because the one who<br/>
&gt; &gt; taught<br/>
&gt; &gt; them God&#39;s Spell, though generous and good, had a powerful mind: the<br/>
&gt; &gt; noble,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the almighty Creator Himself. These four were to write it down with<br/>
&gt; &gt; their own<br/>
&gt; &gt; fingers; they were to compose, sing, and proclainl what they had seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; heard of Christ&#39;s powerful strength-all the many wonderful things, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; word<br/>
&gt; &gt; and deed, that the mighty Chieftain Himself said, taught, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; accomplished<br/>
&gt; &gt; among human beings-and also all the things which the Ruler spoke from<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; beginning, when He, by His own power, fIrst made the world and formed<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; whole universe with one word.-=-<br/>
