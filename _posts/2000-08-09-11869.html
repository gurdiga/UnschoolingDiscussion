<div id="ygrps-yiv-241055347">I know you can access Britannica online, but at this price you <br/>
can&#39;t deny that having a copy of both Britannica and World Book on <br/>
cd rom is a great bargain.   I just ordered my copy and decided to <br/>
send the link on.   You first have to pay $50 + postage, then send <br/>
away for the mail in rebate of $50.   I have never had any problems <br/>
with getting my rebates from offers like this.  Here is the <br/>
information I was sent.    Sue<br/>
