&gt; Tia&#39;s Lars had a hard time,  but Tia will say it was her teaching<br/>
&gt; intervention that slowed down the process,  and (I think) that Lars<br/>
&gt; reads as well as he wants and needs to for his life these days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s right.  And for almost 3 years he has refused to read books, just web<br/>
sites and magazines.  The other day he asked me which Harry Potters we<br/>
owned, and I handed him the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th books.  He&#39;s now reading<br/>

&gt; I tried to &quot;sit and talk with her.&quot;  It added to her pressure and she<br/>
&gt; reacted to my unconscious dissatisfaction with her abilities.  It was a<br/>
&gt; roadblock.<br/>
