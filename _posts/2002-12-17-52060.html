   I&#39;m not sure about this as my 6 yr old dd is hardly ever without a stick <br/>
or some such weapon in hand. She&#39;s so tough and is always talking about <br/>
fighting. I have thought about some kind of martial art for her as she <br/>
adores 1970&#39;s chinese/hongkong kungfu movies.<br/>
She&#39;s not much of a joiner-iner though, we tried Rainbows and a dance class <br/>
and she just ran around and did her own thing or hid in a corner. She wanted <br/>
to go but didn&#39;t want to do &#39;it&#39; if you see what I mean.<br/>

they do...<br/>
