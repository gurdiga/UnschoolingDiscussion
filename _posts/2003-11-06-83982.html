<div id="ygrps-yiv-907724049">Hi,<br/>
Just wondering how folks are responding to the info provided in the last 2 issues of Home Education magazine, (sept-oct and nov-dec 2003, Vol 20, numbers 5 and 6,) regarding Federal Homeschool Legislation, proposed bill HR 2732?  Any concerns, worries?  Thanks, L.L.<br/>

long ago?<br/>
<br/>
If no one wants to recap or can point to the beginning of the thread, there<br/>
are HEM and NHEN sponsored lists where the politics of homeschooling is the<br/>
main focus. Check at:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This list is not for discussion of political issues or concerns, but <br/>
for unschooling discussion. However, the NHEN forums are available for <br/>
those who wish to read more and talk about these bills:<br/>

NHEN is the one place where you can hear from both supporters and <br/>
detractors and then make up your own mind.<br/>
