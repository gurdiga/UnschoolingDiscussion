&gt;Has anyone read the Amelia Peabody mysteries by Elizabeth Peters?  I&#39;m just <br/>
&gt;starting the most recent one.  I&#39;ve read all of them several times.  Ramses <br/>
&gt;(Peabody&#39;s son) is a great example of a true unschooler!  Give them try <br/>
&gt;sometime - you can learn lots about Egyptian history as well as having fun <br/>
&gt;with them.  <br/>

different versions of the books, and the various books themselves, they have<br/>
73 items of hers on file... which one do I start with?<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, thank, you for the reference to the Amelia Peabody books.  My oldest <br/>
loves mysteries.  She picked one up at the library yesterday and couldn&#39;t put <br/>
it down last night.<br/>
I think I&#39;ll be next!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888414597">I found a whole bunch of these books in a local used book store<br/>
the other day, and browsed through the titles and picked out<br/>
three that sounded interesting to me.   I am an avid reader, and<br/>
hope my grandson, Kristopher, will be one also.  Do you suppose<br/>
he would enjoy these stories when he is a little older?  He is<br/>
6 right now, and not particularly fond of reading - YET!  He <br/>
does like me to read his favorite stories to him.<br/>

I&#39;ll bet he would enjoy them more when he is old enough to &quot;get&quot; the subtle, <br/>
Victorian humor.  Until then, he might just like hearing about the adventures <br/>
and the archaeology.  <br/>
