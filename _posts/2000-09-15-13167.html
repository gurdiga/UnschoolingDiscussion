 got into soooo much trouble for that.  My mom&#39;s not as creative as I am.  <br/>
 Scarred me for life.  I vowed that if my kids needed a box of Kleenex to <br/>
play <br/>

FYI, my kids are HIGHLY supervised while using the sewing machine.  I may be <br/>
brave but I&#39;m not stupid.  Goodness knows what those curtains would have <br/>
