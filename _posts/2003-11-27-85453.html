crumbled and set out in garden for birds, doled out to expectant dogs, given to <br/>
carolers and next door neighbors and present-bringers and the mail carrier and <br/>
grocery baggers, taken along when visiting others or for sharing in the office or <br/>
to dance, karate, gymnastics or the game shop. <br/>
       It could be a whole new challenge, deploying the daily cookies in <br/>
festive and celebratory ways. See who can get the biggest bang for the bake? Who <br/>
would have time left to fret over the suspense of waiting o unwrap presents? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
