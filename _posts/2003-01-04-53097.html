Good luck with your surgery.  I&#39;ve only had arthroscopic (how DO you spell<br/>
that!??), so I can&#39;t provide any advice other than take good care of<br/>
yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m really curious about this story, now that you&#39;ve given us this nice<br/>
little tease....!  At the least, I hope to hear that your rescue was<br/>
successful and that your daughter is ok!<br/>

trailor) with a flat bed on the back that the brownie girl scout troup<br/>
was riding on for the Christmas Parade jerked so hard to a start all<br/>
of us fell off our straw  bale we were sitting on and my daughter (who<br/>
is fine now) fell off the side 5-6 ft during this jerk so I had to<br/>
jump down to keep her from being run over by the back wheels and in<br/>
doing have completly tore my ACL and tore my meniscal lig/cartlage to<br/>
some degree as well and am facing surgery thursday, even though my<br/>
knee does not particuarly hurt( but seems weak and feels bound up)<br/>
which really makes me question this whole thing but if it is not<br/>
attached at all I am also leary about not doing the surgery as well. Lynn</div>

all to death!  <br/>
<br/>
My Dad tore his ACL a few years ago (in the terribly violent move of<br/>
stepping off the curb--don&#39;t ask!).  But he had surgery, too, so I don&#39;t<br/>
know how it would be to not have it.  He was completely back to his usual<br/>
amount of walking in about a month.  But then, he&#39;s not a big up-and-around<br/>
kind of guy, so that doesn&#39;t necessarily tell you much, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that whatever you decide to do, that you have a quick recovery.  Feel<br/>
free to gripe here about what a pain being laid up is.  Sandra and Elizabeth<br/>
got lots of sympathy from us for their leg injuries, you should too!!  :)<br/>

my head to keep my foot elevated.  What else could I have done?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My friend Jeff has had that surgery on BOTH knees.  His injury was repeated <br/>
armored combat on rough ground,  Various twists and tweaks with particularly <br/>
bad tweaks or twists at some point, not the same year.   He&#39;s been king of <br/>
our SCA kingdom five times.  He&#39;s 37, and has had both knees done.<br/>
<br/>
Today I drove Kirby to work.  First I practiced, going a block away, turning <br/>
around and coming back, to see how it felt to hit the brake fairly  hard.  It <br/>
seemed fine.  I wouldn&#39;t be able to drive to a grocery store and get out and <br/>
shop and get back in and drive, I don&#39;t think.  Maybe next week.  But today <br/>
was just drive one mile, let him out, drive home.  Sunday morning, no traffic.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the sympathy and encouragement and ideas while I was down <br/>
and bored.  I still wear the brace half the day, but am going without it in <br/>
the morning until it swells.  A little longer each day.<br/>

life that I&#39;d gotten the idea that she was up and around and surviving<br/>
fairly well these days, but you&#39;ve been quieter about your leg lately.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for happy news.<br/>
