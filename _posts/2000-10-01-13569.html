<div id="ygrps-yiv-360692059">Okey dokey, while we are not spending our tax dollars on something that<br/>
isn&#39;t getting our tax dollars directly, how about not spending our tax<br/>
dollars on something that is getting our tax dollars directly.  Confused<br/>
yet &lt;g&gt;  Well, I am talking about millions of dollars spent each year on<br/>
National Genocide Day!  I&#39;m talking about the free use of public buildings<br/>
for groups to celebrate National Genocide Day in.  I&#39;m talking about all<br/>
those folks who get a paid holiday (most at the tax payers&#39; expense) for<br/>
National Genocide Day.  I am talking about folks such as those in Boulder,<br/>
CO who agreed to change the name of their parade to signify that it was a<br/>
heritage parade instead of a celebration of a mass murderer and who as of<br/>
yesterday changed their mind and stated they were proud of their own<br/>
personal Hitler.  I leave you to ruminate over the following news release:<br/>
<br/>
Lynda<br/>
===============<br/>
&quot;    Our we as American citizens so blind to the truth of Columbus that we<br/>
allow our tax dollars to pay for a national holiday for a mass murderer,<br/>
kidnapper, enslaver and a thief? As a member of the Cherokee Nation of<br/>
Oklahoma, with Italian heritage myself, I take no pride in my Italian<br/>
heritage in this country. When you look at the millions of tax dollars that<br/>
have been spent on fighting organized crime in this country and countless<br/>
television shows glorifying Italian mobsters and then my tax dollars paying<br/>
for<br/>
Columbus Day, this is a National Sick Joke!<br/>
<br/>
    The Italian community in this country needs to wake up to their overall<br/>
dirt bag, low life image. you can view this image weekly on HBO with your<br/>
family. The Italian community is not protesting the image of them that is<br/>
being portrayed in television and movies. Columbus is the Hitler of<br/>
America!<br/>
<br/>
    It is another National sick joke, that of all the Federal holidays on<br/>
the books, not one of them recognize or pay tribute to the American<br/>
Indians.<br/>
The so called founding fathers of this country brought about the Federal<br/>
Government using Indian Government as a guide. Freedom of speech,<br/>
separation<br/>
of Governmental powers and Federalism was achieved by observing Indian<br/>
Governments. It did not come from Europe, Africa, Middle east or Asia.<br/>
<br/>
    There is not one group of people in this country that have suffered or<br/>
endured any more hardship than the American Indians, nor any race of people<br/>
on the face of this planet. Slavery around the world and human genocide in<br/>
world war two is one thing, but the Indians have endured five centuries of<br/>
genocide and wars fighting for their homeland to live in peace. With all<br/>
that this great Nation of America has today, came from the American Indians<br/>
homeland at the expense of the worlds longest holocaust against the Indian<br/>
race.<br/>
<br/>
    With all the support that the American Indians have given to the<br/>
Federal<br/>
and State Governments in the forming of this Country, we should not have to<br/>
ask for a national holiday. Our ancestors helped the Federal Government<br/>
come<br/>
about and achieve it&#39;s independence July 4th 1776, we have Thanksgiving Day<br/>
because of the American Indians and countless more contributions.<br/>
<br/>
    African Americans have proclaimed the confederate flag raciest and<br/>
should be taken out of schools and public buildings. Not one word in the<br/>
national news media is said about what the American Indians endured under<br/>
the United States flag. My question to America is why is the plight of one<br/>
group of people in this country more important to correct and make amends<br/>
for what was done to them and completely ignore what was done to the<br/>
original inhabitants of this land?<br/>
<br/>
    United Native America is calling on all Americans to make this country<br/>
face up to the inhuman acts committed against the American Indian people.<br/>
It<br/>
is time for the genocide of American Indians to stop now, along with the<br/>
racial exclusion of them in our society today. The Congressional Indian<br/>
Caucus in Washington DC. is drafting a national holiday bill at this time<br/>
to<br/>
bring before Congress after the first of next year, there number is<br/>
