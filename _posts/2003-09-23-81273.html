<br/>
Some beliefs are like walled gardens. They encourage exclusiveness, and the <br/>
feeling of being especially privileged. <br/>
<br/>
Other beliefs are expansive and lead the way into wider and deeper <br/>
sympathies. <br/>
<br/>
Some beliefs are divisive, separating the saved from the unsaved, friends <br/>
from enemies. <br/>
<br/>
Other beliefs are bonds in a world community, where sincere differences <br/>
beautify the pattern. <br/>
<br/>
Some beliefs are rigid, like the body of death, impotent in a changing world. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other beliefs are pliable, like the young sapling, ever growing with the <br/>
upward thrust of life. <br/>
