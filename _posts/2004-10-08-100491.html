<div id="ygrps-yiv-508930476">Greetings Emile and all of you interested in learning spanish,<br/>
Chating with audio is an easy way for learning languages. MSN messenger is <br/>
very secure and private.<br/>
I&#39;m a radical unschooler mom from Puerto Rico, for me chating with another <br/>
unschooler is a real pleasure, I can have english practice and you can learn <br/>
spanish with me! If you like the idea, send an email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bap58@...">bap58@...</a> . <br/>
I only use msn messenger.<br/>

&gt; To try gamely to wrestle this back around to unschooling... is there<br/>
&gt; anyone on the list who has kids (or is a kid) interested in learning a<br/>
&gt; second language in a non-class environment?  What kinds of strategies<br/>
&gt; work for people?  I&#39;m currently trying to read the first Harry Potter<br/>
&gt; book side by side in english and spanish.  It&#39;s interesting, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know if I could ever get fluent this way ;)  Certainly not speaking<br/>
&gt; fluent, but maybe reading...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921169446">Another great resource, for those whose kids learn well from<br/>
&quot;textbooks,&quot; is the WikiBooks project; its Spanish text is at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Spanish_%28Cover%29.">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Spanish_%28Cover%29.</a><br/>
<br/>
For those who haven&#39;t encountered the WikiMedia phenomenon yet, spend<br/>
a few minutes exploring <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">http://en.wikipedia.org</a> -- it&#39;s a real trip. <br/>
A whole encyclopedia whose articles have been written, corrected,<br/>
re-written and vetted by folks just like you and I.  If you see<br/>
something in an article that you just *know* is wrong, you can jump<br/>
right in and fix it.  Try *that* with your Brittanica!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Before you reject the idea out of hand (not that I expect too many<br/>
unschoolers to do so!), take a moment to read<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Replies_to_common_objections.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Replies_to_common_objections.</a><br/>
<br/>
Man, do I ever envy kids growing up in an age where such resources are<br/>
- literally - at their fingertips!  Humankind has never seen such an<br/>
age for self-directed learning!<br/>
