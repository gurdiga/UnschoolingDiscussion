  Just wanted to touch base with you - let you know that for you and for those who love Skye - you and they are in my thoughts. What a tragedy.  I can not begin to express what was in my heart after reading your post.  But wanted to let you know that I care.  My care is with you, the kids, his family.  Deborah<br/>

Thanks.  I keep thinking of his poor mom, and looking at my own live kids and <br/>
feeling a big jumble of emotions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865100069">Sandra, what a touching post. Thanks for sharing. Don&#39;t feel bad about<br/>
crying; you were mourning senseless loss, it wasn&#39;t just the morning<br/>
glories.<br/>
<br/>
I was dealing with a problem in our support group last week and was<br/>
listening to a mom whining about the problem on the phone while checking my<br/>
news headlines for the day. Reading about children dying in a suicide<br/>
bombing in Jerusalem made my tiny problems just vanish. I sometimes forget<br/>
how fragile we all are. Thanks for reminding us.<br/>
