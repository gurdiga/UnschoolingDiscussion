&gt; <br/>
&gt; Debi and Sandra are right. I debated whether to reply when I did in the way <br/>
&gt; I did and should have held my cool. I insulted you, even though you <br/>
&gt; intended no insult toward me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am sorry and ask that you forgive me, though you haven&#39;t a clue who I am, <br/>
&gt; and such things via the web border on the trivial, though I don&#39;t see it as <br/>
&gt; such.<br/>
