<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153607831">Forgive me if you all have heard this already but I just got an e-mail from <br/>
mercola.com about Steve Jobs giving a commencement speech recently.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds a lot like he is of the unschooling mentality (even though he <br/>
&quot;unschooled&quot; during college years) and I was surprised to see it on Mercola!<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He even talked about connecting the dots!<br/>
<br/>
The bit about calligraphy was neat too.  It shows that you just never know how a current interest might lead to something important in the future.<br/>
