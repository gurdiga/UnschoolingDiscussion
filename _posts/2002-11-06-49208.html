<div id="ygrps-yiv-417966134">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
(lurker here, who just got done deleting lots of posts about young earth <br/>
agenda type discussions... nice to see some unschooling stuff here!)<br/>
<br/>
This made me think of my fil, a controlling, judgmental type <br/>
ex-schoolteacher. He thinks that little girls should take ballet, boys <br/>
should play baseball, and they should go to catholic school and <br/>
dutifully bring their report cards to him when they come to visit so he <br/>
can solemnly see if they&#39;re good enough, and if so, give them a dollar. <br/>
He doesn&#39;t quite know what to do with my brood of unschoolers. So when <br/>
they come over, he tries to quiz them to see what they know. <br/>
Fortunately, the kids kind of just roll their eyes at this. The other <br/>
day, the girls were playing charades, except what they were doing was <br/>
imitations of people they know. The 12 yo dd barks out &quot;what&#39;s 5 + 7!&quot;  <br/>
Giggling hysterically, 8 yo dd shouts back &quot;grandpap!&quot; and the two of <br/>
them collapsed laughing.<br/>
<br/>
My hubby reverts to schooly voice sometimes too (that it&#39;s only <br/>
sometimes amazes me, actually, considering..)<br/>
<br/>
I would say, don&#39;t worry, the kids will get over it and unlearn dad <br/>
eventually.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

You should post more often!  What a great story about their Grandpap!<br/>
<br/>
The other day, before I broke my ankle (so it&#39;s really more like last month) <br/>
my 4 year old son was writing on the chalkboard while I was up on a ladder <br/>
painting the kitchen (which remains half painted).  He was writing a long <br/>
string of letters like NNOOPPLT and then reading them.  He&#39;d ask me first, <br/>
I&#39;d pronounce it, he&#39;d giggle and then erase and try again.  Pretty soon he <br/>
was pronouncing his own nonsense.  The he wrote NOOF and said &quot;Look Mommy, <br/>
what does it say?&quot;  I said &quot;noof.  If you change then N to W, it will say <br/>
woof!&quot;  He refused, I insisted, he went back to writing LLTNEEANPZ.  He sure <br/>
taught me!  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I just can&#39;t help myself from interfering.  It happens less and <br/>
less, but it still annoys me greatly.  My children aren&#39;t all that bothered <br/>
by it, they just ignore it or refuse to perform.  No one likes a quiz.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645745876">sorry to hear about your ankle.. hope it didn&#39;t happen falling off the <br/>
ladder!  We do silly pronunciations too. Somehow, it seems to help with <br/>
learning to read. If not, at least it&#39;s fun, and I&#39;ve always been a firm <br/>
believer that silliness is an important part of learning. (way back <br/>
when, when I taught in a catholic high school, this was not always <br/>
appreciated by the teachers in the rooms nearby, who often learned to <br/>
close their doors... lol.. guess I was an unschooler even then.)<br/>

    My own mother is like this!  She is very condemning though and belittles <br/>
the kids when they don&#39;t answer or get it wrong.  She also does this only if <br/>
I am not around!<br/>
She would attack my kids and I didn&#39;t even know about it.  One time, she was <br/>
babysitting (a few years ago, when we first started unschooling and my kids <br/>
were all too young to stay home by themselves) while I had a doctors <br/>
appointment.  Since one of my children would have been in third grade that <br/>
year, she sat him down to see if he knew cursive (he didn&#39;t, since he had <br/>
never written in cursive at all).  The schools here teach it in second grade, <br/>
so she got very angry.  She just happened to be yelling &quot;What do you mean, <br/>
you don&#39;t know this?!!  You should know this by now!<br/>
You are in third grade, you are not a baby!  You aren&#39;t-------&quot;  I stepped in <br/>
and stopped her.  From experience I knew that she was going to call him <br/>
stupid or worse next.  We had a big discussion about her not ever testing my <br/>
kids or talking to them in that tone of voice.  She got extremely angry with <br/>
me, yelled a lot and then didn&#39;t talk to me for a few weeks (typical behavior <br/>
when I confront her).  The testing stopped for a while, but then she started <br/>
trying to &quot;sneak it in&quot;.  As the boys got older, they were able to shrug off <br/>
her &quot;attitude&quot; but my youngest daughter was easier to pick on for awhile.  So <br/>
my youngest two just decided not to be around grandma anymore, not unless the <br/>
whole family went.  It really hurt her feelings and she claims that I turned <br/>
my kids against her, she refuses to see what she is doing.  Both of the <br/>
younger ones have gotten older and wiser and will now say &quot;I don&#39;t want to <br/>
answer any question&quot; or in the case of my late reader 11 year old daughter <br/>
(she didn&#39;t start reading until 9 1/2 years old) &quot;I don&#39;t want to read to <br/>
you&quot;.  It makes my mother mad, but she accepts it.  Now she attacks their <br/>
attitude sometimes (she doesn&#39;t think children should tell adults no).  So my <br/>
kids still don&#39;t like being alone with her, but it is getting easier as they <br/>
get older, since they are feeling as &quot;big&quot; as she is (even my youngest is <br/>
very, very tall for her age) so they don&#39;t feel as bullied anymore.  However, <br/>
I don&#39;t make my kids go over there by themselves.  I would rather hurt my <br/>
mothers feelings than hurt my children and make them feel intimidated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492594390">omigosh Tammy, this sounds so much like what we are going through with <br/>
my in-laws right now - all three of them (fil, mil, sil -- they come as <br/>
a unit). We won&#39;t leave the kids with them anymore, due to lack of trust <br/>
(long story). 12 yo dd has asked to not have to go there at all anymore, <br/>
and we said okay. A friend has agreed to take her whenever necessary. <br/>
They no longer quiz her - they ignore her. The only time anyone seems to <br/>
talk to her is to ask if she&#39;s taking dance lessons yet. She has told <br/>
them, I have told them, that she isn&#39;t interested in dance, she&#39;s <br/>
involved with acting. They have little interest in that, and dd no <br/>
longer wants them invited to her plays (fine with me and hubby).<br/>
<br/>
I agree, kids first, grandparents second - and the kids act more mature <br/>
and compassionate than the &quot;adults&quot;.  We also get the behind the back <br/>
questioning and stuff too. We hate it, kids hate it. How disrespectful. <br/>
We&#39;ve been told that they (in-laws) don&#39;t need us telling them anything <br/>
about children because they raised two of their own. What we have to say <br/>
about our own kids is of no interest to them - including safety issues. <br/>
(okay, heading towards a rant here.... sorry)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, trust your instincts, trust your kids, and close the curtains <br/>
and lock the doors (you do get surprise visits, don&#39;t you? )<br/>
<br/>
quick! how many unschoolers does it take to do a math problem?... well, <br/>
first you need to have a reason to do a math problem..hmm.. let&#39;s bake <br/>
brownies.. then we...<br/>
<br/>
take care,<br/>

    Yep, sounds just like my family!  Only they wish that my kids were into <br/>
soccer or baseball like my sil kids.  My kids are not into sports.  They are <br/>
into computers, role playing games, and scouts.  I let them choose.<br/>
    LOL  We do close doors and curtains!  Yes we do get surprise visits  :-(  <br/>
One time my parents just showed up and we were all still in bed.  It was even <br/>
later than usual (about 10:30 or 11:00 am) and I knew my parents would think <br/>
we were horrible!  They already think that about sleeping past 8:00 am!)  We <br/>
had been up late reading Harry Potter and playing games.    So we just stayed <br/>
in bed and giggled and didn&#39;t answer the door.  A few minutes later my phone <br/>
rang.  The answering maching picked up and my mom was screaming into it.  She <br/>
was still in the driveway on her cell phone!<br/>
She was &quot;frantic&quot; that we were hurt, since our van was in the garage.  She <br/>
thinks that living in the country is dangerous, so she thought we were laying <br/>
dead in the house!  Well it ticked me off!  So I just let her rant and rave <br/>
and still didn&#39;t answer the door.  When we finally spoke hours later on the <br/>
phone, I told her how silly she had been.  I really showed her how ridiculous <br/>
it looked for her to stand out in my driveway on her cell phone, while she <br/>
tried to break in my house (I forgot to mention that earlier, but she tried <br/>
to also break in to &quot;save&quot; us).  Needless to say, we don&#39;t get so many <br/>
surprise visits, but I still don&#39;t trust them!<br/>

&gt; and we said okay. A friend has agreed to take her whenever necessary. <br/>
&gt; They no longer quiz her - they ignore her. The only time anyone seems to <br/>
&gt; talk to her is to ask if she&#39;s taking dance lessons yet. She has told <br/>
&gt; them, I have told them, that she isn&#39;t interested in dance, she&#39;s <br/>
&gt; involved with acting. They have little interest in that, and dd no <br/>
&gt; longer wants them invited to her plays (fine with me and hubby).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree, kids first, grandparents second - and the kids act more mature <br/>
&gt; and compassionate than the &quot;adults&quot;.  We also get the behind the back <br/>
&gt; questioning and stuff too. We hate it, kids hate it. How disrespectful. <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve been told that they (in-laws) don&#39;t need us telling them anything <br/>
&gt; about children because they raised two of their own. What we have to say <br/>
&gt; about our own kids is of no interest to them - including safety issues. <br/>
&gt; (okay, heading towards a rant here.... sorry)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, trust your instincts, trust your kids, and close the curtains <br/>
&gt; and lock the doors (you do get surprise visits, don&#39;t you? )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; quick! how many unschoolers does it take to do a math problem?... well, <br/>
&gt; first you need to have a reason to do a math problem..hmm.. let&#39;s bake <br/>
&gt; brownies.. then we...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; take care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420304018">Happened to us too, except I was taking a nap with my then toddler, and <br/>
I was pregnant with number two. Since fil is highly anti-tech, he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a cell phone (and he won&#39;t call one if he knows it&#39;s a <br/>
cell) so they had to scurry off to a local pay phone. I said &quot;oh, were <br/>
you here?&quot;  all innocent. &quot;call next time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
fun stuff.<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
hang in there.<br/>

&gt;     Yep, sounds just like my family!  Only they wish that my kids were <br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; soccer or baseball like my sil kids.  My kids are not into sports.  <br/>
&gt; They are<br/>
&gt; into computers, role playing games, and scouts.  I let them choose.<br/>
&gt;     LOL  We do close doors and curtains!  Yes we do get surprise <br/>
&gt; visits  :-( <br/>
&gt; One time my parents just showed up and we were all still in bed.  It <br/>
&gt; was even<br/>
&gt; later than usual (about 10:30 or 11:00 am) and I knew my parents would <br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; we were horrible!  They already think that about sleeping past 8:00 <br/>
&gt; am!)  We<br/>
&gt; had been up late reading Harry Potter and playing games.    So we just <br/>
&gt; stayed<br/>
&gt; in bed and giggled and didn&#39;t answer the door.  A few minutes later my <br/>
&gt; phone<br/>
&gt; rang.  The answering maching picked up and my mom was screaming into <br/>
&gt; it.  She<br/>
&gt; was still in the driveway on her cell phone!<br/>
&gt; She was &quot;frantic&quot; that we were hurt, since our van was in the garage.  <br/>
&gt; She<br/>
&gt; thinks that living in the country is dangerous, so she thought we were <br/>
&gt; laying<br/>
&gt; dead in the house!  Well it ticked me off!  So I just let her rant and <br/>
&gt; rave<br/>
&gt; and still didn&#39;t answer the door.  When we finally spoke hours later on <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; phone, I told her how silly she had been.  I really showed her how <br/>
&gt; ridiculous<br/>
&gt; it looked for her to stand out in my driveway on her cell phone, while <br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; tried to break in my house (I forgot to mention that earlier, but she <br/>
&gt; tried<br/>
&gt; to also break in to &quot;save&quot; us).  Needless to say, we don&#39;t get so many<br/>
&gt; surprise visits, but I still don&#39;t trust them!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; omigosh Tammy, this sounds so much like what we are going through with<br/>
&gt; &gt; my in-laws right now - all three of them (fil, mil, sil -- they come <br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; a unit). We won&#39;t leave the kids with them anymore, due to lack of <br/>
&gt; trust<br/>
&gt; &gt; (long story). 12 yo dd has asked to not have to go there at all <br/>
&gt; anymore,<br/>
