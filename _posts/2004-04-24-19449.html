<div id="ygrps-yiv-428475013">Hello all, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Beverley, and I&#39;m from South Australia. My children are aged 23, 21,<br/>
and 17. <br/>
<br/>
I can relate to where Nadine is coming from as although we unschooled for<br/>
years I was forever uneasy in my mind. Getting those definitions sorted out<br/>
helped me. I prefer the term &#39;learning naturally&#39; and believe that we learn<br/>
in each and every minute - it&#39;s like breathing. Sometimes what we learn<br/>
isn&#39;t what we thought we&#39;d learn from a particular moment in time, but<br/>
we&#39;re learning all the time. Unschooling is an okay definition and serves a<br/>
useful purpose but some people believe it&#39;s akin to permissive parenting<br/>
and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that at all. Homeschooling is too vague - it can<br/>
mean school at home, correspondence education or whatever. I&#39;ve done a<br/>
little of everything with my children in a conscious way, including part<br/>
time enrolment at school. The most successful approach to date is allowing<br/>
them to learn naturally. It&#39;s way more efficient than any other method and<br/>
seems to be able to encompass all methods of &#39;learning&#39;. For example,<br/>
Thomas, my youngest, is currently studying electronics by distance<br/>
education but he&#39;s learning how to make movies by mucking about with<br/>
cameras and his computer. He uses whatever learning tools/resources are<br/>
best suited to his need and interest. We helped him develop this skill over<br/>
time, mostly by example, but also by actively encouraging him to think<br/>
about his needs and wants and who he is as a person. <br/>
<br/>
Being a homeschooling mum is an anxious business because we&#39;re going<br/>
against societal &#39;norms&#39;. It&#39;s hard to be different and stay up beat about<br/>
it all the time. I keenly felt the social isolation from homeschooling in<br/>
the early years - suddenly I couldn&#39;t visit my friends because their kids<br/>
were at school and they didn&#39;t want to be surrounded by other people&#39;s<br/>
kids... I think the social isolation hit me harder than my kids. Then I had<br/>
to deal with the insecurities that came with finding homeschooling families<br/>
that &#39;did it better&#39; than us! It took years to shut up the inner critic -<br/>
the one that whispered in my ear every day that I wasn&#39;t good enough, that<br/>
I would naturally fail my children, that other people could do it because<br/>
they were smarter, university educated, better mothers, had more money, had<br/>
gifted children, etc etc etc... Meanwhile people began to come to ME for<br/>
homeschooling advice! <br/>
<br/>
The only thing I could do was offer what my heart felt to be true to the<br/>
inner child in me. <br/>
<br/>
So, Nadine, what do YOU need to feel okay right NOW? Forget about your son,<br/>
forget about the critics, forget about the future even. Unless we look<br/>
after our own emotional well being we can&#39;t totally available to help<br/>
others, and sometimes we need to be, especially as mothers. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I would ask my children to work from text books because it calmed<br/>
me down. I told them that there was a good chance they&#39;d learn something<br/>
useful from doing the exercises required of them in the books, and that<br/>
there was a good chance they wouldn&#39;t. But what WOULD happen is that my<br/>
momentary paranoia (&quot;my children aren&#39;t learning anything! I&#39;m not a good<br/>
homeschooling mum!&quot;) would disappear as I watched my children work. More<br/>
often than not they&#39;d breeze through the pages... somehow, without<br/>
practising writing they&#39;d be spelling words they hadn&#39;t been able to six<br/>
months before, or understood maths concepts without having learned them...<br/>
Life is a fantastic teacher and children are programmed to learn! And learn<br/>
they do, very efficiently, without our interference. A couple of weeks of<br/>
structured actitivies, which I meticulously recorded so that I could prove<br/>
to myself that my children were capapble learners the next time I lapsed<br/>
into a bout of depression or gave into insecurities. The kids knew that<br/>
they were doing bookwork to help me, not to learn anything in particular.<br/>
THis made it easy for all us - the motivation was REAL, even if the<br/>
activity itself wasn&#39;t...<br/>
<br/>
My children grew up confident that they could learn anything they wanted to<br/>
at any time in their lives and that self-motivation is the key. As young<br/>
adults my children are now learning that knowing oneself is the key to<br/>
self-motivation. A lot of the things they think they want aren&#39;t happening<br/>
- and they are discovering that it&#39;s because other people expect them to<br/>
want those things, or they thought that other people wanted them to. As<br/>
they discover more about who they are as individuals they are finding that<br/>
achieving what they really want is very easy. When you are doing what you<br/>
love life comes easy. I found that untangling myself from the expectations<br/>
of others, both in my mind and in theirs, one of the hardest things to do<br/>
in my life. And it took 45 years. I watch my 17 year old and see that he&#39;s<br/>
almost conquered that goal already... thanks to learning naturally! He is<br/>
our only child not tainted by school experience and who has had the least<br/>
amount of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas refused to do anything that didn&#39;t make sense to him. Often I would<br/>
need to explain why we do things the way we do, why it might be useful for<br/>
him to consider doing things. He&#39;d consider them and then, more often than<br/>
not, say they still didn&#39;t make sense and continue to refuse to do them.<br/>
That made me bend my ways to find solutions that made sense in every which<br/>
way, not just for him or me, but for most people and situations. One of my<br/>
surprising discoveries is that life is actually very simple - the simplest<br/>
solution is often the most effective. <br/>
<br/>
If a child doesn&#39;t want to draw right now, then teaching him how to draw<br/>
shadows right now doesn&#39;t make sense. When he wants to know how to draw<br/>
shadows he will find the right tools, and one of them may be to access a<br/>
tutor (book or person) that will show him. Or he might use observation and<br/>
experimentation. Schools suck because 99% of what they ask children to do<br/>
is contrived. That makes it pretty meaningless to most children. Some<br/>
children don&#39;t have access to a range of tools when they want to learn -<br/>
that&#39;s a sad fact related to how little we value children in our society.<br/>
Having made the decision to educate our children outside of schools we&#39;re<br/>
in a position to offer our children whatever tools for learning they need,<br/>
WHEN they need them, not before!<br/>
<br/>
We wrote our own curriculum and educational program based on where our<br/>
children were at, what we wanted for them, and what they needed. I read the<br/>
national and state curriculum guidelines but most of it wasn&#39;t relevant to<br/>
one child learning outside of a classroom. And most of it was unrealistic -<br/>
particularly in the classroom setting. There is no accountability within<br/>
the school system - when the curriculum fails to deliver what it promises<br/>
for all children, the children and their families are blamed, not the<br/>
curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry I&#39;ve rambled on so much. I&#39;ve been lurking for a few weeks and<br/>
haven&#39;t had the time to post before. Thanks for listening. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
wishing you peace, health and prosperity,<br/>
