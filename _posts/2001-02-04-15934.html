<div id="ygrps-yiv-335939436">There have been various discussions lately about the U.S.&#39;s sterilization<br/>
policy, particularly since the son of the man that pushed this policy was<br/>
resently declared president by the supreme court.  Quite frequently the<br/>
response on lists has been &quot;prove it&quot; and when references have been given,<br/>
doubt continued.<br/>
<br/>
Well, here is a state that is admitting that eurgenics was practiced.<br/>

&gt; Va. House Voices Regret for Eugenics<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   RICHMOND, Feb. 2 -- The House of Delegates voted today to express regret<br/>
&gt; for Virginia&#39; s policies of selective breeding during the 20th century,<br/>
&gt; including the forced sterilization of 8,000 mostly poor, uneducated men<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; women for supposed hereditary &quot;defects.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The 85 to 10 vote came after some of the hundreds of victims of<br/>
Virginia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; forced sterilizations spoke out in television and newspaper reports<br/>
&gt; spotlighting the state&#39;s leading role in a movement called eugenics. It<br/>
&gt; sought to use government power to breed away such chronic social problems<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; poverty, immorality, crime, addiction and ignorance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The resolution, which requires the approval of the state Senate, would<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; Virginia the first among the 30 states that once had forced sterilization<br/>
&gt; laws to formally express regret. The resolution passed today would declare<br/>
&gt; &quot;profound regret over the Commonwealth&#39;s role in the eugenics movement in<br/>
&gt; this country and the incalculable human damage done in the name of<br/>
eugenics.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It was a remarkable moment for a state whose leaders prefer to talk<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; Virginia&#39;s role in helping found the nation -- and lately, its high-tech<br/>
&gt; dominance -- instead of its prominent role in such historic evils as<br/>
slavery,<br/>
&gt; segregation and forced sterilizations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Even today&#39;s resolution was changed to remove the word &quot;apology.&quot; Some<br/>
&gt; House members, including Del. Harry J. Parrish (R-Manassas), wanted to go<br/>
&gt; further and remove the passage expressing regret, though he called the<br/>
&gt; resolution&#39;s intentions admirable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &quot;We&#39;re offering regrets for something that was done legally,&quot; Parrish<br/>
said.<br/>
&gt; &quot;It&#39;s improper for us to now second-guess the General Assembly then.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Virginia officials and academics had a leading role in the American<br/>
&gt; eugenics movement, which paralleled the Nazi drive for a super race. The<br/>
U.S.<br/>
&gt; Holocaust Memorial Museum has requested documents from Virginia as it<br/>
&gt; prepares an exhibit in 2004 tentatively called &quot;Nazi Race Science.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The eugenics movement began in the United States at the beginning of the<br/>
&gt; 20th century. Indiana passed the nation&#39;s first sterilization law based on<br/>
&gt; eugenics in 1907. Over the next seven decades, government hospitals<br/>
&gt; sterilized 60,000 men and women. Only California, with 20,000<br/>
sterilizations,<br/>
&gt; had more than Virginia.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Virginia passed its Eugenical Sterilization Act in 1924 -- which<br/>
targeted<br/>
&gt; &quot;socially inadequate offspring&quot; -- on the same day it passed the Racial<br/>
&gt; Integrity Act prohibiting marriage between whites and nonwhites. Both grew<br/>
&gt; out of eugenicists&#39; drive for what they deemed a superior stock of humans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &quot;Virginia eugenicists saw themselves as the vanguard of the future,&quot;<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; Gregory M. Dorr, a University of Alabama historian who studied Virginia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; role in the eugenics movement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   More than half of Virginia&#39;s sterilizations happened at the Virginia<br/>
Colony<br/>
&gt; for Epileptics and the Feebleminded in Lynchburg, though others happened<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; hospitals in Petersburg, Staunton, Williamsburg and Marion. Most victims<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; white, but some African Americans and Indians also were sterilized,<br/>
&gt; historians say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &quot;People were sterilized not because they were feebleminded, but because<br/>
&gt; they were &#39;poor white trash,&#39; &quot; said Steven Selden, a University of<br/>
Maryland<br/>
&gt; professor who wrote a book on eugenics that was published last year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld forced sterilization at the Lynchburg<br/>
&gt; facility in a case involving a woman named Carrie Buck, who had become<br/>
&gt; pregnant as a teenager. In allowing her sterilization in 1927, Chief<br/>
Justice<br/>
&gt; Oliver Wendell Holmes assessed Buck, her mother and her daughter, then<br/>
&gt; declared, &quot;Three generations of imbeciles are enough.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   A surge of sterilizations followed nationwide, tapering off when Nazi<br/>
&gt; brutality in World War II turned public opinion against eugenics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &quot;The Nazis took great comfort from the eugenics movement in America,&quot;<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; Paul A. Lombardo, a University of Virginia historian.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Forced sterilizations continued on a very limited basis in Virginia<br/>
until<br/>
&gt; 1979. Today&#39;s resolution calls on society to &quot;reject absolutely any such<br/>
&gt; abhorrent pseudo-scientific movement in the future.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   State lawmakers urged particular vigilance at a time when scientists are<br/>
&gt; decoding the human genome and making possible far more profound<br/>
manipulation &gt; of genetic traits than envisioned by eugenicists during the<br/>
last century.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &quot;We&#39;re tampering with DNA, with genes. And scientifically we&#39;re greatly<br/>
&gt; advanced, but morally we have a problem,&quot; warned Del. Mitchell Van Yahres<br/>
&gt; (D-Charlottesville), the resolution&#39;s sponsor. &quot;We don&#39;t want to go down<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; road again.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   A key supporter of House Resolution 607 was the chamber&#39;s top<br/>
Republican,<br/>
&gt; Speaker S. Vance Wilkins Jr., a veteran lawmaker from the small town of<br/>
&gt; Amherst, just north of Lynchburg. He helped the resolution get past a<br/>
&gt; reluctant committee this week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &quot;It&#39;s the right thing to do,&quot; said Wilkins before today&#39;s session.<br/>
&quot;They&#39;re<br/>
&gt; facts of history . . . and we shouldn&#39;t try to cover them up.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Claude A. Allen, Virginia&#39;s secretary of health and human resources,<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; Gov. James S. Gilmore III&#39;s administration had taken no position on the<br/>
&gt; eugenics resolution and is seeking a legal opinion on the threat of civil<br/>
&gt; liability for the state before taking a stand. He said forced<br/>
sterilizations<br/>
&gt; &quot;clearly were atrocious.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   One Virginia victim of sterilization was Jesse Meadows. He was sent to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Lynchburg colony in 1940 after his mother died and his father remarried.<br/>
&gt; Meadows was just 17. More than 60 years later, he can remember the names<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; faces of the two doctors and the nurse who performed a vasectomy against<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; will.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Meadows married after leaving the facility and made a living as a house<br/>
&gt; painter, but he could never have children. Now 78, he lives alone in<br/>
&gt; Lynchburg, in the same neighborhood as several others who were sterilized<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; the colony there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;They ought to apologize for doing something like that, treating them like<br/>
&gt; animals,&quot; Meadows said. &quot;They ruined a lot of people&#39;s lives.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
