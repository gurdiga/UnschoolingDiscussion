<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Question:<br/>
&gt; DD is 8 1/2 and just starting to read. She is interested in easy books but<br/>
&gt; our problem is the subject matter of said books. They are all about little<br/>
&gt; kid topics, starting kindegarten, babyish pictures, etc. Does anyone have<br/>
&gt; ideas on easy readers that are a little more interesting for tweens? (That<br/>
&gt; would inolve babysitting, horses or Mary Kate and Ashley? LOL )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t forget the Little House books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, the Boxcar <br/>
Children series, Betsy, Tacy and Tib books by Maude Hart Lovelace, A series <br/>
of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket (This series might be one to read <br/>
after or at the same time a child is ready to read books like Harry Potter.) <br/>
Moly has loved all these books, she is currently working her way through the <br/>
Lemony Snicket books. <br/>
