<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;HELP!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My 7yo boy is rude and sassy all day long. When I ask him a question, he<br/>
&gt;answers with, &quot;Duh!&quot; If I ask him to do something, he asks why, and when I<br/>
&gt;explain, he argues with me. He pesters constantly to have friends over or to<br/>
&gt;watch more TV. If I say no, he slams out of the room, pouts, yells, calls me<br/>
&gt;mean, etc. When he wants a snack, he yells, &quot;MOM! I&#39;m HUNGRT! Get me<br/>
&gt;something to eat!&quot; And when I object ot that he just doesn&#39;t answer or yells<br/>
&gt;again. Sometimes I&#39;ll lightly rephrase his demand: &quot;Mom, can I have<br/>
&gt;something to eat please?&quot; He ignores me. When I scold or admonish, he tells<br/>
&gt;me to leave him alone or get out of his room. He is a total brat, in other<br/>
&gt;words. Nothing seems to help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Meanwhile, my 3yo boy starts the day by calling me a &quot;dumb butt,&quot; and<br/>
&gt;screams at me when I refuse him anything. He asks for food, then throws it<br/>
&gt;down or ignores it, then screams at me when I dispose of it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On top of it all, the two of them bicker, fight, whine and chase each other<br/>
&gt;around all day. It&#39;s better when we&#39;re out, or if they&#39;re settled in front<br/>
&gt;of the TV, but we can&#39;t do either all day. There are lots of times when<br/>
&gt;we&#39;re just home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I feel hurt and abused. I feel like a terrible mom. I don&#39;t know whether to<br/>
&gt;get strict with them or just back off, but I have had some pretty drastic<br/>
&gt;thoughts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any suggestions or thoughts would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my children are at their worst I find that I am too!<br/>
I think the only solution for me and my family is to stop and reevaluate <br/>
the situation (s) and then begin again<br/>
I find that when I am trying to get the most done they want the most....so <br/>
usually I get them to help in some way and then we have &quot;free&quot; time.<br/>
When my kids are getting &quot;sassy&quot; I find the best solution is to not respond <br/>
in anger.  I almost always find that it is influence from their <br/>
peers.  After the sas I ALWAYS tell them that that type of behavior will <br/>
not be tolerated.  I then discuss the why hows etc of it and it usually <br/>
ends and if it begins again I tell them that I really do not appreciate <br/>
that behavior and if that is all they are gaining from their friendship <br/>
with so and so then maybe it is time to find a new friend.  (that is when I <br/>
am at wits end and the behavior won&#39;t stop).....sometimes it takes weeks, I <br/>
find that my kids are basically on a two-week cycle.  They go into the test <br/>
mom mode and see how much I will tolerate and eventually when they find <br/>
they can&#39;t get the attention that they need in this way (and sometimes all <br/>
they are asking for is some attention) they go back to our acceptable ways <br/>
of life.<br/>
Hope that was understandable I kind of mushed alot of things together but <br/>
my time is so limited<br/>
Have fun<br/>
