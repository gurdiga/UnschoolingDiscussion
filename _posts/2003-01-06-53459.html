&lt;&lt; Ahh! But I believe the readers are primarily ADULTS and very precocious <br/>
 children, who don&#39;t need You Sandra to close doors for them! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra didn&#39;t close any doors for anyone!! What are you not understanding <br/>
about this? Helen made the decision to ban Ned...she&#39;s the list owner. <br/>
Could you please let this drop?<br/>
Are you Ned under a different identity trying to get stuff stirred up?<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just to be perfectly clear about the circumstances, he&#39;s still signed on as<br/>
far as I know. (I think I would remember seeing a notice that he&#39;d<br/>
unsubscribed.) He can read here. He&#39;s just blocked from posting.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect he&#39;s not reading much now, though he indicated on the<br/>
HomeschoolFreedoms list that he was at one point. He posted to<br/>
HEM-Unschooling for a couple of days (last week?) and then disappeared. So I<br/>
suspect he&#39;s found outlets that are more in line with what his passion is,<br/>
like the more political lists and is using his time up there.<br/>
