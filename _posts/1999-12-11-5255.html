&lt;&lt; The Missing Jesus<br/>
 author unknown<br/>
 <br/>
      About a week before Christmas the family bought a new nativity scene.<br/>
 When they unpacked it they found 2 figures of the Baby Jesus. &quot;Someone must<br/>
 have packed this wrong,&quot; the mother said, counting out the figures.  &quot;We<br/>
 have one Joseph, one Mary, three wise men, three shepherds, two lambs, a<br/>
 donkey, a cow, an angel and two babies. Oh, dear!  I suppose some set down<br/>
 at the store<br/>
 is missing a Baby Jesus because we have 2.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      &quot;You two run back down to the store and tell the manager that we have<br/>
 an extra Jesus.  Tell him to put a sign on the remaining boxes saying that<br/>
 if a set is missing a Baby Jesus, call 7126.  &quot;Put on your warm coats, it&#39;s<br/>
 freezing cold out there.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      The manager of the store copied down mother&#39;s message and the next time<br/>
 they were in the store they saw the cardboard sign that read, &quot;If you&#39;re<br/>
 missing Baby Jesus, call 7126.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      All week long they waited for someone to call.  Surely, they thought,<br/>
 someone was missing that important figurine.  Each time the phone rang<br/>
 mother would say, &quot;I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s about Jesus,  &quot;but it never was.  Father<br/>
 tried to explain there are thousands of these scattered over the country and<br/>
 the figurine could be missing from a set in Florida or Texas or California.<br/>
 Those packing mistakes happen all the time.  He suggested just put the extra<br/>
 Jesus back in the box and forget about it. &quot;Put Baby Jesus back in the box!<br/>
 What a terrible thing to do said the children.&quot;  &quot;Surely someone will call,&quot;<br/>
 mother<br/>
 said.  &quot;We&#39;ll just keep the two of them together in the manger until someone<br/>
 calls.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      When no call had come by 5:00 on Christmas Eve, mother insisted that<br/>
 father &quot;just run down to the store&quot; to see if there were any sets left. &quot;You<br/>
 can see them right through the window, over on the counter,&quot; she said. &quot;If<br/>
 are all gone, I&#39;ll know someone is bound to call tonight.&quot; &quot;Run down to the<br/>
 store?&quot; father thundered.  &quot;It&#39;s 15 below zero out there!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      &quot;Oh, Daddy, we&#39;ll go with you,&quot; Tommy and Mary began to put on their<br/>
 coats.  Father gave a long sigh and headed for the front closet.  &quot;I can&#39;t<br/>
 believe I&#39;m doing this,&quot; he muttered.<br/>
 <br/>
      Tommy and Mary ran ahead as father reluctantly walked out in the cold.<br/>
 Mary got to the store first and pressed her nose up to the store window.<br/>
 &quot;They&#39;re all gone, Daddy,&quot; she shouted.  &quot;Every set must be sold.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      &quot;Hooray, Tommy said &quot;The mystery will now be solved tonight!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
       Father heard the news still a half block away and immediately turned<br/>
 on his heel and headed back home. When they got back into the house they<br/>
 noticed that mother was gone and so was the extra Baby Jesus figurine.<br/>
 &quot;Someone must have called and she went out to deliver the figurine,&quot; my<br/>
 father reasoned, pulling off his boots.  &quot;You kids get ready for bed while I<br/>
 wrap mother&#39;s present.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      Then the phone rang.  Father yelled &quot;answer the phone and tell&#39;em we<br/>
 found a home for Jesus.&quot;  But it was mother calling with instructions for us<br/>
 to come to 205 Chestnut Street immediately, and bring three blankets, a box<br/>
 of cookies and some milk.<br/>
 <br/>
      &quot;Now what has she gotten us into?&quot; my father groaned as we bundled up<br/>
 again.  &quot;205 Chestnut.  Why that&#39;s across town. Wrap that milk up good in<br/>
 the blankets or it will turn to ice before we get there.  Why can&#39;t we all<br/>
 just get on with Christmas?  It&#39;s probably 20 below out there now.  And the<br/>
 wind is picking up.  Of all the crazy things to do on a night like this.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      When they got to the house at 205 Chestnut Street it was the darkest<br/>
 one on the block.  Only one tiny light burned in the living room and, the<br/>
 moment we set foot on the porch steps, my mother opened the door and<br/>
 shouted, &quot;They&#39;re here, Oh thank God you got here, Ray! You kids take those<br/>
 blankets into the living room and wrap up the little ones on the couch.<br/>
 I&#39;ll take the milk and cookies.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      &quot;Would you mind telling me what is going on, Ethel?&quot; my father asked.<br/>
 &quot;We have just walked through below zero weather with the wind in our faces<br/>
 all the way.&quot;  &quot;Never mind all that now,&quot; my mother interrupted.  &quot;There is<br/>
 no heat in this house and this young mother is so upset she doesn&#39;t know<br/>
 what to do.  Her husband walked out on her and those poor little children<br/>
 will have a very bleak Christmas, so don&#39;t you complain.  I told her you<br/>
 could fix that oil furnace in a jiffy.<br/>
 <br/>
      My mother strode off to the kitchen to warm the milk while my brother<br/>
 and I wrapped up the five little children who were huddled together on the<br/>
 couch.  The children&#39;s mother explained to my father that her husband had<br/>
 run off, taking bedding, clothing, and almost every piece of furniture, but<br/>
 she had been doing all right until the furnace broke down.<br/>
 <br/>
      &quot;I been doin&#39; washin&#39; and ironin&#39; for people and cleanin&#39; the five and<br/>
 dime,&quot; she said. &quot;I saw your number every day there, on those boxes on the<br/>
 counter.  When the furnace went out, that number kept going&#39; through my<br/>
 mind. 7162  7162.  &quot;Said on the box that if a person was missin&#39; Jesus, they<br/>
 should call you.  That&#39;s how I knew you were good Christian people, willin&#39;<br/>
 to<br/>
 help folks.  I figured that maybe you would help me, too.  So stopped at the<br/>
 grocery store tonight and I called your missus.  I&#39;m not missin&#39; Jesus,<br/>
 mister, because I sure love the Lord.  But I am missin&#39; heat.  I have no<br/>
 money to fix that furnace.<br/>
 <br/>
      &quot;Okay, Okay&quot; said father.  &quot;You&#39;ve come to the right place.  Now lets<br/>
 see. You&#39;ve got a little oil burner over there in the dining room. Shouldn&#39;t<br/>
 be too hard to fix. Probably just a clogged flue. I&#39;ll look it over, see<br/>
 what it needs.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      Mother came into the living room carrying a plate of cookies and warm<br/>
 milk.  As she set the cups down on the coffee table, I noticed the figure of<br/>
 Baby Jesus lying in the center of the table.  It was the only sign of<br/>
 Christmas in the house. The children stared wide-eyed with wonder at the<br/>
 plate of cookies my mother set before them.<br/>
 <br/>
      Father finally got the oil burner working but said &quot;You need more oil.<br/>
 I&#39;ll make a few calls tonight and get some oil. Yes, sir, you came to the<br/>
 right place,&quot; father grinned.<br/>
 <br/>
      On the way home father did not complain about the cold weather and had<br/>
 barely set foot inside the door when he was on the phone.<br/>
 <br/>
      &quot;Ed, hey, how are ya, Ed?&quot;  &quot;Yes, Merry Christmas to you, too. Say Ed,<br/>
 we have kind of an unusual situation here I know you&#39;ve got that pickup<br/>
 truck. Do you still have some oil in that barrel on your truck?  You do?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
      By this time the rest of the family were pulling clothes out of their<br/>
 closets and toys off of their shelves.  It was long after their bedtime when<br/>
 they were wrapping gifts.  The pickup came. On it were chairs, three lamps,<br/>
 blankets and gifts. Even though it was 30 below, father let them ride along<br/>
 in the back of the truck.<br/>
 <br/>
      No one ever did call about the missing figure in the nativity set, but<br/>
 as I grow older I realize that it wasn&#39;t a packing mistake at all. Jesus<br/>
 saves, that&#39;s what He does. from CHRISTIAN NEWSLETTER 12/7/99<br/>
