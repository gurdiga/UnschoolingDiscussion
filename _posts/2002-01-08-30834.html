<div id="ygrps-yiv-529096788">I just heard tonight on CNN President Bush say that there is a new <br/>
bill, saying that all children grades 3 through 8th have to be tested <br/>
yearly on math and reading. Does anyone know about this, and what <br/>
about homeschooled children? In Fla. we&#39;re not required to do this <br/>
right now.</div>

I may be mistaken, but I don&#39;t think it is a bill--I think it is officially<br/>
law.  I know it was passed by both House and Senate and that Bush was<br/>
definitely going to sign it.  I imagine he has by now.<br/>
<br/>
Whether homeschoolers need to be tested is dependent on individual state<br/>
laws.  I don&#39;t know the law for Florida; it would be best to ask someone<br/>
with one of the larger homeschooling organizations there--they will know.<br/>
<br/>
It does not affect Oklahoma homeschoolers at all, thankfully.<br/>
