<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537765419">So...<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was &quot;Pi Day&quot; because it was 3/14 and 314 is close to pi,  <br/>
that fun mathematical concept that separates the inflexible believers  <br/>
from the heathen scientific.<br/>
<br/>
Marty knew it, because it was on the trivia desk calendar he has in  <br/>
the bathroom, and then as he watched the news while eating his  <br/>
oatmeal before work, he heard that Explora, the hands-on science  <br/>
center, was doing something in honor of Pi Day.<br/>
<br/>
I was asleep through that first part, but when he came home for lunch  <br/>
he asked if we could go to Explora when he got home, and so I  <br/>
recruited Holly (woke her up at 2:30) and we were ready to go when he  <br/>
got home.  I asked Keith, but he wanted to work in the garage because  <br/>
it was a warm day.  Fine.<br/>
<br/>
When we got there, the person who had been doing the little Pi  <br/>
business was gone.  It was 4:30 by the time Marty got off work and we  <br/>
got downtown.  But we had fun with the puzzles downstairs and were  <br/>
sitting there as others came in and out of a staff-only door.  They  <br/>
were apparently doing a training session for the teen volunteers.   <br/>
After a while one of the adults asked us if we would be interested in  <br/>
helping them with a trial of a spider, up in the little theater, for  <br/>
half an hour or so.  The kids said sure.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
It was set up as a courtroom and each chair was marked, and some had  <br/>
scripts and costume bits.   I thought Holly might not do well  <br/>
emotionally if it was reading aloud (though I bet she would&#39;ve done  <br/>
great at the reading, but she doesn&#39;t like to be put on the spot  <br/>
without time to work up courage and ask questions).  Marty  <br/>
volunteered to be the bailiff.  I was a witness for the prosecution.   <br/>
I was a fly.  My costume was wings and big funny glasses, only I  <br/>
needed my real glasses to read the script, so I propped those up  <br/>
above mine, which gave me extra eyes and that was more fly-like anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Marty had a work shirt with a badge as his costume.  There were nine  <br/>
speaking parts and five jurors (Holly and the two adult trainers were  <br/>
among those).<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s main part was to swear witnesses in by having them put their  <br/>
left hand on a copy of The Origin of Species and swear to tell the  <br/>
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth (or something).  He  <br/>
was doing his part from memory sometimes, and reading sometimes, but  <br/>
except for the plaintiff, who had one longish speech and did it  <br/>
loudly and well,  Marty was the best.  He pronounced the spider&#39;s  <br/>
name right (Araña) and everyone else missed or guessed or didn&#39;t do  <br/>
the ñ right.  Two others were mumbling school-style, in that way that  <br/>
says if you pronounce each word and keep moving along, it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
matter if others can hear you; you&#39;ve read.<br/>
<br/>
When I was sworn in there was a spotlight right in my eyes and I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t see anyone else.  Kinda fun.  I could only see my script.  I  <br/>
probably had the biggest part of anyone, and one line started off  <br/>
with a &quot;umm... well... but... I... kind of beginning, so for Holly&#39;s  <br/>
amusement I did the Vicky Pollard &quot;yeah, but no, but yeah, but no&quot;  <br/>
instead.  I couldn&#39;t see her reaction but on the way out to the car  <br/>
she said it was fun  that I did the Little Britain bit.<br/>
<br/>
So for free, a bonus lesson at the museum, my kids got to see how  <br/>
high school kids read aloud, and how enthusiastic they can fail to be  <br/>
even in a situation for which they volunteered, and were screened for  <br/>
best-only, and in which they were basically training to work with the  <br/>
public in a happy, chirpy way.  It was kind of sad, really, that  <br/>
those are the kids my kids have been compared with by others who  <br/>
don&#39;t know them, as people who wouldn&#39;t measure up.<br/>
<br/>
All the kids were nice, and friendly, and they&#39;ll all learn a lot  <br/>
working at the museum, and some will probably have their lives wholly  <br/>
enriched and all that good stuff, but as to reading aloud and having  <br/>
fun...   not so much.<br/>
<br/>
The one boy who was so good, Marty and Holly remember as a museum  <br/>
volunteer for at least three years, since the museum was in the  <br/>
mall.  So he&#39;s probably been in that play a couple of times before.<br/>
<br/>
The spider was real.  It was a tarantula.  The jury could go either  <br/>
way on the guilty or not guilty (of scaring a strongman in an alley  <br/>
so much that he dropped and broke his Mr. Universe trophy and  <br/>
suffered mental anguish).  They said not guilty.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see this all the time!  It&#39;s weird how they forget to be in the <br/>
moment, or that the moment has become all about reading and nothing <br/>
else.  Chamille doesn&#39;t read super well, but is never out of the <br/>
moment when she does, her reading has purpose and meaning beyond <br/>
just &quot;reading&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The neighbor girl who is 1 yr older than Chamille, so 13, reads <br/>
picture books to Margaux (4).  The reading is choppy, and doesn&#39;t <br/>
flow.  The story gets lost.  It would almost be better and more fun <br/>
to have her make it up, instead of read.  This is a very smart kid, <br/>
who is put in &quot;special ed&quot; classes because she struggles.  I think <br/>
she struggles with dislexia but no one else seems to think this, <br/>
they just buy the &quot;behind&quot; stuff and put her in &quot;stupid&quot; classes <br/>
(her words).  The first time I heard that she was in &quot;special ed&quot; <br/>
classes I was stunned actually, followed by sadness.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems to be standard.  You&#39;ve summed up about every experience <br/>
that I&#39;ve had with the general population of schooled children.  The <br/>
spark is lost somewhere so deep.  They are relying on the only <br/>
skills that they&#39;ve been taught.  It is sad!  Imagine what a great <br/>
museum it would become (not that it isn&#39;t pretty cool now) if all <br/>
those kids put their real true selves in there, the selves that <br/>
exist buried beneath all that schooling!<br/>
<br/>
Trully, this is where unschooling kids thrive, by putting their <br/>
whole selves into the world.  All of their strengths come forward <br/>
and shine.  This is what I see in my own children as they get older <br/>
and put themselves out into the world.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids are being compared to schooled kids, but always on school <br/>
terms instead of in real ways.  It&#39;s a shame really that the general <br/>
population gets lost on that.</div>

helps anything.  To know that it goes on and on is enough.  THAT is  <br/>
&quot;the knowledge&quot; involved with the concept of &quot;pi,&quot; not the details of  <br/>
how it goes on and on.  Knowing even five or six places doesn&#39;t help  <br/>
anyone with definitions or calculations.<br/>
<br/>
I can remember lots of TV jingles, commercials, from early  <br/>
childhood.  I remember and can recite with the original inflection,  <br/>
and could probably draw it out if I had artistic and animation  <br/>
abilities, the &quot;Channel 11—Good looking!&quot; station identification from  <br/>
some Dallas/Ft. Worth tv station in the late 50&#39;s.  THAT is worthless.<br/>
<br/>
I can sing the theme song (and play the guitar part) of the Dick  <br/>
Bills show which was on in Albuquerque in the 1960&#39;s.  That&#39;s not  <br/>
quite as worthless because it&#39;s a song, and it rhymes &quot;Albuquerque&quot;  <br/>
with &quot;beans and jerkey&quot; (the &quot;b&quot; does an alliteration thing), and it  <br/>
made the call letters (KOB) into a ranch ID, like a brand, for the  <br/>
cowboy purposes of the song.<br/>
<br/>
Ridin&#39; down the trail to ALbuQUERque<br/>
Saddle bags all filled with beans and JERKey<br/>
Headin&#39; for K-Circle-B,<br/>
The TV ranch for you and me—<br/>
K-Circle-B in Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
If I could win a bar bet with that, it would be worth a dollar.  And  <br/>
it amuses my kids sometimes.  And I can remember that Channel 4 is  <br/>
KOB (but I would remember it anyway, and it&#39;s not very valuable to  <br/>
know).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just that I live more in music-and-word land that I think  <br/>
that song is a little more valuable (i.e. less worthless &lt;g&gt;) than  <br/>
the umpty-dozen places of pi.<br/>
<br/>
And bummer Europe can never have pi day. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724697734">Last night I had a rare phone call from my father who has been mostly out of <br/>
my life.  Way back when, he studied to be an engineer and had a career in <br/>
the military.   He told me that he was concerned about my kids learning <br/>
&quot;advanced&quot; math as homeschoolers.  He asked if they knew about pi.<br/>
<br/>
During the last few minutes of my phone conversation, a friend showed up to <br/>
have dinner with us (we had picked up her son earlier because she had a <br/>
meeting and both our dh&#39;s are out of town).  So, I hung up the phone and we <br/>
were eating and talking about the &quot;advanced&quot; math issue.  This friend has a <br/>
master&#39;s degree in English and her dh has a PhD in physics.  Their only <br/>
child goes to PS.<br/>
<br/>
We were discussing my dad&#39;s concern that the kids know about pi, and my <br/>
friend said pi is 2.14.  I said no, It is 3.14 and goes on forever, or at <br/>
least nobody has yet found an end.  She was quite insistent that it was 2, <br/>
not 3, even when I told her about March 14 being pi day.<br/>
<br/>
After dinner, Lisa was on the computer and we asked her to look up the <br/>
correct number for pi, which she did happily.<br/>

&gt; Last night I had a rare phone call from my father who has been  <br/>
&gt; mostly out of<br/>
&gt; my life.  Way back when, he studied to be an engineer and had a  <br/>
&gt; career in<br/>
&gt; the military.   He told me that he was concerned about my kids  <br/>
&gt; learning<br/>
&gt; &quot;advanced&quot; math as homeschoolers.  He asked if they knew about pi.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; During the last few minutes of my phone conversation, a friend  <br/>
&gt; showed up to<br/>
&gt; have dinner with us (we had picked up her son earlier because she  <br/>
&gt; had a<br/>
&gt; meeting and both our dh&#39;s are out of town).  So, I hung up the  <br/>
&gt; phone and we<br/>
&gt; were eating and talking about the &quot;advanced&quot; math issue.  This  <br/>
&gt; friend has a<br/>
&gt; master&#39;s degree in English and her dh has a PhD in physics.  Their  <br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; child goes to PS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We were discussing my dad&#39;s concern that the kids know about pi,  <br/>
&gt; and my<br/>
&gt; friend said pi is 2.14.  I said no, It is 3.14 and goes on forever,  <br/>
&gt; or at<br/>
&gt; least nobody has yet found an end.  She was quite insistent that it  <br/>
&gt; was 2,<br/>
&gt; not 3, even when I told her about March 14 being pi day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After dinner, Lisa was on the computer and we asked her to look up the<br/>
&gt; correct number for pi, which she did happily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672864096">Thanks for the offer.  I wasn&#39;t disturbed by his comments.  I told him, <br/>
since I didn&#39;t want to deal with explaining unschooling to him, that I would <br/>
learn the advanced math along with the kids when the time came.<br/>
<br/>
He lives on the east coast and we are on the west.  He has never seen my <br/>
kids.  He has only seen me once since I was about 8 years old.  It&#39;s kind of <br/>
sad, more sad for him than me.  I lost a relationship with one person (him), <br/>
but he lost with me, my siblings, and all our kids.  Well, I lost two if you <br/>
count my half brother whom I&#39;ve met only once.  My dad can&#39;t even remember <br/>
my two kid&#39;s names and ages from one phone call to the next (about 2 or 3 <br/>
times per year, he calls.)  Gee, you&#39;d think he might take notes or <br/>
something...<br/>
<br/>
I do feel for my children, since dh&#39;s dad died before they were born and <br/>
mine is so far away and not part of our lives, really.  They&#39;ve never had <br/>
IRL grampa.  Fortunately they do know some older people who *do* appreciate <br/>
them.<br/>

I have never thought of pi as &quot;advanced&quot; math. I guess it is because I do so<br/>
much stuff with circles. For example sewing skirts half or full circle. I<br/>
always just think of it as 22/7. <br/>
