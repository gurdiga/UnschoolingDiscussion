<div id="ygrps-yiv-198339744">&quot;do your homework, young lady!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She has a friend over, and the friend must do her homework before they <br/>
can play chess or whatever.  So the friend is teaching Lexie how to <br/>
divide decimals... pretty funny.  She just asked Lexie what times 7 was <br/>
less than 62 or something like that, and Lexie had the answer instantly, <br/>
but then she had to explain to Dana how she got the answer, which was of <br/>
course mental math, and Dana didn&#39;t get it... Of course, she has the <br/>
times tables memorized.... It&#39;s fun to listen to them do this homework.<br/>
