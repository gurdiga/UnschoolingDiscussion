<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726623227">I truly think that most kids want to help out....they just might want to do<br/>
it in ways other than how you are asking them to.  How many times do kids<br/>
come to ask us if they can help us do something and have been told &quot;no, a<br/>
grown up really needs to handle this&quot; or &quot;no, I&#39;m in a giant hurry.  How<br/>
about helping tomorrow?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve done it in the past.  I have 5 kids and the clutter gets<br/>
immense.  I have even posted on here about my kids &quot;not helping and treating<br/>
us poorly&quot;....usually because I&#39;ve placed some pressure on myself and am,<br/>
subconsciously, wanting the kids to pick up extra slack.  So I decided to be<br/>
scientific.  I made a chart of each kids name down 2 columns.  One column<br/>
for when the kids asked if they could help and another for when they did<br/>
something helpful whether asked to or not.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  My 4yo loves to help move laundry from machine to machine.  It<br/>
takes quite a bit longer than if I did it myself but he is offering his help<br/>
to me so he got &quot;credit&quot; on the chart.  Zach loves to carry in groceries,<br/>
not to be helpful, but to get first viewing of whatever treasures I might<br/>
bring home.  Its not altruistic, but it is helpful, so again, he got credit.<br/>
I was in the midst of making soap that wasn&#39;t gelling so I asked Adriane if<br/>
she would get lunch for the little kids.  She did and got &quot;credit&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I did this for about 3 days and was blown away at how helpful the kids are,<br/>
often without being asked.  What I had been getting bummed about wasn&#39;t the<br/>
kids not helping (like I thought) but about the kids not being under my<br/>
control (yuck).<br/>
<br/>
I still do this occassionally when I get into &quot;Why do I have to clean all<br/>
this mess?&quot; mode.  It is always a good reality check.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117119966">Wow, I just found out about this list and it has been<br/>
fascinating reading. It is really helping me figure<br/>
out how to approach unschooling more clearly. My<br/>
question is about the kids helping with household <br/>
maintenance. I do like a pretty tidy house and realize<br/>
that it is not necessarily everyone elses priority.<br/>
But forget *tidy*.  How have you all handled the<br/>
basics? Trash, dishes etc. Have you had a meeting and<br/>
tried to see how the things can get done so that<br/>
everyone agrees?  I like the idea of working things<br/>
out very democratically, where everyone is involved in<br/>
the running of the house or whatever decisions have to<br/>
be made. It is all worked out as a team. Any<br/>
suggestions? <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

How would you get the family to cooperate in meeting those &quot;needs&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t ;-) You recognize those &quot;needs&quot; belong to you. You can do them<br/>
joyfully and ask for help. But it can&#39;t be an order disguised as a question.<br/>
No must be an acceptable answer.<br/>

paying lip service to democracy when everyone but the leaders were<br/>

It *can* be done democratically if the parents recognize the chores belong<br/>
to them and 1) ask the kids for help, 2) accept no as an answer and 3)<br/>
appreciate that however little the child does, that&#39;s less you&#39;ll have to<br/>
do. OR if they make more work than they give, appreciate that you have<br/>
someone who wants to be with you and help you. And maybe that second one is<br/>
best regardless of how much help they are:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141232680">Well I think it&#39;s been about 4 day since I&#39;ve decided to stop asking for <br/>
clean up time in my non coercive/coercive kind of way. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
It hasn&#39;t been half as bad as I expected. Joseph&#39;s room looks pretty much <br/>
the same and the girls room is barely any different except for a small pile <br/>
I scooted off to the side. The playroom has been pretty nice for the most <br/>
part. Aside of course from last night. My kids play with lots of small <br/>
things. Marbles, loose beads and small little plastic people with hinged <br/>
arms and legs. Well I went into the playroom last night and there wasn&#39;t one <br/>
spot not covered by something on the floor. I was shocked but kept it all <br/>
pretty much to myself!!! I asked maybe if the kids thought it was a bit <br/>
messy, they agreed and then I asked if they would want to clean some stuff <br/>
up. Joseph answered no (there&#39;s that no I never get) and I left the room. <br/>
About half an hour later, I made my way back there again and it was <br/>
spotless. I commented on it and Joseph said him and Sierra made a game out <br/>
of it. They each cleaned up 76 things. My, I was impressed.<br/>

I meant to respond to your other post and I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t get<br/>
to it.  <br/>
Dylan asks all the time if he can do something or if he can have<br/>
something even though he knows he doesn&#39;t have to ask.    I got irritated<br/>
with him once, asking if he could have a thing and I said &quot;you know you<br/>
can, why are you asking?&quot;.   I was snappy and not nice.<br/>
But he explained to me that he was asking in case someone else had wanted<br/>
it, or incase we were getting company and if he had some there might not<br/>
be enough left, etc.   He asks out of consideration.   <br/>
I&#39;m so lucky to have a child who models good behavior. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
I felt like crap for getting irritated, but now I understand his desire<br/>
to be polite and thoughtful and I think it&#39;s a very nice quality.   <br/>
Maybe that&#39;s how it is with your kids too.   Maybe they don&#39;t see your<br/>
asking as a covert demand, and therefor still feel like they must ask for<br/>
things.   Maybe they&#39;re  just being considerate.<br/>

Thanks for responding Deb. I&#39;m almost embarrassed to say I never really <br/>
looked at it this way. Just didn&#39;t get why they would ask for things they <br/>
knew were okay to do or have. And since I&#39;ve also stopped the clean up time <br/>
at night, thinking that was a bit coercive on my anal cleaning mode, they&#39;ve <br/>
still been pretty much the same and in fact, neater on their own. I like <br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-65015129">Thankyou Joyce for your reply. I respect your<br/>
opinion very much. I have not read the archives yet<br/>
and hope I am not repeating specific topics too much.<br/>
I dont know how you have arrived at the opinion that<br/>
the chores belong to the parents. It cant be this<br/>
black and white. If this is so, then when does that<br/>
change? Sandra mentioned something about being too<br/>
tired to cook one eve. and that her kids were old<br/>
enough to make something for themselves anyway. Maybe<br/>
the distinction is that we dont have a right to demand<br/>
anything of anyone. But cant we expect a little help.<br/>
Taking some responsibility for oneself? &quot;Expect&quot; may<br/>
even be too harsh a word. But cant we explain that<br/>
(for example, if this were the case) mom or dad have<br/>
xy &z going on and that we cant do all that needs to<br/>
be done and still keep our sweet and happy tones<br/>
going? OK, I guess the answer is that we have to be<br/>
willing to deal with a NO from them. And then they may<br/>
have to deal with certain consequences like their<br/>
laundry doesnt get done or whatever. Am I on the right<br/>
track? <br/>
 I dont really understand how a child in a family is<br/>
not already on the team just by virtue of the fact<br/>
that he/she is a part of the family. ( I believe that<br/>
we all choose very purposefully where to<br/>
incarnate--not that &quot;they did not ask to be born and<br/>
therfore they are not responsible&quot;--like they are<br/>
innocent bystanders or something). Are you saying that<br/>
if they want to eat in their room and dont want to<br/>
pick up the fallen food and then there is a big ant<br/>
infestation that they dont need to take responsibility<br/>
for that? I dont think thats what you mean. I did read<br/>
some of Sandras stuff in the archives related to this.<br/>
That it all depends on whats going on in the family<br/>
etc, who has the time and energy to help clean up the<br/>
mess. We dont want to trash our kids for the sake of<br/>
an ant infestation. I love that point she made. I&#39;m<br/>
just talking about teaching responsibility for ones<br/>
actions. I dont think its a given that the parents are<br/>
responsible for everything. Probably nature will take<br/>
its course in these instances, over time, as it does<br/>
everwhere and the kids will strive to be responsible<br/>
-&quot;because that is their nature&quot;. <br/>

parents who would burn their scalps and arms with cigarettes and break their <br/>
9 month old sister&#39;s BOTH arms? WHY would a child purposefully CHOOSE those <br/>
parents? What about all the children my friend Jerry sees every day through <br/>
his job as DSS spokesman---with injuries so severe that they can&#39;t even be <br/>
printed in the newspaper---too shocking and WAY too graphic!<br/>
<br/>
Children are born to women to want them and love them as well as to women who <br/>
have no use for them! I think it&#39;s a lovely thought if we all have happy, <br/>
sweet childhoods. But the miserable, awful childhoods that exist should prove <br/>
that&#39;s NOT the case! <br/>

<br/>
Do you mean that if your child said no about something, you might retaliate <br/>
by not doing laundry?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I dont really understand how a child in a family is<br/>
not already on the team just by virtue of the fact<br/>
that he/she is a part of the family. ( I believe that<br/>

therfore they are not responsible&quot;--like they are<br/>
innocent bystanders or something). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If YOU believe a child chose to be a part of your family and so whatever you <br/>
do to them was their choice, you&#39;re part of a large new-age subset of people <br/>
who (IN MY OPINION) justify bad behavior with vague tales of reincarnation <br/>
and choices of unborn souls picking the situation they need.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t personally like that.  But whether I like or believe it or you like <br/>
or believe it doesn&#39;t make it so.<br/>
<br/>
There are some Christians (some millions of them) who think God gave them <br/>
those children to do with as they will, that one of the commandments is <br/>
children should honor their mothers and fathers but there are no commandments <br/>
about how to treat children except not to kill them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not operating under either of those scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are will not feel the way I do about children&#39;s rights.  That&#39;s <br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are you saying that<br/>
if they want to eat in their room and dont want to<br/>
pick up the fallen food and then there is a big ant<br/>
infestation that they dont need to take responsibility<br/>
for that? I dont think thats what you mean. I did read<br/>

etc, who has the time and energy to help clean up the<br/>
mess. We dont want to trash our kids for the sake of<br/>
an ant infestation. I love that point she made.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what point I made anymore, but my kids eat in their rooms and we <br/>
don&#39;t have ant infestations.  Some teensy ants came in to the catfood <br/>
bathroom a couple of weeks ago.  I sprayed ant spray along the baseboard and <br/>
I&#39;m still feeding the cats in the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m just talking about teaching responsibility for ones<br/>
actions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I chose to have children.  I don&#39;t belong to a religion that told me to have <br/>
children.  I had children because I wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Taking responsibility for my actions in that instance, I try to make my <br/>
children&#39;s lives comfortable and happy.  I do consider that taking <br/>
responsibility for my actions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Probably nature will take<br/>
its course in these instances, over time, as it does<br/>
everwhere and the kids will strive to be responsible<br/>
-&quot;because that is their nature&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t strive to be responsible.  They&#39;re just kindhearted good <br/>
natured people who have been  nurtured and they&#39;re pretty nurturing back.  <br/>
They&#39;re honest and helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I know other kids who have been parented more harshly and they&#39;re not as nice <br/>
as my kids.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, let&#39;s put it this way. This may take you 5 or 10 minutes to read. But<br/>
it will have taken me at least 10 times that long to write. I take the time<br/>
to answer because I want to and because I usually find some new insight, but<br/>
rather than replying immediately it would be respectful for you to spend at<br/>
least that much time going through the archive to see what others spent that<br/>
much time and more writing very recently.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I dont know how you have arrived at the opinion that<br/>
&gt; the chores belong to the parents.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My goal isn&#39;t improving the state of my house but improving my relationship<br/>
with my daughter. My goal is to put the relationship first and then figure<br/>
out how to fit other things in without damaging it.<br/>
<br/>
Most parents say &quot;I put my children first BUT ...&quot; But that &quot;but&quot; changes<br/>
statement. If you&#39;ve ever made a child cry or get angry or slam doors over<br/>
something to do with the house then at those times the chores are coming<br/>
first. Most parents may feel the times their children come first are enough<br/>
to balance out the times they don&#39;t. (Even more important, I think, is what<br/>
the children think!)<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s your thought, then none of this will make sense.<br/>
<br/>
But one thing that shifted my thinking was realizing I was making withdrawls<br/>
from my relationship with my daughter to pay for something that would be<br/>
gone tomorrow. And I&#39;d have to do that everyday. In 10 years what would I<br/>
have to show for all those withdrawls?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If this is so, then when does that change?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When do (in my opinion) the chores not belong to the parents? Never.<br/>
<br/>
That *doesn&#39;t* mean the parents must chores alone while the kids play until<br/>
the kids leave the house.<br/>
<br/>
Look at it this way. What if your child played a video game every day. What<br/>
if there were parts of the game that he had to do but didn&#39;t like to do to<br/>
get through the day&#39;s task. What if he decided that because you were there<br/>
that automatically made you part of the team in the things he thought were<br/>
important. What if he assigned you parts of the game to do everyday? What if<br/>
he *expected* you to do it just because it was important to him and he<br/>
decided it was your job to help out?<br/>
<br/>
That seems ridiculous. But to kids the things we think are important are<br/>
just as ridiculous. *If* you look at chores from an adult understanding<br/>
you&#39;ll never understand why kids don&#39;t just pitch in. If you look at chores<br/>
from a child&#39;s understanding, you&#39;ll get why the kids feel imposed on.<br/>
<br/>
If your son wanted you to help with his video game, how could he ask? If you<br/>
look at chores from a child&#39;s understanding, then it&#39;s a whole lot easier to<br/>
figure out what are good ways and bad ways you could ask for help to get<br/>
honest to goodness help, not forced conscription.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But cant we expect a little help.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If we model helping them, then they will help us. (On *their* schedule.)<br/>
<br/>
(And the help has to be helping *them* not doing for them the things we<br/>
think they should do. Making dinner isn&#39;t really helping them. Cleaning up<br/>
after them isn&#39;t really helping them. Taking time from what you&#39;re doing to<br/>
do something that they feel is important -- even if and perhaps *especially*<br/>
if you don&#39;t see it as important -- models helping for them.)<br/>
<br/>
If we model that we think it&#39;s fair to conscript help because what we want<br/>
is more important than what they want, then what are they learning about how<br/>
to handle situations where their needs conflict with other people&#39;s needs?<br/>
We&#39;re essentially saying that being bigger and stronger means you get to<br/>
have what you want.<br/>
<br/>
We *can&#39;t* expect them to understand the importance of what we need to do.<br/>
They won&#39;t truly understand until they are adults and choose to do it<br/>
themselves. (And we can&#39;t force that understanding because forcing them to<br/>
do something isn&#39;t the same as knowing you have full freedom of choice to do<br/>
something or not and know the consequences are truly yours to own.)<br/>
<br/>
What we want is to model giving based on the importance someone that we care<br/>
about places on something. We want them to say &quot;Okay&quot; when we ask because we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t ask unless it was something very important. But what we model for<br/>
them is judging the importance *we* place on something and deciding if it&#39;s<br/>
important enough to interrupt for. For instance if they ask us to drive them<br/>
to the store for a new game, we can&#39;t see that as important so we place it<br/>
low on our priority list. But then when we ask them to pick up the toys, we<br/>
don&#39;t accept that as being low on *their* priority list. We expect them to<br/>
put it high on their priority list just because it&#39;s high on ours.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Taking some responsibility for oneself? &quot;Expect&quot; may<br/>
&gt; even be too harsh a word.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re assuming that if you give then you&#39;re entitled to get something back.<br/>
But giving means you&#39;re doing it because you have a gift that you want to<br/>
give someone *not* because you expect something in return.<br/>
<br/>
If, for instance, you decided you wanted to give them a big yard to play in,<br/>
why would the job of maintaining that yard then fall on the kids? Is it<br/>
really a gift if they&#39;re required to maintain it to your standards? And if<br/>
it&#39;s theirs then can they decide to turn it into a meadow so they can keep<br/>
it to their standards?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But cant we explain that<br/>
&gt; (for example, if this were the case) mom or dad have<br/>
&gt; xy &z going on and that we cant do all that needs to<br/>
&gt; be done and still keep our sweet and happy tones<br/>
&gt; going? OK, I guess the answer is that we have to be<br/>
&gt; willing to deal with a NO from them. And then they may<br/>
&gt; have to deal with certain consequences like their<br/>
&gt; laundry doesnt get done or whatever. Am I on the right<br/>
&gt; track? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. The kids are not responsible for your emotions. Your emotions are yours.<br/>
If you&#39;re getting upset, then it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re trying to control<br/>
them and they aren&#39;t cooperating. You&#39;re trying to get them to do what you<br/>
want them to do.<br/>
<br/>
One answer is to figure out how to stop wanting whatever it is you want them<br/>
to do. Another is to figure out how to get what you want without depending<br/>
on them. Another is to tackle the thing you&#39;re getting upset about and<br/>
figure out how to minimize task. (Rethinking how you do laundry. How the<br/>
family gets fed. Where toys get put away. There are probably parts that you<br/>
do that you really don&#39;t need to like folding, or sorting or having 3 meals<br/>
a day. If your kids are more important then it will be important to really<br/>
rethink the things you think are necessary and figure out how they can stop<br/>
you from damaging your relationship with your kids.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I dont really understand how a child in a family is<br/>
&gt; not already on the team just by virtue of the fact<br/>
&gt; that he/she is a part of the family. ( I believe that<br/>
&gt; we all choose very purposefully where to<br/>
&gt; incarnate--not that &quot;they did not ask to be born and<br/>
&gt; therfore they are not responsible&quot;--like they are<br/>
&gt; innocent bystanders or something).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your belief doesn&#39;t cause your children to be born with that understanding<br/>
and outlook. *If* they chose you -- and I find the thought as disturbing as<br/>
Kelly -- children behave as though they chose *us*, not our chores or the<br/>
maintainences on the so-called gifts we give them. What they came for is our<br/>
love and time. Not the work we can get them to do to maintain the life we<br/>
want to &quot;give&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;d prefer to live with you in a tar paper shack so that they could<br/>
have the freedom to be messy and have more time to spend with you and your<br/>
husband. So anything else you spend time on is giving them gifts that they<br/>
don&#39;t really want. They are gifts that *you* want to give them. It helps our<br/>
attitude a lot to see what we give them as things *we* want to provide and<br/>
*not* as something we expect them to appreciate. Then we can accept<br/>
ownership of them. Or drop them if we realize we&#39;ve been doing something<br/>
only because we felt we had to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; just talking about teaching responsibility for ones<br/>
&gt; actions. I dont think its a given that the parents are<br/>
&gt; responsible for everything. Probably nature will take<br/>
&gt; its course in these instances, over time, as it does<br/>
&gt; everwhere and the kids will strive to be responsible<br/>
&gt; -&quot;because that is their nature&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*You* chose to bring them into the world. How are you not responsible for<br/>
everything? Even if your beliefs say you aren&#39;t responsible for the<br/>
particular souls you ended up with, you are responsible for making it<br/>
possible for them to arrive. They didn&#39;t appear without your involvement!<br/>
<br/>
People will strive to be responsible for what they feel ownership in. And<br/>
they will feel responsible to the level that they feel is important to them.<br/>
<br/>
How could your husband teach you to feel responsible for keeping the garage<br/>
floor spotless? From your kids&#39; points of view that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking of<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you saying that<br/>
&gt; if they want to eat in their room and dont want to<br/>
&gt; pick up the fallen food and then there is a big ant<br/>
&gt; infestation that they dont need to take responsibility<br/>
&gt; for that? I dont think thats what you mean. I did read<br/>
&gt; some of Sandras stuff in the archives related to this.<br/>
&gt; That it all depends on whats going on in the family<br/>
&gt; etc, who has the time and energy to help clean up the<br/>
&gt; mess.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are seeing that the relationship between parents and chldren is a battle<br/>
of wills. It&#39;s about who gets to do what they want.<br/>
<br/>
I see it as being there to help kids live life.<br/>
<br/>
Why would kids *want* to do things that are destructive or don&#39;t make sense?<br/>
The answer is that they don&#39;t. (Unless things are forbidden or controlled.)<br/>
But there is something that is preventing them from making the connection<br/>
between their actions and the consequences. It could be that they&#39;re just<br/>
oblivious to their environment. It could be they haven&#39;t truly made the<br/>
connection between bugs and food. (Understanding a fact (bugs like food)<br/>
isn&#39;t the same as understanding that it applies in a particular situation.<br/>
And maybe it doesn&#39;t! Does it make sense that bugs outside will &quot;know&quot;<br/>
there&#39;s food in a bedroom? *Especially* if you are in the habit of saying<br/>
something *will* happen when in truth it *may* happen.)<br/>
<br/>
If we approach life with them with the attitude that what they need is<br/>
information or skills or reminders, and once we stop trying to make them be<br/>
the way we want them to be and accept where they are, then life is a lot<br/>
less stress filled.<br/>
<br/>
If they accept that food in bedrooms equals bugs, when you see them heading<br/>
to their bedrooms with food you can keep reminding them that it&#39;s a better<br/>
idea to eat in the kitchen and suggest that they could bring something to<br/>
their food. (How to Talk So Kids Will Listen has a lot of good tips about<br/>
wording to use.) If you&#39;ve reminded them numerous times, it could be they<br/>
just aren&#39;t aware enough of what they&#39;re doing and you&#39;ll have to wait for<br/>
maturity to take care of understanding what they&#39;re hearing. And accept that<br/>
you&#39;ll have to make plate sweeps a couple of times a day.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example of not remembering. Our bathroom is dark but is off a very<br/>
bright hall. The light switch is outside the door. Now I really want to<br/>
conserve electricity and I don&#39;t want to leave lights on unnecessarily. But<br/>
as you&#39;re coming out of the bathroom, there&#39;s no visual clue to remind you<br/>
that the light behind you is on because it&#39;s so bright in the hallway. So I<br/>
often forget.<br/>
<br/>
How could someone help me to remember? Should they tell me to get up from<br/>
what I&#39;m doing later and turn off the light? Should they get angry because<br/>
I&#39;m 46 yo and am old enough to remember for myself? Or should whoever&#39;s<br/>
passing by just turn off the light?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973352162">Thankyou Joyce and Sandra for your replies. I have<br/>
so many thoughts going through my head on this topic.<br/>
I am going to find the archives before I comment<br/>
further. I&#39;m really sorry I didn&#39;t do that already.<br/>
Actually I did but wasnt sure I found all the<br/>
discussions you were talking about. I did find some<br/>
but suspected there were more and then procrastinated<br/>
because making my way around computers still<br/>
intimidates and exhausts me a little. Thankyou for<br/>
pointing out how much time went into them. <br/>
  You both made excellent points. Joyce, your examples<br/>
were brilliant, really helpful. I really am totally on<br/>
the same page as far as respecting children. I&#39;m just<br/>
learning more of how it manifests day to day in<br/>
different situations. I dont have any career agenda or<br/>
anything that comes before my children. Probably my<br/>
main passion is protecting and defending and loving<br/>
children. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295620600">Kathy - I like the way this kind of stuff is talked about in the &quot;How <br/>
to Talk so Kids will Listen and....&quot; books.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not much of a housekeeper (understatement of the year) and my kids <br/>
don&#39;t get asked to do much, since I&#39;m not doing much either. But - if <br/>
they are walking through the living room to get clean laundry off the <br/>
floor, wearing a wet towel from their shower, and if they drop the wet <br/>
towel on the couch and put on their clean clothes right there - I will <br/>
say: &quot;Wet towel?&quot; and they&#39;ll pick it up and hang it up. If they don&#39;t <br/>
- if they get distracted - I&#39;ll just do it.<br/>
<br/>
I often say: &quot;Hey Roxana - can you find time in the next hour or so to <br/>
do a couple of things to help get the house under control?&quot; She&#39;ll <br/>
decided what needs doing (she&#39;s 15) or she&#39;ll ask me what I want and <br/>
I&#39;ll say: &quot;Well - unload the dishwasher and fold that laundry on the <br/>
living room floor and put it on each person&#39;s bed.&quot; Often I&#39;ll ask her <br/>
to declutter some specific area of the house - like clear off and put <br/>
away all the stuff on the dining room table. Sometimes she is too <br/>
involved in what she&#39;s doing and she forgets. Gee, kind of like ME!!! <br/>
So I remind her and she does it -- or if she&#39;s run out of time, then I <br/>
just let it go.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s the most cooperative of my three kids, in this regard. That&#39;s <br/>
because she LIKES things to be more orderly - I&#39;m sure she&#39;d help even <br/>
more if I was into it &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d LOVE to have a clean orderly house - but I can&#39;t drag myself away <br/>
from talking to all of YOU to get around to making that happen!!!<br/>
