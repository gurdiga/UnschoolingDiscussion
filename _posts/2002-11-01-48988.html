&lt;&lt; I&#39;m new here & was wondering what exactly do &quot;unschoolers&quot; do <br/>
in a normal day?Do you ever do workbooks,etc.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have all owned workbooks.  Some were given to us, some they picked <br/>
out at Toys&#39;RUs or a bookstore, some I bought because they had some sort of <br/>
puzzle the kids were liking.  They&#39;re treated like coloring books, maze <br/>
books, word-search... they go in the pile of books to pick up and mess with <br/>
if you feel like it.  <br/>
<br/>
There was one good Animaniacs math book that got a fair amount of use.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have never completel finished a coloring book or a workbook.  I would <br/>
no more make them work in one than in the other.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I was wondering what many of you do in a <br/>
normal day to teach your kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do little to nothing to teach them, but I am kind of having my radar out <br/>
for being there if they&#39;re trying to do, learn, or puzzle something out and <br/>
they might be stuck or frustrated, and I might boost or nudge.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t get into my van.  I can get up to the door into a good position.  But <br/>
someone else has to boost me up far enough for me to get onto the seat.  This <br/>
is recent and temporary.  When I have a walking cast instead of &quot;don&#39;t put <br/>
weight on this,&quot; I&#39;ll be able to get in myself.  So it&#39;s kind of like that.  <br/>
They can get in position to complete an idea or a project, and if it looks <br/>
like they need a word spelled, or a suggestion for which kind of glue to use, <br/>
or where to look for something, I&#39;ll nudge or boost.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow night I have to get into the van again.  We&#39;re going to see Fiddler <br/>
on the Roof.  I get to sit in the wheelchair row.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- how to make a &quot;schedule&quot; of what to do.Any <br/>
help/advice would be appreciahas to be anywhere except Kirby goes to work <br/>
from 3:00 to 7:30 or so.  Tuesday Kirby has karate:  teaches, then has a <br/>
class, then two hours of kobudo (weapons) with the adults.<br/>
So far the week sounds like Kirby&#39;s all organized!  But most of the week <br/>
Kirby is out and about with older friends, playing board games, playing card <br/>
games, playing video games, hanging around IHOP where one of them works.  <br/>
Wednesday Holly has a fiddle lesson.  Keith has &quot;fighter practice&quot; (armored <br/>
combat, SCA, or did until lately;  They quit when daylight savings time and <br/>
coldness arrive).  Etc.<br/>
<br/>
Other than those kinds of appointments, we have some checklists and deadline <br/>
considerations.  It&#39;s not a structure that looks like school.  It&#39;s a <br/>
structure that looks like my life has always looked.  Too much stuff, too <br/>
many commitments, lots of movies and music and jokes and people in and out.  <br/>
<br/>
New things come into the house, they&#39;re examined, discussed, named, played <br/>
with, shown around, and eventually put somewhere.  Maybe eaten, if <br/>
appropriate.  Things to leave the house, we check whether others approve of <br/>
it being given away or whatever, we discuss it, it&#39;s delivered or mailed or <br/>
given to charity or whatever.  That&#39;s a lot of categorization, verbal and <br/>
mental.<br/>
<br/>
The trick-or-treaters have returned.  It&#39;s 10:16.  There were several teens <br/>
and two younger girls (10 and 12).  When they finished our neighborhood, they <br/>
got in two vehicles and drove to the neighborhood of the granny of one of <br/>
them, and did some more.<br/>
<br/>
Every year before this I have claimed some candy as a fee for walking around <br/>
with a trick-or-treater.  THIS year for the first time I shall have to simply <br/>
beg politely.  <br/>
<br/>
I saved some milk from the dinner Keith brought me, to wash down the candy I <br/>
hope I will receive.  Keith has gone to bed.  I will too, soon, on the couch, <br/>
by the fire, under the influence of pain killers and muscle relaxers.  I will <br/>
sleep the fitful twitchy sleep of the drugged.<br/>
<br/>
One weird effect of the drugs when I was taking them more frequently, the <br/>
first two weeks, was interesting.  I would kind of talk in my sleep, but not <br/>
talk at all.  It was moving my hands in my sleep, which I&#39;ve never done <br/>
before.  I would be dreaming of doing something, and would move my hands in <br/>
the same way sometimes people talk in their sleep.  I know, because I would <br/>
wake myself up with it.  One night I dreamed of sorting warm laundry, to fold <br/>
towels.  I was pulling on my shirt, and it wasn&#39;t lifting up, but I kept <br/>
grabbing the cloth and pulling it.  I dreamed I was eating, and I touched my <br/>
hand to my mouth.  I dreamed someone was giving me a taste of something, and <br/>
I opened my mouth and lifted my head up, and it woke me up.  I have reached <br/>
out my arm to touch something.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Holly if I could please have some of her candy.  She said, &quot;Sure, but <br/>
first we&#39;re going to clean up the bathroom some because we made a mess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The mess, she had warned me about.  They got glitter in the bathroom I&#39;m <br/>
using.  It has a big mirror, and she and Jasmine did their face paints in <br/>
there.  Jasmine was a statue, so her makeup was all white, with a little <br/>
glitter.  Holly was a peacock, so she had several colors and lots of glitter. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I recommended wet toilet paper.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty cool that they thought of cleaning that mess up as soon as they <br/>
were done trick-or-treating.  It wasn&#39;t my idea or suggestion.  They wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have &quot;been in trouble&quot; if they didn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
Here we have a child who has always been allowed to eat all the candy she <br/>
wants, and on the biggest candy-night, following four and a half hours of <br/>
mostly trick or treating, she chooses to... clean a bathroom.<br/>

<br/>
Bathroom cleaned, Holly came in.  I asked if people had known she was a <br/>
peacock. She said yes, and one guy said, &quot;A Peacock! Very artistic!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So, chitchat done, I said &quot;Can I have candy now?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;Jasmine and I are going to take showers upstairs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;But I saved some milk and it will get warm!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;Our plan was to shower and change and then exchange candy.  Drink <br/>
your milk, and I&#39;ll bring you some more to drink with the candy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
**sigh**<br/>
<br/>
Maturity.  Why does she have more than I do?<br/>
