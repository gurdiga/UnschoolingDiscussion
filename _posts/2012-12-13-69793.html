<br/>
I nearly didn&#39;t let the post through, because we weren&#39;t talking about apps; we were talking about parenting and unschooling.  So I don&#39;t want to encourage people to come here and ask about what shoes to buy or mini-vans, or juice boxes.  Unschoolers might use them, but it&#39;s not about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
These are good for twelve year olds or for teens or adults or younger children.  They&#39;re clear, plain logic, and they&#39;re also all beautiful and multi-layered.  (Flow Free is not so layered, but is especially beautiful.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
plants vs. zombies at $6.99 is the most expensive thing I&#39;ve bought for iPad,<br/>
and it was worth much more.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the games we play here lately have free versions and then some paid at<br/>
$1.99 or 99¢, and that is less than a greeting card, and Keith, Marty and I have<br/>
played them for MANY hours. Those games would be easy enough for a four year<br/>
old with spatial skills, or to play as a two-player game (take turns, and let<br/>
him have the easy plays):<br/>
<br/>
Flow Free (there are add-on levels for a dollar or two)<br/>
<br/>
Flip Pix Art  (some are free; there are about ten of them altogether, I think)<br/>
             After Joyce&#39;s husband saw this game, he took it to work and the other professors were playing it, too. <br/>
             My engineer husband plays it nearly every night, and has been doing HexLogic some too, but Flip Pix is his favorite.<br/>
             Julie Daniel is really good at it, as is my son Marty.  Marty has played them all and said only once did he have to guess something; there&#39;s always a clue.<br/>
	     There are easier levels, and harder ones.<br/>
<br/>
Flip Pix Jigsaw (there are several of these, none expensive)<br/>
<br/>
HexLogic (there are four, and probably will be five with a few weeks if there aren&#39;t already)<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all by Gabysoft except for Flow Free which is by Big Duck games. It<br/>
might help to put the maker in when you search.<br/>
<br/>
Try googling logic games for iPad, though.  Youll get images and reviews.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29279348">This year, we&#39;ve been liking:<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;s The Water?<br/>
<br/>
Cut The Rope<br/>
<br/>
Tiny Places<br/>
<br/>
Cover Orange<br/>
<br/>
Greedy Spider<br/>
<br/>
Granny Smith<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;s Waldo?<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;s Waldo in Hollywood?<br/>
<br/>
Monster Physics<br/>
<br/>
Hobby Farm<br/>
<br/>
Princess Fairy Tale Maker* <br/>
<br/>
[*This last one has an unfortunate name, but it&#39;s actually really cool because you can choose characters and backdrops frame-by-frame to make your own &quot;animated&quot; storyboards, put all the frames together into one long story, and record a voice over. Then you can save it and play it back for people.]<br/>

<br/>
All of the above-mentioned games are also fun to play as a family! It&#39;s really cozy when we snuggle in my bed, one daughter on each side, and help strategize the games together.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve explored lots of other apps, but about half we got were duds. So the above list is the best of what we&#39;ve seen this year.<br/>
<br/>
I am amazed by apps, and all my family learns from them. And so inexpensive, too! We live in extraordinary times. <br/>
<br/>
Parents who restrict their children&#39;s access to iPads and apps are, in my opinion, really missing out on some seriously fun learning. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976577109">Someone wrote to recommend Lemonade Stand.<br/>
I deleted the post because she didn&#39;t have any particular, personal information about it and had appended two long posts with it.<br/>
<br/>
Dear everybody:  <br/>
Only quote what&#39;s necessary.  Often that&#39;s nothing.<br/>
When you recommend something, please give some details, and why you&#39;re recommending it.  Make it about unschooling.<br/>
