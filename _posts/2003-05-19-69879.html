<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294465759">I wanted to share the weekend we had because it&#39;s just so cool.<br/>
<br/>
It was a busy weekend. Julian, who is 13, has been preparing to sign with the <br/>
cool group called the Mystic Chorale. It&#39;s a group of over 200 singers, then <br/>
a jazz band and drummers, all older than him, only one other teen. It&#39;s been <br/>
ten weeks of getting him to Arlington for rehearsals, which is just far <br/>
enough to be a pain in the ass. (Whoever drives ends up sitting around for <br/>
hours during the rehearsal.) But he had two concerts this weekend and it was <br/>
incredible. Really amazing music. And Julian just glowed up there!<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that happened this weekend was we had Children&#39;s Sunday at <br/>
the Unitarian Universalist church where I am the Director of Religious <br/>
Education. I do Children&#39;s Sunday a bit differently than a lot of <br/>
churches...it tends to be mostly adult-driven, with the kids doing <br/>
presentations for the adults. Instead, I have the kids lead a real, regular <br/>
service for the adults. Usually I work out the details, and the kids sign up, <br/>
but this year, the kids did most of the planning. They chose the hymns and <br/>
readings, they figured out homilies, etc. They also did original artwork on <br/>
each of the covers for the orders of service.  Julian sang &quot;The Circle Game,&quot; <br/>
and other kids did other music, including one kid who wrote a welcome song <br/>
and sang it. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the kids wrote and performed a short play on Creation, this hilarious <br/>
thing that started with the Bible Creation story (God said, Let there be <br/>
light. And a kid comes out and puts a flashlight on the worship table. On the <br/>
seventh day, God rested, and one kid came out with a teddy bear and blankie, <br/>
looked around at all the props taken out earlier, gave a smile and a <br/>
thumbs-up, then curled up on the floor with a yawn.), then a Chinese creation <br/>
myth of an egg, then, using one of those popper things that makes a loud <br/>
noise and send out streamers, we had The Big Bang, followed by a rain of <br/>
beanie babies. The end line was &quot;And it was good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were amazing!!!!  The adults of the congregation were so impressed with <br/>
what an incredible job they did. <br/>
<br/>
Now Kathryn must rest (and play with her new expansion for The Sims!!!!)<br/>
