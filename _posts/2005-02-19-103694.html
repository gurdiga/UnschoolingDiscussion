<div id="ygrps-yiv-60345878">-=-If a person (and I mean anyone) could live their lives however they wanted doing whatever<br/>
they wanted, how ever they wanted, where would be the challenge? Where would be the test?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Challenge is inevitable.  Creating false hardship as a test is cruel.<br/>
<br/>
And you do live your life doing what you want.  You seem to really want to be with your child, and you&#39;re choosing to do that.  I commend you for your choices there.  If you doubt you&#39;re making choices, please read this:<br/>

Earlier in the same post:<br/>
<br/>
-=-We lost several family members (close relations) within in few months period. It was so bewildering and life changing. We suddenly had no money. I mean, no money. It was actually quite terrifying.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t that a test of everything? And naturally occurring.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I believe my son is being challenged daily because he&#39;s learning to live with people and around people and compromising and finding that you don&#39;t always get your way, period. There are things that must be done, so put down that game and get to it. I need you to help with the laundry because I can&#39;t get down the steps<br/>
today. Or I need you to help with the dishes because I can&#39;t hold them. Your cat needs to be fed and you will do it... sorry, turn off the tv there are things to be done. -=-<br/>
<br/>
From those specific examples, it sounds like you&#39;re doing more than asking for his help.  You&#39;re telling him when and how to do the things your way.  Otherwise, you could ask him to turn the game off when he gets to a good stopping place, rather than &quot;so put down that game and get to it.&quot;  Are you partners, or are you the manager and he&#39;s the employee?<br/>
<br/>
Cats need to eat, but food can be put down in any thirty second window.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a specific one.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-My son doesn&#39;t have a sense of time. He doesn&#39;t understand the passing of time until it&#39;s gone. He is always shocked when the day turns to evening and so much time has passed.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Shocked in a bad way, or surprised to have had so much fun and not even noticed the time has passed?  The latter isn&#39;t so bad.  How many of us have read until it got too dark to read and hadn&#39;t realized how much time had passed.  It&#39;s pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
-=-The idea that things fit into half an hour slots continually seems confusing to him and it makes him angry because of it. So, I say, time&#39;s up, you&#39;ve been there for two hours, time to do something else &#39;cause Mom needs help. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Things don&#39;t &quot;fit into half an hour slots continually.&quot;  WHAT things?  Half hour sitcoms, but you don&#39;t have TV.  Why think of your life as half hour slots in the absence of TV? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, I say, time&#39;s up, you&#39;ve been there for two hours, time to do something else-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s arbitrary.  If you need help, you need help when you need it, and two hours isn&#39;t a real measure of need or of anything else (except those 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. movie slots on TV, and you don&#39;t have TV).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Time to do something else&quot; isn&#39;t a friend to natural learning, nor to peace, nor to someone&#39;s involvement in something fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
-=-As far as a TV being another window to the world... in some cases I believe you are correct. But over all, it&#39;s not like that for me.  That&#39;s my personal view. Whether my son would agree with that or not, I don&#39;t know,-=-<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s free to make different decisions different days, different hours, different moments, you don&#39;t need to know.  Things change.  Kids&#39; needs change.<br/>
<br/>
You have an only child and you&#39;re not well.  Why deprive him of a window to the world just because you don&#39;t need one?  You&#39;ve been to school, you&#39;ve been out there.  He&#39;s twelve and has no siblings and no dad. Maybe he could use TV if for no other reason than to consider situations of sibling interaction and of larger families.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, I think, really, the larger issue here, the bigger debate, would be whether we influence our children and their choices or not? I would have to say we do. Even if we don&#39;t mean to. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we influence our children all the time.<br/>
Limitations aren&#39;t &quot;influence.&quot;  They&#39;re limits.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would say that children watch us and they make their choices based on a lot different things... but they watch us and they do learn from us and we definately learn from them. We learn soooooo much from them it&#39;s amazingly wonderful. Why isn&#39;t it equally wonderful to have that available for a child?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
That they can learn from their children?<br/>
That they can learn from watching and thinking?<br/>
Why should it be just one parent he&#39;s watching and thinking about and learning from?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think a little challenge is a danged good thing. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think the world is full of challenges and parents shouldn&#39;t impose them on children.<br/>
