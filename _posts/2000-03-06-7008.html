<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133923168">On one of my lists, a friend of mine got the LONG form for the census. She<br/>
posted wanting to know if she HAD to fill out the entire thing. I am moving<br/>
to Kansas (Hi Bonnie!) in April, and wanted to know about writing that on<br/>
the form, too, so catch two ?? with one call. The following is what the<br/>
bureau said to do if you feel that you do NOT want to answer all the<br/>
questions. I do cherish my freedom and privacy, so I did this for me too.<br/>
Only one in a few hundred gets the long form.<br/>
Whatever you feel is something that you do not want to fill out write in<br/>
&quot;refuse&quot;, &quot;do not know&quot;, etc...<br/>
Make a notation that you feel this is something that you are not going to<br/>
answer.<br/>
If you fill out half of the form, they will accept it.<br/>
If you do not fill out half of the form, a census worker will come out to<br/>
you home...<br/>
She also said fill out as much as you want.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that none of you go as beans as my friend is...<br/>
Blessings-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221484833">** I believe the envelope has to do with the section of the letter asking<br/>
<br/>
folks if they want part-time work. **<br/>
<br/>
Nah. It&#39;s so you can send the letter back with one of the options on the back <br/>
checked, requesting the census forms in another language. In general, if <br/>
people have to find an envelope themselves, they won&#39;t bother.<br/>
<br/>
One request per neighborhood processed through the mail so that the home <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be visited by an enumerator pays for the cost of all those <br/>
envelopes to the entire neighborhood. Stationary isn&#39;t very expensive in <br/>
these quantities, ya know?<br/>
