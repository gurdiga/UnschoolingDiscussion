<div id="ygrps-yiv-630166534">Thanks Karen,<br/>
My hubby is away on business, so I am a single mom so to speak and I have <br/>
been sooo tempted to hook up the VCR several times just to get a break.... <br/>
but I keep think of how hard it was to break the &quot;habit&quot; and have  resisted <br/>
temptation.  We haven&#39;t had the tv on in almost a week with the exception of <br/>
one 30 min show for Ali, while I chatted on line with family and about 10 min <br/>
Saturday night before bed.  I can&#39;t say that I have missed it.  I just <br/>
thought &quot;what shall we do now?&quot;  then off to do something else, like tons of <br/>
reading....a good thing.  Ali is loving it..... <br/>
<br/>
Hubby will be back on Friday, while I am excited to see him, I sooooo shall <br/>
miss the quiet, peaceful evenings.  Both the kids and I are much more relaxed <br/>
without the blaring box.<br/>
<br/>
I not sure what to do about this evening tv thing....with my hubby... anyone <br/>
have anything that worked for them...I guess I can disassemble it somehow <br/>
(both of them) but knowing my hubby he would race out the door to get a new <br/>
one...I would never be able to keep a straight face if I tried to tell him it <br/>
is not working.  He would know I was up to something.  I can&#39;t keep anything <br/>
from him, knows me too well.....hee hee hee<br/>

Hee hee-- let me know if you get away with it.  :)  Well, my boys are <br/>
watching 1 hour this morning while I am online.  Then everything is off until <br/>
later this afternoon.  My boys are not really into reading like many kids are <br/>
already.  They do not *yet* have this passion for books that I hope will one <br/>
day occur.  They see dh and myself with books constantly, and they have an <br/>
enormous book shelf full, but the interest is really hit and miss at this <br/>
point.  My oldest will be 6 at the end of Sept. and my 2nd oldest will be 4 <br/>
at the end of Nov.  So, it does not seem to me to unusual at all that they <br/>
are not reading or want to be read to the majority of the time, but still, I <br/>
look forward to when it does happen!  ~Karen</div>
