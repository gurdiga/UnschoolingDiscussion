<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389916883">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
Max has been having a hard time going to bed lately and seemed frightened,<br/>
yet didn&#39;t want to sleep with us.  We&#39;ve discovered that he and Zak want to<br/>
share a room.  I hope that works out because it seems to be something they<br/>
want to do at the moment....Learning to let them go is harder for me than<br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
