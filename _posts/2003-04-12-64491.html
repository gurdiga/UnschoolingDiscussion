 </span></blockquote>Busy? It runs hot and cold, but I&#39;d suggest that no one mention how &quot;slow&quot; <br/>
the list might be one day---that tends to send it into a whirlwind of <br/>
activity! In the &quot;be-careful-what-you-ask-for way! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Contentious? Umm...Yes and No.  &lt;g&gt; Certain things&#39;ll get it going more than <br/>
others! Spanking&#39;ll draw it out pretty fast! Chores. Christianity---almost <br/>
always! &lt;g&gt; Arguing for the sake of arguing---that&#39;ll do it! <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a wonderful place if you want to learn about unschooling and peaceful <br/>
parenting---there&#39;s no better (the message boards are good too! and has a few <br/>
other voices that don&#39;t show here!)!  Sometimes it&#39;s best to just sit back <br/>
and read.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome! <br/>
