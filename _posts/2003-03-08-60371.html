<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038764178">I wrote this for my Ohio unschooling list, but I had such fun with it I <br/>
wanted to share it here.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We got out an old 1994 Disney Collection Video of Singalong Songs. It was <br/>
&quot;Circle of Life&quot;, and it featured several songs from Lion King, The Little <br/>
Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and several more. My reactions to these songs <br/>
are so different than before I became an unschooling advocate. Some of these <br/>
songs provoke feelings in me of being trapped in a school without choice, and <br/>
<br/>
longing for freedom. Take a look at some of these lyrics, it&#39;s <br/>
remarkable.....<br/>
<br/>
I JUST CAN&#39;T WAIT TO BE KING from THE LION KING<br/>
No one saying do this<br/>
No one saying be there<br/>
No one saying stop that<br/>
No one saying see here<br/>
(Now see here!)<br/>
Free to run around all day<br/>
Free to do it all my way<br/>
<br/>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid<br/>
<br/>
But who cares?<br/>
No big deal<br/>
I want more<br/>
<br/>
I wanna be where the people are<br/>
I wanna see<br/>
Wanna see &#39;em dancin&#39;<br/>
Walkin&#39; around on those<br/>
(Whad&#39;ya call &#39;em?) oh - feet<br/>
Flippin&#39; your fins you don&#39;t get too far<br/>
Legs are required for jumpin&#39;, dancin&#39;<br/>
Strollin&#39; along down a<br/>
(What&#39;s that word again?) street<br/>
<br/>
Up where they walk<br/>
Up where they run<br/>
Up where they stay all day in the sun<br/>
Wanderin&#39; free<br/>
Wish I could be<br/>
Part of that world<br/>
<br/>
What would I give<br/>
If I could live<br/>
Outta these waters?<br/>
What would I pay<br/>
To spend a day<br/>
Warm on the sand?<br/>
Betcha on land<br/>
They understand<br/>
Bet they don&#39;t reprimand their daughters<br/>
Bright young women<br/>
Sick o&#39; swimmin&#39;<br/>
Ready to stand<br/>
<br/>
And ready to know what the people know<br/>
Ask &#39;em my questions<br/>
And get some answers<br/>
What&#39;s a fire and why does it<br/>
(What&#39;s the word?) burn?<br/>
<br/>
When&#39;s it my turn?<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t I love<br/>
Love to explore that shore above?<br/>
Out of the sea<br/>
Wish I could be<br/>
Part of that world<br/>
<br/>

BELLE from Beauty and the Beast<br/>
<br/>
Little town<br/>
                It&#39;s a quiet village<br/>
                Ev&#39;ry day<br/>
                Like the one before<br/>
                Little town<br/>
                Full of little people<br/>
                Waking up to say:<br/>
<br/>
[Townsfolk:]    Bonjour!<br/>
                Bonjour!<br/>
                Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!<br/>
<br/>
[Belle:]        There goes the baker with his tray, like always<br/>
                The same old bread and rolls to sell<br/>
                Ev&#39;ry morning just the same<br/>
                Since the morning that we came<br/>
                To this poor provincial town<br/>
[Baker:]        Good Morning, Belle!<br/>
[Belle:]        &#39;Morning, Monsieur.<br/>
[Baker:]        Where are you off to?<br/>
[Belle:]        The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story <br/>
                about a beanstalk and an ogre and a -<br/>
[Baker:]        That&#39;s nice. Marie! The baguettes! Hurry up! )<br/>
<br/>
[Townsfolk:]    Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question<br/>
                Dazed and distracted, can&#39;t you tell?<br/>
                Never part of any crowd<br/>
                &#39;Cause her head&#39;s up on some cloud<br/>
                No denying she&#39;s a funny girl that Belle<br/>
<br/>
[Man I:]        Bonjour <br/>
[Woman I:]      Good day<br/>
[Man I:]        How is your fam&#39;ly?<br/>
<br/>
[Woman II:]     Bonjour <br/>
[Man II:]       Good day<br/>
[Woman II:]     How is your wife?<br/>
<br/>
[Woman III:]    I need six eggs<br/>
[Man III:]      That&#39;s too expensive<br/>
<br/>
[Belle:]        There must be more than this provincial life<br/>
<br/>
[Bookseller:]   Ah, Belle.<br/>
[Belle:]        Good Morning. I&#39;ve come to return the book I borrowed.<br/>
[Bookseller:]   Finished already?<br/>
[Belle:]        Oh, I couldn&#39;t put it down. Have you got anything new?<br/>
[Bookseller:]   Ha Ha! Not since yesterday.<br/>
[Belle:]        That&#39;s all right. I&#39;ll borrow . . . . . this one!<br/>
[Bookseller:]   That one? But you&#39;ve read it twice!<br/>
[Belle:]        Well, it&#39;s my favorite! Far off places, daring swordfights, <br/>
                magic spells, a prince in disguise -<br/>
[Bookseller:]   If you like it all that much, it&#39;s yours!<br/>
[Belle:]        But sir!<br/>
[Bookseller:]   I insist.<br/>
[Belle:]        Well, thank you. Thank you very much!<br/>
<br/>
[Townsfolk:]    Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar<br/>
                I wonder if she&#39;s feeling well<br/>
                With a dreamy far-off look<br/>
                And her nose stuck in a book<br/>
                What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle<br/>
<br/>
[Belle:]        Oh, isn&#39;t this amazing?<br/>
                It&#39;s my fav&#39;rite part because you&#39;ll see<br/>
                Here&#39;s where she meets Prince Charming<br/>
                But she won&#39;t discover that it&#39;s him &#39;til chapter three<br/>
<br/>
[Woman:]        Now it&#39;s no wonder that her name means &quot;beauty&quot;<br/>
                Her looks have got no parallel<br/>
[Shopkeeper:]   But behind that fair facade<br/>
                I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s rather odd<br/>
                Very diff&#39;rent from the rest of us<br/>
[Townsfolk:]    She&#39;s nothing like the rest of us<br/>
                Yes, diff&#39;rent from the rest of us is Belle<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[<br/>
<br/>
[Townsfolk:]    Look there she goes a girl who&#39;s strange but special<br/>
                A most peculiar mad&#39;moiselle<br/>
                It&#39;s a pity and a sin<br/>
                She doesn&#39;t quite fit in<br/>
                &#39;Cause she really is a funny girl<br/>
                A beauty but a funny girl<br/>
                She really is a funny girl<br/>
                That Belle<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; My reactions to these songs <br/>
<br/>
are so different than before I became an unschooling advocate. Some of these <br/>
<br/>
songs provoke feelings in me of being trapped in a school without choice, and <br/>
<br/>
longing for freedom. Take a look at some of these lyrics, it&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
remarkable..... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today I was watching Amadeus, and thinking of Tom Hulce, who played Amadeus <br/>
and also voiced Disney&#39;s Hunchback, and thinking about the GREAT job he did <br/>
on &quot;Out There.&quot;  It&#39;s a sad, sad song and I&#39;m not crazy about that movie at <br/>
all, but Tom Hulce was great.  And that&#39;s another one of those <br/>
longing-to-be-free songs.<br/>
<br/>
The same guys who wrote Belle&#39;s song and The Little Mermaid&#39;s have a <br/>
wonderfully rich song in Little Shop of Horrors called Skid Row.<br/>
<br/>
But the new unschooling filter is the reason I make my initial movie-list <br/>
recommendation to new unschooling parents.  These movies will have a whole <br/>
new light on them once you decide to unschool:<br/>
<br/>
Mary Poppins<br/>
Heidi (I like the one with Shirley Temple)<br/>
Searching for Bobby Fischer<br/>
Ferris Beuhler&#39;s Day Off <br/>
The Sound of Music<br/>
<br/>
And they can all be pep-rallies for flagging unschoolers (Ferris Beuhler <br/>
least of them, but now that its star is so darned famous, it&#39;s certainly <br/>
worth another look for those who haven&#39;t seen it for a long time).<br/>
<br/>
I liked your Disney reminders.<br/>

My Fair Lady (Dd calls some guys &quot;Henry, Henry Higgins,&quot; now)<br/>
Resurrection (Ellen Burstyn, Sam Shepard - breaking the mold)<br/>
Stand By Me (boys coming of age)<br/>
Dirty Dancing (girl coming of age, a feel good thing)<br/>
Flashdance (more of same, nice body consciousness) <br/>
Little Big Man (talk about an education!)<br/>
Ghandi (see the world, broaden one&#39;s perspective)<br/>
The Big Chill (who&#39;s still doing what they planned to do?)<br/>
The Music Man (just &quot;think&quot; the music, dream the dream)<br/>
The Right Stuff (breaking the sound barrier, early space flight)<br/>
The Man Who Skied Down Everest (follow your passion)<br/>
<br/>
Just a few we have enjoyed again and again.<br/>

again with new eyes &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never forget back in 1986 or so when I was 14 and my mom got free <br/>
premiere passes from a radio station to see Ferris. It was the most bizarre <br/>
movie because it was done so differently, and quickly became one of my <br/>
favorite teen movies ( i grew up in the brat pack John Hughes days). Now <br/>
anytime it plays on one of the cable networks you just have to sit and watch <br/>
it, even though you&#39;ve seen it a thousand times....LOL<br/>
<br/>
Never seen Bobby Fischer, I don&#39;t watch a lot of current movies, but I will <br/>
see if I can reserve it from the library.....thanks for the list, we own most <br/>
of them and it will be fun watching them for the first time if you know what <br/>
i mean :0)<br/>

suddenly has become interested in Latin music and dancing, and I told her <br/>
about Dirty Dancing, another one of my teen movies. It is on hold for us at <br/>
the library....I was a little worried about some of the sex and abortion <br/>
subject matter, but I am relaxing about it...<br/>
<br/>
Another movie to throw out there....Space Camp(1986). It came out about the <br/>
time of the Challenger disaster, and after the Columbia disaster I went and <br/>
bought the dvd. Hadn&#39;t seen it in years...but I had learned a lot of space <br/>
program terminology from that movie and was trying to explain to Megan about <br/>
how they need to re-enter the atmosphere at a certain angle.....now Megan <br/>
goes around saying &quot;whip me, beat me, take away my charge card!&quot;    &lt;chuckle&gt;<br/>

I always liked the scene in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang where the Mary Poppins<br/>
lady (I think her name is Truly Scrumptious in this movie) brings the kids<br/>
back to Dick Van Dyke and complains that they ought to be in school.  His<br/>
reply is something like &quot;Well, that&#39;ll give the other kids time to catch<br/>
up!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also like the scene in Mary Poppins where the dad is trying to word an ad<br/>
for a nanny, and the kids bring him a fully-worded ad, which he promptly<br/>
tears up, but ends up being the one that ultimately gets Mary Poppins.<br/>

wanted to find an early Patrick Swayze movie for Marty and Holly to see.  I <br/>
forgot abortion-topic.   Holly has just lately had an abortion-topic moment.  <br/>
Her Cyndi Lauper DVD has a song about a girl dying of a back-alley  abortion, <br/>
called &quot;Sally&#39;s Pigeons.&quot;  Beautiful song, nice video, very sad.  We <br/>
discussed it quite a bit, the euphemisms for all the sex and pregnancy and <br/>
abortion.  Nothing&#39;s flatly stated, not for someone who&#39;s unfamiliar with the <br/>
lingo, and it&#39;s poetic.<br/>
<br/>
So for Holly, that might be interesting as a tie-in.  And for Marty, it&#39;s <br/>
time for him to start considering all the real factors and risks of teen sex. <br/>
 He&#39;s like his dad, who didn&#39;t date or fool around before he was 19/20/21, <br/>
but then again he doesn&#39;t have the same factors, and it could be sooner for <br/>
Marty.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-644368758">The songwriting duo that wrote the songs for Little Mermaid and Beauty and <br/>
the Beast were my favorites. I believe the lyricist died a few years ago  <br/>
:-( He could really turn a phrase and evoke a feeling. They were a great <br/>
team.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619530847">Yes, I saw it.  Liked the book better, actually.  The opening scene in the<br/>
movie reminded me of how my in-laws tried to teach my husband and brother<br/>
how to swim.  Didn&#39;t work - one is petrifed of water, the other is okay but<br/>
a certified non-swimmer.  Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I also like Out of Africa for it&#39;s theme of bucking the system, finding what<br/>
makes you whole, even if there is &quot;failure&quot; in it.  Not to mention the<br/>
incredible cinematography.<br/>

I get digest so forgive me of someone already posted this, but....<br/>
Strictly Ballroom&#39;s motto is &quot;A life lived in fear is a life half lived&quot; so <br/>
it&#39;s a great unschoolish type movie too!! Follow your heart is the recurring <br/>
theme.<br/>
AND, it&#39;s a Baz Luhrman movie. So you could watch Moulin Rouge as a follow <br/>
up, which has an entirely different feel but is about following your heart <br/>
too.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
