<br/>
Ok, that&#39;s what I get for not being more clear in my speech...damn<br/>
these deep-thinking unschoolers!! Sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
What I MEANT, was that you can&#39;t tell the difference between cheese<br/>
that has vegetable rennet or animal rennet in it. I DO think cheeses<br/>
taste far different from each other, but the veg factor does not play<br/>
into it.<br/>
<br/>
So....I will try your cheeses ( a wee bit) Danielle.:)<br/>
We&#39;ve got a book that has directions for making cheese, we&#39;ve toyed<br/>
with the idea for a while. Right now, my kids want to make an edible<br/>
model of Willie Wonka&#39;s chocolate river room. <br/>
<br/>
Ren, who never wants to offend a cheese connoisseur again....ack.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-171633628">Me, Conrad my partner and dd made butter from cream last night. We <br/>
just used a big jar to &#39;churn&#39; it in by shaking it up and down. We did <br/>
it while watching TV and took photos of the whole process. It only <br/>
took about 20 mins to churn.  Good fun and dd has really enjoyed <br/>
having her home made butter on her toast today. Haven&#39;t quite got the <br/>
hang of the patting bit properly yet though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Way back in my kidhood, the whole clan gathered at my aunt and <br/>
uncle&#39;s house for Thanksgiving. All gathered, there were a good <br/>
dozen or so kids 12 and under there. Many hours of waiting for the <br/>
turkey et al to be ready. So, my aunt had planned ahead and had a <br/>
bunch of small sealable containers a la Tupperware and some cream. <br/>
Each kid got a container of cream and instructions to shake it until <br/>
it went thump thump thump. Boy did that take up a lot of time and <br/>
energy! When it thumped we returned the containers and she combined <br/>
and drained off the excess liquid and that was the butter we used on <br/>
the Thanksgiving table. It was really cool, as a kid, to see it <br/>
sitting there and knowing you helped make it.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, DS was in a cooking co-op activity and one of the days <br/>
was making butter. To make it easier (the whipped cream-y stage can <br/>
be hard because the stuff doesn&#39;t move readily) they added a couple <br/>
of small, clean, marbles to each container to help keep it moving.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, now that you brought this up, I think I&#39;m going to have to plan <br/>
to make some in the near future...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-336690517">We decided to make butter a few years ago when the kids were small.  We did<br/>
it the easy way, putting the cream in the Kitchenaid mixer.  It seemed like<br/>
it was taking forever to turn to butter and I stepped outside to go feed the<br/>
chickens or something and before I knew it one of the kids was yelling out<br/>
the door to hurry and come in.  When it turned to butter (all of a sudden)<br/>
the butter milk went flying out of the bowl and covered everything in my<br/>
kitchen.  What a mess! I don&#39;t think the kids will ever forget that one. I<br/>
certainly won&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624429400">I remember when I was in school, the teacher put the cream in a jar and had<br/>
all of us shake the jar. Eventually a ball of butter formed. I wonder if<br/>
anybody has more recent experience with this. It might be a fun activity for<br/>
the kids to try.<br/>

disregard my question about making butter, under the &quot;Butter&quot; subject line.<br/>
