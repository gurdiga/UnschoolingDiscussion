<br>The same can be said of playing piano, or reading novels, or cooking.

<br>There was a low-income project in my neighborhood when I was a kid. &nbsp;Partly public funding, partly volunteer, and within months all the washers and dryers had been sold, several of the doors had been kicked in, and nobody wanted to live there soon, not even poor people. &nbsp;Even real action can be unsatisfying.

<br>
<br>It seems to be the nature of humans to feel unsatisfied, to want something more, better, different, and new.

<br>
<br>Well - it is always nice to have someone around willing to voice thoughts that might be worth considering even if they are unpopular among unschoolers. As long as you don&#39;t get upset when people disagree with you! I mean, I disagreed with you about these kinds of games not being satisfying for the reasons you gave, but it made me think about how this is one of those things where there is something inherent in them that makes people always want more and more. And that is worth thinking about. It isn&#39;t the same as playing a game of checkers or a game of backgammon or even a game of Pictionary. There are all these things to BUY and keep on buying to add to your set. So, ongoing money expenditure is involved and that makes it different and worth spending some time thinking about. And - there is an obsessive quality to them -- that is absent in other kinds of games. I think THAT is the crux of the anxiety that parents sometimes feel -- it makes us uncomfortable when our kids are obsessive about anything. Why?

<p><br>I recently figured out that that&#39;s the reason I am so &quot;in to&quot; fiction.&nbsp;
Because it provides a safe adventure.

<p><br>True for me!
<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just the arrival of winter weather, but I have
been experiencing couch potato angst.&nbsp; I realize I spend an awful
lot of time thinking, dreaming and in virtual interaction.&nbsp; On the
spectrum that runs from dreamer to doer, I&#39;m way over in &quot;dreamer&quot; and
almost never visit &quot;doer&quot; to do anything more strenuous than buy groceries.
<p>But, while pondering, I&#39;ve been thinking that I don&#39;t get much satisfaction
out of doing things.&nbsp; I feel like I really don&#39;t get pleasure from
accomplishment.&nbsp; (And it&#39;s more than just ephemeral things like housework
that don&#39;t stay &quot;done&quot;.)
<p>Does anyone have insight into where satisfaction at a job well done
comes from?&nbsp; Can it only be destroyed by being a perfectionist, or
are there other ways it might be undermined?

 </span></blockquote>Normally I&#39;m a lurker, but this really cracked me up.  Nine years ago, <br/>
when ds was a baby, dh and I went on vacation for a week, using a condo <br/>
that his dad had given us his timeshare for.  We were really poor and <br/>
couldn&#39;t afford to do anything, so we borrowed some board games from the <br/>
main office of the timeshare place.  We ended up getting totally <br/>
obsessed with Monopoly and played it all day and half the night for six <br/>
days in a row!  We stopped only to eat, sleep, and tend to ds (who was <br/>
young enough that he slept most of the time).  I  have never, before or <br/>
since, been so obsessed with a game.  We still laugh about it.  When my <br/>
kids get obesessed with something, I try to figure out (just for my own <br/>
curiosity) what need they are meeting at that particular time with their <br/>
obsession.  I still haven&#39;t figured out what need two 24-year-olds could <br/>
have met by doing nothing but playing Monopoly, but it was sure fun!<br/>
