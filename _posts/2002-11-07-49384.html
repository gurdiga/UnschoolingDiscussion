<br/>
Blow thy horn, hunter, and blow thy horn on high. <br/>
There is a doe in yonder wood, in faith she will not die.<br/>
       Now blow thy horn, hunter, now blow thy horn jolly hunter.<br/>
<br/>
Sore this deer stricken is, and yet she bleeds no whit,<br/>
She lay so fair, I could not miss. Lord I was glad of it...<br/>
<br/>
As I stood under a bank the deer shoff on the mede<br/>
I struck her so that down she sank, but yet she was not dead...<br/>
<br/>
There she goeth, see ye not how she goeth o&#39;er the plain, <br/>
And if ye lust to have a shot, I warrant her barrain...<br/>
<br/>
To the covert both they went, for I found where she lay. <br/>
An arrow in her haunch she hent for faint she might not bray...<br/>
<br/>
Here I leave and make an end now of this hunter&#39;s lore<br/>
I think his bow is well unbent, his bolt may flee no more...</div>

I forgot to thank you for typing this out, so thanks.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
going to be a *snappy* come-back to those horny jokes, though.  %^ (<br/>

You&#39;re very welcome, but the thanks was too great.  I cut and pasted and <br/>
re-formatted, though, so you&#39;re welcome!<br/>
