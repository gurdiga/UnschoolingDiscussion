<div id="ygrps-yiv-489051018">Hi People,<br/>
<br/>
To help me decide the amount of books I should print (I don&#39;t want to fill <br/>
the garage :-0) I am offering the preprinting offer of FREE postage for books <br/>
ordered by Oct. 15.  This is a reminder that time is running short.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t visited my website yet:<br/>

www.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>
<br/>
I invite you to check it out.  Our family has un/homeschooled our five <br/>
children since 1981.  My book talks about some of the experiences we&#39;ve had over the <br/>
years and I hope you enjoy reading it, as much as I&#39;ve enjoyed living it and <br/>
then writing about it.<br/>
<br/>
I asked some people from my local homeschooling list to read over sections of <br/>
the book.  Here is a bit of the feedback I received:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I devoured the 1st part of this section.  Oh how it spoke to me exactly <br/>
where I am at right now!!!  The questions about traditional schooling; Finding <br/>
support; creating new ways to learn at home … I think that these basic and common <br/>
issues will speak to all homeschoolers especially those that are just <br/>
beginning or are struggling (as we ALL do at times!).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
from Maria Claudia Schroeder - homeschooling mother of four<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to receiving your order, so my &quot;project&quot; succeeds!  I&#39;ve <br/>
been asked about autographs, just give me the word, and I&#39;ll sign your copy if <br/>
you like.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
Connie<br/>
