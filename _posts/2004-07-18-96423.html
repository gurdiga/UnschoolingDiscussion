<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677505695">Bad typo. Origins? I have NO idea!  Bad slang maybe?  Combo of idiots<br/>
following the group (bureaucracy)?  No, of course idiosyncrasy doesn&#39;t fit..<br/>
  Maybe I&#39;ve been doing too much CNN or FOX lately?  How about idiocrat as<br/>
one that follows the idiocracy? Maybe I&#39;m just terribly astray?<br/>

An eruv is an area of the mostly Orthodox Jewish community that is marked by<br/>
plastic or wire strips on poles. Within an eruv, observers may do physical<br/>
activities on the Sabbath such as pushing a wheelchair or stroller, that are<br/>
not typically allowed.  <br/>
<br/>
The Sabbath is a day of rest, where no physical activities are undertaken. <br/>
This includes turning on light switches, stoves, and using appliances,<br/>
vehicles, and items that make life &quot;easy&quot;.  In some communities, non-Jewish<br/>
teens are hired out to do these activities for observant families each<br/>
Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.  Other observant families just keep a pot<br/>
of stew or soup going on &quot;low&quot; for 24 hours, and leave a light on during the<br/>
sunset to sunset period.  <br/>
<br/>
Most people &quot;miss&quot; eruv markings because they blend in so well with poles,<br/>
wires and all the other wayward &quot;stuff&quot; like shoes.  But, for Jews, new to<br/>
an area, the markings can be viewed as friendly areas to settle into or<br/>
visit.  For the Orthodox Jew, the wires and plastic specifically designate<br/>
communities that support their faith based lifestyle.<br/>

For anyone interested, you can Google in almost every major city name and <br/>
the word eruv and get information on a map of the eruv boundaries.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777804709">That is really interesting.  The links I found on google say that there is one in my neighborhood (Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh) but doesn&#39;t say where it is.  Now I&#39;ll have to go around looking (or I could just ask a Jewish friend, but looking will be more fun.). <br/>
<br/>
I love the feeling of finding out something that not only did I not know existed but also I would never even have imagined on my own.  It makes the world feel bigger. <br/>

When I was little, in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, there were till hobo markings in <br/>
some places, and my mom knew what some meant.  She had an uncle who was a <br/>
railroad hobo during the Depression and died jumping out of a boxcar.  The family <br/>
said he was too good a jumper to have died, and must&#39;ve been killed and thrown <br/>
out, or pushed out.<br/>
<br/>
Before CB radios, truckdrivers had hand signals they would use to indicate <br/>
there was a speed trap ahead or an accident or  weather.   My dad knew them.  <br/>
That was cool.  Where we drove on the highways, they were pretty empty, between <br/>
northern New Mexico and West Texas, or up to Southern Colorado.  So although <br/>
truckers were only obligated to signal other truckers, some would signal other <br/>
cars as well, if they were only meeting a few especially.<br/>
<br/>
Symbolism is interesting, and people do it often without even realizing it.  <br/>
Someone mentioned roach clips (alligator clips with feathers attached).  It&#39;s <br/>
not likely someone would be busted for having one clipped on a vest, but they <br/>
would&#39;ve been offered a sit-and-toke, where someone wearing conservative <br/>
clothes and short hair would not have been.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when you go to someone&#39;s house you can tell just by standing on the <br/>
porch waiting for them to come to the door that they&#39;re Christian, or pagan, <br/>
or conservative, or old hipies, or they wear cowboy boots (an iron mud scraper <br/>
mounted by the door &lt;g&gt;). I always think that&#39;s fun.<br/>

Sometimes you don&#39;t even need the porch. We look for antenna farms on hams&#39;<br/>
roofs (Amateur Radio operators) wherever we drive. James can tell some of<br/>
repeaters the hams frequent by the direction particular kinds the antennas<br/>
are pointing, as well as the frequency bands they are using. There are some<br/>
repeaters that have more &quot;personality&quot; than others.<br/>
