 </span></blockquote>Yeah, people have good intentions when they listen to people like us<br/>
complain about the fatigue, pain, depression etc. But it takes someone<br/>
in the same situation to truly sympathize with us.Only they truly know<br/>
what this kind of fatigue feels and the mental disorientation is like;<br/>
and how you can just wake up depressed after having several months of<br/>
almost all happy productive weeks and it&#39;s all part and parcel of these<br/>
diseases not because you&#39;re whacko.<br/>
<br/>
What would we call such a group. <br/>
We would need a snazzy name ;-)<br/>
It would be nice to include hs&#39;ing parents with physical disabilities as<br/>
well (wheel chair bound, cancer patients etc). They suffer the same<br/>
plight as us.<br/>
