<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443325243">Hi Sheila,<br/>
<br/>
My 5 kids were adopted, 3 through the foster system.  We had a total of 14<br/>
foster kids so the behaviors you describe are very familiar to me.  I think<br/>
it is important to remember that often these kids are spending so much<br/>
energy protecting themselves from perceived threats (like &quot;I love you and<br/>
want you to be part of the family&quot;) that they don&#39;t have the energy left to<br/>
learn new behaviors.  I believe that stressing kids to &quot;improve&quot; before they<br/>
feel safe and have developed a bond is a recipe for disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Marsie came to us at 1 day of age.  Her bio mother is retarded and<br/>
psychotic.  Her bio father is &quot;slow&quot; and abusive.  2 siblings had lived in<br/>
our home previously, both were retarded with attachment problems and one was<br/>
psychotic.  At ages 2 and 3, these kids had to be placed in special<br/>
therapeutic residences because they were so destructive and out of control<br/>
(sleeping only a couple of hours per night, attacking other kids without any<br/>
known provocation, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
At 5 months of age, Marsie still couldn&#39;t turn over and just seemed somewhat<br/>
&quot;behind&quot;.  I took her to an &quot;occupational&quot; therapist who gave me the best<br/>
advice I&#39;ve ever been given.  She said &quot;Don&#39;t worry about dirt or germs with<br/>
this kid.  Let her do what she needs to do to learn.&quot;  So Marsie grew older<br/>
with ready access to anything she wanted, even the kitchen garbage (we just<br/>
washed her good when she was through), even fire ants (she can pick them up<br/>
and let them crawl all over her and never gets bit).  Marsie is now 6yo and<br/>
just smart as a whip.  She is learning to read off and on and has been<br/>
playing with multiplication stuff the last couple of days.  She does have a<br/>
temper but rarely completely loses it.<br/>
<br/>
She is so far past where her siblings were at her age.  I truly believe it<br/>
is because she felt safe and accepted.  So as a foster mom, adoptive mom,<br/>
unschooling mom and Master&#39;s level therapist, I would advise that you work<br/>
only on your relationship with your son.  Do nothing, absolutely nothing,<br/>
that will damage it.<br/>
