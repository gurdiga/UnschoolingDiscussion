Be alert with the grains.  Wyndham used to tolerate spelt and has now<br/>
developed a similar sensitivity to it.  He can still handle oats and<br/>
barley though.  But I watch pretty closely for signs of reactions these<br/>
days.<br/>
OTOH - Jenni at 14 is tolerating a whole lot more milk containing<br/>
products than she used to.<br/>

Are you buying organic?  My cousin&#39;s daughter developed all kinds of<br/>
allergies.  First they said get rid of the wheat.  Then the spelt started<br/>
bugging her. And so forth and so on.  Turned out that she was building up<br/>
toxins in her body from the pesticides and fertilizers used on grain crops.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out she IS allergic to wheat but that the others are because of<br/>
chemicals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120733992">When I was a child I was deathly allergic to onions<br/>
(and anything related to it - garlic, leeks, etc.). We<br/>
found this out when my mother had to rush me to the<br/>
hospital (at the age of 3) when I  had stopped<br/>
breathing! I have outgrown the allergy now. I had<br/>
onions accidentally at the age of 24 and got no<br/>
reaction. If I try to eat raw onions I still get a<br/>
burning feeling in my throat though, but with cooked<br/>
I&#39;m 100% ok. Tamzin is dairy intolerant. When she was<br/>
a baby (fully breastfeeding) she had very(!) bad colic<br/>
and spit up a HUGE amount. I stopped having dairy at a<br/>
friend&#39;s suggestion and her symptoms stopped almost<br/>
immediately! Not only that, I suffered from an<br/>
irritable bowel and that stopped too (what a relief!).<br/>
Both Tamzin and I can now have small amounts of dairy,<br/>
buy when she or I over indulge, boy can we tell! She<br/>
gets stomach cramps and a very stuffy nose/head and I<br/>
get my irritable bowel back. We just don&#39;t have much<br/>
dairy in the house though so I don&#39;t need to restrict<br/>
her diet at home and she&#39;s not so allergic that she<br/>
can&#39;t have dairy when at friends houses, etc. This<br/>
turned out to be a very long-winded way of saying that<br/>
we have both outgrown our sensitivities/allergies (to<br/>
a degree) as we got older and I know of other people<br/>
that have done the same.<br/>

them when I was little and we used to go away from where she was to eat them. <br/>
 But gradually she tried again, and the allergy was gone.<br/>
<br/>
Some people develop allergies later in life.  <br/>
<br/>
Things change.<br/>
<br/>
Holly doesn&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t like that,&quot; she&#39;ll say &quot;I don&#39;t like that yet,&quot; <br/>
with the happy assumption that as her tastebuds change she&#39;ll go through all <br/>
the foods possible.  Maybe she will and maybe she won&#39;t, but if she tries <br/>
something it won&#39;t be because anyone told her to clean her plate, or made her <br/>
taste it even.  And because she seems to be in touch with what she can <br/>
tolerate, wants, needs, she would reject something pretty quickly if it <br/>
didn&#39;t suit her one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
The boys on the other hand will eat anything and, seemingly, never get sick.  <br/>
They have that from their dad, who has eaten things I was throwing out for <br/>
being too old and I have never once seen him with a stomach cramp.<br/>

  You seem to be saying that food allergies aren&#39;t a *real* problem, <br/>
that if we would just let our kids eat anything, they would never <br/>
have a problem.  Would you be so easy going with your children&#39;s diet <br/>
if they could DIE from eating something with a peanut in it?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230681008">Our doctor believes Jenni may lose her milk allergy but Rachel and I are<br/>
stucj witht he corn one.  He also thinks Wyndham MAY &#39;outgrow&#39; the wheat<br/>
problem but he is doubtful that the chemical allergies will subside.  In<br/>
fact he is of the opinion they may progress and get worse.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, I think allergies change at certain specific times. <br/>
Toddlerhood, puberty and pregnancy all seem like hot times for change to<br/>
me.  So, if you have a 10 year old who has had the same allergies and<br/>
symptoms for 7 years or so, look for some changes soon!  I developed new<br/>
allergies and new symptoms just after each of my pregnancies.<br/>
