I&#39;ve nursed four babies and so far, yes, the &quot;empty sack&quot; thing goes <br/>
away...but so do my boobs!!<br/>
I am very, very flat normally. But when nursing I&#39;m about a size &quot;C&quot;.<br/>
I hate giving that up. YK?<br/>
It took about two years for that flabby skin thing to tighten back up.<br/>
Sheesh....it&#39;s all gonna be wrinkly, hanging skin forever this time!!!<br/>
oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I think that a totally uninvolved father, or abusive father may not be missed <br/>
much. It still affects kids.<br/>
But it sounded like this little boy was deeply affected by his father&#39;s <br/>
absences, so I was specifically addressing her situation.<br/>
I know for me, it would have been devastating to have my Mom and Dad divorced.<br/>
I think for most it&#39;s very traumatic.<br/>
