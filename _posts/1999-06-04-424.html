Home schooling&#39;s latest appeal: safety<br/>
Colorado shootings contribute to a surge of inquiries about teaching at<br/>
home.<br/>

Janice Quitmeyer heard the first news of the Columbine High School<br/>
shooting on her car radio, while driving with her three children. As she<br/>
listened in shock to the report, her 9-year-old son posed a question:<br/>
&quot;Doesn&#39;t this make you glad that you home- school us, Mommy?&quot; Indeed it<br/>
did. And in the weeks since the school massacre in Littleton, Colo., a<br/>
host of other parents apparently are nurturing similar sentiments toward<br/>
home schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Home-school organizations nationwide report that inquiries have<br/>
increased almost fourfold since Columbine. And as public faith in<br/>
America&#39;s schools continues to erode, the choice of a growing number of<br/>
parents is driven as much by safety concerns as by academic and ethical<br/>
standards.<br/>
<br/>
THAT&#39;S A LOT OF HOMEWORK: Eoin Gaj prepares a report for a book group he<br/>
attends at a local library. His mother, like an increasing number of<br/>
parents, teaches him at home in Cambridge, Mass.<br/>

&quot;The day after Columbine, our phones starting ringing off the hook,&quot;<br/>
says Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense<br/>
Association in Purcellville, Va. &quot;People called us saying, &#39;We really<br/>
need to begin home-schooling. We&#39;ve been thinking about this for a long<br/>
time, and this is the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back.&#39; &quot; In recent<br/>
years, safety issues have been more on the minds of parents who opt for<br/>
home schooling. But it was the horror of the April 20 fatal shootings at<br/>
Columbine - in the heart of suburban America - that brought focus to the<br/>
issue for many who before were uncertain about educating their children<br/>
at home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The main reasons for home schooling that have always existed are still<br/>
there. But the safety issue is becoming very prevalent,&quot; says Brian Ray,<br/>
president of the National Home Education Research Institute in Salem,<br/>
Ore. &quot;It makes home schooling look more attractive than it ever did.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Trend may peak<br/>
<br/>
An estimated 1.5 million children in the United States are home<br/>
educated. Since 1985, the number of home-schooled students increased<br/>
between 15 percent and 20 percent each year.<br/>
<br/>
Yet in the aftermath of the latest wave of school violence, the<br/>
percentage who switch to home schooling this year may peak.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A young person coming into a school shooting a gun sets people off<br/>
completely. And it&#39;s not just a few kids anymore,&quot; Dr. Ray says. &quot;I<br/>
think people recognize that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Somehow, school shootings seemed pretty remote to most people before,&quot;<br/>
agrees Mr. Farris. &quot;After Columbine, it wasn&#39;t remote to anyone anymore.<br/>
The whole idea that &#39;this can&#39;t happen in my community&#39; is pretty much<br/>
shattered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While interest in home schooling is on the upswing nationwide, the most<br/>
dramatic increase is, not surprisingly, in Colorado. In the days since<br/>
the Columbine shooting, calls to the state Department of Education about<br/>
home schooling have more than doubled.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents readily volunteer that recent school violence prompted<br/>
their call, says Suzie Parker, a program assistant there. &quot;I&#39;ve had<br/>
people call from around the state - not just in the Denver area - saying<br/>
that they don&#39;t feel their children are safe in the schools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At Christian Home Educators of Colorado, the state&#39;s largest advocacy<br/>
organization for home schooling, inquiry calls have more than quadrupled<br/>
since Columbine, reports Ms. Quitmeyer, the group&#39;s public-relations<br/>
coordinator.<br/>
<br/>
But Quitmeyer - who home-schools her three children - cautions against<br/>
home schooling if parents&#39; motivation is purely for safety, she says.<br/>
&quot;Home schooling is a way of life. It&#39;s a huge commitment. Your reasons<br/>
for home schooling have to go further than [safety].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Other motives<br/>
<br/>
Safety concerns take various forms - and aren&#39;t restricted to gun-toting<br/>
students, says Dorothy Karman, a Portland, Ore. mother, who<br/>
home-educated her son and daughter for 15 years (both are now enrolled<br/>
in college).<br/>
<br/>
Long before school shootings hit the public consciousness, parents were<br/>
motivated by a desire to limit unwanted peer influences like drugs,<br/>
alcohol, and premarital sex. &quot;Parents choose home schooling to have more<br/>
influence over their child&#39;s life,&quot; she says. &quot;We spent a lot of time<br/>
together as a family. And we still do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But accompanying these reasons has been a recognition &quot;that public<br/>
schools are pretty dangerous,&quot; says Farris of the Home School Legal<br/>
Defense Association.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the benefits to home-schooled children, some identify a<br/>
significant downside to the trend.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If a large percentage of families begin to home-school, the result<br/>
would be the loss of a terribly important piece of the community: the<br/>
public school,&quot; says Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission<br/>
of the States, in Denver.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Schools are the community glue, and when people don&#39;t feel they have a<br/>
stake in the community, then things deteriorate badly,&quot; Mr. Newman adds.<br/>
&quot;This society desperately needs more of a sense of community, not less.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically, Farris doesn&#39;t disagree. &quot;Some parents do regret this,&quot;<br/>
he says. &quot;But they believe that the price for their own children is too<br/>
high.&quot; Still, he doesn&#39;t believe the ideal America is one in which<br/>
children are educated at home - or in private schools. &quot;I want public<br/>
schools to improve to the point where parents can feel safe sending<br/>
their kids there. I don&#39;t want people to have to choose home schooling<br/>
out of fear. They should choose it on its own merits.&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t believe this was said. A lot of people have mentioned over the<br/>
lists how so many family and friends come from traditional ps system and<br/>
don&#39;t understand hsing. But a comment like this seems so unreal to me. In<br/>
the days before mass ps, there was community a lot more community.<br/>
Community was found in the neighborhoods not in a classroom, even when ps<br/>
became mandatory. ONe of the greatest sources of information my children<br/>
have is the stories from my grandparents who tell them of their adventures<br/>
from life. Many of them involve the cost of food at the first mcdonald&#39;s or<br/>
experiences in the war. But they have also learned a great deal about what<br/>
our area was like &quot;back then&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
ONe great story that has to deal with how the community took care of itself<br/>
is this. My grandfather had a friend (they were teens) who after seeing a<br/>
set of wine glasses that were brought over from Germany as a family set,<br/>
stole these glasses and gave them to his mother (family also from germany)<br/>
as a gift. Upon confronting the friend, the friend admitted the truth.  He<br/>
begged my grandfather not to tell his mother. After thinking about it, my<br/>
grandfather agreed not to on the condition that he (my grandfather) could<br/>
take one item from this boys house to replace the wine glasses. The boy<br/>
agreed. My grandfather walked in and took a painting of the Ruins of the<br/>
Rhine (painted on the back side of the glass with inlaid mother of<br/>
pearls...). The boy couldn&#39;t believe that this was happening,but he&#39;d made<br/>
a deal.  The ending of the story is that for the rest of their lives this<br/>
boys parents left the wall empty and would remark from time to time how<br/>
they missed the picture that had been there, the boy never (to anyone&#39;s<br/>
knowledge) stole anything out of his guilt we are told.  My grandfather has<br/>
now passed this picture on to me to remember the story, and because I&#39;ve<br/>
grown up admiring it and spending hours on end studying it as a child.<br/>
<br/>
Here in this story, we have lessons being learned and two families remained<br/>
friends even supporting each other over the years. What would happen today.<br/>
the boy who stole the glasses would have been reported to the police who<br/>
would have slapped his wrists or possibly given him time in Juvinile hall<br/>
if this wasn&#39;t his first theft. Or maybe everyone would have learned at<br/>
school what he had done and they would have picked on him until he broke or<br/>
decided to be exactly what they all thought he was, a no good theif who<br/>
couldn&#39;t ever be trusted. If he was made to return the glasses or pay<br/>
restitution would he have ever learned the lesson he learned?  <br/>
<br/>
No IMO the only community that we have is right in the area we live,<br/>
schools with their zero tolerance, gangs, or whatever is not community. it<br/>
is an unnatural environment. to hear people talk about schools as if they<br/>
hold a significant position in the society seems like a stretch, schools by<br/>
their design are to educate the masses and get them ready for factory work,<br/>
not hold the community together. <br/>
