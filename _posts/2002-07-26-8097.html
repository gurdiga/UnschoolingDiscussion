Me too! I can also--with a finger from each hand--whistle loudly enough <br/>
to (unintentionally) hurt your ear and alert someone across an <br/>
auditorium.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t rrrrrrrrroll my Spanish r&#39;s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573844537"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Meghan (who can also curl her tongue)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had always thought that this was something that was an inborn trait, along <br/>
the lines of attached earlobes vs. hangy earlobes, or rolling your rrrrrr&#39;s. <br/>
Casey and I could always curl our tongues, Conor could not.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, the other day Conor came in and said &quot;Look! I can curl my tongue now.&quot; <br/>
He had been practicing and sure enough, it was curled. He&#39;s been walking <br/>
around with his tongue sticking out, all curled up, for a week now. Hmmmm, I <br/>
wonder if this will help with his articulation.....&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
