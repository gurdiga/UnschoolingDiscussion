<div id="ygrps-yiv-177032575">My daughter is trying to learn French, and is dying to find a way to go to France for as little money as is possible. She discovered that there is an organization called Volunteers for Peace that has opportunities for teens and adults. She has come to realize that without being totally submerged into the language she doubts that she could possibly really learn. It makes sense to me. Also this past weekend we met a woman from France who told us about an organization called Alliance Francaise where people get together to speak in French, she tells us there are groups all over the country. Perhaps there are other groups for other languages. Just a few thoughts we have been coming up with.<br/>

Some years ago, my brother did a pretty inexpensive &quot;summer immersion&quot; <br/>
program in Japanese in the dorms at UC Santa Cruz.  (It&#39;s cheaper, but <br/>
you don&#39;t get to travel, and you may get a much poorer accent.)<br/>

My mom used to go hear some of their speakers, and maybe attend some of <br/>
their other social functions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774449853">If you get a spanish-language channel like Univision, watch the real<br/>
telenovelas ~ they&#39;re highly entertaining and easy to follow (obvious soap<br/>
opera story lines).  The commercials are funny and if you&#39;re up for a<br/>
challenge, find an Oprah-like show &lt;bg&gt;  It helps to hear the language,<br/>
somehow it just sinks in better.  Check out Jose-Luis Orozco for children&#39;s<br/>
folk music, like a latin Raffi :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; than 30 years ago.  And I recently watched through the episodes of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Destinos, a fake telenovela designed to teach Spanish that is shown on<br/>
&gt; &gt; some PBS stations.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Were these fun?  Seem helpful?  I read quite a bit, and enjoy it, so it<br/>
&gt; was what I started with first but hearing a language spoken seems pretty<br/>
&gt; important too...<br/>

Me: I&#39;m just talking about the idea<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; of &quot;translating&quot; the words of Shakespeare into modern words.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Joyce: But I don&#39;t see why you&#39;d fear a translation would replace<br/>
Shakespeare&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; original works. I do see a side by side translation making Shakespeare more<br/>
&gt; accessible and, therefore, intriguing to many people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me: I didn&#39;t say that. I&#39;m not afraid of that. I just made a comment about<br/>
how the beauty of Shakespeare is in the language itself. It&#39;s an aesthetic<br/>
judgement on my part that anyone is free to disagree with. Also, from the<br/>
point of view as the wife of a playwright, it&#39;s just plain wrong at some<br/>
point to mess with a play&#39;s actual words.<br/>
<br/>
To me, the language is still close enough to ours that it&#39;s worth exploring.<br/>
To others, I guess it&#39;s more like translating Aristophanes from the original<br/>
Greek. I wouldn&#39;t put any energy into stopping you from doing that &lt;gg&gt;. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t tell anyone not to watch Disney&#39;s Pocohantas, but I also probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t recommend it as the best way to learn about the subject.<br/>

Marty has been watching some of their version of Family Feud.  It goes slowly <br/>
enough that he can puzzle out some of the answers, and that&#39;s fun.<br/>
