<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164159499">I like your definition!  <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I don&#39;t do labels very well, but we are very attached <br/>
parents.  However, many would deny that we are attached parents <br/>
because we don&#39;t meet 100% of the definition everytime of those that <br/>
attachment parent.<br/>
<br/>
Labels are a big problem.  One of the big pluses of homeschooling and <br/>
unschooling is that you can step outside the stereotypical <br/>
definitions and labels, not be so completed glued to a concept or <br/>
definition that you fail to see the good in other ways of doing <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Compassion ... and also awareness as you say ... is a very big part <br/>
of this openminded approach and its something we should all remind <br/>
ourselves of regularly ... not just compassion for our children or <br/>
our family, but compassion and understanding for others, those who <br/>
may or may not operate differently than ourselves in their homelives <br/>
or educational methods.<br/>

up on google and came up with some books and a website, if anyone&#39;s<br/>

&gt;book called Everyday Blessings that discusses this type of parenting.<br/>
&gt;When I first heard of unschooling, I realized that it was a practice<br/>
&gt;of mindful parenting - accepting your child for who s/he is in the moment<br/>
&gt;and supporting them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mindful is a term Buddhists use and awareness is certainly a part of it.<br/>
&gt;It is much deeper than that though!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I only have an itty, bitty, baby understanding of Buddhism, but I imagine<br/>
it would fit well with Unschooling.  The idea of not being too attached to<br/>
the outcome of the situation seems like it would help quell the desire to<br/>
buy curriculum packages.<br/>

I think I first learned it (but not by that name, and that&#39;s the perfect <br/>

Berrends?).<br/>
