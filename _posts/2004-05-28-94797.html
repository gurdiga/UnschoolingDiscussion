<div id="ygrps-yiv-571950388">Thats kind of what I thought.  I told my son (who found the article) that both bills were introduced in Jan 2003 and that nothing has happened with them since then, so its probably nothing to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that bothers me is that they were introduced at all.  But I guess we&#39;ll just have to keep an eye on it.<br/>
