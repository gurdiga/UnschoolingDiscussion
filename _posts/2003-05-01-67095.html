<div id="ygrps-yiv-742152873">My daughter, Nicholette, will be seven in two weeks.  She is my schoolish <br/>
child. &lt;bg&gt;  She begs to do school work daily, hourly!  So we do school work <br/>
a lot.  Workbooks, textbooks, she loves them all!  Her problem, as she <br/>
stated to me, is, &quot;I like doing this workbook but it gets boring so fast.  <br/>
Do we have anything else I can do to learn how to read all by myself that&#39;s <br/>
fun?  Like a game or something?&quot;  She is really focused on learning to read. <br/>
  She wants to buy the newest Harry Potter book so she can read it all by <br/>
herself.  (She can read the first set of Bob books with a generous amount of <br/>
help.)<br/>
<br/>
Since her birthday is coming up, I thought I&#39;d toss some suggestions out to <br/>
my family, but I&#39;m at a loss!  We just purchased a new computer, so this one <br/>
will go to the girls room once it gets here.  Any ideas of FUN cd-roms we <br/>
might try?  Maybe a game or electronic toy perhaps?  She really likes to be <br/>
able to work independantly but that is difficult with workbooks, since <br/>
obviously she can&#39;t read the directions.<br/>
<br/>
She asked for a clip-on lamp for her bed so she can stay up late at night <br/>
and &#39;do school work&#39; when she can&#39;t sleep.  That&#39;s in the bag, but what to <br/>
go with it??<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of getting her the Think Pad, with a few books to go with it. <br/>
  We had one years ago when they first came out and they didn&#39;t have much to <br/>
offer as far as books went.  Now I see they have phonics, math, science, <br/>
everything!  Do any of your children have one of these?  Any <br/>
recommendations?<br/>
<br/>
Talk about an unschooler!  This kid wants to do it ALL on her own!  But Mom <br/>
is stumped!  Help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456181442">Our youngest, Aidan, learned to read because of his LOVE of computer games.  NOT Reader rabbit, tho we have it.  The first word he learned was &quot;OK&quot; and the second was &quot;Cancel.&quot;  He&#39;d ask his older bro Kieran  (3.5 years older) to read for him but Kier soon tired of that.  Six months later Aidan&#39;s reading to Gramma on the couch and she is totally impressed.  I smiled, but so much out of pride, but because now she&#39;d be off our case about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My advice:  Do nothing.  They **will** find a strategy to get information.  It might be that they read.  Or something else.  Coping and learning go hand in hand.<br/>

<h4>The Clifton&#39;s</h4>
<p><small><time> 3 May 2003, at  4:44am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999536804">One of the best books I have found on reading is called &quot;Reading Reflex&quot; by Carmen and Geoffrey McGuinness. It is a different approach to reading. There are pages to cut out for sound bingo and word building puzzles. Some parts of it may be a little &quot;schooly&quot; but you can just do it your own way. One of the things that they say is not to say the name of the letter in conjunction with the sound of the letter because it gets so confusing. Just don&#39;t say the name of the letter at all. Point to the letter or ask &quot;What sound does that symbol make?&quot; Example: the letter &quot;y&quot;. When you say the name of the letter, it actually starts with a &quot;w&quot;(why) yet it makes a very different sound.<br/>
<br/>
My son has some processing issues, so this approach is better for him if he wants to do it, that is. I think it would be great for any child though. To take some of the confusion out of it.<br/>

**My son dictated a story to me that I wrote down as fast as I could<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve done this also.  Its been a treasure to have.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago, Abbi, my dd,  6 at the time,  wanted to make a book.<br/>
She told me the story.   Then she illustrated the story.   The cool thing<br/>
was that she made the story about her little sister (Kyra) who was 4 at the<br/>
time and her little friend.   Also includes me and the little boy&#39;s mom.<br/>
Them growing up, an evil witch and Kyra saving the day.    There are many<br/>
nights that Kyra has me read it to her,  the title: Kyra and Daniel Go On<br/>
Adventure.<br/>
<br/>
You should see the glow on Abbi&#39;s face when I read it to Kyra.   Its<br/>
wonderful!<br/>
