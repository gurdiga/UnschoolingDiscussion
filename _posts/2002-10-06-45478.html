&lt;&lt; So anyone who would like to reassure me as we head on down this path, I <br/>
would love to<br/>
 hear!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, my Jared sounds a lot like your Jason!  Very picky, loves all things <br/>
sweet....must have been all that breastfeeding. lol<br/>
What I&#39;ve noticed as I quit bugging him about food, is his willingness to try <br/>
almost anything at least once.<br/>
I never, ever ask him to, but I will tell him I think he&#39;d enjoy the taste <br/>
(of stuff I really believe he&#39;d like) and then we go on eating and don&#39;t say <br/>
a thing. He usually acts like he doesn&#39;t want anything to do with it, then <br/>
says &quot;ok, I&#39;m going to try one bite&quot; and then tastes it and decides.<br/>
Often he discovers he like it and eats some more. <br/>
I made it very clear initially that if he ever tried anything he didn&#39;t like, <br/>
he could spit it out. That helped him see an option (where there hadn&#39;t been <br/>
one before) to try things and reject them.<br/>
I don&#39;t fill our house with sweets. But I do buy things he requests.<br/>
He is the MOST fun child to grocery shop with. He touches things and asks <br/>
questions and wants to know which countries all the produce is from. He wants <br/>
to try new fruits, or strange looking things. Asks how they&#39;re used, and why <br/>
people eat them.<br/>
Very fun.<br/>
He still eats a lot of sweets and &quot;junk&quot;. But he also eats more period. This <br/>
guy is SO incredibly skinny that I worry. So anything he eats makes me happy.<br/>
There is still some binging type activity, even after over a year of no food <br/>
restrictions. But it really isn&#39;t a big deal. I love seeing his willingness <br/>
to try new things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is going to be the way that I handle it as well...I was explaining<br/>
to dh that not having restrictions does not mean that all I am going to <br/>
feed him is junk food LOL! He has never had a twinkie, and I do not <br/>
plan on buying one for him, but if he discovers them and wants them, I <br/>
will get them. Makes sense to me!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow. It does sound like Jason! This is exactly what I needed to hear.<br/>
I sometimes wonder how he lives on what he lives on. But I was just <br/>
as picky when I was little though. I joke with my mom that her curse<br/>
she must have put on me to have a kid as picky as me came true!<br/>
Jason does love to hear about how I would not eat anything when I was <br/>
little. So we talk about how as he gets older, he will start liking <br/>
new foods just like mommy did. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the encouragement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292506164">Forgot to mention...Kyle would have been either a Jared or a Justin if <br/>
I had my way, but dh did not like the idea of having a family of all <br/>
J names (dh is Jeff, oldest is Jason). Ah well...<br/>

Sounds like my husband&#39;s family - Jennifer, Julie, Judy, Janet, Janie,<br/>
John and Jeff (my husband, the baby of the family).  It gets a little<br/>
confusing for me sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that is true. I have a friend whose boys are Nick and Neil. I always<br/>
forget which is which! (she is an online friend whom I have only met once...<br/>
might be easier if I knew the boys better!)<br/>
