<div id="ygrps-yiv-679526025">I have a friend who lived in Adelaide for two or three years with <br/>
young children.  She doesn&#39;t homeschool though (and doesn&#39;t think it <br/>
is a prarticularly good idea). I don&#39;t know what kind of info you are <br/>
looking for but if you think she could help I can forward your e-mail <br/>
address to her.<br/>
