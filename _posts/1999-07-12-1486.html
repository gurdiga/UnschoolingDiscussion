&gt;Date: Mon, Jul 12, 1999, 9:42 AM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I just joined this loop after hsing for a couple of years... my girls are 5, <br/>
&gt;7 and 1...  I have a question for anyone open to answer it...  In our <br/>
&gt;homeschooling support group one of our contributions to the group is to plan <br/>
&gt;an activity/field trip per semester.  I really want to plan one on the <br/>
&gt;Holocaust for a variety of reason... I&#39;m sensing indifference from my 7 year <br/>
&gt;old, at just the beginning of my research... this infuriates me... I&#39;m being <br/>
&gt;unrealisitic  (kick me.. I know!  :-) But this is important to me and I <br/>
&gt;believe she needs to know about this. Perhaps with further research it may <br/>
&gt;pique (sp?  right word even?) her interest...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thoughts...?  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. :) IMHO, you (generic, not you personally) can do a lot of damage to a<br/>
child insisting that she know about something/learn about something<br/>
(anything, even cheerful things) when she&#39;s not ready and interested.<br/>
<br/>
By all means, delve into the holocaust yourself if you feel a need for it,<br/>
but recognize that it&#39;s *your* need and your project. If your daughter does<br/>
come to show interest now or in future, you can share what you&#39;ve learned.<br/>
And you can certainly share your knowledge with any of the homeschooling<br/>
group who&#39;d like to learn it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s extremely unlikely that she&#39;ll die of old age without learning about<br/>
the Holocaust. You&#39;re not trying to keep it from her. If she does get to be<br/>
older and hasn&#39;t a clue about it, you could ask her as a favor to you to sit<br/>
down and talk it over, that it&#39;s knowledge that *you* feel is extremely<br/>
important and that you&#39;d like to share it with her.<br/>
<br/>
She does not necessarily need to know about it today, tomorrow, next month,<br/>
or by the time she&#39;s 11.75 years old. If she gains her knowledge at 11.85<br/>
years old, nothing terrible will come of it.<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiousity, do you feel this way about other things (she *must*<br/>
learn to add and subtract this week or this month, she *must* learn some<br/>
chemistry by next year, etc.) or is this just this particular subject? If it<br/>
is *just* the Holocaust, it would be interesting (to me) to delve further<br/>
into my own mind and into *why* I thought it was so important that my 7 year<br/>
old learn this right at this very time.<br/>

Yes - slavery springs to mind.  But age appropriate (and child appropriate) <br/>
discussion.  I won&#39;t let them watch certain movies yet because of the <br/>
violence (or the news for that matter, some nights).  The same high level of <br/>
supervision has to apply to the content of their academic and world studies.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure, there are lots of things I think are important for children to know,<br/>
either now or in the future. I think it&#39;s important for my children to know<br/>
how to cook and clean for themselves, how to train a dog, how to swim, the<br/>
history of humanity, how to understand the scientific method and conduct<br/>
useful experiments, to know the history of the Holocaust, the history of<br/>
minority oppression (including that of women, which they will become) and<br/>
why Penelope Pitstop doesn&#39;t annoy me when she stands around shrieking<br/>
&quot;Hay-ulp!&quot; even though you&#39;d think it would go against my idealogy of<br/>
women&#39;s strength.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t think that these &quot;things to know&quot; need to be on a certain<br/>
timetable. They will come up as they are wanted and needed. If they don&#39;t<br/>
come up I will bring them up myself and give my children the option of<br/>
taking hold of them, but I will not force learning. If my children truly do<br/>
not ever want to learn to train a dog I will worry over that, I will wish it<br/>
could be different, I will hope that someday, before I die, they will come<br/>
to me and say, &quot;I learned to train a dog&quot;. But if they don&#39;t, ultimately it<br/>
is their life and I have done my job in being available and interested and<br/>
offering them the world. The rest is up to them, and I would consider it<br/>
extremely intrusive (and a waste of time on both our parts) for me to insist<br/>
that they learn something right now just because I think they should, not<br/>
for any real, immediate and obvious need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687795493">Well, I&#39;m going to go against the  popular opinion.  I don&#39;t think age matters at<br/>
all.  If you follow an interest, the child will tell you how much, how in depth<br/>
ect... to go with a subject.  My six yr old just had an interest in slavery.  We<br/>
read some, talked some, and the subject faded.  No, we didn&#39;t go into a lot of<br/>
depth, but he got what he needed.<br/>
As far as the Holocaust, I think if you daughter is not interested, you probably<br/>
in for a fight.  (Ask me how I know  :)    You might be happier to follow<br/>
something she wants to do for a field trip, and the keep in mind the monument for<br/>
when she shows and interest.<br/>
But, no one knows you daughter but you and she.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978727192">Hi...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Yes, there certainly are and the Holocaust is one of them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list, but just wanted to pipe in here.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are other ways to introduce my children to issues without <br/>
necessarily dive right in.  Especially when I try to take their cues.<br/>
<br/>
For example, my older children (12,10,8 and 6) are at this moment watching <br/>
Sound of Music expressly for the reason that they want to see the end where <br/>
Captain Von Trapp is being forced by Hitler&#39;s regime to surrender to them.  <br/>
<br/>
This came from an informal discussion of WWII that started with my husband&#39;s <br/>
interest in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; which he saw while he was out of town a few <br/>
weeks ago and staying in a boring hotel room by himself.<br/>
<br/>
From there, we went to some children&#39; encyclopedias we have with an extensive <br/>
coverage of the war and we talked about the atomic bomb and we discussed <br/>
casulaties and consequences and how the American Japanese were treated.<br/>
<br/>
At other times, we have discussed concentration camps. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any of my kid&#39;s has the whole picture, yet.  But, it&#39;s so fun <br/>
to watch them putting it together in their own heads in different ways.  They <br/>
listen to my input and my dh&#39;s.  They talk to grandparents and read <br/>
historical fiction and watch movies and make their own impressions on their <br/>
own time.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I heard Elie Wiesel when I was in college and it was one of the most <br/>
moving and poignant experiences of my life.  No one dared breath while he <br/>
told about the horror of the Holocaust.  It became real to me then.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know that if anyone at anytime before that had &quot;tried to get me to <br/>
understand,&quot;  that I would have.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is to trust your child&#39;s lead, and by all means <br/>
expose them to things, but if they are telling you they are not ready, they <br/>
aren&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a good point and a good illustration. Schools teach in great big old<br/>
indigestable glomps of factoids and texts and tests. Real people in real<br/>
situations rarely learn like that.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter has been &quot;learning to read&quot; for two and a half years now<br/>
(and she&#39;s not near done yet), since she was two and started asking what<br/>
letter was what. I learned to cook from the time I was 8 and I&#39;m *still*<br/>
&quot;learning to cook&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Learning about the Holocaust really can be (and in learning&#39;s best sense<br/>
often *is*) about picking up a reference here at age 6 in the Sound of Music<br/>
and asking about it and getting a simple and honest answer without &quot;too much<br/>
information&quot; for the age and interest, and then another bit of knowledge<br/>
there at age 8 from something else, and then maybe a whole huge<br/>
but-this-time-digestible-because-of-interest glomp of Anne Frank at age 13<br/>
will lead on to more. Learning in spirals works. It&#39;s a bitch to chart, but<br/>
it works.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still learning about the Holocaust, too, and about dog training and<br/>
marriage and physics and grammar and lawnmowing. It&#39;s just schools that<br/>
think that glomps are the only and best way, and you&#39;d better eat all your<br/>
glomps because it&#39;s good for you and you&#39;ll grow up to have a big, strong,<br/>
factoid-filled brain. ;)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I am off on a huge tangent here and don&#39;t want the original poster to<br/>
think I&#39;m accusing her of glomping or conspiring-to-glomp her daughter.<br/>
Sometimes I just steal the idea-ball and run. &lt;g&gt; Forgive me.<br/>

concerned about exposing children to an overwhelming tragedy without giving <br/>

think children should be exposed to it at such a tender age.  I understand<br/>
the need not to shelter my children unrealistically from the world but I&#39;ve<br/>
also wanted to preserve the joyful innocence of childhood as long as<br/>
possible so that it could grow strong and remain with them in at least some<br/>
form throughout their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, I really wonder how much about the Holocaust a 7 yo can possibly<br/>
comprehend. That a great many people were killed because they were<br/>
Jewish...or Gypsy...or homosexual...or Communist...or in the wrong place at<br/>
the wrong time?  That their killing was cold-blooded and systematic?  That<br/>
human beings are capable of immense evil?  That genocide has, despite<br/>
everything, happened again in our own lifetimes and probably will again in<br/>
hers?  These are &quot;issues&quot; best encountered by more mature minds, IMO.<br/>
