<div id="ygrps-yiv-905783026">I have been having fun  reading this whole exchange.  We have an eclectic collection of music cds.  Sometime none of us want to listen to what either one of us want to listen to.  At their last<br/>
birthday, the twins found a solution to our dilemma.  They bought each other  walkman-cd players.  Then, I got one too... Last Friday, after a full day of activities, everyone sat in the living room<br/>
reading and listening to a cd of their choice on their own player.<br/>
You could say, we were all wired... in peace.  We love music, possibly only as much as books.<br/>
I have been eliminating gadgets and useless junks these days, but I realized the cd players have become quite useful.<br/>
