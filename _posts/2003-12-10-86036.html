My husband Jon dropped out of high school in 11th grade. He knew <br/>
nothing of unschooling back in those days (WAAAAAY back in the 70&#39;s) <br/>
but he was definitely an unschooler at heart. He has always pursued <br/>
information with a passion and reads, investigates, discusses and <br/>
explores many, many topics that interest him.<br/>
<br/>
Several times along the way he&#39;s gotten the &quot;you need to go to <br/>
school&quot; lecture. (NOT from employers or potential employers, mind <br/>
you, more from well meaning relations.) So he&#39;s attempted and dropped <br/>
out of community college, university, and trade school at various <br/>
points in the past 20 or so years. Each time he went, he felt school <br/>
was in no way better or more informative than him doing the research <br/>
on his own. And he was easily able to get, keep and move up in the <br/>
jobs he pursued. His preference is to live his life and learn as he <br/>
goes. <br/>
<br/>
Jon has worked in publishing and computers for the past 20 years. He <br/>
supports our family of 4 and never stops learning new things. This <br/>
past summer we all decided it was time to get out of the corporate <br/>
world. We bought a coffee shop and have been happily (and <br/>
successfully) running it ever since. Some people still asked if Jon <br/>
was going to go to school to learn how to run a business. &lt;sigh&gt; He&#39;s <br/>
done so much research, and knows so much about marketing, payroll, <br/>
employee relations, cooking, design, purchasing, etc. And he&#39;s still <br/>
learning. It never stops. That&#39;s being an unschooler. And for Jon, <br/>
and our family, it&#39;s living a life we have chosen and love.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
