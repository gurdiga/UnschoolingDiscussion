&lt;&lt; Forgetting about the cleaning up part.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s exactly what I do.<br/>
I like the laid back way kids hang out at our house, cleaning is NOT the <br/>
priority.<br/>
It was the two days of chaos that ensued that sent me over the edge.<br/>
I love watching these happy kids interacting with each other and the mess <br/>
just reminds me that there are happy kids enjoying life. I don&#39;t nag, believe <br/>
me.<br/>
But they were so exhausted that the whole house just went to heck for two <br/>
more days and I finally snapped.<br/>
I did dialogue calmly and sweetly  but they were so tired it just wasn&#39;t <br/>
important enough.<br/>
So I didn&#39;t talk so nicely after that!! And that&#39;s when I felt badly and <br/>
realized I could have been a lot more persuasive prior to losing it......let <br/>
them know exactly how stressed I was getting.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
