It&#39;s definitely been interesting though and maybe I will try again at <br/>

better for me.<br/>

  I stay subscribed to the group but choose the &quot;no email&quot; option.  I <br/>
just go to the website and read and post whenever I get a chance.  <br/>
That way, when I get busy and don&#39;t get a chance to read posts, I <br/>
just don&#39;t.  <br/>
