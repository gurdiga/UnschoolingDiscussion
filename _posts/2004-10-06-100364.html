When I  was a girl in school if you had a cold you were supposed to stay home<br/>
to  recover and not spread the thing. I was in schools in several countries<br/>
and  that is one thing they had in common. Mum (or my grandmother) just<br/>
phoned  the office to tell them I would be absent.<br/>

Can&#39;t do that now.  The school won&#39;t believe you.  In Memphis, if  you miss <br/>
more than 5 days in a semester, you can be up on truancy charges.   That means <br/>
if your child is feeling poorly for a day, but is not sick enough to  go to <br/>
the doctor, you can only do that 5 times.  The next time you better  run her <br/>
into the doctor, even if you don&#39;t have a co-pay or health insurance, or  they <br/>
could prosecute you.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s pretty ridiculous.  Have to keep that average daily attendance  up, you <br/>
know?  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t feel like getting and up and going early at least once or twice a  <br/>
week.  I&#39;m so glad we don&#39;t have to.<br/>
