<div id="ygrps-yiv-894338725">Lee, you poor thing! That is awful.<br/>
<br/>
I once expected the same to happen to me-I think I was saved by a nurse, and <br/>
now it is just one of those funny family stories.<br/>
<br/>
When my ds, Ricky, was about 5 he got a black eye from jumping on my bed and <br/>
hitting his face on the arm of a chair next to the bed. It happened right <br/>
before Christmas, and at every party or family get together everyone who saw <br/>
him asked how he got the shiner.<br/>
<br/>
On the Friday night beginning New Years weekend, he and one of the others <br/>
came down with strep. I knew we wouldn&#39;t get a doctor in the office for <br/>
days, so we packed off to the E.R. On the way there, Ricky asked me what <br/>
they would do. I told him they&#39;d probably ask about his eye-he said, &quot;I am <br/>
so tired of telling that story&quot; I laughed and said well, you&#39;ll have to tell <br/>
it one more time.<br/>
<br/>
He took it literally-he told the story to the triage nurse, and we all <br/>
laughed over how he had had to confess his jumping on the bed so many times <br/>
over the holidays. When we saw the doctor, he of course asked about the <br/>
black eye right off. Ricky hung his head, looked at me out of the corner of <br/>
his eye, and said shyly &quot;You tell him, Mom.&quot; That doctor looked at me like I <br/>
was a monster!<br/>
<br/>
I fully expected a knock on my door the next morning,heck, by the look and <br/>
sound of that kid, I&#39;d have probably turned us in, too! I&#39;m sure that I was <br/>
saved by the triage nurse telling him how different the scene was with <br/>
her-blessings on that lady.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175532359">Thanks Cathie for the acknowledgement. For a moment there I thought I was<br/>
listening to the crickets sing in a crowded theatre. :-) Just call me Daffy<br/>
Duck!<br/>
<br/>
In some ways I think your situation was scarier than mine.  The police<br/>
officer was pretty understanding after he saw I was with a couple teachers.<br/>
He still had to make that report, though, and he told me so. It&#39;s a little<br/>
different when a lay person reports v.s. a professional, like a teacher or<br/>
doctor.  CPS takes those calls much more seriously-they may be required to<br/>
investigate them by law.  I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, facing down a doctor must have been pretty intimidating.  If you<br/>
ask me-doctors are scary people anyway.  I&#39;ve only had one good doctor in my<br/>
entire life, and I had to move away. (Sorry-baggage!  I&#39;ve been dealing with<br/>
a lot of baggage lately-but I promise not to open the suitcase! ;-)<br/>

her-blessings on that lady.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I am really glad that the RN was so helpful! What a scary night you must<br/>
have spent.  I bet you tossed and turned a bit in your sleep! Your son was<br/>
obviously reacting to the authority of the white coat-there are always so<br/>
many actions and reactions in interpersonal situations that I think to chart<br/>
a simple &quot;hello&quot; between two people is not simple at all. And this is<br/>
precisely why I think it&#39;s wise to exercise great caution and careful<br/>
judgement before calling CPS or the police on anybody.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, my experience still makes me angry, even though it happened 3<br/>
years ago. I hope to someday reach the status of laughing it off as you<br/>
have, but I get nervous when I think about it too much (which I&#39;m going to<br/>
stop doing right now! ;-0). Oh, but I&#39;ll keep trying to let it go and smile.<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
Take care<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236084450">We have a couple of those &quot;war&quot; stories but the best one is when #2 son was<br/>
having a pillow fight with eldest son.  The rocking chair and pillow won<br/>
and #2 son ended up with a large gash in his eyebrow.  Off to the ER we<br/>
went.  Now, to really understand what happened, you need to know that this<br/>
child was literally born a talking small adult.  His language skills<br/>
totally flabergasted us from the get go.  We get to the ER and of course we<br/>
get the looks because hubby was filling out the forms and son is not his. <br/>
That is when eyebrows started raising.  The nurse asked son what had<br/>
happened and he told her.  Raised eyebrows we weren&#39;t suppose to see.  Then<br/>
the doc asked.  Then they made the mistake of deciding to do the keep<br/>
questioning and we&#39;ll get the answer we want routine.  WRONG!  Son says,<br/>
very patiently, &quot;Please finish my eye.&quot;  Doc kinda looked shocked and<br/>
finished the stitching job.  When he was done, he decided to start the quiz<br/>
again.  Son asked, very politely, &quot;Could you please help me down.&quot;  The<br/>
nurse lifts him off the gurney.  Doc starts to ask again.  Son puts his<br/>
hands on his hips and says, &quot;I told you and I don&#39;t lie.&quot;  Then he turned<br/>
to me and said with that accusing voice, &quot;Mummy, you said you had to be<br/>
smart to be a doctor.&quot;  He grabbed hubby&#39;s hand, &quot;I wanna go home, the<br/>
people here aren&#39;t nice like Mummy said.&quot;  As we were leaving, we overheard<br/>
the doctor say to the nurse, &quot;Next time get your facts straight!&quot;<br/>
