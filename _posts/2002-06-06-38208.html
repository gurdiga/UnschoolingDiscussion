&gt; &lt;&lt; Grandpa did offer to pay for our room when we told him we could not <br/>
&gt; afford one. Am I being a real pain in the butt?  Maybe I take offense <br/>
&gt; too easily in regards to our children. Or maybe my reasoning is <br/>
&gt; skewed because I know so much family history that&#39;s taken place over <br/>
&gt; the many years.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let them pay for the room. <br/>
&gt; Let them send kids away.  Use it as a lesson to the kids about how some <br/>
&gt; people feel about kids, so they&#39;ll appreciate how you are with them!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Being where people aren&#39;t as liberal and child-focussed might be a real <br/>
&gt; eye-opener for them that will last them the rest of their lives. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly is appalled when she sees people treating kids like totally inferior <br/>
&gt; beings.  It will color the kind of parent and adult she will be!<br/>

would talk to Grandpa about changing his mind and having the kids stay for <br/>
dinner. Explain that you believe the children deserve the same treatment as <br/>
the rest of the family, that you don&#39;t differentiate between adults and <br/>
children. Maybe invite Grandpa over for a meal at your home so he can see <br/>
your kids calmly sitting down to dinner and participating in polite <br/>
conversation. But if he remains firm about no kids at his special dinner then <br/>
make sure the room service for the kids is included in the room. I say this <br/>
because I firmly believe that if they can&#39;t enjoy a catered meal (Is enjoy <br/>
the right word? Catered hotel meals aren&#39;t always the best! &lt;beg&gt;) with the <br/>
rest of the family, then they should at least get the *same* food. Good luck! <br/>
