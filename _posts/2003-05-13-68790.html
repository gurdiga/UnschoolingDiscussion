We have seen both, although not for a long time. We&#39;ll have to get them again. Jaiden is almost 5. We have In Gods Hands and we just say Laird, it was amazing. Have you seen them? <br/>

Where do you live? Jaiden really wants to start surfing this summer, Jason and I don&#39;t surf, don&#39;t know how. Our friend is willing to teach him, but he wants Jaiden to be a really good swimmer before he gets on a board. (Makes sense to me, but Jaiden is a little upset about it.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In Gods Hands&quot; is a surfing movie(a real movie not a documentary) about big water surfing in Hawaii. It&#39;s good, they had real big water surfers surfing real big water. It was amazing, getting pulled in by jet skis just so you could drop in on a wave, and the waves! I didn&#39;t know they could get so big.<br/>
<br/>
And Larid (I think I spelled that right) is a doc about Laird and his surfing experiences. They show him surfing Tava Ruah(sp?) beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gonna show my ignorance...whats a Bic?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bic is yes the pen company but they make an indestructible surf boards. They <br/>
are made of something very close to the pen material and they dont break!<br/>
<br/>
That movie sounds cool. <br/>
<br/>
The swimming part I dont think is that big of a deal, when they start they <br/>
are in knee deep water, the wet suits float a bit and there is usually <br/>
someone with them when they begin.<br/>
<br/>
We are in Maine by the NH line.<br/>
Are you close? Dustin suggested earlier when he was reading my response that <br/>
we should have an Unschoolers meet at the beach and he would show anyone who <br/>
wanted to surf how to begin. Its not hard to begin its just trusting yourself <br/>
and getting a little wet. Well, cold too the water here never warms up <br/>
enough.<br/>

It would be great if we could, but it&#39;s kinda far on the bus &lt;g&gt;. I don&#39;t know if anyone in our local group surfs or not, I havent seen it mentioned, but I&#39;ll have to ask.<br/>
