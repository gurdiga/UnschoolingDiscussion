<div id="ygrps-yiv-78675787">I tried to attach some pics of my new puppy but it didn&#39;t work, so I&#39;ve gone to yahoo.com and created a photo album if anybody wishes to view it.  Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom/lst">http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom/lst</a> and click on the Carothers album<br/>
