<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001098959">Okay, here are all the caveats:<br/>
1.  I&#39;m fairly new to unschooling<br/>
2.  I haven&#39;t read all (or even most) of the literature about unschooling<br/>
3.  This may have already been discussed, so I&#39;m sorry if this is old news and to <br/>
everyone else it is HO HUM.<br/>
4.  I had this thought at 4 a.m., so it might be kind of funky.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I were discussing this morning the case of someone we know who has <br/>
worked at one place for 20 years and has left for another job because the <br/>
handwriting was on the wall and he pretty much had to leave.  <br/>
<br/>
As the mother of five children, I immediately worried about my own children&#39;s future.  <br/>
The part of me that was traditionally schooled thought, &quot;Oh my goodness, I&#39;d better <br/>
start really doing traditional school so that our kids can get GOOD jobs and not lose <br/>
them.&quot;  Then, I remembered all the really good, smart, top-notch people who have <br/>
done just that and STILL lost jobs, even though it wasn&#39;t their fault.<br/>
<br/>
The next thought that hit me was that, as parents, we want our children to thrive as <br/>
adults, and perhaps, stepping back and looking at this from a species perspective, <br/>
unschooling does this better than other forms of schooling: it produces adults who <br/>
are adaptable and able to move around life and employment with flexibility.  In other <br/>
words, as a species, perhaps unschooling gives us the greatest odds for survival.<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about this, the more I think this is probably old news to you, but it <br/>
was an &quot;a ha!&quot; moment for me.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, our family is coming to the Peabody conference.  We&#39;re going on the <br/>
whale watch.  We coming via upstate NY, so that we can visit Rev. War sites (our 10 <br/>
year old loves the Rev. War.)  I love how much I learn because of the kids&#39; interests!<br/>

<br/>
But it&#39;s a really important &quot;a ha&quot; moment! And it was cool to read <br/>
about, thanks for sharing.<br/>
Once a person has that particular paradigm shift, I think <br/>
unschooling ought to be fairly simple and natural. I really believe <br/>
most people get stuck in the fear of the childs future, and stuck <br/>
thinking school is the guarantee of success. Once you can see that <br/>
isn&#39;t the case at all, and that unschooling BETTER prepares you for <br/>
success, the rest is really easy to get.<br/>
<br/>
Great shift. I totally agree.<br/>

I agree with your conclusion that unschooling is better preparation for <br/>
this than schooling.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband was in school, it was fairly terrible, but he learned if <br/>
he hated his teacher, or vice-versa, he HAD to tough it out.  Come June, <br/>
the school problem would disappear.  This does NOT reliably work when <br/>
you are in a bad work situation.  One can endure and endure a bad work <br/>
situation and the crummy boss may never leave. <br/>
<br/>
I think forced schooling taught my spouse to feel powerless and made him <br/>
less effective when he needed to make career changes.  Most schooling <br/>
raises followers, not leaders and adventurers and take-charge types.<br/>

<br/>
School likes to think they&#39;re identifying leaders early on.  Those with the <br/>
best grades, the captains of sports teams, presidents of this or that school <br/>
club, class, student body.<br/>
<br/>
They like to think they&#39;ve already given future leaders some real leadership <br/>
experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973351972">Daniel Pink, author of &quot;Free Agent Nation&quot;, was the keynote speaker at<br/>
the Maryland Home Educators Association conference I recently attended.<br/>
He made that exact point:  Unschoolers are preparing our children to<br/>
ideally suit the currently evolving free agent economy.  <br/>
<br/>
He was an excellent speaker, highly recommended.  The book is on my &quot;to<br/>
be read&quot; pile in part so I can get inspiration about turning our careers<br/>
into free agent ones; with three layoffs and three voluntary job changes<br/>
for my husband in the last 10 years in the biotech industry, we&#39;re<br/>
looking for more security for our future.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this than schooling.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=====================<br/>
<br/>
Someone else already pointed in the direction of Daniel Pink&#39;s _Free Agent<br/>
Nation_, but I wanted to say how excited I was to hear him actually make<br/>
this distinction in a talk he gave recently at a Maryland Homeschool<br/>
Conference. I was all prepared to ask him if he weren&#39;t really talking about<br/>
*unschooling* and not homeschooling at all when he made that very clear all<br/>
by himself in the middle of his talk. Of course, I had to start clapping at<br/>
that moment--rabble-rouser that I am. *g*<br/>
<br/>
So even he has come to the conclusion that what&#39;s really preparing kids for<br/>
the future is letting them live and learn on their own terms. Just wish he&#39;d<br/>
made that distinction in the book itself. Though, of course, his kids are in<br/>
*good* schools, but they will [paraphrased quote here] &quot;probably be<br/>
homeschooled in the future to get the best of both worlds.&quot; My friend asked<br/>
him about it.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Beth--it was great to meet you there!<br/>
