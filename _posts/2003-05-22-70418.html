<div id="ygrps-yiv-154808633">Is it appropriate for religious chain letters to be sent on the unschooling list. I for one resent this. I am aware I can just delete this but I thought this list was unschooling. I do not want that sent to me!!!  Did anyone else receive the one sent by Vanessa with the implication that if we don&#39;t respond it is the work of Satan???? YUCK<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I didn&#39;t respond to it.  So far, Satan hasn&#39;t been by here yet.  I&#39;ll <br/>
keep you folks posted, if he does come by to chastise me for not responding to <br/>
the chain letter, I&#39;ll let you guys know. ( If I can find my way back from <br/>
Hell).. <br/>
<br/>
HA HA <br/>

house.  Maybe if I send the chain letter on right now, I can avoid his wrath.. <br/>
Opps, I already deleted it.    I&#39;ll just deal with the Devil when he gets here.. <br/>

inappropriate things is for someone to preread every single email before it<br/>
goes through to the list. I can prevent people from *repeatedly* sending<br/>
inappropriate things, but they have to send the first one for me to know who<br/>
to watch.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something that happens very often.<br/>
