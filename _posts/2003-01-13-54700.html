<div id="ygrps-yiv-260755672">Within the context of unschooling, which encompasses granting children equal <br/>
rights with adults,  non coercive parenting, and allowing children the <br/>
&quot;freedom to chose&quot;, abortion is a reasonable issue open for discussion.   <br/>
But, the abortion issue can never be &quot;settled&quot;, nor a standard &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
stance in abortion offered.  The reason being, aside from the arguement of <br/>
when life actually starts, which will vary from conception to full term live <br/>
birth, is that abortion affects the rights of more than one &quot;person&quot; .  <br/>
Whether folks believe that person comes into existance at conception or at <br/>
some magical moment during pregnancy, there are two (or three, including the <br/>
father) peoples rights to consider.   The conflict will always be which of <br/>
those peoples rights are more important.   Some will feel that ultimately, <br/>
the rights and choices belong to the person who is carrying the baby, the <br/>
woman whose body will be provide the vehicle for gestation and delivery of <br/>
the baby.  Some will feel that the rights belong to the unborn child, the one <br/>
who had no choice at all in the matter of being conceived.  Some will argue <br/>
that the father has rights as well, that the baby belongs to him as much as <br/>
the mother.   These arguements can go round and round and never be resolved.  <br/>
  We can all offer our opinions, our convictions, our beliefs on this issue, <br/>
and ultimately, the conflict will still exist.   Discussion or debate will <br/>
never  solve the issue, but it can offer insight into how others view <br/>
abortion and open up an exchange of ideas and opinions.   I don&#39;t see why <br/>
there needs to be restriction placed on the discussion of abortion, as long <br/>
as everyone understands that there will never be any united agreement on the <br/>
issue.<br/>
