who know what they want and are willing to struggle to get it.  (I know it <br/>
doesn&#39;t always FEEL so lucky...BG)<br/>
<br/>
By all means, have her read to the baby!  Ask her what the baby&#39;s reaction <br/>
was.  I&#39;ll bet the baby will love it, and the reader will get practice.  I <br/>
also like the idea of having her read to you.  You could be folding clothes, <br/>
fixing dinner, taking a bubble bath, or cuddling with dd as appropriate.  <br/>
<br/>
I just had a thought...(surprise!)...would it help any if she read into a <br/>
tape recorder?  If I remember right, she was frustrated because she wasn&#39;t <br/>
reading as well as she thought she should be...?  Taping her reading might be <br/>
a fun way to encourage practice while also encouraging her to meet her needs <br/>
independently.  If you try this, be sure and save the first tape to listen to <br/>
somewhere down the road.  Just in case she needs to hear proof that she is <br/>
making progress.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688942751">Our kidlet that had the most trouble reading &quot;got it&quot; when we bought him<br/>
his own casette recorder and he made his own books on tape.  He read the<br/>
books into the tape recorder and then would draw his own little book to go<br/>
along.  He created a whole library of these &quot;books.&quot;  As he got better and<br/>
more confident, he would go back and redo the taped part.  Eventually he<br/>
could do a real good job and when he reached the teens he volunteered to do<br/>
reading for the blind for their taped books! <br/>

Gotta agree, better not force it when they are mobile, though.  LOL<br/>
