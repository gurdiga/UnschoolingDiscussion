I couldn&#39;t find my directory issue of GWS just yet, but here are some <br/>
websites to get ya started.<br/>
This one is a Georgia coast unschooling group.<br/>
Now I know nothing about these groups, if they truly unschool or not. But at <br/>
least you could start here and see where it leads!<br/>

<br/>
This next link is to a group that looks very inclusive...all religious <br/>
beliefs and so on. Not unschool support, but at least they&#39;ll know the laws <br/>
well and probably be able to help you.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sunschoolers@...">sunschoolers@...</a>  This is an email addy for the S.U.N. group. They <br/>
are the main group that the first link I gave you is under. Stands for <br/>
Southern Unschooler Network.<br/>
This one is a group that has a lot of information at their website. Sounds <br/>
fairly inclusive and eclectic, this was listed at unschooling.com.<br/>

I found the 2002 directory, but there is only one name from GA.  There are other groups tho&#39;, Maria if you want them e-mail me and I&#39;ll send them to you.  GWS is great.  I have found so many resources in even the old journals.  I didn&#39;t find out about GWS until after it had shut down but even the old ones are great.  You can order back issues from funbooks, or just do a search of John Holt and you&#39;ll come up with bunches of info.<br/>
