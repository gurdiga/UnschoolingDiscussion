<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942978299">Another friend pointed out that she just thought it was the author&#39;s style,<br/>
so I&#39;m thinking that I was more predisposed to dislike this book than I<br/>
thought. :)<br/>

&gt; Hmmm... it didn&#39;t seem to me that there were that many words defined, I<br/>
&gt; would have said fewer than ten in each book. I thought it was a humorous<br/>
&gt; device, the narrator actually interupts his own story fairly frequently<br/>
&gt; to add information or forecast doom or whatever. I see it as a stylistic<br/>
&gt; thing... some of the definitions are kind of fun, too. I generally don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like dumbed-down stufff, but this did&#39;t bug me for some reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re not books you can take seriously in any way, for sure.<br/>
