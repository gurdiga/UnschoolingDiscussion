<div id="ygrps-yiv-392333405">Holly has a fascination with religion, yet she doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s true.  <br/>
Still, she keeps coming back to religious questions.  <br/>
<br/>
This morning (fifteen minutes ago) she was lying on the floor of my office <br/>
looking up at shelves.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s &#39;The Old Schoolhouse&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A magazine about homeschooling by fundamentalist Christians.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s &#39;fundamentlist&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They believe the Bible is literally true and that everything they need to <br/>
know is in there and they live just by the Bible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Does the Bible say anything about keeping your kids home from school, or <br/>
about sending them to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, but it says things they interpret to be about school, so they quote that <br/>
about homeschooling.  Other people find verses to use to tell kids they need <br/>
to go to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Will you read me the whole Bible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sure.  Now?  I think I have one right in here.&quot;  I did.  I asked if I should <br/>
start with the best parts or just start at the beginning.   <br/>
<br/>
She ignored that, and said &quot;Are you going to trick me and read Lord of the <br/>
Rings?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t you think you would know the difference?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I started out with Genesis 1:1, and by 1:2, she said, &quot;That&#39;s how Lord of <br/>
the Rings starts!  And there were dwarves and elves...&quot;   I said, &quot;Well, the <br/>
*movie* does&quot; and she laughed because she doesn&#39;t watch the movies <br/>
either--the&#39;s very LotR resistent.<br/>
<br/>
But she did have a literary point, if she was thinking of the Galadriel <br/>
voiceover at the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I read on.   She said &quot;What&#39;s &#39;hethem&#39;?&quot; and she said it to sound quite a <br/>
bit like &quot;heathen,&quot; and I explained that it was &quot;. . .created he them,&quot; and <br/>
did some rearrangement of words so she could get the grammar.  I continued.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So God spoke English?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;ight?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I knew I&#39;d never get past the first page.  She was already frustrated that <br/>
God has been misquoted.  The King James-worshiping fundamentalists would not <br/>
have understood her objections.<br/>
<br/>
After &quot;moveth&quot; and &quot;creepeth,&quot; Holly said, &quot;HEY, that&#39;s like that game!&quot; And <br/>
by that, she meant the Strongbad parody of Zarg, which sayseth everythingeth <br/>
in very-bad parody of 17th centuryest Englisheth <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail94.html,">http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail94.html,</a> &quot;Thy Dungeonman&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
In one repetitive place she said, &quot;Hey, this is like poetry, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
rhyme.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe it did in Hebrew.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well poetry that doesn&#39;t rhyme is the worst kind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And once she said &quot;You wrote this!&quot;  and she pointed to the front of the <br/>
Bible, which sure enough had my name in gold, right on the front, so I told her, <br/>
&quot;Yeah, I guess I did.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I got to &quot;dominion&quot; over things she asked what that meant.  I said it <br/>
meant we owned them, that we were kings over animals and could tell them what to <br/>
do (thinking &quot;yeah, like things that creepeth are going to listen&quot;).   <br/>
<br/>
Holly says, &quot;And yet we&#39;re not king of the forest!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So at the end of the sixth day, that was the end of the first chapter and I <br/>
said so.  She said, &quot;That was a short chapter.  Wait, I thought it was divided <br/>
into books.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah, Genesis is a book, and it has fifty chapters.  When you want to tell <br/>
someone something particular, you tell them which book, chapter and verse,&quot; and <br/>
I showed her.<br/>
<br/>
That was enough Bible for her for today.  <br/>
<br/>
She might or might not come back for more, but she made more intelligent <br/>
comments and asked more questions that actually meant something than some people <br/>
would be willing to ask in a year of Sunday School.  And she made connections <br/>
with Lord of the Rings, homeschooling, language, journalistic integrity, <br/>
Strongbad, poetry and the Wizard of Oz.<br/>
<br/>
So it goes.<br/>
