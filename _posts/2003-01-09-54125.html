<br/>
How would you like to come and see Europe?  I&#39;d be happy to put you up for<br/>
as long as you&#39;d like, rent-free, provided you get my house in shape and<br/>
clean and cook while you&#39;re here!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about references, nobody attests to liking to clean except the<br/>
truly dedicated.  Just let me know when your plane lands in Frankfurt, ok?<br/>
<br/>
GREATLY looking forward to your arrival,<br/>

LOL!!! Brenda, that almost sounds too good to be true!! A brand new house to <br/>
clean and get in order. Let alone new people to cook for!!! I&#39;d just be too <br/>
afraid of what I&#39;d find when I got back. Unfortuntely the rest of my family <br/>
doesn&#39;t share in my enthusiasm to keep a neat house!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Why should I make them take on MY priority?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cause u may burn out and go nuts........<br/>
<br/>
Years back.. I had to be on bed rest with one of my kids......<br/>
My 9 year old at the time (he&#39;s 18 now) had to learn to cook since hubby <br/>
traveled alot. I kept things simple for him.<br/>
Then my oldest daughter started fixing simple meals. <br/>
<br/>
Things have still remained that way....... They will kick me out of the <br/>
kitchen. The 4 older ones do most of the cooking. I fix hubby his grits cause <br/>
no one in the house can fix them like I do adn occassionally breakfast for <br/>
the 1, 3 and 6 yr olds if my 14 & 17 yr old are not up yet.<br/>
<br/>
Wait...let me clear something up first...<br/>
<br/>
My kiddies....<br/>
18 (ds, who will be 19 march 5th) He does his own laundry and  hubby & mine <br/>
too when it is full. He fixes most of his own meals since he is a night owl <br/>
and doing his thing...<br/>
17 yr old (dd).......who does the main laundry detail and well as her own and <br/>
cooks dinner everynight with the 11(dd) & 14(dd) yr olds assistance. Of <br/>
course the  11 & 14 yrs better have their lanudry downstairs own schedule are <br/>
it will not be washed including the 3(dd) & 6 (dd)yr olds. The 1yr(dd) olds <br/>
stuff is usually in my laundry, but it can make and apperance in all of <br/>
them....<br/>
They are responsible for keeping their rooms clean and well as their chores <br/>
which are on a 2 week rotation which includes , dishes, mopping, vaccuming, <br/>
basement, sweeping, etc....<br/>
They get money for extra jobs......Like if my hubby is too busy to do the <br/>
ironing for me and him (he loves to iron...go figure) he will pay our 11 yr <br/>
old per basket or load.<br/>
My son gets paid for being our handy man (minor plumbing or electric work, <br/>
etc).......he got paid for putting up the lights for kwanzaa, tilling my big <br/>
garden and planting the veggies and mowing it. In fact any planting and yard <br/>
work that has to be done, he is in charge of it and we pay him.<br/>
<br/>
As for me........currently nursing a 18 month old which I am weaning <br/>
alittle...just down to  2-3 nursings aday because I am <br/>
expecting......computer work, inventory, shopping and errands when hubby is <br/>
out of town,unschooling stuff and getting their worksheets or what have <br/>
you,running a homeschool support group, and doing ALL of the sewing in the <br/>
house. Which means I hardly ever buy clothes. and never buy  diapers ( all <br/>
baby items are made, including nursing pads and nursing clothing). All our <br/>
clothes and coats I make unless I can get some things on clearance and it is <br/>
no higher than $3. <br/>
My 11 year old is learning how to sew...so soon she will probably be doing <br/>
her own stuff.<br/>
I&#39;ll put it this way....I make everything except socks and shoes. I make my <br/>
own curtains and other home dec stuff.<br/>
There is no way that I can do all the things that I do and do all the other <br/>
stuff too and I will not try.<br/>
Occasionally I will treat myself to a  venti vanilla latte at starbucks (it&#39;s <br/>
decaf now since I&#39;m preggie).<br/>
<br/>
Just in case you all got confused with the kid count...<br/>
<br/>
18 (young man)<br/>
17 , 14, 11, 6, 3 (will be 4 next month) and 18 month old are all girls....<br/>
Newbie do in August and we will not know until birth since we are <br/>
doing/planning another unassisted birth.<br/>
