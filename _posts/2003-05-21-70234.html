<div id="ygrps-yiv-680587755">I have been reading here for a little while now, and amstarting to feel like <br/>
I get the learning from life, deschooled thing. Every once in awhile I get a <br/>
schooly thought, and try to banish it from my being!<br/>
My son(7) has never been to school, I used to try to get him to do work books <br/>
on math , it was met with much resentment and refusal. I tried many things to <br/>
force him to do them, I shamed, I jollied, I threatened. It was something I <br/>
would pull out sporadically, when I felt anxious about the lack of schooly <br/>
things being done. I thought that unschooling was more about having workbooks <br/>
around, and he would pick them up and do them on his own.LOLOL<br/>
I have stopped that annoying habit, and have been living life with my son <br/>
after reading Sandra&#39;s site and unschooling.com stuff. He is a cool kid, and <br/>
has always loved numbers and math concepts. A few weeks ago, he asked what a <br/>
quarter was worth. I said 25 cents, he said that if a quarter was 25 cents, <br/>
then the quarter box of rice crispies that was left must 25percent of the <br/>
box. YIKES!!!<br/>
Just the other day, we are driving to dear Maureen&#39;s house, and Tommy is <br/>
asking about having his hair colored , and asks how much. I said around 50 <br/>
bucks.Ds then proceeds to tell me that he will save up his allowance for <br/>
that. <br/>
&quot;If I save my allowance, it will need to be 10 allowances to make 50 <br/>
dollars(5dollars every 2 weeks) so that would be 20 weeks. There&#39;s 52 weeks <br/>
in a year, so that would almost 1/2 a year.&quot;<br/>
Ok, now I am really impressed with this. The child just gets stuff!! How <br/>
wonderful!!<br/>
No coercing, shaming forcing to &quot;Do&quot; math . He just gets it.<br/>
Yahoo, it works!!<br/>
We will continue to live life, and learn in this house!!<br/>
Nancy, exultant in BC<br/>
