 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope everything works out for your friend. My dh really wants to read Sears&#39; ADD book. He&#39;s a children&#39;s counselor and would love more insight into these kids.<br>

Yes, diet was one of the things we talked about so I know she would like<br>
more information in that area. &nbsp;Also, she&#39;s only been homeschooling for a<br>
year or so, so she&#39;s still learning her way and would like more info about<br>
how to eliminate the head-to-head battles she has over &quot;school&quot; some days.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the lead, I love Dr. Sears too and didn&#39;t realize he had written<br>
one regarding ADD.<br>

&gt;I have a feeling<br/>
&gt;he&#39;ll talk quite a bit about ADD&#39;s connection with food. Has &gt;your friend<br/>
&gt;explored that possibility at all?<br/>
