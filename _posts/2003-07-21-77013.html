I have done some searching on this, but can&#39;t figure out what algae is. Can you tell me how this helped your granddaughter?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There was a lot more improvement when they started giving her algae, so it<br/>
seems there were some nutritional deficiencies. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Skye had some of the most ferocious tantrums I&#39;ve ever seen, from the time<br/>
she was about two.  They didn&#39;t let up, in fact got worse.  Heather tried<br/>
everything she could think of or was suggested.  Some things, like<br/>
eliminating foods she was sensitive to, helped.  Nothing made a major<br/>
difference until they tried the algae.  (It&#39;s a special kind of algae that&#39;s<br/>
harvested from a lake in California that is loaded with nutrients.  It&#39;s<br/>
also helped me some with chronic fatigue.)<br/>
