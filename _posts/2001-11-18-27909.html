<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117562849">Another place where recordkeeping is essential is with inventing.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has an idea for an invention (every kid that I ever met, it seems). Go to www.patentcafe.com for tips and tricks on keeping a log, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Search for &quot;invention log&quot;, too.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is useful.<br/>
