<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031145786">I&#39;ve seen them fairly often, fringe benefit of living in Canada.  When the solar storms were at their worst 11 years ago (they&#39;re on an 11 year cycle, we&#39;re at primo northern lights time again), a friend of mine and I drove far out of town to watch them.  Not only could we see them, but we could hear them, they make a wierd humming, whining sound, kind of like a saw being played.  There are lots of Dene and Innu stories about the lights and their sounds.<br/>
