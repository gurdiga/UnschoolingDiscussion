&lt;&lt; Ooh, how about Cat Ballou? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I shall seek it out! Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Holly hasn&#39;t seen Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, either.<br/>
We own Oklahoma, but since I don&#39;t much like it I haven&#39;t recommended it to <br/>
her.<br/>
(I was viscerally offended by New Yorkers pretending to be Okies; can&#39;t help <br/>
it, and by Broadway treatment of regionalish music.  I like Broadway stuff, <br/>
but that one and Anne Get Your Gun both make me bristle, though Holly loves <br/>
the latter.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Broadway musicals.  We seen (and own some): &quot;South Pacific,&quot; &quot;My Fair <br/>
Lady,&quot; &quot;West Side Story,&quot; &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Singing in the <br/>
Rain&quot;, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;, and others.  At dinner, <br/>
someone will make a comment similar to a favorite line in a song, and <br/>
they&#39;ll break out in a chorus.  It&#39;s fun...they make me laugh.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Aw, c&#39;mon, Sandra!  Oklahoma&#39;s a great musical.  So it&#39;s not<br/>
believable...what&#39;s the problem?  Most of them aren&#39;t....  ;)<br/>
<br/>
(teasing.  if you read that as picking on Sandra, go back and try again!)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Crazy for You&quot; might sorta appeal to both Keith and Holly.  It&#39;s a remake<br/>
of Girl Crazy, which though it&#39;s full of great Gershwin tunes, is so utterly<br/>
un-PC that nobody did it for years.  But Crazy for You has all the good<br/>
tunes and then some, is set out West (and the New Yorkers look like idiots),<br/>
has a gun scene, and has some great tap dancing in it.  A big Broadway hit<br/>
not too many years back.<br/>
<br/>
No good western stuff in High Society, but you and Holly might enjoy it<br/>
together.  Know that one?  It&#39;s one of my favorites.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Adventures in Babysitting, there&#39;s a line that goes &quot;Oh, Brad!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was watching it with Marty and Holly and said, in the proper rhythm &quot;Oh, <br/>
Janet!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;WAY wrong movie,&quot; Marty said.  But they both got the joke.  Exformation. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
