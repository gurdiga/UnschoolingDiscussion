<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612361885">When I was in Australia, a couple of people said they would come and see me next time.  There&#39;s not going to be a next time (I&#39;m at least 95% sure of that).<br/>
<br/>
Ditto some of these:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m doing three Always Learning Live events and I&#39;ll be at the HSC conference.<br/>
Minnesota, end of May/beginning of June:<br/>

<br/>
Hotel reservations MUST BE MADE TODAY OR TOMORROW.  Or they&#39;ll be full-price.  <br/>
The hotel is the shuttle hub, though, and next to the Mayo Clinic, so buses will go there. Registration for the event will still be possible; you might need to stay elsewhere, though.  (You could still come to the pizza party if you&#39;re off site; it&#39;s part of the cost of the event.)<br/>
<br/>
Next year, I&#39;m staying home.<br/>
<br/>
End of July/beginning of August, I will be in Santa Clara, California at the HSC conference.<br/>

<br/>
They won&#39;t have me two years in a row; see me this year, if you want to see me in California.<br/>
<br/>
In September I&#39;ll be in Maine with Laurie Wolfrum, Keith Dodd, and Robert Prieto (Mr. Colleen Prieto; she&#39;s hesitant to speak, but her husband isn&#39;t). <br/>
It&#39;s too soon to register for that, but soon.<br/>
Ditto December in Albuquerque.   Jill and Luke Parmer will speak.  Keith and I will speak.  I have a couple of &quot;maybe&quot; people thinking about it and seeing what can be arranged.  <br/>
<br/>
In 2015 I don&#39;t plan to go anywhere.  I plan to try to stay home and do at-home things.  I&#39;m behind on projects and am very tired after the past several months.   So unless there&#39;s money involved or it&#39;s somewhere I have never been (or the UK, which I&#39;m always willing to go back to), I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to speak in 2015 if it&#39;s not at my house or at the Ramada Albuquerque at the very end of December.  That hotel is perfect, and they like me and the Always Learning Live groups that have been there.<br/>
<br/>
So back to my point...<br/>
Don&#39;t wait for next year, if you&#39;re in range of Minnesota, northern California (Bay area), Maine or New Mexico.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t swear in court I&#39;m staying home.  I might perk up and want to go.  But right now, a declaration of intent to stay home sounds really wonderful. :-)<br/>
