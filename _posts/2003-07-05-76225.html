<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506658922">Okay, the e-mail I&#39;m responding to is 5 days old, but I&#39;m trying to catch up!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve just finished three Nancy Drew mysteries on tape - all that our library archives had to offer.  The Hidden Staircase, Mystery At Shadow Ranch, and The Secret In the Old Clock.  Forrest (12) and Meredith (10) both thought  The Hidden Staircase was the best of the three.<br/>
<br/>
They did not start with  #1 (Old Clock), and it didn&#39;t seem to make a difference.<br/>
Right now, Harry Potter&#39;s filling in, but we hope to find more Nancy when we finish with Harry!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099724921">I haven&#39;t seen anyone on this thread mention The Happy Hollisters series books.  I absolutley devoured them when I was a kid.  They are mystery books (along the same line as The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew), but are solved by a whole family of kids (I think there were 6 or 8 of them) ranging in age from toddler to teen.  REALLY neat books, were old when I was a kid (my Mom got my collection from a tag sale, but you should be able to find some somewhere -- Ebay maybe?).  I cherish my set and can&#39;t wait for my kids to discover them!<br/>

Bobbsey Twins -- and the old Nancy Drews for that matter -- they have some<br/>
unpleasant stereotypes and attitudes towards blacks in them.<br/>
<br/>
I think the attitudes are more upsetting for adults than kids, though. I<br/>
suspect for me as a child I must have skipped over them as unimportant to<br/>
the story or attributed them to past times since I didn&#39;t see those<br/>
attitudes in real life. It was just a bizarre concept to me that people<br/>
would be treated differently because of race. (The attitudes were there, of<br/>
course, but I didn&#39;t see them.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have all of them, I think, with my name written in them in my my ten year <br/>
old writing, and my eleven year old writing...<br/>
<br/>
I read the first one to Holly, about when they move into their new house.  <br/>
She liked it because their little sister is named Holly.<br/>
<br/>
Next I started reading her the one about a Pueblo Indian man from New Mexico <br/>
who lives near them and they get to go to New Mexico.  I hadn&#39;t read it since <br/>
I was little.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I was editing the text as I was going (using his name or just <br/>
&quot;he&quot; or &quot;him&quot; where the book had REPEATEDLY said &quot;the Indian,&quot; Holly kept looking <br/>
at me funny about it, and finally when the part came where there was an <br/>
archery contest and he won because he was Indian, Holly didn&#39;t want to hear any <br/>
more.  I had let slip a few &quot;the Indian&quot; references and she said &quot;Why are they <br/>
saying that?&quot;  I said &quot;I guess there aren&#39;t too many people from New Mexico in <br/>
Ohio or wherever they are.&quot;  I was trying to be conversational and casual <br/>
instead of saying &quot;Because it&#39;s old-fashioned and lots of people were carelessly <br/>
racial in those days.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was glad she was offended and didn&#39;t want to finish, though, because it was <br/>
driving me crazy.<br/>

I&#39;ll have to read them again and see if that&#39;s true -- I&#39;d never heard that, but then again, I don&#39;t know many people who are even familiar with the series.  Given the era they were written in, I suppose it wouldn&#39;t be too much of a surprise, but it never occured to me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the heads up, I&#39;ll let you know if it&#39;s true once I&#39;ve had a chance to check it out!<br/>

<br/>
Are you talking about Happy Hollisters?<br/>
<br/>
If so, and if the ethics and interpersonal relationships are questionable, <br/>
what would &quot;great for kids&quot; mean then?<br/>
<br/>
The mysteries are pretty lame.<br/>
The dialog is not sparkly.<br/>
<br/>
I think in the balance, they&#39;re not great books.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid they came in the mail, they were cheap, and I was reading <br/>
them by myself as an escape from being where I was.   I think they were less <br/>
than $3 each with postage, and so a good deal for my dad, to feel like he was <br/>
furnishing me something educational.  <br/>
<br/>
But for Holly, they&#39;re a dusty corner of a big full-color, sweet-scented <br/>
world.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was actually talking about Nancy Drew.  Those books were a great deal of <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought Nancy Drew was pretty progressive.  Her dad didn&#39;t tell her to stop <br/>
doing what she was doing, and she was more likely to ask her boyfriend to <br/>
bring her a key or a file folder than anything else.  And when she was in danger, <br/>
she called her female friend over her boyfriend most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Feminist fantasy, in the 60&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The Happy Hollisters, though, are tagging along with their dad on some buying <br/>
trip or to visit friend of a friend, and while one of the themes was <br/>
geography and travel (which is cool) the author seemed not to consider that people <br/>
from those exotic locales might actually read the books too!<br/>
<br/>
When McCloud was on, years ago, Dennis Weaver was playing  a cop from Taos <br/>
who goes to NYC.  It was a bummer, in the pilot episode, that he mispronounced <br/>
Taos.   They have TVs in New Mexico.  Even in Taos!<br/>

I see what you mean about the Hollisters, I never read them, and I should <br/>
have clarified in my first post that I was talking about Nancy Drew.<br/>
I remember McCloud, and most of the other tv shows of the time.  No one <br/>
researched anything, they just wrote it, slapped it on tv and people went for it.  <br/>
Hence the name &quot;Ugly American&quot; ?  <br/>
People really do need to be more sensitive<br/>
to others, I think that is one reason that I don&#39;t post much, I am always <br/>
concerned that someone will take what I say the wrong way.  <br/>
Anyway, I enjoyed Nancy Drew, never read the Hollisters. and am all for being <br/>
sensitive to others!  LOL<br/>
