<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620873899">This is ringing true in our family, in the area of bedtimes. I let it go a <br/>
couple of years ago, and my kids all go to bed quite late. One, ehem, quite <br/>
EARLY ;) But!!! What the kids really want to do, even if they have to get up <br/>
early, they do. This tells me that, when it is important to them, they are <br/>
capable of rising and shining (or tidying up, or being on time, or saving <br/>
money, etc.) I don&#39;t have to give them sheets of paperwork and make sure <br/>
it&#39;s in on time; when they NEED to be on time, they will BE on time. This <br/>
has happened with all our kids more than once.<br/>

&gt;She tries to do all these things - the regular life kinds of things -<br/>
&gt;as efficiently as possible to leave the MOST possible time for those<br/>
&gt;things about which she is passionate.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;So - this wasn&#39;t intended to be bragging - this is to tell you that it<br/>
&gt;IS possible and that it is, in fact, wanting the maximum possible<br/>
&gt;opportunities to follow her own passions that motivates her to BE<br/>
&gt;responsible and organized. AND - tonight she cleaned the kitchen.<br/>
&gt;Cheerfully. WOW! And she went to bed early because, she said, &quot;I have a<br/>
&gt;really long day tomorrow and want to make sure I&#39;m rested.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;  When she grows up and has &quot;grown up&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; responsibilities, will it be hard for her to do things that she isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; passionate about - things that a lot of adults really don&#39;t want to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; like paying bills on time or cleaning the house or taking out the trash<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc...<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s where I have the problem with, &quot;some things just need to be done,<br/>
&gt;like it or not,&quot; line. It doesn&#39;t offer any reasonable explanation why they<br/>
&gt;should be done. &gt;Dawn (in NS) </span></blockquote></div>

---------------<br/>
 <br/>
It was a pleasant surprise for me the first few times it happened here, but  <br/>
now I can say it has happened with my kids hundreds of times.  <br/>
 <br/>
Usually, at night, I ask each kid what&#39;s going on the next day, and let  them <br/>
know my plans, so we can catch conflicts and help remind each other.   One <br/>
night I didn&#39;t see Kirby at all, and I had forgotten I had an early morning  <br/>
appointment with Marty at the orthodontist.  On the way home I remembered  Kirby <br/>
had a 9:00 a.m. meeting and I had forgotten all about reminding him and I  <br/>
felt a moment of panic, but when we got nearer the house, I saw his van was  gone.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty&#39;s alarm clock just went off.  It&#39;s 9:50 and he&#39;s supposed to be  at <br/>
work at 11:00.  I thought &quot;how nice&quot; and kept typing here, but it didn&#39;t  stop.  <br/>
I had to turn it off, because he&#39;s already upstairs, having woken up  before <br/>
the alarm.  He just started the shower.<br/>
 <br/>
HOW COOL IS THAT!?  He&#39;s 16 and would have done what he&#39;s doing  whether I <br/>
was home or not, whether I was asleep or not.  <br/>
