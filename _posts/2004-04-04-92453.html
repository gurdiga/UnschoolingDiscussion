<div id="ygrps-yiv-18526833">Thought some of you might be interested in this. Recently, a reporter <br/>
from our newspaper interviewed myself and another unschooling mom for <br/>
an article on unschooling. It ran on the front page of the <br/>
Sunday paper today, which surprised me a bit, and spanned 3 pages. I <br/>
thought it would be buried somewhere in the educational beat. <br/>
Overall, I&#39;m pretty pleased with the way the article turned out, <br/>
especially considering some of the recent nationwide press concerning <br/>
homeschooling. The woman who wrote it took several different <br/>
occasions to interview us and the kids, plus sent out a photographer <br/>
for an afternoon. That was the tough part - how do you photograph <br/>
unschooling? Every day is different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455045908">I loved the article Robin.  You did a great job getting your point across to<br/>
the reporter.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The following quote saddened me though.  Shame doesn&#39;t play a part in my<br/>
kid&#39;s lives at all, let alone in their learning.  I&#39;d say there is a lot<br/>
more shame in school at home families than ever there was in unschooling<br/>
families, on the whole.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some other homeschoolers question the wisdom and fairness of the parental<br/>
choice to unschool. Colleen Bauman, a member of another Eugene homeschooling<br/>
cooperative, says her seventh-grade daughter&#39;s homeschooled education is<br/>
self-directed to a great extent, but she believes pure unschooling crosses<br/>
the line.  I have seen some failures around unschooling that disturb me,&quot;<br/>
she says. &quot;It sounds ideal - &#39;If the child wants to learn to read, they<br/>
will.&#39; &quot; But often, she says, it is shame that finally spurs the unschooled<br/>
child - an unhealthy motivator, she feels.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604319001">The article was interesting, and it&#39;s great to see positive stories <br/>
about unschooling that hopefully will educate the general public.  <br/>
What I found interesting is how the National Education Association <br/>
discourages homeschooling, and how reporters don&#39;t ever seem to <br/>
correlate this with the fact that teachers (and the whole educational <br/>
administration) are dependent upon the schools for their livelihood <br/>
(whether or not schools successfully &quot;educate&quot;).  The NEA is a union <br/>
trying to protect its interests.  Anyhow, you said it best; <br/>
the &quot;proof is in the pudding.&quot;<br/>

age peers, they feel a lot less shame than any child in school would. <br/>
After all, they don&#39;t really know if they&#39;re &quot;ahead&quot; or &quot;behind&quot;. <br/>
There&#39;s no such thing if one is not staging a competition. They just <br/>
are where they are, and it&#39;s always right where they should be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321631361">It is a wonderful article, Robin, the best I remember seeing ever. <br/>
In-depth coverage, lots of specifics, clear statements of what <br/>
unschooling is really like. I loved it. I even liked the quotes from <br/>
the school principals spokesperson, because they were so obviously <br/>
ludicrous coming after the descriptions of the kids&#39; activities and <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations and thanks for taking the time to do it!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349712742">I loved it! The only negative comment I saw (the one someone here had <br/>
commented on) was WAY down at the bottom of the article, so someone <br/>
would really have had to read the article to see it.<br/>

If your kids want to eat in the cafeteria, most hospital cafeterias are <br/>
open to the public and serve really standard cafeteria food.<br/>

<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
I was figuring that some shame might come to late reading unschoolers <br/>
because of hanging around kids (and adults) who have been exposed to <br/>
schoolish expectations.  But perhaps underlying her statement is a <br/>
belief that she has that an unschooler who doesn&#39;t learn to read by age <br/>
11 is being lackadaisical.  She appears to be assuming that that child <br/>
would perform reading tasks sooner IN school.  You are right, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t realize how much group schooling would shame a later-developing <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
Your comment helped me think this through a little further, rather than <br/>
just getting stuck on what she said.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Overall quite a nice article.</div>

Merlin, OR.<br/>
They tend to thinks we&#39;re nuts for wanting to homeschool our 4 yr <br/>
old. They have no idea we actually unschool!<br/>
I&#39;ll try to read the other replies. Hopefully there will be more info <br/>
on the woman who was worried about unschooling failures, so I can <br/>
forward that along as well!<br/>
