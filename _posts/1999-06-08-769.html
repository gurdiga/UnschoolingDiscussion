<div id="ygrps-yiv-277898580">&lt;I need to do US History for my son next year and have gotten most of<br/>
what I want to cover the course but there is one area I need some advice<br/>
on the 20th century. My son has ADD and is a very visual learner so I<br/>
want to do as much with video tapes as possible and I was wondering if<br/>
anyone has any reccomendations for videos that would cover the 20th<br/>
century section?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Jim ~<br/>
<br/>
	I would recommend you check out Discovery, A&E, and PBS websites. They<br/>
usually have some great videos for sale. Some of them offer mail order<br/>
catalogues, as well. <br/>
<br/>
	Our daughter is ADD too (she&#39;s 16) and for her US History this year,<br/>
she and my husband (Vietnam and Desert Storm veteran) are going to watch<br/>
the PBS Vietnam video series together.<br/>
<br/>
    Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893496589">I&#39;m not sure where you live, but we live in WA, and we have the Dish Network.<br/>
Our bill total with 2 sets of movie channels (HBO- Showtime, etc) is about $40.<br/>
We love it. Also, if you have a dish from another company, you get a BIG discount<br/>
(we HAD Primestar).<br/>
Just thought I would add a bit of info., on how much cheaper the dish is, than<br/>
regular cable.<br/>

<br/>

 <br/>
&gt;IOW, the movies run us about $20.00 a month.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The service never goes out, either.  We&#39;ve had it for about two and a half<br/>
<br/>
&gt;years, and I&#39;ve never seen anything worse than a few seconds of atmospheric<br/>
<br/>
&gt;fizzle.  <br/>

 A&E and the History Channel  have classroom guides--my 11 yo dd gets up at <br/>
6:50 every morning(her idea not mine!!) to watch A&E Classroom--she <br/>
particulary like Biography for Kids.  The programs are about 45 min long I <br/>
think and they will send you their program guides. You can also print it from <br/>
their website <br/>

Yep, I&#39;ve got this one and it runs me about $40 a month, we have two hook ups <br/>
to it though and all of the superstation channels and network, which I&#39;d like <br/>
to drop, may since Home Improvement is off the air, a dh thing.  Right now I <br/>
think the special is that the set up system is *free*....  Nothing for the <br/>
dish or the box....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301937498">I was just wondering something. A while ago I visited the PBS website, and<br/>
they said they were going to show this continuing documentary on the<br/>
Japanese camps in America during world war II. I&#39;d really like to watch<br/>
them, but I don&#39;t know if I missed them or not (I believe the shows were<br/>
going to start in May?). When I was at the website I had checked the<br/>
schedules but there wasn&#39;t one for Connecticut I don&#39;t think. Has anyone<br/>
watched this documentary? Can you tell me how it was? ~Eryn<br/>

then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>
