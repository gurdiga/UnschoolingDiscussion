&lt;&lt; How many Buddhist retreats are there in N. CA?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine there are too many!! I looked it up and it is the Shasta <br/>
abbey in Mt. Shasta. Let me know if you find out it&#39;s the same one.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
