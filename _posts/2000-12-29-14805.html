<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We use &quot;Seventh Generation&quot; automatic Dishwashing detergent. It&#39;s phosphate<br/>
free, has no chlorine bleach, no dyes or fragrances, is non-toxic,<br/>
biodegradable, and not tested on animals, has no animal ingredients.<br/>
<br/>
The name of the company comes from the following quote: &quot;In our every<br/>
deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven<br/>
generations&quot; -- from the Great Law of the Iroquois Conferacy. They make a<br/>
whole line of household products, we also use their toilet paper<br/>
(non-chlorine bleached, recycled) and other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Their website is http://www/seventhgen.com  and you can get a free copy of<br/>
&quot;The Seventh Generation Guide to a Toxic Free Home&quot; at the site.<br/>
<br/>
For dishwashing detergent, I&#39;ve also heard that you can mix Baking Soda and<br/>
Borax in equal parts. I have not tried this yet myself.<br/>
