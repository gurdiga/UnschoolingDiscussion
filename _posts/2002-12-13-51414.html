If no one had ever said to you, &quot;I&#39;m not a short order cook,&quot; would you<br/>
feel <br/>
differently?<br/>
 <br/>
The following tangent is not aimed at Betsy.  It&#39;s just a reminder of the<br/>
<br/>
power of phrases and a reminder for us to dissect language sometimes to<br/>
stir <br/>
out those lumps.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes a phrase, especially if it was used on us as an insult or<br/>
put-down, <br/>
tends to take on a life of its own, a reality without basis.<br/>
 <br/>
Same thing happens with &quot;spoiled brat&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re letting your kids run<br/>
all <br/>
over you,&quot; and &quot;How will they learn?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Phrases become rock-hard pain to be avoided sometimes.<br/>
 <br/>
Instead of thinking of it as whether you will or will not be a<br/>
short-order <br/>
cook, how about trying to never think that question ever again.  Just<br/>
banish <br/>
it.  Shove it down.<br/>
 <br/>
Instead, think of what the value of being satisfied is.  Physically <br/>
satisfied.  Nourished.  Full.  Not needy.<br/>
 <br/>
If your child feels needy or unsatisfied, an insult won&#39;t satisfy him.<br/>
My mom tried that.  She failed dozens of times, but saw it as a failing<br/>
in <br/>
ME, not in her.<br/>
She told me, when I said &quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; variants from &quot;No you&#39;re not&quot; to<br/>
&quot;You <br/>
have never been hungry a day in your life.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Probably she heard those things from her parents, and rather than really <br/>
think about what it might mean to me to have my mother hand me some food<br/>
with <br/>
a smile and a hug, she decided she didn&#39;t HAVE to do that, and maybe she <br/>
could train me to stop asking.<br/>
