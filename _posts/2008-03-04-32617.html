<div id="ygrps-yiv-368079644">So, my 2yo has never had any sort of bedtime or bedtime routine. She<br/>
was nursed until she self-weaned at 20months, and we have a family bed<br/>
which includes our 6yo. She&#39;s always just come to me when she was<br/>
tired and nursed to sleep or I&#39;d hold her and she&#39;d fall asleep and I<br/>
take her to bed at some point. Well, my ds has never had a bed &quot;time&quot;<br/>
but starting when he was 5 we would usher him to bed at some point (in<br/>
the family bed) but dh, dd and I would still be up in the livingroom.<br/>
<br/>
About 3 months ago we lifted bedtime restrictions. The problem is that<br/>
my ds and dd want to stay up late, which is fine with me, but they<br/>
don&#39;t want to stay out in the livingroom alone. So we&#39;ve been letting<br/>
them come in the family bed and put a movie on in there. Well this is<br/>
meaning that dh and I are getting very little sleep. The movie is<br/>
quiet enough not to bother us but the kids are arguing about one<br/>
getting in front of the other, or they are eating food noisily, or one<br/>
touched the other one, or 2yo is jumping and climbing all over, or<br/>
they need something to eat or drink but wont go to the kitchen alone,<br/>
etc. It would be easier with my 6yo because I can tell him &#39;look, it&#39;s<br/>
your choice to stay up, but you can&#39;t make us stay up too&#39; but my dd<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand that. My dh really needs to sleep because he gets<br/>
up at 4:30am for work, and while I can sleep in, I really hate losing<br/>
half my day because I needed to sleep in until 11am to make up for not<br/>
sleeping at night.<br/>
<br/>
how can I be respectful of their chosen sleep schedule without it<br/>
impeding on mine and dh&#39;s? if they want to stay up but end up coming<br/>
to bed solely because they don&#39;t want to be alone in the livingroom,<br/>
they aren&#39;t really getting that feeling of having control over<br/>
themselves, they feel like it&#39;s not *really* a choice. <br/>
<br/>
any ideas? please? <br/>
<br/>
are there resources for the radical side of &#39;unschooling&#39; beginning<br/>
from toddlerhood? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Sandra and Pam, I saw you guys speak at HENA this weekend and<br/>
really enjoyed it. My husband was quite reassured afterwards and I was<br/>
really inspired. Thanks for coming!</div>

How exactly are you losing 1/2 a day by sleeping & spending time with your<br/>
kids?? Are there dire things that *have to* (as in, someone will DIE if you<br/>
don&#39;t) be done before noon?? Can some of those things be done after<br/>
midnight? Can you get up at 8 and do some stuff and then take a nap before<br/>
the kids wake up?<br/>
I&#39;d be careful of that kind of talk to a 6 year old -- how would you respond<br/>
to him if he copied your modeling? Perhaps looking at the situation as a<br/>
partnership instead of adversaries would help -- he has needs (they have)<br/>
and he&#39;s turning to the most important human with far more life experience<br/>
to help those needs get met. Of course he can&#39;t *make you* --it sure would<br/>
be nice if you just *did it* because you love him enough to let go of<br/>
whatever selfish thought is stopping you from really connecting. (not that<br/>
selfish thoughts are inherently bad, they should definitely be well examined<br/>
before acting upon them!)<br/>

<h4>Ryan</h4>
<time> 3 Mar 2008, at 10:13pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075991490">Hi.  We did a lot of these same things (my son is 7, daughter is 4, <br/>
and another son is due in May) - the family bed, no bedtimes, etc.  <br/>
And it certainly wasn&#39;t always conducive to our sleep either.<br/>
<br/>
We did several things to try to make sure everyone was able to get <br/>
some sleep but do it in ways that they enjoyed.  One thing we&#39;d do <br/>
whenever we were in one of those cycles where the kids kept wanting <br/>
to stay up later and later is that we&#39;d put more of an emphasis on <br/>
our mornings.  My wife and I would get up earlier and, sooner or <br/>
later, the kids would start getting up earlier as well in order to be <br/>
with us.  Eventually, they came to enjoy the mornings together better <br/>
than the nights together, and since they were up at 7 they naturally <br/>
fell asleep earlier in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
Reading to them also worked.  We found that if we all went to bed <br/>
earlier and spent an hour or so reading, they&#39;d almost invariable <br/>
fall asleep within an hour.  They loved having us read to them so <br/>
much that they&#39;d drop whatever else they were doing to crawl into bed <br/>
and hear (part of) a good book!  <br/>
<br/>
We also made sure that, even though we had a family bed where <br/>
everyone was welcome, they also had their own rooms where they could <br/>
sleep, play, watch TV, play games, etc. We tried to put a lot of <br/>
extra effort into making those spaces as interesting and fun as <br/>
possible and not to make the family bedroom too much of a playing <br/>
place.   <br/>
<br/>
Given that the new no routine routine has only been in place for <br/>
three months, it&#39;s still probably new to them and might take awhile <br/>
to sort itself out.  <br/>
<br/>
I write this with a smile since it&#39;s midnight and I just came down <br/>
from saying good night to my daughter, who loves to stay up late and <br/>
sleep late in the morning.  My son usually gives up around 10:30 and <br/>
goes to bed.  But we still have strange sleeping arrangements and <br/>
never know who will start or end up where.  The last few nights my <br/>
son has wanted to sleep in our bed, possibly because he&#39;s a bit <br/>
anxious about the new baby.  So he&#39;s slept there for the past two <br/>
nights and I&#39;ve slept in his room.  My daughter starts in her own bed <br/>
but usually ends up somewhere else.  <br/>
<br/>
Our goal now is to make sure that every room has a comfortable place <br/>
to sleep, because we never know where any of us will be come morning!<br/>
<br/>

I loved what you said here about marriage being forever but babies <br/>
are not.  That very thought helped me through a lot of sleepy days at <br/>
work!  Now that both of the kids have their own rooms and their own <br/>
beds, which they took to with no prompting from us, I know that I <br/>
miss sleeping with them more than they miss sleeping with me. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In our house, dh also gets up to go to work (not nearly as early as  <br/>
yours), so I&#39;ve explained that to Shelby (9)  for a long time.  &quot;It&#39;s  <br/>
ok if you want to stay up, but we can&#39;t keep Daddy awake, because he  <br/>
has to get up.&quot;  When Shelby is on a late night schedule, we sleep in  <br/>
her room.  We have a queen size bed in there so we&#39;re comfy.  I wish I  <br/>
had done this years ago...including when she was a baby.  Having this  <br/>
other room has removed so much conflict from the sleep pattern issue.<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be a little disjointed, so just try to go with  <br/>
me....Every day my mother, who lives next door, comes over for lunch  <br/>
around 1.  Some days we&#39;re just making it downstairs, so it&#39;s really  <br/>
breakfast.  I found out that Shelby likes to stay up late to hang out  <br/>
with me.  (What a spectacular reason to stay up!) But I noticed that I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t getting the things that &quot;need to get done&quot; done, because once  <br/>
my mom comes over I don&#39;t get a chance to do those things.  (I&#39;d  <br/>
rather spend time with people I love than do those &quot;important&quot;  <br/>
things.) So, lately, I&#39;ve been getting up earlier and doing my stuff  <br/>
so that I can hang out with my mom and then Shelby without  <br/>
distractions.  And lo and behold, we&#39;ve been going to bed earlier.   <br/>
The late night thing really is all about getting time with me. :-)  By  <br/>
the way, earlier is like 1 or 2 a.m.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;adult&quot; time with my hubby....well, that could be more  <br/>
frequent, but we both know that Shelby is more important, and we&#39;ll  <br/>
get our chance again.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
And I second Diana&#39;s recommendation for Always Unschooled.  It&#39;s a  <br/>
fabulous list!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482371767">-=-ut you can&#39;t make us stay up too&#39; but my dd<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand that. My dh really needs to sleep because he gets<br/>
up at 4:30am for work, and while I can sleep in, I really hate losing<br/>
half my day because I needed to sleep in until 11am to make up for not<br/>
sleeping at night.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could be in the room where they&#39;re watching TV; that&#39;s one option.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby wasn&#39;t sleepy and wanted to watch a video, the deal in  <br/>
advance was he could stay up IF he didn&#39;t make noise, if he didn&#39;t  <br/>
wake anyone else up.  As far as I know, I was the first one to talk  <br/>
about letting Kirby stay up late, which gradually turned to the  <br/>
widespread belief that unschooling required &quot;no bedtimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So lots of families seem to be confused and suffering and blaming  <br/>
other unschoolers, or &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/sleeping">http://sandradodd.com/sleeping</a><br/>
<br/>
I never said &quot;no bedtime.&quot;  I said you can stay up IF, and when &quot;if&quot;  <br/>
wasn&#39;t met, they needed to go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
It seems many families have taken from that &quot;You never have to go to  <br/>
bed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your husband&#39;s need to sleep is more important than unschooling is.   <br/>
That&#39;s a non-negotiable thing.  Yes, if he were a single parent he  <br/>
would need to get up and take care of kids, but he&#39;s NOT a single  <br/>
parent.  He&#39;s the working partner and YOU-the-mom are the nighttime  <br/>
parent.  Get the kids out of his room.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was two and woke up and wasn&#39;t at all sleepy and I was too  <br/>
sleepy to stay up with him because I was pregnant, I would put him in  <br/>
the high chair in front of a six-hour video of Disney movies or  <br/>
Warner Brothers cartoons.  I&#39;d give him food, drink, a little pillow,  <br/>
a baby blanket, and go back to bed.  In the morning he would be  <br/>
asleep on the tray with the pillow.  That happened many times.  But  <br/>
he wasn&#39;t running around the house making noise.  We made a deal and  <br/>
he kept it, knowing the alternative was being in the bed.  And each  <br/>
time was &quot;okay, yes, this time okay,&quot; not &quot;You have the absolute  <br/>
right to get up and be attended to in any way, at any moment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He always slept enough.  He rarely napped anytime in his life.  I  <br/>
never &quot;made them&quot; nap, and if he napped it was because he was tired.<br/>
<br/>
-=-how can I be respectful of their chosen sleep schedule without it  <br/>
impeding on mine and dh&#39;s?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;re too little to &quot;choose a sleep schedule,&quot; and I don&#39;t  <br/>
think they have done that.  I think they&#39;re responding to  <br/>
restrictions, and that you&#39;re responding to having restricted by NOT  <br/>
restricting.<br/>
<br/>
Everything should have some basis in what&#39;s good for the family and  <br/>
what&#39;s rational and what&#39;s considerate.  THAT should come before  <br/>
&quot;freedom&quot; if freedom means the freedom to be rude and disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-they don&#39;t want to be alone in the livingroom, they aren&#39;t really  <br/>
getting that feeling of having control over themselves, they feel  <br/>
like it&#39;s not *really* a choice. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Where did the &quot;control over themselves&quot; phrase come from?  I&#39;m  <br/>
wondering, because I&#39;m seeing more and more odd and harmful ideas  <br/>
coming across the list here.  If it&#39;s on my site, I want to put a  <br/>
disclaimer up there, or clarify it.  If it&#39;s from another list that  <br/>
was ever associated with this one, I might want to write to the list  <br/>
owner and ask her to cease and desist (or have balancing information).<br/>
<br/>
YOU the mom have to have &quot;control&quot; over the peace of your home.  Your  <br/>
husband&#39;s sleep and your two year old&#39;s desire to be awake because a  <br/>
five year old is awake are two very, very different things and  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be anywhere near each other at night.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164390667">-=-are there resources for the radical side of &#39;unschooling&#39; beginning<br/>
from toddlerhood? -=-<br/>
<br/>
There is a list called Always Unschooled, but I am not on it and  <br/>
can&#39;t personally speak to its clarity.  I&#39;m concerned about people  <br/>
starting to refer to their lives as &quot;RU&quot; (I don&#39;t like that at all  <br/>
for many reasons) and some lists are calling Unschooling &quot;US&quot; (which  <br/>
sucks nineteen ways from Sunday).<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about mindful parenting.  Let&#39;s talk about being  <br/>
compassionate and peaceful.  Let&#39;s talk about living by principles.  <br/>
Then there&#39;s  no need for separate resources based on the age of the  <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------I&#39;m changing the subject only  <br/>
slightly.--------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I am very concerned after the conference last weekend.  It wasn&#39;t an  <br/>
unschooling conference, but it did quite lean that direction.  I  <br/>
observed three families in which young children were behaving  <br/>
horribly.  I wouldn&#39;t want them at my house, though in one case I met  <br/>
and really liked the parents.   The other two I just saw at a  <br/>
distance, so I honestly have NO CLUE who they were, so if I say  <br/>
something here and the family in question is reading, just suck it  <br/>
up. No confessions are   requested and none are welcom.   I don&#39;t  <br/>
know who you are and it&#39;s fine.  I want to talk about the problems,  <br/>
not the people.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a child hit a parent in the face, and the parent acted like it  <br/>
was sweet and good.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a child kick a father who was carrying another child and  <br/>
pushing a stroller.  He didn&#39;t respond negatively to having been kicked.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a child kick a mother.  Worse, a non-homeschooling friend of  <br/>
mine saw it and mentioned it to me, and thought it was very bad.<br/>
<br/>
All this reflects on unschooling itself, and not at all well.  There  <br/>
were people at the conference considering whether to be unschoolers.   <br/>
No doubt some of them also saw such behavior, and they might not even  <br/>
want to homeschool because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Being respectful to a child can&#39;t possibly include creating or  <br/>
condoning a situation in which he or she has to kick or hit to get a  <br/>
parent&#39;s attention, nor one in which kicking and hitting are treated  <br/>
as normal and good.<br/>
<br/>
In light of last week&#39;s discussion about the interaction at Wendy&#39;s,  <br/>
I will say that if ANY human being kicks me, I&#39;m going to respond  <br/>
negatively.  If a child comes up and kicks me I&#39;m not going to smile  <br/>
and say &quot;Oooh, hi.  Where&#39;s your mom?&quot;  I would most likely take the  <br/>
child strongly by the arm, establish eye contact and say &quot;Don&#39;t ever  <br/>
kick me again,&quot; and I would mean it.  I would say &quot;Don&#39;t kick  <br/>
people.  It&#39;s not okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Where did anyone get the idea that it was respectful to allow (or  <br/>
require, or approve) kicking in the shins?<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone *REALLY* using unschooling as an excuse to encourage  <br/>
horrible behavior?  Treating children like people involves helping  <br/>
them understand how to act as people are expected to act.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705576656">My kids are 4 & 2.  They like to stay up late - my son has lately been<br/>
staying up all night.  I work, and my husband stays home with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re struggling with the sleep schedules too.  There are times when my 4yo<br/>
is disruptive when others are sleeping (though most of the time he&#39;s not).<br/>
I&#39;m curious about this statement in Sandra&#39;s post:<br/>
<br/>
I never said &quot;no bedtime.&quot; I said you can stay up IF, and when &quot;if&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wasn&#39;t met, they needed to go to bed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we&#39;ve tried to get him to bed when &quot;ifs&quot; aren&#39;&#39;t met, and he&#39;s even<br/>
more disruptive (we all sleep in the same bed).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding - how do you follow through on the &quot;ifs&quot; in these<br/>
situations?  My husband has been staying up a good chunk of the night with<br/>
our son, and this works ok when our daughter sleeps in, but if she&#39;s up<br/>
early then my husband feels like he&#39;s not getting enough sleep.<br/>

I am afraid that some of the larger events could become somewhat of an<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926816620">Sandra--<br/>
Thank you for this very clear post.<br/>
<br/>
The friend that first used the word &quot;unschool&quot; to me and shared her resources had a son <br/>
that would eat food all over all of our houses, dropping it and getting sticky, dirty <br/>
handprints everywhere.  And then she would challenge us, in conversations about other <br/>
people not allowing their children enough &quot;freedom,&quot; to say anything negative about it.  <br/>
<br/>
The last straw came for me when her son went through a period of intense anger (he also <br/>
had un-addressed speech issues in which you couldn&#39;t understand any of his words at <br/>
six--so a possible source of his anger) and began to attack children that touched <br/>
anything he thought of as his, or that didn&#39;t agree with him about how a game should go.  <br/>
When I brought it up, she didn&#39;t seem to know what I was talking about, although I could <br/>
predict, and even head off some, of his attacks and outbursts.  In conversation with her it <br/>
was apparent that she didn&#39;t want to curtail his freedom or cause him to feel bad about his <br/>
behavior--all at the expense of other people&#39;s belongings and safety for their children.  <br/>
<br/>
We eventually ended the friendship when it became clear that nothing would change.  <br/>
Fortunately I was able to separate what looked like neglect to me from the concepts of <br/>
unschooling--but it took me awhile since she was my first &quot;mentor.&quot;  I am so glad to have <br/>
found better ones--including my own common sense!  It was confusing for me at first--I <br/>
seem to have to learn many things the hard way--and I watched for too long, as limits <br/>
were pushed way beyond comfort.  It was a great lesson for me in the end in what it can <br/>
really mean to stand up for my children--not just against an unfriendly or unkind <br/>
stranger, but to a destructive or dangerous influence in our lives disguised as a friend.  <br/>
Those can be much more insidious than a one time encounter, because of how I had <br/>
internalized things for a while that weren&#39;t good for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this post wasn&#39;t too long into the personal--but I thought in light of the behavior <br/>
you witnessed my experience might not be all that uncommon.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884604977">This came to me by private mail.  I&#39;m sending it to the list assuming  <br/>
that was an error.  I&#39;m leaving the name off in case it wasn&#39;t an error.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I think the adults have the right to the best quality sleep possible  <br/>
and the<br/>
children must be secondary.  Adults must drive 6000lb cars through  <br/>
traffic<br/>
while looking for addresses and tuning out the crying baby in the  <br/>
back. Life<br/>
and limb is riding on the quick reflexes of the adult.<br/>
<br/>
Adults must be productive, creative and attentive at their jobs so  <br/>
they can<br/>
provide for their children.  In these days of cost cutting, it is more<br/>
important than ever to be at your best on the job.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m studying to be a marriage therapist with a specialization in sex<br/>
therapy, and the reality is that most people don&#39;t get enough sleep  <br/>
or sex.<br/>
Poor sleep makes for bad sex, and that has a psychological and  <br/>
physiological<br/>
effect on the marriage.  Recent studies have shown that semen  <br/>
actually has<br/>
an anti-depressant effect for the woman.  Maybe because I have 7  <br/>
children<br/>
and learned that I was able to cheat sleep for 5 years then 8 years, but<br/>
then it got ridiculous, and we had to set better physical boundaries  <br/>
so that<br/>
we all didn&#39;t collapse.  A large household of small children requires<br/>
stable, well-rested parents.  The opposite of that is emotional chaos.<br/>
<br/>
Now my married 22 year old daughter has a dog that keeps her awake at  <br/>
night,<br/>
and sleeps sideways on their bed.  We tell them that they better  <br/>
learn to<br/>
figure that out before they have kids :)<br/>

<br/>
Holly and I have discussed this quite a bit, and discussed it last  <br/>
Thursday, most recently.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes what I see are the parents behaving the way they behave in  <br/>
front of other unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
At conferences where the kids are going to stay up late or whatever,  <br/>
you can just about pick out the ones whose parents don&#39;t usually give  <br/>
them choices, but who have let them loose for the span of the  <br/>
conference.  They exaggerate their actions and their freedom.   <br/>
There&#39;s a dishonesty about it all, and they don&#39;t act as calmly and  <br/>
rationally as those kids who are used to acting the same way when  <br/>
their parents aren&#39;t there as when they are.   I&#39;m talking about  <br/>
teens now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never said unschooling was easy.  I&#39;ve never stopped trying,  <br/>
daily, to help people understand it.  Because some people think I&#39;m  <br/>
abrasive (those who haven&#39;t heard me speak or don&#39;t know me, who  <br/>
don&#39;t know my tone of voice), the UnschoolingBasics list was created  <br/>
partly for a place for people to go who thought they wanted to know  <br/>
about unschooling but wanted to be where I wasn&#39;t, and partly with  <br/>
the intent that that would be for beginning info and  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion would be for more advanced info.  People aren&#39;t  <br/>
being sent over, though, for the same reasons most of us discovered  <br/>
long ago--it&#39;s good for those who get it to stay and help others get  <br/>
it.  So that plan didn&#39;t really turn out as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Another couple of lists grew out of the Unschooling Discussion list  <br/>
too, as more specialized lists, with the assumption that people would  <br/>
be on both.  AlwaysUnschooled and Shine with Unschooling.  Now  <br/>
neither seems like a specialized list anymore.  So with five or six  <br/>
lists where there used to be the AOL boards and then  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion, advice doesn&#39;t have the same cohesion it once  <br/>
did, and some odd ideas are treated less odd on one list than on  <br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s best to be around unschoolers whose kids are older, who  <br/>
have unschooled a long time, than around families whose kids are all  <br/>
young, if people want to gain faith in unschooling as a longterm  <br/>
philosophy and practice.  It is possible--I&#39;m guessing somewhat--that  <br/>
lists with more young children have fostered misunderstandings about  <br/>
*how* older unschoolers got to the point of trusting their children&#39;s  <br/>
judgment.<br/>
<br/>
I will say this for now:  It was NOT from being kept up all night by  <br/>
kids who hit and kick them.<br/>

them arrested if they were older.  Someone on a list here somewhere  <br/>
tried to shame me, saying I was scaring little kids.  Little kids  <br/>
SHOULD be scared, if they&#39;re assaulting other people.  Assault isn&#39;t  <br/>
okay.  It&#39;s not okay for parents to assault kids or for kids to  <br/>
assault other people (adults or children).  Pretending it&#39;s okay is  <br/>
harmful to all involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778368545">-=-Maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding - how do you follow through on the  <br/>
&quot;ifs&quot; in these<br/>
situations? My husband has been staying up a good chunk of the night  <br/>
with<br/>
our son, and this works ok when our daughter sleeps in, but if she&#39;s up<br/>
early then my husband feels like he&#39;s not getting enough sleep.-=-<br/>
<br/>
At least your husband isn&#39;t having to nurse a baby every few hours,  <br/>
but if he feels like he&#39;s not getting enough sleep, he&#39;s probably not.<br/>
<br/>
Can you give him full nights sleep all alone on the nights before  <br/>
your days off?  Could you stay up with the kids while he takes a nap  <br/>
and try to tire them out with running around at a park or something  <br/>
so they&#39;ll sleep sooner and longer?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t &quot;following through&quot; on the if, when one of mine wanted to  <br/>
stay up.  It was them agreeing to be quiet, and then them being  <br/>
quiet.  If I had to get up and say &quot;be quiet,&quot; they had another  <br/>
chance.  If I had to get up a second time, they knew it meant they  <br/>
had to get in bed and be still and quiet until the next morning.   <br/>
They had reading lights and books and cassette players and  <br/>
earphones.  they were never slammed into a bed alone in the dark.   <br/>
They all shared a room when they were little and I slept in there a  <br/>
lot of the time.<br/>
<br/>
The respect and trust came first, and I said &quot;Okay&quot; to lots of  <br/>
requests to expand their range of being away from me alone in all  <br/>
kinds of situations.<br/>
<br/>
In a situation in which there have been lots of rules and the parents  <br/>
change abruptly instead of gradually saying yes more and more, they  <br/>
will have problems I didn&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps some people have said &quot;Don&#39;t have any bedtime,&quot; but what I  <br/>
have said is &quot;my kids went to sleep when they were tired.&quot;  That  <br/>
might sound like &quot;no bedtimes,&quot; but it was part of a life since birth  <br/>
of being calm and accommodating together as much as we could, and  <br/>
sometimes being exasperated and exhausted, and the kids being in on  <br/>
the attempts to  find comfort for everyone in the family.<br/>
<br/>
Being kinder to a child who is brought to bed at a certain time,  <br/>
being soothing and sympathetic, talking him to sleep or singing him  <br/>
to sleep, is worlds better than saying &quot;Stay up as long as you want  <br/>
to and do whatever you want to.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919173578">wow. selfish? are you kidding me? i don&#39;t think that wanting to sleep<br/>
is selfish. i&#39;m very connected with my kids, my selfishness is not<br/>
preventing that. i think you are confusing &#39;NEEDS&#39; and &#39;WANTS&#39;. i woke<br/>
up a million times a night to nurse my daughter because she &#39;needed&#39;<br/>
it. she does not &#39;need&#39; to stay up and watch a movie at 2am, but she<br/>
&#39;wants&#39; to so i&#39;m trying to make it work while maintaining<br/>
consideration for everyone in our family. <br/>
<br/>
my understanding of not setting arbitrary bedtimes didn&#39;t mean that<br/>
the parent needed to stay up with the children. i&#39;d like to respect<br/>
their choice to stay up, i don&#39;t think that means i should have to. as<br/>
it is, i do stay up if we&#39;re doing something together or my son wants<br/>
to talk or wants me to watch him play his game or whatever it is. but<br/>
at some point, i want to sleep. i think i should be able to say &#39;you<br/>
can stay up if you&#39;d like, i really need to sleep now&#39;. isn&#39;t that<br/>
modeling listening your body&#39;s needs? <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a list called Always Unschooled, but I am not on it and  <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t personally speak to its clarity.  I&#39;m concerned about people  <br/>
&gt; starting to refer to their lives as &quot;RU&quot; (I don&#39;t like that at all  <br/>
&gt; for many reasons) and some lists are calling Unschooling &quot;US&quot; (which  <br/>
&gt; sucks nineteen ways from Sunday).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s talk about mindful parenting.  Let&#39;s talk about being  <br/>
&gt; compassionate and peaceful.  Let&#39;s talk about living by principles.  <br/>
&gt; Then there&#39;s  no need for separate resources based on the age of the  <br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ----------------------------------I&#39;m changing the subject only  <br/>
&gt; slightly.--------------------------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am very concerned after the conference last weekend.  It wasn&#39;t an  <br/>
&gt; unschooling conference, but it did quite lean that direction.  I  <br/>
&gt; observed three families in which young children were behaving  <br/>
&gt; horribly.  I wouldn&#39;t want them at my house, though in one case I met  <br/>
&gt; and really liked the parents.   The other two I just saw at a  <br/>
&gt; distance, so I honestly have NO CLUE who they were, so if I say  <br/>
&gt; something here and the family in question is reading, just suck it  <br/>
&gt; up. No confessions are   requested and none are welcom.   I don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; know who you are and it&#39;s fine.  I want to talk about the problems,  <br/>
&gt; not the people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I saw a child hit a parent in the face, and the parent acted like it  <br/>
&gt; was sweet and good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I saw a child kick a father who was carrying another child and  <br/>
&gt; pushing a stroller.  He didn&#39;t respond negatively to having been kicked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I saw a child kick a mother.  Worse, a non-homeschooling friend of  <br/>
&gt; mine saw it and mentioned it to me, and thought it was very bad.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All this reflects on unschooling itself, and not at all well.  There  <br/>
&gt; were people at the conference considering whether to be unschoolers.   <br/>
&gt; No doubt some of them also saw such behavior, and they might not even  <br/>
&gt; want to homeschool because of it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Being respectful to a child can&#39;t possibly include creating or  <br/>
&gt; condoning a situation in which he or she has to kick or hit to get a  <br/>
&gt; parent&#39;s attention, nor one in which kicking and hitting are treated  <br/>
&gt; as normal and good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In light of last week&#39;s discussion about the interaction at Wendy&#39;s,  <br/>
&gt; I will say that if ANY human being kicks me, I&#39;m going to respond  <br/>
&gt; negatively.  If a child comes up and kicks me I&#39;m not going to smile  <br/>
&gt; and say &quot;Oooh, hi.  Where&#39;s your mom?&quot;  I would most likely take the  <br/>
&gt; child strongly by the arm, establish eye contact and say &quot;Don&#39;t ever  <br/>
&gt; kick me again,&quot; and I would mean it.  I would say &quot;Don&#39;t kick  <br/>
&gt; people.  It&#39;s not okay.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where did anyone get the idea that it was respectful to allow (or  <br/>
&gt; require, or approve) kicking in the shins?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is anyone *REALLY* using unschooling as an excuse to encourage  <br/>
&gt; horrible behavior?  Treating children like people involves helping  <br/>
&gt; them understand how to act as people are expected to act.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-487759940">I agree with everything Sandra is writes here.<br/>
  I think what happens is that people don&#39;t really get it and just leave their kids to fend for themselves. They unparent. I saw that at L and L last year. The kids who where behaving without respect for others or property were all alone. Even Little kids as young as 5.<br/>
   A couple of kids between the ages of 4 and 7 came over to my dd that was 19 months at the time and poked  her right in the eye. It was right in front of me and it took me by surprise. The parents were nowhere to be found. If your children are not able to be in public alone then don&#39;t let them!<br/>
  I don&#39;t let my kids destroyed other people&#39;s property or hurt other people. I am there with them because they are young and need me to guide them. You just don;t leave  until they are capable of understanding..<br/>

Holly and I have discussed this quite a bit, and discussed it last <br/>

Sometimes what I see are the parents behaving the way they behave in <br/>

At conferences where the kids are going to stay up late or whatever, <br/>
you can just about pick out the ones whose parents don&#39;t usually give <br/>

conference. They exaggerate their actions and their freedom. <br/>
There&#39;s a dishonesty about it all, and they don&#39;t act as calmly and <br/>
rationally as those kids who are used to acting the same way when <br/>
their parents aren&#39;t there as when they are. I&#39;m talking about <br/>
teens now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never said unschooling was easy. I&#39;ve never stopped trying, <br/>
daily, to help people understand it. Because some people think I&#39;m <br/>
abrasive (those who haven&#39;t heard me speak or don&#39;t know me, who <br/>
don&#39;t know my tone of voice), the UnschoolingBasics list was created <br/>
partly for a place for people to go who thought they wanted to know <br/>
about unschooling but wanted to be where I wasn&#39;t, and partly with <br/>
the intent that that would be for beginning info and <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion would be for more advanced info. People aren&#39;t <br/>
being sent over, though, for the same reasons most of us discovered <br/>
long ago--it&#39;s good for those who get it to stay and help others get <br/>
it. So that plan didn&#39;t really turn out as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Another couple of lists grew out of the Unschooling Discussion list <br/>
too, as more specialized lists, with the assumption that people would <br/>
be on both. AlwaysUnschooled and Shine with Unschooling. Now <br/>
neither seems like a specialized list anymore. So with five or six <br/>
lists where there used to be the AOL boards and then <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion, advice doesn&#39;t have the same cohesion it once <br/>
did, and some odd ideas are treated less odd on one list than on <br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s best to be around unschoolers whose kids are older, who <br/>
have unschooled a long time, than around families whose kids are all <br/>
young, if people want to gain faith in unschooling as a longterm <br/>
philosophy and practice. It is possible--I&#39;m guessing somewhat--that <br/>
lists with more young children have fostered misunderstandings about <br/>
*how* older unschoolers got to the point of trusting their children&#39;s <br/>
judgment.<br/>
<br/>
I will say this for now: It was NOT from being kept up all night by <br/>
kids who hit and kick them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60374840">-=-I was just explaining why I asked for resources of help with my 2yo<br/>
specifically.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But the principles of seeing what they&#39;re interested in, making them  <br/>
comfortable, being gentle with them, helping them understand the  <br/>
world--all of that--those are the same for two year olds or forty  <br/>
year olds.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that those with young children know more about having young  <br/>
children and the eventual outcomes than those who have teenagers is a  <br/>
false belief.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had three two year olds who are now well-adjusted young adults.  <br/>
(16, 19, 21)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s likely I know more about what will help you in the long run than  <br/>
someone who has a two year old who hasn&#39;t turned three, or a five  <br/>
year old who used to be two and whose relatives are saying &quot;Why isn&#39;t  <br/>
he in school?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s DEFINITE that Pam or Joyce will have better ideas about how to  <br/>
be with two year olds, eve though their girls are teens, than someone  <br/>
who has a six year old who kicks or hits.<br/>

it??  Seriously, this has bugged me for months.... One of my biggest<br/>
parenting issues is public humiliation.  I really think that much of<br/>
conventional parenting is about avoiding humiliation rather than being<br/>
a moral or kind little human being.  I always used to joke with my<br/>
kids that I would rather their &quot;misdeeds&quot; come out at home and their<br/>
public face be their &quot;best behaviour&quot;.  I have (slowly) come to<br/>
realize that my children do not have to be a reflection of me to prove<br/>
my success as a mom.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; situations?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my experience, a child that isn&#39;t being quiet or respectful of <br/>
another persons sleep, should go to bed.  Sometimes, especially with <br/>
young children their energy level gets very unreasonable the more <br/>
tired they get.  At that point, the &quot;if&quot; isn&#39;t met, and the child <br/>
should be gently led to a quiet sleep inducing environment.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a child that will scream and protest at that, no matter how <br/>
gentle and kind that I am about it, so I understand how it could feel <br/>
as if I am doing something hugely disrespectful of her by leading her <br/>
to that sleep environment that she is protesting.  However, she is 6 <br/>
and her judgement of other people&#39;s need for quiet and sleep isn&#39;t <br/>
completely honed yet, nor is her own judgement of how tired she <br/>
actually is.<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is peace and quiet for ALL, then leading a screaming 6 yo <br/>
to a quiet and peaceful environment will benefit everyone, including <br/>
the 6 yo, who will eventually settle down and become peaceful enough <br/>
to get the sleep that she clearly needs.</div>

anyone else&#39;s *NEEDS* and consider them just that, a need (maybe even a need<br/>
I don&#39;t understand, I don&#39;t have to understand, my mommy-job includes<br/>
facilitating the meeting of the needs in my family.<br/>
<br/>
i think i should be able to say &#39;you<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a different sentence than the first one you posted... this version is<br/>
much more gentle and understanding.<br/>
Absolutely, have ^^that conversation. When I have that same discussion with<br/>
my night-owl son (now 9.5), he asks me to please be near him and I doze on<br/>
the sofa or the comfy chair until I wake up a few hours later and move to my<br/>
own bed. I *could* minimize this and treat this as a *want* - instead I<br/>
remember the honor of having a kid who wants me near and I do just that. The<br/>
alternative vision in my head is a kid who knows his mama doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>
here and he doesn&#39;t dare ask her to be... I don&#39;t wanna be that mama.<br/>
I so appreciate his request for my presence, soon enough he won&#39;t *need* me<br/>
so much anymore...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884048226">******<br/>
  Is anyone *REALLY* using unschooling as an excuse to encourage <br/>
horrible behavior? Treating children like people involves helping <br/>
them understand how to act as people are expected to act.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
  *********<br/>
   <br/>
  Unfortunately, I believe the answer is yes.<br/>
  The people doing this don&#39;t call it &#39;encouraging horrible behavior&#39; though. They consider it letting the children be themselves and express whatever emotion they&#39;re having at the time. They seem to think that any sort of behavior modification or suppression is abusive. They don&#39;t believe in saying no, ever, in any circumstances. The child is allowed to do whatever he/she wants at any time, otherwise you&#39;re interferring with their development. Most of the people I&#39;ve met that have this philosophy call themselves radical unschoolers. This of course is a generalization, but I&#39;ve met far too many people like this. <br/>
  When I do come across people like this and they try to align themselves with me as being a &#39;fellow unschooler&#39;, I quickly let them know that&#39;s not my interpretation of unschooling (and explain what unschooling is and isn&#39;t to me). Unfortunately, the kids I&#39;ve known that have grown up in that kind of environment have turned out to be rather obnoxious bullies. Rudeness, violence or disrespect to other humans has never been okay behavior in our family. Tamzin is appalled by some of the kids we&#39;ve met that claim to be radical unschoolers, and certainly doesn&#39;t want to hang out with them. We model respect in our home with ALL our family members, adults and kids alike - no one is exempt from that. <br/>

<time> 4 Mar 2008, at  2:57pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981051750">Another couple of lists grew out of the Unschooling Discussion list too, as more specialized lists, with the assumption that people would be on both. AlwaysUnschooled and Shine with Unschooling. Now neither seems like a specialized list anymore. So with five or six lists where there used to be the AOL boards and then UnschoolingDiscussi on, advice doesn&#39;t have the same cohesion it once did, and some odd ideas are treated less odd on one list than on another.<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  I&#39;m no longer active at AU, but remember that it grew out of a time when parents of kids younger than traditional school-age wanted to find support for the unschooling lifestyle (mindful or consensual parenting), only to be told that &quot;if your kids aren&#39;t yet school-age, then you&#39;re not unschooling -- it&#39;s about parenting.&quot;  So, Danielle started a group to speak to those parents of very young children who planned to unschool when their kids reached school age and wanted to be already living an unschooling life. <br/>
   <br/>
  Shine is a different list from the others, and I remain active there.  It tends to be a gentler approach for those folks who feel a need for that.  Still, no one recommends that unschooling a child is &#39;anything goes&#39; and to hell with other people&#39;s rights to be safe vs. a child&#39;s &#39;right&#39; to explore the entire world all the time. <br/>
   <br/>
  All that aside, I think it is fair to say the message has become diluted.  I&#39;m not sure how it happened, or how to return to a saner place, but I do see instances where &#39;unschooled&#39; appears to be an excuse to allow a child to be rude, unkind and abusive to others, and I have seen some instances where a child has to go far beyond the pale to get a parent&#39;s attention.  I think those are likely parents who would be absent even if their child was in school, so unschooling is no different for them.  Except that it lets them think they&#39;re giving their child some grand adventure.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
I think it&#39;s best to be around unschoolers whose kids are older, who have unschooled a long time, than around families whose kids are all young, if people want to gain faith in unschooling as a longterm philosophy and practice. It is possible--I&#39; m guessing somewhat--that lists with more young children have fostered misunderstandings about *how* older unschoolers got to the point of trusting their children&#39;s judgment.<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
I agree. It&#39;s even better if the more experienced parents find a way to present what they do as mindful parenting -- as part of an unschooling philosophy  -- in a way that doesn&#39;t result in parents of very young kids feeling they shouldn&#39;t be there, because they&#39;re not yet unschooling (since the kids are &#39;too young&#39;).<br/>
