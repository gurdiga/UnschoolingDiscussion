<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139553969"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;That&#39;s what I didn&#39;t want to do with her - make magic seem impossible!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When the kid was 3ish, he was outside playing with the neighbor&#39;s dog. <br/>
<br/>
My sister and I were talking to eachother when he came in and said.. <br/>
&#39;Aunt Kim, Thumper wants to know when the man who watches him will be <br/>
back.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t take any stock in it, but my sister said &#39;The neighbor was away <br/>
for the past 3 days&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
My son had NO prior knowlege of that (since we were visiting) and we <br/>
consider that a magic ability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also try to visualize parking spaces close to where we&#39;re going on <br/>
cold or messy days. And the magic invariably always works!<br/>

best regards to Megan&#39;s magic hunt. Have faith she&#39;ll find it!<br/>
