&lt;&lt;   Ren, Do you have the game, booster packs, or tin? Maybe all three? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The boys started out with a starter deck and have been buying boosters. They <br/>
both said they&#39;d recommend the tin to start with, it&#39;s better.<br/>
More cards and all....<br/>
They both want one for Christmas!<br/>
The Gameboy Advance game they have is &quot;Eternal Duelist Soul&quot; and Trevor LOVES <br/>
it!<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
