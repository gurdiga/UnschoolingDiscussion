 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s absolutely no question. My husband and I are both theater artists<br/>
that do a lot of work in schools. Sometimes it gets so sad, we have to take<br/>
a break. Many schools cram the arts into spare corners - &quot;spare&quot; refers to<br/>
the time they have that&#39;s not devoted to Things That Will Be on the Tests.<br/>
Even if the teachers can see how writing a play might translate into a<br/>
better score on an English test (and not all can), their administration<br/>
rarely lets them translate that into action in the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
And most schools have to choose: art or drama? music or dance? Schools that<br/>
have an arts experience once a month are rare.<br/>
