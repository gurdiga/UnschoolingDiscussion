<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076393282">Yesterday, in Austin, Kirby, our oldest, who is 24, bought a car, on  <br/>
his own, from CarMax.<br/>
<br/>
When he went to Austin three years ago, he took a two-door Chevy Grand  <br/>
Prix that he inherited when his uncle died.  It&#39;s been repaired  <br/>
twice.  He said it was not as reliable as it used to be, and later  <br/>
this month his job is moving across town to a new facility.<br/>
<br/>
For months he has looked at cars and considered what he wanted to get,  <br/>
carefully comparing prices, and the relative merits of a sedan or a  <br/>
pickup truck.  Regular cab or crew cab.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday he called me.  The papers were in progress, but he was  <br/>
driving home to get his checkbook, because he didn&#39;t know they  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t take a down payment from a debit or credit card.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t  <br/>
as prepared as I thought I was,&quot; he said, but he was kind of glad of  <br/>
the chance to talk to me and his dad before he signed the final  <br/>
papers.  I reminded him about getting it insured, and to take the  <br/>
insurance card from his old car so they would know he had insurance,  <br/>
and so he would have the phone number to call and add this car before  <br/>
he drove it away.   Keith talked to him about refinancing the loan  <br/>
through USAA rather than CarMax, and not to sign away his right to pay  <br/>
it off early without penalty.  I suggested he borrow money from us,  <br/>
pay it in full, and just owe us money instead.  But he said no, he  <br/>
wanted to establish credit and this was a good way to do it.  He put  <br/>
$5,000 down, so the payments would be lower.<br/>
<br/>
So although he was happy to have us advise him, he was also happy not  <br/>
to take financial assistance, and he drove the car away in time to go  <br/>
to dinner.<br/>
It&#39;s a 2008 Mazda 8 sedan, black, four-door, standard.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I was looking through photos for something to use for  <br/>
&quot;Just Add Light and Stir.&quot;  I don&#39;t know if I mentioned that new  <br/>
project here.  It&#39;s a daily inspirational post (or e-mail).<br/>

<br/>
In a few days, the image will be this photo of Keith and a baby-Kirby,  <br/>
probably five months old, if this was (as I think) Christmas at  <br/>
Keith&#39;s parents&#39; house.  I really like mirror photos, but I like that  <br/>
Kirby is looking at Kirby, and Keith is looking at Kirby.  And it  <br/>
seemed a good companion photo to the car-purchase of yesterday.<br/>
