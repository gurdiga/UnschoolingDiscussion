<div id="ygrps-yiv-281848593">Dear Ann,<br/>
<br/>
One of the first things you can do is replace meat with tofu.  You buy tofu <br/>
and freeze it in the package for 24 hours.  Then you let it thaw and you <br/>
sqeeze out the water from the tofu (cut in slices to do this).  Then, you can <br/>
use it just as meat and it takes in all the flavor of what you are <br/>
cooking...sloppy joes, lasagna, and on and on.  It is very good.  You can <br/>
also replace milk with soy milk and they are tons of different brands to <br/>
choice from that can be sweet for their liking, including chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

I&#39;ve got one younger ds who has been a radical vagan for years and <br/>
one ds who is a big time meat eater.  I&#39;ve become a master of <br/>
creating multi meals. (i.e. spagettii w/ and w/o meat; tuna caserole <br/>
w/tuna or w/asparagus, etc.) I learned several tips from my Jewish <br/>
Orthodox friend who keeps a kosher kitchen :) One tip is have LOTS of <br/>
pans... two small casserole dishes can cook in same time period as <br/>
one large, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506270124">I refuse to cook seperate meals for everyone.<br/>
Right now I cook, if DH and DS eat, great, if not then DH can fix himself<br/>
something after putting DS to bed (we eat late because he doesn&#39;t get home<br/>
from work until 8pm, and I don;t want DS to pick up on the habit of not<br/>
eating what has been made for him).  If DS doesn&#39;t like it then he can have<br/>
more of what he does like (I always make sure part of it is a favorite, as<br/>
long as its still nutritious).  But he&#39;s getting good at just eating what I<br/>
make because he doesn&#39;t like being hungry, and after several attempts he<br/>
ends up liking the stuff.  Of course, he&#39;s not quite 3 yet and we&#39;ve been<br/>
very careful with what he eats so far so he&#39;s pretty good about what he<br/>
likes.<br/>
We&#39;re trying to increase the amount of raw foods in our diet, right now<br/>
we&#39;re at about 25% raw foods.  We probably won&#39;t ever go completely<br/>
vegetarian, but we eat little meat, but we try to get in a lot of protein<br/>
and not so much of the filler carbs (potatos, rice, breads, etc) though we<br/>
still eat some ... we&#39;ve noticed marked difference in our energy levels and<br/>
DS&#39;s behavior.  Now that we&#39;re in the middle of moving I haven&#39;t been able<br/>
to do much cooking or anything and our diet, well, sucks :)  And I&#39;ve<br/>
already gained back weight I had lost and am back to feeling sluggish and my<br/>
skin problems are getting worse (acne & severe dry skin).  Diet does a lot<br/>
for you, that is for sure!<br/>
