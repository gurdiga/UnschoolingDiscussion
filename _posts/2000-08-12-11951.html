<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108652634">I have to say that rats are far superior pets to hamsters or gerbils. <br/>
They are intelligent, loving, and lots of fun.  They can learn some<br/>
tricks and enjoy human companionship.  they rarely bite.  Don&#39;t let the<br/>
tail bother you.  It is somewhat prehensile and a heating/cooling<br/>
conduit.  Rats suffer a bad rap and will never recover from the whole<br/>
bubonic thing.  Wild rats and domestic rats are 2 very different<br/>
critters.  They have been domesticated for 100 years.  I would compare<br/>
domestic rats to tiny little dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, did I mention I have a pet rat rescue/refuge for discarded pet rats<br/>
(g).  They are such wonderful creatures.  Definitely should not be snake<br/>
food.  Setting them, or any other domestic small animal, free is a<br/>
certain death sentence.  They are not wild animals and would be easy prey<br/>
for even their own wild relatives.<br/>

<div><strong>Hi Shelley,</strong></div>
<div><strong>That was one thing I was wondering about.&nbsp; Actually I was 
wondering if the pet rats ever got hantavirus or the newly discovered Arena 
virus?&nbsp; And if they could catch it somehow from the wild rats.&nbsp; We 
live in a rural neighborhood with plenty of rats and mice, and we have received 
warnings from the government about the hantavirus and the Arena virus.&nbsp; And 
although we take all the precautions, I wonder if we got a pet rat if it could 
catch the above mentioned virus?</strong></div>
<div><strong>TIA</strong></div>
