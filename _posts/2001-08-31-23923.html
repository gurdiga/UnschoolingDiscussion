Susan has very amazing daughters.  Please tell us what they&#39;re doing if <br/>
you&#39;re willing and have the energy.  There are people here could use the <br/>
inspiration of some musical, artistic, imaginative, goodhearted homeschooled <br/>
teens!<br/>
<br/>
(I met Susan when my husband was working in Minneapolis for six months... a <br/>
year...  a year and a half... two years.  We got to see each other a few <br/>
times.  It was wonderful to see her girls getting older.  And they visited <br/>
Albuquerque once.)<br/>

  My son 17 is working as an apprentice doing dry wall with my friends husband. He says he would rather do that than go to college. So we did not force him to go and take the music classes he had previously chosen. I know he likes music more than doing dry wall we have talked about that in the past. I am worried he will give up his music and be a dry waller just because he is afraid to go to school! I wonder sometimes how to get them out of their comfort zone and try something new and challenging!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But he&#39;s doing something real, and learning drywalling (and other <br/>
construction stuff, no doubt) without having to pay for the privilege!  Where <br/>
are most of the other 17 year olds?  <br/>
<br/>
Why would having a daytime job hinder music?  There are LOTS more hours in <br/>
the week than 40.<br/>
<br/>
I figure if Kirby&#39;s job becomes full time and he gets complacent in a <br/>
low-paying job, he would either get tired of it, or get a girlfriend he <br/>
wanted to impress and that would be a real biological reason for him to work <br/>
to advance himself financially.<br/>

learning that being a dry waller isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be!) -- unlike <br/>
my going to college when it was the &quot;right&quot; time and completely blowing it!  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll start his own construction biz.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll do something completely different.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll change his mind several times.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll find a way to pursue his music without going to school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670854843">Kasie, I gently refer you to your own signature line. Maybe some time away<br/>
will help him see if music is really what he wants to do? There is no law<br/>
that says he can&#39;t start a year later if he changes his mind.<br/>

ready to go, I enjoyed it, applied myself, and finished with a great GPA<br/>
