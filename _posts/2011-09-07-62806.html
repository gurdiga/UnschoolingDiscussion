<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347082432">Someone asked me for a story and it&#39;s not ringing a bell.<br/>
Just because I&#39;m not thinking of it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not on my site, or in the archives of this list, though, or that one of you might remember what it might be.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a story somewhere about a mom helping an older child or teen with his shoes?  Or tying his shoes?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&lt;I tie / untie his boots for him when he asks me to - I could say &quot;no&quot; because he is almost 17 and should tie / untie his own boots - but it is a connecting moment. We chatter about the event to come or about some other thing in our lives or watch a You Tube video he wants to show me if I&#39;m tying or we talk about how the event went if I&#39;m untying.&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-677508610">It is related to playing airsoft.  Which is military reenactment.  It was in reference to how I can support him and connect with him in his interest and be totally there for him and yet not actually play airsoft.  This is in addition to helping him tie his shoes.  He can tie his shoes but when he asks me to please tie / untie them for him I could be snide and say that at 17 he can do it himself and totally miss the opportunity to connect with him.  It&#39;s the connection of service as well as chatting about a common interest / event / something he LOVES!<br/>
<br/>
My dad used to come in from the fields and we kids would help him take off his work boots (not unlike the combat boots Zac wears) and obviously he could do his own boots if he wanted to - it was a connecting moment for us.<br/>

I&#39;ve helped people get their medieval boots off--Keith, Marty.  When I was pregnant and my ankles would swell, sometimes I&#39;d get help.  Then Keith won a tournament, and the prize was a pair of hand-made boots by a very well known bootmaker at the time, from Kansas.  Keith gave me the prize, and I told Richard I wanted pregnancy boots.  Low boots that were very adjustable, for swollen ankles.   He designed me something and I still have them 22 years later. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My kids have helped me, and I&#39;ve helped them, Keith and I, too...<br/>
