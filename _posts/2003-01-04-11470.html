<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538843958">&lt;&lt; Presented as an option to tofu, LOTS of people might like Spam better! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ugh, not ME!! I love tofu, but then, I know how to cook it so it actually  <br/>
tastes good. :)<br/>

Please, please share, Ren!  I am desperately trying to add tofu and other soy products to our family diet, but<br/>
 it&#39;s just not going over well. :(  <br/>
Do you have recipes, or techniques, or helpful websites?<br/>

<br/>
Namaste,<br/>

Oh, no!  Peggy will have to post tofu Haiku.  Toku?<br/>
<br/>
Two tofu sandwiches my son likes.<br/>
<br/>
Start with firm tofu, rinsed, sliced and set on towels to drain.<br/>
Make a breading from cracker crumbs and a little nutritional yeast and<br/>
lemon pepper seasoning, some garlic powder if you like.   Rub the tofu<br/>
with olive oil and dip in the breading.   Broil until the breading is<br/>
browning and getting crispy, turning once.<br/>
Serve on a toasted bun with tartar sauce, tomato, lettuce, onion, what<br/>
ever.<br/>
<br/>
The other one starts with firm rinsed, thinly sliced and drained tofu.  <br/>
Spread the tofu slices with prepared mustard on both sides (French&#39;s or<br/>
whatever)  and sprinkle with nutritional yeast.   Cook in a little olive<br/>
oil on both sides until browning.  Serve on bread or toast like a fried<br/>
egg sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
Baked  marinated tofu makes good sandwiches too or a good addition to<br/>
stir fry.<br/>
Dylan likes tofu with Osaka sauce and brown rice.  That&#39;s a mustardy kind<br/>
of sauce, he&#39;s a mustard kid.  My husband likes these recipes too.  <br/>
We also use tofu crumbled and seasoned a little, like ricotta cheese in<br/>
manicotti and lasagna.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Deb L<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay.  There goes my appetite!  (G)<br/>
<br/>
But, I am a vegan and tofu is a staple food in this house.  My son loves <br/>
tofu uncooked, just cut up in small cubes that he can snack on while he&#39;s <br/>
doing something.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a GREAT recipe using tofu that will really surprise you:<br/>
<br/>
This is a Tofu Unchicken Salad:<br/>
<br/>
2 pounds (blocks) of fresh tofu, frozen solid<br/>
chopped fresh parsley to taste<br/>
2 stalks of fresh celery<br/>
1 chopped onion<br/>
1 chopped carrot<br/>
seasonings to taste:  tamari or Bragg&#39;s Liquid Aminos, garlic, celery seed<br/>
1 cup of eggless mayo (Nasoya makes an EXCELLENT one called Nayonnaise)<br/>
<br/>
1.  Boil the frozen tofu in a big pot with water to cover until the tofu is <br/>
thawed (you can stick a fork thru it).<br/>
<br/>
2.  Remove the tofu from the boiling water and let it cool down. (I like to <br/>
encourage it by running cold water over it &#39;cause I&#39;m an impatient thing).<br/>
<br/>
3.  Squeeze out as much of the excess water as you can and then tear the <br/>
tofu into little bite-size pieces.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Put the tofu pieces in a mixing bowl (did you ever see a mixing bowl?) <br/>
with the rest of the ingredients and mix well to coat the tofu pieces.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Refrigerate.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, you can use any additional seasonings and veggies that you <br/>
normally like to use with chicken or tuna salad.  I&#39;ve added dill weed and <br/>
mustard and caraway seeds and apple cider vinegar.<br/>
<br/>
Also, try a google search on Tofu recipes.  You&#39;re sure to come up with <br/>
lots of  &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
Well, bon appetite!<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; My favorite tofu dessert involves blending a package of extra firm tofu <br/>
with <br/>
6 oz. of melted chocolate chips!  Tofu will really never be the same again if <br/>
you try that!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In a conversation once which ended &quot;Everything&#39;s better with chocolate <br/>
chips,&quot; a co-worker said, &quot;Not corn bread.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The next day I brought in chocolate chip cornbread.  It was pretty AND it <br/>
tasted GREAT!<br/>
<br/>
Once when my kids were little I was making bread pudding, and reached for <br/>
raisins and accidently grabbed chocolate chips and dumped them in.  OOOPS!  <br/>
But it was really, truly good, and so chocolate chip bread pudding has become <br/>
a winter standard here.  <br/>
