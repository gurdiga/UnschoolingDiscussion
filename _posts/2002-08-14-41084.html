&lt;&lt; Yes, Jesus did say that He was THE way, THE truth, and THE life, and <br/>
 that no one comes to the Father except through Him.  I do believe <br/>
 that to be true.  Just like I believe that unschooling is THE way to <br/>
 educate a child.  I do believe in absolute rights and wrongs.  But <br/>
 it&#39;s also true that in Christ, there is so much more freedom, so much <br/>
 more individuality, so much more love.  It&#39;s so hard to see the true <br/>
 picture of Christianity, as Christ intended, without seeing the stuff <br/>
 that the institutional church has added to the picture.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like how you put that Sheila.<br/>
As a non-religous, anti-church follower of Christ, it&#39;s hard to fit in.<br/>
I feel that I try to be Christian (in the true sense, not religion wise), but <br/>
I don&#39;t agree with about 90% of the Christian rhetoric out there. Mainly <br/>
because it is mind control, money, power driven rules.<br/>
Every church thinks they are IT. I don&#39;t like the fear mongering, I don&#39;t <br/>
like the collections, I don&#39;t like the shunning, be it open or subtle of <br/>
other religions or beliefs.<br/>
So I am more a follower of Christ than a Christian I suppose.<br/>
But I like the way you put that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404876763">Why not try the Bible? The first four books of the New Testament are all<br/>
about him. I think they give the best insight into who he is, and when you<br/>
read them you realize how little the church as we know it has to do with<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Although not directly about Jesus, The Chronicles of Narnia are a beautiful<br/>
picture of God and Jesus. They are some of our favourite stories, maybe your<br/>
daughter would enjoy them.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My daughter (4 yo in April) has for the last year shown a great<br/>
&gt; interest in Jesus, even though I am not Christian and don&#39;t go to<br/>
&gt; church!  The little that I had around the house from my own catholic<br/>
&gt; upbringing (funeral cards from my grandfather&#39;s funeral, and a picture<br/>
&gt; book Children&#39;s Bible), she would ask me about and she was riveted by<br/>
&gt; the crucifixion of Jesus story and play-acted being on a cross for months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She walked up to me last month and said that she wanted to keep the<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s bible &quot;forever&quot; and that she &quot;wanted to learn more about<br/>
&gt; Jesus&quot;!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wondering if you all have any advice on how to handle this?  I<br/>
&gt; personally want nothing to do with the church, although i suppose<br/>
&gt; Jesus and the church often don&#39;t have a lot to do with eachother!  I<br/>
&gt; am happy to support her in her desire to learn more about Jesus, any<br/>
&gt; good ideas of what she might like?<br/>
&gt; This is one of the reasons I am here, on this list, is because my<br/>
&gt; daughter obviously has her own ideas of what she needs to learn about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; No, I don&#39;t feel church and Jesus have to go hand in hand. I<br/>
 personally feel more in touch with Jesus now, then when I was<br/>
 Christian. I feel an equal fondness with many of the &quot;teachers&quot; of<br/>
 the great religions.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep. Same here.<br/>
I like Unity that way...because they don&#39;t teach a church doctrine. Their <br/>
underlying belief system is very open and brings in a lot of other spiritual <br/>
leaders like Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer etc...even though it is based on Jesus.<br/>
And they carry books on Buddhism, Suffism etc...in their bookstore. It&#39;s a <br/>
totally different type of Christian church, if a child decides they really <br/>
want to pursue Jesus in a church setting.<br/>
I thought I would never, ever do church again until I found Unity. <br/>
Most mainstream Christian churches shun any of the new thought churches as <br/>
&quot;theological cults&quot; because they don&#39;t follow the Bible. <br/>
Which of course piqued my interest in the whole concept!!  Bible literalists <br/>
usually scare me.<br/>

<br/>
If you have Baptist neighbors they would probably be thrilled to take her to <br/>
church with them.  The downside is she would start getting on you after a <br/>
while to go, and she might have nightmares and other frights about your going <br/>
to hell.    So if she REALLY wants to learn religion, a Bible-teaching church <br/>
would get her lots and early.<br/>
<br/>
But you were Catholic, so maybe go to a Catholic supply store and ask them <br/>
about kids&#39; story books, and picture books.  Maybe that would be enough for <br/>
her?<br/>
<br/>
If you want to read to her from the Bible,  the second chapter of Luke has a <br/>
little bit about Jesus as a child.<br/>
<br/>
Holly, who is 11, considers herself an atheist, but has always been <br/>
fascinated by Jesus.  In Holly&#39;s case, she&#39;s happy with Christmas stories, <br/>
watching Jesus Christ Superstar (she could discuss the relative merits of the <br/>
music and presentation of the 70&#39;s video and the recent one with anyone), <br/>
she&#39;s seen Ben Hur (which has Jesus in the background and as a large force, <br/>
if not large character).   She&#39;s seen The Life of Brian.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading to her from an old storybook for children, from the 1920s or so <br/>
(maybe earlier on the writing of this one part) and it was telling the story <br/>
of Jesus as a child, staying behind in the temple.  The author decided to <br/>
throw in that Jesus had to go to school &quot;just like you do&quot; and that was <br/>
especially funny since Jesus did NOT go to school and neither did Holly.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat live, Holly wanted <br/>
the video, and wanted me to read her the real story from the Bible.  She&#39;s <br/>
also really familiar with Joseph, King of Dreams which is closer to the Bible <br/>
(but songs aren&#39;t as good &lt;g&gt;) and she can compare/contrast and discuss all <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I sing a hymn to Holly, if it seems to tie in with something, and <br/>
give her a little tidbit of Christian belief that way.  The other day we were <br/>
in Hobby Lobby and there was an instrumental on the muzak of &quot;Trust and <br/>
Obey,&quot; which has a really pretty tune.  I started singing the words.  She was <br/>
interested, but also wanted me to hush.  I think she was afraid I was making <br/>
fun of their Christian store, but I was singing the exact right words!  <br/>
&quot;Trust and obey, for there&#39;s no other way to be happy with Jesus but to trust <br/>
and obey.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m a fairly good resource for Holly and I&#39;ve found she&#39;s happy with an <br/>
added bit of info every few weeks or as it arises naturally one way or <br/>
another (about Jesus or anything else).<br/>

most the time they are wrong, LOL <br/>
My kids are un-sunday schooled as well. If they want to go, great, if not, <br/>
they don&#39;t. The oldest enjoys it most of the time. The little ones don&#39;t. I <br/>
have had lapses in my attendance, but i go because I enjoy it. I don&#39;t like a <br/>
lot of the religious intolerance I see in the world. I don&#39;t like when well <br/>
meaning churchy people ruin for the down to earth ones. I don&#39;t like the <br/>
mockery of Christians that result. I do things with my Christianity because I <br/>
am led to and I enjoy it. I don&#39;t spend time trying to convert others, i <br/>
believe my witness is most effective by my example, the way I lead my life. I <br/>
hope I am on the right track, and not pushing others away. I truly believe <br/>
that the spirit moves people to a relationship with Jesus, not what humans do <br/>
to interfere. How else could someone so religiously cynical as my former self <br/>
had found Jesus?  Nothing short of a miracle :0)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060461193">&quot;What makes one belief system a cult? How do we determine cult vs. valid <br/>
belief system?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, here is a really good overview of the term cult. WARNING: Long post, <br/>
skip if you aren&#39;t interested.  It annoys me to call Mithraism a cult...I <br/>
think that&#39;s more of a Christian thing to label it as such. I prefer to call <br/>
it a religion.<br/>
The church I was raised in fits a LOT of the definitions you&#39;ll see towards <br/>
the end of this post. THAT is cultish to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There has been much confusion about cults and how to &#39;pickem&#39;.<br/>
Some have difficulty identifying a cult because it is not so easy to identify <br/>
one that is not even religious. For this reason, over the years, different <br/>
definitions of what actually is a cult have developed to make it easier when <br/>
you know little about their beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
The different definitions:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SECULAR DEFINITION<br/>
CULT - From the Latin &quot;cultis&quot; which denotes all that is involved in worship, <br/>
ritual, emotion, liturgy and attitude. This definition actually denotes what <br/>
we call denominations and sects and would make all religious movements a <br/>
cult. <br/>
<br/>
CHRISTIAN DEFINITION<br/>
CULT - Any group which deviates from Biblical, orthodox, historical <br/>
Christianity. e.i. They deny the Deity of Christ; His physical resurrection; <br/>
His personal and physical return to earth and salvation by FAITH alone. <br/>
<br/>
This definition only covers those groups which are cults within the Christian <br/>
religion. It does not cover cults within other world religions such as Islam <br/>
and Hinduism. Nor does it cover Psychological, Commercial or Educational <br/>
cults which do not recognize the Bible as a source of reality. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
UNIVERSAL DEFINITION<br/>
CULT - Any group which has a pyramid type authoritarian leadership structure <br/>
with all teaching and guidance coming from the person/persons at the top. The <br/>
group will claim to be the only way to God; Nirvana; Paradise; Ultimate <br/>
Reality; Full Potential, Way to Happiness etc, and will use thought reform or <br/>
mind control techniques to gain control and keep their members. This <br/>
definition covers cults within all majopr world religions, along with those <br/>
cults which have no OBVIOUS religious base such as commercial, educational <br/>
and psychological cults. Others may define these a little differently, but <br/>
this is the simplest to work from. THE &#39;ORTHODOX BIBLE-BASED CULT&#39; <br/>
<br/>
A group is called a cult because of their behaviour - not their doctrines. <br/>
Doctrine is an issue in the area of Apologetics and Heresy. Most religious <br/>
cults do teach what the Christian church would declare to be heresy but some <br/>
do not. Some cults teach the basics of the Christian faith but have <br/>
behavioural patterns that are abusive, controlling and cultic. <br/>
<br/>
This occurs in both Non-Charismatic and Charismatic churches. These groups <br/>
teach the central doctrines of the Christian faith and then add the extra <br/>
authority of leadership or someone&#39;s particular writings. They centre around <br/>
the interpretations of the leadership and submissive and unquestioning <br/>
acceptance of these is essential to be a member of good standing. This <br/>
acceptance includes what we consider non-essential doctrines e.i. not <br/>
salvation issues (such as the Person and Work of Christ.) The key is that <br/>
they will be using mind control or undue influence on their members. <br/>
<br/>
An excellent book on this subject is &quot;Churches that Abuse&quot; by Dr Ronald <br/>
Enroth. <br/>
<br/>
Using these guidelines of definition, Bible-based, Psychological, Educational <br/>
and Commercial aberrations can easily be identified. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OTHER IDENTIFICATION MARKS<br/>
(a) The group will have an ELITIST view of itself in relation to others, and <br/>
a UNIQUE CAUSE. e.i. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES RIGHT - everyone else is wrong. <br/>
THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES DOING GOD&#39;S WILL - everyone else is in apostasy. <br/>
<br/>
(b) They will promote their cause actively, and in doing so, abuse God-given <br/>
personal rights and freedoms. This abuse can be THEOLOGICAL, SPIRITUAL, <br/>
SOCIAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HOW THEY DO THIS<br/>
<br/>
Their leader/s may claim a special, exclusive ministry, revelation or <br/>
position of authority given by God. <br/>
<br/>
They believe they are the only true church and take a critical stance <br/>
regarding the Christian church while at the same time praising and exalting <br/>
their own group, leader/s and work. <br/>
<br/>
They use intimidation or psychological manipulation to keep members loyal to <br/>
their ranks. This could be in the form of threats of dire calamity sent by <br/>
God if they leave; certain death at Armageddon; being shunned by their family <br/>
and friends etc. This is a vital part of the mind control process. <br/>
<br/>
Members will be expected to give substantial financial support to the group. <br/>
This could be compulsory tithing (which is checked); signing over all their <br/>
property on entering the group; coercive methods of instilling guilt on those <br/>
who have not contributed; selling magazines, flowers or other goods for the <br/>
group as part of their &quot;ministry&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time bible-based cults may ridicule churches that take up <br/>
free-will offerings by passing collection plates and/or sell literature and <br/>
tapes. They usually brag that they don&#39;t do this. This gives outsiders the <br/>
intimation that they are not interested in money. <br/>
<br/>
There will be great emphasis on loyalty to the group and its teachings. The <br/>
lives of members will be totally absorbed into the group&#39;s activities. They <br/>
will have little or no time to think for themselves because of physical and <br/>
emotional exhaustion. This is also a vital part of the mind control process. <br/>
<br/>
There will be total control over almost all aspects of the private lives of <br/>
members. This control can be direct through communal living, or constant and <br/>
repetitious teaching on &quot;how to be a true Christian&quot; or &quot;being obedient to <br/>
leadership&quot;. Members will look to their leaders for guidance in everything <br/>
they do. <br/>
<br/>
Bible-based cults may proclaim they have no clergy/laity distinction and no <br/>
paid ministry class - that they are all equal. <br/>
<br/>
Any dissent or questioning of the group&#39;s teachings is discouraged. Criticism <br/>
in any form is seen as rebellion. There will be an emphasis on authority, <br/>
unquestioning obedience and submission. This is vigilantly maintained. <br/>
<br/>
Members are required to demonstrate their loyalty to the group in some way. <br/>
This could be in the form of &quot;dobbing&quot; on fellow members (including family) <br/>
under the guise of looking out for &quot;spiritual welfare&quot;. <br/>
They may be required to deliberately lie (heavenly deception/theocratic <br/>
strategy) or give up their lives by refusing some form of medical treatment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Attempts to leave or reveal embarrassing facts about the group may be met <br/>
with threats. Some may have taken oaths of loyalty that involve their lives <br/>
or have signed a &quot;covenant&quot; and feel threatened by this. <br/>
Refugees of the group are usually faced with confrontations by other members <br/>
with coercion to get them to return to the group. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SOME ABUSES OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS:-<br/>
1. ABUSE OF INDIVIDUALITY They adopt a &quot;groupness&quot; mentality. They are not <br/>
permitted to think for themselves apart from the group and only accept what <br/>
they are told. <br/>
<br/>
2. ABUSE OF INTIMACY Relationships with friends, relatives, spouses, <br/>
children, parents etc are broken or seriously hampered. <br/>
<br/>
3. ABUSE OF FINANCES Pressure to give all you can to the group. In <br/>
non-communal groups, members usually live at the lower socio-economic strata, <br/>
not because of a lower income level, but because they are always giving money <br/>
to the group for some reason. <br/>
<br/>
4. &quot;US VERSUS THEM&quot; MENTALITY Isolation from the community in general. Anyone <br/>
and everything outside the group is seen as &quot;of the devil&quot; or &quot;unenlightened&quot; <br/>
etc. Their enemies now include former friends; the Christian church; <br/>
governments; education systems; the media - the world in general. Those who <br/>
are involved with these in any way see such involvement as a &quot;means to an <br/>
end&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
5. ABUSE OF TIME AND ENERGY The group controls and uses almost all the <br/>
members time and energy in group activities. They are usually in a constant <br/>
state of mental and physical exhaustion. <br/>
<br/>
6. ABUSE OF FREE WILL They must unquestioning submit to the groups teachings <br/>
and directions and their own free will is broken. Their &quot;will&quot; actually <br/>
becomes the groups &quot;will&quot; without their realizing it. This is done either by <br/>
coercive methods including low protein diets and lack of sleep, or over a <br/>
period of time through intimidation. Both methods make heavy use of &quot;guilt&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
RESULTS OF THIS ABUSE <br/>
PERSONALITY CHANGES <br/>
Relatives will say they no longer recognize the person. From a warm, loving <br/>
personality will come heaped abuse, rejection and feelings of hate. The cult <br/>
member sees himself as &quot;righteous&quot; in comparison and this comes across in <br/>
their attitude toward all outsiders. <br/>
<br/>
LOSS OF IDENTITY <br/>
They cannot see themselves as individuals apart from the group. Some even <br/>
change their name as a rejection of their former life. <br/>
<br/>
PARANOID - WE ARE BEING PERSECUTED <br/>
Any time you say anything negative about the group, whether justified or no, <br/>
it is regarded as &quot;persecution&quot;. Any criticism of the individual is also seen <br/>
as persecution only because they are the &quot;true Christian&quot; or &quot;enlightened&quot; <br/>
one - not because they, as an individual, have done the wrong thing. However, <br/>
at the same time they will feel free to criticise whatever you believe, say <br/>
and do because they are &quot;the only ones who are right&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
SOCIAL DISORIENTATION <br/>
They lose their ability to socialize outside the group. This can go so far as <br/>
to not being able to structure their time or make simple decisions for <br/>
themselves when they leave. <br/>
Their world-view alters and they perceive the world through their leaders <br/>
eyes. They become very naive about life in general. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SEVERE GUILT COMPLEXES <br/>
They are made to feel guilty of everything they did before entering the group <br/>
and are to strive to be &quot;good&quot; and &quot;worthy&quot; for &quot;eternal life&quot;. Misdemeanors <br/>
are made into &quot;mountains&quot; so that members are in a constant state of guilt <br/>
for infringing even the most minor rules. Guilt comes because they aren&#39;t <br/>
doing enough; entertaining doubts or questions; even thinking rationally for <br/>
oneself. <br/>
This guilt is piled upon pile with new rules constantly being laid down about <br/>
what is sinful and what is not. Illness may be seen as lack of faith - more <br/>
guilt. Emotional illness may be seen as proof of sin in your life - more <br/>
guilt. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SUMMARY<br/>
Not all these points will be found in every cult, but all cults will have <br/>
some if not most of them, although these may vary to some degree. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718240239">Thanks for clearing that up. I don&#39;t think we understood from what stance you were speaking from.<br/>
 I do however disagree and believe history shows that Christianity had a lot to do with the downfall of Mithraism. For example we know one of the largest Mithraic temples built in Italy, is under the present day Church of St. Clemente, in Rome near the Colosseum.<br/>
Christianity being so similar to Mithraism as well as adopting so many of the same features of it&#39;s rival religions, not to mention being the sanctioned religion of the state,  I don&#39;t feel it is a leap of faith to say that it did indeed have a pretty big cause and effect on other religions.<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure there was quite so much of the, &quot;get baptized or die&quot; during this time {though undoubtedly there was some of that going on, due to documented evidence } as much as the sly switcharoo by the state, along with the destruction of the old and rebuilding of the new  and &quot;approved&quot;.<br/>
Maybe it is better for us to agree to disagree. :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The term &quot;mystery&quot; in mystery cult or mystery religion refers to<br/>
something that cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced.<br/>
Mystery religions had initiation ceremonies that involved being part of<br/>
an elaborate play that imparted a religious feeling.  I think of it as<br/>
the feeling Christians have when they see a passion play.  The beliefs<br/>
of the religion aren&#39;t secret, but the &quot;mysteries&quot; can only be felt, not<br/>
spoken.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965005859"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;The term &quot;mystery&quot; in mystery cult or mystery religion refers to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>something that cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced.<br/>
Mystery religions had initiation ceremonies that involved being part of<br/>
an elaborate play that imparted a religious feeling.  I think of it as<br/>
the feeling Christians have when they see a passion play.  The beliefs<br/>
of the religion aren&#39;t secret, but the &quot;mysteries&quot; can only be felt, not<br/>
spoken.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So then why is one religion called a mystery, but not others? Don&#39;t they all <br/>
have some aspect that needs to be experienced? In your examples above, I <br/>
would then think of Mormons as a mystery religion as they have many secret <br/>
initiations and ceremonies. But I&#39;ve never heard that term used. And would <br/>
the passion play experience qualify Christianity as a mystery? Or is this <br/>
just a term used for past religions/cults?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sort of, yes.  But &quot;revealed&quot; religions like Islam and Christianity say that<br/>
it&#39;s all right there in the Bible/Koran and you just need to believe it.  A<br/>
mystery religion involves a certain level of personal involvment in the<br/>
mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Catholicism is Christian cult (in it&#39;s technical sense) which has mystery<br/>
aspects--mass, passion plays.  But Wicca is a mystery religion--all of its<br/>
ritual includes the participants being active parts of the &quot;change&quot; that<br/>
goes on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417276458">I will try to explain this as well as I can from my limited knowledge.<br/>
I&#39;ve been passionately interested in religion for over ten years and<br/>
done a lot of reading, but much of my reading has been &quot;popular&quot; books<br/>
rather than &quot;scholarly&quot; books.  So this is my understanding, and I might<br/>
have no idea what I&#39;m talking about.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
In mystery religions, people were sworn to secrecy about what happened<br/>
in their initiations.  The beliefs weren&#39;t necessarily secret, and the<br/>
names of the god/desses worshiped weren&#39;t usually secret, but the<br/>
ceremony itself was secret because talking about it would dilute the<br/>
experience.  The Christian passion play imparts the religious feelings<br/>
(and there&#39;s a book called The Jesus Mysteries which claims Christianity<br/>
was originally a mystery religion).  But since I can tell you that Judas<br/>
betrayed him and he was executed on a cross and rose from the dead, it&#39;s<br/>
not a mystery.  <br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s much discussion in the Wiccan community about whether Wicca is<br/>
still a mystery religion.  It was designed as one, but in the interest<br/>
of trying to prove they don&#39;t eat babies or sacrifice cats, Wiccan<br/>
authors have published their initiation rituals.  So you could read a<br/>
&quot;typical&quot; initiation before actually being initiated, which would dilute<br/>
the mystery.  Kind of how a fire drill fails to instill the same feeling<br/>
when you know you&#39;re having one that day, I guess.<br/>
 <br/>
The Eleusinian mysteries were enacted each year and we know it has<br/>
something to do with the goddesses Demeter and Persephone.  But no one<br/>
knows what actually occurred.  <br/>
 <br/>
If someone knows more about this than I do, I&#39;d love to understand it<br/>
better.<br/>

<br/>
I know personally that this is especially true in many of the Afro-Caribbean religions (Lukumi, Palo, Voodun) The secrecy is also because there is a certain learning and understanding process that initiates need to go through. The secrecy also comes from the historical experience of persecution where people pretending to be wanna be initaites would really just end up exploiting and misrepresenting the religion not to mention the fact that for centuries people were not allowed to practice their own religion. <br/>

<br/>
There is much discussion now as to is this should be happening in the Afro-Carribbean religious traditions as well. Some people say that some of the secrets should be revealed so that the practices can be more acceptable and so that the sterotypes can be gotten rid of. <br/>
