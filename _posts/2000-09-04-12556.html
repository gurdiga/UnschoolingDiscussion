<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Corallyn,<br/>
<br/>
I empathize with you and what you endured as a child and teenager.<br/>
<br/>
When I was about seven years old, one Sunday morning I got out of bed, went<br/>
to my aunt&#39;s room and took a handful of change from her bedside table. I<br/>
went back to bed to &#39;play&#39; with the money. I basically just liked the sound<br/>
of the coins running through my fingers; the thought that I might be doing<br/>
something &quot;wrong&quot; didn&#39;t really fully enter my mind. Then my aunt came up<br/>
the stairs, heard the sound of money and asked me what I was doing. I don&#39;t<br/>
know why, but I felt myself contract when she asked the question and I said<br/>
&quot;nothing&quot;. When she asked what it was I was playing with in my bed, again I<br/>
said &quot;nothing&quot;. She came into the room and pulled the covers back to reveal<br/>
the handful of change and asked me where I got it from. I don&#39;t clearly<br/>
remember, but I must have at that point realized that any further lying<br/>
wasn&#39;t going to get me anywhere and told her the truth. My aunt went to tell<br/>
my grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
Later that day, my aunt was sitting on the sofa in my room, I was standing<br/>
in front of her as she shared with me how it wasn&#39;t ok for me to have gone<br/>
into her room and taken money without asking. I could tell that she wasn&#39;t<br/>
angry, she just wanted me to ask in the future and because I felt a warm<br/>
connection with her in that moment I said to myself that I would never do<br/>
such a thing again, that I would instead ask her first as she was<br/>
requesting.<br/>
<br/>
In that moment my grandmother quietly came up behind me and without my<br/>
anticipating her at all, she whacked me on the backside with a yellow<br/>
plastic carpet beater. Just once, but hard. I still remember looking at the<br/>
red marks on me later that day. And as she whacked me she said &quot;that was for<br/>
lying to us&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot begin to adequately describe to you how utterly betrayed I felt in<br/>
that moment, betrayed by my aunt for knowing  my grandmother was coming and<br/>
not warning me. My connection with my aunt went to pieces, my trust in her<br/>
goodwill towards me was shattered in that very moment and never completely<br/>
regained. I felt enraged at my grandmother for being so &quot;mean&quot; to me as to<br/>
sneak up behind me and &quot;attack&quot; me like that. And I made an instant oath of<br/>
retribution: that somehow I would make both my aunt and my grandmother pay<br/>
for how they had treated me on that one occasion.<br/>
<br/>
I did not make a consciously formulated oath, but my actions from there on<br/>
tell me, in hindsight that I did make the oath, even if unconsciously, and<br/>
that I carried it out on a daily basis by lying to and taking money from my<br/>
aunt and grandmother at every opportunity; and making sure I would not get<br/>
caught.<br/>
<br/>
Why am I telling you this? Because until a few weeks ago, during our first<br/>
couples&#39; group together, I had not made the connection between those events<br/>
of my childhood and how they still affect my life and my relationship with<br/>
Fran (my husband) today: we have a major debt to deal with and we have to be<br/>
careful how we spend &quot;our&quot; &#39;borrowed&#39; money, and yet I find myself regularly<br/>
making purchases which are not necessary and which are above our budget, and<br/>
everytime I do that, I feel as though I am stealing, especially when I don&#39;t<br/>
inform Fran about what I am buying and why. Then a part of me waits to get<br/>
&quot;hit&quot; by Fran&#39;s reaction when the visa statement comes in.<br/>
<br/>
I have, with Fran&#39;s help, re-created dysfunctional aspects of my<br/>
relationship with my grandmother for the purpose of healing those aspects<br/>
within myself. The rage and the sense of betrayal I felt as a child was<br/>
never healed and I keep re-creating situations in which I expect to feel<br/>
this rage and sense of betrayal which is related to feeling not cared about.<br/>
This is where Fran comes in, because whenever my visa statement comes in, he<br/>
just pays it off quietly without ever questioning me. The &quot;hit&quot; that I<br/>
always expect, never comes, and on some deep level I interpret that as &quot;Fran<br/>
really doesn&#39;t care about me spending the money = he really doesn&#39;t care<br/>
about me&quot;. Then it&#39;s time for me to beat up on myself mentally to prove to<br/>
myself that I am not lovable.<br/>
<br/>
You see, when my grandmother hit me she was coming from a place of &quot;I am<br/>
doing this for your own good, because I care about you and because I don&#39;t<br/>
want you to grow up lying and stealing&quot;.  Well, with her method she achieved<br/>
the exact opposite, and here it is 29 years later, and several years of<br/>
therapy and I am only now able to see the more subtle ways in which I still<br/>
steal and lie about things, and the ways in which I equate love and caring<br/>
with getting hit (in some form or another).<br/>
<br/>
Given my grandmother&#39;s history and the tools she had to work with, I know<br/>
that she truly believed she was doing me a favour and showing caring, even<br/>
though I did not experience it that way; and I am truly excited to have put<br/>
these pieces of the puzzle of my life together, because now I have the<br/>
ability to choose consciously how I spend money and include Fran in the<br/>
process, rather than react out of my unconscious, and seemingly be unable to<br/>
control my spending. And I see clearly that getting hit is not the same as<br/>
being loved and cared about. I &quot;knew&quot; that already, but some part of me deep<br/>
down inside didn&#39;t feel it that way.<br/>
<br/>
This was my own personal experience and not at all like your experience with<br/>
your son in the mall. My point however is that even one single event such as<br/>
this one can have long lasting effects. In no way was I ever intending to<br/>
imply that you are &quot;a child abuser&quot;, just as my grandmother wasn&#39;t. She<br/>
really believed she was doing me a favour and teaching me a lesson. Her<br/>
method did not work, but I know absolutely for sure, that my aunts method<br/>
(of simply connecting with me at the heart level and asking for what she<br/>
needed from me) would have worked.<br/>
<br/>
This brings me to your question:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am curious as to some of the things you have learned in your class<br/>
&gt; with DH. How have you come to terms and found common ground with the<br/>
&gt; differences you have in your childrenrearing techniques?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have been going to separate circles (men&#39;s group and women&#39;s group) for<br/>
over a year and a half. On my own I began serious self-healing work about<br/>
seven years ago, Fran and I have been married for four years. In these<br/>
circles we focus on &quot;how is the past coloring and affecting the present?&quot;<br/>
For example I would get furious with Fran for losing his temper with &#39;my<br/>
daughters&#39; and getting into horrendous arguments with them. Through his work<br/>
in circle, Fran has come to realize how much he is like his own father and<br/>
grandfather, when he loses his temper like that and how much it hurt him as<br/>
a little boy, to be reduced to tears by his father&#39;s angry voice, how<br/>
terrified he would be of his dad, how he would always have to keep his radar<br/>
going to find out what kind of mood dad was in, if it was safe to speak.<br/>
Acknowledging how he was doing the same thing to our kids was not easy.<br/>
<br/>
However: since Fran has made a conscious effort to control his temper with<br/>
the children, I have been faced with an underlying reason for Fran&#39;s anger:<br/>
he was watching my daughters treat me like their slave in many respects, and<br/>
he was furious at them for treating me that way. What he did not realize<br/>
that I had &quot;trained&quot; them to treat me that way, out of my own guilt for<br/>
leaving their father, etc. Whenever he would yell at them for something I<br/>
would immediately focus on his anger and so not be able to see what was<br/>
really going on. He was overreacting to their behaviours precisely because I<br/>
was underreacting. Once he stopped overreacting the intensity between my<br/>
daughters and myself was allowed to surface and was brought face to face<br/>
with my &quot;slave&quot;. There came a point where decided &quot;enough is enough&quot; and I<br/>
began to take steps to move out of that role with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
The circle helped us in this particular issue by helping Fran to stop<br/>
overreacting to my girls while at the same time expressing to me how he felt<br/>
when they treated me like their slave. Circle helped Fran to express his<br/>
feelings in an authentic, non-blaming, non-judgemental kind of way, which I<br/>
was able to hear. And eventually it sunk in and I felt motivated for my own<br/>
sake to do something about it. Since then I have been able to be a lot<br/>
clearer about what my boundaries are, when I mean &quot;no&quot; and stick to it, what<br/>
behaviours are not acceptable to me, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Circle helps Fran and I to look at where certain reaction really come from.<br/>
The more intensely we react to something, the older the trigger, meaning the<br/>
further back into our own childhood we need to go to see what aspect of us<br/>
is needing healing.<br/>
<br/>
Circle helps us to truly dialogue about issues, rather than discuss or<br/>
argue. &quot;discussion&quot; is when everybody talks and no one really listens to the<br/>
other(s); everybody has their own opinions to defend. &quot;Dialogue&quot; on the<br/>
other hand, is when people really open up their whole being to receive what<br/>
someone else is saying, taking what has been said inside themselves to<br/>
diligently examine if there is any objective Truth to be found in what the<br/>
other person is saying, acknowledging that Truth (if there is any) to<br/>
everyone and then sharing their own experience on the topic while everyone<br/>
else really listens in return.<br/>
<br/>
There is a book about this called &quot;On Dialogue&quot; by David Bohm. It is<br/>
required reading for the circles I belong to. Decisions are arrived at by<br/>
consensus through this process of sharing an experience/ opinion, the others<br/>
suspending all judgement and really listening and then sharing their<br/>
experience in return. (i did not do this in my first post responding to your<br/>
first post - I am not perfect at this yet, my emotions took over and I<br/>
reacted instead).<br/>
<br/>
I quote David Bohm: &quot;&#39;dialogue&#39; comes from the Greek word &#39;dialogos&#39;.<br/>
&#39;Logos&#39; means &quot;the word&quot;. And &#39;dia&#39; means &quot;through&quot; - it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;two&quot;.<br/>
A dialogue can be among any number of people, not just two. Even one person<br/>
can have a sense of dialogue within himself, if the spirit of the dialogue<br/>
is present. The picture or image that this derivation suggests is of a<br/>
&#39;stream of meaning&#39; flowing among and through us and between us. This will<br/>
make possible a flow of meaning in the whole group, out of which may emerge<br/>
some new understanding. It&#39;s something new, which may not have been in the<br/>
starting point at all. It&#39;s something creative. And this shared meaning is<br/>
the &quot;glue&quot; or &quot;cement&quot; that holds people and societies together.<br/>
Contrast this with the word &quot;discussion&quot;, which has the same root as<br/>
&quot;percussion&quot; and &quot;concussion&quot;. It really means to break things up. It<br/>
emphasizes the idea of analysis, where there may be many points of view, and<br/>
where everybody is presenting a different one - analyzing and breaking up.<br/>
That obviously has its value, but it is limited, and it will not get us very<br/>
far beyond our various points of view. Discussion is almost like a ping-pong<br/>
game, where people are batting the ideas back and forth and the object of<br/>
the game is to win or to get points for yourself. Possibly you will take up<br/>
somebody else&#39;s ideas to back up your own - you may agree with some and<br/>
disagree with others - but the basic point is to win the game. That&#39;s very<br/>
frequently the case in a discussion. In a dialogue however, nobody is trying<br/>
to win. Everybody wins, if anybody wins. There is a different sort of spirit<br/>
to it. In a dialogue there is no attempt to gain points, or to make your<br/>
particular view prevail. Rather, whenever any mistake is discovered on the<br/>
part of anybody, everybody gains.<br/>
It&#39;s a situation called win-win, whereas the other game is win-lose - if I<br/>
win, you lose. But a dialogue is something more of a common participation,<br/>
in which we are not playing a game against each other, but &#39;with&#39; each<br/>
other. In a dialogue, everybody wins.&quot;  end of quote<br/>
<br/>
So whenever an issue arises, be it over the children, how to spend money,<br/>
how much (or little) intimacy there is between us - whatever the case may<br/>
be - circle is teaching us to use certain tools, such as: dialogue, telling<br/>
our microscopic truth while breathing deeply (diaphragmatically),<br/>
acknowledging ourselves and each other for being truthful and taking 100%<br/>
response-ability for our own experience (= no blaming the other for how we<br/>
ourselves are feeling or perceiving something). Sometimes we get so deeply<br/>
triggered that we need help in the moment. Then we get on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this answers your question, but in closing I would like to<br/>
share with you something else we learned in self-healing circles: how to<br/>
create a relationship vision and how to work towards living that vision. And<br/>
here is our (incomplete) relationship vision:<br/>
<br/>
FRAN & NICOLETTA&#39;S RELATIONSHIP VISION<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PURPOSE:<br/>
<br/>
Ø To co-create a co-committed, mutually fulfilling, loving, conscious<br/>
marriage and to clear out of the way all obstacles to this end.<br/>
Ø To bring Harmony into our family life<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PRIME DIRECTIVE:<br/>
<br/>
To focus on deepening our connection:<br/>
<br/>
Ø to the state of being in Love<br/>
Ø to our own Essence<br/>
Ø to each other, Essence to Essence,<br/>
<br/>
before anything else and to come back to this focus as quickly as possible<br/>
whenever we notice feeling &quot;out&quot; of Love, in reaction or disconnected from<br/>
each other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
INTENTIONS/AGREEMENTS:<br/>
<br/>
Ø We read our relationship vision often, preferably together<br/>
Ø We give and receive touch/holding every day<br/>
Ø We do whatever we need to feel connected before going to bed<br/>
Ø We express our authentic sexuality in mutually satisfying, healthy, loving<br/>
ways<br/>
Ø We share our thoughts, feelings and fantasies with each other in uplifting<br/>
ways (Truth with Love)<br/>
Ø We listen to each other and hear each other<br/>
Ø We acknowledge each other frequently and unconditionally<br/>
Ø We share withholds with each other as close to the moment as possible<br/>
Ø We gently remind each other to stroke and to breathe deeply<br/>
(diaphragmatically)<br/>
Ø We have fun together in and out of the house<br/>
Ø We resolve conflict through dialogue and process, always striving for<br/>
win/win solutions<br/>
Ø We support each other to reach our highest potential in all areas of our<br/>
lives<br/>
Ø We honour each other&#39;s need for closeness and time apart<br/>
Ø We create financial abundance in our lives<br/>
Ø We make decisions together through process and dialogue<br/>
Ø We keep our agreements with each other<br/>
<br/>
As parents:<br/>
Ø We focus on deepening our connection with the children (Being to Being)<br/>
before anything else and support each other in this<br/>
Ø We take 100% responsibility for our experience around the children<br/>
especially when something they did or said triggered a reaction inside us<br/>
Ø We are loving, patient, respectful towards the children<br/>
Ø We have fun with the children<br/>
Ø We keep our agreements with the children<br/>
Ø We make important decisions together, involving the children in the<br/>
process when it is appropriate<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Behaviours and Thought Pattern/Scripts, which interfere with our Vision:<br/>
<br/>
Ø Withholding microscopic Truth in the moment for fear of getting reaction<br/>
back<br/>
Ø Taking on projections and identifying with scripts which correspond to<br/>
projections<br/>
Ø Withdrawing<br/>
Ø Blaming<br/>
Ø Projecting longing for a parenting onto each other unconsciously<br/>
Ø Waiting and wanting to be taken care of by the other instead of being<br/>
clear and expressing our needs and wants directly<br/>
Ø Triangulating<br/>
Ø Losing our temper with the children and/or each other<br/>
Ø Getting defensive<br/>
Ø Expecting to be abandoned emotionally<br/>
Ø Despairing and resigning to the way things are (&quot;it&#39;s no use&quot;)<br/>
Ø Harbouring resentments<br/>
Ø Criticizing/correcting without acknowledgement (Truth without Love)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;THE NEW RELATIONSHIP<br/>
MALE (FEMALE)<br/>
<br/>
The King (Queen) in me aligns with the Queen (King) in you,<br/>
That the Kingdom will flourish and prosper.<br/>
<br/>
The Priest (Priestess) in me worships the God in you,<br/>
That the God in all may awaken.<br/>
<br/>
The Scholar in me learns from the Teacher in you,<br/>
That Truth may illuminate the darkness.<br/>
<br/>
The Artist in me dances to the Music in you,<br/>
In joyful expression of Loving.<br/>
<br/>
The Father (Mother) in me unites with the Mother (Father) in you,<br/>
To birth Humanity&#39;s freedom.<br/>
<br/>
The Merlin in me melds with the Merlin in you,<br/>
Through the Alchemy of Oneness.<br/>
<br/>
The Warrior in me stands with the Warrior in you,<br/>
For mutual Cause and protection.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From &quot;Master Angelic Transmissions -<br/>
Awakening To Our Greater Birth&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Some people may not think all this appropriate for an un-schooling list; I<br/>
believe however that it all is appropriate, because where else are children<br/>
going to learn these things if not at home from us - their parents.<br/>
