<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044681066">its so cool to be on this list and read to &#39;boards&#39;.  the homeschool<br/>
community is so diverse and there are people from all different<br/>
backgrounds doing what they think is best for thier kids. its so cool!<br/>
and so refreshing and encouraging to me. i thought i was odd because i<br/>
didn&#39;t fit the homeschool mold where family was perfect and all. you all<br/>
know what i mean i&#39;m sure. i also see alot of bad attitudes from the<br/>
different homeschoolers that have a different teaching/hsing style,<br/>
which bothers me. though i&#39;ve been known to throw a few stones myself.<br/>
its easy to raise the hackles when someone is attacking your way of<br/>
doing things. well thats the sinful world we live in i guess but i wish<br/>
we could be less judgemental! myself included!      thankyou --Deborah<br/>
