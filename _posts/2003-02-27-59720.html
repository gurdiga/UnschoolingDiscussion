<div id="ygrps-yiv-315814428">When I first chose to homeschool, I thought that of course I would let my<br/>
children go to school someday if they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Then I thought about all the ways that schools teach kids they are stupid.<br/>
I decided I wouldn&#39;t let them go to school until I was certain they were<br/>
confident in their own ability to learn and wouldn&#39;t be swayed by doing<br/>
poorly on a test or by some teacher&#39;s assessment of their work.<br/>
<br/>
Now I think about how school simply takes up so much time!  (Not to mention<br/>
all the negative stuff at school, even though bits of good and fun do occur<br/>
there.)<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t refuse to allow my kids to go to school, but if they did want to<br/>
go, I would do my best to find out why and find alternatives to meet their<br/>
needs, rather than just letting them go.  Maybe I would even *require* &lt;g&gt;<br/>
them to read The Teenage Liberation Handbook and Guerilla Learning and give<br/>
me full oral reports before I would let them go.  This would at least give<br/>
them practice in assigned work before they enrolled!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>you are describing our situation here.....trying to see what the true <br/>
motivation for my 10yo wanting to go back to school, and making sure if she <br/>
does it won&#39;t be like before. I won&#39;t be on her back about homework and <br/>
classwork and so forth. I want her to know that as long as she is learning <br/>
and enjoying herself, that is what I care about. Her self-worth is not tied <br/>
up in tests and grades. (very different attitude now than the one I had when <br/>
she went to school before) I have offered to read the TTLH aloud to her, she <br/>
isn&#39;t very interested. I am reading it without her and wishing I could <br/>
telepathically enlighten her......<br/>
