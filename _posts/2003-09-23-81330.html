&lt;&lt; I think there&#39;s a big difference between saying that you learn something<br/>
from every experience and experiences happen IN ORDER to teach us something.<br/>
Many things happen for no reason, but you can still take a valuable lesson<br/>
from them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
VERY true.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t believe people can learn from random happenings, how can we <br/>
possibly believe in unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
If we needed to plan out our entire curriculum before being born...  yeeeesh!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Many years ago, someone blew up a house I was living in. Some people<br/>
actually asked me what it was about my life that caused that to happen. I<br/>
have learned many things through having had that experience, but no one<br/>
could ever convince me that there was anything about my life that CAUSED<br/>
that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I got a couple of people saying something like that to me after I broke my <br/>
leg last year.  It was irritating.  What I needed to learn, I think, is that wet <br/>
ramps in climates where slippy-slime can grow will be slippery like nothing <br/>
ever seen in New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
I learned that we need a bigger door into our downstairs bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
I learned that my kids can&#39;t make much food beyond a hot dog, peanut butter <br/>
sandwich, Ramen and scrambled eggs.  I learned I can get really tired of that <br/>
menu.<br/>
<br/>
I took it not as sympathy but as irritating insult that I was hurt in order <br/>
to teach me a lesson.  Seemed to me someone had paid for me to go and speak to <br/>
people who really wanted to hear me.  There are still people who were greatly <br/>
put out by my missing that conference to be in the hospital, so if anyone on <br/>
this list was one of the people who said &quot;I guess there was some lesson the <br/>
universe needed to teach you,&quot; you don&#39;t need to confess because I don&#39;t remember <br/>
who said it.  Keep it to yourself forever, if you can.<br/>
<br/>
I think people are born randomly and they live in a random world where they <br/>
try constantly to find patterns (because that&#39;s what people do) and sometimes <br/>
they get all excited about a pattern or theory (about causation or death or <br/>
life or afterlife) and they start making decisions based on their theory.<br/>
<br/>
Because of that, people have thought that human behavior has caused tornados, <br/>
earthquakes, volcanos, floods and fires.  They REALLY believe that because <br/>
people were bad, or prayed wrong, or didn&#39;t sacrifice a sheep or a cow or a <br/>
virgin girl, that something invisible but powerful was going to dip them in hot <br/>
lava, or shake their houses down.  Some people have little tiny versions of <br/>
that: lucky socks, wearing a certain ring or bracelet or shirt, whatever it is, <br/>
there are magic talismans in use even by the most scientific of people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306650812">To fully understand the lesson, one needs to look deeper than <br/>
just the surface/physical aspects of life that are affected.  If a <br/>
sickness or injury occurs maybe it is your body/mind/soul <br/>
saying &quot;You need to slow down and rest.  YOu are taking on too <br/>
much.  YOu need to spend some time working on the inside and less on <br/>
the outside world for awhile.  I&#39;ve been trying to send this message <br/>
in other ways, but you haven&#39;t listened.  Now I need to give a <br/>
louder message&quot;. <br/>
   Louise Hay has written a really neat book about the <br/>
metaphysical/spiritual reasons for different ailments.  Just for fun <br/>
I looked up leg problems (a broken bone would certainly be a <br/>
problem).  She suggested that since legs carry us through life, a <br/>
leg problem would be the result of fear of the furture and not <br/>
wanting to move. <br/>
Of course not everyone would like a book like this, but I find it <br/>
quite right on for myself.  <br/>
   The deeper reason for things happening might not always be to <br/>
learn a lesson, it may be to keep something else from happening.  <br/>
Let&#39;s say someone is planning a vacation, but got sick.  That sucks, <br/>
the vacation was to Hawaii and was going to be awesome.  <br/>
Later that night he hears on the news that the plane he was supposed <br/>
to take to Hawaii crashed, no survivors....it wasn&#39;t his time to die.<br/>
  Have you ever heard people who are trying to buy a house say.  I&#39;m <br/>
so glad we didn&#39;t get that last one, THIS is the right house for us.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few more ideas....<br/>
<br/>
-Jennifer V<br/>
ps Eastern philosophies often discuss predestination.  I just say <br/>
this because I believe there was earlier dicussion about the idea of <br/>
predestination being new...maybe I&#39;m incorrect though.<br/>

CA in the 70s through est) is if we choose everything (and the <br/>
permutation that we choose it all before even being born) what&#39;s <br/>
the point of lessons anyway? Who cares if I learn anything? To <br/>
what end?<br/>
<br/>
Why would I choose to break my leg to learn how to, what, <br/>
recover from leg-breakings? Why would I choose to have my <br/>
husband cheat on me so that I could, what, experience the pain <br/>
and suffering of divorce? Then when I learned the lessons, what <br/>
do they produce? <br/>
<br/>
And a corollary: how does learning something from choices <br/>
made before birth look or feel any different than being dealt a <br/>
random set of circumstances that we learn from as we go?<br/>
<br/>
Learning is the nature of living. Choosing in pre-existence or <br/>
facing dilemmas after being born? What&#39;s the diff?<br/>

Jen, I&#39;m currently studying some of these issues in a grad <br/>
school program so I offer my thoughts here not to rebut you per <br/>

Much of religious thought over the centuries is about gaining <br/>
control over the unforeseen. And much of it is comforting and <br/>
often even useful for reflection. The caution I have in myself now, <br/>
though, is to beleive that these ideas are axiomaticthat a <br/>
broken leg equals fear of the future and not wanting to move. If <br/>
we believe that it actually means those things, we will become <br/>
perfectionists in our attempts to control our emotions, thoughts, <br/>
beliefs and ideas to prevent bad things from occuring, when in <br/>
reality there isn&#39;t a belief system/healthy emotional life system on <br/>
the planet that protects anyone from harm or evil.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But it was everyone else&#39;s time to die? I remember after 9/11 <br/>
hearing of the miraculous escapes of some of the survivors. <br/>
Several attributed those narrow escapes to God as preserving <br/>
his/her life. How does someone else see the loss of their loved <br/>
one&#39;s lifeGod didn&#39;t protect, care, save? That it was their <br/>
&quot;time&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who told me that her best friend died of cancer after <br/>
the whole church community had prayed for her. This friend of <br/>
mine was very ill at the time. She said that God taught her <br/>
through her friend&#39;s death that she must learn to trust God more <br/>
so she wouldn&#39;t die.<br/>
<br/>
For me, this felt strange and wrong. Better to mourn the lost life <br/>
and to face illness honestly than to assume God is orchestrating <br/>
death for one so that the living person would learn to trust God <br/>
better than the dead one did.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so glad we didn&#39;t get that last one, THIS is the right house for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>us.<br/>
<br/>
And have you heard of the ones who almost got their dream <br/>
home when someone else got it and they had to settle for a <br/>
lesser home? (My sister comes to mind...)<br/>
<br/>
In the end, we all make sense of our exitsence in ways that bring <br/>
us peace and comfort. For me, it became too uncomfortable to <br/>
try to fit every circumstance into a &quot;meaning&quot; package.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510500254">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Amy, from Grand Rapids, Michigan.  I am not yet an unschooler, but <br/>
am really just to the point of deciding where and how the necessary changes <br/>
will take place -- I may bring that up later.  My oldest son Fisher is <br/>
currently in first grade at a charter school.  My younger son Riley is only three <br/>
months -- his unschooling involves watching us bigheads until he gets too tired.  &lt;<br/>
g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading posts on this list for a little less than a week.  I, <br/>
like Holly, take myself with a huge grain of salt -- so big, it would give the <br/>
whole list high blood pressure.  But I&#39;m interested in pursuing a line of <br/>
thought here, so I&#39;m going to give it a whirl.  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve been reading the _Ishmael_ <br/>
series by Daniel Quinn, and found them very intriguing, even life- and <br/>
worldview-changing.  They are meant to be a series of philosophical treatises, <br/>
couched in novel form.  (Hey, it worked for Plato.)  In my response below I&#39;ve <br/>
pulled out some of the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
In a message dated 9/23/03 6:53:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a> writes: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not all &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are cultural.  If <br/>
&gt; they were, babies would have nothing to cry about until someone else had <br/>
&gt; taught them what to expect.  Food is better than lack of food.  Warmth is <br/>
&gt; better <br/>
&gt; than freezing cold.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You use the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; and then talk about behaviors of basic <br/>
survival.  Babies don&#39;t cry because their hunger is universally bad -- they cry <br/>
to be fed and therefore to survive.  But, if that baby lives in North America <br/>
or Western Europe, she will grow up to consume more than her share of the <br/>
world&#39;s resources.  Rainforests will be destroyed so that she and her peers, at 21, <br/>
can have a cappucino before their first college class of the day.  That could <br/>
be considered bad, especially by the inhabitants of the rainforest.  (And no, <br/>
I&#39;m not in favor of  depriving starving babies, North American or otherwise.  <br/>
Stick with me, I&#39;m trying to get to the &quot;useful&quot; part.)  Eventually, because <br/>
I&#39;m told that the planet needs the biological diversity found in rainforests <br/>
(and in other ecosystems that we often destroy for our food and our raw <br/>
materials), this will be bad for the survival of the planet.<br/>
<br/>
If that crying baby belongs to the !Kung in Africa, however, she will have <br/>
very little ecological impact -- her people still live within the limits of the <br/>
ecosystem, still control their population and the damage they do to the <br/>
environment.  That could be considered to be, if not good, at least not harmful.<br/>
<br/>
My point:  much of the &quot;beliefs&quot; discussion on this list has dealt with world <br/>
religions that are only six to eight thousand years old -- a blip on the <br/>
screen when it comes to the whole of human history that could inform our beliefs.  <br/>
Because the major world religions (Hinduism, a variation of which Judie <br/>
seemed to be espousing; Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, <br/>
Christianity, Islam, neo-Paganism, if not Paganism  -- I&#39;m most certainly missing <br/>
some) have all come about in cultures in which humans were not living within the <br/>
laws of the community of life, they have all had to address humans as flawed <br/>
beings, as capable of evil, which many of them have elevated to The Question of <br/>
Evil.  Because of that, they can get pretty goofy.  For instance, one way <br/>
I&#39;ve heard the central tenet of Christianity paraphrased is that God so loved the <br/>
world that he committed divine child abuse .  Or in Hinduism, souls that are <br/>
working their way to enlightenment may choose incarnations (or be sentenced to <br/>
incarnations) that seem awful, but all is as it is supposed to be.  And so <br/>
the mostly Hindu nation of India lives with the Untouchables.  <br/>
<br/>
(I should clarify that I think faith and religion are amazing things, because <br/>
they are an expression of the natural capacity for spirituality that lives in <br/>
humans.  It&#39;s just that they can be reduced to some statements that are <br/>
really weird, even harmful [to humans].) <br/>
<br/>
But there may be more useful insights when one goes back to the <br/>
evolutionarily stable way that humans lived for nearly three million years before the <br/>
agricultural revolution.  Insights like: Take only what you need;  Limit your <br/>
population size;  Live by the laws of your tribe, but don&#39;t assume you can tell <br/>
other tribes how to live;  As you eat one day, you may be eaten on another, so <br/>
you might want to come to terms with death as a very real part of life.  (And <br/>
world religions and their practitioners often confuse death with evil, it <br/>
seems.)  So in unschooling and in life, it might be useful to extend the models for <br/>
making choices.  I&#39;m not saying that we will return to a hunter/gatherer <br/>
lifestyle, but that we can learn and envision and create a way of life that is not <br/>
inherently destructive to the planet or ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
And now I have to laugh at myself, because I&#39;m just so pleased with <br/>
everything I just wrote here that I&#39;m envisioning the responses:  &quot;wow, you&#39;ll have no <br/>
trouble with unschooling,&quot; and &quot;what was that book again?&quot;  Probably not, huh? <br/>
 But it is exciting for me as I&#39;m integrating these ideas into how I interact <br/>
with the world, and I&#39;m very interested in feedback and yes, criticism.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pressing send now.  Bring it on.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473842723">Hi Julie,<br/>
  I do understand your points.  There are so many ways of looking at <br/>
things, and I totally agree with you that we all make sense of our <br/>
exitsence in ways that bring us peace and comfort.  I don&#39;t believe <br/>
we&#39;ll ever know what the truth is, or thruths are, about our life on <br/>
this earth until we&#39;ve left (even this point will bring disagreement <br/>
with some...that&#39;s fine).  There is so much we don&#39;t understand, and <br/>
yes, trying to put &quot;meaning&quot; to everything can be quite tiresome at <br/>
least. And putting meaning to many things brings me peace and <br/>
comfort.  <br/>
   I&#39;m not going to answer all your questions here one this list, <br/>
but if you&#39;re really interested in my ideas you can email me <br/>

&gt; one&#39;s lifeGod didn&#39;t protect, care, save? That it was their <br/>
&gt; &quot;time&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had a friend who told me that her best friend died of cancer <br/>
 </span></blockquote>after <br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; the whole church community had prayed for her. This friend of <br/>
&gt; mine was very ill at the time. She said that God taught her <br/>
&gt; through her friend&#39;s death that she must learn to trust God more <br/>
&gt; so she wouldn&#39;t die.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For me, this felt strange and wrong. Better to mourn the lost life <br/>
&gt; and to face illness honestly than to assume God is orchestrating <br/>
&gt; death for one so that the living person would learn to trust God <br/>
&gt; better than the dead one did.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Have you ever heard people who are trying to buy a house <br/>
&gt; say.  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; &gt; so glad we didn&#39;t get that last one, THIS is the right house for <br/>
&gt; us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And have you heard of the ones who almost got their dream <br/>
&gt; home when someone else got it and they had to settle for a <br/>
&gt; lesser home? (My sister comes to mind...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the end, we all make sense of our exitsence in ways that bring <br/>
&gt; us peace and comfort. For me, it became too uncomfortable to <br/>
&gt; try to fit every circumstance into a &quot;meaning&quot; package.<br/>

I don&#39;t know exactly where the environmental impact part of your post comes <br/>
into play with responding to Sandra&#39;s post, but as to the first part, have you <br/>
read Jean Liedloff&#39;s book *The Continuum Concept*? It deals with the heart of <br/>
what Sandra stated in this part of her post. I am currently rereading the book <br/>
for the umpteenth time, and I have just read the part dealing with the very <br/>
nature of a baby&#39;s reality in his or her own continuum. She writes in matters <br/>
concerning a newborn infant; &quot;Again, the quality of his awareness is very <br/>
different from what it will become. He cannot qualify his impression of how things <br/>
are. Either they are right or not right. Requirements are strict at this early <br/>
date. As we have seen, he cannot hope, if he is uncomfortable now, that he <br/>
will be comfortable later. He cannot feel that &quot;mother will be right back&quot; when <br/>
she leaves him; the world has suddenly gone wrong, conditions are intolerable. <br/>
He hears and accepts his own weeping, but although his mother knows the sound <br/>
and its meaning since time immemorial, and so does any child or adult who <br/>
hears it, he does not. He only senses that it is a positive action toward setting <br/>
things right. But if he is left to cry for too long, if the response it is <br/>
meant to elicit does not come, that feeling departs as well, giving way to utter <br/>
bleakness without time or hope. When his mother does come to him, he simply <br/>
feels right, he is not aware that she has been away, nor does h e remember <br/>
having cried. He is reconnected to his lifeline and his environment meets his <br/>
expectations. When he is abandoned, put out of his continuum of correct <br/>
experience, nothing is acceptable, and nothing is accepted. Want is all there is, there <br/>
is nothing to use, to grow on, to fulfill his requirement for experience, for <br/>
the experiences must be expected ones...&quot; and a little while later she writes; <br/>
&quot;If he feels safe, wanted, and &quot;at home&quot; in the midst of activity before he <br/>
can think, his view of later experiences will be very distinct in character <br/>
from those of a child who feels unwelcome, unstimulated by the experiences he has <br/>
missed, and accustomed to living in a state of want, though the later <br/>
experiences of both may be identical. At first, the infant only notices; he cannot <br/>
reason. He becomes familiar with his surroundings by association. At the very <br/>
outset, in the first postnatal messages brought in by the senses, there is an <br/>
absoluteness, an unqualified impression of the state of things, relative to <br/>
nothing but the innate expectations of the infant and, of course, devoid of any <br/>
relation to the passage of time.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So Sandra&#39;s hypothetical baby cries from its innate expectations. Gradually <br/>
the baby learns that certain actions elicit a positive response. If those <br/>
innate expectations were not present at or even before birth, then babies since <br/>
time immemorial would have no need to cry until someone taught them that they <br/>
should expect some things to happen. As it is, babies, all of them, have a <br/>
natural expectation that food and warmth are basic requirements in their continuum, <br/>
and if not met, they cry. At first not knowing why they cry or even <br/>
remembering that they did cry, but gradually learning that the cry begets a response. A <br/>
young baby without the power of reason cannot hope to know the passage of <br/>
time, as it has no experience of time. It isn&#39;t until much later that time has <br/>
meaning in dealing with the basic needs. An infant has no knowledge of time only <br/>
that something is either right or wrong, good or bad at this moment. A five <br/>
year old has a much better concept, yet still not fully realized. A promise of a <br/>
special want at a future date (to use Liedloff&#39;s example, a bike at Christmas <br/>
promised in August) means little to a five year old, almost as if there were <br/>
no promise at all, but hope is beginning to be established. As hope can only <br/>
be established with the passage and realization of time. For without time there <br/>
is no hope. An infant knows no time, therefore has no hope, but does have <br/>
innate expectations. A ten year old on the other hand experiences time better and <br/>
can understand August, September, October, November, December. Although for a <br/>
ten year old, the wait, the hope, is still prolonged. <br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t read the book, I strongly suggest doing so. But that is just <br/>
my two cents. &lt;g&gt; I could be way off track in interpreting what you were trying <br/>
to say.<br/>
