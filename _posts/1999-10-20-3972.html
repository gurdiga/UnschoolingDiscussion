our<br/>
&gt; VISIT???  just JOKING!!!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll be sure to tell dh about the antique train museum, how neat ... last<br/>
&gt; summer we took the Silverton/Durang train in CO, we had a BLAST ...  dh<br/>
&gt; begged and begged the engineer to let him run the train (course, he<br/>
couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; and dh KNEW BETTER!!!) but after showing his rr id card, the eng let dh<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; on the train for a few mintes ... this was the highlight of his<br/>
vacation!!!<br/>
