<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980938993">Gotta question. Ds, 3yo just started a ten week art class. 30 minutes each of <br/>
dance, art, and music. The dance part is great, the instructor just does her <br/>
thing, is very enthusiastic, if the kids follow along great, and if not she <br/>
doesn&#39;t mind. The kids are all 3-5. But the art and esp. music bug me, and I <br/>
think my son. The music is more focused on listening to words, repeating, <br/>
stepping on the beat, etc. And the instructor will stop to try to get each <br/>
child to do it right. Seems almost equally focused on following instructions, <br/>
if not more so, than experiencing music. Ds loved it all last week, but this <br/>
week was a bit more determined not to do as instructed (inside I cheer :-)). <br/>
At home, this is great. We have all the stuff and he does or doesn&#39;t do as he <br/>
wants to. But at the class....well, I dunno what to do. And it&#39;s not like <br/>
he&#39;s just sitting there not doing it, he&#39;s kinda doing his own thing, <br/>
deliberately not following along and distracting other kids. But he loves <br/>
going. So I&#39;m thinking maybe I should try to let him know that if we&#39;re gonna <br/>
go, he kinda needs to go with the program, but that we don&#39;t have to go.<br/>
I&#39;m not at all upset at what he&#39;s doing, don&#39;t know if I&#39;m wording this <br/>
right. We dance and sing and have art at home and it&#39;s all fun and come and <br/>
go as you please. I disagree with some of the format of the class and I&#39;m not <br/>
sure what we should do at this point. When we&#39;re in there I&#39;m feeling like <br/>
I&#39;m expected to guide him into following these orders and he seems resistant.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

if I end up guiding when I don&#39;t want to. For me, that happens most often <br/>
around family members with young people around Quinton&#39;s age, who don&#39;t allow <br/>
their children to do a certain thing and want to stop Quinton from doing it <br/>
as well, or direct him. <br/>
<br/>
I guess its a tough question. . .he is enjoying the social aspect of it and <br/>
wants to go, so you feel like you want to continue. I would as well I think. <br/>
I do believe I might talk to the instructor and tell her where you are coming <br/>
from and that you are there for the young one to have some fun while enjoying <br/>
music and interacting with other kids. . .period. I&#39;m sure others may have <br/>
some good ideas on this one too. I would just encourage you to stand up for <br/>
your beliefs if you feel this is important and I sense it is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a similar situation here.  Holly went with another family to an art <br/>
class for homeschoolers.  The city is paying an art instructor (some kind of <br/>
grant, artist-in-residence thing, I think).  I send my donation of a box of <br/>
art supplies (and GOOD stuff! &lt;g&gt;), and Holly was excited to go.<br/>
<br/>
When she got home she was grumpy because they wouldn&#39;t let her bring her <br/>
finished art home.  She said &quot;they&#39;re making a portfolio.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  I don&#39;t know whether (and Holly didn&#39;t know) it&#39;s a portfolio of <br/>
Holly&#39;s work or a portfolio for the teacher to show the city.<br/>
<br/>
If the former, we never agreed to continue longterm, she just wanted to go <br/>
try it out.<br/>
If the latter, that&#39;s what Polaroid cameras and photocopy machines are for!<br/>
<br/>
SO...<br/>
I could try to &quot;reason&quot; with the teacher and try to explain my philosophy and <br/>
what homeschooling has *not* in common with regular school art classes, or I <br/>
could just tell Holly to sneak her stuff out, or to let it go.  <br/>
<br/>
She feels (not unreasonably, I think) that art she makes belongs to her.<br/>
<br/>
If she were being paid by the hour to produce art THEN it would belong to her <br/>
employer, but this situation had no money exchanging hands, and in fact we <br/>
&quot;paid&quot; in supplies.<br/>
<br/>
I could justify the music class&#39;s desire to mess with rhythm, but I&#39;m not <br/>
going to because I, think some kids have rhythm, some don&#39;t, and they should <br/>
be having fun above all.<br/>

<br/>
I just can&#39;t see how a 3 yr old can be expected to be that coordinated LOL. I <br/>
have never participated in stuff for my kids when they were very little.  I <br/>
would<br/>
ask your son if he wants to attend and do what the instructors want or if he<br/>
would just like to attend a portion of the class (the dancing?) where he can<br/>
be free to enjoy himself?  I don&#39;t know how well that would work though <br/>
because<br/>
my littles would have put up a fuss leaving before everyone else did. Is he <br/>
feeling<br/>
bad or does he realize that he is &quot;upsetting&quot; the instuctors by not following <br/>
the rules? If he doesn&#39;t seem bothered by it then I would just continue on as <br/>
you <br/>
are.  If the instructors start to get in his face then I would say leave or <br/>
just<br/>
go to the one portion that you and he likes (if possible).<br/>
Ps. if your just looking to do this for the social aspect since he gets all <br/>
that stuff<br/>
you mentioned at home, have you hooked up with a homeschool group park day<br/>
where he can run around and play? <br/>

doing together. And they too don&#39;t like so much structure. So I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
surprised if something doesn&#39;t come up with the instructors. I just feel a <br/>
bit weird about it though, my issues I guess. They aren&#39;t being mean or <br/>
shaming, they&#39;re just being schooly. Like the music format is listen quietly, <br/>
now repeat, listen quietly, now repeat. And my son resists even though he <br/>
sings all the sons joyfully on the car ride home. :-)<br/>
<br/>
So I feel weird to go and say, &quot;I wonder if I might critique your teaching <br/>
style and give you some pointers.&quot; I know it could be worded better, but that <br/>
feels like the gist of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4525028">DS1 had something similar when he was 16 he took a<br/>

gave up several weeks of a job at a marina that PAYED<br/>
him to do the same type of work. And the conversation<br/>

more, and made friends that are STILL friends.<br/>
