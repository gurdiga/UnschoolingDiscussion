<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045606580">&quot;The definition of abuse is so wide, and can mean so many different <br/>
things&quot;<br/>
<br/>
True, to a point. I&#39;m not advocating that all abuse is equal, but it <br/>
is still all damaging.<br/>
I am sure that I would be considered abusive by some, for not <br/>
educating my children as they see fit.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s what my dictionary says:<br/>
&quot;Abuse: 2.To hurt or injure by maltreatment. (well, spankings hurt, <br/>
don&#39;t they?) 3.To speak to in a contemptuous, coarse, or insulting <br/>
way;revile. (Hmmmmmm? So even in homes where there is no physical <br/>
hurt, there can still be abuse).<br/>
<br/>
That qualifies spanking as abuse then.<br/>
And a whole lot more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745412514">Interesting - my dictionary also lists &quot;to act dishonestly&quot; as abuse. Never thought of that either!<br/>
