<div id="ygrps-yiv-80811842">Hello Barda!<br/>
So lovely to hear from a kindred spirit :-) I loved your post, and have to<br/>
say that much of what you shared about your family would apply to mine, too!<br/>
Birthed at home, nursed on demand (oldest dd til she was 5!), and attachment<br/>
parenting. All of that leads quite naturally to unschooling, I think,<br/>
because it&#39;s  built on trusting your children. I&#39;ve also had a copy of &quot;The<br/>
Aware baby&quot; on my bookshelf for 13 years (you started ahead of me ;-), and<br/>
have given it as a blessing way gift more than once. There are also some<br/>
articles of Aletha&#39;s you can print out that I&#39;ve handed to parents I see<br/>
struggling with new ones. I can also relate to your mother not quite getting<br/>
why you would be holding a screaming infant-my mother, after dd #2 had been<br/>
at it for an hour, then stopped, said &quot;have I gone deaf, or did she<br/>
stop...&quot;! I also heard just give her a pacifier (yuck), put her down or<br/>
you&#39;ll be that baby&#39;s slave, let her cry herself to sleep, blah, blah, blah.<br/>
I have a friend who always says they were born at home, why would I send<br/>
them anywhere to learn? so I&#39;ve always seen homebirth and then homeschool as<br/>
a natural transition. Always unschooled, although I&#39;ve learned alot since<br/>
reading this list, and have been able to trust them on an even deeper level.<br/>
Isn&#39;t being a parent just an incredible rush? I cannot imagine anything I&#39;d<br/>
rather do...well, an occasional pedicure does make me a really happy mama.<br/>
