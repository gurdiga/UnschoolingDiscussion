<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238477031">I wrote my own definition for &quot;Language Arts&quot; for the book I&#39;m working  <br/>
on, but then thought I should go and look at what the current  <br/>
definition might be.  What I found easily was lame and over- <br/>
simplified.  So I went looking for what the language arts teachers  <br/>
themselves are saying these days, and found this:<br/>
<br/>
STANDARD 3.5 ALL STUDENTS WILL VIEW, UNDERSTAND, AND USE NONTEXTUAL  <br/>
VISUAL INFORMATION .<br/>
<br/>
Descriptive Statement: In the language arts literacy classroom,  <br/>
students learn how to view in order<br/>
to be able to respond thoughtfully and critically to the visual  <br/>
messages of both print and nonprint.<br/>
Effective viewing is essential to comprehend and respond to personal  <br/>
interactions, live performances,<br/>
visual arts that involve oral and/or written language, and both print  <br/>
media (graphs, charts, diagrams,<br/>
illustrations, photographs, and graphic design in books, magazines,  <br/>
and newspapers) and electronic<br/>
media (television, computers, film). Students should recognize that  <br/>
what they speak, hear, write, and<br/>
read contributes to the content and quality of their viewing.<br/>
<br/>
=====================<br/>
<br/>
So good.  All the TV watching and YouTube viewing and pop-up books and  <br/>
such are justifiable now (for those of you who are gathering and  <br/>
reporting for the state you&#39;re in, or something).<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t read too many of those descriptions of |educational frameworks|  <br/>
at once; it might make you woozy.<br/>
