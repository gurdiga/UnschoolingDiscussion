Oh Sarah,  I hope so for you and your dd!  Maybe it&#39;s our Purpose (with a<br/>
capitol &#39;p&#39;) to do this so healing occurs for you and dd.  I have vague<br/>
memories of reading about how our attitude toward our parents shpes our<br/>
children&#39;s attitude&#39;s toward us as we grow older.  Implication was that if<br/>
we dis-connect and dis-respect from our parents,  our children may do this<br/>
to us.   Like I said,  my memory on this is vague.  I know it was enough to<br/>
make me really think and consider the how to talk about my kids<br/>
relationships with grandparents.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think this is necessarily so.  I think that if you explain to the <br/>
kids why you&#39;re disconnecting, they&#39;re going to understand, at least <br/>
eventually.  And I don&#39;t think you have to be disrespectful when <br/>
disconnecting.  Forceful yes, but not disrespectful.  Of course the kind of <br/>
parent who needs to be disconnected from is going to *call* it <br/>
disrespectful, but it&#39;s really just setting boundaries and making sure that <br/>
they are respected.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes Tia.  With me it&#39;s about setting boundaries and protecting myself, <br/>
and my feelings.<br/>
<br/>
What I do is, I never make negative comments about my mother in front of <br/>
my children.  I&#39;m pretty much letting them find out for themselves.  I <br/>
let them visit her whenever they want to which is becoming less and less <br/>
frequent.  That&#39;s their choice.  There are lots of cool and interesting <br/>
things about my mother I can talk to them about and that&#39;s what I <br/>
concentrate on.  I never bring up the bad stuff.  It would be a bad <br/>
example to do so.<br/>
