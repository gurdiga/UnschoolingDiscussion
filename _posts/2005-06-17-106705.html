<div id="ygrps-yiv-292582887">Hi, i&#39;m new here, and i&#39;m feeling very overwhlemed right now.  There are so many things going on in each of our lives.  And for me all of them are important.  I&#39;m not sure how to make time for all of it.  My kids education and well being come first.  I never want to change the fact we homeschool/unschool.  However I have some major medical things I need to be focusing on as well as a deteriating marriage.  That isn&#39;t to mention all the activities and other things.  How do you all make time for all of it????<br/>

I would get the kids some new, exciting, distracting video games and DVDs  <br/>
and focus energy on the marriage.  Kelly Lovejoy went to a  retreat/counselling <br/>
thing that&#39;s put on by the Catholic church (she&#39;s not  Catholic at all) and is <br/>
positive it saved her marriage--not just that, but their  marriage seems to <br/>
be especially happy and solid.  What emergency  counselling can stabilize, <br/>
unschooling can solidify.<br/>
 <br/>
Medical and kid-life are unlikely to get better if marriage falls.<br/>

Really did save my marriage. Weekend retreat. TOUGH! <br/>
Look into it. It&#39;s free (well, they ask for a donation at the end---you give <br/>
what you can/want to/feel it&#39;s worth) and they cover the hotel and meals for <br/>
the weekend.<br/>
It&#39;s Catholic-based, but not &quot;preachy&quot; at all. And they accept any faith---and <br/>
even the faithless (me).<br/>
 <br/>
It took a lot of healing---and didn&#39;t happen over the one weekend, but it was <br/>
worth it for us!<br/>

There was a very thorough and personal thread on this topic on the old unschooling.com message boards.  I don&#39;t know if anybody saved it.<br/>
<br/>
(I remember posting about a dead period in my marriage, myself.)<br/>

OK, so anyone who can actually spell (retrouvaille....??)  (check Kelly&#39;s original post) can probably search those archives and find this discussion.  I think the conversation last winter, but I could be wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484603202">Helen also said she was going to refer people to unschooling.info and<br/>
have a link to the site on unschooling.com, but she hasn&#39;t.  A week or<br/>
two after the shut-down I emailed her asking if there would be a link<br/>
and she said there would be, but that in the meanwhile she was sending<br/>
people who asked about the message boards an email.  She pasted in a<br/>
copy of the letter which basically was a &quot;we decided to go with a new<br/>
format, feel free to join our email group&quot; and linked to<br/>
hem-unschooling.  No mention at all of unschooling.info.  I emailed her<br/>
again and suggested that if people were emailing about the message board<br/>
location so soon after they were shut down, didn&#39;t she think they might<br/>
be looking for the familiar posters at unschooling.com who had moved to<br/>
unschooling.info?  I repeated my request that she post a link to<br/>
unschooling.info and other unschooling e-groups on the unschooling.com<br/>
domain.  I didn&#39;t get a reply to that one.<br/>

&gt;-=-=-=-=-=-=- [later]<br/>
&gt;As far as priorities.  Part of why we homeschool/unschool is so I can put my children first before other priorities.  I want their education at the top of the list!  For the past twqo months I have felt like they have taken the back burner in our family, and I don&#39;t feel this is fair.  So i agree marriage needs to be near the top; but we are adults and they are kids.  My girls are 7 n 8.  They have seen and been through alot.  They are currently very needy socially!  I&#39;m trying to find different things that will fit in our budget to help with that.  I have soem ideas, but many things are very expensive.  They miss our closest friends in IN very much.  We see them about 1ce a year, but its not the same.  They are searching for new friendships, and i&#39;m having a hard time focusing on more then one thing right now.  So for them they need to be my focus, atleast until things start to pan out for them.  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Megan and welcome! <br/>
I see you&#39;ve already received some amazing advice and I hope some of it <br/>
speaks to your heart. <br/>
I&#39;m jumping in as a mom who also had to raise kids in the midst of major <br/>
medical issues.  Involving the kids in your REAL life is the very best <br/>
thing you can do for them. My kids became brain tumor experts by ages 4 <br/>
& 2, from our trips to Mayo Clinic, weekly visits to the oncologist and <br/>
just good honest discussions; it *is* an environment where kids can <br/>
flourish.  When Mitch got sick, we put away our *homeschool* workbooks <br/>
and began to focus on the /people/ in our home, on our relationships <br/>
with one another, not the paperwork -- unschooling -- and we&#39;ve not <br/>
looked back since. <br/>
<br/>
Focusing on your children&#39;s well-being  means the marriage issues *MUST* <br/>
be dealt with in an adult fashion and quickly... Don&#39;t think for a <br/>
minute that your children are not learning from your relationship and <br/>
the role you each play in it.  Now is when you decide what it is you <br/>
want them to bring out of your family and into their own. <br/>
Living without a husband for 4.5 years now, has given me amazing <br/>
perspective on how important that other adult-with-vested-interest  in <br/>
the home is to the family.  Mitch and I decided early in our marriage <br/>
that when the children came, THEY would be the focus, especially when <br/>
they were babies -- we would have plenty of time to be married long <br/>
after the kids were grown.  Even though it didn&#39;t work out that way, and <br/>
we knew it wouldn&#39;t, we kept our commitment to them -- we let go of a <br/>
lot of immature pissiness in the name of raising kids and <br/>
living/modeling a happy marriage. <br/>
<br/>
On socializing, I&#39;d recommend looking up your local hs group and <br/>
attending parkday (we go every Tue) to check everyone out -- you should <br/>
show up a few times before you judge it, as not everyone shows up every <br/>
week. Sounds like you could use a sunny afternoon at the park, <br/>
yourself!  I&#39;ve even resorted to hanging up fliers at health food stores <br/>
& libraries looking for like-minded parents. <br/>
Now that summer is here, our local park & rec department has activities <br/>
almost daily, from theatre in the park to game days to puppet shows at <br/>
the library.  A family pass to our public pools is worth every single <br/>
penny, we swim at least 4x week and always talk to someone new while <br/>
we&#39;re there!  Check out the free/cheap activities first, no chance for <br/>
resentment when they hate them ;) <br/>
<br/>
HTH ~ diana :) <br/>
