<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130065899">I&#39;m posting this to the list because it may be of help to some of you.<br/>
<br/>
Our car insurance policy recently renewed (USAA) and in reviewing the<br/>
new policy, I realized that I had not applied for the &quot;Good Student<br/>
Discount&quot; for our 16-year old (the last child living at home who is on<br/>
our policy; we&#39;ve &quot;graduated&quot; the other two! Yippee!). She is considered<br/>
an &quot;occasional driver.&quot; Since we are going to be unschooling beginning<br/>
this fall (she&#39;s been in public school prior to this), I wondered how<br/>
our car insurer would handle the &quot;Good Student Discount&quot; for a<br/>
homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
I called USAA and they said they are happy to provide &quot;Good Student<br/>
Discounts&quot; to homeschooled children. All I need to do is fill out the<br/>
normal required form and mail it in. They said that after the &quot;school<br/>
year,&quot; they &quot;may&quot; ask for grades. I said that would be fine.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to look at your automobile insurance policy and inquire<br/>
as to the same. I appreciate those companies who recognize homeschoolers<br/>
as being eligible for a &quot;Good Student Discount.&quot;<br/>

P.S. There is also a &quot;Driver&#39;s Education&quot; discount available on our<br/>
policy. I wonder if they would allow that discount should her dad or I<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; her driver&#39;s ed. I&#39;ll have to check that out.</div>
