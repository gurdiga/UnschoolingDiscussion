<div id="ygrps-yiv-29812652">I just found out about this from another list.  Did you know that this <br/>
Wednesday is &quot;Spank Out Day USA&quot;?  Well, it&#39;s news to me.  Provided is a <br/>
list of activities for the day.  I like the idea of writing to the newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a website:<br/>

I added that to my still-a-building spanking page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking">http://sandradodd.com/spanking</a><br/>
which is linked from a still-a-building unschooling parenting issues page:<br/>

I&#39;m glad you brought this.  I wish I had done up a collection of stories <br/>
about how it works better without spanking before the last discussion here, <br/>
because I think someone ended up leaving this list over feeling it was <br/>
personal to/about her, that people were saying spanking was bad.<br/>
<br/>
The site above and the collection of unschoolers&#39; testimonials and <br/>
suggestions will help keep others we haven&#39;t even met yet from thinking it&#39;s <br/>
personal if/when the subject arises again!<br/>
