<div id="ygrps-yiv-874580054">&lt;&lt;And what they figure out and piece together on their own will be MUCH more<br/>
set and meaningful&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t agree more.<br/>
<br/>
We have been raising dairy goats this year and learning a tremendous amount.<br/>
We raised a doe, bred it, birthed the babies, castrated, disbudded (so horns<br/>
won&#39;t grow), used herbal medicines and natural feeds, etc..  The kids were<br/>
never quizzed about anything, it wasn&#39;t done for their benefit per se, it<br/>
was just something our family was doing, it was just life.<br/>
<br/>
The other morning, we were all at a little league game and Adriane stayed<br/>
home.  My mom called and talked to her (she lives 600 miles away and doesn&#39;t<br/>
see the kids very often).  Later in the day, I called my mom.  She went on<br/>
and on about how much Adriane knows about goats, the birthing process, the<br/>
whys and hows things are done, how those things are similar to things in<br/>
humans, etc..  She said &quot;It was like a research paper.&quot;  I just smiled but<br/>
I&#39;m thinking &quot;No, its like unschooling.&quot;<br/>

Aaaaah...that is sweet. And so true.<br/>
I helped my ds and dd pull apart a squirrel skeleton in the yard <br/>
yesterday. That was interesting, but I&#39;m thinking it does not compare <br/>
to castrating a goat, ugh!  I think we won&#39;t be getting a mini farm <br/>
anytime soon. LOL<br/>
