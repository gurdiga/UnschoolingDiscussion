&lt;&lt; The Ocarinas are very cool! Made from clay, but apparently archeologists <br/>
have <br/>
found them made from animal horns and gourds. They look like little globs, <br/>
and <br/>
come from the instrument family called vessel flutes. I learned that from one <br/>
of the people playing them. Jack is having fun with it and so am I!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are little wooden ocarinas too.  <br/>
<br/>
I have one of the &quot;potato&quot; ocarinas from the 1970&#39;s.  Blue-glazed clay, kinda <br/>
gourd-or-small-turnip shaped.  And I have a little rosewood ocarina that <br/>
hangs on a string around the neck, and a plastic knock-off of the rosewood ones.<br/>
