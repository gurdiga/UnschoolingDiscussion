&gt; I read this on another list and thought you guys might like to respond, too.<br/>
&gt; Please forward to other homeschoolers if you wish.<br/>

&gt; Apparently, the following was a 1/4 page comic that appeared in the<br/>
&gt; Stillwater Gazette (Stillwater, MN) last Thursday; there were no<br/>
&gt; accompanying<br/>
&gt; articles, just this comic:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   1st frame:  (Mom sitting in chair reading a book to child on the floor)<br/>
&gt;   &quot;My mother says schools are too dangerous, so I go to school at home&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   2nd frame:  (Child standing outside, looking bored) &quot;At recess I go out<br/>
&gt;   and stand in the back yard.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   3rd frame:  (Child going inside) &quot;Then I go back inside&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   4th frame:  (Mom sitting reading again) &quot;And we do more lessons&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   5th frame:  (Child looking out window) &quot;Other recess times I just stare<br/>
&gt;   out the window&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   6th frame:  ( From the outside we see child staring out the window)<br/>
&gt;   &quot;It&#39;s very safe here, away from the world.  My mother says I can have my<br/>
&gt;   childhood later.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   End of comic-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The email address for the newspaper&#39;s editor is:(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:stwgztte@...">stwgztte@...</a>)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please take a moment to let the editor know how you feel.  I think a calm<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; reasoned response reflects better on homeschoolers as a group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
