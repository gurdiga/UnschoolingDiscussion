<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756734721">I read all the invites to Pittsburgh and Ohio and wanted to extend an<br/>
invitation to anyone who may be in the Chicago area and would like to stop<br/>
in.  We are about an hour west of Chicago but very near the train line (I<br/>
could provide transportation to or from the station) There are also some<br/>
things to do out in this part of the state.  We have a guest room with a<br/>
Queen size bed, a pull out couch in the FR, and a futon in the basement plus<br/>
lots of floor space for sleeping bags.  For the outdoorsy types you could<br/>
also &quot;camp&quot; in our gazebo in the backyard!<br/>
