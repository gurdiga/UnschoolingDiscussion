teasers and <br/>
harassers to talk about how to treat<br/>
others.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I took my son out of public school primarily because<br/>
he was being teased and the admin refused to admit it<br/>
or deal with their end of it, instead trying to blame<br/>
the victim, our family. I say make one attempt to<br/>
reason with the people in charge and then let your son<br/>
take the lead. he knows what his own limits are. he<br/>
told you about the problem for a good reason.<br/>
