<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076158794">Just wanted some feedback from the group on this issue. The question <br/>
is this-when and how do you decide that someone is now &quot;reading&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
With my two older girls (13 and 17) who&#39;ve been schooled, the school <br/>
declared that they were, right &quot;on time&quot; with all the other <br/>
kids..oh, yucky untrue stuff there, all right!<br/>
<br/>
With my younger two (ds6 and dd3) who are being unschooled, I&#39;ve <br/>
just never worried about it, to be honest. I&#39;m REALLY not into <br/>
labels of any sort, and I just wanted to treat reading like any <br/>
other skill in the world. I&#39;ve just trusted that David would learn <br/>
to read when he needed to. And he can navigate his way around his <br/>
world just fine now. He asks for words to be read to him on an as-<br/>
needed basis, and then he just seems to digest that for a bit, then <br/>
ask for more.<br/>
<br/>
So, it seems to me that all is right with our world..BUT..the <br/>
question about homeschooling (don&#39;t mention the UN part to anyone <br/>
but you guys, my Mom and dh!)that I seem to get all the time from <br/>
relatives is &quot;So, is he reading yet?&quot;. I can foresee that I&#39;ll get <br/>
this more in the future. Anyone have any good responses to <br/>
this question?<br/>
<br/>

At age 6 &quot;reading&quot; is very broadly interpreted. In schools it&#39;s <br/>
usually about being able to identify letter sounds and tell what <br/>
letter a word starts with and maybe sight read or sound out some <br/>
simple words. It&#39;s not about fluently reading novels or recipe <br/>
directions. <br/>

Your son sounds like he&#39;s on his way to me. :o)<br/>

awesome it is to be able to watch him learn and grow so much. He&#39;s into <br/>
so many things and so smart and, oh my goodness, do you know what he <br/>
said the other day? ........... I&#39;m just so amazed by him sometimes!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I always found it was best to be confident and talk about &#39;progress.&#39;  <br/>
I took the question as an opportunity, assumed the question meant they <br/>
were interested in hearing about the child, and I talked their ear off, <br/>
in fact, about all the interesting and fascinating things the child was <br/>
doing.<br/>

You&#39;re doing what works for you and your children and that&#39;s what <br/>
counts. My son (also David) is 8yo. He learned his letters &quot;on <br/>
schedule&quot; but was &quot;behind&quot; (according to my mom) on putting sounds <br/>
and words together. I&#39;ve been very relaxed about the whole reading <br/>
thing, expecting that it would come when he was ready. He&#39;s been <br/>
learning how to spell a lot of words the past year or so, and we read <br/>
to him all the time. I could see him absorbing and digesting the <br/>
words as we spelled for him and as we read to him.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, we were on a weekend away with my mom, when she asked David <br/>
to read something. He piped up with &quot;I can&#39;t read!&quot; Well, I could see <br/>
in her face what she was thinking, but she didn&#39;t say anything. The <br/>
very next day we were in a bookstore and David picked up a simple <br/>
book (Biscuit) and read the whole thing to me (of course, I helped <br/>
him with any words he couldn&#39;t figure out). Just like that, he&#39;s now <br/>
a reader. He&#39;s into very simple books for now - we&#39;re just moving <br/>
into some of the easier Step 1 books about animals. He&#39;ll stay at <br/>
this level for as long as he needs then he&#39;ll move up on his own. He <br/>
reads to me every day and he chose when to move into a slightly more <br/>
difficult book.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing - he told me last week &quot;Mom, I love to read.&quot; That&#39;s <br/>
what I wanted to hear from him. I don&#39;t want to raise a child who <br/>
reads because he&#39;s supposed to. I want to raise a child who loves to <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
I was planning to wait longer (years) if that&#39;s what he needed. It <br/>
would have gotten more and more difficult (for me), but I was willing <br/>
to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you.<br/>
