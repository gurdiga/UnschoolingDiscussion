The question was <br/>
&quot;Here is a question that is pretty much on every guys  mind. How do you <br/>
convince your g/f, fiance, or wife to play a video game with  you?&quot;<br/>

Part of  the answer:<br/>
#4 - If you have kids, video games are probably a big part of their lives  <br/>
and playing together is an important part of parenting. If she works with kids,  <br/>
playing the current games is a great way to relate to them. I found this <br/>
website  as a great collection of positive influences video games have on <br/>
children: _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games/page_">http://sandradodd.com/games/page_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games/page)">http://sandradodd.com/games/page)</a> <br/>

I got fan mail last week from a high school student writing a paper,  too.  <br/>
