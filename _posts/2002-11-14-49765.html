 </span></blockquote>-- Well, it&#39;s not the only teaching situation available, but it is <br/>
VERY affordable. We&#39;re only paying $35 for the entire semester, plus <br/>
the $25/mo. or so that the rental costs. We couldn&#39;t even come close <br/>
to that kind of bargain with private or semi-private lessons. Of <br/>
course, I knew we couldn&#39;t expect perfection at that price but right <br/>
now it was this program or nothing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-- Thanks for this! I&#39;d love any suggestions about how to go about <br/>
it. I&#39;ve been told that these types of instruments (meaning <br/>
xylophones/marimbas etc.) can&#39;t be rented and therefore lessons <br/>
connected with some kind of school or university are about the only <br/>
way to go (you use the school&#39;s instruments). I just got the name of <br/>
the percussions instructor at the same university that is giving the <br/>
group strings lessons so I&#39;ll be calling him soon. But I&#39;d like to <br/>
know of other options, if y&#39;all know of any.<br/>
