&lt;&lt; This story about your daughter&#39;s vet experiences needs to put into one<br/>
of the &quot;Unschooling is fabulous&quot; type folders that some people are<br/>
hosting!! How delightful - another convert (ie the vet) - hope he has<br/>
some children of his own one day. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve saved it, and I&#39;m willing to try to find it an online home, but when I <br/>
write such a page, it&#39;s going to be hard to get parents to GET it.<br/>
<br/>
We had a discussion after the conference, some of us, about how unschooled <br/>
kids with jobs are GREAT employees, really responsible, not shirkers, and how <br/>
some of them get jobs without ever applying for them, they&#39;re offered jobs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s complex, though.  <br/>
<br/>
Just like with &quot;Moving a Puddle,&quot; you can&#39;t go around looking for a job to <br/>
luck into.  You have to go around looking at what&#39;s right in front of you and <br/>
doing what seems best and good and fun, and doing it without thought to whether <br/>
it will turn into more.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s simple from that end.  Just be, and be happy, and be helpful, and don&#39;t <br/>
be desperate.<br/>
<br/>
If moms go out and say &quot;Other unschoolers have had epiphonal moments helping <br/>
with bulk mailings or cleaning out vets&#39; cages, so I would like for you to <br/>
take this, my child you have never met before, and let him clean cages or do mass <br/>
mailings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not how it works.<br/>
<br/>
How it DOES work is harder to describe than how it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>

about 6 years ago so he could pursue sports related fields that interested<br/>
him. Ever since then jobs have fallen into this lap. He just talks to people<br/>
who enjoy the same things he does and when they have an opening or hear of<br/>
an opening they think of him.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s doing what he enjoys and the jobs are coming to him, just the way it&#39;s<br/>
supposed to happen for unschoolers who go after what they enjoy. :-)<br/>

is not a really outgoing,  &quot;conversation initiating&quot; person.  But, she LOVES <br/>
babies, and once she feels comfortable with thier parents, she opens up and <br/>
really connects with the kids.   She got her first jobs just by going to play <br/>
group with us, she being the oldest kid there.   She would just play with the <br/>
little kids,  that is how she got her first job as a Mommy&#39;s helper.   She then <br/>
got a job watching some of the kids during a bible study on Thursday nights.   <br/>
As folks started asking her about babysitting, she made a resume to hand out. <br/>
  Another mother from our play group asked her to babysit for her a couple of <br/>
times, and that led her hiring Anna to watch the children at a 3 day training <br/>
conference for some local La Leche League leaders.  ( it was 3 mornings, <br/>
9-12)   Anna watched 6 kids during the meetings.  And, one of those mothers called <br/>
her and she has sat for her twice.!   Last week, she earned almost $100 <br/>
babysitting.  She now has business cards and she has started making a <br/>
calandar/schedule to keep up with her jobs.   She had to turn someone down for Sunday <br/>
afternoon because we are going camping.   She started volunteering at a local <br/>
preschool this week, and I am sure this will lead to more baby sitting jobs.   <br/>
<br/>
 Anna has such a love for children, and a deep understanding and wisdom about <br/>
what they need how to interact with them.   She feels more comfortable when <br/>
it&#39;s just her and the kids,  I think she feels somewhat inhibited when thier <br/>
parents are hovering, like they are holding her under close scrutiny.. And, I&#39;m <br/>
sure they are.. LOL. .After all, most mothers want to be sure and confident <br/>
with thier babysitter.   But, as she gets to know the children and the parents <br/>
better, it is almost always a great connection for everyone.   She has watched <br/>
some kids that she did not like the way the parents treated the kids, and she <br/>
would not agree to &quot;punish&quot; them when thier parents were gone.    She felt so <br/>
bad for the kids, but she was glad to not be called back to watch them.   She <br/>
has a plan ( and it could change at any time).. that she wants to continue her <br/>
babysitting jobs,  study early childhood probably at a community college, <br/>
then get Montessori Training and open her own Montessori School.    But she also <br/>
wants to have a big family and stay at home and unschool them.    The good <br/>
thing about it is, she can have that plan for now, and she can change it, modify <br/>
it, drop it, or continue to pursue it.   <br/>
