<div id="ygrps-yiv-664138536">Another reason the tests don&#39;t mean much is some folks are good at taking<br/>
tests and some aren&#39;t.  I&#39;m a whiz at them, unfortunately!  Back in the dark<br/>
ages, at least in CA, if you reached the ol&#39; Mensa level once they tested<br/>
the heck out of you for the balance of your years in p.s.<br/>
<br/>
If a child isn&#39;t a visual learner they are going to have a harder time with<br/>
the tests.  Doesn&#39;t mean their IQ is any lower, simply that they don&#39;t do as<br/>
well with that type of test.<br/>
<br/>
A guy I went ot high school with was the most brilliant person I ever knew<br/>
and scored barely above the 70s.  If you set a test in front of him, he<br/>
froze!  He never did that well in school because of testing but four years<br/>
out of high school he had retired on a part he invented for the space<br/>
program.<br/>
<br/>
IMNSHO, tests are just one more thing straight out of the inquisition and<br/>
probably invented by the same guy that invented hospital gowns!  Cruel and<br/>
unusual punishment &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; I mentioned it because it was part of the point that they are<br/>
&gt; meaningless.  Easy to say if you score badly, harder to say if you score<br/>
&gt; well.  &quot;Tests&quot; because we consider them games.  We LIKE taking them.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Usually&quot; because if we are tired or run down or having a bad day or<br/>
&gt; distracted or not really paying attention we sometimes don&#39;t break the<br/>
&gt; MENSA level.<br/>

The tests we had in 8th grade had a visual section.  it was kind of an <br/>
engineering/spatial-looking thing.  They&#39;d show a shape/object, and you chose <br/>
the one that would fit into it/next to it.  I thought those were fun.  I <br/>
think it was Stanford-Binet, but maybe ITBS.<br/>

<br/>
I have a friend named Ted Martinez.  When we were in sixth grade, his dad was <br/>
a fireman in Los Alamos, and died rescuing someone from a housefire.  He was <br/>
a big hero, but Ted got quiet.  All the rest of Jr. High and High school and <br/>
college I was around Ted, and watched him as he scored average, 80th <br/>
percentile, didn&#39;t pay attention and got Bs in English, and forgot when his <br/>
test was, and I could see his dad in his eyes a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Ted finished college without a glitch, went to law school, married a really <br/>
sweet and bright lady, lost his right arm in an accident while he was hanging <br/>
bunting or flags over a road for a parade once, is a lawyer in the federal <br/>
courts here and everyone who knows him loves him.<br/>
<br/>
If test scores determined life, Ted would be working at Taco Bell, but he&#39;s <br/>
one of the most successful and happy people  I know.<br/>
<br/>
I really hate tests.  Since homeschoolers don&#39;t have paychecks to justify and <br/>
aren&#39;t applying for federal, state, or district funding (usually), and we <br/>
don&#39;t need to identify some of our kids for special ed or gifted programs, I <br/>
think we should just say no to testing.<br/>

<br/>
I agree.  I live in a state that does not require testing for<br/>
homeschoolers and some parents still request it.  I really don&#39;t<br/>
understand this.  <br/>
