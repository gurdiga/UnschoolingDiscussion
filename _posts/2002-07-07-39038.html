&lt;&lt; he said, &quot;So this is sort <br/>
of like a line graph right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, it IS a line graph,&quot; and he said, <br/>
&quot;I know how to do that, you find the slope.&quot; As if that was the point of it. <br/>
Absolutely no comprehension of any meaning of what he was doing. Zero. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;meaning&quot; to him was performance and grade-getting.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know HOW many times I asked math teachers &quot;What is this GOOD for?&quot; <br/>
and they were unable or unwilling to tell me.  Maybe that line-graph gifted <br/>
kid will grow up to be a math professor!!  Or a midschool teacher.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly and I were playing &quot;Math Arena&quot; last night, and went through several of <br/>
the games but stayed longest on one called &quot;Array Reversal.&quot;  It&#39;s filling in <br/>
a 10x10 set of little squares by choosing one of three numbers and <br/>
&quot;mouse-marking&quot;  a rectangle of them.  If you choose 20, you can select a 4x5 <br/>
block, or a 2x10 block, in either direction.   Holly beats me at that game.   <br/>
She doesn&#39;t know what to do with 27, so she skips it.  She doesn&#39;t like 24 <br/>
because 2x12 isn&#39;t an option, so she skips it.  She likes 30 fine.  She LOVES <br/>
6. It&#39;s a time-race to fill the grid.   I &quot;know times tables&quot; better than <br/>
Holly, but Holly has no shame about taking two easy moves instead of one <br/>
glory move like &quot;32.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In school they taught us to add columns of numbers.  I guess that was so we <br/>
could become bookkeepers and work by hand as though it were 1915.  But even <br/>
my aged father-in-law has a mechanical adding machine.  (He hasn&#39;t upgraded <br/>
to a calculator.)   He is a number-saving fanatic, and doesn&#39;t add columns of <br/>
numbers.<br/>
<br/>
But because they taught it in school I thought it was &quot;the right way&quot; and the <br/>
only good way.  So I hid the fact that my quickest way of adding was to add <br/>
two  numbers together, and then add the third, and then add the fourth.<br/>
<br/>
I took up with a math guy, and eventually married him.  I confessed one day <br/>
that I didn&#39;t really add columns of numbers.  He said &quot;Oh, you do it like a <br/>
computer does it.  Like a calculator does.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Well cool!  Only I had spent years ashamed of doing it &quot;wrong,&quot; of not doing <br/>
it the way Miss Brown TOLD me to do it when I was eight years old.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another story for your math trauma collection, Pam.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a major peeve of mine.  I had a chemistry teacher tell us once that <br/>
we should know how to do paper-and-pencil arithmetic really well because some <br/>
day we might be taking the SAT or something and the batteries in our <br/>
calculators might give out.  These days you can use a calculator on the SAT.  <br/>
The interesting thing is that a calculator will not help you for most of the <br/>
problems.  What WILL help is good mathematical intuition, not arithmetic - <br/>
they&#39;re not the same thing.<br/>
       Even if you can do long division in your head, you may not know that <br/>
it&#39;s based on the distributive property.  The reason so many parents and <br/>
educators stress basic arithmetic is because they think it will teach you <br/>
something deeper about math than using a calculator, but I don&#39;t buy it.  I <br/>
would bet a lot of money that few kids who know long division would be able <br/>
to tell you it&#39;s an appplication of the distributive property.<br/>
       If the educational establishment was actually serious about the &quot;you <br/>
might need this some day&quot; excuse for teaching you something, we&#39;d be learning <br/>
very different things.  There are few things more essential to life than <br/>
growing food.  What if there were another national emergency like WWII, and <br/>
people had to turn their yards into gardens?  You might need to know how to <br/>
make your own bread or slaughter an animal some day, but no one is learning <br/>
that in schools these days.<br/>
       I hope I&#39;m making sense.<br/>
       If I had to guess I would say that fewer than 10% of people need to <br/>
know any math beyond the 7th grade level.  And a lot of people would be <br/>
better off if they understood 7th grade math in greater depth and how to <br/>
apply it better.  So what is math beyond 7th grade good for?  I think it&#39;s a <br/>
subconscious conspiracy.  Schools don&#39;t teach higher math because kids need <br/>
to know it.  The neat thing about math is that for grading and judging young <br/>
peoples&#39; &quot;intelligence,&quot; it&#39;s very handy.  Your answer is either right or <br/>
wrong.  It&#39;s not messy, like history.  Educators can pretend that they are <br/>
being very objective (and therefore fair) when grading math tests.  Nevermind <br/>
that the emphasis on higher math is a subjective choice on the part of <br/>
educators.  <br/>

to tears by long division in 4th grade?  ;)<br/>

<br/>
REALLY GOOD POINT.<br/>
<br/>
I think the reason they want all kids to come out of high school knowing as <br/>
much math and science as possible is so we can whup the Soviets.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.  The educational establishment gets something into their <br/>
slow-moving &quot;head&quot; and they have NO mechanism for letting go of it, ever.<br/>
<br/>
In the 60&#39;s math and science were our &quot;victory gardens,&quot; what each person <br/>
could do to contribute to national security.  Now they do it because they&#39;ve <br/>
just &quot;always&quot; done it. <br/>
<br/>
And if we had the system some countries have where there was clearly a <br/>
college-bound track, and then a vocational track (splitting out at puberty, <br/>
generally), more kids would be prepared for &quot;real life,&quot; but many would NOT <br/>
be prepared to become surgeons, and America needs things to be equal and fair <br/>
and equitable and so EVERYONE can become a surgeon.  Only those who are lazy <br/>
don&#39;t bother.  So being a surgeon is seen as virtue, and being &quot;just&quot; most <br/>
other things is seen as sloth.<br/>
<br/>
Our system isn&#39;t so great at all.  But it&#39;s &quot;fair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yuck.<br/>
