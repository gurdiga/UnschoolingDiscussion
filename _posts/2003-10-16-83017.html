I just finished his new book, &quot;Dude, where&#39;s my country?&quot; and he continues <br/>
his discussion of *fear in the media* ~ how different our world would be if a <br/>
different adjective was chosen (i.e. Millionaires attack WTC instead of <br/>
Terrorists).  This family could have been described by several other ~ equally <br/>
terrifying~ adjectives.  CBS merely decided to attack Homeschoolers with their story. <br/>
