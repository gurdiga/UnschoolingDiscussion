&lt;&lt; One should walk in the shoes perhaps first of a <br/>
shouting/hollering/screaming<br/>
 family. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   I agree. I am from an Irish Catholic <br/>
yelling,screaming,stomping,cursing,family and it works. Usually. There are a <br/>
few in our family who shame and blame, verbal abuse. That is not right in my <br/>
opinion. Much more harmful than yelling.I never have or will verbally abuse <br/>
my child but I will yell. Because it is in me and it happens. She is also a <br/>
yeller and has been a very loud child since the day she was born. I remember <br/>
trying so hard to keep her a tad quieter in the hospital. No maternity ward <br/>
here,everyone else was in for knee surgery it seemed.One hall of patients. :o)<br/>
<br/>
   Dh is also from a family of yellers Italian this time. Now he went the <br/>
other way and rarely yells. But when he does watch out. So I think I&#39;d rather <br/>
let it out in its initial   stages. &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
    It comes down to what you are saying,words hurt worse than tone.<br/>

&lt;&lt; ery personal question, but would you have rather that he not be a part of <br/>
 your life at all? <br/>
 <br/>
 i ask because my ex is in rehab right now. i wonder is a touch and go, empty <br/>
 promise father better than no father at all?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Very tough question. I am trying to think what kind of imprint my father <br/>
made on me and my life. <br/>
<br/>
    I did date men w/ his patterns as a teen. I did however marry a complete <br/>
opposite.Thank God!<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
    I know I&#39;m not answering your question. I am glad I knew my father. On <br/>
the flip side my cousins father left her mother when she was pregnant. he was <br/>
an alcoholic and flaky. Later they found eachother and it was disappointing. <br/>
All her life she wanted to know her father. I think it would have been better <br/>
to know him as a child instead of forming an image then having it blown.<br/>
<br/>
   As a parent it is a really tough call. I am sure there were times my <br/>
mother didn&#39;t want to send me on that plane. She did and I am glad b/c I know <br/>
my father. I do believe I had some great guides that kept me alive.Still do I <br/>
am sure. :o) <br/>

My mother&#39;s family is a mix of many things including<br/>
Italian and Irish Catholic *and* Protestant- and this<br/>
is where my loudness comes from - when I read the word<br/>
Catholic it reminded me of how loud even our *wakes*<br/>
are! And I&#39;m not talking wailing - just loud talk,<br/>
laughter, children in an adjoining room - louder than<br/>
most people&#39;s parties! (Actually much of this has<br/>
calmed down with my generation, as not all my cousins<br/>
are loud, and we don&#39;t bring our children to wakes<br/>
except for their grandparents, and some don&#39;t even<br/>
bring them then.)<br/>
