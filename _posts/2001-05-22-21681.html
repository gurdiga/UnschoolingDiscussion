<div id="ygrps-yiv-668537352">The book is a lie!  Pure and simple.  It does not come with a disclaimer nor<br/>
does the movie.  Further, it is offensive to a large segment of the American<br/>
Indian population, particularly the Cherokee.  It is no different than if it<br/>
were to be discovered that The Diary of Anne Frank were written by Hitler or<br/>
The Color Purple were written by a white supremist.<br/>
<br/>
And, because it gets itself recategorized on some list does not change how<br/>
it is presented to the general public NOW, still even though it has been<br/>
recategorized as fiction.  In various current reviews it is presented as:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Themes:  ethnic/racial identity, Indian history&quot;<br/>

&quot;Historically real&quot; Reviewer: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ricks@...">ricks@...</a> from Salt Lake City, Utah, USA<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The super-seller memoir of a Cherokee boyhood in the 1930s.  The most<br/>
sensitive and evocative *autobiography* . . .  Amazon.com<br/>
<br/>
It is one of the most accepted books in ps for teaching Indian culture.  It<br/>
is a fraud and as such it cannot teach as it has no factual basis.  It is<br/>
pure new-age bunk and garbage.  If one wants to read his other books, great.<br/>
No one was saying he wasn&#39;t a good author or that one shouldn&#39;t read his<br/>
books.  He created a new personna so he could &quot;sell&quot; Indian heritage, as<br/>
such he is a fraud!<br/>
<br/>
You get a little carried away here.  No one was rejecting the bulk of his<br/>
work.  No one was judging his ability as an author.  The judgement was on<br/>
his lies.  He is NOT Cherokee, he was NOT an orphan, it is NOT an<br/>
autobiography.  I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patooty if he hangs from a tree, quotes<br/>
Hale and spends all his time reading Hustler as long as he doesn&#39;t claim to<br/>
be Indian and try to sell his lies as being the real article.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious, though, how can one be inspired or philosophical over a book<br/>
of lies.  How does one find inspiration or find its &quot;philosophy&quot; useful if<br/>
one knows the whole book is based on a lie and that a good percentage of<br/>
what he wrote as being &quot;the Cherokee way&quot; or words from the Cherokee<br/>
language were things he made up?<br/>

&gt; Lynda, you wrote<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; And before anyone gets their bloomers in a bunch or knots in their<br/>
thong<br/>
&gt; (which is probably more current &lt;g&gt;) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would like to ask as calmly and respectfully as possible that you try<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; to be so antagonistic and insulting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Education of Little Tree is indeed fraudulent as it was originally<br/>
&gt; presented.  It was published by the University of New Mexico Press and so<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; unfolding of the discovery was big in local news.  In the long run, the<br/>
book<br/>
&gt; was recategorized as fiction and is still found useful by lots of people<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; its philosophy and inspiration, I suppose, which is what lots of novels<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; good for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not defending the book.  I haven&#39;t read it.  I have friends who have<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; liked it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m defending balance and calm.  Lots of writers and artists and musicians<br/>
&gt; were drunks or addicts or perverts or gamblers or whatever.  We&#39;re not<br/>
&gt; building religions out of them.  I see no reason to reject all of an<br/>
artist&#39;s<br/>
&gt; product because of his or her political or sexual or biochemical bent.  I<br/>
&gt; know some people will disagree with me.  Photographs by a heterosexual<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; no discovered sexual misconduct are more respected by some people (whether<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re good or not) than photographs by someone who is gay or lesbian.<br/>
&gt; People who believe that way would probably not say &quot;gay or lesbian,&quot;<br/>
though.<br/>
&gt; Prejudices are all around us and it seems to me we might as well not make<br/>
&gt; them worse unnecessarily.<br/>
