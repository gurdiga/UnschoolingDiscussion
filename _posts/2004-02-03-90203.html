Thank you for helping me look at it in a different way. It *is* hard not to <br/>
see the replies as personally directed when they are but I obviously need to <br/>
practice that (and a lot else it seems!). I fossick around in other threads <br/>
and <br/>
quite often come up with a gem that could help me so I can see your <br/>
point.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
I love words, but it&#39;s rare that I see one on a list that I don&#39;t know. <br/>
Thanks for this one! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Have you seen the 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue?   I thought of<br/>
you and Sandra when I saw it.  Not that you&#39;re vulgar, you understand.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
School of Venus was one name for a brothel. <br/>
Dishclout was a dirty, greasy woman<br/>
A grave was sometimes called an earth bath. <br/>
A Hempen widow was someone who&#39;s husband had been hanged.<br/>

drunkenness.)  <br/>

easier?<br/>

Nancy you don&#39;t strike me as the crapulous type. &lt;g&gt;  With three broken<br/>
arms, ( wait, that&#39;s not right, one arm broken three times) I can<br/>
understand you&#39;d be seriously quanked though.<br/>
<br/>
How are your kids?  Isn&#39;t it nice of me to ask you questions and make you<br/>
type one handed? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Deb, i am doing so well and so are the kids. We are in fact having a <br/>
fabulous time with this staying home thing!!!! I am typing 2 handed thank  you very <br/>
much, as the now plated arm works already, just can&#39;t bear weight with it, or <br/>
pull on stuff. The wonders of medicine!(GAG) Actually, this is amazing. I had <br/>
the staples out today and dd wants to know where they went.<br/>
On the unschooling side of things, perhaps this has happened for a reason. As <br/>
from the depths of my despair I found the ability to look inwards,(gag <br/>
again). I see that I was avoiding my kids a bit, using the TV, the phone etc to not <br/>
do stuff with them and calling it unschooling.I  now am having a great time <br/>
being WITH my kids, we watch TV and play x-box, read, do puzzles, giggle, and <br/>
lots more. I think I am getting this. I have been reading lots at the message <br/>
boards, and tho I believed I knew what I was doing, now I know more.<br/>
Ds Tommy, 8, announced that he was not sure he wanted a friend over the other <br/>
day as he was having fun just being with us, his family, and doing stuff <br/>
together.That is after 1 week without seeing another kid. Pretty cool!!! Of course <br/>
he was happy to get together with his buddy, but he is less antsy to always <br/>
have friends around. <br/>
Now aren&#39;t you sorry you asked? I appreciate your interest.<br/>
