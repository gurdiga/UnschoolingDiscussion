<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536981177">Hi Johanna,<br/>
We live in Missouri, its a great place to unschool! We have 3 daughters,<br/>
ages 16,10 and 5yrs..and have been homeschooling for 8 yrs.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re moving to our new mini-homestead in April.. we are all so excited and<br/>
already planning on goats, sheep, chickens and maybe a horse or two!  We<br/>
rent a place in the country now..and I raise Silkie bantams. I used to have<br/>
goats and have missed them allot. I look forward to making cheese and yogurt<br/>
again!  My friends Pyre just had pups, and I&#39;m thinking of taking one of<br/>
them?? we already have two stock dogs. I also can and garden. This past<br/>
year, I bought a grain mill to grind my own wheat for breadmaking too.<br/>
<br/>
We have went more and more towards &#39;unschooling&#39; as the years went by, it<br/>
was hard for me to let go completely, but now I wonder what took me so long!<br/>
<br/>
I am not very good at record keeping..but do try to keep a portfolio for the<br/>
two younger girls. Mostly just for the fun of looking back at the end of the<br/>
year to see all the places we have been too and campgrounds we have stayed<br/>
at! My girls are all into art, so there are lots of drawings and paintings,<br/>
plus photos of the sculptures and rock paintings they have done.  My eldest<br/>
stays busy with piano, gymnastics, a part-time job, caring for her Iguana,<br/>
and learning how to build huts in the woods! LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239242074">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Yet another Kiwi here!! I have four children and they are all unschooled<br/>
(they have never been to school). We live on Waiheke Island in New Zealand<br/>
along with four cats and a Maremma Sheepdog puppy, very similar to the Great<br/>
Pyrs that seem to be a required accessory for many unschooling families<br/>
judging by the board!! LOL<br/>
<br/>
My eldest daughter is 11 years old (12 in August) and my baby will be three<br/>
in a couple of weeks. I am a single mother and although I didn&#39;t believe it<br/>
when I started out I find that unschooling now is the most natural and<br/>
joy-filled way for my family to live!<br/>
<br/>
I just want to say a Huge thank you to Sandra here because while I was<br/>
finding my way in unschooling I used to lurk and read her &quot;radical&quot; comments<br/>
and although I lacked the courage to actually verbalise these ideas myself,<br/>
they took root in my heart! My kids lives have been enriched by the presence<br/>
of Sandra in their lives although they probably wouldn&#39;t recognise her<br/>
name - so Sandra if you are reading this - THANKS!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Namaste,<br/>
Brooke</div>

<br/>
Thanks for the kind words, too.  I sent them to a friend of mine who will <br/>
think a little more of me now (instead of just thinking that I spend my day <br/>
tormenting other homeschoolers just so I don&#39;t have to mop the kitchen).<br/>

<br>I enjoy everyone&#39;s comments. Just goes to show what a diversity there
