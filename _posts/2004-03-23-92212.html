&lt;&lt; We are talking about an 18 month old.lol. So yes we too have lots of <br/>
paper. This isn&#39;t about searching out wall-space. It&#39;s about learning what&#39;s <br/>
considered acceptable. I&#39;m just trying to understand how others do it without always <br/>
resorting to the &quot;NO&quot; word.:-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keep all the pens up.  But he&#39;s two days older now than when you first asked, <br/>
and will be a month older next month, so the discussion about how to enable <br/>
kids to do what they want to do is still a good one for you and already was <br/>
good for others reading.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something Joyce wrote about saying yes a while back:<br/>

reading this list when Joyce posted that, and it rocked my world.  I <br/>
just saved it to my Favorites, to look at when I forget.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the spirit of saying yes, yes, yes, what about an upright <br/>
chalkboard or dry erase easel?  What about painting a section of a <br/>
basement wall with that chalkboard paint?  Is there any exposed <br/>
drywall or plywood that your child could color on and you could paint <br/>
on later?  Or any wall that you can paint a dark color later and you <br/>
can let them color right on the paint?  How about painting some <br/>
boards that they can color?<br/>
<br/>
Will they lend their colorful painted handprints to a section of the <br/>
wall or a board that you&#39;d like to decorate?  Then they&#39;re helping <br/>
make something that you all think is pretty.<br/>
<br/>
On this particular issue, you get to make the call on what&#39;s <br/>
acceptable.  Finding creative solutions will be very acceptable as <br/>
they grow older -- and you will have helped them learn that skill.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I loved all your answers Amy. I wanted to add one suggestion from a friend of mine. She <br/>
lets her kids draw on their bedroom walls. They can write messages, song lyrics or draw <br/>
pictures. I wish I had known that when I had toddlers! There&#39;s no reason they can&#39;t write <br/>
on the walls of a bedroom as little ones and then just paint over it when they are older. My <br/>
kids all have that freedom and only one has taken me up on it.<br/>
<br/>
We heard Missie Elliot (female rapper) say at an awards ceremony: Thank you Mom for <br/>
letting me write so many poems and lyrics on my bedroom walls growing up. :)<br/>
<br/>
Confirmed for me the value of letting our kids create the space that works for them, even <br/>
when they are small...<br/>
