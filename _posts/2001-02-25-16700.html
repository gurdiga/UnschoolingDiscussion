<br>It&#39;s an aol indication that the e-mail has html stuff--if you could see the 
<br>color and all, it would be in color. &nbsp;Depending on your version and your 
<br>settings, you might see it in color, or you might just see another version of 
<br>the text down below with html commands about font and size, etc.</font></font></html></div>
