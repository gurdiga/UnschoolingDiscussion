<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013542443">Hello dear listmates!<br/>
<br/>
My son, Bay (12), is asking for some computer games to &quot;do some cool math &<br/>
other stuff&quot; - which I am happy to provide. But, when I look on websites I<br/>
am completely overwhelmed by the sheer volume and inadequate descriptions<br/>
of them. We already own (and he plays often) Age of Empires and Motocross<br/>
Madness and Harry Potter. But, I was looking at Carmen SanDiego and the<br/>
like this time around -as his request was more specific this time around.<br/>
Any tried and true ones your pre-teens enjoy? <br/>
<br/>
By the way, I was really impressed with Ingrid&#39;s post today about sexuality<br/>
- the first one that really resonated with me as being realistic. <br/>
<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>
