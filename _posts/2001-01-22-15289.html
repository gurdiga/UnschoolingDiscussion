&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; PRESIDENT BUSH ANNOUNCES RELIGIOUS AGENDA ON INAUGURATION DAY<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;BUSH PRESENTS HIMSELF AS &#39;DETERMINED FOE OF<br/>
&gt; &gt;CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION,&#39; SAYS AMERICANS UNITED<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;George W. Bush, sworn in today as the nation&#39;s 43rd president, announced<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;religious agenda in his inaugural address, including an emphasis on using<br/>
&gt; &gt;houses of worship for providing publicly financed social services.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just moments after being sworn in as president, Bush used a speech laced<br/>
&gt; &gt;with religious rhetoric to explain the role religion will play in his<br/>
&gt; &gt;administration.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;[S]ome needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;touch or a pastor&#39;s prayer,&quot; Bush said. &quot;Church and charity, synagogue<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;mosque, lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>honored<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;place in our plans and laws.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for<br/>
&gt; &gt;Separation of Church and State, expressed concern about Bush&#39;s comments.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Bush apparently believes he was elected national preacher as well as<br/>
&gt; &gt;president,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;The newly elected president presented himself<br/>
 </span></blockquote>today<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;as a determined foe of church-state separation. The Constitution he swore<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;uphold simply does not permit the president to merge religion and<br/>
&gt; &gt;government.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Churches and other houses of worship play a cherished role in our<br/>
 </span></blockquote>society,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;but they do not have a role in our secular laws,&quot; Lynn added. &quot;Bush&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;remarks showed a gross insensitivity to the constitutional principle of<br/>
&gt; &gt;government neutrality on religion.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bush also used his inaugural address to emphasize his plans for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>education,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;remarking, &quot;Together, we will reclaim America&#39;s schools, before ignorance<br/>
&gt; &gt;and apathy claim more young lives.&quot; News agencies were reporting today<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Bush will unveil an education plan on Tuesday that will feature vouchers<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt;religious and other private schools.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Far too much of Bush&#39;s agenda calls for a unity between church and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>state,&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;noted AU&#39;s Lynn. &quot;To protect the religious liberties of all Americans,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>his<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;plans must be rejected by Congress.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In one of his first acts as the nation&#39;s chief executive, Bush issued a<br/>
&gt; &gt;proclamation ordering today as a &quot;national day of prayer.&quot; Bush, in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;proclamation, called &quot;upon the citizens of our Nation to gather together<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;homes and places of worship to pray alone and together and offer<br/>
&gt; &gt;thanksgiving to God for all the blessings of this great and good land.&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;added, &quot;I ask Americans to bow our heads in humility before our Heavenly<br/>
&gt; &gt;Father, a God who calls us not to judge our neighbors, but to love them,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;ask His guidance upon our Nation and its leaders in every level of<br/>
&gt; &gt;government.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Ironically, Bush quoted Thomas Jefferson both in his inaugural address<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;his day of prayer proclamation. Jefferson, a staunch advocate of<br/>
&gt; &gt;church-state separation, never issued a prayer proclamation in order to<br/>
&gt; &gt;preserve government neutrality on religious matters.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Bush would have been wise to follow Jefferson&#39;s example and allow<br/>
&gt; Americans<br/>
&gt; &gt;to make up their own minds about how and when to pray,&quot; said AU&#39;s Lynn.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;It<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;would have gotten the Bush presidency off to a much better start.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;The Bush Administration is only a few hours old and it already has<br/>
&gt; signaled<br/>
&gt; &gt;remarkable hostility for church-state separation,&quot; concluded Lynn.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Anyone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;concerned with this nation&#39;s religious liberties should realize that the<br/>
&gt; &gt;next four years will be awfully busy.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization represents 60,000 members and<br/>

I read somewhere this past week that 70% of Americans believe the <br/>
words&quot;separation of church and state&quot; appear in the constitution.   My <br/>
husband and I have been researching the constitution together, sound romantic <br/>
or what!  Kimme</div>

to His Fraudulency, the great Dumbya there weren&#39;t any American Indians in<br/>
Texas when he was govenor, so I am sure he will expand that belief now that<br/>
he is in the White House and embrace the policy of political genocide<br/>
(otherwise known as blood guantum) so that there won&#39;t be any in the entire<br/>

Not sure what is was I said that would lead someone to conclude that I would <br/>
favor such an office.  I do not.  However, do we invent new portions of the <br/>
constitution in order to prevent the president from something he MIGHT do?  <br/>
All of life is a risk and there is always a danger of one religious viewpoint <br/>
being pushed on others.  It is happening now and will continue to happen.  <br/>
That is why checks and balances were instituted.  Not even these will keep <br/>
things &quot;fair&quot; for everyone all of the time.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is to act with integrity (not lie about what is in the <br/>
constitution) and act in accordance with the ideals of the constitution then <br/>
hope for the best.  It&#39;s important to see an imbalance BEFORE it tips out of <br/>
our favor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714350640">What a time for an introduction LOL!  My name is Patti and I have just <br/>
begun &#39;schooling&#39; my 5yo at home, despite much protest from the elder man <br/>
of the house.  I&#39;ve been lurking for awhile but had to come out and join in <br/>
on this topic :).  I do not see OFBS as a good thing.  Many charitable <br/>
groups, such as Goodwill, Salvation Army, etc. will not help those who are <br/>
not Christian.  There have been stories from other religious groups that <br/>
attest to that fact, as well as a few people that I know of who it has <br/>
happened to.  I am worried about the new administration, as Dubya already <br/>
stated that &#39;Witchcraft is not a religion&#39; when good old Barr was making a <br/>
ruckus about the Texas Pagans in the military.  So with Barr re-elected, <br/>
Dubya in the big house and (gulp) Ashcroft waiting in the wings, it&#39;s gonna <br/>
be a real bumpy ride for the next four years!<br/>

Patti the Pagan :).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153894970">Erin,<br/>
   I&#39;m not speaking for Kris at all. Those were my words.  Those are my<br/>
questions.  And it&#39;s me who is fiercely afraid of the fire we&#39;re playing<br/>
with.  I&#39;ve watched the homeschooling community be divided along religous<br/>
lines now for over 12 years.  I really don&#39;t want the same thing happening<br/>
at the federal level.  I realize that all might turn out well, and I<br/>
sincerely hope so, but I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t at least voice my<br/>
concerns.<br/>
<br/>
The words *under God* were added to our national pledge in the 1950&#39;s.  &#39;54<br/>
I believe.  If you visit the unschooling message boards you can find a<br/>
wonderful discussion about the pledge.  Just do a keyword search.<br/>
<br/>
And I also disagree whole heartedly about the seperation of church and<br/>
state.  Thomas Paine has some interesting writings on the topic, as does<br/>
Thomas Jefferson.  The men and women who we elect surely need to be<br/>
upstanding and knowing they have a faith that sustains them is a wonderful<br/>
thing.  But our government does not have one religious foundation it must<br/>
adhere to. Our government is based on ****the people**** and we are<br/>
currently a pluarity of 288 million people.  All of us need to be present<br/>
and represented within our republic. To believe it is just for Jews and<br/>
Christians to run this nation is to turn your back on the very document that<br/>
begins with &quot;We The People.&quot;  A document we honor when we let it live and<br/>
grow right along beside us.<br/>
<br/>
LisaKK<br/>
<br/>
ps  Last Wed I watched a homeschooling mom tell her children, in front of<br/>
me.... if someone asks if you are a Christian, lie and say yes.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t want to deal with anything else today.  Is this the kind of nation we<br/>
want?  Where people are so pelted with judgements and hassled they tell<br/>
their children to lie?<br/>
