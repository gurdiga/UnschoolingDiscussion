 </span></blockquote>Yes, I am now a strict vegetarian. No meat, dairy, or eggs. I also have a <br/>
vegan daughter, another daughter who is a vegetarian by necessity (she has <br/>
PKU) and my 9 year old son told me almost a month ago he wanted to become <br/>
vegetarian and has done marvelously with it so far. I&#39;m not pressuring him in <br/>
any way and he decides what he wants to eat and he has not come close to <br/>
eating meat in the last few weeks. I&#39;m very proud of him. He does still eat <br/>
cheese sometimes though and an occasional egg. I&#39;m hoping that eventually <br/>
he&#39;ll want to avoid those. My husband though is still very much a meat eater. <br/>
He will tell me he thinks we&#39;re doing the right thing to go meatless and that <br/>
he wants to do it too but he never lasts more than a day. Oh well, it&#39;s his <br/>
choice. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as cookbooks go, right now I&#39;m using a lot of vegan cookbooks by <br/>
Joanne Stepaniak. Vegan Vittles is very good with nice familiar foods. I also <br/>
have Ecological Cooking and The Uncheese Cookbook by her and like both of <br/>
them very much. Ecological Cooking in particular has lots and lots of recipes <br/>
so it&#39;s easy to find something in there that I can cook. The Vegetarian Times <br/>
cookbook has a lot of tasty stuff though many of the recipes are lacto-ovo <br/>
and so I don&#39;t use them. Same with the Moosewood Cookbook and anything else <br/>
by Molly Katzen. Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone by Deborah Madison is <br/>
excellent though not vegan exclusively. Even more than cookbooks, I&#39;d <br/>
recommend Diet for a New America by John Robbins for anyone willing to <br/>
consider going vegetarian/vegan. It&#39;s such an eye-opener. <br/>

&gt; if <br/>
&gt;  I eat them or take protien suppliments....he is not to bad with beans, but <br/>
&gt;  really how many beans can you really eat.... any suggestions....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>About protein, try out some of the cookbooks I mentioned by Joanne Stepaniak. <br/>
There&#39;s a lot you can do with tofu and seitan that is wonderful. You really <br/>
don&#39;t need meat or dairy or eggs to get high protein foods. And for a view on <br/>
how damaging high protein diets can be and why lower protein is actually <br/>
beneficial try some of John McDougall&#39;s books. I&#39;d recommend The McDougall <br/>
Plan for Women for a very good discussion of osteoporosis. Any of his books <br/>
are good though. <br/>

<br/>
I like visiting <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vegsource.com/">http://www.vegsource.com/</a> as a source of veg info. They also<br/>
have a homeschooling swap board. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an article on their site about the zone and blood-type diet fads:<br/>

<br/>
The author didn&#39;t have good things to say about it though. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that&#39;s what you were looking for. The vegsource site is really worth<br/>
exploring.<br/>
