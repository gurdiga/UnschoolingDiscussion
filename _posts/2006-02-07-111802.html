<div id="ygrps-yiv-527862394">&#39; Are there any gaps<br/>
in their education? (I think there are many gaps in mine, a public<br/>
school education).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah...the old &quot;gaps in education&quot; myth. Think about it, does anyone on<br/>
this earth NOT have &quot;gaps in education&quot;?:)<br/>
<br/>
If we didn&#39;t, we&#39;d already know everything there is to know!! Not<br/>
possible. If you&#39;re alive and learning, there will always be gaps.<br/>
Hurray for gaps, it keeps life interesting!!<br/>

Many years ago when I was a new unschooler I heard (something like)this <br/>
somewhere, and have quoted (something like) it a thousand times since:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Suppose a successful college student graduates knowing one one-<br/>
billionth of all that there is to know.  She probably knows less than <br/>
that, but let&#39;s just suppose that she graduated, knowing that much.<br/>
<br/>
Who should decide which one-billionth she should learn?  And does it <br/>
make any sense to push her really really really hard, so that she can <br/>
graduate knowing two one-billionths?&quot;<br/>
