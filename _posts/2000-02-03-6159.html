<div id="ygrps-yiv-674421534">Dear List,<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what the most important thing I want to express about our <br/>
little family.<br/>
<br/>
I am a 28 year old parent of two boys- seven and nine...my seven year old <br/>
shows s/s of ADD as determined by a counselor that I hired to help try to <br/>
motivate him in school.  His first grade teacher expressed that his level of <br/>
maturity are below his age group and was afraid of him falling behind in the <br/>
long term...then his second grade teacher blew off my concerns and <br/>
suggestions about how to help him in class...I have always beleived in <br/>
listening to my children...so I got his input on what might help him...but <br/>
she didn&#39;t agree...this was about two weeks ago.  I spent a friday evening at <br/>
work agonizing over what I was going to do to help him...I determind that the <br/>
following monday (Jan 24th) that I would check into charter schools and <br/>
private montessori schools...I couldn&#39;t sleep the sunday before and ended up <br/>
getting on the internet and looking into homeschooling.  Everything I read <br/>
supported how I was feeling and some such...Monday I actually called the  <br/>
county superintendent and wrote my younger son&#39;s teacher a letter explaining <br/>
how I felt she and his class actually did him a disservice...(lol) and then <br/>
tuesday I checked out about thirty books from the library...the one that made <br/>
the most sense to me is the one on Unschooling by Mary Griffith...I withdrew <br/>
them from school on Jan 31st...I decided that I didn&#39;t want to wait to start <br/>
the deschooling process...<br/>
<br/>
My family is not surprised at my decision as I have always been the more <br/>
&#39;radical&#39; of my siblings... and my mother wants to partner with me in the <br/>
adventure of homeschooling...we both work at the same nursing home...I being <br/>
the charge nurse of my unit on evenings and she is the med nurse...she is <br/>
transferring to day shift on the same unit so that she can work with them <br/>
while I am at work.  I think that my mom is just as excited as I am with our <br/>
adventure.  She has been rearranging and organizing her &#39;project studio&#39; to <br/>
accomadate my kids to be invlolved at her apt...we actually live next door to <br/>
each other...<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t gathered yet...I am a single parent...I have always been a <br/>
single parent and I foresee continueing in this particular lifestyle...the <br/>
only thing that I didn&#39;t get from my reading is a strong sense of support for <br/>
the single parent choosing to home/un school...but I know in my heart that I <br/>
have made the right desision (sp).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways...just wanted to share some about us...today we have started growing <br/>
salt crystals and made play do with flour and salt...<br/>

Lhiza,<br/>
I am not sure if you are referring to not finding much written about single <br/>
parent home schoolers, or if you got the feeling that people really didn&#39;t <br/>
support single parent hsing.  Which ever, I am sure you will find loads of <br/>
support on this list.  we do have several single moms currently on the list, <br/>
and right now several people have been trying to help me help a single mom.  <br/>
It is true that there are not a large amount of single parent hsers, because <br/>
they don&#39;t have the work opportunities, or the support (your mom) that you <br/>
do.  So you have a great deal goin for you, your flexible work schedule, your <br/>
mom, and us!  <br/>
welcome to the list.<br/>
