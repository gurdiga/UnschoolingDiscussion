I don&#39;t know if this is  going to work.  They&#39;re in an ofoto.com album.  <br/>
Sorry for the  inconvenience if it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
 <br/>
If it does, there&#39;s a photo  of Cameron in front of the tortilla display and <br/>
then in front of the salsa (SOME  of the salsa) at the Raley&#39;s supermarket <br/>
nearest us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501166296">Ackk! Such great pix. I haven&#39;t seen those kids since SC SOS. My son<br/>
is 14 now. The pix of Kelli&#39;s son and Holli makes me think of how cool<br/>
it is to see preteens develop in physical ways. I like to see their<br/>
faces and bodies make that swift change. To see the  smudge of hair on<br/>
my son&#39;s lip and then look back to his photo from two years<br/>
ago....such a wonderful thing to see a child grow into a young adult<br/>
person! It&#39;s weird how you hear so much about kids having problems<br/>
with puberty and growing up. It seems such a good time at our house!<br/>

I agree.  I&#39;m really enjoying my kids as teens (but then I enjoyed  them <br/>
always, which is probably why it&#39;s not a rough time now).<br/>
 <br/>
Those who&#39;ve seen Marty at conferences probably saw him bald to baldish,  but <br/>
in that photo he has hair! &lt;g&gt;  He kept his head shaved for three  years or <br/>
so, and it&#39;s nice to see it grown out some.  It&#39;s curly in the  back!  We <br/>
didn&#39;t expect that.<br/>

Chris will be 14 in just a couple of months and I so enjoy him as a<br/>
teen!:) His intellectually and spiritual side of him is just so<br/>
blossoming!:0) While others I hear of who &quot;school&quot; are having trouble<br/>
with their children in their teens I find Chris to be such a delight!:)<br/>
