&lt;&lt; So, now I&#39;m here wanting to unschool (think I&#39;m the one that needs the<br/>
 &quot;unschooling&quot; though...my dd pretty much knows how) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Robin, that is SO true. It&#39;s us, as the parents, that need to change <br/>
our thinking for unschooling to work. Children are born curious and eager to <br/>
learn about their world. They don&#39;t have the school mindset baggage to <br/>
lose.They&#39;re just themselves, living each day for the moment.<br/>
Let your children be your example, get in touch with the passions you have <br/>
and go with it!!  Sounds like you&#39;re on the right track.<br/>

help is get &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot;.  At the back they have little <br/>
blurbs about the contributers to the book.  I was struck by how many <br/>
of the people have backgrounds in science and engineering fields.  <br/>
Also, there are plenty of quotes from people like Thomas Edison and <br/>
Albert Einstein about how they felt school was a hinderance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402690218">Just wanted to also greet the newbies!  I am also just starting and my husband sounds very similar and comes from a large family of public school teachers, including his father.  I just keep putting little quotes and excerpts up on the refridge, table.... where ever I think he might see them.   Like right now , the quote from Linda Dobson is up.  So far he has been pretty receptive, I think it is such a jump for some people tho&#39;,  to me its makes so much sense,  Unschooling that is.  I think if I gently ease him into the thought it will be just fine.. I just have to be patient like she(Linda D.) says,  I think both of you who just introduced yourselves are on the right track.  I love seeing so many people new,  it gives me faith that more and more people will see the logic of our ways!!  <br/>
I have to say that this is the first fall that I havn&#39;t been a basket case, gee, just happens to be the first fall we&#39;ve unschooled.  Usually the stress of school starting up practically shuts me down,  not this year!  I have fibromyalgia, (can never spell it) and the stress of school really was horrible. When I was young and now as a parent.  Can&#39;t wait for everyone else to go tho&#39; and we can go out and really enjoy our life.  It is so good to be home with my kids! <br/>
Loving unschooling, especially during fall in northern Minnesota!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126157431">The quote was one from this list yesterday,  <br/>
&quot;Your efforts may, at first, seem more like scrap lumber randomly scattered across the vast universe that is your child rather than a remarkable structure you watch rise, floor by measureable floor.  But the Eiffel Tower didn&#39;t appear overnight, and the most beautiful cathedrals of the world took decades to complete.<br/>
It helps to think of yourself not as &quot;teacher&quot; the way you remember it, but like the supplier whose purpose is merely making sure the builder - your child - can get his hands on the necessary materials when he needs them.  Be happy when you make any sale, however modest.  The true architect will use the materials in his own way, in his own time.<br/>
Schools force a child into using his limited resources today.  &quot;Build a bird house, &quot;they demand, &quot;so that we may count how many sticks you&#39;ve collected.&quot;<br/>
At home there&#39;s no need for immediate &quot;proof&quot;.  Be patient.  Don&#39;t measure.  Who can say what exquisite masterpiece your child will shape and build from the scraps tomorrow - or ten years from now?  The more he collects, the greater the structure he&#39;s capable of building.  And when that structure is life itself, don&#39;t settle for a bird house today.  Trust you&#39;ll find a castle tomorrow.<br/>
Simply provide the materials.&quot;<br/>
from The Art of Education  Linda Dobson<br/>
Isn&#39;t it great?  I think Sandra posted it earlier.  <br/>
