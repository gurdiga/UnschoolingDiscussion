 </span></blockquote>Glad you liked it. In fact, I almost never use the word &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
in what I write. John Holt used the terms &quot;homeschooling&quot; <br/>
and &quot;unschooling&quot; interchangeably, and I don&#39;t want to give up the <br/>
turf! Let the none &quot;homeschoolers&quot;(unschoolers) find another word.  <br/>
(I&#39;m not much fond of the term &quot;homeschooling&quot; either -- very little <br/>
of it happens at home, and it bears only the slightest relationship <br/>
to what goes on in school.)<br/>
<br/>
In my house, where our practice differs from that of SOME unschoolers <br/>
is that we do a lot of goal setting. The education is still &quot;child-<br/>
directed, family-centered&quot;, but I&#39;m also a believer in the theory of <br/>
FLOW -- small goals set and small goals met lead to larger ones <br/>
later. We are little bound by the tyranny of subject matter, and we <br/>
put the kids&#39; pursuit of their own passions first on our collective <br/>
family lists, but we do explicitly help them set goals for <br/>
themselves, and help them evaluate them along the way -- I want them <br/>
to become self-aware of the journey.  The important terms in the <br/>
title are &quot;Voyage of Self-Discovery&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
The original title of the book is the current sub-title (A Journey of <br/>
Original Seeking) -- publisher wasn&#39;t buying it, although a big <br/>
publisher was interested in the book, provided I scrub all references <br/>
to homeschooling! But, as I write, I decided to stick to my knitting.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps. (sample chapters can be found on my site.)<br/>
