<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546387456">&lt;&lt;But if he wanted to watch/read pornography and really started getting into<br/>
it, what would you do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people, including myself, have a &quot;porn&quot; phase.  Probably most people<br/>
in the U.S. have seen some porn in their lives.  Very few have problems with<br/>
it.  Just like most people in the U.S. have used some type of drug, either<br/>
illegal, herbal, OTC or prescription, to alter moods.  Very few, relatively,<br/>
have problems with it.<br/>
<br/>
Getting overly involved in any activity that is detrimental to the person or<br/>
their relationships is a symptom.  It isn&#39;t the root of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
My 9 yo son just saw Dolly Parton for the first time the other night.  He<br/>
said,&quot;Her boobs are HUGE!!!  They are lots bigger than the ones on Bay<br/>
Watch.&quot;  So the sexual element isn&#39;t lost even on pre-pre-pubescent kids.<br/>
That said, when any of my kids are doing ANYTHING that makes me<br/>
uncomfortable or that makes me concerned for their well-being, I talk with<br/>
them.  I ask questions. I tell them how I view the situation.  I draw<br/>
parallels.  I work very hard not to shame or forbid.  But more than<br/>
anything, I want them to know that I am a safety-net that they can bounce<br/>
anything off of.<br/>
