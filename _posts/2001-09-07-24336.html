What is a good one to start with?<br/>
My kids are 8, 6 and 5 if that matters.<br/>
And What about Age of Empires?  Think this is too old for us?<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Nope. Get them all. I&#39;ve decided that most of the suggested age ranges<br/>
on games (board and computer) are a crock. The only issue is some reading<br/>
and writing, but if you&#39;re in earshot it should be fine. I know many 5 yr<br/>
olds who play them successfully. Cacie played many games for ages 10+ at<br/>
half that age....<br/>
<br/>
The Sims is nice in that you can start with a one-person family if you<br/>
want an easier game...<br/>
