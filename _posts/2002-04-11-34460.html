&gt; &quot;Did you figure out the secret?&quot;<br/>
&gt; yup, definitely magic.  actually, they don&#39;t have to think as hard as I<br/>
&gt; about it to do it.  it comes naturally to them to notice what I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; notice as well as to do without agonizing over it jobs that seem<br/>
&gt; herculean to me. I&#39;ve read all sorts of books to know I am not alone.  no<br/>
&gt; matter how many books I read or how hard I try to be consistent, my head<br/>
&gt; is often other places.  I take long breaks from my &quot;responsibilities&quot; to<br/>
&gt; go on information quests or to enjoy the weather or to help other people<br/>
&gt; out in their time of need.  I&#39;ve made a deal with myself to do my best<br/>
&gt; and accept anything else as my humanity.<br/>

Some people can wear scarves. They take a scarf, drape it around their <br/>
clothing in an artful manner, where it mostly stays put and doesn&#39;t look <br/>
stupid. Others of us, when attempting to wear a scarf, need to fuss with it <br/>
constantly, and it never looks quite right.<br/>
<br/>
Scarf People will kindly explain that it&#39;s easy, and offer to show us <br/>
Non-Scarf People. This never works. (On the positive side, keep in mind that <br/>
Isadora Duncan was a Scarf Person, and look what happened to her!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s similar for Cleaning People vs. Non-Cleaning People. Cleaning People, <br/>
who do not understand that NCP were born Cleaning Challenged, write books, <br/>
start web sites, or offer to help their friends (and daughters-in-law) just <br/>
Get Organized, or will share cleaning tips.  This also does not work and <br/>
makes the Cleaning Challenged feel unworthy of love and respect. The Cleaning <br/>
Challenged are unable to find the white vinegar to clean the bathroom mirror, <br/>
and really don&#39;t think it looks that bad anyway.<br/>

each other, but their clothing...and vacuums the house at least once, and <br/>
sometimes more, a day.<br/>

I LOVE this analogy! :) Now I can be proud to say I am NCP, LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kathryn, this is priceless! I love it! I&#39;m printing it out to share <br/>
with my daughter Jody (22) who has a *huge* selection of beautiful <br/>
scarves she wears with tremendous finesse and is always telling me I <br/>
should try one but I know better than to imagine I could *ever* be a <br/>
true Scarf Person. &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
