<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225112859">Hello Everyone,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that I havent responded to my own question. I saved all of the <br/>
responses and I had to read them and reread them. Thanks everyone for all the <br/>
thoughtful advice. I have decided to back off for now as she is a little <br/>
freaked. And I figured since I cant do anything until it happens again , that <br/>
I&#39;ll  try not to pry on her too much. As for the tampon situation I had no <br/>
intention what so ever to allow them as I myself had some serious problems <br/>
with them , I guess my system is just too sensitive and I know everyone is <br/>
different but......well I&#39;m just not comfortable with it. I am going to go <br/>
out and purchase some of the books mentioned and just put them away until I <br/>
think she wants them then Ill just leave them in her book box. I have calmed <br/>
down and everyone on this list has been a big  help as far as that is <br/>
concerned. Thankyou Thankyou. <br/>
Im sure that this might be my first Mom Moment , but it wont be the last!!! <br/>
Carol if your reading this . Your post had me  balling. sniffling and <br/>
laughing all at the same time. so here is a great big Hug. &lt;&lt;&lt;                <br/>
