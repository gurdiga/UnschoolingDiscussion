<div id="ygrps-yiv-595401257">I can usually just squeeze in reading all my e-mail but I had to comment on<br/>
Ann&#39;s question. My grandma died last January age 98. In the past ten years<br/>
we spent some of our visits taping her stories of how it was when she was a<br/>
girl and all the diferent memories of her life. We used old pictures to get<br/>
her started. My kids enjoyed it too. Now that she is gone they are truly<br/>
precious. <br/>
Just a thought,<br/>

Those pictures and stories are truly precious. My grandma died last January <br/>
at 101. My girls and I have spent lots of time talking about all the changes <br/>
she witnessed in her lifetime. She came from the Ukraine--no electricity, no <br/>
automobiles, no running water. She worked in a factory at 14 to help support <br/>
her family.  In her incredible lifetime she witnessed  everything from <br/>
electricity to people in space and computers. Amazing1<br/>
