<div id="ygrps-yiv-68213107">Hi all...<br/>
My sister and I got into a discussion about teaching math today. She is<br/>
planning on hsing her two this upcoming year, and we were tossing ideas<br/>
about. How do you all feel about unschooling math? On the one hand I feel<br/>
that if children are strongly math oriented, they will naturally incline<br/>
towards math related activities, and eventually, careers. The problem is,<br/>
neither of our middle girls are math oriented, and, as much as I would<br/>
love to let them follow a complete lifestyle of learning, I just can&#39;t<br/>
let go of that math. I feel that they should have enough of the basics to<br/>
jump through the hoops at the college level, what with SAT tests, and<br/>
college placement exams. I&#39;m brave enough to unschool just about anything<br/>
but math! Help!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I agree. Most people don&#39;t need math the way it&#39;s taught in schools. I<br/>
&gt; suppose you need that only if you want to become a mathematician or a<br/>
&gt; physicist and want to communicate your ideas with your colleagues. Then<br/>
&gt; you need a common language.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My father in law is a mathematician who taught for years at the university<br/>
level.  He&#39;s not convinced about the way my son is learning math, but he was<br/>
constantly frustrated that the college students he saw only knew formulas<br/>
and didn&#39;t understand the principles behind them, so they couldn&#39;t apply<br/>
them to a &quot;real&quot; problem.<br/>
<br/>
Higher-level mathmatics (like group theory, his area) has NOTHING to do the<br/>
with garbage they teach in schools.  It has everything to do with the<br/>
principles behind all those calculations, and how they work and can be<br/>
manipulated.  <br/>
<br/>
Both my husband and I understand what he does.  Neither of us managed to<br/>
pass calculus.  That&#39;s revealing to me.  Henry (FIL) will come around yet, I<br/>
believe.  <br/>

 I think when you converted to inches 300 x 480 x 12, you left out the 12<br/>
 times.  300 x 480 = 144,000, then that times 12 equals 1,728,000 sq. inches.<br/>
 That number divided by the 46,656 equals 37.03, or slightly over 37 cubic<br/>
 yards of mulch (I don&#39;t think I&#39;d buy 38, cuz I&#39;m cheap - the actual depth<br/>
 would only be about 11.9+ inches!). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AHA! Thanks....didn&#39;t notice that.<br/>

drive home, lay it down and see how much more we need!!! LOL<br/>

 Care to elaborate Pam? What do you (the mathemetician) consider to be the <br/>
 important concepts and skills? And what does a math-healthy unschooling <br/>
 family do in a practical sense to support their kids understanding of the <br/>
 language of numbers and patterns?<br/>
 <br/>
 Life is good.<br/>
 ~Mary, who can&#39;t wait to hear Pam&#39;s &quot;unschooling math&quot; presentation at the <br/>
 SC Conference!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YEAH!! Same here.<br/>
I agree that if the parents have a block they should try to repair that <br/>
school damage and learn to embrace math joyfully...BUT, actually doing it is <br/>
difficult with the baggage I carry around in that area.<br/>
It&#39;s getting better. Unschooling has healed me in so many, many ways.<br/>
But I still sense a lot of blockage over math anxiety. I just ordered the &quot;I <br/>
hate Mathematics&quot; book to inspire me. I also got a book about turning your <br/>
brain into a calculator (full of great tips and tricks that make computation <br/>
easier) and found it very revealing!!<br/>
I think Pam needs to start Math therapy for the perpetually anxious math <br/>
phobics. :)<br/>

My curiosity is peaked !!! I was wondering about the card games ?? I <br/>

<br/>
There are regular-deck card games (war, speed, crazy 8&#39;s, rummy, poker)<br/>
and dedicated-deck games (Five Crowns)<br/>
and CCGs (Collectible Card Games) like Magic, L5R, Raw Deal (about wrestling <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll go put some card games on my math blog. If anybody has good ones, <br/>
send &#39;em to me.<br/>
<br/>
With a 7 year old you can play Elevensies --- which is just &quot;21&quot; or <br/>
Blackjack only remove all the face cards and numbers over 5 from the <br/>
deck. The goal is to get to 11 but not over. Dealer gives one card, <br/>
face down, to each player including dealer. Then dealer gives one card, <br/>
face up, to each player, including dealer. Players look at their face <br/>
down card, but don&#39;t reveal it to others. First player tells dealer <br/>
&quot;hit me&quot; if he wants another card. Dealer gives him another card, face <br/>
up. Player says, &quot;I&#39;ll stay,&quot; if he doesn&#39;t want another card. Then <br/>
dealer goes to next player and last to himself. Players that go over 11 <br/>
lose. Whoever gets closest to 11 or exactly 11 wins that hand. We have <br/>
the winner of that hand keep all the cards (split them if there is a <br/>
tie) and change dealers for each hand. When the deck is gone, player <br/>
with the most cards wins.<br/>
<br/>
Move up to 21 when the kid is comfortable adding that high. After you <br/>
play it a while, you can make the Aces count as either ones or elevens. <br/>
Then, if they are dealt two of the same number, they can turn both face <br/>
up and get two new face down cards and play two hands at once. Just <br/>
some variations based on BlackJack - make up your own, too.<br/>
<br/>
Betting with pennies or toothpicks or jelly beans or M&Ms is fun to add <br/>
to this game, too. Everybody put in a penny ante (before dealing). Then <br/>
when the face down and one face up card has been dealt, everybody can <br/>
go around putting in a bet and raising and all that.<br/>
<br/>
You can play this with just two people or more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*********************<br/>
<br/>
A fun variation of &quot;War&quot; is &quot;Persian Pasha.&quot;<br/>
2 players<br/>
Half of the deck to each player.<br/>
Each player puts down a card, face up, simultaneously (like in War). <br/>
Keep doing that - don&#39;t worry about the numbers on the cards - same or <br/>
different doesn&#39;t matter until the two cards put down are the same <br/>
suit, THEN the higher card wins and that player takes ALL the cards <br/>
played so far.<br/>

all the profit *g*.  I suppose we could use nickles and quarters, but <br/>
that would mean we&#39;d need a lot of change on hand.  Real casino chips <br/>
are not that expensive, you know.  You can get clay chips on ebay for <br/>
about 10 cents each.  300 clay chips cost around $30 and that&#39;s <br/>
plenty for a game of 3 or 4 people.  Plastic ones are much cheaper.<br/>

<br/>
Get a lot of change on hand -- and only use pennies, dimes, and <br/>
dollars. Make a side rule that nobody can ever have more than 9 pennies <br/>
or 9 dimes in their possession. If anybody catches anybody else with <br/>
more than nine pennies or nine dimes, they can challenge them and steal <br/>
the &quot;extras.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This means that they have to watch it and quickly exchanges &quot;ones&quot; <br/>
(pennies) for &quot;tens&quot; (dimes) and &quot;tens&quot; for hundreds (dollars).<br/>
<br/>
If you used unit cubes to bet with - that would be exchanging units for <br/>
rods and rods for flats.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, it greatly reinforces the idea behind place value.<br/>

<br/>
Yes it is. Ice cream can only go  in one end.  Alligators can eat small <br/>
things more easily than large ones.<br/>
<br/>
But the point is that they&#39;re both TOTALLY outside the point and that they&#39;re <br/>
trying to explain what is already a totally sensible and simple line drawing <br/>
of less and more, smaller and larger.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You are making much <br/>
more out of it than it is. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No, Pam wasn&#39;t making too much of it.<br/>
She was defending logic and math.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Its just a little trick to help somefolks remember <br/>
which way the &quot;mouth&quot; points.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
So which end would be mouth?  An alligator&#39;s body is bigger than its mouth.  <br/>
And the  symbol can &quot;point&quot; either way.  The bigger number goes on the bigger <br/>
end, whether it&#39;s turned to &quot;greater than&quot; or &quot;less than.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=- It&#39;s no more <br/>
sinister than &quot;i before e except after c&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not a line-drawing symbol to represent that.<br/>
(There are so so many exceptions it&#39;s not all that useful, but it would be <br/>
useful in spelling &quot;their.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t help with &quot;wierd.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-  Or &quot;In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, <br/>
Columbus sailed the Ocean Blue. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a rhyme to replace just flatly memorizing a number.  It&#39;s helpful.   <br/>
It doesn&#39;t try to get someone to remember something entirely unrelated like a <br/>
banana or lace underwear.   Ice cream and alligators have zip/nothing to do <br/>
with whether one number is larger than another.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Do you think <br/>
there is something &quot;wrong&quot; with a visual picture or mnemonic device that <br/>

<br/>
Are you really confused about whether someone has to love all such devices or <br/>
they have to reject all of them?  Some are good.  Those great-thans were not <br/>
good ones.  So do they do any good for people here?  Will they help them <br/>
unschool?  Speaking to children directly in English without nonsense works really <br/>

Hello all,<br/>
    I just joined you this evening. I guess this is as good a place to &quot;jump <br/>
in&quot; as any!<br/>
*I&#39;m* even confused already!! :o) I&#39;ve taught my children that &quot;&lt;&quot; means less <br/>
than because it points down the number line to the lesser numbers, and &quot;&gt;&quot; <br/>
means greater than because it points up the number line to the greater numbers. <br/>
That *is* correct right??<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post an intro in another email. :o)<br/>

The bigger end of the symbol is on the side where the bigger number is, <br/>
no matter which way the symbol is turned. No relation to the number <br/>

it explained as a visual of an alligator eating the bigger number.    It&#39;s <br/>
just a simple &quot;tool&quot; for some folks.  It IS good if it helps one remember, IF <br/>
they need to remember.. Heck, in the &quot;real&quot; world, how often does &gt;, &lt; come up?  <br/>
  I know lots of folks from  little kids just learning &lt;, &gt;,  to adults in <br/>
college who DO use the alligator visual and find it helpful.   <br/>
<br/>
 In our family, Ethan has always needed a visual to be able to decode and <br/>
remember things.    Of course, now that he is unschooled, the idea of using &lt;, &gt; <br/>
is a moot point, but at some point in his life, he may very well need to <br/>
recall those facts.   When Ethan writes, he has rhymes or visual clues to help him <br/>
remember things, like. &quot;B has a belly&quot;   to diferentiate between lower case b <br/>
and d.   He has his own personal &quot;clues&quot; for punctuation that I can&#39;t recall <br/>
right now.  But, they are based on how he visualized the symbols and what they <br/>
stand for.     <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the ice cream cone and the alligator mouth are &quot;not good&#39; in your <br/>
opinion.   I didn&#39;t come up with them.  Although, by living with a child that sees <br/>
things differently than most folks, I have come up with quite a few cues and <br/>
clues to help him remember things.    Everyone is not logically and <br/>
mathematically inclined, the little &gt; symbol that might seem perfectly logical to most <br/>
folks, may be perfectly baffling to others. <br/>
<br/>
  You asked if &quot;they&quot; ( ice cream cones and alligator mouths) helped anyone <br/>
to unschool.   Would unschooling not embrace EVERY type of learning?  No matter <br/>
how the child makes a connection, every path is good and worthy.   The <br/>
connection could be made through a far reaching tangent, but if it makes sense to <br/>
that person, it is still learning.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not saying.  &quot;To understand the &gt; and &lt; symbols, one must visualize them <br/>
as an alligator&#39;s mouth eating the bigger number&quot;, as a &quot;rule&quot; or a &quot;fact&quot;, <br/>
or even a &quot;best way&quot;  It was just me sharing one way to learn the symbols and <br/>
remember them, IF the conventional, self explanatory, &quot;they are logically <br/>
designed way so you should get it&quot; approach did not work.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gosh, that post seems a bit over the top.  I don&#39;t see<br/>
anything in Pam&#39;s post where she says she is against<br/>
mnemonic devices or visual helps or poems.  She just<br/>
said that that particular one is confusing and might<br/>
cause more problems than it solves.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was one for putting too much thought into<br/>
standardized test questions, for example, and when the<br/>
question was &quot;if there are 10 apples on a tree, and a<br/>
horse took 5 days to eat all the apples, how many<br/>
apples did he eat each day?&quot;  She was totally<br/>
confused.  What if he ate one apple a day for 4 days<br/>
and then ate 6 the last day?  What if he didn&#39;t eat<br/>
any on one day?  How would she ever know?<br/>
<br/>
I had to constantly tell her to quit thinking so much<br/>
and just pick the answer that fits from the choices<br/>
given.  How ridiculous to tell a child to stop<br/>
thinking!<br/>
<br/>
I can see where a child who watches a lot of Steve<br/>
Irwin or other animal planet shows might wonder why an<br/>
alligator wouldn&#39;t just eat both up or even just the<br/>
smaller one, since animals usually eat the sick and<br/>
weak instead of the biggest and strongest.<br/>
<br/>
So why not just simply tell the child the smaller end<br/>
of the symbol points to the smaller number?  Or the<br/>
larger end points to the larger number?  Why not keep<br/>
it in the same terms as the actual problem, just like<br/>
your three other examples do?<br/>
<br/>
Getting defensive when someone on the list suggests<br/>
there might be a better choice than the one you have<br/>
offered is not the best way to respond.  Perhaps you<br/>
didn&#39;t mean to sound defensive, but it came across to<br/>
me that way.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Heck, in the &quot;real&quot; world, how often does &gt;, &lt; come up?  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Without math lessons, somehow my kids all know what it means.  It takes about <br/>
two seconds to show someone, when they come across it somewhere, like on the <br/>

<br/>

If a child has already established that left-to-right thing, then &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; <br/>
aren&#39;t confusing anymore.  If they have NOT established it, both &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; <br/>
have a belly.  Why should the belly face one way and not the other?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe the ice cream cone and the alligator mouth are &quot;not good&#39; in your <br/>
opinion.   I didn&#39;t come up with them. &gt;&gt;<br/>

There are lots of things which are not useful which I didn&#39;t come up with, <br/>
but if I bring them and post them on this list, I need to be willing or able to <br/>

&lt;&lt;  You asked if &quot;they&quot; ( ice cream cones and alligator mouths) helped anyone <br/>
to unschool.   Would unschooling not embrace EVERY type of learning? &gt;&gt;<br/>

No.  Just good and sensible types of learning.  Not assembly line stuff <br/>
designed for multitudes, and not nonsense.<br/>

&lt;&lt;No matter <br/>
how the child makes a connection, every path is good and worthy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Recommending convoluted connections to a child isn&#39;t a child making a <br/>
connection.  It&#39;s an adult making a confusing recommendation.<br/>
