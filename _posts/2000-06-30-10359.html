<div id="ygrps-yiv-578955859">i for one would be interested in other versions.  my personal belief <br/>
is that nearly all of life falls in the realm of the <br/>
subjective/personalperspective.  i somehow missed most of the american <br/>
history &#39;taught&#39; in school plus being part native american my interest <br/>
have been in areas other then the &#39;founding&#39; of america (the joke that <br/>
it is).   also we&#39;re about 1/2 through reading  &quot;carry on mr bowditch&quot; <br/>
which begins during the revolutionary war - btw i highly recommend <br/>
this book.<br/>

I&#39;ll dig out some of my English History Books, (yes I&#39;ve kept them from <br/>
school) and give you the titles and names... In this cosmopolitan world we <br/>
live in, I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be no problem getting them.  I&#39;ll ask my mum about <br/>
other ones that she recommends.  She the History buff in our family, going <br/>
back to the 1600....and up to present day.<br/>

I think that unless any of us were there around the time of 1776, and I know <br/>
that I wasn&#39;t, and in either country, then everything is going to be written <br/>
from a slanted perspective, whether that be British or American.  There is no <br/>
good or bad on that perspective, it just is a perspective from the person who <br/>
wrote it.  As we have seen recently on this list, people have different ideas <br/>
and perceptions about subjects.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure if you going into any of the UK sites and read what they have to <br/>
say, you will see that events didn&#39;t necessarily happen the way they are <br/>
reported here, or the importance of them.  <br/>
<br/>
You have to remember that July 4th is a big deal to Americans, it&#39;s just <br/>
another work day to the British and, unless they have American friends, most <br/>
don&#39;t even know what it is.  It&#39;s not a relevant issue to a culture that has <br/>
over 1000 years of documented history. I think that&#39;s one of the big <br/>
differences between Great Britian and America.  This country is so young <br/>
(since it killed off the Native Americans) that any history at all is <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
When I lived in Philadelphia one of my friends was so excited for me to see <br/>
the Bell.  She kept on about how old it was... When she told me how old it <br/>
was I blinked and said &quot;my grandmother lives in a house older than that&quot;... <br/>
Again it&#39;s all perception.<br/>
<br/>
I feel fortunate that I was born there, married to an American and live her <br/>
now.  My children will have the benefit of learning about history from both <br/>
perspectives.<br/>
<br/>
Just my little 2 cents or should I say 2 pence.<br/>

Great post.  You are so right that we learn about history from second (or<br/>
third or fourth) hand sources usually.  And all sources have an agenda or<br/>
bias, therefore it is important to read about a timeframe from several<br/>
different sources.  In America we have two versions of the Civil War, the<br/>
Southern and the Northern.  A friend of mine who was born and raised in the<br/>
South learned a very different version of it than I did.  For example, she<br/>
was taught that the South won.<br/>
