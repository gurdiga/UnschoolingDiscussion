<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259169334">On a site attempting to fairly portray all kinds of homeschooling, I&#39;m  <br/>
the representative of unschooling.   You can read that page here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.successful-homeschooling.com/unschooling.html">http://www.successful-homeschooling.com/unschooling.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And for people&#39;s relatives who want to know what the options are,  <br/>
there&#39;s a downloadable e-book, free, which has just been announced.    <br/>
I don&#39;t know if it includes all that information straight out or not.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you wanting to look back (or over) at what you&#39;re not  <br/>
doing, here&#39;s a little catch of a bit of the site:<br/>
<br/>
K-12 Review<br/>
Does your child need a challenge? Read this mom&#39;s review to find out  <br/>
why K-12 is great for learning-driven children!<br/>
<br/>
K-12 Review<br/>
Are you thinking about using K-12 in your homeschool? Check out this  <br/>
informative review from a mom of 3 who says &quot;K-12 wasn&#39;t for us!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Math U See Review<br/>
Do your children&#39;s math lessons end in tears and frustration? Read  <br/>
this review from a mom who is &quot;So Thankful for Math-U-See!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Learning-driven children&quot;?  And tears and frustration?<br/>
They might figure my page is about hedonism gone berserk, then. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
My kids just don&#39;t cry about learning, and they&#39;re not &quot;driven&quot; by  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so profoundly different I can hardly think of them all on one  <br/>
site.  But as to how children can learn at home, yeah!  It needs to be  <br/>
there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311301738">Oh!! The site owner sent me a copy of the e-book.  It&#39;s small and well  <br/>
laid out.   Here&#39;s the intro she wrote of me and the first question/ <br/>
answer:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd is a mother of three who unschooled her children through  <br/>
graduation.  In<br/>
the following interview, Sandra defines unschooling and shares tips  <br/>
for living a lifestyle<br/>
of learning:<br/>
How would you define unschooling?<br/>
Even people who really want to understand unschooling have a hard time  <br/>
getting it. No<br/>
one definition will cover all the angles, but recently I&#39;ve been  <br/>
saying that unschooling is<br/>
arranging for natural learning to thrive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Graduation&quot;!  I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way.  Holly&#39;s 18, but I  <br/>
hadn&#39;t thought &quot;graduation&quot; since I wrote &quot;No graduation for Kirby.&quot;<br/>
