<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700496830">Well, what got my dander up was that about a month before the DC&#39;s song<br/>
came out there was one by a male singer about how the guy found his<br/>
cheating wife and rammed his truck through the motel wall and killed them<br/>
both.  No big deal, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Geez, of course there isn&#39;t a word for hating men, if you say anything you<br/>
are male bashing.  So here goes, MENapause, MENtal illness, PMS<br/>
(preMENstraul syndrome), seems MEN are the root of all our evils, shall I<br/>
go on &lt;&lt;&lt;BEWG&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; I SO agree with you! It is enough to make intelligent, caring,<br/>

&gt; Doll&quot; (you know that old Cliff Richard song? )well, its lyrics say &quot;Gonna<br/>
&gt; lock her up in a trunk/so no big hunk/can steal her away from me!&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honestly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; once you start listening to lyrics it is amazing how misogynist they are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>

&gt; By the way, ever notice that there is no word for someone who dislikes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>men?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know there is man-hater but that is a &quot;made-up word&quot; if you will. It is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to be misanthropic (hate everyone) or misogynist (hate women) but hating<br/>
&gt; Just men??? nah, why would anyone?? (Sarcastic voice and mean eyes!!)<br/>
&gt; For every one film like Thelma and Louise (in which I think they killed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>one<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; maybe two men and yet the movie critics etc referred to their &quot;murderous<br/>
&gt; rampage!!!&quot;) there are hundreds that depict women being disrespected,<br/>
&gt; assaulted, raped or killed! I am NOT advocating that we make more films<br/>
&gt; showing women abusing or assaulting men - just pointing out that even<br/>
