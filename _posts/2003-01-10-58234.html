<div id="ygrps-yiv-657432623">&lt;&lt;what did you do today?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I got up at 6:30 and took a shower.  I got the kids(5 of them, ages 12 to 3)<br/>
up (we had to be out of the house early today) and they had breakfast.  The<br/>
oldest 2 and I fed all the animals while the little kids cuddled under<br/>
blankets and watched a movie.  We fed 2 dogs and 8 goats, milked the goats.<br/>
Adriane figured out how much milk her goat gave and recorded it.  Zach<br/>
helped figure how much his goat ate and recorded it and I did this for mine.<br/>
<br/>
We got everyone dressed and headed into town for play practice.  The kids<br/>
not involved in the play spent time with their friends in another room,<br/>
chit-chatting about movies and such.<br/>
<br/>
We came home and had lunch.  Adriane turned the soap she is making for the<br/>
county homemaking fair.  Zach is listening to cds on the playstation and his<br/>
little brother is singing along.  This afternoon the little kids will go<br/>
play with friends and the bigger kids and I will go to a 4-H meeting.  Then<br/>
some of the other kids are off to friends&#39; houses for the evening to play.<br/>
The rest of us will probably straighten up the house and play games.<br/>
