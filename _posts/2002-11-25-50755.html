&lt;&lt; Are you on a laptop or did you set up the computer where you are stuck on <br/>
the <br/>
couch?<br/>
Elissa, feeling lilke an internet perve...where are you sitting? what are you <br/>
wearing? Yeesh! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like to go to people&#39;s houses and see where their phones and computers are <br/>
so I can picture them if I call or e-mail.   I totally understand.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a little bedroom right under the living room, next to &quot;BarbieLand.&quot;  <br/>
It&#39;s where our housemate, Wendy, had her stuff stored.   Wendy moved to <br/>
Denver with our friend Anne a few months ago, and right at the beginning of <br/>
October we moved my computer down into that room, and the old Mac too, and <br/>
put up bookshelves.  We moved Holly stuff carefully into where my office used <br/>
to be, and moved my stuff roughly down here and to the back, and I had <br/>
planned to go through it and put things right when I got back from South <br/>
Carolina.  So in January, if I can remember anymore what&#39;s in which box and <br/>
what the plan was, I&#39;ll find some mail I should have answered in October, and <br/>
some books I wasn&#39;t through reading, and some CD&#39;s I&#39;ve been wanting to hear. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So when I&#39;m on the computer now the garage is across the wall from me (the <br/>
floor of the garage being above my head level when I&#39;m sitting, but I can <br/>
hear Keith singing out there when he works), there&#39;s a window to my right at <br/>
ground level toward the front yard (I can see the mountains if I slide the <br/>
chair back, and today and yesterday I came in on crutches and used the desk <br/>
chair instead of the wheel chair), and behind me to the left is the door into <br/>
the den, my other easily accessible room.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921894571">**I can see the mountains**<br/>
 <br/>
Ohhh,  that sounds so nice,<br/>
My kids have never seen  mountains, <br/>
I remember when I first saw some, driving to CA, with my parents,  coming across Montana and my mom says, Look!<br/>
 <br/>
I totally thought they were clouds and they were the most amazing site!    Remember, I&#39;m from flatland, MN.  I just kept staring and staring, out the window,  then I got to Colorado and Wow.<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra, now my little picture is with your mountains out behind your house,  cool!<br/>
 <br/>
Out my window is trees, trees, and more trees,  oh, and snow.<br/>
The mountains are sounding better than the trees and snow now!<br/>

<br/>
Front!  From the room above the garage there&#39;s a picture window which <br/>
beautifully frames the Sandias.  And when clouds are moving across there it&#39;s <br/>
as good as an aquarium, for a soothing, quiet, motion-and-light picture.<br/>

When Heather was two, we moved from coastal BC to Saskachewan.  Think FLAT!<br/>
One day she looked up at the clouds and said,  &quot;Look Mummy!  Mountains!&quot;  I<br/>
nearly cried.  We didn&#39;t stay there long.<br/>
