&lt;&lt; Do you think any oldtimers are going to hang around there to answer those<br/>
 questions, or will it be more like beginners leading beginners?<br/>

to lead others a bit, and then take off when they&#39;re sick of looking back, and <br/>
wanna look forward instead.  That&#39;s my theory.  <br/>

If anyone notices a dearth of experienced unschoolers on there, and they <br/>
wanna unsubcribe, post on here, and maybe a few of us will subscribe for a while.  <br/>
I volunteer.  <br/>
