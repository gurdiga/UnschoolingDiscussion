<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If a kid has played with all kinds of balls, bounced them off different<br/>
&gt; surfaces, has a good idea for their different properties by weight and shape<br/>
&gt; and spin and distance, the first time someone talks to him about force and<br/>
&gt; vector and inertia and all, he will have a bodily sense and a lot of<br/>
&gt; experience to help him understand all that.  That is, unless it is presented<br/>
&gt; as a mathematical formula to be memorized, with no tie-in to sports<br/>
&gt; experience.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always thought a good way to learn that stuff was the pool table.  None of<br/>
those stupid formulas ever made the least bit of sense to me until somebody<br/>
explained to me how to improve my pool game.  I&#39;m still not very good at<br/>
pool, but at least I know what I&#39;d need to work at to improve.<br/>
