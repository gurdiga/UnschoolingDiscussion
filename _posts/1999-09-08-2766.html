<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173134614">Someone posted a URL for a role playing site that her brother or someone had. <br/>
 I copied it down and deleted it.  When I tried to pull it up, Yahoo said no <br/>
site found.  I can&#39;t tell you who posted it, as I did delete it, but would <br/>
you mind reposting?  The URL you gave, or at least what I copied was:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aquela.com/roleplaying/index.html">http://www.aquela.com/roleplaying/index.html</a>  <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
