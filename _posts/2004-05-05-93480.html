NEW HOMESCHOOLERS NEED YOU!<br/>
New homeschoolers like to hear from those of us with experience and <br/>
words<br/>
of advice.  The upcoming issue of the New Homeschool Encouragement<br/>
Newsletter (N-H-E-N) focuses on the recurring question, &quot;How do you <br/>
handle<br/>
the &#39;hard&#39; subjects, like Algebra, Writing Papers and Advanced <br/>
Sciences?&quot;<br/>
Please take a moment and send your best advice. It doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
long,<br/>
just 3-4 lines will be great!<br/>
Here&#39;s the link for where people can read more about past issues of<br/>
N-H-E-N: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/newhser/default.asp?id=418">http://www.nhen.org/newhser/default.asp?id=418</a>&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Okay - this is an unschooling list so I have to admit here that I&#39;m <br/>
sometimes at a loss as to how to respond to questions like this. The <br/>
answer is so &quot;off&quot; from what they think they&#39;re asking, that I&#39;m <br/>
stymied.<br/>
<br/>
But - it IS a question that gets asked, and we&#39;d like to have some <br/>
unschooling answers included, so if anybody has anything they&#39;d like to <br/>
say, please do so - send it to me or send it to the list, either way I <br/>
will make sure it gets to the N-H-E-N editor. Thanks!<br/>
