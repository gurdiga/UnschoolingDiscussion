<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By nature, I&#39;m not a patient, organized, or selfless person. I am <br/>
dedicated to the idea of unschooling and my kids choosing what to do <br/>
with their time and their learning/doing though :-). I actually think <br/>
it would be counter-productive to be selfless, one thing that I think <br/>
is important is that kids also see their parents pursuing their own <br/>
passions, learning about things they are interested in, taking the <br/>
steps to get started in something, learn about it, stick with it when <br/>
things get tough. I think they learn through these experiences as <br/>
well as through their own. I did my first triathlon <br/>
in 3 years this weekend. My son got to see me researching <br/>
equipment (I got new pedals and shoes for my racing bike), he got to <br/>
see me training and talking to other people about how best to train, <br/>
working hard towards my goal, he got to see me practice my <br/>
transitions over and over until I felt I had got them right, and this <br/>
weekend he got to see me organize all of my gear, create a checklist <br/>
so I didn&#39;t forget anything, and pack it all up. Then yesterday he <br/>
got to see me do the race, how hard it was for me, how exhausted I <br/>
was, but how glad I was to have achieved my goal. As I crossed the <br/>
finish line, they gave me a &quot;Finisher&#39;s Medal&quot; on a gold band. My son <br/>
came running up to me yelling &quot;YOu did it mom! You&#39;re a winner! <br/>
You&#39;re a winner!&quot;. And then he asked me if I had won the race and <br/>
beat everyone else and when I answered that I hadn&#39;t, that led to a <br/>
whole discussion about why to do things if we&#39;re not going to win, <br/>
what it means to challenge oneself, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What all of this boils down to is that in *not* being selfless - in <br/>
following my own passions - I am showing him what it takes to pursue <br/>
a complex goal and see it from start to finish. Of course, one can&#39;t <br/>
be selfish to the point that the children are ignored and unsupported <br/>
in their own passions, and not getting the time they need with their <br/>
parents, but I think there&#39;s a healthy balance in there somewhere.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an average day here. Some days we go out and do <br/>
things with other homeschooling friends or groups, some days we stay <br/>
home and do crafts or play in the kiddy pool or play or garden or <br/>
whatever, some days we go to thrift stores or garage sales, some days <br/>
we go find a creek or pond or mud puddle or a hike or a museum or an <br/>
activity, or just go watch the planes take off at the airport. At <br/>
some point in every day, I take time to pursue my own passions, <br/>
whether that be my photography or my writing, or training for my next <br/>
race or flying my airplane. Some of these things I do with the kids <br/>
along, sometimes my husband hangs out with them while I do something <br/>
on my own. Occasionally, we will organize a field trip or someone we <br/>
know will organize them, and we&#39;ll visit a fire station or something <br/>
else interesting. I&#39;m lucky to have found a small group of really <br/>
cool homeschooling friends to hang out with. We&#39;re planning family <br/>
camping trips for the summer, and we&#39;ve taken picnics to the river <br/>
and to a lake already. I feel blessed to have not only the support <br/>
but the friendship of other like-minded people. It sure makes life <br/>
fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981739179">It really depends on the day :).  Today was a lesson in consumer math <br/>
(paying a bill) which turned into a discussion of law (why we have to have <br/>
auto insurance) which turned into physics/mechanics (how fast do you have <br/>
to go to do alot of damage to a car?) which turned into aeronautics (no, <br/>
even with high-test gas mom&#39;s truck can&#39;t go to the moon) which turned into <br/>
astronomy...etc.  Some days we don&#39;t do squat, others we come up with so <br/>
much!  I doubt that you could ever find a &quot;typical&quot; unschooler and I&#39;m sure <br/>
every one of us has the same wonder&#39;s/concerns that you do.  I worry all <br/>
the time, I have no organization whatsoever and if I ever had to be graded <br/>
I would probably have a big F stamped on my forehead :).  But I know also <br/>
that my son is learning.  Not the same way as schooled kids do, with <br/>
assignments, books, etc. but from every day things.  That, and the fact <br/>
that he is learning because he wants to instead of he has to makes a big <br/>
difference.  The problem I have is what to put in my portfolio for year-end <br/>
reviews!<br/>

&gt;Date: Mon, Jun 4, 2001, 7:57 PM<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I know that unschooling is the right choice for my son, but I many doubts<br/>
&gt; about myself - am I patient enough, organised enough, dedicated enough,<br/>
&gt; selfless enough to do it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would really like to hear what other people do. What does an average day<br/>
&gt; in your life look like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling can&#39;t really be encapsulated in a &quot;looks like&quot;, because it can<br/>
look like so many things, including unschooled kids happily rampaging<br/>
through a geometry book they dug out of the recycling bin, perhaps to their<br/>
unschoolish parent&#39;s horror. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have much of an average day... we wake up (3 of 4 of us are<br/>
nightowls, my 3 year old is a -- and I beg you will not judge her harshly,<br/>
the poor little thing can&#39;t help it -- MORNING PERSON. Eeek!), we eat, we<br/>
disperse to our pursuits, both separate and together.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we go to lessons (my oldest, 6, is currently doing Speech/History<br/>
Co-Op, Girl Scouts, Ice Skating, is about to start Art lessons and Girl<br/>
Scout Camp, and just finished up her fourth year of dance. My youngest, 3,<br/>
has Library story time and just finished up her first year of dance.)<br/>
<br/>
Thursdays are Park Day. The community pool will open in about 3 weeks, and I<br/>
expect we&#39;ll be there nearly every day for at least an hour or so.<br/>
<br/>
We have a home business so both my husband and I, and three days a week my<br/>
husband&#39;s sister who works for us, are all home with the girls. Some days<br/>
they spend the day in the yard being Indians (Native Americans), since our<br/>
co-op just finished a month on the subject--<br/>
<br/>
:::warning, ramble::: Brit, when asked by me if she&#39;d like to do a speech on<br/>
the woodland indians like Pocahontas, said, &quot;Can&#39;t I just show them the<br/>
video?&quot; &lt;g&gt; She changed her mind and decided to do the speech -- Brit, when<br/>
changing her mind, does so at midnight or later, so at 12:30 a.m. we were<br/>
pouring over books on Pocahontas and her tribe, drawing pictures of bears,<br/>
etc. The week on Plains Indians I found a COOL website on how they used<br/>
horses to pull travois, including how to build one suitable for pulling by a<br/>
toy horse. I was jazzed. Brit, when shown, yawned and said, &quot;I&#39;m going to<br/>
give a speech on our new rats.&quot; Such is the unschooling parent&#39;s life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
At least I learned a lot about travois. :::now returning you to your<br/>
regularly scheduled post:::<br/>
<br/>
--some days they are all day in the wading pool, some days they spend half<br/>
the day watching Cartoon Network and the other half making their own<br/>
chocolate milk in the kitchen, some days they show up at my desk with a<br/>
stack of books the size of Kentucky and demand I read to them until I am<br/>
hoarse, some days Brit teaches Mikey her ABCs, some days we play board games<br/>
(Yahtzee Junior and the Lego Game are the current favorites), some days Brit<br/>
teaches the cats new tricks (we are collecting cat training books for her,<br/>
you&#39;d probably be shocked to find out how many cat training books exist)...<br/>
<br/>
...well, you begin to perceive the problem with answering about average<br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
We live. We do what we want to do, within the limits of the law and each<br/>
others sanity. That&#39;s our average day.<br/>
