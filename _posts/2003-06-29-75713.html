&gt; cool that in one weekend Julian will hear people like Tom Hayden, Julian <br/>
&gt; Bond, Frances Moore Lappe, etc. speak.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; VERY cool!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, definitely very cool. The highlight yesterday was hearing Jonathan Kozol <br/>
speak. Obviously his aim is toward making public schools better for kids, and <br/>
more equitable for children of color and poverty, but he was amazing, talking <br/>
about the abuse of  the current trend toward holding children who have never <br/>
had any of the support they need at all &quot;accountable to standards.&quot;  <br/>
Brilliant, warm speaker.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;the first was on modern slavery (there are more <br/>
&gt; slaves in the world today than any time in history, including many in the <br/>
&gt; US) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Absolute numbers, or proportionally?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With six billion people there are more of EVERYTHING people-wise, I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; guessing.  <br/>
&gt; Anyone know when it was three billion and when we&#39;re expecting seven <br/>
&gt; billion? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s a proportional thing, I&#39;m guessing the definition of slavery has <br/>
&gt; been <br/>
&gt; amended to &quot;can&#39;t afford to move away&quot; (land-serfs &gt;&gt;factory serfs?).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both!  Absolute numbers is the important aspect though, because without a <br/>
glut of people, people are more valuable, according to the speaker, Kevin Bales, <br/>
who is considered a foremost expert on contemporary slavery. <br/>
<br/>
The way they define slavery is someone who is:<br/>
Controlled by violence or the threat of violence,<br/>
Forced to work for no pay,<br/>
having their labor used for the economic gain of another.<br/>
<br/>
There are several ways people typically beome slaves:<br/>
Extremely impoverished people, often living in shantytowns surrounding <br/>
cities, are lured with the promise of work, brought far from their families, beaten <br/>
and threatened with guns/death, and forced to work;<br/>
Women and children are often stolen and beaten and used in the sex trade or <br/>
as domestics, or both;<br/>
Or sometimes they are Debt Slaves, often held (again with violence) for <br/>
generations-old debts by a relation.<br/>
<br/>
In most of the countries where this happens, there ARE laws against it, but <br/>
often a corrupt government, especially police. <br/>
<br/>
In the US it is most usually trafficking in people, most often by people in <br/>
power of the person&#39;s own race, and used as domestics, for child care, and <br/>
sexually.<br/>
<br/>
In the numbers, they do not count even sweatshops where people make very <br/>
little. <br/>
<br/>
He said that there are some major differences in  slavery between now and the <br/>
1800&#39;s. Then, in the US, a healthy 19 year old male agricultural slave cost <br/>
the equivelant of $38,500 in today&#39;s currency. Today the same slave would cost <br/>
$90.<br/>
<br/>
Then, ownership was stressed and slaves were maintained (because they were <br/>
valuable).  Now, they are just usually used up, then killed, or more common, <br/>
just sent away. <br/>
<br/>
Julian asked for Bales&#39; book, Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global <br/>
Economy, and has started reading it.<br/>
<br/>
They have a good web site: &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freetheslaves.net/&quot;">http://www.freetheslaves.net/&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freetheslaves.net/&lt;/A">http://www.freetheslaves.net/&lt;/A</a>&gt;<br/>

Except that they do no real work.  There is no product of their labor.  They <br/>
&quot;work&quot; at writing on cheap paper, and most of it goes straight into the trash. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point Sandra. Too funny though, because first thing this morning DH and <br/>
I had a discussion about this very thing. Last nite we watched Gangs of New <br/>
York on DVD and although I fell asleep, DH watched the entire thing. When I woke <br/>
up I asked if he&#39;d made it through and he said, yes, most definately and to <br/>
make sure I finished it today while he and the twins were gone. He was suprised <br/>
at just how the Irish imigrants were treated by not only this country, but by <br/>
one another in the mid 1800&#39;s to 1900&#39;s. Which then developed into a rather <br/>
lengthy discussion on my grandparents and their families imigration from <br/>
Ireland. <br/>
<br/>
My great-grandfather was a West Virgina coal miner. He was very much in debt <br/>
by the slave like bartering system used then. He passed away of black lung <br/>
when my grandfather was only 8. My grandfather had to quit school from that day <br/>
forward and along with his 5 brothers, they had to dig their fathers grave and <br/>
bury him. He began working the next day. He also began smoking and drinking, <br/>
both of which were completely acceptable culturally. The Frank McCourt book, <br/>
Angela&#39;s Ashes, was in such parallel to my papa&#39;s childhood, my mother could not <br/>
get past the first chapter. Wow, I&#39;m going way off on a personal tangent now, <br/>
but I also wanted to mention that I lost another great-grandfather to black <br/>
lung, but in the mines of Arizona. I&#39;m not sure if it was geographical <br/>
difference, socio-economics, cultural attitudes or simply better personal finances, <br/>
because my Mexican great-grandfather was not in debted to his employer, nor <br/>
anyone else and his family was able to move to Los Angeles upon his demise.<br/>
<br/>
So much to look up even when it&#39;s only about one&#39;s own family history, but <br/>
somehow, IMHO never as tiring as research on stuff I don&#39;t want to know. <br/>
Unschooling at it&#39;s finest.<br/>
