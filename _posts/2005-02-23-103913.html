<br/>
My girls and I love talking about actors, recognizing them in various movies, and having the watching of one actor or director leading us to see something else.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been on a Steve Martin kick.  Best of from Saturday Night Live (now Lisa wants to see the Coneheads movie), Parenthood, and just today, Father of the Bride.  We watched a DVD of the Sonny and Cher show and discovered Steve Martin there too!  Fun!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking of Steve Martin and Peter Sellers, we have seen both of them <br/>
recently on old Muppet Show episodes.  There are several to choose from <br/>
if you have Netflix, and we&#39;ve really been enjoying them.  It&#39;s one of <br/>
the few things the kids like that we adults can stand to watch more than <br/>
5 times.  Other stars we have seen are Gilda Radner, Carol Burnett, <br/>
Elton John, and Julie Andrews, to name a few. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545026713">Hi...<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t  posted in ages, but....<br/>
<br/>
I have always loved Steve Martin. Other teenage girls<br/>
may have had posters of Scott Baio in their rooms. I<br/>
had Steve, in a shiny suit with a large fish sticking<br/>
out of his jacket. :)<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a bunch of books for my hubbies&#39;<br/>
birthday. ...among them Steve&#39;s &quot;The Pleasure of My<br/>
Company&quot;, and &quot;Shopgirl&quot;. Can&#39;t wait to read them. I<br/>
think the movie &quot;LA Story&quot; is my favorite.<br/>
<br/>
ALso, have you seen his appearance in &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;?<br/>
He plays a real jerk. (no pun intended.) I will seek<br/>
out these otehr ones mentioned. Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>
Gina<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739172763">My local library has Bowfinger.  We watched it this week.  Jackie wanted a movie for Friday night and chose Daddy Daycare.  She watched it last night, then I watched it with her tonight.  So there are two Eddie Murphy movies in one week.<br/>
<br/>
In the specials at the end of the DVD, Anjelica Huston comments on how well the 4 year old cast members understood the making of the movie because they watch movies at home.<br/>
<br/>
Jackie&#39;s friend (just turned 9), who is spending the night and watched with us said, &quot;I think they used real kids in that movie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That cracked me up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275630236">It&#39;s interesting to see them still trying to sort out the pretend<br/>
universe from the empirical universe, isn&#39;t it?  When she was little,<br/>
my eldest used to work on the Santa question . . . she knew he wasn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;pretend&quot; like a cup of pretend tea, because she saw his picture<br/>
everywhere . . . but she knew he wasn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; like daddy&#39;s real, either.<br/>
