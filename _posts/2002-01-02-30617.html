<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637451755">Dear list,<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve noticed lately that my Husband and oldest daughter (she&#39;s 8 years<br/>
old) don&#39;t seem to understand spoken words well.  I mean, I can tell them<br/>
a simple thing and they&#39;ll get that &quot;deer in headlights&quot; look and say, <br/>
&quot;So what are you saying??&quot;.  They&#39;re starting to drive me crazy!!  My MIL<br/>
is the same way.  Also, they generally don&#39;t like to admit they don&#39;t<br/>
understand what someone says to them ( its not just me) and they&#39;ll<br/>
either ignore it or get angry - I mean raise the blood pressure angry!! <br/>
Needless to say,  my dh didn&#39;t do well in school, since that&#39;s the main<br/>
way of doing things in instutiionalized places like that, and grew up<br/>
thinking he was dumb.  Its not the case, just that his mind works<br/>
differently than that.<br/>
<br/>
  My daughter doesn&#39;t read yet, which I&#39;m starting to think is connected<br/>
to this.  I&#39;m really glad we unschool, &#39;cause I&#39;m sure she would be<br/>
either passed over or labelled and shuffled off into special ed.   My DH<br/>
and MIL don&#39;t read well either.  They can actually look right at words<br/>
and not even read them!!  I love books and reading, so this is a really<br/>
strange thing for me!!! <br/>
<br/>
  Do any of you know people like this???  I really need to know how to<br/>
better communicate with them - fast!!  Thanks for your help!!  Djuana</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445063980">Jenni has the problem with auditory skills that you describe.  <br/>
Patience is the only cure.  But she is a voracious reader so the <br/>
similarity is not complete.<br/>
As for dealing with it, I don&#39;t even think about it much anymore.  It <br/>
had become natural to just watch and repeat to make sure she <br/>
understands.  And as she grew up, the problem must have subsided <br/>
quite a bit because I haven&#39;t noticed any problems with her lately.  <br/>
Thanks for making me think about it!<br/>

ps - she went to school until 2nd grade.  We asked for complete <br/>
testing because she was not thriving there.  They tested and found <br/>
exactly what we expected (an auditory cognizance problem) and said - <br/>
well the tests show she has problems understanding oral <br/>
communications but we aren&#39;t very fond of that test so since she did <br/>
well in everything else, we are going to ignore that result.<br/>
Needless to say, we started homeschooling shortly after that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a great thread if there ever was one! And a very pertinent point to <br/>
unschoolers everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Communication is a valid reason for why a *lot* of children don&#39;t fare <br/>
well in ps. Since ps is based on one form, and learning has many.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us were taught in a linear way. Most of us dont&#39; learn in linear <br/>
thinking form.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried to use less words and more hand gestures? Almost like your <br/>
own variation of signing.<br/>
<br/>
Do you notice how they communicate with eachother (physical playing or <br/>
melodic overtures in the conversation).<br/>
<br/>
Its going to take some detective work on your end to find the best form <br/>
of communication.<br/>
<br/>
Can you give us an example of what you mean by &#39;I can tell them a simple <br/>
thing&#39;?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547482724">Kolleen, you asked:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you give us an example of what you mean by &#39;I can tell them a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>simple <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thing&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve been watching for the last couple days and haven&#39;t come up <br/>
with anything.  The one thing that does come to mind is that when I <br/>
spell out words for her to write I can only give her one letter at a <br/>
time or she can&#39;t remember the first one.  I would give her 2 or 3 <br/>
letters of a word and she gets frustrated.  Her 6 year old sister <br/>
doesn&#39;t mind 2 or 3 letters at a time.  Different kind of kid, I <br/>
guess!<br/>
<br/>
  I notice that when I&#39;m relaxed it doesn&#39;t bother me as much.  So <br/>
many times this is the case, not just with this one thing.  If I&#39;m <br/>
not too stressed, everything is better.  Maybe I&#39;m the one who needs <br/>
better coping skills!!  Djuana</div>

stressed, everything is more than great.. when I&#39;m stressed.. those <br/>
insecurities do find their way into every moment!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>
