<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127218643">It happens to be one of my favorite shows on tv. The judge is in juvenile court. Tonight they had a court case about a little boy who kept running away from home to join the circus. Long sotry short, the boy felt like he didn&#39;t belong because he was so different from the kids at school and would keep running away to the circus because he could be himself. <br/>
<br/>
For the decision, Amy said to the parents that personally she would let the boy join the circus and either one or both parents could chaperone and homeschool him on the road. He could be happy and be himself. <br/>
<br/>
What a nice surprise, even though it was brief!!!<br/>
