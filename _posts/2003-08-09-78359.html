I agree.  If anyone has money problems this year, it&#39;s ME, but I&#39;m going<br/>
anyway.  We just bought a house so we have nothing left in savings.  We<br/>
moved in June 1st.  Somehow you end up with twice the regular monthly bills<br/>
when you move, I still can&#39;t figure that out.  My house is twice the size of<br/>
the one we moved out of which means we have half as much furniture that we<br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m from New England, the home of the Frugal Zealot.  I cut my dryer sheets<br/>
in half.  I think &quot;$200 for a hotel room or $200 for 4 very large and sturdy<br/>
bookcases that I really do need for my new library that I&#39;m making&quot;.  But, I<br/>
rationalized going by thinking that if my kids were in public school this<br/>
year I&#39;d have to spend at least that just in school supplies.   So, the<br/>
conference is my school supplies this year.  There are definately ways of<br/>
cutting costs to the conference.<br/>

Hi, Crystal --<br/>
<br/>
I swear the first time I read this I thought you were a frugal englot <br/>
from NEW ZEALAND.  I was *really* impressed that you would fly that far <br/>
for the SC unschooling conference &lt;g&gt;, but I was sure that it would be <br/>
worth it!<br/>

    I like the way you think. :-) We&#39;re looking for a house. Hopefully twice<br/>
the size of this one. Just getting started. We&#39;re not exactly liking the<br/>
idea of a house payment again but...I&#39;m starting to pack up things here that<br/>
we have accumulated over the last 20 yrs. Any ideas for good but cheap<br/>
boxes? Seems like stores cut them open now. :-(<br/>

will keep the boxes whole and what time is a good time to pick them up, <br/>
sometimes they will hold them for you.  I have done this before, works really well <br/>
at small local stores.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373327552">Thanks. Maybe the smaller stores would. I&#39;ve tryed the big chains and<br/>
they cut a lot of their boxes.<br/>
