Sandra,<br/>
How exactly do you approach a situation like this?  I have the hardest time in public when I witness other parents being hurtful to their children (not just through spanking but through belittling, saying hurtful things, etc).  I&#39;m always hesitant to, as you say, scold the parents because I&#39;m afraid the kid will just get it even more once they get home for &quot;embarassing&quot; their mother, or making her &quot;look bad.&quot;  Do you think that&#39;s possible?  That the mother will feel insulted and embarrassed and take it out on her child even more later?  It seems I&#39;ve often heard that caution when it comes to defending children that way.<br/>
Still, I want to come up with something to say.<br/>
<br/>
Recently my husband and I were having lunch at a little cafe with 2 of our children.  At the table next to us was a father and mother and 2 boys, mabye age 6 and 3.  The parents *never stopped* berating the children the entire meal.... it was like a run on criticism of their children for being children, with threats of punishment etc.  The father even told his kids that they were so rude they were disturbing the other customers eating around them.  It was on the tip of my tongue to call out to him &quot;actually, the children aren&#39;t irritating me at all, *you* are!&quot; but I totally chickened out. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I pretty much avoid playgrounds at their busiest times because I just can&#39;t stand to hear the way most mothers talk to their children, let alone witness spankings and slappings.  (&quot;Slides aren&#39;t for walking up, they&#39;re for sliding down!  If you don&#39;t listen you&#39;ll go in time out mister!&quot;  blah blah blah)...   <br/>

doctor said she had a minor concussion. It was really scary...  so of<br/>

This just made me think of some of the worst fractures I have seen are from the men falling from deer stands (it&#39;s that time of year again)....not from children.  I will also say that most of the breaks in children (that I saw) were from typical every day goofin&#39; off or those all too common accidents that happen to all.    Climbing trees, trampoline falls, fingers shut in the car door, and sports injuries.  The few times a toddler was brought in with a broken bone, the parents were just devastated because they felt so bad about not &#39;being there&#39; to prevent the fall/injury.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;People stifle toddlers too much in the name of safety.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was guilty of that myself with my first.  Much more relaxed with my second.  Actually, it was not too common for toddlers to come in with broken bones.  They are very resilient.  Most of the little ones just had a bump on the head....it seems like mine always had a bump/bruise from falling off of something so I guess I wasn&#39;t too stifling.  :) <br/>

<br/>
I think you were right to be concerned about her falling, but I would have <br/>
watched a moment before I rushed over and &quot;saved&quot; her...perhaps moved close <br/>
enough to catch if she did fall, until mom was more attentive.  All this time <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have drawn attention to myself, perhaps browsing the rack.  Then I <br/>
would have only not risked offending the mother, but not risked offending the <br/>
easily ticked-off toddler who may have been trying a new thing.  <br/>
<br/>
People stifle toddlers too much in the name of safety.  I find myself here <br/>
with no toddlers anymore, *gasping* when I see a little one fall, a rather <br/>
grandmotherly thing.  I&#39;ve forgotten altogether how to withhold that gasp and <br/>
remain calm and trusting of the child.  My perspective is very skewed.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know how that happened in 7 or so short years since I had a 2 yo.  I&#39;m <br/>
working on it.<br/>
<br/>
I think another perspective is a great thing to try, though.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but not because I was brave, because the mother was stupid.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t happen in all cases, and in any case in which it DOES happen, I <br/>
figure that kid will be leaving home a year or two sooner than she would have <br/>
otherwise.  Because only if kids get the idea that not all adults believe <br/>
what their mom is doing is right and good and necessary will THEY begin to <br/>
question.  <br/>
<br/>
And those parents, too, seem obviously to assume that all other parents will <br/>
agree with them or they wouldn&#39;t be hitting their children in front of other <br/>
people.<br/>

&lt;&lt; ** I know this isn&#39;t to me, but it is very possible and DOES happen. <br/>
Please do be nice and non-judgemental sounding if you decide to say <br/>
something!!!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Myranda, if you&#39;re too  nice and too non-judgmental you convey absolutely no <br/>
information or displeasure whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
It IS a judgment to think what that mother is doing is wrong.  <br/>
There isn&#39;t a really nice way to say &quot;Hey, too bad you&#39;re not smart enough to <br/>
be a better parent.&quot;  And I would never say that, but THAT is the emotion <br/>
that causes people to go out on a limb to say to other parents that they are <br/>
harming their child and disturbing the peace of and the future of others <br/>
around.<br/>

My example of the fox guarding the henhouse. If the child in his &quot;village&quot; <br/>

how will he actually KNOW that it CAN get better? Or that others believe it&#39;s <br/>
wrong?<br/>

I have never approached a total stranger about spanking. I&#39;m really a wimp. I <br/>
DO try to make eye-contact and empathize with the child. I&#39;ve mouthed &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry&quot;. And then I make eye-contact with the parent---and if looks could <br/>
kill....  If I managed to say something, I&#39;d probably go off screaming and <br/>
make very little sense. The parent would just think I&#39;m a lunatic.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve stopped people on a few occasions from harming children, including<br/>
one woman who was hitting her child yelling at him &quot;hitting it not ok!&quot;<br/>
I was flabbergasted and in a split second I realized that I was probably<br/>
never going to see these people again  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it have been a great fantasy moment (or might make a good cartoon <br/>
for changing people&#39;s lives) if you could turn big like The Incredible Hulk <br/>
and pick her up and slap her while saying in a big monster voice &quot;Hitting Is <br/>
Not OKAY!!!!&quot; and she wouldn&#39;t really be hurt (that&#39;s why it needs to be a <br/>
cartoon) and all the little kids who saw it would laugh merrily and no one <br/>
who was there that day would ever hit any child again.<br/>
<br/>
But in reality, a little child was being hit by an idiot in real life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you said something.  I&#39;m glad the mom stopped.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-485704459">&lt;&lt; And then I make eye-contact with the parent---and if looks could <br/>

<br/>
I think we all feel so very sad and often scared for the child and powerless to change the situation, when we see a parent hitting or otherwise hurting their children. It&#39;s a very triggering moment! Brings up a lot of personal pain for me too. <br/>
<br/>
I try to remind myself that, just like every child, every adult is doing the best they know how--in that moment with what they are given-- to communicate or meet their needs. Likely they are hurting even more and feeling even less powerless than we are. They are in one of their worst parenting moments (and on some level they likely know it) and don&#39;t know a better way! <br/>
<br/>
I think we all know what it&#39;s like to be parenting in ways we really wish we never would. I really don&#39;t believe glaring, shaming or blaming is ever going to help that parent or that child in that situation, or myself for that matter, except for a few moments of release... Isn&#39;t that a little like hitting someone and saying &quot;no hitting&quot;? If we glare or berate, aren&#39;t we just practicing the same &quot;i&#39;m right, you&#39;re wrong/bad&quot; attitude that that parent is transmitting to the child?<br/>
<br/>
But I definitely want to step in in some situations! And I do. If I can open my heart enough and it&#39;s not too threatening, I try address the parent compassionately. Just seeing them in this light can shift the whole situation. For example, in a camping situation where an overwhelmed mother had verbally lashed out and was then ignoring her howling child while she was putting up a tent, I asked the mother if I could help her cause it looked like she had a lot to do. She denied my help, but immediately softened, left the tent and went to comfort her child. <br/>
<br/>
Another time I stopped a father who was hitting his child in a parking lot by shouting &quot;stop hitting that child!&quot;. Turns out he was a minister and was hitting his child &quot;calmly&quot; and &quot;for his own good&quot;. We had a very long, very cordial conversation in which the little boy peeked out at me from behind his father&#39;s legs, and probably heard for the first time that there was someone who believed that love and hitting never go together, that there were ways that are far more conducive to learning how to manage yourself in life, and that Jesus never advocated hitting children.<br/>
<br/>
If I am too triggered to address the parent, I address the child directly. There are two good articles ont his topic at www.naturalchild.org by Jan Hunt under her child advocacy articles called something like &quot;Intervening for a child in a public place&quot;.<br/>

I think we can both remember a certain child who could climb anything, anywhere and made some of us in our support group uncomfertable. But, looking back on it now, I can see that what I may have seen as dangerous because my ds did not have the same large motor skills as this child and would have certainly hurt himself, his mother had complete confidance in his abilities to deal with high places.<br/>

had complete confidance in his abilities to deal with high places. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty was that way.   Brave and sure-footed.   He was at the top of a <br/>
straight, open slide on one of those playground extravaganzas with <br/>
rubber-coated platforms everywhere.  He was just sitting there, waiting, <br/>
looking, maybe figuring some older kid would offer to take him down, or maybe <br/>
waiting to go down on his own.  He was calm and happy.  There were five or <br/>
six kids he knew all within five or six feet of him on the platform behind <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
An older woman not with our regular playgroup said loudly to her friend <br/>
(actually talking to God and everybody, in that way people do sometimes) &quot;I <br/>
wonder WHOSE little BABY that is up there at the top of that slide?&quot;     <br/>
Something like that.  I was sitting with Kirby, who was three and too afraid <br/>
to go play by himself (a second phase of fear; when he was two he had been <br/>
brave, but sometime in that year he saw how someone COULD get hurt, and the <br/>
awareness made him kind of intellectually afraid of the heights.<br/>
<br/>
So I got up, under the cold stare of these grandmothers, and went and stood <br/>
and talked to Marty.  Are you okay?   <br/>
Yes<br/>
Do you want down?<br/>
No.  <br/>
Do you want to slide down? I&#39;ll catch you.  So I stood over there a while to <br/>
make them happy.  And that wasn&#39;t too terrible an idea anyway, having a mom <br/>
there.  But we hadn&#39;t been far and we all knew which kids in that whole crowd <br/>
were safe and which were shy and which were uncoordinated.  <br/>
<br/>
Another boy in that group for a while, when the kids were older, when he was <br/>
12 or so used to swing in a chain swing with a sling seat (typical playground <br/>
swings) and he would pretend to fall asleep when he was going really high, or <br/>
at least get very still.  The he would fall out forward, when the swing was <br/>
high to the back, and turn a flip and land on his feet.  <br/>
<br/>
Most of us were used to him doing that, but it would make new moms scream.<br/>
<br/>
But those of us who had watched him flip and jump and play knew he was safe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698494431">It sounds like you have a good reason to be fearful of the possibility<br/>
that the child might fall.  The first idea that occurs to me is<br/>
suggesting that the child stand in the basket - but assuming that the<br/>
basket is full or contains too much for child also to be in the basket -<br/>
is that one might offer to stand by (ready to catch without conveying to<br/>
the child that they are bound to fall) for a few minutes while the mum<br/>
keeps looking.  <br/>
