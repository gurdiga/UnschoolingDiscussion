A while ago, you posted something about Harvest Moon games for NES.  I was <br/>
reading on the Nintendo website that Harvest Moon 64 for N64 will be coming <br/>
out this summer.  I was reading about the game, it really sounds like a great <br/>
game to play.  I am planning on getting this one for my son.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Poke&#39;mon Snap for N64 will be released on July 26, 1999.  I have been <br/>
waiting for this one.  I almost be a gameboy for son to be able to play this <br/>
game.  I am glad that I waited, now I can spend the money the games instead.<br/>
