<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636473790">**Can he be invited to help(or does he already) with putting the materials<br/>
<br/>
together and doing the actual physical work of cutting and pasting? He may<br/>
have some surprising ideas about how some of the stuff he is doing will<br/>
convert.**<br/>
<br/>
And he may remember more than you about the year.  (My brain was really mush when I was pregnant.)  Or the two of you, reminiscing together may remember extra stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you are way &quot;lacking&quot; in History or Social Studies you can pad things out by renting some interesting historical videos.  If you are feeling obligated to add some Math, you might want to buy or borrow a Math computer game.  (I figure your feet aren&#39;t really up for, say, field trips, so I&#39;m looking for high interest learning stuff that combines well with sitting.)<br/>

** Yes he does help and in the past its been fun. Im looking for a<br/>
starting point but I cant find one. I know he sure has learned alot<br/>
about pregnancy, diabetes,insulin,ultrasounds, hospitals ,breeding<br/>
dogs and raising pups.**<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s your starting point.  Write it down all of these things <br/>
that he did or discussed last year.  Write it down in real language <br/>
first, with some detail, and when you are done doing that with his help, <br/>
then transform it into pompous teacher language.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591776540">I found myself looking for requirements for my sons grade today. I dont <br/>
normally feel the panic but this year has not been as productive looking as years <br/>
past and I needed ideas.  With portfolios a few months away I am beginning to <br/>
stress. <br/>
<br/>
I know he has learned a lot this year (esp medical stuff) but normally we <br/>
have a good mix.  I know I have not had as much time to sit with him and I feel <br/>
bad for that. I have between two and six weeks left in my pregnancy due to low <br/>
fluid and placenta issues due to diabetes so the coming weeks will be <br/>
nonproductive Im sure. <br/>
My focus is a bit off....  I also know a good month after the baby comes is <br/>
going to be trying for our family as well.  With two toddlers a 12 yr. old and <br/>
a new baby on the way I feel as If I am always asking him to wait until I tend <br/>
to them.  Not to mention we haven&#39;t been to many places other than shopping <br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
On top of the portfolio worries he is being contacted by girls who seem to <br/>
have taken quite an interest in him (not to mention look much older than he).  <br/>
If it isn&#39;t the computer it is the phone ringing. I know he is growing up but <br/>
the &quot;public school&quot; world is a bit too advanced for my comfort. I dislike my <br/>
feelings on this because I have always trusted his judgment but lately I feel <br/>
like I am dealing with issues everyday. Its not even him it is the other <br/>
children who do not live in my home.<br/>
<br/>
On the portfolio end its not really a lack of learning its more me converting <br/>
our life this year. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions? I feel much too much stress daily over all <br/>
of this. I was wanting to get almost all of my portfolio done so I could be <br/>
with my family in May/June but my brain is mush..<br/>
I cant help but wish we could just test him this year but I dislike that <br/>
greatly. I even stooped as low as asking him about curriculums today. UGH! I know <br/>
I am stressing him out and making him worry over nothing.<br/>

It&#39;s not good for the pregnancy to stress.<br/>

Maybe read this and see if you can find it in your heart to aid and abet him <br/>
to just invalidate his test score:<br/>

Another idea:   turn the portfolio in late.  Do it in July or August.  What <br/>
will they do?  Tell them you were having a baby and they can kiss your butt.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628736678">LOL,<br/>
Sandra, I have missed you! I went to digest a month or so ago thats <br/>
probably why I feel like Im sliding off my unschooling path.<br/>
<br/>
Im not late until the end of August BUT the teachers do them in <br/>
groups in June. So if I snooze I loose. I like the connect the dots <br/>
idea and the state only gets the name and dates the rest we can black <br/>
out but I have no clue where to buy a standardized test, ive looked.<br/>
<br/>
I know I could drag my way through a portfolio and I should just do <br/>
that but I know in my heart we have not done much and my friend who <br/>
is returning her kids back to school will be there. Heck we used to <br/>
go to the bookstore all the time and now the closest I get is Walmart.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just feel like I am lacking all the way around. I have been <br/>
moody (which is trigered when my blood sugar goes over 200),worried <br/>
and tired. I know this year is an exception but I dont want my son to <br/>
feel like he is lacking in knowledge because I am speaking my <br/>
stresses. I know I am rubbing off on him. <br/>
<br/>
Either way I want to get it done so i dont have to worry about it. <br/>
Maybe I just need to come off digest and back to the list to feel <br/>
better. LOL <br/>
<br/>
Laura~ Wishing August was sooner<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243538242">I&#39;m planning on having my kids collaborate with me on how to put their<br/>
portfolios together.<br/>
<br/>
I think it will help all of us.<br/>
<br/>
I never did it before because I don&#39;t want legal requirements to interfere<br/>
with real learning, but I think if we all keep it in perspective, (and I<br/>
know we will now) it will be fun.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what these portfolios will look like, but it will be<br/>
interesting.<br/>

knows it already. Last week we sat down and flipped trough Saxon 65 <br/>
and put it back in the book case because he knows it and not from <br/>

year.<br/>
I know last year I told her that my main want was for him to find his <br/>
way to reading for fun and he did. She said that alone was all she <br/>
needed to see that he was thriving. She is an unschooling minded <br/>
teacher. I went last year with such an exciting layout that I <br/>
motivated others to look into unschooling. I just want my full flame <br/>
back. <br/>
<br/>
I see ive written several things I can use in the portfolio. Im off <br/>
to make notes. Maybe I can get this thing done by the weekend and <br/>
take that stress off my slate.<br/>
