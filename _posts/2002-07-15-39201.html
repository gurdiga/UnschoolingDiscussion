<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602646897">Hi there all<br/>
I havent posted much lately, we are SO busy with summer time activities. I<br/>
read all the posts though. :-)<br/>
My two kids have been unschooling since last fall and home schooling since<br/>
2000. I am very happy with how happy they are and how well they are doing.<br/>
My question in this: I see a huge back slide in their writing and spelling<br/>
since we have ceased any kind of forced practice. Did anyone else see this<br/>
and if so did you let it ride? Did it bother anyone else the way it bothers<br/>
me that their once beautiful cursive is now block printing that is barely<br/>
legible? I have not siad anything to either of them, but I find it really<br/>
bothering me! :-( I know - I know very petty. Please reassure me that they<br/>
will catch up to where they were and beyond! Thanks<br/>
God bless<br/>

<br/>
They may actually not have beautiful cursive again. They may be doctors<br/>
;-) I sure don&#39;t have beautiful cursive, neither does my brother. Neither<br/>
does my dad, but he is a doctor so it&#39;s okay . OTOH, we&#39;ve never *needed*<br/>
to have beautiful cursive. My brother writes his signature and prints<br/>
everything else, it works fine. <br/>
<br/>
As far as spelling, my take on it is that if they&#39;ve &quot;forgotten&quot; it then<br/>
it wasn&#39;t really learned, more like parroted. My daughter went to a<br/>
Montessori kindergarten where they thought she was just brilliant, and<br/>
had her adding and subtracting 5 and 6 digit numbers flawlessly. She<br/>
forgot how to do it within a few months of leaving the place - I don&#39;t<br/>
think she ever understood how it all worked, she just remember the<br/>
&quot;steps&quot; long enough to survive there. Two or three years later, when she<br/>
was playing games with scores that were 4 digits long or more and doing<br/>
them in her head her way became too laborious for her, she asked me about<br/>
how I was adding my score. I was using that same traditional algorithm,<br/>
adding the ones, carrying the tens, all that. She was fascinated, thought<br/>
it was the coolest thing, asked me to write her lots of addition problems<br/>
with zillions of digits, and has it down cold now.<br/>

<br/>
No, but I wanted to reassure you it was kinda petty.   How many of the adults <br/>
around you write beautifully in cursive?  Of those who do, how many actually <br/>
WRITE anything with it besides maybe grocery lists, an occasional check, and <br/>
Christmas cards?<br/>
<br/>
They probably will NEVER catch up to the forced-writing schedule school would <br/>
have imposed on them.  If cursive writing is a priority in your life...  WHY?<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s their typing?  Do they use the computer to write?  E-mail or anything?<br/>

Good point Dar. It is very true that they probably didnt really ;know; and that is why it is so easily forgotten.<br/>
Your kids were 7 and 5 and wrote in beautiful cursive??? Wow.<br/>
Actually my son will be 9 in October and my daughter will be 7 next month. I should clarify though that my son had beautiful cursive writing and his printing is barely legible now, while my daughter has forgotten EVERYTHING! This would even include how to write a 5 correctly instead it is backwards. I do see them growing in other ways but this is such a visible way to back slide that I feel bad that they are no longer good at things they were good at before unschooling. <br/>

Yes they do type and email on occasion.They are becoming proficient (sp?) at typing. Given their ages I am sure that it is relative and they will be quite zippy as they use computers more. <br/>
I know it is petty and that is why I am asking for reassurance. So thanks...... :-)<br/>

noticed that I misspelled some words over and over. Now that I use the spell <br/>
checker, I misspell those words less and, overall, the thing doesn&#39;t *ding* <br/>
at me as much as it used too! Another benefit of the computer, email, groups <br/>
et all, is that I type so much faster now. I don&#39;t use the hunt and peck <br/>
method anymore and have improved so much that I don&#39;t even look at my hands <br/>
while typing. (except for the b and v keys! @@ I mix those up all the time!) <br/>

improved then went back to where it was. Obviously it was just a hoop she<br/>
was jumping through, not something she needed for herself.<br/>
<br/>
My husband just taught a class for 11 yo schooled kids. My 11 yo daughter&#39;s<br/>
handwriting was similar. Better than some, worse than others. (Though she<br/>
doesn&#39;t do cursive.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please reassure me that they<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;ll write the way that is most useful and meaningful to them.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not a race, is there a need to catch up?<br/>
<br/>
What is the reason for legible handwriting? So we can read what we wrote. So<br/>
others can read it. If *they* feel it&#39;s important for others to read what<br/>
they&#39;re writing, then they&#39;ll write so others can read it. (If they&#39;re<br/>
leaving you notes about where they are, then it&#39;s reasonable to tell them<br/>
you need to be able to read the note. That *doesn&#39;t* mean they need to<br/>
&quot;improve their handwriting&quot;. It just means the note has a purpose and<br/>
writing legibly serves that purpose.)<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, if they&#39;re writing for their own pleasure, the important part<br/>
*for them* is getting the thoughts down on paper. It&#39;s *their* project<br/>
satisfying whatever internal needs *they* have. If they show it to you, it&#39;s<br/>
not really an important part of the process so if you can&#39;t read it or<br/>
understand it, it doesn&#39;t matter. That wasn&#39;t the purpose. Though<br/>
*certainly* ask questions about what you don&#39;t understand so they can<br/>
explain it. Work on understanding the idea rather than understanding the<br/>
presentation.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe look at what they put down on paper as a window that let&#39;s you peek<br/>
inside their heads. If you focus on how poorly you can see through the<br/>
window, it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll just close the window so they don&#39;t have to be<br/>
distracted by what is just a side effect of having ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can go through the mechanics of making something *look* nice. One of<br/>
the great successes of schools is getting kids to present other people&#39;s<br/>
ideas in a nice package to make it look like learning is taking place.<br/>
<br/>
Real original thinking is chaotic and messy. It doesn&#39;t test well. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t look nice. So it doesn&#39;t fit well with the factory model of<br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s the ideas that are the hard part. Don&#39;t worry about the<br/>
presentation. They don&#39;t need to present anything yet. What they need<br/>
practice at are having ideas.<br/>

<br/>
OH yes.<br/>
There are countless people who &quot;got A&#39;s in English&quot; but have never had an <br/>
original idea EVER.  They&#39;re proud and they are rewarded for commenting <br/>
blandly on literature, they&#39;re rewarded for being still in class, and <br/>
cooperative, but when they get out of school they don&#39;t know what their <br/>
ability to get words on paper in a pretty and well-organized fashion is good <br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the people on this list have probably done lots of real <br/>
writing--local newsletter, church bulletin, letters with real news and ideas <br/>
in them, reviews of books or movies, reports on problems for a city council <br/>
meeting or a club committee or a letter to a politician summarizing a change <br/>
or problem or request.<br/>
<br/>
Some have not, and this list might be the first real writing.  And this stuff <br/>
here, for all it&#39;s being written in pixel-light and binary mystery-code, is <br/>
VERY REAL, because it is read while it&#39;s fresh, by real people who are <br/>
actively seeking input an ideas.  And lives are changed--KIDS&#39; LIVES are made <br/>
better.  And families&#39; lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Beats the heck out of most of the other &quot;real writing&quot; examples up above.<br/>

  you need to be able to read the note. That *doesn&#39;t* mean they need to<br/>
  &quot;improve their handwriting&quot;. It just means the note has a purpose and<br/>
  writing legibly serves that purpose.)<br/>
<br/>
  Otherwise, if they&#39;re writing for their own pleasure, the important part<br/>
  *for them* is getting the thoughts down on paper. It&#39;s *their* project<br/>
  satisfying whatever internal needs *they* have. If they show it to you, it&#39;s<br/>
  not really an important part of the process so if you can&#39;t read it or<br/>
  understand it, it doesn&#39;t matter. That wasn&#39;t the purpose. Though<br/>
  *certainly* ask questions about what you don&#39;t understand so they can<br/>
  explain it. Work on understanding the idea rather than understanding the<br/>
  presentation.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe look at what they put down on paper as a window that let&#39;s you peek<br/>
  inside their heads. If you focus on how poorly you can see through the<br/>
  window, it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll just close the window so they don&#39;t have to be<br/>
  distracted by what is just a side effect of having ideas.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone can go through the mechanics of making something *look* nice. One of<br/>
  the great successes of schools is getting kids to present other people&#39;s<br/>
  ideas in a nice package to make it look like learning is taking place.<br/>
<br/>
  Real original thinking is chaotic and messy. It doesn&#39;t test well. It<br/>
  doesn&#39;t look nice. So it doesn&#39;t fit well with the factory model of<br/>
  education.<br/>
<br/>
  But it&#39;s the ideas that are the hard part. Don&#39;t worry about the<br/>
  presentation. They don&#39;t need to present anything yet. What they need<br/>
  practice at are having ideas.<br/>

unabirth.  My daughter has a midwife but has just about decided not to call <br/>
her for the birth.  (She&#39;s due August 3.)  It makes me nervous, which is <br/>
ironic since we had *her* unassisted.  &lt;g&gt;  She hasn&#39;t decided yet whether <br/>
she wants me there or not.  I&#39;ve told her I&#39;m quite happy to stay way in <br/>
the background, but that she might need help with the other kids at some <br/>
point.  They&#39;re 7 and almost 2.<br/>

I suspect your kids will end up with attitudes toward writing much like most adults have. Some like writing beautifully, and some write<br/>
only as needed.<br/>

is a BIG writer too. She writes everyday, in all matters and forms-stories, <br/>
lists, letters, poetry, journal entries, observations, whatever. My point <br/>
is, she gets lots of practice, she reads a lot and sees which way the <br/>
letters go and yet still reverses them sometimes. IT&#39;S OKAY! She&#39;s doing it <br/>
less and less and I only correct her if she asks. She&#39;s figuring it out on <br/>
her own and loving every minute of it.<br/>

I also have a 13 year old who is a non-writer SO FAR. He just hasn&#39;t felt a <br/>
real need yet to get his thoughts on paper. He can perform the mechanics of <br/>
writing, but has no real need to write quickly, neatly or with any meaning. <br/>
I&#39;m confident that he will though. He has always been on his own schedule of <br/>
learning and this will be no exception. When he needs it, he will learn.<br/>

I had to copy this part of your post and forward it on to my dh. My daughter is also 8 and does the same thing. It has been an issue with comments from my mil - and even dh. whenever she shows them something she has done they say &quot;this is nice - but how come your J&#39;s are backward?&quot; It drives me crazy. I find that sort of statement must be discouraging to her. She reads very, very well - and people - including dh seem to think that then she should write as well and realize that some of her letters are backward. Well, she does - but at this point doesn&#39;t seem too concerned about it. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, it was nice to read about someone else who does the same thing! <br/>
