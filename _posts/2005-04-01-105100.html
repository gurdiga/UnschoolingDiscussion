and are from my own notations and thoughts, so I encourage you to<br/>
get the book!)<br/>
<br/>
According to Ellen Langer, author of &quot;The Power of Mindful<br/>
Learning&quot;, the Seven &lt;&lt;&lt;MYTHS&gt;&gt;&gt; of Learning:<br/>
<br/>
MINDFUL learning involves the continuous creation of new categories,<br/>
openness to new information and the implicit awareness of more than<br/>
one perspective.<br/>
<br/>
MindLESS learning involves entrapment in established categories,<br/>
automatic behaviors in response to new signals and single<br/>
perspectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
1) MYTH: Basic skills have to be ingrained to the point of being<br/>
second nature. REALITY: We do not have to practice skills to the<br/>
point of them being automatic. We need to try out new skills in a<br/>
variety of ways, in different contexts and adjust them to our<br/>
strengths and experiences. Masters and experts at any skill have<br/>
learned to put their own twist on &quot;the basics&quot;. Trial and error are<br/>
fruitful. Learning something abstract (pen/paper or in the mind<br/>
only) and then concrete (hands, real life, for yourself) is<br/>
backwards. It should be the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
2) MYTH:Paying attention means staying still and focusing on only one<br/>
thing at a time. REALITY: &quot;Paying attention&quot; has been misconstrued<br/>
to mean &quot;focus on one thing for the prescribed amount of time<br/>
without focusing on anything else.&quot; Sometimes the distracting thing<br/>
warrants our attention and has fruitful learning associated with<br/>
it. Sometimes it is a stress reliever (which then we must ask, what<br/>
is stressful?). Sometimes we are distracted because we need to<br/>
think about the task at hand in a different way. It is natural for<br/>
the mind to seek variety and novelty. Mindless focus actually<br/>
desensitizes a person to the object.<br/>
<br/>
3) MYTH: Delaying gratification is important (work vs. play,<br/>
rewards, etc). REALITY: Work should not be wrought with pressure,<br/>
deadlines, fear of failure, fatigue, lack of choice and drudgery.<br/>
You can turn any work into &quot;play&quot;. Reward/punishment reinforces the<br/>
negative value of &quot;getting what one deserves&quot; - for the child and<br/>
their perceptions of others. Do things for the fun of doing them.<br/>
Find different ways to do them. Make them fun.<br/>
<br/>
4) MYTH: Rote memorization is necessary. REALITY: Memorization as a<br/>
strategy has no personal meaning and is not correlated with<br/>
successful application. We remember things of interest, things we<br/>
need to know and that pertain to our world.<br/>
<br/>
5) MYTH: Forgetting is a problem. REALITY: It is good to be able to<br/>
take a fresh look at things. To unlearn something is more difficult<br/>
than to learn it. Many paradigms need to be abandoned for new ones<br/>
as we gain information. Too much &quot;fact&quot; knowledge weighs down<br/>
creativity. Mindful information can be recalled in a variety of<br/>
contexts, whereas mindless information has to be recalled within a<br/>
similar context in which it was originally stored.<br/>
<br/>
6) MYTH:Intelligence is the ability to know &quot;the facts out there&quot;<br/>
and go from problem to solution in a linear, rapid fashion. REALITY:<br/>
One&#39;s own assumption of what is &quot;really out there to know&quot; compared<br/>
with one&#39;s own self evaluation of how well it is known can damage<br/>
the self esteem. Both &quot;what is out there&quot; to know and how much you<br/>
know change constantly. Intelligence is the ability to see from<br/>
multiple perspectives, knowing that none of them is optimal in all<br/>
contexts.<br/>
<br/>
7) MYTH: There are right and wrong answers. REALITY: Intelligence<br/>
is hobbled in our society by the obsession to get to achiev desired<br/>
outcome. Some answers are fitting for some contexts and unfitting<br/>
for others. Math presented in a step-by-step, &quot;this is how you do<br/>
it&quot; fashion is mindless. Better than teaching the skills is for the<br/>
person to &quot;learn to learn&quot;. Believe in your child&#39;s unlimited<br/>
intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
We should not value what we do well and devalue what we do not. We<br/>
shoudl not value some subjects over others. We should not consider<br/>
ourselves static and able to learn and function in limited ways. In<br/>
truth, we constantly change and adapt.<br/>
