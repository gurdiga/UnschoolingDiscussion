<div id="ygrps-yiv-356505419">&quot;Christianity comes from Christ, religion is man made.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
How do you figure? Christ didn&#39;t start a religion, he did turn the <br/>
status quo on it&#39;s head though.<br/>
Christianity is what started after he was gone. And by most accounts <br/>
is considered one of the major world religions. Are you disagreeing <br/>
with the view that it is? I have taken a World religions class and we <br/>
discussed Christianity as a major world religion. You are going <br/>
against common knowledge to say it isn&#39;t a religion.<br/>
I do agree that religion is man made, that part I can handle. But to <br/>
ignore Christianity as a major world religion seems crazy.  Here is <br/>
something I copied from a website dedicated to the comparison of all <br/>
the major world religions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are a multitude of forms of Christianity which have developed <br/>
either because of disagreements on dogma, adaptation to different <br/>
cultures, or simply personal taste. For this reason there can be a <br/>
great difference between the various forms of Christianity they may <br/>
seem like different religions to some people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many religions have several different denominations, or sects.<br/>
That is where the lutheran, prodestant, baptist etc.... comes in.<br/>
Christianity is, and probably always will be, a religion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686049543">For starters, I am an unschooler so I go against<br/>
common belief of most things.  Because of my own<br/>
experience in the Christian church I have seen how<br/>
most people even those who teach about world religions<br/>
haven&#39;t a clue about the spirituality of a belief.  <br/>
It is the head knowledge they teach about not the<br/>
heart knowledge. This applies to anything not just a<br/>
discussion on faith.  One who does not unschool cannot<br/>
possibly teach about it, he can teach about what he<br/>
knows from a book or from what others have told him<br/>
but not from his own experience.  Someone who is not a<br/>
parent cannot possibly write a book on parenting until<br/>
he walks the walk of a parent such can be said for any<br/>
belief.  It is the heart knowledge that makes it a<br/>
belief and the head knowledge without the heart<br/>
knowledge that makes it a religion.<br/>

I quoted a person named Leslie (who actually wrote the above crap) <br/>

That was the same person who is arguing that Christianity is not a <br/>

I have been very inspired and changed by many non parents and non <br/>

<br/>
In John 20:28 Thomas called him &quot;My Lord and my God,&quot; which Jesus didn&#39;t seem <br/>
to mind! Plus, Christians are told to honor the Son as they do the Father <br/>
(John 5: somewhere). <br/>
<br/>
In John 10:33 the Jews (who knew their theology) try to stone Him for making <br/>
himself out to be God.<br/>

 thing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s right you know.<br/>
There is SO much fear in many people&#39;s &quot;devotion&quot; that it&#39;s sad.<br/>
I was raised in a very strict denomination, so my experience as a child may <br/>
have been  somewhat similar to Sandra&#39;s.<br/>
Although our church shunned all &quot;wordly churches&quot; like the Southern Baptists <br/>
because they worshipped in a building, gathered money and such.<br/>
We worshipped in homes, wore dresses, long hair, never smoked or swore, and <br/>
talked in hushed whispers about anyone that left the faith as &quot;missing <br/>
out&quot;.....which meant you were going to hell for sure.<br/>
It was the ONLY way. They claim it&#39;s Jesus they are following. But it&#39;s <br/>
another religion intended to control people, even if most there don&#39;t realize <br/>
it.<br/>
The ministers give up everything to go and preach which was another way you <br/>
could tell it was &quot;truth&quot; and not a &quot;worldly church&quot;.<br/>
I wear makeup so I&#39;m going to hell for sure.<br/>
Rock music is evil, even if the lyrics are worthy. It&#39;s the us vs. them <br/>
mentality, very divisive.<br/>
If you visited one of the yearly retreats (conventions) you would see many <br/>
beautiful young children running around in little dresses and pant suits, so <br/>
cute. All these simple and long haired Mums, singing, worshipping, peaceful <br/>
feeling all about. And you&#39;d think it was nice, kinda old fashioned and nice.<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t realize the deep shunning that takes place regularly if you <br/>
don&#39;t fit the mold. Sometimes subtle, sometimes outright and blatant, but <br/>
always there.<br/>
Fear is a huge part of how they hold onto people, especially children. It <br/>
makes me ill.<br/>

Yes, I know that Jesus did not go to church.  My point was that he did not <br/>
confine himself to being at an organized place of worship.  Jesus spoke to <br/>
many and was followed as he lived his life.  People learned from him by <br/>
listening and watching and following him (much like the philosophy of <br/>
unschooling).  He touched lives of people that many in that society would <br/>
never have spoken to.  I encourage anyone who wants to learn more about <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378804415">Hey all,<br/>
Actually, I believe many religions at that time, didn&#39;t limit themselves to <br/>
one organized place of worship.  Many religions at that time (as today) had <br/>
altars in their own homes while some met in open-air locations, preached in <br/>
the marketplace, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
A fascinating book about pre-judeo religions and the melding that went on <br/>
with the incursion of the northern &#39;barbarian&#39; religion is Merlin Stone&#39;s <br/>
&lt;When God was a Woman.&gt;  I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d believe all of what she puts <br/>
forward, sociologically, but it&#39;s an interesting read and makes some <br/>

is referring to a group of believers, not a building. <br/>

&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Constantine believed that the Church and the State should be as<br/>
close as possible. From 312-320 Constantine was tolerant of<br/>
paganism, keeping pagan gods on coins and retaining his pagan high<br/>
priest title &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; in order to maintain popularity with<br/>
his subjects, possibly indicating that he never understood the<br/>
theology of Christianity. From 320-330 he began to attack paganism<br/>
through the government but in many cases persuaded people to follow<br/>
the laws by combining pagan worship with Christianity. He made<br/>
December 25th, the birthday of the pagan Unconquered Sun god, the<br/>
official holiday it is now--the birthday of Jesus. It is likely that<br/>
he also instituted celebrating Easter and Lent based on pagan<br/>
holidays. From 330-337 Constantine stepped up his destruction of<br/>
paganism, and during this time his mother, Helen, made a pilgrimage<br/>
to Jerusalem and began excavations to recover artifacts in the city.<br/>
This popularized the tradition of pilgrimages in Christianity.<br/>

assemble, not temples.  The buildings were called basilicas, and in the Roman <br/>
world they were used as indoor marketplaces (like malls) and places for civil <br/>
functions (like magistrates holding court).  Temples were shrines of a deity <br/>
and tended to be small.  They would not have been suitable for a large <br/>
congregation.  Basilicas were not shrines of the Christian God but houses of <br/>
the church (ekklesia = the assembly called out of the world).  These <br/>
buildings came to be called &quot;church&quot; (i.e. assembly) only because of the <br/>
association with the assembly held in them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Early Christian practice, which was in transition during the Constantinian <br/>
age, required the baptized to give up certain professions that compromised <br/>
the ethical standards of Christianity.  This is why some people, who occupied <br/>
military or civil offices, became catechumens but waited until they were near <br/>
death to be baptized.    It wasn&#39;t a death-bed conversion as much as a <br/>
recognition that Christianity stood for something that these converts weren&#39;t <br/>
in a position to personally embody.<br/>
<br/>
As for the popularity oif Mithraism, it was one of a dozen or more mystery <br/>
cults with their orientalisms that so fascinated 3rd and 4th century Greeks <br/>
and Romans.  Not too different than &quot;New Age&quot; religions today.  One would <br/>
have to question their staying power with or without the rapid spread of <br/>
Christianity in the 4th and 5th centuries.  As for being one of the world&#39;s <br/>
largest religions, remember that the rise and spread of Islam owed little to <br/>
Christianity, other than bumping into it in the Mediterranean world.  <br/>

<br/>
Has anyone read Pope Joan?  It is fiction about a woman who disguised<br/>
herself as a man and became Pope.  At the end of the book, the author talks<br/>
of evidence to support the possibility of their having been a female pope.<br/>
Very interesting.<br/>
