&gt; &gt; New to this list - interesting topics  Cody (7 1/2 yo) doesn&#39;t read<br/>
&gt; yet<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; is not at all interested in learning.  Phonics don&#39;t get it for him<br/>
&gt; - just<br/>
&gt; &gt; confuse him more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Becky,<br/>
&gt;   Welcome to the list.  It&#39;s nice to know that phonics confuses<br/>
&gt; someone<br/>
&gt; else. My mil thinks I must be wrong when I say that phonics makes no<br/>
&gt; sense<br/>
&gt; to my now 9 year old. :)  I also have a 7. 5 year old who has no<br/>
&gt; interest in<br/>
&gt; reading either.  Now, taking things apart, that he can do for hours<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; hours, not to mention playing video games.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My younger one, now age 9 and reading just fine, saw the teaching of<br/>
phonics as an insult!  She wanted to know what the words said (meant) so<br/>
she could make use of them to understand her world.  Imagine going to a<br/>
foreign country, seeing a movie poster and asking a friend what it<br/>
&quot;said&quot;, only have to have your &quot;friend&quot; do the &quot;sa, pah, foo&quot; thing to<br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
It works for some kids, not others. It works for some kids at a certain<br/>
age, but not for the same kids at another age.  Why do we have to assume<br/>
there is a &quot;right&quot; way?  I have never seen a healthy, non-traumatized<br/>
kid in a content-rich environment NOT learn to read, whether at 3,5,7,9,<br/>
or 11  -- what schools end up teaching is how NOT to learn to do so.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Phonics make no sense to me, and I&#39;ve been an avid reader ever since I<br/>
can remember.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the main reason I got great grades all<br/>
through p.s. -- I could quickly and easily read and write tests and<br/>
papers.  (I don&#39;t remember any of it though!)  Anyway, I was on my way to<br/>
our hs parkday and saw &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;danger&quot; on a sign and wondered, what<br/>
on earth are the phonics rules that a beginning reader would use to<br/>
figure out how to pronounce those two words (say them out loud if you<br/>
don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m asking).  When I brought it up at the park, a<br/>
mom (who used to teach in p.s.) explained that anger comes from the<br/>
German language and danger from French.  Well, I imagine that would<br/>
simplify things for the average 5-7 year old!<br/>
<br/>
My dd took off with reading this year.  She was 5 in Sep 98 when we<br/>
officially began hs.  I introduced some basic phonics, not in any<br/>
organized manner, and backed off the minute she seemed to lose interest. <br/>
I tried to get her to read some 3 letter words, but it was obvious she<br/>
was only guessing and didn&#39;t really get it.  Over the course of the year<br/>
I learned more about unschooling and gained some confidence that it<br/>
really is OK to let young children PLAY.  So we spent very little time<br/>
doing what most people consider school (like maybe an average of 30<br/>
minutes a WEEK).  In April and May it clicked for her and she now amazes<br/>
me with how well she can read.  I don&#39;t take any credit for her &quot;early&quot;<br/>
reading, she&#39;s just a verbal kid.  Except that I read aloud to them a<br/>
lot.  And dh reads aloud to them, and now they read aloud to us too (4<br/>
year old has memorized some of her picture books).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ironic that some schooling friends are impressed by this -- bc she<br/>
reads we&#39;re &quot;successful&quot; homeschoolers.  I know that this child has<br/>
always been verbal, at age two she could speak incredibly well.  But was<br/>
also the LAST one in our &#39;hood to ride without training wheels.  Soooo,<br/>
just to keep me humble, my 4 year old dd can&#39;t pronounce several<br/>
consonant sounds (even I can&#39;t understand her sometimes) & doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to stop wearing diapers.  I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be in speech therapy in ps, but<br/>
I believe she&#39;ll outgrow it.  (Her hearing is fine)  I meanwhile, am<br/>
striving to let go and let them be who and what they will.  It&#39;s so hard<br/>
to let go of all those school lessons after 16 years of it myself!<br/>

There&#39;s a lot of information out there about &quot;whole -to - part&quot;  learners.<br/>
And most schools teach in a &quot;part-to-whole&quot; schema.....I&#39;ve heard that whole<br/>
to part learners are more rare in adults,   wonder if it gets drilled out<br/>
during school years?!<br/>

Yes this is how I am too.  I learned phonics in first grade, but can&#39;t <br/>
remember<br/>
specifics.  Could someone please give me a brief description and some <br/>
examples?  My dd is interested in learning to read (she asks me to write<br/>
words for her in her &quot;journal books&quot;, but doesnt&#39; really recognize the <br/>
alphabet,<br/>
or understand that letters have sounds. All very confusing to her and I don&#39;t <br/>
want to confuse her more and get her frustrated and not want to learn to<br/>
read at all.  She just turned six, a very mature six, and very unschooled.  <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Ya&#39;ll will like this... One day, when Matt was about 6, he was walking<br/>
 through the kitchen. He stopped to look at the poster on the fridge. I<br/>

This is a great story.  You must save it for your/his journal!<br/>

  How did you pronounce the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;magi&quot; versus &quot;magic?&quot; Why did you change it?<br/>
  You do NOT read letters within a word from left to right - you HAD to <br/>
  know what was on the right of the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;magic&quot; in order to know how <br/>
  to pronounce the &quot;i&quot; correctly. You have to look at all the letters at <br/>
  once in order to read. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Wow, that doesn&#39;t say much for sounding things out does it? No wonder it is so hard!  I hear myself say this to my son all the time: &quot;okay, sound it out...well, in this case, this letter makes a different sound...&quot;   Mighty confusing!  Glad you shared that Pam ~<br/>
