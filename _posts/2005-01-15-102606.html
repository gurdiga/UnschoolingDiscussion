<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578309670">If there is anyone out there interested in learning about native peoples,<br/>
this is a neat website that is concentrating on the Maasai peoples of<br/>
Africa.  On this website you can read the journal each day and comment or<br/>
ask questions.<br/>

<br/>
One of the most celebrated peoples of Africa, the Maasai have roamed<br/>
the land for centuries, ignoring the national boundaries that sprung up<br/>
around them. But today, they are finding themselves increasingly<br/>
restricted and misunderstood by the modern Africa that now encircles<br/>
them. The traditional Maasai lifestyle is under pressure to change, as<br/>
the Maasai find themselves on a collision course with modern society.<br/>
<br/>
The Maasai Oral Histories Project will record and archive Maasai oral<br/>
histories, myths, rituals, stories, laws, and beliefs, which are<br/>
traditionally passed on by senior elders. Many recording sessions will<br/>
take place at local Maasai schools, in a context that allows<br/>
interaction between the elders and students familiar with new<br/>
technology.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Project will be an intercultural experience for<br/>
students in the United States. A classroom Study Guide has been<br/>
developed to introduce the Maasai Oral Histories Project to various<br/>
grade levels. Images and translated text will also be transmitted to<br/>
our field journal during December 2004 and January 2005. The<br/>
combination of our Study Guide and Field Journal allows the Maasai Oral<br/>
Histories Project to be easily integrated into existing social studies,<br/>
African studies or geography curriculum with images and text from the<br/>
recording sessions, along with age-relevant material to stimulate<br/>
interaction between Maasai and American students. If the technology and<br/>
circumstance allows, we will send and reply to classroom e-mail on a<br/>
daily basis.</div>
