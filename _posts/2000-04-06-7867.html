I SO agree with you! It is enough to make intelligent, caring, NON-paranoid<br/>
women wonder if there really is a patriarchal plot! How come even &quot;Living<br/>
Doll&quot; (you know that old Cliff Richard song? )well, its lyrics say &quot;Gonna<br/>
lock her up in a trunk/so no big hunk/can steal her away from me!&quot; Honestly<br/>
once you start listening to lyrics it is amazing how misogynist they are and<br/>
yet witness all the outrage over one song that paints a different picture?<br/>
GRRRRRRR<br/>
By the way, ever notice that there is no word for someone who dislikes men?<br/>
I know there is man-hater but that is a &quot;made-up word&quot; if you will. It is OK<br/>
to be misanthropic (hate everyone) or misogynist (hate women) but hating<br/>
Just men??? nah, why would anyone?? (Sarcastic voice and mean eyes!!)<br/>
For every one film like Thelma and Louise (in which I think they killed one<br/>
maybe two men and yet the movie critics etc referred to their &quot;murderous<br/>
rampage!!!&quot;) there are hundreds that depict women being disrespected,<br/>
assaulted, raped or killed! I am NOT advocating that we make more films<br/>
showing women abusing or assaulting men - just pointing out that even today<br/>
women&#39;s mistreatment is the norm.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>
