<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063915332">This is an unadvertised early way before the holidays special. If <br/>
you haven&#39;t heard about this go to the sites listed below to read the <br/>
full lawsuit and settlment terms posted on the K-B site, and to <br/>
locate a K-B store near you. To qualify for this discount you must <br/>
purchase $30 or more in the store from October 8-14. All purchases <br/>
qualify, but the amount must total $30 or more. <br/>
<br/>
Since some folks have encountered resistance in the stores, saying <br/>
that electronics and other things do not &quot;qualify&quot; I would suggest <br/>
printing out a copy of the settlement from the web site listed below <br/>
and taking that with you to the store to pull out in case they say <br/>
something like that to you. Then just ask them to show you where in <br/>
the settlement it says that such-and-such purchases do not qualify <br/>
for the 30% discount, which is to be in addition to any other <br/>
advertised discounts, by the way. <br/>
<br/>
Here is the K-B web site with the full details on this suit and <br/>
settlement:<br/>

So, kids, how do we figure percent? Sounds like a great math <br/>
opportunity.<br/>

exclusions:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The qualifications are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Excludes Gift Cards, Video Now products, video games, systems and<br/>
accessories. Discounts taken off lowest ticketed prices at register.<br/>
Sales taxes are not valid toward the $30 purchase requirement. Not<br/>
valid toward previous purchases.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Guess that makes it perfectly clear. <br/>
