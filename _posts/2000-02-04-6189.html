<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880915895">&lt;&lt;What else do you like to read?  Right now I&#39;m reading a book by the Dali Lama or rather a phd and him<br/>
called &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read _Happiness is a Choice_ by Barry Kaufman? He and his wife had a profoundly autistic boy with whom, as I remember it, they tried all the known treatments (this was 20-25 years ago). Nothing worked and they began developing their own techniques, mostly involved unconditional love and acceptance. Their profoundly autistic son eventually graduated from an ivy league college!<br/>

Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading this a few years ago, and loving it, it&#39;s a wonderful <br/>
example of how powerful and healing unconditional love is, and also &#39;thinking <br/>
outside the box&#39; and following your instincts.  I loooooove books,,but i <br/>
haven&#39;t been keeping up too well with the list lately, so i don&#39;t know if <br/>
it&#39;s been mentioned,,probably has,,,,,but for a quick read, but deeply <br/>
meaningful book, &#39;Tuesdays With Morrie&#39; was awesome.  I read it a few years <br/>
ago and fell in love with it.<br/>
