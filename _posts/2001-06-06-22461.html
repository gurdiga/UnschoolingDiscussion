 severe is when those dogs in a California  building mauled a woman.<br/>

Ive been handling real guns since I was 10 - before that only bb guns.<br/>
Oh, I learned gun SAFETY as i learned to walk, but that&#39;s not the same<br/>
thing *G*.<br/>
<br/>
My son goes out with me to the shooting range and is eagerly awaiting<br/>
HIS first bb gun, &#39;cause responsible behavior with IT means he&#39;ll get a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536839249">My parents were both hunters, and together taught hunter-safety classes (gun <br/>
handling, primarily) so the other kids at school thought it was TOTALLY cool <br/>
that I was their kid, but I myself hated guns and wouldn&#39;t deal with them.  I <br/>
fired a hunting rifle once, at my dad&#39;s insistence, and I got hit in the face <br/>
with the scope.  When my dad offered me one of his collection before he sold <br/>
it off, I declined.  I feel kind of bad about that, because it hurt his <br/>
feelings.  Now I wish I had taken the WWI Russian infantry rifle.  But I <br/>
didn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t own a gun.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lived where my mom had to pull a snake out from under my bed and kill it <br/>
with a hoe.  A copperhead, I think.  I was four or so, and didn&#39;t get to <br/>
examine the body.  I remember her being VERY forceful, and later scared, and <br/>
my dad being concerned when he got home.  We lived near Benbrook lake, <br/>
pre-suburbs, on farmland, near Fort Worth.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was older, my dad usually had a rifle on a gunrack in his pickup <br/>
because he worked at very remote locations in New Mexico, sometimes all by <br/>
himself at mining sites (on equipment) with nobody around for many miles, and <br/>
there are lots of hungry wild animals in the West.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661948728">I&#39;ve been around guns my entire life.  First shot them on a firing range on<br/>
my grandmother&#39;s farm (in Idaho, I might add!) when I was about 6 or 7.<br/>
Took gun safety classes at the local elementary school at 8 or 9 and my<br/>
father was the instructor.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult I also own guns.<br/>
<br/>
I have also had the unfortunate experience of being on the receiving end of<br/>
a gunshot wound...so have a very healthy respect for them!<br/>
<br/>
Have lived in rural, urban and suburban areas in several states within US of<br/>
A as well as 4 years in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I was raised in an abusive household and have had the<br/>
experience of having the police forcibly remove me and my siblings from our<br/>
home when our mother was not there and we were not in any sort of imminent<br/>
danger.  (Interesting to note that even though there was active abuse going<br/>
on, that was never addressed by any set of authorities and that was not the<br/>
justification for removing us from our home.) I was 16 at the time and old<br/>
enough to legally be left to babysit other families overnight or for more<br/>
than one day, so I think I was capable of taking care of myself and<br/>
siblings.<br/>
<br/>
So, am I qualified to have an opinion on these matters?  &lt;g&gt;  Am I informed<br/>
enough to KNOW what has happened in Idaho...?  I don&#39;t think so.  Even I can<br/>
only form personal opinions.<br/>

&gt;Are you&nbsp; recovered from your wound?&nbsp; Are<br/>
&gt; there lasting problems?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, all better, thank you.  It happened when I was a youth (11 or 12).<br/>
Wound to the chest, with the pellet lodged against a rib.  Took a couple<br/>
hours of surgery to remove.  Very happy that it was &#39;only&#39; a pellet gun and<br/>
that it lodged against a rib rather than going through my lung or heart.<br/>
It was a traumatic experience, for sure.  Basically only left a scar and an<br/>
even healthier respect for the power of guns and reinforcement to follow my<br/>
personal instincts.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your post.  It&#39;s nice to know I&#39;m not the only one with such a<br/>
&#39;checkered past&#39;.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

boonies (we are soooo picky it even bugs me &lt;g&gt;), we will again have guns.<br/>
I learned young as there were many hunters, military, cops and even one<br/>
chief of police in the family and everyone felt that regardless of<br/>
ownership, a person should know all about the use of a gun.<br/>

I&#39;ve never hunted game but have shot dogs.  When you have (we had) a large<br/>
