<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279402462">When my dd was about 2yo, we were watching the 3 tenors.  She stood next to <br/>
the tv and sang with them.  We muted the tv and she kept singing, we turned <br/>
it back on when the audience began clapping.  She looked at the tv with a <br/>
smile and a look that meant the applause was for her.<br/>

&gt;My first operas were Gilbert and Sullivan, although I think that they <br/>
&gt;ruined<br/>
&gt;me for &quot;True&quot; opera or more adult opera. They are fun but not such a good<br/>
&gt;intro to the beauty that opera can have.<br/>
&gt;I think kids will like  to hear The Three Tenors, and now there is a newer<br/>
&gt;trio called the Three Mo&#39; Tenors. They sing a more Jazzy style, mixing <br/>
&gt;blues,<br/>
&gt;jazz and opera.<br/>
&gt;If your local TV stations will show the &quot;Pageant of Peace&quot; White house Xmas<br/>
&gt;tree lighting, they will be performing. Also on the bill are Sandra&#39;s<br/>
&gt;favorite &quot;new age poofs&quot; Manaheim Steamroller.<br/>
