<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692106858">First of all - if I say something wrong, please don&#39;t get offended at <br/>
my ignorance.  Kindly correct me, please...<br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;m curious about different religions, what they believe, <br/>
etc.  Not to be converted or anything, I&#39;m happy with my current <br/>
choice of religion, I&#39;m just curious.  So if anyone would please e-<br/>
mail me privately (I really don&#39;t want to start a religious argument <br/>
on this list) about their religion (no matter what) - like basic <br/>
beliefs, what you believe about deity, holy books, what you believe <br/>
about purpose for earth life, the history of your religion, etc.  <br/>
Please, only if you really know, and not just what someone <br/>
in &quot;authority&quot; told you about another religion (I can get all that by <br/>
going through a search engine, which I&#39;d rather avoid).  Then, I&#39;d <br/>
like to email you with individual questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

Thanks for the info. on www.religioustolerance.com. We live in an area<br/>
with a great diversity of religions, and my kids have asked me why sikhs<br/>
wear turbans. Now I can give them a well informed answer.<br/>
