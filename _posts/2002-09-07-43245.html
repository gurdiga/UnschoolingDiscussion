<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469707695">I feel I must take some responsibility if feelings have been hurt with<br/>
this thread.<br/>
<br/>
In my glee at finding like minds here<br/>
- during the very week all the &#39;school kids &#39; were forced to return to<br/>
their desks and my children were repeatedly assaulted with the usual<br/>
refrains of  How is school? Do you like your Teacher? Even had one woman<br/>
get in my 9 yo dd&#39;s face and demand to know, when my dd said &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
&#39;go&#39; to school, I homeschool&quot;,<br/>
&quot;Well, when do you start LEARNING?!- as if the process could only<br/>
legally &#39;start&#39; on a certain day of the year.-<br/>
I may have been a bit rambunctious in my &#39;classroom in the basement-ammo<br/>
in the closet&#39;- description of Christian Homeschoolers and it was never<br/>
my intent to offend.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, I have even had this discussion with my own husband of<br/>
late.. We had some homeschooling friends over for dinner and that couple<br/>
and I were comparing notes on our mutual failed attempts to join local<br/>
homeschool co-ops and field trips due to the fact that, by and large,<br/>
those groups are made up of Right Wing Christian Homeschoolers who<br/>
actively seek to exclude our children from their activities because<br/>
according to them we do not belong to &#39;a Bible Believing Church&#39;. My<br/>
friends are devout Catholics and Deacons in their Parish but that is not<br/>
enough for some reason.<br/>
My husband considers himself a Christian and took offense to our<br/>
generalizations regarding the term.<br/>
Now, this guy is utterly brilliant on many levels but .. think absent<br/>
-minded professor... to say he is not dynamic, not &#39;up&#39; on current<br/>
events, national trends... well, that would be putting it mildly. We<br/>
gently gave him an overview of the last few decades of  &#39;Christian&#39;<br/>
agenda in America.  We came to an agreement that, yes, it is a very sad<br/>
commentary when the term Christian has become associated with such<br/>
hideous ( go to the plumbing supply store to buy implements with which<br/>
to abuse your babies) behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
My blurb about basement classrooms, etc. was all from personal<br/>
experience. We left what should have been a wonderful &#39;co-op&#39; experience<br/>
for my daughter- who was very excited about attending- when it was made<br/>
clear to us that we did not &#39;belong&#39;. My daughter was looking forward to<br/>
some craft classes and sewing instruction that was being offered just a<br/>
few hours one day a week; it all fit into my &#39;unschool&#39;  way of doing<br/>
things. The co-op was billed as non-denominational, no &#39;commitment of<br/>
faith&#39; signatures were required. Yet, there were prayers before every<br/>
session, Halloween costumes forbidden, no parent would ever &#39;allow&#39;<br/>
their child to come play at our house...it was there that I was given<br/>
the rundown of what ammo their closets contained. It was within that<br/>
group that a 6 yo little girl girl related to me how she was &#39;whipped&#39;<br/>
on any day that she she did not &#39; finish writing all her sentences.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
While generalizations can be detrimental they exist for a reason; there<br/>
is an element of truth in even the most general generalizations. It is a<br/>
numbers game....&#39;Christian&#39; homeschoolers have purposefully created<br/>
their image. &#39;Christian&#39; homeschoolers do *indeed* have an agenda. They<br/>
are, in fact, mostly Republican Right Wing voters with money.  And<br/>
lawyers. And testing. And an unhealthy notion of &#39;accountability&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Despite all the mean spirited, non inclusive actions I believe the<br/>
greatest sadness is the fear they habitually instill in their children.<br/>
The fear their children spread to others...The &quot;My Mommy says you are<br/>
going to Hell because you have a Barbie lunch box&quot;, ( direct quote)<br/>
mentality. Fear is as abusive as switches and plastic tubing.<br/>
<br/>
If you are reading this and have not personally experienced such<br/>
actions, I envy you. It is pervasive throughout most homeschooling<br/>
&#39;communities&#39;.<br/>
Just as my husband is offended, rightly so, by derogatory references to<br/>
&#39;Christian&#39; so, too, am I offended by those who assume that because I<br/>
homeschool  I am a &#39;Christian&#39; -aka , abusing parent, satellite<br/>
curriculum subscribing, test administrating, submissive woman.<br/>

  Dear Judy, oh, yeah -- because the second description is *so* much more flattering than the first!!   ( I am kind of reminded of John Cleese in &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; where he is trying to welcome the Germans and not at all mention &quot;The War&quot;) &lt;Major grin -- I am not yelling, I am giggling&gt;   I am Christian, and a homeschooler, and laughing my head off at your description!  The Christian homeschoolers in my city won&#39;t *let* me sign their statement of faith, and I have been elected as one of the presidents of the other homeschool group, referred to as the &quot;Pagan Heathens&quot; (the other presidents are UU and a lapsed Catholic).  I have not been offended by anything said on this thread -- I too am appalled at the notion of &quot;caning&quot; my kids.  I also realize that I am not your typical, representative Christian (nor would I want to be).  I have been challenged at times by statements made here, but it is just a good opportunity for me to firm up exactly what I believe -- to take in other&#39;s experiences and opinions, and learn and re-evaluate.  I just automatically assume that none of you are out to offend me personally -- you don&#39;t even KNOW me, much less my buttons!  Debi<br/>

And that&#39;s just the little kid version.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s big and it&#39;s awful and many of the moms don&#39;t even want to homeschool, <br/>
they&#39;re doing so in obedience to God and their husbands (and pastors, and <br/>
church pressure).<br/>
<br/>
So when I&#39;m criticized sharply for stating simple and proveable fact by <br/>
people who don&#39;t want to know those facts, it&#39;s fascinating for me and <br/>
irritating.    No number of &quot;Well I&#39;m Christian and I&#39;m not that way&quot; can <br/>
make the slightest dent in the lumbering behemoth of Christian Homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not meanness to tell people what some other homeschoolers are basing <br/>
their lives on.<br/>

  &quot;The Christian homeschoolers in my city won&#39;t *let* me sign their <br/>
  statement of faith&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Why?<br/>
<br/>
  Because I don&#39;t fit into their square peg of what a Christian is (Nicean creed, etc.....that kind of stuff is in the archives).  Anyway, I am not a Christian homeschooler, but rather a homeschooler who is Christian.  Seems like a silly distinction, but there really is a difference!    Debi<br/>
