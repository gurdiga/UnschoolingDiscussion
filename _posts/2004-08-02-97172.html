&lt;&lt;  What do I do in the<br/>
meantime to cope?  I don&#39;t want to give up.  Like I said before, the<br/>
afternoon is the hardest, so I make my plans accordingly - no changes during<br/>
those times to stress me more.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you look at diet?  Can you eat more protein before that time?  Put on <br/>
cheerful music?  Can you put on a mostly-quiet, peaceful movie that you and the <br/>
kids all enjoy (doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;ve seen it a dozen times) and darken the <br/>
room a bit, and just be relatively still?  Maybe they&#39;ll fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I feel so hopeless about being able to keep them home. I&#39;m<br/>
not willing to give up but I am just aching and sinking. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems you&#39;re not breathing and calming yourself.<br/>
Can you practice long, deep, held breaths, let out through the mouth, in <br/>
through the nose?  If you know a form of meditation, just do that, or take a <br/>
meditation class if you&#39;d rather have someone tell you exactly how and talk you <br/>
through, but ten breaths in and out will slow your heart down and clear your head.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I am treating my kids very much like I was treated minus the hitting.  It <br/>
is killing me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
How is it for them?<br/>
<br/>
I think if you put them first you will yourself feel instantly better.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you continue to see them as needy obstacles to your peace, you <br/>
(and they) will continue to feel unsettled (or worse).<br/>
<br/>
If you were bleeding and we said &quot;Put pressure on the wound,&quot; would you do <br/>
it?  Or would you keep typing and posting that you hated blood but it just kept <br/>
coming?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I just never . . . I get scared right away at the thought. . . I<br/>
literally sink in my chair. . ..I feel so guilty . . . I wanted to be . . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what you&#39;re writing and thinking and feeling and expressing and <br/>
breathing and sleeping and eating.  &quot;I never..scared...sink...guilty...wanted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Breathe.<br/>
Do.<br/>
Smile.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should do two positive, sweet, light things for every moment of <br/>
whining you want to reward yourself with.  Because from the posts, it honestly <br/>
seems you&#39;re addicted to this pity and fear.  I could be wrong, but what if <br/>
I&#39;m right?  If I&#39;m wrong, it hardly affects my ratings. &lt;g&gt;  If I&#39;m right and <br/>
you&#39;re willing to consider it, it could change your life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This doesn&#39;t have to be so hard!!!  I&#39;ve got books, websites, people. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t know how to ride a bike, it wouldn&#39;t help a bit for you to have <br/>
books, websites, people, coaches, private bike trainers and fifteen bicycles. <br/>
 WOULD NOT HELP.  Would only waste your time and energy having accumulated <br/>
all that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
You have to get the bike out and try to ride it.<br/>
And don&#39;t try to ride it just to prove you can&#39;t.  <br/>
If you don&#39;t want to ride the bike, just don&#39;t.  Admit you can&#39;t, and don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered putting your kids out for adoption?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing no.<br/>
But you don&#39;t HAVE to mother then.<br/>
You want to?<br/>
<br/>
Get on the bike.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Addicted to Unhappiness&quot; talks about how traditional parenting methods set<br/>
people up for unhealthy dramas later in life&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can read some of the pages at Amazon as well as reviews by readers:<br/>

Here&#39;s part of the description:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Addicted to Unhappiness is based on their own clinical research into the<br/>
&gt; nature of children&#39;s love for their parents and the way in which it fosters an<br/>
&gt; unrecognized &quot;addiction&quot; to unhappiness that follows them into adulthood. In<br/>
&gt; their work with hundreds of children and adults, the Piepers discovered that<br/>
&gt; when discipline and excessive expectations are imposed on young children, they<br/>
&gt; learn to equate feelings of unhappiness with loving relationships. This<br/>
&gt; misidentification persists into adulthood and explains why so many adults<br/>
&gt; create unhappiness in the process of seeking happiness and love. This<br/>
&gt; unrecognized self-sabotage is the explanation for diverse yet common problems<br/>
&gt; such as overspending, fear of new situations, romantic choices that break<br/>
&gt; hearts, and career mishaps. Addicted to Unhappiness offers a plan for life<br/>
&gt; that helps readers understand their secret need to be unhappy, overcome it,<br/>
&gt; and reclaim the happiness that is their true birthright. In the process, they<br/>
&gt; will learn to conquer health problems including destructive moods, overeating<br/>
&gt; and lack of exercise; build strong, lasting relationships; and achieve career<br/>
&gt; satisfaction and success.<br/>

<br/>
i agree, try to focus on the accomplishments - no matter how small.<br/>
<br/>
also, don&#39;t focus on it being easier for everyone else.  it is a challenging<br/>
thing to be a parent.  for everyone. seeing how other&#39;s do it doesn&#39;t help<br/>
unless you can see them 24/7 for a few months or years.  that way you can<br/>
see how they handle their challenges as well as the easy stuff (for them).<br/>
