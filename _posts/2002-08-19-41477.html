<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303025532">I have a fifth grader this year that will be tested. I am one that <br/>
if the law say do it, I will. I have had my 2 older children take <br/>
these tests and just as another person said the test do not i.d. <br/>
anyone. Infact I kind on enjoy the testing days because my children <br/>
have out done the state of Arkasas for years. <br/>
I would never put my child into such a pitiful school system. For <br/>
the people that do not know, Arkansas publishes how well the public <br/>
schools do on these tests each year and each year they average a &quot;D&quot; <br/>
across the board. If the state can get by with making these grades I <br/>
guess they don&#39;t think that they can pick on us that educated our <br/>
children at home. <br/>
Infact they toot their horn saying that they push mathmatics and <br/>
science in this state which is true to a degree but most of the p.s. <br/>
kids never learn to read until they are in 3-4 grades in Arkansas. I <br/>
used to be the director of a children&#39;s church in NW Arkansas and <br/>
saw and heard these kids weekly trying to  read without and reading <br/>
skills ever being taught to them. I would tell them a phonics rule <br/>
of two and the kids would go crazy saying why doesn&#39;t my teacher <br/>
tell me these rules and why do your kids read so much better than I <br/>
can. These kids were all p.s. children from 3-6 th grades and my 1st <br/>
and 2nd grader put them to shame. <br/>
So from one home educator to all you others I say bring on the tests <br/>
any day. <br/>
Just a note... <br/>
I taught all 4 of my children to read by the time they started <br/>
kindergarten.</div>

 <br/>
How did you do that? I&#39;m assuming they all wanted to read at an early<br/>
age. I&#39;m new to this list but have been unschooling for many years. Our<br/>
oldest read on his own before he was 4. We didn&#39;t teach him. Our<br/>
youngest still is not really reading and is 10. Just curious what worked<br/>
for you, Jane :-) <br/>

<br/>
Why? :-)  Tests don&#39;t prove anything - except maybe test taking ability on that particular day..even than I am not sure...While we are new to &quot;full unschooling&quot; ( funny term, I know), since January this year, we are not new to relaxed homeschooling and we have never had our kids tesetd - I say try to avoid the tests as much as possible! lol!..Leonie<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I say you are hurting other unschoolers with that attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about letting kids be in charge of their own <br/>
education.  Some kids are not going to be interested in academics <br/>
until  much older than they would have been forced to learn it in <br/>
schools.  Those kids are not going to do well on tests, at least until they <br/>
*have* gotten interested in academics.<br/>
<br/>
Those who support testing homeschoolers are mostly &quot;school at home&quot; people, <br/>
who want to &quot;prove&quot; that homeschooling is better.  They would like it if <br/>
all our &quot;non-academic&quot; kids were forced into school.  Never mind that it <br/>
would be the worst thing that could happen to our kids.  It would make <br/>
their kids (and them) look better.<br/>

<br/>
Just a note:  Your children learned to read.<br/>
Your &quot;teaching&quot; them only worked because they were ready.<br/>

<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t always define or think of your children as &quot;fifth graders&quot; <br/>
or in other school-bound terms.  Perhaps you&#39;re new to unschooling, or just <br/>
dropping by to check it out a bit, but neither teaching before kindergarten <br/>
nor being a fifth grader are unschooling related concepts.<br/>
<br/>
There are sound arguments against testing, even for those who finish a test <br/>
with 99th percentiles in every area.  It helps no one; it harms individuals <br/>
and relationships.<br/>
