<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905219522"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;     I have only recently started using E mail and the Internet and I am <br/>
&gt; &gt; beginning to feel that it takes up far more of my time than I&#39;d like. I am <br/>
&gt; &gt; seriously considering signing off completely. Have any of you felt this way? <br/>
&gt; &gt; If so hoe do you handle it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Sometimes I have a lot of time for e-mail and sometimes I&#39;m really <br/>
 limited so...................<br/>
 I either delete a lot when I&#39;m busy,  or file messages in an &quot;unread&quot; <br/>
 file to read at a later date.  Sorting the messages by subject makes <br/>
 it easy to catch any that I want to read right away.  I think,  like <br/>
 anything else in life,  it&#39;s a constant balancing act.  I figure out <br/>
 what I can handle and go from there.  Some people can handle several <br/>
 busy lists.  For me,  a couple are enough.<br/>
