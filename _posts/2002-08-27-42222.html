 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to take a stab at this one.<br/>
<br/>
The people on this list are different from people who send their kids to<br/>
school because we deal with having them around all day, every day.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I believe it was you, Ned, who once commented that unschooling is<br/>
nothing more than good parenting.  However, based on the above, we<br/>
homeschoolers do a lot more parenting than folks whose children are in<br/>
school all day.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true that people whose children attend schools talk about these things.<br/>
As unschoolers, our children have far more access to &quot;movies, computer<br/>
games, etc.&quot; than schooled or schooled-at-home children.  As a result, we<br/>
discuss them here in order to get feedback from folks in our same situation.<br/>
<br/>
On a side point...while homeschooling and unschooling are certainly not the<br/>
sole domain of women, the majority of folks on this list are ladies.<br/>
Sometimes women get off topic and enjoy a silly giggle about a former<br/>
boyfriend or such.  If the majority of at-home parents handling their<br/>
children&#39;s education were men, the list might get similarly off topic, but<br/>
on different &quot;men&#39;s subjects&quot;.  Humor us, Ned, as we&#39;ve humored you a couple<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned a lot from discussions of what you consider &quot;just parenting&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry they bore you.  But they&#39;re what my life looks like right now, and<br/>
this list has been a wonderful gift to me.<br/>

out of seeing their messages in her in-box every day!  :)</div>
