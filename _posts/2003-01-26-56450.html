&gt; I&#39;d really like some feedback on a situation with my son. Satori, who just<br/>
&gt; turned three last Sunday,  has acquired the lovely habit of hitting me and<br/>
&gt; telling me to &quot;Shut up&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you remember some examples of what led up to this? Because that might be<br/>
what I&#39;d suggest changing -- if he is feeling powerless then finding ways to<br/>
empower him (other than violence) can help him learn other ways to get what<br/>
he wants.<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter (now 5) went through a phase, I&#39;m thinking it was about<br/>
a year ago, maybe a little less, of hitting her older sister. Mikey<br/>
(younger) wasn&#39;t much of a talker and Brit (older) can argue the birds out<br/>
of the trees and always has been able to ;). So, when there was a dispute<br/>
between them, Brit would talk (and talk and talk) and Mikey, increasingly<br/>
powerless, would finally haul off and punch her.<br/>
<br/>
I used Sandra&#39;s trick of telling Mikey that if she wanted to hit Brit, to<br/>
first come to me and see if I had any other ideas, and that and just general<br/>
maturity and learning to speak up for herself finally solved the problem.<br/>
