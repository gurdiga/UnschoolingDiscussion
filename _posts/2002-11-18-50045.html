<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982313931">**Your bio parents were probably both still young at the time of your birth**<br/>
<br/>
**Nope! Bio dad was Korean war vet, lost a leg.<br/>
Bio mom was in her early thirties, **<br/>
<br/>
Thirty is young, relatively. :) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you proved my point. :) You say you&#39;re worried a bit because you <br/>
heard your biomom died of some kind of cancer - that wouldn&#39;t have been in a <br/>
medical history taken at the time of your birth. Perhaps a checkup is a good <br/>
place to start to put a check on the niggling worry, since you&#39;re sure you <br/>
can&#39;t find out anything more.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d be surprised how many adoption records were &quot;destroyed in a fire&quot;. <br/>
