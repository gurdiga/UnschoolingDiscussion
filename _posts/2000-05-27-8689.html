<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have been thoroughly enjoying monitoring this 
site for a few weeks now - you&#39;re a fine bunch of people - and I very much like 
the freedom you exercise here (most sites seem to have their self-appointed 
Consistency Police that just make things boring.)&nbsp; I haven&#39;t contributed 
much because I&#39;m not homeschooling myself - my three girls are grown - but I 
would like to make a comment on recent postings in which various diagnoses of 
child disorders have been mentioned.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I really do recommend to those parents that you get 
hold of A S Neill&#39;s books which are not just about free-schooling, but also 
about child-rearing.&nbsp; When the environment is right, the majority of these 
disorders unravel of their own accord.&nbsp; To label them and address them 
directly is to some degree to reinforce them.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I don&#39;t underestimate the help it can be to finally 
have a&nbsp;label for what is going on, but there is a downside to that 
which&nbsp;should be taken into account.&nbsp; In my attitudinal training 
business, I work with kids from time to time - and get great results at undoing 
these conditions the psychs and medicos would have us believe are genetic, must 
be treated with drugs, etc.&nbsp; In my experience, the only box a child should 
ever be put in is one that can be instantly demolished.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">By that I mean the diagnosis should immediately 
lead to a resolution of the problem, or the diagnosis is not to be trusted, no 
matter how &quot;logical&quot; it may sound or how &quot;close&quot; it may fit.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, the other type of box that can be 
instantly demolished is of the cardboard variety - I thoroughly recommend them 
for children too.</font></div>
