Here&#39;s a brief excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
A conversation with Michael Fogler - by Peter Kowalke<br/>
<br/>
             Unschooling Meets the Workforce<br/>
<br/>
             As a lifelong unschooler, I&#39;ve grown up with the luxury <br/>
of studying what interests me. Supposedly I should be able to make a <br/>
living by following my interests, too. But what if my passion is <br/>
writing well-researched stories about everyday people, something that <br/>
isn&#39;t very lucrative? To answer my question, I visited Michael Fogler <br/>
in his Lexington, Kentucky, home. Michael is a homeschooling father <br/>
and author of the book, Un-jobbing: The Adult Liberation Handbook, <br/>
which asserts that it isn&#39;t necessary to give up an interest in order <br/>
to make a living without a job. His secret, it seems, is just using <br/>
common sense.<br/>
<br/>
Peter Kowalke: Unschooling is to learn without going to school. Is <br/>
un-jobbing to earn without having a job? Could you explain what it <br/>
means to &quot;un-job&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Michael Fogler: In a sense, Yes, if we define job as an activity we <br/>
do for money which we really wouldn&#39;t be doing if it weren&#39;t for the <br/>
money. That is what I see as so wasteful in our society: millions of <br/>
people spending the bulk of their able-bodied lives in activities <br/>
that they wouldn&#39;t be doing if they didn&#39;t need the money attached to <br/>
it. Can we not do only activities which are in alignment with our <br/>
values and sense of purpose, with some of these activities also <br/>
bringing in income? I say yes. So, I see a life of un-jobbing as a <br/>
life in which all of the activities that a person does are activities <br/>
that the person really wants to do, whether they are income-producing <br/>
or not. This person is doing what he/she truly wants to do, period. <br/>
&quot;Work&quot; and &quot;play&quot; become blurred, virtually one and the same. They <br/>
blend together into, simply, Life. John Holt once proclaimed that <br/>
learning is not the product of teaching (something I have come to <br/>
agree with). Similarly, living is not the product of &quot;making a <br/>
living&quot; (i.e. the job) in our culture. So, my thing is to encourage <br/>
(conscious) living in every moment and to change &quot;making a living&quot; <br/>
(which should be more accurately called &quot;making a dying&quot;) into <br/>
&quot;making a life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Peter: The recent advertising campaign for the job site, Monster.com, <br/>
points out that no one grows up wanting a bad job; we all want to <br/>
earn money by doing what we love. But even career guides admit that <br/>
we can&#39;t always do what we love without some sacrifice. Besides <br/>
having a marketable interest, such as computers, how does one &quot;make a <br/>
life&quot; by doing what he or she enjoys?<br/>
<br/>
