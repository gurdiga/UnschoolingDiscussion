<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802526957">“I think my father’s rage at the Trenches took me over, when I was  <br/>
very young, and has never left me. Do children feel their parents’  <br/>
emotions? Yes, we do, and it is a legacy I could have done without.  <br/>
What is the use of it? It is as if that old war is in my own memory,  <br/>
my own consciousness.”<br/>
<br/>
I was reading a review of Doris Lessing&#39;s newest book and the  <br/>
reviewer pulled that quote out. It reminded me of Sandra&#39;s frequent  <br/>
reminder that our kids need us to let go of the baggage we&#39;re  <br/>
carrying from our own pasts. We&#39;re probably all full of legacies we  <br/>
could have done without. No reason to give our kids the same.<br/>

The book is Alfred and Emily<br/>

(That will probably only work for people who are registered with the  <br/>
NY Times)<br/>
<br/>
Even though I&#39;ve never finished any of her books, her name has been  <br/>
in the back of my mind ever since I read a review of a very literary  <br/>
science fiction work she did. Just the idea of it caught my attention  <br/>
though I was never able to finish it ;-)</div>

It&#39;s certainly better to do that before you have kids, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
always happen that way.  Still, though, I think kids can learn a lot<br/>
from watching their parents grow and learn how to be better people!<br/>
<br/>
I wish things for our family had been different earlier than later, but<br/>
it is what it is.  Unschooling really helped make us better people.  I<br/>
can&#39;t even imagine, or rather I can, how different things would be with<br/>
our relationships with our kids if they&#39;d been in school all these<br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
Kids absorb the good and the bad.  Unschooling really focuses on the<br/>
good, and that&#39;s, well, GOOD!</div>
