<div id="ygrps-yiv-305561916">I don&#39;t have a solid answer to this but I thought I would chime in on <br/>
personal experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I was public schooled, I attend all low level classes, I disliked school to <br/>
the point of prob. depression. My last year I took all classes I thought I <br/>
may have an interest in. Psych, Contract Law, Drafting etc... I graduated a <br/>
half a year early with High Honors. All this from a student that was told I <br/>
was LD and stuffed in a resource room for years.. Only because I disliked the <br/>
big classes, I couldn&#39;t think let alone learn any thing from all the antics <br/>
in class.  Did I continue with any of these subjects in adult hood? NO<br/>
I didn&#39;t go to college, I joined the Marines still lost from school and a <br/>
messy childhood of abuse and divorce.<br/>
What&#39;s my point?<br/>
Well, after the Military and dead end jobs, I had my children, married and <br/>
still felt lost.  Because I was never able to lean what interested me I found <br/>
my self not completing tasks. Frustrated with all the control others had over <br/>
me. Work, rules, what was expected being the biggest.<br/>
<br/>
At 28 I quit my job, pulled my son from school and showed him you can do <br/>
whatever you set your mind too.  I asked him ok what do you want to do. He <br/>
said open a business.<br/>
So we did for 2 1/2 years we where on top of the world. We both learned how <br/>
to design a web site, market products, become top sellers in high end <br/>
children&#39;s products and have our name and Logo known in many places. He will <br/>
most likely in his adult life not work for anyone but himself and for his <br/>
family. <br/>
What is a deadline? <br/>
We all have to be places at a certain time and I think for the most part <br/>
schooled or unschooled we all do it to some extent or another.<br/>
Personally school makes one bitter in the hustle and bustle all day long to <br/>
move to cattle (term used by our principal in a conversation I had with him) <br/>
from one room to the next. Why do we need to cover every subject every day? <br/>
Punishment if your late?  In the adult world it just doesn&#39;t work like that <br/>
all day long.<br/>
<br/>
I have a sister with 4 children in public school who all feel stressed, <br/>
harassed at times and admit they cant remember what they did or learned last <br/>
month. Her son has an IQ score that only a few have.  He landed in the Alt <br/>
school because his teacher said he didn&#39;t turn in his papers. None of his <br/>
talents are being used at all. <br/>
Her oldest Daughter loves stage crew and has run it for a couple years now, <br/>
has quit because her teacher changed her grade from an A+ to an F because she <br/>
disagreed with a situation. (This wasn&#39;t a disrespect situation nor did it <br/>
have anything to do with her work performance)<br/>
 <br/>
The third child has a voice and a dream that she has wanted to follow for <br/>
years and has never been able to go after that. If she was at home she would <br/>
prob. have her own record by now. <br/>
My sister has politely disagreed for years as to my choices and said I should <br/>
go get a job. She works for a well known investment company and is successful <br/>
but not happy. She is now opening her own business and plans to leave her <br/>
job.  She calls weekly with issues about her children&#39;s school and is now <br/>
considering pulling them all from school.<br/>
As one medicine is not a cure all for everyone neither is school the only <br/>
choice..<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this group and posted my intro last week but I don&#39;t think <br/>
everyone received it as I didn&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not a homeschooler / unschooler.  Just gathering information at this <br/>
&gt; point.  I have a three-year-old and my second (and last!) child is <br/>
&gt; due in July.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve enjoyed the posts so far and can tell that people care deeply <br/>
&gt; about their kids are are trying to provide the environment that <br/>
&gt; allows their fullest potentials as humans (not just students / cogs) <br/>
&gt; to be realized.  My question is, how do unschooled children learn to <br/>
&gt; work to deadlines?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the workplace, performance is measured partly by honoring <br/>
&gt; commitments in a timely manner.  External pressure (reviews - like <br/>
&gt; grades, and disciplinary action) can be severe, but as a parent it <br/>
&gt; seems like it would be hard to enforce deadlines on unschooled <br/>
&gt; children.  Often the workplace choice is to do the best job possible <br/>
&gt; in the time available while constantly facing other deadlines; <br/>
&gt; prioritizing among alternative ways to achieve the greatest overall <br/>
&gt; output seems to result in workplace success, although there is no <br/>
&gt; final say on the one best approach (except the boss&#39;s maybe).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe my conventional education is clouding my judgement here and <br/>
&gt; employees should work to their own values, standards and interests <br/>
&gt; alone, although this could conflict with the reward system of the <br/>
&gt; employer?  As an outsider, it seems like part of the appeal of <br/>
&gt; homeschooling / unschooling is allowing the children to direct their <br/>
&gt; own learning and to take the time needed to really grasp each <br/>
&gt; subject, but does that create problems in adapting to the workplace <br/>
&gt; where having an adequate result on time often outweighs having a <br/>
&gt; better result later?  How do parents help homeschooled / unschooled <br/>
&gt; children work to deadlines, if indeed it is even a consideration?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
