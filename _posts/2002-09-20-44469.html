<div id="ygrps-yiv-782297530">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m extremely glad to have found this place, it looks like *a lot* of fun.  I&#39;ve been reading tons about unschooling and am convinced this is the way to go.  <br/>
<br/>
First off, I&#39;m Genevieve, mom to 4 greatly curious boys, 5, 3 1/2, and 2X 9months living in the suburbs of Montreal, Quebec, Canada  . I did cave-in and sent Felix to school, mostly because, well, I don&#39;t know LOL! and I totally regret it and will undo that quite soon.  So now, I&#39;m looking in for info about our laws; which I found, but even more, experience from BTDT in Quebec (anyone around here?).  I look like an alien dumped from an alien planet when I talk about homeschooling around me, and even worst when it comes to unschooling.   All I find is related to &quot;school-at-home&quot; which I am *not* going to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Another question I have is feeding 4 curious minds at once... is it possible?  Do lots of you unschool more than 2-3?   <br/>
<br/>
I guess these are more concerns I have before I let go, since I&#39;ll most likely have the hang of being split in four when time needed. =)<br/>

Hello Genevieve, We have seven children and so, I think its possible to unschool with four or more - its just different. Know what I mean? Simply because there is more - more questions, more interests, more bodies!  But there is also the synergy of shared interests in the family - and the fun of always having someone around to play with....I think unschooling looks a bit different for each family anyway, small or large or whatever...Leonie W. <br/>

Welcome to the list, Genevieve! Nice to meet you. I don&#39;t have any <br/>
knowledge of how homeschooling&#39;s done in Canada, but surely someone here <br/>
does :)<br/>
<br/>
Btw: I live in the &quot;lower 48&quot;, in Missouri :)<br/>

There are lots of unschoolers on hs-ca.  There&#39;s also a lower-traffic list<br/>
called (I think) Unschooling_Canada.  (I don&#39;t have use of my regular mail<br/>
reader with addresses, etc. right now)  To subscribe, send a message to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hs-ca-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">hs-ca-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> for hs-ca and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling_Canada-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling_Canada-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>.  You might have to play around<br/>
with the second one (upper/lower case, underline or hyphen).  Or you could<br/>
go to Yahoo Groups and search for it.<br/>

I guess it&#39;s just the scare of the beginning.  I see those &quot;shared interests&quot; already in my two oldest boys.  They even &quot;contaminated&quot; the neighbor with all their fun stuff LOL!  I guess I just see a whirlwind of questions in a few years, and that makes me a bit anxious.  I must say though,  that we already have tons of questions from my oldest two and it&#39;s not that bad :-)  <br/>

I found quite a bit of lists, but haven&#39;t found much real-life people.  I don&#39;t know, I guess everyone&#39;s hiding :-)<br/>

Yes - iI found that we and the the children just kind of grew together, on the relaxed homeschooling then unschooling journey....The work load as far as clutter, clothes, etc is more, of course, with more children - and more of this falls on me as the adult who spends more time at home.....I also need a break every now and then from the constant ( but pleasant) noise - I usually find that an occasional outing by myself or an occasional early  night  for me, in bed with a book, to be a real help with giving me some sapce and peace...Leonie W. <br/>
