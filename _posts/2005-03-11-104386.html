<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628142165">I apologize for being so late in responding. My computer&#39;s been even sicker than it is now (I need to be very careful with it or it&#39;ll freak out on me again! &lt;g&gt;), but I have a BUNCH of e-mails I want to respond to. I&#39;m going pretty far back in time, so again----I&#39;m sorry for dredging up old, old stuff.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-Any other suggested articles for a grandma math teacher worrying that her unschooled kids are going to be okay?  I think something that shows how &quot;playing&quot; can lead to learning stuff she sees as only being learned in school.  She wouldn&#39;t read John Holt but she&#39;d read a short, interesting article.-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how much this kind of attitude pisses me off.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a woman, a teacher, even, who is SOOOO out of touch with reality that it ain&#39;t even funny!<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t read John Holt? <br/>
<br/>
You know, I wouldn&#39;t even try. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s so wrapped up in NOT learning that it&#39;s senseless to even try. Really.<br/>
<br/>
Life is about learning. It&#39;s what we do. John Holt made a point of that. &quot;Birds fly. Fish swim. Humans learn.&quot; It&#39;s what we DO.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s a woman who flat out REFUSES to learn. Flat out won&#39;t learn something new. Won&#39;t learn what her own daughter and grandchildren are up to. Where did she learn THAT???? In school. Where &quot;teaching&quot; is king, but learning is all but ignored.<br/>
<br/>
I have no time for that----and I&#39;d tell her so.<br/>
<br/>
Until she&#39;s willing to get off her butt and make an effort, I&#39;d have nothing to say on the subject. She&#39;s just showing exactly what schools teach----that you don&#39;t have to learn anything---and best if you don&#39;t. Make sure you go through life ignorant.<br/>
<br/>
THAT&#39;S what I&#39;d tell her.<br/>
