<div id="ygrps-yiv-198484077">I&#39;m having a marvelous conversation with someone offlist, and something she said spurred the most amazing Duh/Aha! moment for me.  I wonder if someone here can give me some more feedback on it.<br/>
<br/>
I was saying that the only way Liam seems to engage is when I take him OUT places.  Then I wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
Oh, duh.  I just realized something as I wrote that.  This type of learning<br/>
of his -- kinesthetic -- is part of the reason I pulled him from school.<br/>
They simply couldn&#39;t provide him with that sort of a learning environment,<br/>
and I knew I could offer that better at home.  He&#39;s also a random-abstract<br/>
thinker, which doesn&#39;t lend itself to the linear style used in schools.  My<br/>
duh moment here is that, since he initiated this college prep thing, I&#39;ve<br/>
reverted to the opposite of what he needs.  How did I let that get past me?<br/>
<br/>
So, obviously, I need to return to what works for him, instead of what works for me.  The problem (I think) is that this works fine for almost everything, but how does one learn something like physics, for example, without calculus (both of which are on his want-to-do/put-off-doing list), and how can we do calculus in a kinesthetic way?<br/>
<br/>
All of this hinges, of course, on his desire to pursue it anyway.  I haven&#39;t reverted that far.  I&#39;m just thinking that if I can show him how to approach a subject he&#39;s expressed an interest in, in a way that appeals to the way his mind works, maybe that will take care of a lot of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas or resources to stretch my limited brain?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes this can be as simple as being able to be moving while reading,<br/>
talking about or looking at the information. To take an example from<br/>
personal experience, some actors can only memorize their scripts by walking<br/>
around, while murmuring the lines repeatedly, or by connecting the dialogue<br/>
to specific blocking (staging); others want to be still until they have<br/>
learnt the lines, reading over and over; others can recall everything after<br/>
one or two table read throughs. The kinesthetics are the ones tapping their<br/>
fingers on the tables during lectures.<br/>
<br/>
It never occurred to me that I needed one single moment of calculus when I<br/>
started Higher Physics at University. I guess I &quot;knew&quot; the high school level<br/>
calculus then, having just finished Year 12, but not now. To be sure there<br/>
were some math type formulae in the Astronomy portion, but I remember a lot<br/>
of stuff that really had just ordinary arithmetic - especially in<br/>
Electronics. I do remember the sense of wonder at Physics - it all comes<br/>
down to physics; biology becomes chemical reactions within cells, chemistry<br/>
at the atomic level becomes physics - atoms lining up or not, electrons<br/>
moving back and forth, parcels of energy rotating at unimaginable speeds. <br/>
<br/>
I know Einstein as portrayed in a movie claimed that it was the math that<br/>
was his weakness. Anyone know if that was true?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659723497">If I&#39;m not in a situation where it makes sense to take notes, I have to doodle while listening to someone lecture.  Otherwise, I can&#39;t stay &quot;grounded&quot; to the reality long enough to stay there and not go wandering off in my head.  I also bounce my leg up and down (which used to drive my mother (a very still sort of person) crazy when I lived at home -- she laughingly (and not at all hurtfully) told me that I looked like a junkie in need of a fix). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669597218">I like this book (for me)  <br/>
 <br/>
Calculus Lite (Third Edition)<br/>
by Frank Morgan <br/>
<br/>
Book Description<br/>
Calculus Lite breaks the mold of heavyweight calculus books and presents a straightforward introduction to calculus. The author uses an intuitive approach to explain real world problems and then develops a rigorous mathematical treatment for their solution. Standard preliminary topics like trigonometry and limits are introduced by using them in context. This book can serve as an excellent tutorial for self-study and exam preparation. It is also currently being used as a text for beginning courses at major universities and colleges. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145842020">I found this book yesterday -- Liam says he likes the look of it, and <br/>
started going through it last night.  It&#39;s on physics, but includes <br/>
the necessary math.  (Doesn&#39;t actually look like there&#39;s much <br/>
calculus in there.  Highest it seems to be is trig.)  It&#39;s called <br/>
Physics Demystified, by Stan Gibilisco.<br/>
<br/>
From the back cover:<br/>
<br/>
Now anyone with an interest in the physical sciences can master <br/>
physics -- without formal training or drowning in a sea of <br/>
complicated formulas and equations. In Physics Demystified best-<br/>
selling author Stan Gibilisco offers a fun, effective, and totally <br/>
painless way to learn the fundamentals and general concepts of <br/>
physics. <br/>
<br/>
With Physics Demystified you master the subject one simple step at a <br/>
time â&quot; at your own speed. Unlike most books on physics, general <br/>
principles are presented first â&quot; and the details follow. In order to <br/>
make the learning process as clear and simple as possible, heavy-duty <br/>
math, formulas, and equations are kept to a minimum. This unique self-<br/>
teaching guide offers questions at the end of each chapter and <br/>
section to pinpoint weaknesses, and a 100-question final exam to <br/>
reinforce the entire book.  &lt;Me: I don&#39;t know about THIS. :-)&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Simple enough for a beginner but challenging enough for an advanced <br/>
student, Physics Demystified is your direct route to learning or <br/>
brushing up on physics.<br/>
<br/>
HEREâS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO:<br/>
* Understand the math used in physical science<br/>
* Solve mass/force/acceleration problems<br/>
* Create mathematical models of physical phenomena<br/>
* Perform distance vs. time calculations<br/>
* Determine potential and kinetic energy<br/>
* Calculate the wavelength of sounds and radio signals<br/>
* Understand visible light interference patterns<br/>
* Calculate the energy and frequency of a moving particle<br/>
* Understand atomic structure<br/>
* Learn about electric current, voltage, resistance, power, and <br/>
energy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474324352">Einstein, though he had a decent grasp of mathematics campared to <br/>
many of today&#39;s college students, needed the help of a mathematician <br/>
to turn his general theory of relativity into a mathematical formula, <br/>
the Einstein equation (*not* E=mc2 but another one).  There is a well <br/>
known mathematician whose name escapes me now who never learned <br/>
Calculus.  <br/>
<br/>
I read a lot of math and physics without even knowing how to read the <br/>
formulae presented let alone what it all means.  It&#39;s even addressed <br/>
in the book It Must Be Beautiful: Great equations of Modern Science.  <br/>
Roger Penrose in his essay The Rediscovery of Gravity wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Before we begin, a few words about reading mathematical equations <br/>
may be helpful...I recommend a procedure I normally adopt myself<br/>
...That is more or less, to ignore that line and skip over to the <br/>
next line of actual text...After a while armed with new confidence, <br/>
one may return to that neglected equation and try to pick out the <br/>
salient features...If not then don&#39;t be afraid to leave the equation <br/>
behind altogether.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The act of reading the text about unknown math and physics is a <br/>
lesson in and of itself.  We don&#39;t need to be equipped with a perfect <br/>
sequential knowledge to learn and grow.  Math and physics are <br/>
fascinating and jumping in over our heads can be a whole lot of fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712938054">A few good books on math and physics that are understandable to <br/>
anyone:<br/>
<br/>
The Theories of Relativity by that cute little physicist himself, <br/>
Albert Einstein.  I picked mine up new at Walden Books for about $6.  <br/>
His ability to explain such complex ideas is itself genius.  I would <br/>
recommend Einstein over Hawkings any day.<br/>
<br/>
E=mc2: The biography of the world&#39;s most famous formula.  Explains <br/>
exactly what the formula means and why it revolutionized physics and <br/>
allow us to develope the Bomb.<br/>
<br/>
My Mind is Open: The Mathematical Journeys of Paul Erdos by Bruce <br/>
Schechter.  Erdos was the most prolific mathematician of the 20th <br/>
century.  Gives a rare look into the world of mathematics and is a <br/>
great introduction to real mathematics, not just arithmatic.<br/>
<br/>
The Realm of ALgebra by Isaac &quot;Potty Mouth&quot; Asimov.  The first math <br/>
book I read that conveyed the excitment and beauty of mathematics.  <br/>
The name &quot;Potty Mouth&quot; was given to him after we read his book on <br/>
humor.  He is refered to as nothing else in our home. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anything by Richard Feynman especially Six Easy Pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond Numeracy; Ruminations of A Numbers Man by John Allen Paulos <br/>
A great book that belongs in the home library!   A collection of math <br/>
essays that are entertaining and enlightening.  Each short essay can <br/>
be read on its own in a matter of minutes. <br/>
<br/>
There are more books listed in the HUG book store <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/mhfurgason/hug/hsbooks.html">http://www.geocities.com/mhfurgason/hug/hsbooks.html</a> and with my <br/>

listen to other mathematicians present their work, they usually do NOT <br/>
understand a lot of what the other guy is presenting at the time. They <br/>
get the drift of it - they listen for ideas. If they want to understand <br/>
the details, they read the person&#39;s published papers and go over and <br/>
over it.<br/>
<br/>
People who seem &quot;good at math&quot; are often simply not expecting to &quot;get&quot; <br/>
everything, while those who are thinking they&#39;re not &quot;good&quot; at it are <br/>
thinking that because they&#39;re aware of a lot going over their heads.<br/>

========<br/>
<br/>
I think reading music notation is that way too.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are good enough at at their instrument and sight reading that <br/>
they can just pick up and play something pretty complicated from the notation.  <br/>
But most have to work through it, figure out what is meant (especially if it&#39;s <br/>
notation of a traditionally-non-written form, where you can&#39;t write it down <br/>
exactly as it&#39;s intended to be played -- like rock or bluegrass), and go through <br/>
it several times, and then keep using the music.  So it&#39;s more like reading a <br/>
poem aloud in a foreign language for most people, maybe.  You need to work <br/>
through each phrase, find out what it means, double-check your accent, learn to <br/>
do it without tongue-stumbling, learn to do it so that you sound like a <br/>
native, and a native who understands it and is reading well, too.<br/>
<br/>
But I think when beginners to reading music see the music, they balk and <br/>
freeze up, thinking &quot;reading&quot; is coming to a point where they just see it and it <br/>
comes out of their hands or mouth.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s even much harder, reading music vocally.   Most people will play <br/>
it out on a piano (or have someone else do that) the first many times.  They&#39;re <br/>
still reading along, but there are intervals (jumps from note to note) that <br/>
are just difficult to guess.  Maybe in that case it&#39;s like a dancer reading <br/>
someone else&#39;s choreographic notations.  They&#39;re not going to hold the book in <br/>
hand and dance the whole thing  as intened.  They&#39;re going to study little <br/>
sections at a time and eventually put it all together.<br/>
<br/>
So some people say &quot;I can&#39;t read music&quot; because in their imaginations they <br/>
have overshot the mark most people who feel themelves to be competent music <br/>
readers have settled  on.<br/>
<br/>
And there are people who can write a tune down as they hear it (but will ask <br/>
for pauses or second hearings, maybe), but they&#39;re rare and have a <br/>
particularly concentrated/freakish talent.   Y&#39;know how people will videotape a movie in <br/>
a theatre nowadays (in Asian countries, the stereotype goes &lt;g&gt;) and then make <br/>
copies?   There are stories of people having gone to Gilbert and Sullivan <br/>
operettas in the1890s, writing music down as they sat, and publishing it the next <br/>
day or so.  I&#39;m guessing maybe hey had friends with them to also swipe lyrics <br/>
and help them remember hazy parts.  Maybe they went back twice to <br/>
double-check their notes. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a dying art, in the face of modern technology.  Even working from a <br/>
recording like a dictophone transcriptionist is too much work when one can play <br/>
the tune on a MIDI keyboard and have a computer program throw a basic guess at <br/>
putting it into notation.  Then with a mouse and the pulldown menus of other <br/>
people&#39;s programs, it can be tweaked and polished, other voices added, and <br/>
then the computer can read it all back in the instruments&#39;  voices you&#39;ve <br/>
specified, or you can print it out for live musicians with instruments made out of <br/>
wood or metal or something. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883734428">I just took a new job where I have to know the minimum requirements (of  <br/>
which there are many) for hiring of truck drivers.  It was presented to me  in 3 <br/>
bulleted lists, and each was a series of if/then statements.  They  even had me <br/>
highlight the &quot;important&quot; ones, without even or ever explaining  *why* they <br/>
were important, but I had to know them to pass the first test, and if  I didn&#39;t <br/>
pass it I wouldn&#39;t get to keep the job.<br/>
 <br/>
So, I studied and I wrote things down and tried to rearrange the  information <br/>
into some coherent, categorical format.  It struck me that it  really was a <br/>
series of if/thens, which could be displayed in the form of a  flow-chart.  I <br/>
spent the next 30 minutes at my desk typing up the flow  chart, checking it <br/>
against the list to make sure I had the proper consequences  going to the right <br/>
places, and proper conditions, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
Then I asked my boss if I could print it out.  She saw me get it off  the <br/>
printer and a few minutes later she came to my desk and asked what it  was.  I <br/>
said it was a flow chart of the hiring minimums and she looked it  over a for a <br/>
few seconds and said, &quot;That&#39;s so CONFUSING!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
But, I used it all day when I was doing the actual work to check myself,  and <br/>
I didn&#39;t have to look back through a bunch of paragraphs as bullet lists and  <br/>
keep the if/thens in my head while I tested the motor vehicle records against <br/>
 the minimums.  <br/>
 <br/>
I just looked at her and said, &quot;you&#39;re going to like this and want this  when <br/>
I&#39;m through with it.&quot;  And in fact, the new employee next to me wanted  a <br/>
copy, too.<br/>
