<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; They provide knives and forks for that purpose at Mcdonalds.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh yeah!  I&#39;ve heard that several European places do that with hamburgers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having eaten at McDonalds in numerous German cities, I have concluded that<br/>
the fairly consistant European no-food-touching rule does not apply to food<br/>
at McDonalds.  In fact, I think you&#39;re supposed to get good and messy with<br/>
it, too, because it&#39;s like pulling teeth to get them to give you more than 2<br/>
napkins, no matter how many burgers you buy!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the little kiosks that sell food at the bigger train<br/>
stations, at town fests, etc. always provide at least a little fork-like<br/>
thing (about 3 inches long) with french fries, and a proper plastic knife<br/>
and fork for a crepe.<br/>
<br/>
The Germans think I&#39;m wierd for eating donuts, french fries, etc. with my<br/>
fingers, even if I try to eat daintily.  (Actually, I think the Germans<br/>
think I&#39;m wierd in general.)<br/>
