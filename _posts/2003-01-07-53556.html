<br/>
&lt;&lt;song lyrics inappropriate for young children&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How we handle it is that &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t introduce them into the mix.  Just like I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t hand a toddler a sharp knife to use, I wouldn&#39;t introduce anything<br/>
to my kids that I didn&#39;t feel good about.  So when the little kids are<br/>
around, I make sure that I am listening to music, reading books, watching<br/>
movies that I feel good about exposing my kids to.  Now as the older kids<br/>
have gotten older, they are more &quot;out in the world&quot; and know about artists,<br/>
movies, etc. that wouldn&#39;t be my first choice for them.  I do tell the kids<br/>
how I feel about it, what my concerns are.  Sometimes the kids agree,<br/>
sometimes they don&#39;t.  If the kids still want to watch or listen to<br/>
something that I have my doubts about, I watch it with them to make sure<br/>
they are handling it ok.  Then I quit worrying and try to remember that I<br/>
have very different tastes from my parents even today as an adult and that<br/>
is certainly ok.  And the kids have NEVER consistently watched or listened<br/>
to anything that seemed to have a negative effect on them.<br/>
