<div id="ygrps-yiv-841733177">Hey Wende,<br/>
<br/>
I am sure my husband and possibly one or more of my sons would be out there<br/>
in the cold huddled around the radio, and I&#39;d be hearing about my poor <br/>
choice of<br/>
Thanksgiving venue all the way home. Sports fans are like that. And<br/>
football is as big a part of Thanksgiving as turkey for them, if not bigger, <br/>
and<br/>
what is so wrong with that? Isn&#39;t the point to have a nice time?<br/>
<br/>
I think inviting people over for Thanksgiving and not even making football<br/>
available in some room in the back is asking for trouble.  If you don&#39;t have <br/>
it,<br/>
it&#39;s only fair to let people know ahead of time. If I did that, I am sure it<br/>
would trim my guest list considerably.  Football on Thanksgiving happens<br/>
to be an American tradition!<br/>

   I have had the same thing happen here. While we do have three televisions<br/>
   and one VCR, none of them are hooked up to antennas or cable. The only<br/>
   station that comes in clearly is PBS, and we mostly just watch videos.<br/>
   When we have had groups of people over for Thanksgiving or New Years,<br/>
   both adults and children have gotten upset with me that they could not<br/>
   watch Football games. And I mean, really upset, to the point of<br/>
   dysfunctional. They would pace around like lost puppies. I&#39;d find them<br/>
   sitting in their cars in subzero weather tuned in to the radio. Some<br/>
   people, (my Dad) actually went home. I would hate for something to have<br/>
   that much of a hold on me. My children can watch TV or tapes at their<br/>
   whim, and when they go to visit other people, they are there to spend<br/>
   that time with those people. DD5 often comes home from Grandma&#39;s<br/>
   disappointed, because the first thing my Mom does is turn on cartoons for<br/>
   her. DD would much rather spend the time doing something *with* Grandma.<br/>
   She does think it is pretty cool that cartoons are on all night there<br/>
   though.<br/>

I absolutely hate the cold but if it were me, I&#39;d be out there too. Don&#39;t <br/>
see it as having a major hold on me. I just really enjoy football. I have <br/>
all my life. Grew up on some football greats and still love it to this day. <br/>
My husband and I love a good game. Heck we love a bad game. I wish my kids <br/>
loved it too. Just for something to share and enjoy together. There are <br/>
plenty of other things we share, but one more wouldn&#39;t be bad. Football for <br/>
us is fun and we enjoy it. It&#39;s not like we watch it every day all year <br/>
long. It&#39;s seasonal so that&#39;s when we watch. Kind of like my kids and the <br/>
Wizard of Oz. We have the movie here, but every time it&#39;s on TV, the kids <br/>
just HAVE to watch it!!!! I don&#39;t see that as a bad thing.<br/>
