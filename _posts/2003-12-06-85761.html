<h4>Lee-Ann and Robert Storer</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098249363">It&#39;s now two full days after the piercing.  Emma&#39;s nose looks very clean around the sleeper.  She&#39;s taking care of it well.  The only thing negative she has to say about it is that she&#39;s desperate to give her nose a really good blow but she has to make do with woossy little mini blows &lt;g&gt;.  She&#39;s told her &#39;nanny and grandad&#39; (robert&#39;s family) and all nanny had to say was &#39;why&#39;.  A much milder reaction than I expected.  My mum is getting a bit dithery in her old age and will have forgotten all about it by the time we get to see her again so we&#39;ll have to go through the explanations all over LOL<br/>
<br/>
I went through the reasoning with Emma on why a parent may not want their child to have a nose piercing.  Infection - unlikely under sanitary conditions with proper after care.  Appearance - but that&#39;s why they want it done!  If they decide that it&#39;s really not their thing it&#39;s a simple matter of removing the stud or sleeper and letting it grow over.  Cost - wasn&#39;t really an issue, if we couldn&#39;t afford it then she could have saved her pocket money.  I can&#39;t think of any other reasons and Emma couldn&#39;t think of any others either.  Peer Group reaction wasn&#39;t an issue.<br/>
<br/>
In the &#39;old days&#39; the only reason for not getting it done would have been because I, the parent, said NO.  I like these &#39;new days&#39; much better &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
