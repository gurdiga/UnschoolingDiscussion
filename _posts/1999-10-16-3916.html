<div id="ygrps-yiv-726171962">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My husband reads that site (intellectualcapital.com) regularly and likes<br/>
what he sees, usually (even though he says it can sometimes tend toward a<br/>
kind of libertarianism we don&#39;t agree with).  He was especially happy to see<br/>
a well-reasoned discussion in favor of family beds put out for public<br/>
consideration.  I hadn&#39;t read it yet, but it&#39;s cool that there&#39;s a<br/>
connection to Natural Child project.  I love that internet kind of<br/>
synergy--e.g. some prominent AP writers happen to be on an SAH-AP list I&#39;m<br/>
on (called sah-ap, actually) which is a totally informal community but still<br/>
very serious and can get activist and public when it needs to.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm..with all the great discussion on the lifelearning thread (totally<br/>
exciting thought provoking posts--THANK YOU) I wonder if this list has some<br/>
potential for activism or at least writing for a larger audience? ...<br/>
<br/>
So glad I found this list,<br/>
Carolyn<br/>
