&lt;&lt; Recently Sandra posted an essay/article about the benefits that Holly <br/>
<br/>
had from being a late reader. It was about her theater experiences? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to have that again, if possible.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I should put that on the reading page, if anyone finds it.<br/>
<br/>
(Holly if you&#39;re sent it on the side, could you copy me, please?)<br/>

<br/>
LOL whew! but narrowing it down with the words &quot;holly, reading, <br/>
theater&quot; added gets me NOTHING.<br/>
<br/>
I started posting here in mid-April, near as I can remember. So, <br/>
narrowing it down to the Sandra Dodd posts from April ??? up to about <br/>
three weeks ago? *whimper*<br/>
<br/>
maybe i&#39;ll find it. Abbie needs the computer now to work on her book.<br/>
<br/>

similar?  I remember reading about her having to actually learn her part not <br/>
just read it off a piece of paper like the other kids did.<br/>
