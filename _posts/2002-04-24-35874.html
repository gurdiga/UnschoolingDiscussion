<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063891576">Make sure never to read scientific studies about how the plants kingdom (so<br/>
to speak) is full of  sentient and feeling creatures. Such researches has<br/>
been going on for more than 20 years .  But they are often shoo away, just<br/>
like animal emotions are often treated as inferior instinctual reactions by<br/>
the scientific society.<br/>
Considering how animals (including humans) are mistreated in the western<br/>
society ( don&#39;t know enough about others) it is probably commendable to eat<br/>
less meat or only eat meat you know the farmer has not mistreated.<br/>
But to be a vegetarian because of  the assumption that animals are superior<br/>
to vegetables may be perpetuating another myth of  superiority.<br/>
I know my words will seemed strange to a lot of people. After all, we hear<br/>
animals but plants don&#39;t seem to make noise. I&#39;ve been there.  As a<br/>
biologist, I didn&#39;t questioned our representation of nature in some pyramid<br/>
form, with man on top, until a few years back. When does a natural creature<br/>
become sentient? Are our answers convenient to our culture or reflecting<br/>
reality? Our generation may not have the courage to answer these questions<br/>
publicly ( scientific witch hunt do exist in our society),  but I believe<br/>
our children may.<br/>
Sorry,  about the boat rocking. Was running out of thongue to bite.<br/>

&gt; I agree that if what you are eating bothers you, you shouldn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For all of my meat-eating years, however, I preferred not to use or hear<br/>
&gt; distasteful words about my meal.  I think a whole lot of people eat meat<br/>
&gt; and don&#39;t want to think that it was once a living, breathing animal.<br/>
&gt; One of the vegetarian books I&#39;ve read encouraged a change of language to<br/>
&gt; call &quot;meat&quot; by it&#39;s animal name, chickens, fishes, cows, pigs, etc.<br/>
&gt; because the author felt that language was one of the ways we have made<br/>
&gt; carcass eating more appealing.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Well, yes as a matter of fact.  And I also think that if it bothers<br/>
&gt; &gt; you to think of it as a hunk of dead cow (or if you raise them<br/>
&gt; &gt; yourself a peice of Bessie), you SHOULD be a vegetarian.  If the truth<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; of what you are eating bothers you, then you shouldn&#39;t eat it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you saying that &quot;a &#39;roast,&#39; by any other name, is still . . . .<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; BLECH!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeepers, this list is going to inspire the vegetarian in me to take<br/>
&gt; &gt; over the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; omnivore in me.  Between bloody eggs and hunks of cow carcass, who<br/>
&gt; &gt; could<br/>
