<div id="ygrps-yiv-326614690">Did you look up aftermath?<br/>
<br/>
I had never wondered!!   Betsy, tell your son I&#39;ve played with words since I <br/>
was little, and I had never thought of that one.<br/>
<br/>
I looked.  It&#39;s an Old English word I can&#39;t type with this keyboard (and <br/>
don&#39;t know how to indicate well) but it&#39;s moeth, meaning mowing/harvest.  <br/>
After the mowing.<br/>
<br/>
Aftermath kind of means, then &quot;what will there be after all this other stuff <br/>
is cut down?&quot; or considering that crops might go really well or really badly <br/>
or get eaten up by bugs late in the season, maybe it&#39;s about not knowing the <br/>
outcome until after the harvest.<br/>
<br/>
COOL!<br/>
<br/>
Tell him to look at &quot;trailer.&quot;  I liked discovering that one in my head when <br/>
I was little.  If he already thought about trailer before, maybe he&#39;d be <br/>
interested in wise, wisdom, wit, witness.<br/>
<br/>
Holly liked the tw- words from Anglo Saxon/Old English.  The reason &quot;two&quot; the <br/>
number is spelled with the w is because it&#39;s of the group of twice, twins, <br/>
twine, twilight...<br/>
