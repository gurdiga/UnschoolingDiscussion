I know the feeling. Tara worked yesterday from 2:00 until 10:30 which means <br/>
she was gone from 1:30 until 11:00. It was real strange being without for so <br/>
long on a Saturday. So far, my young ones have no interest in staying away <br/>
for the night. They also don&#39;t want anyone here staying over either. A few <br/>
kids have asked and my kids aren&#39;t thrilled with it. I guess they like their <br/>
night times to themselves. If they are anything like Tara, their over nights <br/>
won&#39;t be for long.<br/>

to do that....and she&#39;s a demanding little thing, would make my life <br/>
miserable if I went against her wishes. lol.  She actually made Jared <br/>
play with her tonight.  She was being a dog,  you all can bash me but <br/>
it&#39;s annoying as hell.....and he was very patient.  He said, &quot;Be <br/>
yourself and quit licking me,&quot; really nice, and she did.  What a kid. <br/>
 I&#39;m usually pretty patient but sometimes that dog act, and me holding <br/>
leashes, and filling up bowls of water and telling &quot;Rover&quot; to stop <br/>
barking gets to me sometimes.  He inspired me<br/>

<br/>
Last night I called up the stairs, where several kids were, because I had a <br/>
bag of trash I&#39;d collected downstairs in the back.<br/>
<br/>
Holly came halfway down to see what I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I said:  &quot;Are there any boys who live here who still have their shoes on?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She looked and said, &quot;Joey does!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Keith, who was downstairs on the computer laughed a loud HOOT of a laugh, and <br/>
I came and shushed him.  He just thought it was wonderful that Joey, our <br/>
ghostly squatter, had been acknowledged so casually as &quot;a boy who lives here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it turned out Kirby still had his boots on and he took the trash out to <br/>
the dumpster for me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
