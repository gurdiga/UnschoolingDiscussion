think that&#39;s unschooling in practice.     If a child were to decide (which I <br/>
doubt <br/>
any child ever has, but if) that  what they think will help is a strict diet <br/>
of Abeka with punishment for  infractions, disobedience or bad grades on test <br/>
days, I don&#39;t think a  practitioner of unschooling could really go  <br/>
there.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I have a question for those that have taken children out of school.   If a <br/>
teen comes out of school to unschool and feels that they aren&#39;t learning  <br/>
anything, aren&#39;t doing anything and, if the child wants to start taking  classes in <br/>
the community, art classes, science classes, they are fun classes but  <br/>
organized in a very school type way, how would you deal with this?  <br/>
 <br/>
I have seen this many times with older kids, especially, coming out of  <br/>
school.  I don&#39;t have that problem and think to myself, maybe they want the  class <br/>
because that is where they feel comfortable after so many years of  schooling. <br/>
 Maybe that is where the child feels learning  happens.  Then I hear the <br/>
parents saying that their child likes that type  of environment and they have <br/>
chosen to take the classes, the child was not  forced.  <br/>
 <br/>
Should the parent interfere and try to meet the needs of the child in  other <br/>
ways, should they let the child experience these classes?  For those  of you <br/>
that have taken children out of school what has been the most helpful  with <br/>
deschooling and the child?  It is such a different ballgame with  children coming <br/>
out of school and like my boys who have never had that  experience in their <br/>
lives.  Or maybe it just seems like a different  ballgame, all I know is what <br/>
we do I don&#39;t have that other  perspective.<br/>
 <br/>
I just wonder if taking the child to the classes would hinder the  <br/>
deschooling process, would hinder them seeing that learning is everywhere.   And it is <br/>
just a substitute for school.  But then as an unschooler I say  well if that <br/>
child wants to go to the classes the mother is being supportive of  her child&#39;s <br/>
choice.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just a question/thought.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I would encourage it, pay for it, and drive them over there.<br/>

<br/>
Going to classes without coercion or compulsion is a whole different world, <br/>
and they&#39;re old enough to make those decisions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just wonder if taking the child to the classes would hinder the  <br/>

<br/>
I think some kids are too old to deschool in time for it to do them any real <br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
A teen who&#39;s been in school already knows how to read and write (probably) <br/>
and from that point their unschooling isn&#39;t going to be as much of a departure <br/>
from school-life as those who start younger or who never went to school.<br/>

Maybe.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron could read and write, but *didn&#39;t* for several years after leaving  <br/>
school. He refused to take anything that remotely resembled a class.<br/>
 <br/>
He still has a few school tendencies----more when he&#39;s with his  schooled <br/>
friends. But he&#39;s nothing like them when he&#39;s out in &#39;the real  world&#39;.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s happily taken several classes lately and is very discriminating. He  <br/>
knows what&#39;s valuable to him.<br/>
 <br/>
He came out of school at 12. Maybe that&#39;s the magic number?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851311532">Erica came out of school at 11 not knowing how to read.  She spent a <br/>
month in 6th grade but no one knew she couldn&#39;t read because she <br/>
could sound out the words.  It turned out, when you put the words <br/>
into a sentence she had no clue what the sentence meant.  She <br/>
deschooled almost immediately, I think because she never really fit <br/>
into the school mold anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Sean, on the other hand, is just beginning to deschool after 3 years <br/>
of being home.  He was 12 and supposed to be starting 7th grade when <br/>
he came out.  He&#39;s been back twice and he&#39;s left again twice because <br/>
he didn&#39;t like the way he was treated by the teachers but he likes <br/>
taking classes with a teacher and other students.  I always did <br/>
too.  In a class you have others to talk to about what you are <br/>
learning and a teacher to help you when you just don&#39;t get it.  <br/>
<br/>
As for deschooling, I don&#39;t think Sean&#39;ll ever completely deschool <br/>
in the way that kids who&#39;ve never been to school are or in the way <br/>
that Erica has, but he still has gotten a lot of benefits from being <br/>
home that have changed his life for the better.  He knows he doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to stay where he isn&#39;t being treated well.  He knows he can <br/>
choose what he wants to do and that he doesn&#39;t have to finish stuff <br/>
just because he started it.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry so much about the deschooling.  It&#39;ll come in it&#39;s <br/>
own time and it&#39;s own way.<br/>

* I&#39;m an unschooler who just got out of highschool at 16, and I&#39;ve chosen to <br/>
take classes at the community collage, this helps me a lot. I feel like I&#39;m <br/>
still progressing in life and not getting antsy, and helping meet new and more <br/>
intelligent people who I am also learning from. I would suggest it as long as <br/>
the course load was small enough for your child to still enjoy life. I don&#39;t <br/>
think it will affect them realizing that you learn every single moment of life. <br/>
I have been doing unschooling for about a month and a half now, and all the <br/>
stuff that I have experienced just out of the class room makes me feel as if I <br/>
know a lot more about life, and that I&#39;ll be much more prepared to get out on <br/>
my own when the time comes. <br/>
