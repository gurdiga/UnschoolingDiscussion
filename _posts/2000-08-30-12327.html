Sure. It was one of the first homeschooling books I read, fortunately. It <br/>
helped me to give my daughter a greater degree of freedom when we started <br/>
homeschooling. I&#39;m still not where I want to be on this, but the book was <br/>
quite helpful in getting this far.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949531538">I won this book last year in a raffle at a home-ed festival!  It&#39;s great, <br/>
I&#39;m really glad I have it.  Now if I can only win the Teenage <br/>
