<div id="ygrps-yiv-546275518">Today the pro life ladies are marching in front of our county courthouse.<br/>
 In this conservative little town they&#39;re kind of preaching to the choir,<br/>
but I suppose it makes them feel good.<br/>
To totally change the subject, I have a continuing dialog, e-mail, with<br/>
my brother about spanking.  He&#39;s expressing his idea that his<br/>
grandchildren need more discipline.  His words.  By discipline he means<br/>
they should get a swat or a full blown spanking when they do something he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like.  <br/>
I&#39;m feeling a little ill over his latest correspondence and wondering if<br/>
I can ever reach him or if I should continue to try.  I almost posted his<br/>
e-mail here to let you all read it, then decided I didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
responsible for all the disgust it would cause.  <br/>
Have any of you ever seen someone like this have a change of heart?  Is<br/>
it worth the energy?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My partner works for a local Girl Scout council, and their old office was on <br/>
the first floor of a building. They had a relatively large sign. On the third <br/>
floor of the building was a small clinic where abortions were performed <br/>
occasionally, with a very tiny, non-descript sign.  So sometimes groups of <br/>
protestors would gather for a few hours, looking like they were protesting <br/>
the Girl Scouts doing abortions.  (In fact, I do agree that Girl Scouts <br/>
should not be performing abortions, although it WOULD make for an interesting <br/>
badge.)<br/>

his children (the parents) or does he act it out?<br/>
