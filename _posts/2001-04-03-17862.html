&lt;&lt; Oh, I don&#39;t know how you could move from a farm home to a condo!  And<br/>
 believe it or not, I love the chores.  They get me out of the house into the<br/>
 fresh air bright and early in the morning.  (OK, OK, when it is 30 below and<br/>
 the wind is blowing 50 miles an hour, I whine all the way to the barn)  But<br/>
 overall, the plusses outway the minuses.<br/>

<br/>
       If it weren&#39;t a caretaking position I would be staying believe me. <br/>
But, if I cannot have my own working farm I don&#39;t want one. I speak from 25 <br/>
years of experience. I have run my own small place and worked for many barns, <br/>
small and large. Now if it isn&#39;t mine to run i don&#39;t even want a yard. :o)<br/>
<br/>
    NICKI~ ..........my mother feels the same way and she is still running <br/>
her own barn. If we can&#39;t have it all we don&#39;t want a piece of it.</div>

this list, I thought I was all alone here with my non<br/>
sleepingness and trying to do it quietly so as not<br/>
wake anyone else up. What if we all say magic words<br/>
for each other and YANK the toothpicks out of each<br/>
others eyes really quick and see what happens.<br/>
cybersleep. there ought to be such a thing. You could<br/>
plug in, charge up, rest up, and not have to actually<br/>
PUT yourself to sleep as though you were a child.<br/>
I&#39;m going to invent it. Who&#39;s with me?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614439947">Hi everyone!  I&#39;m a little behind on the posts, but I just wanted to mention <br/>
that with the homeopathics, they are quite safe no matter how much you give <br/>
to them.  If you read up in any of the homeopathic handbooks, it will tell <br/>
you that after a certain dosage- say 4 every ten minutes in accute cases, <br/>
nothing more will happen.  They could take 40 of them and you will get the <br/>
same results as 4 (4 of homeopathic anything in most cases is the full <br/>
strength it can go to).  To prove this point, my dd has taken whole bottles <br/>
of homeopathic remedies (quite by accident!- but they taste yummy!) and been <br/>
just fine. You&#39;re just out the money if they get into them!  I never worry <br/>
with the homeopathics.  This is mainly what I use for dd, and for myself. I <br/>
find them to be very effective. Hope this helps.<br/>
