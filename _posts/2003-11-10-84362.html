<div id="ygrps-yiv-713433856">People are more important than a sparkling house.<br/>
<br/>
It took me quite a while to come to this conclusion, and when I finally did, <br/>
it took my husband even longer.  Why are we raised that our houses should be <br/>
sparkling clean at the expense of our children?  I missed so much time with my <br/>
little ones because of the pressure to have a clean home, and I have a friend <br/>
right now that if her husband comes home and the house isn&#39;t clean, he starts <br/>
yelling and throwing things, upsetting everyone.  I think it is something we <br/>
allow society to impose on us as &quot;women&quot; , and once we are free of it, our <br/>
husbands are so conditioned to believe it as one of our wifely duties that it <br/>
continues to become a struggle until they are liberated.  My son was born with a <br/>
kidney problem and had to have surgery straight after early induced labor.  It <br/>
took a lot of care in the early years of his life, just to keep him alive.  <br/>
I&#39;ll never forget my husband coming home from work one day and telling me he <br/>
just couldn&#39;t love me if he had to live in a dirty house.  Mind you, we&#39;re just <br/>
talking messy, not pigsty.  No health risks, just piled laundry-dinner not <br/>
cooked, you know that kind of stuff you go through with a new baby.  Now please <br/>
don&#39;t start jumping on my husband.  He has come a long way since then or we <br/>
would not be together!  My point is, I see that happening to so many young <br/>
mothers-suffering the pressures of having their houses clean, especially by their <br/>
husbands and mothers and mothers-in-law.  I will encourage and help in anyway to <br/>
see that my children grow up and enjoy their children and not worry about <br/>
those insignificant things.  I must say, I now do flylady, and have much better <br/>
control over the house, but even when things get busy and the stuff doesn&#39;t get <br/>
done, I just don&#39;t care.  Don&#39;t even think about it.  I&#39;ve watched my older <br/>
two grow up and I can&#39;t hardly remember their lives because I was so &quot;busy&quot;.  <br/>
I&#39;m not making the same mistake with the last one.  He has my undivided <br/>
attention 90% of the time, and I enjoy every single minute of it.  My mother always <br/>
said &quot;Things are not as important as people.&quot;  The house is a thing!  Thanks for <br/>
saying this, Pam!<br/>
