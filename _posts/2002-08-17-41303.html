<div id="ygrps-yiv-785024870">Thanks for all your insight regarding my children who do not have <br/>
much contact with other children....  The funny thing is, my <br/>
children (and I) are perfectly happy this way, playing with cousins <br/>
once or twice a month, and that&#39;s it....   However, *everyone* keeps <br/>
telling me, and I have even seen it here on this list, that I should <br/>
make sure my children have plently of contact with other kids.  So, <br/>
of course, I start to wonder if I am harming my children in some <br/>
way!  They have each other and thier pen-pals and e-mail pals and <br/>
they read and play for hours on end with each other, wander through <br/>
the fields, play with animals, etc.   <br/>
I, personally, don&#39;t see close friends or even family even once a <br/>
week but have pen-pals and e-mail friends and love getting together <br/>
with my sisters and mom once or twice a month.  In general, we are <br/>
homebodies, and happiest at home.<br/>

<br/>
I am a 4 year homeschooling Mom, we recently relocated<br/>
from Indiana to California, and during the last three<br/>
years the only people we see are occasionaly cousins<br/>
and its just been recently some friends we made<br/>
through a homeschooling group.  I have to say that the<br/>
time when it was just us was a very happy time.  I<br/>
think  we really bonded as a family.  As far as<br/>
harming your children in any way, BALONEY to that. <br/>
Actually I think it makes kids stronger in themselves<br/>
when they are alone or just with siblings.  Think<br/>
about all of those children who traveled westward<br/>
during the pioneer years they seem to make it okay. <br/>
Listen to your gut and your kids.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952964788">How old are your kids? Probably it does not matter. I live here in <br/>
NYC and isolation would be considered child abuse. I mean, there are <br/>
people EVERYWHERE. My kids, though, are natural born social <br/>
butterflies.  All our neighbors, young and old, know us because they <br/>
know our kids. Even when they are sick as dogs they will find the <br/>
energy to scream --PLAYGROUND! And these kids are little (5, 2.5). <br/>
Sometimes my husband and I just look at them like their aliens from <br/>
Mars. Anyhow, we have to have a balance. There are days when all I <br/>
want to do is hangout and all the kids want is to go go go. Then we <br/>
go and in just a three block radius there are hundreds of little <br/>
happenings going on in our slice of the East Village. So &quot;isolation&quot; <br/>
is more of a practice for us but never a goal. Not for our family, <br/>
not in NYC.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And the other most important thing :-) is learning to listen to what you&#39;re<br/>
children are telling you through their actions and words. Schools teach us<br/>
to see what the experts tell us to see and ignore or doubt and not take<br/>
seriously anything that doesn&#39;t match with what we&#39;re taught.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone saying kids need lots of friends or contact with people is wrong. But<br/>
saying kids *don&#39;t* need lots of friends is equally wrong. *Some* kids need<br/>
lots of kids. Some kids don&#39;t. Some kids need bursts of it. Some kids would<br/>
prefer spending every day on their own.<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s important is learning to listen to what you kids are telling you.<br/>
Forget the experts. Your *kids* are the experts :-)<br/>

Thanks, Joyce - you said clearly, what I had tried to say less clearly. :-) I think its important that we listen to our selves and our children to see what we and they need re social contacst ( and other things, of course! )...Leonie<br/>
