<div id="ygrps-yiv-940251717">hi all,<br/>
here&#39;s my thoughts on &quot;school days&quot;.  for unschoolers the whole world is our <br/>
&quot;school&quot; and since some part of the world is in the time span of 9-3pm <br/>
throughout the day, then every day and all the time is a &quot;school day and <br/>
school time&quot;.  I avoid going places at peak times when psers will likely be <br/>
there, my dc love when they have a &quot;private museum&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great using moment recently.  we were at the science center, my dg <br/>
(10, 8) we working together on a project when some psers came to a nearby <br/>
display; i noticed that most of them were more interested in what my dc were <br/>
doing then in the drooning and questions being directed at them.  i felt so <br/>
sorry for them.<br/>
<br/>
for a shortened version of unschoolers, I thought users and using would be <br/>
good, since it describes what we do (use what we can to learn about what we <br/>
want to know).<br/>
<br/>
