<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015863014">Thanks to everyone for their advice on helping my son learn Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;d like some advice on unschooling specifically. I decided to <br/>
homeschool my seven year old son because he was learning very little <br/>
in school. His a very bright child - learned to read at home when he <br/>
was five, loves science, constantly makes up stories. I&#39;ve always <br/>
provided him with learning materials and encouraged all his<br/>
interests. <br/>
I almost feel I&#39;ve been homeschooling him since he was born. School <br/>
was just somewhere he went when I was at work. It&#39;s safe to say he<br/>
did <br/>
virtually nothing in school. And it was very hard to convince his <br/>
teachers that my son was not the child they had in class. One even <br/>
wanted him to be tested for ADD. I&#39;m no expert, but a child who can <br/>
sit and read a book for hours and teach himself to play chess does<br/>
not <br/>
have an attention problem. My husband likes to say that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
have ADD, just BORED. <br/>
<br/>
I never considered unschooling. I&#39;m a certified teacher. I spent 4 <br/>
years in college and 2 years in graduate school being told how to <br/>
teach and the past 5 actually teaching. Everyone in my family expects <br/>
me to &quot;teach&quot; my son. My brother-in-law likes to joke that my son<br/>
will <br/>
be in college by the time he&#39;s 10. This wouldn&#39;t have bothered me so <br/>
much a few months ago. I had every intention of &quot;teaching&quot; my son.<br/>
But <br/>
over the past few weeks, I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading (mostly<br/>
John <br/>
Holt) and thinking because my attempts to teach my son have failed.<br/>
It <br/>
is becoming clear to me that simply switching the environment in<br/>
which <br/>
he is &quot;taught&quot; won&#39;t change how he learns. It&#39;s been so exasperating <br/>
because I know he is incredibly smart and interested in the world. <br/>
I&#39;ve witnessed this his whole life. So I&#39;ve come to the conclusion <br/>
that he just doesn&#39;t like to be taught.<br/>
<br/>
Now you must understand, this is very difficult for me. My whole <br/>
adult life has been devoted to teaching. So yes, my world has been <br/>
shaken. But I&#39;m very open-minded and I love my son very much. I want <br/>
him to have the best &quot;education&quot; - what ever that may be. But I&#39;m <br/>
extremely nervous about unschooling. It&#39;s against my instincts, or <br/>
should I say &quot;conditioning.&quot; And to make things more difficult, my <br/>
entire family expects me to take control and make my son learn. I&#39;ve <br/>
been feeling a bit overwhelmed and confused. My head is saying, &quot;sit <br/>
him down and make him learn,&quot; while my heart is saying, &quot;let him do <br/>
what he has always done and just be there to help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How do you handle it? Do you ever have doubts or worry that you&#39;re <br/>
doing something that will be harmful to your child? How do you get <br/>
past the conditioning that society has imposed on us? I really want<br/>
to <br/>
try unschooling, but it&#39;s a bit like jumping out of a plane.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874642075">Tammy, that&#39;s a tricky situation you have there.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know what that would be like.  I have complete <br/>
confidence in my children, and the fact that their <br/>
upbringing is &#39;different.&#39;  Dh once asked me if I were <br/>
making them different on purpose, I asked him what was <br/>
wrong with being different...  Me, on the other hand, I <br/>
don&#39;t know which way&#39;s up sometimes, I don&#39;t know why I <br/>
can&#39;t seem to regain the confidence in my parenting as <br/>
I ahd a couple of years ago.  I just don&#39;t know where <br/>
it went.  But that&#39;s not your problem, is it?  It seems <br/>
to me that your problem is your family, they expect a <br/>
great deal from you.  Hang on, slow down, who&#39;s problem <br/>
is this?  &#39;They&#39; expect from &#39;you.&#39;  Hmm.  Sounds like <br/>
it could be their problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Apart from that, you have years of experience in your <br/>
career telling you one thing, and years (7 of them) of <br/>
experience as a parent teling you the total opposite.  <br/>
The question is, which are you going to listen to?  I <br/>
can&#39;t tell you that.  I can reassure you that <br/>
unschooling does work, I&#39;ve met them :-) and that you <br/>
already know the answer, it&#39;s just going to take some <br/>
adjusting to.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a little :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, as one who has jumped out of an airplane, I can tell you the<br/>
experience of full of the most profound silence you will ever hear.  ;)<br/>
After your chute opens you are treated to a gentle float surrounded by<br/>
complete silence.  It&#39;s heavenly.  An unschooling is just like that... one<br/>
you leap out the door, slide past the engine backblast, you are treated to<br/>
life as it flows along.  Of course every so often you can hit an air thermal<br/>
or some rough winds, and you have to watch out for power lines, but for the<br/>
most part it&#39;s the most awesome ride.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I happen to be one that never worries I&#39;m harming my child.  I&#39;ve<br/>
parented long enough to know that without a doubt I&#39;ll harm my child. I&#39;ll<br/>
say things that hurt. I&#39;ll screw up by not doing something they consider<br/>
very important.  There&#39;s just all kind of ways to screw up when you are a<br/>
parent.  The reason I quit worrying about it is that I&#39;ve spent a great deal<br/>
of time working on staying aware of our family life. I&#39;ve worked on<br/>
creating a home where folks speak up and speak truthfully to one another,<br/>
where shame and fear have no permanent resting place.  It&#39;s hard work and<br/>
never-ending, but it beats worrying by a mile.<br/>

with him.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The juxtaposition of these sentences should show you a great deal  Your<br/>
brother in law sees that this child soaks up material like a sponge and they<br/>
*expect* you to nurture this.<br/>
<br/>
And of course at some point you have to not care what they think.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think back to your childhood, did you enjoy being taught every little<br/>
thing??  When was the last time you felt free to learn and think on your<br/>
own? and not have it graded and stamped with approval?  I&#39;m gong to tell you<br/>
a secret.  :::looking both ways:::: the kids are fine, they will even be<br/>
fine if you fight over doing math every so often. They will even be fine if<br/>
you insist they have to learn cursive, though goodness knows in the 21st<br/>
Century no one is going to use it.  Unschooling is about us, the old ones,<br/>
learning to trust again.  The synergy created by us creating breathing room<br/>
for academic freedom, and the kids actually being able to grow within that<br/>
freedom is what will heal our educational system/ culture.  It&#39;s the model<br/>
others can draw on to stop the high stakes testing, rigid tracking system<br/>
and other attributes of system stuck in fear.  The more courage you model<br/>
for your son, the more we all benefit<br/>

through carefully, I just want to add here that when I was doing my<br/>
teacher training, I was exposed to Holt and other &quot;radical&quot; pedagogists,<br/>
but I wonder if others are.  I read Holt and others, but I also had<br/>
professors who had been active int he free school movement.  When I&#39;ve had<br/>
classes full of mostly education majors, I make sure they read Holt and<br/>
others.  I try to fit Holt into my classes whenever I can.  This coming<br/>
semester, I&#39;m doing a unit on the relationship between grades and learning<br/>
and I was just thinking tonight whether I should stick with the 4 essays<br/>
my partner found or if I should dig up some Holt to add.  This semester<br/>
I&#39;ll have a mixed bag...a few ed majors mixed in with the rest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141724566">&quot;Everyone in my family expects me to &quot;teach&quot; my son.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hi there. This reminded me of Christmas dinner at my in-law&#39;s. We&#39;re the<br/>
only ones in the family who homeschool (they don&#39;t even know what &quot;unschool&quot;<br/>
means). Everyone else is big into ps or Montessori. Somehow it came up to my<br/>
7 yo niece that my kids don&#39;t go to school. This was beyond her<br/>
comprehension. Her mother teaches at the same Montessori she attended and<br/>
they are completely entrenched in conventional educational ideas. So the<br/>
girl&#39;s grandmother says &quot;Their mommy teaches them.&quot; To which I stupidly (aka<br/>
honestly) reply &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t teach them. They just learn on their own.&quot;<br/>
Stunned silence. Then they decide I&#39;m kidding and laugh and we all have more<br/>
dinner. I figure, why get into it?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know he is incredibly smart and interested in the world.<br/>
I&#39;ve witnessed this his whole life. So I&#39;ve come to the conclusion<br/>
that he just doesn&#39;t like to be taught.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There you go. My husband and I realized at some point (while still in high<br/>
school) that we learned more on our own than we ever learned in school. So<br/>
unschooling came rather naturally.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now you must understand, this is very difficult for me. My whole<br/>
adult life has been devoted to teaching. So yes, my world has been<br/>
shaken...How do you handle it? Do you ever have doubts or worry that you&#39;re<br/>
doing something that will be harmful to your child? How do you get<br/>
past the conditioning that society has imposed on us? I really want<br/>
to try unschooling, but it&#39;s a bit like jumping out of a plane.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ve always wanted to skydive.) You sound like an ideal unschooling parent:<br/>
You love your son and wants what&#39;s best for him. You know he learns very<br/>
well on his own. You know &quot;teaching&quot; just spoils the process. But there&#39;s<br/>
those pesky relatives and those ingrained ideas. Well, reading Holt and<br/>
others will help you deschool. (Do you subscribe to Home Education Magazine?<br/>
I highly recommend it.) As for the relatives...do they need to know<br/>
everything? There&#39;s very creative ways to get around the &quot;what did you do<br/>
for school today?&quot; questions. When someone asks my kids that, they always<br/>
come up with an avalanche of things they&#39;ve been doing, completely unaided<br/>
by me. Just take it day by day. Hang out on these lists. Have fun with your<br/>
son. If he&#39;s interested in something, get him materials. Enjoy.<br/>

So true, and it can still all work out gloriously. I made the most &quot;mistakes&quot; <br/>
with my oldest,(just turned 20, born when I was 23 and still living with my <br/>
parents) and she&#39;s doing fine now. We had a couple of rough years beween 15 <br/>
and now but she&#39;s on track with herself now. A lot of what I have had to give <br/>
my kids is what we didn&#39;t do...like school. Also open communication and a <br/>
willingness to admit mistakes and to hear their feedback has helped.<br/>

&gt; &gt; what he has always done and just be there to<br/>
&gt; help.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; And there are good reasons are there not to listen<br/>
&gt; to your heart??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a suggestion if you really want to make a go of<br/>
unschooling/ leting your child be in charge of his<br/>
eduacation. Yet you are having a hard time letting go<br/>
of teacing..Figure out what you want to do now. FInd<br/>
things to do in the meantime until maybe you logic<br/>
mind is saying the samethings as your heart.<br/>
<br/>
What I have found is helpful for unschooling parents<br/>
is to return focus on their lives rather than focus in<br/>
their children&#39;s lives. What do you feel like learning<br/>
right now?<br/>
<br/>
All I know is after you read enough Holt and other<br/>
homeschooling books it changes your view on learning<br/>
so much you will never go back. At least that&#39;s my<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525032513">I can empathise, here, I know how hard it is to listen <br/>
to my heart when my head is saying the opposite, and <br/>
vice versa, even though I know which one makes most <br/>
sense.  Like parenting, I know I can act differently to <br/>
how I act around my children, the knowledge and <br/>
information is there in my head, but something stops me <br/>
using it (my heart?  or my cultural training...  <br/>
whichever, the info in my head isn&#39;t in my heart, or <br/>
I&#39;d have much less trouble with it)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about my children&#39;s academic <br/>
acheivements, that&#39;s their problem.  I do worry about <br/>
harming them, because I haven&#39;t as yet been able to <br/>
work on creating the atmosphere you describe.  I hold <br/>
you up as my model!  *grin*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671155843">Tammy I know you have lots of responses already so I hope I don&#39;t say<br/>
something redundant.   What struck me most was when you said<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now you must understand, this is very difficult for me. My whole<br/>
&gt; adult life has been devoted to teaching. So yes, my world has been<br/>
&gt; shaken. But I&#39;m very open-minded and I love my son very much. I want<br/>
&gt; him to have the best &quot;education&quot; - what ever that may be. But I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; extremely nervous about unschooling. It&#39;s against my instincts, or<br/>
&gt; should I say &quot;conditioning.&quot; And to make things more difficult, my<br/>
&gt; entire family expects me to take control and make my son learn. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been feeling a bit overwhelmed and confused. My head is saying, &quot;sit<br/>
&gt; him down and make him learn,&quot; while my heart is saying, &quot;let him do<br/>
&gt; what he has always done and just be there to help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it is &quot;conditioning.&quot;  I used to get worried that we weren&#39;t doing<br/>
enough.  I have since realized that when I insist on &quot;work&quot; it isn&#39;t because<br/>
I am worried anymore, it is a control issue.  If I feel that I am not able<br/>
to do things that I want to do, I often start telling others what to do.<br/>
Keep in mind that you do have a lot of conditioning to overcome.  I always<br/>
remember that if I can do it, then my children won&#39;t have to when they are<br/>
grown. :)  They will have had the wonderful experience of learning in their<br/>
own way, enjoying life in the present and not experience childhood as some<br/>
training station for adulthood.  I have many times found myself in the<br/>
position of saying, &quot;That won&#39;t work, do it this way&quot; only to be proven<br/>
wrong.  I realize it is my creativity which has suffered from being taught,<br/>
not they who are suffering from not being taught.  Life is not formulaic, so<br/>
we can&#39;t have a formula for wht everybody should know, should not know.  We<br/>
can only listen to our children&#39;s needs and desires and help them acomplish<br/>
their own goals. After a while, you will have watched your son accomplish<br/>
some amazing things, make the od statement, or suddenly jump in some area of<br/>
interest, and then you will know why so many are devoted to unschooling.<br/>
I know that you will be thinking about this constanly and trying to work it<br/>
out in your head.  It is a hard shift to make, but once it is made, once you<br/>
see children who have grown in this way (and it can take months or years to<br/>
see any outcome), there is no going back. It is so liberating and wonderful,<br/>
for parents as well as children. Good luck on your unschooling journey!<br/>
Peace<br/>
Julie<br/>
PS  A friend said to me recently, everybody we know has started out<br/>
structured and gotten less so.  SOme people do school at home and stay<br/>
there, but NOBODY starts out with child-led learning in mind and gets more<br/>
structured. IME this is true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you handle it? Do you ever have doubts or worry that you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; doing something that will be harmful to your child? How do you get<br/>
&gt; past the conditioning that society has imposed on us? I really want<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; try unschooling, but it&#39;s a bit like jumping out of a plane.<br/>

wanted to teach them to her she would smell it a mile<br/>
