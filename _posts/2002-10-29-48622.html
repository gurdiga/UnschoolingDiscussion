 </span></blockquote>That would be a great idea, but this ordinance would only affect our <br/>
town (about 3000 people).  McDonalds is out of town.  There really <br/>
isn&#39;t a business district.  There are two little parks, but there&#39;s a <br/>
good chance we&#39;d be the only ones there if we went there.  We have a <br/>
goal of 500 signatures, and the only way we&#39;re going to get them is <br/>
going door to door.  Also, in addition to the petition, we&#39;re doing a <br/>
survey.  We&#39;re going to every house on every major street in town and <br/>
we&#39;re keeping track of the yes&#39;s and the no&#39;s.  Then we&#39;ll show what <br/>
percentage of residents are for or against the ordinance.  We&#39;ll make <br/>
a little graph up.  I&#39;m going to call a lawyer and see if we can get <br/>
a letter with the lawyer&#39;s opinion of the constitutionality of it.  <br/>
If the ordinance passes, we&#39;ll probably get the required signatures <br/>
asking for the ordinance to be voted by ballot as a referendum.  It <br/>
is quite an education for my daughter! <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is quite upset by this.  Yesterday a council member told <br/>
us that it doesn&#39;t matter how many signatures we get, the ordinance <br/>
will go through.  A skateboarder cursed at his wife when she asked <br/>
him to leave her property, so he&#39;s out for revenge.  <br/>

Are you going to carry your petition along with you when you Trick or Treat?<br/>
<br/>
Can you put the kids in costumes NOW and do &quot;reverse&quot; Trick or Treating,<br/>
giving people candy and asking them to sign?<br/>

the bad kids, but that&#39;s the way it is.  <br/>
<br/>
We talked to a different council member today, who said he won&#39;t vote <br/>
for the ordinance as is.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my guess that they will ban skateboards but not scooters, but <br/>
I&#39;m going to put my best fight up to keep them from banning either!  <br/>
