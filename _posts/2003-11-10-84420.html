<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538134882">I can&#39;t remember who but someone on this list wanted info for a child that was very interested in computer animation. This is a little off the subject but very cool. I heard a radio program on machinima, where people take video games and use them to make movies...an example can be found at redvsblue.com...There&#39;s also a site with software (I think) to download so people can make there own...or at least get more info...machinima.org. The original piece can be heard at cbc.ca, click on radio, radio one then programs and Definately Not The Opera. If anyones interested I&#39;ll post a link later to it. Thought it would be good for computer, movie and video games lovers.<br/>
