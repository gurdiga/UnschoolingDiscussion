&gt; It is none of my business, but when you mentioned pain and fatigue I was<br/>
&gt; interested.  I have Lupus/fibromyalgia.  I live with what you describe.<br/>
It<br/>
&gt; is so frustrating.  Do you have either?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Certainly not offended by your asking!  Yes, I have been diagnosed with <br/>
FMS...a rather nasty case of it at the moment.  The jury is still out on the <br/>
Lupus diagnosis.  I test highly positive but don&#39;t have enough (or strong <br/>
enough) markers for the rheumatologist (sp?) to call it Lupus.  So I&#39;m in a <br/>
holding pattern and we are treating me as if for FMS only.  If Lupus is <br/>
involved, it is SLE.  Sjogren&#39;s Syndrome is also considered a high <br/>
possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday DH decided I need to start learning to conserve my energy a <br/>
little better.  We were shopping.  Finished the Costco trip (not a big one, <br/>
thank goodness!) and I was exhausted.  But there were a couple of items that <br/>
I really wanted to get at a regular grocery store.  He wouldn&#39;t even drive <br/>
the car into the parking lot unless I agreed to use a wheelchair shopping <br/>
cart!  The stinker.  Gotta love him.  Just hate admitting he is right about <br/>
things like this.  Anyway, we found a cart that had handles and a bench seat <br/>
that was adult size, but not motorized (my brain power wasn&#39;t up to learning <br/>
how to drive the motorized one!) and he had lots of fun pushing me around the <br/>
store.  Me, I was mortified, but I&#39;ll get over it.<br/>
<br/>
I got a handicapped parking permit recently and it took DH parking in the <br/>
handicapped spot when he took me places to start training me that it really <br/>
was okay to use those spots, too.  Now, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ve gone all these <br/>
years without it.  It makes such a difference.  It&#39;s gotten to the point that <br/>
if there isn&#39;t a handicapped spot or one just as close, I skip that store.  <br/>
(oops!  Didn&#39;t mean to go on quite so much.  But, I&#39;m glad that this is a <br/>
list where it&#39;s okay to have a life and we&#39;re not strictly limited to <br/>
education issues!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking.  I hope you aren&#39;t having as much trouble with it as I am <br/>
right now.  OTOH, it has forced me to be a SAHM and unschool, both of which <br/>
are very important to me!  (I suppose I &#39;could&#39; put him in ps, but it&#39;s not <br/>
worth the anxiety I feel every time I even contemplate THAT idea...so, we are <br/>
homeschoolers and rapidly learning to LOVE unschooling!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67324680">Not this paticular one. Although, I&#39;m sure they have those. This one is<br/>
actually a spin off of this list. We started to realize that there were a<br/>
lot of us on the list with physcical challenges and Buzz was nice enough to<br/>
start the list for us. It is definitly for the adults with the challenges. I<br/>
think you&#39;ll like it.<br/>
