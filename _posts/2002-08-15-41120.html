<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ~heather asks, in fun,<br/>
&gt; Ps-  and Ned - what is hell anyway ;-) just kidding -<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hell is listening to young mothers taling about what curriculum to stuff<br/>
down their kid&#39;s throat this year. Hell is watching parent smack their<br/>
children in the supermarket because they reached out and touched something<br/>
irresistable on a shelf.<br/>
<br/>
Hell is imagining a Hell just because some fool said it exists and I should<br/>
fear going there after I live a life of doing my best whether it exists or<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
Are we off topic yet? ....No?....   OK,  Hell is missing short putts. Hell<br/>
is homework. I&#39;ve made several hour-long TV programs,  called &quot;School is<br/>
Hell&quot; and they play regularly on cable access hereabouts. I&#39;m sure those<br/>
make a little Hell for the local school pushers. (anyone want copies?)<br/>
(now I have to say &quot;no wink intended,&quot; when I follow a question mark with a<br/>
) <br/>
<br/>
Hell is caring what other people think.<br/>
