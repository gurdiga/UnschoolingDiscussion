as there are so many of us.  But you are on the right track.  If you explore <br/>
with him, keeping him safe then you take the mystery out of it.  It is no <br/>
longer forbidden and he sees you as someone who will help him with what he wants to <br/>
do.  Not someone he has to sneak around to do what he wants to do.  This is <br/>
how we made it to unschooling, it just naturally flowed from one to the other <br/>
and the principals of trust and respect have carried us through.<br/>

My boys are 6 and 9 now.  When the 6 year old was really young he loved <br/>
LEGOs, still does, I would sit down with the boys for hours playing with LEGOs and <br/>
letting the younger one play too.  <br/>

I am sorry, but I cannot stand hearing parents at the <br/>
playground say &quot;you are too young for that.&quot;  They would be amazed at what <br/>
their kids could climb or do if they would just let them.<br/>
&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told this story before, but Marty was a diaper-baby (1 and a half <br/>
maybe?) and Kirby was three, and we were at a park where we played every week with <br/>
other families who were all La Leche League based.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby had become afraid of slides and swings, as some kids do when they gain <br/>
an awareness of the danger, and so he was sitting with the moms.  The <br/>
playground equipment is a brand called &quot;Mexican Forge&quot; and there are platforms with <br/>
holes all in them (for easy grabbing) and everything is coated with a soft vinyl <br/>
stuff.  Very easy to climb.<br/>
<br/>
Older girls were taking Marty down the slide with them and he was at the top <br/>
of a slide waiting for another big kid to take him, very politely waiting his <br/>
turn.  He was kinda squat-bouncing, like babies do, so it might have looked to <br/>
others like he was about to launch himself, but those of us who knew the <br/>
routine knew he was waiting for one of the girls.<br/>
<br/>
Two older women were there, and one said in the LOUD judgmental grandma <br/>
voice, &quot;WHOSE little baby is that way up there&quot; or something like that.  The answer <br/>
was basically &quot;whoever responds to this accusation has been adjudged BAD mom, <br/>
BAD mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other moms with me tried not to laugh, I walked casually over and stood <br/>
talking to Marty, helped him slide down by holding my arm out, and carried him <br/>
away saying &quot;You were making those other women nervous.&quot;  I didn&#39;t say it <br/>
where they could hear it. I wasn&#39;t as brave then. &lt;g&gt;   Marty was not in any <br/>
danger.  I wasn&#39;t ashamed or embarrassed.  I was just unwilling to have them nag me.<br/>

Yes, a mother (or other adult) should be with the child, but I think there&#39;s <br/>
a lot to be said developmentally for a child&#39;s ability to go into another room <br/>
and explore on their own if they want to. <br/>
===============<br/>
<br/>
Our old house had child-proof latches (that the children could open, but it <br/>
reminded them &quot;ouchie&quot;) and a yard free of any stickers or sharp gravel.  Great <br/>
kid yard.  Covered patio, 18x20, new concrete; lawn, no roses or other thorny <br/>
plants.  Door to the back yard; back yard had gates on bothsides.   VERY <br/>
kid-friendly!<br/>
<br/>
New house is crazy dangerous.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt; I truly believe that if parents attempt to &quot;help&quot; their children through <br/>
this,<br/>
they are only giving them the lesson that they cannot trust their own<br/>
judgement.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And it shouldn&#39;t stop in the toddler years;  the same thing should just <br/>
continue on into the kid and teens years. I&#39;m not saying not to help or assist, but <br/>
for a parent to constantly be telling a child or teen that he CANNOT do <br/>
such-and-such or MUST do whatever only leads to the child not trusting his own <br/>
judgement.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s so important to me---that my children CAN trust themselves (and can <br/>
trust me not to run their lives!).<br/>

There was someone else at the conference in South Carolina with a <br/>
little girl who was a lot like Roya - I wish I could remember who it <br/>
was. I took her and watched her in the other room for a little while so <br/>
her mom could have a bit of time to watch a speaker.  If that mom is <br/>
here on this list - I just want you to know she is a remarkable little <br/>
girl and all you can do is appreciate that energy level and expect it <br/>
to continue and support her in the wonderful things she&#39;s going to do <br/>
in her life!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
That was darling Lydia. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah yes!!! I have NEVER seen a kid go right between people&#39;s legs, time <br/>
herself perfectly to get out a door just before it closed, and get her <br/>
socks off ON THE WAY to the pool -- all in the blink of an eye!!!<br/>
<br/>
Really took me back to when Roya was little. And I was WAAAAAAAY <br/>
younger, too!!!!!<br/>
