<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209259376">My ds (9) would be labeled if I had him evaluated.  I chose not to because I<br/>
used to do evaluations for a living.  The information isn&#39;t going to tell<br/>
you anything you don&#39;t know....he&#39;s a nervous kind of kid who doesn&#39;t like<br/>
separation.  All the evaluation does is to compare him to a large group of<br/>
kids and see where he falls along the bell curve.  You probably know pretty<br/>
much exactly where he would fall.<br/>
<br/>
Then, after you get the label, you will be pushed to medicate or at the very<br/>
least get counseling.  If you feel he needs either, go ahead.  If not, don&#39;t<br/>
bother.<br/>
