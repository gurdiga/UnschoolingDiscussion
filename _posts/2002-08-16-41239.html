&gt; My 12 year old boy recently  asked if we could go golfing sometime. I&#39;m not a<br/>
&gt; golfer, but I said yes, and we went to a driving range and rented a couple<br/>
&gt; clubs and had at it.<br/>

How great. That was the age at which I started to play golf. My mother was a<br/>
famous champion, but I mostly played with my father who taught me and<br/>
launched me into tournament golf. It has been my game ever since -- that&#39;s<br/>
56 years now. It also has been one of my professions along the way (Iplayed<br/>
on the PGA tour at 23 as an amateur and became a part-time teaching pro<br/>
about 20 years ago. I&#39;ve written two books about it (available on Amazon)<br/>
and would be happy to send you copies of both (free of course) -- send<br/>
address to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nedvare@...">nedvare@...</a>  One is a small flip-book for people learning<br/>
the various shots (25,000 sold); the other is theoretical, but with<br/>
instruction for the more advanced players and other teachers -- an actual<br/>
book with good reviews from top writers in the field.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I know Gilmore and Caddy Shack, and Bill Murray is one of my<br/>
favorite people that I don&#39;t know.<br/>
