<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348660767">&quot;All the sudden, dh says &quot;crap&quot; and shakes his head laughing.  He says<br/>
 &quot;I have been arguing against getting an Easybake for 2 years and here the<br/>
 kids are learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yea...life is getting so much better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s great! It&#39;s so much better to have a supportive partner...even tolerance is rather grating. Our unschooling lives have positively leaped forward on the joy scale since dh became fully supportive. Very cool.<br/>
