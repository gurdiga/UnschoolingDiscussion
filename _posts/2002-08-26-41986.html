<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752655351">I was sitting here pondering just how to qualify a person that <br/>
is &quot;important&quot; in light of this board.<br/>
I meandered over to google to see if I could get a definitive answer.<br/>
A person not considered important by someone here turned up six <br/>
hundred some odd hits when the name was typed in with the term <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
Not that I need google to tell me how important so many voices here <br/>
have been to me. I know the profound changes some of these incredible <br/>
ladies have made in my life......I meant to add Mary (Zenmomma) to my <br/>
previous list, (didn&#39;t mean to forget ya Mary, your posts are <br/>
priceless to me).<br/>
Anyway, it was sheer curiosity and pondering that made me do it.<br/>
So I typed in my name, Ren and unschooling and guess what? It turned <br/>
up 514 hits!! I was scratching my head, knowing it couldn&#39;t be <br/>
accurate, and started to scroll down.<br/>
The first two were posts I had written at the F.U.N. site some <br/>
previous months.....from there on all the hits were bringing up <br/>
anything with CHILD(REN). LOL!!<br/>
I was hoping google thought I was important, damn!<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s one of the posts I answered to a distressed Mom that wasn&#39;t <br/>
sure her children would learn anything if she unschooled:<br/>

Comments<br/>
First of all, why do you feel it is your responsibility to keep up <br/>
with a system that you disagree with? Losing that mindset will be <br/>
very beneficial if you are going to truly unschool. I think it is <br/>
also detrimental to the joy of today to be worrying about possible <br/>
future disasters. I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t think about and plan for the <br/>
future....I am suggesting that we do what is right and best for today <br/>
though. Don&#39;t let possiblities that may never happen rob you of your <br/>
joyful, wonderful moments today. How could you guarantee those things <br/>
if your child was in public school? You wouldn&#39;t be able to ensure <br/>
they would always be at grade level, or that they&#39;d be alright in the <br/>
event of some disaster. I would much rather my child have <br/>
their &quot;self&quot; intact, the strength of knowing who they are, what they <br/>
love and learn what they choose outside the realm of some false <br/>
environment in which they will likely encounter bullying, pressure to <br/>
conform and numerous messages I&#39;d rather they never hear. There are <br/>
no guarantees for the future in this life. That should not dictate <br/>
our choice to unschool or not. Do you believe that children are born <br/>
with a natural curiosity about their world? That they are driven to <br/>
learn and do so joyfully? Believe me when I say that it can continue <br/>
past the preschool years if you trust your child. <br/>
<br/>
I must disagree with the previous answer to you o this point that <br/>
there is no best way.... Joy is better than strife, a happy home <br/>
better than a frustrated one, a content child better than a <br/>
distressed one, a close, loving bond between parent and child better <br/>
than contention. If what you are doing lends itself to these &quot;better&quot; <br/>
ways, then you are headed in the right direction. If not, then please <br/>
consider unschooling as the answer. Trusting my children to make <br/>
their own choices has brought amazing results, and much joy to this <br/>
family. It&#39;s us, the parents that must change, that must delve deep <br/>
withing to find the strength and discipline to shut up and let go!! <br/>
Children are wired to learn, to delve, to BE exactly what they are <br/>
meant to. We must learn how to offer without coercing, strew without <br/>
pressure and learn alongside our child without chafing. Not the <br/>
easiest task for our minds dulled by the institution of ps. There is <br/>
this wide world filled with colors, sights, sounds, tastes....just <br/>
waiting to be explored. Approach it as a child would, with joy, <br/>
interest and eyes wide open. <br/>
<br/>
Today, do what brings joy in your life and the future will be very <br/>
bright indeed. <br/>
<br/>
Paint with your bodies, walk in the mud, search for albino squirrels, <br/>
observe a flower opening, fly a kite, visit the beach, watch <br/>
interesting movies while eating chocolate and popcorn, build a fort, <br/>
try to pick up ice cubes with your feet, buy some interesting art <br/>
supplies and play around with them, dance to some reggae, lay outside <br/>
at night and look at the stars... In short, LIVE!! Live life with <br/>
abandon, with love, joy and zeal. All the learning anyone ever needs <br/>
will come out of these honest explorations, really. It&#39;s hard to <br/>
believe until you do it. <br/>
<br/>
I highly encourage you visit unschooling.com for dialogue with many, <br/>
many unschooling families that are at various stages in this journey. <br/>
They will offer much needed support. <br/>

<br/>
I thought maybe, in light of the unfair accusations against this <br/>
list, this would show Ned what the discussions here are typically <br/>
about. Even though this is from another list, it hugely shows the <br/>
spirit and attitude of the unschooling.com discussion group. <br/>
In my ever so humble opinion.<br/>

LOL! I thought I was the only one who did this kind of stuff. &lt;g&gt; If you put <br/>
in just zenmomma at Google, you get 3 hits. And, I kid you not, the first <br/>
one actually says &quot;...By Neri N on Saturday, October 13, 2001 - 11:47 pm: <br/>
Just read your post Zenmomma. And I just have to say, I think you are <br/>
brilliant ...&quot; ROFLMAO!! That&#39;s one to send to the parents! ;-) Or an <br/>
ex-husband, if I had one.<br/>
<br/>
I loved the post you quoted here, Ren.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
~Mary, who needs to read kind posts today because her bunny died this <br/>
morning. :-(<br/>
