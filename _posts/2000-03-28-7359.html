<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557452871">okay, a little late on the thread but i thought i would toss in that it is <br/>
hard to be counter cultural in the sleep arena.  people put pressure on each <br/>
other w/out meaning to, and we all have to find out we are OK the way we are, <br/>
that there is nothing (or something depending on your opinion) intrinsically <br/>
wrong w/different sleep habits!  personally i cannot expect a happy family <br/>
when they havent had enough sleep or food.  and our habits happen to fall <br/>
into pretty normal range.  (actually my kids go to bed earlier than most <br/>
(8pm), and my 10yodd doesnt even mind!  she gets up early in the am and <br/>
reads...)  plus, i like the control that i feel when everyone is in bed and i <br/>
can relax!  haha!  so we are regular (not scheduled necessarily, just aware <br/>
of who needs what) about sleep and meals.  it seems to keep us healthy and <br/>
happy.  oh-- i also agree with someone else&#39;s point about having younger kids <br/>
(some infant/toddler ages) affecting the household needs in this area!<br/>
<br/>
ok, the old tv question, too.  as my kids get older they have more say just <br/>
like in everything else about what they would like to see.  so to me it is a <br/>
similar issue as other things: when they are little, we the parents have to <br/>
set the limits, then as they grow, they take over so that by the time they <br/>
are teens they are making decisions.<br/>
also, i think i have a personal distaste for tv watching in general because <br/>
for me it is such a passive escape thing.  i think for others it is not <br/>
neccesarily this way, just my makeup.  but i think it more likely that my <br/>
kids are like me and so i err on the side of encouraging productive activity <br/>
unless a veg-time need is evident... than we (or whoever needs it) all crash <br/>
and veg, but we are choosing it on purpose.  rather than being controlling,  <br/>
i just try to share with them what i have learned for myself about these <br/>
things....<br/>
