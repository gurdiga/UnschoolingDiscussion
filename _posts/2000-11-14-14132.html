&gt; 1. WHAT THE GUIDEBOOKS DON&#39;T TELL YOU...<br/>
&gt; &quot;Six New Ways to Score Cheap Flights on the Net&quot;<br/>
&gt; By Michael Shapiro<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you watch TV or listen to the radio, you&#39;ve probably heard William<br/>
Shatner &quot;sing&quot; the praises of Priceline.com, the web site where you can name<br/>
your price for airline tickets, rental cars and hotel rooms. But what if<br/>
you&#39;re not comfortable bidding for travel products, or if you can&#39;t live<br/>
with Priceline&#39;s severe restrictions? (Priceline lets you pick travel dates<br/>
but not flights times or airline.) Well, there&#39;s a slew of new travel sites<br/>
that offer bargains with better terms.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hotwire (http://www.hotwire.com) launched in October and is similar to<br/>
Priceline in that you can&#39;t choose travel times or airline. But there&#39;s a<br/>
key difference: Hotwire doesn&#39;t ask you to bid - the site shows you the best<br/>
price for that route. Of course you still have to be flexible; your flight<br/>
may leave anytime between early morning and late evening, though Hotwire<br/>
will not put you on an overnight flight unless you agree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Orbitz (http://www.orbitz.com) is the spawn of major airlines, and thus<br/>
not a place you&#39;d expect to find good deals. But this is a good place to<br/>
survey prices because Orbitz has an excellent search tool that shows far<br/>
more options than other leading travel sites. However Orbitz just a place to<br/>
look until next year when it launches its booking capability.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Qixo (http://www.qixo.com) scans about a dozen online travel sites,<br/>
including budget outlets like CheapTickets.com, to find the best price. So<br/>
Qixo can help you save another valuable commodity: time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Savvio (http://www.savvio.com) lowers the price for flights and cruises as<br/>
the departure date approaches. This makes sense because once a plane flies<br/>
or a ship sails, the seat or cabin is worthless. Though Savvio&#39;s prices<br/>
might not be as low as Priceline&#39;s or Hotwire&#39;s, there&#39;s no risk of getting<br/>
stuck on a 6 a.m. flight because you can see flight times before deciding to<br/>
buy. Its air offerings are limited to TWA, ATA and other marginal carriers,<br/>
but it hopes to expand by January. Savvio plans to focus on overseas flights<br/>
to Asia and Europe, but the company also features domestic airfares.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At iDerive (http://www.iderive.com) a consumer buys a discount ticket, but<br/>
if the airline needs the ticket back to sell to a higher paying business<br/>
traveler, it bumps the iDerive customer five days before departure. As<br/>
payment for getting bumped, the consumer receives a full refund, plus a<br/>
sizable bounty. With a motto of &quot;Save or get paid,&quot; iDerive targets the<br/>
ultra-flexible traveler, for example college students or someone who could<br/>
drive if they get bumped. Maybe a better motto would be &quot;Get bumped without<br/>
driving to the airport.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Revelex (http://www.revelex.com) is creating an online marketplace where<br/>
buyers and sellers negotiate until a sale is made. So a hotel could offer a<br/>
room for $100; a traveler could bid $60, and then the hotel could choose to<br/>
lower its price to $80 and see if the traveler will raise her bid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If all this sounds complicated, well, it is. In the end it may be just as<br/>
easy, and just as affordable, to check your newspaper&#39;s Sunday travel<br/>
section and call discounters in your area.<br/>

&gt; 2. HOSTEL NEWS<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go Skiing Without Paying Ski Resort Prices. Hostel Accommodations Near<br/>
Major Ski Resorts for Just $7-28!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t have to pay resort prices for a great skiing holiday -- if you<br/>
choose Hostelling International-American Youth Hostels (HI-AYH) for your<br/>
overnight accommodations.  Overnight fees at 36 HI-AYH hostels located in<br/>
some of the USA&#39;s top ski areas range from just $7 to $28 per person, per<br/>
night.  Many hostels have arranged special ski packages and a variety of<br/>
discounts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hostels in the west range from Alaska to New Mexico.  Five Colorado<br/>
hostels have bargain overnight rates near such great ski areas as<br/>
Breckenridge, Crested Butte, Purgatory, Aspen, Vail and Copper Mountain.  In<br/>
the Midwest go cross-country skiing out of the hostel&#39;s back door in Itasca<br/>
State Park, Minnesota, and the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area in<br/>
Ohio.  You can also pick one of three great locations in Wisconsin near<br/>
Sunburst, Cascade Mountain or Kettlebowl Hill Ski Areas.  Pennsylvania<br/>
boasts six hostels near ski areas -- several in state parks -- including the<br/>
Pocono Mountains.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In New England, you can ski the top places in Vermont, New Hampshire and<br/>
Massachusetts for just $12-18 a night for your accommodations.   HI-White<br/>
Mountains Hostel in Conway, New Hampshire, includes linen and a continental<br/>
breakfast for the low $18 overnight fee.  Vermont hostels are near<br/>
Killington, Middlebury College Snow Bowl, and Suicide Six and Sonnenberg Ski<br/>
Areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; HI-AYH hostels provide affordable dormitory-style lodgings for travelers<br/>
of all ages.  Separate accommodations are provided for males and females.<br/>
Many hostels have private couple and family rooms available with advance<br/>
reservations.  Most have fully-equipped self-service kitchens, dining areas,<br/>
and common rooms for relaxing and socializing.  Some hostels even have<br/>
unexpected amenities such as hot tubs and fireplaces.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; ===========<br/>
&gt; Mexico City - Ole!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bustling Mexico City is the longest continuously inhabited city in the<br/>
Western Hemisphere and is now the largest city in the world.  Visitors will<br/>
find an abundance of historic sites, museums, parks and gardens, and<br/>
cathedrals along with restaurants for every taste, theater and more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hostelling International has two hostels in Mexico City.  Hostel Catedral<br/>
is located in the Zocalo, or central plaza, which is the world&#39;s largest<br/>
square and Mexico City&#39;s main historic district.  The hostel is just one<br/>
block from the Zocalo subway station which brings you to The Anthropology<br/>
Museum, Chapultepec Park, the Zona Rosa and many other sites.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hostel Catedral has 24-hour access, an Internet Center, a restaurant which<br/>
serves Mexican and Italian specialties, laundry facilities and a travel<br/>
agency.  The hostel has 209 beds and until January 1, 2001, the overnight<br/>
fee is just $9 (U.S.), which includes breakfast!  After January 1st, the<br/>
price will rise to the princely sum of $12.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other hostel, Hostel Home, is a cozy 20-bed, located in the Colonia<br/>
Roma, convenient to the subway.  The hostel has 24-hour access, guest<br/>
kitchen facilities, a TV room, tourist information and bicycle rentals.  The<br/>
overnight fee at Hostel Home is just $8 - a bargain anywhere.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both hostels can make reservations at other hostels in Mexico.<br/>

&gt; 3. READERS SHARE THEIR FAVORITE HOSTEL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Olympic Hostel, Port Townsend in Port Townsend, Washington*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lynn Jones comments, &quot;I have to write to praise a wonderful hostel we<br/>
stayed at a  month ago. It is the Port Townsend Hostel in Washington State.<br/>
It sits on a gorgeous spot overlooking the Puget Sound. It is by far the<br/>
CLEANEST, most well-run hostel I have ever stayed at. Port Townsend is very<br/>
expensive to visit as the hotels are geared to the tourist trade, but I<br/>
don&#39;t think there is a nicer place to stay than the hostel and for a<br/>
fraction of the price. There are wonderful things to do and see in the area.<br/>
A fascinating hands-on marine museum, beautifully restored historic<br/>
buildings, beach front meandering, and great restaurants and shops to name a<br/>
few. This is a real destination spot. Thanks HI-AYH!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Loch Lomond and the Oban Hostel in Scotland*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nancy Wilson comments, &quot;In September 2000, we stayed in two hostels in<br/>
Scotland that were special. One was the castle on Loch Lomond mentioned in<br/>
the recent HI online newsletter. It has a beautiful view of Loch Lomond,<br/>
with a three story atrium as well as carved wooden panels and fireplaces.<br/>
Our room was up in a dormer under the roof -- 77 steps up! But worth it. The<br/>
other hostel we enjoyed was the one in Oban, Scotland. The hostel sits on<br/>
the Esplanade and has a view out towards the sea and islands. The hostel was<br/>
comfortable and remarkable.&quot;<br/>

&gt; 5. TRAVELERS WANTED<br/>
&gt; Paging travelers in Washington DC, the Research Triangle, and San Diego...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Love to travel but still weeks or months away from your last trip?  Do you<br/>
get the travel bug more often than the common cold?  Do you find yourself<br/>
browsing the travel section of every bookstore you set foot in?  Are you<br/>
always on the lookout for fresh new international films or music?  Do you<br/>
attend workshops and seminars that feature distant lands and different<br/>
cultures?  Can&#39;t get enough of the Travel Channel?  Do you spend time<br/>
learning (or thinking about learning) foreign languages?  Is your favorite<br/>
thing about hostelling the other travelers that you meet in the kitchens and<br/>
common rooms?  Is it all about the journey rather than the destination?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re nodding your head to any of this, you&#39;re not alone.  And if you<br/>
live in or near Washington, DC, San Diego, CA or the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel<br/>
Hill area of North Carolina, there&#39;s a new way to do something about it.  In<br/>
these cities, HI-AYH is helping local groups of travelers like yourself get<br/>
together so that they can socialize a little and locally promote the rewards<br/>
of independent travel and hostelling.  Sound like fun?  To find out more,<br/>
send an email to traveler@....<br/>
