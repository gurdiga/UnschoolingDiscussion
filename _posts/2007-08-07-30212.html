<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052290207">No sunburn!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m linking my lyrics game again, partly because I know there are  <br/>
some families (mine included) in which family discussions of the  <br/>
current category or past categories, or the words, has been fun.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wouldn&#39;t play &quot;Let the sun shine, let the sun shine in&quot; from  <br/>
Hair on &quot;sunshine&quot; because she said it wasn&#39;t the word  <br/>
&quot;sunshine.&quot;   (Someone else played it and that&#39;s fine.)<br/>
<br/>
Without getting heavy into grammar at all, we&#39;ve discussed word forms  <br/>
and homonyms and such.    The current word is &quot;does&quot; but it was  <br/>
written down on a game card out of context, so the word &quot;does&quot;  (NOT  <br/>
a homonym--a... what&#39;s the word for looks the same but isn&#39;t  <br/>
pronounced the same?  Homoglyph?  Homograph?) as in a female deer  <br/>
can&#39;t be ruled out.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Other recent words are heaven (which has a playlist of most of the  <br/>
songs people named), teen, church, tired...<br/>
<br/>
You can play on any of the older words too.  With your family you can  <br/>
play the words that weren&#39;t chosen (because usually the whole card  <br/>
shows, and it&#39;s more fun in person with real singing, generally).<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll probably hear some songs you&#39;ve never heard if you listen to  <br/>
the playlists (past playlists are linked in the sidebar), and your  <br/>
kids might hear some they&#39;ll really like that wouldn&#39;t have come to  <br/>
light otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a kind of strewing and thought-shuffling thing that will surely  <br/>
lead to other topics and ideas.  Maybe it will remind you of movies  <br/>
you had forgotten, or books, or games.<br/>

<br/>
In a real-life game, you SO could&#39;ve played that and gotten a big  <br/>
laugh and then someone on your team could&#39;ve played a &quot;real&quot; one.    <br/>
The game in writing is oddly a little more serious, and it&#39;s  <br/>
different, but I&#39;m really liking it, and my kids and I have had some  <br/>
great interactions.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was walking around the house saying &quot;What&#39;s that song  <br/>
that goes &#39;Teenage wasteland, teenage wasteland&quot;&#39;?  I think it&#39;s by  <br/>
The Who or Led Zeppelin or someone I never really listened to.&quot;   <br/>
Holly didn&#39;t know.  Marty didn&#39;t know. Keith was on a conference call  <br/>
at work and couldn&#39;t help me.  Using google is cheating.  Finally  <br/>
Kirby woke up (he works a very-late shift, until 3:00 a.m.) and I  <br/>
said &quot;What&#39;s that song that goes &#39;Teenage wasteland, teenage  <br/>
wasteland&#39;?&quot; (I sang...)<br/>
<br/>
Kirby said, &quot;You mean &#39;Teenage Wasteland&#39;?&quot; and with two flicks of a  <br/>
mouse on iTunes, it started playing, and there it said &quot;The Who.&quot;  So  <br/>
I got my eight words and played it.  And I had a cute and fun few  <br/>
moments with Kirby.  And I knew that if I&#39;m ever on Jeopardy, do NOT  <br/>
pick a category that says &quot;The Who,&quot; because only one question will  <br/>
be about Tommy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I SO thought I had one today for &quot;does&quot; (or doesn&#39;t).  I was thinking <br/>
of the Sea Witch&#39;s song on The Little Mermaid where she&#39;s talking her <br/>
into signing over her life for legs, and I was thinking it said, &quot;It <br/>
doesn&#39;t cost much, just your voice&quot;.  I was in the car, going to a <br/>
doctor&#39;s appt. and couldn&#39;t do anything about it, so as soon as I got <br/>
home this evening I checked and it says &quot;It WON&#39;T cost much...&quot;.  I&#39;m <br/>
so dissappointed, and can&#39;t think of a single song for does.  Reading <br/>
the other songs played made me think I MUST have one in my head <br/>
somewhere, but I can&#39;t find it.<br/>

Lovely story. <br/>
<br/>
The name of the song on the album is actually &quot;Baba O&#39;Riley,&quot; <br/>
but &quot;Teenage Wasteland&quot; works, too!<br/>
