<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716755172">Hi Stafanie,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Roxanne and even though this is my first time to post on this loop I have been reading daily since early December.     My Husband and our 7 children (2 1/2 to 17 years old)  live in the South Bay area of California and our home is about 15 minutes from LAX international airport, so LA is where we hang.<br/>
<br/>
Not only do I have a couple other suggestion to add to the other great L.A. vacation ideas that have been posted, but I would also be very happy to help assist you all while in the Southern California area.  <br/>
<br/>
A DAY AT REDONDO BEACH BY THE PIER<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.redondopier.com/photogallery/2003/kitefestival/">http://www.redondopier.com/photogallery/2003/kitefestival/</a><br/>
Admission: Free<br/>
This would be my first choice for a must do.  (Very Californian!!!)    Playing with the kids, feeling the Pacific breeze, and the sound of the surf.   This particular beach, by the pier,  is a relatively low surf area so it is great for young kids to play in.    If you decide you want to do this, let us join you and we will bring the sand toys & shovels,  kites,  snorkeling masks, boogie boards, towels and munchies.  Just tell us what day and we will be there.<br/>
<br/>
CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER IN EXPOSITION PARK<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.casciencectr.org/">http://www.casciencectr.org/</a><br/>
Even though admission is free our family purchases an annual membership because we love going there and want to support this institution.    There are a lot of hands on science exhibits for all ages.   We never get tired of going.   Our techno boys always find lots to do.<br/>
<br/>
LOS ANGELES NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN EXPOSITION PARK<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhm.org/">http://www.nhm.org/</a><br/>
Admission: Adults $9.00   Children 5 - 12 $2.00<br/>
The Children&#39;s Discovery Center has a great insect zoo.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhm.org/education/discoverycenter/index.html">http://www.nhm.org/education/discoverycenter/index.html</a>  <br/>
And if you want to get an understanding of California History, the basement of the museum is dedicated to the history of Los Angeles, California and the United States. <br/>
   <br/>
Also, from May - August there is a live free-flying butterfly exhibit in an outdoor pavilion that is pure wonderment.    About 20+ different varieties of butterflies flutter about as you walk through this beautiful outdoor sanctuary. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhm.org/exhibitions/butterflies/slideshow.html">http://www.nhm.org/exhibitions/butterflies/slideshow.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CABRILLO MARINE AQUARIUM IN SAN PEDRO <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cabrilloaq.org/">http://www.cabrilloaq.org/</a><br/>
Admission is a donation.   <br/>
This is another place that is fun because it has a touching tide pool and other interesting displays.    Also, after exploring the museum, there is a fun playground nearby that we enjoy visiting.<br/>
<br/>
AQUARIUM OF THE PACIFIC IN LONG BEACH<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/index.html">http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/index.html</a><br/>
Adults $21.00  Children $12.00<br/>
My parents always give our family an annual pass for Christmas every year because they know how much we love going.   The multiple aquarium displays of different seas through out the world are breath taking and the Sting-ray touching pool and the shark touching pool are family favorites. <br/>
Nearby the Museum are some travel boats businesses that give 1 hour tours of the Long Beach Harbor area.<br/>
<br/>
KNOTTS BERRY FARM<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.knotts.com/">http://www.knotts.com/</a><br/>
Adults $43.00 Children $12.95  (Promotional discount ticket are available through local grocery stores periodically)<br/>
Even though we love Disneyland we also like Knotts Berry Farm Amusement Park.   It has a fun Western California Theme and it is a lot less expensive than Disneyland.   My husband&#39;s parents give our family members Annual passes for Christmas.   <br/>
<br/>
(We often receive memberships or annual passes due to the fact that we live in a small 3 bedroom house.   It is easier to organize and store cards than it is to store  lots of toys for Christmas.) <br/>
<br/>
I do hope that we are able to get together while you are in the area.   Let me know if there is anything I can do to make your stay here in Southern California a wonderful and memorable experience.<br/>

  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] what shouldn&#39;t we miss / trip to Los Angeles<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
  we (me, husband + son) are looking forward to a 17day-holiday in Los <br/>
  Angeles (and probably also Sacramento). This is my first trip to <br/>
  California (actually first trip to the US). Could anybody advice me what <br/>
  a 5yo boy who loves everything on wheels and is into technical things <br/>
  shouldn&#39;t miss? What are unschoolers&#39; favorite spots in and around LA?<br/>
<br/>
  All the best from Germany,<br/>
