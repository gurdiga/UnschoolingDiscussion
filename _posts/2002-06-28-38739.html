<div id="ygrps-yiv-384429581">Dear Unschooling friends,<br/>
I am new to this list and am going to ask a question that had probably been <br/>
asked...oh... a hundred times before.....So please forgive ahead of time and <br/>
feel free to email off list or point me to threads that pertain to this <br/>
but.....here goes.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to many things right now, new state, new friends, new to <br/>
homeschooling,  and I am interested in doing the best that I can do for my <br/>
kids(as all of you are!!).<br/>
My questions is this,  would any of you be willing to share with me what a <br/>
day of unschooling is like?  I like the little that I know about this <br/>
approach as my family is learning in every situation that we are in.  whether <br/>
it be going to the seashore, cooking in the kitchen, working in the garden or <br/>
just reading at bedtime.  and I think that we might fit with unschooling <br/>
ideals but wouldlike to know more. <br/>
I realize that there must be about as many ways to unschool as they are <br/>
unschoolers, but anyone who would like to share just a small glimpse of their <br/>
style would be so appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
Darci<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108538320">I am not knowledgeable enough to answer this thouroughly, but if I might <br/>
give it a shot, it might give you *oldies (no reference to age) a hint <br/>
at what a newbie is learning through this group.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is letting your child take up interests that are his/her <br/>
own.  Whethor it be pokemon or Knights.  Unschooling is opening the door <br/>
to learning by facilitating your childs learning  by turning their <br/>
interests into learning opertunities.<br/>
<br/>
example:  A child interested in Knights, would enjoy books on king <br/>
Arthur which might lead to an interest in the History of Great Britain. <br/>
 The History of Great Britain might lead to an interest in Royal <br/>
Families which could lead to an interest in Royals from other countries <br/>
which could lead to learning about the renaisance and the black <br/>
plague...While learning about knights the child might like to take a <br/>
fencing lesson or two, Royal Families could lead to wanting horseback <br/>
riding lessons. Learning about the renaissance could lead to learning <br/>
about the different type of Art and learning to draw / paint/ sculpt. <br/>
Learning about the black plaugue could lead to an interest in health, <br/>
disease, biology, (you know the growing the mold on the bread ... look <br/>
mom I grew penicillin lol){{and realize that many of these things would <br/>
be happening simutaneously..}}}<br/>
<br/>
My point is that as you provide a home that is filled with oppurtuniity <br/>
for learning then your child will lead him/herself to the things they <br/>
want to know.  The great thing so far that I have heard about and <br/>
gleaned from this is that unschooling your child isnt just that, because <br/>
when you are unschooling your child you yourself have to learn so many <br/>
things right along with them that you pull yourself out of the <br/>
stagnation left over from high school and begin to have a new <br/>
perspective of the world around you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well thats my thoughts late tonight on the meaning I have gleaned from <br/>
this unschooling list.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well thats my thoughts late tonight on the meaning I have gleaned from<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are very close! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is like you describe but less ... academic.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t a free-form path through what school teaches but it does<br/>
often get described that way because school is the only point of reference<br/>
for learning most of us have.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a free form path through life. :-) And the interests connect<br/>
to stuff in the real world, not just to stuff in textbooks. A factoid from<br/>
an interest that connects to a TV show is just as important as a factoid<br/>
that connects to a textbook. (In fact the references to TV shows will be<br/>
more valuable to someone who works for TV Guide than the reference into a<br/>
chemistry text ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling is opening the door<br/>
&gt; to learning by facilitating your childs learning  by turning their<br/>
&gt; interests into learning opertunities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps it&#39;s closer to say &quot;Unschooling is opening the door to learning by<br/>
facilitating your child&#39;s interests.&quot; The interests don&#39;t need turned into<br/>
learning opportunities because that implies that the child&#39;s interests are<br/>
of lesser importance than what their interests could lead to.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s more helpful in terms of learning how to help children be who they<br/>
are to appreciate how everything connects to everything rather than how<br/>
interests can connect to academics.<br/>

<br/>
But &quot;academics&quot; will both cease to exist and then appear everywhere like <br/>
mushrooms as soon as you truly stop thinking of them as &quot;academics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They shouldn&#39;t be goal OR obstacles, those topics, but just the real parts of <br/>
the world that they are.<br/>
<br/>
People died about religion in England during and after the reign of Henry <br/>
VIII.  It was &quot;Off with their Heads&quot; season.    Someone can get to that <br/>
knowledge from an interest in<br/>
knights<br/>
history of the Bible in English<br/>
printing<br/>
costume<br/>
Scotland<br/>
London<br/>
Spain/England<br/>
France<br/>
shipbuilding<br/>
Sir Walter Raleigh/New World<br/>
piracy<br/>
pearls (no small interest if you consider the Renaissance, technology...)<br/>
lace (handmade lace was big business, and there was none that was NOT <br/>
handmade)<br/>
Protestant movement in general<br/>
history of the Catholic church in general<br/>
genetics (what causes a baby to be a boy or a girl?)<br/>
English law<br/>
women&#39;s rights<br/>
The White Tower (National Geographic had a great article not long ago)<br/>
<br/>
And those interests might take a week or a year or thirty years to all tie <br/>
together.<br/>

And people can also get interested in Henry VIII from movies and end up<br/>
learning a lot about history.<br/>

I saw the movie _Anne of a Thousand Days_ at an impressionable age (12)<br/>

As has been mentioned here so often, movies can really make history<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing a better job taking brief notes about what&#39;s happening<br/>
around here.  These are my on the fly notes from Wednesday.  We were<br/>
home all day, which is unusual for homeschoolers, but not for us.  I<br/>
have one child, who is 8.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably somewhat more &quot;academic&quot; than average around here.<br/>
James had a stuffed up nose, so sitting and reading got more priority<br/>
than usual.<br/>
<br/>
June 26<br/>
Mom read two chapters from a Star Trek kids novel.  Looked briefly at<br/>
Discovery channel&#39;s internet site.  Cartoons  (Pokemon).  Played<br/>
Monopoly.  Mom read more from the Star Trek book.  James did a puzzle<br/>
search book with realistic undersea pictures.  Playing outside on the<br/>
grass.  Computer games with dad.  Watched 2 Amazing Animals videos: Apes<br/>
and Primates and Extinct Animals.  Played Mario Kart.  Watched<br/>
Enterprise (1/2) and an episode of Buffy on tape<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh I like that!<br/>
An unschooling day at our house rarely includes anything academic at <br/>
all.  It took me a long time and lot of reading on this list to come to <br/>
terms with that.  Basically my kid rides his mountain bike, builds trails <br/>
for his mountain bike, plays baseball or soccer, listens to music, <br/>
downloads music, reads magazines and web sites about biking, and lately <br/>
finds a little time for the girl he&#39;s interested in.  Doesn&#39;t look academic <br/>
at all, but when I have to find *something* academic to send the teacher of <br/>
the program he&#39;s registered with, I can always find some.<br/>
I just finished reading a cool kid&#39;s book.  It&#39;s about a 10 year old boy <br/>
whose soul is being destroyed by school until he finds a man who does <br/>
wildlife rehabilitation to take him on as an apprentice instead.  It&#39;s a <br/>
wonderful description of one kind of unschooling life.  It&#39;s called A Time <br/>
to Fly Free by Stephanie S. Tolan.  I got it from our library.<br/>
