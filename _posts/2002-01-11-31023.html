&gt;Men don&#39;t have lactating breasts...they can&#39;t produce human milk.  Yes, I do<br/>
&gt;believe that if one can&#39;t stay home, the other should, but men and women are<br/>
&gt;not interchangeable. I have had a problem with Dr. Laura&#39;s idea that &quot;mom&quot;<br/>
&gt;or &quot;dad&quot; makes no difference to the baby. It does.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Although this isn&#39;t what we did when my son was young (and that was a <br/>
whole misagosh to begin with), this is what I beleive is best for the <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
We are hard-wired and/or nurtured differently, and the sexes DO have <br/>
their differences.<br/>
<br/>
I am reminded of the recent History Channel show I saw about ancient <br/>
civilizations; it was here that I was reminded again of the theory that <br/>
women were the rulers of socities long ago and that secret was held from <br/>
them by men who managed to gain control at some point.<br/>
But thats another issue as I come back to my computer in the middle of <br/>
this thought that I wrote and I forgot why I wrote it.. oh well <br/>
&lt;&lt;smiling&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, its appears to me that women tend to be more mutable when it <br/>
comes to needs. And the person that is the glue for the family needs to <br/>
have the most flexibility.<br/>
