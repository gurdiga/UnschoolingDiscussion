<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576817118">We have had a family bed since day one...It gels with attachment parenting, wanting to remain an attached relationship during nightime hours as well. Easier for nursing, etc. My son is 2.5 (2.75 really :) and every single day of his life I have laid with him until he fell asleep, at night and for naps. This includes the night that I was in labor with dd, during my homebirth. He woke up several times that night, and each time I went to him and laid with him during my contractions... :)  The one time he called for me and I didn&#39;t respond was when I was pushing dd&#39;s head out and couldn&#39;t exactly go to him...LOL, but then he came out to witness the birth and all was fine....but i stray from the topic now...I will lay/sleep with my children until they tell me I am no longer needed. The reasoning behind attachment parenting is not that the children will be insecure if you&#39;re not around as they get older, as it might seem...it actually leads to more secure children, because they know you will always be there, so they are comfortable later on in being independent. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097301743">For us,  <br/>
 <br/>
we never slept with them at all until this year.  I had never really heard of attachment parenting until this last year.   I know, I can hear a bunch of you saying,  &quot;how?&quot;  Well, it does happen.   Especially when you don&#39;t get connected with Le Leche(sp?).  I never heard of it until my second was born and then my doctor thought I should quit so I never got to a meeting,  Can you believe that?<br/>
 <br/>
We did move into a new house this year and our bedroom is farther away from the kid&#39;s now so that might have something to do with it.<br/>
 <br/>
I think back and I don&#39;t think my son ever asked,  because I was so tired and bedtime was bedtime, he probably didn&#39;t dare, poor guy was in his own toddler bed at 19 months.  I&#39;m trying to forgive myself for these things.  <br/>
 <br/>
I do remember my daughter asking and I think I probably felt too overwhelmed and had never thought about saying yes.  That&#39;s when my depression set in.   My oldest two were 19 months apart.  <br/>
 <br/>
My mother never laid with me.   So this is very out of the ordinary for my family, (my parents and the way they raised me and my sibs).   And now all are struggling with similar issues.   Interesting huh?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365203479">You make a good point.  Now that I think about it, this probably is <br/>
my fault! lol  When my first child was born, I read all the popular, <br/>
mainstream parenting books.  One of the things that I read in some of <br/>
them was how important a bedtime routine was.  I used to start by <br/>
brushing teeth and then letting her pick out 3 books.  Then we would <br/>
sing a bunch of songs, pray together, and rock for awhile.  I was the <br/>
one who started the routine because I read somewhere that kids needed <br/>
it and I wanted to do everything right.  Now she&#39;s 9 year old and <br/>
can&#39;t go to sleepovers because I&#39;m not there to sing to her. :( <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766717668">&lt;&lt; &gt; I was just wondering if this was coming from originally the child <br/>
or the  parent.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good question!<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now that I think about it, this probably is <br/>
my fault! lol  When my first child was born, I read all the popular, <br/>
mainstream parenting books.  One of the things that I read in some of <br/>
them was how important a bedtime routine was.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Ah.  I read that stuff and thought &quot;Wait--that would train them only to be <br/>
able to go to sleep in their own bed.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
When we had kids we were doing a lot of SCA travel, and they needed to sleep <br/>
in strange houses, in tents, in vans...   But we had found even when Kirby <br/>
was little that if he was used to going to sleep where we were, he would.  <br/>
And if we didn&#39;t try to make him go to sleep when he wasn&#39;t tired, he only <br/>
slept when he was sleepy.  And that&#39;s easy for anyone of any age.<br/>
<br/>
When others asked us, when kids were little, &quot;What time do your kids go to <br/>
bed?&quot; we would say &quot;About half an hour after they go to sleep.&quot;  They would <br/>
go to sleep on a couch next to us, in one of our laps, on the floor, on some <br/>
random bed...  And we would put them in their own beds later.<br/>
<br/>
But we did and still do have friends whose kids are almost unable to sleep <br/>
anywhere but in their own beds, at the right time.  Anything out of the <br/>
routine sends them into a tizzy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For us, it was a transition from nursing to sleep to laying down with <br/>
the child to sleep. I still nurse the youngest to sleep, then I go <br/>
and lay with my son. Often he falls asleep on his own first. They <br/>
never had a crib and never slept in their own bed until they <br/>
requested it, so they never really knew any different.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>with the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; child and then they can&#39;t sit alone at all when they get older.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In our case, it came from the child, in that as infants they were <br/>
nursed to sleep, then as toddlers, then (for my oldest), he still <br/>
wants me next to him to go to sleep. But he&#39;s capable of going to <br/>
sleep on his own, without me. He often does while I&#39;m still getting <br/>
his little sister to sleep, and both of them go to sleep fine with DH <br/>
on nights that I&#39;m out late. <br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a lot of fear in our culture that kids won&#39;t outgrow <br/>
things (nursing, the family bed, etc.). Like if you lay down with <br/>
them to get them to sleep, or nurse them to sleep, they&#39;ll never be <br/>
able to go to sleep on their own. I&#39;ve never worried that my kids <br/>
would require me to come to their college dorm room to lay down with <br/>
them so they can get to sleep :-). It&#39;s a fleeting time in their life <br/>
when they want or need a parent so intensely. For some kids, they <br/>
grow into independence much sooner (my daughter, for instance, can <br/>
easily go to sleep without me at 3, my son never could do that until <br/>
almost 6) But all kids will grow into independence when they&#39;re ready <br/>
for it. They grew out of the family bed when they were ready, as well.<br/>
<br/>
And, for the record, I also sat in the back with my son in the car, <br/>
and I don&#39;t have to do that anymore either :-). He&#39;d rather sit with <br/>
his friends than with mom these days. We went to Harry Potter a <br/>
couple of weeks ago, and he didn&#39;t even sit in the same row as me. <br/>
Sheesh, such independence. I had to have my own popcorn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882878516">All of our children slept with us, or my dh or I would lie down with them, <br/>
throughout thier &quot;early&quot; childhood.   Robin is right, kids do naturally <br/>
outgrow this need.   Our full size bed has been crowded for years.   And <br/>
we&#39;ve also played musical beds a lot too.. LOL.  All of our children stopped <br/>
sleeping with us by the time they were 5 or 6  ( I mean completely stopped,, <br/>
they didnt usually sleep with us EVERY night at those ages).  Except for our <br/>
youngest, he&#39;s 7 and half and he still sleeps with us about half the time.  <br/>
He either falls asleep in our bed, or comes to our bed in the middle of the <br/>
night.   Some nights he does go to sleep in his own bed and sleep all night <br/>
in it . Some nights if it gets too crowded, we move him to his bed.  <br/>
Sometimes he stays, sometimes he dont, sometimes he sleeps on a cot beside <br/>
our bed.    Even my 11 yo  son and 13 yo daughter will crawl in bed with me <br/>
in the morning or for nap on weekends.  And my 16 yo son will sit or lie on <br/>
my bed and talk before he goes to bed.   I like the that our family is <br/>
comfortable like this.  It fosters intimacy and openness.   <br/>

from that needy place.  The more intensity they get, the sooner that time <br/>

over some &quot;teen&quot; thing.    I was not allowed to get in bed with my Mom and <br/>
Dad to sleep, ( Dads rule)  so Mom would come get in my bed and lay with me <br/>
til I fell asleep or til I &quot;felt better&quot;  She did the same thing with my 2 <br/>
younger sisters.   And, we would often pile in bed with her in the mornings <br/>
after Dad got up.  I&#39;m sure that is why I am so open to letting my kids sleep <br/>
with us or going to sleep in thier beds if they need us.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup. Until Rain was 4 or 5, she needed me to be physically lying next to<br/>
her to fall asleep (with my back to her and her hand full of my hair).<br/>
She was 7 or 8 before she felt comofortable sleeping away from me. The<br/>
upside was that she could fall asleep anywhere if I was there. Now she<br/>
falls asleep anywhere, goes on camping trips and sets up her own tent and<br/>
sleeps there, spends the night with lots of different people... it;s just<br/>
not an issue (although I think she still prefers to have someone near by,<br/>
or a cat, or Nana the wonderdog).<br/>

able to go to sleep in their own bed.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like my first born. Always went home for naptime and such and she <br/>
never was able to sleep anywhere but her crib and bed. Not in the stroller <br/>
or car seat or anywhere but home. She&#39;s almost 17 now and although she goes <br/>
away for as long as a week, she hates to sleep anywhere but her bed. She can <br/>
handle a few days, but the week was terrbiley long for her. She always <br/>
preferred to have friends over here overnight than the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
When she was younger, at home she would also wake at the slightest sound. I <br/>
kept everything so quiet, she needed it like that. Thankfully she&#39;s not like <br/>
that now. I guess 3 kids that followed her helped. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With my 2nd child, when he would fall asleep, I&#39;d lay him in his stroller <br/>
and wheel him all over the house with me and the noise and the dogs. Did <br/>
that with the next two also. Big difference in them and my oldest.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My mother never laid with me<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That brought back some memories for me..  I remember my Mom getting into my <br/>
bed when I was as old as 15.. I was scared for some reason, or maybe just sad <br/>
over some &quot;teen&quot; thing.    I was not allowed to get in bed with my Mom and <br/>
Dad to sleep, ( Dads rule)  so Mom would come get in my bed and lay with me <br/>
til I fell asleep or til I &quot;felt better&quot;  She did the same thing with my 2 <br/>
younger sisters.   And, we would often pile in bed with her in the mornings <br/>
after Dad got up.  I&#39;m sure that is why I am so open to letting my kids sleep <br/>
with us or going to sleep in thier beds if they need us.  <br/>

away from their kids!  It was up the stairs, through a huge long living room <br/>
and around the corner from where my brother and I, the youngest two, slept.  <br/>
We moved downstairs at 4 and 5.  I cannot imagine sleeping more than a room <br/>
away from my two at that age!  I remember when my brother ruptured and ear <br/>
drum when we were about 12, I had to go up there and open the big, thick <br/>
double doors to yell that he was in pain.  And he was SCREAMING his head off.<br/>
<br/>
We slept with our two from about 3 weeks.  I had been getting up to nurse my <br/>
oldest and would fall asleep in the rocking chair.  We all were happier in <br/>
the bed.  And then my daughter came along a mere 53 weeks after he was born <br/>
and we four slept in the bed.  Now, with my healing ankle (aren&#39;t you sick of <br/>
hearing about it???), it&#39;s torture for them to sleep on mats on the floor.  <br/>
And it breaks my heart.  We rotate beds and rooms and such, but every one <br/>
wants to be with me.<br/>

arms, and neither would they &quot;comfort themselves.&quot;   They also would only <br/>
sleep if worn or while cuddled next to me and nursing.  I still sleep with <br/>
them (they are 5.5 and 2.5).  They have fallen asleep anywhere I am....either <br/>
held or in the sling.  They will now fall asleep without me present (watching <br/>
a video or with dad), but still desire that I sleep with them....especially <br/>
convenient since littlest one still nurses through the night. Bedtime is <br/>
usually 11 or 12....works for us.   We have friends from India who co-sleep <br/>
with their children (7 and 2)...seems, from what I understand, this is the <br/>
cultural norm for them.  <br/>

 My 10 year old needs to be home to sleep.. but goes to sleep overs all the time. Rarely do they actually sleep until the middle of the night anyway. Soooo when everyone is starting to laydown to sleep, he calls me and I pick him up. He friends all know that he would rather sleep at home and are fine with it. He still gets to go and have fun. Not a big deal. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635008443">** My mother never laid with me.   So this is very out of the ordinary<br/>
for my family, (my parents and the way<br/>
they raised me and my sibs). **<br/>
<br/>
Same here.  And in fact, my dad advised me &quot;For God&#39;s sake, don&#39;t let<br/>
him sleep with you&quot; when my son was a baby.<br/>
<br/>
However, my mom told me that she used to wake up in the morning and find<br/>
my brother asleep leaning up against her locked bedroom door.  That gave<br/>
me a big shot of empathy for my brother and helped me realize that<br/>
children want and need their parents at night.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was an infant, he screamed very loudly and continuously if I<br/>
tried to lay him down on a bed while he was still awake.  And within a<br/>
few seconds, the loud screaming got even louder.  I don&#39;t think I ever<br/>
tried it for more than a minute or two.  I think he was making it clear<br/>
he didn&#39;t want to be alone.  So I would claim that having a family bed<br/>
was his idea.<br/>

We slept with our two from about 3 weeks.  I had been getting up to<br/>
nurse my oldest and would fall asleep in the rocking chair.  We all were<br/>
happier in the bed.  And then my daughter came along a mere 53 weeks<br/>
after he was born and we four slept in the bed.  Now, with my healing<br/>
ankle (aren&#39;t you sick of hearing about it???), it&#39;s torture for them to<br/>
sleep on mats on the floor.  And it breaks my heart.  We rotate beds and<br/>
rooms and such, but every one wants to be with me.<br/>

Hi, Elizabeth --<br/>
<br/>
Well, some of us, back in high school, yearned to be popular, and now we<br/>
ARE!!!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
(I suppose NONE of us ever yearned for a broken ankle.  Hope you feel<br/>
better soon.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-822883525">I must admit that the idea that the desire to sleep as a family is <br/>
born from the parents instead of from the children seems odd to me.  <br/>
When my son was born he slept with me.  It is shown to lower the <br/>
risk of SIDS.  In most societies the family bed is the norm.*  And <br/>
the whole Ferberizing thing which was coming massively into vogue <br/>
during my pregnancy just kept me thinking about the fact that human <br/>
children who were left alone as infants in pre-historical and <br/>
historical times died due to being preyed upon or freezing to death. <br/>
So, children and their parents should have an evolved response to <br/>
stick together.  I suppose that it is perfectly logical for it to be <br/>
a parental decision.  In the end the real reason why I slept with <br/>
Simon as an infant and still do now (he is 5) is because I&#39;m lazy.  <br/>
I didn&#39;t want to get out of bed and go get him out of his crib.  I <br/>
wanted to be able to roll over and nurse him.  <br/>
<br/>
The question also made me think about nursing.  If I had chosen not <br/>
to nurse my children they would never have asked for it.  They <br/>
wouldn&#39;t now say &quot;Hey, I&#39;d like to breastfeed.&quot;  They wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
that it was on offer.  <br/>

*As a footnote, I was thinking that the British, American and some <br/>
European countries eschewing of the family bed is probably due to <br/>
the wealthy wanting to have more children and handing off their <br/>
children to wet-nurses in order to increase their family numbers <br/>
(brings up pictures of Angels and Insects).  Just a thought.</div>

Hi, Schuyler !<br/>
<br/>
There was a time, when influenza and various fevers were going around and <br/>
people had figured out what caused it (air-borne contagion), that it became <br/>
good parenting and good practice for people not to sleep where they breathed <br/>
each other&#39;s breath.   Late 1800&#39;s, I think, lots of parenting advice and <br/>
health advice was for people to sleep with a window open and ALONE.<br/>
<br/>
As things do, it developed other baggage and justification.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly. And in my opinion, for the most part, those children who would <br/>
probably be better off by doing, aren&#39;t really hurt by not doing IF they get <br/>
nurturing and love from many other aspects in their parents lives.<br/>
<br/>
Saying so because not any of my children have ever asked to sleep with us or <br/>
have done so, except for maybe a night of restlessness when they were still <br/>
young enough to nurse and even at that, I&#39;m talking like maybe 3-4 hours at <br/>
the most. And I honestly don&#39;t believe that they were hurt by the lack of <br/>
that. I never slept with my parents either and although mistakes were made <br/>
in other aspects of them parenting me, I don&#39;t believe sleeping with them or <br/>
even nursing had anything to do with how I developed as a person <br/>
emotionally.<br/>

therapy, went out and drove to it alone, rode and exercise bike.  Lots of fun <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
But my poor three year old daughter, who has never ever had a moments <br/>
separation anxiety, cried her eyes out when I left.  She didn&#39;t want to be <br/>
left with the nanny alone.  Today was the last day for the nanny brigade, <br/>
too.  I can go back to taking care of my own kids and my own house.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking, makes me feel special. ;)<br/>
