<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581559522">The 12 yr old boy in this book would benefit greatly from unschooling.  He<br/>
gets bullied by classmates because he breaks out in song at &quot;inappropriate&quot;<br/>
times.  He loves to read, he&#39;s not up on pop culture and he looks different<br/>
(not cool).  The author, a former school teacher describes British schools as<br/>
smelling of disinfectant.  He doesn&#39;t seem keen on the traditional school<br/>
system.  They made a movie from this book starring Hugh Grant.  I can&#39;t wait<br/>
to see it.  I think he&#39;s perfect casting as the irresponsible playboy.  He&#39;s<br/>
honest despite himself.  I&#39;m only half-way through but I recommend it, it&#39;s<br/>
very funny.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-812613482">Quite interesting -- the movie talks about him wanting to be homeschooled, but knowing that he can&#39;t be because his single mom just couldn&#39;t afford to.  I really liked the movie, but my friends reminded me that I, too, love to read, look uncool, and burst in to song at inappropriate moments.....   Debi<br/>
