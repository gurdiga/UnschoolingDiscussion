&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re in a naturally humid and wet place, maybe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re in a dry place, tomatoes need a lot of water.<br/>

Hey everyone!!<br/>
I&#39;m in the high desert of So Cal, very dry, rock country. Our weather is <br/>
always extreme, because my home is also near the base of a mountain, also. So hot <br/>
is extremely hot, cold is extremely cold, and winds are horrendous when they <br/>
come. Funny we talked about tomoatoes today in this thread, because said uncle, <br/>
&quot;the gardener&quot; in my earlier post, came by with tomatoes both big and cherry, <br/>
and some funky little yellow ones too, and three perfect looking zucchini.<br/>
<br/>
Since I am on this new quest for fresh foods...can anyone tell me why I am <br/>
getting nats so badly in my kitchen, even though I wash my fresh fruits and <br/>
veggies the moments I get home? They gross me out, but I don&#39;t have room in the <br/>
fridge, but if I did would that make a difference?<br/>
<br/>
TIA!!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Anyway after posting this I decided to google why and where gnats comes from <br/>
and clicked on this link:<br/>
<br/>
http//www.mountainwings.com/past/3093.htm<br/>
<br/>
It was very synchronistic considering the last week or so of all the lists <br/>
discussions. So I thought some of you might want to read it. I never thought <br/>
gnats could have a profound meaning until just now.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who still doesn&#39;t like gnats<br/>
