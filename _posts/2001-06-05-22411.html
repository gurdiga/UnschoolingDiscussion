<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472333402">My standard is that computers must be in the main area of the house.  DS is<br/>
very good about not intentionally going to sites I consider inappropriate.<br/>
Even with that, we have had the experience of his chatting with his cousins<br/>
(both families hold similar values) and I just &#39;happened&#39; to walk by as the<br/>
cousin was taking DS to a site that is off limits.  I was able to redirect<br/>
the activity before DS was exposed to what would have been some pretty nasty<br/>
stuff.  This reinforced the standard for our family and I&#39;ve never given it<br/>
another thought.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be very willing to set up a separate computer station for DS if/when he<br/>
gets a computer of his own, but it will be in the main area of the house.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion, FWIW,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045546838">first off, only you know your daughter&#39;s responsibility and maturity level. You did not mention her age. Have you observed her with her online activities recently? we presently have one computer and it is in my bedroom. My oldest two have been bugging to get a computer in their rooms. I don&#39;t feel comfortable with them having internet access uncontrolled at this time because we have already had a few situations of inappropriate usage. (phone # given out, sexual talk coming from a 11 yo). Before you do, maybe a discussion about what is expected and acceptable would be in order.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459761697">I guess I should explain myself a bit further. I do not have a problem with <br/>
anything my daughter may be &quot;exposed&quot; to on the internet.  We have had many <br/>
good discussions about all the types of things and people on the internet, <br/>
and I trust her judgement completely. More importantly, she trusts herself <br/>
and knows I trust her to do what is right for her. I don&#39;t consider things of <br/>
a sexual nature to be inappropriate and the issues I have are nothing to do <br/>
with that. My problem with the computer in her room is that she spends a good <br/>
deal of time on it, and I am fine with that, but with the amount of time she <br/>
spends on it, she would be away from us for a good part of the day, and one <br/>
of the things I like is that as she does her research or whatever on the <br/>
computer, we have talks about various things. There is a lot of interaction <br/>
that goes on while she is on the computer that I don&#39;t want to let go of. I <br/>
know she enjoys it too, and has admitted to me that it is primarily a thing <br/>
of her friends have the computers in their rooms kind of thinking. <br/>
<br/>
I also have said that I won&#39;t have a computer in my own bedroom for the same <br/>
reason, so I am not asking her to do anything that I would not do. I just <br/>
don&#39;t believe in that. However, the issue I wrestle with is that if I am <br/>
really for her making her own choices regarding her life, isn&#39;t this one of <br/>
them? Perhaps I am being hyprocritical by stepping in regarding this issue <br/>
and imposing my own set of rules that she has not been allowed to partake in <br/>
the making of such rules. Food for thought. I know its something that she and <br/>
I have to come to a decision on, but reading how others who think outside the <br/>
box handle this may help me to come to greater clarity.<br/>

enjoys the interaction and does not *really*  want to be isolated but has a<br/>
difficult time explaining that to her friends.   *I* would try to talk to her<br/>
about it for further input.<br/>
    Since you do trust her judgment completely,  maybe when it gets to the point<br/>
that your family has more than one working computer.....she can have one in her<br/>
room but still use the family room one  during the typical interaction<br/>
hours---having the best of all worlds.<br/>

your family rules of living together without commiting homicide are,<br/>
it&#39;s hard to comment.  I would like to applaud your stance on trusting<br/>
your kid on the internet. Brava! In our house we have one tv - and the<br/>
playstation is hooked to that, so the kidlets have to share. The little<br/>
one is here m-f from 6- 6 basically, so the 5 year old has to give HER<br/>
time to watch *gasp* barney. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s a summer thing, not true<br/>
love. Anyway, we have family time. Doesn&#39;t mean you have to DO anything,<br/>
just be offline and off the games. Perhaps if your daughter is willing<br/>
to concede that family tme is important to her (and it sounds like she<br/>
has), she can make special times to be offline or, if online, on the<br/>
family &#39;puter.<br/>

will be crowded in our dining area (that has never had a dining table :) ), <br/>
that&#39;s where the 2nd one will go.  <br/>
<br/>
I know it seems cruel and unreasonable and the kids will have to learn to <br/>
actually work on the PCs sitting next to each other and their lives are <br/>
harsh, but that&#39;s too bad.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes, just occasionally, the kids actually do have questions for me. <br/>
 They can&#39;t do it all on their own yet.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366091382">&lt;&lt; I have always held the position of no <br/>
computers in our personal rooms as I feel it is very isolating. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s her own computer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a drag that the baby deleted the hard drive, but commandeering someone <br/>
else&#39;s personal gift strikes chords in me personally (since you asked) of my <br/>
parents (mom) taking stuff that&#39;s given to one person and &quot;making them share&quot; <br/>
to the point that they have nothing, and nothing special even in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
Isolation is also called privacy and peace and quiet.  Some people need <br/>
isolation more than others.  I&#39;m not crazy about it myself, but my husband <br/>
is.  One of our kids needs alone time.  The others, not so much.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; one <br/>
of the things I like is that as she does her research or whatever on the <br/>

that goes on while she is on the computer that I don&#39;t want to let go of. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My guess is she&#39;ll come out, ask you a question, you&#39;ll go in there, and <br/>
discuss it.<br/>
At least that&#39;s how my kids are with things.  When we had a little house you <br/>
could hear someone yell from anywhere, and the yelling was often &quot;HEY!  This <br/>
is COOL!&quot; or &quot;COME LOOK!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now the house is bigger and people get exercise finding witnesses to <br/>
something cool.  But it happens regularly.<br/>

<time> 5 Jun 2001, at  7:22am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885556579">We have two internet-hooked up computers, one in what used to be the dining <br/>
room (living room has become dining room, as we have two other couch-sitting <br/>
rooms, the library and the den), so that&#39;s basically in the kitchen, and one <br/>
in my office, which is very near there (close enough to talk).<br/>
<br/>
Kids have TVs and video games (the boys do) in their rooms.  If they got <br/>
their own computers we&#39;d let them have them in their rooms.  <br/>
<br/>
As it is, they stay up late and are online after we go to bed.  So it doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter that the computers aren&#39;t in their own rooms, they still have privacy. <br/>
 I know each has looked at a bit of nasty sci-fi fan art (I mean of a sexual <br/>
nature, which I think most readers here are considering &quot;nasty&quot;).  Someone <br/>
one night looked at porn sites.  They didn&#39;t keep on doing it (or they <br/>
learned to clean the trail of what shows as last sites visited, although I <br/>
don&#39;t check up on them and only noticed those in passing).  I know enough of <br/>
what they ARE doing online that I&#39;m not worried about a little exploration, <br/>
and they stay home a lot which is healthy.  If they really wanted to be <br/>
seeing dirty pictures, they could do so at their other teen friends&#39; houses <br/>
I&#39;m sure, or out in the community one way or another.  But they&#39;re home.   <br/>
<br/>
I found a Cosmopolitan magazine in Kirby&#39;s bathroom.  I had bought it myself, <br/>
I forget why now.  Now it&#39;s in the cabinet in a boy&#39;s bathroom.  I left it <br/>
there and didn&#39;t tease him or shame him about it, just left the toilet paper <br/>
I was delivering and didn&#39;t make a big deal.  Usually we get kids to deliver <br/>
toilet paper to the bathrooms, but that one day I did it myself.<br/>
<br/>
People have different priorities and fears.  My boys are 14 and 12.  I would <br/>
buy them Hustler magazines myself before I would try to shelter them totally <br/>
from any awareness that such things exist.  Maybe I should do that anyway.  <br/>
Probably there is no greater deterrent or sexual turn-off than &quot;My mom told <br/>
me to look at this.&quot;  Eyew.  Maybe a unit study on the evil realities of <br/>
pornography.   If they learned to associate porn with their aging mom that <br/>
might put them off sex for life, though, and their future wives wouldn&#39;t <br/>
appreciate that.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t personally associate the internet with frightening evil, but I know <br/>
some people do.  I&#39;ve seen my kids use it all kinds of bright, useful, <br/>
sensible ways they can share with their mom and little sister.  They&#39;re <br/>
honest kids who think.  It&#39;s no more dangerous than other situations, and <br/>
less so since they&#39;re safe at home.<br/>
<br/>
My idiot fetal-alcohol-syndrome half brother, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t like <br/>
computers at all but got his Mormon teen girlfriend (some years ago) in a <br/>
compromising situation, having been photographed nude (and maybe with him, <br/>
which is too gross for me to think much about) by a scuzzy <br/>
illegal-snake-importing drug dealer and then being threatened with the <br/>
release of the photos.  He would have been WAY better off on the internet in <br/>
some isolated bedroom somewhere.  They were briefly married, until he stole a <br/>
truck and some money from her relatives.  Now he has a girlfriend who&#39;s a <br/>
talented Indian artist.  Oh.  She&#39;s in jail for a knife fight with her <br/>
brother.  Oh, brothers.<br/>
<br/>
My magical safety on my kids is keeping them away from their uncle!  <br/>

<br/>
Can she use the computer in the main part of the house but put some kind of<br/>

<br/>
Can she use the computer in her room, but you require her to keep the door<br/>
open so you can interact a bit?<br/>
<br/>
Can you put the computer on some kind of cart with wheels and relocate it<br/>
every so often?<br/>
<br/>
Or move the computer to the bedroom and agree on a limit for how much time<br/>
will be spent using it in isolation?<br/>
<br/>
I realize none of these is perfect for your situation, but maybe it will<br/>
help you think of other possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
We have all the family&#39;s computers in the spare bedroom right now.  (Only 1<br/>
kid, thus extra space.)  When we move soon, we&#39;re thinking about having the<br/>
computers in a dining room or den space that is very close to the kitchen,<br/>
in the hopes that we can interact more when computers are in use.  BUT,<br/>
staring at the screen really seems to slow down my husband&#39;s speech<br/>
centers.  I find it aggravating to wait so long for a response.  So, I<br/>
really don&#39;t have all the answers.<br/>

My problem with my ds having his computer in his room is the isolation thing. <br/>
 But, maybe you could try this.  Let her have it in her room to chat and such <br/>
for a certain amount of time per day.  Her research could still be done on <br/>
the puter in the part of the house where she would be around others.  That <br/>
way she would get a little of what she wants and you would not be &quot;deprived <br/>
of her company&quot; that&#39;s how I explained it to my ds.  So, we do schooling type <br/>
things in here, he can do his role play and chat in his room.  Just my two <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035323009">Ok. My .02.<br/>
<br/>
On the issue of isolation, I can relate because it was my husband who <br/>
isolated himself in his office nightly. Was he looking at porn? No. <br/>
He was working on his internet shopping mall.  But once my dd and I <br/>
told him that we missed his &#39;just being in the same room&#39; with us, he <br/>
moved it into the family. So now he sits and works on his computer <br/>

Yes, we talk to our children about those dangers. And you hope that <br/>
they will remember and will have listened. But kids still get caught <br/>
in that trap. So if viewing porn is not a problem for you, maybe this <br/>
type of danger would be.  <br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, it&#39;s a fortunate family that can have more than one internet <br/>
access. So even if the computer is not considered a family item, I <br/>
would think the internet access would be.<br/>
<br/>
For these three reasons, my dd will never have a computer in her room <br/>
that has internet access. <br/>

Usually the word &#39;never&#39; is used to show great conviction in the  <br/>
belief that your stating.  Such as I will &#39;never&#39; vote for Bush <br/>
(People who know me would bet on that to be true.) Or I will never do <br/>
this or that.  However, there are things that I feel so strongly <br/>
about that could probably be connected to the word &#39;never&#39; and <br/>
putting a computer (with internet access) in a child&#39;s room is about <br/>
on the level (IMO) of my saying I will &#39;never&#39; purposely run someone <br/>
down with my car. Could there come a time when that could possibly <br/>
happen?  The odds are so astronomically set against that ever <br/>
happening that it&#39;s safe to say &#39;never&#39;. Call it shortsighted if you <br/>
like, but some people feel strongly enough about their beliefs to say <br/>
the word &#39;never&#39; and mean it. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Is your sorry brother really FAS or was that just a sibling epithet? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My mother was drunk when he was conceived, didn&#39;t know she was pregnant until <br/>
she was five months along, drank throughout, was out drinking and dancing <br/>
(with my generous and concerned pre-med boyfriend, who had gone to take care <br/>
of her nine-month-pregnant self and drive her home, because she was going to <br/>
go one way or another) the night she went into labor.  <br/>
<br/>
I had custody of him twice when he was growing up, when he was 4 and 5, and <br/>
again when he was 13, 14.  No conscience.  Inability to process information <br/>
in any useful way.<br/>
<br/>
Sad and frustrating.  Drinks a lot himself.  His dad was a truckdriver, <br/>
diabetic, died of drinking on top of diabetes, when my brother was four or <br/>
so.  Just glad he didn&#39;t die while driving that big truck.<br/>
<br/>
My dad wasn&#39;t an alcoholic.  My mom wasn&#39;t drinking fulltime until I was <br/>
mid-teens.  I am not alcoholic.   My only full sibling (sister) is, but <br/>
abstains.<br/>
<br/>
I risked my marriage to take care of him when it shouldn&#39;t really have been <br/>
my problem.  My mom should have used birth control, should have been more <br/>
responsible all along the way, he lied to us, stole from us, compromised the <br/>
safety of our home (while I had baby Kirby),  and still I helped emotionally <br/>
and financially for years.  I have quit doing it and won&#39;t do it anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t just sibling epithet.  (the short answer, too late now! &lt;g&gt;)  I&#39;m <br/>
more grumpy with my mom for providing me with the unhappy option of <br/>
dedicating my life to cleaning up after her, or choosing to break off <br/>
relationships with blood relatives.  Neither much fun.  She has a disease, <br/>
too, and I have had much sympathy over the years.   But I want my children to <br/>
be able to live without knowing firsthand how it can be when a drunk gets <br/>
home at 2:30 and starts yelling and throwing stuff around and accidently <br/>
setting something on fire, etc....<br/>

  I do understand the points that people are trying to make on this issue, <br/>
but I really feel the need to add a different perspective to this. I agree <br/>
that &quot;kids will be kids&quot;, but I also feel that it is my duty, as a parent, to <br/>
point out the &quot;sex sells&quot; attitude in this country, and that sexual <br/>
exploitation and deviance is rampant. I could let them form there own <br/>
opinions on this issue, or on the issue of drugs, or any other societal <br/>
issue, without ever sharing my views, but I want us to share our views, as a <br/>
family. I also feel that a parent has a right to decide what is in the home, <br/>
and if they don&#39;t want porno, or sexually exploitive materials  in their <br/>
lives , they should have the right to make that rule. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781863854">Sandra and Sharon, the situation I was referring to that started this thread was an eleven year old girl (who just turned eleven by the way), not a teenager first of all, and my niece in my temporary custody to boot. She was forbidden to be on chat rooms by her mother before she came to stay with us for the year, lied to me, saying her mom had allowed her to. When her mom confronted her with the situation she was told no chatting until an appropriate chat room was found by her mom or me. She was going into chat rooms using my 16 yo daughter&#39;s identity, using sexual language and giving out personal information over the internet. I don&#39;t need a wacko stalking my family and she was not using common sense. are you recommending in a situation such as this, I should just let her continue? In our family evidence of maturity and responsibility are indicators for privileges given. Internet access is a privilege, not a right.<br/>

child is informed enough to make a wise decision regarding pornography on<br/>
the internet.  It is so easy to be swayed be smooth-typing,praise-giving<br/>
perverts.  I believe it is the parents responsibility to determine the<br/>
appropriateness of certain websites.  You wouldn&#39;t allow your child to drink<br/>
themselves silly just to show them the drunkness is not a good thing.  Would<br/>
you?  How would you respond to the police if your child&#39;s unsupervised<br/>
activity resulted in their death?  Won&#39;t happen on the internet?  Haven&#39;t<br/>
you heard of stalkers, child pornographers and others getting information<br/>
from innocent children.<br/>
I can understand if your children are 20-27. They should be free to do that<br/>
in their own home.  I thought we were discussing children that reside in<br/>
their parents home and were under their parents direct supervision.  <br/>

&gt;  Sandra and Sharon, the situation I was referring to that started this<br/>
thread was an eleven year old girl (who just turned eleven by the way), not<br/>
a teenager first of all, and my niece in my temporary custody to boot. She<br/>
was forbidden to be on chat rooms by her mother before she came to stay with<br/>
us for the year, lied to me, saying her mom had allowed her to. When her mom<br/>
confronted her with the situation she was told no chatting until an<br/>
appropriate chat room was found by her mom or me. She was going into chat<br/>
rooms using my 16 yo daughter&#39;s identity, using sexual language and giving<br/>
out personal information over the internet. I don&#39;t need a wacko stalking my<br/>
family and she was not using common sense. are you recommending in a<br/>
situation such as this, I should just let her continue? In our family<br/>
evidence of maturity and responsibility are indicators for privileges given.<br/>
Internet access is a privilege, not a right.<br/>

&gt;    Dear Sandra........you are priceless!!!   My older boys are 27, 25, and<br/>
20........and my sister (ward) is 40. You are doing just fine in the to<br/>
censor or not to censor department.  And you have so much good advice.<br/>
&gt;    My rule of thumb for teens is if can&#39;t enforce it  don&#39;t forbid &gt;  <br/>
I agree with Johanna.  Internet access is a priviledge, not a right.  Just<br/>
curious to know what else you don&#39;t forbid because you can&#39;t enforce it.<br/>

<br/>
Since we freely gave our best advice in a hypothetical situation in which <br/>
only partial information was given, I (probably naively and unfairly) think <br/>
we should be thanked, not criticized.  <br/>
<br/>
I do believe (being hypothetical and general again) that whatever problems a <br/>
girl has experienced to have this change of household, and whatever beliefs <br/>
her mother has and expresses might have more to do with her activities, <br/>
beliefs and habits than would the existence of the internet or the location <br/>
of a computer within a home.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Internet access is a privilege, not a right.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So is life, so is a place to live, so is the regard of others.  There will be <br/>
people to define anything as a privilege-not-a-right.  That cutoff point is <br/>
not a constant in the universe.<br/>
<br/>
Mental health wasn&#39;t even a concept a hundred years ago.  Eating was <br/>
considered a privilege, not a right.  Privacy seemed to be considered <br/>
NOBODY&#39;s right except perhaps that of a landed male person who had a library <br/>
that couldn&#39;t be entered, but women, children and servants had no right to <br/>
privacy.<br/>
<br/>
There are families now, today, who consider children have no right to <br/>
privacy.  Hands outside the covers.  No private papers, e-mail or phone <br/>
conversations.<br/>
<br/>
Rights or privilege?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a *huge* philosophical issue, bigger than the internet itself.<br/>

<br/>
I doubt that there is any family here whose children form their own opinions <br/>
without a clue as to their parents beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
When a parent makes a concrete-wall issue out of something to the point that <br/>
a child can&#39;t have a computer in her room because of -*IT*- then whatever <br/>

I CAN enforce limited internet access if I feel it is needed (such as a child throwing out challenges to the unkown. And you?) I CAN unplug the computer if nobody is willing to shut it down.  If the room where it is in inasseccible I can FLIP THE CIRCUT BREAKER.  I have done it.  Loose programs.  Oh well.  I  have even ruined recording sessions  with my older sons when they were younger.  I have forbidden their friends and girlfriends from engagning in certain behaviors.probably not the ones you are thinking of (they are now married.......for 7 years). The girl&#39;s physcologist told her I had no right to forbid what I did.....but I did. I&#39;m like Mammy Yokum  when &quot;I has spoken!&quot; I has spoken.  I do say NO, ENOUGH, NO MORE, and I&#39;VE HAD IT, and I ABSOLUTELY mean it when I do. It is easy for any kids near me to know what I find acceptable (my husband, on the other hand, can&#39;t figure it out).<br/>
The 11 year old girl will outgrow her yucky attitude if she survives long enough........... and if you do.If you have faith in her essential goodness, she&#39;ll become aware of it too.  Perhaps she secretly idolizes you 16 year old daughter (hence the use of her id?).Perhaps she will also &quot;TRY ON&quot; some of your daughter&#39;s other behaviors? How much is your daughter willing to &quot;take her under her wing&quot;?<br/>
Goodness, but you do have your hands full!  When I took custody of my 11 year old sister (yes, I went to court and TOOK her).  She was in the habit of climbing out of windows at night to go to bars and such.  I caught her the first time she tried it with me......that&#39;s how I found out.....What a royal %^%&$ !! I still can&#39;t bear to repeat some of the ugly, mean spirted, hurtfull things she said to me over the years.  I STILL have to remind myself where that was really comming from. (Her pain) She is beautiful inside and out now.  And a mother of three young adults (?)herself. She does know all the tricks!!  And she doesn&#39;t say hurtfull things to anybody, now.  I, on the other hand, am less gracious.<br/>
Have faith in the girl...sounds like she really really needs you. Don&#39;t be afraid to be the grown up.  If a child refuses to be reasonable... don&#39;t reason.  Shut the show down. There are other things in the world besides computers.  Let &#39;em know why........and that you CAN enforce it. And you&#39;ll probably WILL have to prove it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-578759969">Thanks Sharon. Right now she only uses the computer to write her mother. My daughter has very much taken her under her wing. My niece&#39;s problem is she refuses to accept she is 11, not 16. Sometimes I do find it hard being the &quot;meanie&quot;, but I figure they&#39;ll thank me someday. <br/>
