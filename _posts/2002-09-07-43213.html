 </span></blockquote>I have a story where JUST that happened!<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend---Ok, I&#39;m between generations, the parents are good friends <br/>
and the kids are good friends---whose dad took her out to learn to drive. She <br/>
was so excited---her first time in the car. She sat in the driver&#39;s seat, and <br/>
her dad sat in the passenger seat. She got ready to put the key into the <br/>
ignition; her father stopped her. They had a two hour discussion of how the <br/>
engine works---pistons and fuel injection and brakes ---EVERYTHING. Then he <br/>
took the keys from her and got out of the car!<br/>
<br/>
The following weekend she and I were going to a dog show together (usually we <br/>
all went---both of her parents, Sosanna, her sister, and I). I got in the <br/>
passenger seat and gave her the keys. She drove all the way there and home <br/>
(scared stiff!) But by the time we got home, she was fine. Her parents <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe I&#39;d let a brand new driver behind the wheel of my brand new <br/>
car. <br/>
<br/>
How else would she learn? From more of her dad&#39;s &quot;lessons&quot;???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882254614">I have a story that is just the opposite.  I only gave one driving <br/>
lesson in my life and it was to a twenty-something woman from a small <br/>
town in Africa where women just didn&#39;t drive.  Her boyfriend asked me <br/>
to take her out and teach her.  I told her nothing--assuming she knew <br/>
the basics.  We went out to a long straight country road and as we <br/>
were driving she was crossing the line into the other lane.  Let me <br/>
tell, I was nervous.  But not nearly as nervous as when she asked me <br/>
after a few minutes how to stop the car!! LOL<br/>
