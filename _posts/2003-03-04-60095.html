<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 4 Mar 2003, at  9:43pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174295852">My two oldest kids are very competitive.  As a result (I *think*), the oldest one (boy) is constantly antagonigzing the middle one (girl).  He is 3 1/2 years older than she is.<br/>
<br/>
Many times he will just pick at her for no reason and it appears very compulsive to me.  It includes hitting, poking, pinching, kicking, snapping with rubber bands, etc.  Once he refused to get out of the doorway of her room, even after she told him to leave several times.  She finally slammed the door and it got his fingers.  He carried on as if he had no responsibility in it.  And many times if she is discussing something with me (that doesn&#39;t even concern him), he butts in from another room and mocks her.<br/>
<br/>
For the moment, I have him in his room until he can be with us without antagonizing or stalking her.  He thinks I&#39;m being unfair.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One thing that sometimes works here is that if one of the kids is <br/>
pestering the other, I&#39;ll say &quot;It sounds like you really want your <br/>
brother&#39;s attention. You can tell him &#39;I want your attention&#39; or &#39;I <br/>
want to play with you&#39;&quot;. I think sometimes they (and often we, as <br/>
adults) do things to get other people&#39;s attention, without <br/>
neecessarily being aware that we&#39;re doing so, so it can help to hear <br/>
that there&#39;s another way to go about it.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, sometimes it seems that they&#39;re both enjoying just pestering <br/>
the heck out of each other. If no one is in imminent danger of death <br/>
or dismemberment, I might choose not to say anything. Unless of <br/>
course the noise level is getting beyond my threshold as well.<br/>
<br/>
I think with this, as with so many parenting issues, there&#39;s <br/>
no &quot;quick fix&quot;. We can model polite interactions with others (and <br/>
that&#39;s the hard one, isn&#39;t it - of course we never bicker with our <br/>
spouses, right? :-), and we can help them learn other ways of <br/>
communicating, and most likely over time they will change their <br/>
methods of interaction. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it really is because of the reaction he gets, you might help your<br/>
daughter figure out some possible different reactions, maybe something funny<br/>
or surprising, that would change the mood.  My son got his grandma to stop<br/>
nagging and nattering at him by putting his finger to his lips in a very<br/>
exagerated way and saying &quot;shhhhh&quot;.  It totally threw her off her stride,<br/>
made her laugh, and she stopped doing it after a few times.<br/>
