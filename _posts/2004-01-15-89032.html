<div id="ygrps-yiv-933268328">Many thanks to each of you on this list who responded to my Introduction.<br/>
<br/>
You have given me many thoughts and ideas to guide me along the path to<br/>
&quot;deschooling&quot; and &quot;unschooling&quot;.  I have followed the links presented and<br/>
have printed out some of them to read and re-read.<br/>
<br/>
I am certain you will see more of me here!<br/>
<br/>
Just a wee report.........Since I have decided to &#39;deschool/unschool&#39; with<br/>
Kristopher, things around our house have gotten way more relaxed.  I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed he is much happier.  He is already showing us that he will pursue<br/>
what interests him.  I know he has already learned things that I would not<br/>
have &#39;taught&#39; him for some months yet!!  From the library, he brought home<br/>
a book about electricity, found an experiment he wanted to try.  He worked<br/>
at gathering together the components he needed, and with a little assistance<br/>
from his dad, he did his experiment successfully.  Then......he promptly<br/>
went to his computer and wrote out the instructions so that someone else<br/>
could do it.<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned that if participating with our Charter School was not<br/>
what we really needed that we could maybe quit it now.  I thought about<br/>
that, but for the present they do pay for Kristopher&#39;s tutor which I do wish<br/>
to continue for a while.  He enjoys this time very much, and it is funny,<br/>
because he has &#39;taught&#39; his tutor some things on her computer she didn&#39;t<br/>
know how to do!!  LOL  So..........I have decided that we can use the projects<br/>
he is doing on his own to send in to the Charter School for his files there!<br/>
I just have to be certain we cover one way or another the &quot;four core subjects&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In addition.......Kristopher and his dad are receiving some financial assistance<br/>
at this time from our county (his dad has a lot of medical struggles)....and<br/>
we have to have &quot;proof&quot; that Kristopher is in school!  Our Charter School<br/>
provides a letter of Kristopher&#39;s enrollment with them  (twice a year), and<br/>
we don&#39;t have any problems of someone knocking on our door to check on him,<br/>
etc.   So.......there are advantages!!<br/>
<br/>
Keep the ideas and suggetions coming!!!!<br/>

IF you decide that it is too much effort to come up with documentation <br/>
of work for the charter school - and want out - you can enroll in a <br/>
private isp that supports unschooling and doesn&#39;t require such <br/>
documentation. They&#39;ll give you a letter to prove Kristopher&#39;s <br/>
enrollment.<br/>
<br/>
OR you can start your own private school - give it a name - and write <br/>
your own letter - attach a copy of your filed R4 if you think they <br/>
might balk at your letter.<br/>
<br/>
  I do know unschoolers who manage to satisfy charter schools and still <br/>
unschool. You can usually take picture of kids engaged in some activity <br/>
- that is often something they&#39;ll accept.<br/>
