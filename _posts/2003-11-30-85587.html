<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652955305">If you&#39;re so inclined, will you please pray for me and my family? My dad&#39;s mother is not doing well. She has Alzheimer&#39;s and diabetes. While I was in the hospital after Gracie&#39;s birth because of the pulmonary embolism, Gram had a UTI go septic. While in the hospital for that she fell and broke her hip. She&#39;s been in a nursing home since and is declining. Her hip isn&#39;t healing well and she&#39;s been placed on a feeding tube because she is unable to swallow. Her heart isn&#39;t the greatest either. She&#39;s spending most of her time asleep, and rarely has any lucid moments.<br/>
 <br/>
We are not expecting her to make it through the end of the year...<br/>

Her name is Jeanette Owen. <br/>

Thanks so much!<br/>

We are dealing with the same thing.  My father-in-law has been in a <br/>
nursing home for some time.  His Alzheimer&#39;s has also reached the <br/>
stage where his brain no longer signals his throat to swallow, so he <br/>
keeps getting pneumonia.  He forgot how to walk long ago.  All agreed <br/>
to sign a DNR order and not to continue a feeding tube, which made <br/>
him eligible for the hospice wing of the nursing home.  In truth he <br/>
is getting much better treatment there, but we expect he, too, will <br/>
not make it through the end of the year.  We visited him last week, a <br/>
long drive.  But we figure it may be the last time we see him alive.  <br/>
I will hold you and your family in our prayerful and healing thoughts.<br/>
