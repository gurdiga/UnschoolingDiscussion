<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081723056">Those of you who know Marty, or those of you who have been in or  <br/>
around the SCA (or both, Ren and some...), I just got this note from   <br/>
Duke Artan (a.k.a. my friend Jeff) about my middle child:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; .  I got some very nice complements from some young fighters, about  <br/>
&gt; how they really like his attitude.  I also saw, him fighting  <br/>
&gt; extremely well in some melees, where is whooped up on the king and  <br/>
&gt; a couple knights.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am really happy he is my squire.<br/>
