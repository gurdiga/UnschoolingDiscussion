He just doesnt see why try something that has &quot;failed.&quot;  I can see how to make it succeed because it is basicly the way I learn.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have to laugh at the question, &quot;Is it unschooling or laziness?&quot;  I ask <br/>
&gt;myself that very thing regularly.  It is just so incredibly different than <br/>
&gt;the model of schooling most of us know.  I&#39;m pretty sure that most people I <br/>
&gt;know would consider unschooling shear laziness.  I always say &quot;the proof is <br/>
&gt;in the pudding&quot;.  It is a shame that there are hs families out there that <br/>
&gt;are seen as raising uncontrollable children or not educating them properly.  <br/>
&gt;Take a look at their ps counterparts; uncontrollable? uneducated?  I would <br/>
&gt;suppose that&#39;s part of the reason we all choose to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am glad to hear you question youself from time to time.  And your success.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I read all these posts with interest.  I have educated my daughter <br/>
&gt;for the last 6 months - before that she was in school, and I am <br/>
&gt;thinking how lucky i am that my husband lets us get on with it.  I <br/>
&gt;have no oppositon from him ............................ but then I <br/>
&gt;realized that I have never actually *told him* that we dont do school <br/>
&gt;any more!!!  I am not sure how he would take it........<br/>
&gt;He sees this happy confident independant helpful daughter, a GREAT <br/>
&gt;change from the sad argumentative child that she used to be, and <br/>
&gt;comments how good h/s is for her.<br/>
&gt;I think I might just leave it like that !!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have thought about just doing it and showing him how good we are doing than telling him we unschool.  He really is letting me choose what I use for school.  But when I speak about unschooling or read articles on it...He gets worried our daughter wont have the knowledge she needs to suceed.<br/>

Thanks everyone for your help<br/>

<br/>
Sher,  I know that my parents will have many of the same concerns about<br/>
&#39;success&#39; that your husband is expressing.  Often I do as well.  Perhaps it<br/>
would be helpful to gently explore what your husband means by &#39;success.&#39;<br/>
Success is a word that&#39;s thrown around a lot with the expectation that<br/>
everyone &quot;knows&quot; what it means but I find that on closer examination it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean much of anything.  Is success earning a lot of money?  Being<br/>
happy?  Knowing more than other people?  Knowing all the capitals of the 50<br/>
states?  Going to college?  Succeed at what -- school?  business?  college?<br/>
relationships?  civic life?  child-rearing?  What body of knowledge is<br/>
common or necessary to all of these endeavors?<br/>
<br/>
Compulsory public schooling thrives on the unexamined assumption that we&#39;re<br/>
all pursuing &quot;success,&quot; and that it&#39;s the same kind of success for everyone,<br/>
and that the experts are the only ones who can make you successful.  What<br/>
hardly anyone ever stops to ask is whether it&#39;s necessary to be successful<br/>
at all.<br/>

I think you are a very successful unschooler.  :)<br/>
Question everything...take nothing at face value.<br/>
Or, maybe that is just me.<br/>
I happen to admire this in a person.<br/>
Thanks for your post.<br/>

<br/>
My husband was where your dh is about a year ago. We had a friend who, as a <br/>
single mom, basically practiced &quot;educational neglect&quot; but called it <br/>
homeschooling. She worked full time, but had little time for her son, never <br/>
went to the library or bought him materials, etc. We said her son was being <br/>
raised by the TV and the dog.<br/>
<br/>
When I started talking about unschooling, this was what my dh envisioned. <br/>
<br/>
After reading him stuff aloud, and perhaps emphasizing WHAT we would be doing <br/>
and not stressing the word &quot;unschooling&quot; for a while, he&#39;s now an <br/>
enthusiastic supporter of the unschooling philosophy. It just took a little <br/>
time and information.<br/>
