<div id="ygrps-yiv-751493175">Dear Lynda,<br/>
You&#39;re right nobel was a strange choice of words. I guess it was one of<br/>
those &quot;lack of a better term&quot; moments. I agree that drug companies do keep<br/>
us in the dark. All I was saying is that tampons, like so many other things<br/>
in our lives can be useful (esp. if you swim) and that they do work well for<br/>
a lot of people (myself included). I would never discourage any of my<br/>
daughters from using them if they wanted to. Perhaps I go overboard in the<br/>
empowering women thing, but I&#39;d like my daughters  to be able to use them if<br/>
they want. I hope I&#39;ve clearified myself,<br/>
Amy<br/>

&gt; When I used disposable diapers they didn&#39;t have the gel in them.  I mainly<br/>
&gt; used cloth but on an extended vacation they were what we choose to use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, wishing to fight or not, I think that no one is trying to be<br/>
nobel<br/>
&gt; (rather strange choice of words), one was simply sharing information that<br/>
&gt; the drug companies and manufacturers of various products have worked very<br/>
&gt; hard to keep us, the consumers, from knowing.  You can&#39;t make informed<br/>
&gt; choices if you don&#39;t have the information/knowledge to make those choices.<br/>
&gt; As one acquires more information/knowledge, one frequently finds that the<br/>
&gt; choices they made in the past are not the choices they would make in the<br/>
&gt; present.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, TSS is similar to tetenus and blackleg in the environment it needs to<br/>
&gt; cause problems and putting something on the outside of a body will have<br/>
&gt; nothing to do with one acquiring any of the above unless one puntures a<br/>
&gt; spot that they are on.  All take a closed environment (lack of oxygen)<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; has been traumatized--puncture wounds are the norm for tetenus, the<br/>
scrapes<br/>
&gt; and pinches caused by the plastic applicators of the major culprit tampons<br/>
&gt; created the environment for TSS, a bruise is the norm for blackleg.  And,<br/>
&gt; it should be noted that the tampons with the plastic applicators were the<br/>
&gt; ones that were pulled and that other tampon makers were only required to<br/>
&gt; print a warning statement on their packages.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just curios to know... how many of the people that are against the<br/>
&gt; use<br/>
&gt; &gt; of tampons use or have used disposable diapers on their children?  It is<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact that the chemical in the gel used to make disp. diapers so<br/>
absorbant<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; the same chemical that was removed from tampons in 1988 because it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; linked to TSS. And we have this pressing against our children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; reproductive<br/>
&gt; &gt; oragans 24/7? I don&#39;t want anyone to think this is a personal slam. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; not. I use them for my kids from time to time. I&#39;m just saying that<br/>
&gt; perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; we should rethink our stance from time to time. FYI this gel is also the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same one that is used to coat Tylenol and other gel caps. Is it really<br/>
&gt; &gt; objective to make blanket statements about the use of tampons when we<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t be so noble to say we&#39;ve never used any of these other products. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; hate conflict and don&#39;t want anyone to think I&#39;m looking for a fight. I<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; think we all need to examine oue daily practices  a liitle closer.<br/>

&gt; Cutty snippety  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;you said<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Geez I did not know that about Tylenol<br/>
&gt; WOW well if we are NOT supporting them (users of toxic chemicals)<br/>
&gt; vaginally, but we are through diaper use (although I use cloth--with lots<br/>
&gt; of stains ((no bleach here)) then we are holding some stance?!<br/>
&gt; I think it is like that man says (whoever he may be)<br/>
&gt; That you do not have to be a VEGETARIAN<br/>
&gt; Just try not to eat so much meat<br/>
&gt; Like try to walk and not automobile so much<br/>
&gt; Like try not to wrap your veggies in two bags then a bag at the check out<br/>
&gt; ((I HATE THAT))<br/>
&gt; and these are people buying organic fruits and veges<br/>
&gt; ALWAYS makes me wonder<br/>
&gt; WHY<br/>
