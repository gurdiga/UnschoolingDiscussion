&gt; Hi, I&#39;m Bobbie, and I&#39;m a packrat.<br/>
&gt; No, there isn&#39;t a cure. Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there&#39;s hope. I used to be a packrat, and we have a fairly junk-free<br/>
house now. The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and books,<br/>
but everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who has won<br/>
me over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I come from<br/>
a long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my mom&#39;s house<br/>
(ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on that pile<br/>
of magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own house?&quot;<br/>
In my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of magazines<br/>
all over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means nothing to<br/>
her, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old - ack!. My<br/>
grandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her bathrooms because<br/>
it is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room table in at<br/>
least 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff. She just has little pathways<br/>
through everything, piles of old newspapers, magazines, sheet music, etc..<br/>
We don&#39;t go over there anymore. My niece (age 6) said the funniest thing the<br/>
last time we were there, she said &quot;If there was an earthquake when we were<br/>
all visiting Grandma M&#39;s house, we&#39;d all die of paper cuts&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In any case, there&#39;s hope. I listened to a talk radio show on my way back<br/>
from my mom&#39;s house. It had the author of &quot;Clutter&#39;s Last Stand&quot; on as the<br/>
guest. He just wrote a new book called something like &quot;Lose 200 pounds this<br/>
weekend&quot; (meaning 200 pounds of stuff) and he had a bunch of great tips for<br/>
de-cluttering, if anyone&#39;s interested...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-843226384">i haven&#39;t read this entire thread, but along the lines of decluttering,<br/>
has anyone suggested FlyLady?  I was *so* opposed to her when i first<br/>
heard about her, but, i have to admit, she has helped me work wonders in<br/>
my house....and I hate housework....<br/>

**********<br/>
Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455386908">too many co-ink-i-dinks!<br/>
yup it would turn out that my boyfriend is a neat<br/>
freak and places sentimental value on nothing that<br/>
can&#39;t be carried in his own mind. *I* on the other<br/>
hand save ticket stubs from nearly every movie I go<br/>
to... collect leaves, rocks and sticks from nearly<br/>
every place I visit (including the park down the<br/>
street....or just the street, if I took a walk there<br/>
that meant something to me)...a habbit my kids have<br/>
now picked up....a gum wrapper a guy I had a crush on<br/>
gave me when I was 14....dried rose petals I&#39;ve saved<br/>
for who knows how long...etc...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind my degree of packratism.<br/>
I am way worse at heart but when it comes down to<br/>
it... clothes and books and....sentimental items...and<br/>
maybe decorating things...(pics for walls, etc)are my<br/>
main thing. ok, mostly clothes. I have gotten sooo<br/>
much better though. maybe being pregnant and thinking<br/>
I had to get rid of two thirds of them anyway cuz I<br/>
was forever going to be three times my usual body<br/>
weight helped out in that area. :)<br/>
<br/>
I think like you said being with a neat freak has<br/>
helped...but...*snicker*...I think I&#39;m rubbing off on<br/>
him just a teeny bit too. He is now volunteering the<br/>
ticket stubs from the movies we see over to me so I<br/>
can save his for him too. :) ...<br/>
<br/>
BUT I also come from a long line of packrats...my<br/>
mom&#39;s gotten better....<br/>
my dad was sentimental but also liked moving ALOT and<br/>
sometimes if they couldn&#39;t fit it in thier car/truck<br/>
thing when he felt the urge to move they just left it<br/>
behind...so that cut down on &quot;stuff&quot;. :)<br/>
But my GRAMMA, oh my goodness, you had to bring it up.<br/>
she has soooo much stuff in that house...I think she<br/>
stopped using her back bathroom too. papers and stuff<br/>
like yours, but then other STUFF too. old antique<br/>
stuff, jewelry, gifts, books, coupons, you name it...<br/>
she just won&#39;t get rid of anything. She figures it<br/>
will either be valuable someday or it is now or she<br/>
can give it as a gift to one of her kids or grandkids<br/>
or something (she&#39;s a bit wacky, btw)<br/>
for awhile my sister (very into going through things<br/>
cleaning out and throwing away things) was going over<br/>
there once a week and helping her cut down on the<br/>
clutter and clean and stuff. It got more organized but<br/>
still ALOT of stuff. That is a bit much for me.<br/>
Though....if I had a big enough mansion of a house...<br/>
I might keep all that stuff too. <br/>
<br/>
heeh, the problem, apparently is not too much stuff,<br/>
but rather, not enough space to put it in. <br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
oh and my other sis has that losing 200 pounds book on<br/>
tape. I heard part of it. funny. :)<br/>

yourself &quot;Is this enhancing my life?&quot; and if you can honestly answer yes,<br/>
then keep it. Otherwise it goes. Of course, the answer differs for everyone.<br/>
