<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097279630">Just a reminder that the MHEA conference will be from 8:00 am to 5:30 pm<br/>
this Saturday (April 3, 2004) at Anne Arundel Community College in Maryland<br/>
(midway between Annapolis and Baltimore). The keynote speaker is Daniel<br/>
Pink, author of &quot;Free Agent Nation&quot;<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/books/8791.htm)">http://www.fun-books.com/books/8791.htm)</a>. Mr Pink makes a strong argument<br/>
for homeschooling as an excellent preparation for jobs in the future.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the keynote speech, there will be lots of workshops for new<br/>
homeschoolers as well as veteran homeschoolers with topics on unschooling,<br/>
mathematics, learning styles, high school, college, early years and more.<br/>
There will be a talent show, a panel of homeschool graduates speaking about<br/>
their experiences in the real world of college, work and the military and<br/>
much more! Lunch will be available on the premises.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there will be a Local Support Group fair with representatives invited<br/>
from every support group in Maryland, and a Resource Fair with a wide<br/>
variety of vendors offering homeschooling materials.<br/>
<br/>
FUN Books, www.FUN-Books.com, will be there with lots of great materials. In<br/>
celebration of our 10th anniversary, we will have special discounts,<br/>
clearance items, scratch and dent items and other special offers. You can<br/>
order in advance and pick up at the conference to save shipping and ensure<br/>
the items you want will be available, or you can request that we bring<br/>
specific items for you to review. If you&#39;ve been thinking about learning a<br/>
new language, Rosetta Stone has announced new pricing that goes into effect<br/>
April 1st, but you can pre-order now at sale prices and pick up your order<br/>
at the conference.<br/>
