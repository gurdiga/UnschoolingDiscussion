&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hit enter too soon.  So, Sandra, any suggestions for a teen who <br/>
&gt; wants to be unschooled, is college-bound, and is math-averse after <br/>
&gt; using a textbook for so many years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Sandra but here are my thoughts on this:<br/>
<br/>
Rachel wants to go to a college i have recently attended.  I happen to<br/>
know that the basic college algebra class starts pretty basic - a child<br/>
with no formal algebra but a good grasp of basic math would do fine. <br/>
There is also a class for those who don&#39;t have enough math to take the<br/>
algebra class.  I forget what it is called - something like preperatory<br/>
math or somesuch.<br/>
So I would say, look into the colleges (by asking other students there -<br/>
not the faculty) and see just what will be needed.  You may find that he<br/>
needs a lot less than you think in the way of formal math - in fact &quot;none<br/>
at all&quot; comes to mind here.<br/>

&gt; Thanks Sheri.....unschooling moments help SO much.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you write the above ^ quote? It&#39;s pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Well....I wrote it but stole the basic phrase...hehe. I am unable to come up<br/>
with a direct quote or who said it, I&#39;d need to go look it up, my memory<br/>
isn&#39;t what it used to be. lol Many have used the basic phrase, I am unsure<br/>
who said it first.<br/>
