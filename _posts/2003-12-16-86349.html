<div id="ygrps-yiv-513543709">We love zoombinis here! Don&#39;t wait to get it--even my 3.5 yo loves it. (I <br/>
think the recommended age is 8 and up-bah!)<br/>
<br/>
A must have! I got Logical Journey together with Mountain Rescue from <br/>
Amazon. Start with Logical Journey, especially if your kids aren&#39;t really <br/>
reading yet because it reads the directions for each stage; Mountain Rescue <br/>
does not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234685964">Zoombinis is awesome! My 4 yr. old plays it all the time as do I. We bought <br/>
ours from a college student selling bundled games and books this summer.  I <br/>
think we also got Might Math Numbers with it also.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, today I was at Scholastic Books Warehouse sale and spotted them. I think <br/>
regular price was 14.00 so discount price for HSers and teachers is 7.00.  Go <br/>
to www.scholastic.com and click teachers and then the link on the side for <br/>
the warehouse sales near you.<br/>
<br/>
For those who do not know the scholastic sales we HSers/Unschoolers can <br/>
attend. Some ask for HS paperwork while others (here in Maine) never ask.  <br/>
Everything on the shelves is 50% off and here there are like 8 double sided large <br/>
isles of books, pens pencils and some toys.<br/>
<br/>
This is where we bought Dustin&#39;s Harry Potter books 1/2 off! Captain <br/>
Underpants, goosebumps, Box Car Kids and they also have Judy Bloom, books on America <br/>
etc.... <br/>
Our sale has been for almost two weeks and ends this Friday.<br/>

Hey, I saw Zoombini&#39;s Mountain Rescue (lots of them) for sale for only $5.99 <br/>
at Burlington Coat Factory yesterday!  Too bad we already have it.<br/>
<br/>
Is there another one out besides that one and Logical Journey?  We have <br/>
both,but we&#39;d like more.<br/>

<br/>
Does Burlington generally have discounted software?   We buy a lot of  software at TJMAX and Marshalls, but I&#39;d love to find more sources<br/>

Yep.  Just like TJMaxx and Marshall&#39;s.  They&#39;re usually older titles that are <br/>
being replaced by new versions or whatever, but they&#39;re still fun.<br/>

zoombinis. I am going to get it for sure.<br/>
Would an 11 almost 12 yr old like it too? I&#39;ll get it for my 8 yr old <br/>

figure out the patterns, of course, they figure it out<br/>
faster than my 5yo.<br/>
<br/>
But even though the game says 8+ as the age range, my<br/>
5yo plays it very well.<br/>

parts are more difficult than others. The bubble one is confusing to me but the <br/>
railroad carts are not though my daughter age 4 is the opposite. Laura<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371285627">Here&#39;s a game that&#39;s great fun and very challenging (and quite different from <br/>
Zoombinies--those posts just got me to thinking about it). This one is not <br/>
:::sigh::: available for Mac, and even requires a pretty spiffy PC to work well (it&#39;s 3D), <br/>
but it&#39;s ~so~ wonderful! It&#39;s the newest Myst game. You can even customize the look <br/>
of your character that you take through all the adventures--clothes, shape, <br/>
complexion, color and length of hair--the choices are incredible, and you can even <br/>
customize facial features. <br/>
