<div id="ygrps-yiv-510805">Hi all,<br/>
I have been a lurker/sometimes poster on the list for quite a while now and<br/>
need some help.  We currently live in SW Virginia and will be moving back to<br/>
NC in the next few months.  I need your help in finding inclusive groups in<br/>
the Charlotte area. I&#39;ve already checked NHEN and NCHE.<br/>
<br/>
We will probably be moving north of Charlotte, possibly back to Mooresville,<br/>
maybe to Lincoln county.  Yet we may be closer to Charlotte, possibly<br/>
Davidson or Huntersville.  Do any of you know of any groups we can connect<br/>
with?  At this point, I would love to know of ANY inclusive group within a<br/>
40 mile radius of Charlotte, not just on the north side.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TIA!<br/>
Cindy</div>

&gt;forward your e-addy to them?<br/>
