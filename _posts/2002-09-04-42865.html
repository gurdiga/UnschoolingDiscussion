*************<br/>
The next issue of Paths of Learning (www.pathsoflearning.net) will focus on<br/>
the question Does America Really Love Its Children?<br/>
<br/>
As part of our discussion, we are soliciting brief essays (around 250 words)<br/>
from children/teens in response to the following questions:<br/>
<br/>
For younger kids:  What would make your world more friendly and fair to<br/>
kids?  <br/>
<br/>
For older kids/teens:  What would it be like to live in a society that was<br/>
child-friendly, that put kids first?<br/>
<br/>
Submissions should include a first name and an age and can be emailed to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pathseditor@...">pathseditor@...</a> by Sept. 30.</div>
