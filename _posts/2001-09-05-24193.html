&gt; personal to them at bedtime? When my children need sone individual time or <br/>
&gt; something is heavy on their hearts, they ask to sleep with me. My husband <br/>
&gt; is on the road most of the time so we usually end up having deep <br/>

quite easily most of the time. Once we started homeschooling, that went out <br/>
the window. He usually goes to bed about the same time we do, because if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t get his bedtime reading. (We love him dearly, but we have <br/>
to go to sleep.) Sometimes he has to get up early and is tired. He probably <br/>
doesn&#39;t get as much sleep as he needs. But we get to spend lots of time <br/>
together as a family, even the poor unfortunate soul who has to work in the <br/>
morning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089003175">My husband and I could use a good dose of wisdom, insight and advice from you <br/>
guys right now.  We have been &quot;deschooling&#39; since May.  Although never publicly <br/>
schooled, my ds&#39;s (8 and 10)  had workbooks, curriculum, bedtimes and the like.  We <br/>
are trying hard to not stress out over the bedtime and tv watching thing, however, we <br/>
are struggling with it and I know they can sense it at times.  Last night, or should I <br/>
say this morning, my 10 YO said he came to bed at 3am.  He said he left his brother <br/>
(8), still watching tv and he is still in bed as I type this (almost 1:15pm), so I don&#39;t <br/>
know when he finally went to bed.  Everyone says that they will start &quot;listening&quot; to <br/>
their bodies and sleep when they need to, however, we are having a hard time <br/>
&quot;keeping the faith&quot;.  I also wonder if my late night habits are part of the equation.  Is <br/>
there a right way and a wrong way to do this?  Should I make sure I go to bed at 10 or <br/>
11 every night like their dad does, or does it even matter?  I have been able to point <br/>
out to my 10 YO how his crankiness is related to not getting enough sleep.  He gets it <br/>
and I don&#39;t worry about him as much anyway because he is such a pro-active, go <br/>
getter type of person and usually starts crawling out of his skin if he sits at the tv or <br/>
computer too long.  He is also a natural &quot;early riser&quot; (like his dad), and I can see how <br/>
he could balance out in the future.  However, my 8 YO  can sit for hours upon hours <br/>
at the tv, or a computer game.  I tend to fall asleep if it&#39;s tv, but if I&#39;m at the <br/>
computer, I can stay up till 3 as well.  I used to feel bad about that until I read one of <br/>
Sandra&#39;s posts about the &quot;night-watchmen&quot; of the tribes.  I figure my ancestors were <br/>
the night-watchmen and dh&#39;s were the hunter/gatherers! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think I can guess what one person &lt;g&gt; might say, something like;  so <br/>
what&#39;s wrong with staying up till 3 or 4am and and getting up at 2pm?  And if that is <br/>
indeed the consensus,  then how &#39;bout helping me see what is &quot;right&quot; about it.  My <br/>
husband definitely feels that it is wrong because of his upbringing, and I just feel <br/>
that it&#39;s not helping to form good habits for college (if they choose) or the daytime <br/>
working world (if they choose). <br/>
<br/>
I probably have the answer to this issue in my heart somewhere, I just would like a <br/>
little help and perspective for myself and my dh.  One nice thing dh said this morning <br/>
about their late night last night , &quot;what great childhood memories they&#39;ll have!&quot;  I <br/>
thought that was a great way to look at it, but it&#39;s hard for us to maintain that <br/>
attitude.</div>

with our kids, without verbalizing our intent, is that whenever we go to bed, <br/>
the kids go to bed.  Often this is around 10-10:30&#39;ish.  It&#39;s not something <br/>
spoken of, it&#39;s just sort of a &quot;well, come on guys, it&#39;s getting late, how about <br/>
brushing our teeth?&quot;  Brushing the teeth is sort of their unspoken knowledge <br/>
that it&#39;s bedtime.<br/>
However, my son is also a natural early riser, and just does not require as <br/>
much sleep as the rest of the household.  This has been his way since birth.  <br/>
So he gets up, no matter what his bedtime, around 6-6:30am.  The only &quot;rule&quot; <br/>
(and I use that word lightly) is that he try not to disturb anyone else still <br/>
sleeping.  He&#39;s very good with this and will typically get himself a drink and <br/>
turn the tv on in his bdrm.  <br/>
This routine has worked well for us for the most part.  With a few &#39;off&#39; days <br/>
of severe crankiness and rudeness when someone just did not get enough <br/>
sufficient sleep.  On those days, we just do the routine an hour or two earlier and <br/>
it seems to compensate well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734911543">That was damn close to my hours during several years of college -- at least a couple of semesters I ended up having to take earlier classes (although &quot;early&quot; classes met at 9 or 10, not 7 or 8, and it was not unknown for me (or several of my friends) to roll out of bed in our sweats at 8:45 and dash across a (small) campus for a 9:00 class.  (I graduated summa cum laude, if it makes any difference).  Part of the joy of college is that you often arrange your classes around your preferred sleeping arrangements.  <br/>
<br/>
I have an acquaintance who is a scriptwriter and, now, college professor.  Those are pretty much his hours - and according to his wife, he stayed up even later when they lived in L.A. and he was writing for television.   I also have an acquaintance who is a security guard and who works from 2:00 until 11.00.  He generally gets up by 10 or 11. <br/>
<br/>
My husband (a corporate attorney) stays up until 2:00 and gets up at 7:30 (in to the office by 9:30 or so) and then sleeps until noon on both Saturday and Sunday.  <br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s &quot;good&quot; about it, IMO -- is that he is discovering who he is and what he likes.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595297979">I worked night shift for nearly 3 years. I could sleep anytime, any <br/>
place fortunately. But I would feel sick in the morning or when I was <br/>
off nights due to the chaotic biorhythms. Some of my co-workers kept <br/>
their off schedule the same: up nights. <br/>
<br/>
At heart I am an early riser, afternoon napper and night owl. We are <br/>
all different. I have learned to avoid afternoon challenges because I <br/>
am not at my best. We have to learn what works for us, reguardless of <br/>
whether we live on a set schedule for some reason of our own. Why <br/>
should anyone sleep when someone else thinks that they are tired? <br/>
What is the point?<br/>

I think it would be easier for you to tell us what you feel is wrong about<br/>
your sons staying up late.  Unschooling focuses on the &quot;now&quot;, not what might<br/>
possibly be helpful at some unknown point in the future.  Who knows,<br/>
civilization as we know it could end tomorrow so going to college is a moot<br/>
reason.<br/>
<br/>
In what way is the boys&#39; staying up effecting them or the family in a<br/>
negative manner right now?<br/>

***Everyone says that they will start &quot;listening&quot; to <br/>
their bodies and sleep when they need to***<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
They will,  really.   <br/>
 <br/>
We have nights like that around here,  especially if we&#39;ve gotten a new video game or if the kids are really into a series that&#39;s on late,  or a new Harry Potter book.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Some people really function well late at night.  My son is that way.  He&#39;ll go on and on about how nice and quiet and calming it is at night.  He loves it.  He&#39;ll often stay up late into the night,  or early into the morning. (However you look at it. :)<br/>
 <br/>
When we were first deschooling and debedtiming (if that&#39;s a word) it was a bit hard for me.  But they really proved to me that they could decide on how much sleep they needed.  They might stay up really late one night, but then in turn realize they need to get to bed earlier the next.   As far as getting up for things in the morning, they&#39;ve been fine there too.  If they have something they want to do, they&#39;ll go to bed.  They know themselves and what they need.  Its great!<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve had lots of discussions about it too.  My daughter (9) has figured out she doesn&#39;t feel good when she&#39;s been up really late.   She likes to get to bed by 10:00-11:00.  My son (11), on the other hand, just shines some mornings when he&#39;s been up all night working on something.  Then goes and sleeps.  He doesn&#39;t need as much as most of us.<br/>
 <br/>
Do you enjoy being up?  It sounded like it,  from your post.  What a great thing.  You can enjoy the night together.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think you need to worry. <br/>
 <br/>
Oh,  and check this out,  I just heard this on Public Radio,  it was so interesting.  It was all about nighttime.  They talk about how some people are more creative at late night hours.  How lots of artists produce their best work after midnight.<br/>

It was pretty interesting.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I guess, I have always been told that it just isn&#39;t good and other people have <br/>
always made me feel like I was somehow flawed being this way myself, including my <br/>
husband.  (Until I read him Sandras post about the tribes and night-watchmen) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; In what way is the boys&#39; staying up effecting them or the family in a<br/>
&gt; negative manner right now?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eric is crabby and Alex is lethargic with no energy to do anything else but stare at the <br/>
tv some more.  They used to play so creatively when we did not turn the TV on during <br/>
the day.  And I am stressed that I may be screwing them up for life! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Funny, when Alex finally came down this afternoon, fully dressed, at around 2pm, he <br/>
said to me, &quot;I&#39;m never going to do that again.&quot;  I asked him why and he said he didn&#39;t <br/>
like getting up so late in the day.  However, his brother went swimming today at the <br/>
neighbors house and Alex just decided to turn that TV back on again and he is still in <br/>
front of it now. (8pm)  I feel as though he just can&#39;t help himself.  <br/>
<br/>
Ya know, as I am &quot;writing&quot; this through, I am realizing it&#39;s the tv thing that bothers me <br/>
so much.  For a long time, when they had a &quot;bedtime&quot;, all we asked was that they get <br/>
ready for bed and be in their rooms.  They could play quietly, read or what ever until <br/>
they were tired (they don&#39;t have TV&#39;s in their rooms).  This didn&#39;t bother me at all.  <br/>
And often, Alex would be up past 11, but never until 4:30am which by the way, he <br/>
told me, is how late he stayed up last night.  <br/>
<br/>
Would it be counterproductive of me to ask that we/they come to an agreement about <br/>

I love the night time hours.  I too, like the quiet, stillness and now that you mention <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
They WILL come to it on their own, but pointing things out to them isn&#39;t a  <br/>
bad idea. NOT over and over, and preferably NOT when they&#39;re tired and grumpy.  <br/>
When you&#39;re talking about what a body needs.<br/>
 <br/>
What do *you* do? Can you turn the tube off when you&#39;re tired? I went to  bed <br/>
last night at 10:00 while Duncan and Ben watched _The Invisible Man_. I was  <br/>
tired, so I went to bed. I stated it out loud. &quot;I&#39;m pooped. I&#39;m going on to  <br/>
bed.&quot; The more they see you do it, the more it makes sense to them. (Now, two  <br/>
nights ago, I stayed up until 3:30. I&#39;m not very bedtime-oriented!  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s hard, as a kid, to understand why children have to go to  bed  when <br/>
they&#39;re not tired but that parents/grown ups can stay up all  night---even when <br/>
they have to work the next day. Adults will say that they  just need some &quot;down <br/>
time&quot;---some time to themselves to unwind, and that&#39;s why  children need to go <br/>
to bed. But that sends the wrong message. If children see  YOU retiring when <br/>
you&#39;re tired, they want to too. If they see you trying to stay  up as long as <br/>
you can, wellllll.......  Not to mention how they must feel  being &quot;gotten rid <br/>
of&quot; so that their parents can watch tv &quot;in peace&quot;. OR that  they turn off <br/>
their own biological needs because they&#39;re forcing themselves to  sleep when <br/>
they&#39;re not tired.<br/>
 <br/>
Just like &quot;Math-out-loud&quot;, you can use &quot;Tired-out-loud&quot;. &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
&quot;Hungry-out-loud&quot; is a good one too! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
TELL them how *you* have come to these conclusions.&quot;15% of 100 is 15, so  15% <br/>
of 50 is 7.5.&quot; &quot;I worked so hard in the heat today and I got so little sleep  <br/>
last night. I&#39;m going to bed early. See you in the morning.&quot;  I&#39;m crabby  and <br/>
hungry. I bet I need some protein; I haven&#39;t had any all day. I&#39;ll grab a  <br/>
piece of cheese.&quot;  Out loud. Not directed at them, but at yourself.  They just <br/>
get to hear your thinking.<br/>
 <br/>
Do *you* go to bed when you&#39;re tired? Or will you stay up to watch the end  <br/>
of a movie? Model the behavior you&#39;d like them to have. Works like a charm!  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;  Well, I guess we all have to keep in mind that we&#39;re all  different. Some <br/>
need late night hours; some need 10 hours to feel best; some  need 4 hours! But <br/>
overall.....<br/>
 <br/>
Rarely is anyone up past midnight at out house. If anyone is, it&#39;s  me! But <br/>
the boys often see me go to bed at 8:30 if I need to. They  also see me take <br/>
naps. And they do too if they need them!<br/>

old shows so long.<br/>
<br/>
When we went to no limits on tv, my then 9yo watched tv non-stop for 4<br/>
months.  Now 4 years later, she works out 16 hours a week, has a part-time<br/>
job, reads books, cares for about 15 animals, socializes with<br/>
friends......and watches some tv.<br/>
<br/>
You guys have been doing this a short-time.  Don&#39;t worry about screwing him<br/>
up for life (what pressure!!!).  Give the kids and yourselves 1 year.  Tell<br/>
yourself you will completely let go for 1 year and will re-assess at that<br/>
time.  See how it goes then, don&#39;t worry now.<br/>
<br/>
Every time your son feels you tense up about the tv or bedtimes, he feels<br/>
like it is fixing to be taken away and he better get it all in while he can.<br/>
Relax and take a family sabbatical.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think it would be easier for you to tell us what you feel is wrong<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; &gt; your sons staying up late.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I guess, I have always been told that it just isn&#39;t good and other<br/>
people have<br/>
&gt; always made me feel like I was somehow flawed being this way myself,<br/>
including my<br/>
&gt; husband.  (Until I read him Sandras post about the tribes and<br/>
night-watchmen) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In what way is the boys&#39; staying up effecting them or the family in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; negative manner right now?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Eric is crabby and Alex is lethargic with no energy to do anything else<br/>
but stare at the<br/>
&gt; tv some more.  They used to play so creatively when we did not turn the TV<br/>
on during<br/>
&gt; the day.  And I am stressed that I may be screwing them up for life! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Funny, when Alex finally came down this afternoon, fully dressed, at<br/>
around 2pm, he<br/>
&gt; said to me, &quot;I&#39;m never going to do that again.&quot;  I asked him why and he<br/>
said he didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like getting up so late in the day.  However, his brother went swimming<br/>
today at the<br/>
&gt; neighbors house and Alex just decided to turn that TV back on again and he<br/>
is still in<br/>
&gt; front of it now. (8pm)  I feel as though he just can&#39;t help himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ya know, as I am &quot;writing&quot; this through, I am realizing it&#39;s the tv thing<br/>
that bothers me<br/>
&gt; so much.  For a long time, when they had a &quot;bedtime&quot;, all we asked was<br/>
that they get<br/>
&gt; ready for bed and be in their rooms.  They could play quietly, read or<br/>
what ever until<br/>
&gt; they were tired (they don&#39;t have TV&#39;s in their rooms).  This didn&#39;t bother<br/>
me at all.<br/>
&gt; And often, Alex would be up past 11, but never until 4:30am which by the<br/>
way, he<br/>
&gt; told me, is how late he stayed up last night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Would it be counterproductive of me to ask that we/they come to an<br/>
agreement about<br/>
&gt; a what is a reasonable time to turn off the TV?  It seems to me that it&#39;s<br/>
the TV that<br/>

<br/>
The kids watch TV in the playroom, or play computer<br/>
games or playstation or read of craft or whatever in<br/>
the evening.  I am usually in bed by 9, and watch TV<br/>
until 10:30 or 11....When they get tired, they come<br/>
into my bed and settle in  (they are almost 12 and<br/>
6)--we program the TV to change channels to what they<br/>
want to watch, then set the timer to turn itself off<br/>
in 80 minutes or whatever.  So I fall alseep, they<br/>
watch another 1/2 hour or hour or 2 or whatever until<br/>
they fall alseep, and if they need more they just put<br/>
more on the timer, but that keeps us from having to<br/>
get up to shut it off.  I think they are usually<br/>
alseep by 12:30 or 1.  There is no time they have to<br/>
leave their evening ativities, there is no time they<br/>
have to stop watching tv, they just listen to their<br/>
bodies and come to bed when they&#39;re tired.  We have<br/>
always worked it this way, or some similar way...<br/>

Just like &quot;Math-out-loud&quot;, you can use &quot;Tired-out-loud&quot;. &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
&quot;Hungry-out-loud&quot; is a good one too! &lt;G&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been keeping a baby, who was delivered here some mornings at 7:45, and <br/>
sometimes 8:15 (different different days), and so every morning for two weeks <br/>
I was getting up very early.   She&#39;s not here today.  So yesterday afternoon I <br/>
was doing the happy dance about not having to get up early the next day, <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t wake me up, let me sleep!&quot; and I was honestly giddy.<br/>
<br/>
Then I remembered Marty had a 9:00 a.m. doctor&#39;s appointment, so I <br/>
dramatically grumped and whined and everybody laughed.<br/>
<br/>
So we got up and went to the doctor.<br/>
<br/>
The baby we usually keep was there, with her dad.  Someone at the counter <br/>
said, &quot;OH what a cute baby!&quot; and I look around and it&#39;s Alexa.  (Albuquerque is <br/>
really NOT that small a town.)  That was fun.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, last night I went to bed at 10:30, telling people as I went, <br/>
&quot;Please feed the cats, I&#39;m going to bed because I have to get up to take Marty to <br/>
the doctor,&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t forget this&#39;n&#39;that, I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;   They knew I&#39;d <br/>
been up too early too much for my recent habits.  They were all very <br/>
cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
Today Kirby doesn&#39;t work, Holly has to be somewhere before noon (but she&#39;s <br/>
walking), and Marty&#39;s already back from the doctor.   We all try to know what <br/>
the others need and want and have promised, so we can help each other have quiet <br/>
time, and not oversleep. Everyone seems fairly aware of when everyone else <br/>
needs to be up and gone.   It&#39;s working pretty well to just discuss things, make <br/>
notes on the calendar and be try to be considerate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some families where it seems almost entrapment, that others seem <br/>
gleeful if someone oversleeps, or if they forget to do something.  It&#39;s mean.   <br/>
Here, we don&#39;t want the others to miss out on good stuff!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try to keep your feelings out of it.<br/>
That sounds harsh, I bet, but if you try to get him to make decisions based <br/>
on your vague feelings (which are probably built out of the negative messages <br/>
of many people who criticized you throughout your life), he&#39;s NOT going to be <br/>
making decisions the way you ultimately hope he will.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s just said &quot;I&#39;m never going to do that again,&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s <br/>
never going to do it again.  it means he has regrets.  Regrets help us shape <br/>
our own actions.  Don&#39;t mess with his natural regrets!  Let him feel those <br/>
emotions and results and experiment with different ways and settle on something <br/>
that&#39;s right for HIS own real emotions and HIS own real thoughts.  Don&#39;t <br/>
encourage him to live to make you happy.  Don&#39;t wait until You think HE is happy for <br/>
you to be happy.  That can lead toward unhealthy co-dependency.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would it be counterproductive of me to ask that we/they come to an <br/>
agreement about <br/>
<br/>
a what is a reasonable time to turn off the TV? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If what you&#39;re going to accept as &quot;reasonable&quot; will have to do with the clock <br/>
instead of with whether they would rather have quiet than TV, rather read, <br/>
rather sleep, then I think it&#39;s counterproductive.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- I tried to explain <br/>
<br/>
to Alex that there will always be something on he will enjoy watching and <br/>
that <br/>
<br/>
sometimes, you just need to walk away, or turn it off.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
You tried to &quot;explain&quot; something that was false.<br/>
There will NOT always be something on that he will enjoy watching.<br/>
And the &quot;sometimes&quot; you need to walk away is a natural thing.  Sometimes he <br/>
will need the bathroom, to eat, to visit friends, to ride a bike, to swim at <br/>
the neighbor&#39;s, to go to a movie, to run with his dog, to read a book or do art <br/>
or cook or take a shower or climb a mountain.    THAT is when he just needs to <br/>
walk away or turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
If at a moment in his life what&#39;s on TV is speaking to him, making his <br/>
synapses fire, satisfying a need in him, than that is not the time to turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not in his head.<br/>
<br/>
And if you want him to listen to his head more than your voice, let him <br/>
listen to it.<br/>
<br/>
His head will be with him his whole life.  Your voice will be a part of his <br/>
subconscious his whole life too.  Do you want it to be a welcome voice?  Don&#39;t <br/>
you want your voice in his memory to be something he WANTS to listen to and <br/>
that makes good sense and is loving instead of something he avoids replaying as <br/>
he&#39;s older?<br/>

&lt;&lt; I love the night time hours.  I too, like the quiet, stillness and now <br/>
that you mention <br/>
<br/>
it, that IS when I do most of my creative work.  And my Alex (8), is very <br/>
very much like <br/>
<br/>
me in that he is artistic and tenacious when it comes to learning new things. <br/>

And it&#39;s easier to concentrate on a project, for me, when I&#39;m sure nobody&#39;s <br/>
going to call or come over anymore, no kid is going to want a ride (though <br/>
those things CAN happen in the middle of the night, it&#39;s extremely rare and <br/>
emergecy-related).<br/>

Here&#39;s something about late-night activities here:<br/>

daily until I don&#39;t remember it being an issue anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Your statement above sent chills down my spine!  I hear my parents voices in my head <br/>
as yucky demeaning, yelling, disapproving, all the time.  That is NOT what I want my <br/>
children to experience!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made enough mistakes with them that I already feel guilt over.  I wish not to <br/>
make any more!<br/>

Thanx so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906970598">Wow. What a wonderful, fabulously helpful statement. This really gave<br/>
me some new framework within which to talk with my girls... really<br/>
helps clarify (to me) more about how to talk with them about things.<br/>
Wow. Thanks for these words. I want to be a kind helpful pleasant<br/>
voice in their heads, not the nagging one that provokes them to call a<br/>
therapist...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987006791">Have a blank videotape in the VCR ready to tape - make it really simple <br/>
so all they have to do is press the record button. Tell them that when <br/>
they get sleepy, but don&#39;t want to miss the show they&#39;re watching, they <br/>
can just push record and then they&#39;ll be able to watch it when they <br/>
wake up.<br/>
<br/>
Make them really comfortable on the floor or couch - blankets and <br/>
pillows.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure other lights are turned off and there isn&#39;t other noise <br/>
(other than tv) going on.<br/>
<br/>
Wait until between shows and call them to come have a story all cuddled <br/>
up in their bed.<br/>
<br/>
These are all things I&#39;ve done in the past to sort of boost my kids&#39; <br/>
ability to fall asleep when they are tired  but forcing themselves to <br/>
stay awake and watch one more show. The reason they do that is partly <br/>
because they show a little clip of the next show, at the end of the <br/>
previous one, and they get hooked. This was usually Nick-at-Night and <br/>
they&#39;re watching Cosby or Roseanne or whatever is on late.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays - Rosie routinely falls asleep reading or watching tv - every <br/>
night. So I just throw a blanket over her and she sleeps all night <br/>
wherever she fell asleep. Roya falls asleep every night listening to <br/>
books on cd and Roxana listens to music (musical theater) every night.<br/>

&gt; They WILL come to it on their own, but pointing things out to them <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t a<br/>

<br/>
Roxana is in an intensive theater conservatory summer program - they <br/>
meet 9 to 5 every day - and we have to leave an hour beforehand to get <br/>
there on time. It is physically exhausting - nonstop singing and <br/>
dancing. She&#39;s tired. During the first week or so, she chose to get up <br/>
late and throw her clothes on and get out the door having eaten <br/>
nothing. Food doesn&#39;t appeal to her for the first hour out of bed. Some <br/>
days they didn&#39;t have time for lunch. She was really going downhill - <br/>
getting harder and harder to get along with every day - feeling low. I <br/>
mentioned food to her - saying I thought she should consider having <br/>
something ready to eat in the car on the way there, offering to get <br/>
whatever she would like. She turned me down with a grimace and I <br/>
dropped it. The THIRD week of conservatory I noticed she was bringing <br/>
food along in the car, nibbling at it, and wrapping it up and putting <br/>
the leftovers in her bag. She was a LOT happier - it made a huge <br/>
difference.<br/>

my mother being a chaperone-band camp, in...8th grade, I think...<br/>
I can remember walking down the hallway of the college dorm we were staying <br/>
at, my shoe untied, and thinking how COOL it was that I could actually walk <br/>
with that floppy, clacking noise without my mother ranting about it-I could be my <br/>
OWN person! But, every step I took, I heard my mother&#39;s voice in my head <br/>
telling me to, &quot;Tie that shoe&quot; &quot;Tie that shoe!&quot; I listened to that voice for <br/>
probably 20 steps before I said outloud in an empty corridor, &quot;ALL RIGHT!!&quot; and <br/>
bent down and tied my shoe. Gone was my sense of independence and pretty much my <br/>
good mood for the rest of the day, too...<br/>
