<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791320494">Have to tell someone about our very unusual day.<br/>
First let me tell you that we live on a farm, and have many animals.<br/>
Today we had to put one of horses down.  He was over 30 yrs. old, and<br/>
was mostly blind and deaf.<br/>
It made me very sad.  I cry very easily.<br/>
My kids wanted to watch the vet put him down.  Since their Grandma was<br/>
going to be there, I thought that would be fine.  Then they wanted to<br/>
watch the man bury him.  This is not a pleasant process.  They use a<br/>
backhoe.  There was no way that I could handle watching this.<br/>
I did agree to let the kids watch the whole process.  I was very<br/>
surprised.  They had no problem with this whole thing.  I guess since<br/>
they are growing up with the possibility of death, and being exposed to<br/>
it, they are not as traumatized by it.<br/>
This is defiantly unschooling!!  (My style anyway)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-251644671">All this will, of course, bring up all kinds of questions about life and <br/>
death and fertilizer and who knows what, which will lead to some very <br/>
informative topics in your home!<br/>
<br/>
It amazes me how well kids deal with death, if we give them the chance.  I <br/>
was recently responsible for the funeral arrangements for a friend that died <br/>
of cancer.  I also had custody of her 10 yr old daughter.  I have a 10 yr old <br/>
son.  My friend&#39;s daughter and I were both with my friend when she passed <br/>
away.  (I got some flack from well-meaning people about having the kids so <br/>
involved, but it seemed the right thing to do and I don&#39;t regret it)  <br/>
<br/>
The kids were very involved in the funeral arrangements.  There was, of <br/>
course, the trauma of losing someone we loved.  But, what surprised me is how <br/>
interested the kids were in everything that happened!  They wanted to know <br/>
what happens to bodies at death and afterwards.  They weren&#39;t squeamish about <br/>
it and I think exploring the questions really helped them deal with an <br/>
overwhelming situation.<br/>
<br/>
At the funeral, the kids wanted my friend to have flowers in her hand and not <br/>
just on top of the casket.  Gulp!  There wasn&#39;t anyone else around and the <br/>
task fell to me...very spur of the moment, I might add.  I almost laughed out <br/>
loud when I saw the funeral director&#39;s face as I reached in to position the <br/>
flowers so they were within her grasp!  <br/>
<br/>
Helping the kids deal with all of it in such a kind and forthright way was <br/>
very enlightening for all of us!  Well worth any moments of discomfort it <br/>
brought to me.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you did a good job with your kids.  Should be an interesting next <br/>
couple of weeks in your house...BG<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339925431">I agree that kids handle death much differently then we, adults, do. I have<br/>
always had a hard time with death and I am working on that. but isaac just<br/>
accepts it. probably cus i explained that it is and it is part of our<br/>
lives. we havent had to deal with it much with him. the only thing that<br/>
freaks him out is creamation.<br/>
<br/>
when our cat died, I was afraid but went to have her put down and held her<br/>
and it was so peaceful and calming that i began to see death differently. i<br/>
feel better about it and I am glad that isaac is able to handle it.<br/>
<br/>
on a tangent here, i take a jewish religious school teachers class cus i<br/>
teach 8th grade. we had a funeral director come and talk to us and it was<br/>
very eye opening. he said that kids could visit funeral home and learn when<br/>
not presented with an immediate death situation. and this fall i plan on<br/>
setting up a tour for some hs kids.<br/>

This is so true. I lost my grandmother and my mother a year ago( they died 5 <br/>
weeks apart). My girls were both there when my mom died. It had been a cloudy <br/>
day, and the moment she died the clouds opened up and the sun shone--the sky <br/>
was golden. It really was awesome.    At my mom&#39;s funeral we were putting <br/>
flowers on the casket--my then 6yo dd had brought Tootsie Rolls and put them <br/>
on because&quot;Grandma loves candy more than flowers!&quot;  <br/>
 we spent a lot of time talking about what had happened and different <br/>
customs.  We still do.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that is such a great idea.  I never would have thought of doing that.<br/>
My kids (particularly my 6 yr. old) ask alot of questions about death, and talk<br/>
about it often.  I think this is the age of processing that.  I think it would<br/>
be very interesting to them.<br/>
A part of me thinks it might be difficult, but then that&#39;s why I have more<br/>
problems with it then my kids.<br/>
I guess growing up, we were always not hidden, but &quot;protected&quot; for death and<br/>
all that it entails.  No one ever talked about the detail....They were always a<br/>
mystery.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have not mentioned a bit about the horse being gone or shown any<br/>
sadness.  I was surprised.  I do miss him when I&#39;m in the barn, and I told them<br/>
that, but they don&#39;t seem to.  I think the whole experience was wonderful  and<br/>
learning for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
I just wish I wasn&#39;t so wimpy.  While they were down there watching him be put<br/>
down, I&#39;m in the house crying.  Seems backward somehow  :)<br/>
But, I guess we are all different.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ann, of course we are all different. the kids dont have the baggage we do<br/>
about death. and they probably miss him too but not in the same way. they<br/>
are more likely to take it as a okay , this is life. I think that is<br/>
because they ahve the support and unconditional love of a good parent. I<br/>
didnt and that ade it harder.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852903452">I had lots of support as a kid, but have always been SO emotional.  I can stand in<br/>
an airport and watch people leaving each other....people I don&#39;t know...and cry!<br/>
Then aren&#39;t even crying, but I do.<br/>
Parting has always been trauma for me  :)   I can hardly do still.  And I still cry<br/>
and cry.  I think I inherited this emotional stuff from my Dad...he was like this,<br/>
except not quite to bad.  You should have seen the two of us at my wedding.  What a<br/>
mess we were!  Hee.... Hee.....<br/>

understand even more about what life and death mean and put it into the <br/>
perspective of people also die.  (how was that for a run-on sentence?!)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have done the same thing.<br/>
