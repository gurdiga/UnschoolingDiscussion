<div id="ygrps-yiv-281214681">I am posting this for a friend who is editor of Vegetarian Baby and<br/>
Child magazine (for which I am the new Book Review Editor).  This is for<br/>
a new web site and could be a great experience for teen writers.<br/>

*******************<br/>
Calling all veg teens (and tweens!) - VegetarianTeen.com is looking for<br/>
young writers to share their ideas on topics related to vegetarianism<br/>
including (but not limited to!) animal rights, activism, nutrition,<br/>
dealing<br/>
with family, peer pressure, cruelty-free living, eco-decor, volunteering<br/>
and<br/>
more. We also present book, music and product reviews for our readers,<br/>
so<br/>
contact us even if you are interested only in doing reviews. Last, but<br/>
not<br/>
least, we do interviews with authors, athletes, and celebrities, so this<br/>
is<br/>
your chance to interview a famous vegetarian! Writing for VT.com is a<br/>
great<br/>
opportunity to get published, and we fully support your privacy. All<br/>
under<br/>
18&#39;s require a parental consent form. Please contact<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:editor@...">editor@...</a>  or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:interviews@...">interviews@...</a> specifically<br/>
to<br/>
be included on the interview list.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to hearing from you!<br/>
<br/>
