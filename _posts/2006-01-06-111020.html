<div id="ygrps-yiv-850960287">I was wondering if anyone had any information about this year&#39;s <br/>
conference? I remember hearing something about it being in Sandra&#39;s <br/>
neck of the woods- Albuquerque (sp?). What month will it take place <br/>
in? Is it always in October or does it move around? If it is in the <br/>
big &quot;A&quot; that would be great for me. I have family there and it would <br/>
make a great trip. This would be our first time at any conference, and <br/>
I feel like it would be a real needed experience for all of us. I <br/>
would like to start planning now.<br/>
Thanks in advance for the info.<br/>

When Kelly has fancy details she&#39;ll put them at the Live and Learn  <br/>
site.  This page was first created so I could show Kelly photos of  <br/>
the hotel, but I added stuff on either end (dates up top, more  <br/>
Albuquerque links and links to photos of the 2005 conference below.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not at all the official conference page, but I&#39;ll sure link to  <br/>
the official page as soon as it starts having more info about 2006  <br/>
(which should be by March but probably not sooner).<br/>

It&#39;s usually in late summer/early fall. It mostly depnds on where it&#39;s held and what&#39;s going on in that <br/>
area at the time. (In SC we had to work around college football games; in NM it&#39;s balloon fest and the state<br/>
fair!)<br/>
 <br/>
THis year it&#39;s Albuquerque, NM, September 5-11, 2006.<br/>
