<div id="ygrps-yiv-832287921">This was sparked by the request for goals by a grandparent: (I hope this <br/>
works for you MamaBeth!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m part of a women&#39;s peace circle and the kids have often expressed their <br/>
dismay at not being included... we&#39;ve decided to have our own at home.  We light <br/>
a candle, say our *prayer* (It is a blessing to be, It is a blessing to be <br/>
here, It is a blessing to be here now, It is a blessing to be here now <br/>
together), and do five times around the circle: <br/>
1) I feel peaceful when... [end with *I am a peacemaker* group responds *Yes, <br/>
&lt;name&gt; you ARE a peacemaker*]<br/>
2) Peace for me would be... [end with *I am a peacemaker* group responds <br/>
*Yes, &lt;name&gt; you ARE a peacemaker*]<br/>
3) My courageous act of peacemaking was... [end with *I am a peacemaker* <br/>
group responds *Yes, &lt;name&gt; you ARE a peacemaker]<br/>
4) I commit to _________ as my courageous act of peacemaking... [end with *I <br/>
am a peacemaker* group responds *We support you in your courageous act of <br/>
peacemaking*]<br/>
5) One word to sum up your present state.  <br/>
Then we do another reading or recitation or family cheer, and blow out the <br/>
candle together.  <br/>
The kids&#39; acts of peacemaking were wonderful ~ Hannah&#39;s vowed to reduce her <br/>
Hayden torture, Hayden&#39;s vowed to hug us every day, and I&#39;ve vowed to think <br/>
before I scream &lt;beg&gt; We have a lot of fun with it, I hope you do too!  <br/>

&quot;Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocre minds. The <br/>
latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to <br/>
hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.&quot; ~ Albert <br/>
