&gt;Gosh, you really did have a horrible time in school.  I guess I was lucky, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too.  I hated school with a passion.  I had terrible problems with peers<br/>
which caused a number of traumas for me.  Including a boy (who had been<br/>
held back 3 grades) molesting me in elementary school.  I was beat up in<br/>
summer school on several occasions by boys, and had several really bad<br/>
teachers in a row in middle school.  In general the atmosphere was of crowd<br/>
and damage control.  If you were not a trouble maker but had academic<br/>
problems (like me) you were pretty much ignored.  I did well on tests and<br/>
some academic areas (things I enjoyed or excelled at) but got no help for<br/>
my problem areas.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew three girls in middle school (11-13) who were alcholholics and used<br/>
to get drunk in the school yard at lunch.  Another girl I knew was pregnant<br/>
by the end of 8th grade.  I went to a HS in the worst neighborhhod in my<br/>
city.  There were blood stains on the lockers because kids were stabbing<br/>
each other in the hallways.  Going into the schoolyard during lunch was<br/>
like taking your life into your hands.  I had to get rides from friends out<br/>
of the neighborhood in order to catch a city bus home from a safe<br/>
neighborhood, as there were crack dealers with automatic weapons at the bus<br/>
stops, and gangs riding the buses.  No lie.<br/>
<br/>
School was a challenge to my survival on a daily basis.  My emotional<br/>
survival and my physical survival.  Education was something that happened<br/>
at home where I was safe, in my own time.  I remember very little that I<br/>
ever &quot;learned&quot; in school.<br/>

&gt;School was a challenge to my survival on a daily basis.  My emotional<br/>
&gt;survival and my physical survival.  Education was something that happened<br/>
&gt;at home where I was safe, in my own time.  I remember very little that I<br/>
&gt;ever &quot;learned&quot; in school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What a terrible experience you had, Nanci!<br/>
<br/>
Even when schooling doesn&#39;t include violence to our bodies, it does to our<br/>
minds. The &quot;best&quot; school in a district still has pack-based peer<br/>
socialization, enforced curriculum, testing and grading, and a student body<br/>
hopeless with the knowledge that they are literal prisoners, there is no way<br/>
out for the vast majority of these kids until they&#39;ve served their time.<br/>
<br/>
It is always really interesting to me to read about unschooled children who<br/>
decide, for one reason or another, to try out school. It&#39;s incredible what a<br/>
different experience they have, and because of one simple, basic change:<br/>
they know that they can leave any time and return to unschooling. They are<br/>
completely free to say, &quot;Well, that&#39;s been enough of that, I&#39;m done with<br/>
school,&quot; and walk out. AND WALK OUT! Think back to our schooling. Can you<br/>
even begin to IMAGINE what that &quot;I can walk out anytime I want!&quot; would have<br/>
*felt* like???<br/>
<br/>
In that way, I almost think that such unschoolers attending school are<br/>
*still* unschooling (in the same way I think it&#39;s still unschooling even if<br/>
the child happens to be choosing to read her way through a stack of<br/>
textbooks that week). It&#39;s the *choice* part, the freedom that almost every<br/>
other schooled child lacks, that is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s why I think you can&#39;t &quot;unschool everything except math&quot;. If you take<br/>
away educational freedom, even &quot;just&quot; for one thing, it&#39;s gone. Force is<br/>
force. Heck, IMHO bribery is less damaging by far (&quot;Look, Hortensia, I am<br/>
really bothered because you don&#39;t know your multiplication tables and I feel<br/>
like a bad parent. To humor me, I&#39;d like you to sit down with me every day<br/>
and learn them for 20 minutes. In exchange, I&#39;ll buy you a pack of Pokemon<br/>
cards when you can fill out the 10 x 10 grid, okay?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
At least that&#39;s a fair deal with negotiating room on both sides. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister never wanted to homeschool her kids. She was always there before<br/>
school and after school and she was down at the school helping more often than<br/>
not, but she didn&#39;t want to homeschool (she was always supportive to me though).<br/>
One year, one of her daughters had a major personality clash with a teacher (who<br/>
had been one of the older daughter&#39;s favourite teachers). Nothing abusive - they<br/>
just didn&#39;t get on, couldn&#39;t relate to each other (my niece is very smart - and<br/>
very stubborn / assertive &lt;g&gt;). It got so bad, my sister told her daughter that<br/>
she could come home if she wanted. Well, she didn&#39;t come home, and suddenly<br/>
school wasn&#39;t so bad, and she and the teacher came to a better understanding of<br/>
each other, though it was never a comfortable relationship. But my sister told<br/>
me, she firmly believed that it was the knowledge that she COULD leave that<br/>
enable the child to cope with the situation.<br/>

   You really had a horrible experience in school!  I can only imagine what <br/>
it must have felt like.  Another thing (of the MANY) that makes me mad about <br/>
public schools is that they make kids be there and then they aren&#39;t even <br/>
responsible enough to at least make sure they are in a safe (mentally and <br/>
physically) situation.  Your experiences were some of the worst I&#39;ve ever <br/>
heard but even in the so-called good schools, things go on which will scar <br/>
some kids for life.<br/>
    My dad works at a middle school in a very affluent suburb of San Diego <br/>
and he can&#39;t believe some of the things that go on.  Examples:  a Chinese <br/>
girl whose parents had her in a private school in Taiwan apparently thought <br/>
it was unnecessary now with the &quot;good school&quot; available.  She has a habit of <br/>
picking up pennies all the time and a group of popular boys noticed it and <br/>
thought it was weird.  They started throwing pennies at her all the time, <br/>
making fun of her, etc.  When my dad tried to reason with the boys about how <br/>
mean it was, they joked about it and didn&#39;t stop.  When my dad talked to the <br/>
vice principal about it, the V.P. said that he himself thought the girl was <br/>
kind of weird.  End of conversation.  The girl is always alone, no friends.  <br/>
In addition to the bad effects this has on the girl, it sure isn&#39;t doing much <br/>
to help those boys grow up to be the kind of people we need in our <br/>
communities.<br/>
    This is just one small example.  My dad has a new story every week or <br/>
more about this kind of stuff.  I was already pretty burned out on public <br/>
schools when we moved back to Calfornia almost two years ago, but hearing my <br/>
dad&#39;s stories in the trenches of the system has really solidified my feelings <br/>
against them.  There are good people in the system, trying to help kids, but <br/>
the system itself is so flawed that the bad always seem to far outweigh the <br/>
good.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Pam, if your niece never had that choice she could have ended up with<br/>
&gt;&quot;learned helplessness&quot;.   I don&#39;t know if psychologists have &#39;studied this<br/>
&gt;phenomenon in humans.....I only remember animal studies showing that when in<br/>
&gt;a punishing situation with no avenue for escape,  the subject essentially<br/>
&gt;gives up trying.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, it wasn&#39;t my niece (you&#39;d snipped two segments :), but...<br/>
<br/>
...learned helplessness is, as you say, a definite danger. I well remember<br/>
the study I read on dogs when I was a dog trainer.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING TO GENTLER SOULS, READ NO FURTHER.<br/>
<br/>
They took a series of dogs and put them on a metal plate in a square area<br/>
with no exits. They began shocking the dogs (electrically) and of course<br/>
each dog would run around desperately trying to get off the hot plate, to no<br/>
avail. The dogs tried *really* hard, including spectacular feats of jumping,<br/>
digging, etc. No way out.<br/>
<br/>
Next day, they took the same dogs, did the same thing, same response.<br/>
<br/>
At some point (I don&#39;t remember how many days), they would put the dogs into<br/>
the room, and the dogs would simply sit down or lay down, utterly defeated,<br/>
and let themselves be shocked without resistance.<br/>
<br/>
The day after each dog &quot;gave up&quot;, they put the dog in the square room, but<br/>
this time, major difference: they left a CLEAR AND OBVIOUS EXIT (the same<br/>
door they would take the dogs in and out every day to get into the room).<br/>
<br/>
None of the dogs, when the electrical shocks began, attempted to escape.<br/>
None.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s learned helplessness. That&#39;s what at least some kids in school are<br/>
feeling, probably many, maybe most.<br/>

I as a parent of ps kids felt that way and still do about the one still in. <br/>
When we experience injustice with the school I feel helpless because I know <br/>
how little if anything we can do to change what&#39;s going on or help ourselves. <br/>
This new zero tolerance thing is way overboard. Ridiculous in many instances.<br/>
