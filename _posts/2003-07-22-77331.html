 <br/>
&gt;P.S. AA alert- a friend pointed out to me that there&#39;s a lot of alcohol in<br/>
&gt;Rescue Remedy, and she had been avoiding it for that reason. She didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;realize that you can dab it on topically and it will work just as well.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Marji, <br/>
Thank you for that tip!  I had to stop taking my allergy drops because of<br/>
the alcohol content.  I still haven&#39;t found anything to replace those drops.<br/>
 The ADHD drops also have alcohol in them, but they work really well for my<br/>
daughter.  And as she has gotten older, we seldom need to use them.<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>

for babies, of course).  I found a great distraction was to squirt it in the <br/>
belly button ~ a tickle and a *chill* &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208106288">Okay it&#39;s either some of the bickering on this list or my incredibly evil<br/>
not going away headache for 3 days but I was actually looking forward to the<br/>
posts with this subject. I thought it was an abbreviation for what would<br/>
work as a rescue remedy for me right about now. I was reading it as<br/>
marijuana. &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
