&lt;&lt; You mean you think *I* will have lovely memories?<br/>
 (I&#39;m looking forward to the possibility.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I meant for you too, not just the rest of us. :)<br/>
No morphine, hospital, scary memories this year, just happy, bubbly, <br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
