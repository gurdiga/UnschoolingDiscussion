<div id="ygrps-yiv-494993862">Yes, Joyce, you are right I probably wasn&#39;t as clear as I could have been<br/>
about how the list worked and how it came about.  I also, probably<br/>
overstated the results of what the &#39;penalties&#39; are.  They are not really<br/>
punishments, they are just realities.  For example, if Rachel is not a<br/>
well functioning human being, she can not borrow the car.  I wouldn&#39;t let<br/>
her take it if she were drunk either.  The list just helps us monitor it.<br/>
<br/>
As for HOW MUCH it is more HOW MUCH will get me to overlook the weeds<br/>
growing out of the sidewalk this week?  It really is a trade off.     <br/>
<br/>
And I probably was not clear enough up front about how the list came<br/>
about.  But then if you check one of my recent posts, you may understand<br/>
me better.<br/>
<br/>
Also you said:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She could write tosome students at the colleges she&#39;s thinking of and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*ask* how much writing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;is involved. (Colleges generally have some students who volunteer to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>host others.) <br/>
<br/>
So, you don&#39;t consider my opinion or my husband&#39;s valid even though I was<br/>
a student at her chosen college as recently as two years ago and he<br/>
graduated less than 5 years ago?  Funny, she considers our opinions<br/>
valid.  Well, that and what she WATCHED me doing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bridget, your clarifications have helped me to understand better what <br/>
happens in your family.  But why did you have to jump on her about <br/>
this?  It was a suggestion.  Nobody says you have to take someone&#39;s <br/>
suggestion.  Besides which, she might like knowing someone who is going <br/>
there when she starts.<br/>
