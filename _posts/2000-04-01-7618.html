&lt;&lt;  We just started unschooling about<br/>
 three weeks ago. I have made feeble attempts at it in the past but  have<br/>
 had a hard time turning over the reigns of control.  Ok, Ok, I&#39;m still<br/>
 struggling with that one but am learning to trust my children more<br/>
 everyday.  I&#39;ve read all of John Holts books subscribe to GWS and HEM<br/>
 and believe in the homeschooling or natural learning philosophy with al<br/>
 of my being, but believing and doing are to totally different things.<br/>
 So here we are now trying to put legs to our beliefs.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Hi Kyle,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not an unschooling dad, but I really relate to what you said.  We began <br/>
homeschooling last August, and I started out doing school at home and being <br/>
way too structured.  Everyone was upset and tense.  Fortunately, with a great <br/>
deal of help from our support teacher at Clonlara, we have evolved into an <br/>
eclectic/bordering on unschooling approach.  Wonderful things are happening, <br/>
and we are all much happier.<br/>
<br/>
I have always been an unschooler at heart, I suppose, but as a teacher was <br/>
too entrenched in mainstream educational thinking.  Letting go is a really <br/>
powerful thing, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831940473">Dear David,  I taught here in Southern Indiana for  a total of about 10 yrs.  <br/>
The majority being at a private, Catholic school.  Since it was not public <br/>
school, would you still want the info for the book?  I will be glad to write <br/>
you about anything related to my experiences as a teacher.  Also, would you <br/>
prefer me to email you directly, since this could be a lengthy amount of <br/>
material?                                   Karen</div>

Thanks for joining us.  And thanks for writing this.  I&#39;m glad to know others <br/>
that have struggled putting &quot;legs to their beliefs.&quot;  My hubby and I have <br/>
gone through similar thought process struggles and are finally trying to <br/>
unschool and parent the way we really want our kids to be raised.<br/>
I&#39;m not a homedad, but wanted to welcome you anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Take care-<br/>
