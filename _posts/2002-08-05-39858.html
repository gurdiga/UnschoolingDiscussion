that Sandra is pulling everyone&#39;s leg here.<br/>
<br/>
This list exists, after all, because we do not accept the government school<br/>
culture of dishonesty, corruption and coercion.  We have broken away, each<br/>
with our own reasons, instead of resigning to an attitude of *acceptance*.<br/>
<br/>
On this subject, I&#39;m fond of a quote from the English writer, G. K.<br/>
Chesterton (1874-1936):  * If tolerance is your main virtue, you have no<br/>
others.*...in other words, as someone else said,  *If you don&#39;t stand for<br/>
something, you&#39;ll fall for anything.* Accepting the public schools would<br/>
require falling for everything...the schools actually count on that.<br/>
<br/>
The government schools create a situation of incredible disharmony for<br/>
everyone, parents and children, mostly because it is one-size-fits-all, and<br/>
therefore is right for only a tiny minority of its caged prisoners and their<br/>
families. Whereas homeschooling has infinite variety and is therefore<br/>
accomodating for everyone who wants it whether or not we agree with each<br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
What disharmony we have here is nothing compared to what public school<br/>
parents and children suffer every day<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sentiment is straight out of the government school propaganda and<br/>
actual teaching methods which stress group thinking, called consensus. It&#39;s<br/>
the part that agrees with Socialist philosophy, saying that the group is<br/>
more important than the individual.<br/>
<br/>
America -- I say America, son  -- is different from all the countries that<br/>
came before it, largely because of the fact that it (we) put the individual<br/>
before the collective.    If harmony happens as a result of increasing our<br/>
knowledge, fine, but if it occurs as a result of mincing our words, what<br/>
good is it, but the absence of disharmony. All I ask for is honesty. I&#39;ll<br/>
try to give the same.<br/>

There are many states that make school attendance compulsory, but there are<br/>

compulsory. What effect does either situation have? Apparently, none...all<br/>
of them are terrible. For me, saying no is just fine ?^)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks. In light of our recent teaching/learning discussions here, this <br/>
statement of hers really hit home for me.<br/>
<br/>
Casey does SO many things that people would have no trouble categorizing for <br/>
school report purposes. She reads, writes, creates museums and home <br/>
businesses, volunteers at the library, does twice weekly gymnastics and <br/>
makes so many &quot;projects&quot; it&#39;s hard for me to keep up. And it&#39;s all without <br/>
lessons or prodding or being in any way influenced by the schoolish shoulds. <br/>
I help her when she asks, in the manner she would like me to help. I mostly <br/>
get out of her way. Am I using good ol&#39; American teachin&#39; methods with her? <br/>
I dunno. But it&#39;s working. And to her it is literally ALL play.<br/>
<br/>
My son Conor is equally amazing and yet not at all &quot;showy&quot; in his learning <br/>
and activities like his sister. He&#39;s still shaking off those 4 years of PS <br/>
teaching and discovering his true passion for learning. Still he reads, <br/>
volunteers at the Children&#39;s Museum, asks a million questions and hopefully <br/>
gets a million answers. Oh and he&#39;s becoming the master of computer gaming <br/>
warfare apparently. :-/<br/>

rigid and stifling of kids than the public schools - they often have the <br/>
worst curriculum - just boring boring boring workbooks - the same identical <br/>
stupid workbooks for every child in the class. Most of the public schools in <br/>
my area are much more inviting and stimulating and interesting than private <br/>
schools --- which isn&#39;t saying much.<br/>
<br/>
But - my point is that it isn&#39;t the &#39;funding source&#39; of the school that I <br/>
object to or that John Holt was writing about - it isn&#39;t because the public <br/>
schools are government-schools. My objections to &quot;schooling&quot; are just as much <br/>
relevant to private schools and to parents who use similar or even worse <br/>
method on their own kids at home.<br/>

he wants or a days itinerary, he rarley writes more than that.  My <br/>
almost 12yo didn&#39;t start writing til about 8yo and now she writes <br/>
poety and journals and occasional letters.  My 5yo is just starting <br/>
to really notice letters and words.<br/>
My kids mostly find all kinds of stuff to do all day long.  I don&#39;t <br/>
find a lot of opportunity to get in things I would like to do with <br/>
them.  All of the cool resources we have here go untouched because <br/>
they are busy involved in their own creations.<br/>
My biggest input is taking them places(the <br/>
beach,pool,sports,scouts,museums,parks,friends houses.....) and <br/>
having lots of cool conversations about all kinds of different <br/>
things.  With 4 kids there is an endless amount of questions asked <br/>
and ideas pondered.<br/>
I take those conversations and use them in my quest for resouces and <br/>
usually find library books or other things to expand on an interest.<br/>
Sometimes a google search, but they don&#39;t always want to take it that <br/>
far.  Lots of things never make it past a breif conversation.  But I <br/>
don&#39;t worry, there is always more to come!<br/>

Yes, it&#39;s part of the schooling mindset to be worried that they aren&#39;t doing<br/>
something that resembles something they&#39;d do in school. And that mindset<br/>
*is* tough to work out of. Recognizing it is one step. But it&#39;s just one<br/>
step so don&#39;t feel badly if all the schoolishness doesn&#39;t just fall away<br/>
because you&#39;ve discovered unschooling. :-) It can take years and lots and<br/>
lots of reading and doing and asking questions.<br/>
<br/>
The learning isn&#39;t in the writing or the historical novel or the science<br/>
experiment. It&#39;s in asking questions and being curious and diving into<br/>
things to mess around. :-) And that can come from a video game as readily as<br/>
it comes from a science book. It&#39;s just whatever they happen to be<br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
You can make writing part of their lives so they can take it up (or not)<br/>
when they find it meaningful will help. You can offer to write down their<br/>
stories. Make them into books and perhaps illustrate them. (By hand or on<br/>
the computer or with images from the internet or how ever!) Encourage them<br/>
to add to shopping lists and make lists of stuff to bring on vacation. (Or<br/>
you do the writing for them. Getting stuck on the idea that they need to do<br/>
the physical part of the writing for them to be writing can set them back if<br/>
they find the physical part difficult.) Email friends. (Even though my<br/>
daughter (11) loves to write, she still finds physically writing difficult<br/>
and isn&#39;t much into emails that are more than a sentence or two.) Write<br/>
scavenger hunt notes and they&#39;ll probably want to write their own for you.<br/>
You just need to make the opportunities available so they have access to the<br/>
tools when they need them.<br/>
<br/>
The point I&#39;m trying to make is that making them write shopping lists or<br/>
scavenger hunt notes won&#39;t turn them into writers. It will probably give<br/>
them the idea that writing is something to be avoided. But if they enjoy the<br/>
process of adding to a shopping list, or sending an email to Grandma, or<br/>
doing anything they enjoy or find useful that gives them the idea that<br/>
writing is a useful tool.<br/>

&gt;to add to shopping lists and make lists of stuff to bring on vacation. (Or<br/>
&gt;you do the writing for them. Getting stuck on the idea that they need to do<br/>
&gt;the physical part of the writing for them to be writing can set them back <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;they find the physical part difficult.) Email friends. (Even though my<br/>
&gt;daughter (11) loves to write, she still finds physically writing difficult<br/>
&gt;and isn&#39;t much into emails that are more than a sentence or two.) Write<br/>
&gt;scavenger hunt notes and they&#39;ll probably want to write their own for you.<br/>
&gt;You just need to make the opportunities available so they have access to <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;tools when they need them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The point I&#39;m trying to make is that making them write shopping lists or<br/>
&gt;scavenger hunt notes won&#39;t turn them into writers. It will probably give<br/>
&gt;them the idea that writing is something to be avoided. But if they enjoy <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;process of adding to a shopping list, or sending an email to Grandma, or<br/>
&gt;doing anything they enjoy or find useful that gives them the idea that<br/>
&gt;writing is a useful tool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344002418">thanks joanna-<br/>
that was very helpful...i do things very similarly- so i guess we&#39;re doing <br/>
just fine.as a christian, i find unschooling a great test of faith-certainly <br/>
to stay out of god&#39;s way so my children can become who he intended them to <br/>
be -not who i intend them to be! it&#39;s so reassuring for me, just in the two <br/>
days i&#39;ve been talking on this list with you guys- an answered prayer!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;I have 2 boys 8 and 5, and while my 8 yo will make lists, of things<br/>
&gt;he wants or a days itinerary, he rarley writes more than that.  My<br/>
&gt;almost 12yo didn&#39;t start writing til about 8yo and now she writes<br/>
&gt;poety and journals and occasional letters.  My 5yo is just starting<br/>
&gt;to really notice letters and words.<br/>
&gt;My kids mostly find all kinds of stuff to do all day long.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;find a lot of opportunity to get in things I would like to do with<br/>
&gt;them.  All of the cool resources we have here go untouched because<br/>
&gt;they are busy involved in their own creations.<br/>
&gt;My biggest input is taking them places(the<br/>
&gt;beach,pool,sports,scouts,museums,parks,friends houses.....) and<br/>
&gt;having lots of cool conversations about all kinds of different<br/>
&gt;things.  With 4 kids there is an endless amount of questions asked<br/>
&gt;and ideas pondered.<br/>
&gt;I take those conversations and use them in my quest for resouces and<br/>
&gt;usually find library books or other things to expand on an interest.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes a google search, but they don&#39;t always want to take it that<br/>
&gt;far.  Lots of things never make it past a breif conversation.  But I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t worry, there is always more to come!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-3873214">I used to worry about my now 5 year old son.  He&#39;s not a rough, over-<br/>
active, very physical-activity oriented boy.  He doesn&#39;t like to get <br/>
dirty.  He likes stuffed animals.  While other boys are wrestling in <br/>
the dirt, he&#39;ll be sitting philosophizing about how the nearby fence <br/>
was built or why the sun is where it is in the sky at that time of <br/>
the day.  He likes to make up songs and stories.  Professional <br/>
wrestling and football probably wouldn&#39;t interest him, but he loves <br/>
the art museum.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to worry, but now I&#39;m very comfortable with the fact that all <br/>
kids are different, that&#39;s all. <br/>
<br/>
Some young boys will write stories, some will play tackle football.  <br/>
Whatever your kids do, just appreciate who God made them to be.   <br/>
