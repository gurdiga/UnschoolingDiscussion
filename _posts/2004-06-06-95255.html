&gt; The &quot;no&quot; that is a problem is when the cookies are sitting right there and<br/>
&gt; the mom says no.  It&#39;s impossible for a child to eat what&#39;s not there, so<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not the same kind of &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s different, and my kids do to.  Even when Stella (4) groans about<br/>
it, I can tell she is just expressing her dissapointment about not having<br/>
any, and isn&#39;t really mad at me for saying no.<br/>
<br/>
I still feel badly about having to say no in this situation, though, and if<br/>
I&#39;m not careful, that bad feeling turns outward towards the kids.  I&#39;ve<br/>
recently become more aware of how my feelings of guilt and inadequacy can<br/>
hurt them.  When I have to say no to ice cream because our car is still<br/>
broken and the ice cream will melt on the bus ride home, or  because I just<br/>
can&#39;t afford something as basic as more butter to make cookies until next<br/>
week, it is so frustrating!   I feel so lame and I defensively lash out at<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that now that I am taking the time to more closely examine my own<br/>
angry feelings, instead of letting them consume me so much,  I can see a<br/>
possible end to this vicious cycle.    Yesterday was hell for me as far as<br/>
feeling like such a total needy, lame, unable-to-provide parent.  I know it<br/>
made made my husband feel pretty shitty too--probably worse than me, because<br/>
he is the income-provider and definitely takes his percieved, and actual<br/>
role as our protector pretty seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my 3 yo baby girl, Annie, falls down on a rusty nail and punctures<br/>
her knee fairly deeply.  I call Ron in Portland to tell him, and we both<br/>
agree that she needs a tetanus shot (we opted out of vaccinations early on<br/>
with plans to do tetanus later when they were old enough to do play in dirt<br/>
and stuff and possibly get hurt in just the way Annie did--only we just<br/>
hadn&#39;t gotten around to it yet--bad, bad, bad).  Well, my car is broken, so<br/>
it&#39;s the bus.  The next one would go by my house at 5:30, only a 1/2 hour<br/>
away.  Problem is there is only 10 minutes from when I get to the hospital<br/>
15-20 miles down the peninsula to when the next and final bus going towards<br/>
my home goes by the hospital.  I have no cash...just checks, and my new<br/>
debit card is being sent in the mail, so a taxi, would not only be<br/>
expensive, but I don&#39;t really have a way to pay for one.  Oh well,  the ER<br/>
doctor says it would be much better if we come in right away rather than<br/>
wait for morning.  Says they&#39;ll be quick so we can catch that return bus.<br/>
He&#39;s really nice, but I still get a 10 minute lecture about how important it<br/>
is to vaccinate.  Turns out they&#39;re out of the vaccine and have to get send<br/>
someone to Astoria (another 1/2 hour or so away) to get some more.  So it<br/>
looks like a cab now.   Maybe they&#39;ll take a check.  The kids are now<br/>
hungry, as it&#39;s past dinner time, and we are going to be waiting awhile, so<br/>
I start to ask if there is a store or restaurant nearby, when I remember<br/>
that I wrote out my last check at the grocery store the day before and<br/>
forgot to put a new book of checks in my wallet!  OMG...I can&#39;t feed them<br/>
AND I can&#39;t pay even a portion of the cost to go to the ER and get a vaccine<br/>
AND I can&#39;t get a cab home!    Luckily the staff at this hospital are the<br/>
nicest bunch of people you ever want to meet. They tell me no problem, we<br/>
can work out arrangements after you get the bill, and we have someone here<br/>
who can bring you all home.  So poor Annie gets her first shot ever,<br/>
shocking me with her bravery, and we finally head for home.  On the way<br/>
home, I ask our driver, a nurse, if I can break an adult tylenol in half for<br/>
Annie, because I can&#39;t get to a store for any children&#39;s tylenol, and Annie<br/>
is really starting to feel bad with the very sore knee and now a shot in the<br/>
arm.  Nurse says I shouldn&#39;t and stops at her sister&#39;s house to get some<br/>
tylenol for me.  It&#39;s 9:30 at night and I&#39;m so embarrased, but relieved.<br/>
Once we get home, I make some macaroni and cheese at Annie&#39;s request and we<br/>
all sit on the floor and watch The Comfy Couch--another Annie request.  And<br/>
Sarah (10) and Stella are being so sweet to Annie, and so helpful with Evan<br/>
(just turned 1), while I take care of Annie&#39;s knee and get her ready for<br/>
bed.  How&#39;d I get so lucky.  They&#39;re all so precious.<br/>
<br/>
I told this story not because it was cathartic (although it was!), but<br/>
because I felt so many feelings of inadequacy yesterday during all of this.<br/>
Still, I didn&#39;t lose it.  Not once.  I breathed.  I was thankful for the<br/>
kindess of strangers.  I played games with the kids.  I was mindful and<br/>
loving toward my children and we all benefitted.  Now I&#39;ve done this before<br/>
when something big required me to have it together (I tend to sweat small<br/>
stuff more than big stuff), but this time I was fully aware that I was<br/>
making a difference in how we would all feel at the end of the day.  I<br/>
wanted my children to feel as secure as I could make them feel under the<br/>
circumstances.  I acted like an adult, despite the childish feelings of<br/>
inadequacy and guilt that normally make me behave like a 2 year old.   And<br/>
at the end of the day, my children and I felt so happy and safe and loved.<br/>
It was delicious.<br/>
<br/>
It is more clear to me than ever that if I just apply that kind of<br/>
mindfulness and love to the small stuff  that makes up more of our daily<br/>
life, then we will be doing beautifully!  Who cares about a messy house or<br/>
no butter for cookies, when you have such precious gifts who love you<br/>
despite your shortcomings and just want you to be with them while they<br/>
discover the world?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m impressed.  I&#39;d&#39;ve been really, truly frustrated and might not have <br/>
handled it nearly so gracefully as you did!<br/>
<br/>
That was HOURS of stress, and you rode it!?  Thanks for telling us about it.  <br/>
It&#39;s an inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
I hope Annie&#39;s fine.  Sometimes the place where a tenanus shot goes hurts <br/>
more than the nail puncture, I think.<br/>

<br/>
I did ride it out, and I &#39;m glad because it needed to be done for sure.   It<br/>
would not have been helpful at all to get bound up in tears or to snap at<br/>
them  or mutter to myself when they started getting hungry and impatient.<br/>
And I think that they bore it all so much better than if I had been more<br/>
caught up in the stress than in the moment with them.  It was great to<br/>
really be with them, so that we, for instance, noticed and wondered about<br/>
all the medical equipment, and I explained what some were and we guessed<br/>
about others.  Some of their guesses were really funny.  The heart rate<br/>
monitor screen was &quot;a tv for little kids to watch a dvd, in case they&#39;re<br/>
scared...or just bored,&quot;  said Stella.  They were all delighted when the<br/>
doctor took Annie&#39;s heart rate and they could &quot;see&quot; it pumping on the<br/>
screen--a little red heart flashing off and on.  Annie, who was afraid of<br/>
him, started grinning ear to ear.  They had lots of questions too about the<br/>
hospital environment and people, having never been to one before (my last<br/>
two were born at home, even.)  Their questions were so interesting, because<br/>
if you listened you got a real sense of what&#39;s important to them.<br/>
<br/>
But what I really want to take away from this is the truth that this<br/>
mindfulness and calming breath can help me with  life&#39;s daily little<br/>
aggravations and dissappointments.  I hope to get alot better at that, so<br/>
that more of our time together can be so<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I hope Annie&#39;s fine.  Sometimes the place where a tenanus shot goes hurts<br/>
more than the nail puncture, I think.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s fine.  The knee got really stiff and sore so that she had some trouble<br/>
walking on it, but it is better.  So far no complaints about the shot!<br/>
Thanks for asking.<br/>

********************************<br/>
So you held it together AND made an &quot;unschooling&quot; day of it at the same <br/>
time...LoL...you rock!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been where you are, ready to just lose it, and I myself am getting so <br/>
much better at breathing, thinking, calming...letting things go...Just being <br/>
where I am at that moment and not thinking of the 10 things I wanted to <br/>
accomplish that aren&#39;t getting done.  <br/>
<br/>
This may sound morbid, but what has helped me, is to think about dying.  Will <br/>
I care whether I had a pretty, perfect garden when I&#39;m on my death bed?  Will <br/>
I care whether I got my point across during an argument, or whether I got <br/>
that degree or logged in enough hours volunteering??  I want to be remembered as <br/>
someone that cared, someone that was thoughtful and kind.  I want my kids to <br/>
think of me as someone who built them up, lifted them up, not someone who <br/>
reminded them of their faults, or how they were falling short of MY expectations.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really happy for you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602049628">This is something that is in my mind too.<br/>
My Dad died 10 years ago.  My oldest was only 2 months old at the time.<br/>
<br/>
This event in my life changed me....<br/>
That weekend we knew my Dad was going to die.  I have always thought, what if I was lying there?  What would be important to me?  A clean house?  Clean laundry?<br/>
What would really be important???  <br/>
Being with the people I love.  Telling people in my life what they have meant and what they do mean to me.<br/>
I guess my priorities were put in order.  <br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t slip into those silly thoughts, but it has sure helped me live in the moment as much as I can.<br/>

Others have mentioned this as well, and it makes since, even if it is<br/>

<br/>
Another suggestion that I have tried, with good success, is to pretend I do<br/>
have a witness--a friend who would be hurt to see me have a temper tantrum<br/>
in front of my children.  Very effective trick, I have to say!  Also, it has<br/>
been easier since I asked my kids to remind me to breathe when I seem like<br/>
I&#39;m losing my temper.  They haven&#39;t had to remind me yet, and I think it&#39;s<br/>
because I know THEY are watching, and also because on second thought, I&#39;m<br/>
not sure I want them to feel so responsible for me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the encouragement!  And good luck to you too.<br/>

I like to imagine Sandra or Ren or Kelly or Pam, or some of the other people<br/>
I met at the conference last year - not only as a witness which really<br/>
helps, but also thinking &quot;what might they do/say at his moment?&quot; - (most<br/>

Thanks, Robin, for including me in that list! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
A trick I used when grooming dogs was to imagine that I was on &quot;Candid  <br/>
Camera&quot;----that there was some camera hidden somewhere.<br/>
It&#39;s easy to lose your temper when you&#39;ve been snarled and snapped at  <br/>
repeatedly; it&#39;s August (in SC!), and the temperature&#39;s rising to over 100  degrees; <br/>
you&#39;re 20 minutes behind; and that little MONSTER won&#39;t let you cut  that <br/>
last damned nail!<br/>
Step back. Breathe deeply. And---------SMILE, you&#39;re on Candid  Camera!<br/>
It made it easier to smile and to quietly and gently finish the job.<br/>
I&#39;d hate for my imaginary camera to catch me totally freaking out! Or  worse, <br/>
hitting that dog, which can&#39;t fight back much---and is totally subject to  my <br/>
whims and moods. He&#39;s not even able to go inside and tell his owner that I&#39;ve <br/>
 been a bitch. Is that the way I&#39;d like someone to treat MY dog? Plus----what <br/>
if  the owner *really* had a camera positioned right outside her kitchen  <br/>
window?????? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Candid Camera. On me at all times.<br/>
I may be *thinking* all sorts of evil thoughts----but you won&#39;t &quot;catch&quot; me  <br/>
doing any of them! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Me too.<br/>
I tell myself, &quot;OH, and you give advice, you hypocritical thing.  BREATHE!&quot; <br/>
and then I breathe and apologize.  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see...<br/>
Sunday my neighbor called and was mean to me on the phone and hung up on me, <br/>
because one of Marty&#39;s friends had parked in front of her house (our yards are <br/>
side by side in a cul-de-sac) and I said I couldn&#39;t ask him to move it <br/>
because they were all up at the park playing ball.   She said &quot;This has been going <br/>
on for five years,&quot; and hung up.<br/>
<br/>
It has not been five years, and that particular kid JUST got a car a couple <br/>
of months before and has never parked there and never will again, and she calls <br/>
me &quot;Sandy&quot; instead of knowing my name and Oooh I was furious.   <br/>
<br/>
And as a result, when Marty was revealing a bit of the Harry Potter movie to <br/>
several kids who hadn&#39;t seen it, I said &quot;Shut UP, Marty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then I breathed.  And then I said &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have said that if I had not <br/>
SO many times gotten on other people for telling you things you didn&#39;t want <br/>
to hear, because you HATE hearing things from movies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then I found a cigarette butt in the front yard, and...<br/>
<br/>
Well, with eight extra teens and a couple I don&#39;t know well, I figured the <br/>
safest place for me (and for them) was to be in a room by myself watching The <br/>
Last Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
So I &quot;time-outed&quot; myself.  <br/>
<br/>
(Darn.  And I did end up telling the list anyway.)<br/>
