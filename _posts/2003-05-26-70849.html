<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147219984">We say, &quot;There are NO bad words.&quot; There may be times when some words are <br/>
inappropriate. My in-laws just can&#39;t figure this out---but then they&#39;ll wash their <br/>
kids&#39; mouths out with soap for saying &quot;stupid&quot;! <br/>
<br/>
My nephew (12ish?) had his mouth washed out for something (can&#39;t remember <br/>
which word)---his mom was FURIOUS. She told him to &quot;think&quot; about it and tell her <br/>
where he heard it. <br/>
<br/>
From HER!<br/>
<br/>
I asked whether she washed her own mouth out! She didn&#39;t *get* it!<br/>
<br/>
My boys are WELCOME to use whatever language they&#39;re comfortable with. They <br/>
both learned quickly when it&#39;s acceptable---and don&#39;t hide it. They&#39;re just <br/>
*aware*.<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, the foul-mouthed---but generally acceptable<br/>

&gt; dummy, etc.).  Yesterday we were at my<br/>
&gt; sister&#39;s and my 5yo niece came running in to tell me that my 4yo said <br/>
&gt; &quot;ass&quot;.  I asked her if he called her an<br/>
&gt; ass and she said no and that he fell off the end of the slide and bumped <br/>
&gt; it.  I told her that it was ok and she<br/>
&gt; gave me an amazed, puzzled look.  I let her know that her Uncle and I <br/>
&gt; let the him say that and she was like, &quot;Wow.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later on I was talking to my sister and cracking up over my niece&#39;s <br/>
&gt; amazement.  My sister told me that her DD<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t head straight back outside, but made a beeline to her and dreamy <br/>
&gt; like asked, &quot;Mama, can I say bad words<br/>
&gt; too?&quot;  LOL  Sis told her no.... which is ironic (is that the right <br/>
&gt; word?) because I don&#39;t know anyone who swears<br/>
&gt; more than my sister.<br/>
