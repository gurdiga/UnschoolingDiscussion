&lt;&lt; Can you elaborate on what items you sell on ebay?  And how you make money <br/>
that way. Always looking for new ideas. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I started out a couple years ago selling educational software that I <br/>
buy wholesale. Now I am branching out into collectibles. I have a friend who <br/>
goes to garage sales and estate auctions and buys to resale. He makes a lot <br/>
more than I do but he also has more free time to run auctions, it does take <br/>
time. For example he sells a lot of old postcards, he may spend a few dollars <br/>
for a whole box. A lot of them sell on ebay for $10 a piece. Some may go as <br/>
high as $125 a piece. Some may not sell. But that is a nice profit. The cards <br/>
that sell the best are non tourist places. Like a swimming pool photo in a <br/>
small town or an old school building and etc. The kind of thing where the <br/>
buyer says, hey, I went swimming there as a kid or Grandpa did, you get the <br/>
idea. He also sells 70&#39;s toys. The kind he said that yuppies had as kids. <br/>
(his words not mine). All kinds of things sell on ebay. I just sold a lot of <br/>
books we had here that we had used when the kids had an interest in ancient <br/>
history. But we have not used them in a long while and I decided to clean <br/>
shelves. They sold well and many I had bought used. I made money and we used <br/>
them too. I make about $200 a week clear with software, if I get on the stick <br/>
and run about 40 - 60 auctions a week. At Christmas I sell 3 times that much <br/>
for about 6 wks. My friend runs 175 - 200 auctions a week, I am not sure what <br/>
he makes but it is his only employment. He has been studying this for quite a <br/>
while and knows what to buy. If you do decide to go the ebay route then you <br/>
will need a digital camera. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.etusa.com/auction/">http://www.etusa.com/auction/</a> has a free program <br/>
you can download to set up your auctions for you so you do not have to do <br/>
HTML which is much faster. Photopoint.com will host your pictures for you to <br/>
put on your auctions, free.<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
