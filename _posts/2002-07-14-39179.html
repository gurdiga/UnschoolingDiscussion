<br/>
Of all the questions you might want to ask<br/>
about angels, the only one you ever hear<br/>
is how many can dance on the head of a pin.<br/>
<br/>
No curiosity about how they pass the eternal time<br/>
besides circling the Throne chanting in Latin<br/>
or delivering a crust of bread to a hermit on earth<br/>
or guiding a boy and girl across a rickety wooden bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Do they fly through God&#39;s body and come out singing?<br/>
Do they swing like children from the hinges<br/>
of the spirit world saying their names backwards and forwards?<br/>
Do they sit alone in little gardens changing colors?<br/>
<br/>
What about their sleeping habits, the fabric of their robes,<br/>
their diet of unfiltered divine light?<br/>
What goes on inside their luminous heads? Is there a wall<br/>
these tall presences can look over and see hell?<br/>
<br/>
If an angel fell off a cloud, would he leave a hole<br/>
in a river and would the hole float along endlessly<br/>
filled with the silent letters of every angelic word?<br/>
<br/>
If an angel delivered the mail, would he arrive<br/>
in a blinding rush of wings or would he just assume<br/>
the appearance of the regular mailman and<br/>
whistle up the driveway reading the postcards?<br/>
<br/>
No, the medieval theologians control the court.<br/>
The only question you ever hear is about<br/>
the little dance floor on the head of a pin<br/>
where halos are meant to converge and drift invisibly.<br/>
<br/>
It is designed to make us think in millions,<br/>
billions, to make us run out of numbers and collapse<br/>
into infinity, but perhaps the answer is simply one:<br/>
one female angel dancing alone in her stocking feet,<br/>
a small jazz combo working in the background.<br/>
<br/>
She sways like a branch in the wind, her beautiful<br/>
eyes closed, and the tall thin bassist leans over<br/>
to glance at his watch because she has been dancing<br/>
forever, and now it is very late, even for musicians.<br/>
<br/>
~Billy Collins, U.S. poet laureate 2001-2002<br/>
