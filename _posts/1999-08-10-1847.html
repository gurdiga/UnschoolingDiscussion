<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934108662">I agree with Joel. Don&#39;t make a big fuss about handwriting. If and when <br/>
there is a need for good handwriting, the unschooler will find a way to<br/>
improve the way he or she writes.<br/>
<br/>
The thoughts that come from the hand of my 17 year old brother are never<br/>
weak, even though his handwriting has more in common with some ancient,<br/>
indecipherable and long gone language. His handwriting is poor enough that<br/>
he he knows it is hard for others to read his handwriting--but not such a<br/>
hinderance that he feels that he must improve. His solution is to use a<br/>
computer for most of his public writing.<br/>
<br/>
For my own part, I had very poor handwriting until I started a daily<br/>
journal. I was a new 14 at the time. Writing in the journal cleaned up my<br/>
scribbles in short order. My handwriting was perfectly legible by journal #2<br/>
or 3, I think.<br/>
<br/>
The journal also helped me to learn cursive. Until age 16, I didn&#39;t need<br/>
cursive. Once a need arose, though, I decided to use cursive exclusively in<br/>
my journal. The first few weeks were rough. Each day, cursive chart in hand,<br/>
I would labor over my journal for 45 minutes to an hour. The pace was very<br/>
slow, but after a month my cursive was better than most of my friends.<br/>
<br/>
I was 17 when I finally picked up cursive. I still don&#39;t know how to<br/>
whistle... Maybe I&#39;ll find a need for whistling when I learn to herd cattle<br/>
or something.<br/>

I&#39;m just curious about this...<br/>
&lt;&lt; For my own part, I had very poor handwriting until I started a daily<br/>

<br/>
Do you remember what inspired you to start this journal?  If you want to <br/>
share the info., I&#39;d love to hear it.<br/>

        I didn&#39;t catch where this orginally came from but thanks you for<br/>
your comments. I have a 9yob who has been asking about learning to write<br/>
(penmanship that is). We have a paper route and the checks will be coming<br/>
in his name so hopefully he will learn to sign his name at least.<br/>
        Why did you need cursive at 16? Fro a job or something else? I have<br/>
a 13yob who hates cursive. He has beautiful printing and that is what he<br/>
prefers.<br/>

fluid motion going.  My eight year old loves it!  Both are boys.  It used to<br/>
frustrate me until my dh made a good point:  He never uses cursive in day to<br/>
day stuff (he is a carpenter and is continually filling in orders and report<br/>
sheets)...and he gets along just fine.<br/>

And really, most of the &#39;important&#39; stuff is done on the computer...and the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496144988">Thank you so much, Peter and everyone, for your input on the handwriting. <br/>
I am new to UNschooling and I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m still stuck in that old <br/>
&quot;everything falls on me&quot; homeschooling mindset. It&#39;s hard for me to sit back <br/>
and leave it up to my kiddos! We&#39;ve been under fire by family members lately <br/>
too, so I am questioning some things simply because of that. Anyway, thank <br/>
you again, Lori in TX</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106899128">The handwriting discussion makes me think of just how different the *what<br/>
every child needs to know* is for this generation, and how impossible it is<br/>
to move the system at the pace at which the needs are changing.<br/>
Typing was something I learned in 8th grade. I didn&#39;t use it again until&#39;<br/>
late highschool. I used it a few times in college.<br/>
Now, however, keyboarding and computer skills just blow many others away<br/>
proportionally. I don&#39;t mean that handwriting and cursive are not important,<br/>
because imo it IS very useful and wonderful to have nice handwriting<br/>
overall, but it&#39;s NOT of utter importance--the way it&#39;s often stressed in<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing, is that it clicks at some point.<br/>
My 7yo dd has struggled with her motor skills, but she&#39;s enjoyed what she&#39;s<br/>
doing. One day her handwriting was, from outside appearances, sloppy. The<br/>
next day, literally, it was neat and lovely.<br/>
She asked to learn cursive this summer, so I bought a workbook. She&#39;s loving<br/>
it-taking it to bed often, practicing, thrilled with her own efforts and<br/>
mastery. Something clicked.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s something that I don&#39;t believe can be forced from the outside--that<br/>
click--in any area of learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873192669"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;But on the other hand I may sit her at the table to practice her<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had horrid handwriting through most of my school experience.  Teachers<br/>
tried shaming me with grades and parent/teacher conferences and my<br/>
parents prodded.  It wasn&#39;t until Junior High and the INTEREST in<br/>
handwriting as a form of self-expression kicked in that I began to work<br/>
on this skill.  I know many adults who never came to this event and still<br/>
have only passable handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (11) has just entered the phase of interest in her<br/>
handwriting and she did it without the shaming and prodding.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s about the individual and the only thing the forcing of &quot;practice&quot;<br/>
does is cause feelings of resentment.<br/>
<br/>
Handwriting, after all, is about written communication.  The parents<br/>
needs to trust their child to understand the need for this and make<br/>
whatever adjustments are necessary.  Heck, a lot of folks have graduated<br/>
medical school without legible handwriting!!  *grin*<br/>

She&#39;s frustrated because her handwriting is hurting her chances.  <br/>

your dad learned Palmer and was making it more fun while he showed it <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183426146">Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
I have been on this list for a while and I don&#39;t think that I have <br/>
posted yet, although I have been thoroughly enjoying everyone else&#39;s <br/>
posts. Thank you all for sharing your thoughts, comments, questions. <br/>
I don&#39;t often feel I have much to add, but on handwriting-well <br/>
finally I do!<br/>
<br/>
I think a bit of an introduction is in order first, so you&#39;ll know <br/>
where I&#39;m coming from with my comments. I am a 39yo mother to 3 <br/>
wonderful children, a soon-to-be 13yo boy, a 7yo girl, and a 4yo <br/>
boy. My oldest went to a catholic school for K-5th grade, and my <br/>
daughter went part-time to a Lutheran pre-school, and the same <br/>
catholic school as my son for some pre-school. I <br/>
started &quot;researching&quot; homeschooling before my son finished fifth <br/>
grade, and moved into unschooling as quickly as I could learn about <br/>
it. All throughout this time, and for the last 15 years, I have been <br/>
working as an occupational therapist (full- or part-time) in the <br/>
public schools and early intervention programs.<br/>
<br/>
A common part of my work is helping children with &quot;handwriting <br/>
issues&quot;. It has always bothered me that teachers wanted little kids <br/>
to hold their pencils &quot;properly&quot;, when they have not finished <br/>
developing their fine motor skills yet. Many kids fine motor skills <br/>
are not fully refined until age 8, some even later! Yet now, kids in <br/>
pre-K have to learn to write their name to be &quot;ready&quot; for <br/>
kindergarten, and kindergarteners are writing alot more than that. <br/>
It&#39;s so wrong, and I tell all the teachers of students I&#39;m asked to <br/>
work with. They&#39;ll agree, but they are being asked to produce <br/>
results too, just like teachers at higher grades with testing. With <br/>
some of the older children I work with, the focus is on functional <br/>
writing. Can the child write legibly? If not, we look to other <br/>
options, like portable word processors, or the computers in the <br/>
classrooms, or notetakers,etc. <br/>

Well, I can get really carried away, but the main point I wanted to <br/>
stress is don&#39;t stress about pencil grip or handwriting. Let your <br/>
child lead the way, as in all things. If s/he wants to write, and is <br/>
having difficulty, there are a multitude of options out there to <br/>
try.  Different pens, pencils, grips, papers, etc. Also, writing can <br/>
be done is so many mediums, like art (sand, clay, paint, beads, <br/>
etc.) And there&#39;s always typing!<br/>

&lt;&lt; It has always bothered me that teachers wanted little kids <br/>
<br/>
to hold their pencils &quot;properly&quot;, when they have not finished <br/>
<br/>
developing their fine motor skills yet. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It used to be, until the invention of the ballpoint pen, that they were <br/>
preparing kids to use pen and ink, either dip pens or fountain pens.  Even when I <br/>
was a kid, our school still had some desks with holes for inkwells, and a slot <br/>
for a pen.  The difference between a pencil slot and a pen slot, on an old <br/>
wooden desk, is that the pencil slot is flat and horizontal, and the pen slot is <br/>
angled, on the righthand side.  That&#39;s one reason for slanted arms on desks <br/>
(if you were old enough to experience such a thing).<br/>
<br/>
Poor lefties.<br/>
Some were just told to learn to write with their right hands, because the <br/>
teachers didn&#39;t know how to deal with liquid ink and lefties, and part of their <br/>
reaching over and around had to do with school desks, and liquid ink.<br/>
<br/>
Ballpoints, though, work more like pencils in that the angle at which the <br/>
point touches the paper isn&#39;t crucial.  An upstroke won&#39;t break a nib or flink <br/>
ink.<br/>
<br/>
Palmer cursive has to do with pen-and-ink.  If the pen isn&#39;t picked up <br/>
(pressure continues), the ink will keep flowing freely, so that connected writing <br/>
was created, and it IS pretty with a fountain pen (nowadays, cartridge pens are <br/>
the last easily available pen and ink for everyday use).<br/>
<br/>
I bet 95% of the teachers who are teaching penmanship have NO idea of the <br/>
reasons behind what they&#39;re teaching, and the fact that so many of those things <br/>
are antiquated and no longer valid.  It&#39;s just tradition, now.  Hazing, almost. <br/>
 &quot;I had to learn it, so you have to learn it.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790365055">We have been struggling with the handwriting issue for several years now<br/>
too.  My son (almost 9) has an ackward pencil grip that seems to really<br/>
fatigue his wrist.  I tried for ages to get him to change... but he just<br/>
physically can&#39;t seem to hold it like we all do.<br/>
<br/>
We have done Handwriting Without Tears for 2 years now... and his<br/>
printing is still too large, too heavy, hard to read, and he doesn&#39;t put<br/>
enough space between his words.  Last year, we tried to see if learning<br/>
cursive would help.  It didn&#39;t.   He hates writing in cursive because he<br/>
claims that it&#39;s too hard to read.<br/>
<br/>
Bottomline is that my son absolutely hates to write and avoids it at all<br/>
costs.  Since he&#39;s a strong Visual Spatial learner, he just sticks to<br/>
drawing pictures when he wants to &quot;write something&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This year I was thinking about getting him a typing program, and I<br/>
wondered if anyone has any recommendations on which ones are good for<br/>
visual/spatial learners?<br/>

My only recommendation is to leave the poor child alone.  He&#39;ll write <br/>
how he&#39;ll write when/if he wants to write.   It&#39;s not up to you what <br/>
his handwriting looks like, Hon.  Lay off the little guy.  :)<br/>
<br/>
You do realize that what you&#39;ve been doing is not unschooling, right?<br/>

I too have a visual-spatial learner (at least that&#39;s his preferred style<br/>
:-) ) who strongly disliked writing.  A couple years ago we talked about<br/>
learning to type instead and I picked up a couple of kid-oriented typing<br/>
programs.  He tried them out once or twice.  What eventually motivated him<br/>
was having a real interest ... a true need to learn to type.  For him that<br/>
need was getting into online gaming.  After two weeks playing online he was<br/>
a very proficient typist.  In fact, even he remarked that he was surprised<br/>
how quickly he picked up the skill once he had a true reason to learn it.<br/>
<br/>
Does your son have a reason he wants to learn to type .. .other than just<br/>
because he &quot;hates&quot; writing?  You can pick him up a typing program or two to<br/>
try out, but don&#39;t be surprised if they don&#39;t hold his attention on their<br/>
own.  A real reason will do so much more than any fancy piece of software to<br/>
motivate him to learn to type.  When he&#39;s got a real reason, he can just<br/>
start typing!  I guarantee he&#39;ll get faster with experience.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays I don&#39;t think my son - he&#39;s 12 now - harbours a &quot;hatred&quot; of writing<br/>
(something he developed in school), it&#39;s just not his communication method<br/>
of choice.  I do sometimes see notes with game codes, web site addresses<br/>
etc. laying around in his handwriting, which also seems more legible now<br/>
since he has a real need to be able to read it!<br/>

He&#39;s &quot;almost 9&quot; and you&#39;ve been doing this for two years?<br/>
<br/>
School makes kids hate to write.<br/>
You can do the same damage at home, and it seems you might already have done <br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
So my best advice is to learn from that mistake and not procede to make him <br/>
hate math and reading and science and history!!<br/>
<br/>
My kids weren&#39;t taught to write.  Holly (12) has an artsy (but awkward) <br/>
cursive.  Marty (14, and a lefty) prints very small.   Small printing is very <br/>
useful, and some professionals learn it later in life, or used to, anyway <br/>
(architects, cartoonists, cartographers).  In school they teach people to write the <br/>
same size because of pre-lined paper, and for filling-in-blanks purposes.  Few <br/>
adults write on pre-lined paper, and blanks are increasingly filled in &quot;print <br/>
only&quot; (next time you fill in public forms, see if they don&#39;t ask you to print, <br/>
and maybe in spaced designed for transferring it to data entry!).<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago, I saw Kirby (17) fill in blanks by hand, quickly.  He <br/>
was judging karate belt tests, just him and the sensei of the dojo where he <br/>
goes.  He prints, but I guess it was acceptable.  He&#39;s been doing that for a few <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s what about that:  They don&#39;t mind writing.  They don&#39;t fear it.  <br/>
When they need it they use it, and they usually use the computer.<br/>
<br/>
I found a sample of Marty-writing in the trash yesterday, and knowing he had <br/>
used my computer to write the day before, I did a Sherlock search to see how <br/>
the final copy had turned out.<br/>
<br/>
It was a character description with stats and lists of previous projects (of <br/>
the character).<br/>
<br/>
Some words were misspelled by hand, but corrected on the computer.  He had <br/>
run spell check.  It didn&#39;t catch &quot;fallow&quot; because it&#39;s a real word.  He meant <br/>
&quot;follow.&quot;  So I told him what &quot;fallow&quot; meant, and now he knows two words and <br/>
their spellings.<br/>
<br/>
The misspellings he corrected were<br/>
aproched<br/>
offerd<br/>
spoted<br/>
<br/>
Some words he spelled correctly were<br/>
previous<br/>
couldn&#39;t<br/>
joined<br/>
aced<br/>
every<br/>
something<br/>
<br/>
He needs punctuation help.  Sometime when we&#39;re the only two in the room, <br/>
I&#39;ll show him a couple of ways to know when to use a comma, if he&#39;s in the mood.<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
I could read it all (even though it was only written for Marty&#39;s own use), <br/>
and it&#39;s interesting!<br/>
<br/>
So although I know the topic was handwriting, not writing in general, I think <br/>
making a six year old (or eight, or nine) practice writing is more likely to <br/>
make him dislike it than like it.  It doesn&#39;t contribute to peace and trust <br/>
between the parent and child.  It&#39;s not something I&#39;d recommend at all.<br/>
