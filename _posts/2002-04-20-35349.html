If you&#39;re looking for &quot;math&quot;, &quot;Geography&quot;, &quot;reading&quot; you may be <br/>
impeding yourself as an unschooler.<br/>
Enjoy your days. Surround yourself with love and life and all things <br/>
good. Explore your dreams, their dreams, embrace the world.<br/>
Out of it will come many lessons.....and as you journey you will not <br/>
find that you can put them in subject boxes.<br/>
Math, reading, writing, history....they all interweave and mingle <br/>
making a person wonder why on earth we need to label all these things <br/>

Don&#39;t look for math break throughs.<br/>
Look for fun opportunities.<br/>
A really fun book that I enjoyed reading to myself last week is &quot;Math <br/>
Curse&quot;. It&#39;s a children&#39;s book about a person finding math in...well, <br/>
in EVERYTHING. It&#39;s eye opening to a person like me that has been <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874028954">[How can I have a 4.0 gpa and still not understand math?  It is a<br/>
frustrating<br/>
thing.]<br/>
Sharon,I know what you mean.  I had 4 chemistry classes in high school,<br/>
and while I understood how the little molecules are made by the atoms and<br/>
all that, I never could see how to apply it in my life.  I still can&#39;t<br/>
figure out how people can understand to make chemicals and such by mixing<br/>
molecules up, or how they can figure out what things are made of by<br/>
breaking them down.  I never really understood it, it was some sort of<br/>
abstract thing.  I always did well in math, sort of, but I really didn&#39;t<br/>
understand Algebra I.  Fortunately, I had taken enough Pre-Algebra to get<br/>
some of it, enough to get a C.  Algebra II, though, was good because I<br/>
had a great teacher who made sure we all understood it.  But it isn&#39;t<br/>
anything I remember now, because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to use it in<br/>
my life.  The only math I really loved was Geometry.  I always felt like<br/>
people who understood higher math and science were somehow more<br/>
intelligent than I.  I thought I was somehow inferior to them.  All I<br/>
remember about Trigonometry was &quot;a&quot; squared plus &quot;b&quot; squared equals &quot;c&quot;<br/>
squared.  I remember that because it was something I could understand,<br/>
how to find the length of the &quot;slanty-side&quot; of a right triangle, like a<br/>
secret solving a puzzle or a riddle(I don&#39;t know if it applied to other<br/>
types of triangles,ouch, my brain just cramped).  I was much more into<br/>
Biology and Physiology, because these were things I could actually see<br/>
and measure with my eyes.  I remember a boy in Trig who would say, &quot;What<br/>
does this have to do with anything in my life?&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530657488">Yeah that is true.  That is the thing that got me about math.  Too many<br/>
things to *get*.  I could do it, but then a few years later I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
remember it.  I took algebra in college 3 different times,,,got an A every<br/>
time and now that years have gone by again,,,I don&#39;t remember it.  I think<br/>
if I had ever truely understood the concepts I would not have forgotten.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nobody cares if you&#39;re a true unschooler, Sharon.  You can be a <br/>
school-in-the-box curriculum user who is here to learn something about <br/>
unschooling and that&#39;s okay. But we are here to discuss and support <br/>
unschooling, right? So your posts will be responded to from that perspective. <br/>
If you want to learn more about unschooling and get support for unschooling, <br/>
this is the place. Here, on the unschooling list, you&#39;ll hear negative things <br/>
about schoolish-sounding stuff so you ought to expect that and not take it <br/>
personally - just take it as something to consider. The most anybody can ask <br/>
is for people to consider ideas that are offered. And what doesn&#39;t make sense <br/>
now might make sense some other time, who knows? On the other hand, if you <br/>
wanted to learn more about how to &quot;give lessons&quot; - there are better places, <br/>
I&#39;m sure. Here, the idea of giving lessons is an idea that is going to be <br/>
critiqued from an unschooling perspective (or from a number of unschooling <br/>
perspectives, I should say &lt;G&gt;). But - please try to remember that it is the <br/>
idea that is being discussed - not you, personally.  It is hard to hear <br/>
negative things said about something WE are doing - especially in regard to <br/>
raising children. But, believe me, if I went onto a Calvert curriculum list <br/>
and said, &quot;I&#39;m not going to give my child any assignments or grade their <br/>
papers,&quot; I&#39;d get a LOT of feedback from people who would think that was a <br/>
pretty terrible idea and that it isn&#39;t the way the Calvert people believe. <br/>
Note - this is NOT telling you to leave, I&#39;m sure you know that.<br/>

Yes, I know there are strong feelings that if &quot;some people&quot; would just stop<br/>
telling others what is and isn&#39;t unschooling, would stop picking and being<br/>
so picky, it&#39;s felt the list would be a lot more welcoming.<br/>
<br/>
But there are equally strong feelings that the list will no longer be about<br/>
unschooling and be about &quot;doing what works for each individual family&quot;.<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with &quot;doing what work&quot; but it isn&#39;t unschooling, is<br/>
it? And Unschooling is what it says on our sign.<br/>
<br/>
We need to learn how to coexist civilly so that those who learn best through<br/>
example get what they need and those who learn by deep questioning get what<br/>
they need.<br/>

*You* are responsible for helping to create a civil list so it can work to<br/>
meet the needs of all who come to find out about unschooling. You are not<br/>
responsible for attacking those you feel are attacking others. Adding to<br/>
what you perceive as attacking only compounds the problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Joyce.  This pretty much describes how I see the problem.  If <br/>
someone feels attacked by a post and says so, then it&#39;s usually helpful for <br/>
the person who wrote the original post to respond in a way that clears up <br/>
what they meant.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen it happen here, where the <br/>
original post actually *was* attacking or even unduly critical.  It&#39;s when <br/>
others step in to &quot;defend&quot; the &quot;attacked&quot; person that the trouble starts.<br/>
<br/>
I like Joyce&#39;s solution for when we feel a particular post attacked someone <br/>
else.  Send your comments about it to her.<br/>
Tia<br/>
<br/>
What you think of me is none of my business.<br/>

<br/>
No one has suggested that in any way.<br/>
<br/>
But unless you&#39;ve read enough to know what unschooling is and isn&#39;t, *maybe* <br/>
it would be worth reading more and posting less.  Or if you&#39;re the sort who <br/>
wants to ask questions quickly, get your answers and go back out (many are <br/>
that way), you might want to consider that insulting those who are trying to <br/>
help you isn&#39;t helpful to you or anyone else involved.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do I need to ask people to private post me about starting our own group and<br/>

<br/>
You could start your own group and advertise it right here and all over other <br/>
places.  Yahoogroups are free if you can handle the advertising.  You could <br/>
be on this mailing list and ten or twenty others as well.<br/>
<br/>
Expecting one list to be your sole source of information is rough, especially <br/>
when you want to limit the type of information you will consider and to <br/>
control the words in which it is couched.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;IF people are so AFRAID that their list is going to be spoiled, maybe you<br/>
should consider closing it to newcomers and only allowing the people whose<br/>
conversation you feel safe with?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are closed groups out there too, which are just little private e-mail <br/>
groups by invitation.  You could privately invite those few posters you most <br/>
enjoy reading if you&#39;d prefer a smaller group which would focus on something <br/>
besides unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Why would newcomers spoil the list?<br/>

How can we offer a &quot;support group&quot; for &quot;A place where we could tell of our<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623585620">The direct and undiluted say-exactly-what-you-really-think approach has <br/>
radically changed some people&#39;s lives. I&#39;m one of those people. I ALWAYS <br/>
appreciate blunt talk - I do not get offended when I know someone is being <br/>
honest. I am, instead, offended by dissimulation - by pretense - by someone <br/>
acting supportive of just anything, whether they really think it is a good <br/>
idea or not. I&#39;m offended by people who don&#39;t say what they think, because <br/>
they waste my time.<br/>
<br/>
Some people need to hear things in an undiluted form. Sometimes people don&#39;t <br/>
like what they hear and they leave in a huff and then come back later to say <br/>
that they continued to ponder what was said and that it LATER affected them <br/>
profoundly. It is a big list and it is EASY to just delete posts from someone <br/>
if you don&#39;t want to read them. It is much better for the list, to do that, <br/>
then to critique another person&#39;s personality, approach, posting style, <br/>
intentions, etc. If people want to respond, they should respond directly to <br/>
the ideas in the post.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes someone says something about &quot;doing lessons&quot; and someone says, <br/>
&quot;That isn&#39;t unschooling.&quot; And the first person has an &quot;aha&quot; experience - and <br/>
suddenly has a breakthrough in their understanding about what unschooling is <br/>
REALLY like. Sometimes people just get offended and feel like the person has <br/>
nitpicked and is playing semantics games - but that is likely because they <br/>
don&#39;t really understand the implications.<br/>
<br/>
A possible response to such posts might be: &quot;Woops - you&#39;re right -- &quot;doing <br/>
lessons&quot; in the usual schoolish sense isn&#39;t what I really meant. Or - &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
right - &quot;doing lessons&quot; isn&#39;t really unschooling, I guess we&#39;re not really <br/>
unschooling.&quot; That would be perfectly understandable - not everybody here is <br/>
unschooling - they&#39;re just here to learn about it and maybe take some ideas <br/>
from unschoolers as they see fit. That is okay.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of people who are offended by the idea of unschooling and <br/>
offended by having it pointed out that what they are talking about isn&#39;t <br/>
really unschooling. I can understand that. It can be threatening to people to <br/>
hear, bluntly and directly, that what they spent their whole lives believing <br/>
was necessary, what they went through themselves and often put their children <br/>
through, was not only not necessary but possibly harmful.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t believe it - then they don&#39;t and that&#39;s fine. They can do <br/>
things their way - obviously. But on an unschooling list where the purpose is <br/>
to support unschooling, you can&#39;t expect that support to be in the form of <br/>
pretending to think &quot;doing lessons&quot; and teaching that is subject-based and <br/>
anything else any homeschooling parent might do - is all the same as <br/>
unschooling. It isn&#39;t unschooling, even the concept of &quot;subjects&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling and people will point that out and talk about why it isn&#39;t and <br/>
why they don&#39;t do those things and don&#39;t believe in dividing learning into <br/>
subjects, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people will come to the list who don&#39;t like what they hear. If I went <br/>
to a Charlotte Mason list or a Calvert Curriculum list or any other <br/>
homeschooling &quot;style&quot; list, I wouldn&#39;t like what I heard there either. I <br/>
spent time on an Oak Meadow Curriculum list - because there were some things <br/>
I wanted learn about their curriculum. But I wouldn&#39;t get pissed off if I was <br/>
on a Calvert list and I said that I was letting my kids &quot;just learn from <br/>
life&quot; and people on that list jumped on that phrase and explained how they <br/>
thought that was a terrible idea and that it wouldn&#39;t work and that I should, <br/>
instead, use a structured, carefully preplanned, curriculum. It is what the <br/>
list would be for, for supporting THAT approach, and I should not post there <br/>
if I don&#39;t want to HEAR that.<br/>

believing that the categories are absolute, don&#39;t overlap, and can&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not that subjects overlap a little, it&#39;s that they are sometimes <br/>
indistinguishable.  If someone considers poetry literature, and applies no <br/>
principles of math or music to it, that is like one thin slice of poetry, <br/>
instead of poetry whole, and alive.  Without historical context, cultural <br/>
context, and an idea of how the poetry was exposed to the world (carved on <br/>
stone? sung? recited in costume on a stage? imprinted on a card? published in <br/>
a little hand-printed book?  in Parade Magazine during WWII?) then it&#39;s just <br/>
a peek through a little hole at poetry.<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t overlaps, those are overlays.  Anything learned well and deeply <br/>
is learned in its context, and there isn&#39;t a context for chemistry in the <br/>
real world that doesn&#39;t involve scientific method, morality, ecology, medical <br/>
ethics, history, geography, maybe a knowledge of the origin and harvesting of <br/>
the natural resources involved....<br/>

I&#39;d look in a dictionary.  I wouldn&#39;t take a chemistry class, nor go to the <br/>
chemistry section of a library to find out what salt is.<br/>
<br/>
School-subject categories have purposes which can run counter to an <br/>
understanding that all information is interrelated and nothing exists out of <br/>
its own context.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But- I wasn&#39;t saying that categories are useless. I was saying that <br/>
unschoolers generally don&#39;t think about learning in terms of school-subjects. <br/>
If we&#39;re interested in bunsen burners we&#39;d sign up to do something that uses <br/>
bunsen burners, of course. And if we&#39;re interested in poetry, we might sign <br/>
up for a poetry-writing workshop. If we wanted to know the formula for salt, <br/>
we&#39;d look that up under chemistry.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers don&#39;t divide our children&#39;s learning (or our own) into <br/>
&quot;English,&quot; &quot;Science,&quot; &quot;History,&quot; and &quot;Math.&quot; Some people do, when they are <br/>
new to unschooling or if they can&#39;t really accept it that the subjects are <br/>
arbitrary and unreal and only done that way for the convenience of schools. <br/>
They look at what the kid is doing and they comfort themselves or reassure <br/>
themselves - &quot;That is math and THAT is English and THAT is history.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My point was that people tend to stop even THINKING in those terms as they <br/>
unschool longer. The kids just learn. Those who keep thinking in those terms <br/>
will often try to make sure the kids focus on the subject the parent thinks <br/>
they are supposed to be learning when engaged in some activity. So they&#39;ll be <br/>
at a science museum looking at an exhibit on buildings and the parent will be <br/>
thinking this is &quot;science&quot; and keep turning the kids&#39; attention to the <br/>
different kinds of structures - to the engineering - how the buildings are <br/>
built. The KID may be more interested in imagining what it is like to live in <br/>
the different kinds of homes that are on display, and not at all interested <br/>
in the mechanics of how they are built.<br/>
<br/>
Dividing learning into subjects is for school. Dividing books into categories <br/>
is for librarians to make it easier for us to find them. And, I&#39;m sure nobody <br/>
will be surprised to find out that those categories are NOT cut and dried and <br/>
that there is often great debate among the catalogers about where to put any <br/>
particular book. Homeschooling books are a good example - they are all over <br/>
the place.<br/>

better or to building a sense of community.<br/>

My girls just picked up an 18 volume edition of The Chemical Formulary <br/>
from the 1930&#39;s.  Oh sure it has lots of other interesting things in <br/>
it from aerosol deoderant to sodapop to explosives, kitchen science to <br/>
make-up, but if they were to go looking for it again, I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
them start in the cookbook section of the library.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing how what you want to know fits into the scheme of life&#39;s <br/>
categories (sometimes called &quot;subjects&quot; by schools, libraries and <br/>
bookstores) is probably going to be helpful in finding it.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;concept of subjects&quot; to me, is the concept that there is a vast <br/>
quantity of things to learn about and it is every so comvienient to <br/>
have them organized.  Nothing more, nothing less.<br/>
