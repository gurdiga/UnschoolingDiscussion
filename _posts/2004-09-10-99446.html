You can definitely count on my help, too.<br/>
Let&#39;s see - 2009 is in 5 years. Ben will be 18 and Jon will be 16. Yikes!<br/>
It&#39;s scary just thinking about that.  ;-)<br/>
Seems like there are lots of offers being made for upcoming conference<br/>
locations.<br/>
Maybe there will have to be more than one a year pretty soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-387042050">Oh Karin, I&#39;m so glad you chimed in and said you wanted to help because I<br/>
was definitely going to ask for your help.  lol Kelly hasn&#39;t &quot;approved&quot; of<br/>
Phx for 2009 yet.  So we&#39;ll see what happens.  But I think this conference<br/>
is just what PHoenix needs!<br/>
