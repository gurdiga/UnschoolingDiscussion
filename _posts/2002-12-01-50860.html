<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372418121"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Started about five years ago by a<br/>
&gt;Canadian magazine named Adbusters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought the number quoted by David Alpert was wrong so I checked it on <br/>
the Adbusters website.  It says there BND started 11 years ago but even <br/>
that seems too recent.  Anyone else remember something similar before then?<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I went shopping on BND :-)  It is not a big shopping day in <br/>
Canada as it is in the US (because our Thanksgiving is in October, and on a <br/>
Monday) and as I said to my husband, just about every other day of the year <br/>
is buy nothing day for me.<br/>
<br/>
Canadian Mennonites have started a &quot;Buy Nothing Christmas&quot; if anyone is <br/>
interested. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.buynothingchristmas.org/">http://www.buynothingchristmas.org/</a><br/>

 </span></blockquote>So did I.  As long as BND is on a Friday, I&#39;ll be a shopper because that&#39;s<br/>
my regular town day.  If I go on a different day, I&#39;ll end up with overdue<br/>
library books.<br/>
