<div id="ygrps-yiv-523367984">When I came across the word squaw in a book, I thought it meant woman or<br/>
wife.  I just looked it up in my compact dictionary and it is said to mean<br/>
woman or wife.  It also says that it can be offensive.<br/>
<br/>
I was not aware of an offensive usage.  Honestly.  I have never heard anyone<br/>
use it offensively in my presence or in any of the literature that I have<br/>
read.  I am ignorant of squaw being a derogatory term.  At least I was.  Now<br/>
it has been pointed out to me.<br/>
<br/>
Language usage is another thing I discuss with my kids.  Lisa recently asked<br/>
me if I knew there were two &quot;dams&quot;.  We looked both up in my dictionary and<br/>
in her children&#39;s dictionary.  Only one of them was listed in the children&#39;s<br/>
dictionary - the one that refers to something blocking water, of course.  We<br/>
talk about how some words used to mean one thing and have come to be &quot;swear&quot;<br/>
words or derogatory terms.  We talk about why certain words are best avoided<br/>
in certain situations.  We talk about the impression others get when you use<br/>
certain words liberally.<br/>
