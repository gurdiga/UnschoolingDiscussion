<div id="ygrps-yiv-286690656">Hey Melanie,<br/>
My 14 year old (until recently) liked to play Ultima Online.  He&#39;s played <br/>
it for well over a year and invested a great deal of time and effort into <br/>
his personnas.  I think Ultima Online is a good one to start with as it&#39;s <br/>
gentler on newbies.  (ie, it lets you climb the learning curve in a fairly <br/>
risk-free environment while you&#39;re new, then as you get more experienced, <br/>
it stops protecting your assets as thoroughly.)<br/>
<br/>
Recently, he&#39;s gotten more into Half-life which he plays online.<br/>
<br/>
My 17 year old once mentioned that on-line The SIMS was stupid and <br/>
boring.  She likes the CDRom versions though.<br/>
Maybe you could google &#39;online game&#39; and see what pops up?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988239968">My daughter LOVES Everquest, which is a playstation 2 game that you <br/>
connect to the internet and play online.  She is constantly carrying <br/>
on conversations with other players which is neat.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh says that there is a new Final Fantasy game coming to the US <br/>
soon.  It&#39;s already in Japan.  A cool thing about it is that there <br/>
will be a translater built into the game that will translate English <br/>
into Japanese and Japanese into English.   English speaking people <br/>
will be able to carry on conversations with and play right alongside <br/>
with Japanese people.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942346949">ok, I have read the archives and can&#39;t seem to get past october 2003.<br/>
I know this topic has been discussed many times before, but please <br/>
bear with me.<br/>
<br/>
2 questions:  Any one heard of or played Star Wars Galaxies?<br/>
Any good games for my 11 yr. old son who loves Star Wars?<br/>
<br/>
Basically you buy the game, read the instructions, pay the online <br/>
fee and get started?  Is that the idea?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
