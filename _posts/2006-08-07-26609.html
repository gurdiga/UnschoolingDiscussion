Little House. He didnt realize that the Ingalls were a real family, i <br/>
told him her books were on the shelf in the back bedroom, but that <br/>
they might not be just like the show (its been awhile since i&#39;ve read <br/>
them, and all i remember is that Jack the dog was a bulldog or <br/>
something, not the dog they have in the show, and them playing with a <br/>
pig bladder (?) for a ball...)...recently they had a storyline about a <br/>
blind school moving to Walnut Grove, and many of the students were <br/>
black. Somehow i don&#39;t think that happened IRL, but is representative <br/>
of how &quot;color conscious&quot; many shows were in the 70s. <br/>
<br/>
We also had an interesting conversation about why Jack Tripper would <br/>
have to pretend he was gay on Three&#39;s Company, or why Wally&#39;s dad <br/>
would be upset that he lost a $19 jacket. *SO* many conversations <br/>
about history, politics, economics, social mores come from watching <br/>
TV. <br/>

<br/>
I think if you start them for a while, the kids will start initiating  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents are in the habit of talking down to kids, in a false  <br/>
voice, or else being teacherly and asking questions like quiz  <br/>
questions, with &quot;right answers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you notice how you talk to friends and other adults, and try to be  <br/>
that way with your kids, the conversations will probably become more  <br/>
honest and open.<br/>
<br/>
At our house anyone with a thought or idea will initiate a  <br/>
conversation.  Sometimes they&#39;re ten seconds long and sometimes an  <br/>
hour.  You can&#39;t predict or control which way that will go.  Maybe  <br/>
it&#39;s that you have to calmly let ten be short and uninspiring to get  <br/>
to that eleventh one that&#39;s fantastic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Both. But i talk alot...i&#39;d say throwing out info, helping my son <br/>
make connections is a huge part of what i do as an unschooling <br/>
parent. I don&#39;t remember how the Little House conversation came up, <br/>
i think i was telling him that i bet the REAL Ma and Pa Ingalls <br/>
probably werent as nice as the ones on TV, but that Michael Landon  <br/>
put alot of effort into making the Ingalls better/nicer versions of <br/>
themselves. Seamus said something like &quot;You mean, they really <br/>
existed?&quot; and i told him about the books. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how other unschoolers do it, but while i don&#39;t try to <br/>
totally monopolize conversations (sometimes its just nice to listen <br/>
to a song without getting the whole background on it!), I DO often <br/>
toss out little bits of trivia. Like how this song is by Prince, and <br/>
he changed his name to a symbol once, but changed it back, and his <br/>
name really IS Prince. Or just the other day, &quot;Borderline&quot; came on, <br/>
and i mentioned that it was one of Madonna&#39;s first songs, and she is <br/>
from Michigan (like us)...that her name really IS Madonna (kinda <br/>
ties into the Prince is His Real Name conversation we had before), <br/>
and that her song &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; was hugely controversial at the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
So i talk, but it usually turns into us having a conversation <br/>
together. Sometimes i say something, and he says &quot;Oh, cool.&quot; and <br/>
thats it. And he does the same thing with me, which is why i can <br/>
name every type of elf, and know that orcs are bad, and am learning <br/>
about all sorts of different types of weapons. <br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere that the average parent engages in &quot;meaningful <br/>
conversation&quot; with their child only 20 minutes a week. I <br/>
thought....&quot;Huh?!&quot; We talk together all the time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020746610">I have to add in that LHOTP has been HUGE in our house. My children are<br/>
young (4 and 2.5 and baby) so I was not sure that they would like it, but we<br/>
started by reading the books at night (they are full of action) and<br/>
discussing things that are similar or different in our lives. Also, linking<br/>
to our relatives who are old or dead  and lived lives similar to a pioneer<br/>
family. My daughter has fully transformed rooms in her vivid reenactments of<br/>
scenes. She and her brother have used laundry baskets to make covered<br/>
wagons, they have made stocking out of paper and filled them with the same<br/>
things that Laura and her sibs got for xmas, we go for weeks where we have<br/>
to call her Mary and her younger brother Laura etc. One interesting thing I<br/>
did was look for picture on the internet for anything they might be<br/>
unfamiliar with. I printed them out and we now have a box full of picture of<br/>
wolves, tee pees, moccasins, covered wagons, the real family members etc. We<br/>
even found a recording of wolves howling online and played it over and over<br/>
while Eva made her dad look out the windows with his &quot;gun&quot; to see the<br/>
wolves. We also rented the dvds and watched several of them and noted the<br/>
differences of the story with the tv show. I ordered her a bonnet fand a<br/>
sleeping cap from ebay which she has fun with. 99% of this is initiated by<br/>
my daughter and I just work hard to facilitate her interest. It comes and<br/>
goes in spurts but overall this is a topic she is very intrigued by. It has<br/>
been a great example for me about how delving into new topics can spark new<br/>
interests and vivid discussions. I am a young (in experience, not age) but<br/>
convinced &quot;unschooler&quot;!<br/>

I read  somewhere that the average parent engages in &quot;meaningful <br/>

thought....&quot;thought....&quot;&lt;WBR&gt;Huh?!&quot; We talk  togeth<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I often think that the time we have together to talk is what brings us  all <br/>
the most joy. Sometimes it&#39;s a bit bittersweet.  My daughter has her  own car <br/>
now and today she drove us across the bridge to her guitar lesson so she  would <br/>
be comfortable to do it herself from now on.  Her choice.  I&#39;ve  known it was <br/>
coming but I loved those trips...the music and the talks and the  laughter.  <br/>
We&#39;ll still talk but it&#39;s a signal of the changes to come  as she grows more <br/>
independent and confident. <br/>
 <br/>
My 13 year old son and I are doing an event at our YMCA where we get points  <br/>
working out for a month to get a t-shirt.  Today we were sitting on a mat  <br/>
stretching for 10 minutes to get some points and he said..&quot;The best part of this  <br/>
is that we get to just talk together&quot;  I loved that.  School started  here <br/>
today so most parents dropped their kids off at school or the bus stop at  8:00 <br/>
this morning and here we were just happily hanging out together.<br/>
 <br/>
We talk a lot.  Sometimes not long conversations but little bits  and pieces <br/>
through the day.  Connecting with each other.  I can&#39;t even  imagine our lives <br/>
if they had been gone to school for all those hours for all  these years.<br/>

I read this to Holly.  First she was asking for details, like were  <br/>
they counting babies, and I said probably school-aged kids, and  <br/>
probably averaged in parents who didn&#39;t even live with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Twenty minutes?  I need to talk to you more.&quot;<br/>
She looked at me straight on and said, &quot;Please don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

(We were both joking.)<br/>
