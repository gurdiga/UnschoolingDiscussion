I need to clarify that last statement...two triathletes were injured in the <br/>
Gulf Shores incident (summer 2000), Jesses uncle was not injured, just <br/>
involved because of saving Jesse. You probably knew that, but my last <br/>
statement sounded confusing!<br/>
Sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083925467">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I can certainly relate to your fears, having my children learning at home now <br/>
for over 20 years.  I know some people think that I KNOW what I am doing at <br/>
all times, and have no worry about the outcome.  This isn&#39;t true!<br/>
<br/>
What I have come to believe is that having the kids at home has advantages <br/>
(So many - as we know), but they still are outside the &quot;normal&quot; culture, and <br/>
there are things that they won&#39;t have in their lives that we did because we <br/>
attended school.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were so surprised when they went to college and found out they <br/>
weren&#39;t dumb.  I had told them they weren&#39;t, but somehow it doesn&#39;t count as <br/>
much  when the person telling you is your parent.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t surprised when my two reader/writer kids did well, but now my <br/>
athletic son seems to be getting all A&#39;s too.  And even more importantly is <br/>
really LEARNING while he is there.  It helps that he is older (29), and <br/>
totally focused the same way he does with his diving.<br/>
<br/>
The son that is raking in the money as a journeyman for heating/air <br/>
conditioning seems to have lots of responsibility at his job (being put in <br/>
charge of projects), so he too is a high functioning young adult (age 24).<br/>
<br/>
In all this time I haven&#39;t had many brushes with the law.  Once long ago CA <br/>
tried to crack down on homeschoolers, and they all banded together, so it <br/>
came out fine.  Last year my youngest son was picked up in a local truancy <br/>
sweep (the people at the drop site were questioning that he wasn&#39;t able to <br/>
fill out their form - (since he had just learned to read, and still isn&#39;t <br/>
writing much (now age 14) that didn&#39;t look good), but they hadn&#39;t checked the <br/>
local rules that exempted homeschoolers from the truancy laws.  Trevor&#39;s Dad <br/>
found this information out after we recovered Trevor from the authorities.  <br/>
The experience seemed to shake me up much more than it did Trevor.<br/>
<br/>
I love being with people who believe that the choices that I&#39;ve made for the <br/>
kids has been a wise one.  Sometimes that hasn&#39;t happened.  My Mom told me <br/>
she was glad I was writing a book about homeschooling, so she could read it, <br/>
and maybe finally understand what I&#39;ve been doing.  I don&#39;t think this will <br/>
happen :-) - the understanding that is--<br/>
<br/>
Having strong opinions and living your choices can leave you an open target.  <br/>
That&#39;s when the support of friends can really be wonderful.  That is what you <br/>
have on this list.<br/>
<br/>
We all want the very best for our children, and it is difficult to be <br/>
confident in our choices at all times.  All I can say is that now that four <br/>
of the five kids are out in the world I truly feel that the way they were <br/>
raised helps them to find their path, and develop as young adults.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you --<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647785553">Connie:  Thank you for sharing this entire e-mail (although I snipped it<br/>
to reply).Yesterday I encountered a 40 minute &quot;conversation&quot; with my<br/>
mother about why homeschooling is not the right thing for my children<br/>
(she knows best of course), why I&#39;m not competent (nor is my husband in<br/>
her eyes) to &quot;educate&quot; my own children.  I responded very differently<br/>
this time and didn&#39;t argue.  I&#39;m hoping that next time the topic comes<br/>
up I&#39;ll be able to hang up the phone in the first 5 mins while saying<br/>
something like &quot;oops one of the kids needs me, I&#39;ll talk to you later&quot;..<br/>
I&#39;m getting there, but I think this is a lifetime thing to get unemeshed<br/>
with my mother.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to hear that it can be done and even those who been doing it<br/>
for 20 years had to go through the questioning of themselves and others<br/>
and she hung in there.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Connie.. It has helped me no end.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the reassurance, Connie!<br/>
<br/>
I see it the potential success with my kids, but it&#39;s little, because they&#39;re <br/>
still home.  <br/>
<br/>
I really liked reading where your kids are at the moment, and that the diver <br/>
has A&#39;s too.  <br/>
Not that &quot;A&#39;s&quot; are a goal, but it might be making him feel societally right <br/>
and good and legit, if he ever did have those doubts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685423365">It&#39;s so important to talk about our fears with one another. Otherwise we&#39;re <br/>
in danger of thinking that everyone else out there is doing it right and <br/>
we&#39;re just lame.<br/>
<br/>
I worry that Julian will never decide to learn more structured math and <br/>
writing, and then decide he wants to go to college, and not get in, and will <br/>
blame me for not making him learn it. <br/>
<br/>
I always tell new homeschoolers that EVERYONE has those &quot;Oh my god! What have <br/>
I done to my child&#39;s life?!&quot; moments, but that they pass. I almost never get <br/>
them anymore, which is nice. (Someone today called her style of homeschooling <br/>
&quot;Unschooling with Panic Attacks.&quot; They unschool and periodically Mom has a <br/>
panic attack and brings out work sheets. Her kids told me that they don&#39;t <br/>
take them seriously, and that they make a nice change of pace for the twenty <br/>
minutes they&#39;re around, and they all know it&#39;s just Mom&#39;s Stuff. And Mom <br/>
always apologizes later.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571464184">Thanks so much everyone for the feedback on the fears.  It has helped<br/>
dissipate a lot of them.  I think talking about them and hearing what<br/>
others have to say helps those fears become less powerful. <br/>
