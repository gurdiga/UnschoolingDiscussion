 </span></blockquote>Me too!  Well, I don&#39;t like blowing things up. I DO like battle scenes. I try <br/>
to put myself there. It&#39;s horribly gory and bloody. Of course, I always say <br/>
I&#39;d be the one pretending to have been hit and lying VERY still until it was <br/>
over. (Totally worthless in war!) We visited Gettysburg and Petersburg; I can <br/>
just imagine the scenes! I loved the Burn&#39;s series and the movie made out of <br/>
The Killer Angels. The Patriot (filmed here in Camden). Braveheart. WWII and <br/>
Napoleanic reinactments. I&#39;m not as wild about the VietNam war--that creeps <br/>
me out. <br/>
<br/>
The glorified parts of war are completely out of my grasp---but the realities <br/>
hit SO close. I can smell the rotting flesh and the blood and taste the <br/>
metallic air. I can feel the snow or the sun. And hear the voices. The <br/>
battlefields of VA are hauntingly &quot;THERE&quot;.  But I felt the same in Dachau. <br/>
(Been there yet, Brenda? It&#39;s a trip you&#39;ll never forget!)<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s the chick flick KING! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
