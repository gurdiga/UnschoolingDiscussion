<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687086419">Hi, Luanne!<br/>
<br/>
This list is for unschooling support. In general you&#39;ll see this comment when<br/>
someone says, &quot;I make my kids do this or that because it&#39;s educational.&quot; Most<br/>
unschoolers believe that, at root, this is not unschooling. Dividing life into<br/>
educational and junk categories is fundamentally not our philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
If you post that you so divide the world and love it and so forth, yeah, you&#39;ll<br/>
probably hear that it&#39;s not unschooling. If you post that you have questions,<br/>
you&#39;ll probably get support, but if you only want support for declaring some<br/>
things junk, this is not the best place.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
:-) Diane<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m relatively new to this list, but I have seen this question come up<br/>
&gt; several times already. We use an eclectic approach, but strongly influenced<br/>
&gt; by unschooling. I joined hoping to get ideas to more effectively apply the<br/>
&gt; unschooling approach and gain confidence in it, but having this question pop<br/>
&gt; up so much makes me wonder: Is this list only for those who are already<br/>
&gt; wholeheartedly sold on unschooling or are you willing to help point those of<br/>
&gt; us who are still learning in that direction?? I don&#39;t mean this to sound<br/>
&gt; snide, I just don&#39;t want to waste my time on something that is going to end<br/>
&gt; up being accusation and judgement.<br/>

I&#39;m sure you think that is how this group works but . . .<br/>
<br/>
I was told that I am not unschooling because I expect a certain amount of<br/>
work from my kids each week.  I did not say that I think other aspects of<br/>
life are junk.  I did not say I disallow all TV.  I did say I have to<br/>
limit it because I have a sone who is addicted.  That is not an<br/>
educational decision, it is a life decision.<br/>
<br/>
But I was still told, this is probably not the list for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941750479">Oh, Ok. Some may see it, as I did, that you&#39;re labeling some of life as<br/>
&quot;work&quot; and marking it as more valuable than the stuff you limit. It&#39;s true<br/>
that I used labels you didn&#39;t use.<br/>
