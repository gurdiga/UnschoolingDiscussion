<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723498497">...well, you know the rest. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, I pop in on the unschooling-dotcom list (which I have received on digest<br/>
since forever but delete unread because I haven&#39;t had time) to read, and<br/>
what to my wondering eyes should appear but this, the latest (digest) post<br/>
in a dialog...<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt; I dont feel you should make such comments about someones religion!<br/>
&gt; Her beliefs are very powerful and not make believe.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;It&#39;s funny--because nobody believes in the power of the devil (or even<br/>
&gt;&gt;BELIEVES in &quot;the devil&quot;) like Christians.  And to suspend a kid from school<br/>
&gt;&gt;for casting a spell must mean that they acknowledge the potential power of<br/>
&gt;&gt;that spell and therefore give credence and power to whatever believe system<br/>
&gt;&gt;is behind it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Too weird for me.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;If there is only one all-powerful God then all the heathen other-stuff is<br/>
&gt;&gt;nothing, make-believe, powerless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Back on AOL, part of my homeschooling hobby &lt;g&gt; was to walk around shaking<br/>
my head at the misunderstandings, whether intentional or not.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra didn&#39;t say that anyones beliefs were make-believe (although, if she<br/>
DID say that, I&#39;d be the first to agree with her -- I mean, just LOOK at the<br/>
language -- belief = to make belief, ALL our beliefs, no matter what they<br/>
are, are make-believe).<br/>
<br/>
Read carefully. If you (generic you, not the other poster) are Christian and<br/>
you believe in one all-powerful God, then Joe Witch next door believing in<br/>
the Goddess and casting spells should have no effect on you, since you don&#39;t<br/>
believe in his Deity.<br/>
<br/>
Or, in layman&#39;s terms: If I cast a spell in the woods and there exists no<br/>
deity to hear me, does it make any sound to the Christian Church down the<br/>
road?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
