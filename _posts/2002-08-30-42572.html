how many other passions he could have spent more time on if he hadn&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778905434">Hi.  My name is Linda Greene.  I just joined unschooling-dotcom yesterday.  I am very interested in unschooling but am scared to death, mainly because my husband is very opposed to it.<br/>
<br/>
 We homeschooled for the first time this past year.  I have two boys: Thomas age 11 and Daniel age 7 (8 in November).  My oldest really had a rough 3rd and 4th grade in public school.  His grades were poor and his self-esteem even worse.  He was angry, violent, teary all the time.  He was diagnosed ADHD, and depressed by a psychiatrist.  I was not about to put him on drugs, so I pulled him out of school (my husband was somewhat supportive).<br/>
<br/>
We started last year off with Calvert School curriculum....ACK!  What a mistake!  That lasted all of about 1 1/2 weeks.  I quickly backed off to math, science and some language arts workbooks, plus daily reading to my kids (well almost daily).  Many days we didn&#39;t do anything, or we went on field trips.  For the first time ever, Thomas, is reading a book on his own.  He read one book this summer and now is reading &quot;The Two Towers&quot; from the Tokien series to himself!  I am thrilled beyond belief.  We&#39;ve always had to read to him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I had promised my husband I would push the kids a bit harder this year.   Oops!  Not a good idea.  Becuase, now I realize that I think unschooling (or at least mostly unschooling) is a really good idea, especially for Thomas.  I am also afraid that Thomas won&#39;t learn how to write papers and Daniel won&#39;t learn things like what verbs are.  Most of you are probably giggling at this.  Hopefully,  I will be, too, someday. ;o)  But, for now, I&#39;m scared and afraid to completely let go, while appeasing my husband who was once described by a friend (this was after the friend saw our garage) as being potty-trained at 3 months by a German Hun!  I think my husband was, too.  Well, he did spend part of his infancy in an orphanage which may explain some of it!!!  My is VERY anal, and VERY worried about the kids getting a proper education which includes testing...AAAAHHH!  His whole life revolves around order and disipline.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I filed under homeschooling option 1 in Virginia.  This option says that I can homeschool because I (or my spouse) has a degree.  My only requirement is to  give my kids the CAT (or a similar test) test at the end of the year.  I think I could keep a porfolio instead, but I&#39;m not up for that.  I do keep a daily journal for my husband&#39;s.  Not that he&#39;ll ever look at it, and it was my idea.  But, just in case he gets to be a p.i.t.a, I can stick it in his face and say, &quot;SEE!!!  They are learning!&quot;  For those of you that give your kids an end-of-the-year exam, how do your kids do on the tests and what things can I do to help them?<br/>
<br/>
I have filled our playroom with lots of interesting stuff - maps, cd&#39;s about space and science, games, tons of books.  I bought almost the entire Horribly History and Horribly Science series!  If nothing else, I&#39;ll read them. hee hee  They seem interested in some of them...especially my youngest whose love for learning hasn&#39;t been squelched.  I plan on just leaving them to find those things that interest them and gently encouraging them.<br/>
<br/>
Well, phew!!  I think that&#39;s it...for now. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Linda, <br/>
It is so good to &quot;see&quot; you on this list. The people on this list provide me <br/>
with so much insight into unschooling. Be prepared to have your thoughts <br/>
challenged. This is good. You may balk at first, but you&#39;ll also think about <br/>
what is said. Do not be offended. This is an unschooling list, so that is <br/>
what the people on this list do.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is second generation German immigrant, and fits many of the <br/>
stereotypes of the German people -- discipline, order, black and white <br/>
mentality, structure. Luckily, we live far enough away from his family and <br/>
been away for enough years that he has mellowed tremendously. Plus he lives <br/>
with me, the opposite in many ways. <br/>
<br/>
I recently sent him an article written by Linda Dobson that I found on the <br/>
unschooling newsletter. I wish I kept a copy. It was about children learning <br/>
on their own schedule. It was short but to the point. He really took it to <br/>
heart, and let me know how much respect that he has for how the children are <br/>
learning and how I&#39;m allowing them the learn naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome,<br/>
I hope you get the support (I know this is not a support group, but you guys <br/>
know what I mean) you are looking for. Listen to the veterans. They have so <br/>
much to offer. You&#39;ll quickly figure out who they are. Also consider <br/>
attending the unschooling conference in South Carolina in Oct. I&#39;m trying to <br/>
finagle a way to go.<br/>

Maybe Frank Smith&#39;s book, The Book of Learning and Forgetting would be<br/>
helpful.  It makes the case very strongly that drill is not the best way<br/>
for children to learn.  Even if your husband just read the chapter about<br/>
how a scientist named Ebinghaus promoted &quot;rote learning&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A deeper book about undoing the trauma of being raised by Huns is For<br/>
Your Own Good, by Alice Miller.  I also like Gloria Steinem&#39;s book<br/>
Revolution from Within, with sections about Germanic parenting practices<br/>
destroying self esteem, but that&#39;s probably too touchy-feely for your DH.<br/>
<br/>
** I bought almost the entire Horribly<br/>

We have most of the Horribly Histories, but I didn&#39;t even know there<br/>

<br/>
PS (I&#39;d like to see if there is a way for you to give your children the<br/>
freedom that they crave without having to have an all out fight with<br/>
your husband.  Your husband&#39;s background sounds so sad that I want to<br/>
say, &quot;love him as much as you can and listen to him calmly&quot; so that he<br/>
can be an ally and not an enemy.  But you&#39;ve probably been doing this<br/>
for years, and you know better than I do whether it would bear any fruit.)<br/>
<br/>

verb is.  Also: noun, adjective and adverb.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814371030">Actually, we take the kids quite a few places.  We went to London last fall with the boys.  Thomas is going back to London with my husband in two weeks.  Then we are taking them to Seattle, WA and Vancouver, BC at the end of the month.<br/>
<br/>
Mad Libbs!!!  I totally forgot those.  My kids love them.  Except being that they are boys, every verb and noun is &quot;fart&quot; and every adjective is &quot;smelly&quot;. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We do a fair number of field trips, too.  Okay, I feel better.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting note:  My husband is incredibly smart man.  Without his realizing it, he basically unschooled himself as a child.

&quot;Your efforts may, at first, seem more like scrap lumber randomly scattered<br/>
across the vast universe that is your child rather than a remarkable<br/>
structure you watch rise, floor by measurable floor. But the Eiffel Tower<br/>
didn&#39;t appear overnight, and the most beautiful cathedrals of the world took<br/>
decades to complete.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to think of yourself not as &quot;teacher&quot; the way you remember it, but<br/>
like the supplier whose purpose is merely making sure the builder - your<br/>
child - can get his hands on the necessary materials when he needs them. Be<br/>
happy when you make any sale, however modest. The true architect will use<br/>
the materials in his own way, in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
Schools force a child into using his limited resources today. &quot;Build a bird<br/>
house,&quot; they demand, &quot;so that we may count how many sticks you&#39;ve<br/>
collected.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At home there&#39;s no need for immediate &quot;proof&quot;. Be patient. Don&#39;t measure.<br/>
Who can say what exquisite masterpiece your child will shape and build from<br/>
the scraps tomorrow - or ten years from now? The more he collects, the<br/>
greater the structure he&#39;s capable of building. And when that structure is<br/>
life itself, don&#39;t settle for a bird house today. Trust you&#39;ll find a castle<br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Simply provide the materials.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358741670">My daughter was in scouting for four years.  It is not<br/>
a religious organization unless you live in a highly<br/>
religious area.  When we moved to a new state with a<br/>
new troop who hadn&#39;t known my daughter for as long as<br/>
the other troop did they did ostresize her because she<br/>
was a homeschooler.  So we dropped out, I also had a<br/>
problem with the cookie sales thing.  It was very high<br/>
pressured if you didn&#39;t sell as much as 120 boxes,<br/>
well we didn&#39;t know that many people.  Now we have<br/>
moved again and are going to try a homeschooling 4-H.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620647368">Girl scout troops are supposed to accept anybody.  That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
that everybody follows the girl scout guidelines though.  If she came <br/>
to our troop, she would be accepted, even though a lot of the girls <br/>
in the troop are born again Christians.  My daughter and I don&#39;t say <br/>
the pledge of allegience either.  Also, several of the girls in the <br/>
troop will be homeschooled.  I&#39;m letting the girls decide which <br/>
activities they want to do and I have heard some of them talking <br/>
already.  They are thinking about doing crafts from one of the <br/>
American Girls craft books.  They also want to go snow tubing and <br/>
take skiing lessons.  <br/>
<br/>
If you would be willing to sign up as the leader, you could set the <br/>
tone of the group.  You could make sure that it&#39;s a free, everyone is <br/>
accepted and the girls decide the activities rather than being <br/>
authoritative kind of group.  <br/>

Couldn&#39;t hurt! I would. :-) My dh is very supportive.  I  chat to hm about our day - giving him some highlights, perhaps a great comment from one of the kids, or tell him about soemthing we did/read or somewhere we went. He doesn&#39;t have time to read our hs journal, and this chat gives him a way of seeing what it is we do all day and that the kids are happy and learning. Maybe this sort of oral narration to your dh will help him see the benefits over time...Leonie W. <br/>
