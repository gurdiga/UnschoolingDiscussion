You posted about a school method of teaching as if it was a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t call it what you have called it in this post, but <br/>
I will continue to argue that school math methods to teach memory <br/>
tricks instead of real learning and understanding are not a good path <br/>
for unschoolers to trod and that it can lead to many problems.<br/>

August 22, 2003<br/>
When you were in school, the teacher always had a funny mnemonic for the <br/>
less-than (&lt;) and greater-than (&gt;) signs. One of my teachers did the &quot;alligator&quot; <br/>
thing - the smaller alligator always eats the bigger alligator. I&#39;ve also heard <br/>
of the opposite: the bigger number always &quot;shoots&quot; the smaller one. I always <br/>
had great difficulty remembering the mnemonics (meta-mnemonics, anyone?), and <br/>
how exactly they worked. (Similar to other concepts that require, but <br/>
shouldn&#39;t, my forethought: reading an analog clock, knowing the order of the months <br/>
and alphabets, remembering holidays, how old I am, etc.)<br/>
About a year ago, I finally figured it out. It wasn&#39;t about alligators or <br/>
righteous gunmen, it was all about encoding: less-than was literally &lt;, or the <br/>
start of an element, and greater-than &gt;, the end of an element. It was so <br/>
simple, so blantantly obvious, it borders on the power of an epiphany.<br/>
What interests me most, though, is hearing what mnemonic teachers are using <br/>
nowadays. With kids always knowing more about computers than older folk, are <br/>
HTML and similar markups prevalent enough to make this a more palatable <br/>
comparison? Any one got kids?<br/>

<br/>
What I considered to have been made up was not the alligator [I started to <br/>
say analogy, but it&#39;s not an analogy] trick, but the sudden claim to know LOTS <br/>
of people of all ages who used that to remember greater than.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that it&#39;s a song, though, and it&#39;s on lesson-plan-sharing sites <br/>
online, I figure it&#39;s been in lots of classrooms and so it&#39;s more widespread than <br/>
originally presented. <br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t make it good or useful for this list.<br/>

I asked my kids about this.  The two girls are very familiar with it, the 15 <br/>
year old tells me she still will use that to run a problem through her head <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
She said to her it is useful and cute and she like it.  At her elementary <br/>
school they were the Garrisonville Gators.  She thought it was made up just for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Since she still uses it without textbook learning or classroom setting, it <br/>
must have been something useful for her.<br/>
<br/>
Just what I&#39;ve learned today about it from my kids.<br/>

My mom was a school teacher for years in private and public schools. I<br/>
always went to school and my oldest has always gone to school. I have never<br/>
heard about the alligator &lt; &gt; thing at all. In fact, it took awhile for me<br/>
to figure it out. (sigh)<br/>
