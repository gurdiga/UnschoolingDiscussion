<div id="ygrps-yiv-497849522">I do not want my son to go back to public school!! We are starting <br/>
this really late, age 13, but I see no alternative. He is not only <br/>
not excelling in school, but is constantly in trouble. When I try to <br/>
assess the situation and the reason for his actions I am met with <br/>
resistance and everyone is only conerned about the rules. Never mind <br/>
the reason for the behavior. My best friend is imploring me to not <br/>
send him back and she knows him almost as well as myself. He is an <br/>
auditory learner, but this is not respected in public schools. His <br/>
reading and writing is not the best, but not the worst either. We are <br/>
just beginning and would like any information, websites, etc. that <br/>
would be helpful. I work fulltime and am a single parent of 2. His <br/>
older sister does very well in public school, is a cheerleader, etc. <br/>
They are completely different. HELP!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-36406896">I may be the first person to answer your query but I know I&#39;m not the <br/>
best since I just have 7 year old boys I am unschooling.  I am a former <br/>
public high school teacher, however.  I&#39;ll tell you what I think.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that what you are going to have to go through will require <br/>
a lot of patience on your part.  There will be a long period of time <br/>
where he will appear to be doing nothing at all except maybe watching TV <br/>
for hours on end.  Or, maybe he will choose to read or play computer <br/>
games instead.  Who knows what he will choose?  Well, maybe you do, <br/>
since you&#39;re his mother.  He will have to go through a process, or <br/>
period of time, call &quot;deschooling&quot;.  This means that you basically just <br/>
allow him to do what he wishes.  This may last a couple of years, or <br/>
more.  The theory, however, is that he will find his own way and choose <br/>
to learn what is important to him.  And, what he chooses to learn, he <br/>
will learn VERY WELL.<br/>
<br/>
As a former public school teacher, I highly recommend you do not put him <br/>
back in school, especially if he is an auditory learner.  I am assuming, <br/>
of course, that he doesn&#39;t want to go back either.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that institutionalized education is very harmful to <br/>
children of any age.  It does not respect the individual and produces <br/>
very passive students.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add, however, that, certainly, if a child wishes to go <br/>
to school s/he should be allowed to do so and come to their own decision <br/>
whether it is for them or not.  I definitely feel this way with regard <br/>
to older children.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I have helped a little bit.  I&#39;m sure someone else, with more <br/>
experience, will be more helpful.<br/>

Sorry.. I missed the age of your son but I have $.02 to throw in the mix. I&#39;d let him read The Teenage Liberation Handbook if he *thinks* he wants to return to school. Going to school to be with your friends is kinda lame imo because you don&#39;t really get to *do* much with them and there&#39;s very little interaction.  It would be great if your ds could develop a friendship with someone outside of the system, like a mentor, but until he discovers what his interests are, this would be a little hard to do.<br/>
Can you get him involved in volunteering so that he has some social interaction outside the home? Maybe if you replace that &#39;loss&#39;, he&#39;d prefer to unschool afterall.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dawn, I don&#39;t know where you live, but you may want to see if there <br/>
is any kind of alternative school in your area.<br/>
<br/>
When I lived in California, I chose a Sudbury school (being a single <br/>
mother myself, I couldn&#39;t be home). It was great. He got the <br/>
unschooling that children need AND he got the conversation and <br/>
interaction of age ranges that kids also need to learn from life.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to Sudbury, there are MANY wonderful democratic unschools <br/>
across the US and in many other countrys.<br/>
<br/>
It would be worth it for you to check it out. As least you will have <br/>
another option for your son to choose what is best for him.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
