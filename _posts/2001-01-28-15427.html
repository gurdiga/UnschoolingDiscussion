<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594294965">Just to jump in here - one of the things I really enjoy about this list is<br/>
learning about other people&#39;s spiritual and/or religious practices and<br/>
beliefs.  I belong to a list with like-minded people, spiritually speaking,<br/>
but we discuss our common beliefs and philosophies,  here I can learn about<br/>
different ideas, experiences, and cultural practices.  I would really be sad<br/>
if we no longer felt comfortable sharing these things.  It&#39;s one thing to<br/>
read a book, but so much better to actually hear what &#39;real&#39; people do in<br/>
their everyday lives.  Or to be able to share resources for further<br/>
exploration into different ideologies.  Obviously even in the &#39;Christian&#39;<br/>
culture there are extreme differences of opinion & practices, it would be<br/>
nice to be able to share these differences with respect for one another.  I<br/>
feel that with small exceptions, that is what takes place here.  When people<br/>
immediately want to drop the subject, that does remind me of my Mother,<br/>
kicking me under the table, reminding me to stick to safe subjects like the<br/>
weather.  Unschooling in general is a &#39;risky&#39; subject, so it seems ironic<br/>
that we would be afraid of other &#39;risky&#39; topics.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with the sentiments regarding politics, religion, and<br/>
unschooling- they are linked whether we admit it or not.  We are in a<br/>
situation that requires vigilance, and political action to protect the<br/>
rights we currently have, and we need to keep these discussions alive.  Well<br/>
anyway that&#39;s my opinion, offered with respect to all.<br/>
