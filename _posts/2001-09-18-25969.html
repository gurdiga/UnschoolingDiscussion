<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757106627">This is so cool! My almost-2-yr-old loves garbage trucks too! (But not so much so<br/>
that I think she wants to go to the landfill--uck!) OTOH, we could park outside<br/>
the entrance and watch the trucks come and go--hm...this is sounding pretty good<br/>
after all! Where&#39;s the landfill?<br/>
<br/>
I ran into a person named Dawn at the park meeting today, but it wasn&#39;t you...I<br/>
thought I met you once last year, but now I think I just had you pointed out or<br/>
something.<br/>
