<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020874982">hello all!<br/>
<br/>
It has been a balm for me to read the posts on this list, having <br/>
lurked for a couple of weeks. I am an unschooler who is trying to <br/>
adjust to working and handing over 80% of the at home stuff to my <br/>
newly unemployed dh.  We are redesigning our life, he is finishing <br/>
school and becoming a piano teacher/tuner. I teach drama, creative <br/>
writing and history to homeschoolers, and also work for a tutoring <br/>
agency...life has gone from highly structured to wildly hit and <br/>
miss. I am finally starting to get accustomed, but now we are moving <br/>
to the other side of the state! I have three daughters and they are <br/>
great, way more adjustable than their mother.<br/>
<br/>
I used Seton tests last year and they were, by far, the least <br/>
expensive and least time consuming way to honor the testing <br/>
regulation. They were 25.00 a piece and that included scoring. They <br/>
do not give much added info or commentary, which was fine, because I <br/>
didnt care to have it. It did show me which areas my children had <br/>
not worked on that year(or at all, really) such as some language <br/>
mechanics, capitalization and punctuation. This was just <br/>
information, nothing I worried about or that affected my plan for <br/>
the next year. My youngest did worry about it, so I bought her a <br/>
couple of workbooks to practice, if and when she wanted to. She did <br/>
and those things improved. The other two didnt really care. They <br/>
seem to learn that stuff when they need it, in the context of <br/>
wanting something they write to make more sense to them and to <br/>
whoever is reading it.<br/>
<br/>
Thats all, thanks for being there. Hope I helped.<br/>
<br/>

But if you HAVE a plan for next year, that doesn&#39;t sound like unschooling to <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered not showing them the test scores?  Have you considered <br/>
not even looking at them yourself?  They do tend to divide the world into school <br/>
years and school levels, neither of which need to affect real-life learning.<br/>

Sometimes they like to see whats what(and including test scores) and <br/>
no matter how I tell them that it doesnt matter, there are people in <br/>
their lives( well meaning grandparents, mostly) who ask them awkward <br/>
questions. They discovered that tossing the bone of having taken the <br/>
test shortens the discussions they have with these people and frees <br/>
them up to continue doing whatever they were doing before the <br/>
converstation started. Does this make sense? Also, what if my almost <br/>
14 year old really wants to see her test scores? I try to encourage <br/>
an environment where she(and her sisters) create their own learning, <br/>
and if she expresses interest in her test, is it right to withhold <br/>
it from her? Thats why I shared them with the kids in the first <br/>
place.<br/>
Does anyone have suggestions to stem the tide of those well-meaning <br/>
folk that are related to us and their concern about standards?<br/>
We are learning, as a family, to disregard the opinions of other, <br/>
more school-minded folk, but I could use some encouragement on how <br/>
to do that from the folks on this list.<br/>
Thanks for challenging me, I needed that!<br/>

As long as you keep getting them school supplies and resources, it&#39;s not <br/>
going to &quot;translate&quot; very well at all.  If you want to unschool, you can do it!  <br/>
If you want to keep doing school informally, it will be school still.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to test every year where you are?  <br/>
Do you have to test at all?<br/>

back and watch the great changes in your children. It took my Mom a <br/>
few years but she came around and is now a supporter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757641309">hey<br/>
yes, I have to test once a year in my state(Washington) and so I <br/>
wonder how to make that easier on them.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your thoughts, I am genuinely trying to unschool, that <br/>
is my desire...sometimes I admit I am such a product of the public <br/>
school system, my first impulse is to do it the school way, whatever <br/>
it might be. I know that we can do this, we can unschool, but I have <br/>
had so many false starts. I have a lot to learn(or unlearn, as the <br/>
case may be, smile)<br/>
thanks for the input,<br/>
Teresa<br/>
