 </span></blockquote>We had a similar problem this year.  My mom, who is<br/>
usually most understanding and supportive, chose this<br/>
past Saturday to &quot;let me have it&quot; about not receiving<br/>
thank you notes from the kids for the christmas<br/>
presents she gave them.<br/>
<br/>
Now, she gave the presents to them in person, and they<br/>
thanked her most profusely and hugged on her on<br/>
Christmas Day.<br/>
<br/>
It had only been a week since Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
AND she knew I had been dealing with a very sick child<br/>
for the whole week, so had very little sleep, nor<br/>
could I really focus on anything but finding out what<br/>
was wrong with my sick child and helping him.<br/>
<br/>
So, after hanging up on her...<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the thank you notes for my boys on the<br/>
computer and asked them to sign them.  The 5yo added a<br/>
drawing of the grim reaper (and I tried not to laugh<br/>
at the irony).  Sarah chose to type her own, and made<br/>
it long and chatty and perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, mus suggestion is that you could ask your son<br/>
to dictate the thank you notes to you while you type<br/>
them out for him, then he could just sign his name. <br/>
No one needs to see the spelling mistakes or the<br/>
handwriting that way, and it is easier on old-folks&#39;<br/>
eyes anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a little boy who would rather be playing with the<br/>
toys than writing something and is now free from<br/>
grading.  Let him be and satisfy your relatives&#39; need<br/>
for a thank you note in a stress-free manner.<br/>

We don&#39;t do &#39;thank yous&#39;, I&#39;m not sure why, just not a thing my DH&#39;s family or mine ever practiced. Well, I have written them on occasion but would never expect one. I give a gift to give the gift, not to get the thank you. Poo poo to your mom. :)<br/>

<br/>
My husband&#39;s mom wants them badly.  Sometimes I&#39;ve managed to get a kid to do <br/>
one, usually typed or drawn, but often I&#39;ll write a follow-up at Christmas <br/>
being chit-chatty about what various people did with the money she sent. <br/>
<br/>
For years and years (maybe always, come to think of it) they have sent money <br/>
for Christmas.  $25 check for each person.   I gave mine to Marty and he got a <br/>
video game with mine and his.   Holly and Kirby bought gifts. Keith probably <br/>
paid for a small part of the power bill. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We used to give the grandparents gifts, but for the past several years we <br/>
haven&#39;t bothered.  We were there one christmas and what they didn&#39;t return,  his <br/>
mom laughed about (derisively, like &quot;Why would we want THIS?&quot;).   When we gave <br/>
them a copy of the Linda Dobson book which had Kirby and Marty&#39;s picture and <br/>
quotes from them, they gave it back the next time they gave us a pile of <br/>
national geographics.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s true, and if I can do it without upsetting her, I<br/>
might.  <br/>
<br/>
She really is a wonderful person and usually so<br/>
supportive that she just caught me on a day when I had<br/>
very little sleep all week and was quite worried about<br/>
the 5yo being sick (we thought he had an appendicitis<br/>
but turned out to have an impacted bowel) but holding<br/>
all my worries in so as not to worry the children (or<br/>
her and my dad).  I guess I was as emotionally<br/>
constipated as my son was physically! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise I would have just blown it off as being her<br/>
old-fashioned southern upbringing (she is 69 after<br/>
all) would have made a joke about it and told her we<br/>
would get around to it eventually.<br/>
<br/>
But I think my 5yos take on the whole thing was way<br/>
funnier.  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199330400">My mom always had me do thank you&#39;s when I was little. I don&#39;t remember<br/>
thinking it was a hassle. I do remember people telling me afterwards how<br/>
sweet and kind I was for sending them. I guess I liked that and so didn&#39;t<br/>
mind doing them.<br/>
<br/>
So I pretty much send thank you&#39;s for things. If people are right here and I<br/>
see them all the time, I don&#39;t. But I will let them know how much I<br/>
appreciate *whatever* and do things for them along the way also.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t send them for Christmas. Not sure why, but I do send them from the<br/>
kids for their birthdays. Sometimes when I ask, the will sign their name, if<br/>
they don&#39;t want to, I&#39;ll sign it for them. It&#39;s just something I find very<br/>
nice to do because I know how I feel when I get a thank you note for<br/>
something.<br/>
