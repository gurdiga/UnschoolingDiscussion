&lt;&lt; I tend to think that Papa Bear could be a little<br/>
 creative, himself. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree, he needs a jolt of creativity once in a while. I think he hesitates <br/>
to initiate any change because I&#39;ve bit his head off for getting controlling <br/>
over bedtimes and such.<br/>
He knows how I feel about the kids choosing and that I&#39;m a night owl.<br/>
So he tends to try and respect that by leaving well enough alone.<br/>
Problem is, things have gotten a bit booooring lately and he isn&#39;t the type <br/>
to say &quot;let&#39;s go out honey&quot; or think of something unusual to do.<br/>
Kinda bugs me sometimes, but then he&#39;s good at other things so I try to honor <br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775204019">I have been reading all the posts about bedtime, and we worried for <br/>
years about why my boys needed to nurse seemingly alllllll night, <br/>
when would the 4 year old sleep in his own bed, when will they be <br/>
able to fall asleep without us? Well, it has waffled a bit, the 2 <br/>
older boys spent the last 3 years mostly sharing a room which was <br/>
directly off of our master bedroom, while the youngest had a twin <br/>
bed next to our king--and went between each.  HOWEVER, since we have <br/>
moved, and have a typical &quot;split style&quot; home with the master a bit <br/>
removed from the other 2 bedrooms, ALL the boys are sleeping in our <br/>
room.  The 5 year old in our bed, the 8 year old in the adjacent <br/>
twin, and the 13 year old was on the floor until I moved in his <br/>
queen bed into our room yesterday. --why should he sleep on the <br/>
floor when there are so many empty beds in the house?  No, we don&#39;t <br/>
have a lot of romantic nights--haven&#39;t quite figured out when/where <br/>
when everyone is up until 11, and then we are ALL tired, BUT I do <br/>
know that they feel immense love, safety, thankfulness and happiness <br/>
all sleeping in our one bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
DH loves it too--minus the lack of alone time, and the bottom <br/>
line....it won&#39;t last forever--such a shame I think!  All the <br/>
worrying, thinking about, researching etc was exhausting!--sure wish <br/>
someone had just laid it out for me from day 1!--- Just stop and <br/>
think about your kids, their needs and how you can meet those <br/>
needs!  You know, our DNA is wired to NEED to sleep in the safety of <br/>
others.  Without the safety of other humans sleeping near, your <br/>
survival is at risk (wild animals, cold etc).  Some things take <br/>
100&#39;s-1000&#39;s of years to leave our hard wiring.  And some things <br/>
should not be pushed out so fast!  I also think the nighttime <br/>
togetherness is a silent bonding between all of us.  Not to mention, <br/>
who would cover them up for the 8th time at night if it were not <br/>
me???<br/>

we say, less than stellar that the shared bed is so healing.  I love  <br/>
sleeping with Shelby.  I&#39;ll miss it so much when she doesn&#39;t want that  <br/>
anymore.  :-(<br/>
