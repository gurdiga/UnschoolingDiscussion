<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048111701">I understand!  I have always had to deal with this in<br/>
my son&#39;s 3 years of life!  Several of his friends have<br/>
food allergies as well as having parents who prefer<br/>
them to have certain foods over others.  This includes<br/>
organic foods only and NO SUGAR!  I&#39;m way into organic<br/>
foods and definately prefer my child to eat them, but<br/>
at the same time let them eat that blue popsicle or<br/>
Duncan Hines chocolate cake if they want it.  I can<br/>
understand diets limited due to food allergies, but it<br/>
also does make it a challenge especially at potlucks<br/>
and parties.  I am just now expressing to their<br/>
parents how hard it must be for them, and inquiring<br/>
how the child feels when they can&#39;t eat something but<br/>
their friends can.  What the parents have told me is<br/>
that their child is coming to understand how they<br/>
don&#39;t feel good after eating a particular food; so<br/>
that&#39;s why they avoid it.  But, I do not think they<br/>
give the child a choice to eat it or not even in the<br/>
case of allergies.  With a severe peanut allergy, I<br/>
can understand not giving the choice as a result could<br/>
be anaphylactic shock and death.  But what about less<br/>
severe allergies?  Should the parent regulate?  Or<br/>
say, okay, eat dairy if you want to but you will get<br/>
congested and have an eczema flair up.  I have been<br/>
challenged to use all sorts of substitutes like spelt<br/>
and rice flour instead of wheat, soy instead of dairy,<br/>
goat instead of cow, honey, date sugar, maple syrup<br/>
instead of sugar.  But, I&#39;ve felt bad/guilty for<br/>
making something for a potluck that had sugar in it. <br/>
Also, I have felt bad for using a non-organic egg in<br/>
something for a potluck!  So much so that I pray no<br/>
one asks less I get exposed!<br/>
<br/>
I am dealing with this issue, again, currently with my<br/>
son&#39;s 3rd birthday party.  Pizza potluck.  Easy<br/>
enough?  Everyone can bring their own individual pizza<br/>
to share, right?  But will there be enough wheat free,<br/>
gluten free, organic, soy cheese, no flour crust pizza<br/>
for everyone who needs it?  God, I hope so!  And what<br/>
about the cake?  My son WANTS a chocolate cake.  Fine,<br/>
he gets it.  Unfortunately I know not every parent<br/>
will want their child to eat chocolate.  So, do I get<br/>
a second non-chocolate cake to make sure everyone&#39;s<br/>
dietary needs get made?  Sorry, can&#39;t do it this time.<br/>
 I know that because it will be a chocolate cake,<br/>
probably made with sugar and flour and possibly with a<br/>
non-organic egg if we happen to be out of organic eggs<br/>
that some kids will get none.  I will feel bad.  I<br/>
will also feel uncomfortable but I&#39;m so busy being a<br/>
mom of two small boys that I just can&#39;t accomodate<br/>
everyone anymore.  Should I make sure to have a cow<br/>
dairy, soy and goat&#39;s ice cream so everyone gets to<br/>
eat ice cream?  I really hate for someone not to be<br/>
able to partake, but it is also a lot of stress and<br/>
energy on my part.  I&#39;m lucky that neither of my<br/>
children, nor I have any food allergies.  But if we<br/>
did, I don&#39;t think I would expect there to always be<br/>
alternatives for us, and I would bring<br/>
substitutes/options for my children.  <br/>
<br/>
Any advice on how to deal with these food challenges<br/>
would be welcomed!<br/>

birthdays or get-togethers, i make what we can eat.  everybody knows this<br/>

that yet)  on the flip side, i bring foods we can eat whenever we are out or<br/>
at a party or we eat what&#39;s there.  i/we will pay for it later (ds has major<br/>

invite, who&#39;s RSVP&#39;d, who I haven&#39;t heard from, who got a thank-you,<br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the items I keep track of as the RSVPs come in is food<br/>
allergies/sensitivities/etc.  This way, I tailor the food for the<br/>
guests who are coming.  <br/>
<br/>
On our family, we have a diabetic, a celiac, two shell-fish allergies,<br/>
and a peanut-allergy.  While the diabetic and celiac won&#39;t drop dead<br/>
if they have sugar/gluten, the long term effects are equally serious,<br/>
so we don&#39;t encourage anyone to cheat.  (For a celiac, the gluten in<br/>
one crouton causes the antibody formation that takes 6 months of<br/>
gluten-free eating to remove.  The antibodies flatten the villi in the<br/>
intestine, which, if continued, irreversibly destroy the villi<br/>
function).  <br/>
<br/>
I generally ask what sort of accomodations need to be made, and most<br/>
of my friends offer to bring something or offer good, easy<br/>
suggestions.  I really like your pizza-potluck (though honestly, most<br/>
non-celiacs aren&#39;t going to touch the GF pizza . . . so there should<br/>
be plenty).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391304476">Hi,<br/>
You certainly are lucky not to have to deal with food sensitivities <br/>
and allergies.  We do. IT&#39;s a pain in the butt. I try to keep things <br/>
out of the house that my son can&#39;t have. His reactions aren&#39;t true <br/>
allergies, but more a sensitivity that manifests in absolutely out of <br/>
control behavior on his part, very much like a child with severe ADHD <br/>
and also some digestive problems. ANd his is corn syrup and high <br/>
fructose corn syrup (the behaviour)as well as certain kinds of dairy<br/>
(the digestive problems). I have no issues with sugar, it&#39;s the corn <br/>
syrup crap that he really just can&#39;t have. He doesn&#39;t want it, <br/>
because of how he acts, and this is when he doesn&#39;t know it has it. <br/>
I&#39;ve tried that to make sure it wasn&#39;t just him trying to get away <br/>
with something.It&#39;s also how I found out that most hot dogs and hot <br/>
dog buns have highfructose/corn syrup in them. I have since learned <br/>
to be very dilligent in reading labels. <br/>
What I do, is I&#39;ll usually talk to a hostess and I&#39;ll bring <br/>
something, or if she&#39;s willing to read a label, then maybe she&#39;ll <br/>
find a brand of cake mix that doesn&#39;t have the corn syrup or high <br/>
fructose stuff, or if we go to a potluck, I&#39;ll make sure I take <br/>
something that he considers a real treat. It may not be the same as <br/>
what the other kids are eating, but he understands.The corn syrup is <br/>
much more of a problem than a little bit of dairy.(he can tolerate <br/>
small amounts without problems)<br/>
 A while back, his dad was eating a carton of ice cream,and he had a <br/>
little bit of it. He really, really wanted more. He bugged me and his <br/>
dad a lot. I finally just said fine. You know what I have told you <br/>
this will do to you. You understand, right? He said yes. I asked him <br/>
if he still wanted it, when he knew what I had said it would do to <br/>
him. (he gets bowel cramps and really bad diarhea) He said yes. So I <br/>
gave it to him. I really tried to be empathetic the next day when he <br/>
was running to the bathroom all morning, and his tummy was upset all <br/>
day. I did feel sorry for him, he was only 5, but since then, he has <br/>
never asked for more than his quarter cup of ice cream that his body <br/>
WILL tolerate. <br/>
Sometimes, natural consequences are the only thing that teaches them <br/>
that what you are trying to tell them is really real. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>YIKES!!!  This is really scary - are you SURE it isn&#39;t a life or <br/>
death situation?  My understanding of allergies is that they can <br/>
escalate - and if it is so severe that her eyes are swelling shut at <br/>
times, aren&#39;t you afraid that the same could happen with her <br/>
throat?  You might want to get a second opinion on what your doctor <br/>
has said about the seriousness of this - it&#39;s certainly making my <br/>
hair stand on end... I hope I&#39;m making a big deal out of nothing, <br/>
but I&#39;m afraid I might not be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*LOL*<br/>
Actually, these friends of ours are our *best* friends<br/>
and are really awesome, loving people.  They just have<br/>
lots of food restrictions due to &#39;health&#39; reasons.  It<br/>
is definately a challenge though because we give our<br/>
children so much more freedom regarding food choices<br/>
than many of our friends.  They are very &#39;secure&#39; in<br/>
their food choices for their children, and I don&#39;t<br/>
think they intentionally try to make us feel guilty<br/>
about ours, but sometimes I do feel an underlining<br/>
vibe of &#39;superiority&#39; because I let my son eat as many<br/>
french fries with as much ketchup as he wants where<br/>
the other parent will point out other foods on the<br/>
plate that their child should eat first and more of<br/>
because it is &#39;better&#39; for them.<br/>
<br/>
It does take away a lot of the fun when friends are<br/>
over and Sebastian (3 years) helps himself to the<br/>
cookies in the cupboard (or organic juice in the<br/>
fridge that happens to have *sugar* in it) and offers<br/>
some to his friends only to have that parent say, no,<br/>
you can&#39;t have that.  Once a parent in this situation<br/>
told her son quitly that he couldn&#39;t have something<br/>
because it wasn&#39;t the best choice for him, and she has<br/>
to take care of him the best that she can.  This did<br/>
make me feel guilty as if she was saying I wasn&#39;t<br/>
taking care of my child the best I could.<br/>
<br/>
Although we&#39;re best friends, and our parenting style<br/>
has been so similar up to this point, I think that now<br/>
our children are coming of *school* age, there are<br/>
some major differences arising in how we treat and<br/>
raise our children.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to meeting some unschooling<br/>
families especially with children of similar ages to<br/>
ours.  You would think in Eugene there would be a lot.<br/>
 *looking far and wide for unschoolers in Eugene,<br/>
Oregon*<br/>

It sounds like she WAS saying you weren&#39;t doing the best you could.  I think<br/>
she probably could have found a better way to deny her son what he wanted<br/>

It&#39;s sounds like it&#39;s sort of an &quot;unschooling school&quot; if you can believe<br/>
it ;)  I found the link recently looking at various online<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling/alternative education stuff; they modeled<br/>
themselves on the Sudbury Valley Free School which has been going for<br/>
something like 30 years now.  If you visit it I, at least, would be<br/>
interested in hearing what it&#39;s like.<br/>

It also looks like Grace Llewellyn, author of &quot;The Teenage Liberation<br/>

fructose corn syrup (the behaviour)as well as certain kinds of dairy<br/>
(the digestive problems). I have no issues with sugar, it&#39;s the corn<br/>
syrup crap that he really just can&#39;t have.**<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that eventually that researchers will find out that <br/>
high-fructose corn syrup is a major factor in the reason that <br/>
American-style diets raise the levels of type 2 diabetes in cultures <br/>
that start eating our fast foods and junk food.  (The so-called American <br/>
diet, instead of their traditional diet).<br/>
<br/>
So I think there is probably a significant long-term health benefit for <br/>
all of you in avoiding the stuff.  It could be like a silver lining.<br/>
<br/>
(Some of my negativity about HF corn syrup comes from Dr. Weil&#39;s book <br/>
Eating Well for Optimum Health.  Some of it is just pulled out of my <br/>
*head* as I ask myself &quot;what&#39;s different about the American diet&quot; -- <br/>
lots of cheap corn.  &quot;what&#39;s different about the modern diet&quot; -- food <br/>
processing using artificial ingredients, esp. partially hydrogenated <br/>
oils and high fructose corn syrup.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this is true.  It&#39;s my personal paranoid theory.  My PP <br/>
theories about the school system are right, so it&#39;s possible I could be <br/>
right about other stuff. &lt;g&gt;  Just because &quot;everyone else does it&quot;, <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I think something is good for kids.  (workbooks OR <br/>
artificial fats or sweeteners)<br/>

**(he gets bowel cramps and really bad diarhea)**<br/>
<br/>
My mom is very similar. She can tolerate tiny amounts.  But she will <br/>
indulge in dairy foods up to once a week and live with the <br/>
consequences.  (I get to hear the details a lot! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

I have used Lactaid on occasion since then, both for myself and my <br/>
son. I hadn&#39;t found them then and had forgotten about them recently. <br/>
We have just tended to avoid the stuff since neither of my kids <br/>
really like most dairy anyway. They can have yogurt and cheese <br/>
without noticeable problems. And yes, they love frozen yogurt. I have <br/>
done both freezing the little cups of yogurt(both soy and organic so <br/>
we don&#39;t get the corn syrup) with a stick in it like a popcicle, and <br/>
we also do what we call yogurt shakes.(juice, yogurt and frozen <br/>
fruit) They really like the soy based smoothies from the local health <br/>
food store, and really, really like rice dream..<br/>
ANd we occasionally(maybe once a month) go to Cold stone creamery, <br/>
and we all get a small. That is about the limit of what my son can <br/>
digest with out any trouble, but I really need to get some more <br/>
lactaid to keep in my bag for when we do that. Thanks for reminding <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-233940250">&lt;&lt; My understanding of allergies is that they can escalate - &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They can also fade as children get older, and ANY reactions like that can be <br/>
stress-related or made worse by stress.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known a few moms who seemed to REALLY want their kids to have allergies <br/>
or learning disabilities or something so they had something to fret and tut <br/>
about, and something to blame things on.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to say I was allergic to chocolate, and nylon.  What I think my <br/>
real problem was was not having enough baths, not owning a shower.   My skin <br/>
problems were from sweat and stress.   But my mom felt like a good mom when she <br/>
had things to forbid me.  When a friend at school suggested I should take more <br/>
baths, when I was 11, I started doing that.  But my mom was sure I was <br/>
allergic to bubble bath and soap.  So I used Ivory soap and Skin-so-Soft, which feel <br/>
good but don&#39;t really get you clean.    <br/>
<br/>
Had my mom backed off and let me experiment on my own, things would have been <br/>
better in more than two ways.   But she didn&#39;t.   And and I fully believe she <br/>
was wrong.<br/>

I know I personally feel better when I avoid it too. In Europe, they <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871840870">&lt;&lt;&lt;It does take away a lot of the fun when friends are<br/>
over and Sebastian (3 years) helps himself to the<br/>
cookies in the cupboard (or organic juice in the<br/>
fridge that happens to have *sugar* in it) and offers<br/>
some to his friends only to have that parent say, no,<br/>
you can&#39;t have that.  Once a parent in this situation<br/>
told her son quitly that he couldn&#39;t have something<br/>
because it wasn&#39;t the best choice for him, and she has<br/>
to take care of him the best that she can.  This did<br/>
make me feel guilty as if she was saying I wasn&#39;t<br/>
taking care of my child the best I could.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like someone trying in a passive/aggressive manner to make you<br/>
feel &quot;less than&quot;. It won&#39;t enhance the relationship between the children<br/>
either, since it could end up with Sebastian feeling he needs to defend you<br/>
to his friend if the friend starts repeating that stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I love it when Jayn wants to be a kind a host, and offers her favorite foods<br/>
and candies to her friends.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Although we&#39;re best friends, and our parenting style<br/>
has been so similar up to this point, I think that now<br/>
our children are coming of *school* age, there are<br/>
some major differences arising in how we treat and<br/>
raise our children.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes relationships don&#39;t survive these kinds of fundamental<br/>
philosophical differences. Many of us have told stories of friendships<br/>
fading away or ending more harshly. Personally I recommend &quot;fading away&quot;,<br/>
since that leaves the door open for reconciliation if people&#39;s philosophies<br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
In my case it has been less sad when the friendship died a natural death<br/>
than I would have supposed. Others have had different levels of regret.<br/>
<br/>
None of us have an obligation to keep negative people in the forefront of<br/>
our lives. For the sake of harmonious family life, it is really the<br/>
opposite. That is kind of where this thread began, with my concerns about<br/>
some &quot;negative energy&quot; kids - although Jayn doesn&#39;t find them so, which is<br/>
why they are still able to come here sometimes. Once we move to a new home,<br/>
I won&#39;t look back on their visits with any nostalgia whatsoever.<br/>

Three (3) of my teacher-friends retired this year, all this same year.  I <br/>
would&#39;ve already retired if I had taught every year I think.<br/>
<br/>
But all three were critical of homeschooling when Kirby ws little.  now <br/>

friends. Quality, not quantity.<br/>

Don&#39;t let yourself be shamed by the mom voices or granny voices or teacher <br/>

&gt; severe allergies?  Should the parent regulate?  Or<br/>
&gt; say, okay, eat dairy if you want to but you will get<br/>
&gt; congested and have an eczema flair up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just want to make the point that not all dairy allergies are just <br/>
congestion and exzema.  You probably know that, but it is an <br/>
important point I think. <br/>
<br/>
My son had multiple food allergies which have been completely cured <br/>
through the use of homeopathic remedies.  What I used to do is try to <br/>
guess (or call ahead and ask) what foods would be there when we went <br/>
somewhere to eat.  If it was a birthday party, I would make a wheat-<br/>
free, dairy-free, peanut free cake and take it along.  I always had <br/>
acceptable cookies or crackers in my purse in case we went somewhere <br/>
that gave out free cookies, so I could give him one without him <br/>
feeling like he was missing out.  <br/>
<br/>
But once I slacked and didn&#39;t have a special piece of cake with me at <br/>
a family birthday party.  AND they had shrimp fried in butter and <br/>
someone made me feel guilty, as if I was depriving him, and I gave in <br/>
and let him eat everything.  He had cake and shrimp and butter all at <br/>
once and his face and throat swelled and he could barely breathe.  I <br/>
was a few seconds away from calling 911.  Very scary.  The same kind <br/>
of thing happened from just eating cantalope.  <br/>
<br/>
Thankfully we don&#39;t have to deal with those issues at all anymore <br/>
because of homeopathy.  He even eats peanuts with no problem again.  <br/>
He still wants nothing to do with cantalope or seafood, but that <br/>
might be more because of remembering bad things that happened when he <br/>
ate them.  I think he *could* eat them if he wanted to.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any advice on how to deal with these food challenges<br/>
&gt; would be welcomed!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s your responsibility to cater to everyone&#39;s food <br/>
preferences or even to everyone&#39;s food allergies.  Some simple <br/>
courtesies like having *some* dairy free and *some* wheat free <br/>
choices are good, but I don&#39;t think you have to be a special order <br/>
cook to everyone.  Maybe put something in the invitation that there <br/>
will be chocolate, non-organic birthday cake and that you won&#39;t be <br/>
offended if anyone needs to bring special cake of their own because <br/>
of food allergies.  <br/>

regularly eat ice cream, make sure you have rice dream in the freezer <br/>
too.  Then they can sit down and have their rice dream and ice cream <br/>
together.  I used to do the same thing with meals--almost everything <br/>
I cooked had a similar-looking dairy-free version.  For example, if I <br/>
made macaroni and cheese, I&#39;d also make boxed dairy free macaroni and <br/>
cheese from the health food store or else boil some quinoia macaroni-<br/>
shaped noodles and melt some dairy-free butter over them.  <br/>

<br/>
I think they should say &quot;might.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, allergies are grown out of by lots of people.<br/>
For another thing, it&#39;s better learning if a kid gets congestion because of <br/>
milk, not because of his mother&#39;s curse. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Learning from the thing itself with a parent saying &quot;poor thing&quot; is better <br/>
than being denied the thing by the parent.  The parent could be wrong.  But now <br/>
the thing is desired and the parent is not.<br/>

<br/>
As long as the child has knowledge of the food intollerance, I might not say<br/>
anything at all.  If they need reminding then prehaps mention that a<br/>
reaction to eating the food is a possibility.  I have asthma and am<br/>
sensitive to dairy products.  I avoid them most of the time, but put a pizza<br/>
in front of me and all of that knowledge goes by the wayside.  I&#39;m willing<br/>
to use my inhaler more frequently for a few days in exchange for a greek<br/>
style pizza.<br/>
<br/>
If the child does have a reaction to the food, then he/she can make future<br/>
decisions about the food according to their willingness (or not) to deal<br/>
with the side effects.<br/>
