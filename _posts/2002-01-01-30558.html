Since moving to America we seem to have gathered more clutter but have<br/>
less cupboards to hide it in. I spend my life tripping over kids<br/>
projects. They&#39;ve got into sculpey in a big wayand the stuff is<br/>
everywhere!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Being somewhat of a collector of &#39;stuff&#39; myself and having lived in a <br/>
tiny house (teeny-tiny) until just recently, I&#39;ve mastered the art of <br/>
dealing with clutter. <br/>
Clear storage boxes are fantastic. For craft stuff, clear boxes on <br/>
rolling casters is even better. For tons of books, put in shelf <br/>
brackets and wooden boards/shelves along the ceiling of your rooms <br/>
(about a foot from the ceiling).  Over-the-door pockets on all doors <br/>
are super organized things.<br/>
Use fishing tackle boxes to store jewelry or make up in. They&#39;re also <br/>
great for nails, screws and stuff like that.<br/>
I can pack a ton of stuff in a tiny space:-)<br/>

did, but they aren&#39;t lace ups.  I don&#39;t worry about shining my sink except <br/>
when I&#39;ve just finished doing dishes.  I&#39;ve made up my own routines, and I <br/>
have a ways to go with them, but my baby steps are working.  My house is <br/>
way cleaner and tidier than it used to be.<br/>
