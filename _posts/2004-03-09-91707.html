<div id="ygrps-yiv-763142402">OMG...I just saw a blurb on the news about recess being cut from my <br/>
local area elementary schools!  I don&#39;t normally watch the news but, <br/>
when I saw this I just couldn&#39;t change it (even though I know I <br/>
should have).  <br/>
<br/>
Apparently &quot;they&quot; (whoever they is) have decided that there just <br/>
can&#39;t be any more recess time and still meet all the classroom <br/>
requirements.  So, as of today, school officals have started to cut <br/>
out recess in the local schools.  But, don&#39;t worry, mom and dad, <br/>
your kids will still have a 30 minute lunch break and two bathroom <br/>
breaks per day.  Wow, now I can sleep better at night, thanks.  :-P  <br/>
<br/>
There were also a couple of interviews with a mother and a father <br/>
who thinks that this might not be such a good idea.  Duh, you <br/>
think?  It&#39;s things like this that only reinforces (and confirms) my <br/>
decision to unschool my 2.5 year old daughter.<br/>

Oh, and I forgot to mention, this is less than two weeks after <br/>
someone (who had just found out that I plan on homeschooling, didn&#39;t <br/>
even bother to tell her that we are actually unschooling) was <br/>
telling me that I should reconsider because the schools here are <br/>
really good!  I should be surprised but, sadly, I&#39;m not.<br/>
