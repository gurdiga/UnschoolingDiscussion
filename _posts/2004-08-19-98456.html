<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984644932">**********Memorizing the states is bad enough. The school Cameron attended <br/>
required  <br/>
the seventh graders to memorize all the countries of AFRICA! <br/>

And the point is....?<br/>

I never understood this - especially since when I was forced to do it, everything changed in a couple year span.  You are forced to memorize Russia, then it becomes the USSR (or vice versa - don&#39;t remeber now!!)  Anyways...  I learned a lot about England, Ireland, Rome, the Middle East and upper Africa as a kid because I WANTED to learn - nothing anyone made me do, but all stuff I looked up and researched myself because of my interests in Biblical history, mythology, and territorial wars.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395160525">SO, what was the dumbest thing you think you had to learn in school? <br/>
For me, I think it was the whole how to diagram all of the parts of <br/>
speech in a sentence. I was really good at it, but I still don&#39;t know <br/>
what purpose it served to be able to put things on a weird little <br/>
line. LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506395930">Without a doubt it was FOIL factoring in Algebra.  I&#39;m pretty sure it was a math formula invented just to keep the students who didn&#39;t get traditional math busy.  As a side effect, it made us feel stupid, guaranteeing there would always be a need for teacher for slow math.<br/>
