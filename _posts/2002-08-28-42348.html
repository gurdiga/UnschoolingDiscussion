That&#39;s the problem with blanket rules that kids have no say about.<br/>
Your pacifist views are not theirs, unless of course you believe your views <br/>
have to be shared by your children. In which case you are going to try and <br/>
force your views on them without open dialogue about how other people feel.<br/>
Being a pacifist does not mean your children will be, nor is it fair to force <br/>
that on them imo.<br/>
Mary is a pacifist, so maybe she&#39;ll have more useful ideas than I will....but <br/>
I am very against parents forcing their views on children.<br/>
I think they are more likely to respect your views if they aren&#39;t forced <br/>
anyway.<br/>
And sword play is terribly fascinating, AND a fabulous learning opportunity <br/>
for your children.<br/>
We are in a medieval group and sword fighting, archery and fencing are the <br/>
norm.<br/>
My children have made swords, shields and costumes for that purpose...they <br/>
know a lot more about that time period than I ever did as a child. Even the <br/>
babsy boy loves battling with his older siblings.<br/>
So maybe I&#39;m not the best one to give advice here, I think sword play is <br/>
marvelous.<br/>
And my children are extremely compassionate human beings that think war is <br/>
awful and are very sensitive to meanness in the world.<br/>
I don&#39;t see how sword play is going to change that.<br/>

Thanks for responding, Ren -- I was afraid no one would get to the end of that very long post.  I guess I wasn&#39;t clear enough about the fact that I *don&#39;t* want to impose my views on them -- ten years old is old enough to be able to make decisions about which toys to play with.  I guess I was just wondering about easing up on swords and arrows, while still keeping a &quot;no guns&quot; rule, as I just cannot find any redemptive value in pretending to spray someone with bullets.<br/>

<br/>
After careful consideration, I came to the same conclusion, but I just can&#39;t seem to get over my distaste for toy guns.  Mary-the-pacifist, do you have any thoiughts on this?  Anyone else?<br/>
 Sword play and archery I have come to see the beauty in, especially for fantasy play, but I still don&#39;t want them aiming at each other.

 </span></blockquote>Marji-the-Pacifist here.  I had a great deal of trouble with toy guns and, <br/>
in fact, refused them a place in our home for years.  My husband kindly <br/>
went along with me, but when I recently lifted the no-guns rule, he <br/>
confessed that he believes our son to be a gentle, loving person who is <br/>
fascinated with violent play, as many boys are, and as he was as a kid.  It <br/>
is because I agree with my husband that I lifted that no-guns rule.  My son <br/>
knows the difference between playing and fighting, and I trust that he has <br/>
enough respect for others&#39; life and liberty that he would not use a gun to <br/>
interfere with those things.<br/>
<br/>
Preventing him from playing with guns only increased their attraction in <br/>
his eyes and fixates him on them.  When I stopped trying to prevent guns <br/>
from being in our home, his fascination evaporated!  We don&#39;t have an <br/>
arsenal, either, but he has guns, if he wants them.<br/>
<br/>
He loves to wrestle with his dad and they make all kinds of funny threats <br/>
to each other about how I won&#39;t be able to recognize either of them when <br/>
they&#39;re through with their match.  My son says to his dad, &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>
turn you into powder!&quot;  They have a terrific time.  Many times, the <br/>
wrestling matches end up in kisses and hugs (at least ours do!).  He still <br/>
won&#39;t step on an ant, but he&#39;ll blow you away just as soon as look at <br/>
you.  The thing is, it&#39;s FUN for him.  He has a sense of humor and this <br/>
fits in with it.<br/>
<br/>
Kids know when they come to our house, you can have fun and do pretty much <br/>
what you want.  There are minimal rules here.  The rules revolve around the <br/>
Golden Rule, and the safety issues I have around the swimming pool.  Also, <br/>
when kids are playing with guns and swords and such, they can only aim at <br/>
or involve another person who agrees to be in the game with them.  Clothing <br/>
is entirely optional.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids like to make swords out of sturdy cardboard. We cover them in foil. <br/>
We once tried balsa wood, but when it broke there were splinters. So even <br/>
though the cardboard isn&#39;t as strong as we would like it is safer. We make <br/>
shields the same way. I get those fake plastic jewels and rhinestones and we <br/>
glue them to our cardboard shield. I attach a piece of fabric rope or leather <br/>
to the back for a handle. We also have crowns, *gold* money (bought at the <br/>
party supply store) which we keep in one of those purple Crown Royal bags, <br/>
and jewels. We also made a jewel encrusted treasure box out of an old shoe <br/>
box, plastic jewels and different colors of foil. Right now Moly is painting <br/>
a piece of paper with brown watercolor. When she is finished, I will burn the <br/>
edges for her and she is going to crumple it up and then make it into a map. <br/>
We have also dyed paper with tea. I go to my local scrapbook store for unique <br/>
papers and foils for Moly. I also frequent Hobby Lobby and pick up things <br/>
there. We made eye patches out of black leather and punched holes for an <br/>
elastic cord. I buy tulle (especially the kind with sparkles) on sale and the <br/>
kids just wrap themselves in it, for when they are playing the *rich* queen <br/>
or a fairy. I found these long stems with curls at the top, dipped in <br/>
glitter, at Hobby Lobby. (I think they are used for floral arraignments?) <br/>
Anyway, we use those as fairy wands. I attach silk ribbons and little bells <br/>
to them. (To me, it looks more authentic than those plastic wands with <br/>
glittery stars on the top.) Moly says she likes it better because she knows a <br/>
fairy wouldn&#39;t use a plastic wand, she would find a curly stick, dip it in <br/>
fairy dust and put *prettys* on it. (right now, she is more interested in the <br/>
guy parts, and doesn&#39;t want to play the little princess or fairy though &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
We have ballet slippers, old leather boots, long skirts, and old pants. You <br/>
can tuck an old pair of pants, two or three sizes too big, into the tops of <br/>
boots and blouse the pants to make them look like pirates, then tie a rope <br/>
for a belt. Add a little (or big sister, or baby brother...) sister dressed <br/>
in ballet slippers or bare feet and lots of tulle, don&#39;t comb her hair and <br/>
send them out to play!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145467035">&lt;g!&gt; Thanks, Marji.  This is honestly the first time this has come up!  There was absolutely *no* interest in weapons of any kind before this point, so I naively believed we had successfully passed that issue.  I know when my dh first started wrestling matches with the kids, I was very uncomfortable because it seemed so violent, especially as that was the only way he was physical with our son (no cuddles or kisses; that&#39;s just not how he was raised).  However, as time went on and our daughters were born, he &quot;rassled them down to the ground&quot; as well, but started being more physically affectionate too, even with ds.  Now it&#39;s just a matter of course, and I have learned that the &quot;rough housing&quot; seems to serve a real need between the kids and their dad.  I hope that&#39;s how the sword play evolves, too.   Debi<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574535554">Thanks for the reassurance, Karin.  I just hated to see my peaceful, fun-loving kids turn into bloodthirsty warmongers &lt;g&gt;.  It&#39;s hard when you have a pre-conceived notion of cause and effect to shed that frame of reference, and instead remember who those kids really are, and trust in their sense of what is right and good.  As I said, this was never an issue until now, so I immediately had visions of children bleeding and bruised from improperly handled swords, and an increase in bickering and resorting to fists instead of words.  I guess though that if that was not who they were previously, a joust or two (or two hundred!) won&#39;t change that!  Thanks again.  Debi <br/>
   Even though they do fight (as brothers do), they have never used their<br/>
  weapons in a real fighting situation to hurt each other. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 boys who are now 9 & 11. When they were toddlers, I felt really<br/>
strongly about no guns or weapons as toys. I wanted to protect them from all<br/>
&quot;that&quot;, and didn&#39;t feel comfortable with even play weapons of any kind. They<br/>
were so young and innocent, I really wanted to keep them like that and<br/>
thought that I could.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how or why, but even though they didn&#39;t have any weapons in the<br/>
house, my young boys did play-fighting anyway with their own pretend weapons<br/>
quite often. They were always picking up sticks outside and delighted in<br/>
finding ones remotely shaped liked guns and &quot;shooting&quot; each other. They made<br/>
their tinkertoys and other supposedly non-violent toys in the house into<br/>
weapons like guns and swords. The final straw came when my boys were around<br/>
3 & 5 and their grandfather (my FIL) took them on an outing to a local<br/>
western-theme town (Rawhide in Scottsdale, AZ) and as a surprise for the<br/>
day, he bought them cowboy gear complete with cowboy hats, boots, holsters<br/>
and toy GUNS. That was their first &quot;real&quot; toy weapon and darned if they<br/>
didn&#39;t look so cute dressed in their little costumes and grandpa looked so<br/>
proud. I just couldn&#39;t get mad and I decided they could keep their costumes<br/>
and toy guns.<br/>
<br/>
Since then my boys have acquired a whole array of toy weapons for imaginary<br/>
play. Everything from guns to swords to lightsabers, bows and arrows, all of<br/>
that. Even though they do fight (as brothers do), they have never used their<br/>
weapons in a real fighting situation to hurt each other. They have made<br/>
several of their own swords out of a piece of wood, cut with a wood saw.<br/>
They have made several homemade bows and arrows when they get in the mood<br/>
for that. They really enjoy imaginary play fighting.<br/>
<br/>
I have just learned to loosen up alot on my feelings about weapons. I found<br/>
that my boys made their own weapons when we didn&#39;t have any, so what was the<br/>
point of enforcing a no-weaopns rule? My boys are also very compassionate<br/>
people who are very sensitive to real-life death or killing or war<br/>
situations. Right now my youngest is very worried when he learned that all<br/>
boys who turn 18 (I think?) have to sign up for the selective service system<br/>
and possibly be called to fight in a war. Frankly, I&#39;m a little worried for<br/>
him, too, but I don&#39;t dwell on that and I told him he shouldn&#39;t either.<br/>

  Every year in Holly, MI we have a Renaissance Festival that we go to.  They <br/>
  have sword fighting and swallowing, jousting and all kinds of medieval <br/>
  things.  It&#39;s a great thing to experience if you have something like that in <br/>
  your area.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  You said your kids made swords and shields -- how did they do that?  Debi <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really did read your whole post, promise. I just snipped from part of it <br/>
not the end.<br/>
We made ours according to local SCA practice regulations. Out of pvc pipe (or <br/>
maybe it was abc, matters not), pipe insulation and duct tape.<br/>
You have the child (or anyone) stand straight with their hand at their side. <br/>
Make your hand flat, your fingers all point forward...that is the correct <br/>
height for the &quot;sword&quot;.<br/>
You can cut 1/2&quot; pvc pipe to the correct height for that person (it&#39;s very <br/>
easy to saw through with a hand saw or any electric one). Take the 1/2&quot; pipe <br/>
insulation and wrap the &quot;blade&quot; part down to where you want the handle. Take <br/>
a small piece of pipe insulation (about 6 inches or so) for a cross piece <br/>
above the handle if they want it.<br/>
Take black duct tape and wrap the entire piece until it is fairly solid and <br/>
smooth.<br/>
You can use some colored electric tape to make a cutting edge. That isn&#39;t <br/>
necessary for home play though.<br/>
I just want to offer you some thought on the guns issue. I love shooting <br/>
guns, haven&#39;t done it much but find it very enjoyable. I am fascinated by <br/>
weaponry of all ages, not because I like the intent, believe me. But weapons <br/>
were not only about protecting oneself, but about survival. It&#39;s interesting.<br/>
I happen to eat a mostly vegetarian diet and am a very peaceful person. We <br/>
don&#39;t own guns, other than bebe guns, but I still like shooting.<br/>
So whether or not your kids want to shoot guns or any other weapon should be <br/>
up to them in my opinion.<br/>
Under the safety and guidance of an interested parent, this could be a <br/>
wonderful learning opportunity.<br/>
Your kids may grow up to be hunters. Is that really so bad? Interest in self <br/>
sufficiency and survival skills should be encouraged in my mind.<br/>
But it involves weaponry and often guns.<br/>
I&#39;m glad you are taking the time to question your beliefs on this and ponder <br/>
the facts, not just have a knee jerk reaction to their fascination.<br/>
If you&#39;re interested in the homemade shield information, let me know. They <br/>
look really cool!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m coming late to this conversation but I think all the advice given so far <br/>
has been about what I would have said. I don&#39;t like guns and weapons. My son <br/>
does. He&#39;s also gentle and sweet and can&#39;t hurt a fly. Literally. Rather <br/>
than ban something he was so interested in, I helped him and talked with him <br/>
and played with him. Sometimes we even had duels. I think all his weapons <br/>
play fufills a need he has to act out certain aggressions and emotions. It&#39;s <br/>
also led to lots of interesting learning.<br/>
