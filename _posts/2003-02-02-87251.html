<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I got my PhD with 3 kids. For a long time I joked that I had more children <br/>
&gt; than chapters, but that changed.  I actually hand-wrote much of my <br/>
&gt; dissertation because I worked in the playroom with my kids. I also worked <br/>
&gt; at night and in the wee-wee hours.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t found my education background particularly detrimental to <br/>
&gt; unschooling, but I was not an ed. major. I was an English major; I taught <br/>
&gt; at Penn State for 6 years before we moved away. Part of my dissertation <br/>
&gt; deals with the early stages of what became liberal, public education and <br/>
&gt; the beginnings of women&#39;s education. This has actually helped me to see <br/>
&gt; education as just a bunch of theories laid out by guys like Jean-Jacques <br/>
&gt; Rousseau who really didn&#39;t have a whole lot to recommend them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I don&#39;t use my education in homeschooling, I think it did give me a <br/>
&gt; certain amount of confidence in myself. I think I&#39;m far more capable than <br/>
&gt; anyone else of deciding what&#39;s best for my children--hubris that may or may <br/>
&gt; not have been there otherwise. I taught lots of education majors, and they <br/>
&gt; were, as a group, some of the worst students I had. Unable to write <br/>
&gt; coherent thoughts or punctuate and dead set against anything that resembled <br/>
&gt; critical inquiry. That&#39;s what really made me begin to look into <br/>
&gt; homeschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I got mine pre-family while working fulltime in public school <br/>
administration. That was easy, compared to what I imagine a dissertation would demand while <br/>
unschooling with children. (Took the kids to see &quot;Cheaper By the Dozen&quot; <br/>
yesterday btw &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
    After years of family life and happy unschooling, I didn&#39;t bother with <br/>
the coursework to keep up my certification, and it&#39;s just as well. <br/>
<br/>
       But imo educators weren&#39;t idiots as a group or individually, not then <br/>
and not now. Most my colleagues earned my respect, and I had disdain for only <br/>
a few, based on who the individual was, not what group or label I assigned <br/>
them to. Same with the parents and community leaders we worked with -- respect <br/>
for most, disdain for a few. I was further educated and enormously enriched  by <br/>
many of them. <br/>
<br/>
       And I could work with them all, expert or not, even the raging <br/>
egomaniacs and the truly idiotic. Even some who couldn&#39;t spell and punctuate. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       These parallel discussions about degrees and credentials and parents <br/>
put me in mind of the old NHEN Legislative list, and a thread called &quot;Experts, <br/>
Ruffians and Being Foolish&quot; in Sept 2002.<br/>
<br/>
Message #18,062<br/>
<br/>
       . . .a major<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; premise of homeschoolers is that you don&#39;t need credentialed experts to<br/>
&gt; effectively share knowledge or skills. We &quot;just moms/dads&quot; are literally<br/>
&gt; walking our talk. Any person or organization that isn&#39;t willing to avail<br/>
&gt; itself of the expertise of &quot;just moms/dads&quot; is, IMO, foolish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       Yes! Any person or organization unwilling to avail itself of input or<br/>
expertise of any kind is indeed foolish. Isn&#39;t that what learning is all<br/>
about?<br/>
<br/>
       But I do feel the need to point out that this includes actual<br/>
credentialed experts, too, with whom homeschoolers seem to have something of<br/>
a love-hate relationship.<br/>
<br/>
       We beat the stuffing out of most experts just because they are<br/>
experts, but then exalt to expert status uncredentialed experts with whom we<br/>
do agree. We then use these self-created experts to beat the stuffing out of<br/>
each other! Or we pronounce ourselves certainly not experts but knowledgeable<br/>
based on our &quot;experience&quot; -- no doubt the root of the word expert in the<br/>
first place -- without ever facing the fact that we do this as a preface to<br/>
imparting our &quot;expertise!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       We brag about our own lack of credentials (or downplay the ones we do<br/>
have) in the same breath we brag about our children earning those same<br/>
credentials! We ask each other for help but then push each other away if the<br/>
help seems too &quot;professional.&quot; We are deeply suspicious of any expertise that<br/>
earns money for the ones offering it. Et cetera.<br/>
<br/>
       In fact, having just read this, I&#39;ll bet most hsers would now argue<br/>
with the statement that began it. It is one of the Great Paradoxes of<br/>
Homeschooling. :)  JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075060104">Just remembered this -- while expecting our first child, I was an <br/>
instructional muckety-muck in Florida&#39;s department of education, traveling, <br/>
analyzing legislation, writing curriculum, supposedly supervising more than 200 <br/>
staff. As the pregnancy progressed, I was deemed to have gestational diabetes and <br/>
preeclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure.) I asked my obstetrician if <br/>
he&#39;d recommend I stay home from my very stressful and demanding job until after <br/>
delivery. <br/>
<br/>
       He considered, and then said the only expectant moms he&#39;d ever <br/>
prescribed bedrest for or needed to hospitalize had bigger demands on them than I <br/>
did, in other words the ones at home with a toddler or two. But my big important <br/>
job -- no problem! Didn&#39;t I get to sit down much of the time?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493177264">I&#39;d be surprised if anyone here thought having a Master&#39;s degree or any <br/>
kind of degree in education would HELP in homeschooling, but getting a <br/>
degree does not preclude a mother&#39;s presence in her child&#39;s life. I made <br/>
sure that I finished my own course work giving birth, and I took my <br/>
comprehensive exams while 7 mos. pregnant. After that, I had my teaching, <br/>
tutoring and my dissertation to write.<br/>
<br/>
The only time Emily wasn&#39;t with me as an infant was when I was teaching or <br/>
tutoring (and college courses meet for only an hour, 3 times a week), and <br/>
then she was with her father. I nursed her exclusively, and she didn&#39;t take <br/>
bottles of even pumped milk. She loved going to the library with me--she <br/>
took in absolutely everything! I think she loved all the different colors <br/>
on the book spines. Everyone loved seeing her and made a big deal over her. <br/>
She even met a couple of Nobel Laureates, who were far more taken with her <br/>
than in looking at one more science lab. Carried babies are infinitely mobile!<br/>
<br/>
I did much of my work with my children, while they were playing. They have <br/>
wonderful imaginations and often occupy themselves for long periods of <br/>
time. I sat in my chair, surrounded by books and papers, while they played <br/>
around me. I was there to tie on barbie shoes,  skirts and tap shoes, <br/>
whatever they needed. When they were done, I was done. I didn&#39;t work all <br/>
day or every day. I often worked at night. I learned to work with <br/>
interruptions, in bits and snatches. I was glad when I was done, but I also <br/>
enjoyed what I did and hope to turn my dissertation into a book. My hope is <br/>
to turn out a book that is interesting to more than just a handful of <br/>
academics.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling does demand a tremendous amount of time from the primary <br/>
parent, but I don&#39;t think it precludes that parent from working.  What my <br/>
kids see is someone reading, researching, writing, pursuing a passion, <br/>
asking interesting questions, digging deeper, critically examining, <br/>
genuinely questioning. These are really good things for my kids to see. It <br/>
would be bad if I did this work from 9 to 5 or allowed it to take <br/>
precedence over their needs and time. But that&#39;s not how I work.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm... maybe there&#39;s such a thing as un-working?<br/>

I think it was an argument against using hypothetical situations and <br/>
hyperbole.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the mother of an unborn/newborn needs to be studying education to <br/>
learn how to be a better mother isn&#39;t hypothetical.  Whether newborns need their <br/>

The discussion was not around the woman. Nobody knows who she is. We do <br/>
know about her decision. It could have been anybody&#39;s decision. It is <br/>
right on topic for it is the kind of thing that is brought to not only <br/>
homeschoolers but unschoolers over and over again. That you cannot do <br/>
things until you go to school and are taught how to do them. <br/>
Unschooling is not a teaching technique, it is not a homeschooling <br/>
technique. It is a way of life for the whole family. You&#39;re all in it <br/>
or you&#39;re not. I think it was very appropriate to comment on that <br/>
choice.<br/>

Maybe the mother felt the need for education for HERSELF.  Sometimes that <br/>
happens.  Mothers still want to learn, still feel the need to absorb and be a <br/>
person.  Sometimes they can do both, be a good mother AND go to college.  Is the <br/>
degree worthless because she might never actually teach in a classroom?  <br/>
Probably not to the mother.<br/>
<br/>
I have a degree in nursing.  I don&#39;t work, haven&#39;t in several years.  I went <br/>
to college when I had two children.  Sometimes on short days one or both went <br/>
with me and sat quietly coloring.  If they needed me, I was there for them, it <br/>
wasn&#39;t a choice.  BUT I did get an education, for ME and to be able to <br/>
support my children IF something were to occur in my marriage, death, divorce, <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Some people might find it a waste.  I worked very HARD to get done as quickly <br/>
as possible.  Sometimes taking up to 23 credit hours, very early classes and <br/>
late night classes and studying ONLY after the children were in bed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very glad I didn&#39;t have to study as much as I see my kids doing, that <br/>
would have been hard for me.<br/>
<br/>
Remembering that I got married at 17, had my first child at 19, so it was a <br/>
little different than for a lot of people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I have an education.  I&#39;m glad that I have knowledge that is often <br/>
useful and if I HAD to go to work and earn money I could.  For most of my <br/>
children&#39;s lives I have been lucky enough to be home with them.  Some parents don&#39;t <br/>
have that luxury, I&#39;m grateful for it.<br/>

<br/>
What that mother will learn if she goes to school to study what she could use <br/>
to be a good unschooler (or homeschooler, whichever was the original scenario <br/>
quoted from whichever other list) is that babies need very much to be with <br/>
their mothers.<br/>
<br/>
But by the time she learns that, going to school while her infant is <br/>
elsewhere, it will be too late.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes they can do both, be a good mother AND go to college.  Is the <br/>
degree worthless because she might never actually teach in a classroom?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If her priority is her own college education, great!  It&#39;s doable.  But it&#39;s <br/>
not a good path to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Someone can go to college with a baby.  Someone can be a dedicated attachment <br/>
parenting mom.  But it&#39;s nigh on impossible to do both.  One takes precedent.<br/>
<br/>
People have all kinds of priorities.  Some people highly value their sex <br/>
life, or their drinking, or their clothes (just read an article in that Utne <br/>
Reader about someone who&#39;s written a book on having a more ecologically-justifiable <br/>
wardrobe, but she bought a tube top that cost over $100--weirdly out of my <br/>
experience altogether), or their cars or their jewelry or music or quilting or <br/>
wildlife rescue or vegetarian cooking or fundraising or religion or political <br/>
activism.<br/>
<br/>
Some people&#39;s priority is their kids, and becoming unschoolers.<br/>
Those are the only people we can really help here.<br/>
<br/>
Other priorities might inhibit or interfere with unschooling.  Some won&#39;t.  <br/>
Going to college to get a master&#39;s in education in order to stay home with <br/>
one&#39;s children is an inhibiting interference.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing they teach in education classes that isn&#39;t available in <br/>
those textbooks and journals.  One could probably learn more reading what&#39;s online <br/>
than buying textbooks and having people dole out information to them two or <br/>
three times a week while they sit in desks.<br/>
<br/>
Those who wonder whether I just wrote is true must be having a HELL of a hard <br/>
time unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732985849">&lt;&lt;Maybe the mother felt the need for education for HERSELF.  Sometimes that <br/>
happens.  Mothers still want to learn, still feel the need to absorb and be<br/>
a <br/>
person.  Sometimes they can do both, be a good mother AND go to college.  Is<br/>
the <br/>
degree worthless because she might never actually teach in a classroom?  <br/>
Probably not to the mother.&gt;&gt;<br/>

I just searched my folder to find the original post - but it is lost<br/>
somewhere in the quagmire so I can&#39;t quote. However the memory I have of the<br/>
post is, simplistically paraphrased: &quot;I want to homeschool my child *so* I<br/>
went out and got a degree in Education&quot;. She wants to keep to the theme of<br/>
hs&#39;ing for her final dissertation. Maybe my recollection is faulty. <br/>
<br/>
I do remember feeling a strong need for education in my mid twenties. I felt<br/>
I needed more skills if I wanted to advance as a set/costume designer. So I<br/>
went to Technical College specifically for that. First I studied some<br/>
Architectural Drafting (in the olden days before CAD)at one place; then I<br/>
did some Fashion Illustration and also Pattern Drafting at two others - just<br/>
enough for practical purposes. Finally after working for a while, both in<br/>
and out of the theater, I returned to University and actually attained a<br/>
degree in Theatre Design, discovering both Lighting Design (which I truly<br/>
adore) and Film. The feeling of going to college for my own genuine purposes<br/>
and really loving it, was so immensely different from going when I first<br/>
finished High School, and enrolling in an unfinished Bachelor of Science,<br/>
because I felt so pressured by everyone as top of the class to &quot;do something<br/>
with my brain&quot;, when all I really wanted was Show Business. (I should add<br/>
everyone except my mother, ironically, who much preferred that I go into the<br/>
&quot;family business&quot;- musical theater.) Now I am very excited to be writing<br/>
feature film scripts. <br/>
<br/>
Could I have done all this with a baby? Not with the full immersion in<br/>
either baby caring that I did when Jayn was born, or in the degree studies<br/>
and extracurricular stuff. Film work is usually at least 12hour days also.<br/>
Some things are more compatible with having children than others, some<br/>
education options are more compatible with attachment parenting (including<br/>
part time studies or internet college); some careers are more compatible<br/>
with unschooling than others - for me that is working from home as a script<br/>
writer instead of a production designer. <br/>
<br/>
All I know is we rarely (actually only ever one occasion a few months ago)<br/>
leave Jayn with other people, so she is with either me or James 24 hours per<br/>
day. We like it this way. If I wanted to further my formal education, or<br/>
enhance my degree qualifications (don&#39;t have a reason to right now) it would<br/>
mean a lot of work from James. I would be looking for alternate self study<br/>
methods. I wish my career had been so fabulous that I missed working. Most<br/>
of the movies were pretty crummy, and not wonderful working experiences<br/>
either. The high point: I met my husband on the first movie I worked on when<br/>
I arrived in Los Angeles.<br/>

Unschooling, to me, is grad school without the gate keepers or the hoops. <br/>
What could be better than that? Read a lot, find your passion, pursue it as <br/>

interested me, dropped the ones I ended up not liking. Then again, I wasn&#39;t <br/>
at all interested in a degree at that point. In fact, when I did settle on <br/>
a major and started working towards a degree, the unschooling aspect went <br/>
out of it and I quit. I had been learning way more when I was doing it my way.<br/>

Despite playing many &#39;bad guys&#39; he always seemed so charming in interviews<br/>
and the like.<br/>
<br/>
I went to take a quick look at his Internet Movie Database entry and had<br/>
forgotten how many roles of his I knew.  They just don&#39;t make them like that<br/>
anymore.  Harrison Ford is the closest we have these days.<br/>

may chose to go to a &quot;formal&quot; program because of the green card effect.<br/>
When it&#39;s over you are employable.  You may chose a formal program because<br/>
of the people teaching--they may be inspiring or interesting.<br/>
<br/>
There are many reasons to persue formal, academic education.  For me the<br/>
unschooling aspect is making an informed decision to take that route rather<br/>
than others because of what you really get, rather than because you think<br/>
another ways isn&#39;t &quot;enough.&quot;<br/>

This is such a dilemma for me.  I have thought it would be interesting to try <br/>
going to college, since I never did.  Each time I have tried I have been <br/>
majorly turned off by the &quot;rules&quot;.  Just going through the admission process was <br/>
daunting and frustrating, and this was before I was an unschooler!  One time I <br/>
applied for a job at the University of Memphis.  It required fast typing, <br/>
which I do well, for doing word processing on a computer.  But they made me take <br/>
the typing test on an ancient Selectric.  I don&#39;t have to explain this idiocy <br/>
to this group, do I?  Anyway, that&#39;s the kind of frustration I had with the <br/>
admissions process the couple of times I attempted.  <br/>
<br/>
I am much more savvy about college now, having helped my son get his <br/>
scholarships, etc., but I wonder if it would even be worth my time.  The unschooling <br/>
life is so ingrained, it would probably be torture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120287833">Life is good. And a great teacher. And sometimes we can learn something in a <br/>
more structured setting -- and choose to learn that way. Must we all learn <br/>
only one way for it to be unschoolish? To me the important unschooling step is <br/>
the choosing. Closing off options doesn&#39;t seem unschoolish to me -- it seems <br/>
dogmatic. More of both as desired -- that&#39;s what I hope my kids understand. Life <br/>

This is such a dilemma for me.  I have thought it would be interesting to try <br/>
going to college, since I never did. ... but I wonder if it would even be worth my time.  The unschooling life is so ingrained, it would probably be torture.<br/>

I certainly don&#39;t think anyone needs to go to college and definitely not in order to unschool.  But if you wanted to go, you&#39;d probably like classes at a small, liberal arts college better than a university.  I attended a miniscule women&#39;s college (around 100 or so in my graduating class) and most of my classes (other than a few freshmen lecture classes) were conversations with knowledgeable people about interesting things --  but I majored and minored in things that I was fascinated by (psychology, English, mathematics).   I think a smaller place, or the honors college of a larger place, would less &quot;rule-bound&quot; than a university.  I went to college caring too much about grades and so had less of a good time than I should have -- but by-and-large it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
The most fun I have ever had in academics was my last year of lawschool.  I already had a job for after graduation with the firm I had interned with the previous summer, so for the first time in my life I felt that grades were completely irrelevant.  I had a blast.  It made me think of how much better all my education would have been, had I had that attitude from the beginning.  <br/>
<br/>
The thing I liked best about college and lawschool, though -- a ready source of people willing to talk endlessly about things I was interested in -- you can now get right at home on the internet!  I don&#39;t have to take a class to find people to discuss the ins-and-outs of the characters of Angela Thirkell  -- there is a list right on yahoo.<br/>

That would be lovely, but I&#39;m about to move to NW Arkansas.  I&#39;m not sure <br/>
such a thing would exist there.  There are private colleges, but most of them are <br/>
Christian and I&#39;m not.  I&#39;ve thought about if I could do that when my last <br/>
child is grown (10 years to go), maybe relocate temporarily to where I wanted to <br/>
go to school.  But I am sure I will be doing so many other things it would be <br/>
hard to break away.  There are some schools, like the one advertised in HEM, <br/>
which only require you to be there 3 weeks per semester, and the rest is done <br/>
on your own.  But I&#39;m not sure they would take someone like me, and I&#39;m not <br/>
sure that would provide the &quot;learning community&quot; that you and others have told <br/>
me about.  I&#39;d have to hunt it up in my location for sure.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now I can only formulate the plan and think about it.  Executing it <br/>
will come much later.  But if I talk about it now I will have more information <br/>
for when I can execute it.  That will be much later.  Maybe after all that time, <br/>
I won&#39;t even feel the need for a degree!<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;For most of my children&#39;s lives I have been lucky enough to be <br/>
home with them.  Some parents don&#39;t have that luxury, I&#39;m grateful <br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
glena&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a litle late getting in on this discussion.  I just now went <br/>
back and read all the talk on degrees and unschooling.  I find the <br/>
discussion very interesting however, I did read this sentence and <br/>
was compelled to put my .02 in about how &quot;lucky&quot; some of us are to <br/>
be able to stay home with their kids.<br/>
<br/>
Luck has nothing to do with my being able to stay home with my <br/>
daughter.  My husband and I planned from the time we talked about <br/>
getting married and having a family right away that one of us would <br/>
stay home with her (preferably me but, there have been times when it <br/>
was him).  Then, we sat down and talked about what we needed to do <br/>
to make that happen(ie, what bills do we need to pay off so that we <br/>
can lower out debts and live on one income).  Next, we both worked <br/>
two jobs so that we could pay off our credit cards and our cars and <br/>
then put some money in savings as a small cushion &quot;just in case.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Living on one income has nothing to do with luck, it has to do with <br/>
planning (in our case, a lot of it) and being willing to put your <br/>
kids before all the wonderful new &quot;stuff&quot; you might like to have.  I <br/>
know lots of people (mostly friends of friends) who always say how <br/>
lucky I am to be able to stay home and how much they would enjoy <br/>
being able to do that.  The next thing I know they go out and buy a <br/>
much bigger much more expensive home and two brand new cars!  No <br/>
wonder she can&#39;t stay home.....she would rather have the new SUV (I <br/>
LOVE my SUV but, it&#39;s certainly not new) and the big house.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course (since I have such a hard time keeping my mouth shut) I <br/>
pointed out the contradiction in what she was saying and what she <br/>
was doing.  When I told her that, if she and her husband would quit <br/>
going out to dinner (and breakfast and lunch) everyday, stayed in <br/>
the smaller house, and hadn&#39;t bought two brand new cars, she would <br/>
be able to stay home with her son, she wasn&#39;t too happy with me <br/>
but....oh well.  <br/>
<br/>
I am just so sick of having people tell me how lucky I am to stay <br/>
home and then go out and spend thousands on &quot;things&quot; that they don&#39;t <br/>
need.  All the while complaining about how they both have to work!  <br/>
Grrrrr<br/>
<br/>
Melissa<br/>
<br/>
PS. I do realize that there are some couples where both have to work <br/>
outside the home.  However, I also think that, in most cases (and I <br/>
know there are always exceptions to the rule), if they had planned a <br/>
bit better, both would not have to work outside the home.</div>

most what&#39;s wrong with our education and economic systems results form this <br/>
mistaken belief that individuals just don&#39;t plan well enough or work hard <br/>
enough.  JJ<br/>

&lt;&lt; Must we all learn <br/>
only one way for it to be unschoolish? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One way&quot;??<br/>
<br/>
That seems to be dividing life into &quot;the school-style way&quot; and &quot;the <br/>
not-school-style way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;To me the important unschooling step is <br/>
the choosing. Closing off options doesn&#39;t seem unschoolish to me -- it seems <br/>
dogmatic. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you defending classroom teaching being as legitimate a natural learning <br/>
tool as learning outside a classroom?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not clear if you&#39;re thinking about adults or children either.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;More of both as desired -- that&#39;s what I hope my kids understand. Life <br/>
as a banquet! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been to a banquet where people told you what to eat in what order, <br/>
stretched it out over 18 weeks, and tested you at the end.<br/>
