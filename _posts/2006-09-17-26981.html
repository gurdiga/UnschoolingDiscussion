<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018294132">I found this tonight during a bout of insomnia. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

School Rules<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They&quot; tell you to behave: to follow the rules, to do what they say, to <br/>
be quiet and polite and kind. Don&#39;t listen to them. It&#39;s a scam.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s school, right? What better place is there to experiment? School, <br/>
while not exactly a playground, is supposed to be a safe place. It&#39;s <br/>
somewhere that the consequences are small, but are there. Just enough <br/>
to deter you, but not enough to hurt.<br/>
<br/>
None of this was in my head as I hid out in the bathroom. These <br/>
thoughts and justifications dind&#39;t come to mind as I slithered down the <br/>
hallway. It wasn&#39;t there to console me as I was caught and dragged back <br/>
down the hallway, onto the bus. The neurons didn&#39;t fire as I sat, in <br/>
tears, through a bitter interrogation and reprimand by the principal. I <br/>
never realized them as I scrubbed the desks and shelves during my <br/>
Saturday detention. In fact, they didn&#39;t hit me with full force until <br/>
several days ago -- a full year or so after the event took place.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, other kids asked me what it was that made me do it. <br/>
It seemed so silly, so pointless. I wasn&#39;t the kind of kid that did <br/>
these things, they said. I always apologized, or mumbled, or tried to <br/>
change the subject. The truth was I really didn&#39;t know what kind of kid <br/>
I was.<br/>
<br/>
Now, however, I have an answer for them. It was part of my education -- <br/>
a more important part that Science or History could ever be. They were <br/>
events that did more to flesh me out as a person, and build my <br/>
character than all the boring lectures put together. And that&#39;s the way <br/>
it should be.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the kind of thing that the big folks don&#39;t understand, or at <br/>
least they often pretend not to. They deliver their harsh words with <br/>
all the anger they can muster, and perhaps, they truly are angry. But <br/>
some part of me can&#39;t help but wonder if deep inside they really <br/>
understand. Somehow perhaps, they know that it&#39;s a test. A test meant <br/>
to crush the self-confidence of children, and, in doing so, have it <br/>
grow back even stronger.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s true, I want to tell them that there are easier ways. Ones <br/>
that work not through hatred and pain, but through love. Ways that <br/>
bring out the inner strength of those who are weak, and cultivate it in <br/>
those that are stronger. Ways that teach all of us -- both the <br/>
oppressor and the opressed -- that we&#39;re in this fight together. <br/>
Instead of fighting each other, and sowing hatred that will last <br/>
throughout our lives, why don&#39;t we work together to solve the problem, <br/>
and share the love that we all want and need.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like such a better solution. I&#39;m a human, not some lab rat <br/>
that needs to be rewarded and punished. I have reasons for what I do, <br/>
you have reasons for what you want. Things between us can&#39;t be so <br/>
different that we can&#39;t work them out eventually. You&#39;re probably <br/>
thinking that this isn&#39;t just a good lesson for school, but a good <br/>
lesson for life. And you&#39;d be right. And if it&#39;s such a good lesson, <br/>
how come we don&#39;t teach it through our actions? That&#39;s the way it seems <br/>
to me at least. But I&#39;m not the one who makes the rules.<br/>
