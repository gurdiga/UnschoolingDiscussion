<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197686799">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m a mom of three and we&#39;re in our third year of freedom from school.<br/>
<br/>
The homeschooling groups in our area are christian groups and, with our being athiests, not a good fit for us. ;-) Were it not for the internet, I&#39;d think we were the only unschoolers. Ever. Anywhere. In the whole entire history of the world. (Am I sounding desperate yet?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m thrilled to find this list and looking forward to discussion with people who don&#39;t think I&#39;m weird (at least not weird for homeschooling--I should probably just admit right now to weirdness in general.)<br/>
<br/>
I can talk-up unschooling pretty well, but when it comes right down to it, I am a product of schooling and grades and regulation etc etc and occassionally find myself wondering, &quot;Is this good enough?&quot; I&#39;m hoping that discussion/debate on a list will help me reinforce (redefine when necessary) my thoughts on learning. <br/>
<br/>
On to my question---Is anyone familiar with &quot;Life Learning Magazine?&quot; It looks interesting, but as it&#39;s not cheap, I&#39;d like to get some feedback before subscribing. Opinions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Joan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101209451">I&#39;ve been reading Life Learning now for about 6 months,  I really like it,  to me it fits with our life,  we are unschoolers.     It has had some really nice thoughtful articles.   <br/>

It&#39;s nice.  But if you don&#39;t already subscribe, I think Home Education <br/>
Magazine is fatter and has ME!  (Oh.  I was going to give other reasons, but <br/>
those are two good ones. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I get both.<br/>
<br/>
When was first unschooling I got Growing Without Schooling, which I loved a <br/>
lot.  You can still get back issues.  There&#39;s a link to where if you go to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a> <br/>
and click on John Holt, I think.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t already read www.unschooling.com that&#39;s a lot of (LOT OF) <br/>
reading you could do for encouragement and entertainment (and thrills and <br/>
fright, some of it).<br/>

(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>) On this list unschooling is a<br/>
given so it actually doesn&#39;t get talked about that much! It has many of the<br/>
same people who are on this list but a whole lot more newbies so they ask<br/>
lots of questions :-)<br/>
