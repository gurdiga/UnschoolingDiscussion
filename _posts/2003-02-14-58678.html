<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514948974">My son has really long, fine blonde hair.  He didn&#39;t want it cut and for <br/>
the longest time, he didn&#39;t want it brushed, not by himself, and certainly <br/>
not by anyone else.  (He was hyper-sensitive about how it feels.)  So, we <br/>
went out in public with the &#39;rats nests&#39; and usually nobody looked <br/>
twice!  (although he was usually in knee-high boots, sweats and <br/>
baggy-to-his-knees T-shirts he&#39;d inherited from his 6&#39;5&quot; uncles, so maybe <br/>
there was just too much &#39;funk&#39;  for folks to take in all at once...)<br/>
<br/>
When I cared how his hair looked, I&#39;d ask him if he would wear a hat.  He <br/>
likes his hats.  He has all sorts of hats from a huge foam cowboy hat to a <br/>
thick, furry mountain-man hat, to funky ski hats (with lots of bits and <br/>
dangles on them) to fuzzy, tall, cat-in-the-hat -type hats.  With a hat on, <br/>
nobody noticed the rats nests because they were hidden or folks were too <br/>
busy thinking, &quot;funky hat&quot; to notice.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could offer to get your hair-sensitive kids some fun <br/>
hats?  (Amusement parks are great places to get fun hats.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re pretty much past those concerns now as he&#39;s hit puberty and had <br/>
decided to shower every night (with conditioner.)  No more rats <br/>
nests!  Hooray!  ...although I miss the hats sometimes.<br/>
Hmmm.... maybe he&#39;d wear one for a while if I asked him to...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not a woman from the 1800&#39;s &lt;g&gt; but I braid my long hair at <br/>
night.  I have naturally curly hair and it *cannot* be brushed when <br/>
it&#39;s dry or 1.it would hurt immensely and 2.all the curl would come <br/>
out and it would be an Afro.  <br/>
<br/>
When I wash my hair I put conditioner in and use a wide-toothed <br/>
plastic brush to work the conditioner through (I&#39;ve read in magazines <br/>
to never brush wet hair -- they&#39;re absolutely wrong.  It&#39;s the *only* <br/>
time I can use a brush).  <br/>
<br/>
I start at the bottom, brushing out the tangles and work my way up <br/>
(if I started at the top and worked down I&#39;d rip out patches of <br/>
hair).  Then I rinse, put just a dab more conditioner in, and brush <br/>
it again. I immediately braid it and it stays that way until it&#39;s <br/>
dry.  <br/>
<br/>
When I unbraid it, I shake my head to make it look cohesive (instead <br/>
of three lumps).  Before bed, I braid it again because sleeping on <br/>
it &quot;loose&quot; would look disastrous and the only thing to do when it&#39;s <br/>
tangled is wash it, which isn&#39;t good for dry curly hair on a daily <br/>
basis.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps someone (though I don&#39;t know what to say to someone <br/>
dealing with fine, thin hair ... except ignore the parts about <br/>
gooping conditioner in it!).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is the issue for a LOT of things that have to do with <br/>
struggles between parents and kids.  How much you clean the house, <br/>
whether or not you let your 3 year old wear what he really wants to <br/>
wear, even if it&#39;s pajamas, whether or not you think 20 minutes of <br/>
tears to get your daughter&#39;s hair looking &quot;good&quot; is worth it, whether <br/>
or not you make your 7 year old sit and do phonics.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a challenge to get myself to the point where I can say, &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
care what others think&quot;.  And just when I&#39;m at the brink of getting <br/>
there, two other things come to mind. 1. Other parents might not want <br/>
their kids playing here if the house is a mess 2. Someone might call <br/>
children and youth.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who had children and youth called on her.  She was <br/>
given the ultimatim, &quot;Get your house cleaned up by tomorrow or we <br/>
will find a temporary home for the children&quot;.  A friend and I did <br/>
come over and get it to the point where it did pass their scrutiny <br/>
(she had just gotten off of complete bed rest due to a difficult <br/>
pregnancy when she got the knock on the door).  However, this was <br/>
months ago and she still has them popping in for surprise visits to <br/>
check the cleanliness of her house.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone worry about social services being called on them because <br/>
of how their kids dress, how their house looks, or even just the fact <br/>
that their child isn&#39;t reading?  Does the fact that unschoolers <br/>
are &quot;different&quot; and often more relaxed about housework make us an <br/>
easy target for those anonymous calls? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128546157">In this state, from what I have read in the papers, a dirty house isn&#39;t<br/>
reason enough to have social services pay you a call.  I read about a case<br/>
where a mother had called social services on  her own daughter because she<br/>
felt her daughter&#39;s house was unsafe for her grandkids because it was so<br/>
filthy.  From what the mother said, she wanted social services to teach the<br/>
daughter how to keep her house neater and safer.  Social services would help<br/>
her out.  The reason it was in the paper, is that the house (mobile home)<br/>
burned to the ground a few months later and the mom was blaming social<br/>
services for not helping out when she asked them too.  The fire started<br/>
because of a faulty appliance though.<br/>
 <br/>
My first question was why didn&#39;t the mother help her daughter clean if she<br/>
cared so much about the grand kids.  At one point the mother lived with her<br/>
daughter and grandkids, but said she had to move out because it was too<br/>
gross.  Anyway, the whole point of this story was that a filthy house might<br/>
not be enough reason to have social services involved, depending on the<br/>
state you live in.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
It&#39;s easier when they&#39;re older and the neighbors know them better (in my <br/>
experience).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just another one of those risk factors you take into consideration when <br/>
considering unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What bothers me the most is that some of the worst criticism (not about <br/>
cleanliness, but about kids not reading and that sort of thing) comes from <br/>
structured homeschoolers, because THEY are afraid of our &quot;lowering the <br/>
average&quot; or making homeschooling look unworkable.<br/>
<br/>
There is that very awkward period for unschoolers when the kids are ten, give <br/>
or take a couple of years, and they&#39;re learning TONS of stuff that doesn&#39;t <br/>
show, while the other kids are learning to write in cursive and do long <br/>
division.<br/>
<br/>
After that hump, people don&#39;t complain NEARLY as much about unschooled kids, <br/>
and I find more and more local and in-person homeschoolers who were afraid <br/>
NOT to teach their kids school-style looking at my kids, and looking at their <br/>
kids, and saying they wished they had been braver.<br/>
<br/>
But as to the fear, I do remind my kids every month or two that considering <br/>
our unschooling situation, they need to be quiet after 10:00 (in-house quiet, <br/>
not outside attracting the neighbors&#39; attention, or making noise that can be <br/>
heard outside the house), they need to wear coats when it&#39;s cold, and be <br/>
circumspect in public.   They understand it, even though we&#39;ve never had <br/>
social services visits.  They know a couple of families who have.  One poor <br/>
mom had two bio kids and had adopted three, non-English speakers (Korean and <br/>
Russian) she was gradually bringing up to speed at various ages, and she was <br/>
not really well organized.  Their huge laundry pile tended to grow in the e<br/>
ntryway, across from the door to the garage.  Once when she was having <br/>
appliance trouble and the pile was big, social services had been called by a <br/>
neighbor, and just before the CPS worker showed up, a 50 pound bag of dogfood <br/>
broke and spilled all over the pile of laundry.  Right in the doorway.    So <br/>
my kids have that vision to work (away) from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389088967">Messing with the hair is when the hassle starts.  Braids are about as bad as<br/>
combing.  We have braided at her request a few times, but it&#39;s not something<br/>
I think she would sit still for every day.  But I have a sister with much<br/>
longer hair that  is very similar to Serena&#39;s and that&#39;s her solution, too.<br/>
She keeps it in a braid all week and undoes it in the shower and combs<br/>
conditioner through it and it goes right back into the braid when she&#39;s done<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486347169">One thing to keep in mind about CPS (what it&#39;s called in Arizona) is that<br/>
you don&#39;t have to let them into our house unless they have a court order.<br/>

<br/>
You just described my Sierra to a tee. Can&#39;t even think about combing let <br/>
alone brushing when her hair is dry. Total giant fuzz. Her hair is long and <br/>
extremely curly. We go through No More Tanlges like water here. We ponytail <br/>
her hair every Friday for sports camp but I don&#39;t like doing that often. I <br/>
admit it&#39;s great as there is no tangling but I worry about what it will do <br/>
to her hair in the long run. Never thought about braiding. I&#39;ll have to try <br/>
that. Wish I knew how to french braid.<br/>
<br/>
I remember my grandmother always had her hair in a braid and wrapped around <br/>
her head. Never saw her any other way. My mom told me she saw her with her <br/>
hair down once. (it was her MIL) She said it was way past her waist. Even <br/>
though I never saw it, I always imagined seeing her like that. Very matronly <br/>
with long gray hair streaming down her back. I digress.<br/>

I can&#39;t do it on my own head, but can do it on other people&#39;s.  It&#39;s not too <br/>
hard.  I bet there are even useable instructions on line.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;I remember my grandmother always had her hair in a braid and wrapped around <br/>
her head.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember seeing the old women of twenty and thirty years ago with a kind of <br/>
french-braided crown of hair, altogether fastened all the way around.  At <br/>
grocery stores. &lt;g&gt;  Done up that fancy just to go to the store, or I would <br/>
see them at church or concerts.  But somehow the braid didn&#39;t have an end, <br/>
just fastened to them everywhere.<br/>

trouble doing my own, but I can do someone else&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
There are books written to teach different kinds of braiding.  Klutz press<br/>
makes a really good (and expensive) one, but you can probably find one in<br/>
the library.  The best one I have is probably 50 years old and cost me 25<br/>
cents at the thrift shop one day.<br/>

Yes, I was so into the idea last night that I searched and found <br/>
instructions with pictures and all. Who would have thunk it??!! It doesn&#39;t <br/>
look that hard at all. Think I will give it a try. Thanks for the idea <br/>
