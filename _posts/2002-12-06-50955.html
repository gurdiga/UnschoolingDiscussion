Illich was involved in early education reform, author of The<br/>
Deschooling Society that influenced the thinking of John Holt, John <br/>
Taylor Gatto and many others, and had some thought provoking ideas <br/>
about health care and other social issues.<br/>
<br/>
Ivan Illich on Schools:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what <br/>
the schools do for them. They school them to confuse process and <br/>
substance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the <br/>
more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation <br/>
leads to success. The pupil is thereby &quot;schooled&quot; to confuse teaching <br/>
with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with <br/>
competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His <br/>
imagination is &quot;schooled&quot; to accept service in place of value. <br/>
Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the <br/>
improvement of community life, police protection for safety, military <br/>
poise for national security, the rat race for productive work. <br/>
Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavour are <br/>
defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which <br/>
claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on <br/>
allocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools, <br/>
and other agencies in question.&quot;<br/>

&quot;To deschool means to abolish the power of one person <br/>
to oblige another person to attend a meeting.&quot; - Ivan Illich <br/>

<br/>
A couple of excerpts:<br/>
<br/>
When John Holt&#39;s book Teach Your Own: A Hopeful Path for Education <br/>
(New York: Dell) was published in 1981, it quickly became the <br/>
front-runner in a then-small selection of books about taking or <br/>
keeping kids out of school. John Holt wrote to his friend Ivan Illich <br/>
in 1972: &quot;... In working for the kind of changes we want, for a <br/>
convivial society and a nonsuicidal technology, you and I may have <br/>
slightly different functions. You may be somewhat more of a prophet <br/>
and I somewhat more of a tactician ...&quot; (from a speech by Patrick <br/>
Farenga at Penn. State University, 1977).<br/>
<br/>
In Deschooling Society Ivan Illich had written, &quot;The very existence <br/>
of obligatory schools divides any society into two realms: some time <br/>
spans and processes and treatments and professions are &#39;academic&#39; or <br/>
&#39;pedagogic,&#39; and others are not. The power of school thus to divide <br/>
social reality has no boundaries: Education becomes unworldly and the <br/>
world becomes noneducational.&quot;<br/>
