<div id="ygrps-yiv-502201484">Hi all ,I was sitting here wondering why anyone would question hs parents <br/>
motives.<br/>
Anytime I have been with a group of them I find them to be the most <br/>
interesting, intelligent people I meet today. Oh well, just a thought don&#39;t <br/>
mean to make you all blush :)<br/>

great deal of fear and disgust that some people homeschool (particularly<br/>
those horrendous Unschooling types :-0) out of laziness.  I&#39;m not sure how<br/>
they equate this, as sending them to IS would free parents time up for most<br/>
of the time on weekdays, but never the less I still hear this voiced often.<br/>
 They seem to think there are a fair amount of folks out there who just<br/>
keep their kids out of school for some unfathomable, and less than pure,<br/>
motivations and then do not do anything with them.  I have heard the<br/>
&quot;Fathers keeping girl children ignorant and under control&quot; reasoning, as<br/>
well as the &quot;keeping children in general ignorant and under control&quot; which<br/>
also extends to the idea of religious purists, who do not want any outside<br/>
messages confusing their children&#39;s indoctrination.  These misconceptions<br/>
are pretty common among those who advocate IS, and I have had people tell<br/>
me that the fact that Idaho does not regulate Homeschooling or have testing<br/>
or evaluation requirements is &quot;Just Awful!&quot;  because someone has to look<br/>
out for those poor children!  Why, how on earth could we, in good<br/>
conscious, leave them to be raised entirely by their own parents?!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726146380">There are people who think children are the chattel of their parents who must<br/>
be made to grow right or they will be depraved.  These people question anything<br/>
that grants children even a modicum of autonomy or self-determination.<br/>

&gt;Actually I hear (from people without kids or with IS kids) that there is a<br/>
&gt;great deal of fear and disgust that some people homeschool (particularly<br/>
&gt;those horrendous Unschooling types :-0) out of laziness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, for many of us (us being &quot;me and a bunch of friends of mine &lt;g&gt;),<br/>
there is the grain of truth in this.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, not that I unschool *because* I&#39;m lazy, but I definitely count it a big<br/>
whopping bonus that unschooling is what it is, following our passions, and<br/>
that I&#39;m not like the poor dears I see on all the chirpy homeschooling news<br/>
bits who are staying up until 2 a.m. each morning developing intricate<br/>
lesson plans for their 8 children.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I&#39;m honest. &lt;g&gt; I also like homeschooling because we don&#39;t have to get<br/>
up early. We&#39;re not early people here. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I second that!!  I&#39;m not lazy in general,  but I am lazy about <br/>
getting up AND I would definitely be lazy about lesson plans and <br/>
grading.  YUK!!  Still,  I think unschooling is harder for me than school at <br/>
home would be.  I&#39;d love for things to be so nice, neat and packaged.<br/>
It seems so easy to follow those plans and feel so confident.  I <br/>
have to renew my trust in my child&#39;s abilities on a daily basis and <br/>
constantly reassure myself and others.  At least I get enough sleep <br/>
:-)  <br/>
