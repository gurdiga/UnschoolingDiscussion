<div id="ygrps-yiv-682441295">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to find a game that the whole family likes.  My kids don&#39;t seem to like traditional board games much but <br/>
I thought that Cranium Cadoo for Kids looked like it could be a lot of laughs.  I&#39;d appreciate learning what others<br/>
thought of the game or if anyone has other ideas of games that like because they are funny.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035970273">We love that game here.  Ds is 6 1 / 2 but got it last year for Christmas.<br/>
WeÂ’ve had a ball with it!  Another game that we love is called Stare Jr.<br/>
You look at a picture for 60 seconds, roll a die, then answer the question<br/>
on the back of the picture card that matches your roll.  You learn to look<br/>
at the minute details after learning the kinds of questions that are asked.<br/>
It is a scream even for adults.<br/>
