<div id="ygrps-yiv-881456375">&lt;&lt;This is all sounding expensive.  I&#39;ve not yet been to a vet in the US&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just to look at this from the other side of the fence....  We have had at<br/>
least 2 dogs at all times during the last 20 years (we currently have 5).<br/>
We have never used a heartworm preventative and have never had a dog go to<br/>
the vet for an illness (One went after being hit by a car and one went after<br/>
being bit by a snake).  Any dog that has died has been of old age.<br/>
<br/>
Dh is an EMT and went to a training last night that he found very<br/>
interesting.  The speaker stated that back before they started trying to get<br/>
everyone to have CPR training, if your heart stopped away from a medical<br/>
facility, you had a 6% chance of living.  Today with so many people having<br/>
CPR training, lots of places having defibrillators (sp?) on site, advances<br/>
in medicine, better trained paramedics and better equipt ambulances, if you<br/>
have a cardiac arrest away from a medical facility, you still have a 6%<br/>
chance of living.  Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Who is it that makes us believe that better medical training and treatment<br/>
is what makes the difference between life and death in these situations?<br/>
The people who make their living providing medical training and treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>
