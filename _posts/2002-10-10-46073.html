<div id="ygrps-yiv-186402084">I&#39;ve been very busy lately and am just now catching up on this list.  I have<br/>
to comment on the &quot;lazybones&quot;, nicknames issue.  My MIL says everything with a<br/>
smile, no matter how negative. The last time she visited she talked about how<br/>
lazy my husband was as a child, she laughed and talked about it in a<br/>
good-natured way.  I watched my husband smile and wince the whole time.  I&#39;ve<br/>
lived with him for 12 years I know it hurt him, she doesn&#39;t acknowledge it or<br/>
know it.  My husband tends to excuse everything she says even if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
like it, because she says everything so &quot;lovingly&quot;.  If he calls her on it,<br/>
who looks like the spoilsport? She&#39;s just being affectionate, right?  The<br/>
mother who calls her son lazybones writes in one of her posts that the son<br/>
enjoys the nickname.  Well maybe he sees that you enjoy it and approve of it,<br/>
it doesn&#39;t mean he enjoys it.  It may take him years to admit that he hates<br/>
it, just like it has my husband.  Children usually can&#39;t sort out complex<br/>
emotions and feelings until much later.  Right now all he knows is Mommy finds<br/>
&quot;lazybones&quot; cute, later on he may realize that Mommy was comparing him to his<br/>
more active sibling, negatively.  You may say it&#39;s not a negative comparison<br/>
but the first post on this &quot;lazy&quot; issue spoke volumns, every post after that<br/>
is just defensiveness.  I&#39;m not trying to be mean, just truthful.  I&#39;ve<br/>
unconsciously done the labeling thing to my own son.  Fortunately I&#39;ve had<br/>
friends and family call me on it and I&#39;ve taken into account what they have to<br/>
say.  Other people are not always right in their opinion but I figure if the<br/>
issue is presenting itself to me there is a damn good reason and I better look<br/>
at it closely before I dismiss it.  I&#39;d urge you to do the same.</div>
