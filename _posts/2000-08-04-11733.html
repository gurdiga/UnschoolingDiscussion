quizzing the kids from time to time. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Hi all:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been silent for a while, but when something annoys me I have to say <br/>
something.  What I love (sarcastic tone) about these &quot;husbands/fathers/men of <br/>
children&quot; is that it seems to me they are at work most of the time and don&#39;t <br/>
actually participate in the daily dealing with kids who are unschooled.  It&#39;s <br/>
like they are the teachers and the wives have to prove to them what the kids <br/>
are learning or she won&#39;t be able to go on with it.<br/>
<br/>
I have found in all things that the less someone knows about a subject, such <br/>
as unschooling, the Libertarian Party, England, astrologer.... you pick the <br/>
subject, the more opinions they have about why it won&#39;t work or if you would <br/>
do.... then it would be like school...<br/>
<br/>
I just think that living outside of the box as I do with this unschooling <br/>
situation is very misunderstood by others.  My husband is not one of those <br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll quiz them to see if they are up to the level I think they should be at, <br/>
even though I&#39;m not around them most of the day&quot; husband and when we were <br/>
looking at sending Zak to Preschool.  He said something like &quot;I want to make <br/>
sure it&#39;s blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah (you fill in the blanks)&quot;  My <br/>
response was &quot;that&#39;s nice dear&quot;... I completely ignored him because I knew he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be the one doing the research and reading the books etc.  If they <br/>
are that interested in what&#39;s going on then they will be the ones to stay <br/>
home and see on a daily basis what they are learning, without coming home and <br/>
&quot;quizzing&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully those of you who are married to these &quot;types&quot; won&#39;t get defensive <br/>
about their behaviour but if you do, maybe that&#39;s something to look at....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555101448">&lt;&lt; As long as everyone decides to drop the subject here, I am willing to do <br/>
the same.  I do, however feel that I deserve an apology, whether it be public <br/>
or private. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Talk about control!!!!!  Wow.... so I&#39;m not allowed to respond to anything or <br/>
say anything about a particular subject unless I first get your approval?  <br/>
Now that&#39;s a novel idea in my life (LOL)...  That&#39;s not how life works <br/>
Meschell... If you don&#39;t like something then it&#39;s up to you to take a look at <br/>
what buttons that pushes in your life and how you need to deal with those <br/>
feelings, not try and stop other people from having their own belief systems. <br/>
  Or is that the Christian thing to do.  I&#39;d hate to think that you are <br/>
representing the Christian religion in telling people (presumably including <br/>
me) to stop talking about something.  I&#39;m in America and one of the reasons <br/>
to be here is freedom of speech and not to be quashed by someone&#39;s religious <br/>
beliefs.  I could have stayed in England and been told what to believe (LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Some of the above is said with annoyance... Annoyance that anyone would try <br/>
and stop me from saying my piece... Some of it is said with incredulity that <br/>
anyone would believe they have the right to do so... And some of it is said <br/>
with laughter and the absurdity of the situation....<br/>
<br/>
As always I shall continue to give my opinion when I want to. (said with <br/>
conviction)<br/>
