&gt;way to include pre-school children, when they are 2 and 3 on up, to join in<br/>
&gt;with the education reform public school system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please note that this is &quot;voluntary&quot; at first.  The plans are to make it<br/>
&gt;mandatory.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Gov. Gary Locke, Superintendent of Public Instruction Unveil<br/>
&gt; &gt; First-ever Statewide Kindergarten Readiness Guidelines<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; SEATTLE - Oct. 19, 2004 - Gov. Gary Locke and Superintendent of Public<br/>
&gt; &gt; Instruction Terry Bergeson today unveiled the first-ever statewide<br/>
&gt; &gt; guidelines for kindergarten readiness to successfully prepare children for<br/>
&gt; &gt; kindergarten and beyond.  Locke and Bergeson outlined the Washington State<br/>
&gt; &gt; Early Learning and Development Benchmarks during a news conference at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tiny Tots Development Center in Seattle.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The goal of the voluntary guidelines is to give parents, preschool<br/>
&gt; &gt; teachers<br/>
&gt; &gt; and child care providers a common set of expectations of what children<br/>
&gt; &gt; need<br/>
&gt; &gt; to know before they enter kindergarten to ensure that they are adequately<br/>
&gt; &gt; prepared for school.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;We want all Washington children ready and eager to learn when they enter<br/>
&gt; &gt; school,&quot; Locke said.  &quot;It&#39;s vital that our kids have the proper knowledge<br/>
&gt; &gt; and skills they need to succeed.  If children aren&#39;t adequately prepared<br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; kindergarten, they often fall behind and run the risk of never catching<br/>
&gt; &gt; up.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bergeson said, &quot;One of my long-term goals has been to create a more<br/>
&gt; &gt; seamless<br/>
&gt; &gt; transition for students through our education system, so that one step<br/>
&gt; &gt; clearly leads to the next.  The new early learning benchmarks make it very<br/>
&gt; &gt; clear how we can best prepare our young children to succeed in<br/>
&gt; &gt; kindergarten<br/>
&gt; &gt; and beyond.  This is an exciting step forward in working together for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; benefit of our kids.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Locke and Bergeson stressed that learning must begin at <br/>
&gt; home,frombirth.BR &gt; Research from organizations like the Governor&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Commission on Early<br/>
&gt; &gt; Learning, co-chaired by First Lady Mona Locke and Melinda Gates, shows<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; what children learn from birth to age five is extremely important to their<br/>
&gt; &gt; academic, social and physical development.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The kindergarten readiness guidelines describe what children need to know<br/>
&gt; &gt; and be able to do when they enter school.  They cover the five primary<br/>
&gt; &gt; domains of learning for young children:<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Physical health, well being and motor development;<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Social and emotional development;<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Approaches toward learning;<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Cognition and general knowledge; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Language and communication.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The benchmarks outline goals under each of these categories and provide<br/>
&gt; &gt; examples of indicators of progress and strategies that adults can use to<br/>
&gt; &gt; support development.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For example, one goal is that children understand the relationship between<br/>
&gt; &gt; cause and effect.  Under Cognition and General Knowledge - Logic and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Reasoning, the benchmarks state that:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; From birth to 18 months, children should be able to:<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Use sounds, gestures and movements to communicate with<br/>
&gt; &gt; adults.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Repeat actions many times to cause the desired effect.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Act on an object making a pleasing sight, sound or motion.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Look for dropped objects.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Adults are encouraged to:<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Demonstrate and explain the relationships between things -<br/>
&gt; &gt; like showing children that &quot;When you pull the drain plug, the water goes<br/>
&gt; &gt; away&quot; or &quot;When you turn the crank, the jack pops out of the box.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Provide children with experiences and materials that<br/>
&gt; &gt; demonstrate cause and effect relationships.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; From 18 months to 36 months, children should be able to:<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Experiment with the effect of their own actions on objects.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Observe others&#39; actions to see the effect they will have on<br/>
&gt; &gt; objects.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Express an understanding of cause and effect.  For example,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they should understand &quot;It&#39;s quiet because you turned off the radio.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Adults are encouraged to:<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Play with different materials so children can see the<br/>
&gt; &gt; changes.  For example, demonstrate how flour and water make dough.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Describe how objects change when acted upon.  For example,<br/>
&gt; &gt; explain that &quot;the batter turns into cake&quot; or &quot;the water turns into ice.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; From 36 months to 60 months, children should be able to:<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Identify objects that influence or affect other objects.<br/>
&gt; &gt; For example, &quot;The sun makes the ice melt.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Ask &quot;why&quot; questions to show effort at understanding cause<br/>
&gt; &gt; and effect.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Predict the effect that an action will have on objects.<br/>
&gt; &gt; For<br/>
&gt; &gt; example, &quot;It will be dark when you turn off the light.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Adults are encouraged to:<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Encourage children to play independently, discovering cause<br/>
&gt; &gt; and effect relationships on their own.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Engage children in activities that demonstrate cause and<br/>
&gt; &gt; effect, like cooking projects or planting seeds.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Ask children about cause and effect relationships like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;What<br/>
&gt; &gt; does it take to make flowers grow?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; From 60 months to kindergarten entry, children should be able to:<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Structure experiments to see how changes in one factor<br/>
&gt; &gt; influence changes in others.  For example, mixing paint to create new<br/>
&gt; &gt; colors.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Predict how things will change, given changes in<br/>
&gt; &gt; circumstances.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Recognize which element of an object causes the effect.<br/>
&gt; &gt; For<br/>
&gt; &gt; example, &quot;The beads inside the box make the noise.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Adults are encouraged to:<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Provide children with multiple materials to create<br/>
&gt; &gt; experiments.<br/>
&gt; &gt;        *       Talk with children about the steps taken to cause an<br/>
&gt; &gt; outcome.  For example, explore the steps needed to cook a meal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;We have taken another step forward in further improving education in our<br/>
&gt; &gt; state,&quot; Locke said.  &quot;These guidelines will give children a better<br/>
&gt; &gt; opportunity to succeed in school by giving parents, child care providers<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; preschool teachers a better understanding of what our kids should know and<br/>
&gt; &gt; when.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The development of the Washington State Early Learning and Development<br/>
&gt; &gt; Benchmarks was a partnership between the Governor&#39;s Office, the Office of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) and the state Benchmark<br/>
&gt; &gt; Advisory<br/>
&gt; &gt; Panel, with grants from the Head Start-State Collaboration Office and<br/>
&gt; &gt; OSPI.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The state also enlisted the help of renowned early learning expert Dr.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lynn<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kagan and a team of experts from the National Center for Children and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Families at Columbia University to draft the readiness guidelines.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The guidelines are preliminary, and will be reviewed and vetted through<br/>
&gt; &gt; early learning stakeholder groups during the next several months.  After<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nov. 8, more information about the guidelines will be available at:<br/>
