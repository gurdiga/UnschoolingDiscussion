<br/>
There&#39;s a DVD with ALL the schoolhouse rock stuff now, and some of it&#39;s <br/>
fairly recent.<br/>
We also have a computer game with all the math videos and also games.<br/>
<br/>
The only song my kids learned to sing that had to do with numbers (I think) <br/>
was on a Discovery Toys tape called &quot;Sounds Like Fun&quot; and the words were <br/>
I can count by tens<br/>
up to a hundred<br/>
I can count by tens<br/>
Ready, here I go:<br/>
Ten, twenty, thirty<br/>
Forty, fifty, sixty<br/>
Seventy, eighty, ninety,<br/>
one hundred.<br/>
<br/>
Although the tape didn&#39;t say so, it was basically a go-to-sleep tape, because <br/>
the songs were all about the same speed and sung quietly.  All about slow <br/>
heartbeat speed.<br/>
<br/>
But my kids really liked it, all of them.  We still chuck it in sometimes if <br/>
we&#39;re doing housework, or just for fun because it surfaces.  <br/>
<br/>
And Marty, especially, had a lot of fun screwing with that one, singing<br/>
I can count by ones up to a thousand,<br/>
I can count by ones, ready here I go...<br/>
 and singing until we begged him to stop.<br/>
<br/>
Or <br/>
I can count by ones up to one<br/>
I count by ones, ready here I go.<br/>
One.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306106387">You can also get the SchoolHouse Rock DVD, which has all the songs, plus a <br/>
few extra.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still going on, but for a while there was <br/>
a deal where teachers (and homeschooling parents, I found out) can get the <br/>
DVD for 50% off.  I posted the link for it a couple months back, but I <br/>
can&#39;t remember it right now.  If you&#39;re interested, maybe you can search <br/>
the archives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to be a Dorling Kindersly books consultant and my free package<br/>
included a book and tape with the multiplication tables.  It&#39;s around here<br/>
someplace.  I think they still make it.  Why?  It doesn&#39;t sound like you<br/>
want one!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293188464">of course, didn&#39;t like, as I felt the records were for little<br/>
kids. <br/>
(but I do remember the songs in my head today!)<br/>
