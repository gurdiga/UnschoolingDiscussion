<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734153818">Regarding Sandra&#39;s note about only sending messages about unschooling AND<br/>
emailing personally for personal stuff:<br/>
<br/>
Especially the personal email between just two emailers. It makes me sound<br/>
grouchy, I know, but there is just too much to wade through when people are<br/>
generally chatting back and forth and sharing it with everyone. All of our<br/>
email addresses appear on each email, so we could probably cut the number<br/>
of emails by 25% (at least) if people would do a little more private<br/>
emailing. If it&#39;s not related to UNschooling or if it&#39;s more of a personal<br/>
nature or not that important that EVERYONE see it, please reply to the<br/>
person&#39;s email address privately. Then maybe I can change back from the<br/>
digest version to the regular version!<br/>
<br/>
And now I will mind my own business.<br/>

I concure, especially when I see &quot;Dear So & So,....&quot; or a thank-you sent to <br/>
someone, those could be sent personally.<br/>
My 2 cents...<br/>
