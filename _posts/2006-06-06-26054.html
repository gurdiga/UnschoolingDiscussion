&quot;It is amazing to me how strong my reaction was. Fear and conditioning <br/>
is a powerful force in our actions&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
This is so true.....just recently I have begun to look at every reaction<br/>
as coming from Love or Fear and it is amazing how all my negative<br/>
reactions/no&#39;s are fear based..... My new method to control these<br/>
immediate reactions is to  try to stop the &quot;no&quot; or negative response<br/>
before it escapes my lips and ask myself, &quot;why are you afraid/shutting<br/>
down/being closed minded, etc.&quot;  <br/>
By doing this I can usually laugh away the fear or figure out why I feel<br/>
the way I do and discuss it rather than just say &quot;no&quot;It really is<br/>
amazing how much is just conditioning and can be laughed away!<br/>
 <br/>
For instance, my 11 year old wants to have 6 of his buddies sleep<br/>
over....I&#39;m tired, I have plans to get up early and go cycling the next<br/>
day, my husband is out of town, blah, blah, blah...so I want to say no<br/>
because I&#39;m afraid of them needing more than I can give, etc.  and in<br/>
the past, I would have given the &quot;no&quot; answer.....<br/>
Now, instead I ask....&quot;why the no?&quot;  I discuss the above with my son and<br/>
we figure out ways to work through the above....he gets permission from<br/>
his friends  parents  for them to be here under my older son&#39;s<br/>
supervision  while I go on my ride( I was amazed that no parents cared<br/>
that I wouldn&#39;t be here for 2-3 hours:-) ), they&#39;ll let me get my sleep<br/>
and wake me only for problems, they all agree to behave....you get the<br/>
picture.....<br/>
I can&#39;t believe how many times I have just said &quot;no&quot; to things without<br/>
really thinking and examining the reason for my &quot;no&quot;  I think it was<br/>
just a bad habit that I learned from my parents and a response to<br/>
irrational fears of losing control!<br/>
I can&#39;t remember where I read it, but awhile ago I read that all<br/>
actions, reactions, etc. are either results of feelings of  love or<br/>
fear....<br/>
It really simplifies things when you begin to examine yourself and<br/>
others from this angle and it&#39;s kind of fun!<br/>

<br/>
Depending how old the older son is, and how far away the next nearest  <br/>
parent is, I might object.  But if the boy is in late teens and the  <br/>
house isn&#39;t too far from civilization (other parents, ambulance) it  <br/>
could be okay.<br/>
<br/>
My first thought, though, was that if the bike ride can&#39;t be  <br/>
cancelled, maybe it&#39;s not a good night for a sleepover (again,  <br/>
depending how old that older son is).<br/>

Needing a drink of water?<br/>
Going to the bathroom?<br/>
Scratching?<br/>
Planting flowers?<br/>
Watching movies or reading e-mail?<br/>
<br/>
I do lots of things that don&#39;t have to do with love or fear.<br/>
