reviewed by Jim Powell<br/>
<br/>
Gatto, the fabled New York City Teacher of the Year who made headlines when<br/>
he turned against government schooling, reminds the historically minded of<br/>
William Lloyd Garrison with his slashing moral attacks against government<br/>
schooling.<br/>
<br/>
He denounces it &quot;as a gigantic indoctrination and sorting machine, robbing<br/>
people of their children. . . . You aren&#39;t compelled to loan your car to<br/>
anyone who wants it, but you are compelled to surrender your school age<br/>
child to strangers who process children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Government schooling kills the family by monopolizing the best times of<br/>
childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents.&quot; He exposes the<br/>
errors of &quot;short-answer tests, bells, uniform time blocks, age grading,<br/>
standardization, and all the rest of the school religion.&quot; Schools, he says,<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t need more money or a longer year, they need free-market choices,<br/>
variety that speaks to every need.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This book is brilliant. When I finished it I felt like I&#39;d just gone fifteen<br/>
rounds with me champ. This book is unlike any other, for my money the best<br/>
approach to an understanding of the mythology of public education in America<br/>
around.<br/>
--Chris Mercogliano, Director, The Albany Free School<br/>
<br/>
Gatto&#39;s voice is strong and unique, a Socrates of the educational world.<br/>
Don&#39;t deny yourself the blood-curdling pleasure of reading this perverse<br/>
history of American education as a design for a real life. I loved this<br/>
book!<br/>
--Thomas Moore, author of Care of the Soul<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loved John Gatto&#39;s work ever since I first encountered his astounding<br/>
essays in The Rerun. This analysis of schooling is presented with daring,<br/>
panache, and a humorous passion that leaps off the page. I give this book a<br/>
standing ovation! Bravo!<br/>
--Christiane Northrup, M.D., author of Women&#39;s Bodies, Women&#39;s Wisdom<br/>
<br/>
The emotional effect of Underground History cannot be overstated. It reminds<br/>
me of the reporter watching the Hindenburg burst into flames who cried, &quot;Oh,<br/>
the humanity!&quot; Gatto is crying here, &quot;Oh, the Children!&quot; This is the most<br/>
important education book of my lifetime.<br/>
--Michael Farris, President, Home School Legal Defense Association<br/>
<br/>
These pages burn with insight and controversy. You cannot read this book<br/>
without changing the way you look at schools.<br/>
--Pat Farenga, President, John Holt Associates<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in the fate of our schools should make this book a<br/>
priority. Gatto&#39;s insistence on calling a spade a spade in recognizing the<br/>
bases on which modern schooling has been built leaves no doubt that our<br/>
well-being requires us to leave behind the concept of institutional<br/>
education as a social good.<br/>
--Dan Greenberg, co-founder, The Sudbury Valley School<br/>
<br/>
Gatto tells us straight up what&#39;s wrong with school in his powerful<br/>
trademark blend of passion and hard thinking. Grounded in a careful study of<br/>
history, craned out of the context of his own brilliant 30-year teaching<br/>
career, this book will validate your own shadowy intuition about schooling.<br/>
--Grace Llewelyn, author of The Teenage Liberation Handbook<br/>
<br/>
He paints a scathing picture of caring people&#39;s best intentions undermined.<br/>
. . . examines the psychology, economics, sociology, anthropology, and<br/>
politics of modern institutionalized forced schooling, concluding it cannot<br/>
be reformed because it is doing exactly what it is designed to do. Don&#39;t<br/>
miss this inspiring rebel educator.<br/>
--The Open Center, New York City<br/>
<br/>
I can honestly say there are few things I&#39;ve read recently, or probably<br/>
ever, that provoked me to exclaim &quot;This is so RIGHT!&quot; with such alarming<br/>
regularity.<br/>
--Chersteen Anderson, Director, Sisters Under the Skin<br/>
<br/>
Thought-provoking, entertaining, and intelligent. Based on years of reading<br/>
education books I was expecting a drowsy read of little or no content. Was I<br/>
surprised! Wonderful.<br/>
--Judith Current, Teacher, Colorado<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion this is one of the most important books on education ever<br/>
written. Gatto takes us on a journey, tracing the development of his own<br/>
thinking about government schooling. Here is the whole story, the hidden<br/>
agendas, the true believers, the dumbing down. If you care at all about<br/>
children, you&#39;ll be livid as you read.<br/>
--Cathy Duly, THE LINK<br/>
<br/>
A breathtaking work of scholarship and encyclopedic scope . . . history<br/>
accompanied by an incisive and illuminating narrative. Gatto delivers for<br/>
our consideration an astonishing cast of cranks while revealing the nest of<br/>
special interests which profit from schools just as they are. This marvelous<br/>
book should be required reading for anyone interested in the frightening<br/>
truth about the enterprise we call &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
--Adam Robinson, author, What Smart Students Know<br/>
<br/>
Gatto addresses the deadening heart of compulsory schooling with its<br/>
assumptions and structures which stamp out the self-knowledge, curiosity,<br/>
concentration, and solitude which are essential to learning. He speaks of<br/>
the contradiction between human purpose and abstract state purpose, giving<br/>
examples of what can happen when the everyday genius of ordinary people is<br/>
allowed to develop.<br/>
--Human Scale Education Annual Conference, London<br/>
<br/>
The most important book on education I have ever read. It will open your<br/>
eyes and, God willing, change your children&#39;s lives.<br/>
--Mary Pride, author, The Big Book of Home Learning</div>

<br/>
The Underground History of American Education by John Taylor Gatto: A<br/>
Schoolteachers Intimate Investigation Into the Problem of Modern Schooling<br/>
<br/>
Our favorite radical education theorist has done it again! Seven years in<br/>
the making, over 300,000 words and 412 pages with an extensive index - this<br/>
is definitely not a fluff book. John Taylor Gatto is a former New York<br/>
City and New York State Teacher of the year. Author of Dumbing Us Down,<br/>
Gatto is an advocate of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What do the Prussian military, coal mining companies, the industrial<br/>
revolution, and the principles of scientific management have in common?<br/>
According to Gatto, they forever changed our early educational practices and<br/>
contributed to the creation of our modern American school system, and that<br/>
is definitely not a good thing!<br/>
<br/>
George Washington, with no schooling until he was eleven (and then only two<br/>
years of school) could handle geometry and trigonometry that would challenge<br/>
many college students today. He became the architect of his own estate and<br/>
started several successful businesses as a young man. Gatto tells us that<br/>
today, No public school in the United States is set up to allow a George<br/>
Washington to happen. Washingtons in the bud stage are screened, browbeaten,<br/>
or bribed to conform to a narrow outlook on social truth. Boys like Andrew<br/>
Carnegie who begged his mother not to send him to school and was well on his<br/>
way to immortality and fortune at the age of thirteen would be referred<br/>
today for psychological counseling; Thomas Edison would find himself in<br/>
Special Ed until his peculiar genius had been tamed.<br/>
<br/>
At times scholarly, at times stream-of-consciousness, and at times<br/>
passionate cheerleading, this is a book that will challenge many of your<br/>
ideas about education while at the same time confirming many of your<br/>
suspicions. I can assure you that as you read this book you may at times<br/>
find yourself exclaiming out loud in agreement with what you read, or<br/>
muttering disagreements under your breath, but you definitely wont find<br/>
yourself bored.<br/>
<br/>
