<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462902688">Please help! Both my kids (10yog and 7yob) are very into drawing<br/>
two-dimensional things and then trying to move them using gravity,<br/>
electrical impulses etc on the computer screen. we were using a site called<br/>
&quot;construction&quot; (I think) but it is a bit wordy and complicated. Does anyone<br/>
know of a site where kids can build and then &quot;animate&quot; stuff?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so pathetically vague but I have only the faintest glimmer of<br/>
understanding about this whole topic!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Brooke</div>
