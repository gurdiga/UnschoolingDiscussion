If it&#39;s a good game, it probably works as well in the winter or spring or <br/>
fall as summer, I&#39;m guessing.   <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m back. It&#39;s the new school year and so what better time than now for me to tell everyone <br/>
(again) about Multiflyer. It&#39;s an excellent, award winning online Multiplication game that <br/>
has turned the light on for many children struggling with multiplication. Play online (for <br/>
FREE!) or become a registered user and get some really cool extras (see demos at the site.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546856882">Yesterday a bunch of us went to Beverly Hills to visit the &quot;Museum of <br/>
Radio and Television&quot; there. We had signed up for a workshop called, <br/>
&quot;Re-creating Radio.&quot; We were 12 kids and 7 moms. Some did performance <br/>
parts and others did sound effects and we put on a radio drama - aliens <br/>
invading and a planet being destroyed, etc. Pretty cool script with a <br/>
surprise twist at the end. The sound effect stuff was very cool, too - <br/>
lots of gizmos and also everyday things used. We did one rehearsal and <br/>
then recorded the program. The kids were AWESOME - these are very <br/>
theatrically-oriented kids and the museum people were very impressed. <br/>
They usually just give you the tape of the show, but they wanted to <br/>
keep it to use as a sample for other groups or to play for people when <br/>
they&#39;re trying to get them to contribute to the museum, so they&#39;re <br/>
going to send us copies of the recording later this week.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Museum of Radio and Television in New York City, too, as <br/>
well as here in Beverly Hills.<br/>
<br/>
So - after the workshop, the museum was open to the public and we <br/>
stayed. It was just such a gratifying feeling to be in such a BEAUTIFUL <br/>
place - the museum architecture is spacious and gorgeous - that is <br/>
devoted to tv and takes it seriously and is just unabashed about it.<br/>
<br/>
The have various screening rooms with big screens and a schedule of <br/>
shows being broadcast each day - so you can just go and watch. And they <br/>
have a huge library of shows - you select what you want to watch and <br/>
sit at a personal &quot;console&quot; to watch it. On a big-screen, I watched a <br/>
Alfred Hitchcock piece about a man who was thought to be dead, after a <br/>
car crash, but wasn&#39;t. I also listened, in the listening room, to an <br/>
hour&#39;s worth of &quot;I&#39;m Sorry, I&#39;ll Read that Again,&quot; which was John <br/>
Cleese and Eric Idle and Graham Chapman and some other comedians in a <br/>
radio show they did pre-Monty Python days. It was very very good - very <br/>
funny. Some of the kids watched old Twilight Zone episodes in a group <br/>
screening room. Roxana watched a video of &quot;Company&quot; - the musical. I <br/>
also watched the Ed Sullivan show with the Beatles appearing for the <br/>
first time. They were showing the various Simpsons Halloween specials <br/>
in a big-screen viewing room, too, but we went out to get lunch and <br/>
missed it.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be going back, for sure. It was free, by the way - although they <br/>
have suggested donation amounts.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to think, in advance, of what I might like to see and things <br/>
the kids might like. I know one thing is a broadcast of the first moon <br/>
landing.<br/>
<br/>
So - any other suggestions? What would you watch if you had access to a <br/>
LOT of old tv programming?<br/>

we had teenagers who are USED to time pressure and performing in <br/>
public, etc. (This was a Destination Imagination team outing.) And even <br/>
for them it took a LOT of concentration and focus.<br/>

Apparently my father was on an episode of Ed Sullivan, before he was with my<br/>
mother. I want to go up there and look it up in the old Ed Sullivan files<br/>
they have. He was a juggler and tightrope walker.<br/>
<br/>
Once a year they do a Children&#39;s Day there, aimed at younger folk. We went<br/>
up 2 years ago and saw Strawberry Shortcake and Madeline costumed<br/>
characters, and they had crafts stuff out. The programming in the screening<br/>
room was not interesting to Jayn, but it could be to others. It is good to<br/>
get on their mailing list. Recently they were doing a series of screenings<br/>
of superheroes on tv - including an episode of the rarely seen &quot;The<br/>
Champions&quot; from the 1960&#39;s UK. Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t get there. I love<br/>
The Champions though.<br/>

Holly said the other day that she would like to see &quot;What&#39;s My Line,&quot; because <br/>
there are so many references to it in other places.<br/>
<br/>
Queen for a Day was like a horror show, because the moms would tell their <br/>
tales of really truly pitiful woe (&quot;my husband&#39;s crippled and we don&#39;t have a <br/>
washing machine or a car&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m a widow and my children don&#39;t have any clothes <br/>
and we&#39;d like to be able to get school clothes&quot;), and then one would get her <br/>
washer or whatever, and I don&#39;t think the others got diddly.  (Maybe they got <br/>
the sympathy of their neighbors or churches and got some help later.)<br/>

<br/>
We had the first season of Mork and Mindy from Netflix recently.  My son <br/>
really liked it.  (So score 1 Mom brownie point for me for noticing and <br/>
strewing it. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
** I&#39;d like to show the kids some old commercials.  Pepsodent, Hamm&#39;s, <br/>

<br/>
Yeah.  I like the ads in decades-old magazines that are sometimes found <br/>
bound at libraries.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) often lists TV roles and <br/>
guest appearances that actors have done.  So it might be fun to look up <br/>
each of your favorite actors, if there&#39;s someone you think is talented <br/>
or swoon-worthy.<br/>

Just yesterday I got a 2 DVD set of 3 hours and 50 minutes of old<br/>
commercials from the 50&#39;s to the 70&#39;s for $8.99 (at Newbury Comics but I<br/>
think that&#39;s local.) Amazon has it for $10.78<br/>

There isn&#39;t film of lots of that.<br/>

The Peter Pan that&#39;s preserved on video was one of several live years that <br/>
was preserved somehow (I think) and then shown year after year in my own <br/>
childhood.<br/>
<br/>
There was a for-TV production of Rogers and Hammerstein&#39;s Cinderella with <br/>
Julie Andrews (for whom it was composed) and they only reason it was recorded at <br/>
all was for later broadcast west coast (I think that&#39;s what I read) and the <br/>
