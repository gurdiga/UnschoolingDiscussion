&gt; Oh, sweetie, there are recovery groups so you don&#39;t have to go it alone!<br/>
&gt; (Ignore me if you&#39;ve already founnd or looked into support.) It will help<br/>
&gt; not having to shoulder all this guilt yourself. And they won&#39;t be full of<br/>
&gt; people who have soured on Christianity. I do know people who have held onto<br/>
&gt; their Christianity while dropping the fundamentalism.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s some things that turned up from Google by typing in christian<br/>
&gt; fundamentalism recovery support. This isn&#39;t necessarily the best of best.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s lots more and changing the search words will turn up even more.<br/>

Thank-you.....I can just say one simple thing.....thank-you.<br/>
I am crying big time......WHEW......A relief......THANK_YOU<br/>
