<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501585778">Recently there has been a repeating theme, and that is how unschooling is imrpoved by clearer thought, and that thoughts become clearer from writing carefully.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean great writers are better unschoolers.  Some people can write about unschooling and not do it very well.<br/>
<br/>
What it means is that from looking at the way writing or speech can show confusion, or fallacy, or problems in thought, an individual can reach a new level of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to respond with some examples, and I invite others to do so, too.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a message I got this morning:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Hi Sandra i need to ask you if you have some writings about procrastination and children...thanks a lot-=-<br/>
<br/>
I responded one way (below) but to seed this topic, I want to look at the wording of the question.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I need to ask you if you have...&quot;<br/>
If it had said &quot;Do you have some writings about procrastination and children?&quot; I would&#39;ve responded the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back at it, though, the writer assigned herself to ask me, or she termed it &quot;a need&quot;—something she needed to do.<br/>
Perhaps, then, asking me took it off her checklist of things she had needed to do.<br/>
<br/>
If so, perhaps in her thinking there are things her children need to do.<br/>
And she sees them not doing those things.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps (MAYBE, it&#39;a s guess) the procrastination is failure to meet a paternal expectation she&#39;s not even aware of having created, within herself.  Maybe I should send this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-important-is-your-child.html">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-important-is-your-child.html</a>  (If your child is more important than your vision of your child, life becomes easier.)<br/>
<br/>
My actual response was this:<br/>
<br/>
No, but if you tell me more about what your problem is I might have writings to help parents stop thinking children are procrastinating.<br/>

<br/>
Will a person change from reading those things?  Only from changing.<br/>
Reading a little (trying a little....) is a necessity.  But learning to be clear in one&#39;s own questions and concerns can help all by itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480536827">Using other people&#39;s phrases can show lack of clarity.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/phrases">http://sandradodd.com/phrases</a><br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;my kids are fussing and fighting,&quot; for example, it&#39;s clear to me that they are looking through the dyes of an older relatives, and criticizing themselves for not being better disciplinarians, perhaps, or judging their children to be &quot;misbehaving&quot; (another odd term people use sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
If they can look directly at their children and tell us what they are actually doing (rather than summarizing it as &quot;fussing and fighting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another example is telling us (or anyone) what  a child would do &quot;if left to his own devices.&quot;<br/>
Rephrasing that might lead the parent to figure out the answer herself.  If she finds she&#39;s unable to rephrase it, that&#39;s even MORE important to know. :-)   But if the rephrase is &quot;If I don&#39;t tell him what to do,&quot; or &quot;if he&#39;s left all by himself&quot; then they can think of what more experienced unschoolers might say about either of those. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241423601">Watch the words you use when you speak, because they&#39;re probably the words you use when you think.  (I wrote that a few years ago, somewhere)<br/>
<br/>
Watch the words you use when you write, because you already thought them. :-)<br/>
If people are choosing their words carefully, and yet writing unclearly, they need to think more.<br/>
If people are NOT choosing their words carefully, why are they not?  Why would people fling words they hadn&#39;t considered well into an international discussion?<br/>

He says it&#39;s like magic. &nbsp;:-)&nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">One example of where this comes to mind for me was when Ethan learned to ride a bicycle. &nbsp;Until he was seven or so, Ethan did not want to ride his two wheeler. &nbsp;He wanted one, so we got him one. He tried it a couple of times, couldn&#39;t get it, got very upset, decided he wasn&#39;t ready, and left it. He would ride his tiny trike or scooter along side us while Doug and I rode our bikes. &nbsp;He would ride a tag-a-long on my bike. &nbsp;But, even with training wheels, he did not want to ride his bike. &nbsp;He said wanted to watch. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">I remember discouragingly saying to him, &quot;You can&#39;t learn to ride a bike by watching&quot;. &nbsp;Yet, he remained happily true to his way, and continued to watch and ride along side us. &nbsp;One afternoon he asked me and Doug to take him and our bikes to a parking lot in a nearby park. &nbsp;He asked to have the training wheels taken off his two-wheeler. &nbsp;I told him I didn&#39;t think it was a good idea because he had hardly ridden the bike with the training wheels on. &nbsp;I was convinced he was going to fall and hurt himself, or at least be discouraged again when he found out he couldn&#39;t ride it as easily as he thought he could. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">He insisted. &nbsp;So, Doug took the hardly used training wheels off his bike. &nbsp;Ethan asked Doug to give him a push and then stand back. &nbsp;With that initial push, a couple wobbles, and a few rotations of the foot pedals, he was confidently riding his bike. When he got back, he said to me &quot;See?&quot;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">I learned that day that Ethan is pretty clear about how he learns best. &nbsp;As I watched him ride away, I recalled him walking when he was ready, talking (at 2) when he was ready, reading when he was ready, and now riding when he was ready. &nbsp;All accomplished by patiently watching first, then doing later. &nbsp;To me, from the outside and with all the historical chatter in my head, it looked like Ethan was putting off wanting to do the work to learn to ride his bike. &nbsp;It looked like he was hoping to simply think himself into doing it. &nbsp;I, critically (and wrongly), thought that was a lazy, misguided approach. &nbsp;Turns out it was the best approach for him. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">What looks like procrastination to an outsider, might be something entirely different inside the learner&#39;s mind. &nbsp;And, there is probably a really good reason for it. &nbsp;My husband works best and brightest when he&#39;s closest to a big deadline. &nbsp;He does a great deal of thinking and pausing along the way. &nbsp;Then, a few days before everything is due, he goes into overdrive, burns the midnight hours, and creates a masterpiece. He, himself, calls that time before his final push procrastinating. &nbsp;Maybe it is. &nbsp;But, I don&#39;t see it as detrimental. &nbsp;I see it as a very integral part of his process of pushing his creative mind to it fullest expression. &nbsp;It&#39;s not how I do things, but it is a strategy that has worked very, very well for him over the years.<br><br>Karen James</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966865829"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tr><td valign="top">Thank you for these thoughts - it just hit me that this style of learning is exactly how my son learns. I kind of knew it and developed some trust into him doing things when he was ready, but I never really made the clear and strong connection your post gave me.<br/><br/>My son Lukas didn&#39;t speak until he was 2.5 years old. He understood and communicated non-verbally very well but he did not speak. Luckily we had a pediatrician who was not alarmed and very confident that Lukas was just fine. At 2.5 years old Lukas started speaking in 2 languages (my husband is American and I&#39;m German) in full 3-4 word sentences, had quite a vocabulary and mostly used correct grammar. It was literally over night - like he had waited to speak until he could do it right. He had patiently listened and probably practiced in his mind. Looking back he learned many other skills the same way. <br/><br/>As I
 said I kind of knew this but I&#39;m very glad for the conscious, clear understanding I got about this learning style. It will prevent me from hindering my son to learn the way he knows to be best for himself. I realized again that Unschooling is a lot about providing an interesting, full environment but also about getting out of the way when learning happens. This seems to be an important learning process especially for young Unschoolers (like my family). I&#39;m still sometimes worried about &quot;falling behind&quot;, especially more recently since many of my son&#39;s friends have started school (he is turning 6 tomorrow). On the other hand I have more and more experiences to look back at when learning happened best without my interference which makes me more confident about our unschooling journey. So while the difference in how learning happens gets more obvious as my son gets older (in comparison to schooled children) at the same time our conviction that this is
 working for our family grows since we have all these amazing learning moments to look back at. It makes me worry and compare less the longer we go.<br/><br/><br/>Sabine<br/><br/><br/>Sabine<br/><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://overview.mail.yahoo.com?.src=iOS"><br/><br/>Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPad</a></td></tr></table>            <div id="ygrps-yiv-1966865829_origMsg_">
