Joz asks:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Questions:<br/>
&gt; What is the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned replies:<br/>
 Most people think of homeschooling as &quot;schooling at home.&quot; Therefore, those<br/>
who do not do schooling at home call their practice &quot;unschooling.&quot; By that<br/>
logic, Unschooling is radical homeschooling. To me, it means, simply, no<br/>
schooling. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of the things talked about like; allowing the child to decide<br/>
&gt; what he/she watches on TV and for how long, what to eat and when,<br/>
&gt; when to go to bed, whether to brush teeth etc are, I thought,<br/>
&gt; parenting choices.  Even children who go to school have these issues.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, every family must deal with those issues individually. They are under<br/>
Parenting, not &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So if these are part of unschooling how do they learn self-<br/>
&gt; discipline, self-control and good life habits? Do you just use<br/>
&gt; natural consequences for everything?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many seem to think that if a parent sits back and has &quot;good thoughts&quot; about<br/>
their child, that the child will do what that parent imagines is the &quot;right<br/>
thing.&quot; <br/>
Such parents are kidding themselves. Get a parenting book (maybe five) if<br/>
you have no idea how to raise a kid. Parenting is not something adults are<br/>
suddenly able to do just because they have a kid. It is hard work, much like<br/>
any relationship. Your questions make it difficult to know where to start in<br/>
a serious answer. You seem to need to start pretty near the beginning.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; How does religion work with unschooling?  Do people who are devout<br/>
&gt; believers &#39;teach&#39; their children their &#39;beliefs&#39;?  If a child asks<br/>
&gt; about God do they get the parents &#39;beliefs&#39; as truth?  Same for non-<br/>
&gt; believers too? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your attitude will determine how your child responds to your religion. My<br/>
experience tells me that children who see the benefits of their parents&#39;<br/>
faith, usually respond agreeably. Those who have it stuffed down their<br/>
throats, usually don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The old testament is about rules that say, &quot;Don&#39;t&quot;  --&quot; Thou Shalt NOT....&quot;<br/>
But the new testament is more positive -- the Beatitudes -- &quot;Blessed are the<br/>
peacemakers,&quot; etc.<br/>
The new testament shows how far people came the period that the Bible<br/>
describes. It was a period of great self-examination and discovery.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or do you say &quot;this is what I believe and some people<br/>
&gt; believe such and such, and in your life the choice is yours what you<br/>
&gt; choose to believe&quot; or something like that?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sounds most agreeable to me. That will be true no matter what we do, so<br/>
it seems best to start out with that attitude.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Contrary to what you thought my post conveyed I have been parenting <br/>
for 13 years and don&#39;t need parenting help from you just unschooling <br/>
help!!  <br/>
The object of my post was to determine whether unschoolers <br/>
incorporate the philosophy into all areas of their lives or whether <br/>
they pick and choose what works for them.<br/>
To me allowing a 3 year old to watch adult movies and not clean their <br/>
teeth for a month is just bad parenting not unschooling. <br/>
Concerning parenting books, I have read too many to count and have <br/>
found many &#39;so-called experts&#39; don&#39;t know what the hell they&#39;re <br/>
talking about!!  <br/>
I found most of my learning occurred through interaction with my <br/>
children.  They showed me what compassion, gratitude, love, honesty, <br/>
patience, understanding, limits, personal boundaries, beauty and <br/>
courage (just to name a few) really were. They give me these gifts <br/>
every moment of everyday I spend with them.  They encourage me to be <br/>
the best person I can be (Ned, it&#39;s called self-awareness and <br/>
emotional intelligence - have you heard of it? :) and I do the same <br/>
for them.  I am honoured <br/>
that they are in my life everyday.<br/>
So, dear subtle Ned, don&#39;t fret that you need to coach me in how to <br/>
be a mother.  Wouldn&#39;t want to tear you away from your war on school<br/>
:(<br/>
