<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763536689">Juli, I totally agree with your stance on this.  I don&#39;t want my kids <br/>
playing at homes with guns, either, and the situation you describe does sound <br/>
like a potential danger.  My husband used to think it might make people think <br/>
weirdly of us for me to ask if they have any guns before I think of my kids <br/>
going there but I figure that the people we would like our kids to be around <br/>
won&#39;t mind and may even feel good about us asking because they may have <br/>
similar concerns.<br/>
