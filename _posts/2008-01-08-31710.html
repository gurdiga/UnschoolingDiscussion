<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412318397">Hi Tami,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have quite a bit of experience with this!  Of my 4 sons, 2 are extroverts,<br/>
1 is an introvert (Jury is still out on the 2 year old!).  I am an<br/>
introvert, my parents are both introverts! My husband, on the other hand, is<br/>
an extrovert!  Now, here is the interesting thing: introverts and extroverts<br/>
are personality types, and both are equally okay!!  In a nutshell, an<br/>
extrovert is someone who gains energy from being around a lot of people; an<br/>
introvert is someone who gains energy from being by his/herself or with very<br/>
few people (one or two).  For example, if my family goes to a social<br/>
gathering my husband and two of my sons are completely charged by the<br/>
experience!  My other son and me, on the other hand, need some serious &quot;down<br/>
time&quot;.  It is exhausting for me!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Being an introvert is not the same as being shy.  Both my husband and I were<br/>
shy as children.  For me, it wasn&#39;t an issue.  I preferred to be alone, or<br/>
with just one other person (a friend or playmate, or child of one of my<br/>
mother&#39;s friends).  For my husband, this was a big issue.  He wanted to be<br/>
around others and have lots of friends, but didn&#39;t know how to make friends<br/>
and had some fear in that space.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would say that if your son doesn&#39;t seem bothered by the lack of<br/>
friendships, or if he seems to be content by himself, then it really isn&#39;t a<br/>
problem.  You do say that he seems lonely.  Is he really lonely?  Or is that<br/>
more of something that you (or your family) fears because of our societies<br/>
belief that all kids should have a bunch of other kids around them in order<br/>
to be &quot;normal&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If your son is happier one on one, and is an introvert-honor that about him.<br/>
Growing up, my mom was always pushing me to &quot;make friends&quot; with this bunch<br/>
of kids or that bunch of kids.  I really hated that!  In fact I ended up<br/>
thinking there was something wrong with me.  I was always envious of my<br/>
extroverted friends and thought I was supposed to be more like them.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t until my 30s (and a conversation with a great life coach!) that I<br/>
learned that being an introvert wasn&#39;t a bad thing-it was who I was!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope this is helpful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013486803">Hi Tami,<br/>
<br/>
         I wanted to share a story with you about our Shy Daughter.<br/>
<br/>
         When she was between the ages of 2 and 5, she would not leave <br/>
my side. She would hardly speak to anybody, that included me. The only <br/>
males she would speak to were her 2 brothers and her father only when <br/>
she had to. So off to PS she went. She was in PS for 4 years. Never out <br/>
grew her shyness. She had one or two friends at school but was still <br/>
very shy, even at home. <br/>
<br/>
         We have been homeschooling/unschooling her for almost 2 years <br/>
now, and she never shuts up. She is always talking, dancing around, and <br/>
just having fun. Just give your son so time. He too might come out of <br/>
his shell one day like our daughter did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295601585">Hi, Tami<br/>
<br/>
That sounds a bit like my daughter and son. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter, who&#39;s now 22 and living away from home, is one of the <br/>
most outgoing, social people I&#39;ve ever known. She&#39;s always made <br/>
friends easily and has plenty of them. My 12 year old home ed son, on <br/>
the other hand, has just a few friends that he spends time with only <br/>
very occasionally and is otherwise happy to be at home enjoying his <br/>
own company.<br/>
<br/>
To me, it&#39;s no mystery.<br/>
<br/>
The circumstances of my daughter&#39;s &#39;formative years&#39; provided her <br/>
with opportunities every day to connect with others and develop <br/>
rewarding relationships. The circumstances of my son&#39;s formative <br/>
years provided him with very few opportunities to connect with others <br/>
never mind develop relationships of any kind. Won&#39;t go into the <br/>
complicated details! Who knows really how experiences come together <br/>
in the mind of the pre-verbal child to form their perceptions of <br/>
themselves and the world they live in, but, as I see it, both of my <br/>
children have followed the preferences that have made them happy - <br/>
those preferences just happen to be, to the outside observer, in <br/>
particularly striking contrast.<br/>
<br/>
I was painfully timid and shy myself when I was a boy. Wouldn&#39;t speak <br/>
unless I was spoken to and, even then, would say as little as <br/>
possible before escaping back into my shell. But my son isn&#39;t like <br/>
that. He&#39;s quiet and keeps himself to himself, as the saying goes, <br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t call him painfully timid and shy. He prefers his own <br/>
company to the company of others. Well, so do I, so I don&#39;t see that <br/>
as any big deal. But his demeanour definitely *is* very noticeably <br/>
different to that of his sister. And, yes, when I was my son&#39;s age, I <br/>
would certainly have envied the ease with which my daughter makes <br/>
friends and her popularity wherever she goes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I did give up being timid and shy a long time ago. In fact, if <br/>
you met me now, you might well find me rather &#39;loud&#39;. I am. But I <br/>
still prefer my own company most of the time. That hasn&#39;t changed. <br/>
Will it change for my son? Maybe, maybe not. It&#39;s his choice. No <br/>
human behaviour is ever written in stone.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, he&#39;s happy. When I ask him about socialising, making <br/>
friends, he says he&#39;s fine with the way things are and his body <br/>
language tells me he genuinely is. When he&#39;s been playing World of <br/>
Warcraft all day and I ask him what kind of day he&#39;s having, he&#39;ll <br/>
say &quot;Great!&quot; and his body language tells me that&#39;s an honest answer <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was conventionally schooled and was outstandingly <br/>
successful. Sometimes, I look at all her wonderful school reports, <br/>
her &#39;certificates of merit&#39;, the photos of her as Dux of the Year at <br/>
high school, her graduation, the whole collection of academic <br/>
memorabilia, and I look at the solitary certificate of merit my son <br/>
got in kindergarten before he asked to be taken out of school, and <br/>
I scratch my head and wonder about &#39;what might have been&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
But strange things happen when you want your children to be happy and <br/>
choose to work backwards from that. You can discover roads less <br/>
travelled that turn out to be the most fabulous of adventures.<br/>
<br/>
All I know is that I&#39;m very proud of both of my children and I&#39;m very <br/>
happy that they are who they choose to be. <br/>
<br/>

bashful, shy... He has no <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried joining local homeschool groups, doing library story <br/>
time, etc., but he gets <br/>
&gt; overwhelmed in large groups and just sorta shuts down.  He seems to <br/>
do much better <br/>

about &quot;socialization&quot;, because I know for <br/>
&gt; most home/unschoolers that&#39;s a non-issue. But I am starting to <br/>
worry just a little about <br/>
&gt; my son.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose if we didn&#39;t have the influence of his older brother, it <br/>

realize that...that he was just fine as is. My anxiety about the situation<br/>

us if I didn&#39;t stress out a little about it. It took me some time (and<br/>
support from brilliant minds like on this list) to let all that go. Right<br/>
now we have a beautiful relationship. We are very different from each other,<br/>

uncomfortable in the types of social situations that these family <br/>
members think would be good for him. My dh was such a boy, and I can <br/>
tell you that being forced into them didn&#39;t help him. He threw up <br/>
every morning before school! This went on for a while, then he &quot;got <br/>
hardened to it&quot; (his words), but he continued to detest every moment <br/>
of school and the &quot;socialization&quot; that went with it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to imagine that your relatives really want that sort of <br/>
experience for your son!<br/>
<br/>
Your alternative is to love him as he is, go at his pace, and trust - <br/>
just trust - that all is and will continue to be well. The longing <br/>
that you are seeing might simply be a sign of him working this out. I <br/>
understand your desire to spare him pain, but maybe, for him, this <br/>
*is* a painful choice. Building up to the moment when he chooses the <br/>
fun-with-friends over his comfort zone might be one of his life&#39;s <br/>
toughest challenges. I don&#39;t see any benefit to your rushing it, even <br/>
in the most gentle of ways.<br/>
<br/>
For your encouragement, I can tell you that my older daughter, now <br/>
15, was similarly cautious when she was young. She&#39;s still a quiet <br/>
sort, but she has numerous friends and (gleefully) travels alone to <br/>
friends&#39; houses all over the region. And every step of her journey <br/>
from &quot;overly&quot; attached toddler to confident and self-assured young <br/>
woman has been at her pace. She&#39;s really more sociable than my bubbly <br/>
younger daughter these days, with my apparent extrovert more inclined <br/>
toward staying home. You just never know.<br/>
<br/>
Your son may never be an extrovert - many people are not - but he&#39;ll <br/>
probably gain more comfort with interacting with people. I think your <br/>
son simply needs time and acceptance and some Very Small Steps (as he <br/>
chooses).<br/>

in elementary school (though she lived down the street and I already  <br/>

Providing opportunities -- really, in the case of school, forcing  <br/>
opportunities -- on a child who doesn&#39;t want them and would avoid  <br/>
them if given the chance, doesn&#39;t turn that child into one who wants  <br/>
those opportunities. It gives them plenty of first hand experience in  <br/>
why they want to avoid them.<br/>
<br/>
Still after all these years (I&#39;m 51) being in a large group of people  <br/>
I don&#39;t know emotionally throws me back into school where I feel like  <br/>
everyone is staring at me. It&#39;s really horrid. Oddly, I&#39;m not really  <br/>
shy. I&#39;m just naturally not a talker. I never had problems giving  <br/>
presentations at work. Didn&#39;t have any problems at the conference I  <br/>
spoke at.<br/>
<br/>
 From what my husband said of his experience in school, he also felt  <br/>
awkward, always avoiding calling attention to himself. He&#39;s an  <br/>
introvert too but much more comfortable with people which didn&#39;t come  <br/>
out until well after high school. Now you would never guess he was  <br/>
awkward in school.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is also an introvert but she&#39;s much more like my husband  <br/>
is now and probably has a dozen friends. (When she was younger,  <br/>
though, she only had a couple. I asked her about finding ways to make  <br/>
new friends and she said she didn&#39;t want more friends, just more time  <br/>
to spend with those she had. (Unfortunately none of them lived  <br/>
close!)) By not being forced into social situations that made her  <br/>
uncomfortable she&#39;s gotten to be who she is from the beginning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488888975">Hi Tami,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to echo the comments of others, especially Karen, about  <br/>
honoring your son&#39;s needs.  In our family of 5, there is definitely a  <br/>
range of intro/extrovert personalities, and although I do not refer  <br/>
to ourselves by those terms in day to day conversation, learning more  <br/>
about them has definitely informed me.  Apparently there are some  <br/>
very good books about the nature of introvert personalities and how  <br/>
they can best be nurtured and supported.  I simply found the  <br/>
definitions in one of the books I read, I think Raising Your Spirited  <br/>
Child, and found them to be thought provoking and helpful.<br/>
<br/>
For me, after discovering the terminology, and how it might apply to  <br/>
my children (a little light switch of awareness being turned on in my  <br/>
head, so to speak), it has been really cool to see how awareness of  <br/>
preferences and communication of those preferences breeds more choice  <br/>
and more communication.  For example, my oldest does not prefer large  <br/>
group activities, and she takes a long time to &quot;adjust&quot; to people,  <br/>
her terminology.  Learning this helped me to focus more on discussing  <br/>
activities beforehand, so that we could figure out which ones might  <br/>
be appealing and which ones wouldn&#39;t.  Through this extra  <br/>
communication, I think she has developed a habit of being aware of  <br/>
which situations feel right and which don&#39;t.  This sounds really  <br/>
technical, but it isn&#39;t, just plain talk about what she thinks and  <br/>
feels, at a child&#39;s level.  Over time, though, it has led to a very  <br/>
concrete ability on her part to say what she wants, which seems like  <br/>
a good thing to me.  This same awareness seems to be developing in my  <br/>
younger two as they grow and mature.  Does your son feel comfortable  <br/>
talking about what he wants and doesn&#39;t want?  At five, he may not  <br/>
articulate himself in adult language, but should be able to express  <br/>
preferences that can give you an indication.  Shutting down at a  <br/>
library/playgroup event may be an opportunity to ask him a few light  <br/>
questions.  Also, what do you define as shutting down?  Is he an  <br/>
intense observer, by any chance?  I don&#39;t have one, but have known  <br/>
one, and it is pretty common, I think, and not an indication of  <br/>
shutting down in any way, in fact could be quite the opposite.  If  <br/>
he&#39;s at the activity hanging on you and asking to go home, that would  <br/>
be a different story altogether.<br/>
<br/>
There is not that much of an age difference between your older son  <br/>
and younger, and so while he may see the new friendships of his older  <br/>
brother and feel some envy, he might also still be really attached to  <br/>
the &quot;nest,&quot; so social needs may not have surfaced which need to be  <br/>
met outside of the home at his initiation.  Also, having always had  <br/>
an older sibling, if his older brother has been providing the social  <br/>
impetus, then maybe he just needs more practice doing this on his  <br/>
own.  It&#39;s got to be an adjustment to not have his brother around,  <br/>
and to be placing social expectations on him in addition to that  <br/>
could be overly burdensome.  If the older brother is having lots of  <br/>
playdates, is it possible for the younger brother to participate to  <br/>
some degree when he desires?  Do they get along well enough at home  <br/>
that the older brother would be willing to include his younger  <br/>
brother sometimes, enough to fill the younger brother&#39;s cup, but not  <br/>
so much that it feels intrusive to the older?  If the younger brother  <br/>
is excluded, is it because the relationship is weak to begin with, or  <br/>
is it because the older brother is getting pressure from his  <br/>
schoolmate to do so?  To me it would seem totally natural to have all  <br/>
of the kids play together and whoever wants to participate can,  <br/>
whoever doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t, but perhaps that is not what is happening,  <br/>
which would be, to me, an opportunity for thought and possible  <br/>
discussion between yourself and each of the boys.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not new to this group, but took a &quot;year off&quot; from it while our  <br/>
&gt; life was going thru some<br/>
&gt; changes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m now a firm believer in finding and doing what&#39;s best for the  <br/>
&gt; individual, and what&#39;s good<br/>
&gt; for one child may not be good for another one. Yeah, it seems  <br/>
&gt; intuitive now, but this past<br/>
&gt; year was...one of the biggest challenges of my life trying to learn  <br/>
&gt; this. As a result of this<br/>
&gt; &quot;new&quot; understanding, my oldest son (6.5 yrs) now goes to a charter  <br/>
&gt; school and its working<br/>
&gt; out great for his specific needs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am still unschooling my younger son and I love it, but I&#39;m  <br/>
&gt; struggling with some questions<br/>
&gt; regarding him. His older brother is an extrovert and extremely  <br/>
&gt; outgoing. Everybody is his<br/>
&gt; best friend, and now that he&#39;s in a school environment, he has a  <br/>
&gt; lot of friends. My other<br/>
&gt; son, however, is the exact opposite. He is very introverted,  <br/>
&gt; bashful, shy... He has no<br/>
&gt; friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried joining local homeschool groups, doing library story  <br/>
&gt; time, etc., but he gets<br/>
&gt; overwhelmed in large groups and just sorta shuts down. He seems to  <br/>
&gt; do much better<br/>
&gt; one-on-one, so I&#39;ve tried organizing play dates at our home or  <br/>
&gt; places around town with<br/>
&gt; just one other &quot;friend&quot;, but he doesnt seem to want to have  <br/>
&gt; anything to do with that either.<br/>
&gt; He seems very lonely (even tho he also has a younger sister at  <br/>
&gt; home), and seems envious<br/>
&gt; of his older brother and his friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On top of this, I have a few family memebers who are pressuring me  <br/>
&gt; about his<br/>
&gt; &quot;socialization&quot;. I have never been one to worry about  <br/>
&gt; &quot;socialization&quot;, because I know for<br/>
&gt; most home/unschoolers that&#39;s a non-issue. But I am starting to  <br/>
&gt; worry just a little about<br/>
&gt; my son.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suppose if we didn&#39;t have the influence of his older brother, it  <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t even occur to me<br/>
&gt; to worry about him. But when I watch him watch his brother and  <br/>
&gt; friends so longingly, it<br/>
&gt; makes my heart ache. Both my husband and I were also extremely shy  <br/>
&gt; growing up, and it<br/>
&gt; just hurts to see him going thru similar things. But, of course, we  <br/>
&gt; were forced to go to<br/>
&gt; school, which made it worse in so many ways, but eventually we both  <br/>
&gt; did find a friend or<br/>
&gt; two that way...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone have any thoughts on this? I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m looking for...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

she was a teen.  She was going to a program, but she didn&#39;t know  <br/>
anyone else there in advance and she flew alone, and had raised the  <br/>
money to do it.  She went to college pretty far away, too.  But when  <br/>
she was four and five and would come to our house, she wouldn&#39;t leave  <br/>
her mother&#39;s lap at first.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some such kids enjoy playing near kids they didn&#39;t really   <br/>
need to &quot;meet,&quot; like at parks or &quot;playlands&quot; (Burger King or  <br/>
McDonald&#39;s play places).  Watching other children, being near them,  <br/>
interacting just minimally, can be good.  Moms shouldn&#39;t press them  <br/>
to learn names or &quot;go over there.&quot;  Just let them be there without  <br/>

<br/>
My dd(4) rarely talks to someone she doesn&#39;t know and always backs away when<br/>
someone approaches her.  Gatherings for her can be awful.  She has to sit<br/>
back and survey the situation before she will have anything to do with<br/>

that over this past holiday, but I recognized what she was going through and<br/>

<br/>
You may want to consider reading the book &quot;raising your spirited child&quot;.  It<br/>
has quite a bit of good info about introvert vs extrovert.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me for my judgement, you sound like an extrovert.  You simply cannot<br/>
understand why your son needs/wants to be alone.  My dh and dd(7) are like<br/>
that too.  If I get a moment to myself (like when I need to go upstairs and<br/>
meditate) they only leave me alone for a short time (once I told dh I needed<br/>
20 minutes.  He came up after 15 because he just NEEDED to tell me<br/>
something).<br/>
<br/>
I would be careful about some of the judgements you are passing on to your<br/>
son.  You said...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He seems very lonely (even tho he also has a younger sister at home), and<br/>
seems envious of his older brother and his friends.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if that is your perception or if it is really his feelings.  I<br/>
think probably the earlier. I loved playing alone when I was a kid.<br/>
Thankfully I had an introverted mother who understood that is what I needed.<br/>
Maybe that is what HE needs.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me that you need to do a little more accepting of your son the<br/>
way he is and stop putting him in situations that are uncomfortable to him.<br/>

In our family, my husband is introverted and I&#39;m not.  I bugged the  <br/>
heck out of him the first few years we were together, just going in  <br/>
the garage or wherever he was trying in vain to be by himself and  <br/>
talking to him, seeing if he was mad at me because he was ignoring  <br/>
me, seeing if he wanted to go somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been together nearly thirty years now (a few months shy of  <br/>
that) and I&#39;m glad I learned more about Keith&#39;s needs for alone time,  <br/>
because one of our children is quite that way and the other two  <br/>
aren&#39;t.  So it&#39;s good, too, that Keith wasn&#39;t surprised by those  <br/>
suddenly-noisy two.<br/>
<br/>
Before I had kids someone was on Phil Donahue, I think, saying that  <br/>
the most difficult problem in parenting was if two introverted  <br/>
parents had an extrovert child, or vice versa.  The parents would  <br/>
spend lots of energy thinking there was something wrong with that  <br/>
child, and treating him in all kinds of irritating ways.<br/>

Unschooling can allow for a child to make his or her own choices  <br/>
about when and where and how.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m not new to this group, but took a &quot;year off&quot; from it while our<br/>
&gt;  &gt; life was going thru some<br/>
&gt;  &gt; changes.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m now a firm believer in finding and doing what&#39;s best for the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; individual, and what&#39;s good<br/>
&gt;  &gt; for one child may not be good for another one. Yeah, it seems<br/>
&gt;  &gt; intuitive now, but this past<br/>
&gt;  &gt; year was...one of the biggest challenges of my life trying to learn<br/>
&gt;  &gt; this. As a result of this<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &quot;new&quot; understanding, my oldest son (6.5 yrs) now goes to a charter<br/>
&gt;  &gt; school and its working<br/>
&gt;  &gt; out great for his specific needs.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I am still unschooling my younger son and I love it, but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;  &gt; struggling with some questions<br/>
&gt;  &gt; regarding him. His older brother is an extrovert and extremely<br/>
&gt;  &gt; outgoing. Everybody is his<br/>
&gt;  &gt; best friend, and now that he&#39;s in a school environment, he has a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; lot of friends. My other<br/>
&gt;  &gt; son, however, is the exact opposite. He is very introverted,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; bashful, shy... He has no<br/>
&gt;  &gt; friends.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve tried joining local homeschool groups, doing library story<br/>
&gt;  &gt; time, etc., but he gets<br/>
&gt;  &gt; overwhelmed in large groups and just sorta shuts down. He seems to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; do much better<br/>
&gt;  &gt; one-on-one, so I&#39;ve tried organizing play dates at our home or<br/>
&gt;  &gt; places around town with<br/>
&gt;  &gt; just one other &quot;friend&quot;, but he doesnt seem to want to have<br/>
&gt;  &gt; anything to do with that either.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; He seems very lonely (even tho he also has a younger sister at<br/>
&gt;  &gt; home), and seems envious<br/>
&gt;  &gt; of his older brother and his friends.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; On top of this, I have a few family memebers who are pressuring me<br/>
&gt;  &gt; about his<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &quot;socialization&quot;. I have never been one to worry about<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &quot;socialization&quot;, because I know for<br/>
&gt;  &gt; most home/unschoolers that&#39;s a non-issue. But I am starting to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; worry just a little about<br/>
&gt;  &gt; my son.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I suppose if we didn&#39;t have the influence of his older brother, it<br/>
&gt;  &gt; wouldn&#39;t even occur to me<br/>
&gt;  &gt; to worry about him. But when I watch him watch his brother and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; friends so longingly, it<br/>
&gt;  &gt; makes my heart ache. Both my husband and I were also extremely shy<br/>
&gt;  &gt; growing up, and it<br/>
&gt;  &gt; just hurts to see him going thru similar things. But, of course, we<br/>
&gt;  &gt; were forced to go to<br/>
&gt;  &gt; school, which made it worse in so many ways, but eventually we both<br/>
&gt;  &gt; did find a friend or<br/>
&gt;  &gt; two that way...<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Anyone have any thoughts on this? I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m looking for...<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091614595">-=-Reading this kind of made me laugh at myself. I am an extremely  <br/>
shy extrovert. I love being around people all the time. Yet I am so  <br/>
shy that I just won&#39;t usually talk to them or interact, but I love  <br/>
people. I am getting better because I am forcing myself to talk.<br/>
My husband is the one with great people skills. He does wonderfully  <br/>
teaching large groups of people (part of his old job) being around  <br/>
big crowds, etc.. When he goes somewhere, he quickly becomes the  <br/>
center of attention. (unlike me hiding in the corner!) Yet, he would  <br/>
rather be alone.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is really interesting.  My husband has an &quot;on&quot; that he can use  <br/>
in public and be very outgoing and persuasive and organizational, and  <br/>
then when he gets home he has to turn it off.  I used to take it  <br/>
personally, but now I don&#39;t.  He uses it at work sometimes, and  <br/>
they&#39;ll fly him places to make presentations or go to meetings even  <br/>
though he looks like a hippie compared to the military-looking  <br/>
engineer types he mostly works with, because he&#39;s good in meetings  <br/>
and groups.  But when they&#39;re in other cities, he doesn&#39;t want to go  <br/>
to dinner with the other guys much or socialize.  He goes back to the  <br/>
hotel and watches TV.  Or when they were in souther California and  <br/>
were going to meet at the Getty museum, he never found the rest of  <br/>
the group, but he loved seeing the museum by himself.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll go to a movie alone and not feel pitiful.  Me, I&#39;ve seen two  <br/>
movies alone and was so distracted by the discomfort of being by  <br/>
myself there that I could hardly watch the movie.  The Color of  <br/>
Purple (where I sat right between two strangers at a theater that no  <br/>
longer exists) and Othello (where I sat alone, and discovered on exit  <br/>
that two of my friends were there and I still wish I had seen them  <br/>
before the movie started so I wouldn&#39;t have been alone).<br/>
<br/>
Is that too much trauma for movie watching?  Maybe.  But my husband  <br/>
has a hard time imagining it.  And I have a hard time thinking he  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t rather have me or one of the kids go with him to the movies.<br/>
<br/>
Let shy kids let you know what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
When I think about &quot;socialization,&quot; I think about pioneer families  <br/>
and ranch families before automobiles and radios and phones.  Maybe  <br/>
they saw other kids at church sometimes.  Maybe they saw cousins or  <br/>
neighbors a few times a year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745737682">Hi Tami,<br/>
<br/>
i normally only lurk on this list but the description of your  <br/>
children reflected my own experience closely... so despite many rich  <br/>
responses to your post already i thought id throw in something also.<br/>
<br/>
i was the youngest of three. My older brother was very outgoing � a  <br/>
joker and very sporty, he was well known to children and teachers alike.<br/>
<br/>
i was not  :)<br/>
<br/>
My language was apparently relatively &quot;delayed&quot; (by external  <br/>
measures, not mine obviously) and my parents theory in hindsight was  <br/>
that it was because i had little interest in talking to people.<br/>
<br/>
i went to school, however one of the things that &quot;defined&quot; me was the  <br/>
way my parents accepted who i was and supported me. For example in my  <br/>
family we often had relatives and guests over at our house (large  <br/>
indian family). I tended to spend most of my time in my room or,  <br/>
during one period, if in the &quot;family room&quot; set up a large cardboard  <br/>
box to play in and get some space to myself.<br/>
<br/>
While this may have disturbed many, my parents responded by buying a  <br/>
tent and set it up in the corner of the family room so i could be  <br/>
around the action and in my own space also :D<br/>
<br/>
I wish i was unschooled to allow this nurturing approach to have  <br/>
occurred more holistically however even in the context of school my  <br/>
parent&#39;s acceptance allowed me to grow and connect with people more  <br/>
on my own terms, in my own time. It was generally the expectation of  <br/>
school peers and culture (birthday parties, socials etc) that i found  <br/>
challenging, not my situation per se. As far as i remember i was  <br/>
quite content when not feeling like i had to live up to something.<br/>
<br/>
It was not until some time in my early twenties that i started to  <br/>
value connection with broader community & people much more and made  <br/>
the necessary shifts around my hermit nature accordingly. Today  <br/>
people that know me would not believe that i was such a recluse...  <br/>
most would describe me as outgoing and quite &quot;socially capable&quot;. My  <br/>
brother is too... we just took very different paths (and still do).<br/>

&gt; understand why your son needs/wants to be alone. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s so sad is that I *am* an introvert and I can *totally* relate to my son. If I don&#39;t get <br/>
time to myself each day, I start to feel like I am losing my mind.  I get up at 5 am every day <br/>
just to sit and have a cup of coffee while the house is silent, so that I can just BE for a <br/>
while before the day starts. But my other two children are so extroverted... they talk at me <br/>
all day long and are always &quot;on&quot;. Sometimes I worry that my son gets &quot;lost&quot; in the midst of <br/>
the other two.  And when its just he and I alone (which is rare) and we each do our own <br/>
thing, I feel like there is something wrong, because he&#39;s not needing to talk at/with me <br/>
and follow me all over the place. Does that make sense?  So even tho I&#39;m an introvert in a <br/>
house full of extroverts, I forget that my son shares the same characteristics. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

considerate.  But..my husband and mother-in-law are always putting doubts into my <br/>

That&#39;s very sweet!<br/>
<br/>
For years we had a weekly park meeting, and sometimes there were kids  <br/>
who preferred to be in the car for part of the time, and all the moms  <br/>
were cool about it because (I think because) it was originally a La  <br/>
Leche League based group, and then became an unschooling group, so  <br/>
pressures were minimal.  And we&#39;d kinda keep the other kids away from  <br/>
the cars too.  If they wanted to invite a kid out, that was fine, but  <br/>
mostly we&#39;d say &quot;He&#39;ll come out when he&#39;s done with that chapter/ <br/>
level/drawing&quot; or whatever, and they did!<br/>
<br/>
I love the image of the tent in the room.<br/>
<br/>
There are a fair number of examples of years-ago buildings with a  <br/>
teeny window from an upstairs bedroom into the great hall or  <br/>
ballroom.  Nowadays I suppose that might be video security cameras.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;   But for someone to get to watch a while before deciding to join  <br/>
seems sensible and civilized.<br/>

  Hi Tami,<br/>
   <br/>
                Sorry about the last post. I hit send before I was ready. I am not really good at putting my thoughts into words. but here goes.<br/>
   <br/>
                I can relate to the Mother in-law thing. I have always worried about what other people say or think. I have missed out on a lot in life because of being worried what others might think. NOT anymore.... I have found that you can&#39;t live your life, when you are living your life for somebody else.I still find myself slipping backwards sometimes, but boy it is great to be alive....<br/>

If one lives her life to be a good mother to her children, it&#39;s a  <br/>
total two-for-one deal.<br/>
If someone continues to be her mother&#39;s child after she&#39;s a mother,  <br/>
that can cause problems for the REAL children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805016489">Roxana has never wanted a lot of friends. I was so different and her  <br/>
older sister was so different, it was always hard for me to believe  <br/>
she was absolutely fine with an in-person friend or two plus a zillion  <br/>
online friends, and I&#39;ve always made an effort to create social  <br/>
situations for her to make more friends, but she just really didn&#39;t  <br/>
want them. Now she&#39;s 20 and she is perfectly sociable and has some  <br/>
friends - but they still aren&#39;t the kinds of intense hang-out-together- <br/>
almost-every-day kinds of friendships I had at her age. She&#39;s a little  <br/>
shy, a bit reserved until she feels comfortable with people. She chose  <br/>
to stay home on New Year&#39;s Eve and hang out with her younger sister,  <br/>
rather than go to a party at a friend&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
But - she&#39;s going to France for 3 months with a group of 40 or so  <br/>
other college students and a couple of professors. She leaves Feb 8th.  <br/>
She&#39;s scared, but she is going. And a couple of the girls already  <br/>
asked her to share a room with them - so she&#39;s looking forward to  <br/>
making friends with them.<br/>

Reminds me of a conversation I had with my son a couple of years ago <br/>
when the subject of socialisation arose. I observed that his lifestyle <br/>
was similar to that of children living in the Outback, on cattle <br/>
stations and the like sometimes hundreds of miles from the nearest <br/>

YET i still enjoy being quiet and often wish i didn&#39;t have to speak vocally. since i don&#39;t have the fear i once had...and i finally figured out its just my nature- i just truly like the quiet and that is OK.  if i would have known or been /encouraged more that this was common maybe i wouldn&#39;t have felt so misplaced. it also may (or may not) be because i&#39;m hypersensative to sound who knows.   <br/>
<br/>
my oldest son is like this. my youngest LOVES people and thrives off of activity. he is just like my husband. i enjoy their exuberance. its quite a contrasting life, although sometimes i&#39;m tired by just watching them. haha <br/>
