 </span></blockquote>Maybe I&#39;m crazy, but I am beginning to see the real value in not &quot;offering&quot; <br/>
information, whether it be in a lesson-y way or not.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, for example, my son (3) just could not wait to get his hands on <br/>
a paper airplane he had made last week.  My daughter (2) soon became curious, <br/>
and had to come over to play with the plane.  She asked me to make a plane <br/>
for her, and handed me some of the felt from her, as she calls it &quot;Arts and <br/>
Crabs Box.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I went ahead and made a plane-looking thing for her out of the felt, and <br/>
she had a heck of an unsuccessful time trying to get the thing to fly the way <br/>
her brother&#39;s plane was filing.  <br/>
<br/>
So SHE went over to my work files and pulled out a manilla folder and folded <br/>
it into a crude paper airplane all by herself.  Then she and my son just had <br/>
fun throwing the darn things around for a while, before they decided that <br/>
they wanted to use their &quot;Wizzers&quot;  (Scissors) from the &quot;Arts and Crabs Box&quot; <br/>
to see if they could make a plane that would go faster and further.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  Maybe they learned nothing from the whole episode.  But they <br/>
were having fun, and I was letting go.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I will be able to train myself to continue to do this as they <br/>
grow older, or if I am just able to do this at this point in time because <br/>
they are pre-school age and I think they need to have fun more than they need <br/>
to learn how to add and subtract.  Any thoughts?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yes!!!! THEY are so lucky to have you as their mom.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I think!!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about later - let it come, you&#39;ll be ready.<br/>
<br/>
Read Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;Book of Learning and Forgetting.&quot;<br/>
Read Peggy Kaye&#39;s &quot;Games for Learning,&quot; &quot;Games for Math,&quot; and &quot;Games for <br/>
Reading.&quot; Just use them as idea books - to stimulate your own ideas.<br/>
If you can, get a copy of Anna Kealoha&#39;s &quot;Trust the Children&quot; -- again, as an <br/>
idea book so you&#39;re ready with information and suggestions when the time <br/>
comes (it looks more schooly than you might expect from a book recommended by <br/>
unschoolers - but use it as a reference book - it is so full of interesting <br/>
information and ideas!!!). <br/>
Read &quot;The Homeschooling Book of Answers&quot; edited by Linda Dobson (you&#39;ll <br/>
recognize some of the people in it &lt;G&gt;) for its diversity of ideas.<br/>
Read Carol Narigon&#39;s &quot;Unschooling Curriculum&quot; just to get clear in your head <br/>
that what you&#39;re doing is legitimate - it is BETTER for learning. It is at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>
Read something about learning styles/ multiple intelligences  - Thomas <br/>
Armstrong or someone else.<br/>
Read something from Dawna Markova - &quot;Your Child is Smart&quot; is one.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm - and when you&#39;ve finished those &lt;G&gt; -- your kids will, by that time, <br/>
have  proven to you that unschooling works and you&#39;ll be an &quot;expert&quot; and will <br/>
be writing the books yourself &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

Kate,<br/>
I struggle with this too. My boys are 4,3 & 1. I feel like I *should <br/>
be directing their learning but I see that they learn better when <br/>
left to their own devices. They have just discovered the joys of <br/>
legos. I always wanted to show them the pictures on the boxes and <br/>
say, &quot;See? Put this one here and the yellow one here and you&#39;ll have <br/>
a rocket!&quot; Naturally they couldn&#39;t care less, lol! When I finally <br/>
stepped back and stayed out of their way they built things that I <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe. UGH! I, too, hope I can learn to back off and let <br/>
them teach themselves. No advice here, just understanding.  :-)<br/>
