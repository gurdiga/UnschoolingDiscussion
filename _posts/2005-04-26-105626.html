<div id="ygrps-yiv-410344816">When someone who allows kids to choose entertainment, friends, food and <br/>
bedtime longs to find another family that undrestands, is it fair to say they&#39;re <br/>
being too picky?  Partly it depends what they want from that other family. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids played with all kinds of other kids when they were little.  It was <br/>
easiest when the parents also had a LLL background.  It was hardest when the <br/>
other families were nit-picky controlling parents who didn&#39;t want the kids to <br/>
take their shoes off, EVER.  It was easier with a family whose kids could strip <br/>
nekkid and run in the sprinklers.  It was easier when the other kids themselves <br/>
were fine with saying, &quot;No thanks, I shouldn&#39;t have milk,&quot; or &quot;Do you have <br/>
juice?&quot; rather than having a kid show up with a list of what they couldn&#39;t or <br/>
must do.   It was easier for my kids to play where they could get a drink if <br/>
they were thirsty and some food if they were hungry, than places where the other <br/>
kids were being starved so they&#39;d clean their plates, and my kids were going <br/>
home before dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Everything counts, but rarely does everything have to count all at the same <br/>
time.<br/>
