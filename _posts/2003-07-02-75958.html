<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825465131">Yesterday a friend asked Dustin 11 if he wanted to go play mini golf and <br/>
dinner with he and his dad. I said yes. Since summer broke Dustin has been at this <br/>
boys home every day. I have hardly seen him the past two and a half weeks. <br/>
Dustin came by at 4ish to get clothes as he was sleeping over also. I asked him <br/>
to call when they where back into town (they went to beach area 30 min away).<br/>
<br/>
I called this am at 11:30 because he had not called at all last night or this <br/>
am. When the dad picked up the phone he was still sleeping. He got Dustin for <br/>
me and I asked how come he didn&#39;t call? He said they had gotten back really <br/>
late and whispered it a bit. I said Dustin I am up until 11-12. He said Mom we <br/>
didn&#39;t get back until 1 or 2!<br/>
<br/>
Now part of me feels over protective and annoyed and the other is like chill <br/>
out and speak to him when he gets home. This I will do but I wanted to call <br/>
back and tell him I would like him to come home so I could find out what would <br/>
keep them out until 1 or 2am. He is still over there.... It is a 3 minute bike <br/>
ride for him to be home.<br/>
<br/>
Would any of you take issue with your child being out until 1 or 2 am with a <br/>
non family member? I know the Dad a little, he is a former police officer and <br/>
I think if he wasn&#39;t I may be more bothered. Maybe a false sense of trust I <br/>
don&#39;t know......<br/>
Our family(Siters child and Me when I was 13 where mollested/raped. Mine is <br/>
actually going to DA this month) has had some horrid situations happen and I <br/>
think that may be part of my concern and worry.<br/>
<br/>
How much time is too much away from home. My intuition tells me he is gone <br/>
too long. <br/>
What is the opinion of others on this?<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Would being home by 11:00 really be that much better than having fun until <br/>
midnight?<br/>
<br/>
I would talk to the dad and see if he minds your son being over there so <br/>
much.  It might be much better for that family to have an additional kid.  I used <br/>
other people&#39;s kids for stimulation and peace-catalysts LOTS when Kirby and <br/>
Marty were little, and there are some families using Holly in that roll now.  <br/>
Holly was gone almost all weekend, with two different familes, overnighters.  <br/>
She would come back to change and tell me her next plans.  She was never too far <br/>
from home, and  I know the other families.<br/>
<br/>
If I had kept her home just based on an hour-count, it wouldnt make her happy <br/>
to be here, and she would have been missing something really exciting.<br/>
<br/>
Learning happens when kids are excited and happy.  I don&#39;t need all my kids&#39; <br/>
learning to happen where I am.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have hardly seen him the past two and a half weeks. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s having a really good time and the other family doesn&#39;t mind, I&#39;d let <br/>
it go.<br/>
If I really wanted to see him, I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;come home,&quot; I&#39;d find something <br/>
cool to do and take him AND the other boy to do it.  Then you see the <br/>
dynamics between them, you give the other dad a break (if you&#39;re feeling bad on his <br/>
behalf), and you&#39;re with your son, seeming cool in the eyes of his friend, and <br/>
building for the future.<br/>

doesn&#39;t matter much to me.  Of course, I, being the worrier would want to <br/>
make sure my child was safe and nothing harmful was going on.  I wonder about the <br/>
whispering, but maybe someone else was still sleeping.  If I felt perfectly <br/>
secure in the adults supervising my child, then I wouldn&#39;t worry, but I would <br/>
probably say that I missed having them around and ask if there was something <br/>
him and his friend might want to do with me.<br/>

Thank you for your reply.<br/>
I do think it helps the dad that his son has a playmate. I do feel bad and I <br/>
want to take the boys somewhere or do something. Maybe I&#39;ll take him surfing <br/>
this afternoon, Dustin likes to show others in hopes they may get into the <br/>
sport also.<br/>
I haven&#39;t had him over here yet cuz our house is getting new floors and is <br/>
always cluttered construction or not. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Laura, <br/>
<br/>
My best friend was over last nite and her son did not come. I was suprised <br/>
because, Cody(12) is like the son I will never have and he really gets upset <br/>
when they miss their Tuesday nite trip to Rhonda&#39;s. His mom said he&#39;d been <br/>
hanging out a lot lately with the neighborhood boys. (He goes to school, BTW) <br/>
Saturday nite she was waiting for him to come home from miniture golf/mini-amusement <br/>
park and at 11:15 she got worried he wasn&#39;t home yet. She went outside and <br/>
saw her neighbor who took the boys to the park and asked if the boys were back. <br/>
The mom said &quot;No, The park closes at midnite and the boys wanted to stay until <br/>
it closed.&quot; My girlfriend was glad she went outside and just happened to see <br/>
the mom, instead of calling Cody on the cell phone the boys had for an <br/>
emergency. So if the park was a 30 minute ride to get there, then I would say that <br/>
more like than not,  your son and his friend and the dad probably stayed until <br/>
closing and then maybe grabbed a bite of food. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure your own tragedy could possibly cloud your vision, but that&#39;s okay. <br/>
I&#39;d just be careful not to create something that isn&#39;t there and putting your <br/>
son on the spot. One thing about being with another family, even when it&#39;s <br/>
something fun, you lose your voice to some degree. He needs to know he has a <br/>
voice all the time regardless of where he is or who he is with.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps rather then questioning him about what happened and why didn&#39;t he <br/>
call anyway????... maybe you can discuss how you understand he was having fun and <br/>
maybe he didn&#39;t want to appear to be needing to call his mom, but that is how <br/>
your  family operates. When you get back, you call. Time is of no bearing. <br/>
Make it more about just wanting to know he was safe in a warm house and then you <br/>
can go over what they did when he gets home. <br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents, <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;What is the opinion of others on this?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t anything new I can add that hasn&#39;t already been said. Just<br/>
wanted to let you know that I too would be okay with it. I would comfort<br/>
myself by talking to the other parent so that my child wasn&#39;t over too much.<br/>
It&#39;s actually easier for me here when kids come to visit. Keeps all my kids<br/>
very busy and allows me free time. It may be the same there. I would hope<br/>
that if a family had a problem with a too frequent visitor, they would say<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
If one of my kids are out and about at that age alone, I might think<br/>
differently. Tara was out and about around that age too with friends and<br/>
always one mom around. I didn&#39;t know all the parents that well. What I<br/>
looked at was how the other kids were and how Tara was with them. Kids if<br/>
they want can find trouble anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Tara has a cousin who has mellowed quite a bit now. When she was younger, oh<br/>
man. Tara would spend weeks there during the summer. The mom, Tara&#39;s aunt,<br/>
had no problem with that. I talked to her often and knew her as my ex SIL<br/>
for years. She was someone I trusted. I started to see things when the girls<br/>
were together. Had nothing to do with the mom. Come to find out, they were<br/>
getting into more trouble under the mom&#39;s nose than anyone else thought.<br/>
Luckily Tara grew up quick. The two of them together shared a brain cell.<br/>
Now it&#39;s different. Point is the tip off was the kids with each other. Not<br/>
who they were with, where or at what time.<br/>

If Kirby makes late night decision and is where there&#39;s e-mail, he leaves me <br/>

My husband gets up really early, 4:45ish, so we try not to wake him up.<br/>

I talk to the older kids and parents myself intead of making it my kid&#39;s sole <br/>
responsibility,  too.  If I&#39;ve asked &quot;How late might it be?&quot; and &quot;where are <br/>
you going?&quot; then my kids don&#39;t feel they need to check and double check the <br/>
plan as it unfolds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443372456">Late to this discussion - too much unschooling going on, LOL.<br/>
One thing I heard in the post was that  the kids&#39; time together<br/>
was largely at the other kid&#39;s house because of remodeling etc at<br/>
home.  Unless you are (illegally) spraying lead paint or removing<br/>
asbestos - ignore the mess.<br/>
<br/>
Our 6 has a dear friend whose mother is very much like I am, but<br/>
she is 25 years younger and raising her first - I am on the<br/>
second generation.  Attachment parenting, clear vision of<br/>
respecting the human being who has come to live with us for a<br/>
while, true delight in the experience.  However, Friend&#39;s mom is<br/>
embarrassed about the fact that the house is a mess, is small,<br/>
isn&#39;t beautiful - all the stuff that when you are just starting<br/>
out assumes daunting proportions.  In comparison, having<br/>
struggled through that phase, we are blessed with a lovely home,<br/>
that I more or less easily from habit keep at a comfortable level<br/>
of creative chaos.  Friend&#39;s mom is needlessly embarrassed, but<br/>
can&#39;t quite get over it.<br/>
<br/>
Net result is that Friend spends days at a time here, to my great<br/>
delight.  However, friend and daughter both are sad not to be<br/>
able to play together with Friend&#39;s things (except the ones she<br/>
brings) or to explore the truly wonderful things that Friend&#39;s<br/>
mom does with Friend, the way they explore what I do with dd and<br/>
Friend.<br/>
<br/>
We pretty regularly pick up a spare kid for a few days or weeks<br/>
or open ended period.  I feel sorry for the kids who are never<br/>
the hosts for these adventures.  DD sees me in a whole different<br/>
way when I explain to the visitor that I think toys are important<br/>
and will of course buy (within reason) whatever is needed to make<br/>
&quot;the game&quot; work or that dinner is always together as a family,<br/>
but the other 5 :) meals of the day are served in the way that<br/>
delights those who are present, which might be at the table or in<br/>
a picnic basket or on a silver tray or set gently into the fridge<br/>
for grabbing as desired - DD lives those realities, but doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily perceive them as being the subject of a worldview<br/>
that we are each valued and cherished.  Friend especially helps<br/>
to draw them out, because the differences between her at home<br/>
life and DD&#39;s are largely ones of personal preference, not<br/>
substance - they are all together at lunch time, so it is their<br/>
sit down together meal - that kind of thing<br/>
<br/>
I have revised this last paragraph several times, but can&#39;t quite<br/>
get it to &quot;not say&quot; some things I DO NOT believe.  I am not<br/>
pushing any idea of making DD grateful for the happenstance of<br/>
having a mother with the beliefs that her mother has nor do we<br/>
live without compromises about some stuff - it&#39;s just that an<br/>
extra person adds a lot to what we see about ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
And now the Clue of the Broken Locket MUST be finished or we<br/>
simply can&#39;t go swimming first thing in the morning, which will<br/>
throw off the plan to get all the grocery shopping done tomorrow<br/>
for next week when gymnastics camp will already be stressing the<br/>
library time....not to mention having a picking party if the<br/>
blackberries get ripe as it appears will be the case by 7/6.</div>

almost came home last night cuz the boy and he dad where arguing about <br/>
everything from the highway to food. <br/>
I worried for no reason......<br/>
He came home and went back out again turns out on the way home he went and <br/>
welcomed a new family to the neighborhood and they invited him over. In the am <br/>
he is baking muffins and the other boys are making something and will have <br/>
their our pool party. Seems Unschooling is rubbing off on the neighborhood kids : )<br/>

I am so thrilled he finally has found some friends that are nice. Today was a <br/>

&lt;&lt;However, Friend&#39;s mom is<br/>
embarrassed about the fact that the house is a mess, is small,<br/>

<br/>
I was just talking to my friend about this tonight. She called to say hi and<br/>
invite us over her house for her son&#39;s birthday. We have never been to her<br/>
house. I asked if she was sure she wanted my whole clan there!!!! She made<br/>
the remark that after we came, we would understand why she always wants to<br/>
come to my house. She says her house is small and not neat. That&#39;s when I<br/>
told her I&#39;m not that kind of friend. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have only been in this house for 3 years. That&#39;s not long for us at all.<br/>
It takes us quite awhile to start and finish projects. It&#39;s mostly a money<br/>
matter so things get down a little at a time. We are still a work in<br/>
progress. At first I didn&#39;t want anyone here until the &quot;insert any word<br/>
here&quot; was finished. I finally realized that if I waited for the house to<br/>
*done* I would never have anyone over!!! The people I&#39;m friends with don&#39;t<br/>
judge by my house and I don&#39;t either. So now we always have people here.<br/>
It&#39;s easier for me with 3 and all my friends have less kids. Plus we do have<br/>
room and the pool and yard and plenty of stuff to play with.<br/>
<br/>
Still I know my kids love to go to someone else&#39;s house too. When I told<br/>
Joseph about the birthday party, he very happily exclaimed &quot;we&#39;ve never been<br/>
to Ian&#39;s house before!!!!&quot; Think he cares how big or neat it is??????<br/>
