<div><font size="2">I have recently moved from a town of 50,000+ to one of UNDER 
100. Yes, under 100 residents. The post offie boxes in the 80&#39;s(all boxes are 
free, we have no mail delivery). We homeschool 3 children, 10yob, 6yog, 5yog. We 
have found it to be VERY quiet. Other than that, we have truly enjoyed our 
peace. We are able to walk everywhere, do not fear who our children are running 
into, and weknow that our house will not be mistaken for ______ (fill in the 
space- drugs, thieves, drive by target, etc) It is great to leave the windows 
open all night, the door unlocked when we are in the back yard, or being able to 
trust the neighbor to not steal whatever is on our porch. The downside to this 
is that the nearest gas/party store is over 6 miles.&nbsp;The nearest grocery 
store is 33. We don&#39;t go to the store that often, well not anymore:) You are the 
outsider. Here, everyone is great. Friendly, will wave and talk to us, but they 
are still leary.&nbsp;Absolutely NO fast food here...We have a restuarant that 
just opened, other than that, nothing, LOL. I never want to move back to the 
big&nbsp;city, even when I am bored.. LOL Oh, btw... I come from Philadelphia 
(2,000,000) then lived in Naples, Fl(25,000); Port Huron, MI(50,000); Roscommon, 
MI(840); and now Elk Falls, KS!(80+5)</font></div>
