<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306321993"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; My question is this...how much &#39;guidance&#39; are parents allowed before we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; not really considered &#39;unschoolers?&#39;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling parents definitely guide.  But perhaps you might consider how<br/>
much you are including in the term &#39;guidance&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago, I showed my son the moves for chess.  He&#39;s learned a<br/>
lot of theory since then, and I&#39;ve guided his learning by helping him find<br/>
some chess books that are at his playing level, and spending time playing<br/>
&#39;talking-games&#39; with him (where we discuss why we&#39;d make the move we&#39;re<br/>
going to make).  I would also say that I&#39;ve guided his Opa recently in<br/>
selecting birthday gifts for my son that would be appreciated.  I reminded<br/>
him of Tim&#39;s recent interests, told him what book series Tim is currently<br/>
working his way through, and advised on what lego sets we already own.<br/>
<br/>
In neither case did I require anything.  I never told Tim that his chess<br/>
game would improve greatly if he spent a certain amount of time each day<br/>
playing, and it never, ever goes over well with grandparents if I tell them<br/>
they need to buy THIS gift.  I guide.  I don&#39;t direct.<br/>
<br/>
To me, that&#39;s unschooling.  Now, for me, it was easy to get used to not<br/>
asking that my son do certain things each day.  I just stopped asking and<br/>
that was that.  It&#39;s taken longer for me to become accustomed to not<br/>
thinking in terms of what is educational and what isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s just legos,<br/>
and if I think about it, I can easily find what&#39;s educational about playing<br/>
legos.  But I no longer do, I have become comfortable with everything being<br/>
part of my son&#39;s education.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After a while, you&#39;ve done it so many times that you just don&#39;t need to <br/>
bother stopping to convince yourself that whatever the kid is doing is <br/>
worthwhile. And when that step is reached, it is very liberating.<br/>
<br/>
I still sometimes do think about it - just because it is INTERESTING to think <br/>
about what the child is getting out of whatever she is doing.  But, with no <br/>
anxiety attached to the thoughts, no judgement, it is very different than <br/>
when just starting out unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335928717">On Saturday DH and I spent 2 hours looking at the &quot;How stuff works&quot; site.<br/>
It was kinda funny, with both of us saying &quot;Wow! did you see this?&quot; every 5<br/>
minutes.  It was almost a competition (with him on his pc and me on mine) to<br/>
find the &quot;coolest&quot; stuff first LOL  The kids were only slightly interested<br/>
and they looked a little annoyed that we were acting so silly.<br/>
They need to relax LOL<br/>
