My dad talks about  what things used to cost, but I don&#39;t remember ever bringing it to conversations.  Interesting stuff, especially for kids who are into money.<br/>

The old Coca-Cola ad reminded me about Duke University&#39;s digital advertising archive:<br/>

It is an amazing collection of print ads dating back to the early 1900s.  Some are creepy, like the ones for Lysol as a feminine hygiene product:<br/>

OH!  Two days ago Marty and his girlfriend and I were talking about  <br/>
the index, though I couldn&#39;t remember the name of it (consumer price  <br/>
index), and how it compares the price of a loaf of bread to mininum  <br/>
wage and such.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has asked me about what the motivation of a young, black,  <br/>
southern man might be to join the army during WWII.  He&#39;s involved in  <br/>
a role playing game involving an alternative history about different  <br/>
nations having different gods, and his character has been assigned as  <br/>
a soldier in the 1940&#39;s.  We talked about the G.I. Bill and upward  <br/>
mobility, and the general feeling of patriotism and fear in the U.S.  <br/>
in those days, and that the army had options (probably still does) for  <br/>
enlistees to send some or all of their paycheck to their mother or wife.<br/>
<br/>
That was just a day or two after someone had asked on this list about  <br/>
kids&#39; interests in military history.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about early-&#39;50s tract houses, built in part, it seems, to  <br/>
satisfy the promises made to veterans that they could get a loan to  <br/>
buy a home.  We lived in a 1952 tract house when my kids were little-- <br/>
one that my husband&#39;s parents bought in the late 50&#39;s.  His dad had  <br/>
been a recon pilot in the Pacific.  My dad was a motor-pool sergeant  <br/>
in Germany during the occupation.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about the prices of houses and cars and how much it went up  <br/>
in the 1970&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The site linked before has an image of a Continental Congress coin.   <br/>
It had never occurred to me that there might be such a thing.  It has  <br/>
a sun, a sundial, and says &quot;mind your business&quot; (not the same as &quot;mind  <br/>
your OWN business...&quot;) :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728990843">Those links do lead back to some wonderful old stuff.  Holly and I  <br/>
were looking at this one:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/protfam.prfad02311/pg.1/">http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/protfam.prfad02311/pg.1/</a><br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t have the article.  I wish they did!  But it was called &quot;Do  <br/>
War Toys Hurt Your Children?&quot; and promised to have both sides of the  <br/>
argument.<br/>
What it DOES have is a little boy dressed in cowboy gear, looking at  <br/>
himself in the mirror, or as Holly said, &quot;Practicing his bad-ass  <br/>
face.  Practicing intimidation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The photo was published in January 1957.  I was four then, and I had a  <br/>
Dale Evans outfit.  It had a fringed skirt and matching vest, a hat  <br/>
kind like that boy&#39;s hat in the photo, and a gunbelt with two guns,  <br/>
like his.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve been watching the series &quot;Carnivale&quot; via netflix, which is set during the 1930s and it has sparked some conversations about how much things cost as well as the changing nature of language. It took us all a few weeks to figure out what a &quot;sawbuck&quot; was, for instance ($5), and we ended up going to the internet for &quot;two bits&quot; (25c) and &quot;geek&quot; - not a monetary term but a description of a particular carnival act involving biting heads off chickens. George knew that, but I didn&#39;t and the kids and I weren&#39;t sure we believed him until we looked it up. The show has been an interesting conversation starter for sure! <br/>

I&#39;m not sure if this is up Marty&#39;s alley, but one of my favorite short stories, James Baldwin&#39;s &quot;Sonny&#39;s Blues&quot; touches on the above beautifully (the brother is from NY, but the family is originally from the south):<br/>

<br/>
My first exposure to Lysol was the small dark brown bottle of concentrate in<br/>
my mother&#39;s pantry with the douche bag (which I also did not understand its<br/>
use).   That was in the 50s and early 60s.<br/>
<br/>
That pantry also held Epson Salts, Mineral Oil, Baker&#39;s Hair Tonic, Baking<br/>
Soda, the blue Milk of Magnesia bottle.....all sorts of sights and smells.<br/>

For some background, Marty might look into &quot;The Great Migration&quot;<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_%28African_American%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_%28African_American%29</a>&gt;that<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve read &quot;The Promised Land&quot; (which is cited in the article) and really<br/>
found it enlightening.<br/>
<br/>
More pertinent for him would be &quot;The Second Great<br/>

wiki page again<br/>
<br/>
It is a fascinating (to me, at least) bit of history that I didn&#39;t learn<br/>
about in school.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a site that has some interesting facts: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lwfaam.net/ww2/">http://www.lwfaam.net/ww2/</a><br/>
<br/>
I found this at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-AfricanAmericansinthMltry.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-AfricanAmericansinthMltry.html</a>  (this<br/>
site also gives a brief history of African Americans in all the wars) :<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At the outbreak of World War II, America reverted to its practice of<br/>
turning to African Americans when it needed more troops. In 1940,<br/>
President Franklin<br/>
D. Roosevelt &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-RooseveltFranklinD.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-RooseveltFranklinD.html</a>&gt;appointed<br/>
Col. Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., to be the army&#39;s first black<br/>
brigadier general, and opened the Army Air Corps to black pilots. These<br/>
“Black Eagles,” including Davis&#39;s son, Benjamin O. Davis,<br/>
Jr.&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-DavisBenjaminOSr.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-DavisBenjaminOSr.html</a>&gt;,<br/>
who trained at Tuskeegee, Alabama, served in all‐black units. In 1941, black<br/>
labor leader A. Philip<br/>
Randolph&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-RandolphAPhilip.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-RandolphAPhilip.html</a>&gt;threatened<br/>
a protest march on Washington for equal opportunity in the<br/>
defense workforce and the military. Civil rights activist Bayard<br/>
Rustin&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-RustinBayard.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-RustinBayard.html</a>&gt;and<br/>
Black Muslim leader Elijah Muhammad dramatized such concerns by going<br/>
to<br/>
prison.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the 900,000 blacks who served in the armed forces in World War II<br/>
were in segregated units, chiefly in the army (and including black women,<br/>
who served in segregated units of the<br/>
WACs&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-WAC.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-WAC.html</a>&gt;and the Army and<br/>
Navy Nurse<br/>
Corps &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-NurseCorpsArmyandNavy.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-NurseCorpsArmyandNavy.html</a>&gt;).<br/>
However, wartime demands for increased numbers of service people as well as<br/>
the ideology of a war against Nazi racism contributed to some integration.<br/>
The Coast Guard began racial integration on shipboard, and the navy followed<br/>
on some fleet auxiliary ships. Army units were segregated for most of the<br/>
war, but beginning with the Battle of the<br/>
Bulge&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-BulgeBattleofthe.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-BulgeBattleofthe.html</a>&gt;,<br/>
when the army suffered shortages of white infantrymen, some 4,500 men from<br/>
black service units volunteered and formed black platoons in formerly<br/>
all‐white combat companies. Although the Marine Corps accepted a few black<br/>
recruits, it largely maintained its racial segregation. Black service<br/>
people, like other veterans, benefited after the war from the G.I.<br/>
Bill&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-TheGIBill.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-TheGIBill.html</a>&gt;<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
In the postwar era, the armed forces initially sought to avoid integration,<br/>
delaying even in the face of President Harry S.<br/>
Truman&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-TrumanHarryS.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-TrumanHarryS.html</a>&gt;&#39;s<br/>
1948 election‐year order (Executive Order 9981) for an end to segregation in<br/>
the military—the armed forces were directed to provide equal treatment and<br/>
opportunity regardless of race. The U.S. Air Force, however, had moved<br/>
toward integration in 1949 after achieving independent status in 1947.<br/>
Beginning in 1951, the reverses of the Korean<br/>
War&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-KoreanWar.html">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O126-KoreanWar.html</a>&gt;led to the<br/>
end of all‐black units in the army and Marines, and moved all the<br/>
services toward racial integration in the enlisted ranks for greater<br/>
efficiency. Black and white service people now fought side by side, dined in<br/>
the same mess hall, and slept in the same barracks. Nevertheless, the<br/>
officer corps remained white, with black officers representing only 3<br/>
percent of the army&#39;s officers and 1 percent of the air force, navy, and<br/>
Marine officer corps.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to stop now. :-)<br/>
