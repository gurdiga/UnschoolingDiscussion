<div id="ygrps-yiv-963295744">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am one of the editors of Revolution at Home an anthology we are <br/>
currently working on about feminist homeschoolers. We need to get in <br/>
touch with Paige McIntire (her email address seems to have changed), <br/>
who I believe found out about us on this list. If she&#39;s out there or <br/>
if you know how to contact her could you please have her email us at <br/>

<br/>
Thanks very much,<br/>
