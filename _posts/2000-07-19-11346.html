<div>I have a question--I am highly allergic to flea bites. We were at the 
Fairgrounds for 4H. and I was sitting on the ground w/my dd&#39;s club. I never 
thought of fleas!!!&nbsp; I got many many bites all over my legs and thighs. 
they get red, hot&nbsp; &amp; painfully itchy.&nbsp; does anyone know of any 
herbal o homeopathic remedies for this?&nbsp; I kept me up last night(along with 
the person who called about homeschooling at 12:30am!!!!! but that&#39;s another 
story!)</div>
<div>&nbsp;thanks</div>
