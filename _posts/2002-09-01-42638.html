  Hi.  I&#39;m very new to this list, so hesitate to comment on this list.  However, I don&#39;t think you could sue her.  However, you could press criminal charges against her.  You could also get a retraining order.   I&#39;m sorry you are having this trouble with your mil.<br/>

    &lt;&lt; I would sue her, but what would that get me? More <br/>
    &gt; headache, and what if we got an anti-homeschooling judge?<br/>

<br/>
    &lt;&lt;Maybe you wouldn&#39;t have to sue her.  Maybe just a letter from a <br/>
    lawyer demanding information would be enough. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I would work on the psychologist, who is licensed and subject to regulation, <br/>
    and see whether maybe what was done was unethical or illegal or against some <br/>
    protocol.<br/>
<br/>
    And if you find anything like that, I would write to the psychologist with a <br/>
    letter to the mil saying any further such action on their parts would be <br/>
    cause to call authorities.  Maybe.<br/>
