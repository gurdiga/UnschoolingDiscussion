<div id="ygrps-yiv-998820621">I&#39;d be interested, Elsa. Hannah heard a Latin singer... some new hot personality, the other day and  asked me about learning Spanish. I have some old Muzzy tapes so I popped it in the VCR and she was mesmerized. She now wants me to find the book that came with the tape ( now *where* did that thing go! !!)<br/>
She does get frustrated with all the exceptions found in our language rules, so you&#39;ve got a point... maybe another language would be a different place to spring from.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
