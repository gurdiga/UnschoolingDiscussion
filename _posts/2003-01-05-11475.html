&lt;&lt; Please, please share, Ren!  I am desperately trying to add tofu and other <br/>
soy products to our family diet, but<br/>
  it&#39;s just not going over well. :(  <br/>
 Do you have recipes, or techniques, or helpful websites? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I bet a lot of folks on here can share ideas.<br/>
But here is a quick, easy way to get tofu into your diet. Get the silken tofu <br/>
and blend about half a container into some frozen OJ concentrate, frozen <br/>
berries (strawberries, raspberries, whatever you like) Soy milk and maybe a <br/>
banana if you like.<br/>
Just play with the amounts and ingredients, you&#39;ll find lots of neat combos. <br/>
The tofu makes it extra creamy and smooth. You can add supplements if you <br/>
like also.<br/>
That&#39;s how I got Flax seed oil into my kids when they needed it.....<br/>
I will post more, but must get ready for work right now.<br/>
Oh, one other way my kids love tofu is drained really well (the extra firm), <br/>
sliced and fried in Olive oil with some Spike seasoning sprinkled on top. <br/>
Great for breakfast!<br/>

<br/>
When do kids need flax seed oil and how can you tell?<br/>
<br/>
What do you think the truth is in the controversy over canola oil?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m being dragged into healthier eating very reluctantly.  (I&#39;m dragging<br/>
myself, and it&#39;s hard work.)<br/>
<br/>
I bought flaxseed oil from the refrigerated section at the health food<br/>
store (a special trip for me) and could never bring myself to eat it. <br/>
It sat in the fridge for 6 months and I had to throw it away when we<br/>
moved last month.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201378151">I use flax seed in my oatmeal every morning.  I put about 2 tablespoons into <br/>
my coffee grinder and sprinkle it on.  You never know it&#39;s there.  It&#39;s very <br/>
inexpensive too, $2.00 a bag.<br/>
<br/>
  Last August I went for my &quot;yearly checkup&quot; and my cholesterol was down from <br/>
187(pretty good) to 158 (amazing).  I ask if they had my chart mixed up with <br/>
someone else.  The only difference from the year before was the addition of <br/>
flax seed, several cups of green tea a day, and I replaced butter, margarine, <br/>
etc... with olive oil.  <br/>
<br/>
  I know there isn&#39;t one thing that&#39;s a magic cure but I&#39;m sure the flax seed <br/>
helped.  <br/>

I regret to say &lt;g&gt; that when I read your kind words, I was sitting in<br/>
front of the computer with a slice of cold pepperoni pizza in my hand. <br/>

there is plenty of room for improvement here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007416313">We eat a lot of tofu...just buy firm or extrafirm tofu and always put <br/>
it straight into the freezer. I take one out every day or two and let <br/>
it thaw in the fridge. Freezing completely changes the texture and I <br/>
don&#39;t use it any other way (except to make smoothies - then I use the <br/>
silken style - unfrozen). To use it I don&#39;t bother with the boiling <br/>
that most people recommend, I just cut off a chunk, rinse it a little, <br/>
and squeeze it, like a sponge, to get rid of some  of the moisture. ANY <br/>
marinade works well with tofu - it absorbs flavors like crazy. A good <br/>
way to get started is to just buy the bottled marinades that are sold <br/>
in the barbeque sauce section of the grocery store. I&#39;ve used citrus <br/>
and teriyaki and garlic and soutwestern and traditional barbeque and <br/>
others. Just bake in the oven spread out on a cookie sheet - 300 <br/>
degrees for 20 minutes or so - depends on how you&#39;ve sliced it.  Then <br/>
you can slice and use in sandwiches or other ways. I&#39;ve used the <br/>
barbequed style in the sauce served on mashed potatoes, the citrus <br/>
style with rice and almonds or with noodles, the teriyaki I cut into <br/>
chunks and use in stir fry of various kinds. I also roll chunks of <br/>
garlicky tofu in crushed cornflakes and fry them or bake them - kids <br/>
really really like those.<br/>
<br/>
I make a variation of a really easy-to-make Persian soup, called <br/>
&quot;Eshkeneh&quot; - slice 2 white onions and saute in a little oil. Add to 4 <br/>
cups of water, 1 tsp or 2 tsp of turmeric, 1/2 tsp pepper, and some <br/>
salt and 1/4 cup of dried mint and a couple of cups of tofu chunks -- <br/>
bring to boil, simmer for 20 minutes. Add a few eggs - just crack and <br/>
drop into the soup and then cook for another couple of minutes. You can <br/>
leave out the eggs. Serve with warm bread.<br/>
<br/>
All of these are with tofu that has been frozen and thawed. I chop it <br/>
up and put in into all kinds of things -- it crumbles, too, if you <br/>
squeeze out more moisture, so you can add Italian seasonings to it and <br/>
use it for spaghetti sauce or Mexican seasonings and use it in burritos <br/>
or tacos. Now that grocery stores carry more tofu-based products (the <br/>
big superstores do), I buy already prepared  tofu products - I bought <br/>
something called &quot;Tofu Steak&quot; the other day - it was a southwestern <br/>
flavor - nothing I couldn&#39;t have done myself - but the sauce was good. <br/>
There was a mango flavored one too - but nobody in my family liked it.<br/>
