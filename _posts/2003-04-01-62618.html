<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535939572">Dolands rings a bell.  I lived there from 1977 to 1986.  I was 18 to 27, and<br/>
single, or at least not married.  I used to go to the Beachcombers and<br/>
remember being amazed when they gave last call at 5:00 am or so.<br/>
<br/>
I lived part of the time out at Cape Chiniak.  I traded caring for an<br/>
elderly woman for living alone in a trailer on the beach.  There was no<br/>
electricity or running water in her house or my trailer.  Salmon ran up a<br/>
little creek right through my yard.<br/>
<br/>
About half my years there I lived in town, the other half were a combination<br/>
of camping in a tent, living in campers with no modern conveniences, and as<br/>
a live-in nanny.<br/>
<br/>
My last few years I worked in the natural food store during the week and as<br/>
a cocktail waitress on the weekends.  The owners of the natural food store<br/>
were identical twin brothers.  The store sold things like vitamins and<br/>
protein powders so that they could afford to stock food items.<br/>
<br/>
So many cool memories.  Alaska is such a fantastic place.  Every American<br/>
should try to get there at least once.  Of course, there are other great<br/>
places too.<br/>
