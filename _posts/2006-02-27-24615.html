<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177024995">There are 4 small people in our home ranging from 8 years to 21 months.  I&#39;ve found that if I feed them first (usually via requests for a specific food or a &quot;big, giant food plate&quot;), then nurse the smallest, I&#39;m able to focus on meal prep for dh & I while they enjoy their food and the beginning of their shows, or they play, run laps throgh the kitchen, dining room, living room, or whatever.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I really enjoy cooking the evening meal and frequently have &quot;help&quot; as well!! Sous chefs, even!!  As illogical as it sounds, I can&#39;t seem to get dinner on the table any earlier than 6:30, no matter when I start.  If something&#39;s in the crockpot, it&#39;s somehow ready to serve at 6:30, if I prepare something, no matter how complicated, it&#39;s 6:30, if we order pizza 6:30.  For a while I tried to fight it, but at least I&#39;m consistent!!  If you&#39;re in MD, dinner&#39;s at 6:30! :-)  <br/>
   <br/>
  Hope that helps!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349841021">I like to have a snack tray for my kids in the afternoon.  I put out <br/>
my kids favorite things like graham crackers, club crackers, cheese, <br/>
marshmallows, nuts, fruit, sliced meat, popcorn; whatever they&#39;d like. <br/>
They usually munch on this while watching a show they want to see.  <br/>
Many times, I use this time to fix dinner.  Then I just have to heat <br/>
it up a little later, but everyone has had a snack and rest so we&#39;re <br/>
ok.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I cook dinner in the morning right after breakfast.  It <br/>
seems to be a good time for everyone around here.  I like to have a <br/>
variety in the frig and when my kids were younger, this seemed the <br/>
only way to do that.  Then I can help them through the rougher <br/>
afternoon times.<br/>
<br/>
I also brown large amounts of ground beef and then seperate it into <br/>
freezer bags and freeze it.  It&#39;s fine when you are adding it to <br/>
casseroles and stuff with sauces.  I also do that when I boil a <br/>
chicken.  I&#39;ll boil two and freeze the extra meat.  That helps a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I agree, I like the crock pot and fixin&#39; double of everything.  I <br/>
might fix double of everything several days in a row and then everyone <br/>
can pick their favorites.  <br/>
<br/>
It helps keep tension and frustration down to know when my kids need a <br/>
rest and food.  Mine need to eat regularly, so I just stop and fix a <br/>
snack tray and take it to them where they are playing or watching a <br/>
show.  It helps us get through the day if I don&#39;t wait until they are <br/>
at there explosion level and then try to fix something.  I try to stay <br/>
ahead of that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841211592">We seem to go through phases where we need to change the time we eat  <br/>
dinner. For a while, everyone was so hungry and so desperate to snack  <br/>
around 4pm (including me!) that I just started having dinner ready at  <br/>
4. The kids and I would eat, and then they&#39;d go off quite happily  <br/>
full and content and play.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d re-heat it for dh when he got home, and sit and chat with him  <br/>
(and a cup of tea) while he ate.<br/>
<br/>
The kids might need a small snack later in the evening, but it was  <br/>
never with the desperation of the afternoon craving.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662011928">One thing I&#39;ve done since having kids is to lose the expectation to have<br/>
dinner on the table at a certain time or even with us all eating together.<br/>
When I first read those studies about families that eat together I didn&#39;t<br/>
think it through and I thought it was important to eat together and I<br/>
stressed myself out with those expectations.  But what is really important<br/>
is to spend time with your family each day, listening to them and hanging<br/>
out with them.  It doesn&#39;t matter if it is at dinner time or not.  When I<br/>
let go of that expectation our lives became much more peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
I keep a bunch of cooked pasta and rice in the fridge.  You can pull out a<br/>
quick meal for a hungry kid and not feel like you have to do a lot of work.<br/>
Add some sauce to the spaghetti or cheddar cheese and milk to the macaroni<br/>
and throw it in the microwave.  Just re-heat the rice with butter or<br/>
sometimes I throw a frozen vegetable in the microwave and my kids are happy.<br/>
Of course there is most always fruit or raw veggies to hold us over if I did<br/>
make a meal and the kids are hungry before it is ready. <br/>
<br/>
I still cook meals several times a week and most often the kids sit and eat<br/>
with me (or us if dh is home).  I just don&#39;t let the expectation to eat<br/>
together stress me out. If someone is hungry, I help them find something<br/>
they can eat that doesn&#39;t take too long to prepare.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always put the kids&#39; needs ahead of dinner.  Dinner happened after  <br/>
or around nursing babies and such.<br/>
You might have to do away with the idea of a peaceful mealtime for a  <br/>
few years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe re-thinking meals would be the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps rather than to live by the idealized traditional  <br/>
model of dinner at 6:00, all at their seats, dinner conversation that  <br/>
could be reported to the media as an ideal mix of news of the day and  <br/>
philosophy, etc, to think of food and its purpose.  People need to be  <br/>
nourished physically and it&#39;s uncomfortable to go to sleep hungry.   <br/>
THAT is the purpose of evening food, not the appearance of a well- <br/>
organized dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Historically, until pretty recently the only families in the English- <br/>
speaking-world-in-general that had that dream dinner were those with  <br/>
servants to cook and set the table.  All the family had to do was  <br/>
show up and eat.  Poorer families tended to have soup or stew that  <br/>
had cooked all day and eat it out of bowls.  Crock pot food, and  <br/>
probably NOT meat.<br/>
<br/>
Servants became scarce during and after the first world war and the  <br/>
great depression  but the expectation that families would still  <br/>
maintain those appearances and schedules continued, or some families  <br/>
tried to use their children as servants.  Most mothers just tried to  <br/>
do all the cooking and ironing that they used to have done by maids,  <br/>
when the families couldn&#39;t afford to pay someone at least to come in  <br/>
and do laundry and ironing.<br/>
<br/>
Also it&#39;s not uncommon (historically) for children to eat first, and  <br/>
separately, and food kids like, and then for the adults and teens and  <br/>
guests to eat a little later, at leisure, and not have to worry about  <br/>
whether their food is something the kids would like.<br/>
<br/>
I have more energy in the morning but I don&#39;t always want to use it  <br/>
thinking about dinner.  When I do, I do better. &lt;g&gt;  If I start bread  <br/>
and put something out to thaw, or better yet mix up a casserole or  <br/>
put something in the crock pot—at least a sauce or something easy  <br/>
like ground beef or chicken in barbecue sauce—then dinner is easy and  <br/>
if plans change, the thing that was started earlier can go in the  <br/>
fridge.<br/>
<br/>
Also, because Keith takes lunch to work, we make large amounts and  <br/>
put the planned-for leftovers into individual portions in those  <br/>
reuseable yet eventually disposable Zip-Loc plastic containers.  They  <br/>
can be fridged or frozen.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never made our kids wait for dinner.  If they&#39;re hungry, they  <br/>
can snack.<br/>
<br/>
There might be ideas here that would be comforting:<br/>

<br/>
Try to ease guilt and expectation and pressure.  Those don&#39;t help the  <br/>
family unit.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Probably not just another tread, but a question for a whole different  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986761939">Well, I&#39;m not a veteran but   I LOVE the crockpot. I have several things the family LOVES. Crockpot pizza is on of our favorites.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My kids do like to help so that makes things more fun.  We have special diets in the house so I will often make 2 sets of meals.  I know some people who LOVE once a month cooking.  They spend ONE sunday a month and make and freeze all the meals.<br/>
  We do not like this. Especially ME. I hate eating leftovers. Not sure why I just don&#39;t.  We are going to do it with pizza since they are frozen anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900072649">Angela, You really pegged one of the issues in our house -- and I <br/>
just keep going around and around it in my head -- that concept of <br/>
the family dinner.  DH and I have really wanted to make it work <br/>
out.  First, because it &quot;seems&quot; like a good idea.  Second, because <br/>
the kids and DH don&#39;t really get any other chance to talk to each <br/>
other -- he leaves for work before they wake up and gets home at 6-<br/>
ish.  Third, because DH feels pretty strongly about this one.  After <br/>
reading your post and several of the other posts, I feel like maybe <br/>
DH and I need to sit down and really hash it out and decide if it is <br/>
worth it -- because as many of you have noted, kids are ready to eat <br/>
when they are hungry, having to wait for Dad doesn&#39;t really sit well <br/>
with them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also, the snack tray/veggie tray sounds like a great idea!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a good crockpot cook book they could recommend?  I have <br/>
one, but have been continually disappointed with the results.<br/>
<br/>
We usually do one leftovers night/week -- kind of potluck style.  <br/>
And one night/week is pizza night, DH picks it up on his way home.  <br/>
Weekends are more collaborative, so DH or I can hang with the kids <br/>
while we switch off in the kitchen depending on needs.  So, in <br/>
general we have a pretty good thing going 4 out of 7 nights, but I <br/>
think that 7 out of 7 would be much better!  <br/>
<br/>
So, veggies and snacks will be served at about 4 this afternoon if <br/>
you are hungry.  And next Sunday you will find me doing prep in the <br/>
kitchen for the week&#39;s meals.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone!<br/>

the various parts of life, and distinguish which are only <br/>
unschooling and which are something else, since it all seems like <br/>
one and the same at my stage in the game.  Cooking with my children, <br/>
nurturing them with good food and a pleasant safe place to eat, and <br/>
all that food represents seemed like things that unschoolers would <br/>
actually think about and take into careful consideration -- when I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-843672328">&lt;&lt;How do you keep cooked pasta without it going sticky and yuk?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Strain the pasta in cold water.  While the pasta is still in the strainer<br/>
add some butter to the hot pot and let it melt then stir the pasta back into<br/>
the pot.  Store in an airtight container or in the pot like I do half the<br/>
time.  ;)  Or you could add a little oil to the pasta but I prefer the taste<br/>
of butter.  If by some reason it still sticks together, reheat the pasta in<br/>
a little hot water and it unsticks.  <br/>
<br/>
When I worked in restaurants, we&#39;d cook pasta ahead of time and wrap it in<br/>
indiviual serving sizes in plastic wrap with a little oil mixed in.  Then<br/>
during the dinner hour, we&#39;d keep a pot of water simmering on the stove with<br/>
a metal strainer in it and it took only a minute in the pot to reheat the<br/>
pasta and it still tasted like it was cooked fresh.  You left the water on<br/>
the stove and just emptied the strainer of spaghetti right onto the plate<br/>
then put the strainer back into the water waiting for the next serving.<br/>
Just don&#39;t over cook it the first time.  Al dente is the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Also, sometimes the really inexpensive store brand pasta is just really<br/>
starchy.  Prince brand is a reaonably priced pasta that isn&#39;t starchy and<br/>
gross.  I am sure there are others but that&#39;s the one I am familiar with.<br/>
<br/>

Unschoolers actually think about and carefully consider LOTS of  <br/>
things, like how to buy shoes for their kids will like and that will  <br/>
be comfortable and safe and what kind of bikes or scooters or CD  <br/>
players or DVDs or......   the whole wide world.<br/>

You asked for recipes.  That can go on and on for thousands of posts,  <br/>
and on lots of cooking sites, it does! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027333804">Good food and relaxed attitudes toward food DO make unschooling work  <br/>
better! That&#39;s the truth.<br/>
<br/>
A recipe exchange would take up too much list time and be boring to  <br/>
most people and unschoolers don&#39;t necessarily have any better recipes  <br/>
than anybody else.<br/>
<br/>
But ideas for how to be more flexible in meeting our kids needs -  <br/>
that is appropriate here, for sure.<br/>
Also, thinking about what we really want is good - for example, I  <br/>
decided from early on, when my girls were little, that it was more  <br/>
important that they not develop eating disorders than anything else  <br/>
to do with food. I saw moms constantly nagging at their kids about  <br/>
what they ate or didn&#39;t eat and I could see how that focus on food  <br/>
was, eventually, likely to backfire. The moms just wanted their kids  <br/>
to eat healthy foods - I understood that. But even at very young  <br/>
ages, it was clear that food was becoming part of a power/control/ <br/>
resistance dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is likely to walk into our house after work and find it in  <br/>
a whirlwind of activity - people getting ready to go, just arriving  <br/>
home,  etc. Theater rehearsals tend to start at 7 pm - there is  <br/>
karate class, or soccer practice, or a Girl Scout event. He&#39;s usually  <br/>
hungry - so he digs around for leftovers right away, if nobody has  <br/>
any actual dinner going.<br/>
<br/>
But Sunday evenings we all tend to be home - often with an extra kid  <br/>
or two. So, either we go out to eat or we get take-out - or if  <br/>
someone isn&#39;t busy during the afternoon, they make a nice dinner.  <br/>
During the summer that&#39;s usually barbeque night.<br/>
<br/>
I buy a lot of frozen foods at either Trader Joe&#39;s or Costco.<br/>
<br/>
We eat a lot of fast food, too. BUT - not all fast food is created  <br/>
equal. In spite of the supposed &quot;evidence&quot; of the movie, &quot;Super Size  <br/>
Me,&quot; I eat healthy foods at fast food places all the time. Grilled  <br/>
chicken places like El Pollo Loco or Charo Chicken are great. I order  <br/>
hamburgers with just ketchup and with extra tomatoes and lettuce - no  <br/>
mayonnaise and no cheese, I eat only a few french fries, almost never  <br/>
a whole order, much less a supersized order. I eat at places that  <br/>
have side salads as an option to fries, I eat the baked potatoes at  <br/>
Wendy&#39;s. So - in spite of eating fast food nearly every day of my  <br/>
life for many years - I just got my physical exam results back (ON my  <br/>
birthday, how is that for timing? &lt;G&gt;) and all the lab tests are in  <br/>
the &quot;excellent&quot; range. Lots of this is lucky genetics, of course. My  <br/>
kids will eat like me, for the most part, although more fries and  <br/>
often a milk shake. But they get way more activity than I do, so they  <br/>
need those extra calories.<br/>
<br/>
We do keep good fruits and veggies in the refrigerator and on the  <br/>
dining room table, most of the time. And I spend money on them -  <br/>
don&#39;t buy the cheapest bland-tasting apples, but the best ones, and a  <br/>
wide variety. That&#39;s money well spent. I buy in season stuff that is  <br/>
ripe - especially things that are grown near us like tomatoes and  <br/>
strawberries. I know people who buy a bag of fruit without even  <br/>
caring if it is tasty or not - they put it out and tell the kids they  <br/>
can&#39;t have other stuff (cupcakes, cookies, candy, chips), that they  <br/>
have to have fruit for a snack. Yuck. If pears are good, I buy more  <br/>
pears and slice them up and offer them around to whomever is home. I  <br/>
bought a half-flat of strawberries because they were SO good, the  <br/>
other day. I buy frozen fruit medleys from Costco, too. Some  <br/>
partially defrosted frozen fruits with whipped cream on top is a  <br/>
delicious special treat. I also boil sugar and lemon juice to make a  <br/>
sweet/tart syrup and sometimes put that over mostly-defrosted frozen  <br/>
fruit. Sometimes with a little rose water added (that&#39;s an Iranian  <br/>
thing - we love it - not everybody thinks rose water tastes like  <br/>
something that should be ingested &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t usually think of us as doing a great job handing food needs -  <br/>
I have a crummy teensy little kitchen, I&#39;m a perfectly good cook, but  <br/>
don&#39;t personally get a lot of satisfaction from the cooking itself  <br/>
and there are many other things I&#39;d rather be doing. But we&#39;re all  <br/>
healthy and I have three teenage girls who aren&#39;t anorexic or bulimic  <br/>
and they enjoy good food and understand nutritional needs and eat a  <br/>
wide variety of foods without any apparent &quot;issues.&quot; That&#39;s good. If  <br/>
I had a cook, we&#39;d eat better - but we don&#39;t employ a cook and I have  <br/>
other things to do. Choices.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting how they&#39;ve each found their own way of getting a  <br/>
lot of physical activity, too. Rosie plays soccer and does karate,  <br/>
Roxana dances - tap and ballet and musical theater movement, Roya  <br/>
goes to a gym almost every day and finds another fun activity to do  <br/>
once or twice a week - a game of tennis, a bike ride, a hike,  <br/>
snowboarding - she&#39;s into trying new things. Rosie has always been  <br/>
active - she&#39;d go out and ride her bike for hours, if she didn&#39;t have  <br/>
any other physical activity that day. But the other two have had LONG  <br/>
periods of very sedentary lifestyles. Now, at 15, 18, and 21 - they  <br/>
are very healthy and physically active.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister&#39;s kids went to school - but they&#39;d come home famished - and  <br/>
instead of giving them the traditional &quot;after-school snack,&quot; she&#39;d  <br/>
give them dinner. It was great - they&#39;d eat and eat all those healthy  <br/>
delicious foods she&#39;d prepared. Later in the evening, they&#39;d have  <br/>
snacks. Better to have substantial food ready to eat when the kids  <br/>
need it - when they&#39;re really wanting it. Why &quot;tide them over&quot; with a  <br/>
carrot or a cookie, either one? Have we all forgotten what it is like  <br/>
to be a kid and be SO hungry?<br/>
<br/>
I learned from my sister (my oldest kid is a little younger than her  <br/>
youngest).<br/>
<br/>
She also gave them traditionally &quot;dinner&quot; foods for breakfast choices  <br/>
- things like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, microwavable  <br/>
chicken pot pies or hot pockets or leftover pizza or, my favorite, a  <br/>
hot bowl of tomato soup with crackers. Those were especially great  <br/>
for kids going off to school because they had to wait so long to have  <br/>
anything else to eat and had such a short time to eat their lunch.  <br/>
But it opened my mind to not sticking with &quot;breakfast foods for  <br/>
breakfast&quot; and all that.<br/>

myself as I lay in bed a couple nights ago trying to decide how I <br/>
felt about it -- the 12 year old in me kept rearing her uncertain <br/>
head, saying &quot;they don&#39;t like me!&quot; and &quot;I can never get it right, <br/>
I&#39;m such a social misfit!&quot;  But, luckily, I have done the Wisdom <br/>
Course and I knew who was talking! &lt;g&gt;  Isn&#39;t it funny how we can so <br/>
easily be thrown back in time -- and you didn&#39;t even say anything <br/>
mean, it was just all that internal interpretation run amok.<br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying this board, and look forward to more &quot;a-ha&quot; moments.<br/>
