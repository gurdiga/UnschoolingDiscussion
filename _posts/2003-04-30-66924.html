&lt;&lt; I trust that life will teach her what she needs to know. I hate to see <br/>
 her love for learning disappear. So I&#39;m thinking some form of <br/>
 homeschooling or unschooling might be the answer, but I don&#39;t want her <br/>
 to feel isolated from the world and from friends. How do I find other <br/>
 families in my area who are doing this, too? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty hard to isolate oneself unless one tries!<br/>
Real life gives all sorts of opportunities for social interaction, if that is <br/>
what she wants.<br/>
<br/>
Do you believe that even if there isn&#39;t a single other homeschooling or <br/>
unschooling family near you, that the damage she is suffering right now is <br/>
somehow justified?<br/>
I can&#39;t see that it&#39;s the better option, even if you&#39;re alone in your quest.<br/>
As the only homeschoolers, you may feel like the odd one out, but at least <br/>
you will have the chance to honor and nurture your dd for who she IS. Let her <br/>
have the freedom to learn what she chooses and have the self confidence that <br/>
very few public schooled children ever possess.<br/>
<br/>
I highly doubt you are the only ones in your area, but even so, get her OUT <br/>
of that system..please.<br/>
You can walk away now.<br/>
Look into your childs eyes and ask yourself if anything is worth her feeling <br/>
less than, compared to others and as though something were wrong with her for <br/>
just being HERSELF. Look deep into those eyes. Look at the wisdom there. Look <br/>
at the joy she has when doing something she loves. Is there anything worth <br/>
stopping that shining spark of joy? Is there a good enough reason to <br/>
extinguish that?<br/>
<br/>
Hold her hand, feel where it leads you. That hand will fit into yours for <br/>
such a short time...is there anything worth pushing it to do something it <br/>
doesn&#39;t enjoy doing?<br/>
The joy you feel as you grasp her hand and let her take you into her world, <br/>
there is nothing better in this life. Grasp that hand, relish the fact that <br/>
you can explore the world with that hand grasping yours, hold it gently and <br/>
let her show you the way to adventure, learning and a meaningful life.<br/>
<br/>
See her smile when she is happy. Capture that moment and don&#39;t let anything <br/>
make you think that there is something more you could offer at that moment.<br/>
KNOW deep in your soul that truth resonates when you think of trusting her. <br/>
OUST those other voices that are trying to squish her into a box that she <br/>
does not belong.<br/>
<br/>
Your love is stronger than those voices. Your trust is deeper than some <br/>
misguided information. Your relationship with her will prove the &quot;experts&quot; <br/>
wrong.<br/>
But only if you take the leap.<br/>
Believe in natural learning...she&#39;s known how all along.  The only thing you <br/>
can do by continuing on the current course is face regrets one day when your <br/>
child&#39;s love of learning is all but gone. She will then spend many years <br/>
trying to re-gain it.<br/>
OR, you could walk away now. Embrace a life of freedom and joy. A life of <br/>
your own making, not some institiution that couldn&#39;t possibly regard the <br/>
individual as more important than the mass.<br/>
Walk into a meaningful life. One that embraces your dd for exactly who she is <br/>
and what she loves TODAY. <br/>
