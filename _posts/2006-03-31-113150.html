<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161978280">I think in most of our heads and in any ex-school kid&#39;s head, the<br/>
phrase &quot;Learning is fun!&quot; is a red flag.  We recognize it as a ploy,<br/>
an attempt to trick us into doing something someone else wants us to<br/>
do for their own purposes, not ours.  Unschoolers don&#39;t talk like<br/>
that.  My kids (who spent several years in elementary school) will RUN<br/>
AWAY if anyone tells them that learning is fun.  They KNOW what&#39;s fun<br/>
for them.  They don&#39;t need to be seduced into it by adults with<br/>
questionable motives.</div>
