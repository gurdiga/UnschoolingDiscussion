<br/>
The best fertilizer for all plants is what comes from other plants. Keep<br/>
your grass clippings right on your lawn. As for leaves, simply run over them<br/>
when they fall and they fertilize the grass too. No waste. no trucks. If you<br/>
have vegetable gardens, make a compost pile using the leaves and grass<br/>
clippings of your yard and collect your neighbors&#39; also. Pile it together<br/>
and mix it up. In a few months, you have the best plant food there is. Just<br/>
spread it on any garden.<br/>
<br/>
Been doin&#39; that for years and have the finest gardens possible.</div>

it does is cover up the outlet).  Unless you have one of those old-timey <br/>
rotary mowers, like someone I know.  <br/>
