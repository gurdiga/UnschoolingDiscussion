<div id="ygrps-yiv-702492459">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Barb, aka Skateboard Mom. I&#39;m unschooling with my 8 year old son in Laguna <br/>
Beach, CA.  It took me a bit to find this unschooling path, but we&#39;re lapping it up now. We <br/>
tried school but it was actually a pack of teachers (!) who talked us into <br/>
homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re hoping to hook up with some of you--we travel quite a bit. I&#39;m a children&#39;s author <br/>
and will be taking my son on the road this year as I do the book tour, so we&#39;re hoping to <br/>
meet other unschoolers en route. My son is into Legos, Legos, and did I mention Legos? <br/>
He also reads like the dickens. I skateboard. He doesn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m supposed to be on NPR today. Here&#39;s the link if anyone&#39;s interested:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677376448">Hey Barb,<br/>
I heard you on NPR today!  What a great story!  That&#39;s very cool that you <br/>
are unschoolers.  I didn&#39;t notice that unschooling (or homeschooling) came <br/>
up in the interview unless I missed it.  But that&#39;s way cool.  I liked your <br/>
reaction after doing the half-pipe thing ( I know nothing about <br/>
skateboarding so I may have gotten that wrong).<br/>
<br/>
Glad you made it here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523371657">You&#39;re awesome, Barb!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending your NPR link on to my local groups.  If you find your way<br/>
to the Dallas or N. TX area, give us a holler at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NorthTexasNaturalLearners/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NorthTexasNaturalLearners/</a><br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve got a gaggle of skaters (but no moms that I know of!) who would<br/>
love to meet you and skate with you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check out your book at a bookstore this weekend, too, if I can.<br/>
