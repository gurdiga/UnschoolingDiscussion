<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108911917"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Interestingly enough I have noticed that my DS has<br/>
&gt; recently stopped telling people he is homeschooling when they ask if<br/>
&gt; he is in kindergarten or first grade, he just says kindergarten<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter has gone from saying &quot;we homeschool&quot; to saying &quot;I don&#39;t go<br/>
to school.&quot;  It usually stops other questions from coming!  If people<br/>
are receptive I explain, if it is some man chatting with us in the<br/>
frozen foods section I just smile big and change the subject!<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
Sorscha takes great pride in saying something to the effect of, &quot;I<br/>
Unschool.&quot;   Sometimes people will give her a quirky look and prod a little<br/>
further.  Then she&#39;ll say something to the effect of, &quot;I have never been to<br/>
school and I do what I want.&quot;  The way she puts it is so funny because it<br/>
comes out like she&#39;s a wild-banshee.  I typically just smile and do not try<br/>
to explain over her, even though I can tell the person wants me too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should also watch for the &quot;receptive ones&quot;, but even though we have<br/>
only been RUing for about 6 months, 2 years unschooling....I am already<br/>
tired of trying to help someone understand.  I can only imagine years from<br/>
now.  I have come to the realization that even my bestest of friends whom I<br/>
speak to on a daily basis don&#39;t really understand what we do (don&#39;t do).<br/>
Many think we are doing a disservice to Sorscha.  I have been reading and<br/>
learning about it for about 6 years.  I think that there is possible not a<br/>
way to exchange that in 2 minutes.  Hmmm, any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell I had 5 days of my mom-in-law in town.  We adore each other and<br/>
typically her visits are wonderful.  This time it seemed like she was more<br/>
worried about Sorscha&#39;s upbringing.  I got the following questions.<br/>
<br/>
socialization?<br/>
smoking and drugs and how will she learn about not doing them?<br/>
college?<br/>
What do you think she is going to be / do when she grows up?<br/>
She has to learn to stand in line?<br/>
The world is a big, bad place and she needs to know how to operate in it?<br/>
People are horrible and bad and she needs to know how to negotiate them?<br/>
She will not be able to work in a job and deal with people?<br/>
No rules? Yes, I tried to explain principles!<br/>
She plays too many video games.<br/>
She is going to have to learn to eat what is offered, how is she going to go<br/>
to social events?<br/>
How are you going to teach her about sex?<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t she be writing more?<br/>
When are you going to put her in school?<br/>
She does not have to take a bath everyday?<br/>
She needs to know that she can not wear sweats everyday, especially if she<br/>
slept in them.<br/>
Your (meaning me..mom) are a short order cook.<br/>
She has no chores?<br/>
She has no schoolwork?<br/>
<br/>
Soooo, I tried my best to explain.  It is funny because we talk on the phone<br/>
several times a week and see her often.  For some reason, something clicked<br/>
with her this time and she was very worried.  I plan on sending her an email<br/>
with links to all the above.  Any help would be appreciated. I plan on<br/>
checking out Sandras and Rejoycing.  I also invited her to the conference<br/>
here in NM...we&#39;ll see.<br/>

<br/>
I just had this discussion with Kelly Lovejoy.<br/>
<br/>
Last year when Cameron was here, a couple of times were were out in  <br/>
public and someone would be asking me something, or I would say I  <br/>
knew Cameron through homeschooling conferences, or I told a few  <br/>
people of my kids, Cameron and some other kids &quot;They&#39;re all  <br/>
homeschooled.&quot;   Cameron interrupted me and said &quot;UNschooled&quot; or  <br/>
about the conferece, &quot;UNschooling conference.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, MY kids are unschooled, but of the group of kids I was referring  <br/>
to, some were unschooled and some were homeschooled more  <br/>
structurally, but they were all &quot;homeschoolers&quot; in that they didn&#39;t  <br/>
go to school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very often (or maybe always) courtesy requires that our answer be  <br/>
something in the realm of understanding of our audience.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Española, a small city or large town in northern New  <br/>
Mexico.   When I visited England and they asked &quot;Where are you from?&quot;  <br/>
they didn&#39;t want to hear &quot;Española.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was in Española and someone asked &quot;Where do you live?&quot; it  <br/>
would have been rude and also worthless to say &quot;Española.&quot;  And in  <br/>
fact, internally to that area, I didn&#39;t live in Española at all, I  <br/>
lived in Lower San Pedro.    Española, as neighborhoods go, is about  <br/>
a mile square, west of the old bridge, from the hospital to  <br/>
Guachapungue.  None of you need to know that, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So in England, I live in the U.S.<br/>
In the other states, if asked, I live in New Mexico.<br/>
In New Mexico, if asked, I live in Albuquerque.<br/>
In Albuquerque, if asked, northeast heights.  If that&#39;s too general,  <br/>
I live near Juan Tabo and Candelaria.  If that&#39;s too general (because  <br/>
the person asking lives there too, I live near Sandia Bowl, backed up  <br/>
against the vacant lot.<br/>
<br/>
When people ask why my kids aren&#39;t in school, I say they&#39;re  <br/>
homeschooled.<br/>
If the people know about homeschooling and want to know more, I say  <br/>
we&#39;re unschoolers.<br/>
If the people consider themselves to be unschoolers but have just  <br/>
spanked their kids for watching TV, I&#39;ll say &quot;radical unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But for my opening move to be &quot;radical unschoolers&quot; to a stranger  <br/>
who&#39;s just asking the most surface and preliminary of questions would  <br/>
be like telling someone in London that I live near Sandia Bowl, on  <br/>
Tahiti Court.<br/>
<br/>
To give the same answer without regard to who the audience is is to  <br/>
live by a rule instead of by principles.<br/>
The principle at work in conversations is to provide understandable  <br/>
information in a way that doesn&#39;t make the one who inquired feel like  <br/>
now he has to ask another question just to understand the answer to  <br/>
the first question.  If someone&#39;s just making polite conversation  <br/>
like &quot;Oh! Is school out this week?&quot; a nice answer is &quot;They don&#39;t go  <br/>
to school.&quot;  If someone at the grocery store or doctor&#39;s office asks  <br/>
&quot;What grade is she in?&quot; I usually say something like &quot;She would be in  <br/>
9th if she went to school, but we homeschool without grade levels.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I think about it all.  Depends who wants to know and  <br/>
why.  It&#39;s certainly possible, and not uncommon, for a conversation  <br/>
that starts with &quot;They&#39;re homeschooled&quot; to end up being about Holt,  <br/>
school reform, open classroom theories and natural learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189341064">I like this list of questions.<br/>
My counter-question to each one would be something like<br/>
&quot;Do you think school socialization is better?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do you think school prevents smoking and drug use?&quot;<br/>
(I quite think it causes it in most cases, personally.)<br/>
<br/>
Are kids in school taught what they will be when they grow up? (and  <br/>
are they more likely to stick with their first choices?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do schools teach kids about sex?<br/>
<br/>
But about rules and principles, I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;No rules,&quot; you could  <br/>
say &quot;No arbritrary rules.&quot;  &quot;No rules just for the sake of having a  <br/>
rule.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Standing in line:  grocery store and movie theatre.  Post office  <br/>
(though ours has a &quot;take a number, mill about&quot; method I like lots,  <br/>
and places to sit).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556356797"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My daughter has gone from saying &quot;we homeschool&quot; to saying &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>go<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to school.&quot;  It usually stops other questions from coming!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just a little aside.  Last fall, when my DS had told someone that we <br/>
homeschool (in response to the usual question), the woman asked what <br/>
he did at home, DS got shy but my DD, 3 at the time, (she is very <br/>
verbal, almost precociously so) chimed in, &quot;you know, when you stay <br/>
home and play all day?!&quot;  I thought this was the perfect response -- <br/>
and the woman was just left with this smile on their face and no more <br/>
questions, because who can question the excitement of a three year <br/>
old?  Of course this might not work for all ages, but I still think <br/>
that it is a good reply, after all, most people are ready to respond <br/>
to the answer they are expecting, which is probably not &quot;stay home and <br/>
play all day!&quot;  <br/>
