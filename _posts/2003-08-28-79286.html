<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265245548">I&#39;ve been trying to read alot of the old posts. Glad to have found <br/>
this resource! Especially like the advice about reading as that is an <br/>
issue for us...has been for awhile. My youngest is soon to be 10 and <br/>
refuses to read...says he can&#39;t but will read when he needs to find a <br/>
show on TV, etc. Guess that&#39;s the result of his horrible experience <br/>
in public school. We are in CT. and interested in meeting more <br/>
unschoolers. We have a great homeschooling support group/s in our <br/>
area but many are focuses on schooling-at-home. I plan to be back and <br/>
have more to say when I have more time. Thanks for being here!<br/>

<br/>
refuses to read...says he can&#39;t but will read when he needs to find a <br/>
<br/>
show on TV, etc.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Reading is a large range!   Schools will say a child &quot;is reading&quot; just <br/>
because he can recite the same little bit of text the other 30 kids just recited.  <br/>
<br/>
When I broke my leg I couldn&#39;t walk.  I wasn&#39;t REFUSING to walk, I couldn&#39;t <br/>
walk.<br/>
It seemed worth risking a fall for me to get up and use a walker to get into <br/>
the bathroom to use the toilet.  Then I HAD to &quot;walk&quot; (with a walker) back.  <br/>
It wasn&#39;t worth the risk to get in the walker just to walk for no good reason.  <br/>
I could NOT have gone hiking, but I wasn&#39;t &quot;refusing&quot; to hike.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably not worth the risk for him to try to read aloud for people who <br/>
want to criticize any failure and who have the power to &quot;make&quot; him suffer pain <br/>
and embarrassment with more reading lessons and more &quot;reading aloud,&quot; so he <br/>
opts out of that torture.<br/>
<br/>
But if he can even by process of reasonable guess and elimination find a TV <br/>
show, his reward is immediate.  The show is on.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t read Spanish.  If someone pressed me to read Spanish aloud, I would <br/>
refuse.  But I CAN tell, in the TV guide, basically what kind of show is on.  <br/>
And the times and channels are numeric.  KIND of reading can get you a TV show.<br/>
<br/>
Insulting someone who IS learning to read (with TV guide or anything else) by <br/>
saying he can read but refuses to is a negative on the road to reading.  It&#39;s <br/>
a roadblock, an obstacle, to be critical and suspicious of him instead of <br/>
supportive and patient and sweet.<br/>
<br/>
With TV listings, there are lots of numbers, lots of clues, he&#39;s using the <br/>
process of elimination.  It&#39;s not quite fluent reading to just use bits and <br/>
pieces of clues.<br/>

You might already have seen that, but just in case...<br/>

&gt; Wow...some response! I need to clarify a bit here. My child <br/>
 </span></blockquote>refuses...does not want to even try...to read a book. Probably as you <br/>
mentioned for fear of being wrong...we are still de-schooling. My <br/>
family thinks I am crazy for reading to him and not making him read <br/>
but I know he will when he is ready.<br/>
Thanks for the site info.</div>

<br/>
I can read Spanish...as in I can look at the words and pronounce them.<br/>
However,  I would have only a tiny idea of the meaning of the words...or<br/>
none at all. Spanish is completely phonetic,  it&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; once you learn<br/>
the rules.  But to know what the words mean....well, I am very limited!<br/>
