<div><font size="2">We jumped on the pi day wagon...we thought it would be fun, 
and since my son is 4 ....we considered fraction...1/2 pie...1/4 pie....you get 
1/8 of this pie....he helped make the pie crust, and we had blackberry, 
blueberry strawberry, rasberry, mint&nbsp; pie, and we appreciate the wonderful, 
and fun idea!!!!Thanks.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font size="2">We got the short form for the census...names, and birthdates, 
and races.....SInce I am of the phylosophy....that I am a universal member of 
this place in space....We all chose to put Other race.....Human......I don&#39;t see 
what my race has to do with providing funding.&nbsp; If we all put the same 
race, wouldn&#39;t we all get the same ammount?&nbsp; there would still be the same 
ammount of people.&nbsp; I&#39;ve always written other when filling out 
applications, and the such...I just don&#39;t see the sense in asking this question 
, if your not going to give a self described answer, and their isn&#39;t the space 
for that.&nbsp; I consider myself Other than a category, and so I choose 
Other.&nbsp; Michelle</font></div></html></div>
