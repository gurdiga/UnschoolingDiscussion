&lt;&lt; Ah, games,  if only people would give them the credit they deserve.  If my <br/>
son&#39;s head was in a book or if he was researching some biological function of <br/>
some animal, people wouldn&#39;t ask,  &quot;how long has he been doing that?&quot;  But <br/>
since its a game, its not quite right that he&#39;s doing this so indepthly.    I <br/>
find his passion amazing and incredible.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mars, and cargo cults.<br/>
<br/>
An hour ago I was upstairs making quesadillas (many, and cutting them up and <br/>
making another) for the dozen or so kids (ages 13 to 21) who are here tonight. <br/>
 Marty and Ryan (the 21 year old, who&#39;s working on writing games with Marty) <br/>
were talking about Mars, and Marty said he would go ask his dad how far Mars <br/>
was from Earth.  Somehow it mattered in their game.  We talked about whether <br/>
and why Keith (the dad) would know.<br/>
<br/>
While Marty hiked back to where Keith was, I went to get encyclopedias, <br/>
saying I was going to look the old fashioned way.  I remembered someone here or in <br/>
some unschooling discussion asking (today? yesterday?) whether anyone used <br/>
encyclopedias anymore.<br/>
<br/>
So I pulled out M, P and S (in case it was under planets or solar system) and <br/>
started looking, but also was saying it was going to be WAY variable and <br/>
depend on the moment, because sometimes Mars is nowhere NEAR Earth.  Under Mars <br/>
there was a graphic of when Mars had been closest, since the late 1960&#39;s, and it <br/>
showed the pattern, like where Earth was in orbit when Mars came by.  That <br/>
was cool.<br/>
<br/>
But in all that, Ryan said they had been frustrated one time that the <br/>
encyclopedia didn&#39;t have what they wanted.  &quot;This encyclopedia?&quot;  &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So they&#39;ve used it before.  <br/>
<br/>
I mentioned finding &quot;cargo cults&quot; and I didn&#39;t believe him.  There it was, I <br/>
said, in that little bitty paperback encyclopedia.  I got it and showed him.  <br/>
Nobody in the room (four guys) had heard of cargo cults, and it wasn&#39;t in the <br/>
larger encyclopedia, so I got online and found a site, with some photos!  <br/>
<br/>
Here it is, in case any of you haven&#39;t heard of cargo cults, or if you have <br/>
and want to see photos of the model planes and some other cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
And that discussion led to other speculation on the nature of religion, <br/>
extraterrestrial possibilities and the Simpsons episode when Lisa had a microscopic <br/>
culture worshipping her, and evolving quickly.<br/>
<br/>
That all happened because of games, and good relationships, and joy.<br/>
<br/>
Ah yeah, the site:<br/>

If that&#39;s any fun, just go to google and put in &quot;cargo cults.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Forgot to say, Keith did know how close Mars can get, but also said right off <br/>
that it varies wildly and changes all the time.  Not that there&#39;s not a <br/>
pattern, there&#39;s just not one &quot;right answer.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
And this connects to Theodore Sturgeon&#39;s well-known Sci-Fi story &quot;The <br/>
Microcosmic God&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think one could connect Cargo Cults to the movie &quot;The Gods Must Be <br/>
Crazy&quot;, but it&#39;s a stretch.<br/>

<br/>
Well here I am reading the fascinating &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot;, with the<br/>
point of view that much of the actual information is completely new to me,<br/>
since I did not go to school and learn American History. I&#39;m thinking that<br/>
without any doubt there could be an Australian version of this book, and<br/>
wondering about the European history and the often parallel path of teaching<br/>
Australian history - the &quot;discovery&quot; by a heroic European, the<br/>
marginalization of the native population, the glossing over of non-English<br/>
European pre-dating explorations including the surely inevitable visitations<br/>
of Polynesians and S.E. Asian cultures which can hardly have failed to make<br/>
that meager ocean journey (I mean if the Vikings could cross the Atlantic!)<br/>
<br/>
And here is a whole and fascinating carry over of colonialism that I would<br/>
have liked to have heard of when we were doing our brief study of Papua/New<br/>
Guinea - a region that according to the Geography I studied in High School<br/>
(a looong time ago it should be noted) is valuable almost entirely because<br/>
it contained viable &quot;primitive&quot; cultures to study who were still using slash<br/>
and burn agriculture, and according to the History I studied was very useful<br/>
to &quot;us&quot; (Aussies and Allies) in WWII, because the Japanese got hung up in<br/>
the jungles there and didn&#39;t manage to get as far as Australia, at least not<br/>
much.(!!!) As if the Japanese were marching on a giant Earth sized board<br/>
game and got to a space marked &quot;Lose A Turn&quot; in the PNG jungles.<br/>

Playing on Fox Movie Channel this month. In which one of the pieces of<br/>
information is about the King of the Watusis, who was able to buy a car with<br/>
the money he got from making the movie &quot;King Solomon&#39;s Mine&quot; (Stewart<br/>
Granger/Deborah Kerr) a review of which is quoted in &quot;Desk Set&quot; and which<br/>
was on the other night on TCM.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-359110736">The evening&#39;s activities are winding down (it&#39;s 12:30 in the morning) but I hear the six kids who are still here (seven, but Kirby&#39;s working on math homework) have started playing &quot;The Dating Game&quot; though they&#39;ve misnamed it (&quot;The Dating Show&quot;) and don&#39;t really get it.  Marty was asking questions like &quot;What is the capital of Iowa?&quot; and &quot;What is the horsepower of a 97 Volvo?&quot;  And &quot;If you were a girl, what kind of girl would you be?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re calling the moderator &quot;Trebek&quot; and Holly just broke for a hot pockets commercial, just so she could sing the theme music, which she had come in here to get me to sing to her, because none of them knew it.<br/>
<br/>
A lame version of a show they haven&#39;t really seen, and yet they&#39;re all laughing and having a good time.  Kirby&#39;s throwing in rude comments.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to go to sleep.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I had that one (Lies...) on my long range reading<br/>
 </span></blockquote>list (who wrote it, Zinn?) but was holding off cause<br/>
I&#39;m still recovering from &quot;Labor&#39;s untold History&quot;<br/>
(which left me just floored and feeling totally<br/>
betrayed...the ways in which I was lied to in school<br/>
is just unbearable to think about at times)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading &quot;1421, the year China Discovered America&quot;<br/>
which is just utterly amazing.  It sets out to prove<br/>
that by 1423 China had sent over a hundred ships out<br/>
to circumnavigate the globe and finish the first true<br/>
map of the world, and yes, there is evidence of the<br/>
Chinese landing (everywhere! and) in Australia<br/>
hundreds of years before the first Europeans. <br/>
Interesting too that the author (Gavin Menzies)is not<br/>
a &#39;scholar&#39; or an academic, but a retired submarine<br/>
captain (English) whose interest in old maps led him<br/>
to stumble upon the first evidence of China&#39;s<br/>
exploration.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first began reading it, I would get so excited<br/>
that I would read parts aloud to my hubby saying, &quot;OH<br/>
MY GOD Andrew, listen to this...&quot; One night when I<br/>
asked Joshua (8) what he wanted me to read to him<br/>
before bed he said, &#39;that book on china that you&#39;re<br/>
reading...&#39; Funny too that all of Joshua&#39;s friends are<br/>
studying China this year as part of the school<br/>
curriculum.  So in addition to what Joshua&#39;s been<br/>
learning about China from his computer game &#39;rise of<br/>
Nations&#39;, he won&#39;t have to *unlearn* &#39;European<br/>
History&#39; like his mom.<br/>
<br/>

pamela, who&#39;s *still* deschooling....<br/>
