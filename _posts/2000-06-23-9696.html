I love having a garden, even though it is a lot of work.  I can a lot of our<br/>
produce, and even a lot of our meat.<br/>
<br/>
It was a big change for us because we used to live in So. CA, where nothing<br/>
grew unless it was watered daily.  Then we moved here, never even watered<br/>
our garden once, and had produce coming out of our ears!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295110107">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
   I have a new take on &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.&quot;  We have a small <br/>
vegetable garden each year, but we really do not know what we are doing.  <br/>
Anything that thrives is purely an accident, but we have fun.  Last year was <br/>
our first foray into tomatoes.  My husband and I don&#39;t care for them, but my <br/>
son loves them and we wanted some for him.  We had two plants of the cherry <br/>
tomato variety, and for reasons we could never figure out, the plants went <br/>
berserk.  They were *loaded* with tomatoes, and at first Colton was in <br/>
gardening nirvana and ate tomatoes with every meal.  After about a month of <br/>
this, Colton began to tire of tomatoes so we started giving Ziploc bags of <br/>
tomatoes to friends and family.  After another few weeks of this, everyone we <br/>
knew had stopped speaking to us and certainly didn&#39;t want any more tomatoes.  <br/>
Still, the plants just churned out little tomatoes, faster than we could pick <br/>
them.  We started leaving bags of them on neighbor&#39;s doorsteps under the <br/>
cloak of night, and handing them out randomly to people like the mailman and <br/>
anyone who rang our doorbell for any reason.  The plants STILL showed no <br/>
signs of slowing down, and one afternoon my husband just snapped.  He went <br/>
out to the garden and murdered the plants, literally hacked them to pieces!  <br/>
When he came back into the house, he was muttering something that sounded <br/>
like, &quot;They must be stopped...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
   Gluttons for punishment, we have more tomato plants going this year.  So <br/>
if you are anywhere near Marysville, Washington, stop by for some tomatoes.  <br/>
Bring plastic bags.  Lots of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568971901">I live in northeastern Nebraska, what is known as the tri-state area because<br/>
South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska all converge here.  It is also hot and<br/>
muggy here during the summer, corn growin&#39; weather.  And wind and snow<br/>
during the winter!<br/>
<br/>
I grow all of the usual vegetables, and then I also try different varieties<br/>
of things every year.  I&#39;ve not had great luck with herbs for some reason,<br/>
and strawberries get eaten up by birds and such.  We do mostly organic<br/>
gardening, if there is such a thing!  I use Sevin dust on the beans when<br/>
they are young, otherwise the beetles eat them up.  By the time they have<br/>
some size to them the beetles can&#39;t do much damage.  We spray weed killer<br/>
around the outside of the garden area because there are weed abatement laws<br/>
here and there really is no other way to keep the weeds down in an area of<br/>
this size.  We keep a border fo about 10 feet between the sprayed area and<br/>
the garden.<br/>
<br/>
During the winter we take all of the yucky hay, cow pies, and nanny berries<br/>
out to the garden area, and in the spring my husband disks it all in.  When<br/>
the garden is growing we take old hay and put it around plants and in<br/>
walkways for the nutrients to leach into the ground.  Lots of natural<br/>
fertilizer!<br/>
<br/>
Last year I did have to water the tomatoes and melon twice as we had a long<br/>
dry spell, but that is unusual.  So far no watering and all is doing well.<br/>
