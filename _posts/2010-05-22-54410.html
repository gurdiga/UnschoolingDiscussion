If you collect a list of people&#39;s biggest personal frustrations, that  <br/>
will be time and energy spent looking at negativity, and seeing  <br/>
unschooling as a negative thing.<br/>
<br/>
If you avoid the things on this page:<br/>

and you consider what&#39;s on this one:<br/>

<br/>
you can probably come back and tell us some of your biggest joys with  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

That the general public is so disapproving of unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  Perhaps it&#39;s just my personality, but I&#39;ve never doubted that unschooling would work.  I still don&#39;t.  Most of my frustrations lie in external things, like coming to a head with other parents, or lack of money to do something we really want to do or buy.  Treating kids kindly and respectfully and knowing that happy kids learn seems so obvious to me that sometimes it&#39;s really hard to understand other parents who treat their children so poorly, obviously so and even very subtly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling isn&#39;t frustrating in the same sense as educational methods <br/>
can be frustrating, if that&#39;s what the question is implying. It isn&#39;t <br/>
like we&#39;re trying to make the kids do something they don&#39;t want to do.  <br/>
Life is frustrating, sometimes, and unschooling is living life. <br/>
Sometimes people don&#39;t understand each other and that&#39;s frustrating. <br/>
Sometimes people have conflicting wants - that can be frustrating. <br/>
Sometimes we don&#39;t have the time or money or capability of doing what we <br/>
want.  But - those are all frustrations that everybody experiences to <br/>
some degree, not just unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906184279">Jenny, I&#39;m the same way about getting unschooling. It has always been<br/>
obvious to me that it will work very well. Most people don&#39;t get it,<br/>
or not very much, even over time (thinking especially of relatives).<br/>
I&#39;m learning ways to be ok with that and to soothe the fears of people<br/>
who will probably never get it.<br/>
<br/>
Not unlike my views about religion. There are so few people I can talk<br/>
to about that here in the American South where churchgoing is still<br/>
largely taken for granted. That&#39;s sooo not a good topic to get on.<br/>
Same thing with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean those topics don&#39;t come up, though. :) My favorite<br/>
tactic is to simply listen to people talk about their fears and then<br/>
respond as mildly and as little as possible. That works 99.9% of the<br/>
time. More info doesn&#39;t soothe. I used to believe the opposite. I<br/>
thought that if only people understood exactly where I&#39;m coming from,<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t worry as much. That&#39;s just not so.<br/>

<br/>
This is so true. Once I let go of worrying about whether or not my children were learning the academic subjects that are taught in school and let go of worrying about whether they were on track with their schooled friends, so many frustrations started to float away. There&#39;s no frustration from trying to get a child to just sit down and do his work. I went through a lot of that with my oldest when he was in school and when we first started homeschooling and tried to follow a curriculum. It was miserable for everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Now we just live life with the awareness that learning happens all the time in the individual&#39;s own time. There are life frustrations but they are caused by real situations that we need to learn how to negotiate for life. They aren&#39;t the same type of frustrations created by trying to force a child to do something in a way that is contrary to his natural process and being.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20413111">Hey, Adam,<br/>
<br/>
I noticed your post on the Life is Good conference yahoo group about  <br/>
favorite blogs. This is also a good place to ask.<br/>
<br/>
I think I saw your name at the conference, though I don&#39;t believe we  <br/>
met. How did you enjoy it? Did you ask this question of anyone there?<br/>
