 You said so aptly what I have struggled to say.   Sometimes when we are <br/>
running on emotion, its difficult to express our thoughts.  Thanks for being <br/>
so consise with your point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, never been accused of being &quot;concise&quot; in my life :-), but I&#39;m <br/>
always glad if something I&#39;ve got to say is useful to anyone. I don&#39;t <br/>
get to visit this list very often, as it is just way too much to even <br/>
*read* all the posts that come through in a day. But I can&#39;t resist <br/>
occasionally popping in here and there.<br/>

more.. :-)  I can see why you are writing a novel,  you do a good job of <br/>
putting ideas and thoughts into  perspective.  <br/>
