Lately I&#39;ve been re-reading John Holt&#39;s HOW CHILDREN<br/>
LEARN, and his chapter on Talk has a lot in common with <br/>
this thread. I&#39;m fascinated by how early children--babies even--<br/>
understand the power of language. My current two-year-old<br/>
is exploding with new words and phrases right now. She is<br/>
convinced that she is her two older sisters&#39; equal in all<br/>
things, and since she believes this, it&#39;s very nearly true. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
She is suddenly conversing in long paragraphs and complicated<br/>
syntax. One of her recent aquisitions is the phrase, &quot;It&#39;s my <br/>
WORK,&quot; which she wields very often, with gusto. Today I <br/>
walked into a room and found her jumping on an upside-down <br/>
futon. Before I could say a word, she shouted out a pre-emptive <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t mess my WORK, Mom!&quot; --adding, almost under breath, <br/>
&quot;It &#39;portant work.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And I suppose, when you&#39;re two, it is. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday her Portant Work was filling a soap dish with<br/>
water. She had hauled a stool into my bathroom and still<br/>
had to balance her belly on the edge of the sink, feet<br/>
dangling, in order to reach the faucet. I walked in right<br/>
in the middle of this strenuous process. She must have<br/>
been a trifle uncertain of the permissibility of this<br/>
particular activity, because instead of shouting &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
mess my work&quot; with that sternness that only a younger<br/>
sibling can muster, her tone was soft and hopeful. &quot;It my<br/>
work, Mom. Don&#39;t &#39;top my work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the soap turning to mush in the flooded dish<br/>
and had one of those moments of warring perceptions.<br/>
*What a mess* vs. *From her point of view this must be<br/>
really interesting.* Of course the only decent thing to do was<br/>
smile and say, &quot;I won&#39;t stop your work, honey.&quot; (To which<br/>
she replied, &quot;I not Honey. I Eileen.&quot; &lt;G&gt;) Sayonara, fancy<br/>
guest soap. (First one I&#39;ve ever had, I think. It was doomed<br/>
from the moment it entered my house.)<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that just before bed tonight, she lugged the<br/>
stool back into my bathroom to check on the soap dish.<br/>
I&#39;m glad I neglected to dump out the water today. (Can&#39;t<br/>
say I&#39;m THAT accomodating--if I&#39;d thought of it, I <br/>
probably would have.) Guess I&#39;ll leave it for a while and<br/>
see what happens. After all, her older sister is always<br/>
concocting strange messes in the name of science and<br/>
leaving them to stew on countertops. Of COURSE Eileen (not<br/>
Honey) has Portant Experiments to conduct.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where she got the &quot;don&#39;t mess up my work&quot; <br/>
thing from, though. I&#39;ve never said it. Doesn&#39;t sound like <br/>
something my husband would say. I bet it was the four-year-old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914645232">Thanks so much.....as was said before - this brings back so many memories! My Brianna is 10 and she still says a few things that have become part of our lingo - but I miss this so much!<br/>
<br/>
Again - thanks - you&#39;ve painted a wonderful picture of a beautiful baby, a loving insightful mom and a warm loving situation.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Janis<br/>
