Gettysburg Address Essay Contest -- Deadline March 31st, 2003:<br/>
<br/>
The Lincoln Fellowship of Pennsylvania, based at Gettysburg College, <br/>
invites <br/>
homeschoolers in 7th and 8th grade students to participate<br/>
in its annual essay contest.<br/>
<br/>
The theme, &quot;What the Gettysburg Address Means to Me&quot;, is designed to <br/>
&quot;actively encourage the youth of our Commonwealth to embrace his <br/>
(Lincoln&#39;s) <br/>
ideals&quot;. The contest, however, is open to youth in all states.<br/>
<br/>
This is the third year that I have helped contest officials to<br/>
reach homeschoolers, and they have found the response surprising: <br/>
Homeschool <br/>
entries now dominate the contest! Last year, about 2/3&#39;s<br/>
of entries were from homeschoolers and a home schooled student from <br/>
Massachusetts was the winner in 2001. The judges have been greatly <br/>
impressed <br/>
not only by the quantity of home school submissions, but<br/>
also by the outstanding quality of their essays.<br/>
<br/>
Contest officials write that this event provides &quot;some unique<br/>
rewards and recognition for the writer of the winning essay and<br/>
his or her family&quot;. These include a $100 cash award, and a<br/>
Gettysburg family vacation package for four featuring 2 nights<br/>
lodging, 5 meals, tours, and admission to many local attractions<br/>
around November 19th during the annual celebration of the<br/>
anniversary of Lincoln&#39;s Gettysburg Address. The highlight<br/>
of the experience is the opportunity for the winner to read his<br/>
or her essay at the annual luncheon of the Lincoln Fellowship of <br/>
Pennsylvania. This is a great honor. The featured speaker at this <br/>
national <br/>
event is always a well-known personality. Past speakers include Gen. <br/>
Colin <br/>
Powell and Gov. Christy Todd Whitman.<br/>
<br/>
