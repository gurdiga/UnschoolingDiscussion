<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010558484">I have just joined this group recently and have been<br/>
lurking for a couple of weeks but some of the recent<br/>
threads are so interesting I had to weigh in.<br/>
<br/>
To Dee:  Once more, and less adequately than has<br/>
already been said, you are on the right path--bonding<br/>
and growing; that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.  My DH can&#39;t<br/>
spell to save his life, nor does he write cursive<br/>
(except his signature), nor does he do many of the<br/>
things he &quot;should.&quot;  And he is the one home with our<br/>
children all day.  Why?  Because he is their father,<br/>
and except for me, loves our kids more than anyone<br/>
else on this planet.  What other qualifications does<br/>
he need?  Go for it!<br/>
<br/>
To Pam:  What a wonderful opportunity you have this<br/>
week to touch the mind of that 7 year old!  Can you<br/>
bring him shopping with you?  Barring that, get him to<br/>
help unpack the groceries and write up next week&#39;s<br/>
list, explaining why you do what you do.  Maybe he<br/>
eats Lunchables and drinks Gatorade because that&#39;s<br/>
what his parents provide and he would never dream of<br/>
questioning them.  Who knows?<br/>
<br/>
To Heidi:  My DH and I have four children (one from<br/>
DH&#39;s previous marriage) and when we moved overseas we<br/>
wrote our will.  At the time, the best choice for<br/>
guardian was my SIL and her partner, but two years<br/>
later we have decided to change to my sister, with<br/>
another sister and her husband as our second choice. <br/>
They know how we feel about unschooling and they all<br/>
have said they will try to respect our wishes, but<br/>
realistically I can&#39;t expect they will be able to<br/>
unschool &quot;the way we would.&quot;  We are, however, leaving<br/>
a list of suggestions for them should they need to put<br/>
the children in school, such as searching for a<br/>
Waldorf or other alternative type of school, and<br/>
barring all else, to send them to Catholic school (if<br/>
nothing else, they&#39;ll get a foundation in their<br/>
faith--no snickering pls &lt;g&gt;).  I don&#39;t necessarily<br/>
agree that family is the only or best way to go, but<br/>
because we are a Foreign Service family and tend to<br/>
move a lot, it is difficult to make the kinds of<br/>
lifelong friends we would make if we stayed in one<br/>
place.  So family it is.  My mother and MIL both<br/>
loudly and consistently object to our decision to<br/>
homeschool (we haven&#39;t quite let them in on the fact<br/>
that we actually unschool; I sent them some JT Gatto<br/>
material and pretty much blew their minds), so I am<br/>
not willing to leave the kids with them.  That said, I<br/>
do want our children to know their grandparents and<br/>
aunts and uncles, and to have that family circle if<br/>
for some reason something should happen to DH and me. <br/>
As for my stepson, he is in PS in Denver with his<br/>
mother and will be 18 in just over 2 years.  He is not<br/>
really our worry; his mother can take care of him if<br/>
something happens to my DH, and if something happens<br/>
to her, he likely would go with her parents since they<br/>
live in Denver as well (our family is in Chicago).<br/>
<br/>
So many choices.  Sorry for the length of this post.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Giving him the opportunity to have a voice is all I can muster right now. <br/>
LOL.  I HATE GETTING UP EARLY.  LOL.  He does have freedoms around here but <br/>
has never had them at home so goes totally crazy.  I really have to keep an <br/>
eye on things and redirect him.  LOL.  And, not sure if it is because he is a <br/>
public school child as mine were never in school, but he is so aggressive.  I <br/>
have to watch and when he tries things I say that isn&#39;t how we do things <br/>
around here, we need to talk about it and work on it until we have a solution <br/>
that works for everyone.  He is large for his age and I think he is used to <br/>
bullying (is that a word) his way around.  Pushing, shoving, yanking, biting. <br/>
 Very aggressive.  And he will try to play with my oldest and leave the <br/>
youngest out of things.  He is in between my boys.  I try to play with them <br/>
so that we all can play.  That sort of mentality.  <br/>
<br/>
The boys were playing in the family room yesterday, adjacent to the laundry <br/>
room.  He started taking all the clean clothes and throwing them everywhere.  <br/>
They were neatly stacked up.  Not sure what that was about.  He has not been <br/>
shown how to talk about things at all. So when you ask anything he shrugs his <br/>
shoulders and runs off.  I had to step in and refold the clothes.  My boys <br/>
helped some but they love this kid and really wanted to play, so I told them <br/>
to go on.  I never make my boys help me but they could see how frustrated I <br/>
was.  Anyway, this has been a trying week.  But we are making it work.  I <br/>
have decided the best idea is to take them somewhere.  We have been going to <br/>
parks and museums etc.  LOL I keep telling myself that all this is new for <br/>
him.  He has never had a say in anything.  His parents use punishment a lot <br/>
(spanking, taking things away etc).  <br/>
<br/>
It is making me grateful that we are who we are.  That our family has found a <br/>
peaceful way to live and this child is really not having a negative effect on <br/>
my boys.  They are still sweet, nice children.  <br/>
<br/>
When we were at play group he was trying to tell the boys (all of them) to <br/>
chase the girls and not to play with the girls and my boys stepped in and <br/>
introduced him and said that they wanted to all play together and they found <br/>
something that all of them could do.  <br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t change the world in a week but at least he sees that things can be <br/>
different.  He always wants to come over to play I have just never had him <br/>
for more than a day at a time before.  Oh well I am rambling again.  I seem <br/>
to be doing a lot of that.  Gotta run.  Going to the science center then to <br/>
yet another park.<br/>

<br/>
Neither set of parents would unschool.  Dh&#39;s parents would send them <br/>
to school.  My parents might attempt homeschooling, in order to <br/>
respect our wishes, but I&#39;m sure they would use some type of <br/>
curriculum.  Maybe not super-structured, but I know they would have a <br/>
need to at least teach math traditionally!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503938368">I&#39;ve been thinking about our options quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
My MIL is sick and couldn&#39;t take the kids.<br/>
<br/>
My parents shouldn&#39;t have them, but they&#39;re both retired schoolteachers <br/>
who don&#39;t understand or support what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
My older sis is childless by choice, and she and her dh are both sick.<br/>
<br/>
My older bro is VERY religious and has two pre-teen girls who aren&#39;t <br/>
allowed to read Harry Potter. He&#39;d probably get the kids :-(  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stand my younger brother, and while he&#39;s probably closer to us <br/>
(philosophically) than anyone else in the family, they&#39;re planning to <br/>
send their toddler to daycare &quot;for socialization.&quot; Which says a lot. <br/>
Besides, I&#39;d come haunt the whole family if he got my wonderful little ones.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been here only a year and don&#39;t have any prospects for alternate <br/>
parents here in Kentucky.<br/>
<br/>
Brian&#39;s godparents are in Louisiana, and are more alternative than <br/>
anyone else in the running, and they both work and have their baby in <br/>
childcare.<br/>
<br/>
I find the prospect of planning for the unspeakable to be unthinkable.<br/>
<br/>
