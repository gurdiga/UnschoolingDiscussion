<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035705922">It surprises me not one bit that while looking for some saved posts on <br/>
Halloween candy, I found something PERFECT for this discussion about food.   And it <br/>
doesn&#39;t surprise me that it was originally about TV.    That&#39;s the way <br/>
philosophy and principles are, they flow into all the cracks and spaces.<br/>

&lt;&lt;...I just can&#39;t feel ok about that....it makes me so angry....I am not<br/>
willing to subject my children...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you go back through this post and count the number of posts that are<br/>
about the mom and how SHE feels vs. those about the kids and any problems<br/>
they appear to be having, it is difficult to believe that the tv issue is<br/>
about the the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be a tv controller, diet controller, behavior and thought<br/>
controller (at least I thought I was).   I was trained as a child<br/>
psychologist....my poor kids &lt;sigh&gt;.   I no longer go with that philosophy<br/>
and have witnessed with my own eyes that limiting is the problem, not the<br/>
solution.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t even have to have &quot;smart kids&quot; for them to effectively self-<br/>
regulate.   Gee whiz, our dogs do it.   We have two dogs that were raised in <br/>
a<br/>
suburban back yard.   We now live on several acres, still anytime the gate is<br/>
left open, those dogs take off and are gone for hours.   We have two dogs<br/>
that were raised on our front porch without any fencing.   They never leave<br/>
our yard.   If a dog can figure it out, I think a child has a pretty good<br/>
shot   &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
