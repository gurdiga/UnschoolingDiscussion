<br/>
&gt; what exatly does your family do on a daily basis and are your children<br/>
&gt; required to help around the house? are they just free to run and have no<br/>
&gt; requirements on them at all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes (not often) they walk. &lt;g&gt; The requirements are that they help<br/>
clean up messes they create and are polite to each other, us, pets, and<br/>
guests (that goes both ways, we are also expected to be polite to them;<br/>
we&#39;re working on the cats, who are not always polite ;). That pretty much<br/>
covers it here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;do they have wake and sleep times that are<br/>
&gt; set?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only if we&#39;re going somewhere do I wake them up. Because they are still very<br/>
young (6 and 3) and I&#39;m not comfortable with them roaming the house while my<br/>
husband and I are both asleep, I do sometimes send them &quot;to bed&quot; when I&#39;m<br/>
going to bed -- but I&#39;m a night owl and rarely do they want to stay up later<br/>
than I do. I also remind them if we have some kind of earlier-than-usual<br/>
wakeup time (on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings we have to be out of the<br/>
house at 9 a.m., which doesn&#39;t sound early to &quot;normal&quot; folk, but is to us!<br/>
&lt;g&gt;) so they can learn the cause-and-effect of stay up late, get up early,<br/>
feel cranky. At 35, I still stay up too late even if I know I&#39;m getting up<br/>
early, so I&#39;m not real militant about &quot;making them go to sleep&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  what about computer time and tv time is it regulated ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. I&#39;m a Libertarian, the fewer regulations the better as far as I&#39;m<br/>
concerned. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how do you balance house keeping with everything else and are your children<br/>
&gt; self motivated in any way to help with the house? if so how di they get that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>way?<br/>
<br/>
Mine are not self-motivated. Yet. Or at least, rarely. Sometimes they<br/>
surprise me. I remind myself of two things: 1) If I want the house neat and<br/>
they don&#39;t, why should they do as much work as I do? and 2) I,<br/>
Pam-the-Organized, Plucky Girl Cleaner Who Feels Fussy if not Surrounded by<br/>
Order, didn&#39;t like chore lists and orders until I lived in my own house.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at this point two of my older children would do nothing for the household<br/>
&gt; at all and unless I continually remind and hound them about what I have<br/>
&gt; asked for like watering the dogs or unloading the dishwasher, they will<br/>
&gt; just play and do nothing instead they are 14 and 10 I think they should be<br/>
&gt; able to help out around here without me asking.<br/>
&gt; what are your veiws on all of this<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, regarding expectations I&#39;ll just quote the Maddeningly Sane Dr. Phil:<br/>
&quot;How&#39;s that working out for you?&quot; &lt;g&gt; Some kids are messy. Some are neat.<br/>
Some will do things without being asked, but the secret there is usually<br/>
that you have to STOP asking them, and wait for them to bloom into natural<br/>
housekeepers. This can be a long wait &lt;g&gt;. And if they aren&#39;t ever going to<br/>
be natural housekeepers (see my sister), you&#39;ll trip over their Legos until<br/>
they move out.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is going to be messy. Especially unschooling. If they were in<br/>
school, you could clean the house in an hour or so, it would STAY CLEAN<br/>
::Pam pauses to drool copiously, then sternly reminds herself that she&#39;ll<br/>
miss even the mess when her children are grown:: until they got home. Even<br/>
THEN, between homework, afterschool activities, dinner, bathtime, early<br/>
bedtime, there wouldn&#39;t be TIME to make much mess, so it would still stay<br/>
pretty clean.<br/>
<br/>
Such is not the homeschooler&#39;s life. &lt;g&gt; You can improve things by<br/>
decluttering, investing in bins, doing things like &quot;Power Cleaning&quot; as a<br/>
group, with much singing, dancing and heck, go for prizes &lt;g&gt;) for 20<br/>
minutes each morning and night (this should do for a quick pickup, vaccuum,<br/>
dishes) and do the real housework yourself (toilets, laundry, mopping), or<br/>
let them earn extra money if they want it doing things &quot;above and beyond&quot;<br/>
the 20 minute segments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I really need some insight as to attitudes  in other peoples homes not just<br/>
&gt; what you beleive would be the idealistic way to unschool but how it is<br/>
&gt; really going down in your own households!<br/>
&gt; thank you for your help in advance<br/>
&gt; I do not require any school type work from them, but do have alot of other<br/>
&gt; controlls going on that I would like to learn to let go of!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my household, my husband and I have a home business and unschool. My kids<br/>
have a fairly busy activity schedule (dance, ice skating, French, play<br/>
rehearsal, park day, Girl Scouts). Ideally, Wally and I try to get the<br/>
upstairs excavated and one major upstairs chore done every morning; then we<br/>
try to get the downstairs excavated and one major downstairs chore done<br/>
every night. Realistically, we fall short as often as we succeed. We like to<br/>
think we&#39;re modelling Real Life in this regard. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
