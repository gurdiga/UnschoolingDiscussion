How do  unschooling parents explain to well-meaning friends <br/>
or relatives why their  kids aren&#39;t in school (or learning a specific <br/>
curriculum at  home)?<br/>
<br/>

====================================<br/>
 <br/>
I have a little collection, but what I said most when Kirby was not in  <br/>
school and the others were too young to matter was &quot;We&#39;re going to see how this  <br/>
goes and if it stops working we&#39;ll put him in school.&quot;<br/>

(saved on another computer and not yet up there I have some other people&#39;s  <br/>
suggestions, and sorry they&#39;re not all saved...)<br/>
