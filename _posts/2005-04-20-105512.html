<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232213188">I was just researching fiction that my kids and I could read about unschooling.  <br/>
I just thought I&#39;d share here what I found in our library system (and Amazon&#39;s).  <br/>
It&#39;s quite long so just skip it if you&#39;re not interested in home schooling novels.  <br/>
(Only one seems to be about unschoolers, as far as I can tell).<br/>

Title : 	Surviving the Applewhites / by Stephanie S. Tolan. <br/>
Author : 	Tolan, Stephanie S. <br/>
When Jake Semple is kicked out of yet another school, the Applewhites, an <br/>
eccentric family of artists, offer to let him live with them and attend their <br/>
unstructured Creative Academy. Twelve-year-old E.D., the only non-artistic <br/>
(and organized) person in her family, feels like &quot;the invisible Applewhite&quot; and <br/>
is wary of Jake. Through Jake and E.D&#39;s alternating perspectives, Tolan (The <br/>
Face in the Mirror) introduces the outrageous titular clan. E.D.&#39;s pompous <br/>
father directs a local production of The Sound of Music, while her mother <br/>
breaks from her popular mysteries to write the Great American Novel; her <br/>
uncle carves a coffee table that her poet aunt defends to Jake, &quot;Well, you <br/>
couldn&#39;t put a cup of coffee on it, of course, but then who would want to? It&#39;s <br/>
wonderfully soul-filling, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Some of the plotting feels unfinished: <br/>
E.D. and Jake don&#39;t formally make peace and the Applewhites never come to <br/>
terms with their individual narcissism. Jake&#39;s transformation too seems <br/>
unconvincing. But humor abounds in the ever-building chaos: a writer coming <br/>
to interview E.D.&#39;s mother stays to do a slew of projects on the famous family, <br/>
including inviting a television crew to document their lives. In the end, it&#39;s the <br/>
antics of the cast of characters that keep this show on the road. Ages 10-up. <br/>

Title : 	What would Joey do? / Jack Gantos. <br/>
Author : 	Gantos, Jack. <br/>
<br/>
Modern literature&#39;s unlikely hero Joey Pigza is back in Jack Gantos&#39;s grand <br/>
finale to the award-winning trilogy that began with Joey Pigza Swallowed the <br/>
Key and the Newbery Honor book Joey Pigza Loses Control. Joey, the <br/>
sweetest, funniest kid on meds you&#39;ll ever meet, has enough trouble trying to <br/>
keep his &quot;active&quot; self together. How can he win in his new, self-assumed role <br/>
as &quot;Mr. Helpful&quot; when his divorced parents are out of control, his Grandma is <br/>
surly and morbid, and Olivia, the mean blind girl he&#39;s forced to homeschool <br/>
with, calls him a &quot;hyper retard&quot;? Even Olivia&#39;s religious mother can&#39;t save him <br/>
with her &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; refrain. As his world of flawed adults spins <br/>
around him in carnivalesque chaos, Joey has to decide on a daily basis what <br/>
he, Joey, should do. At least he has Pablo, his loyal Chihuahua mutt, his lucky <br/>
charm. Or at least he does until his maniacal father (complete with restraining <br/>
order) kidnaps the dog to lure Joey out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
Joey is a wonderful character, and his first-person narrative is both hilarious <br/>
and heartbreaking. Sadly, it is his dying grandmother who knows him best: <br/>
&quot;You know, Joey, if you didn&#39;t wear those med patches, you&#39;d just be thinking <br/>
about yourself, and you wouldn&#39;t care about making everyone happy. Your <br/>
problem is that you got better, and the rest of the world didn&#39;t.&quot; While it is more <br/>
rewarding to have read the previous Joey books before this one, it is not <br/>
mandatory. Still, all three Joey books are memorable, honest, fresh, exciting, <br/>
truly eye-opening, and should not be missed by child or adult. (Ages 10 and <br/>
older) --Karin Snelson<br/>

Title : 	Swimming in the starry river : a novel / by P. Carey Reid. <br/>
<br/>
From Publishers Weekly<br/>
A father&#39;s love for his dying daughter illuminates this heartrending first novel. <br/>
Jim Kaldy, who narrates in a careful, steady voice, tells us at the beginning <br/>
that his family&#39;s story is not an easy one. Kim and his wife Marsha&#39;s only child, <br/>
six-year-old Stella, suffers from a lethal, painful, congenital skin disease that <br/>
has has left her hideously deformed. Jim quits his job as a government <br/>
financial analyst to care for Stella, allowing Marsha to resume her career. <br/>
Forced to confront the pain and humiliation his child endures on a daily basis, <br/>
Jim takes Stella out of school to teach her at home. Yet just as Stella begins to <br/>
blossom under his care, they are faced with a difficult decision about a skin-<br/>
graft operation that could alleviate the effects of Stella&#39;s disability but would <br/>
subject her to risky side effects. Without sentimentality or melodrama, Reid <br/>
creates a harrowing yet immensely moving story. The Kaldys&#39; dilemma is <br/>
made palpably real, along with their quiet heroism in bearing the terrible <br/>
burden, and their mutual love. Drawn in by Reid&#39;s unflinching, often lyrical <br/>
prose, the reader gets through it too, and emerges humbled by this story of <br/>
ordinary people with extraordinary hearts. <br/>

Alice, I think  	<br/>
by Susan Juby <br/>
Ever since Alice arrived at first grade dressed as a hobbit and endured a <br/>
week of increasingly violent peer rejection, she has been home schooled by <br/>
her hippie mom and indifferent dad, leaving her with what her therapist calls <br/>
&quot;a shocking poverty of age-appropriate real-life experience.&quot; Now Alice&#39;s <br/>
inept new therapist, Death Lord Bob, has cornered her into agreeing to go to <br/>
the public high school. Actually, this fits right in with Alice&#39;s career aspirations <br/>
to become a cultural critic, and her eighties style statement would be working <br/>
out pretty much all right (especially after she gets a great haircut somewhat by <br/>
accident) if it weren&#39;t for her old nemesis Linda, now grown seriously <br/>
homicidal, and her two head banger henchmen. Alice&#39;s sensible observations <br/>
are a rich source of humor in this very funny first novel, as she tries to get her <br/>
life together in spite of the peculiar aberrations of the &quot;normal&quot; teen and adult <br/>
population of Smithers, a small ingrown town in British Columbia where <br/>
entertainment opportunities are limited to excuse-to-drink events like the <br/>
Northern Saddle Sores&#39; Family Trail Ride. Her mother is the kind of tie-dye <br/>
clad woman who holds a sage-burning ceremony for safety before starting out <br/>
on a back-to-school shopping trip, and her friends include bookstore owner <br/>
Corinne, who is allergic to books. Her romance-writing father&#39;s poker cronies <br/>
are equally colorful: gay but style-challenged Finn and taxi-owning Marcus, <br/>
who has a succession of twenty-years-younger girlfriends who need a ride. <br/>
When Alice&#39;s sullen girl cousin Frank arrives, a parents&#39; nightmare with her <br/>
bizarre outfits and stuffed-animal backpack filled with bottles and baggies, <br/>
Alice observes the resulting hullabaloo with amused satisfaction, and after a <br/>
hilarious, precarious car trip to a Fish Show and Drum Workshop, she finds <br/>
herself well on the way to acquiring a friend and a boyfriend. Older teens will <br/>
enjoy the story and the many descriptions of wacky clothes if they can get past <br/>
the misguided cover, a picture of five-year-old Alice&#39;s chubby hobbit-clad legs. <br/>
