Yeah, the bishop is protected from indictment regarding the child molesters<br/>
and sweeping it under the rug. I&#39;m not sure exactly why, but I think it&#39;s<br/>
because he still has not admitted actually &quot;knowing&quot; about these cases, but<br/>
signed a paper saying he did, just so he could avoid prosecution - or<br/>
somthing like that. This happened a week or so before the latest incident of<br/>
him hitting the<br/>
pedestrian.<br/>
<br/>
My sister says it&#39;s karma. That even though he techinically got out of the<br/>
trouble he was in for the whole child molester scandal, the universe just<br/>
couldn&#39;t let him get away with it that easily.<br/>
<br/>
County attorney Rick Romley says that the bishop will not receive any<br/>
special treatment for the crime he has committed (hit and run). He&#39;s been<br/>
charged with a class 4 felony (whatever that means). He faces up to 3 years<br/>
and 9 months in prison if he&#39;s convicted of leaving the scene of the<br/>
accident. He went to jail, he posted bail, he&#39;s at home now awaiting a<br/>
trial. He has resigned as bishop for Phoenix and the archbishop from Santa<br/>
Fe, NM (Michael Sheehan) is temporarily stepping in.<br/>
<br/>
My husbands family is very Catholic. This is a very sore subject with them.<br/>
My husband (and other siblings) was baptised by Thomas O&#39;Brien. This hits<br/>
home for my in-laws. My husband also says he personally knew (and worked as<br/>
altar boy) for some of the priests who have recently been charged with child<br/>
molesting many years ago. Thankfully, my husband was never a victim.<br/>

&lt;&lt;If everyone who knew about priests who were molesting children was<br/>
deprived<br/>
of freedom, prisons would burst at the seams.<br/>

You don&#39;t REALLY know much about this, and yet you&#39;re making declarations.<br/>
Because of who he is.&gt;&gt;<br/>

This kind of made me chuckle. Not in a &quot;see what happened&quot; way but I just<br/>
never would have looked at it like that. I&#39;m not really up on karma but I<br/>
get the idea.<br/>

<br/>
We recently moved to the Desert Hills area (right off of the Carefree Hwy.,<br/>
just south of Anthem). I suppose taking the 101 we&#39;d be no more than 1/2 hr<br/>
away from each other. Feel free to e-mail me if you&#39;d like!<br/>
