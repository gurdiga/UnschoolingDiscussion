&lt;&lt; Well... if one wanted to completely flip the connotation, we could talk<br/>
about &quot;premature reading&quot; and &quot;mature reading&quot;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That comes into &quot;precocious&quot; realm.  &quot;Genius&quot; or &quot;prodigy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you do something young you&#39;re godlike to some people.  Magical.  Amazing.<br/>
<br/>
And it can only be downhill from there, pretty much.<br/>
<br/>
Stevie Wonder won&#39;t ever be so cute as when he was a prodigy.<br/>
Shirley Temple grew up to be a normal adult, kinda boring.<br/>
Michael Jackson was a glory-boy until he was grown and had a life.<br/>
Michael J. Fox survived growing up because he stayed little and cute.<br/>
<br/>
HEY!  What is that?  I&#39;ve often wondered if there&#39;s any sort of growth <br/>
hormone that might turn off if kids get really famous really early.    Lots <br/>
of child stars stay small, it seems.  <br/>
<br/>
Because of research into touch and the stimulation of growth hormone in <br/>
babies (experiments in orphanages mid-20th century which said babies who <br/>
don&#39;t get held and touched won&#39;t grow as well), I&#39;ve wondered if too much <br/>
treating someone like an adult can cause their body to say &quot;Okay then, my <br/>
work here is done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another entirely different factor is the benefit of hiring an actor who looks <br/>
younger than he really is, and so they might be already small-for-age when <br/>
they get hired.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone ever heard, thought or read anything about that?  <br/>

I think this is the case. They want as mature and able to work long hours<br/>
(legally and otherwise) as they can get in the<br/>
smallest/cutest/youngest-looking package they can get.<br/>
