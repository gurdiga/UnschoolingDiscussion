<div id="ygrps-yiv-713756906">As I&#39;ve posted before, my 14 year old son periodically craves a bit of <br/>
structure. In the past, that&#39;s involved things like scheduling structured times on <br/>
my calendar where he does some more &quot;academic&quot; stuff. Today was something new.<br/>
<br/>
He has a lot of work to do for his course that he&#39;s finishing up. He had a <br/>
lot of reading to do for class tonight, and he also has a pretty demanding <br/>
take-home final he&#39;s working on, due next Thursday. He got up late, and his dad <br/>
wanted to have a rough idea if Julian was going to have time to hang out with him <br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
He got all flustered, and finally figured out that he probably didn&#39;t. Then <br/>
he started telling me he had all this stuff to do, and didn&#39;t know how to <br/>
schedule it all. Trying to lighten the mood, I, laughing, said, &quot;Want me to <br/>
schedule your day, minute by minute?&quot; He glowed and said, &quot;That would be great!&quot;  At <br/>
first I thought he was kidding, but, no...<br/>
<br/>
So I wrote down a schedule: <br/>
12-12:30 Brush teeth, eat some something, etc.<br/>
12:30-1:30 Read Appleman (one of the assignments)<br/>
1:30-1:45 Have snack and play one game of Snood<br/>
 Etc., etc.....<br/>
<br/>
And the kid DID it!!!! He was thrilled!!!! Again jokingly, I said, &quot;We could <br/>
schedule ALL your days like that.&quot;  He says, &quot;Well, maybe not ALL of them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked if he knew I was kidding, and yes, he did. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I love him dearly, and he may be a Virgo, but his Mama is a free-spirit <br/>
Aquarius, and she is NOT scheduling his days minute-by-minute, except maybe <br/>
sometimes as a Very Special Treat. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Weird kid.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn<br/>
<br/>
P.S. To clarify: Julian rarely REALLY wants his days scheduled like this, <br/>
although he does enjoy some structured time.<br/>

My Virgo is going back to school. Her unschooling life is more than <br/>
she can handle. I think she goes back more self confident and ready <br/>
to question.. But for crying out loud her Gemini mother does not <br/>
know how to always handle a kids who wants that much structure <br/>
either. Her decision to back to PS was tough for me, but my feeling <br/>
is I just need to support what she needs. <br/>
However your post made me laugh and laugh.. Megan want me to make <br/>
her run.. Not gonna happen.. I am happy to suggest if she would <br/>
like, but she wants me to make her..Freedom is not her favorite <br/>
thing.<br/>

is naturally happening so when you gave him a chance to pig out he did :-)<br/>
<br/>
Could be you&#39;ve given him the impetus to do it on his own!<br/>
