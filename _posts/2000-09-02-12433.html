&lt;&lt; does anyone have any <br/>
suggestions as to how to handle situations that arrise when DH is <br/>
dealing with the children in a manner that I totally disagree with &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i know that hubby can feel criticized when spoken to about these things, so <br/>
tread carefully!  i would have to focus on the things he does with the <br/>
children that you adore and appreciate for a while before i would approach <br/>
these others.  it sounds cowardly, but really it is just being sensitive to <br/>
the fact that dh is only around a small period of time, and your desire for <br/>
their relationship to be positive.  i have had to be encouraging, realizing <br/>
that dh&#39;s training (upbringing plus other influences) in the matter has been <br/>
waaaayyy different than my own.  other than that i just share what i find <br/>
helpful (when dealing with the kids) and why.  but good comunication skills <br/>
are paramount (duh, i know we all know that!) as we all can be so fragile <br/>
inside.  no one wants to feel attacked, or that their spouse thinks they are <br/>
inept with the kiddos.  also, what i have found, as our family has grown, is <br/>
that some of dh&#39;s techniques that i cringed at when seen before, are now <br/>
quite effective with our group of children.  i guess i mean stay respectful <br/>
of each other in the discussion, realizing there may be a time and place for <br/>
something that is inappropriate at this time.</div>
