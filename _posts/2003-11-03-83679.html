<div id="ygrps-yiv-585201847">Hi all,<br/>
    I just have to add my two cents prefacing my comments by declaring my<br/>
bias as a person who leans toward obsessive complusive ie &quot;addictive&quot;<br/>
behavior. I do limit my kids&#39; sugar consumption for multiple reasons, not<br/>
the least of which is a family history of diabetes/ late onset which is<br/>
directly related to over intake of refined carbohydrates and insulin<br/>
resistence.... my kids recognize that when they do eat a ton of sugar (say<br/>
after a birthday party or what have you) they feel physically ill and<br/>
grumpy...   My 7 yo naturally doesn&#39;t care for refined sugar, he will choose<br/>
an apple over birthday cake every time. Our family candy rule is 3 pieces<br/>
per day after a healthy meal... (and they are welcome to throw away and try<br/>
again if they hate something, so it&#39;s actually 3...).<br/>
    They are 9 and 7 and they have no problem with limits.on TV, movies,<br/>
computer time, candy consumption, etc. I think the thing to consider about<br/>
&quot;limits&quot; is how they are implemented... the negative effects of limits, eg<br/>
&quot;rebound&quot; behavior such as the gorging on video games or candy that have<br/>
been mentioned are more likely to occur when the limits are imposed without<br/>
rational explanation and discussion, especially in families where rules of<br/>
all kinds tend to get imposed and enforced arbitrarily.  In our family we<br/>
all agree that there are good reasons to limit some behaviors and to try<br/>
lots of different activities.  But we do this in an atmosphere of mutual<br/>
respect and always with lots of discussion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see a number of flaws in your reasoning. I suspect that you don&#39;t want<br/>
them pointed out and just want it known that you don&#39;t agree with what&#39;s<br/>
being said because you have reasons that make sense to you.<br/>
<br/>
But, this is a discussion list and the purpose of the list is to hold ideas<br/>
up to examination and to help people make rational decisions. If anyone<br/>
doesn&#39;t want their ideas examined, its best not to post them.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I see:<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are overweight then you&#39;re offering general advice based on a<br/>
nongeneral situation. (There *are* other options besides control even for<br/>
special circumstances.)<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are not overweight, then you are imposing a solution to a<br/>
problem that you only fear may exist in the future.<br/>
<br/>
If by late onset diabetes you mean type 2, the connection isn&#39;t directly to<br/>
sugar but to being overweight. The problem is taking in too many calories<br/>
and not expending enough and becoming overweight. Being overweight doesn&#39;t<br/>
cause type 2 diabetes, e.g. all overweight people become diabetic, but being<br/>
overweight seems to be a factor.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they aren&#39;t drawn to sugar, then why limit it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They are 9 and 7 and they have no problem with limits.on TV, movies,<br/>
&gt; computer time, candy consumption, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If by &quot;no problem&quot; you mean they don&#39;t complain, depending on personality<br/>
and family atmosphere, some kids will learn that complaining isn&#39;t worth the<br/>
effort.<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;no problem&quot; you mean that without limits they choose the way you<br/>
would choose for them, then why have limits?<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;d be concerned, though, if my daughter were making the same decisions I<br/>
would. It would suggest to me that she was memorizing rules rather than<br/>
learning what&#39;s right for her by experimentation. We try to help people see<br/>
that children will choose what&#39;s right for *them*, though, not choose what<br/>
we&#39;d choose for them. They *will* choose differently. But they won&#39;t eat<br/>
nothing but sugar and fat, and won&#39;t do nothing but watch TV and play video<br/>
games.)<br/>
<br/>
Some people, such as those who are naturally drawn to rules, who live under<br/>
limitations accept the rules and stick to them. They live in fear and the<br/>
rules are like talismans that will keep the boogeyman away. What happens<br/>
when they are faced with new situations that they don&#39;t have rules in place<br/>
for? People often extrapolate from the nonsense and extend the rules. But<br/>
rational thought would reveal shoddy foundations for decision making.<br/>
<br/>
If the reasons behind rules make sense, then there isn&#39;t a reason to make a<br/>
rule. But people who follow rules, aren&#39;t learning how to make decisions.<br/>
They are only learning to follow someone else&#39;s rules.<br/>
<br/>
If the reasons behind rules are nonsense, then people memorize nonsense and<br/>
use that as a foundation for decision making.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids have memorized that too much sugar will cause diabetes so it&#39;s<br/>
good to avoid sugar, they&#39;ve memorized nonsense and are basing decisions on<br/>
nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
If they recognize that sugar will make them feel yucky, then, without rules,<br/>
they are free to decide each time if the future yucky feeling is worth it or<br/>
not. They&#39;ll be listening to their bodies, not a rule they&#39;ve memorized.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If they are memorizing rules that say any time beyond x spent on TV, movies,<br/>
computer is damaging, then they&#39;re memorizing your responses to your fears<br/>
not listening to their bodies or coming to rational decisions through trial<br/>

&lt;&lt; I do limit my kids&#39; sugar consumption for multiple reasons.... my kids <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re trying to convey a simple piece of important information:<br/>
<br/>
If you stop limiting, they will eventually (perhaps right away, depending in <br/>
party on how limiting you were being) NOT eat a ton of sugar.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They are 9 and 7 and they have no problem with limits.on TV, movies,<br/>
<br/>
computer time, candy consumption, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are kids who have no problem with lots of spankings and being shamed <br/>
and grounded.  Or at least they have no problems at first.  As they get older <br/>
and the parents can no longer control them physically or verbally, that&#39;s whey <br/>
the results surface.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think the thing to consider about<br/>
<br/>
&quot;limits&quot; is how they are implemented... the negative effects of limits, eg<br/>
<br/>
&quot;rebound&quot; behavior such as the gorging on video games or candy that have<br/>
<br/>
been mentioned are more likely to occur when the limits are imposed without<br/>
<br/>
rational explanation and discussion&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;rational explanation&quot; you mean justification for parental control, <br/>
then the negative effects can come about with an added layer of loss of respect <br/>
for the parents&#39; veracity and judgment.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In our family we all agree that there are good reasons to limit some <br/>
behaviors&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With younger children, agreement is easy to come by.  Kids will agree to just <br/>
about anything.   Most of the people in this culture would agree with your <br/>
good reasons, too.<br/>
<br/>
There were good reasons and rational explanations for estrogen replacement in <br/>
menopausal women.  It made their bones stronger.  It made them look younger.  <br/>
It aided and abetted (if not caused) breast cancer.  But the breast cancer <br/>
was coming years later, and those pushing the estrogen were looking at the <br/>
window right at menopause.   Still, by many, the cancer is looked at as a separate <br/>
set of data.<br/>
<br/>
And same with people who look at teens with certain obsessive behaviors or <br/>
bad judgment and they like to blame lots of things (bad choice of friends is a <br/>
fave), but behavior comes from thought and attitude sometimes (cognitive stuff, <br/>
which is why adults can change their attitudes, rationals and actions and <br/>
improve their lives) and from reactionary stuff to internalized messages and the <br/>
way we&#39;re treated (subconscious stuff).<br/>
<br/>
One of the message children who are controlled get even if the parents don&#39;t <br/>
understand they&#39;re doing it is that the children are wrong.  Their desires and <br/>
wants are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If candy is limited to three, and children eat three, parents assume they <br/>
would have eaten four without the limit.   When candy is unlimited, children <br/>
rarely eat three.  They often won&#39;t even eat one.   That probably sounds <br/>
wrongheaded and bogus to someone who&#39;s convinced her limits are saving her children, <br/>
but those who have given it an honest trial run come back here and say &quot;you were <br/>
right.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
If they&#39;re already familiar with this and your family&#39;s history, why isn&#39;t <br/>
that just another factor in their long list of factors that helps them decide <br/>
what they should eat and when?  Setting that limit for them doesn&#39;t help them <br/>
any.  You won&#39;t be there when they&#39;re 50 if they *do* develop Type II diabetes <br/>
to make them stop eating the sugary snacks that diabetics seem to crave.  How <br/>
is limiting them going to teach them to make that decision for themselves?<br/>
<br/>
My son also has a family history of diabetes to contend with.  This morning <br/>
he asked for waffles--we didn&#39;t have any frozen and I don&#39;t like making <br/>
homemade--so he settled on French toast.  Then he said, &quot;Can I get some scrambled <br/>
eggs with that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He *knows* he needs protein to keep going, because he *knows* his grandmother <br/>
and most of her 9 brothers are (or were) Type II diabetics.  He also knows <br/>
how he feels an hour or two after a stack of waffles.  He&#39;ll be 10 in 2 days.  <br/>
He listens to his body, and considers other factors as well.  <br/>

Maybe diabetes is more a lack of protein than &quot;over intake of carbohydrates.&quot;<br/>

When a pregnant mom is declared to have &quot;gestational diabetes,&quot; if she eats a <br/>
bunch of protein it will change the next reading.  Huh.  The &quot;treatment&quot; for <br/>

number two:  eat a lot of protein.<br/>

Casey has been counting fiber grams for the past few days. She had <br/>
been having tummy aches and after much investigating I proposed that <br/>
lack of fiber might be the cause. So in amongst Halloween candy, <br/>
bagels and pasta, she is making sure to get her 5 fruits and veggies, <br/>
nuts, beans and whole grains. She feels like she&#39;s discovered this <br/>
amazing health trick.<br/>
<br/>
Conor (14) is not paying attention to the same cues. &lt;g&gt; He&#39;s almost <br/>
finished with his candy and is just starting to come back to the real <br/>
world of eating. He&#39;s always been open to nourishing foods and will <br/>
basically eat whatever I put in front of him. Now that his Halloween <br/>
feast is over, I&#39;ll be sure to put more fresh and nourishing food in <br/>
his path.<br/>

this is true. From the reading I&#39;ve been doing on it (diabetic mother and <br/>
clear signs of insulin resistance in me) it&#39;s the carbs that get processed <br/>
too quickly into pure sugar that are the problem, the ones with a high <br/>
glycemic index. The body puts out insulin in response to them, and the <br/>
sugars get stored in the cells. Eventually the cells can&#39;t store any more <br/>
sugar, and the insulin can&#39;t do it&#39;s job properly anymore. (I understand it <br/>
enough for myself, but probably not quite well enough to explain it yet, <br/>
and there&#39;s more to it than that.)  I think the reason for eating more <br/>
protein (and the good fats) is that they slow down the conversion of carbs <br/>
to pure sugar. The fat that&#39;s associated with diabetes is the fat around <br/>
the middle rather than simple overweight.<br/>

foods you can eat because of the trans fats. The latest research is showing <br/>
that trans fats are horrible for you. And the companies that manufacture it <br/>
know that. You know how everyone thinks that coconut oil is really bad for <br/>
you? Well the tests were done on refined coconut oil. Turns out that <br/>
unrefined coconut oils can be good for you.<br/>
<br/>
I switched from marg to butter a while ago and use olive oil or coconut oil <br/>
for cooking. If you want to get your protein and good fats together, <br/>
avocados and nuts are a good source, as long as the nuts aren&#39;t rancid. <br/>
Rancid fats are one of the worst things you can eat.<br/>

reduces the risk of both diabetes and obesity, which is a factor in <br/>
diabetes.  There are also studies that are beginning to show that <br/>
children who are breastfeed have better eating habits, eat a wider <br/>
variety of foods, and are more open to trying new foods.   There are <br/>
very real things that you can do to help reduce the risk of diabetes, <br/>
right now, even if you did not breastfeed for the two years currently <br/>
being recommended by the World Health Organization.  You can model good <br/>
eating habits yourself.  You can exercize yourself.  You can provide an <br/>
atmosphere for your children where foods are not &quot;forbidden or limited <br/>
fruit&quot; but instead are simply a part of a wide variety of foods <br/>
available for consumption.<br/>

&gt; been mentioned are more likely to occur when the limits are imposed <br/>
&gt; without<br/>
&gt; rational explanation and discussion, especially in families where rules of<br/>
&gt; all kinds tend to get imposed and enforced arbitrarily.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree. <br/>
<br/>
Personally I trust my children to set their own limits. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In our family we<br/>
&gt; all agree that there are good reasons to limit some behaviors and to try<br/>
&gt; lots of different activities.  But we do this in an atmosphere of mutual<br/>
&gt; respect and always with lots of discussion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is good but if the final decision is made by the adult, the kids <br/>
know this and realize that their opinions and needs are not as important <br/>
as the adults. <br/>

well, I&#39;ve seen just exactly the opposite happen. Candy/sweets is one <br/>
thing we&#39;ve never stressed about. If there&#39;s some in the house, it <br/>
isn&#39;t a big deal if the kids eat it. And they usually eat it all. For <br/>

it all gone.<br/>

cookies, etc. My husband has an amazing sweet tooth and brings the <br/>
stuff home a lot. In this house it has NEVER been limited, unless I&#39;m <br/>
making a nice dinner. Then, no snacks within an hour before dinner <br/>

dinner that I&#39;d prefer they come to the table hungry enough to eat <br/>
it. :)<br/>

sugar. My youngest uses iced tea as a vehicle for sugar: about three <br/>

ones will dip into the honey...a spoon or a finger...many different <br/>
times per day. I&#39;ve had to ask them to stop that, as honey is very <br/>
expensive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875613529">Here is a guess, and it doesn&#39;t unfortunately come with a solution, but it seems to me that your children might feel limited by the speed of consumption by other children -- i.e., the dynamic is you&#39;d better eat it RIGHT NOW because if you don&#39;t someone else will? I can remember feeling that way about  limited-quantity foods where it wouldn&#39;t be easy to just make more (like, for example, take-out pizza) when I was 6 or 7. <br/>
<br/>
 Do they feel that they can cause candy to appear whenver they want to(write it on the shopping list, cause a special trip to be made to buy candy, etc.) or does it appear only at adult wishes?  Is there candy all the time -- or just some times?  What does &quot;a lot&quot; mean for bringing candy home? <br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was 3 or 4, I remember we went through a period when she needed to have more than she could possibly eat (of whatever -- pasta, grapes, candy, anything really) on her plate before she would eat.  Then she would stop when full -- not eating it all.  My working guess was that she wanted to feel secure that she really would be able to eat as much as she wanted.  Sometime in the last couple of years she stopped doing that - but I wonder if it is a somehow related phenomenon? <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I dont&#39; know.  I guess all we can say is what works for us, and hope that it is advice useful for other people to at least try. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927458576">I have a bag of Halloween candy and I have been eating WAY more than my kids. <br/>
I think sometimes people indulge.  My thinking is that I am pregnant and its <br/>
a craving. If someone limited my consumption I would think this faze I am in <br/>
would last much longer out of spite.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking in their shoes is often helpful. <br/>
If you where told that you where only allowed to eat candy once a year or so <br/>
would you be longing for it more or sneaking it? I know I would, I know did as <br/>
a child.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that there are some things that we bring into the house that we <br/>
just haven&#39;t bought in a while. Whatever it may be gets consumed quick and if I <br/>
keep buying it because they liked it after a week or so they just stop eating <br/>
it or even opening it.  None of our kids are fat, its not about consume like <br/>
its the last time it will be available again.<br/>
<br/>
Take parents who freak at the candy isles in stores. When we go to the store <br/>
the little one may ask for something but because I dont make a stink about it <br/>
she doesn&#39;t need or want every time. Some kids wait the entire shopping trip <br/>
until they get to the isle and have their parents say no. Imagine the reaction, <br/>
we have all see it im sure.<br/>

*******************************************<br/>
Heidi, how many kids do you have in the house?  My kids are pretty much the <br/>
same way at times, but we have 7.  I try to make huge helpings of whatever I <br/>
make (usually tripling recipes!) so that there&#39;s enough for seconds.  It seems, <br/>
when there&#39;s tons (like restaurant size pot of spaghetti) they might take <br/>
seconds, might not, and I usually end up with leftovers.  But when I am low on <br/>
something and I make a smaller pot or dinner, EVERYONE wants seconds...it&#39;s <br/>
almost like they have a fear someone will get all the rest before they do.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the reason my kids are the way they are with sweets (like yours) is <br/>
because I usually don&#39;t make as big a batch??  It seems if I make like 4 loaves <br/>
of Bananna bread, then they only want a few slices and it won&#39;t even be <br/>
finished.  Or cookies.  But if we only get a couple boxes of little debbie snacks <br/>
they want to eat them all right then and there.  Seems when there&#39;s no &quot;fear&quot; <br/>
that the food will run out before they get a little bit more, they aren&#39;t as <br/>
desperate to gorge on it (this is especially true of the foster kids, 2 of who <br/>
their grandfather locked the food away in padlocked kitchen cupboards.)  <br/>
<br/>
I know too, for me, when I&#39;m on a low carb diet, the sweet craving is <br/>
TERRIBLE...until I haven&#39;t had any sweets for a few days.  But as soon as I have a <br/>
small candy or cookie, BOOM...the cravings come back stronger than before.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like Tia&#39;s answer better. Mine&#39;s just a poorly worded version of current<br/>
but conventional medical thought. Here&#39;s what I was trying to say:<br/>
<br/>
Obesity seems to be a factor in developing type 2 diabetes in those that are<br/>
predisposed.<br/>
<br/>
Obesity is increasing and so is the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Maybe the<br/>
link between them isn&#39;t a direct link but a common link.<br/>
<br/>
Obesity doesn&#39;t cause type 2 diabetes. (My 300 pound aunt whose most<br/>
strenuous form of exercise was wandering about her tiny apartment with her<br/>
walker lived into her 90&#39;s with no diabetes.)<br/>
<br/>
I know thin people can have type 1 (juvenile) diabetes, but one website<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes_types/diabetes_type_2.php)">http://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes_types/diabetes_type_2.php)</a> said having<br/>
an &quot;apple figure&quot; (carrying excess weight around your middle) is almost<br/>
universal in type 2 (adult onset) diabetes.<br/>
<br/>
Type 1 is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the cells that create<br/>
insulin so insulin needs replaced. Type 2 is caused by insulin resistance.<br/>
The body still produces insulin but something prevents the cells from<br/>
absorbing and using it.<br/>

Margarine, for example, is a hydorgenated fat, it&#39;s heated/chemically altered <br/>
to become solid, and that process creates transfatty acids, which is not <br/>
healthy.  I personally use butter for flavor, and olive oil, and a straight up <br/>

margarine.  <br/>

all&quot;, and see what happens. Keep the candy jar 100% filled all <br/>
the time, with some kind of candy.<br/>
<br/>
What will happen is that each family member will eat what they <br/>
actually want, after the novelty has worn off, instead of hording it <br/>
because it might run out, like your older one is doing now. If they <br/>
can&#39;t eat &quot;it all&quot;, they can finally get their fill.<br/>
<br/>
We have a almost-never-ending candy bowl (sometimes we do <br/>
run out, just like we run out of milk or fruit, but it&#39;s kept stocked in <br/>
general, just like milk or fruit). We also have a wide variety of <br/>
other food, sweet and not, available all the time.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters eat what most would consider quite a lot of candy. <br/>
They also often choose to eat not-candy things, many of them <br/>
what anyone would consider &quot;healthy&quot;. Both of them are healthy, <br/>
active, cheerful, strong, trustworthy, brave, kind, etc.<br/>

kind your body makes. It&#39;s the kind your body makes that&#39;s bad for your <br/>
heart and blood vessels, and that&#39;s apparently caused by too much insulin <br/>
being produced because of too much sugar and high-glycemic index food intake.<br/>

We have candy somewhere always.   Our neighbors gave us their leftover <br/>
give-away candy.  She said, &quot;We knew since you have teenage boys it will be gone in <br/>
no time.&quot;  I smiled.  She was wrong.   It will go to replenish our <br/>
already-existing stuff.<br/>

We only got 21 trick or treaters.  Keith learned years ago only to get candy <br/>
WE like so we are glad to have leftovers.  It does go very very slowly, though.<br/>

was with my two previous.  I&#39;ve tested negative all along even though I had <br/>
gestational diabetes with the first two.  I check it once a week for a fasting <br/>
number and a couple of times a week after meals.  And I have had three glucose <br/>
challenges at the doctor&#39;s office.   I can have a Big Mac meal with fries and a <br/>
diet coke with no problem on my one hour reading.  But maybe that&#39;s because I <br/>
eat mostly protein the rest of the time.  I told my midwife that I don&#39;t seem <br/>

their bodies at 4 and 5.  It took me until 38 or 39.  They made the better <br/>
choice.<br/>

I try to make huge helpings of whatever I <br/>
make (usually tripling recipes!) so that there&#39;s enough for seconds.  It <br/>

when there&#39;s tons (like restaurant size pot of spaghetti) they might take <br/>
seconds, might not, and I usually end up with leftovers.  But when I am low <br/>
on <br/>
something and I make a smaller pot or dinner, EVERYONE wants seconds...it&#39;s <br/>
almost like they have a fear someone will get all the rest before they do.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Scarcity of resources causes them to hoard.  When I&#39;m selling Camp Fire <br/>
candy, I create an artificial scarcity by only putting a few boxes out on the <br/>
table, maybe only one of a certain kind.  I always &quot;sell out&quot; of that kind before <br/>
the others.  If I truly have only a few left of a certain kind I can mention <br/>
that and sell out of that kind quicker, too.  It&#39;s like that Rice Krispie Treat <br/>
commercial.  &quot;Last one!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Supply and demand and all that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well, they get a weekly allowance and they usually buy candy and/or <br/>
pokemon cards with it. Hubby buys a couple of snicker bars a week, <br/>
I&#39;d say. Or at any rate, every two weeks he brings home a &quot;3 for a <br/>
dollar&quot; special on them. We share and share alike, cutting a candy <br/>
bar into fifths so everyone gets an equal amount...or, sometimes, cut <br/>
the three snickers into five equal parts...I sometimes have a stash <br/>
of special dark in my undie drawer, and if the kids say &quot;you have any <br/>
chocolate?&quot; I get it out and we have some. (Keep in undie drawer to <br/>
save it from the kids eating it all in one day...Or myself, for that <br/>

before she would eat.  Then she would stop when full -- not eating it <br/>

<br/>
A full candy bowl isn&#39;t expensive once the kids stop eating it.<br/>
When people hear about leaving candy out all the time I think they calculate <br/>
the cost and amount on what kids eat when it&#39;s NOT out.  That rate can slow to <br/>
a near stop.<br/>
