<div id="ygrps-yiv-181243858">Hi, Kim again, promise to shut up soon!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Mary&#39;s last mail about standing in lines brought a memory back that still<br/>
makes me mad.<br/>
<br/>
Last year when we moved here I went to the school&#39;s to borrow books for<br/>
homeschooling. As I was walking in to the office, a class of children and<br/>
their teacher were walking in from recess.  One child told another he was<br/>
going to kick his a@@.  I was horrified and thought for the teacher, about<br/>
three feet away, would surely put him in his place.  Nope.  The line<br/>
continued on into to the school so that the children could be good little<br/>
soldiers and sit at their desks and &quot;learn&quot;.<br/>
