<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840139370">Thanks to all,<br/>
It really helps to &quot;listen&quot;.  I know all of what you all said.  Why do I<br/>
push it then?<br/>
I think I will crawl in bed tonight my my son and see what he thinks<br/>
about continuing.  I&#39;m pretty sure he won&#39;t want to, and I think that&#39;s<br/>
best.<br/>
We&#39;ve had a crazy life here lately.  For the last six months we have<br/>
been adding on to our house.  All five of us are in one bedroom, which<br/>
really isn&#39;t that bad, its just we have no room for stuff!  Then my<br/>
Mother has had knee replacement surgery, so she is down and in need of<br/>
help.  We all live on the same farm, she is just up the driveway from<br/>
us.  That leaves us with all the animal care.  We are also relanscaping<br/>
everything around the house.<br/>
I&#39;m about to go nuts!<br/>
We don&#39;t get in the house until 9-10 and then are trying to figure out<br/>
what we are going to have for dinner.<br/>
I went slack on barn chores today, and the kids have already been fed.<br/>
I&#39;ve got to get to bed earlier tonight.<br/>
I can&#39;t hardly stay awake to read a couple chapters to the kids.<br/>
Thanks for listening all.......<br/>
I love this list.  I feel kinda far away from all of you though... seems<br/>
everyone is on the west coast or in PA.  :)<br/>
Anyone near NC?<br/>

closer! You don&#39;t have TIME FOR US!! Silly girl! We&#39;ll just be here on the<br/>

Hey! I am not real close, but kinda close, Florida here.  My dad has a place <br/>
in Waynesville NC and I used to live in Knoxville Tenn.  So, we are kinda <br/>
close!!<br/>

Yes, we usually come up about every other year for Christmas.  We also go on <br/>
over to Gatlinburg and Knoxville to visit.  But either this year or next year <br/>
I want to come up in October so the boys can see the leaves change, don&#39;t get <br/>
that down here in South Fla., and I want to take them to Cades Cove in the <br/>
Smokies.  If we come up this year, we could surely find somewhere to meet!  <br/>

ever come here?  You could stop for a visit!<br/>

I have a hard time finding time to get together with our local group.  (A<br/>
great group of people)  But, we like to spend alot of time here at home<br/>
anyway, we are not big socializers.  Besides, my kids are their own best<br/>
friends.  Just another benefit of homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706173624">That would be fun.  It is beautiful here toward mid to end of Oct.<br/>
I also used to live in Naples, FL.  Know it?  I missed the seasons so much.<br/>
Cades Cove is beautiful.  I love it there.  Been there lots.  Gatlinburg is very<br/>
touristy, but everyone should experience that some time, and when you get sick of<br/>
it you can head into cades cove for some hiking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999151756">Hey,<br/>
yes I know where Naples is, we travel thru there if we go north on alligator <br/>
alley.  <br/>
I really miss the seasons it is so dull down here! At least right now we are <br/>
getting rain, thank goodness!  But only about a 2 day winter and no colors<br/>
<br/>
I know Gatlinburg is touristy, but it is fun for the boys and I love Pidgeon <br/>
Forge.  but my fav. is the cove, did you ever go on a hay ride around the <br/>
loop at night?  I don&#39;t even know if they still do that but they did 15 years <br/>
ago.  It is so neat, they use hand held lights and shine them into the grass, <br/>
you see all the wildlife.  Oh rats! this is making me homesick!  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Never did that, but sounds great!  I don&#39;t know if they do that or not.  I did go<br/>
once during the time of year when the deer are there in herds.  It wasn&#39;t  worth<br/>
it.  Millions of cars bumper to bumper.  Yuck.  I&#39;m going to have to take my kids<br/>
soon.  They are old enough that I&#39;d only have  to carry one once in awhile!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I know the homesick feeling.  I never could get used to FL.  I grew up in<br/>
Chicago, and WI, and I couldn&#39;t handle FL.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I grew up in Fl. then moved to Tenn.  Lived there for 15 years and loved it.  <br/>
Even though I grew up here I still hate it.  Would never have moved back <br/>
except that dh was living here and had a business here.  Oh well, what love <br/>
will make you do!!!<br/>
