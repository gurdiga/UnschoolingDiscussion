<br/>
Interdependence and consensual living are both processes of<br/>
interacting with others, innate processes. The constructs of power<br/>
and independence are *learned* processes of living separately from<br/>
others. The use of power and fear in relationships can not create<br/>
connectivity or love. It is precisely the use of coercion that<br/>
destroys the desire for interdependence. Can one live without<br/>
connectivity or love?<br/>
<br/>
Pat&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This thread has repeatedly drawn me back to an early 20th C. quote I read<br/>
recently from Irish Nationalist Sir Roger Casement, who was eventually<br/>
executed by the British government for his part in the Easter Uprising of<br/>
1916.  It has become a part of my quotation library, and might be a good<br/>
addition to this discussion on democracy in general and how it relates to<br/>
interpersonal relationships in specific.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not hard to replace the words, &quot;the governing of Ireland by England&quot;<br/>
with something like, &quot;the management of an autocratic family...&quot; and get a<br/>
real feel for what we&#39;re talking about here, universal themes being what<br/>
they are.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Loyalty is a sentiment, not a law.  It rests on love, not on restraint.<br/>
The governing of Ireland by England rests on restraint and not on love; and<br/>
since it demands no love, it can evoke no loyalty.&quot;  Sir Roger Casement,<br/>
1916<br/>
<br/>
This quotation and this discussion have struck me so deeply because my<br/>
family is currently struggling with what it means to respond appropriately<br/>
to the extended end-of-life needs of an extremely autocratic father.  My<br/>
siblings and I well recognize a strong sense of responsibility, but I, for<br/>
one, cannot get my heart into it, and this causes me much guilt.<br/>
<br/>
I realize when I contemplate this passage and part of the one above (&quot;The<br/>
use of power and fear in relationships cannot create connectivity or<br/>
love.&quot;), that there is no sense of connection or loyalty for me in this<br/>
situation.  There may be the requisite sense of &quot;love,&quot; but it is a shallow<br/>
thing, rooted in a sense of familial responsibility, not in a deep sense of<br/>
the desire for interconnectivity.<br/>
<br/>
I know what I have done and continue to do to foster a true and deep love<br/>
and loyalty between my dh and I and our children -- I have tried, very<br/>
consciously, to build something fruitful out of the aridity of the past, but<br/>
what of my responsibility to my father?  I honestly feel no loyalty to him,<br/>
and yet...<br/>
<br/>
It is how we face these truths and act on them that we are prepared for the<br/>
tests of the future with our own families.  It is how I act here that my<br/>
children take clues as to how to act with me when my time comes, down the<br/>
road, is it not?<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you faced these questions?  And what have you done?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Laura B.</div>

<br/>
My mom died last fall.  She was verbally abusive and dishonest to the end <br/>
(sprinkled with momentary attempts to express gratitude or tenderness).  All the <br/>
kids saw her twice before she died, and Holly and I saw her several times, <br/>
going nearly every day to take care of her at her apartment, deliver/pick up <br/>
laundry, do her dishes, change her bed, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It is how I act here that my children take clues as to how to act with me <br/>
when my time comes, down the road, is it not?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids know many stories of how my mom was with me, and they have their own <br/>
experiences with her, too.    If their feelings about me are as mixed as mine <br/>
were about my mom, that will be about the way I treated them, not about the <br/>
way I treated my mom.   When my mom was dying, I thought very little about her <br/>
relationship with her own mom.    Though my mom travelled 600 miles to attend <br/>
my granny&#39;s funeral, she got drunk and decided not to go, instead, once she was <br/>
at the house.   That did comfort me when I decided not to be there when my <br/>
mom&#39;s ashes were scattered.  I did take care of the cremation and get the ashes <br/>
to my sister.<br/>
<br/>
What I did and thought, Laura, in those last days was that I needed to do <br/>
enough to keep me from regretting my actions for the rest of my life.  I <br/>
accomplished that.  It wasn&#39;t easy, and her best friend who was supposed to be helping <br/>
wasn&#39;t as much help as she offered to be.  My mom had lied different lies to <br/>
both of us, though, and tried to set us against one another (inexplicable, <br/>
irrational, typical).  So for my sake and Holly&#39;s, I helped her a lot the last <br/>
few weeks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488270709">This above all: to thine own self be true,<br/>
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br/>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	-- William Shakespeare<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is one of my guiding principles.<br/>
<br/>
What specifically are you having to decide? Whether to use artificial <br/>
means of life support? What are his wishes? Honor those reguardless <br/>
of your own wishes or connection. For example, my husband <br/>
wants &quot;everything done&quot; in the case of dire health situations. I <br/>
myself, having been a critical care nurse for years, know I do not <br/>
want to suffer indefinitely, and have a notorized Living Will. <br/>
Despite our differences in desires, we both will honor our individual <br/>
wishes. We fortunately have discussed these many times, with <br/>
clarifications as each new consideration has arisen.<br/>
<br/>
As most people haven&#39;t the foreknowledge of another&#39;s wishes in this <br/>
end-of-life situation, generally the medical field assumes <br/>
that &quot;everything&quot; must be done. If you feel that you can be objective <br/>
about considering what his wishes might have been, such as from <br/>
discussions or comments about others in similar situations, <br/>
communicate his probable wishes to his medical team. If you feel that <br/>
you can not be objective due to your own issues with him, remove <br/>
yourself from the decision making process. My father and I are more <br/>
than estranged, in no way could I be objective in these decisions <br/>
unless his wishes were in writing; therefore, I would not participate <br/>
in the process. <br/>
<br/>
As far as modeling for your family, if you have not been true to <br/>
yourself about your relationship with your father than you could not <br/>
have been true to them either. I realized that I was falsely <br/>
representing my father as a trusted member of our family to our son, <br/>
when this was not true. Sadly and with great difficulty, I decided to <br/>
remove my father from our lives. I knew that this was the only way to <br/>
be true to myself and to my family. The example of disconnecting was <br/>
horrifically troubling, but the prospect of being dishonest to my <br/>
family about my relationship to my father was far worse. (sexual <br/>
abuse)<br/>
<br/>
If the decision is related to his extended personal care, such as in <br/>
your home. The above holds true. If you haven&#39;t been honest about the <br/>
relationship with yourself, it is difficult to have been honest with <br/>
your family. My father and I superficially had a relationship, <br/>
but &quot;made nice&quot; whenever we were together. This won&#39;t work 24/7. <br/>
Depending on the age of your family members, each can understand <br/>
various elements of your truth. <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, my husband was emotionally and financially devoted to <br/>
his mother, but she still didn&#39;t live with us her last years of life. <br/>
We did everything we personally decided was best for our immediate <br/>
family but having her live with us would not have been a healthy <br/>
situation, in our opinion. Practical, financial, emotional, <br/>
psycological reasons. OUR reasons, only you know what is best for <br/>
you. Inquire about your families thoughts, concerns, suggestions, <br/>
opinions. Questioning yourself and them about their individual needs <br/>
will guide you.<br/>

sister are seriously pressing to bring him back here to Houston -- to <br/>
live with my brother and his wife near me, where I would be expected <br/>
to contribute to his care on a daily basis, as I &quot;don&#39;t work&quot; -- <br/>
until he is either able to live again independently or (more likely) <br/>
dies.  It could be years.  He is not in life-threatening <br/>
circumstances now, but he has nowhere else to go during long-term <br/>
rehab than a nursing home in CA, and my brother and sister cannot, <br/>
apparently, live with that option.  I would just as soon leave him <br/>
there, frankly.  It&#39;s cold, but he hasn&#39;t cared about us for years <br/>
and years, and isn&#39;t thinking about us now; why should we turn our <br/>
lives upside down in this charade of family-togetherness now?  I&#39;m <br/>
dealing with sexual abuse issues, as you are, Pat, and they should be <br/>
dealing with their physical abuse, neglect, and abandonment issues, <br/>
but they seem to be quite happy to overlook all of that.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; remove my father from our lives. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I&#39;m struggling with.  When he lived far away and was <br/>
independent, I could just ignore the relationship altogether except <br/>
on holidays for phone calls, and then focus on the positives (and <br/>
there are some), and &quot;make nice,&quot; as you say.  The children have <br/>
never developed a real relationship with him -- his choice, but I was <br/>
just as happy with it.  Now, everything is threatening to change.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is old enough for me to explain to her why I have to <br/>
distance myself from my father, and she supports me wholeheartedly.  <br/>
My husband is also in full support.  My son, however, still dreams of <br/>
having a real grandfather, and wants him here too, and I feel that he <br/>
is too young to hear the real reasons at this time.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I can talk to my sibs and distance myself from this <br/>
before the final decisions and the move are made, and they will <br/>
respect my wishes, but there are bound to be hard feelings as time <br/>
drags on and they have to bear the burden alone.  <br/>
<br/>
And I still struggle with feelings that if my children see me <br/>
ignoring my father in his time of need, no matter how bad he has been <br/>
in the past, that they will question my commitment to my values of <br/>
love and respect for others.<br/>
<br/>
The words of that Casement quote strike such a chord within me, but I <br/>
still struggle with it: (paraphrased) &quot;Loyalty is a sentiment, not a <br/>
law.  It rests on love, not on restraint.  The management of an <br/>
autocratic family rests on restraint and not on love; and since it <br/>
demands no love, it can evoke no loyalty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How do you explain to a young person (ds has just turned 16 and is <br/>
very sensitive) that you feel no loyalty to a person who SHOULD have <br/>
loved you (and who did love you in his own limited way, honestly), <br/>
but largely terrorized and abused you instead?  That I cannot rise <br/>
above this and do the right thing in the end?  It&#39;s so easy to say <br/>
that the &quot;right thing&quot; is to take care of myself and to keep the <br/>
distance, but should I not be bigger than that?  I am so torn.<br/>
<br/>
And to keep this in the general realm of our discussion on democracy <br/>
in the family -- I really didn&#39;t mean this to become an analysis of <br/>
my family problems...I&#39;m sorry -- this is still the overriding <br/>
question: If we are to model for our children lives built on love and <br/>
loyalty, how do we transcend our own histories of restraint, <br/>
coercion, and disconnectivity?  Do we tell the stories and explain <br/>
how we are intentionally doing things differently?  Do we ignore the <br/>
past and build the future upon our consciously-chosen ideals?  When <br/>
faced with dilemmas of values such as the one I describe in my own <br/>
life, how much do we say...and at what ages?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for putting up with my ramblings,<br/>
Laura B.</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, Sandra.  I know how it feels.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My kids know many stories of how my mom was with me, and they have <br/>
their own <br/>
&gt; experiences with her, too.    If their feelings about me are as <br/>
mixed as mine <br/>
&gt; were about my mom, that will be about the way I treated them, not <br/>
about the <br/>
&gt; way I treated my mom.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is comforting.  How old is Holly?  I&#39;m just not sure how much to <br/>
share with my son.  Somehow, it feels disloyal to talk about the old <br/>
man, but then I realize that keeping these family secrets does <br/>
nothing but protect the perpetrator.  We need to know our family <br/>
stories.  The secrets need to be told, don&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
I certainly hope, and have worked hard to keep this from happening, <br/>
that my children will most certainly NOT have such mixed feelings <br/>
about me.  Lord, have mercy.  But I know what you mean.  Their <br/>
feelings will be about me, in the end, not about how I treated my own <br/>
father.  If I have been consistent in my love for them, or as <br/>
consistent as I can be...have loved them as unconditionally as I <br/>
can...have respected and honored them as human beings in their own <br/>
rights (in other words, gifted them in ways I was never gifted by my <br/>
own father), they will know me for who I am, and will accept my <br/>
actions at their face value.  Is that about the gist of it? <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I did and thought, Laura, in those last days was that I needed <br/>
to do <br/>
&gt; enough to keep me from regretting my actions for the rest of my <br/>
life.  &lt;snip&gt; So for my sake and Holly&#39;s, I helped her a lot the last <br/>
&gt; few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Two questions for clarification.  Despite your mother&#39;s history with <br/>
you, you still felt it necessary to honor her with your love and <br/>
attention at the end of her life.  I admire you for that, and it is <br/>
this with which I am struggling.  The question:  Would you have been <br/>
able to commit to that sort of care over a MUCH longer period of <br/>
time, or would you have had to create more distance to protect <br/>
yourself?<br/>
<br/>
Second question: What, exactly, do you mean when you say, &quot;for <br/>
Holly&#39;s sake?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
YES!<br/>
To tell them you&#39;re making conscious choices because you want their lives to <br/>
be better seems to me the best way to make your grandchildren&#39;s lives and <br/>
great-grandchildren&#39;s lives better.<br/>
<br/>

ideals? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you live in the moment with your consciously-chosen ideals that might help <br/>
you decide how to deal with your dad.  <br/>
<br/>
Will taking care of him add to the tranquility and learning of your family?<br/>
Will it make you yourself feel better?<br/>
<br/>
If so, it&#39;s good for the moment (and all the moments coming up in the next <br/>
few years).<br/>
<br/>
Your son thinks it will be good for him.  Might it?  Might.<br/>
<br/>
My paternal grandmother told me after I was grown that she knew I had always <br/>
liked my Papaw (her husband, who died when I was 11 or 12) but that he really <br/>
wasn&#39;t so nice a guy.   I told her he was always nice to me, and though I was <br/>
sorry that he and she had their differences, that wasn&#39;t part of his <br/>
relationship with me.<br/>
<br/>
He had been good to my dad, too, and his brothers, and they were the closest <br/>
relatives to me on either side.  <br/>
<br/>
But if your siblings know of the abuse and are still pressing you to help, <br/>
then that&#39;s another round of the same abuse.  It would seem to me, if I were in <br/>
that situation, that they were saying, &quot;Get over it.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If your son would be helped by your dad being near, that&#39;s a mark in the <br/>
&quot;plus&quot; column.  But if you would be stressed, that could be more damage to your <br/>
son&#39;s 6th year, 7th year (however old he is) than the advantage of the visits <br/>
with grandpa.  Can you think of it as a balance sheet somehow?  If there are too <br/>
many minuses, tell your siblings no.  If he damaged your life, you don&#39;t need <br/>
to work hard to let him (or the aftereffects of longago him) damage your <br/>
kids&#39; lives, even indirectly by stirring it all up in you again.<br/>

I was 32, I think, before my mom told me she had been raped by her brother, <br/>
who then died of scarlet fever within another year or so.   I didn&#39;t know him, <br/>
of course, but it did explain a lot of my moms seemingly aberrant behavior <br/>
during the time I was the age she had been.  She had a strict rule that we not <br/>
play in the barn with David, our next-door neighbor.   It really  made no sense <br/>
to me.   Meanwhile the thing she wasn&#39;t afraid of and hadn&#39;t thought of WAS <br/>
happening, my younger cousin was sexually molesting my younger sister.  Both <br/>
female, so my mom had no fears. :-/<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
consistent as I can be...have loved them as unconditionally as I <br/>
<br/>
can...have respected and honored them as human beings in their own <br/>

rights (in other words, gifted them in ways I was never gifted by my <br/>
<br/>
own father), they will know me for who I am, and will accept my <br/>
<br/>
actions at their face value.  Is that about the gist of it? -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I&#39;m counting on.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Despite your mother&#39;s history with <br/>
<br/>
you, you still felt it necessary to honor her with your love and <br/>
<br/>
attention at the end of her life. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t love.<br/>
My feelings were not warm or compassionate.  <br/>
They were duty only. <br/>
I did try to make her comfortable, but when I put food and a water bottle on <br/>
the bed near her and she flung them off onto the floor, I didn&#39;t think, &quot;OH, <br/>
poor thing,&quot; I thought, &quot;Fine, then.   You&#39;ll get thirsty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think it in a hateful,angry way.  Just matter of fact.  A lot of the <br/>
emotion was gone from me regarding her by then.<br/>
<br/>
-=- The question:  Would you have been <br/>
<br/>
able to commit to that sort of care over a MUCH longer period of <br/>
<br/>
time, or would you have had to create more distance to protect <br/>

yourself?-=-<br/>

I would&#39;ve stuck her with my sister in a heartbeat were it going to be <br/>

Most of our lives I&#39;ve helped my mom out, but my sister was her favorite, and <br/>
my sister has more often aided and abetted my mom to drink and be <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777859894">&lt;&lt;&lt;He is looking at an extended care situation in CA, and my brother and <br/>
sister are seriously pressing to bring him back here to Houston -- to <br/>
live with my brother and his wife near me, where I would be expected <br/>
to contribute to his care on a daily basis, as I &quot;don&#39;t work&quot; -- <br/>
until he is either able to live again independently or (more likely) <br/>
dies.  It could be years.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From what I understand from both friends with elderly relatives, and the<br/>
experiences of my mother (Galveston resident) in the past couple of years,<br/>
any kind of extended care in California is extremely expensive. Maybe they<br/>
are factoring in thoughts about money, and are evidently in denial about the<br/>
abuse that filled your and your siblings&#39; childhoods. Are your sibs in CA?<br/>
Maybe they are trying to remove the problem (of the pressure of maintaining<br/>
denial) with distance. <br/>
<br/>
If he went to Texas, depending on his insurance, there may be enough to pay<br/>
for live-in care of some type that would be impossibly pricey in California.<br/>
You might look into some of the options available through the University of<br/>
Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, the hospital that my stepfather helps<br/>
run. It would be near enough if emergency medical decisions needed to be<br/>
made, and if you chose to try and find peace (for yourself) in a certain<br/>
level of relationship, but still far enough that an &quot;everyday&quot; care-by-you<br/>
situation would be impractical.<br/>
<br/>
My own feeling, and this is an issue that it is all too likely I will have<br/>
to deal with in due course, is that having someone in your family unit that<br/>
will cause pain and anguish to you and take time away from your children, is<br/>
something to be considered very carefully. It is one thing to share the load<br/>
amongst a bunch of siblings, quite another that it be assumed that not<br/>
working out of the home means your time is free to be appropriated to<br/>
others&#39; uses. I hope you are able to find a solution that does not leave you<br/>
feeling you have a kharmic debt, IYKWIM.<br/>
<br/>
It is sad how the end-of-life needs of family members can be such a source<br/>
of stress and conflict. My husband&#39;s stepmother, Paula, died a few days ago<br/>
after a 15 month battle with lung/brain/bone cancer - which she kept SECRET<br/>
from all of her late husband&#39;s family and associates (my FIL). We only<br/>
discovered her illness in the last 6 weeks, and dh initiated contact - but<br/>
that is another story. <br/>
<br/>
Paula&#39;s father had died about 3 years ago, also of cancer, after an<br/>
unpleasantly stressful and acrimonious battle between siblings about his<br/>
last wishes - basically her sisters tried to set aside his DNR. Now one of<br/>
these same sisters has apparently accused Paula&#39;s last caregivers and her<br/>
closest friend, and executor of her will, of murdering her. That means that<br/>
most likely there will be an autopsy performed and an investigation - an<br/>
absolute disruption of the lengthy written arrangements that Paula had left.<br/>
Luckily there are comprehensive doctor&#39;s records, medical personnel were<br/>
performing all tasks such as removing her IV feeding tube when she had<br/>
become comatose, and her wishes in terms of DNR were clearly stated in<br/>
writing. She died in her own home set up as a hospice - she had the money to<br/>
support that option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143442027">This sounds so much like what I went through when my mom died last <br/>
fall except she was too far away for me to help her at all.  I never <br/>
visited her even when the time was close because she too kept lying <br/>
and manipulating us even on her death bed.  I didn&#39;t attend the <br/>
funeral because my siblings are more than happy to carry on her <br/>
legacy.<br/>
<br/>
What I felt when she died was a feeling a relief and a sadness for <br/>
her wasted life.  I felt guilty for awhile but came to the <br/>
realization that her decisions and actions led to our separation and <br/>
that my responsibility lies with my children.  Allowing myself to be <br/>
subject to my families emotional games would have made it hard for to <br/>
take care of them and have the kind of familial relationships they <br/>
deserve.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, it&#39;s so true that our children&#39;s feelings for us come from <br/>
the relationship that we&#39;ve built with them by how we&#39;ve treated <br/>
them.  I can see it now and don&#39;t have to wait until my death.<br/>
<br/>
Laura, you&#39;re a good daughter because you&#39;re a good person and a <br/>
great parent.  I think that that&#39;s the most important thing we can <br/>
give our parents- even if they don&#39;t realize it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My mom died last fall.  She was verbally abusive and dishonest to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119047559">** He is looking at an extended care situation in CA, and my brother and<br/>

live with my brother and his wife near me, where I would be expected<br/>

until he is either able to live again independently or (more likely)<br/>
dies.  It could be years.  He is not in life-threatening<br/>
circumstances now, but he has nowhere else to go during long-term<br/>
rehab than a nursing home in CA, and my brother and sister cannot,<br/>
apparently, live with that option.**<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s worthwhile to be as open as you can stand to be with your <br/>
extended family right now.  Tell them that you WON&#39;T rally around and <br/>
share the workload.   (Don&#39;t let them make assumptions that they will <br/>
find disappointing and hard to live with later.)  You may be doing them <br/>
a favor if you can talk them out of taking direct care of your dad.  <br/>
Encourage them to look at rehab facilities (locally, at least) so that <br/>
the decision that they make is realistic, not based on exaggerated fears.<br/>
<br/>
** How do you explain to a young person (ds has just turned 16 and is<br/>
very sensitive) that you feel no loyalty to a person who SHOULD have<br/>
loved you (and who did love you in his own limited way, honestly),<br/>
but largely terrorized and abused you instead? **<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to go into the details, you could tell your kids that <br/>
it is more important to you to put your time and energy into caring for <br/>
them, than into caring for your dad.  You could also just say vaguely <br/>
that dealing with your father upsets you and takes you days (or weeks or <br/>
whatever) to recover from.  Kids younger than teens I would probably <br/>
protect from having a relationship with your dad.  But a kid old enough <br/>
to drive can visit his grandpa at your brother&#39;s house and just leave at <br/>
any time if the visit becomes unpleasant.  That&#39;s much more power than a <br/>
younger kid has.<br/>
<br/>
** And to keep this in the general realm of our discussion on democracy<br/>
in the family -- I really didn&#39;t mean this to become an analysis of<br/>
my family problems...I&#39;m sorry -- this is still the overriding<br/>
question: If we are to model for our children lives built on love and<br/>
loyalty, how do we transcend our own histories of restraint,<br/>
coercion, and disconnectivity?**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling with this, too.  My dad&#39;s not a bad person, but there are <br/>
some issues with abandonment and with unpleasantness associated with <br/>
drinking.  Six years I was invited to inconvenience myself a lot to show <br/>
up and honor my dad and stepmother&#39;s  25th wedding anniversary (the same <br/>
weekend as my mother&#39;s birthday).  I chose not to go and pretend that we <br/>
were an affectionate family.  My dad, who had skipped out on many <br/>
parenting obligations after divorcing my mom, tried to convince me that <br/>
some events were &quot;obligatory&quot;.  I thought this was  hypocritical and <br/>
wasn&#39;t persuaded.  Bottom line is that I decided, for a few years, to <br/>
not treat him any better than I thought he had treated me.  I wasn&#39;t, at <br/>
that time, to be able to be a much better person than he had been.  <br/>
However, I did feel guilty about this, and I promised myself that I <br/>
would (over time) make a transition to treating him &quot;better than he <br/>
deserved&quot;.  He&#39;s over seventy now and I feel compelled to live up to my <br/>
secret promise to myself, to treat him better until he dies.  (That just <br/>
means visiting more often and calling.  I don&#39;t live close and I&#39;m not <br/>
looking at providing physical care.)  It&#39;s still hard work emotionally <br/>
for me to be forgiving.  I did use Daily Affirmation type books designed <br/>
for adult children of alchoholics (last year).  And I did grieve and <br/>
relive painful feelings and vent angry words to an empty room as part of <br/>
the process. (for weeks)  If your issues are bigger than my pretty <br/>
little ones, you might want a counselor to help support you while going <br/>
through a process like this.  (I bent my husband&#39;s ear a lot, and he was <br/>
great at always agreeing with me.)  The best part of the books for me is <br/>
that they made it clear that forgiveness is not something that you can <br/>
accomplish just by snapping your fingers.  That took some of the <br/>
pressure off.<br/>
<br/>
**Somehow, it feels disloyal to talk about the old<br/>
man, but then I realize that keeping these family secrets does<br/>
nothing but protect the perpetrator. **<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s healing for me to be able to talk about stuff.  The quote &quot;the <br/>
truth shall set you free&quot; is biblical, right?  For me to let it go, I <br/>
have to talk through the issues and spit it all out through my mouth.  <br/>
(Even little stuff, like people cutting me off in traffic. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**If I have been consistent in my love for them, or as<br/>
consistent as I can be...have loved them as unconditionally as I<br/>
can...have respected and honored them as human beings in their own<br/>
rights (in other words, gifted them in ways I was never gifted by my<br/>
own father), they will know me for who I am, and will accept my<br/>
actions at their face value.  Is that about the gist of it? **<br/>
<br/>
Tangent:<br/>
There&#39;s going to come an age when your kids will want to complain about <br/>
you.  (Maybe just about something you did by accident.)  It would be a <br/>
gift to them if you let go of the idea (implanted in your family of <br/>
origin) that it&#39;s not okay to complain or criticize.   If you can get <br/>
comfortable with truthfully criticizing your own parents, and truthfully <br/>
praising them for whatever you can find that they did right, then maybe <br/>
it will be easier for you to hear minor critical comments from your own <br/>
kids.  It&#39;s an attitude shift, but differences of opinion that might <br/>
have lead to screaming fights in our own childhoods can be handled <br/>
calmly, if we can learn to be truthful and gentle together about <br/>
difficult issues.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that your son will never criticize you, but some day you <br/>
will have a daughter-in-law!  Sooooo, getting comfortable with <br/>
differences of opinion and criticism, being able to talk about that <br/>
stuff rather than feeling that it should be hidden, will certainly come <br/>
in handy.<br/>
<br/>
**and will accept my<br/>
actions at their face value.**<br/>
<br/>
I think we can understand each other better if we talk about the reasons <br/>
for our actions.  I don&#39;t think we can assume that all our actions will <br/>
be correctly interpreted, especially if some of our motives or personal <br/>
history is deeply hidden.</div>
