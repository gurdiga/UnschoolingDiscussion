<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi All!&nbsp; I was triggered by your conversation 
on this subject of abortion, human rights, hunger, over population, and many 
other attrocities.&nbsp; I remember the comment of a swollen belly from hunger, 
I believe over population, medically &amp; naturally is a direct effect of 
hunger, and diseased standards of living.&nbsp; When one country has let&#39;s say 
50 % of the resources of the world, the other countries get to scramble &amp; 
divide the other 50%, throw in another money full country, and there goes 
another 30%&nbsp; throw in a few more, and few with less, SOMEBODY ends up with 
NOthing!&nbsp; If all the water is moved, all the seeds, and food are grown 
here, and there, but not there, cause they just can&#39;t afford it.&nbsp; SOMEBODY 
starves.&nbsp; When SOMEBODY is in a constant state of malnutrition, and war, 
and lack of &quot;natural resources&quot; , I think our bodies &amp; genetically we are 
directly affected. I think that naturally our bodies are meant&nbsp;to flourish 
&amp; be healthy, in&nbsp; just about every environment known to man, with a 
fair distribution of resources.&nbsp; Now let&#39;s just say, as a hypothesis that 
when under undue or unchangeable stress the body acts in such a way that&nbsp; 
defenses&nbsp;are put out into the bodies system, and that one of those defenses 
just happens to be fertility for the survival of the species. A NAtural 
occurance.&nbsp; If this were the case which I believe it IS.&nbsp; Over 
population would be a lessening factor in our Equal HUman RIght s struggle, 
because the &quot;evening&quot; of resources would allow for &quot;ALL&quot; people to have a fair , 
healthy &amp; interchangeable relationship with our Homes, the Earth.&nbsp; I 
believe this the planet we live on is actually like the garden of Eden, 
everything, that each spirit-(&amp;)-body that exists here needs to survive 
&amp; flourish , there are resources for a sustainable living &amp; path of the 
creature...we only have too many greedy bodies, taking too much from the rest of 
the folks.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Abortion is such a touchy and deep subject, I 
do not believe &quot;spiritually&quot; that anyone can make a definitive &quot;logical&quot; 
denomination from never having such an experience.&nbsp; You would need to walk 
in the shoes of the person on the road you condemn, before you would know if 
they were truly wrong unto themselves, and unto that which they were learning in 
this lifetime......who are we to judge.(in other words)&nbsp; Ofcourse there is 
what I would feel to be an abuse, when it come to abortion, but will I place 
myself in the seat of Judgement to inflict my place in truth on someone 
else?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Truth is found only within, not without, and even if I 
tried to place&nbsp; judgement upon someone else it would not affect their truth 
within themselves, any more, than taking them farther from there own , by 
defense.&nbsp; Death is crucial, and an integral part of experience in 
life.&nbsp; ALl species are affected by it..no one is spared.&nbsp; So I do what 
is most beneficial to my own survival, &amp; that of my family, &amp; being in 
tune with rythms of the natural world are the most trustworthy ways,&nbsp;&quot;I&quot; 
have found.&nbsp; It is all we truly have to rely on that is true to itself, 
true to it&#39;s surroudings, true to the future &amp; the past......it is a weave 
of many different experiences, and we should honor all stages of it, for my 
experiences are based in my life..and them in there&#39;s .&nbsp; Ofcourse it is 
natural for us to move away from or remove ourselves from experiences we find to 
be inadequate or unaccepteable based on our feelings...that is just as 
natural.&nbsp; But I &quot;personally &quot; try&nbsp; to recognize something just as it 
is,why base my beliefs for fear I will be like it or condone 
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Honoring everything in it&#39;s place allows me to justify even more 
clearly why I do not want something in my lifeor teaches me ther is more&nbsp;to 
learn here.&nbsp; ANd makes actions I do not think are conducive to my growth, 
more &quot; recognizeable&quot; allowing me to more easily avoid them.&nbsp; But on those 
perchance meetings , out of the blue, well, I honor them, I donot , or at least 
I try not to &quot;JUDGE&quot; them, for that is not my place.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hear to 
learn &amp; teach .......there is so much to learn &amp; 
teach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle*</font></div></html></div>
