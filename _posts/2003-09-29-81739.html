<div id="ygrps-yiv-648996461">While I appreciate the distinction folks are making between<br/>
&#39;homeschooler and Christian&#39; and &#39;Christian homeschooler&#39; and I&#39;m VERY<br/>
aware of the political antics of HSLDA and their ilk and don&#39;t like<br/>
where it&#39;s tending, I still feel the statement made, quotation marks or<br/>
not, is borderline.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known intolerant Christians, but one of my long-time favorite<br/>
people considered herself a Christian Homeschooler (no quotes), was a<br/>
member of HSLDA, didn&#39;t believe me when I told her their alerts were<br/>
hogwash (I said it nicely :), and definitely did school at home.  But<br/>
she was also one of the most tolerant &#39;fundamentalist&#39; Christians I&#39;ve<br/>
ever known.  I asked her about that--although my own beliefs were not as<br/>
well-developed then as now, it was clear they were tending away from<br/>
Christianity more and more--how was it she didn&#39;t feel threatened,<br/>
didn&#39;t feel she had to convert me?  <br/>
<br/>
Her answer was it was up to the Holy Spirit to convert me, not her :)<br/>
<br/>
Painting any group of people with the same brush does a disservice to<br/>
all of us, not just the group.  This woman meets all the criteria of<br/>
being a &quot;Christian Homeschooler&quot; and would have identified herself as<br/>
such--she even stopped homeschooling a couple years later just because<br/>
her husband wanted her to &lt;sigh&gt;  But intolerance and racism and wacky<br/>
non-beliefs about world history isn&#39;t a requirement to be a Christian<br/>
homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s turn the table.  What about the term &quot;radical unschooler&quot;?  I<br/>
personally don&#39;t like it.  My views and values are, for the most part,<br/>
very counter-culture (a term I like much better :)  But they don&#39;t make<br/>
me radical--at least, not in the sense in which I use that word, of<br/>
wanting to overturn all of the &#39;establishment&#39;.  I was shocked when I<br/>
joined an &#39;unschooling&#39; list that insisted that anyone who unschooled in<br/>
the way GWS (may it rest in peace--I wish they had done ANYTHING other<br/>
than throw in the towel) advocated was &#39;radical&#39; unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just I don&#39;t have a great take on the word &#39;radical&#39;.  Maybe<br/>
it&#39;s just the way I don&#39;t care for labels of any kind, anywhere.  But I<br/>
would no more call a group of people radical unschoolers than I would<br/>
call a group fundamentalist Christian or a group Christian<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Labels are a lot of what we leave school to escape.  They may be a<br/>
shorthand way to talk--as in grouping kids who don&#39;t learn well in<br/>
classroom situations as ADHD--but they make a new reality every time<br/>
they&#39;re used.  Just as most of the women on this list would probably<br/>
prefer that either female pronouns be used in non-specific writing, or<br/>
that constructions like his/her be used, because we KNOW that using male<br/>
pronouns almost exclusively creates a worldview which maintains the<br/>
importance of the male over the female.<br/>
<br/>
Is it the same?  I think so.  Labels are made to pigeon-hole people, to<br/>
avoid our having to see the individuality that lies beneath the facade. <br/>
First we pigeon-hole, then we dehumanize, then we deprive rights,<br/>
then.....well, how did the Nazis end up able to slaughter so many<br/>
people?<br/>
<br/>
Fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers are people, too, working within<br/>
their own sets of values and worldviews.  If we label and avoid, we<br/>
contribute to the adversarial relationship that exists.  The greater the<br/>
divide, the more the folk that really ascribe to the stereotype will be<br/>
threatened and feel the need to control us &#39;radical unschoolers&#39;.  Is<br/>
this the road we want to take?<br/>
<br/>
I personally prefer to bring people together rather than divide or<br/>
maintain divisions.  Maybe it&#39;s a legacy of the years of military<br/>
living, in which folks of all different beliefs, income levels,<br/>
educational backgrouns, races, religions, even countries of origin<br/>
manage to work together, respecting each other.  I dunno, but it&#39;s<br/>
important to me to not label others.  &quot;It&#39;s the beginning of a very<br/>
slippery slope.&quot;<br/>
