<div id="ygrps-yiv-428004726">There were times when each of my children had freinds i did not <br/>
approve of.  But I would not stop them from playing - but I would <br/>
control WHERE they were playing - our house, and I actaully never had <br/>
any trouble with any of them.<br/>
We would be insulting our children if we thought that we could choose <br/>
their friends for them.  I am not saying we shouldn&#39;t guide them - <br/>
but ultimatley it has to be their choice.<br/>
