&lt;&lt; He is a child so I do expect him to misbehave every so often, ;o) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*terminology alert*<br/>
<br/>
This one&#39;s not even about teaching and learning!<br/>
<br/>
People &quot;behave&quot; all the time.  &quot;Misbehave&quot; is an odd concept.  There is bad <br/>
behavior and good behavior, and neutral behavior, and justifiably grumpy <br/>
behavior, and thoughtless behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I expect my children to do the best they can at any moment.  Sometimes they <br/>
do things they regret, but they learn how to make things better again, <br/>
gradually, over time, with experience.<br/>
<br/>
The older they get, the less I am the judge of whether their behavior is <br/>
&quot;mis&quot; or not.  I will say when I think something hurt someone&#39;s feelings.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve discussed behavior in terms of the impression made on everyone around.  <br/>
The older they get, the less I protect them from the consequences of their <br/>
behavior.  I coached the little kids closely and they got some skills and I <br/>
let them go.<br/>
<br/>
Still sometimes they ask me for advice.  And sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Always, each person judges everyone else&#39;s behavior as acceptable to them or <br/>
not, as attractive to them or not, as honorable and thoughtful or not.    <br/>
That&#39;s the whole basis of human relationships, is deciding who we will <br/>
gravitate toward and who we will avoid.<br/>
