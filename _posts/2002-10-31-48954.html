<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ain&#39;t that the truth! LOL! We just started giving our 5 yo an allowance<br/>
&gt; (not tied to chores as we don&#39;t have them) and it is amazing how quickly<br/>
&gt; he is picking up on money things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yes.  Definitely.<br/>
<br/>
Besides math, there&#39;s all those good money management skills!  Tim got<br/>
totally into money when we came to Germany because there was so much more of<br/>
it in his life.  2 kinds, deutsche marks and dollars, and these euros that<br/>
were coming but not here yet, but we keps seeing signs about.  Now he&#39;s<br/>
collecting coins.  It was as natural as breathing.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, being a kid, he wants things he doesn&#39;t have the money for, and<br/>
borrows from the bank of Mom sometimes.  He&#39;s learned to pay off debts, and<br/>
that got us into &quot;how do I write that&quot;, because he&#39;s recording his money for<br/>
a scout project.  Writing that gets you into negative numbers, which I&#39;ve<br/>
always liked, just because they were called irrational numbers.  We had a<br/>
blast with them last night.<br/>
<br/>
I love unschooling!<br/>
