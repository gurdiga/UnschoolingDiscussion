concerns and  instead of someone say.. &quot;try this&quot;  or, &quot;have you thought <br/>
about this&quot;  or &quot;this worked for me&quot;, instead I got a barrage of accusations <br/>
and implication that just frustrated me.  Now, I dont even bring up those <br/>
challanges.   I just deal with them.   Lots of times I read things that DO <br/>
help me, that ARE great suggestions and alternatives.. but those usually come <br/>
in the form of a response to someone else who has a similar situation as <br/>
mine.   <br/>
<br/>
  In the spirit of trying to offer solutions, here are some ideas of  how I <br/>
would handle the smoking situation.   If my young child asked me if they <br/>
could smoke...   I&#39;m thinking about some real life situations I have been <br/>
in.... OK. . my father in law smoked.  My kids would  ask us why Grandpa <br/>
smoked.  We would say that when Granpa was younger, a lot more folks smoked.. <br/>
people didnt really know how harmful it was.  Lots of people smoked, that <br/>
thought it was &quot;cool&quot;,  and they didnt realize they could get very sick from <br/>
it.  Grandpa started smoking, and now, he is addicted to nicotine and he <br/>
doesnt want to try hard enough to quit smoking.  <br/>
<br/>
Really, in a way, maybe being around a smoker occasionally made it easier for <br/>
them to see how nasty it is. My dad smoked until he had a heart attack at 38. <br/>
 I never wanted to smoke because I detested his smoking.  Smoking was never <br/>
&#39;attractive&quot; to me because it stunk, and smoking played a big part in my dads <br/>
heart attack.  My kids know all of that about thier Grandpa.   I also have an <br/>
aunt that I am as close to as a sister who smokes ALOT.  My kids do not like <br/>
to go to her house.. IT STINKS!  They dont like to ride in the car with her.  <br/>
 It bugs them that she smokes and smells like smoke.   We always sit in the <br/>
no smoking area at restaurants, and if there is a smoker nearby that stinks <br/>
up our meal, we ask to move.  My kids are as adamant about moving as my dh <br/>
and I are.   <br/>
<br/>
I think my very first question to a kid who asked to smoke would be &quot;why do <br/>
you want to try it?&quot;   I would look at the specific situation.. What made <br/>
smoking seem attractive?  Does someone they look up to smoke?  Did they see <br/>
it on TV and it looked cool?   Maybe they just saw someone smoking in passing <br/>
and they are curious...   Find out WHY..     Of course, each different &quot;why&quot; <br/>
may merit different responses.  <br/>
<br/>
 If a child is just downright curious,  about the &#39;act&quot; of smoking, I would <br/>
let them try one.   I doubt any young child would find it enjoyable, quite <br/>
the contrary, they would probably think.. GADS, .. thats nasty!.. If you dont <br/>
want to go that far, maybe take them to a place with heavy smoking where they <br/>
can get a good lungful of second hand smoke.   If they want to emulate <br/>
someone they look up to.. Talk to that person privately, tell them your child <br/>
wants to try smoking.. Most folks would be glad to sit down with a child and <br/>
explain to them that thier smoking is NOT something they they are proud of.  <br/>
Think of all the other things that make the child look up to the person.     <br/>
Maybe that person will stop smoking around your child.. maybe they will stop <br/>
altogether..  <br/>
<br/>
 All of these solutions of course should be accompanied by lots of talking <br/>
and information about the dangers of smoking, the reasons some people chose <br/>
to smoke, the effects of second hand smoke.. etc etc..  There is also an easy <br/>
out.   IF a child did actually want to smoke and continued to insist on <br/>
it.... There are legal considerations.  Persons under 18 can not buy <br/>
cigarettes.. AND. ( copied from a &quot;legal stuff web page&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
It may seem odd, but it is not illegal for kids under 19 years of age to <br/>
possess cigarettes or to smoke them. However, it is illegal for anyone to <br/>
supply or sell cigarettes to kids under 19 years of age.<br/>
<br/>
SOO, if you give your child a cigarette, you are breaking the law.   Of <br/>
course,  I wouldnt just use that as a first response,  but, it is valid.   <br/>

Ideally issues, suggestions and alternatives will be ALL we discuss on this <br/>
list, and it shouldn&#39;t be important whose question it originally was.  If the <br/>
question was ANYTHING about unschooling, the answers should all be tools for <br/>
stimulating the thought of anyone who reads it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-instead of someone say.. &quot;try this&quot;  or, &quot;have you thought <br/>
about this&quot;  or &quot;this worked for me&quot;. . . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
The whole list exists for people to throw out a question, problem, concern, <br/>
and for others to discuss that problem or situation.    When a person is <br/>
especially insecure or unsure and takes things personally, it&#39;s unfortunate <br/>
for everyone.<br/>

I wanted to respond to your question, I did not want to just dismiss it.  <br/>
But, I don&#39;t think my insights on some of the responses I get will be <br/>
conducive to keeping the list peaceful.   I really don&#39;t want add to the <br/>
current tensions and such.   I know why I get ( and do not get) certain <br/>
responses from my posts.   But, after being on this list for 8 months, seeing <br/>
the dynamics of this list and how it operates ( proven many times over), I <br/>
just take it all with a grain of salt and don&#39;t get worked up about it <br/>
anymore.   Well, I take that back, I DO get worked up about it.. I just don&#39;t <br/>
express it to the group.   I finally figured out that was big fat waste of <br/>
time and energy, and it gets me put on moderation<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180348382">Okay - well - I thought that if you had thought this through and <br/>
figured out why your posts weren&#39;t getting results from the 1,000 plus <br/>
