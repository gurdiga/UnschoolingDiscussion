I have to disagree.  We, as unschoolers know this and embrace the fact that we are doing this so our kids can be happy and do what they want in life, whether that includes a college education or not.  But for the majority who are still so goal oriented, it might make someone pick up the book and look at.  To me, being successful is doing what you love in life and being happy.  It seems to me that society dictates that being successful is making as much money as you possibly can, and that requires a good college education.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that, we need to get the word out about unschooling and the only way to do that is to entice someone to read the book and to do that we have to give them something to whet their curiosity.  I know my DH would be more likely to read a book on unschooling if it had a picture of what he considers a successful college student on the front, instead of someone working at McDonald&#39;s for instance.  Not that there is anything wrong with working at McDonald&#39;s, but my DH and a lot of other people would think that is not a successful life and discredit the book right away.  What is that saying, you can&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover?  Well, many people prejudge.  And besides, that is the main marketing strategy of a book, besides the reviewers. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Whatever makes me the most money!..KIDDING!  You&#39;ve made a good <br/>
point, one that Laurie made also. We have to appeal to the people <br/>
that think college is the only way too. Once they buy the book and <br/>
read my opinion of how college is not necessary, yet Laurie loves <br/>
college... maybe they&#39;ll open their eyes a little bit. <br/>
