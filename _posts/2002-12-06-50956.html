Hi, Vanessa --<br/>
<br/>
What state do you live in?<br/>
<br/>
Have you verified that these &quot;requirements&quot; are actually part of the<br/>
education law?  Schools personnel have been known to lie about what<br/>
homeschoolers are actually required to do. <br/>
<br/>
I did a quick calculation and 1000 hours, divided by 36 weeks in a<br/>
school year and then 5 days in a week comes up to a 5.5 hour school day.<br/>
 (Approximately.)  Students aren&#39;t spending 5.5 hours constructively &quot;on<br/>
task&quot; in school every day.  There&#39;s a lot of time wasted on<br/>
administrative stuff, misbehavior and review.  Most homeschoolers who do<br/>
formal curriculum don&#39;t spent 5.5 hours a day.  3 hours, or less, is a<br/>
lot more common.<br/>

<br/>
But people in every state get by without lying.  Even those which require <br/>
portfolios or charts.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers themselves don&#39;t keep the kinds of records many homeschoolers <br/>
mistakenly believe they&#39;re supposed to keep.<br/>
<br/>
And if someone is totally stressing about record keeping, they ARE <br/>
failing--failing to be calm and happy homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
For newer participants on this list, here&#39;s something Carol Narigon used <br/>
which can easily be adapted for other families.   <br/>

Even if it turns out that you really have to document all these hours, you<br/>
can learn how to write in educationese.  Then you write down all the stuff<br/>
they do and put an educationese spin on them.  But do check, as someone<br/>
suggested.  Make sure you&#39;re actually required by law rather than school<br/>
board.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717483397">Hi I have been *lurking* for about 3 weeks reading posts. I started <br/>
out homeschooling 2 years ago but we now Unschool.  I live in <br/>
Missouri. I use a daily log that can be found at: <br/>
<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.anglefire.com/mo3/schoolhouse/dailylog.jpg">http://www.anglefire.com/mo3/schoolhouse/dailylog.jpg</a>  <br/>
<br/>
its very simple to use for me. All MO seems to care about is that <br/>
one, the child/children are in attendence, two, they are being <br/>
*taught* the 5 required subjects, those 5 must be *taught* in 600 <br/>
hours per year, 400 of those 600 must be in the home, and additional <br/>
400 hours must be in non-core subjects per year, total 1000 hours.  I <br/>
have 2 children  12 and 10 I keep one daily log per child per week. <br/>
Children learn from the time they wake up in the mornings til they go <br/>
to bed at night. My daily log shows an *hour* in each core subject <br/>
per day. 1 to 2-1/2 hours per day non-core.  If my son, 12 reads the <br/>
directions to a new game cube game, thats reading. If he figures out <br/>
how much that game is going to cost to buy/rent, thats math. If he <br/>
helps me make cookies and we have to reduce the amounts used, thats <br/>
fractions. Making cookies is math. Reading the sales adds to me and <br/>
helping make a list is reading/writing. Watching the science channel <br/>
counts as science. He watched the history channel last night for 3 <br/>
hours because he wanted to. His favorite subject, The Titanic was <br/>
being shown as they tried to lift a section of it. That counted as <br/>
science and social studies. He watched it until 11 p.m. school isn&#39;t <br/>
out at our home at 3 p.m. its out when they go to bed. Every 2-3 days <br/>
I write down the hours in the log. I wrote a Plan of Education for <br/>
each child and have that in a folder I keep the daily log in.  I also <br/>
keep a copy of our states law requirements in it. The only thing that <br/>
we must show if ever questioned is the daily log, and the only person <br/>
that can request that is the Prosecuting attorney.  e-mail me at, <br/>
