It&#39;s one thing for your husband to decide he&#39;s not going to watch his  <br/>
favorite genre of movies because he&#39;s read something about brain  <br/>
chemistry changes that occur and he thinks it&#39;s worth the sacrifice  <br/>
to give up something he likes to get something he believes is  <br/>
better. **<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about not watching 24 right before bedtime this year, because I feel a lot of tension when I watch it and it can be hard to relax enough to go to sleep.  I think I&#39;ll time shift it and watch it the next afternoon, or early evening. <br/>

Nature supplies these elements in each plant<br/>
in quantities sufficient to metabolize the carbohydrate in that<br/>
particular plant.**   [ quoted from Dr. Martin ]<br/>
<br/>
That sounds bogus to me.  Plants don&#39;t form their leaves and roots for the purpose of being eaten.<br/>
