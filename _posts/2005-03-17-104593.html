We were  talking about teaching as part of unschooling. Some people seemed to<br/>
think  that there couldn&#39;t be any teaching if you were unschooling.  I  was<br/>
trying to point out that teaching is ok if the child has asked for  it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But was it &quot;teaching&quot; if the child didn&#39;t learn?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-My shoelace story was an example of how teaching and learning are not  the<br/>
same thing, and that learning does not necessarily follow teaching.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t worth anything. Except maybe the value of my child knowing that  if<br/>
she asks me to help her with something, I will try.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Right.  Sorry.  I was trying to say the same thing.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
For those who are even more confused than I was, the issue is attachment to  <br/>
the word/idea/concept of &quot;teaching.&quot;   It can help to dump that from  your <br/>
thoughts and say instead (and think instead) that you helped her learn to  tie <br/>
her shoes.  You showed her how you tie yours.  You maybe passed on  ideas or <br/>
tricks that helped you.  <br/>
 <br/>
All the learning happens inside the learner.  Teaching (especially  teaching <br/>
that resulted in no learning) isn&#39;t as helpful to unschooling as is  helping a <br/>
person learn.  They&#39;re not always the same thing.  And when  they ARE the <br/>
same thing, it&#39;s more helpful to think of it as &quot;helping someone  learn.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-So are you saying that learning does always follow teaching? I&#39;m sure  you<br/>
said the opposite in an earlier post. I&#39;m a bit confused! anyway,  I&#39;m<br/>
thinking!-=-<br/>
 <br/>
If I said it, what I meant was that if nobody learned, why would we say we  <br/>
&quot;taught&quot;?<br/>
But in schools the definition of &quot;teach&quot; comes down to &quot;showed up, did  <br/>
stuff, kept kids in room, gave them a test&quot; because they have to have a  <br/>
justification for pay checks and benefits.   And there ARE measures  that are designed <br/>
to prove that teachers taught.  Unfortunately, they&#39;re  based on grades and <br/>
tests scores, neither of which shows much long-term evidence  of real learning.  <br/>
And luckily for teachers, they often just show that he  kids got a year older <br/>
and can do better on same-old-tests because they&#39;re more  mature and are <br/>
probably learning enough outside of school (and some inside) to  get a higher score <br/>
than the year before, so the teacher&#39;s paycheck is  justified.  <br/>
 <br/>
Occasionally I teach a one-hour kind of thing.  I &quot;taught a class&quot; on  <br/>
medieval and Renaissance music a couple of years back.  I ran it toward  getting a <br/>
joke, and at the end I played a fake gregorian chant that was actually  Queen&#39;s <br/>
&quot;We will Rock You&quot; done in such a way that you&#39;d get twelve words in  before <br/>
realizing it wasn&#39;t REALLY a gregorian chant.  Anyone who &quot;got that  joke&quot; <br/>
felt he&#39;d learned something in that class.  Some people probably  caught a thing <br/>
or two they still remember. Some were just there because there  wasn&#39;t another <br/>
workshop they wanted to attend in that hour, or they liked me, or  they liked <br/>
music.  I was paid with a free lunch and a nice &#39;thank  you.&#39;    If no one <br/>
learned, at least I did my presentation.   But could I say I &quot;taught&quot; if truly <br/>
not a person learned a thing?    Depends on what I think teaching is, I guess.  <br/>
Luckily, I showed them  pictures and played them music, and told them <br/>
stories, so probably various of  them remember totally different bits and parts.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-the 1st definition of teach in my dictionary is: To help to  learn,<br/>
tell or show-=-<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s a good definition!<br/>
 <br/>
-=-If only they really did sing and dance! That would be a huge  <br/>
improvement!-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Amen. <br/>
I used to sing, when I taught Jr. High.  Fridays, a traditional ballad  each <br/>
week.  I called it poetry and literature, on the lesson plans.  I  told the <br/>
kids &quot;on Fridays we&#39;ll just do a ballad.&quot;  When I see any of them  now, they <br/>
talk about that.  A friend of mine found she&#39;s working with one  of my former <br/>
students at Sandia Labs; they&#39;re engineers.  So I exchanged a  couple of e-mails <br/>
with this long-ago student, whose name&#39;s Inez.  It was  very cool.  She <br/>
mentioned the ballads, and said I taught her calligraphy,  after hours, and she <br/>
still does it (it was probably one session and a follow-up  when she had <br/>
questions).   I got to tell her that the person who first  taught me calligraphy (one <br/>
lesson, but I still say &quot;taught&quot; because it  took!  I just needed to know how <br/>
to operate the pen and ink and to see  someone do it who could give me <br/>
pointers) was... Rodema, the very woman she&#39;s  working with at Sandia.  They hadn&#39;t <br/>
known of that calligraphy  connection.  And I told her if I had given her a <br/>
&quot;handout,&quot; it was probably  done by Rodema.<br/>
