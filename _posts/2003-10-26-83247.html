<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045815196">Sandra,<br/>
 I am new to the whole homeschool/unschool community and yes I don&#39;t <br/>
know the whole history of it. I made that comment to merely make a <br/>
joke of my own experience that I had in school and I truly didn&#39;t <br/>
learn anything in school I floated through in a dreamy state and <br/>
then woke up when my mother said &quot;it&#39;s a big scary world out there <br/>
and it will be different for you now that you are graduating&quot; Geez <br/>
thanks MOM !!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always read everything and assume that it is truth.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t do that with this article either.  What I did get from it is <br/>
that there is &quot;A veiw&quot; of a different way to live your life which is <br/>
good for the people who are on the other side and feel like there is <br/>
but are not exsposed to wonderful people like all of you on this <br/>
list.  I myself know because I came to this list longing for a <br/>
better way of life and living.  School is the only thing that you <br/>
hear of (it was all I new and sent my son to school) and people are <br/>
NOT empowered to take a path of least resistance.  I always wanted <br/>
to homeschool my son even though I didn&#39;t know a thing about it. I <br/>
had heard the term and all I new is to me it ment that I would be <br/>
with my children which is why I had them. It didn&#39;t make sense to me <br/>
that people had them and sent them out to baby factories months old <br/>
to them give them to public schools for them to continue  it just <br/>
never rang TRUE with me.<br/>
<br/>
When people ask me about being home or homeschooling I just smile <br/>
and tell them &quot;it&#39;s a way of life - it&#39;s how we live&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We  are at all different levels af awarness and on our quest for the <br/>
truth we sometimes need to hear articles such as this one. It just <br/>
may be the one that hepls people see that they do have choices about <br/>
how they raise their children - and IMO they can start living a life <br/>
worth living ???? <br/>

That sounds good, but an article written by and for fundamentalist <br/>
Christians isn&#39;t a good article for other kinds of people to promote <br/>
to others.  They are basically passing a social virus without <br/>
realizing it.<br/>
<br/>
And if a new homeschooler reads that and passes it on as if it is <br/>
truth, then untruth is being spread unknowingly.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people should pass it on because it contains information <br/>
which is false.  It doesn&#39;t matter to me if down in there is a good <br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
I promise NEVER to serve any of you ANY lemonade in which a turd is <br/>
floating.   A little falsehood will mar a load of truth, but that <br/>
article is a load of falsehood &quot;supporting&quot; a little truth.<br/>
<br/>
And that &quot;truth&quot;--that learning can happen without a curriculum, and <br/>
that saying &quot;We don&#39;t go to school&quot; is better than we &quot;school&quot; at <br/>
home--is what this list is already about.  So let&#39;s put the untruth <br/>
and propaganda back outside of this list and go on with our  normal <br/>
business.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are homeschooling for religious and political purposes know <br/>
full well there are better lists for them to be on, and this list <br/>
doesn&#39;t need religious or political propaganda.  It doesn&#39;t make it <br/>
easier for anyone to understand unschool</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034902897">When I first started homeschooling, I was told that if they are raised in a Godly home that they would never stray (lie # 1 and # 2 ) there would be no rebellion.  There are no promises like that.  I know that homeschooling is good and love being with the kids, I know that public school just shuffles them along, but I can say that for the past couple of years we have been just floating along.. because all of a sudden my &quot;obedient son&quot; became rebellious and started straying all over the place.  We do have a good relationship now, although he nudges me to do phonics or math with the other kids now. LOL, I told him he unschooled himself through high school and it worked for him.  I showed him all that he taught himself and his interests.  Whenever he comes up with a good idea he shares it and I tell him &quot; that sounds good and doable&quot; ...  I digress... Anyway John Taylor Gatto may be a good place to start and Phyllis Schafley is another good read.. <br/>

<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml">http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It takes uncommon commitment by parents to undertake a homeschool  <br/>
regimen, but they soon discover they can do in a couple of hours what  <br/>
takes all day at regular school.  Homeschooling parents can save lots  <br/>
of time since there are so many courses they don&#39;t have to teach.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t have to teach multiculturalism, the peculiar notion that  <br/>
other cultures should be preferred to our own, or teach a course in  <br/>
Islam, such as is now taught in California schools.  Homeschooling  <br/>
parents are free to teach that their religion and their country are the  <br/>
best.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling parents do not have to teach political correctness, such  <br/>
as the dogma that all academic subjects must be taught through the  <br/>
prism of gender and race oppression.  They are free to teach that  <br/>
America is not a land of victims but a country of freedom and  <br/>
opportunity for all.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooing parents do not have to teach the androgyny demanded by  <br/>
radical feminism.  They are free to teach boys and girls separately and  <br/>
differently and let their boys enjoy plenty of recess to work off their  <br/>
excess energy and avoid giving them Ritalin to make them behave like  <br/>
girls.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers do not have to take a course every year in Diversity, the  <br/>
code word for gay rights, as is now mandated K-12 by the California  <br/>
State Legislature.  Parent educators are free to teach that it is OK to  <br/>
be judgmental about illegal and immoral acts.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling parents don&#39;t have to teach revisionist history that  <br/>
deletes mention of Washington, Jefferson and Franklin, as the New  <br/>
Jersey State Department of Education tried to do, but had to back down  <br/>
after a parental uproar.  Homeschoolers have academic freedom to study  <br/>
the Founding Fathers and read the writings of the DWEMs (Dead White  <br/>
European Males) who contributed so much to Western Civilization.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers do not have to study global education that is designed to  <br/>
promote global interdependence and citizens of the world instead of the  <br/>
U.S.A.  Homeschooling parents do not have to teach Environmental  <br/>
Education fantasies such as that humans exist to serve the earth  <br/>
instead of vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers don&#39;t have to study fuzzy math, whole math, new math, new  <br/>
new math, or rainforest math.  They won&#39;t waste math time discussing,  <br/>
coloring, playing games, or telling their parents how good they feel  <br/>
about incorrect answers.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooled children will learn to read using authentic phonics as  <br/>
their first order of business, so they won&#39;t have to take remedial  <br/>
reading after three years of failure.  They won&#39;t be inflicted with  <br/>
Whole Language, which fraudulently teaches children to guess at words  <br/>
from the pictures, skip over difficult words, and substitute any words  <br/>
that seem to fit the context.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers will save lots of time because they don&#39;t have to read  <br/>
typical middle school assignments of depressing modern fiction by  <br/>
&quot;nobody&quot; authors writing about drugs, violence, sex, runaway teens,  <br/>
witchcraft, and other depressing subjects.  Homeschoolers can read  <br/>
books about heroes and stories that build character, courage,  <br/>
patriotism, and virtue.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers won&#39;t have to spend time filling out nosy questionnaires  <br/>
about sex, drugs and suicide.  The public schools are obsessed with  <br/>
asking students impudent personal questions such as how many times have  <br/>
you felt depressed and tried to commit suicide.<br/>
<br/>
There are many more worthless courses taught in public schools on which  <br/>
homeschoolers will not spend their precious time, such as courses in  <br/>
murder (forensics is the latest fad), suicide, death and dying,  <br/>
evolution, and self-esteem.  Homeschooled students won&#39;t have any  <br/>
problem with self-esteem because their self-esteem will be earned by  <br/>
achievement in mastering the important truths of history, literature,  <br/>
math and science.<br/>

A homeschooled teen in my neighborhood is now working toward her nursing degree.  When younger, this teen was a favorite among neighborhood children as a babysitter and also did pet sitting and had her own dog grooming business.  Her mother told me that she is so sorry she encouraged her daughter to have goals beyond becoming a mother and a homemaker.  She is now seeing to it that her younger daughter&#39;s focus will be on home and family, rather than on career.<br/>

We are also about 25-30 miles from the fires, although Jayn&#39;s great<br/>
great Aunt is in Hemet near one lot of fires. The air quality is awful.<br/>
The pool in our complex has floating ash, but that is incomparably<br/>
trivial next to the homes and lives that have been lost. It will all<br/>
change for us when the Santa Ana wind reverses to the more common<br/>
offshore breezes. Thank you for asking.<br/>

That is a good one!<br/>
Don&#39;t waste math time playing games or discussing.<br/>
<br/>
THIS REMINDS ME!<br/>
<br/>
I put a link to Pam Sorooshian&#39;s thus-far deposits of math stuff <br/>
(warning:  it&#39;s about games, largely) here:<br/>

<br/>
She has other plans for a final version, but this for-now version is <br/>
pretty wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
-=-Homeschooled children will learn to read using authentic phonics as<br/>
their first order of business, so they won&#39;t have to take remedial<br/>
reading after three years of failure.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh, retching.  Wretched retching wrenching the depths of my... (Well <br/>
that&#39;s enough phonics humor for now.)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I can put out for general reading now that the newest <br/>
issue of Home Education Magazine is out:  the column from last issue, <br/>
&quot;Persephonics.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

I&#39;m in San Diego. One fire was about 5 miles North of us, one about 8 miles East, and another was about 15 miles South. We have been stuck inside since Sunday, because of all the smoke and ash. But it seems to be clearing up a little. We didn&#39;t loose our power but a lot of my family did. We were also able to stay in our home but again alot of family and friends had to be evacuated. My aunt and uncle almost lost their house Sunday, but they were able to beat the fire back. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been really scary, I had to stop watching the news, seeing places that I knew burn was just to much.<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Thanx Robyn, :)<br/>
<br/>
I keep thinking every time I look out the window that it is going to rain, it&#39;s so dark and gloomy out side, the I remember that it&#39;s smoke :(<br/>
<br/>
I can see patches of blue today, so hopefully things are getting better. I feel really bad for the boys, being stuck inside, they want to go out and play so much. All the park days have been cancled and we arn&#39;t sure if we&#39;ll be able to go out for Halloween. We talked about trying to get to one of the two indoor malls in our area so that they were at least out of the apartment, but one is North near a fire and the other is East, near a nother fire. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry about rambling on, but I&#39;m board and this is the first time since Sunday I&#39;ve been able to turn on the computer. <br/>
