<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496578436">My son has been complaining that he can&#39;t remember things lately. He&#39;ll<br/>
learn something or read about it and then immediately forget it. I&#39;ve also<br/>
noticed that he is losing some basic math skills as well: he has forgotten<br/>
basic addition and subtraction facts. I&#39;ve noticed him using his fingers to<br/>
count again. It seems to be bothering him enough so that he has mentioned<br/>
it and seems stressed about it. I don&#39;t require him to do daily math<br/>
exercises, although he has been asking to &quot;do math&quot;, whatever that means.<br/>
We play board games that require math (things with dice, cards, etc.), but<br/>
he says he can&#39;t remember things. He has a great memory for other things,<br/>
like cars, so it could be that he&#39;s just not paying attention to other<br/>
things because of lack of true interest. Any thoughts anyone on this memory<br/>
problem?<br/>

My daughters do this occasionally too. I think  that they are using their<br/>
most immediately available abacus ...<br/>
haha..and although it worries me, they don&#39;t seem too stressed about it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think thatthey do this  because they have not had enough rote<br/>
learning with math.<br/>
<br/>
But I hear you and have experienced the same thing. I haven&#39;t got any answers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did anyone consider that maybe there is energy being expended by these kids<br/>
on physical growth, physical brain development, emotional growth, hormonal<br/>
changes, etc which could mean that they have less energy to spend on<br/>
remembering non-essential information temporarily?  I got really ditsy<br/>
after both of my children were born.  I forgot things, I was easily<br/>
distrated and unable to concentrate, etc.  I know that my problem was<br/>
hormonal changes (huge ones) and large amounts of energy being expended on<br/>
nursing, physical healing, etc.  Kids go through SO much on their way to<br/>
adulthood and they go through changes every bit as exhausting and<br/>
challenging as pregnancy and post pregnancy changes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was going to be my answer.  Remember when the babies would have a<br/>
growth sprut they would sleep all the time. Also, when they were ready to<br/>
take a cognitive leap they would back up regress a bit.  Like the baby<br/>
clinging right before talking starts. I&#39;ve even seen it in my teen. She&#39;ll<br/>
get ready to take on another aspect of adult life  and for a few weeks will,<br/>
honestly, become really ditsy.<br/>
<br/>
It short-term memory problems haven&#39;t always been around I wouldn&#39;t worry. I<br/>
would buy a good multivitamin, check their diet and sleep patterns and then<br/>
wait for the next phase.  You might come to miss this one.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am sure I will miss this stage very much! I already see it slipping away. I<br/>
will have to think about the growth spurt idea and see what other changes are<br/>
happening. I would not have been concerned about the memory issue had he not<br/>
mentioned that it bothered him. Maybe he is growing into a stage where he is<br/>
more becoming more aware of things in general, and it is becoming important to<br/>
him that he remember the details. We&#39;ll see...<br/>
