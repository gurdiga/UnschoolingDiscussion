<div id="ygrps-yiv-527757785">For those asking for more information about adoption:<br/>
<br/>
After a little research concerning the adoption links, and phone numbers.<br/>
Adoptive Families of America is still working on their website, their toll<br/>
free number is 800-372-3300.  They provide wonderful service to adoptive<br/>
families and lots of support.  Children Awaiting Parents can be accessed<br/>
thru their website at   adopt.org    this is connected to other photo<br/>
listing organizations.  This one website will give you acess to 1300<br/>
children in need of homes.  There are other photo listing services online,<br/>
you will just need to spend sometime browsing and searching to get exactly<br/>
where you want to go.  There is also a lot of good information about<br/>
adopting an older child (any child past newborn) on the web.  Please be sure<br/>
to read any and all suggested reading concerning adoption and fostercare.<br/>
The history that these children bring into your family will play a huge part<br/>
in everyone&#39;s lives and you must be ready to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your search.  The joys and challenges of adopting are wonderful<br/>
and  life long.<br/>
