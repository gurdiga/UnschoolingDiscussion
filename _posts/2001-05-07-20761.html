<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765113112">ALL links to www.home-ed-press.com changed to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> as quickly as possible. The old <br/>
&gt;home-ed-press URL is currently linked to a pornographic website <br/>
&gt;administrated by a company in Armenia.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;WARNING - Please DON&#39;T check out that old home-ed-press site out of<br/>
&gt;idle curiosity, because it is a &quot;virulent&quot;* porn site that will keep <br/>
&gt;opening multiple windows until your browser or your whole machine <br/>
&gt;crashes. If you&#39;re really *that* curious to see what&#39;s there, please <br/>
&gt;save everything before clicking the link. *virulent - highly <br/>
&gt;infective, rapidly spreading, deadly<br/>

&gt;This message is on our website at<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.</a> We will post any updates <br/>
&gt;and additional information on that page.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A little history: We created the home-ed-press.com domain name when<br/>
&gt;we were publishing books on homeschooling several years ago. We sold <br/>
&gt;the book publishing part of our company when we decided to focus on <br/>
&gt;the magazine, but we kept the home-ed-press.com URL mirrored to our <br/>
&gt;home-ed-magazine.com site because so many homeschooling websites <br/>
&gt;showed to the old URL &lt;home-ed-press.com&gt; as their link to Home <br/>
&gt;Education Magazine&#39;s many features and free services.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But somehow the registration on the home-ed-press.com domain name<br/>
&gt;expired (we&#39;re still trying to figure out how it expired without our <br/>
&gt;knowledge), and it was bought by a wholesale company, which leased or <br/>
&gt;rented it just last week to an overseas company which linked it to a <br/>
&gt;porn site, obviously to capitalize on the high number of links.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So here we are, with a big mess on our hands: A widely linked<br/>
&gt;homeschooling URL linked to a gnarly pornography site. We are working <br/>
&gt;to straighen out the mess, but we need help. All the help we can get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PLEASE - If you have a link to the old home-ed-press domain name on<br/>
&gt;your website please change it to home-ed-magazine.com as soon as <br/>
&gt;possible. Please check the sites for your local homeschooling support <br/>
&gt;group, your local public library, your favorite online resources - <br/>
&gt;anyplace that might have a link to Home Education Magazine&#39;s hundreds <br/>
&gt;of pages via the old home-ed-press.com URL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Webmasters: We offer the following advice from Ann Zeise, who first<br/>
&gt;notified us of this problem:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s how to find out if you have any home-ed-press links on your<br/>
&gt;site. Go to the search engine at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.altavista.com">http://www.altavista.com</a> In the <br/>
&gt;search field put the following parameters (exchanging my <br/>
&gt;www.gomilpitas.com URL for your own root directory in the last part):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;+link:www.home-ed-press.com<br/>
&gt;-url:www.home-ed-press.com+url:www.gomilpitas.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If your site shows up at all on Altavista, you will be able to see if<br/>
&gt;any pages have the errant URL on them. Then just go into your copy of <br/>
&gt;these pages and do a &quot;&quot;FIND and REPLACE&quot; and replace <br/>
&gt;&quot;www.home-ed-press.com&quot; with &quot;www.home-ed-magazine.com&quot; -- They kept <br/>
&gt;all the rest of the directories and paths the same, so your link will <br/>
&gt;now go to its original destination. (Do check in case you just happen <br/>
&gt;to have a link to a page they have removed for some reason. All of <br/>
&gt;mine were corrected this way.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;NOTE: using the first two parameters in this sort of search is a good<br/>
&gt;way to find out who is linking to you. Just put in your own URL after <br/>
&gt;&quot;+link:&quot; and &quot;-url:&quot;.   -Ann Zeise<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please forward this notice to homeschooling and alternative education<br/>
&gt;email lists, online newsletter editors, support group lists, <br/>
&gt;educational reference lists - anyplace Home Education Magazine&#39;s <br/>
&gt;award-winning website might be linked.<br/>
