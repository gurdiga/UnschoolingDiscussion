<div id="ygrps-yiv-368578700">I&#39;m reading this book now and enjoying it.  (And the Skylark Sings With<br/>
Me)  We had David come and speak with our HS support group.  It was<br/>
great!  He really gave us all food for thought.  I saw lots of nods of<br/>
agreement with things that he said.  He pointed out there is not one way<br/>
or one right way to Hs, but we need to work to find what works for each<br/>
child now and realize it will change in the future.<br/>
From one of the attendees: &quot;It was very inspiring and just what I needed<br/>
to hear&quot;.  <br/>

 I have a Brother and his family there who are vacillating about<br/>
homeschooling.  My SIL just quit college in her last class for her degree<br/>
in order to do what she really wants and stay home to raise her kids (girls<br/>
age 2.5 and 4.)  (Hooray for Independence!!  Finding freedom from<br/>
expectations and IS &quot;teamplayer&quot; etics!!!  Hooray for being true to<br/>
yourself and your dreams!!!)  Sniff, I&#39;m so proud of her....  She was about<br/>
to get her degree to teach HS History and was profoundly unhappy, crying<br/>
herself to sleep every night and getting more depressed the closer she got<br/>
to being gone from her kids full time.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of that, do any of you work from home folks have any advice I can<br/>
pass on to my DH?  He is just trying to get a MLM business off the ground<br/>
and wants to get away from his 9-5 job and back to his family.  Any ideas<br/>
about types of businesses or home based jobs that are successful?  Any sage<br/>
words of advice from you been there done that folks?<br/>

Falls would be about a 9 1/2 hour car trip for me, so unless I find a<br/>
way to combine with something else, it is not likely I&#39;m afraid.  Too<br/>
bad too, because I&#39;m told that in spring that is a wonderful part of the<br/>
world!<br/>
