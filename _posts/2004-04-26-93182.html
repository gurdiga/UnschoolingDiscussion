<div id="ygrps-yiv-460688549">Wes Beach sent this to the HomeSchool Assocation of Caifornia (HSC) <br/>
email list and I thought people on this list would enjoy and appreciate <br/>
it, too:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Human learning, [Seymour] Sarason [psychologist at Yale] argues, will<br/>
proceed without respect to any predictions of normative measures of<br/>
&#39;intelligence&#39; so long as several fundamental and comparatively simple<br/>
conditions are met.  Of these, the most important is that all students<br/>
learn best and most quickly when self-interest orients and drives the<br/>
search for information, understanding, and skill.  This is equally true<br/>
of infants, young children, adolescents, and younger and older adults,<br/>
and it applies equally, without respect to assessments of mental<br/>
capacity.  What this means, if Sarason is right, is that any student<br/>
who chose spontaneously and voluntarily, on the basis of his or her own<br/>
inclinations and experience, to become a brain surgeon could probably<br/>
prepare adequately to enter that career by the age of twenty if those<br/>
in a position to support that ambition provided the necessary<br/>
assistance or at least did not stand in the way.&quot;<br/>
