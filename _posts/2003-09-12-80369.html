<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155686730">I have some solid information for you all, so I thought I&#39;d do an update.<br/>
<br/>
The Live and Learn Unschooling conference will take place August 27-29, 2004 <br/>
at the Marriott Hotel in Peabody, Massachusetts. Peabody is 15 miles north of <br/>
Boston, and accessible easily to a lot of interesting places, including <br/>
Boston, Salem, etc, and is an easy trip further north to New Hampshire and Maine.<br/>
<br/>
The hotel is excited to have us, and is giving us lots of space. We&#39;re also <br/>
excited about some of the planned speakers. Barbara Sher, author of Wishcraft: <br/>
How to Get What You Really Want and other books, as well as the Emmy-nominated <br/>
PBS special It&#39;s Only Too Late If You Don&#39;t Start Now, How to Create Your <br/>
Second Life at Any Age, has agreed to come. She is working on a book for parents <br/>
about supporting their children in their lives and dreams, and is looking <br/>
forward to joining us.  (She still needs your contributions, so keep them coming.)<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd will also be coming, but you all knew that. Didn&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
Other things in the planning are a great storyteller, a contradance (would it <br/>
be New England without one?), and an optional Whale Watch on Sunday <br/>
afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll update with more speakers as I hear from them.<br/>

He&#39;s awesome.  I just noticed that his page has a link to a homeschool<br/>
newspaper I&#39;ve never seen before, The Link.  I wonder if that means he<br/>
homeschools.  He also lives in MA.<br/>
