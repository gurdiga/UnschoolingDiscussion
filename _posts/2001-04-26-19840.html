      Hi!  I am new to home/un schooling and have been looking for <br/>
people who unschool in indiana and have not had much luck finding <br/>
anyone.  Where in Indiana do u live? Do you know of any unschooling <br/>
support groups in IN?  I live in Danville which is about 15 miles due <br/>
west of Indy.  Looking forward to hearing from you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987802794">Hi Mary.  I&#39;m in Greenwood - about 15 miles south of Indy.  I do not<br/>
know of anyone in my area that unschools, though there are quite a<br/>
few school-at-homers.  My kids are still young (4 and 1).  Sorry I<br/>
couldn&#39;t be much help.<br/>

moved from the southside about 18 months ago.  Tami let me know when <br/>
you plan to be at the museum.  our next few  weekends are kinda busy <br/>
but we may be able to work something out.  My children are younger <br/>
than yours, 7, 5 and 2.  But it would be nice to hear how things have <br/>
gone for you so far. Thanks.,<br/>
