mention circumcision on this list.  I know I&#39;ve heard people mention <br/>
spanking on this list.  I&#39;ve gone from a parents-have-the right-to-<br/>
spank-and-how-dare-you-say-otherwise to a anti-spanking position in <br/>
the last few years.  <br/>
<br/>
But if I say that I support abortion, then I am inconsistent.  I have <br/>
heard people support abortion because, &quot;No one has the right to <br/>
invade my body against my will&quot;.  But that doesn&#39;t sound like a very <br/>
unschooling attitude.  What would we say if someone on the list <br/>
said, &quot;No one has the right to make me get out of bed and make me get <br/>
them something to eat&quot;.  There is a child involved and the humane <br/>
thing to do is to love that child no matter what emotional problems <br/>
we have that are keeping us in bed or keeping us from wanting to <br/>
allow the child to live inside of us. <br/>
<br/>
I guess the problem is where we think the &quot;fetus&quot; becomes a person.  <br/>
I tend to think it&#39;s when egg meets sperm, but that&#39;s something we <br/>
could argue about forever I guess.  But I think we could all agree <br/>
that there is a point in pregnancy where the fetus becomes a person, <br/>
whether we believe it is at conception or at viability.  And <br/>
viability age is becoming earlier and earlier thanks to modern <br/>
technology.  So I would think that a partial birth, mid or late term <br/>
abortion when the child could potentially survive outside of the womb <br/>
should be pretty much agreed upon.  <br/>

I and many others don&#39;t believe there IS a child involved.<br/>
ALSO<br/>
Just because one is Pro-choice, does not mean they are Pro-abortion. and I <br/>
don&#39;t think the term &quot;Pro-life&quot; to mean Anti-Abortion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, but now you&#39;re getting into a political discussion of whether <br/>
abortion should be legal or not.  I was simply saying that I think <br/>
that abortion is inconsistent with an unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I even said anything about abortion at all is because <br/>
someone said that they wouldn&#39;t tell their kids not to have sex with <br/>
someone whose baby they wouldn&#39;t want to have--that&#39;s what birth <br/>
control and maybe even abortion are for.  I replied with saying that <br/>
abortion doesn&#39;t fit with unschooling because it doesn&#39;t take into <br/>
account the needs of the child who was conceived.<br/>

you take that viewpoint away, how does it have anything to do with <br/>
unschooling?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-179532071"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; See? you are operating from the viewpoint that there is a child <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you take that viewpoint away, how does it have anything to do with <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, I guess that&#39;s where the difference of opinion is.  If there is <br/>
a child involved, it has everything to do with unschooling, <br/>
children&#39;s rights, and human compassion for a helpless child.  If <br/>
there isn&#39;t a child involved, it isn&#39;t as much of an unschooling <br/>
issue, except that we wouldn&#39;t mind telling our kids that it&#39;s ok to <br/>
have sex and then have an abortion if they get pregnant. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I just can&#39;t get past my belief that there *is* a child <br/>
involved and keep forgetting that some people don&#39;t think there is.  <br/>
In my mind, I keep comparing it to how years ago people felt that <br/>
newborns didn&#39;t feel pain, so they felt no need to anesthetize them <br/>
for circumcisions or other surgeries.  <br/>
