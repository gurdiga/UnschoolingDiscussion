<div id="ygrps-yiv-518434984">I sent this to the Pastor of my church, but am in need of some heavy support. <br/>
It has been a long road for our family, and we deal with emotional and mental <br/>
problems with Tiffers all the time from the last series of visits with her <br/>
bio mom. I am just so sad. <br/>
thanks for listening<br/>
Stephanie<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Thad and Jerilynn-<br/>
    Ron and I married in May 98. We both have children of previous <br/>
relationships, but we have the intention of adopting each other&#39;s children <br/>
(and having more) to join our family together in love and the final bond of <br/>
commitment. This my be odd to you, but it is what we feel. So on to what is <br/>
going on. <br/>
    Before we got married, we decided that Tiffany would be first in the <br/>
adoption, because she is the one with the most to gain. Her Biological mother <br/>
was willing to sign, and there are several problems surrounding her mother, <br/>
including Tiffany&#39;s appearance, and sudden fears and problems that we had to <br/>
deal with, and are still dealing with. On the 11th of October we will have <br/>
the money. We had the papers and we are just waiting for the funds to get <br/>
this finished. It has been a wonderful thought knowing that Tiffany would <br/>
finally feel secure and know that she was finally loved by a &quot;Mommy.&quot; <br/>
    About a month and a half ago, Tiffany&#39;s bio mom showed up here, but she <br/>
only wanted to know about the adoption, not about Tiffany. We told her that <br/>
we were waiting for funds, and she even offered to pay. We cut a vacation <br/>
short to be here at the house, just in case she showed up to pay for <br/>
Tiffany&#39;s adoption. <br/>
    Yesterday, she was at the door again. She had court papers over 2 years <br/>
old, saying that she wanted to take Tiffany for her visitation. WHAT? We told <br/>
her to contact the Friend of the Court, and what about the adoption. She <br/>
flatly stated that she had changed her mind. <br/>
    We have made several calls to the county offices. We have even tried the <br/>
deal that the courts, themselves use in child abandonment cases. If a child <br/>
is not visited by a parent for 2 consecutive years, the court can petition a <br/>
motion of abandonment. Today we were informed that this is not the actual <br/>
case. There needs to be a nonpayment of substantial child support along with <br/>
the visitation refusal. In the 2 years that Tiffany has not been contacted, <br/>
we have received less than $300, and it was received only after the court <br/>
issued a warrant for the mother, and she was indeed arrested. I am thinking <br/>
that the same happened yesterday.  (that she was again arrested) <br/>
    I am so disheartened and am crying off and on. Tiffany does not know this <br/>
woman, and thinks of me as mommy, as if someone could not already see that. <br/>
Yesterday, Tiffany wanted to do everything by my side. She usually holds <br/>
Daddy&#39;s hand, and is a Daddy&#39;s girl, but I think that she felt the pain, and <br/>
chose to grip on me. <br/>
    No offense, but this stinks. I have been praying, and I am looking for <br/>
the &quot;silver lining.&quot; Ron is going to try to talk to her, and see about still <br/>
being able to finally rid our beautiful child of any bleakness in her life. <br/>
Right now it is just hard to see the good in this. <br/>
 Thanks for &quot;listening&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Guessing wildly here, it sounds like she talked to someone about her plan to <br/>
relinquish her daughter and they criticized her intensely for it.  Just a <br/>
theory.<br/>

Hun, I am soooo sorry.  There are not words to say to you, but just know that <br/>
there is love and caring out here, and that all your friends on the loop will <br/>
be holding special thoughts and prayers for you and your family.  We are here <br/>
to listen, and sometimes you just have to kick and scream, get it off your <br/>
chest, and clear the way to think.  Best of everything<br/>

We thought about that. We think it has to do with a new policy they have in <br/>
effect here in St. Clair County, MI.<br/>
If the support paying parent does not pay child support for an amount of six <br/>
consecutive weeks, the Friend of the Court office shall interview the case, <br/>
and place the matter in front of the courts. they then issue a bench warrant <br/>
for said parent. I know that when she came to our home the previous time, she <br/>
was just released from jail (bench warrant). This time, I think that the same <br/>
happened. My dh hopes that he will be able to talk to her and see about <br/>
changing her mind. We think that she is doing this to be a bother to us. <br/>
About 18 months ago, she and my ex husband started dating, and told our whole <br/>
community they were trying to make us jealous. Ok.... Jealous about what? <br/>
Both my dh, and I, left them, and I was awarded custody, and dh took custody <br/>
from an unfit mother. we are hoping that she will just leave us alone.<br/>
