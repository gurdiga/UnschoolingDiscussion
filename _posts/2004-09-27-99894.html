I don&#39;t  know that people who started attachment parenting and really <br/>
trusting <br/>
kids  later in the kids&#39; lives will get those results, but there are people  <br/>
reading whose kids are still little who are still in the decision making  <br/>
phase.<br/>
<br/>
I think trusting them will pay off in unimaginable  ways.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Always the one to chime in on  &quot;yes-it-CAN-work-later-in-life&quot;----and here I <br/>
am again.<br/>
 <br/>
I pretty much trusted Cam (within limits, I guess)----and doing the school  <br/>
thang kind of stomps on freedom&#39;s feet a bit, so I *know* I could&#39;ve been  more <br/>
trusting had we not been in school for eight years. <br/>
 <br/>
But we didn&#39;t go the AP/LLL route, and he&#39;s STILL incredibly  trustworthy <br/>
(and trusting). It CAN be done---or rather UNdone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Adding my dittoes to this. We did the LLL thing, left it for awhile and came back to <br/>
unschooling two years ago. It&#39;s amazing how powerful trust is. Even in 18 mos. the feeling <br/>
around the house is so different.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m finding hard to discuss with other parents is why their estimation of what <br/>
qualifies as good use of time is the decision/jurisdiction of the parent...<br/>

But I  don&#39;t think they&#39;re addicted to empowerment.<br/>

 <br/>
Yeah, I know.  Me either.  Empowerment as a way of life.  <br/>
