<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569228536">I too have really dug into the whole no limits no questioning thing with my <br/>
kids as far as food and stuff. Not that I think I restricted them before but <br/>
yes I gently tried to persuade and isn&#39; that the same thing? I remember a <br/>
few of you here that said they were still trying to get the hang of it all. <br/>
So just a little story.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 year old the other day was asking for pudding. She really hadn&#39;t had <br/>
much of substantial eating all day. I was leary and trying to suggest a few <br/>
other things. It had seemed like she would go to bed with snacks all day and <br/>
that isn&#39;t like her so I wondered. When my husband asked why the baby was <br/>
upset, I said because she wants pudding and I want her to eat. So being my <br/>
better half when I&#39;m not, he said, &quot;Isn&#39;t pudding eating?&quot; Next minute she <br/>
was happily sitting on the kitchen counter eating pudding. After she <br/>
finished, she asked for meatball and ravioli&#39;s which she ate a generous <br/>
plate of. Proved a point to me!!!<br/>
<br/>
Not 2 nights later, my 7 year old son was as usual putting everyone to bed <br/>
before him. I stay up as long as he needs to. He was happily doing his own <br/>
thing and I was watching mindless TV when he came into the living room and <br/>
told me that his body was telling him he was tired. It was 1:00 a.m. and he <br/>
was finally ready.<br/>
<br/>
It all does work. Patience on our part is the hardest thing. The kids breeze <br/>
right through it!<br/>
