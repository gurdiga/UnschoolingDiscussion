<div id="ygrps-yiv-117861159">Hi, please help,<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have any chess books around their house that they find fairly<br/>
kid-friendly?  I have Harvey Kidder&#39;s &quot;Chess for Kids&quot; book and set, which<br/>
has been terrific, and my 6 year old is now facinated by chess.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for something in the improve-your-strategy area that won&#39;t be<br/>
too dry.  (I own &quot;Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess&quot; which contains excellent<br/>
information, but even I find it an astonishingly dull read.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m back in Germany and don&#39;t have the option of going to the bookstore and<br/>
flipping through a number of books, so I appreciate any help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This may or may not be helpful for you since you already have a chess set <br/>
and book, but my son got a great chess game called Chess Teacher for his <br/>
birthday last year.  It has a description of the pieces&#39; moves on the <br/>
pieces so that each player can see right away how each piece <br/>
moves.  There&#39;s nothing in there about strategy, though, but it&#39;s a good <br/>
start.  We have a lot of fun with it.  Here&#39;s a link to a description of <br/>
the game:<br/>
