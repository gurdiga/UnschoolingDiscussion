<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730670001"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When you unschool what do you do at the end of the year where I live<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you have to do either a portfolio or a test.<br/>
<br/>
In Washington this is required too.  A lot of people just buy a cheap<br/>
test, have their kid take it, then file it away.  Parents are required to<br/>
make a good faith attempt to remedy areas of deficiency.  One woman buys<br/>
the test that is a school year below where her children would be<br/>
age-wise.<br/>
People with more energy, or who like this sort of project, keep a<br/>
portfolio.  Really just a scrapbook, don&#39;t you think?  Save some of<br/>
child&#39;s favorite projects, or a photo if project is 3 dimensional, or a<br/>
paragraph or two if project has nothing physical to save.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that these requirements are for others.  Do what you must to<br/>
fulfill it, while knowing that how you and your children feel about what<br/>
you accomplish is what really matters.  As children get older, hand more<br/>
of this responsibility to them.  ie, &quot;what do you think matters about<br/>
what you did this month?  How can you document it?  (again, sample or<br/>
photo or brief write-up).<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Actually, they used to do long distance portfolios/evaluations at the Family <br/>
Learning Organization, do they still do that?  All neat and nicely bundled.<br/>

be evaluated by a certified teacher and the results sent back within 6 weeks.<br/>
