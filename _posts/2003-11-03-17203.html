<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any experiences with general ankle injuries, how long to &quot;wait and see&quot;,<br/>
&gt; etc., appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve only had sprains, both mild and bad ones, and they usually swell up<br/>
some.  But if it were me, and I weren&#39;t in excruciating pain and could still<br/>
move the ankle a bit, I&#39;d go with the wait and see attitude.<br/>
<br/>
The ankle and the doctor will still be existance tomorrow or whenever you<br/>
need them, and they won&#39;t have nearly the line that the emergency room will<br/>
have.  <br/>
