<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132366426">I need so ideas, Jaiden and Avery (5 and 2) have both discovered the PS2, unfortunantly we only have two games that they really like-Simpsons Road Rage, and Tekken Tag<br/>
<br/>
The other games are Jasons, sniper, bounty hunter games, that he has a hard time playing<br/>
<br/>
They both have b-days coming up and family are starting to ask what they want, and I was thinking about getting them so more games, but I don&#39;t have any ideas what to get. We took them to look at games so that they could give us an idea, but it didn&#39;t work very well, They just didn&#39;t know, what would be fun or not.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re don&#39;t have any restictions on what kind of games they can play, except that they need to be PS or PS2 games. :)<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? I was thinking of Soul Caliber(but mostly because I really want that game), they don&#39;t want anything &quot;babyish&quot;-Jaidens words, and I&#39;m not sure what that means, and he hasn&#39;t been able to tell me what games are babyish.<br/>
<br/>
(We thought about going to Hollywood and/or Blockbuster and renting a bunch and letting them see what they would like, but funds are soooo limited right now it&#39;s really not an option.)<br/>

I just asked Alisha for a recommendation.  She said maybe The <br/>
Emperor&#39;s New Groove or SSX Snowboarding.  She&#39;s 11 and likes both of <br/>
them and doesn&#39;t consider them babyish.  She also said maybe Harry <br/>
Potter, although she hasn&#39;t played it herself yet.  <br/>

Do you know about gamefly?  It works like netflix, only for video <br/>
games. They have games for all different systems.  Maybe people could <br/>
get you a gift certificate for month gamefly instead of a video <br/>
game?  <br/>
<br/>
We like that a lot because you can sample different games. There&#39;s no <br/>
rush to send them back, just like netflix.  They also offer you the <br/>
opportunity to buy games at discounts.  <br/>

Blockbuster has a deal where you pay a monthly fee and you can take out one<br/>
game at a time, but trade them in as often as you like.  We did this in the<br/>
fall so that the kids could try out a lot of games to see which ones they<br/>
wanted to ask for for gifts.  I think it runs about $20/month.  Maybe they<br/>
could ask for that and a gift certificate for a media store.  Then, they<br/>
could test drive several games, then buy their favorites.<br/>

You can try Crash Bandicoot or Ratchet and Clank.  If you have either Game Stop or EB Games in your area, I would suggest going in.  They have lots of used games, which is the way we go.  Usually a lot less expensive, and one of them is running a buy 2 used games, get one free deal.  Also, talk to the people working there.  The people in our area are really hard core gamers, and know just about everything about all the games.  They will tell you if a game is not so good, or if it is really worth the money.  Hope this helps you out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887496878">Our favorite PS2 games are Kingdom Hearts (lots of strategy and fun side<br/>
games, have played it through several times and still enjoy it), Ratchet &<br/>
Clank and it&#39;s sequel, Jak & Daxter (the sequel is good too but very<br/>
difficult, I&#39;m the only person I know who has gotten all the way through),<br/>
Dark Cloud and Dark Cloud2 (the sequel is even better than the first, it can<br/>
take weeks to play if you complete all of the side goals.  It can be easily<br/>
played without having played the first one, the characters are completely<br/>
different from the first game)<br/>
<br/>
As for Soul Caliber II, in my opinion, it&#39;s the most boring game we have.<br/>
It&#39;s all just one on one battling.  No real story line, no strategy.  I<br/>
would make sure you&#39;ve played it before deciding, my son really wanted it<br/>
otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have made the purchase.  Even he is bored with it and<br/>
seldom gets it out to play.<br/>

What about a gift card from either?  They can rent several different games <br/>
and when the next holiday rolls around, perhaps they&#39;ll have a better idea of <br/>
what they want.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is worse than spending $40 on a video game they won&#39;t play - can&#39;t <br/>
return them once they&#39;ve been opened, so you&#39;re stuck.<br/>
<br/>
Also, check w/ Blockbuster - they have a $19.95/month video game membership <br/>
where they can rent unlimited video games (1 at a time per membership, I <br/>
believe) and there are no late fees so you can keep one out all month if they fall <br/>
in love with it.  Or you can rent 1 a day for 30 days, whatever is your <br/>
pleasure.  Do check with your local franchise for all the details.<br/>
<br/>
My 9 year old recommends Ratchet and Clank or Ratchet and Clank 2.  The R&C 2 <br/>
has a strategy guide available for about $14 that my kids adore to read and <br/>
it helps them figure out the trickier parts.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and let us know what you decide!<br/>
