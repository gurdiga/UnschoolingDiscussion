<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757984790"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;But one thing it talked about was that kids are so RESTRICTED - just in <br/>
&gt;&gt;physical movement - that he considers that many learning disabilities, <br/>
&gt;&gt;including dyslexia, may be directly a result of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>children NOT having enough large motor movement when they are from 1 to 3 <br/>
years old.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I definitely think this is a major factor in all the senory integration <br/>
issues that kids have nowadays. I once had an Occupational Therapist tell me <br/>
that a kid who is running, jumping, swinging, hanging etc. is much less <br/>
likely to have problems with SID.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He says, for example, that in 1960 2 yo&#39;s spent about 200 hours in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a car (not in a car seat, either). In a recent year - (1999?) they spent 500 <br/>
hours strapped in carseats. He says parents don&#39;t &quot;make up for&quot; the loss of <br/>
movement-time --- even though there is lots of evidence that points up the <br/>
importance of physical movement on brain development in those first few <br/>
years of life.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And it seems the pendulum has swung so far in the cerebral direction as far <br/>
as the first three years goes. Parents are out there with stimulating <br/>
mobiles and video tapes. Sounds like he&#39;s saying a good trip to the park is <br/>
the important educational activity.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He talks about how brain development is dependent on appropriate amounts <br/>
&gt;&gt;of challenge and how difficult that is to create in a classroom -- I just <br/>
&gt;&gt;wanted to YELL right there in the bookstore -- THE KID WILL KNOW how much <br/>
&gt;&gt;challenge is optimal - let them work it out themselves!!!! Give them <br/>
&gt;&gt;freedom and they&#39;ll challenge themselves JUST RIGHT!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You go girl! ;-)<br/>
