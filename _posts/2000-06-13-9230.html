<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080257684">Hi, I&#39;ve been lurking and enjoying the discussions for a few weeks. <br/>
Thought I would join in the fray:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why do you un/homeschool:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest son and I were unschooling since he was an infant without even<br/>
knowing it! We just went with his interests and expanded as he grew. Over<br/>
time, we have completely immersed ourselves in trucks, planes, knights,<br/>
dinosaurs and ancient Egypt, (to name a few). It occurred to me that we<br/>
should keep this going and I started doing all the reading I could about<br/>
homeshooling. The more I read, the more I&#39;m convinced it is the way to go<br/>
for our family. Alex has always been extremely &quot;reserved&quot; with outsiders<br/>
and has insisted since he could talk that he did not want to go to<br/>
school.  I think he would have been a basket case this past year if he<br/>
was forced to attend kindergarten and his incredibly bright, inquisitive<br/>
mind would have gotten lost in the process. Also, I want to preserve my<br/>
childrens sense of self.  they are wonderful people and they need to<br/>
develop and grow at their own pace.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How many children do you have? 	<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	2, a boy and a girl<br/>
	Alex, age 5 (6 in July) and Sean Marie age 2 1/2<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What are your children&#39;s most recent interests?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I listed a lot of Alex&#39;s above. He also has become passionate about<br/>
swimming and hopefully will take lessons soon. He has never liked<br/>
participating in class settings or without me, but he seems to be<br/>
evolving from that stage and is almost ready to try a class out.  Sean<br/>
Marie at this point pretty much follows her brothers interests, but she<br/>
has shown to have a natural way with animals. She also loves to dress up,<br/>
dance and generally be a whirl wind of activity. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What area does your family live in?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>About an hour north of Chicago, IL<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you have any pets?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yes:  1 dog, 3 cats and 66 rats.  I have a &quot;pet rat rescue&quot; or<br/>
shelter, taking in unwanted rats and trying to find them homes. Many end<br/>
up spending their lives with us. I have a web site at<br/>
www.geocities.com/pet_rat_rescue <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Anything else you would like to add?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have had a &quot;family bed&quot; since Alex was 2 months old. We all like this<br/>
arrangement and I am steeling myself for the day when the kids tell me<br/>
they want to sleep in their own rooms.  I did not nurse my children<br/>
(gasp) for medical and personal reasons and we are as close as any mother<br/>
and her children can be. Everything is what you make it.<br/>
<br/>
We are irreligious but moral, good people and intellectually interested<br/>
in all religions.<br/>
<br/>
We have a dream to someday live on many acres with many animals (well,<br/>
that last part is my dream).  I loved hearing about you &quot;farmers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents about the TV thing.  My mantra is &quot;all things in<br/>
moderation&quot;.  TV&#39;s do have an off button, ours spends most of its time in<br/>
that state.  There is A LOT of crap out their but we don&#39;t watch it.  We<br/>
enjoy the goodies on PBS, Discovery etc.  My kids know when the TV gets<br/>
turned off it stays off.  From not being exposed to mindless crap (which<br/>
I&#39;d include lots of kids programing) they don&#39;t have much interest in it.<br/>
Except Pokemon, but everybody has their faults, I myself am an X Files<br/>
junky. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for going on so long, hope I didn&#39;t sound too defensive.&gt; ~ Shelley</div>

Hi Shelley!<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t think you sounded defensive at all. It was so refreshing to hear how you&#39;re letting your children go at their own pace rather than rushing them to do &quot;age appropriate&quot; activities. &nbsp;For instance, my daughter has never been left with a babysitter because 1) dh and I don&#39;t feel comfortable doing that yet and 2) Accalia wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with that. People are shocked that she&#39;s almost one and has spent almost all of her time with us &lt;gasp!&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also loved to hear you talk about the family bed. We also do the family bed and I don&#39;t even want to think about Accalia saying she&#39;s ready for her own bed or room. Accalia nurses and I plan to let her decide when she&#39;s ready to quit. It has been so valuable to us in our bonding and other aspects of our relationship, but I don&#39;t think anyone would doubt the closeness among you and your children just because you didn&#39;t nurse.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, glad to have met you.<br>

it is very stressful &quot;getting them off the tube&quot; now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter started out just mildly interested, while she was play with other <br/>
things....I am not sure what or when she became &quot;hooked&quot; but it has taken <br/>
lots determination from me to get her un-hooked.  She is finally after weeks <br/>
using her imagination, willingly and happily.  One show a day is the rule in <br/>
our house for little ones, but now most days she does not even ask for that.    <br/>
YEPPY! (only took me a couple of weeks, she was hooked bad!)<br/>

Hi Julie,  this was the case with us earlier this spring... I got the boys <br/>
off the tube for a while, then as time went on, we slid, and they began <br/>
watching too much again.  So, now we are trying to back off again.  <br/>
Congratulations on your success.  I know it is not an easy feat to achieve!  <br/>

Glad to know we&#39;re not the only ones &quot;babying&quot; our baby (one year today!). We&#39;ve found it&#39;s possible to have quality couple and family time while she&#39;s with us, and frankly I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll feel very comfortable being apart from her until she&#39;s no longer nursing and maybe not even then.<br>

Yeah, we still have Accalia&#39;s unused crib set up, but we&#39;re planning to tear it down soon. Although, it is a good place to store laundry :).<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel bad because we&#39;ve never used the crib that my MIL set up at their house for our visits. And my mom bought a playpen just in case we&#39;d want to put the grandbabies in it from time to time, but that sits unused in a corner. Ah well.<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of sling do you use? We&#39;ve never really used one with Accalia. I have a NoJo but really don&#39;t like it, and I&#39;m contemplating buying a Maya Wrap Pouch. I always hear such good things about OTSBH, but I&#39;m not a big fan of all of that padding.<br>

slings in that time as I used one 24/7 for over 2 yrs with my second son),<br/>
so obviously I liked that design.  Well, I just got a Maya Wrap for my<br/>
most recent baby and it is absolutely fabulous and much better than the<br/>
others.  The fact that it doesn&#39;t have a &quot;tail&quot; (the fabric, instead is<br/>
the same width from one end ot the other), the larger rings, and no<br/>
padding make it much easier to adjust and more comfortable than the other<br/>
slings I&#39;ve used.  I let another long-time-padded-sling wearer use it in a<br/>
pinch the other day and she agreed that if she had one, she&#39;d have used<br/>
her slings even more and for longer.<br/>
<br/>
I love my Maya Wrap.  Love it love it love:)<br/>

I know that Accalia would love to be carried at least for a little bit every once in a while, so that&#39;s why I have to get a new sling. Hmm, maybe Accalia would like me to use her birthday money for that :)<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733869">it has fabric that pulls through the rings, but it is as wide as the<br/>

tighten just the bottom part or just the top part to make minute<br/>
adjustments, depending on what you are doing (for example, with my baby, I<br/>
tighten the top part to hold his head closer when he is nursing and loosen<br/>
