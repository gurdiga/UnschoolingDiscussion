<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881256013">I&#39;m glad to hear this, though I must say again that it was not my <br/>
experience when I discovered my pregnancy, 11 years ago.  My <br/>
choice was between living a kind of life I had almost lived (not quite <br/>
sunk to the same depths of poverty) living a more go-getting life <br/>
with my child in someone else&#39;s care (not for me, this one) giving <br/>
my child up for adoption (which I would not have been able to carry <br/>
through, come the time, and I know this, deeply, I did want this <br/>
baby) or terminating the pregnancy.  I chose the last option.  I&#39;m <br/>
very glad I had the choice.<br/>
