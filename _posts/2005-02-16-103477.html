<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000236111">Hello all. First-time poster, long-time lurker Julie here from <br/>
Athens, GA, area. (If there are any secular unschoolers in the <br/>
Athens area on this list, I&#39;d love to talk to you!). <br/>
  We have close friends in St. Louis who&#39;ve taken us to great places <br/>
there, particularly w/ our now almost 6-yr-old dd in mind. So, <br/>
besides the Live & Learn Conference, there&#39;s:<br/>
   The Magic House, a neat, hands-on, fun science-oriented place <br/>
good for kids probably up to age 10 or so; <br/>
  one of the best and most respected botanical gardens in the world; <br/>
  a science museum (can&#39;t remember the name) that would suit kids <br/>
maybe 8 & older;<br/>
  a place called Grant&#39;s Farm - free, you take a tram through the <br/>
farm where all sorts of animals roam around (it&#39;s sponsored by <br/>
Anheiser Busch, so 1/2 way through, the tram stops at the petting <br/>
zoo and the adults get free beer!! Yahoo!);<br/>
  speaking of beer, there&#39;s the terrific tour of the Anheiser Busch <br/>
brewery, which really is interesting, and the stables where the <br/>
clydesdales live in a manner to which we&#39;d all like to become <br/>
accustomed!;<br/>
  There&#39;s a good butterfly house w/ an antique carousel next door.<br/>
  There&#39;s the St. Louis Zoo, which is located in a park where <br/>
there&#39;s also an art museum and plenty of paths for walking, biking, <br/>
rollerblading, great place to throw a frisbee, etc. <br/>
  Oh, and there&#39;s the Arch, right on the Mississippi River; and the <br/>
Cardinals, and the Rams, and ...there&#39;s lots more, but I sound like <br/>
I&#39;m w/ the St. Louis tourist bureau.<br/>
  I&#39;m looking forward to putting faces to names I see on this list.<br/>
Best,<br/>
Julie H.</div>
