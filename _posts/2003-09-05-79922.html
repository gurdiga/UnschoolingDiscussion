<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545770307">&quot;These are some really good ideas!!  Thanks for sharing.  I am going to do<br/>
the BHAG with my dd tomorrow.  I love these out-of-the-box ideas because it<br/>
is great to use non-schoolish solutions to &quot;schoolish desires.&quot;<br/>
 Besides, I<br/>
wonder what kind of BHAGs I can come up with for myself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Thank Julie, not me!!:)<br/>
I&#39;ve always loved writing down goals and interests, but the BHAG thing hit a note with me and helped us verbalize our wildest desires in a new way. So thanks for a great article Julie...I couldn&#39;t remember for the life of me which HEM that was or who had written it.<br/>
