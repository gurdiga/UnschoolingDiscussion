&lt;&lt; Julie S.---who will absolutely strangle the next person who says she is<br/>
wonderful&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But Julie, we ALL think you are wonderful!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah yes, she can&#39;t strangle us all at once.<br/>
<br/>
In case anyone missed it, two guys were awakened by an angry bear thrashing <br/>
their campsite, and while one whispered &quot;Oh no!  what are we going to do!  that <br/>
bear will kill us!  Holy shit.  We need a plan!&quot; the other was just putting <br/>
on his hiking books and lacing them up, taking his time to do it really <br/>
thoroughly, tying good knots, and not saying a word.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you think you can outrun a BEAR!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun *you*!&quot;</div>
