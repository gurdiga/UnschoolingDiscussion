<div id="ygrps-yiv-576385297">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
It is almost time for our next trip to Tn and this visit I will be<br/>
leaving the kids with the grandparents for about 2 weeks.  I want to<br/>
get lots of stuff to keep me company on the way home and then going<br/>
back (12 hours each way). I get soooo bored without the kids.  The<br/>
kids and I usually do book tapes and some fun older and newer rock<br/>
music.  What should I get for JUST ME!!!  On my list already are<br/>
Sandra&#39;s parenting tapes...any other ideas???!!! <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

PamS has tapes from her two workshops on Mathematical Joy.  Those&#39;ll<br/>
fire up your brain.  Also available from www.hsc.org is a keynote speech<br/>
by Linda Dobson on Homeschooling Success Stories.  I find that to be<br/>
nicely cheerful and uplifting.<br/>
<br/>
I personally love talk radio, so you can download radio programs on<br/>
topics of interest from www.npr.org, if you have the right technology to<br/>
transfer it to your car.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682218261">I would get a book on tape for adults.  I&#39;m listening to Diana Gabaldon&#39;s The <br/>
Fiery Cross right now.  There are 40 tapes to that one.  It would probably <br/>
take you there and back and beyond.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two of my favorite books on tape are:  To Kill a Mockingbird...the lady who <br/>
reads it is WONDERFUL...such a full range of different voices, and the kids <br/>
loved it.  <br/>
<br/>
And the second is &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;  I LOVED that story....it&#39;s such an <br/>
education in what a real Geisha was...so many people think prostitute.  What an <br/>
eye opener.<br/>
