<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185139767">Back in August of this year our local list owner tried to lump us all as  <br/>
homeschoolers. As a matter a fact she emailed me and asked what I thought about  <br/>
just using the term homeschoolers instead of UNschooling. I couldn&#39;t believe <br/>
it.  I&#39;ve been silenced from this list before because they are mostly  <br/>
homeschoolers in the traditional sense. She had forwarded me Helen&#39;s  thoughts and <br/>
position on it. I wrote back after being bitter for several days  and told her <br/>
that I would NOT like to be lumped together. That said I was  slightly annoyed <br/>
when she posted stating that she was one of the voices for our  state in some <br/>
NHEN discussion or article. Huh?<br/>
 <br/>
When traditional homeschooling-HSLDA supporters start saying they are  <br/>
speaking for me I get a lil annoyed.<br/>
I do speak up (and duck) when discussions take place but im not very  <br/>
supported at all. As a matter a fact our state list has a good 200-300 people  and <br/>
when I post I get attacked for my thoughts by a select few and NO one else  <br/>
speaks unless that are attacking me. Well one other unschooler on the list  <br/>
does/did but that was/is all. <br/>
 <br/>
I keep hearing locally that diversity will be respected but still im told  <br/>
that I say UNschooling,UNschooler too much. HUH?<br/>

*************************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is where you&#39;re wrong. He *IS* talking about us! Because  they lump <br/>
all  <br/>
of us together as &quot;homeschoolers&quot;---and people like  Helen Hegener, who is <br/>
ALSO <br/>
trying to lump us all together---- and make us  all one big happy group.<br/>
<br/>
And again, I&#39;ll scream! &lt;g&gt;: I insist  that we&#39;re NOT homeschoolers to  <br/>
anyone <br/>
that asks. I insist that  we&#39;re UNschoolers because it matters to me that  we <br/>
NOT be lumped  together with those freaks.<br/>
<br/>
They have a huge lobby, through   H$LDA, that is VERY visible and loud.  They <br/>
spend lots of money and  manpower on articles like this one----even  though <br/>
it&#39;s not all  peachy-keen and good----because it may inspire MORE freaks  to <br/>
join  <br/>
their cause. They don&#39;t care how we all look to the outside world if   they <br/>
can <br/>
recruit another freaky family.<br/>
<br/>
It only hurts *US*.  Unschoolers aren&#39;t visible enough or loud enough (yet!  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;  give me time! &lt;g&gt;) to counter these stupid beliefs. &quot;Normal&quot;   people <br/>
read <br/>
that and say, &quot;See, Thelma! ALL them homeschoolers are just  a  bunch of <br/>
crazy <br/>
freaks who want to take over the country and rule  the world  through the <br/>
Bible. <br/>
Bunch of freaks!&quot;. Hell, *I* say the  same things!<br/>
<br/>
As long as all homeschoolers are lumped together, then he  IS talking about  <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, do NOT call me a homeschooling  mom!<br/>

I&#39;m guessing you must feel like that wild and wanton mom at the park <br/>
that lets her kids take their jackets or shoes when they want to. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
The other moms sniff and toss their heads and let you know you have <br/>
undemined &quot;mom solidarity&quot; and made their lives more difficult.?<br/>

and it&#39;s wonderful to be the wanton Mom who undermines the authority of mean moms!  I make a point of being especially &#39;permissive&#39; when I see a pinched-face Mom saying things like &#39;slides are for DOWN&#39; to her kids.  <br/>

Guerilla mothering.<br/>
<br/>
Once a child&#39;s been treated like a human, it&#39;s harder for him to go back.<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes I do feel a little guilty about giving them a taste of positive <br/>
regard if it&#39;s going to make them pine for something better, but that&#39;s an <br/>
ancient philosophical quandry, isn&#39;t it?  Is no taste of freedom better for the <br/>
enslaved?  No glimpse of happiness better for the condemned?<br/>
