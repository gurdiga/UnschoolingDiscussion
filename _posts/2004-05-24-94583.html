<div id="ygrps-yiv-598181780">Jen and all,<br/>
I have to laugh at this whole thread!  Not laughing at you, just at the idea <br/>
because I love to peel wallpaper, and pick at other things too Sandra!<br/>
My parents bought a house about 10 years ago with pink flowered wallpaper in <br/>
several different rooms downstairs.  My mom hates the wallpaper but had never <br/>
done anything about it.  She also hates the look of ripped off wallpaper, so <br/>
last year I started peeling the wallpaper off in tiny sections in the corner of <br/>
rooms when I went to visit.  It started innocently enough, I swear, a corner <br/>
was coming off by itself and I just &quot;couldn&#39;t help myself&quot;, and peeled a <br/>
little off.<br/>
Anyways, now we&#39;ve started redoing all those rooms one at a time and it&#39;s so <br/>
nice to be rid of the ugly wallpaper!  One room left to go, and it only has a <br/>
border on top with pink walls.<br/>
But I AM helping her to redo those rooms and she&#39;s wanted to for a long time- <br/>
so please no one give me too hard a time about my wallpaper peeling.  Her <br/>
house is looking much nicer now!<br/>
My kids have never peeled at it while we were there, but they are always busy <br/>
playing with grandma!<br/>
As for keeping them from coloring on the walls and what-not, my kids (4 and <br/>
1) are welcome to use crayons and markers whenever they want, but they are not <br/>
kept where they can get to them, so I don&#39;t have to worry too much about the <br/>
youngest coloring the wall when I&#39;&#39;m not around.  We also have an easel and are <br/>
planning on getting a large dry erase board that is magnetic too so they can <br/>
color and play magnets as well.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052851862">I must confess, it&#39;s all I can when I visit my sisters house, not to rip off<br/>
the loose wallpaper, it drives me crazy.  Any little pucker or ripple gives<br/>
me this uncontrollable urge to grab and pull.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
We took a similar approach with our son.  We kept the crayons, markers,<br/>
scissors, glitter and glue up high in a closed plastic container.  He had a<br/>
high chair with a large tray, that was the ONLY place he was allowed to use<br/>
those items.  It turned into a table and chair, so as he got older he was<br/>
allowed to sit at the table with them.<br/>
<br/>
Only once did he ever use his crayons on the wall in his room.  He had<br/>
scribbled on a huge wall behind his bed.  So, if we make a mess, we clean it<br/>
up.  He and I spent the entire day in his room cleaning the wall.  He did<br/>
most of the work.  :)  He never made that mistake again either.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who has crayon marks everywhere in his house, walls, doors,<br/>
dressers, mirrors...literally everywhere.  He doesn&#39;t want to hinder his<br/>
children&#39;s creativity.  Now that to me is unacceptable and could never be<br/>
tolerated.  That child would learn the lesson of his life.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list btw and having a terrible time keeping up with all the<br/>
posts and various threads.  Interesting reading but the posts just keep<br/>
rolling in.  How does anyone keep up?<br/>

Mindful parenting means being careful even of what you think.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking a thought like &quot; That child would learn the lesson of his life.  &quot; <br/>
is something you might want to even guard against.<br/>
<br/>
But writing it down is a step further than thinking.<br/>
Posting it to a list of 1500+ people is a step further than writing it.<br/>
<br/>
If you wrote it without really thinking about what it meant, you might REALLY <br/>
want to think about the dangers of not really thinking.<br/>

I was twenty nine when I had Dylan and I&#39;d tried for babies a few times<br/>
before.  I had a lot of time to think about what kind of baby I would<br/>
get, &lt;g&gt; what kind of mom I would be, what kind of relationship I hoped<br/>
we could have.  I decided at some point along the way that a wall would<br/>
never be more important than my son&#39;s feelings and never more important<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the &quot;lesson&quot; of my son&#39;s life will be, but I know it<br/>
will never be that I thought more of a wall than I did of him.  I know it<br/>
won&#39;t be that I thought it was amusing if he was shamed or unhappy.  <br/>
<br/>
If I had a wallpaper puller I&#39;d probably help pull.  My theory is if the<br/>
paper is loose enough to be pulled up then it&#39;s already in bad shape and<br/>
needs to come off.   There was a recent thread about Indigo children<br/>
being more sensitive and whatever, I forget... but maybe  ~Wallpaper<br/>
Children~  are born with the knowledge wallpaper was a terrible idea in<br/>
the first place and needs to be eradicated.&lt;g&gt;    Hey, if there are Star<br/>

<br/>
you are so right.  my husband and i feel that way about our parenting as well as our interactions with people in general.  my kids are dd6, ds4, ds3, and ds1.<br/>
<br/>
almost two weeks ago, i put together a trip to a dairy farm for a homeschooling group i&#39;m semi-active in.  some activities were structured so that we could participate as a group and when our host was transitioning over to the next activity she was setting up, there were unstructured things for them to do -- pet farm animals, ride trikes around a small track, have some ice cream, etc.<br/>
<br/>
well, between two activities, most of the kids were riding the trikes around the track.  when our host said she was ready for the next activity, one of the moms in our group yelled out to the kids (they were about 100 feet away) to come back under the canopy for the butter-churning.  she waited about ten seconds, yelled out to them again, and maybe two or three kids (out of about 20) started coming in.  i thought these two responded moreso because they saw her stand and wave them in and because she had sent one kid out to get the rest.  in any case, about fifteen seconds after the second yell-out, she yelled, &quot;you all have ten seconds to get here and if you&#39;re not here by the count of ten, you owe me ten push-ups!&quot;  for the record, i felt that 1. her voice wasn&#39;t really loud enough to hear all the way over there and 2. the track was between a highway and us and at the moment of her push-up threat, a number of loud 18-wheelers were driving behind where the kids were.  so i felt that<br/>
 they probably didn&#39;t hear her.  i was within about six feet of her and she sounded slightly louder than loud talking.  but sure enough, only 2 or 3 more kids made it within the time, and even those kids just barely made it and had started to run as soon as she finished the threat. so the rest &quot;owed&quot; her push-ups.  my kids didn&#39;t make it, and although she didn&#39;t specifically mention any kids (including hers) by name, i told them to come have a seat with me as they walked up, and definitely was not about to have them participating in her push-up punishment.  other moms whose kids were &quot;late&quot; said to their kids, &quot;you heard her -- you owe her ten push-ups.  get to it.&quot;  in that situation, i felt that giving them the benefit of the doubt (ie having compassion) that they didn&#39;t hear her was fair.  i also don&#39;t use corporal punishment with my own kids, let alone anyone else&#39;s.  and bottom line, who cares?!  so it took a whole minute for everyone to come in!  so what?!  it didn&#39;t have to be<br/>
 a show of power, but became one.<br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s hard to give a complete run down of events in a short e-mail, they just<br/>
are not compatible.  :)  My son had huge rolls of paper that would pin up on<br/>
the wall or lay out on the floor or table for him to use.  He had and easel,<br/>
and several large dry erase boards, not to mention lots and lots of other<br/>
things to write and color on.  Our walls were textured, so it was not an<br/>
easy job getting the crayon off.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t yelled at and it wasn&#39;t treated as a punishment, I just matter of<br/>
factly, told him that since he decide to make the mess he would have to<br/>
clean it.  I of course did the lions share of the work.<br/>
<br/>
I wish that he had been doing geometry (my favorite) or something else that<br/>
made sense but it was just really long squiggly marks the entire length of a<br/>
14 foot wall.  My son had a huge room with a ball pit, tent, sponge mats,<br/>
tubes, computer and more.<br/>
<br/>
My son was being watched by a local homeschool mom for a short time.  One<br/>
day he complained that he wasn&#39;t allowed to chew his gum.  I thought it<br/>
strange and inquired.  The mom didn&#39;t like to see gum chewing and didn&#39;t<br/>
allow it.  Now I thought that was unusual...she had 7 kids.<br/>

Whether they were geometry or squiggles they were her work and art in her room and for me to come in, call it a mess and get rid of it would have been disrespectful to say the least. My daughter&#39;s room is her room. Her squiggles are her squiggles. You crossed boundaries both by insulting his work by calling it a mess and by excercising complete control  over his space (Most kids only get their rooms as their personal space, is it fair to control that in light of the fact that you have the whole house?)<br/>

But I don&#39;t use that colourful language online because it&#39;s a different medium and misunderstandings are common when the language isn&#39;t clear. If you&#39;re using expressions instead of saying what you really mean maybe you should rethink that. <br/>

<br/>
If it was done out of boredom, it was a way of communicating that regardless<br/>
of what he had around him, there was something missing. Often it&#39;s one on<br/>
one attention. But it takes being able to *listen* to what they&#39;re &quot;saying&quot;<br/>
(with words and actions) to figure out what they need. To set aside what we<br/>
want them to think and believe and feel. And listen to what they&#39;re actually<br/>
saying.<br/>

&gt; Dear Dawn,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard to give a complete run down of events in a short e-mail, they<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; are not compatible.  :)  My son had huge rolls of paper that would pin up<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the wall or lay out on the floor or table for him to use.  He had and<br/>
easel,<br/>
&gt; and several large dry erase boards, not to mention lots and lots of other<br/>
&gt; things to write and color on.  Our walls were textured, so it was not an<br/>
&gt; easy job getting the crayon off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He wasn&#39;t yelled at and it wasn&#39;t treated as a punishment, I just matter<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; factly, told him that since he decide to make the mess he would have to<br/>
&gt; clean it.  I of course did the lions share of the work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish that he had been doing geometry (my favorite) or something else<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; made sense but it was just really long squiggly marks the entire length of<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; 14 foot wall.  My son had a huge room with a ball pit, tent, sponge mats,<br/>
&gt; tubes, computer and more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son was being watched by a local homeschool mom for a short time.  One<br/>
&gt; day he complained that he wasn&#39;t allowed to chew his gum.  I thought it<br/>
&gt; strange and inquired.  The mom didn&#39;t like to see gum chewing and didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; allow it.  Now I thought that was unusual...she had 7 kids.<br/>

&gt;   I went in my daughters room last summer to find scribbles all over one<br/>
&gt; wall. I was steamed because we&#39;d talked about this. Thankfully she was<br/>
away<br/>
&gt; and so an hour later while I was washing dishes I finally cooled down. And<br/>
&gt; then I did a delayed double take on the scribbles. They were all geometric<br/>
&gt; shapes with lines drawn through in attempts to find lines of symmetry<br/>
and/or<br/>
&gt; divide them into fractions (she&#39;d pulled down a workbook and eaten up the<br/>
&gt; fractions section a few days before). She was writing into her space what<br/>
&gt; she&#39;d learned and on second viewing the doodles were beautiful to me. It&#39;<br/>
s<br/>
&gt; her room, her walls (well, she shares with her brother now) and her joy<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; knowledge that she wanted to express.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Well shucks, there is a middle ground is there not? Somewhere between<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; extreme and his? And yes, you are at one end of the extreme if not even a<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s own wall is allowed to be doodled on. Your extreme sees any doodle<br/>
&gt; as a mess, his sees every doodle as art.<br/>
&gt;   Your last sentence, that was a little scary.<br/>

It&#39;s a hard but vital thing for unschoolers to accept that just because <br/>
something doesn&#39;t make sense to the parent doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s senseless.  And just <br/>
because the child is doing our favorite thing doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s &quot;finally&quot; doing <br/>
something worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting aspect of attachment parenting is recognizing the profound <br/>
difference between the child and the parent at the same time.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty was listening to John Roberts and Tony Barrand, some of my favorite <br/>
traditional musicians, having found a homemade tape (I made for my husband years <br/>
ago from albums) somewhere around the house.   Traditional English Christmas <br/>
stuff.  I had a little thrill, and told him we had more of their stuff if he <br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
But if I had written this on this list: <br/>
&quot;I wish that he had been listening to English folk music (my favorite) or <br/>
something else that made sense but it was just modern stuff I didn&#39;t recognize <br/>
the entire audio-length of a14 foot room, &quot;<br/>
people would be pretty quick to pint out that just because I didn&#39;t recognize <br/>
it didn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t make sense.<br/>

Is this about an unschooler?<br/>
If not, why bring the story here?<br/>

<br/>
I was raised by Texans whose own grandparents had at various points moved <br/>
there from places like Alabama and Virginia.  They used a lot of expressions <br/>
designed to keep children small and powerless and afraid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481828452">You might try faux finishes on the walls in place of paper.  Sponging is really easy. And it can look like paper.  The easiest way would be to use one color in three different shades (light, medium, and darker).  I would stay away from ultra-deep colors.<br/>
 <br/>
At 3 yrs. my son helped me to sponge a bedroom and a bathroom.  We even put his handprint on the wall, but you had to know where to look to see it with the sponging.<br/>
 <br/>
Let me know if you&#39;d like &quot;how-to&quot; info.<br/>
