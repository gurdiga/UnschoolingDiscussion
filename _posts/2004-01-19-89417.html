&gt;It&#39;s the parents who lose their grip if they think the witchcraft is real.<br/>
<br/>
-smile-  Some witchcraft is real.  In the same way that Communion is real.<br/>
It is real ritual meant to serve a real purpose in those people&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
Now, can I turn my ex boyfriend into a toad?  Nah, but then I didn&#39;t need<br/>
to.  -grin-<br/>
<br/>
&gt;IF Christianity is the one and only truth, then there is no legitimate<br/>
&gt;witchcraft possible in any way and it&#39;s ALL just playing.<br/>
<br/>
Except that certain forms of witchcraft (communication with the dead and<br/>
soothsaying) are directly prohibited in the Bible.  Not to mention that some<br/>
Pagans are polytheistic which could mess with the &quot;put no other god before<br/>
me&quot; bit.<br/>
<br/>
The Bible doesn&#39;t say other stuff doesn&#39;t exist.  It says Christians aren&#39;t<br/>
supposed to do them.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; To be angry or afraid of something outside the one true religion shows a<br/>
&gt;lack of faith that it IS the one true religion.<br/>
<br/>
I get your point, but I think it&#39;s a little strongly stated.  There are<br/>
prayers I would be fine with and ones I wouldn&#39;t.  My MIL&#39;s prayer that all<br/>
her kids and their spouses find their way to Christ was, well, annoying.<br/>
And that&#39;s from my place as both a Jew and a witch.  -smile-  But a prayer<br/>
that we find the spiritual answers we need wouldn&#39;t be.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;If a Catholic gets angry because a Baptist prayed for her, or if a Mormon<br/>
&gt;gets grumpy because someone asked St. Anthony to help him find his bike, or<br/>
if a<br/>
&gt;Church-of-England member gets furious at the bikeless Mormon for standing<br/>
in<br/>
&gt;for a baptism of her great great grandmother...   well they should be<br/>
&gt;embarrassed.<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes, I&#39;d have to agree with this.  -smile-  I&#39;m of the mind that all<br/>
positive energy sent out is a help, no matter which diety it filters<br/>
through.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688408693">Well I can tell you what I did. I said &quot;Great! Tell me more about it.&quot;I<br/>
asked him what he had found out and that he could share with me. That I was<br/>
really interested. Then I sat back and listened to him. Really listened. He<br/>
told me what he knew at the time. I told him he could share with me<br/>
anything. (I had said that for years) He did a _great_ job explaining what<br/>
he knew. I think this was about 4-5 yrs ago when he was 13-14.<br/>
<br/>
    I was, and still am, very proud of myself too. You see I was raised in a<br/>
strict Baptist household. Church every sunday/ sunday night, dresses down to<br/>
my knees, no dancing, etc. Also the authoritarian parenting route. The whole<br/>
nine yards. I could have gotten really upset and blew my stack but I didn&#39;t.<br/>
I stayed calm and really listened. I hate to admit it but I/We have been<br/>
very controlling in the past and Michael got the brunt of that too. I&#39;m so<br/>
thankful that has changed. :-) I may have even been here lurking. I&#39;ve<br/>
subbed and unsubbed a couple times. These lists have helped me a bunch.<br/>
<br/>
    Back to my son. He told me a few things and I could see the similarities<br/>
to my beleifs. Which have changed a ton over the years too. It also changed<br/>
our relationship for the better. I really beleive that up to that point he<br/>
didn&#39;t beleive I _really_ respected him and what he thought. He has since<br/>
then always told me the truth even when he knew I may disagree or be shocked<br/>
by it. We&#39;ve had great conversation on just about everything now. Drugs,<br/>
sex, friends, girls, and of course more on religion and Wicca. He now know I<br/>
am truely interested and that is so wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
    Matter of fact he did more studying and used his knowledge of Wicca to<br/>
write his exam paper in English last quarter. He&#39;s quite a young man but<br/>
then I&#39;m biased. ;-)<br/>
