<div id="ygrps-yiv-66208718">I have a quick question for anyone out there who is doing transcription work <br/>
at home.  May I ask what you charge?  I suppose it varies in different parts <br/>
of the country, but I&#39;m trying to get a feel for hourly or by-the-page prices.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

The work I do for the Federal courts is $1.25 per page.  However, if you do <br/>
corporate work, you could easily charge $3 or $4 a page.</div>
