<div id="ygrps-yiv-580066356">Hi, I received a call from a friend looking for advise. I was not certain <br/>
what to tell her so I thought I would ask her question here, everyone here <br/>
always have lots of good ideas! <br/>
<br/>
I will try to keep this short. The problem is that my friend feels that her <br/>
son (age 15) runs around with a group of boys (ages 17-19) that she feels is <br/>
have become a determent to her son. Her son Dan began to run with them late <br/>
last school year. Dan is unschooled but has been in and out of public school <br/>
several times over the last 6 years at his request. His parents are very open <br/>
to what he wants to do. They have also allowed him much freedom to run around <br/>
town (pop 1500) at all hours which may be how he hooked up with the older <br/>
kids. His Mom thought the older boys were ok at first, kind of mouthy she <br/>
said but she thought they were just kids having fun. Now she is not so sure <br/>
since Dan has begun to smoke tobacco, has a bad attitude, swears profusely, <br/>
and may be drinking alcohol. Dan is an only child. His main problem has <br/>
always been not having many friends. But he is very likable, my kids always <br/>
liked being with him, but we live 68 miles from him so could not see him <br/>
often. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas would be appreciated. I have not had to deal with this type of <br/>
problem myself so I am not sure what advise to give. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880422303">I have two sons, now age 22 and 24.  I tried to always know what they <br/>
were doing and where they were.  They had to be home by 10pm every <br/>
night, as that was when I wanted to be done for the day and I needed <br/>
to know where they were before I could be done.  They complained, of <br/>
course, but now they tell me about all the stuff they got away with <br/>
anyway.  I don&#39;t think I was strict or controlling, but I drew a line <br/>
and that seemed to keep them out of trouble.  At 15, your friend&#39;s son <br/>
can now make bad decisions that will mess up (or at least make very <br/>
difficult) the rest of his life.  Your friend may feel horrible about <br/>
taking control, but everyone will be grateful in the future.  My <br/>
regret is that my older son got caught up with a Dungeons and Dragons <br/>
crowd.  I met most of them and knew there were some older people <br/>
involved.  My son had a level head and was a good kid. The crowd <br/>
included a 28 year old woman who latched on to my son when he was 17 <br/>
and half.  Unfortunately I was swayed by the male influences in my <br/>
life at the time who thought is was cool for him to have such a <br/>
relationship.  I wanted to call the police for child molesting, <br/>
something I certainly would have done if he&#39;d been a girl and she a <br/>
man.  He found out she wasn&#39;t so great of a person and when he tried <br/>
to break free, she manipulated him with suicide threats.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
know how to handle this and never asked for advice.  We didn&#39;t know <br/>
this was happeneing as he was no longer living at home.  Eight years <br/>
later he&#39;s married to a nice woman closer to his age, but he&#39;s still <br/>
involved with the ex daily, as they are sharing custody of the 2 year <br/>
old produced as a last attempt by her to keep him.<br/>
While it may seem heavy handed, your friends should follow their <br/>
hearts which may include putting retrictions on Dan.  Teenage years <br/>
are harder that the terrible twos, but parents mostly DO know best, we <br/>
are not their buddies, we are the most valiant protectors. I have <br/>
found that they only &quot;hate&quot; us until they realize that we were right.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291433930">&lt;&lt; My <br/>
regret is that my older son got caught up with a Dungeons and Dragons <br/>
crowd. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My fifteen year old plays D&D weekly, with teens, some older, but no adult <br/>
women.<br/>
I knew (well) an adult woman who preyed on teenaged boys in the SCA in the <br/>
late 1970&#39;s and early 1980&#39;s.  It wasn&#39;t the SCA&#39;s fault, it was hers and the <br/>
boys (who consented, and YES I wish she had left them alone, and she still <br/>
tries, sometimes, at her advanced age (my age &lt;g&gt;) to get guys to accomodate <br/>
her, but she aims at 30 yr olds now.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s gross, but I don&#39;t think D&D caused one or the SCA the other, <br/>
except for the potential opportunity for a grown woman to socialize with <br/>
teens.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have found that they only &quot;hate&quot; us until they realize that we were <br/>
right.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have some experience to the contrary.<br/>
Often parents aren&#39;t right.<br/>
<br/>
And the suicide mention (of the evil older ex) is interesting, because I&#39;ve <br/>
been trying to figure out how to respond to the original question, and I can <br/>
never get out of my head the images of the living, breathing Charles Montoya <br/>
and Alice Laws, who were in school, in band and (Alice was) in Sunday school <br/>
with me, but they killed themselves, one in 9th and one in 10th grade.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty was running around with some older, rude friends.<br/>
<br/>
I kept him talking, invited them over (they didn&#39;t want to come--a clue for <br/>
Marty), I questioned their motives, and their treatment of one another.  When <br/>
he wanted to go hang around with them (they&#39;d meet at Pokemon at Toys R&#39;Us <br/>
and then walk across the street to a park, or walk into the mall), I&#39;d just <br/>
warn him not to let them mistreat him or get him in trouble.  He decided <br/>
after a few months that they weren&#39;t honest enough or nice enough for his <br/>
tastes.<br/>
<br/>
In a case in which the teen won&#39;t discuss it with the mom, though, I don&#39;t <br/>
know what advice to give.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is out late a couple of times a week, but with people I trust, and I <br/>
always have the phone number where he&#39;ll be, and he comes back when he says <br/>
he will (even if it&#39;s 3:30 am., after the midnight-starting anime club m<br/>
eeting).  Partly I&#39;m lucky.  Partly we talk a lot.  Partly his friends tell <br/>
him he&#39;s lucky.   Partly I trust him because of his personality and <br/>
analytical ability.  So what works for one family&#39;s kids won&#39;t work for all.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend something I&#39;ve recommended in other instances, and that is <br/>
to get the kid out of town, out of the state if possible, with the mom at <br/>
least, and whole family is possible.  Many days in a row doing something <br/>
interesting, foreign, different, in different air, will bring out <br/>
communications and truths that are not going to come up in the daily <br/>
surroundings and routine.<br/>
<br/>
It it seems too expensive, tell her she might want to price counseling and a <br/>
couple of visits with a juvenile courts lawyer, and see whether it doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem a little better choice.<br/>

about many things: sex, diseases, politics, religous beliefs, sexual <br/>
orientation.  The older one pondered how to know if he&#39;s making a good <br/>
decision.  I suggested that, since we are so open with each other, if <br/>
it&#39;s something he wouldn&#39;t want me to know about, maybe he ought to <br/>
think twice about it...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a true weirdness about &quot;the gaming geeks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has lots of hobbies, but he hangs out with two groups which both have <br/>
young adults.  One is the anime club he&#39;s in (the prez is a fundamentalist <br/>
Christian so they have no nasty bits, ever), and the other is the gaming <br/>
group.  He does D&D, but more likes structured games like Seventh Sea and <br/>
Warlord (card games similar to Magic).  There are people who grow up and keep <br/>
on playing.  It&#39;s no more evil than those who live to ski or race stock cars <br/>
or ride horses--it&#39;s just different.  Lots of these young adults still live <br/>
at home, because they&#39;d rather spend their money on anime and games.  I <br/>
suppose although some of the adults are lacking social skills, they&#39;re also <br/>
not drinking alcohol, not using drugs (one smokes cigarettes, out of fifteen <br/>
or so, and the rest snort at him about it), and I NEVER worry that they&#39;re <br/>
out on the street shaking down younger gamers for their booster-pack money.<br/>
<br/>
Most of them have decent jobs and running automobiles, and they&#39;re all bright <br/>
and conversant, so things could be worse, no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had better suggestions for others.<br/>

<br/>
Teens are designed to break away from control so the more parents try to<br/>
control the harder the teens fight against it. So the teen years are times<br/>
to work on the relationship so that they feel the parent is someone they can<br/>
talk to about things rather than someone who is still trying to run their<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s idea sounds like a good way of jumping to the talking point without<br/>
letting go and then waiting (what would undoubtedly feel like ages!) for the<br/>
teen to realize the parent is there for him to talk with.<br/>

You know, what bugs me most about parents (and adults) in general is <br/>
the fact that they treat teen agers like children.  My girls are my <br/>
social and moral equal.  They are 14 and 16.  Yes, I am still their <br/>
mother, yes they listen to me about as much as I listen to my mother <br/>
who also lives on this property.  We all respect each other as people <br/>
and talk to each otehr a lot.  My three best female friends are my <br/>
mother and my daughters.  <br/>

In the midst of a conversation, I said this and someone picked it up <br/>
as a tagline for a while.  It sums up my thoughts on teens very well!<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;We treat our teens like children at best and criminals at worst, <br/>
then are surprised and shocked when they act like children or act <br/>
like criminals.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
