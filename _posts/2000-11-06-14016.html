<div id="ygrps-yiv-245876765">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
   I am back on this list after a busy summer with my son and an incredible <br/>
foster daughter, who was with us from July until two weeks ago.  (How I miss <br/>
her!)  Now we have a foster son, Jimmie, who is nine.  We will be able to <br/>
adopt him after the first of the year, and we&#39;re thrilled.  He&#39;s a great kid <br/>
with none of the emotional baggage you find in a foster placement.  I am <br/>
homeschooling him for now, and we are hoping later this month to get our <br/>
homeschooling officially approved by the court.  (We have discovered you <br/>
can&#39;t blow your nose in the foster system without a court order, but I <br/>
digress...)  Anyway, my one problem with Jimmie is that he is totally <br/>
addicted to video games.  We have a Nintendo that has been used in <br/>
moderation, but if I left it up to Jimmie, the Nintendo would be on 24 hours <br/>
a day.  When we go anywhere in the car, he&#39;s got his Game Boy with him, so <br/>
this is something we battle every waking hour.  How do I teach him some <br/>
moderation without insulting his choices?  I have to admit, I have wanted to <br/>
say, &quot;Turn that silly box OFF and do something that involves a BRAIN!!!&quot;  I <br/>
have restrained myself so far, but I could snap at any minute.  How would the <br/>
rest of you handle this?<br/>
<br/>
   My second question involves suggestions for a study we&#39;re starting.  We <br/>
want to learn about Christmas/Holiday customs around the world, including <br/>
music, crafts, traditions, cooking, etc.  Does anyone know of any books, <br/>
magazines, videos, CDs, whatever, that would help?  Thanks for your help.<br/>

Well, I can&#39;t help with the first question, sorry. But the second I have<br/>
some experience in. You could start with Advent, the four weeks before<br/>
Christmas. There&#39;s a lot of info about Advent on-line from a Catholic<br/>
source. If I can manage to dig up my paperwork on it I&#39;ll let you know. (We<br/>
do an &quot;Advent workshop&quot; every November at church...mainly holiday crafts.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Dorling Kindersley book (well, I&#39;m pretty sure it was DK) about<br/>
Christmas or Winter holidays around the world. I&#39;m sure a librarian could<br/>
direct you to it.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the history of Santa, Christmas trees, etc, etc. You can get<br/>
tons of historical information on-line.<br/>
<br/>
One book I didn&#39;t like was The Winter Solstice. Actually had bad info,<br/>
couldn&#39;t believe that. (about St Lucia in Sweden) I think it was over-hyped.<br/>
<br/>
I like listening to Christmas music from around the world. Your library<br/>
probably has tapes and CD&#39;s. Along with videos. And cookbooks. You could<br/>
pick just one culture to study (your ancestors maybe) or really go all out<br/>
and try a different one every week for 6 weeks or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
A trip to the library would be the best first step, IMO. There&#39;s an<br/>
overwhelming amount of resources. No point in buying it all.<br/>

There is an interesting article about video games at a site I found <br/>
recently.  You might get some ideas or some new insights into video <br/>
games in general.  The link is below.  The site itself, Taking <br/>
Children Seriously, is a little extreme for my educational <br/>
philosophies but I find some of their stuff very enlightening and <br/>
interesting.<br/>

Maybe a way to get your child off the game but with out him feeling like he <br/>
has to loose  focus on something he loves is to take him to a good bookstore <br/>
or computer store that has magazines on video games, so he can read those. <br/>
Also i know that there are chapter books out, both in the young adult, and <br/>
dult sections, that are based on video games. Don&#39;t make your child read <br/>
them. Just buy thema nd stick them on the table or in the car where he sits, <br/>
he might pick one up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think before you say video games don&#39;t involve a brain, you should play <br/>
them.  I suspect you would find them very difficult to grasp or to operate, <br/>
let alone to master. They take a great deal of thought, strategy, memory, and <br/>
the same skills that programmers use--deduction, patterning...  <br/>
<br/>
I have three kids who play games.  At the moment they&#39;re playing a Simpson&#39;s <br/>
version of Clue--four kids and an adult friend.  &quot;Marge in the Bowl-a-rama <br/>
with the Extendo-Glove,&quot; I just heard.  They *could* be playing one of the <br/>
four video systems in the house (not counting Game Boys) but they have chosen <br/>
to play a board game.  Earlier they were playing Disk Wars--a game using <br/>
cardboard disks.  They&#39;re socializing, reading, strategizing, and exercising <br/>
their minds hugely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719461415">An example of a great video game that teaches the things Sandra lists below:<br/>
Someone on this list recently recommended the video game Logical Journey of<br/>
the Zoombinis -- and I want to say THANK YOU!  What a wonderful game, and<br/>
what a workout for the brain.  Even I sit down just about every evening and<br/>
play a couple of rounds of it.  It&#39;s a high quality game, great graphics,<br/>
amusing, challenging, but not too hard -- you really can&#39;t &quot;lose,&quot; because<br/>
the worse that can happen is that you have to go back to the beginning and<br/>
start again, and it becomes progressively more difficult in managable<br/>
increments.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to see the skills that the kids are picking up from this game<br/>
transfer to other areas, plus I&#39;ve been able to give them a brief<br/>
introduction to logic and probability by referring to elements of the game.<br/>
But more importantly, the kids are experiencing the way logic and<br/>
probability work in a way that would be difficult to replicate in &quot;real<br/>
life.&quot;  I know they would never sit down with me for more than 2 minutes and<br/>
roll dice or work through syllogisms, but they love this game!<br/>

I have to take the kids really soon to play Disk Wars for the whole afternoon <br/>
at Active Imagination, the gaming shop up the road. <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expage.com/sandradoddbio">http://expage.com/sandradoddbio</a>  has a Kirby paragraph with a disk wars site <br/>
link.  <br/>

I can get Kirby to tell more later if you don&#39;t find sufficient info there.<br/>
