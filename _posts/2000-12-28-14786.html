<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725322005"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;My question would be: do you know the name of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; plant outside you fron door?  Could you describe it<br/>
&gt; &gt; now without going and looking at it? Does is shelter<br/>
&gt; &gt; any animals? Does it have flowers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t know its exact name. It is some kind of bush that is often <br/>
planted in subdivisions. However, it does have small, red berries in the <br/>
fall which the birds like to eat (they picked it clean). It has small <br/>
leaves and provides a nice shelter for the finches while they visit the <br/>
birdfeeder in the front yard. There are also two lovely evergreens in the <br/>
front yard that have become condos for the chickadees and house finches!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What are you doing for the World?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love this topic because I have so far to go and would love to learn more <br/>
from others. I will check out some of the sites mentioned on this list. I <br/>
guess our homeschooling would be first on the list. We do recycle, but I <br/>
would like to compost and haven&#39;t yet. Last year I focused on modifying our <br/>
food intake. I went through all the food cabinets and cleaned out <br/>
everything that didn&#39;t fit a more natural diet. There were a lot of canned <br/>
goods and mixes that we never used, so, as long as they were still fresh, <br/>
we gave them to a food pantry. We started buying organic whenever possible <br/>
and began shopping at a Whole Foods store almost exclusively. I have been <br/>
trying to improve my son&#39;s eating habits, but he still won&#39;t eat fruits or <br/>
many vegetables. :-(     I am still trying. I gradually switched to organic <br/>
versions of staple items. We also visited a naturopath for our seasonal <br/>
allergies instead of using OTC medications and steroids (as the allergist <br/>
recommended). Now I am trying to work on finding non-chemical alternatives <br/>
for personal care and household products. For my birthday, I replaced my <br/>
small number of old cosmetics with healthier versions. Soaps and shampoos <br/>
were easy to change, but some of the household products still need <br/>
replacement; I need a good dishwasher detergent that cleans well and hasn&#39;t <br/>
any phosphates. (I am not yet ready to give up the dishwasher altogether.) <br/>
We are doing much better at reducing paper usage and waste. This all seems <br/>
so little and more aimed at our family. Other than giving to charities and <br/>
giving away old clothing, we don&#39;t do any other community service. This <br/>
needs to be addressed. I still can&#39;t give up driving the car because <br/>
everything we do these days is 30 minutes from home (especially all the <br/>
homeschooling activities). We have reduced our consumer activities, or at <br/>
least are working on being more mindful of what we buy and where. Christmas <br/>
gifts for my husband&#39;s family included a donation to the non-profit place <br/>
where my SIL works, movie tickets, restaurant gift certificates, and a <br/>
piece of pottery made by a local artist.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part of changing family habits is convincing DS that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
need that Burger King toy or that it can be fun to do something that <br/>
doesn&#39;t involve electronics! Kids are hit hard by commercialism. Here&#39;s the <br/>
dichotomy of our life: our car has two bumper stickers on the back; one <br/>
says &quot;Be Green&quot; (we got it from the organic food store), and the other says <br/>
NASCAR racing (my son loves car racing). How do you reconcile wanting to <br/>
live in a more earth-friendly way when other family members like things <br/>
that are resource-intensive (cars, electronic gadgets) and not <br/>
nature-friendly? I wish we had started making these changes before my son <br/>
was born. I guess I wasn&#39;t that far-sighted.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays!<br/>
