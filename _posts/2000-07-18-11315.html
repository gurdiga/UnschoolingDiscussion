  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">..now on to other stuff.........We have 3 dogs, 2 
  cats 2 birds, and 2 fish(one really big one)...Zain waters , and feeds the 
  dogs about 3 x a week..the doggy that lives outside, everyday.&nbsp; He feeds 
  the fish in his room as well.&nbsp; I for one would like to have more animals, 
  but not just as pets, but farm animals, for food , eventually, and goat for 
  milk..chickens for eggs....we&#39;re not quite ready for a set up of this 
  sort..but I traded work at a croft for herb classes , and the teachers kids 
  were homeschooled......they participated in the business, helped with the 
  animals, and various other things...what I thought was interesting is one day 
  the son had a friend from the neighborhood over, this 10 year old was so 
  enthused by the responsibility that he had he came in to ask...can I milk the 
  goat early today, so I can show my friend, he&#39;s never seen that before...he 
  included him in doing all the chores that day, and with a great attitude..he 
  was so proud he was able to share, and do things that alot of people don&#39;t 
  usually experience, regardless of the fact that it was a chore....he loved it, 
  and wanted to show off his responsibilites..I thought that was pretty 
  cool.&nbsp; Every year they have baby goats, and all spring they walk the 
  goats for an hour in the woods behind their house...I went out with Emily one 
  day, as she was showing me how it&#39;s done, because I was to care for them while 
  their family went to Mexico for a ffew weeks.....the joy of a little girl , 
  and three little goats..truly not everyone has these kinds of 
  experiences(others I&#39;m sure)....but she picked flowers, sang songs, talked and 
  played with them, and showed me what they were eating, and not eating and 
  why...the children were actually very good teachers, and so deliteful.....I 
  thought it a very healthy, and imaginitive world for children to grow up 
  in...I &#39;m sure their are day when the rabbit cages just don&#39;t seem so 
  appealing, but everything there seemed to be changing at a pace in harmony 
  with the season, so just as one thing became alittle old....new things came up 
  to do.....and everyone rotated the responsibilites, and chores, so no -one was 
  alwya doing the same thing....it was cool....everyone was responsible for 
  picking, and cleaning up after themselves...dishes etc.&nbsp; SO no-one was 
  left to clean up after some-one else, really(people that is)&nbsp; .&nbsp; It 
  was the neatest thing to see.&nbsp; Now if only I could get the &quot;JOy of work&quot; 
  into my house, I&#39;ve almost reached it in the garden.........It was a learning 
  experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still pondering alot of what I learned 
  there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle*</font></div><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a
