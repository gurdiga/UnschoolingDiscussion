<div id="ygrps-yiv-50532349"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt; Sometimes I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not Christian &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tracy,<br/>
&gt;sounds like you are saying the converse of this then...<br/>
&gt;other times you are not glad to be a non-Christian?  <br/>
&gt;God loves you!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I cannot answer for Tracy, however I am most decidedly and wholeheartedly<br/>
glad that I am not Christian, and am most decidedly and wholeheartedly<br/>
happy and satisfied to be who I am.  I KNOW that both the Goddess and the<br/>
God love me, in all their incarnations, and that I am a child of their<br/>
creation.<br/>
<br/>
You however, sound like you are saying that NOT being Christian is<br/>
wrongheaded and misguided.  I can only assume that such an assumtion comes<br/>
of living in a country that can be often very slanted toward Christianity.<br/>
I feel the need to remind you of the Millions and Millions of thinking,<br/>
feeling, contributing, spiritual, soulfull human beings on this planet who<br/>
are most decidedly NOT Christian, and PROUD of it!!<br/>
Goddess Loves You!!<br/>
