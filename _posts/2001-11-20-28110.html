<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298723434">&lt;&lt;I&#39;d get really frustrated if I brought something in I wanted to have some<br/>
of in a few days&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was a baby, dh and I had an exchange student live with us.<br/>
Dh doesn&#39;t like diet coke and I had never &quot;shared&quot; before with someone who<br/>
just ate and drank until nothing was left in the house.  It drove me crazy!<br/>
Dh still refers to that time in our lives as &quot;the cola wars.&quot;  Looking back,<br/>
I wish I had handled things differently.  Oh well, we grow and change  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503040327">&lt;&lt;Can I stay if I take some and leave some?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aimee, that is the only way you can stay.  Otherwise, you are just being<br/>
reactionary  :)<br/>
<br/>
Here is my thought on all this:<br/>
<br/>
I was raised by the very typical Cleaver-type parents, loving, nurturing,<br/>
but definitely in control of many areas.  When I had kids, I just naturally<br/>
kind of fell into that.  It seemed very normal to set time limits on<br/>
television, not let kids climb high, require veggies before dessert, etc..<br/>
The kids would ask for something or to do something and I would find myself<br/>
saying &quot;no&quot; more out of habit than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
After I found unschooling, I found that I began to question so many &quot;givens&quot;<br/>
in my life, that things didn&#39;t have to be a certain pre-set way.  So I<br/>
started to look at various things at our house and how we did things.  Why<br/>
did I have a time limit on television?  Would my kids just sit in front of<br/>
the television all day, even when I had other interesting things available<br/>
for them?<br/>
<br/>
Did I have to deny my kids soda?  Or by talking with them about healthy<br/>
choices, about how there is 7 of us and we need to share, would they not hog<br/>
down a 3 liter bottle?<br/>
<br/>
Was it necessary that the 3 yo clean up their mess alone whenever I decided<br/>
it was time?  Or could I decide to clean it up and ask if she wanted to help<br/>
me?  Could I provide room for her to learn competence by allowing her to<br/>
work alongside me doing &quot;chores&quot; rather than simply let her &quot;help&quot; a little<br/>
so I could make sure the dishes were put away &quot;properly&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling/unparenting is necessarily about &quot;you have to do<br/>
it this prescribed way&quot;, but about questioning your motives, checking out<br/>
alternatives, giving kids as much freedom as is absolutely possible.<br/>
Example:  My 8 and 4 yo today had taken the mattress off the bottom bunk and<br/>
placed it at an angle so it made a slide.  They were wearing sweatsuits and<br/>
jumping off the top bunk, landing on the mattress with their knees and<br/>
sliding down.  These 2 do this kind of stuff and it isn&#39;t a big deal to me,<br/>
but most moms I know would have a cow about how they could get hurt (I do<br/>
remind the kids to be careful because bonked heads hurt).-----but my 3yo<br/>
isn&#39;t allowed to play out front by himself.  He has no fear at all and<br/>
simply follows various wildlife off into the undeveloped land around us.  We<br/>
talk a lot about needing to stay here but his priorities are different.  I<br/>
do go outside with him daily out front, take walks into the surrounding<br/>
land, let him play independently in the fenced backyard. but I also know<br/>
that I am in charge of where he plays.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thats my take.  I want to always question myself, to try to figure<br/>
out a way that the kids can do things they want safely, even if it is a<br/>
little scary for me, rather than simply deny them, to be open to their input<br/>
so we can have agreements about how things get done rather than me deciding<br/>
alone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>By teach,  I simply meant to do similar things...like say &quot;breathe in<br/>
deeply&quot; or &quot;suck in as much air as you can&quot;....then breathe deeply myself.<br/>
She would,  and still often, defiantly breathe short, hyper breaths.  Of<br/>
course,  I needed to keep my mind on my breathing more to not get<br/>
frustrated.  I&#39;m learning with her to keep my mouth shut,  breathe deeply<br/>
myself,  and just be close to her to get through the pain.  She&#39;s improving<br/>
in her own ability to calm herself.  But it&#39;s taken time and experience for<br/>
both us in trying to work through things together.......we have completely<br/>
different personalities in this regard.  What I think is gentle guiding,<br/>
she may take as an insult.<br/>
<br/>
As for childbirth breathing techniques....I found them silly and found that<br/>
they interfered with my ability to follow/listen to my own body&#39;s natural<br/>
rhythyms.  Of course,  the childbirth that I attempted using *textbook*<br/>
breathing techniques was to deliver my first child.  It ended up being a<br/>
complicated delivery and I felt stupid because I couldn&#39;t &quot;do it right&quot;.<br/>
Thankfully,  I wised up.  Being self aware and following my body&#39;s signals<br/>
is best hands down.......It&#39;s amazing how formal education can separate one<br/>
from one&#39;s own self.<br/>

&gt; Okay, this is going to sound really weird but . . .<br/>
&gt;  . . . instead of telling them to breath in a crisis, encourage them<br/>
&gt; to exhale slowly.  I discovered that I could &#39;cure&#39; an asthma attack<br/>
&gt; by singing a while back and it does work in a pinch to at least get<br/>
&gt; me through until I can get an inhaler.  I&#39;ve used it with the kids<br/>
&gt; too. Jenni and Wyndham have both gone through me making them blow<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158867468">Well said.  Thanks Julie.  Sounds like what&#39;s happening to us around here.<br/>
From the very beginning I found myself saying &quot;no(or some variation) and<br/>
Emma saying, &quot;but why&quot; (or some variation) so I spent a lot of time saying,<br/>
&quot;You know?  I have no idea why not...go ahead, just please be careful.&quot;  DH<br/>
will sometimes say, &quot;Uh, do we let her do that?&quot; and I say, &quot;well she showed<br/>
me it&#39;s OK....so yeah.&quot;  We&#39;ve really have come away from the controlling<br/>
everything in many areas...and you articulate well how it&#39;s an examine each<br/>
situation as we go kind of thing....some things we&#39;ll let go of and others<br/>
may not make sense for us (like your 3 yr old in the front by himself).<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-53156651">I wish I had that option.  At this point, I struggle to keep it under <br/>
control with a minimum of meds.  I think I have the balance right <br/>
now.  I haven&#39;t been to the ER since 1998 but before that it was once <br/>
a year.  Unfortunately my new doctor is a &quot;this is what the <br/>
recommended dose is so this is what you must use&quot; doctor.  We are <br/>
gonna clash big time if she doesn&#39;t lighten up/  I may have to <br/>
investigate changing docs again and I really don&#39;t want to.<br/>
As for pain meds, I used tylenol 3&#39;s for my cyst burt only because I <br/>
could not sleep otherwise.  I roll in my sleep and ever movement was <br/>
causing stabbing pains that woke me up.<br/>
