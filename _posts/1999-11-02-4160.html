<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684138196">An excellent article.<br/>
<br/>
From the text:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;ve just had a phone call from a friend who tells me that, in preparation<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for an upcoming trip to Benin, she&#39;s downloaded 75 to 100 pages of<br/>
information, from a score of sites, on that West African country --<br/>
information on everything from the local currency, political situation and<br/>
weather to the latest local news and the street address of the American<br/>
Embassy. &quot;I&#39;m starting to feel almost like I know the place, even though<br/>
I&#39;ve never been there,&quot; she said. Marco Polo, eat your heart out.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Before we moved to Portland, I did a similar information retrieval.  It was<br/>
amazing how much I could learn about the place without actually being there.<br/>
