<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011675310">I thank you all for the info. Since repetition and consistency in <br/>
these past 3 days, James has gotten much better in his studies and <br/>
seems to be enjoying it. We&#39;re going to approach him with going to <br/>
an African drum session and participating in building a drum. We&#39;ll <br/>
see how he responds to that. Truthfully, when I try to have a real <br/>
conversation with him as of late, he seems to be more responsive. <br/>
Maybe its because we&#39;re spending more time together, too!<br/>
<br/>
Many of the posts are so rightist,not within our political beliefs, <br/>
how our backgrounds and history are not the same that its very <br/>
obvious. We found info. we could use in some of the posts. Still,in <br/>
others I read to my friends and they couldn&#39;t understand where the <br/>
hell those fly balls came from - too much insight in to a situation <br/>
where a child has been failed and has given up and needs an <br/>
environment that is more balanced; or at least conducive to <br/>
learning. That&#39;s why they moved here with us. That&#39;s why we&#39;re <br/>
posting on boards and seeking advice. We&#39;ve already passed this age, <br/>
its his turn and its more about him. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted this same situation on an African unschooling site and I <br/>
didn&#39;t get such feedback, but suggestions on how to approach it all <br/>
because they could relate, the language of different context and <br/>
circumstances for different races is an issue in this case. <br/>
<br/>
Gwen, I know you didn&#39;t mean anything by your comments. I know how <br/>
it is to have to continue to post to clarify what you meant. Its <br/>
possible that 2 people can have a conversation and walk away and not <br/>
know/understand what the other was talking about in the end - I <br/>
believe some of the posts were just that. I really appreciate what <br/>
you were trying to get to.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

the 6 year old that says she can get rid of her hiccups by counting <br/>
to 10 (I hope no one reads anything more in to this statement than <br/>
the 6 year old that says she can get rid of her hiccups by counting <br/>
to 10)...1, 2, 3, 4,...</div>
