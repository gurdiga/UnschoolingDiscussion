<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995702978">At the age of 2 & 3, my son was terrified of the idea of a strange man<br/>
coming into our house through the fireplace.  At 3 I told him that Santa<br/>
wasn&#39;t a real person, just a story.  This made him feel better but he<br/>
still steered clear of the fireplace.  At 4 he forgot all about that and<br/>
happily believed in Santa.  At 5 he realized the whole story was pretty<br/>
far fetched and told me he didn&#39;t think Santa was real and he knew the<br/>
flying reindeer part wasn&#39;t.  Sometimes I think we adults take things way<br/>
too seriously and think things through too much.  Childhood is a magical<br/>
time and Christmas and the Solstice are a magical time.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
children will resent the Santa thing unless the adult keeps pushing it<br/>
long after the child likes to hear about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983603052">I usually lurk but I&#39;ll pop in for a moment on this one...<br/>
We do celebrate Christmas but we treat Santa like we do Big Bird and Mickey<br/>
Mouse. He&#39;s a fun make believe character. Sometimes the kids used to like to<br/>
pretend he was real but then, they like to pretend Mickey Mouse is real too!<br/>
We also talk about the origins of the modern day Santa and how other<br/>
countries have their version of Santa. Our reasons for this are many. In<br/>
part, I found out that Santa wasn&#39;t real in 4th grade the hard way (I was a<br/>
bit of a naive child). It was very upsetting and embarrassing. I also don&#39;t<br/>
like to give credit to Santa for the presents I take the time to pick out.<br/>
We live in a small townhouse and with four kids, I don&#39;t have enough good<br/>
hiding places. And I don&#39;t like like to add to the commercialism and the<br/>
gimmee-gimme of the holiday that already exists. We&#39;ve never said Santa was<br/>
bad or evil and we still hide some of the presents to put out Christmas Eve<br/>
because it&#39;s fun to get up and see what surprises await. We try to make sure<br/>
the kids don&#39;t spoil the secret for other kids. Though some have implied<br/>
that we&#39;ve denied our kids a rite of childhood, they don&#39;t seem to have<br/>
suffered for it. Now that they are getting to be teens they don&#39;t wish we<br/>
had pretended Santa was real.(yes, I did ask). It was never a big deal for<br/>
us. And I don&#39;t think Christmas was any less fun by not having Santa bring<br/>
presents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486471665">Our family has never done the Santa Scene.  Our oldest is 13 years old.  We do have<br/>
a book that tells about the life of the real Saint Nicholas.  We tell them the real<br/>
Saint Nicholas was a very kind man and gave gifts to the children.  We also tell<br/>
them that we give gifts just as the Wise Men gave gifts to the baby Jesus.  Most<br/>
important, you have to remind your kids not to tell other children that Santa Claus<br/>
isn&#39;t real because some families do talk about him coming down the chimney.   And<br/>
that&#39;s we we&#39;ve always done.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-396206975">as a christian family, we celebrate Christmas very joyfully. We have been honest that Santa is a fun story but not real. All our children know Christmas is the celebration of Jesus&#39; birth. On christmas eve, we light the house with candle light and a roaring fire. Sometimes we watch classic movies like It&#39;s a Wonderful Life and make gingerbread cookies and hot chocolate. We have had a birthday cake for Jesus and presented him with presents. (our talents, prayers or dreams). Some years we have had an Advent wreath. When we had family nearby we would visit at the grandparent&#39;s home. Even our Christmas tree has a story. Our tree topper is a star to represent the star in the sky leading the wise men to Jesus. a porcelan angel sits below the star, announcing to the shepards. Our nativity set has the magi and they start off by the front door and travel daily until they arrive at the manger on the mantlepiece. We have prepared a christmas turkey for a homeless shelter. Another way we have celebrated is each child is given a set amount of money to shop for Operation Christmas Child shoe boxes. These boxes are given to children in places that often are lucky to have a roof and food, nevermind toys.It helps the children to get their focus off of what&#39;s in it for me to how can I help someone else. I guess if you are not a christian, most of these ideas may not help much. Either way we feel Christmas should be a wonderful time of family and sharing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558988542">This is a difficult one for me... I found out about Santa when I was 5 (stayed<br/>

sortof missed it later on. And it was hard not telling my friends who still<br/>
believed. I still have the last present that Santa brought for me too (a REAL<br/>
bean-bag leopard toy). For my girls, I wanted them to believe for as long as<br/>
they want (ages 6 & 3) and they still do. Right before having the girls, I<br/>
commented to my mother that we are strange people... we tell out kids not to<br/>
talk to strangers, but every Christmas season, we go out and put our children on<br/>
their laps and tell them to smile! So, needless to say, I did not do this with<br/>
my first born for the first 2 yrs. Then, in a mall that we go to, there is one<br/>
older gentleman that sortof breaks the mold. He does not wear the typical Santa<br/>
gear. He will wear dark green or red corduroy pants and a long sleeve Christmas<br/>
shirt with suspenders holding up the pants. He is as jolly as old St. Nick and<br/>
comes with a real beard and mustache. He truly looks as if he could hold the<br/>

remarkable with the kids as well. So, who&#39;s to say he&#39;s not Santa... not me!  As<br/>

least one special gift that has his name on it.  Well, thats my 2 cents worth.</div>

Our ds is 5 and has ALWAYS asked about everything - including Santa.<br/>

Santa is real, just like love is real. And around Christmas, people put<br/>
on Santa suits, and help the spirit of giving by becoming Santa. So,<br/>
instead of just one Santa, there are lots of Santas, and when you&#39;re<br/>
older, you can be a Santa too.  But it&#39;s kind of a secret, because it&#39;s<br/>
a fun game to pretend there is only ONE Santa and he...(Fill in the<br/>

Santa is real, just like love is real. And around Christmas, people put<br/>
on Santa suits, and help the spirit of giving by becoming Santa. So,<br/>
instead of just one Santa, there are lots of Santas, and when you&#39;re<br/>
older, you can be a Santa too.  But it&#39;s kind of a secret, because it&#39;s<br/>
a fun game to pretend there is only ONE Santa and he...(Fill in the<br/>
Santa story of your choice)<br/>

&gt; (stayed<br/>
&gt; up longer than my mom could hold out). I got over the shock pretty<br/>
&gt; quickly but<br/>
&gt; sortof missed it later on. And it was hard not telling my friends who<br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; believed. I still have the last present that Santa brought for me too<br/>
&gt; (a REAL<br/>
&gt; bean-bag leopard toy). For my girls, I wanted them to believe for as<br/>
&gt; long as<br/>
&gt; they want (ages 6 & 3) and they still do. Right before having the<br/>
&gt; girls, I<br/>
&gt; commented to my mother that we are strange people... we tell out kids<br/>
&gt; not to<br/>
&gt; talk to strangers, but every Christmas season, we go out and put our<br/>
&gt; children on<br/>
&gt; their laps and tell them to smile! So, needless to say, I did not do<br/>
&gt; this with<br/>
&gt; my first born for the first 2 yrs. Then, in a mall that we go to,<br/>
&gt; there is one<br/>
&gt; older gentleman that sortof breaks the mold. He does not wear the<br/>
&gt; typical Santa<br/>
&gt; gear. He will wear dark green or red corduroy pants and a long sleeve<br/>
&gt; Christmas<br/>
&gt; shirt with suspenders holding up the pants. He is as jolly as old St.<br/>
&gt; Nick and<br/>
&gt; comes with a real beard and mustache. He truly looks as if he could<br/>
&gt; hold the<br/>
&gt; name Santa. He is at the same mall every year now for the past 4 yrs.<br/>
&gt; He is<br/>
&gt; remarkable with the kids as well. So, who&#39;s to say he&#39;s not Santa...<br/>
&gt; not me!  As<br/>
&gt; long as they believe or want to believe, I will go along with it and<br/>
&gt; provide at<br/>
&gt; least one special gift that has his name on it.  Well, thats my 2<br/>
&gt; cents worth.<br/>
