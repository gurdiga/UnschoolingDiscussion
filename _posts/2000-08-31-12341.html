<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031036621">Hi all, I know I haven&#39;t posted in a while, I have tried to read the digest <br/>
and keep up, but the edits on the book have taken up all of my spare time. <br/>
Actually that is why I have come out of my cocoon. I need some quotes <br/>
regarding how your children learn different subjects. This is just being used <br/>
in a round up of ideas type of chapter. Please mail me off list if you would <br/>
like to share a few pearls of collective wisdom:)  <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
