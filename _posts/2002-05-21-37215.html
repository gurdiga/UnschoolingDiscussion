are resorting to making exaggerated claims.<br/>
<br/>
Saying your family doesn&#39;t get its emotional needs met from &quot;electronic <br/>
equipment&quot; is very insulting to those people who have been posting about <br/>
getting information, pleasure, joy, excitement, and all-around fun from their <br/>
computer and tv use. <br/>
<br/>
I doubt you&#39;d get even a &quot;ho-hum&quot; response from anybody if you just said, <br/>
&quot;Okay - so what else besides computers and tv can you recommend?&quot; And you&#39;d <br/>
probably get a LOT more interesting ideas from people if you didn&#39;t insult <br/>
them first.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my best friends don&#39;t watch tv. &lt;g&gt; Who cares whether they do or not? <br/>
I don&#39;t. Except sometimes they don&#39;t get the jokes people make. <br/>

Some of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>
harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>
uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>

I&#39;ve never seen many people on this list nor any other unschooling <br/>
discussions who are willing to go against what they have personally <br/>
experienced and what they believe to help someone stave off that day when <br/>
they will look closely at their children without looking at them through the <br/>
filter of what some expert said.  I don&#39;t see it as negative when more <br/>
experienced moms offer freely of their positive unschooling experiences to <br/>
those who are just coming to that VERY different philosophy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sarcasm is often felt as an attack, especially in email communications. So is <br/>
phrasing such as, &quot;Look, whoever you are,...&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It helps to ask ourselves if we&#39;d talk like that to someone in person. If <br/>
someone made a suggestion you didn&#39;t like, one that didn&#39;t fit with your <br/>
family, would you make comments back to them like, &quot;Look, whoever you are... <br/>
or  &quot;My family doesn&#39;t get its emotional needs met from electronic <br/>
equipment?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I doubt&gt;  as many took offense as you seem to think. As I said, read in&gt; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; context, it&#39;s clear why I said what I said, in response to an earlier<br/>

&gt; instead, AFTER I had already said tv wasn&#39;t an option and was asking<br/>
&gt; for other comments.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She said you could worry less about the time you are spending with the new <br/>
baby because he could be happy and amused and intrigued and learn a lot and <br/>
be excited and emotionally touched -- not that he&#39;d get his emotional <br/>
connection from tv. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you let him have at the computer and TV all he wants to, you can spend <br/>
more happy hours with the baby, he can spend more happy hours getting input <br/>
(even very useful science, ecology, physics, math, etc. etc.), and you can, <br/>
if you want to, worry less about how he will be amused (and intrigued, and <br/>
mesmerized, and excited, and emotionally touched).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When people make suggestions we don&#39;t like, it is easy to just say thank you <br/>
and ignore what won&#39;t work for us. There is no need to be insulting by saying <br/>
that YOUR family doesn&#39;t get its emotional needs met by electronic equipment. <br/>
<br/>

I said that your response TO one of those suggestions was insulting. <br/>
<br/>
Lots of people have totally bought into the currently popular belief that <br/>
watching tv is bad bad bad. Some of us have discovered that it isn&#39;t good or <br/>
bad any more than books and magazines are good or bad - and that when we <br/>
relax about it and enjoy what we really enjoy and live consciously together <br/>
with our families, that tv is an enjoyable and educational and entertaining <br/>
part of our lives together. If other people don&#39;t want to try it, that is <br/>
their choice, of course, but the suggestion was still a good one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865132108"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is this list always<br/>
&gt; this negative or do you ever see posts actually being answered in ways<br/>
&gt; that are helpful to the poster?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hopefully before any more frustration gets vented to the list, maybe some<br/>
thoughts from the moderator will help.<br/>
<br/>
Most unschoolers have found that to really understand unschooling they&#39;ve<br/>
had to turn many cherished ideas upside down and sometimes heart wrenchingly<br/>
had to let go of them.<br/>
<br/>
Since we often closely identify with the choices we&#39;ve made, having someone<br/>
suggest we question our decisions and why we&#39;re doing something can feel<br/>
like an attack. It&#39;s not intended as such. It&#39;s intended as help. Many<br/>
people *have* found it helpful to dig deeply into what may have felt like<br/>
decisions based on solid thought to uncover the ones based on comfort for<br/>
their fears.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t feel comfortable questioning ourselves, we can at least<br/>
appreciate the time someone took to think about our problem and help in a<br/>
way they thought might be useful and perhaps find comfort in the fact that<br/>
our question may have prompted the exact answer someone else reading along<br/>
needed to hear.<br/>
<br/>
If we insist that answers be limited to the type we want to hear, then we<br/>
not only eliminate the ones we don&#39;t want to hear, but eliminate the<br/>
creative ideas we never would have thought of.<br/>
<br/>
It is perhaps a fact of life that people will happily give of their time<br/>
when they feel their time is being appreciated. People *do* recognize the<br/>
help they have to offer won&#39;t necessarily be helpful but they *are* doing<br/>
the best they can.<br/>
<br/>
It is also helpful when we don&#39;t get the responses we expected, to back up<br/>
and look at how we worded our questions. Those very few things we&#39;ve chosen<br/>
out of our lives to represent the sum total of what we are are all people<br/>
have to go on. If, for instance, we&#39;ve expressed a question in terms of our<br/>
concerns rather than something that&#39;s bothering our children, the answers we<br/>
get will reflect that. So we can just try and express the concern more<br/>
clearly. Or think about why we originally chose to word it the way we did!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932350066"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Is this list always this negative or do you ever see posts actually being <br/>
&gt;&gt;answered in ways that are helpful to the poster?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I usually notice the list getting negative when newer posters come on and <br/>
don&#39;t like what the veteran unschoolers have to say about their unschooling <br/>
experiences. Whatever. It is what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I have an 8 year old daughter who craves a lot of time with other people, <br/>
especially me. She seems to get her energy in an extroverted fashion, by <br/>
bouncing ideas off of other people. She also thinks outloud. I think it is a <br/>
positive thing for her to crave my attention. She needs another being in <br/>
order to get her creative juices flowing and I&#39;m her first choice. That&#39;s a <br/>
cool thing. She also has tons of cool stuff that could be used alone, but <br/>
she prefers to do with me.<br/>
<br/>
When I know I can&#39;t be involved with her for awhile, I will often bring out <br/>
something interesting and set it out on the table. Quite often she&#39;ll get <br/>
into it with me and then let me drift off to do my own thing. She&#39;ll then <br/>
remain happily engaged in the toy or project on her own.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always tried to approach her need for me in positive terms. (And I&#39;m <br/>
not saying you don&#39;t, just giving you my experience.) As she gets older, I <br/>
have noticed more and more independence. But it&#39;s not because it&#39;s something <br/>
I&#39;ve tried to develop in her. It&#39;s more that she knows I&#39;ll always help her <br/>
or be with her or play with her. She knows that I&#39;m accepting of Who She Is <br/>
right now, whether she&#39;s demanding my time or playing alone. I think that <br/>
has freed her up to venture off more on her own and to be more independent. <br/>
She knows I will not be dissappointed should she decide to be bored or needy <br/>
of me again.<br/>
<br/>
As far as TV, computer or electronic media goes.....we have them, we use <br/>
them. Lots of times we use them together, sometimes we drift off to use them <br/>
alone. They&#39;re not the center of our lives nor a forbidden fruit.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
