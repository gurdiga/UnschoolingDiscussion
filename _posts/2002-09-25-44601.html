<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478072330">We are loving the Edward Eager books, and out to get more today.  I&#39;m going to suggest this to relatives who typically give us Chanukah gifts to put E.Eager on the list...used, as long as good conditon, I want to take all his books with us when we make Aliyah.  <br/>
<br/>
This is the style of book I want.  Esther loves it, the math, history, etc. all comes natually...not forced.  And I would like other tales that are similar that cover other topics, be it math or science or history. I find the learning much better when it is embedded and not grafted onto the plot of the book.  She didn&#39;t like the Hollings books so much, so that is out.  <br/>
<br/>
She also is enjoying Owl in the Shower...I less so as the message is more forced, but the story is still a sweet one if you are an environmentalist.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help...<br/>

Amazon. Relatives kept asking her for a list and this way they can go <br/>
to Amazon and read her list at any time. She also uses it to order <br/>
books from for herself. <br/>

Farley Mowat wrote some truly funny memoirs about growing up with many<br/>
animals, including owls.  Titles to try: Owls in the Family, The Dog Who<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t Be.  I would say these are approximately a &quot;Young Adult&quot;<br/>
reading level.  He has also written books about nature and the natural<br/>
world for adults.<br/>

We are enjoying The Dark is Rising sequence of books, by Susan Cooper...gripping story - scifi/fanatsy - with lots of other things well woven into the books - Ancient Britain, Celtic legends, King Arthur legends, architecture, info about the places of Cornwall and Wales...Actually, nearly every book we read ends up leading somewhere else..I am reading an Enid Blyton book to my 7 yo and we ended up getting out books to find out more about archeology - Blyton mentioned diggings in the story...Leonie W. <br/>

story)? I think we read it when my older son was 8 or 9 and he loved <br/>
it, still talks about it sometimes. He&#39;s 11 now. Isn&#39;t there one <br/>
called The Lady or the Tiger? not sure about this.<br/>
<br/>
my most recent favorite historical fiction book is The Shining <br/>
Company by Rosemary Sutcliff. It&#39;s based on the oldest northern <br/>
British poem, The Gododdin, about a battle between the Celts and the <br/>
Saxons. The time just comes alive, the characters are great, very <br/>
real, and the language is (mostly) right in (what I imagine) is the <br/>
period. different enough from modern English to take you to a <br/>
different time. We had trouble getting into it at first (there are <br/>
many Welsh/Welsh-like names and a pronunciation guide and I was <br/>
really anal about trying to pronounce everything correctly and my <br/>
11yo was really impatient with me), but the story still haunts me. <br/>
And it&#39;s been over 2 months since we read it.<br/>

boys, 11 and 7. we live in very rural area now, very different <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60685294">I read the NUMBER DEVIL to Esther a number of years ago (bad, bad pun! Blame dh, he is king of the bad punners).  I should probably try and read it to her again.  I loved it also.  Very funny.<br/>
I kept looking for the further adventures but haven&#39;t found any. :-(<br/>
<br/>
thanks for reminding me about the book!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a short story called &quot;The Lady or the Tiger?&quot;. It&#39;s great, with a<br/>
semi-barbaric princess and her lover.  Sort of guaranteed to start a<br/>
discussion - Rain thinks the princess sent him to the tiger, and I<br/>
thought the lady.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about history, scince, or math, though. More like<br/>
philosophy.<br/>

several other Mowat books when he was around 10-12.  Never Cry Wolf and<br/>
People of the Deer were written for adults, but Lars enjoyed them and<br/>
learned lots from hearing them.  Also Lost in the Barrens and The Viking<br/>
Curse were fascinating.<br/>
