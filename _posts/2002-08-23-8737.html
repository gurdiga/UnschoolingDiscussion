-=Like Traditional Unschooling, Accelerated Unschooling understands that <br/>
children are best able to determine their interests and talents and gifts. <br/>
People are naturally drawn to activities and topics that fit their <br/>
personalities-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Frank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_?  I really <br/>
think you&#39;d like it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Many children and adults <br/>
have very strong gifts and interests that they&#39;d like to pursue, but limited <br/>
resources, and, even more, procrastination or laziness keep them from <br/>
pursuing them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In any unschooling family it&#39;s the parents&#39; part to provide opportunities and <br/>
inspiration.  I&#39;m not really picturing what would &quot;accelerate&quot; it and still <br/>
keep it in the realm of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My original question was where are the support groups in various states, or <br/>
where is this written up on the internet, because I had never heard of it <br/>
until the other day.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Accelerated Unschooling allows the parent to take control of <br/>
the motivation piece.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once parents have &quot;taken control&quot; of ANY piece, how is it then still learning <br/>
at one&#39;s own pace ?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is especially important for children who are <br/>
Gifted or Talented, but who often lack motivation. Accelerated Unschooling <br/>
allows them to reach their potentials.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tell me more.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My personal experience with Accelerated Unschooling has been particularly <br/>
dramatic. I have fo have begun Accelerated <br/>
Unschooling, they have excelled in all of their areas of giftedness &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What method were you using before &quot;accelerated unschooling&quot;?<br/>
Were the children ever in school?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Accelerated Unschooling is becoming more popular. I attended a workshop <br/>
with <br/>
its inventors, Conrad and Lydia Menapolit, in California, and it has changed <br/>
our lives. We are hoping that Conrad and Lydia will be doing more workshops, <br/>
but they are presently in Austria writing a book about Accelerated <br/>
Unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When and where was the workshop?  At a conference?<br/>
I&#39;m really surprised I hadn&#39;t heard about it, so yes, please give me any <br/>
resources you have so I can understand it, since I get VERY many inquiries <br/>
from others about unschooling.<br/>
