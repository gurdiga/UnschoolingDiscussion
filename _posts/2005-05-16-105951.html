programs you tell it to onto a hard drive. It has a program guide <br/>
that&#39;s downloaded to it weekly so it knows what channel and time <br/>
everything is on and you just tell it which programs you want it to <br/>
record. The drives hold anywhere from 30 to 100 (maybe more by now) <br/>
hours of programs.<br/>
<br/>
You can get &quot;season passes&quot; to your favorite shows and it will <br/>
dutifully record them even if the station time shifts the program or <br/>
shows a longer episode. You can also tell it to just record the new <br/>
episodes so it will skip over repeats over Christmas and catch season <br/>
premieres even if they start at a goofy time of the TV season.<br/>
<br/>
Then you can watch your shows when you want to instead of when the <br/>
stations decide to put them on.<br/>
<br/>
I think when my daughter was younger she often watched TV because she <br/>
was afraid of missing something. But with TiVo there&#39;s no need to do <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s available in Canada.<br/>
