&lt;&lt; My DS is asking for a chess set for his 4th b-day next month and I&#39;d<br/>
 like to learn to play along with him.  Anyone have any links, books,<br/>
 or other recommendations for beginners? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend the book &quot;Learn chess in a weekend&quot; by Ken Whyld.<br/>
It&#39;s got a lot of pictures and bits and pieces of information that make the <br/>
basics very understandable. It covers a lot of information.<br/>
<br/>
Watch &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; together, great movie.<br/>
And the guy that the movie is about, Josh Waitzkin, has his own chess books <br/>
out (he&#39;s all grown up now). Good start anyway.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
