 </span></blockquote>Hi all - coming out of lurkdom to add my two cents.<br/>
<br/>
At Camie&#39;s first dentist visit at about 3 1/2, I was told her enamel <br/>
was weakening and she needed to have a few of her teeth capped.  Joey <br/>
at 2 had decay on four front teeth.  Both of them were taken to <br/>
surgery.  Camie came out with all of her teeth capped in silver - <br/>
quite a surprise!  Joey had four front teeth on top removed and four <br/>
more capped.  The dentist said it was from juice in bottles. So when <br/>
third child, Andrew, came along, he got absolutely no juice in <br/>
bottles, I took the best care of his teeth and he has two very rotten <br/>
front teeth - the worst of all three.  They don&#39;t hurt him but look <br/>
awful.  We&#39;ve left them alone.  Joey had pain in his teeth so I felt <br/>
OK with having them pulled but he still doesn&#39;t have any front teeth <br/>
and he is 9 years old!  We haven&#39;t been to the dentist in a while - I <br/>
am looking for a new one - and their teeth are relatively healthy.  <br/>
Our Pediatrician, who I really love, says Andrew should have his<br/>
front teeth removed because he could have health problems like <br/>
infections constantly. But since I pulled Camie and Joey from school <br/>
two years ago, they have been rarely sick and have only needed to go <br/>
to the doctor for well check ups. Dh has lousy teeth, mine aren&#39;t <br/>
perfect but OK.  So genetics could be a factor, but this little slice <br/>
of &quot;expert advice&quot; has been one more chapter in trusting my own <br/>
instincts with my children over what the experts (ie doctors) say.  <br/>
The guilt I was made to feel over not taking care of the first two <br/>
children&#39;s teeth was enormous - it&#39;s gone now though &lt;g&gt;. When and if <br/>
the children have problems with their teeth, like pain, we will go to <br/>
the dentist.  But I certainly will question carefully whatever the <br/>
dentist advises - I won&#39;t go back to blind trust. Just hope we can <br/>
find one that won&#39;t lay on the guilt trip like the last one did and <br/>
just treat their teeth!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening to this ramble.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa, mom to Camie - 10, Joey - 9, and Andrew - 5 and learning to <br/>
trust myself!</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes, I have noticed, that when baby teeth are *taken too early (for <br/>
whatever reason) the permanent teeth don&#39;t always grow in as quickly as when <br/>
the teeth come out on their own. My Nephew, at the age of four was in a car <br/>
accident and his two upper front teeth were knocked out. He was almost 11 <br/>
before his permanent adult teeth came in. <br/>
<br/>
Another aside, if you have a child who has baby teeth, but no permanent teeth <br/>
behind them, and the dentist tells you the baby teeth have to come out and a <br/>
bridge made for your child.... that isn&#39;t always the case. I still have four <br/>
baby teeth and have had two different dentists tell me that they needed to <br/>
come out  and a bridge put in. I have no cavities or decay on those teeth, <br/>
they are not loose nor do they hurt or bother me in anyway. <br/>
I recently had to change dentists and told her what the other two dentists <br/>
had told me, and she said that unless there were problems with the teeth, <br/>
they could stay, and that pulling them and putting in a bridge was just <br/>
unnecessary and painful work. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-334907935">I wonder if something else is going on.  People have nursed, including<br/>
through the night from the beginning of time.  Since the advent of bottles,<br/>
babies have nursed/chewed on bottles through the night.  The kidlets were<br/>
all in my bed  and nursed all night.  The kidlets all loved juice and hauled<br/>
a bottle around or a tommy tippy cup after the bottle full of juice.  Not<br/>
one of the kidlets had any teeth problems, not even a cavity.  Well, except<br/>
son #3 who had a root canal when he was 7 but that was compliments of a kid<br/>
shoving him into a metal post.<br/>
<br/>
None of my aunts and uncles had any teeth problems and my grandmother was<br/>
the one who told me that she thought that putting babies in bassinets was<br/>
the reason for SIDS and that all hers had stayed in her bed until they were<br/>
bumped out by the next child.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it isn&#39;t all the chemicals/pesticides/preservatives in foods,<br/>
chemicals and allowable levels of pesticides in water and the off-gassing<br/>
from plastics and teflon, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago we didn&#39;t think anything was wrong with drinking or smoking during<br/>
a pregnancy.  I wonder if later we will find out that all these<br/>
&quot;conveniences&quot; are responsible for this rash of tooth problems in small<br/>
children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415974441">My breast fed baby, no bottles, no apple juice or sweet red stuff, developed cavities in her four front teeth, as an infant. The doctor at Sick Kids Hospital insisted it was from breast feeding through the night! We continued to breast feed on demand for years afterward and never had another problem. These days she has a very active sweet tooth and she brushes in the morning and at night and hasn&#39;t had a cavity since.

BUT - I also think over brushing is as bad as if not worse than <br/>

get MORE cavities not less.  I also believe (against everything every <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30222061">I heard a health news report yesterday that said athletes suffer from more viruses and infections than other people. This is because their excessive physical activity leaves their bodies in a dryer, less mucous, state. This proves your theory too! I&#39;ve also read that saliva is full of antibodies, that protect the body from illness being received orally, and also protect the teeth. <br/>
<br/>
My dd, that had the cavities as an infant, got her first tooth at four months and a day. When the cavities appeared it seemed to happen in an instant. One day the teeth looked perfect the next day she had obvious decay. It cost thousands to have the work done to restore them. I had my first truly adult reality check when I realized how vulnerable we are and how lucky for us that we could afford to take care of this. My heart has been broken ever since for all of the children who can&#39;t get proper dental treatment... All of the mothers all over the world who can&#39;t keep they&#39;re babies safe etc etc etc.........I&#39;m afraid that becoming a mother is truly an affliction one can never recover from!!!

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357122469">Nancy, <br/>
<br/>
La Leche League says dentists will often blame &quot;falling asleep at the breast&quot; for tooth decay, but that this isn&#39;t in fact the cause. <br/>
<br/>
If you have ever seen a diagram of what the breast would look like in profile if we could see inside the mouth, you&#39;ll understand what LLL is saying. The nipple is drawn far, far into the mouth, almost to the throat. So, they say, the milk can&#39;t pool near the teeth the way milk (or juice) from a bottle can. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some articles on this question, in LLL publications and in Mothering Magazine, with statistical studies on cavities in bottlefed and breastfed babies, and it made sense to me. Anecdotally, our son still nurses day and night (at 2-1/2 years) and so far shows no sign of tooth decay. <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of factors involved, so who knows? <br/>

When you consider that he slept primarily on my left breast (his right side <br/>
facing down) and all the decay he had was on his right side (right central, <br/>
lateral and incisor), I believe it was from breast milk pooling in his mouth.<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that other factors don&#39;t figure into it--my youngest <br/>
daughter nursed for 25 months (all night, every night) and she didn&#39;t have <br/>
&quot;nursing bottle mouth&quot;. She starting having problems with her teeth when she <br/>
developed allergies (around age 5) and had to start using antihistimines.  <br/>
And my son doesn&#39;t have allergies and has taken VERY little medication.<br/>

I *think* it&#39;s available over the counter, and you&#39;d just squirt some in before you go to bed, and maybe when you get up during the night to keep your mouth moist.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547043169">I don&#39;t know whether my other message on this got through - I was having<br/>
some computer problems.<br/>
<br/>
What I said was that the reason breastfeeding at night doesn&#39;t cause the<br/>
same problem as a bottle does (with milk pooling around the teeth) is<br/>
supposed to be because the breast actually extends enormously, way far back<br/>
into the mouth, to where the throat begins. I saw a drawing of this once in<br/>
a book. It was drawn in profile, as if the child&#39;s mouth were &quot;see-through&quot;,<br/>
and it was amazing to see how far that part of the breast (not just the<br/>
nipple, but the entire areola) &quot;stretches&quot;. (Now, I don&#39;t know how the<br/>
authors of this book knew this, but that was what they were claiming.)<br/>
<br/>
The other reason breastmilk is not supposed to be a danger to teeth is that,<br/>
as someone mentioned, it contains substances that help prevent tooth decay<br/>
(maybe antibodies, I&#39;m not sure).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as several people have said, there are a lot of factors involved,<br/>
including genetics, so I wouldn&#39;t leap to conclusions upon seeing any<br/>
individual kid with decayed teeth. (Except that Koolaid in a bottle would<br/>
seem to be a bad idea in general, and breastfeeding is probably not the<br/>
culprit some medical people make it out to be.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900987055">My dentist recently told me that the majority of children with &#39;bad&#39; teeth (teeth that decay easily, lose enamel early, etc.) have one parent that has or had problems. So far, in our family, this seems to be the case. Bottles nowadays are made to be very similar to true nipples -- I did a lot of comparing when I switched from nursing to bottlefeeding, and was pleasantly surprised to see good changes since my last child.<br/>

as we&#39;ve tried to take it away on the advice of the ped).<br/>

extra nourishment because he was growing very rapidly.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
how old yours is but mine went from the very bottom of the growth <br/>
chart at birth to darn near the top of it now at age nine.  He <br/>
crossed the midpoint at around 1.  My ped tried to tell me not to let <br/>
him eat in the middle of the night too.  He stopped on his own <br/>
eventually.<br/>
