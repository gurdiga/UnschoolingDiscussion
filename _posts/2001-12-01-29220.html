<div id="ygrps-yiv-955603752">I mentioned in an earlier post that I once developed a method for learning<br/>
foreign languages, and a couple of people have said they&#39;d like to hear<br/>
about it, so here goes.<br/>
<br/>
I came up with this method because I was thinking about how to help my<br/>
(adult) beginning English students in their one-on-one private classes, when<br/>
I was living in Madrid. I wanted to put myself in the place of a beginner,<br/>
so I looked in the paper for somebody who was giving private lessons in some<br/>
language I&#39;d never studied or had any other experience with. I found a<br/>
Russian teacher (and native speaker of Russian - very important).<br/>
<br/>
I equipped myself with a tape recorder and asked her to come to my<br/>
apartment. I told her I wanted her to narrate my actions in Russian. I had<br/>
her talk to me in Russian only. I didn&#39;t speak at all, at first.<br/>
<br/>
I would, for example, put my hand on top of my head, then put my hand on the<br/>
table, then put a book on top of my head. She had to say, in Russian,<br/>
something like, &quot;You&#39;re putting your hand on top of your head, now you put<br/>
your hand on the table, now you&#39;re putting that book on top of your head.&quot;<br/>
(Note that minor variations in phrasing crop up, like putting things in the<br/>
present or the past tense, adding &quot;now&quot; or not, etc. The important thing is<br/>
for the person to speak naturally.)<br/>
<br/>
I recorded all of this. Then, after a few minutes, I&#39;d play back the<br/>
recording, trying to do what I had just done again, in time to the<br/>
recording. If I got it wrong, she&#39;d gesture to me.<br/>
<br/>
The entire process was under my control. Sometimes I relied on my memory for<br/>
what I&#39;d just done, and other times some word would seem to leap out at me<br/>
and I&#39;d experiment with whether it might mean &quot;hand&quot; or &quot;head&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;teacher&quot; had no way of judging how much or how fast I was learning,<br/>
which took all the pressure off me. Then, at my leisure and on my own time,<br/>
I&#39;d play back the recordings I&#39;d made - sometimes while doing something else<br/>
like washing the dishes (in which case I&#39;d just let the sounds of Russian<br/>
wash over me) and sometimes listening more intently and trying to figure out<br/>
specific things. At some point I played back some bits to her and had her<br/>
write them out so I could get a feel for how they looked.<br/>
<br/>
We went very quickly from a kind of rigid &quot;you-narrate-what-I-do&quot; thing to a<br/>
kind of conversation, with little drawings back and forth when we didn&#39;t<br/>
understand each other. I can&#39;t tell you how many sessions we did together<br/>
before I began to spontaneously say a word here and there in Russian, but it<br/>
wasn&#39;t many.<br/>
<br/>
I continued with this method for a few months (even though none of my<br/>
English students found it at all helpful) because I enjoyed it so much.<br/>
Later I bought a couple of Russian children&#39;s books, and one of those &quot;in 20<br/>
easy lessons&quot; paperbacks, but the main method continued to be her speaking<br/>
in Russian, and me gesturing and employing the few words and phrases I knew.<br/>
<br/>
You really should try to get a native speaker.<br/>
<br/>
It should also be someone who&#39;s willing to take on a fairly passive role. My<br/>
teacher did some odd things at first because she wasn&#39;t used to this. Within<br/>
the first few minutes of the first class, she launched into an explanation<br/>
of why she was using a certain preposition in the phrase, &quot;You walk over to<br/>
the wardrobe&quot; (I only realized this much later, when I was listening to that<br/>
first tape after having learned enough Russian to have an idea of what she<br/>
must be saying).<br/>
<br/>
She also started off by saying, for example, &quot;I put the book on my head&quot;<br/>
instead of, &quot;You put the book on your head&quot;. (She must have been trying to<br/>
get INSIDE my head, in an effort to help me learn faster - again, I only<br/>
figured this out later on, and I was confused about &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot; for some<br/>
time after that.)<br/>
<br/>
The English students I suggested this method to hated it. They wanted to be<br/>
passive. They felt I wasn&#39;t earning my pay if I didn&#39;t sit them down and<br/>
have them do exercises, and correct them. Or they felt too panicky when they<br/>
didn&#39;t immediately understand everything I said.<br/>
<br/>
If anybody on this list tries this method, please email me privately about<br/>
how it goes. (I&#39;m going to be on and off he list, so I might miss a post.)<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get an email when I (someday) write up the notes I have on<br/>
this method (and on my experiences in teaching English as a second language<br/>
in general), and get it published somewhere, let me know this, too, and I&#39;ll<br/>
put you on a list.<br/>
<br/>
I originally mentioned my method in a post suggesting that Sarah Carothers&#39;<br/>
daughter learn Spanish (or some other very phonetically consistent language)<br/>
to see whether she might gain confidence in her ability to improve her<br/>
reading and writing in English (an extremely phonetically inconsistent<br/>
language).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wondered whether anyone has compared the statistics on<br/>
&quot;dyslexia&quot; in various countries (it didn&#39;t seem to claim as many sufferers<br/>
in Spain as here, when I lived in that country).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065276143">Thanks, Elsa!  Please add me to your list of contacts and also, I appreciate your sharing this method. Sounds like it would be a *lot* more fun than workbooks and grading imo!<br/>
