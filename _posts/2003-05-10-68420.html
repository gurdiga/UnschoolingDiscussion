When one goes to school to be a teacher I would imagine they have looked into <br/>
what this pays and had done some research. Right?<br/>
<br/>
I know people here in town that are horrible role models that have chosen <br/>
teaching. <br/>
The problem is that not all teachers are monsters but a good many have shown <br/>
that there are more bad ones than there should be.<br/>
My sister is dealing with one in UT right now. She is verbally abusive daily <br/>
and making kids carry heavy items as a punishment. Then asking my sisters <br/>
daughter AFTER she was told to knock it off , &quot;Well if your hands hurt so bad <br/>
then how did you do PE?&quot; Due process, my ass, fire her now! This is Public <br/>
school funded by the people it is wrong!<br/>
<br/>
I look at it this way if one cannot teach and uphold the contract they signed <br/>
get off the chalk board and find a different profession. Oh but wait....they <br/>
would make less.....<br/>
<br/>
All I want is the funds the school got to keep my son in the resource room to <br/>
force him read Dick and Jane. <br/>
I should have my salary doubled cuz he is reading novels now. HUH!<br/>
