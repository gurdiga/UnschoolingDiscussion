<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801295123"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I agree with Brenda........(some tidbits)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You personally find spiritual fulfillment differently.........<br/>
I would suggest that the fact that it works for them makes it an equally <br/>
valid path to spiritual fulfillment.<br/>
Please don&#39;t judge my choice of path.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The surest obstacle on the path to the Divine is the arrogant belief that <br/>
there is but one route and yours is the only map.&quot;  -J.D. Gold<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
