probably speak English?  I know that during the week I spent in Germany<br/>
long, long ago, I got a lot of practice understanding and got much better at<br/>
it.  But any time I tried to speak, they would want to practise their<br/>
English on me.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I only took one year of German, which I&#39;m much grateful for, but wish I&#39;d<br/>
had the patience back then for more.  I suppose if I lived off post (not<br/>

how it is, so I&#39;m improving, just very, very slowly.<br/>

Total immersion. WAAAY cool....for a school! &lt;G&gt; I attended two different <br/>
ones for three months. I was a resident, but they have &quot;day students&quot; too. <br/>
<br/>
Ben went when we were stationed there. Six-eight weeks---and the serviced <br/>
PAID for it! He understands almost all conversational german aimed at him, <br/>
but he still struggles with speaking (VERY normal sequence---just like our <br/>
children as they learn english. Understanding comes first, then speaking). <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one good thing about listening to the radio.  They don&#39;t switch over.<br/>
When I first started listening to the German stations, I would switch<br/>
stations when they started to talk.  Then I remembered something that I<br/>
think John Holt wrote about babies learning language by listening, then<br/>
trying to make the sounds and gradually getting better at it.  He thought<br/>
foreign languages should be learned the same way.  The only problem for<br/>
adults is that stage of gradually getting better at making the sounds.<br/>
Young children don&#39;t mind not being perfect, but we&#39;ve &quot;educated&quot; to be<br/>
uncomfortable with less than perfection.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m just going to listen for a good long while.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you could find someone who could use some company and offer to<br/>
trade some kind of service (music lessons?) for coffee, conversation, and a<br/>
promise not to switch to English other than to translate the things you just<br/>
can&#39;t understand.<br/>
