<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&#39;Death, the only immortal, who treats us all alike, whose peace and whose<br/>
 </span></blockquote>refuge are for all. The soiled and the pure, the rich and the poor, the<br/>
loved and the unloved.&#39;<br/>
Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens), American humorous novelist, died in 1910. Twain<br/>
wrote these last words as a deathbed memorandum.&lt;&lt;<br/>
