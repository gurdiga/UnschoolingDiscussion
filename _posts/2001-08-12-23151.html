why would she do that?&quot;  Before I came to America and as I was growing up I <br/>
thought the only boys that were circumsized were Jewish.  Even though I still <br/>

As an outspoken person, I don&#39;t have a problem with the word mutilation.  To <br/>
me that&#39;s what it is, pure and simple.  I can&#39;t think of a &quot;nice&quot; way to put <br/>
cutting off pieces of my son&#39;s flesh, while he screams in pain and agony, <br/>
strapped to a board, with no mother or father to hold him, in a room full of <br/>
strangers.  From what I understand the Jewish ceremony is nothing like that, <br/>
however there must still be pain involved and I just could not do it.... Just <br/>
one person&#39;s feelings expressed in this forum....<br/>
