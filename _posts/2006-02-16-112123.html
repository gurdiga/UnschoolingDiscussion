&gt; It&#39;s like she is out ahead of herself just a little and can&#39;t get back<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am curious about a few things here.  First the idea of &quot;mastering&quot; <br/>
something.  Do you have to have &quot;mastered&quot; something to be able to do <br/>
it alone?  If so, I need some serious supervision in my life because <br/>
except maybe for breathing, I haven&#39;t mastered anything!LOL!  You only <br/>
gave the example of cooking so I can&#39;t comment on any other situations <br/>
of this phenomenon that is producing tension for you and your daughter. <br/>
Cooking seems to be an ideal venue for trying out independence.  It is <br/>
cheap, very safe and endlessly variable.  If she wants to cook and bake <br/>
without you, let her!  Then try the food and unless asked, hold the <br/>
comments to yourself!  My daughter will be six next month and has been <br/>
cooking and baking (with an Easy Bake and in the regular kitchen) since <br/>
she was so small she couldn&#39;t even see the top of the counter.  Her <br/>
cakes used to be a mixture of all sorts of &quot;un-cake-like&quot; things <br/>
(paprika, flour, jelly) they were horrible to taste but a joy for her <br/>
to make.  Over the years she has cooked with other people (mostly me) a <br/>
lot.  She has watched A LOT of cooking shows and now she can even read <br/>
cookbooks.  She has invented some delicious cakes (chocolate ginger is <br/>
the best.)  Except for taking things out of the big oven when she was <br/>
littler these are completely her projects.  Who cares if a cake doesn&#39;t <br/>
have butter of leavening.  It might be good, it might be bad and it <br/>
might be different next time.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter might be on the cusp of a new development stage in her <br/>
life that is making her want your companionship but not your input (in <br/>
other words, physically being there but not saying a word!)  Having <br/>
been a being that experienced everything through her body in the early <br/>
years, she may be moving into a time when her emotions rule her <br/>
thoughts and all experiences are filtered through those emotions.  This <br/>
new stage of life is often earmarked by increasing abilities and also <br/>
increasing desire to be able to &quot;do for oneself.&quot;  Appearance suddenly <br/>
becomes more important as does skills competence. (Steiner, Joseph <br/>
Chilton Pearce, Montessori--they all describe these various stages in <br/>
different ways.  There is a book called &quot;Natural Learning Rhythms&quot; by <br/>
Josette and Sambatha Luvmour that distills it all nicely).<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am trying to say is let her hurtle on ahead, trying <br/>
things, experimenting, succeeding, failing as Ms. Frizzle (Magic School <br/>
Bus) is fond of saying &quot;Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!&quot;  It <br/>
might be uncomfortable or even sad for your to &quot;watch from the outside&quot; <br/>
  for awhile. But as long as she stills invites you in when she is <br/>
exuberant or overwhelmed, you will be in good shape.  A person need not <br/>
&quot;master&quot; something to do it, one just needs to DO IT!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to you and your daughter!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-260264105">Hi Jen,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for writing I knew I would receive some interesting<br/>
perspectives about what was going on and it was a joy to read about<br/>
what you have done with your daughter. <br/>
<br/>
It is not that I insist on mastery my wording was just meant to convey<br/>
how things are turning out vs how they are intended at the start.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see her as wanting to just play around and experiment because<br/>
that is not how she has projected herself. It is not what she sees<br/>
herself as doing or wanting to do.<br/>
<br/>
Since I love to bake and cook she has always been exposed to all of<br/>
that and could have and has joined in in different ways. She&#39;s never<br/>
shown a serious interest in anything but the finished products :)<br/>
<br/>
Now all of a sudden she is Julia Childs, Martha or Emril? Leave me<br/>
alone in the kitchen mom? Just not what I was expecting.<br/>
<br/>
Are we entering a new stage of development or is this just a<br/>
relationship glitch we have never gotten over? LOL it seems like both<br/>
the more I write and think about it.<br/>
<br/>
I will give you a non food/kitchen example.<br/>
<br/>
One evening we are headed to the store or must have been a drive<br/>
through because she decides to travel without shoes and I am thinking<br/>
&quot;riduculous, no no no&quot; but I don&#39;t say anything. As we are out I<br/>
realize I want to run into a local store, might have been a sale going<br/>
on or something I forgot we needed, what ever it is I could not<br/>
because she is shoe less. ggggrrrr<br/>
<br/>
We talk about this and I explain to her how this has inconvenienced us<br/>
as a family.<br/>
<br/>
Weeks later we are headed to a roller skating rink. She decides to<br/>
wear skates only and not take any shoes. Again I am not thrilled about<br/>
the idea but I say nothing.<br/>
<br/>
(Because there is this issue of her rejecting my advice)<br/>
<br/>
But half way through our double skating session her feet start hurting<br/>
or she just decided she wanted to hang out with her friends rather<br/>
than skate whichever. So off came the skates and she shuffled around<br/>
shoe less for the next couple of hours. A violation of the rules of<br/>
the establishment and to my dismay for the poor socks. <br/>
<br/>
When we were leaving it was evening. She took her socks off to save<br/>
them from pavement dirt on the way to the car but she was cold. We<br/>
stopped at her friends house to drop them off at home afterwards and<br/>
it got later as we were hanging out. On her way home her feet were cold.<br/>
<br/>
We talk about the fact that she could have brought shoes even if she<br/>
didn&#39;t want to wear them out the door. <br/>
<br/>
The NEXT day we are headed to a park day. There is no sun in the sky<br/>
and tho this is CA where we in Northern to Middle CA have had a record<br/>
winter in terms of lovely temps it was nippy that day.<br/>
<br/>
As we are getting ready she decides she is wearing flip flops. I said<br/>
get some shoes and socks. Now I meant wear them but I didn&#39;t utter<br/>
that and all I really needed her to do was bring them along.<br/>
<br/>
She starts to argue with me and I start to argue with her. But I catch<br/>
myself. I am upset because it amazes me with this recent history of<br/>
her shoe choices and the problems it has created she wouldn&#39;t think<br/>
ahead with me.<br/>
<br/>
I calmly tell her all she has to do is bring the shoes.  I ask her<br/>
what she has planned should she get cold while we are at the park<br/>
because I tell her since I am packing and preparing it is unlikely<br/>
that I will want to turn around and come home over this issue. <br/>
<br/>
Pouting she gathers them and I ask her to start packing the car. Just<br/>
going from inside to the garage and putting things in the trunk she<br/>
decides her feet are FREEZING and opts against flip flops.<br/>
<br/>
When we got to the park she was so cold she wanted to leave early (she<br/>
also didn&#39;t find any specific friends she wanted to play with so it&#39;s<br/>
not like she was too cold to have any fun.)<br/>
<br/>
I have tried letting her reap her own consequences, and long before I<br/>
tried having her be part of the decision making and plan for her own<br/>
comfort but she fought me on that too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368897714">Could you keep some socks, shoes and a sweatshirt in the car? My daughter is<br/>
much younger, so maybe this does not apply - but she often wants to wear<br/>
things that are inappropriate (like dollar store high heels to someplace<br/>
where we will be walking ALOT). So, I might suggest she forgo her idea<br/>
(which she rarely wants to do - of course, who can blame her??) and then we<br/>
bring back up stuff (which I am in charge of) and she is fine with that. She<br/>
decides when she needs different shoes, shirt etc. and does not feel like<br/>
she was forced/coerced into compliance with my ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226771705">Hi Amy,<br/>
<br/>
Indeed my issue starts with the fact that my dd is older.....<br/>
<br/>
But this problem started back when she was much younger.<br/>
<br/>
I guess where I have been most recently is in a place that says why<br/>
should I pack an extra changes of things when she could wear them in<br/>
the first place or pack them herself.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a car currently which further complicates things but<br/>
only by slight.<br/>
<br/>
Previously this hasn&#39;t been such a serious issue because her choices<br/>
of attire haven&#39;t negatively impacted me or I was able to convince her<br/>
to bring what I anticipated she might need.<br/>
<br/>
But where I see that she sometimes needs things she wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
brought but that I tell her, she feels that the fact she doesn&#39;t<br/>
always need them means she shouldn&#39;t have to bother.<br/>
<br/>
So simple it&#39;s complicated lol<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling will work better if the focus is the relationship you have <br/>
with your child, and not on &quot;teaching&quot; her something. In the scenario <br/>
you posted, about shoes, you seem to want her to learn <br/>
(through &quot;natural consequences&quot;?)that she should wear shoes. <br/>
<br/>
How hard would it have been for you to not even MENTION shoes, quietly <br/>
pick some up to take with you (or if its a regular occurence just keep <br/>
a spare pair in the car)and when she needed them you couldve said &quot;Oh, <br/>
there&#39;s a pair in the car, let me go get them for you!&quot;...she probably <br/>
wouldve been grateful, and thought it was nice of you. Instead you <br/>
*know* she will probably need shoes on the outing, and yet you dont <br/>
prepare for that. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the kitchen post, i&#39;m a little bothered by the insistence <br/>
that since its your mother&#39;s kitchen, she needs to do things a certain <br/>
way. Will the kitchen actually get more messy her way than your way? <br/>
And if so, can part of how you help your daughter be cleaning up the <br/>
kitchen for her? Or do you expect her to clean up the entire kitchen <br/>
on her own after baking? Thats quite a job for a 9 yr old.<br/>
<br/>
If you focus more on your relationship and less on getting things to <br/>
go your way, i bet you both will be alot happier.<br/>

<br/>
Are you feeling a resentful about any other things, too? Because, if  <br/>
you want her to learn to plan ahead, truly, the best way for HER to  <br/>
learn to bring along stuff she might need is for you to DO it.<br/>
<br/>
Think about this scenario. Your on your way out the door and you say,  <br/>
&quot;We might go somewhere else, while we&#39;re out, so bring your shoes,  <br/>
okay?&quot; She says, &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to and I won&#39;t need them.&quot; So -  <br/>
you gather them up and stick them in your bag (I&#39;m sure you&#39;re  <br/>
carrying some kind of bag). Later, when you want to stop in  <br/>
somewhere, go ahead and try the bare feet, see what happens. MAYBE  <br/>
she&#39;s right! But, if someone says, &quot;You need shoes to be in here,&quot;  <br/>
then you can pop them out. You don&#39;t have to SAY anything, she&#39;ll  <br/>
think, &quot;Oh - she brought them anyway. Good thing.&quot; That&#39;s how she&#39;ll  <br/>
learn to be prepared. And the learning might come slowly. It might  <br/>
not seem to have sunk in - but it will.<br/>
<br/>
Hey - I DID that when we were visiting in Sandra&#39;s family in  <br/>
Albuquerque. It was weird for my kids because the sun was so bright  <br/>
and the sky so clear and blue, but the air was very cold - colder  <br/>
than we ever have, here in Southern California. When it is that sunny  <br/>
and clear here, it is usually reasonably warm, too. They&#39;d leave the  <br/>
house without sweatshirts or jackets because it didn&#39;t look, from  <br/>
inside, like it was going to be that cold outside. So every time we  <br/>
left the house, I picked up some jackets and sweatshirts. I also  <br/>
looked at their feet and if they went out wearing flip-flops, I&#39;d  <br/>
grab socks and shoes, too. And one time I think even Holly, who lives  <br/>
there, was happy to wear one of the extra sweatshirts I&#39;d brought along.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking to bring warmer clothes is just something people learn to do  <br/>
from experience - kids will learn to do it too, over time, because  <br/>
they see us doing it.<br/>
<br/>
This seems kind of a simple little issue, though, Tosca, so I&#39;m  <br/>
wondering (guessing) - is there more going on than this - other  <br/>
conflicts or other ways your expectations aren&#39;t being met and you&#39;re  <br/>
feeling a little resentful?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026356517">Heyas Pam,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your post.<br/>
<br/>
The extremely frustrating thing about this whole issue (and yes it is<br/>
petty in it&#39;s own way) is my dd is SO capable of taking care of<br/>
herself when she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t they all? ;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that she hasn&#39;t seen me model preparatory behavior. It&#39;s not<br/>
that she can&#39;t plan ahead. <br/>
<br/>
There are days when she will do everything but prepare my coffee and<br/>
drive where we are going. Jackets, sweaters, appropriate dress/shoes,<br/>
snacks, drinks and things to entertain herself. And then those days<br/>
where she won&#39;t brush teeth or hair without being told. go figure<br/>
<br/>
And again I say none of this just started. Now however it is against<br/>
the back drop of having our lives turned upside down by being evicted<br/>
and coming to live with my parents!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that she is not meeting my expectations it&#39;s that I am not<br/>
meeting hers.<br/>
<br/>
Our wires and signals are all crossed and miss firing. This much I<br/>
know, how to fix it is coming more slowly.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to keep our lives as normal for us as possible but we have<br/>
both been grieving and dealing with the new stresses. sigh<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354713676">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I am sharing this message I posted to local groups of mine lately for<br/>
those of you who are new and anxious about academics and everything else:<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
We are a single mother and daughter who were invited to park days by<br/>
members of a local hs group when my daughter was about 4 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing ordinary local families raising kids without school, staying<br/>
close knit and bonded yet learning and growing so inspired me I<br/>
decided to &#39;try homeschooling&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
And I thought at that time it would mean doing school type work and<br/>
definitely testing regularly all at home.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t join a charter or buy any curriculum but mostly because I<br/>
didn&#39;t know how, I wasn&#39;t sure what all my options were or how to<br/>
research them but time was passing and before you know it my daughter<br/>
was &quot;school age&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
She was learning and growing off the charts in social areas with a<br/>
vocabulary and skills in articulation that astounded people where ever<br/>
we went.<br/>
<br/>
But when I started trying to introduce items of academic structure she<br/>
just totally balked....so I backed off wondering what I was doing<br/>
wrong and how she was ever going to learn math, science, reading or<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the line I realized homeschooling is not just about an<br/>
educational method it&#39;s about life and we had been living for years in<br/>
the same way we were when she turned 5.<br/>
<br/>
Then the term unschooling came into view and tho I was initially<br/>
opposed to purposely not schooling a child it dawned on me I wasn&#39;t<br/>
schooling and she was still learning all the things I thought I needed<br/>
to teach so maybe there was something to the whole idea.<br/>
<br/>
Now years later I am seeing the fruit of me laying down the idea of<br/>
schooling at home and embracing the idea that life is learning.<br/>
<br/>
Recently the following happened:<br/>
<br/>
I have introduced many concepts to her but not consistently, and with<br/>
no way of gaging proficiency in math beyond general counting, simple<br/>
addition, subtraction and basic multiplication.<br/>
<br/>
One day I walk into our room and find her curled up with a math<br/>
puzzles work book that has been sitting on her shelf for years. Just<br/>
something I picked up at the $1 store one day thinking it might<br/>
interest her and looked like something we were capable of doing<br/>
together. If she ever got interested.<br/>
<br/>
But here she was just happily working along not even seeming to need<br/>
any help and I was thinking; there is no way she can get through that,<br/>
we haven&#39;t worked on it, we&#39;ve barely talked about it. There are place<br/>
value issues she is going to run into....<br/>
<br/>
She asked me a few questions as she worked and tho I was running the<br/>
numbers on a side piece of paper I was careful to just explain what<br/>
she asked for only when she asked me.<br/>
<br/>
Later she went to bed not quite finished with the puzzle tired but<br/>
feeling happy and satisfied. The next morning she was right back at it<br/>
when she woke up till she finished.<br/>
<br/>
Watching her I was thinking if I had been insisting she work on math<br/>
in an &#39;appropriate&#39; way based on what a school system or even society<br/>
would say I would have no anxiety about what she knew in terms of her<br/>
picking up a text or workbook to spend some time working in.<br/>
<br/>
But would she have the same kind of joy over what she were doing?<br/>
Based on my own experiences and stories I hear from others I think not.<br/>
<br/>
This just renewed my faith in the process of just letting her live<br/>
and not forcing her to perform and repeat for my benefit under the<br/>
mistaken idea that it is best for her.<br/>
<br/>
More recently she became hooked on the Disney channel.<br/>
<br/>
She used to watch very little TV right up until my parents put a<br/>
satellite dish link on the TV in the family room and boom within a few<br/>
weeks. Yikes lol sigh<br/>
<br/>
She has books, games, puzzles, crafts, friends all kinds of other<br/>
options to choose from which we have done for years but TV is suddenly<br/>
just a top priority.<br/>
<br/>
I have been mostly biting my tongue but it is hard to just wait this out.<br/>
<br/>
So one day a few weeks ago I bought a 1000 piece jig saw puzzle and<br/>
set it up in the room we share. That night long before bed time she<br/>
shut off the TV and came in to work on it.<br/>
<br/>
Tucking in my surprise I mentioned that it seemed odd for her to be<br/>
away from the TV during prime time if you will. She explained to me<br/>
that she didn&#39;t want to spend all her time watching TV and not have<br/>
any time to work on the puzzle. I didn&#39;t say anything else to her and<br/>
continued with what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
But a bit later she added &quot;My life doesn&#39;t revolve around TV you know&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really had to bite my tongue as I laughed inside but it too renewed<br/>
my trust in the process.<br/>

LOL - reminds me of when my dh and I were in grad school - we were  <br/>
poor and had no tv. We spent 3 weeks housesitting - which meant we  <br/>
got to stay in a fantastic house. They had cable tv - and neither of  <br/>
us had ever had it. We watched EVERYTHING - Australian rules  <br/>
football, rugby, fishing, and game shows we&#39;d never imagined and ...  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845611560">Don&#39;t get me wrong I love TV and cable lol<br/>
<br/>
I am just not thrilled that since I moved in with my parents their<br/>
lifestyle choices have influence over us.<br/>
<br/>
And it felt like she was losing her creative spark by having<br/>
uninterrupted access to tv. Hence my statement that seeing her pull<br/>
herself away was reassuring.<br/>
<br/>
Right when my parnets got cable my dad went on day shift so he is gone<br/>
all day, she watches. And at night he has to go to bed early so she<br/>
watches. From the time she wakes up until she&#39;s ready for bed that&#39;s<br/>
where she is. With only 2-4 hours of interruption. Which she resents<br/>
as if the tv belongs to her lol sigh.<br/>
<br/>
My mother and I went through that @ my loving things she had no<br/>
respect for which makes sense now in a way it didn&#39;t then.<br/>
<br/>
I give my dd more space and freedom than I was given but not because I<br/>
love what she loves just because I understand some of the attractions<br/>
and the harmlessness of her being who she is tho it may not be who I am.<br/>
<br/>
What I appreciate about my mother now is she loves me despite our<br/>
differences. Not that she shares my interests. As a child I felt she<br/>
not only didn&#39;t share my interests but was condemning them and me due<br/>
to my interest in them.<br/>
<br/>
So I hope to give my daughter the gift of acceptance through out her<br/>
childhood not just when she gets out on her own.<br/>

ready to go or in a funk long before we had any chance to interact.<br/>

Usually I have a very positive attitude and am excited to be going out<br/>
even if we are running late (usually ;&gt; ) and even if we are headed<br/>
only to run errands as opposed to out to a park day or play date.<br/>
<br/>
In the same way she from her earliest days just loved to go out and<br/>
about. Which was good because due to us being a single parent family<br/>
anywhere I was going so was she.<br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden one day she announced she hated shopping and for weeks<br/>
would bummed out during the trip. Whining about when we could leave.<br/>
Upset by lines or any other little things that used to not be an issue<br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
She is still not the shopping diva she used to be.<br/>
<br/>
If she sensed a negative mood coming from me she would just tell me<br/>
not adopt it. That has been my experience with her. She just says what<br/>
she thinks she is feeling off people she is very perceptive and<br/>

I am attemptimg to address the whole list.<br/>
 There are several dynamics in this relationship that are specific to <br/>
the family&#39;s situation. <br/>
I can only offer suggestions based on my perspective , which is based <br/>
on my experiences.This may or may not be helpful to others. I like to <br/>
think it will be helpful.<br/>
That being said, I have found that watching my daughter play with her <br/>
dolls or stuffed animals and pets, has been very revealing. She works <br/>
out many issues in her play. <br/>
It&#39;s like a window into her psyche.<br/>
 I have been able to observe that she nurtures as she has been <br/>
nurtured. <br/>
So, pack the shoes, extra clothes, and  whatever else you need to feel <br/>
prepared , with a happy heart.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732529807">That is what we used to have @ puzzles etc in the same room, and dual<br/>
interaction between us almost all of the time.<br/>
<br/>
But now in my parents home and with dish on the tv in the room off the<br/>
kitchen which is the common room for all family interaction....<br/>
<br/>
Her computer is out there but not mine or our phone line.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about the puzzle story is I bought it while she was away on<br/>
visitation with her father and tho I imagined that she would join me<br/>
in being involved with putting it together I never expected that to be<br/>
a draw to pull her from her all but incessant viewing.<br/>
<br/>
She has smaller puzzles old and new that she can and does do on the<br/>
kitchen counter but there is no place to put the big 1000 peiece one<br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
When the dish was connected to the obscure tv in the sparcely<br/>
furnitured den and only utilized when a special movie or show was<br/>
coming on we could pull out the big puzzle but again that is something<br/>
I had done and never her.<br/>
<br/>
As close as we are sharing a room now in a house with my parents vs<br/>
when we had our own 2 bedroom apt. there are just new little things<br/>
here and there pulling us apart.<br/>
<br/>
I am working on that because I do think that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with us<br/>
these days making everything else worse than it was before.<br/>

It seems to me that you have received lots of input.  I don&#39;t know that you <br/>
can get insight from others.  You can only get words, then you decide what <br/>
those words mean to you and how you will react to them.<br/>

<br/>
Nobody has suggested that a parent never ask a child to bring something <br/>
along.  However, it is pushing if you ask and she doesn&#39;t want to but you <br/>
still think SHE SHOULD DO IT and insist that she does it or make her feel <br/>
bad if she doesn&#39;t.<br/>

Many people have given lots of ideas for how to make a child&#39;s *being warm* <br/>
(or having shoes) easier and more convenient for the parent.<br/>

It sounds that you&#39;re saying you WERE taking her things for her.  If  <br/>

Very often it&#39;s not behavior that needs to change so much as  <br/>
attitude.  But once the attitude and viewpoint changes, the behavior  <br/>
becomes easier, and the relationships become better.<br/>

<br/>
That sort of discussion and question (&quot;Why are you resisting me?&quot;)  <br/>
will make people ashamed, and will not improve relationships.<br/>

If you start to decide by which principles you want to live, that  <br/>
will be a better move than deciding to change your behavior without  <br/>

thought what does it mean when a baby cries?<br/>
<br/>
Something is wrong. Just because whomever hears it doesn&#39;t know what<br/>
does not mean the child is crying for no reason and the proper<br/>
response is love and care. After addressing every need you know of you<br/>
still just have to hold them and love them.<br/>
<br/>
Being right about the fact that nothing is wrong that you can figure<br/>
out will not stop the crying. Neither will getting mad etc.<br/>

being ordered to do something. I&#39;d guess that your daughter is not  <br/>
liking the feeling of being ordered around (told what to do). Or,  <br/>
maybe she&#39;s kind of embarrassed to have to be reminded and her  <br/>
response is to get angry and to deny that you&#39;re right. Maybe being  <br/>
&quot;right&quot; is a big deal in her mind - maybe she&#39;s a perfectionistic  <br/>
person who gets upset when she doesn&#39;t remember everything, all the  <br/>
time. Maybe she thinks you&#39;re disappointed in her - maybe she&#39;s  <br/>
right? Maybe she&#39;s just getting some hormonal changes and that causes  <br/>
her to be more emotional than she has been in the past and you are  <br/>
over-reacting to that.  Sometimes people with just one child are  <br/>
simply looking too hard at them - seeing normal small variations in  <br/>
behavior, as the child goes through life, as having more significance  <br/>
than they really have - and sometimes taking things too personally. I  <br/>
do get a sense of you making a mountain out of a molehill on this issue.<br/>
<br/>
No matter which explanation is correct - one of the above or some  <br/>
other explanation - the best response is probably what you came up  <br/>
with yourself - for you to lighten up and just continue to be helpful  <br/>
and NOT make a big deal out of any of this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If your relationship is antagonistic, as it seems to be from some of  <br/>
the things you have written, then she will not be doing things for  <br/>
herself, she will be doing things for you.  And the only way she can  <br/>
win is to NOT do what you want.<br/>
<br/>
Change your stance and alignment to her so that you are side by side  <br/>
instead of faciing off.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t ask her or tell her to do anything.  Do things for your team,  <br/>
for you and for her.  And then she will start to do things for your  <br/>
team too, AFTER she trusts you, and that will take a while.<br/>

-=-What I was thinking and didn&#39;t share with this list because I know it<br/>
goes against policy etc. was &quot;I am right she is acting crazy and there<br/>
is no need for me to....&quot; but going all the way back to basic I<br/>
thought what does it mean when a baby cries?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re right, I don&#39;t think she is acting crazy, I  <br/>
think you&#39;re creating and maintaining a difficult relationship when  <br/>
you could more easily take just a little of the TON of good advice  <br/>
people are offering and make your lives better today.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It seems like babyish behavior to me that my daughter is exhibiting<br/>
but the answer is still my love and care.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
The onus is on you to be the more mature partner, always.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480001360">The hilarious thing about reading this list is it is the ONLY place<br/>
where people keep trying to tell me how old my daughter is as if I am<br/>
expecting too much from her.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone who meets her and us understands much differently that it is<br/>
she who puts the not at all subtle pressure on others to treat her<br/>
more like an older child if not an adult.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541572609">But I don&#39;t recall entering into or setting us up in a power struggle<br/>
that&#39;s the problem had that been my intent I could be sitting back<br/>
content.<br/>
<br/>
Yes puberty is a factor in all that is going on! <br/>
<br/>
Indeed a bit of gifted perfectionism could be at play....but the<br/>
interesting thing about that was when puberty started to physically<br/>
manifest what I clearly saw was how what I could now identify as mood<br/>
swings have always been a part of her personality.<br/>
<br/>
All that being said writing about this in a place where I am not known<br/>
and emotionally supported has given me the perspective I needed. Not<br/>
always to mirror back the party line but still getting me back to center.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been through alot losing our job, home, car/mobility, and tho so<br/>
much I have tried to let our lives stay the same and true to what I<br/>
believe is best for us things have changed. In my coping and her<br/>
coping we were starting to disconnect.<br/>
<br/>
And she was doing what I can see I have done &quot;telling me what she<br/>
doesn&#39;t like about what I am doing&quot; instead of asking me for what she<br/>
wants and needs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I started focussing on the little things it was that<br/>
with nothing else in our life, no friends, no outtings, no job, there<br/>
were no distractions from the little things. If we aren&#39;t completely<br/>
in tune it feels like sand paper rubbing us both the wrong way.<br/>
<br/>
I have never been a full time hands on mom where we do everything<br/>
together for the bulk of the day. We did things around each other and<br/>
came together for projects, activities, events etc. So when in our<br/>
grief and depression we started going off in our own directions to<br/>
cope it seemed that would be ok.<br/>
<br/>
But indeed it is not.<br/>
<br/>
So we are making changes! It&#39;s really rather simple and it makes<br/>
perfect sense.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all<br/>
