<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Even before we had kids, Keith and I have always said &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank <br/>
&gt; you&quot; to the people around us.  When people give my kids gifts, they tend <br/>
&gt; toward <br/>
&gt; effusion (&quot;This is so cool!  Thanks!  Let&#39;s go try it out right now!&quot;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I like to get thank you notes from adults, and am usually surprised <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; grateful for them (instead of thinking &quot;Yeah, I earned this, and it&#39;s about <br/>
&gt; time,&quot; as some people seem to be about them), when I get one from a child I <br/>
&gt; always hope it didn&#39;t come under pressure and threat, because then I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; afraid <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve spent some time thinking negatively about me and the gift, and that <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; might keep them from seeing writing as a fun thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For kids who write pretty well and who really like the person they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; writing <br/>
&gt; too, some of those objections would fall.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe if they really like the person they&#39;re writing to too, or to whom <br/>
they&#39;re writing also...<br/>

Ah never mind.  Probably nobody noticed but me and a couple of people who <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This has always been true in our home also. I did ask my son to write two <br/>
thank you&#39;s yesterday to two sets of grandparents that always send multiple gifts <br/>
to the children and live many states away.  He&#39;s 10 and wrote a short note to <br/>
each talking about a couple of his favorite gifts.  I asked him to change <br/>
&quot;crismas&quot; to &quot;Christmas&quot; in one letter because the one grandmother is very <br/>
religious and was a 1st grade teacher. Sometimes, it&#39;s important to take the time <br/>
for little things just because we love and honor someone.  He was fine with it <br/>
and I addressed the envelopes and put in pictures of him taken on Christmas <br/>
morning.   It will mean so much to them all because they very seldom get to see <br/>
the children. However, if he had really not wanted to do it, I would not have <br/>
insisted.<br/>
<br/>
I did mention some of the ideas about thank you notes from this list and he <br/>
loved the lego idea.  He then decided it would be fun to do a claymation thank <br/>
you and spent part of the evening deciding how he would do that.  My new view <br/>
on thank you notes (besides the two that I helped him send out) is that it is <br/>
optional. However, I have left the thank you cards out on the table while I <br/>
worked on them and I noticed that my 14 year old daughter has written some. <br/>
Maybe, he&#39;ll follow up on his Claymation idea.  Leaving the clay out now..:-)<br/>

I never notice when other people do it, but my own come glaring out at me<br/>
with a big flashing &quot;moron&quot; sign.   Why aren&#39;t they glaring before I hit<br/>
