&lt;&lt; You know what? That concept of &quot;succeeding&quot; in life -- is the cause of <br/>
SO much unhappiness and needless worry. Life isn&#39;t a contest or a <br/>
project you can win or succeed at - it is an experience. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And the definition of success changes slowly and surely.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just finished reading Sense and Sensibility, a two-hundred year old <br/>
novel, which can&#39;t help but be moralistic and steeped in the cultural expectations <br/>
of the time.<br/>
<br/>
The writing was irritating.   And I thought it would never end, when suddenly <br/>
last night it ended, and I discovered that the last &lt;1/3 of the book was <br/>
background, source material, reviews from when the book was new, etc.   There were <br/>
mini-sermons there, and instructional stories (I read one from The Parents <br/>
Companion ?) and though there was a definite idea of success, it wasn&#39;t today&#39;s. <br/>
 It was as oppressive and as difficult to achieve, but just different.<br/>
<br/>
There were times in the Middle Ages when, much as in India with the caste <br/>
system, success was accepting your lot in life gratefully and piously, because <br/>
God knew what he was doing, and to wish for more or different was blasphemous <br/>
and ungrateful.<br/>
<br/>
Now we&#39;re in a culture where accepting less than everything is considered by <br/>
some to be lazy and a sign of low intelligence.   If someone swims but doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to compete, that&#39;s a flaw.  If someone competes but doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
trade up for a better coach and national competition, must be something wrong with <br/>
her.  If someone&#39;s in a rock band and is happy to play locally and go home <br/>
every night, he has no passion or drive or confidence.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re stuck there.   But we don&#39;t have to let it sweep us away in its waves <br/>
of prl homelife) and failure for thousands.   &quot;Settling&quot; has become a bad word.<br/>
<br/>
So if we&#39;re going to discuss and maybe even live by a philosophy that <br/>
involves stepping off those conveyor belts, we need to consider our own definitions <br/>
of success.   Some unschoolers do say &quot;I&#39;d like to make sure he could slip <br/>
right back into school without trouble if he needed to.&quot;   That&#39;s not a viable <br/>
goal, really.  There are a few kids with remarkably good handwriting and early <br/>
reading who could probably do it!  There are more who wouldn&#39;t last a day <br/>
without balking at the doofy assignments and their lack of freedom to go take a leak <br/>
without a written permit.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting topic, but not an easy topic.  <br/>
<br/>
At this snapshot moment I feel a sense of success because Kirby is trusted <br/>
and trustworthy and he&#39;s not afraid of other people, neither adults nor kids, <br/>
not authority figures or crazy homeless guys who put their arm around him and <br/>
feel his hair admiringly. (Well there was only one of the latter, but I already <br/>
had my sentence structure going with plurals.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
