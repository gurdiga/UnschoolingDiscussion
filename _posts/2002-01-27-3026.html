<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623471262"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I do think it&#39;s important that people trying to &quot;get&quot; unschooling <br/>
&gt; understand that it has to do with who is making the choices, kids or <br/>
&gt; parents, and that it has to do with trusting kids to make good choices.  If <br/>
&gt; it isn&#39;t at least that, then why not just throw the word away <br/>
&gt; completely?  If a word means whatever the speaker (or writer) wants it to <br/>
&gt; mean, then it doesn&#39;t mean anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  And I think that most informed people agree more or less on<br/>
the definition of unschooling.  However, I also think that people differ<br/>
widely on the details of unschooling.  For example, can you suggest<br/>
courses of study, books, or activities?  Leave interesting material<br/>
lying around?  Insist that children finish a project or class they&#39;ve<br/>
chosen and already started?  Allow children to take classes in the first<br/>
place?  I&#39;m not looking for a debate on any of these topics, but I&#39;d bet<br/>
you&#39;d get different answers from different people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is no definitive inerpretation of unschooling but some of the things<br/>
&gt; I have read on unschooling lists in the past may it clear to me that the<br/>
&gt; person really hasn&#39;t grasped the concept of unschooling.  A good analogy<br/>
&gt; is if someone claimed to be a vegetarian but they ate meat on weekends or<br/>
&gt; when they weren&#39;t home.  The above person certainly has vegetarian tendencies<br/>
&gt; but IMO they aren&#39;t a vegetarian.  I have read/heard similar things from<br/>
&gt; supposed unschooling parents in the past. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obviously, I was not privy to the discussions in question.  I do think<br/>
it&#39;s important to explain unschooling to people and help them see that<br/>
it is a viable option.  I agree that it would have been a disservice to<br/>
simply say &#39;whatever works for you&#39; in this context.  I guess I only got<br/>
half the story.<br/>

to support our kids&#39; interests and DON&#39;T they learn the basics through that?<br/>
<br/>
But I know what you mean -- people find out their kids are interested in <br/>
dinosaurs and, before the poor kids know what hit them, they&#39;re doing <br/>
&quot;dinosaur math&quot; such as, &quot;If you saw twelve dinosaurs and three ran away, how <br/>
many dinosaurs....&quot; ICK!!!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do we have to know what single vocation we want to do by a particular age?   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What about people that have several vocations in a lifetime.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had jobs in several different fields and I plan to go to Massage <br/>
&gt; Therapy <br/>
&gt; school next year.  Should I have figured this out a long time ago? At age <br/>
&gt; 18 <br/>
&gt; when I was going to the Int&#39;l. Air Academy? <br/>
&gt; Why?<br/>
&gt; All of the work experience I&#39;ve had up till today has been valuable..just <br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; the time I&#39;ve spent not working, running my own business or taking classes.<br/>
&gt; Why does life have to be looked at in such a small box? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So right!<br/>
<br/>
I was going to be a veterinarian from the time I was five years old. I took <br/>
all the higher math and science classes in high school: algebra I & II, <br/>
geometry, calculus, trig, biology, chemistry I & II, physics (what FUN! ---I <br/>
loved that!), and I SUFFERED through every one (except physics). I took 5 <br/>
(COUNT THEM, FIVE) years of Latin (although I truly loved that) as well as 2 <br/>
of Spanish (way too easy). <br/>
<br/>
College was the same way---all those science courses. My whole life revolved <br/>
around<br/>
pre-vet. Now keep in mind that my LOVE was English and other languages, but I <br/>
wanted to be a vet. I was GOING to be a vet.<br/>
<br/>
By my junior year, I realized that I really HATED all those science courses <br/>
and that I would be looking at ugly, sick dogs (owned by people who really <br/>
didn&#39;t want to pay) all day long. NOT a way to spend the rest of my life. At <br/>
the same time, I was gobbling up all those language courses and spent my <br/>
junior year in Germany and Austria soaking up another language and its <br/>
culture. HEAVEN!<br/>
<br/>
So what have I done? (without that precious degree, BTW----I dropped out!) <br/>
Opened and managed a provencial French restaurant, ridden race horses, owned <br/>
a tack shop, owned four successful dog grooming shops, and now I&#39;m a MEAN <br/>
gardener, a dog show judge, and a coordinator for an unschooling conference <br/>
in October!&lt;g&gt;.  Not bragging, just saying that I did these things AS I got <br/>
interested in them. I would never have thought I&#39;d ever garden (BORING!) or <br/>
host a conference as a teenager. I will NEVER have another retail business or <br/>
ride racehorses again! I&#39;m moving on, changing. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m SOOO glad I&#39;m not a vet. Two of my very good friends are. It&#39;s a rough <br/>
life. Not for me. I don&#39;t think I &quot;failed&quot; by not becoming a vet. I <br/>
&quot;succeeded&quot; in the things I was interested in AT THE TIME. I&#39;ll let you know <br/>
what I&#39;m doing in 5 years---probably something completely different!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s so much time to experiment, quit, and try something else. Don&#39;t gear <br/>
EVERYTHING towards being a vet (or anything else). Life&#39;s a journey. Live for <br/>
today: if you&#39;re constantly thinking about what your children will be when <br/>
they&#39;re GROWN, you&#39;ll MISS who they ARE, NOW.<br/>

vet tech at our animals&#39; doctor.  &quot;Why would you want to do that?&quot; I think<br/>
were her exact words &lt;g&gt;  Dd watches LOTS of Animal Planet shows, and was<br/>
tempted by Emergency Vets.  I&#39;ve suggested (joking at first, but who knows?)<br/>
she might look into police work, training and working K9 patrols, mounted<br/>
police, search and rescue, etc.<br/>

I&#39;ve never yet met a really slothful unschooling family.  We&#39;re the worst I <br/>

I have a big story I didn&#39;t have time to tell her, mid-May and I don&#39;t have <br/>

It&#39;s about alternative education/homeschooling.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or maybe read a book describing unschooling, but<br/>
really doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I recently picked up a book at the library that looked<br/>
interesting.  I don&#39;t get to browse much at the<br/>
library (I&#39;m busy reading to the kids) so I checked it<br/>
out to look through it at home.  It is called<br/>
&quot;Creative Home Schooling for Gifted Children: A<br/>
resource guide&quot; by Lisa Rivero.  {I have a problem<br/>
with the title, but she does explain her reasoning in<br/>
the intro.)<br/>
<br/>
So at home, I flipped through it and was pleasantly<br/>
surprised that she had included unschooling in her<br/>
book.  So of course, I started there &lt;bg&gt;. <br/>
Unfortunately, she adds to the confusion about what<br/>
unschooling is.  She has some statements that I like<br/>
and agree with, but then she mixes it up with<br/>
school-at-home statements which negate the whole<br/>
point.  I feel like using my black marker and red pen<br/>
to make corrections LOL.  Here are a few quotes (good<br/>
& bad):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are nearly as many definitions of unschooling<br/>
as there are people who consider themselves<br/>
unschoolers.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Perhaps most importantly, unschoolers believe that<br/>
children will learn what they need to learn if allowed<br/>
to seek answers to their own questions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  But then...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some families use unschooling for subjects in which<br/>
their children are strongly motivated and then use<br/>
more traditional approaches for other subjects.  Some<br/>
families practice unschooling during the summer,<br/>
effectively making for a year-round education.  Other<br/>
families find that unschooling is the perfect match<br/>
for young children, but that older children prefer<br/>
more formal educational approaches.  Summer offers a<br/>
good time to experiment with self-directed<br/>
learning...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She has 4 moms who describe in a paragraph or two how<br/>
unschooling works.  Some of it is good, but then they<br/>
say things like &quot;...many of us put a lot of effort<br/>

NOT.<br/>

Great!  Our course in advanced logic is trying to figure out the details<br/>
of the rules to our Buffy board game.  It&#39;s challenging our powers of deduction.<br/>

And I learned a lot about literary criticism reading lengthy discussions<br/>

only in that fact that they both have consistently excellent writing.<br/>

I would strongly suggest that any new Buffy watchers rent the seasons and<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m also a price balker.  And I think I would be muttering under my<br/>
breath if people referenced the wrong episodes.  I&#39;m the nittiest of<br/>
nitpickers on this topic.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, it&#39;s hard to sell me any books on unschooling or<br/>
homeschooling when I can get so much great information on the internet<br/>
for free.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the interesting discursive discussions. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  We had the Buffy tapes out yesterday and today because my son wanted<br/>
to see &quot;the funny episode where Harmony has minions&quot;  (5-2 The Real Me).<br/>
 It was good fun and reminded me of what the show was like when Buffy<br/>
herself was still cheerful.<br/>
<br/>
PPS  I&#39;ve been thinking about how to compare Buffy to other TV shows. <br/>
Short of cheating and saying that it&#39;s like Angel and Firefly, I would<br/>
say it&#39;s a little bit like a live-action Simpsons with the addition of<br/>
magic, martial arts and dark sexual undertones.  (If you can imagine<br/>
that.)  It&#39;s just as hard to define as unschooling!  But you&#39;ve got to<br/>
love a show where the high school principal gets eaten by a big giant<br/>
snake. &lt;g&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198166280">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
After months of lurking I am finally writing my intro.  Partially<br/>
because it&#39;s been so long, and also because I am in need of some<br/>
assistance.  I have been lurking on this list and the unschooling list<br/>
for months.  I am the mom of 3 wonderful kids: Stanzi, who is 5, Robby,<br/>
who is 3, and Gabbi who is 1.  As a family we have often discovered that<br/>
there are names for the things that we do in learning and parenting,<br/>
even after we&#39;ve been doing them for a while without knowing it.  We<br/>
were doing attachment parenting before we realized it had a name.  We<br/>
also realized very early on that our parenting style naturally<br/>
translated into a homeschooling environment.  We knew right away that we<br/>
would never try to reproduce school at home, but had no idea of the<br/>
variety of approaches to homeschooling that exist.  We discovered the<br/>
concept of unschooling a couple of years ago and I was able to attend<br/>
Sandra&#39;s workshop at the HSC conference in CA last year.  I had one of<br/>
those moments where you know that something is a good fit, and since<br/>
then we have never doubted that unschooling was the direction we wanted<br/>
to take.  These lists have been wonderful at helping me understand<br/>
unschooling as a lifestyle, rather than just a style of learning.  I<br/>
have learned so much about things I had never even thought about before,<br/>
and I love how these discussions have challenged my parenting in so many<br/>
ways.  My husband and I have grown so much in the past year as we have<br/>
started questioning so much of what we do, and why we do it.<br/>
So, that&#39;s the intro.  My question is this: We have belonged to our<br/>
local homeschooling group since its inception a couple of years ago.  It<br/>
is an inclusive group which was the first of its kind in our very<br/>
conservative community.  Up until recently we were the only unschooling<br/>
family in our group.  But, recently a few other moms have expressed<br/>
interest in unschooling.  So, I thought it would be fun to have a get<br/>
together to discuss where we were at in each of our unschooling<br/>
journeys, and maybe read a book together.  I posted the idea to our list<br/>
and I have had such a tremendous response I was a little surprised.  So<br/>
my question is, what now?  For the most part these are families that<br/>
know almost nothing about unschooling, or they think they do, but seem<br/>
to have a lot of misconceptions about it :-)  Out of 10 families there<br/>
may be one or two that actually come close to really getting it.  One<br/>
mom even posted that she wanted to bring her husband because she was<br/>
unschooling her kids, and her husband didn&#39;t understand it. So, she<br/>
thought bringing him would help so maybe we could explain it to him.<br/>
Many of the families seem to have the idea that whatever method one<br/>
uses, whether curriculum or anything else, is considered unschooling as<br/>
long as the kids are happy with it.  I would sure appreciate your advice<br/>
on possible formats for a get together of this kind and maybe<br/>
suggestions on books we should start with.  Initially, I thought a few<br/>
of us would read some of Holt&#39;s work together (mostly because I would<br/>
like to read some more of that).   However, I am thinking that the<br/>
Unschooling Handbook might be more appropriate, given the diversity of<br/>
the group. Thanks in advance for the input!<br/>

<br/>
Kinda the opposite of songwriting, where songwriters tend to write songs <br/>
after they break up, not when the relationship is so happy that they&#39;re out and <br/>
about doing cool stuff.  We don&#39;t get songs about &quot;We went to the amusement park <br/>
and the sky was like magic and we had a great lunch!&quot;  We get &quot;I loved her so <br/>
much and now I hurt deep down and I&#39;ll never love again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s good to appreciate a topic and medium which tend toward the good <br/>
days!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you a lethargic day, but it will be boring, and just make the list <br/>
long for no good purpose.  It will let you know why cooks&#39; lists don&#39;t go into <br/>
detail about why and how things burn, or how someone left the house and <br/>
forgot there was bread rising until she found it the next afternoon.  Some things <br/>
aren&#39;t worth writing.  And the bad thing about lists like this is you can&#39;t <br/>
stop me partway through with expressions of excrutiating boredom, or coughing, <br/>
shuffling and looking at watches.  Here I go.  If you don&#39;t read it you might <br/>
miss something good.  Probably not, though.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday (Sunday) the plan had been that Keith and I would pick Holly up <br/>
from an overnight party far away (25 miles) at 10:00 a.m.  We got a call that the <br/>
mom of the party girl (an idiot, well known to me for many years, a former <br/>
SCA student, one of the few I ever fired from apprenticeship) that she was <br/>
bringing them into town to be picked up.  (Well, they&#39;re &quot;in town&quot; legally, but in <br/>
new houses way on the dusty mesa where roads aren&#39;t all finished.)<br/>
<br/>
Keith said he would just go, and I could stay home.  COOL!<br/>
<br/>
The reason was this:  She had taken them to her ex-boyfriend&#39;s house, only <br/>
about four miles from here.  Only she didn&#39;t tell him she was going to do it.  <br/>
She just called him a 10:15 (woke him up) to say she had told people to pick <br/>
their kids up (only three families, but that&#39;s three more than he had agreed to) <br/>
and she was going to be half an hour late.<br/>
<br/>
So because it was SO supremely typically socially twisted and incompetent, I <br/>
didn&#39;t ask any more.  He got up to greet people and say the kids would be <br/>
there in a while.<br/>
<br/>
Keith had told Holly that she could go with him to fighter practice, and she <br/>
could take Kristy.  On the way home he told her he really REALLY didn&#39;t want <br/>
to go, sorry.  Holly probably said &quot;that&#39;s okay,&quot; but she came and sat in my <br/>
lap like a tired, sad lump.  I rocked her and kissed her head and stroked her <br/>
hair (what&#39;s left of it--she shaved off even more of the haircut you can see at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/hollyhair">http://sandradodd.com/hollyhair</a><br/>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/hollyhair&quot;">http://sandradodd.com/hollyhair&quot;</a>&gt;Holly&#39;s April 2003 Haircut&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
and is doing it herself now, not directing me where to cut and what to shave).<br/>
<br/>
I was asking her about the night before and she was giving single word <br/>
answers, and when I asked if she was going to the park soon, she started crying and <br/>
said &quot;Dad isn&#39;t going and he won&#39;t take me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Brett, another homeschooled teen who&#39;s also in the SCA of late, had just <br/>
arrived to take Kirby, who was still in bed at 11:15.  I had gone to check to see <br/>
if he wanted to go with Brett but he said no, he really didn&#39;t feel like it.  <br/>
I reminded him it was his last chance for two more weeks, because he works the <br/>
next two Sundays.  He said that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
So Brett had room in his truck.  Kristy&#39;s his second cousin and lives where <br/>
he used to live, so it&#39;s not like he had to say &quot;Holly and who?&quot;  He said okay, <br/>
he&#39;d take them.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wasn&#39;t having a slothful day, but the rest of us were.<br/>
<br/>
Marty had a police academy week last week, and was really needing sloth, as <br/>
we both woke up promptly at 6:30ish (exactly, I know) and met, up and dressed, <br/>
in the den at 7:00, each of us having thought &quot;Well at least [Mom/Mart] can <br/>
sleep late&quot; and then been up fairly late Saturday anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But Marty was up by 10:00 or so, playing with some new cards he got at <br/>
Walmart the day  before  for a game.  (Darn it, this part gets interesting. But the <br/>
interesting part is stuff from Saturday, so nevermind for now.)<br/>
<br/>
I made a scrambled egg sandwich for Marty and went to ask Keith if he wanted <br/>
one (not because I planned ahead, but because there were leftovers).  He said <br/>
sure.  I sat with them while they ate. <br/>
<br/>
Keith was working on a wooden bench, kinda based on one I bought for $4 at a <br/>
St. Vincent de Paul store in 1976 or so.  Wendy had made a copy of it when she <br/>
first started woodworking.  Keith was making a wider put-together/take-apart <br/>
version with a cut-out crosspiece, some slide-in dove-tail, some notches here <br/>
and there.  That&#39;s why he hadn&#39;t wanted to go to fighter practice.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty was restless and bored and I asked if he wanted to go to Hollywood <br/>
Video and rent something.  But Sundays, the shelves are relativesly bare.  He said <br/>
that&#39;s how he discovered the Wild Arms series, though, was &quot;renting some <br/>
choad game&quot; and liking it.  So we walked over, out the back gate.  My leg is well <br/>
enough to walk across the dirt now instead of the longer way down the alley <br/>
and on the pavement. <br/>
<br/>
I looked at DVDs and nothing popped out at me (and later I remembered the <br/>
three I had told Kirby I would rent and watch with him, but this IS a tale of a <br/>
lame day).  Marty got a game and Master of Disguise.  Holly had seen it but <br/>
none of the rest of us had.<br/>
<br/>
Got back.  Kirby was awake, in a crummy t-shirt and white boxer shorts.  He <br/>
never did get further dressed all day.  Except for the walk to Hollywood Video, <br/>
which we can see fully from our back yard, Marty, Kirby and I stayed home all <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby watched Master of Disguise.  I was in the next room (here at <br/>
the computer) trying to play Neopets, but the site kept disappearing on me, <br/>
and so I just worked on adding a couple of things to my webpages.  Put something <br/>
else on the main spanking page, and added some links at the bottom of <br/>
deschooling, because I wanted to find Pattie Donahue-Krueger&#39;s (having come across it <br/>
in a pile of old homeschooling publications I found Friday looking for a poem <br/>
about Keith that had been published in an SCA newsletter 20 years ago).  Hers <br/>
isn&#39;t online and I couldn&#39;t find her e-mail address.  (Lame time spent fairly <br/>
fruitlessly.)<br/>
<br/>
Keith met us at the gate when we were on the way back from Hollywood Video.  <br/>
I said &quot;Marty, didn&#39;t you ask Keith if he had wanted to go with us?&quot;  &quot;No, I <br/>
forgot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He wanted me to show him the finished bench.  I sat on it gingerly.  It was <br/>
workable, and would have worked better in sand than on concrete, but in no case <br/>
was it going to work longer than a couple of hours.  He sat on it with me.  I <br/>
said if we rock back and forth at all, it&#39;s going to break.  He said it might <br/>
not.  I said I was afraid of falling, and maybe he could wedge the legs apart <br/>
where it was loose.  <br/>
<br/>
We put it upside down on the saw table. I showed him where  I thought wedges <br/>
and pegs might make it strong enough to last a while (and I was thinking &quot;a <br/>
day or two instead of an hour or two&quot; but I didn&#39;t say it).  He was still <br/>
hopeful.  He put in a couple of really thin wedges and it did make it tighter, but <br/>
the design was still unstable.  He hit a wedge in with his hand and broke off a <br/>
little piece of wood on the outside of a notch.  At least it was safely on a <br/>
workbench when it broke.  <br/>
<br/>
I apologized for being the harbinger of technicalities.   I said any two <br/>
teens in our camp would wiggle while they sat and there was just too much torque <br/>
and leverage involved for it NOT to break.  But the cross piece was sure purty, <br/>
and maybe if he glued and pegged the whole thing together it would be a great <br/>
bench!  &quot;But then it won&#39;t break down to carry,&quot; he said.  &quot;Yeah, but then <br/>
people can use it.  Sorry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Keith went to the fighter practice park to check on Holly, to see if she <br/>
wanted to come back earlier than Brett.  She didn&#39;t, so he came back.  (That&#39;s <br/>
about five miles another direction than he&#39;d gone that morning.)<br/>
<br/>
I offered to go to the store to buy and make something for dinner.  I asked <br/>
the boys if there was anything I could make in an hour or less that they had <br/>
not had for a while.  Neither of them could thing of anything, and were happy to <br/>
just sit and watch that movie.<br/>
<br/>
I personally was not feeling well, and spent much of the afternoon on <br/>
whichever toilet was nearest.<br/>
<br/>
I went to tell Keith I had no dinner plan and didn&#39;t really want one.  He <br/>
asked if we had macaroni or egg noodles.  I said both.  So he decided he would <br/>
make up a pot of beef, onion, noodles and sauce so he could take some for lunch <br/>
this week, and I offered to help but he was feeling energetic (and doesn&#39;t <br/>
like to share the kitchen) so that was fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Turned out we didn&#39;t have enough of either noodles or macaroni to satisfy his <br/>
plan, but he made do.  He chopped up pre-made frozen meatballs for the meat <br/>
instead of messing with onions and raw beef.<br/>
<br/>
Brett called to ask if Holly could go to Denny&#39;s with another mom and her two <br/>
kids.  I don&#39;t trust that mom and I don&#39;t like her two kids, but I wasn&#39;t <br/>
going.  &quot;Is Govanen going?&quot; I asked (the woman&#39;s boyfriend, who is trustworthy <br/>
and intelligent outside his inexplicable involvement with the girlfriend), and <br/>
assured Govanen would be there, I said yes.  I&#39;ve known him for ten years.  His <br/>
parents were Santa Fe buddhist hippes.  He lived in a TP in Guatemala or some <br/>
such part of the time he was little, and his dad ended up being prominent in <br/>
permanent-building Santa Fe Buddhism eventually.  <br/>
<br/>
So Holly and Kristy weren&#39;t home for another hour and a half.  Holly had a <br/>
VERY busy day. The rest of us kinda grubbed around in what we slept in.  When <br/>
the movie ended, Marty and Kirby went up to Kirby&#39;s room, where Marty played the <br/>
newly rented lame game (and liked it) while Kirby painted miniatures.    <br/>
Later Marty got online on my computer while Kirby played the video game.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody learned anything flashy and new, that I know of.  While looking for <br/>
Pattie&#39;s address, I ran across something (old) from Monica Molinar in Alaska and <br/>
thought maybe I could find her online.  She was on the old AOL boards and <br/>
used to send out &quot;the unschooling barrage&quot; because it was the days before easy <br/>
webpages, and when people wondered, we sent a batch of e-mails.  She was easy to <br/>
find because she&#39;s a realtor in North Pole, and doing church music.  Two <br/>
webpages.  She responded within about five minutes of me e-mailing her.  They&#39;re <br/>
still homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and Marty went to sleep fairly early.  Holly asked me to make some food <br/>
for her while she was in the shower.   On the way out to get something out of <br/>
the garage for Holly&#39;s dinner, I was thinking &quot;How nice, it&#39;s just our <br/>
family, none missing and no extras.&quot; Then I saw Brett&#39;s truck out front.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out Brett was asleep on Kirby&#39;s bed.  He didn&#39;t really know he was.  <br/>
<br/>
I fed Holly a chicken/rice Lean Cuisine thing, and a bowl of macaroni <br/>
(Keith&#39;s extra, unspiced) with melted colby cheese on it, and sat with her while she <br/>
ate almost all of that.<br/>
<br/>
I went to check on the plan about Brett getting to work at 8:00 a.m. in a <br/>
town 40 miles away, and  ended up watching an episode of Third Rock from the Sun <br/>
in his room while he was running five different instant message conversations <br/>
on his computer.   Then I helped Holly straighten up her room and tucked her <br/>
in, and I went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to write any more lame days.  We have them. And honestly, <br/>
they&#39;re some of my favorite days.  I&#39;ve always had a pretty exciting life and those <br/>
days when the answer to &quot;what&#39;d you do today?&quot; is &quot;nothing&quot; are some of the <br/>
BEST days.<br/>

<br/>
My unschooling faith has been wavering recently, but I had a reassuring<br/>
discussion with my dh who agreed with me that our son seems to learn<br/>
best from videos, games and taking walks.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m always looking for more movie recommendations.  What have you<br/>
all enjoyed recently?  Recently my son decided that he liked the Cadfael<br/>
episode that I was watching.  (And the little voice says &quot;Yay! <br/>
Historical! and Herbal, too!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931568550">The game I mentioned in the lazy Sunday thing would have led back to this <br/>
story:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday when Marty and I were up early we saw THREE  FOX cartoons that were <br/>
particularly interesting to us.  I sat and watched too.  I had run up to <br/>
Kirby&#39;s room and stuck in a tape I knew we could tape over, because the first one <br/>
had 20 minutes left, and then didn&#39;t go turn it off, because it would have <br/>
woken him up again, but we were glad.<br/>
<br/>
The first was the new Ninja Turtle series.  It was a story that was only in <br/>
storybook, never animated, the first go-round.  I recognized it because I read <br/>
that storybook to Kirby LOTS of times.  It had a character named Kirby, who <br/>
had a magic crystal and if he tied it to his pencil, what he drew came alive.  <br/>
He and Donatello end up in another dimension, and there&#39;s a battle which is won <br/>
by changing drawings of Donatello and of the badguys.  The portal starts to <br/>
close and Donatello barely makes it back, but Kirby is trapped on the other <br/>
side, and all Donatello has of him is a drawing of himself.<br/>
<br/>
The second I recognized it I went to tape it on Kirby&#39;s VCR which works <br/>
better than mine.<br/>
<br/>
After that (maybe not RIGHT after) was a show Marty recognized from a card <br/>
game he has seen at Walmart next to Neopets stuff.  It&#39;s some kind of <br/>
interstellar wrestling federation show.  Silly, but tons of puns and food characters.  <br/>
Lots of jokes Marty appeciated because he likes wrestling and Japanese <br/>
animation, and there were plays on particular other games/series.  <br/>
<br/>
Then even MORE interesting was another show with food characters.  Friday, <br/>
Holly had been looking for Kirby&#39;s old sticker collection in his closet.  She <br/>
went through every box looking and finally found them, but in the process she <br/>
came across a spiral notebook in which he had done food characters, drawn their <br/>
weapons and had me write down descriptions and stats and stuff for them.  She <br/>
got it out and read through the whole thing, and said she wished she had <br/>
someone to do something like that with, because she remembered when Kirby and Marty <br/>
were making their food fighters.  And she wondered if Marty still had his <br/>
notebook too.  That was Friday. <br/>
<br/>
Saturday MORNING Marty and I were the only two up, this food-fighter show <br/>
came on, and I asked him whether he still had his notebook.  He said yes, walked <br/>
ten steps, picked it up, and handed it to me.   WOW.  I said &quot;They stole ALL <br/>
your ideas!&quot;  It was really a great bit of  synchronicity.  AND best of all, <br/>
the tape was still running in Kirby&#39;s room.  We thought.  <br/>
<br/>
No, he had gotten up and wound that tape back to see what had been so <br/>
important for me to record.  &lt;g&gt;  He was happily watching a Ninja Turtles story he <br/>
knew very well, but had never seen animated until then.<br/>
<br/>
So Marty and Holly and I went to Walmart where he bought a couple of card <br/>
packs for  that wrestling game.  The kids are all asleep so I can&#39;t ask more.  <br/>
Later that night, he and Brett went back to Walmart and bought more so they <br/>
could learn to play it.<br/>
