<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033798456">One last post about this.<br/>
<br/>
I was with a group of 7-8 year olds at a camp last week as a counselor. <br/>
We are the only homeschool family I know at that camp who has an <br/>
unlimited TV policy. I was struck my my dd&#39;s vocabulary in that <br/>
context. She was witty, articulate, and often savvy to what the <br/>
counselor&#39;s were about, especially when compared to her peers. She <br/>
repeatedly cracked up all up.<br/>
<br/>
Now perhaps she might have been that way just from being read to.<br/>
<br/>
But her love for sitcoms on Disney has been the primary source of her <br/>
education this year and I&#39;m amazed at the dividends I see in her.<br/>
<br/>
She totally &quot;gets&quot; plot, characterization, acting skill, writing and <br/>
more. She uses adult language and imitates what she hears on TV and <br/>
uses her language in context.<br/>
<br/>
I would not have known that this was possible a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
I do watch with her and my other kids quite a bit and now have my own <br/>
favorite shows that we share together: That&#39;s So Raven (the I Love Lucy <br/>
of the Disney channel), Boy Meets World, Whose Line is it Anyway and <br/>
the usual round up of reality shows (Survivor, American Idol, The <br/>
Swan...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485076088">I wanted to give more specific information since my son is 4 like the <br/>
child of the person who asked the original question.<br/>
<br/>
TV has led my son to his 2 biggest passions.  When he was 3 he <br/>
watched Lion King A LOT!  Somedays he would watch it multiple times, <br/>
sometimes we would have weeks were he watched it everyday.  I watched <br/>
it with him as much as I could stand and we talked about it a lot.  <br/>
I&#39;m still not sure of all the things he got out of it, but I do know <br/>
it led to an interest in African animals.  So we did a study of <br/>
African animals, using books, videos, computer games, trips to the <br/>
zoo etc.  It started out with him just being interested in animals in <br/>
the savanna like in the movie.  Then we read about rain forests in <br/>
one of our books and he got interested in that.  Which led to a study <br/>
of all habitats and the animals that live there.  He knows more than <br/>
most adults about habitats, adaptations, animals etc.  This interest <br/>
has lasted over a year for him.<br/>
<br/>
His other passion is robots.  He found that passion also through TV <br/>
and a show called Battlebots.  We watched it all the time and have <br/>
many episodes on tape.  He has a few Battlebots books that he looks <br/>
at everyday (and has for almost a year), he is learning to read from <br/>
these books.  We are now building our own battlebot (his idea, but <br/>
I&#39;m doing most of the work LOL).  He is learning about design, <br/>
construction, electronics, physics and who knows what else because of <br/>
this passion.<br/>
<br/>
Without TV, my son may have still discovered these passions but I <br/>
can&#39;t imagine what our life would have been like without them.  Just <br/>
something to think about before limiting TV, you may be limiting your <br/>
child from finding their passion.<br/>
