<div id="ygrps-yiv-204402109">This is not for those who have a sensitive stomach.  This is a report on a<br/>
book that will be coming out in October and will be discussed at the<br/>
Anthropological Associations meeting.  It deals with another one of the<br/>
measles vaccines.  This vaccine was one of the first to be tested but it<br/>
was considered more harmful than useful.  So, as scientists will, they<br/>
decided to find some guinea pigs and use it anyway.<br/>

Geneticist accused of letting thousands die in rainforest<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thousands of South American indians were infected with measles, killing<br/>
hundreds, in order for US scientists to study the effects on primitive<br/>
societies of natural selection, according to a book out next month.<br/>
<br/>
The astonishing story of genetic research on humans, which took 10 years to<br/>
uncover, is likely to shake the world of anthropology to its core,<br/>
according to Professor Terry Turner of Cornell University, who has read the<br/>
proofs.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;In its scale, ramifications, and sheer criminality and corruption it is<br/>
unparalleled in the history of anthropology,&#39;&#39; Prof Turner says in a<br/>
warning letter to Louise Lamphere, the president of the American<br/>
Anthropology Association (AAA).<br/>
<br/>
The book accuses James Neel, the geneticist who headed a long-term project<br/>
to study the Yanomami people of Venezuela in the mid-60s, of using a<br/>
virulent measles vaccine to spark off an epidemic which killed hundreds and<br/>
probably thousands.<br/>
<br/>
Once the epidemic was under way, according to the book, the research team<br/>
&#39;&#39;refused to provide any medical assistance to the sick and dying Yanomami,<br/>
on explicit order from Neel. He insisted to his colleagues that they were<br/>
only there to observe and record the epidemic, and that they must stick <br/>
strictly to their roles as scientists, not provide medical help&#39;&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
The book, Darkness in El Dorado by the investigative journalist Patrick<br/>
Tierney, is due to be published on October 1. Prof Turner, whose letter was<br/>
co-signed by fellow anthropologist Leslie Sponsel of the University<br/>
of Hawaii, was trying to warn the AAA of the impending scandal so the<br/>
profession could defend itself.<br/>
<br/>
Although Neel died last February, many of his associates, some of them<br/>
authors of classic anthropology texts, are still alive.<br/>
<br/>
The accusations will be the main focus of the AAA&#39;s AGM in November, when<br/>
the surviving scientists have been invited to defend their work. None have<br/>
commented publicly, but they are asking colleagues to come to their<br/>
defence.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most controversial aspects of the research which allegedly<br/>
culminated in the epidemic is that it was funded by the US atomic energy<br/>
commission, which was anxious to discover what might happen to <br/>
communities when large numbers were wiped out by nuclear war.<br/>
<br/>
While there is no &#39;&#39;smoking gun&#39;&#39; in the form of texts or recorded speeches<br/>
by Neel explaining his conduct, Prof Turner believes the only explanation<br/>
is that he was trying to test controversial eugenic theories like the <br/>
Nazi scientist Josef Mengele.<br/>
<br/>
He quotes another anthropologist who read the manuscript as saying: &#39;&#39;Mr.<br/>
Tierney&#39;s analysis is a case study of the dangers in science of the<br/>
uncontrolled ego, of lack of respect for life, and of greed and <br/>
self-indulgence. It is a further extraordinary revelation of malicious and<br/>
perverted work conducted under the aegis of the atomic energy commission.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Prof Turner says Neel and his group used a virulent vaccine called Edmonson<br/>
B on the Yanomani, which was known to produce symptoms virtually<br/>
indistinguishable from cases of measles.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Medical experts, when informed that Neel and his group used the vaccine<br/>
in question on the Yanomami, typically refuse to believe it at first, then<br/>
say that it is incredible that they could have done it, and are at a loss <br/>
to explain why they would have chosen such an inappropriate and dangerous<br/>
vaccine,&#39;&#39; he writes.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;There is no record that Neel sought any medical advice before applying<br/>
the vaccine. He never informed the appropriate organs of the Venezuelan<br/>
government that his group was planning to carry out a vaccination campaign,<br/>
as he was legally required to do.<br/>
<br/>
Fatalities<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Neither he nor any other member of the expedition has ever explained why<br/>
that vaccine was used, despite the evidence that it actually caused or, at<br/>
a minimum, greatly exacerbated the fatal epidemic.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Prof Turner says that Neel held the view that &#39;&#39;natural&#39;&#39; human society, as<br/>
seen before the advent of large-scale agriculture, consists of small,<br/>
genetically isolated groups in which dominant genes - specifically a <br/>
gene he believed existed for &#39;&#39;leadership&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;innate ability&#39;&#39; - have a<br/>
selective advantage.<br/>
<br/>
In such an environment, male carriers of this gene would gain access to a<br/>
disproportionate number of females, reproducing their genes more frequently<br/>
than less &#39;&#39;innately able&#39;&#39; males. The result would supposedly be a<br/>
continual upgrading of the human genetic stock.<br/>
<br/>
He says Neel believed that in modern societies &#39;&#39;superior leadership genes<br/>
would be swamped by mass genetic mediocrity&#39;&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;The political implication of this fascistic eugenics is clearly that<br/>
society should be reorganised into small breeding isolates in which<br/>
genetically superior males could emerge into dominance, eliminating<br/>
or subordinating the male losers in the competition for leadership and<br/>
women, and amassing harems of brood females.&#39;&#39; Prof Turner adds.<br/>
<br/>
In the memo he says: &#39;&#39;One of Tierney&#39;s more startling revelations is that<br/>
the whole Yanomami project was an outgrowth and continuation of the atomic<br/>
energy commission&#39;s secret programme of experiments on human subjects.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Neel, the originator of the project, was part of the medical and genetic<br/>
research team attached to the atomic energy commission since the days of<br/>
the Manhattan Project.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
James Neel was well-known for his research into the effects of radiation on<br/>
human subjects and personally headed the team that investigated the effects<br/>
of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs on survivors and their children.<br/>
<br/>
According to Prof Turner, the same group also secretly carried out<br/>
experiments on human subjects in the US. These included injecting people<br/>
with radioactive plutonium without their knowledge or permission.<br/>
Nightmarish<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;This nightmarish story - a real anthropological heart of darkness beyond<br/>
the imagining of even a Joseph Conrad (though not, perhaps, a Josef<br/>
Mengele) - will be seen (rightly in our view) by the public, as well as<br/>
most anthropologists, as putting the whole discipline on trial,&#39;&#39; he says.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;This book should... cause the field to understand how the corrupt and<br/>
depraved protagonists could have spread their poison for so long while they<br/>
were accorded great respect throughout the western world... This <br/>
should never be allowed to happen again.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Professor Turner told the Guardian it was unfortunate that the<br/>
confidential memo had been leaked, but it had accomplished its original<br/>
purpose in getting a full response from the AAA.<br/>
<br/>
A public forum would be held at its AGM in November to discuss the book its<br/>
revelations and courses of action.  In a statement yesterday the<br/>
association said &#39;&#39;The AAA is extremely concerned about these allegations.<br/>
If proven true they would constitute a serious violation of Yanomami human<br/>
rights and our code of ethics. Until there is a full and impartial review<br/>
and discussion of the issues raised in the book, it would be unfair to<br/>
express a judgment about the specific allegations against individuals that<br/>
are contained in it.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;The association is anticipating conducting an open forum during our<br/>
annual meeting to provide an opportunity for our members to review and<br/>
discuss the issues and allegations raised in the book.&#39;&#39;<br/>
