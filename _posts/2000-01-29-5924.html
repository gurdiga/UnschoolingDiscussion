with all of my work now and if you guys got too interesting I might not get<br/>
anything done.<br/>
<br/>
Truly though, while I want us always to help the new folks and even just the<br/>
curious, my real love is extending and deepening the lessons we&#39;re learning<br/>
while unschooling. There is something very important here, some lessons that<br/>
others need to at least take a look at.  And we are seeing unschooling<br/>
becoming a target for those who think there is only one right way to<br/>
homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
This list is rich with long term unschoolers, let&#39;s dive deeply and see what<br/>
we come up with!<br/>

left voluntarily before the moderator kicked me off for defending Dick.<br/>
Somebody had taken a comment of his out of context and took offense and<br/>
BAM! the moderator jumped on him inappropriatly IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
UC got to be too much for last year when the MS started acting up so I<br/>
dropped off.<br/>
I was thinking of hooking back up but this list is just as fun and now I<br/>
have new brains to pick for ideas.<br/>
I do kinda of miss the in depth philosophical discussions though!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525447470">Unschoolers Circle, I think.  Geez, its been so long since I thought of it<br/>
as anything but the UC.  It was started after a big war on the UL<br/>
(Unschoolers List) and some members were kicked off and others were told to<br/>
shut up (UL is moderated).  At first it was more a sounding board for a<br/>
particular couple of folks who are/were rabid unschoolers!  And I mean<br/>
RABID!!!  There way or no way or you weren&#39;t an unschooler.  Then about 6<br/>
months ago it blew up with one list members boyfriend coming on as a troll<br/>
and then another list member going balistic because he didn&#39;t believe in<br/>
medication of any sort and then wanted another list members hubby (a<br/>
doctor) to do online prescribing for the teenage girl he married (he&#39;s 40).<br/>
 The feathers, fur and just about everything else hit the fan.  Two other<br/>
lists were off shots of the UC, SO (Schools Out) and NC (No Class, as in no<br/>
classes).  Then NC blew up because of off list posting and parties that<br/>
live in LaLa Land.<br/>
<br/>
And there you have the UC, which is really quiet right now, saga.  And, to<br/>
cut to the chase, yes they are on OneList.<br/>
