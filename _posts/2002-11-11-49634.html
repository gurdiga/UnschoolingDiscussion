 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going through something a little like that with my son.  We&#39;ve always<br/>
gone through a public program, and it&#39;s always been very easy to find<br/>
something he&#39;s done to send in for &quot;evidence of learning&quot;.  They never much<br/>
cared what.  Now he&#39;s high school age, and they do care.  Plus, he says he<br/>
wants to get a high school diploma through them.<br/>
What I&#39;ve done is to put the ball into his court.  I tell him that if he<br/>
wants to keep the computer (they loan us one) he has to keep the online<br/>
teacher happy.  This teacher is the easiest one of the bunch to keep happy.<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t care whether he stays on the program or not.  (I have my<br/>
own computer, and he earns enough working for his dad that he could buy one<br/>
for himself.)<br/>
So you might just let it be *her* problem rather than yours.  You could also<br/>
consider withdrawing her from the district program and going it alone.  Then<br/>
she could do what she wants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543859691">I am sure you will get great suggestions from the folks who have/had<br/>
teens. I just have one idea to suggest. How important are grades to you<br/>
and her really? Does it matter that she may be a &quot;D&quot; student in the eyes<br/>
of the school district, if her only purpose in going to be a senior is<br/>
the social aspect. Perhaps all she **needs** to do is the bare minimum<br/>
to enable her to be in the classes. I bet she does great in the subjects<br/>
that capture her interest. You may be able to feel more relaxed together<br/>
if you let go of the idea that she has to make some kind of grade and<br/>
instead say to her: &quot;I don&#39;t care what grades you receive since grades<br/>
are not a genuine assessment of the wonderful person that you are, or<br/>
your level of authentic knowledge about what is important to you. We<br/>
know we are just playing a game with the public school to allow you to<br/>
have access to the social opportunities at the high school.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
You never know - she may hate high school once she gets there ;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with what others said. You have to let her choose not to do the math<br/>
so that she has the opportunity to choose to do it. Or for her to seek out<br/>
some other solution. Or to decide it isn&#39;t worth it.<br/>
<br/>
You have to let go of ownership of the problem. It isn&#39;t yours. Let her own<br/>
it. Let her try out whatever methods she wants to solve the problem even if<br/>
you think there&#39;s no way she&#39;s going to reach her goal that way. Trust her<br/>
to be able to see she&#39;s creating consequences by not doing the math. To her<br/>
the consequences may be worth it for now. She needs to deal with the<br/>
consequenes to decide if the program is worth putting up with to reach her<br/>
goal.<br/>
<br/>
But be supportive of her. Don&#39;t dump the problem on her and let her sink or<br/>
swim. Tell her you recognize she has to do it her way and you&#39;ll be there to<br/>
help her in anyway she needs you to. Look at it as if she were working on a<br/>
video game or other puzzle that you didn&#39;t have much interest in. She&#39;s<br/>
working towards some goal that&#39;s important to her but that you&#39;re detached<br/>
from. If she was getting frustrated or having problems, you&#39;d want to help<br/>
her. You might suggest ways she could get help or offer to seek out help<br/>
with her: search on line, call up a knowledgeable friend, find a book at the<br/>
library, take a break for a while so she can gain perspective and so on. But<br/>
you wouldn&#39;t hover over her and tell her she needs to do such and such.<br/>
<br/>
Look at it not as a way to get her into school her senior year but as an<br/>
opportunity for her to set goal and figure out ways to meet them. Part of<br/>
learning about achieving goals is learning how to decide when the goal isn&#39;t<br/>
worth what&#39;s needed to get there.<br/>

school is for and see it as an opportunity for something else. Let her use<br/>
it as a resource rather than follow the crowd and only see what she&#39;s told<br/>
she must see (academics).<br/>

&lt;&lt;   She says <br/>

<br/>
You might possibly consider telling her that since YOU don&#39;t care if she goes <br/>
back her senior year, and since she is compromising your integrity and making <br/>
ill use of your time and efforts, that she needs to make a decision NOW <br/>
whether she wants to do the work with your help, or do the work without your <br/>
help, or ease up about her determination to go back.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve probably already said something like that, but if you make it clearer <br/>
to her what the factors are, maybe she will see that there is no incentive <br/>
for you the mom to drag her through something she&#39;s only pretending to do.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea:   Enroll her in a community college math class, or set her up <br/>
to audit a university math class, and let THAT do several thing:  count as <br/>
her weekly math work; give her a chance to learn it from someone who <br/>
*perhaps* can explain some things in ways that spark her own thought; give <br/>
her a glimpse of what&#39;s in the world besides high school.<br/>

It&#39;s her choice to do it that way.  I don&#39;t believe she understands fully the <br/>
consequences, but teenagers are like that, sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about where you live, but there may be another way to get back <br/>
into school besides doing the school-at-home approach.  Don&#39;t they have a way <br/>
for out-of-town students to transfer in?  Private school students?  <br/>
<br/>
My son went back in 10th grade, stayed for 2 semesters, caused enough trouble <br/>
for his own liking and quit.  (He was always challenging the teachers re <br/>
bathroom breaks, etc. @@)  Anyway, the way we got him in was to enroll him in <br/>
Clonlara, and let them send a transcript that we had reported.  That was <br/>
rather expensive, but it looked at the time that he would stick with <br/>
Clonlara, so...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an idea.<br/>

don&#39;t graduate...but they give you a certificate of attendance when you walk <br/>
across the stage.  Maybe she could have all the pomp and none of the <br/>

schools don&#39;t keep a test record except the SAT tests that the kids <br/>
take at 6/7 and 10/11 years old. And SATs primarily test the <br/>
school, not the child.<br/>
So, if a child moves to TN or someplece at age 12 or 15 or <br/>
whatever are they forbidden to graduate or is the 15yo put in 1st <br/>
grade so she can *do* all the US tests?<br/>
In the UK you don&#39;t have to pass any *tests* to move up a grade. <br/>
You just move up in September automatically with your class. <br/>
Everyone stays together for 12 years. At 14 you choose 5-10 <br/>
subjects to take exams in at 16. You either pass or fail them. <br/>
Leave school or stay on to take 1-3 subjects at A level at 18. There <br/>
is no &#39;graduation&#39;. You sit the exams then you leave. No fanfare <br/>
nothing.<br/>
In fact, no graduation ceremony until you leave university and even <br/>
then you don&#39;t have to go as your degree is given to you dependant <br/>
on your exams, not being at some shindig in a dress.<br/>

in all the credits he was claiming for homeschooling when he moved from out <br/>

and they backed off.<br/>

<br/>
Regularly enrolled students sometimes flunk math and make the class up<br/>
in summer school.  You may want to ask the supervising teacher in your<br/>
home study program what her options would be if she flunked.  It&#39;s good<br/>
to know all the options.<br/>
<br/>
Some people hire math tutors and pay them lavishly.  But if it&#39;s a<br/>
motivation issue, not a skill issue, then tutoring isn&#39;t what she needs.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the school requires 4 years of math, maybe she can postpone one<br/>
math class to take when she is a senior.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the flavor of my suggestions, I really believe what everyoone<br/>
else said that this needs to be her decision.  However, your support can<br/>
be very valuable.  If you don&#39;t want to be a &quot;drill sargeant&quot; don&#39;t let<br/>
her make you into one.<br/>

I am all for homeschooling and do some unschooling with my 8 year old but I <br/>
also have two sophmores and here&#39;s my idea for you. You have have to go all <br/>
the way if you do it. Sit her down and tell her that you are sorry for the  <br/>
fighting over grades and completion of assignments. You fought with her over <br/>
them because you love her but you were wrong . you are sorry. You tell her <br/>
you know high school is a late for you to let go And you are sorry you did <br/>
not let go sooner, you should have but you are now. Tell her I earned my <br/>
grades and did my assignments and now its your turn. Enroll her back at her <br/>
ps. Tell her (and don&#39;t expect aA&#39;s and B&#39;s) you do expect her to do for <br/>
herself what she&#39; wants out of life but that it is her chioce. If she gets <br/>
all F&#39;s leave her alone - tell her you love her - take her out to her <br/>
favorite movies but remind her its her life and you are there if she has <br/>
questions. After being after her for grades and assignments for so long it <br/>
might take a year and a half before she &quot;buys&quot; into it - BUT KIDS MUST MOVE <br/>
TO DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES  it works for most quite naturally at 2nd or 3rd <br/>
grade - lots of love but if she won&#39;t read the book its more about a <br/>
tug-of-war between you and her and she hasn&#39;t had a chance to find out who <br/>
she is and what she&#39;s made of. It&#39;s much better for her to fail while she&#39;s <br/>
still under your roof - its time for unnagging not unschooling<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059235814">unnagging and unschooling could be great too<br/>
I just &quot;heard&quot; in the message perhaps incorrectly that her mom had pushed and <br/>
controlled her at schooling to the point that she did not know what she (dd) <br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;buying into it&quot; I meant really believing that she could decide how <br/>
dedicated she would be to her studies in school or out.<br/>
