<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536929748">&lt;&lt;are artists who have songs that I would let my kids listen to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And when I say let I mean introduce them to.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We listen to all music here (including country now thanks to taylor swift<br/>
and miley cirus) Two of my kids know some of the words to a song about a guy<br/>
being in love with a stripper.  I asked them if they knew what a stripper<br/>
was  they didnt  so I explained it to them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We dont censor anything here, but we will talk about what weve heard.<br/>
They are always asking me what some song is about, and why do people only<br/>
sing about love.  We talk about relationships and if we think whats being<br/>
discussed in the song is true or not.  We talk about how men and women treat<br/>
each other.  We talk about sex, history, education, drugs, weapons, the laws<br/>
of society, racism, classism  all of this from listening to music.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Namasté<br/>
be at peace,<br/>

When a big kid hits a little kid on the playground, we call him a bully;<br/>
five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>
disobedient or disrespectful child, we call him a disciplinarian. Why is<br/>
this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>
 Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and<br/>
affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is<br/>
more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present. <br/>
<br/>
~ Jean Baptiste Lacordaire<br/>

<br/>
I have a theory.  (I&#39;m sure others have the same theory, so it&#39;s not  <br/>
a sparkle of newness in the world. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
People write songs when they&#39;re pining for something they don&#39;t have,  <br/>
so they write of love when they&#39;re in love and the other person isn&#39;t  <br/>
there (as a release for the huge emotion) and they write about love  <br/>
when they break up and don&#39;t have access to the other person anymore.<br/>
<br/>
And war...<br/>
<br/>
People write about wars they lost, not wars they won.  The winners  <br/>
are off carousing and drinking or whatever they do best, and the  <br/>
losers (often Scotland) are home writing the details of what they did  <br/>
wrong, or how those bastard English cheated them again.<br/>
<br/>
If you listen to Spanish stations without knowing much Spanish (or  <br/>
even with) the word that will stick with you is &quot;corazon.&quot;  Maybe  <br/>
because it rhymes so well.  Maybe &quot;moon&quot; wouldn&#39;t be so romantic in  <br/>
English if it didn&#39;t rhyme so well and evoke a night when, before  <br/>
there were streetlights and electricity and flashlights, a couple  <br/>
might&#39;ve been able to walk safely some distance away from other  <br/>
people and have some kissy-face.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids get in the mood, I have this collection:<br/>

<br/>
They might have a contribution for it!  It&#39;s songs that describe the  <br/>
physical sensations of being in love.  Evidence for love creating a  <br/>
biochemical change.  It even shuts off the rational-thought part of  <br/>
the brain, some researchers are saying now.  That explains a heck of  <br/>
a lot.<br/>
