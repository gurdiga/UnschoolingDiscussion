<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029631132">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Ruby, and just joined this list.  I have sort of an unusual <br/>
situation on my hands, and would greatly appreciate any advice you <br/>
can give me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve vacillated in my approach to home learning, but basically have <br/>
remained somewhat of a &#39;radical&#39; unschooler, in that I can barely <br/>
stomache anything that even looks like &#39;school&#39;.  I don&#39;t judge <br/>
anyone else for thier different approaches to home learning, but for <br/>
our family, this just &#39;fits&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
But I will definately &#39;bend&#39; in this particular situation, which <br/>
will &#39;probably&#39; be temporary.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Oregon, and tried to access the &#39;orsig&#39; group, but it was <br/>
unavailable for some reason.  I don&#39;t know of any other groups for my <br/>
state, so I decided to come here, because I&#39;m an unschooler, and you <br/>
have lots of members for me to draw advice from.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m raising my grandson, and we&#39;ve been, (for the most part), <br/>
unschooling since he was a baby.  He&#39;s almost 7 now, and smart as a <br/>
whip, a whiz with math, yet slow to warm up to reading, or any type <br/>
of &#39;busywork&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Oregon is a homeschooling friendly state, and basically stays out of <br/>
our business, with the exception of testing every three years.  By <br/>
the time my grandson is seven, I will need to file an &#39;intent to <br/>
homeschool&#39; with the school district, and have him tested every three <br/>
years from there on out.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been involved in any homeschool support groups, because <br/>
there just hasn&#39;t been the need for it thus far, and some of the <br/>
things I&#39;ve read about &#39;cliques&#39;, and &#39;elitism&#39; in some homeschool <br/>
groups, I don&#39;t know if I ever will join one, because I&#39;m very <br/>
unconventional in my beliefs and in our home learning, I just don&#39;t <br/>
see me finding a group that would be supportive.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who homeschools her children, in much the same way as <br/>
I do, and we get together often for outings and such, and that seems <br/>
to satisfy my grandson&#39;s need for social interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, at long last, here&#39;s the situation.  Another grandson, from <br/>
another state...California, who is almost eight, is here with us now, <br/>
and will be with us at least until the end of the school year.  There <br/>
were some serious personal problems in his family that prompted his <br/>
coming to us.<br/>
<br/>
The two of them get along wonderfully, except for the <br/>
usual &#39;bullying&#39; type stuff that he learned in public school, and in <br/>
his life thus far.  But the new grandson responds beautifully to <br/>
being loved and respected, and has a sweet spirit in him that just <br/>
needs a little more encouragement than most, because his life has <br/>
been nothing but unpredictable, neglected, and emotionally abused.<br/>
<br/>
He has expressed a great desire to be homeschooled with the other <br/>
one, rather than go to our local public elementary school.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe this would be the best for everyone concerned, but when his <br/>
mother disenrolled him in California, she was told that he would have <br/>
to recieve a passing grade to be enrolled again in California next <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a clue where to begin to find out what the requirements <br/>
are for a passing grade in California for second grade.  I know I can <br/>
have him tested here, in Oregon, but I&#39;m sure they test for Oregon <br/>
requirements.<br/>
<br/>
There is a great likelihood that he might remain here with us in <br/>
Oregon after the current family crisis is over, but should things <br/>
improve enough that he should return to his mother, I don&#39;t want to <br/>
send him home without the requirements to enter third grade in <br/>
California.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice you have would be so greatly appreciated!  Thank you in <br/>
advance for anything you can advise me on here.<br/>
<br/>

not be at all concerned about his placement in school.  When he goes back<br/>

&lt;&lt; I believe this would be the best for everyone concerned, but when his <br/>
mother disenrolled him in California, she was told that he would have <br/>
to recieve a passing grade to be enrolled again in California next <br/>
year. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That shouldn&#39;t affect homeschooling, and certainly nothing they say in <br/>
another state can affect homeschooling in Oregon.  And &quot;a passing grade&quot; in <br/>
what?  (Probably they were assuming he would be in a school-at-home program.)<br/>
<br/>
At least one state has some sort of requirement that if a child doesn&#39;t test <br/>
above the 30th percentile on a standardized test (or something like that) <br/>
they can&#39;t be homeschooled the next year.  But that means &quot;can&#39;t be legally <br/>
homeschooled in that state.&quot;  If they move to Texas or New Mexico it matters <br/>
not one whit what the old state said or thought or intended.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;but should things <br/>
improve enough that he should return to his mother, I don&#39;t want to <br/>
send him home without the requirements to enter third grade in <br/>
California.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a semi-secret thing called &quot;social promotion.&quot;  What it means is <br/>
that there is a legal liability to the schools if a much-older child harms a <br/>
much-younger/smaller child.  Particularly, historically, a problem was <br/>
combining pubescent boys with younger children.  That&#39;s part of why <br/>
midschools came to be.  <br/>
<br/>
So if he&#39;s more than one year past the age of being in second grade, they <br/>
won&#39;t put him in second grade.  They&#39;ll put him in third by age.<br/>
<br/>
The problem or concern might be &quot;being behind&quot; in third grade.  If he can <br/>
read well and he knows addition and subtraction, there&#39;s nothing to &quot;be <br/>
behind&quot; in--the science and history aren&#39;t continuous, and even if they <br/>
weriting.<br/>
<br/>
And if you say &quot;He was homeschooled in Oregon last year,&quot; they will just put <br/>
him in by age, too, most likely.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was just a threat by the district to try to scare her out of <br/>
disenrollment?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11866921">I think I can answer this pretty safely without a mistake (hopefully, I am<br/>
sure someone will be eager to correct me if I am wrong:) )<br/>
<br/>
I am unschooling grandchildren also by the way, and welcome if I haven&#39;t<br/>
already said it.<br/>
<br/>
I raised 6 children in California that went to public schools for the entire<br/>
education.  They will not refuse to enroll that child, it is the law he go<br/>
to school, they can not refuse.<br/>
<br/>
The person who told her that was just giving her static because a lot of<br/>
public school employees and workers do not believe in homeschooling or<br/>
unschooling so they were just giving her a hard time.  They don&#39;t even have<br/>
placement tests for children that young.   Otherwise they would be having to<br/>
pass a final exam at the end of the year and they do not do that in<br/>
elementary school for passing grades one into the other.<br/>
<br/>
She will just tell them what grade to put him in, she can insist ( they try<br/>
to bully you into thinking you have no choice,,,not true ).  Then if he has<br/>
problems they will contact her and try to get her to agree to put him back.<br/>
<br/>
Life happens and this is one of those times what has to be done has to be<br/>
done.  They can&#39;t take a whole year away from him and punish him because<br/>
there was a family emergency in the last few weeks of school.<br/>

No worries.<br/>
We moved to california last year and my son who&#39;d been unschooled wanted to try<br/>
school in the middle of 5th grade.  On his registration form for &quot;previous<br/>
school attended&quot; all I  wrote was homeschooled.  They never asked about any<br/>
records.  They didn&#39;t even ask if he &quot;passed&quot;.<br/>
FWIW, he&#39;s back to being home (un)schooled - school was not what he expected.<br/>
And I would say truly a nightmare for all involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753708941"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m on a couple of gardening type lists and one poster mentioned that in<br/>
&gt;Salem they are now limiting the amount of space that can be used for<br/>
&gt;gardening on each lot and that there will be fines if one goes over the<br/>
&gt;designated maximum.`<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the reason they give?  Is that ornamental or food gardening, or <br/>
both?  Could it be an effort to reduce water use?  In that case, <br/>
Xeriscaping ought to be allowed.  What do they expect people to do with any <br/>
leftover space?  Pave it?  Yuck!<br/>
