<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678267336">Growing up in the country, with a brother in animal conservation, <br/>
I had a wide variety of pets, domestic and exotic. I loved them all, <br/>
but I was not the primary caregiver of any animal until I adopted <br/>
my cat, Winston, in college. I had no trouble accepting that <br/>
responsibility, and he is still with me today, 17 years later. We <br/>
now have three cats and one rat, the youngest cat and rat <br/>
belonging to my son, who is 8. He adores them, and loves to <br/>
play with them some every day, but he is too busy to give them <br/>
the level of care and attention they need to thrive. So I clean and <br/>
feed, groom and play with all of them. I wouldn&#39;t want them to <br/>
suffer from lack of attention, and I don&#39;t want him to miss out on <br/>
the joy of having pets, just because he is too young to completely <br/>
care for them. Besides, I adore them, too. He has been <br/>
interested in a variety of pets, and we always researched their <br/>
needs and discussed whether or not we could give them what <br/>
they needed and also get what we wanted from a companion <br/>
animal. The deciding factor has always been whether I, mom, <br/>
am willing to accept full responsibility for the lifetime care of the <br/>
animal. If not, then we don&#39;t get it. <br/>
<br/>
In contrast, my son has a friend, the same age, who impulsively <br/>
wants every animal he sees in the pet store. They get it, without <br/>
having any idea how to care for it, and it dies shortly thereafter. <br/>
Then they just go get something else. He teases animals, <br/>
screams at them to scare them, and throws rocks. He has gone <br/>
through literally dozens of hamsters; I shudder to think. Instead <br/>
of learning love and compassion, he is indirectly being taught <br/>
that animals are disposable.<br/>
