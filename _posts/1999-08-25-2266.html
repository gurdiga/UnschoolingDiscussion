&gt; &gt;Hi Nancy<br/>
&gt; &gt;Carol<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the musical advice &quot;Karel&quot; but, why oh why can&#39;t anyone spell my<br/>
&gt; name right!?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not picking on you, just using the opportunity to ask everyone to<br/>
&gt; please spell my name correctly.  Please!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

you will!!!  And, because Nance is a man&#39;s name in the South (from what I <br/>
understand) a lot of my mail comes addressed Mr.  Of course, half of it has <br/>
my husband&#39;s last name (which is not mine) so I pretty much just give up at <br/>
this point.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL.  Thanks Nance.  That&#39;s pretty funny.  I had a really easy maiden name<br/>
and I used to just have problems with my first name getting spelled right.<br/>
My husband however, comes along and sweeps me off me feet, and brings THAT<br/>
name with him.  It is pronounced (Kirk-end-all) so when people ask me what<br/>
me name is, I just spell both of them right off the bat, and occassionally<br/>
someone is familiar with the pronounciation of my last name and after I<br/>
spell it out says &quot;Oh!  &#39;Kirkendall.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I usually tell people that my last name has an invisible &quot;R&quot; in it, akin to<br/>
a silent letter.  Either that, or a Y with an identity crises.<br/>
