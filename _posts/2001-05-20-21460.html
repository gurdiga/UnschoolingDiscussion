Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] I have a question was: Sandra, I see part<br/>
of your point<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My question -- unrelated to any of this -- or who knows?? -- I am curious<br/>
&gt; because of another conversation I have been having -- how many of you<br/>
never<br/>
&gt; sent your kiddos to school and why did you make that decision?  I sent my<br/>
son<br/>
&gt; (pre-K and 7 months of K) then learned about ps and started hsing.  I am<br/>
&gt; wondering how people get the nerve, the info, the empowerment, the<br/>
awareness,<br/>
&gt; the ????? to go straight into hsing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nance<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, we sort of never sent our child to ps.  We have 10 years between our<br/>
boys.  The oldest started out in ps (parents were being jailed for not<br/>
sending their children to ps  when he started school and we simply didn&#39;t<br/>
have what it took to join the fight at the time.  I&#39;m VERY grateful to those<br/>
who paved the way and due to personal experience really keep an eye on what<br/>
is happening, watching for need/opportunity to protect or improve homeschool<br/>
opportunities).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we removed oldest DS mid-8th grade.  He never returned to ps.<br/>
Youngest son has never attended ps.  He&#39;s 12 now.<br/>
<br/>
In all honesty, watching how much trouble ps caused for our oldest DS and<br/>
our family has really helped my resolve to not send youngest DS to ps.  Now,<br/>
any time I consider sending youngest DS to ps, it quickly passes when I<br/>
think about all the rigmarole (sp?!) that goes with the package!<br/>
<br/>
What has empowered me the very most is to have been a guinea pig of several<br/>
new programs in my own ps experiences.  As a child (and adult actually!) we<br/>
moved a lot and it seems like every school I attended had some new program<br/>
or another that they put the new kids into.  Some of them really made school<br/>
awful for me (things like being in a split grade class so I was doing<br/>
advanced work one year and then having to repeat the same work the following<br/>
year because they didn&#39;t have any place else to put me or any other work to<br/>
do and this is what students this age are required to cover...grrr...hate<br/>
that sort by age business).<br/>
<br/>
I have always wanted to homeschool my children from before I even knew who I<br/>
would marry.  I was crushed when DS was school age and local parents were<br/>
going to jail!  DH was in the military in Nebraska and if we had defied the<br/>
local school district DH would have been looking at doing Federal Military<br/>
time.  It was simply too much for us to fight at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I&#39;m surprised that once we made the decision, I had lots of angst<br/>
over the how&#39;s and what if&#39;s.  Seems pretty silly now, but I do remember how<br/>
scary is was to consider teaching my child to read and do math and WHAT IF<br/>
HE DIDN&#39;T LEARN!?  What if he was never socialized!?  (Don&#39;t make me laugh!<br/>
What silliness...yet at the time it was a very real concern.)<br/>
<br/>
Back to empowerment....while worrying about which teaching style would help<br/>
youngest DS learn to read and doing lots of research on one plan and another<br/>
looking for the perfect solution, I realized that nobody writing any book<br/>
knows my son like I do!  No one else can say with any certainty what will<br/>
work for my son.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the key (at least it was for me)...all the &#39;new and improved&#39;<br/>
programs are just a bunch of experiments with our children as the guinea<br/>
pigs!  The educrats don&#39;t know any more about how to reach and teach my son<br/>
than I do...in fact I know more because I know HIM.  Well, if the<br/>
establishment is just conducting experiments...then he might as well stay at<br/>
home with me and we can conduct our own experiment and see how well he does!<br/>
I&#39;m just as qualified to make decisions for my child as any one else.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that&#39;s how I started out thinking...now I realize I&#39;m MORE<br/>
QUALIFIED than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Once I got past finding the &#39;right&#39; way to teach and share with my child and<br/>
we just got down to the business of enjoying our time and lives together it<br/>
has been a grand experience!  I&#39;m amazed at the things he learns from our<br/>
every day activities and thrilled at the things I learn with him.  (That was<br/>
also an important thing to learn...if I don&#39;t know something DS wants/needs<br/>
to learn, it&#39;s no problem.  I just learn along with him or help him find an<br/>
outside resource!)<br/>
<br/>
It helps to rub shoulders (or keyboards, as the case may be) with others who<br/>
are on similar journeys.  Sometimes I&#39;ll see a theory or idea another family<br/>
is using and think &#39;you know what, that just might help our family&#39;.  Other<br/>
times I&#39;ll hear something and know there is no way that is gonna work in our<br/>
home.  It really doesn&#39;t take long to gain confidence in your ability to<br/>
find the answers that are right for your family.  Even better yet, those<br/>
things that don&#39;t work are not likely to cause irreparable damage and the<br/>
things that do work will bring great joy!  How&#39;s that for a deal?<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps!<br/>

It helps to immediately see your own learning preference as soon as you read<br/>
about unschooling. It helps to have quit school two years early to start<br/>
working at interesting things, and be glad of it. It helps to have a husband<br/>
who doesn&#39;t shoot down bizarre-at-the-time ideas out of hand. It helps to<br/>
find very quickly a group of homeschoolers already doing what you dream of<br/>
doing, and watch them at it.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us are just lucky. And cheeky. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It also helps if you have fiery radical tendencies.  (I&#39;ve got some, buried<br/>
under all my timorousness.)<br/>
<br/>
Fiery conservative tendencies are probably also a powerful shot in the arm.<br/>
 (Maybe it&#39;s the un-opinionated that have the hardest time arriving here?)<br/>
<br/>
It helped me to think back over my school career year by year, and try to<br/>
figure out what I learned in each class, each year.  Mostly, it wasn&#39;t<br/>
much.  I can&#39;t remember more than one thing from the third grade.  I<br/>
suspect the teacher was a dull disciplinarian.  If you&#39;ve forgotten a<br/>
foreign language, and most of the math and science you were ever exposed<br/>
to, don&#39;t blame yourself for heaven&#39;s sake.  Blame the school system!   <br/>
