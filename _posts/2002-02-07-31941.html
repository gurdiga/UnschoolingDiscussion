<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070619905">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I thoroughly enjoy listening in on the rich conversations, but have little time to contribute, so thanks for helping me to grow even (especially?) in my silence.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, however, I have a question. Do any of you know of published sources that deal with homeschooling, ideally unschooling, in places other than the US? I know they exist, but my university library either doesn&#39;t carry or index the sources or I am not using good search terms. Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated! I am trying to prepare a paper that looks at homeschooling comparatively.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d prefer to reply to me off list, my address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jdeets@...">jdeets@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Jennifer<br/>

<br/>
                  If you go to the Puget Sound Community School (An <br/>
&quot;unschool&quot; school) website - www.pscs.org - they have lots of links to other <br/>
unschooling  places, some of them out of country.<br/>
