<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532945920">Have them &quot;seek beauty&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
In people - discuss difference between physical and personality/spiritual<br/>
In nature<br/>
In man-made objects -discuss form vs. utility<br/>
In architecture<br/>
Your meeting place, neighborhood, community<br/>
In their homes - houses vs. family (what makes a &#39;home&#39;?)<br/>
In words - stories, poetry<br/>
<br/>
Tell about &quot;most beautiful&quot; character from a story, movie, tv show, etc. -<br/>
again, look for different types of beauty.<br/>
<br/>
They can draw, write/dictate, create nature collages/ other ideas that have<br/>
been shared...<br/>
<br/>
Have a wonderful morning with this!<br/>
<br/>
