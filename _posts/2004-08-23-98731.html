Subject: Why isn&#39;t this working!?<br/>
<br/>
Andrea, I was very touched by your post, and I can<br/>
relate to alot of what you expressed.  Below I&#39;ve made<br/>
some comments within your quotes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;There is the near-constant bickering <br/>
&gt;&gt;and fighting that I&#39;ve mentioned before.  They hit<br/>
&gt;&gt;and kick each other.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a lot of pent up emotion.  Do they see<br/>
other people hitting and kicking each other?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The 3yo does this for no apparent reason. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure there is a very good reason.  Perhaps she<br/>
needs more one on one attention from you and/or her<br/>
father.  Perhaps she still has a lot of jealousy<br/>
surrounding her 1 year old sibling and/or possibly her<br/>
older sibling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If I remove her from the <br/>
&gt;&gt;scene, she yells screams and stomps her feet andthen<br/>
&gt;&gt;when she finally <br/>
&gt;&gt;calms down 15-20 minutes later and lets me hold her<br/>
&gt;&gt;and care for her a bit, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe this is exactly what she needs.  Perhaps try<br/>
holding and &#39;caring&#39; for her before she reaches this<br/>
point of acting out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The baby (1yo) pulls <br/>
&gt;&gt;everyones hair and scratches and bites and pinches<br/>
&gt;&gt;when he is thwarted in any <br/>
&gt;&gt;way (and sometimes for no apparent reason he&#39;ll just<br/>
&gt;&gt;run over and hurt <br/>
&gt;&gt;one of the girls when they are watching something on<br/>
&gt;&gt;tv)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seems like the 1 year old is trying to communicate and<br/>
get attention.  And, this seems to work.  Perhaps try<br/>
giving more attention to the 1 year old and clueing<br/>
into times that might make him/her do these hurtful<br/>
actions; thus, possibly preventing them.  Have you<br/>
thought about doing sign language with her?<br/>
<br/>
On the t.v. thing:  Try looking more positively about<br/>
it.  Take advantage of it.  You get a break, right? <br/>
Relax.  Do something nearby that you want to do. (I<br/>
think this may have already been said.)  Your children<br/>
are already adjusting to a new move, right?  And their<br/>
dad is gone A LOT, right?  They probably find comfort<br/>
in watching tv.  Is it really the tv that makes you<br/>
depressed?  Seems like there are alot of other factors<br/>
that are probably contributing like financial stuff,<br/>
no help with the kids most of the week, having an<br/>
&#39;absent&#39; partner and having 3 kids aged 4 and under<br/>
would be enough in itself to throw me over the top! <br/>
Wow!  Please hang in there, go easy on yourself.  Do<br/>
you have any home movies that ya&#39;ll could watch?  My 3<br/>
year old and 1 year old love to watch these and see<br/>
themselves and their friends on tv.  Then, they could<br/>
see dad on tv too!  Maybe make a home video just for<br/>
this.  If you don&#39;t own a recorder, maybe borrow one<br/>
from someone who does!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I want to cry (and often do) everyday out of<br/>
&gt;&gt;frustration with dealing <br/>
&gt;&gt;with my children.  I feel guilty for getting so<br/>
&gt;&gt;frustrated that yell and <br/>
&gt;&gt;slam cabinets on occasion.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you may not only be stressed, depressed<br/>
and overwhelmed, but you may also have some post<br/>
partum depression.  Can you try to start a playgroup? <br/>
Are there any childrens or mom&#39;s groups in town?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;(Since I sat down <br/>
&gt;&gt;in desperation to write this<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you desperately needed to cry out for<br/>
help.  And I&#39;m glad you did.  I think many moms hold<br/>
it all in and think they are the only ones having such<br/>
a challenging time.  It must also be really hard<br/>
having just moved to a new place.  It&#39;s not always<br/>
easy or quick to make new friends.  Keep your chin up<br/>
and keep plodding along.  Things should get better! <br/>
Right now just be with your kids.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Then they all wanted a movie, even though I had<br/>
&gt;&gt;offered <br/>
&gt;&gt;both the beach and to make plaster of paris<br/>
&gt;&gt;creatures using balloons and <br/>
&gt;&gt;then painting them with acrylic paint.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe if you just start a project one of the kids may<br/>
join you; and if not, at least you can enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;4 yo says she is full and leaves the table full of<br/>
&gt;&gt;uneaten <br/>
&gt;&gt;apple wedges<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, I&#39;ve been here.  And, a previous poster commented<br/>
that you were prioritizing the apple above your child<br/>
at that moment.  I agree.  You said that was too<br/>
simplistic.  But, it doesn&#39;t have to be complicated. <br/>
Simple is good.  Perhaps you are trying to make things<br/>
more complicated than they need to be.  I have been<br/>
dissapointed when my son didn&#39;t touch his apple wedges<br/>
and apple butter that I prepared for him.  Unknowing<br/>
to him, it was the last apple and I knew how little<br/>
food we had in the house and no money to buy more<br/>
groceries for a while.  So, although it was<br/>
frustrating, I just wrapped it up and put it in the<br/>
fridge.  I guess he really just didn&#39;t need it!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I held her <br/>
&gt;&gt;firmly by the arms and said, &quot;Enough!  I don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt;&gt;to be screamed at.&quot;  <br/>
&gt;&gt;She started crying and stomping her feet and finally<br/>
&gt;&gt;went off to play.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could all this whining and screaming and crying that<br/>
your children do be a result of seeing you do this? <br/>
One thing I learned from my partner who does crisis<br/>
intervention is when someone is screaming etc. to<br/>
reply/talk to them in a soft, quieter, lower voice<br/>
than them.  This brings the noise level and hopefully<br/>
the tension/stress level down.  Might be worth a try.<br/>
<br/>
Andrea,  I hope you can really find some time to relax<br/>
and go easy on yourself.  Not that I am suggesting you<br/>
would do this, but when I read in the paper of mothers<br/>
who kill or abuse their children, it seems that they<br/>
have quite a few young children, and my personal take<br/>
on it is not that they&#39;re insane, but just totally<br/>
stressed out!!  Our society/government could be a lot<br/>
more supportive of mothers and children.  Instead,<br/>
we&#39;re expected to do it all on our own despite the<br/>
fact that alot of families only have one working<br/>
partner, we have to pay for health insurance if we can<br/>
afford it, and struggle to feed our families.  You&#39;re<br/>
doing a good job!<br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739445647">We have a white carpet too (*sigh*) which was in<br/>
pretty darn good condition when we moved in here 3<br/>
years ago.  It gets stained fast!  Some things I&#39;ve<br/>
found to make this easier and helpful are: 1.) Get<br/>
some Bac-Out; it will take out poop stains from the<br/>
carpet from your 1 year old.  2.) There is something<br/>
called Folex that comes in a white spray bottle.  It<br/>
takes out lots of stains- sort of bleaches them out. <br/>
It claims to take out red wine stains.  It&#39;s taken out<br/>
strawberry and grape juice stains for me.  3.) Get<br/>
your carpets cleaned every 6 months.  That&#39;s about how<br/>
long it takes for ours to get so gross I don&#39;t even<br/>
want to lay on it and am embarressed to have other<br/>
kids play on it.  With a cheap carpet cleaning, it&#39;s<br/>
suprising how brand new clean it gets!  4.) Throw an<br/>
area rug on top of it or a blanket.  Dirty carpet? <br/>
What dirty carpet?<br/>
<br/>
When I look around and see our stained, dirty, pee<br/>
smelling carpet (mmm...) and pencil, paint, markered<br/>
up walls I am glad that we are just renting!  But,<br/>
carpets can be cleaned, and walls can be washed.  When<br/>
buying art supplies, I try to get the washable Crayola<br/>
brand as it comes off the walls (and other surfaces)<br/>
suprisingly easy.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I do spend a fair amount of time hunched over a<br/>
&gt;&gt;puddle of pee on the <br/>
&gt;&gt;carpet,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and that drives me nuts.  The carpet is WHITE for<br/>
&gt;&gt;crying out loud (why <br/>
&gt;&gt;do<br/>
&gt;&gt;people do this?) and it&#39;s brand new (though cheap). <br/>
&gt;&gt;Our friends are <br/>
&gt;&gt;letting<br/>
&gt;&gt;us stay here for really cheap and I hate that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;getting so messed <br/>
&gt;&gt;up.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Everytime it gets wet, it&#39;s that much more<br/>
&gt;&gt;susceptable to stains.  <br/>
&gt;&gt;We&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;&gt;just have to get it cleaned when we leave--which we<br/>
&gt;&gt;would have done <br/>
&gt;&gt;anyway.<br/>

I think I first heard about it on this list.  I got spilled ink out of blue <br/>
carpet.  Used to be a big black stain 4&quot; long and is now a little reddish stain <br/>
2&quot; long.  That&#39;s a very good deal. &lt;g&gt;  They sell it at Walmart.<br/>
<br/>
But I like the idea of putting another rug over that carpet.<br/>

=============<br/>
<br/>
Me too.  When we moved in here, I actually put an long piece of scrap carpet<br/>
I found out on the patio in the hallway, since it is such a heavy use area.<br/>
First time I saw the place, I had immediate visions of the brown track that<br/>
would run down the hall if I didn&#39;t do something.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to try bac out for the poop stain that lies just beyond the<br/>
makeshift runner.  3yo didn&#39;t quite make it to the bathroom, but she made it<br/>
3 inches past the protective runner.  Figures! LOL!<br/>
