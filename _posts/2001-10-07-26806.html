<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783183082"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only soaps I ever watched were Dark Shadows (the original) when I was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; high school (we all left skid marks in the halls beating a path out of the<br/>
&gt; building so we would be home in time to watch it &lt;g&gt;) and then Soap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just don&#39;t get why people watch them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lynda<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lynda, I used to be quite addicted to &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.....It all started<br/>
when I was about 7.  The Catholic School I attended got out very early;  and<br/>
when I got home,  my mom was watching her *faves* - As the World Turns,  and<br/>
Guiding Light.  I usually caught some if ATWT,  and all of GL.  In college,<br/>
we had groups who&#39;d race to the lounge to get the TV to watch GL and it&#39;s<br/>
competition, GH.<br/>
As an adult,  I started watching them during little ones naps when I began<br/>
working PT.  I&#39;m amazed to see many of the same actors as when I was a<br/>
kidlet!  For me they&#39;re funny storylines,  but interesting studies in human<br/>
behavior  (My degree is in Psychology!!).  I do find them to be<br/>
addictive...so this year I gave them up for Lent.  (Yes, I am a practicing<br/>
Catholic)  For those of you who think this is a goofy tradition...I just<br/>
wanna say,   it broke my bad habit and enabled me to replace it with more<br/>
positive things....i.e.,  time with children,  time to relax,  time to read<br/>
for myself.<br/>
Anyhow,.....that&#39;s my long answer to why.  I&#39;ll turn it on occassionally<br/>
now,  just to clue in on the storyline...I usually love the spooky<br/>
storylines they come up with around Halloween and the Nov. sweeps....I find<br/>
it all amusing and imaginative.....as long as I can keep it from becoming a<br/>
habit that blocks me from loving myself and my family!<br/>
