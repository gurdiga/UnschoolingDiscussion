&lt;&lt; I think it&#39;s very sad that you would be so rude to a newcomer on the <br/>
 list.  I think it&#39;s sad that you would be intolerant of other <br/>
 people&#39;s parenting practices.  Even if it does give you cold chills, <br/>
 there are much nicer ways to talk to people you disagree with.  You <br/>
 catch more flies with honey...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This list (as stated before) is not the end all, be all of email lists.<br/>
If the person that stated pro-spanking views hadn&#39;t figured out that this is <br/>
not the place for tolerance of all parenting practices, then she has now!!<br/>
<br/>
Trevor (almost 13y.o.) said &quot;you can&#39;t be an unschooler and spank&quot; I asked <br/>
why he believed that.<br/>
&quot;you have to be patient, you can&#39;t hit kids cuz they aren&#39;t doing what you <br/>
want, if you&#39;re going to be a true unschooler you have to be patient&quot;<br/>
Then added &quot;the President can&#39;t go around hitting the Vice President and all <br/>
the other people that work for him just because they aren&#39;t doing everything <br/>
he wants, Why should you be able to do that to kids? I don&#39;t  see much <br/>
difference, just age.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then, just now, my son recalled the one and only time his Father hit him <br/>
with a long stick. It almost ended my marriage, we split up not long after <br/>
that......<br/>
But, just recalling that moment made him cry. And reminded me of the awful <br/>
damage we did. I apologized for not stopping it, or leaving the house with <br/>
the kids that day and not coming back until he agreed to not hit his son.<br/>
How can anyone coming to this list not hear the pain in people&#39;s stories?<br/>
How can anyone trying to follow the example of Christ not see that he would <br/>
NEVER have advocated hitting anyone, much less helpless children?<br/>
And how can another person come on and defend someone like that? This list <br/>
isn&#39;t about tolerance, it&#39;s about unschooling and that is also gentle <br/>
parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Trevor if being spanked helped him obey God, he said &quot;No, it made me <br/>
hate my Dad&quot; <br/>
So good luck with producing anything but fear and hate in your family by  <br/>
hitting innocent people.<br/>
It ain&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>
Violence produces more violence, anger and fear.<br/>
Love produces more love, peace and joy.<br/>
Love is always the answer.<br/>
