I was getting a little worried &lt;g&gt; with this thread, because 15 yo ds watches <br/>
quite a bit of TV, really.  Someone said the other day that tuning out is a <br/>
sign of a problem (and you repeated it here).  That is what worried me.  Back <br/>
when he was in school, he used the TV to tune out on a disturbingly regular <br/>
basis.  Now, after 2 years at home, he&#39;s started watching it more again.  <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m looking at what he&#39;s watching, and it&#39;s *stimulating* TV, for the <br/>
most part.  Not *tuning out* TV.  There really is a difference.  He&#39;s getting a <br/>
lot of history, physics, mechanical engineering, biology, etc. with his TV <br/>
time.  And some pure entertainment, and I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that, <br/>
either.  Science fiction shows and anime.<br/>
