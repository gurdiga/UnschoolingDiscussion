<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334352576">Hello, <br/>
This board has been quiet for a while. But I hope all you supportive moms are <br/>
somewhere near your computers. I am having a Mother Moment I think and need <br/>
some real good advice soon.<br/>
okay here is the situation.<br/>
My dd is 81/2.<br/>
Over the weekend while she was at my girlfriends house, I went on a cleaning <br/>
spree. In the process I found a pair of undies that I just bought for her <br/>
last weekend, rolled in a ball under her bed. There was signs of &quot;spotting&quot; <br/>
on them . <br/>
Okay I know this is normal but 81/2? Isnt that a bit young , I was 11 myself <br/>
my sisters were both 14, my bestfriend was almost 16. Although I believe my <br/>
husbands sisters were younger than that?<br/>
Anyway I asked her about it and she seemed to not know what I was talking <br/>
about. I told her it was okay to tell me , even if it was a little <br/>
embarrassing but she insisted so I didnt push the issue. I called my <br/>
bestfriend who has a 12yod that went through this over the summer. Her 10 yod <br/>
just had a class on this in school she had some booklets tha she gave me to <br/>
bring home to my dd. which I did and she read them on her own , I left them <br/>
out for her. when I asked her about it , she said &quot;Mom that is sick!&quot;  I <br/>
tried to make light of it and giggled and said I know but do you have any <br/>
questions? She said no and I thought maybe I should drop the subject for now <br/>
.What do you guys think? I know shes a bit young to be able to grasp this <br/>
concept , so I dont want to freak her out, but at the same time I want to <br/>
make sure she knows what shes doing too. She absolutely hates to go to the <br/>
Drs. and I think she is too young for that kind of Dr. Does anyone agree? The <br/>
booklet also said that its okay to use Tampons for swimming, ?????? For an 8 <br/>
yo? I think not. <br/>
Anybody have answers or ideas as to handle this situation?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HELP!!<br/>
Not ready Mom<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037224585"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is it really<br/>
&gt; objective to make blanket statements about the use of tampons when we all<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t be so noble to say we&#39;ve never used any of these other products. I<br/>
&gt; hate conflict and don&#39;t want anyone to think I&#39;m looking for a fight. I just<br/>
&gt; think we all need to examine oue daily practices  a liitle closer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. I use cloth menstrual pads about 25% of the time. I&#39;m trying to<br/>
work myself up to longer periods. No pun intended. :p<br/>
<br/>
The best, most comfortable brand I&#39;ve used so far are the Glad Rags. They<br/>
aren&#39;t cheap but they are so much more comfortable than the paper/plastic<br/>
combo. Here&#39;s the URL: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gladrags.com/">http://www.gladrags.com/</a><br/>
