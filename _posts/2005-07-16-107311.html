<div id="ygrps-yiv-669435591">We went to see the lady in Santa Monica (number three in the Surgeon search)<br/>
on Wednesday arriving in plenty of time. I was surprised that the office was<br/>
so�.officey. Not painted fun or with posters, but there were toys.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So Jayn was equally negative and refused to open her mouth, saying<br/>
repeatedly that she just wanted to go home. Again I think it was partly<br/>
tiredness, however I have been observing, talking to Jayn and thinking hard,<br/>
and I believe I have gotten to the &quot;root&quot; of the issue.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As soon as the dentist saw that Jayn was reluctant she said to her that<br/>
James and I would have to go out unless Jayn got in the chair and opened her<br/>
mouth. So unfortunately she began by making a threat, that I was certainly<br/>
startled by given the talking up we had received, and not remotely prepared<br/>
to back up. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It was a mistake that Jayn was not prepared to forgive. Instead I took Jayn<br/>
to the bathroom to talk it over with her. She sort of agreed to let the<br/>
doctor look, but then changed her mind in the hallway saying she did not<br/>
like the dentist. She sat on my lap and cried a lot. We tried looking at<br/>
photos, and the dentist talked about her two daughters, but the damage had<br/>
been done. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
James talked to her while Jayn and I were out, and explained more about our<br/>
parenting philosophy. I think part of the problem is in the phrases along<br/>
the lines of &quot;meet the dentist&quot;. Jayn is viewing that as saying hello,<br/>
chatting, shaking hands, talking. The dentists are seeing &quot;just saying hi&quot;<br/>
as a consultation where Jayn immediately sits in the chair and opens her<br/>
mouth but no procedures are done.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The dentist today made a lot of suggestions about buying a little mirror and<br/>
playacting being at the dentist with Jayn at home so that she could get used<br/>
to the idea. That would be fine, except that that is not the problem. Jayn<br/>
was perfectly fine with everything that was done last week - polishing,<br/>
suction, scraping, fluoride application, flossing, pointy tools, a full set<br/>
of x-rays plus one extra of the bad tooth, 3 different people in her mouth.<br/>
She also shows me her mouth all the time, and lets me feel, and help her<br/>
with Ambesol (pain relief).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
No, the root of the problem is *not* that Jayn fears the dentist, or even<br/>
any idea of pain, which we have repeatedly assured her will be prevented. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What Jayn is fearing is the loss of her autonomy - being forced to accept<br/>
treatment from someone she doesn&#39;t like or hasn&#39;t chosen - so she is<br/>
fighting hard.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think that James and I have been making it more stressful than we should,<br/>
by not listening to Jayn&#39;s &quot;no&quot; immediately and leaving immediately.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
All the docs have given us the impression that it would very fast, but their<br/>
rationale seems to be that the brevity or simplicity of the surgery<br/>
justifies rushing Jayn through the preliminary stuff and pushing her along,<br/>
as if it were all fuss over nothing. Unfortunately I think I have allowed<br/>
that attitude to permeate my *cajoling and persuasions* with her, something<br/>
that I became determined to STOP now. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have decided to express it this way, more simply and clearly:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn *must* have this work done. She has the choice, within certain<br/>
parameters like geography and ever decreasing time frame, of *who* will do<br/>
the work. We will respect her choice to leave at once, which was our error<br/>
and I apologized already to her, and talk over the different places<br/>
afterward.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is how I approached her medicine. She *has to* take it, but she has the<br/>
choice of how to make it more palatable. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What she wants is to go back to the original place, or, her next ingenious<br/>
solution, for the nice ladies to come to the next dentist&#39;s place. Hmmm,<br/>
maybe that would not be totally impossible if we had enough money to achieve<br/>
it. However James is pretty irritated with that place because he feels that<br/>
the other place has a policy of sending the really traumatic stuff out so<br/>
that they stay the nice, happy place - unlike that idea of bringing someone<br/>
in once a month as some other folk do.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sooooo, we next have an *afternoon* (yay) appointment with my SIL&#39;s dentist,<br/>
who we will be meeting, and we have explained to Jayn, getting her to<br/>
reflect back to us so we knew she understood, that it really must include<br/>
sitting in the chair and opening her mouth. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have yet one more lady referral from the dentist today if this doesn&#39;t<br/>
work out, but we have explained to Jayn that her options are really and<br/>
truly running out. We expect that this next place will have more of a happy<br/>
atmosphere. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to think that the best idea would have been to schedule a<br/>
dozen or more purely walk in and say hello (literally) visits with a bunch<br/>
of unlikely candidates, until Jayn got all her &quot;no&#39;s&quot; out. I had been so<br/>
misguidedly reassured by her great experience/behavior at the first office<br/>
that I assumed her willingness would continue. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
**************************<br/>
<br/>
The next section I entitled Eureka when I posted on my local list � a place<br/>
where people are always looking for nice, genuinely kid friendly dentists.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have found a lovely, RESPECTFUL lady ped dentist � full service in her<br/>
office - with what may be the coolest kid friendly waiting room in all<br/>
creation.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The waiting room features a tree in the corner with the kids play area being<br/>
a tree house where they climb up a kid size spiral staircase to find a<br/>
little kitchen, and then a basement going down below the main floor with two<br/>
little cubby hole rooms - and another little kitchen. The ceilings and walls<br/>
are painted with the branches and leaves of said tree with little surprises<br/>
in the painting like butterflies and a wormy apple. There are also a wide<br/>
age range selection of loose toys, a video monitor that was playing a<br/>
classic family film when we arrived, and an arcade style computer game stand<br/>
down a little hall so that it was visible from the waiting area but not<br/>
intrusive or loud. They also have a nice selection of current issue<br/>
magazines for the adults and a clean restroom right in there (instead of<br/>
down the hall by the elevator and don&#39;t forget the key).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just inside the reception area is a the &quot;Magic Prize Tree&quot;, another tree<br/>
with a glassed in cupboard with far and away the coolest prizes we have seen<br/>
yet - no tatty 99 cent store trash here! Jayn chose a lovely princess crown<br/>
with marabou feathers on it before she even realized that it had colored<br/>
moving lights that work in it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn was immediately entranced upon entry and dashed off to play. We went<br/>
early, to fill out the now very familiar paperwork and to let Jayn<br/>
acclimatize, which was the only reason why we met up with another patient -<br/>
two boys including one with autism who seemed very happy and familiar with<br/>
the place. We had an hour scheduled. The receptionist was friendly, kindly<br/>
and altogether gave me the impression that she couldn&#39;t be happier in her<br/>
workplace. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The dentist *came out* to the waiting room to meet us. That in itself is<br/>
extraordinary. She sat with us *in the waiting room* to talk over the recent<br/>
situation and get to know Jayn. When Jayn came over and the dentist wanted<br/>
to touch her cheek, Jayn instantly opened her mouth wide and the dentist had<br/>
to ask her to close it. :-) Jayn let her find the sore spot on her face.<br/>
Jayn answered all her questions happily. I&#39;m starting to cry (again) just<br/>
remembering how wonderful it was after the bad experiences with Oral<br/>
Surgeons. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We went in back to the examining room, which is very open plan seeming.<br/>
There are only two rooms, divided by a partition. On the wall was a framed<br/>
Barbie dentist with Kelly in a seat that Jayn enjoyed seeing. On the ceiling<br/>
was a DVD monitor playing &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. We were invited to bring<br/>
our own DVD next time if we wished. There were enough chairs for both James<br/>
and I to sit with her in the room.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn hopped into the chair without difficulty and opened her mouth. The<br/>
dentist had the idea that Jayn was timid, but I think we were able to<br/>
explain that it was the other dentists that Jayn hadn&#39;t liked or trusted -<br/>
not the procedures in general or the idea of dentistry.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The tooth will definitely have to come out. The dentist&#39;s plan is to do IV<br/>
sedation with an injection initially (she and James had a long talk about<br/>
all the kinds of drugs which he has a great knowledge about with names I had<br/>
never heard of) and do *all* the work including the fillings she needs in<br/>
one go - only about a gazillion times less traumatic. She has an anesthetist<br/>
come in, who ironically happens to be the wife of James and my adult<br/>
dentist. (Why the *#%**^%# he suggested some guy other than this lady will<br/>
be a mystery for the ages...) <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She also asked Jayn directly if she understood that she needed her tooth to<br/>
come out and would she be willing to come back. Jayn just said &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One problem is the increasing urgency, because the swelling began to return<br/>
yesterday. I think that it is partly because of our bad sleep schedule I<br/>
have had trouble getting the antibiotic dose into her often enough to be<br/>
fully effective. We have moved to a different stronger one (with a better<br/>
flavor - it&#39;s like every little thing is better here). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here is some more that makes me just love this woman! She was a little<br/>
concerned about the infection, especially since she is not familiar with<br/>
Jayn�s face shape or skin color. She was the only person to warn us to<br/>
monitor Jayn&#39;s temperature and call our doctor if she raised a fever. Of<br/>
course I know this but what if I hadn&#39;t? Other people had an agenda (force<br/>
Jayn) when they spoke of the dangers of untreated infection; she talked<br/>
about it without trying to be scary if that makes sense. The only thing that<br/>
will sour this deal is if Jayn&#39;s infection makes a dramatic upsurge towards<br/>
her eye. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
After we left, she phoned our pediatrician, with whom she is familiar, to<br/>
let him know what was happening - tbh I hadn&#39;t thought to do so. Come to<br/>
think of it, he may have been able to refer us to her a long time ago! They<br/>
conferred on the dosage and the medication and she phoned the script in to<br/>
our local pharmacy, another small gesture towards our convenience. Then she<br/>
called James&#39; cel phone to ask us to come back sooner, and call the doctor.<br/>
Tomorrow we are going in again in the afternoon so that she can check the<br/>
swelling, and stop by with our doctor up the road - who Jayn loves.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Was this paragon of wonder extraordinarily expensive, you ask? Why no. She<br/>
has quoted less than HALF the price of the other guy who would have an<br/>
anesthetist come in for the extraction. Her consultation and examination was<br/>
$20 LESS than the last lady in Santa Monica who never looked in Jayn&#39;s<br/>
mouth. Yes the procedure will cost more with the fillings and a sealer for<br/>
all her teeth, but still less than the FOUR other visits that the first<br/>
clinic proposed and quoted for - not counting the spacer tooth. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn didn&#39;t want to leave.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
***********************************************<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I told Jayn that we were returning to the dentist sooner she was<br/>
elated. She wouldn�t leave until she had given her a big hug.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She was also happy to see her doctor and did a bunch of dancing and statues<br/>
for him.  The good news is that her swelling is receding. The new antibiotic<br/>
is much nicer tasting too, and Jayn actually guzzles it in milk (every<br/>
little thing is better). Our surgery is scheduled for Monday 26th, and I now<br/>
have pretty much no fears. BTW there was *no charge* for the drop in visit,<br/>
even though we did still go back and sit in the chair.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When we told our doctor about the other surgeons� impatience he was kind of<br/>
baffled � �But Jayn�s so easy!� he said.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sure, if she trusts and likes you. Sure, when you have protocols in place to<br/>
make the child feel comfortable. Sure, if you make the long term<br/>
relationship the priority � hence the lack of that in Oral Surgeons who are<br/>
a sporadic person in a patient�s life (hopefully).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The last installment follows after I play Barbies with Jayn for a while,<br/>
where I talk about my personal �woulda/coulda/shouldas� that would be my<br/>
suggestions for people in similar situations. <br/>
