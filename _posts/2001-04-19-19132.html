<div id="ygrps-yiv-361855127">I got a mail delivery failure message on this, so I&#39;m resending.  If it <br/>
came through OK first time, well I&#39;ve spotted a typo and corrected it <br/>
:-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a harder time deciding how to handle the sexual and women/men<br/>
&gt; relationship issues. For example, my 8-year-old son is playing 007<br/>
&gt; Golden Eye on the Nintendo and my husband mentioned that we should<br/>
&gt; really watch the movie because he would enjoy the action. But he (my<br/>
&gt; husband) completely forgot about the women and how James &quot;uses&quot; them<br/>
&gt; - or they use each other? Anyway, how would ya&#39;ll handle this?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Afair, Goldeneye&#39;s better than the others about this...  much better<br/>
than any of the Roger Moore ones anyway!  but still I know what <br/>
you<br/>
mean...  I really don&#39;t know...  I find this very tricky cos I was<br/>
extremely sensitive to sexual stuff (even just snogging) on the telly<br/>
when I was little, in fact so much so that if i&#39;d been referred to a<br/>
child-psych which the school asked my mum to do when I was 6 or <br/>
7, I<br/>
think they could have thought I had been abused...  but I have no<br/>
memory of ever being sexually abused...  just &#39;aware&#39; from a very<br/>
young age...  I also became active relatively early...  I don&#39;t know,<br/>
I think it&#39;s one of those individual things again.  Now the image of<br/>
women protrayed is a whole other issue, and I don&#39;t have boys so I<br/>
really don&#39;t know about that...<br/>
