<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048276336">[INTRO:  I&#39;m not saying this is about an unschooled teen, but it&#39;s a  teen in <br/>
an unschooling family.  I&#39;ve tried to take out identifying stuff,  so if you <br/>
know who it is, don&#39;t blurt that out; it&#39;s not a contest to identify  the <br/>
author. &lt;g&gt;   If anyone responds, oh PLEASE, please don&#39;t  quote the whole thing <br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve been following the unschooling lifestyle for two and a half years  <br/>
now. For [all but one of my several kids], I am at peace. I see fruit in  <br/>
their <br/>
lives and they are also satisfied with how they are learning. It&#39;s  been <br/>
a rich lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s odd is that the kid who sort of  propelled me in that direction <br/>
is the one I&#39;m most worried about as an  unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s [the oldest boy]. He&#39;s almost 18. This last year he  decided to work, <br/>
act in a <br/>
play, play Magic and spend time online learning  Klingon. He didn&#39;t do <br/>
anything schooly at all (even though he had been told  to take chemistry <br/>
and language for college admissions). I was cool with  that. Felt he <br/>
would come to the decision to take them or not as he gained  clarity. In <br/>
addition, he plays around a bit on the guitar and the piano. He  reads <br/>
some, though not nearly as much or as widely as he did a year or two  <br/>
ago. And he&#39;s devoted to the X box. :)<br/>
<br/>
We set no curfew but asked him  to call to let us know where and when he <br/>
was anywhere. He&#39;s been great about  that. He did, however, flip his <br/>
schedule and we saw him very little as he  tended to stay up all night <br/>
and sleep during the days. He was often out with  friends much older <br/>
than him (early twenties). His job sometimes required him  to work in <br/>
the mornings and so did Shakespeare rehearsals so when those  happened, <br/>
he&#39;d get sick from not sleeping enough. He depended on caffeine to  keep <br/>
him going.<br/>
<br/>
In the last several months, a few things have  occurred that give me <br/>
angst. I remember you once said about Kirby that you  hoped he didn&#39;t <br/>
become an unschooler who went on to be a bum. :) That rang  true here.<br/>
<br/>
[Kid&#39;s name...] has made some not very good decisions  this year... ....<br/>
[censored  part, nothing illegal, just sensitive info], <br/>
got a speeding <br/>
ticket that resulted in a one month suspension of his  license plus a <br/>
restricted license for two weeks (he got this ticket on his  way to <br/>
&quot;break up&quot; with that girl), he became addicted to Mountain Dew (seven  a <br/>
day) and after having had no cavities for his whole life, now has $2700  <br/>
worth of restoration work ahead of him (something like fifteen  <br/>
cavities). Our insurance will cover $800 of it, we pay the rest. And  <br/>
then his wisdom teeth have to come out (after he&#39;s off insurance at <br/>
18).  He was supposed to go to the dentist all year but kept putting it <br/>
off, even  when I tried to schedule it for him, something always came <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
His  room is the typical teen disaster and we&#39;ve left it to him. But he <br/>
states  repeatedly that while he doesn&#39;t mind (on the one hand) he then <br/>
blames his  room for not being able to do things he says he wants to do <br/>
(like writing an  application essay for a college he said he wanted to <br/>
go to). As far as we&#39;re  concerned, he doesn&#39;t have to go to college. <br/>
But we do need him to have some  kind of interest or drive that gives <br/>
evidence to a future (or at least a  meantime plan).<br/>
<br/>
He complains of feeling like he&#39;s never accomplished  anything, he <br/>
thinks he isn&#39;t capable like students in school (not true - his  natural <br/>
intelligence is high and he does surprisingly well on the ACT/SAT  <br/>
tests), and he talks like he isn&#39;t ever going to be able to hold down a  <br/>
job or sustain work in a classroom format. He believes he can&#39;t sustain  <br/>
his attention unless he is riveted and even then, he needs lots of  <br/>
breaks and changes of pace to keep from getting too bored. He says that  <br/>
the Internet is like an addiction.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we attended a graduation  party for our best friend&#39;s youngest <br/>
daughter. He realized that he hasn&#39;t  had a party like this (had said he <br/>
didn&#39;t want one back when we discussed  it) and then started saying how <br/>
he wouldn&#39;t have enough friends to come to  something like this and that <br/>
he hasn&#39;t achieved anything and has nowhere to  go next. Yet even as we <br/>
talk, he ends up resisting any ideas for direction  or steps to take in <br/>
the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
It feels like his life ran out of  control this year and at the end, he <br/>
doesn&#39;t see himself as having anything  to show for it. Yet even with <br/>
his tears and depressed reports, he is also  not motivated to change <br/>
anything about his life. He says he would be fine  just going on this <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
I am completely flummoxed on what to do next.  We can&#39;t simply continue <br/>
as is. But I also only hear suggestions from  parents who come from a <br/>
very different approach. If you have any insight for  me, I&#39;d sorely <br/>
appreciate it<br/>
==========================================<br/>
I sent two e-mails in a row late last night:<br/>
==========================================<br/>
   <br/>
The same kinds of things happen with kids who graduated from high school,  <br/>
and the same kinds of things (and much much worse) happen to kids who&#39;ve gotten  <br/>
into college on scholarships and take a tailspin for some reason.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=- We can&#39;t simply continue as is.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
For how long and why not?<br/>
He&#39;s 18.  He&#39;s not 23.<br/>
 <br/>
My husband got his degree at 30.  Just as with late reading, nobody  would <br/>
know who works with him.  An earlier degree doesn&#39;t make a better  engineer.<br/>
 <br/>
I think you&#39;re worrying too hard too early.   The dental stuff is  a bummer.  <br/>
Why isn&#39;t he still on insurance at 18?  Would enrolling in  school fulltime <br/>
get him back on insurance?  Can you clean his room for  him?<br/>
 <br/>
I offered a couple of Kirby&#39;s friends money to help him clean his  room when <br/>
he was 17.   They did a big re-org.  Could he  trade rooms with another kid or <br/>
with a less-used room so that a full move was  require and he could <br/>
reorganize as it went?<br/>
 <br/>
Could you and he make a list of things he wants to do?  Some people  love <br/>
lists.  Some don&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
Wisdom teeth have to come out of most people and that&#39;s not an unschooling  <br/>
issue.  I got mine out late in my last year of college to get it on my  dad&#39;s <br/>
insurance, and it wasn&#39;t a good time as far as tests and finals  went.<br/>
 <br/>
Can you get your son out away from the house and the phone and the X-Box  for <br/>
half a day or a day or two so you can talk?<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra<br/>
================and the 2nd one from me===================<br/>
I thought of something else:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=-We&#39;ve  been following the unschooling lifestyle for two and a half years <br/>
now. For  four of my five kids, I am at peace. I see fruit in their <br/>
lives and they  are also satisfied with how they are learning. It&#39;s been <br/>
a rich  lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What&#39;s odd is that the kid who sort of propelled me in  that direction <br/>
is the one I&#39;m most worried about as an  unschooler.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because he was in school/schooled so long, unschooling might not have  really <br/>
taken, deep inside him.  He&#39;s probably looking at himself as a  dropout <br/>
rather than a full-on unschooler.  That probably can&#39;t be  helped.  <br/>
 <br/>
But there are tons of dropouts who do well, so even if he continues to feel  <br/>
he might&#39;ve, should&#39;ve done differently, that doesn&#39;t mean something cool and  <br/>
interesting won&#39;t come along.  And cool and interesting things ARE in his  <br/>
life, right?<br/>
 <br/>
Do you feel he would have done better by staying in school?<br/>
If not, start there and run your simulations and scenarios, not from last  <br/>
week.  <br/>
 <br/>
What were your options and what will the results of your choices be?   Are <br/>
you expecting him to be back on, or parallel to,  the assembly line you  took <br/>
him off of?<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
=========================================<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra, thanks for this. I&#39;m mulling it over.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like we&#39;ve  talked endlessly with [him], alone, together, with <br/>
openness and  love. [DH] took him away for a weekend to see [a band] out <br/>
of  town and they talked the whole time. I spend hours with [my son] going  <br/>
over these kinds of issues. And it&#39;s not just me bringing them up. This  <br/>
last time it was him, sort of bad talking himself and comparing himself  <br/>
to our best friends. It breaks my heart. If I felt he was happy, I <br/>
think  I could bear it all. I have been all year. But now things are <br/>
hitting the  skids.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s our most consuming child. He was in school for three classes  total <br/>
out of the rest of his life over a two year period. He decided against  <br/>
that this year and has not done anything school related, even lacrosse.  <br/>
We have had him on less of a schedule than any of the other kids all  <br/>
along. He loved the whole concept of unschooling and embraced it  <br/>
immediately. What he has had a hard time with, though, is that he does  <br/>
compare himself to his friends (Magic, other homeschooled kids, kids  <br/>
from his old lacrosse team) and sees himself as not having accomplished  <br/>
anything. Even when I discuss with him what I see as his  <br/>
accomplishments, he dismisses them saying he never really makes  <br/>
progress, never completes anything, just investigates until the urge  <br/>
wears off. And if it gets too hard, he quits.<br/>
<br/>
We have had friends  come and clean out his room. I&#39;ve cleaned it. His <br/>
dad has cleaned it. It  returns to the previous state quickly. I have <br/>
not nagged. Ironically as a  kid (under 12), he was a total neat nik and <br/>
would work really hard to keep  his collections perfectly displayed, <br/>
he&#39;d spend hours listening to books on  tape and organizing his room. He <br/>
had to have everything in its right place.  Not sure what changed. <br/>
Neither is he.<br/>
<br/>
He is calling himself a  drop-out, that&#39;s for sure. My attempts to help <br/>
him see himself differently  don&#39;t seem to be working.<br/>
<br/>
I thought cool and interesting things were in  his life.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, he is in this Shakespeare play. He&#39;s been in  rehearsals <br/>
for a full year every week, once a week. Yet he told me yesterday  that <br/>
he still doesn&#39;t have his lines nailed (even though the performances  <br/>
are in ten days). I ask why. He says he just forgets. But when he comes  <br/>
home from rehearsals, he is the happiest person alive. He absolutely  <br/>
loves it.<br/>
<br/>
I remind him to study lines. He says, &quot;Okay!&quot; Then he goes  upstairs and <br/>
forgets everything. It drives me bananas.<br/>
<br/>
He love Magic  for the deck assembly and plays, but it&#39;s been like a <br/>
money hole for him. He  drafts, he rarely wins or moves past the first <br/>
round, said he wanted to be a  judge, started down that road and then <br/>
has dropped it.<br/>
<br/>
He likes  invented languages. He studies them, sort of. I have thought <br/>
he&#39;s done more  than he has. He tells me that in fact he is more playing <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
I  just don&#39;t know Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want him on an assembly line. What I want  is to see that he is <br/>
happy (right now he is not), that he is meaningfully  engaged in his own <br/>
life (whatever he chooses), that he has some kind of  understanding of <br/>
the future beyond three days out (this can include college  or not, <br/>
working fulltime at [the convenience store] or choosing to  invest his time <br/>
in some <br/>
interest that he wants to develop).<br/>
<br/>
Right  now, it looks more like he is withdrawing from life in favor of <br/>
distraction  for safety (to not have to grow up). And he tells me he <br/>
can&#39;t imagine ever  getting there.<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;re busy so if you have said all you meant to,  that&#39;s fine. I <br/>
am going to think through your comments again. I want to  explore what <br/>
other ways of being 18 might be cool with us and with  him.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So really he&#39;s never been out of school until this last year?  <br/>
Then this doesn&#39;t count at all (in my opinion, with limited knowledge) as  an <br/>
unschooling situation.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-If I felt he was happy, I <br/>

-=-<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s in a play. He has a job.  He&#39;s addicted to...  crack?  heroin?  alcohol?<br/>
No, you said Mountain Dew.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-He loved the whole concept of unschooling and embraced it  <br/>
immediately. What he has had a hard time with, though, is that he does  <br/>
compare himself -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Well then he liked the idea, &quot;the whole concept,&quot; but he was still in  <br/>
school, and is still seeing himself as one of those (a failed &quot;one of  those&quot;).<br/>
 <br/>
You can&#39;t back up and live it again.  You have to live through  it.<br/>
 <br/>
Talking to him isn&#39;t helping.  Maybe try NOT talking to him about  it.  Talk <br/>
to him about other, real things.  I have the feeling your  displeasure and <br/>
worry is oozing out.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Even when I discuss with him what I see as his <br/>
accomplishments, he  dismisses them saying he never really makes <br/>
progress, never completes  anything, just investigates until the urge <br/>
wears off. And if it gets too  hard, he quits.=-<br/>
 <br/>
I do that.  Lots of people do that.  The VAST majority of them  are over 18.<br/>
 <br/>
Some people have held ten or twenty different jobs in their lives.   It&#39;s not <br/>
a crime.  It makes their conversations fascinating and they often  know how <br/>
to fix their own plumbing and cars and electricity because they didn&#39;t  spend <br/>
their whole lives refolding the sweaters at JCPenney&#39;s.<br/>
 <br/>
Stability is overrated.  &quot;Purpose&quot; is overrated.  They have to  evolve <br/>
naturally, and poking them and talking to them doesn&#39;t help.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-We have had friends come and clean out his room. I&#39;ve cleaned it. His  <br/>
dad has cleaned it. It returns to the previous state quickly. I have <br/>

had to have  everything in its right place. Not sure what changed. <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Puberty and maturity?  If there were not a natural desire to find  one&#39;s <br/>
parents&#39; home crowding and limiting, everyone would live with his  parents.  Maybe <br/>
when he was 12 it really felt like his big space, and now  it feels like his <br/>
little old dusty nest that he needs to grow out of.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-<br/>
He is calling himself a drop-out, that&#39;s for sure. My attempts to  help <br/>
him see himself differently don&#39;t seem to be working.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
They  might be making it worse.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I thought cool and interesting things were in his life.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
If they were a little while back, they will be again.<br/>
I think you&#39;re standing too close and rocking and talking instead of  backing <br/>
up, being still, looking at the sky, having some tea, singing happy  songs, <br/>
and letting a day pass.  And then live a full week, as peacefully  and as <br/>
happily as you can.  <br/>
 <br/>
My mom went to AA for nine years before she decided to just blow it off and  <br/>
drink for the rest of her life.  One thing they say there that sounds funny  <br/>
and horrible at first is profoundly true.  If someone in a meeting is going  on <br/>
and on about the past and the future, someone will say &quot;You have one foot in  <br/>
the past and one foot in the future and you&#39;re pissing all over today.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Rough image, but looking at your e-mail it&#39;s all about how much better  <br/>
things were and how awful they&#39;re going to be.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I remind him to study lines. He says, &quot;Okay!&quot; Then he goes upstairs and  <br/>
forgets everything-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Study&quot; in that schoolish way that doesn&#39;t work?<br/>
You remind him, and he goes upstairs and forgets to do something  fruitless?  <br/>
 <br/>
Read through with him and see what parts he does know and what he  doesn&#39;t.<br/>
Photocopy the script so you or he (or both) can mark up a practice  copy.  <br/>
Where there&#39;s a scene he really doesn&#39;t know, maybe record it through,  <br/>
reading the other parts, and have him read farther from the microphone than you  do <br/>
so he can play that back and try to fill in his own lines.<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s not what will work for him, but what you&#39;ve done so far for a  <br/>
year didn&#39;t do it.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-He love Magic for the deck assembly and plays, but it&#39;s been like a  <br/>
money hole for him. He drafts, he rarely wins or moves past the first  <br/>
round, said he wanted to be a judge, started down that road and then <br/>
has  dropped it.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Some people buy every book in a series, or collect comics, or ski, or  <br/>
maintain expensive bikes or skate boards, or collect pewter miniatures, or Avon  <br/>
bottles, or action figures.  If he LOVES any aspect of it, why would being  a <br/>
judge be better than just playing?<br/>
 <br/>
What is better to put money into than something he loves, that provides him  <br/>
social activity, that involves really complex thought...<br/>
 <br/>
-=-He likes invented languages. He studies them, sort of. I have thought  <br/>
he&#39;s done more than he has. He tells me that in fact he is more playing  <br/>
with them.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
You should be discussing these things on the list, honestly.  I hate  to do <br/>
all this writing and it not go to a larger group.  And you would get  ideas <br/>
from lots of people, not just one.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-He likes invented languages. He studies them, sort of. I have thought  <br/>
he&#39;s done more than he has. He tells me that in fact he is more playing  <br/>
with them.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
This is very, very bad.<br/>
It&#39;s bad that you think playing is not learning.<br/>
You think &quot;study&quot; has to be more than &quot;sort of.&quot;  <br/>
You think MORE messing around with Klingon or Elvish would be better than  <br/>
less.<br/>
 <br/>
You think MORE Magic playing would be better than less.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-What I want is to see that he is <br/>
happy (right now he is  not),-=-<br/>
 <br/>
It might be telling to see that you don&#39;t want him to BE happy, as much as  <br/>
you state that you (yourself) want to see (yourself) that he is happy.  You  <br/>
can say I&#39;m being picky or that that&#39;s not what you mean, but I think a lot of  <br/>
the communication is about you, and yet (as with the lines for the play, or as <br/>
 with his room not being clean enough for essay writing) you&#39;re not actively  <br/>
helping, but just reminding him.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I want is to see that he is <br/>
has some kind of understanding of  <br/>
the future beyond three days out -=-<br/>
 <br/>
He is eighteen years old.  Back off.<br/>
You&#39;re going by the clock and calendar instead of by his actual  readiness.  <br/>
If he were fifteen and not ready, you wouldn&#39;t be pressuring  him.  He&#39;s <br/>
eighteen so the pressure is on.   You have him on an  assembly line with a big <br/>
timer and you&#39;re denying it.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-(this can include college or not, <br/>
working fulltime at Speedway or  choosing to invest his time in some <br/>
interest that he wants to  develop).-=-<br/>
 <br/>
What if he invests his time in interests in the moment?<br/>
If he should only invest his time in interests he wants to develop, you  <br/>
cripple him and misjudge his fleeting interests.  (Or at least you JUDGE  them, <br/>
mis- or not.)<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Right now, it looks more like he is withdrawing from life in favor of  <br/>
distraction for safety (to not have to grow up). -=-<br/>
 <br/>
When kids are not ready to use the toilet, are they withdrawing to not have  <br/>
to grow up?<br/>
When Holly didn&#39;t read at the age of ten, was she withdrawing to not have  to <br/>
grow up?<br/>
When Keith my husband didn&#39;t finish college at 22, was he withdrawing from  <br/>
live to not have to grow up?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I want to explore what other ways of being 18 might be cool with us and  <br/>
with him.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
But you are not 18.<br/>
You would probably do MUCH, much better to accept the way of being himself  <br/>
that is happening this moment.  If he&#39;s asleep, that is a way of  being.  <br/>
Everyone should sleep.  I wish I had slept LOTS more last  night.  You shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
exploring ways to be 18.  You should be  living a rich life and smiling at <br/>
him and giving him good food and rent movies  he likes and let him live through <br/>
whatever he&#39;s living through, because that&#39;s  all people can do.  Pressure <br/>
from the outside makes the inside angst feel  worse.  <br/>
 <br/>
Distraction can be a virtue, but you&#39;ve condemned the distracting  things <br/>
he&#39;s doing as not what YOU are cool with.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-In other words, I know we can come up with the extra money for  <br/>
insurance, he can live with us, we can still pay for most of his life,  <br/>
even his mistake of rotting fifteen teeth. Mistakes happen.=-<br/>
 <br/>
This fifteen teeth thing isn&#39;t about unschooling whatsoever, and you know  <br/>
that.<br/>
For one thing, he wasn&#39;t unschooled.  For another thing, if he has  fifteen <br/>
cavities, when&#39;s the last time you took him to the dentist, or bought  him a <br/>
cool new toothbrush and some new toothpaste?  They have orange  flavored now.  <br/>
Cavities might not even BE from not brushing, though.   He might have systemic <br/>
problems.  Does he take vitamins?  Could you  spend some of your nervous <br/>
mom-energy looking up alternative theories on  teeth?<br/>
 <br/>
If you can pay extra to keep him on insurance or buy him insurance and you  <br/>
KNOW a big bill is coming up, why are you talking to me?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-If he continues to live the life he&#39;s living as he is, is there a time  <br/>
to worry that he&#39;s needing to go beyond that world of X box, Internet  <br/>
and shallow friendships? Is his self-reporting about not being able to  <br/>
focus or imagine a future ever a concern we should address?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Haven&#39;t you or your husband ever had restless, angsty periods of time where  <br/>
you didn&#39;t know what was going to happen next and it was uncomfortable?   <br/>
Think back as clearly as you can about that, and if you have no memories to  think <br/>
back on, consider what would keep you from remembering your teen  years.  <br/>
Some people block out HUGE chunks of their lives.  But if you  can remember, <br/>
weren&#39;t there times you were jittery and felt like you were  spinning your wheels? <br/>
 Does a background noise about what you should be  doing help?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-If he continues to live the life he&#39;s living as he is, is there a time  <br/>
to worry that he&#39;s needing to go beyond that world of X box, Internet  <br/>
and shallow friendships?=-<br/>
 <br/>
You seem to feel the time is now.<br/>
Some people don&#39;t even have shallow friendships.<br/>
 <br/>
Have you done much reading about codependency?  Your life seems to be  <br/>
sucking because you(yourself) don&#39;t like the level or quality of your son&#39;s  <br/>
friendships.<br/>
 <br/>
And &quot;the world of internet&quot; is the whole big world.  There are people  and <br/>
ideas, art and music there.  <br/>

<br/>
===============================================<br/>
(her to me)<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks so much. Really.<br/>
<br/>
I am forwarding all you said to my husband.  I think you have given me <br/>
insight into myself that I hadn&#39;t seen. So thank  you. Really.<br/>
<br/>
[mom&#39;s name pulled, and don&#39;t EVEN try to guess  &lt;bwg&gt;]<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
P.S. If you want to forward this discussion to the list, that&#39;s fine  <br/>
with me. I haven&#39;t had the time to be able to keep up with all the  <br/>
directions it would go. I&#39;m about to go out of town.<br/>
<br/>
A few things  stand out to me from your email which I reread several <br/>
times  already.<br/>
<br/>
I am too busy.<br/>
<br/>
I am too worried and communicate  it.<br/>
<br/>
I have bought into a timeline for adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
The money for the  teeth (of which we will pay $2000 regardless of <br/>
insurance) threw me for a  total loop and worried me... I wondered what <br/>
it meant instead of just  figuring out how to pay for it.<br/>
<br/>
I need to back off again and  fill [his] life with affirming love, and <br/>
joy in his interests, not with  worry and talks.<br/>
<br/>
It seems obvious when you write it, but not so obvious  when I live it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But I&#39;m far away from it and you were dropping all those glaring verbal  <br/>
clues. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe the best longterm thing you can do is to practice whatever tricks  work <br/>
for you for being more objective about what&#39;s happening in your own  life.  I <br/>
don&#39;t like to be objective about the way I treat my husband  sometimes, and <br/>
just realizing that I&#39;m blocking that from my objective view  tells me I&#39;m <br/>
feeling guilty or grouchy or something, and that&#39;s valuable  information too.     <br/>
So if you can keep building tricks for  scanning your life &quot;from a distance&quot; <br/>
(somehow) you can find your own glaring  clues.<br/>
 <br/>
I might take some of the anonymous looking stuff and post it.  I don&#39;t  want <br/>
to post it from the beginning, because you wrote just to me and that would  <br/>
seem cruel.  You can go in and fess up later that it was you if that would  seem <br/>
helpful to others, or just let it be there as is.  I&#39;ll probably just  put a <br/>
bit of the last stuff, at unschooling.com, and thanks for okaying  that.<br/>
=========================================<br/>
===============<br/>
back to this list, end of quotes:<br/>
 <br/>
I left that last paragraph just for balance. &lt;g&gt;  When I looked  back <br/>
through, it didn&#39;t seem so harsh as a full set, and I think the situation  will get <br/>
better with the family really soon (probably already has), so other  than <br/>
editing out all the names (I HOPE) and pulling one story, the full set  seems <br/>
better than the end only.<br/>
 <br/>
The only clarification I want to make is that it might&#39;ve seemed I was  <br/>
suggesting less Klingon or less Magic cards would be better than more.  I&#39;m  not.  <br/>
Neither is more better than less.  He should do just as much of  either as he <br/>
wants to, without the mom&#39;s happiness and hopes hingeing on  it.<br/>

_When Things Fall Apart:  Heart Advice for Difficult Times_ by the<br/>

earth-shattering tragedy, from the title, but she&#39;s really talking<br/>
about how things come together and fall apart, over and over again. <br/>
And how we keep stepping out of the moment to find resolution for<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194829037">I know this has got to be hard for you. Try to let go of making <br/>
comparisons.  That includes comparisons with real 18 year olds that you <br/>
know (esp. his siblings), and comparisons with the imaginary 18 year old <br/>
that you thought he might become.  Set that aside and just look at <br/>
whether he is making progress from year to year.  If he is unhappier and <br/>
less functional now than he was last year, that might reveal a problem.  <br/>
Is he mostly happy?  Can he discuss his unhappiness with a more neutral <br/>
party?<br/>
<br/>
**He complains of feeling like he&#39;s never accomplished anything, he <br/>
thinks he isn&#39;t capable like students in school (not true - his natural <br/>
intelligence is high and he does surprisingly well on the ACT/SAT <br/>
tests), and he talks like he isn&#39;t ever going to be able to hold down a <br/>
job or sustain work in a classroom format. He believes he can&#39;t sustain <br/>
his attention unless he is riveted and even then, he needs lots of <br/>
breaks and changes of pace to keep from getting too bored. He says that <br/>
the Internet is like an addiction.**<br/>
<br/>
The paragraph above suggest ADD, and sounds really familiar to me.<br/>
<br/>
The paragraph below suggests *depression*.<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
Yesterday we attended a graduation  party for our best friend&#39;s youngest <br/>
daughter. He realized that he hasn&#39;t  had a party like this (had said he <br/>
didn&#39;t want one back when we discussed  it) and then started saying how <br/>
he wouldn&#39;t have enough friends to come to  something like this and that <br/>
he hasn&#39;t achieved anything and has nowhere to  go next. Yet even as we <br/>
talk, he ends up resisting any ideas for direction  or steps to take in <br/>
the meantime.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to your 18 year old son, because I sometimes sit around and think &quot;blah, blahbety blah, I haven&#39;t accomplished anything with my life.&quot;  (I get both distracted easily and tired easily.)  (And washing clothes just *doesn&#39;t* feel like an accomplishment.)  Part of what I struggle with is figuring out which of my interests (or tasks) is most important.  My tendency is to do just a little bit of several things, preferably simultaneously. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A book that I like about learning differences, that includes having scattered mental energy (as one of the learning issues) is Mel Levine&#39;s book -- The Myth of Laziness.  (Heck, just the title might make your son feel better.)<br/>
<br/>
A book that I like about depression is Feeling Good, the New Mood Therapy, by David Burns.  (Although I&#39;m sure there are better books specifically focused on depression.)  In my experience, the majority of people who are depressed can&#39;t perceive that they are and deny it.  But when people are unhappy with themselves, that&#39;s a strong sign that they may be depressed.  (Being unhappy with life events is somewhat.)  There are online quizzes for assessing depression, if that would help create motivation to seek treatment.  My one question assessment is does someone agree with the following statement &quot;I am worthless&quot; or &quot;I am shit&quot;.  That pretty much ices it!<br/>
<br/>
But in addition to the two diagnostic labels that I&#39;ve thrown out, I agree with Sandra.  It doesn&#39;t sound like all the comparisons and sense of himself as failing comparing to others are coming from him.  Backing off on your judgements and desire that he grow up and get serious may really help.  Even as an adult, I&#39;m personally very resistant when my mom wants me to do something for my own good.  It takes all the fun out of it.  I really don&#39;t like being pushed to do things just to help someone else, especially when it conflicts with what I would prefer to do.  (I would particularly prefer to make my own decisions.)<br/>
<br/>
I just started reading Parent Teen Breakthrough which is a relationship-oriented book for parents of teens.  Some of the ideas in there may help you get back to the relationship you want to have.<br/>
<br/>
(Par for the course, I just recommended three books.  Obviously I&#39;m stuck on books.)<br/>
<br/>
Playing around with something is the best way to learn it.  Rote memorization has been shown to be not very effective.  Drudgery may seem like the path to success but I doubt that it is the path to happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS  Stray thought --<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he likes learning Klingon because so few people know it that he&#39;s <br/>
distancing himself from potential competition?<br/>
<br/>
PPS  I have a childhood friend who at 18 went to a very prestigious <br/>
college, then law school and then discovered he didn&#39;t LIKE being a <br/>
lawyer!!!  I bet his mom didn&#39;t take back all of the bragging that she <br/>
had done when he was on the &quot;fast track&quot; to success. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
PPPS  Final disclaimer: I don&#39;t have a teenager so I haven&#39;t really been <br/>
in your shoes.  But my 11 year old son loves videogaming above pretty <br/>
much any academic sounding interest.  I hope when my son is 18, you&#39;ll <br/>
be there to hold my hand and tell me that your son is happily engaged <br/>
with life.</div>

<br/>
I&#39;ve had screw-ups like this myself.  One December, we were transitioning from Cobra to no dental insurance (I think), something where we had no coverage after 12/31 and I went in earlier in the month of December for a cleaning and discovered unexpected work that needed to be done, and the dentist had planned to be on vacation for the last two weeks of the year and couldn&#39;t fit me in.  (At the time, I was kicking myself too hard to think of going to a different dentist, but now my thoughts are clearer.)<br/>
<br/>
Moral:  the kicking of oneself or others in the ass and the hand-wringing about bad newsdon&#39;t contribute much to solving the problem or preventing future problems.<br/>

Sometimes I have a feeling like something going to happen, and like people  <br/>
are thinking about me behind my back.&lt;g&gt;  It will last a week or so  and then <br/>
something all new and different will happen.  It&#39;s happened half a  dozen times <br/>
over the past fifteen years or so.  It&#39;s a little like  cocooning up and then <br/>
butterflying out.  But during the still time I get an  almost creepy, scary <br/>
feeling, like I&#39;ll never do anything right or interesting  or useful again, <br/>
EVER, in my Whole LIFE!   And then it flutters on out  of me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096458993">I have a son who will be 21 at the end of August.  He graduated from  <br/>
traditional high school.  He tried different parts of three semesters of  community <br/>
college, only finishing one of them.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s been &quot;in the basement&quot; for a year.  Trying to figure things out,  mostly <br/>
within himself.<br/>
 <br/>
He took meds for depression and I saw a dramatic improvement.  He felt  <br/>
better so he stopped taking them.  Another downward spiral.<br/>
 <br/>
All his friends are in college away from home.  All his friends are  doing <br/>
this or that.  All his friends...  I remind him often that I  love him, that I <br/>
will help him if he needs/wants it.<br/>
 <br/>
I also ran interference with the dad who would ask daily about John and if  <br/>
he planned to get a job or go to school or what...<br/>
 <br/>
I said to him (and others that asked), with dead seriousness;  &quot;you  all KNOW <br/>
John is training to be a cage fighter&quot;.  That never failed to  lighten the <br/>
mood and change the subject.<br/>
 <br/>
He is working a job now doing landscaping for a local golf course.   He&#39;s <br/>
seeming to like it and feel better about himself.  I think he might  have needed <br/>
a little push/pull/lift to get out more but he resisted all manner  of <br/>
anything I offered.<br/>
 <br/>
I felt he needed that time to himself and was there if he needed me.   It&#39;s a <br/>
hard time for boys/men/nearly men.  I&#39;d be depressed too if I  thought the <br/>
world expected me to run out and get a job and work every single day  for the <br/>
rest of my life and do something important with myself.<br/>
 <br/>
Even though we can reassure our children we don&#39;t expect the same things,  <br/>
sometimes they put inner expectations on themselves based on their  friends.  <br/>
Often their friends have really pushy parents that have lots of  expectations.<br/>
 <br/>
I just wanted to let you know that even kids who graduate from a  traditional <br/>
high school sometimes go through the same thing as your son.<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t say how it all ends up yet, the story is still being written, by  <br/>
John, as he goes.<br/>
