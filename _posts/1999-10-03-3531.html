<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597038054">I am very apple shaped & the both of my children spent lots of time in the<br/>
sling, especially my youngest.  Check Dr Sears books, and others, for<br/>
illustrations of different ways to wear it.<br/>
<br/>
With the sling, you still spend lots of time with the oldest.  Melanie, I<br/>
think it will be easier once the baby is here because right now you easily<br/>
tire due to the pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
If baby is in bed with you when it wakes up hungry, you don&#39;t even really<br/>
wake up, you just roll over & help the baby get started then you are back to<br/>
sleep...the baby nurses until full & also falls asleep.  Next morning you<br/>
are not tired because you&#39;ve had plenty of sleep.  And the baby never gets<br/>
mad from having to wait until it wakes you up enough to get to him/her.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I want to point out that slings seem to work better for pear-shaped women<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than for apple-shaped woman.  (An apple-shaped woman has hips that are not<br/>
very big and a waist that is not very small.  It&#39;s harder to carry a larger<br/>
baby on your hip if you are built like this.)  Other types of carriers may<br/>
work better for a woman who isn&#39;t pear -shaped.&lt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039626806"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Now with attachment parenting did you go out every once in a while,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just you and your husband, or was the baby always with you?  Also, when<br/>
baby fell asleep did<br/>
you put her in a crib or ... what did you do?  I&#39;m just curious.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how one person did it.  I didn&#39;t know the term AP at the time.  I<br/>
chose to never give my second child supplemental milk feedings (ie, no<br/>
bottles).  I have no regrets!  That first year went by so quick!  My<br/>
husband and I are still very much in love, in spite of having little time<br/>
&quot;alone together&quot; when our children were young.  And yes, I did put my<br/>
baby down when she slept.  Put her down sometimes when she was awake too!<br/>
Maybe there is a reason God made men and women different.  If infants<br/>
need Mom the most, could it be God made a mistake?  Or was God&#39;s plan to<br/>
have a father nuture a mother so that the mother could nurture the<br/>
infant?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532562406">I think fathers, with the exception of nursing, (which is an important<br/>
difference) are capable of nurturing their babies every bit as much as<br/>
mothers.  I disagree that it is God&#39;s plan for fathers to primarily nurture<br/>
mothers so they,  in turn can nurture babies.<br/>
<br/>
It is in fact part of the bigger problems in the world, that fathers are so<br/>
divorced from nurturing babies.  It is one of the ways in which men are able<br/>
to perpetuate the violence that they do.... world wide, cross culturally,<br/>
internationally, and at the expense of children, women and men everywhere.<br/>
Men that are intimately involved in the nurturing of children are much less<br/>
able, willing or inclined to perpetuate violence in its many forms, on other<br/>
people&#39;s children.  This goes across, economic lines too.  The CEO who<br/>
bathed his babies, stayed up all night with them when they were ill, changed<br/>
their diapers right along with the mother, cuddled their infants, carried<br/>
their babies around a lot, is much less likely to support a corporate agenda<br/>
which destroys the lives of children. Sadly there aren&#39;t very many.<br/>
<br/>
The division of men and women and their roles is much more of a social and<br/>
political construct (lots of evidence from cross cultural studies showing<br/>
dramatic differences in some cultures) than the will of God.<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect, I do not want someone else to interpret God&#39;s will for<br/>
me or to make pronouncements about what God&#39;s will is.  Each person gets to<br/>
do that for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It is okay with me if the gender construct which I see as transient and<br/>
obviously in constant transition is the will of God in someone else&#39;s<br/>
opinion.  But I don&#39;t see it that way and I question the usefulness of using<br/>
God for the purposes of discussion.   Anyone can and does use the Will Of<br/>
God to justify whatever their position might be.  Means nothing to me. In<br/>
terms of logical argument it is the logical fallacy of &quot;appeal to authority&quot;<br/>
which simply clouds issues. But perhaps I am only stating the obvious limits<br/>
to an otherwise logical discussion.  Truly no offense intended and I really<br/>
do support people&#39;s absolute right to believe whatever they choose to<br/>

I just thought her statement might help my husband not feel so lost when our<br/>
daughter won&#39;t be comforted by him but is instantly comforted by me.  But I do<br/>
agree with you also.  Although he does change diapers and carries her around<br/>
when she&#39;ll let him, without crying. And he LOVES playing with her, but of<br/>
course she&#39;s at that age where she can get overstimulated quickly.  Right?  And<br/>
she doesn&#39;t respond to his cuddle efforts very well.  He tries but when she&#39;s<br/>
crying she just wants nothing to do with him.  Is there something you think<br/>
might help?  From a father&#39;s perspective?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure he wishes he could spend as much time with her as I do, along with our<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838285128">I really don&#39;t know the answer.  I have had a few occasions when whatever I did<br/>
wasn&#39;t good enough and sometimes it does not feel good.   I had lots of occasions<br/>
when I walked with an inconsolable baby for a long time.  Nothing anyone did had<br/>
much effect so I just kept walking and singing and hoping that whatever was wrong<br/>
would right itself.  It did but eeesh the process was unpleasant.  Crying babies<br/>
yard hard on the instincts and when you can&#39;t fix it it is in my experience<br/>
excruciating.  At least the baby knows someone is there trying.  Maybe it is baby<br/>
existential angst?  I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite things with my babies was holding them until they fell asleep,<br/>
(usually while I was reclining on the couch) and letting the soporific vibes wash<br/>
over me and put me to sleep too.  Me and kids both seemed to love it.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could offer some useful advice.  Dealing with all the &quot;male&quot; anger stuff<br/>
certainly can&#39;t hurt. Many men do have trouble feeling sorrow, grief and fear but<br/>
are really comfortable with anger.  It is a problem for the world.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

my dh is exactly the same, my guys are 10 1/2 AND 8 1/2,  and dh is still <br/>
going.  He is soooo great, really gives them more understanding then I do, I <br/>
tend to get a bit testy around 9pm!  but he is so great, not a thing in this <br/>
house that he can&#39;t and won&#39;t do, except the puter! lol.  He is just so good. <br/>
Glad that there are other dads out there like him, the kids that have this <br/>
kind of dad are the luckiest kids in the world! <br/>

Same here Nancy.  I debated within myself to breast or bottle feed this last <br/>
one.  After months of agony I decided to bottle feed.  My dh said after I <br/>
made my decision it was a real load off his mind.  Seems he would&#39;ve really <br/>
missed the feedings.<br/>

Yes these all sound good!  Most people when they speak <br/>
of attachment parenting, they are talking about a lifestyle term that<br/>
was coined by Dr. Bill and Martha Sears, pediatrician, La Leche<br/>
League Leader and parents to eight children.  Many people think<br/>
of AP (attachment parenting) as natural parenting, and often this<br/>
type of parenting can be found in non-industrialized cultures and<br/>
considered the norm.  Most Americans practicing AP start from<br/>
birth, looking to birth their children in the gentle environment, <br/>
breastfeeding and sleep sharing, and carrying your baby/child in<br/>
a sling or in arms.  Crying it out and physical punishment<br/>
are not considered AP.  You do not have to have done all of the<br/>
above practices to be AP I believe, (example; some women may not have had<br/>
all the correct information or support to breastfeed their child, but practice<br/>
other attachment/bonding practices).  In turn these practices help you and<br/>
your child become in tune with each other, so you can better parent etc.<br/>
There are tons of sites on the<br/>
web where you can learn more about this.  Hope this helps! ps. I think that <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling is a very natural progression from and early<br/>
APing lifestyle.  <br/>

I have been sporadic in keeping up to date with this list and so may be<br/>
saying something that has been said already.  I think before we used the<br/>
term attachment parenting, we used a term in La Leche League--marsupial<br/>
mothering, meaning we had babies on our bodies, or someone&#39;s body, toting<br/>
them, until they chose to crawl/toddle off to do their own thing and then<br/>
still offered to hold/carry them as much as they wanted until they no longer<br/>
wanted or needed it.  I suspect the term attachment parenting evolved from<br/>
that, and certainly fits well with our unschooling ways and beliefs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367101675">Thank you everyone for the definition to this phrase..<br/>
it certainly helps now..to put things into place...<br/>
guess I can now phrase myself this way, since I just <br/>
didn&#39;t know better with my first..will be able to &quot;do&quot;<br/>
more for my second (whenever that comes along)..<br/>
unschooling my 3 yo is as natural a process as I can<br/>
think of..ofcourse he is only 3..but sometimes I sway<br/>
back and forth, thinking preschool would be &quot;good&quot; for<br/>
him, then ofcourse I read another book..this time, thanks<br/>
to someone on the list, Playful Learning, and am back to knowing<br/>
I can do this on my own.  Now I&#39;m trying to feel out the other<br/>
mothers at the moms/tots class we go to...anyway...<br/>
thank you all<br/>

getting really tired of this snow..need some warm sunshine, mud in<br/>

My big attachment parenting messages, the things that turned me around in my <br/>
head so I could go a new direction, were heard at La Leche League meetings: <br/>
&quot;You might now know how to nurse a baby, but your baby instinctively knows what <br/>
he needs.  Listen to him.&quot;  And &quot;You and your child are partners in this&quot; <br/>
(&quot;this&quot; being their sustenance and comfort, and sure enough, when he was more <br/>
comfortable, so was I--physically and emotionally both).<br/>
