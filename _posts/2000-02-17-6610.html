 </span></blockquote>Well acording to my 16 YO niece who lives in S. Minneapolis, the Mall of<br/>
America is THE place to be.  Indoor amusement park, water park, theaters,<br/>
and dozens of other attractions.  It&#39;s the biggest mall in America, and the<br/>
second largest in the world (after Edmonton Mall in Canada.)<br/>
