<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131417257">I have not ever posted here before, but feel this group may be able <br/>
to help with this question.<br/>
<br/>
We are considering a job assignment for my dh in possibly London, <br/>
The Hague or Singapore.  Does anyone on this list have personal or <br/>
secondary experience with unschooling in the UK, Netherlands or <br/>
Singapore?  I would so like to hear and talk to someone who could <br/>
address the legality of homeschooling/unschooling as an ex-pat, and <br/>
the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of the experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868829242">I live in the UK and am unschooling both of my children.  So far we <br/>
remain outside of the radar of the Local Education Authority (LEA) <br/>
and have had no legal issues.  There is a movement toward all <br/>
children being under governmental surveillance--a child was <br/>
neglected/abused and died under government surveillance so they want <br/>
to make sure that all children can suffer greater levels of <br/>
government intervention, so our relative anonymity may not last. <br/>
Where we live (in the Northeast of England) there is very little in <br/>
the way of unschooling.  I would imagine just by sheer population <br/>
density there would be more unschoolers about in London.  The <br/>
national homeschooling charity can be found at <br/>
www.educationotherwise.co.uk. <br/>
<br/>
I know very little about homeschooling in the Netherlands or in <br/>
Singapore.  I found this <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/Singapore.htm">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/Singapore.htm</a> about <br/>
Singapore, so as an ex-pat it looks like you&#39;d not fall under any <br/>
consideration by the government.  My understand is that it is very <br/>
difficult to homeschool in the Netherlands and this site <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nvvto.nl/page4.html">http://www.nvvto.nl/page4.html</a> seems to verify that.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your move.<br/>
