 </span></blockquote>Yours is not really an &quot;unschooling&quot; problem, but a common sense problem and<br/>
an unlearning problem for you. Your upbringing, in this case, was rigid,<br/>
insensitive, simple-minded. It is a familiar story, however, when parents<br/>
make dumb requirements of their kids...the old story about finishing what<br/>
you start, no matter what, even if it&#39;s stupid and boring -- like school.<br/>

If you want to quit smoking, do you smoke the rest of the pack just because<br/>
you&#39;ve paid for them? Does that somehow comfort you that your money wasn&#39;t<br/>
wasted? If money is tight, maybe the kid could have simply watched the class<br/>
and later tried out the carries.  The instructor sounds like a school<br/>
teacher on summer break.<br/>
