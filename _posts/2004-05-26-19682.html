Sandra, a person does not change their unconscience <br/>
tendency to violate boundaries, and be sexually<br/>
innappropriate/abusive unless they have done the<br/>
personal examination/healing work to explore what lead<br/>
to that behaviour to begin with.  This is something<br/>
that time does not heal.  A child molester is a<br/>
dangerous person for any  age child.  Giving them<br/>
unsupervised access to any child is a dangerous thing,<br/>
period.  No matter what we tell our child about saying<br/>
&#39;no&#39; etc... no force field in a child is a match for<br/>
adult energy.  That is simply naive thinking, and<br/>
unsafe for the child.  Also a violation is a<br/>
violation, no matter what happened, comparing one<br/>
violation to another and saying one is less of a<br/>
threat minimizes the suffering of person &quot;just<br/>
touched&quot; versus &quot;raped&quot;.  This is an uneducated belief<br/>
about abuse victims.  I suggest reading &quot;The Courage<br/>
to Heal&quot; and &quot;Allies in Healing&quot; by Ellen Bass and<br/>
Laura Davis,  for those truly interested in learning<br/>
more about sexual abuse and the effects on the victim.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86706937">It&#39;s me again,  after reading Dar&#39;s post and rereading<br/>
your and my post Heidi, I have to say that i agree<br/>
with Dar.  I was imagining (having read incorrectly)<br/>
that you only hurt yourself once to make your point. <br/>
I agree with the general rule that it is not ok to<br/>
hurt yourself, someone else or the envirnoment.  A<br/>
small demonstration might be acceptable but hurting<br/>
yourself to the point of physical bruising etc... is<br/>
not.  I think that is totally confusing for a child,<br/>
and as Dar said sets the child up to feel responsible<br/>
for mamas hurt.  The moment your daughter begins to<br/>
hurt herself, hold her close so that she can&#39;t, and<br/>
calmly repeat how much you love her and are going to<br/>
keep her safe.  <br/>

&gt; I really do think that what I&#39;ve been doing isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; right.  But it&#39;s been <br/>
&gt; an act of desperation.  Your comments that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; putting a great deal of <br/>
&gt; responsability onto such a young person is true. <br/>
&gt; Yikes.  This is such a <br/>

&gt; things worse for <br/>
&gt; her, but I need to stop her from doing these things.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the first year of marriage, I went through some<br/>
&gt; pretty tough stuff <br/>
&gt; with my dh and I found myself at times scratching my<br/>
&gt; arms up or <br/>
&gt; something similar. For me it was about feeling out<br/>
&gt; of control. I <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know whether I had a right to feel the way I<br/>
&gt; did and whether I <br/>
&gt; was the problem in our marriage and when I reached a<br/>
&gt; point of huge <br/>
&gt; emotional confusion (usually after an argument)I<br/>
&gt; would hurt myself <br/>
&gt; because at least I knew that I was responsible for<br/>
&gt; *this* pain. I <br/>
&gt; think too that it was a way of punishing myself and<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Sandra,  I appreciate the discussion we are<br/>
&gt; having<br/>
&gt; and the thoughts that you have shared.  I would like<br/>
&gt; to add a few clarifying thoughts of my own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ...on choice,  below you responded to my point about<br/>
&gt; reaction versus choice... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ...I don&#39;t think anyone ever chooses &quot;the exact<br/>
&gt; opposite&quot; in all things........But with unschooling<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s neither of those things.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I never meant to imply that someone would choose the<br/>
&gt; opposite in all things, however in individual things<br/>
&gt; like how we discipline, how we nurture, how we set<br/>
&gt; boundaries, etc... the choice itself may either be a<br/>
&gt; conscious choice or a reaction depending on how much<br/>
&gt; we have resolved any issues, should there be any<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; would influence a reaction versus a true choice.  To<br/>
&gt; just outright say that with unschooling this is not<br/>
&gt; the case, in my opinion is a generalization that<br/>
&gt; does<br/>
&gt; not take into account the personal experience of the<br/>
&gt; individual in the given situation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again to my point about inadequate boundaries where<br/>
&gt; i<br/>
&gt; write:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=- Inadequate boundaries leaves the child not<br/>
&gt; knowing<br/>
&gt; what is and is not safe, they don&#39;t know where the<br/>
&gt; parent actually is, and that is a scary feeling.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You responded by saying,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;That&#39;s not an issue with attachment parenting.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, on one level I agree with you, true AP honors<br/>
&gt; the full needs of the child including the needed<br/>
&gt; boundaries etc..., however, given that we are all<br/>
&gt; human, we bring into our parenting experiences both<br/>
&gt; the healthy and unhealthy influences from our past. <br/>
&gt; At times these influences negatively effect our<br/>
&gt; ability to set healthy boundaries even when in<br/>
&gt; theory<br/>
&gt; we are APing.  I have witnessed many AP parents<br/>
&gt; struggle with their own childhood issues and<br/>
&gt; therefore<br/>
&gt; at times be unable to identify the true needs of<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; child.  Parenting consciously is a ongoing growth<br/>
&gt; experience. We are not Gods, we make mistakes, we<br/>
&gt; learn.  The decision to practice AP while a huge<br/>
&gt; step<br/>
&gt; in the right direction, does not excempt us from<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; lessons, or from the influences of our past.  Only<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; personal committment to seperating out our own<br/>
&gt; issues<br/>
&gt; from those of our child will allow our children to<br/>
&gt; unfold naturally.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Heidi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am glad that you are finding a solution that seems<br/>
&gt; to be working.  My son went through a few infrequent<br/>
&gt; expressions of wanting to hurt himself if he didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get his way.  My response, was to hold him closely,<br/>
&gt; tell him i love him, and show how sad i was to see<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; do that.  I told him it was my job to protect him,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; i wasn&#39;t going to let him hurt himself. So i rocked<br/>
&gt; him, cuddled him, nursed him.  I directed his<br/>
&gt; anger/frustration outwards to hitting pillows, or<br/>
&gt; giving him the language that could help him<br/>
&gt; articulate<br/>
&gt; his feelings.  I matched his intonations with equal<br/>
&gt; passion when he verbalized &quot;I want to...&quot;,  I<br/>
&gt; repeated<br/>
&gt; his statements to let him know i heard him.  I<br/>
&gt; affirmed his right to be angry.  And because i loved<br/>
&gt; him it was my job to keep him safe.  He seemed to<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; it, and let it go as an option. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  It sounds to me like your solution is very similar.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You surround her with love, and let her know it is<br/>
&gt; sad<br/>
&gt; for you when she hurts herself.  Repeating the<br/>
&gt; injury<br/>
&gt; on yourself, is dramatic.  My only concern is that<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; might be hard to understand why mommy can do it and<br/>
&gt; not her, but it sounds like she is getting the<br/>
&gt; underlying message which is both mommy and she<br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; not hurt themselves.  I would say trust your<br/>
&gt; intuition<br/>
&gt; on this one, and observe her response.  The comment<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; another list member about being careful about<br/>
&gt; therapists is a good one.  As a counselor myself, i<br/>
&gt; hate to say that there are many professionals out<br/>
&gt; there that are not child centered, and are quick to<br/>
&gt; label and create more problem than previously<br/>
&gt; existed.<br/>
&gt;  Having said all that, it is a gem to find a truly<br/>
&gt; AP<br/>
&gt; centered therapist who provides the needed help. <br/>
&gt; Someone mentioned Jan Hunt.  Jan is wonderful.  I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; spoken with her and she is great.  I found her<br/>
&gt; particular useful for information and resouces, as<br/>
&gt; well as normalizing the sometimes unheard of<br/>
&gt; behaviours that our children sometimes choose.  If<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; were wanting to do your own deep work around an<br/>
&gt; issue<br/>
&gt; however, then someone else might be a better choice,<br/>
&gt; as i found Jan to be more of an educator than a<br/>
&gt; therapist.  (This might be perfect)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my response to you I  didn&#39;t mean for it to <br/>
&gt; sound<br/>
&gt; like I definately thought that you were<br/>
&gt; &quot;unparenting&quot;,<br/>
&gt; however i did wonder if healthy boundaries were in<br/>
&gt; place. I am glad to hear that they are. You are<br/>
&gt; absolutely right when you say &quot;you can&#39;t always do<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; she demands&quot;, and your statement let&#39;s me know that<br/>
&gt; you do have boundaries with her.  The video choice,<br/>
&gt; even though it is Disney, still concerns me.  It is<br/>
&gt; not a choice that i would make. Even though the self<br/>
&gt; hurting behaviour began before the videos started i<br/>
&gt; would still be very selective about showing them. I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; curious to know what harm you think could come from<br/>
&gt; limiting her viewing or something that potentially<br/>
&gt; may<br/>
&gt; be disturbing to her?  I agree with the other reader<br/>
&gt; that said she might be a wonderfully sensitive child<br/>
&gt; who has difficultly processing the images in these<br/>
&gt; videos.  However, above all, I think that after<br/>
&gt; gathering all the information, you are the best one<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; make the decision for your child, and you will <br/>
&gt; ultimately know what is best.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any way Heidi,  I wish you the best.  blessings,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thank you, Mary.  We have changed our lifestyle<br/>
&gt; &gt; since becoming <br/>
&gt; &gt; unschoolers, but not to a point of outright<br/>
&gt; &gt; unparenting, which is what I <br/>
&gt; &gt; suspect you read into it.  My comment on her<br/>
&gt; perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; picking up violence <br/>
&gt; &gt; from movies was based on movies like Sinbad and<br/>
&gt; &gt; other cartoon-types <br/>
&gt; &gt; where someone gets killed.  Perhaps she&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; ready<br/>
&gt; &gt; for these things, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but she is interested in watching them and I feel<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be more <br/>
&gt; &gt; harmful to forbid these things than to let her<br/>
&gt; &gt; watch.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mostly, she hurts herself or threatens to when she<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t get her way. <br/>
&gt; &gt;  An example would be if I don&#39;t do what she asked<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; just that moment, <br/>
&gt; &gt; she threatens to hurt herself.  If I get after her<br/>
&gt; &gt; for doing something <br/>
&gt; &gt; inapproriate to one of her sisters, she may<br/>
&gt; threaten<br/>
&gt; &gt; to kill herself. <br/>
&gt; &gt;  In reading that, you may think she&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; spoiled. <br/>
&gt; &gt; The worry then is <br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes she actually will hurt herself.  Then<br/>
&gt; &gt; older she gets, there <br/>
&gt; &gt; are more ways she can hurt herself.  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; always<br/>
&gt; &gt; do as she demands. <br/>
&gt; &gt;  I can&#39;t punish her for hurting herself.  I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;e<br/>
&gt; &gt; been able to stop <br/>
&gt; &gt; her from hurting herself.  I have thought long and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard about what to do <br/>
&gt; &gt; to help her learn to deal with impatience, anger,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and frustration.  It <br/>
&gt; &gt; could be just a stage she&#39;s going through at 3<br/>
&gt; 1/2. <br/>
&gt; &gt; What really bothers <br/>
&gt; &gt; me is that she&#39;s been hurting herself since about<br/>
&gt; 18<br/>
&gt; &gt; months.  It <br/>
&gt; &gt; definitely wasn&#39;t from watching movies and tv<br/>
&gt; then.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So I&#39;ve began a new strategy.  It&#39;s rather extreme<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I really don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; know if it&#39;s the &quot;right&quot; thing to do...but she<br/>
&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t hurt herself in <br/>
&gt; &gt; over two weeks.  It began like this:  After one<br/>
&gt; &gt; episode where she was <br/>
&gt; &gt; yanking her hair and threatening to run out in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; street to get hit by <br/>
&gt; &gt; a car, I say her on my lap and said that I loved<br/>
&gt; &gt; her.  That every time <br/>
&gt; &gt; she got hurt, it hurt me because I love her so<br/>
&gt; much.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I told her that I <br/>
&gt; &gt; gave birth to her out of my tummy because I wanted<br/>
&gt; &gt; her to be alive and <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be happy.  Then I told her that because she<br/>
&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t see how much it <br/>
&gt; &gt; hurt me when she hurt herself, I would show her. <br/>
&gt; &gt; From then on, whenever <br/>
&gt; &gt; she hurt herself, I would do the same thing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself.  And I have.  The <br/>
&gt; &gt; last time she&#39;s hurt herself was at this computer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; She was upset <br/>
&gt; &gt; because the game she was playing was too hard so<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; began to slam her <br/>
&gt; &gt; knee on the edge of the desk.  So I did the same. <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; ended up cutting my <br/>
&gt; &gt; knee in two places and making a huge bruise.  I<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; this sounds awful <br/>
&gt; &gt; and very dramatic and I guess it is.  But it made<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; huge impression on <br/>
&gt; &gt; her.  She was very upset to see her mommy hurt.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; told her that&#39;s how <br/>
&gt; &gt; upset I feel when she hurts herself.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have no idea if this is the right thing to do. <br/>
&gt; &gt; But it&#39;s all I could <br/>
&gt; &gt; think of.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you for your insights.  Heidi<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  I have witnessed many AP parents<br/>
&gt; struggle with their own childhood issues and<br/>
&gt; therefore<br/>
&gt; at times be unable to identify the true needs of<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; child.  Parenting consciously is a ongoing growth<br/>
&gt; experience. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m probably generalizing discussions from<br/>
&gt; www.unschooling.com and <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingdiscussions@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingdiscussions@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The ongoing discussion for years has involved people<br/>
&gt; being aware of why and <br/>
&gt; what so they can be makig decisions as clearly as<br/>
&gt; they can, based on principles <br/>
&gt; and priorities.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In a way, we don&#39;t need to identify the true needs<br/>
&gt; of our children if we give <br/>
&gt; them enough leeway to indicate by choosing one thing<br/>
&gt; over another how much <br/>
&gt; closeness they want, how much activity or quiet they<br/>
&gt; want, etc.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think my kids need safety and a lot of freedom<br/>
&gt; within that safe <br/>
&gt; environment.  (Some people&#39;s &quot;safety&quot; would be<br/>
&gt; repression or restriction from my point of <br/>
&gt; view, I know.)  I think they need opportunities and<br/>
&gt; experiences and input, <br/>
&gt; and the right and power to say &quot;No thanks, not now,<br/>
&gt; not that.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some &quot;childhood issues&quot; are not &quot;issues&quot; in the<br/>
&gt; sense that they&#39;re emotional <br/>
&gt; infections.  Some are just calm awarenesses of<br/>
&gt; things we think hindered more <br/>
&gt; than helped.   Spankings.  Being put to bed in a<br/>
&gt; dark room and made to stay <br/>
&gt; there even with bad dreams.   Those aren&#39;t &quot;issues&quot;<br/>
&gt; for me, but those things <br/>
&gt; happened and I decided they were not the way to go. <br/>
&gt; So am I person who has <br/>
&gt; decided thoughtlessly to &quot;just&quot; do the opposite of<br/>
&gt; what my mother did?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems more direct to me for people who are<br/>
&gt; talking about unschooling to <br/>
&gt; move toward what will help their children learn<br/>
&gt; without school, and develop into <br/>
&gt; confident, happy people.  Whether or not someone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; parents spanked, spanking <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t help with any of that.    Some people don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; spank because their <br/>
&gt; parents didn&#39;t.  Some don&#39;t spank because their<br/>
&gt; parents did.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466047454">Hi Dana, upon reading your response i realize that my<br/>
post is probably a little vague.  I think there is a<br/>
big difference in overprotection such as you are<br/>
suspecting me of, and healthy boundaries which allows<br/>
a child to feel secure.  Children need to know that<br/>
someone is looking out for their safety and well<br/>
being.  When they test limits and the limits are not<br/>
enforced it leaves them with a feeling that they are<br/>
in charge.  Even though they may be able to see their<br/>
parent, they don&#39;t experience the benefits of a parent<br/>
who is appropriately holding the space that is needed<br/>
for the child to unfold in a healthy manner. <br/>
therefore my previous phrase  &quot;they don&#39;t know where<br/>
their parent actually is&quot;.  This is meant on the<br/>
emotional level.  <br/>
<br/>
A child is not old enough to be in charge of their<br/>
overall well being, safety, etc...  Everything needs<br/>
to be developmentally based. What is appropriate for<br/>
an eight year old to decide for him or herself is not<br/>
appropriate for a five or two year old.  A young child<br/>
can not be expected to have the discernment and<br/>
attunement, nor know the consequences of their<br/>
actions.  They do not have the mental and emotionally<br/>
maturity of an adult.  Letting them decide and then<br/>
process the results can have huge consequences when<br/>
the trial involves material that the child is not<br/>
emotionally prepared to handle.  So yes, i will screen<br/>
my sons books while he is young.  Yes i do monitor the<br/>
computer while he is young.  This is called healthy<br/>
protection.  If he came across something that<br/>
overwhelmed him, talking about it would not erase the<br/>
negative impact, it might lessen it but some damage<br/>
might still be done.<br/>
<br/>
Would you really let a five year old access to<br/>
pornography, murder scenes, etc... I hope not!<br/>

you suggesting need to be in our children&#39;s lives?  To<br/>
keep them away from age-inappropriate movies?  Maybe<br/>
plug in our TV and internet watch dogs to keep them<br/>
from straying into that which they surely don&#39;t<br/>
need...even if they want it?  Oh, better read all of<br/>

I don&#39;t see my children looking around saying &quot;Where<br/>

unschooling, children ARE in charge.  Who better to know what might frighten<br/>
them or concern them than the child themselves?<br/>

Parents do that without even realizing it, I think.  Order in their universe <br/>
is accredited directly to parental control.  My favorite, I think, is that if <br/>
we let them, six year old kids would get in the van and go to grandmas.  <br/>
That&#39;s been used twice just in the past year as a dire prediction of lack of <br/>
control.  If we gave them the car keys, they would...<br/>
<br/>
Not so.<br/>
Silly conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of us have the car keys hanging in plain view or on a table by the back <br/>
door, and nobody has reported kids driving to grandma&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
My collection of dire predictions is here:<br/>

for the child to unfold in a healthy manner.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whats wrong with a child being in charge of their own life? Don&#39;t <br/>
they know what&#39;s best for them at any given moment? They know what it <br/>
is that they need and want, shouldn&#39;t they make the choices that <br/>
affect them and their life?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;A child is not old enough to be in charge of their<br/>
overall well being, safety, etc...  Everything needs<br/>
to be developmentally based. What is appropriate for<br/>
an eight year old to decide for him or herself is not<br/>
appropriate for a five or two year old.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, who makes that discernment, the child or the parent? What would <br/>
be okay for and 8yr old to decide that a 5yr old shouldn&#39;t decide?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;A young child<br/>
can not be expected to have the discernment and<br/>
attunement, nor know the consequences of their<br/>
actions.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why not? Jaiden(5) is really good about knowing what&#39;s okay for him. <br/>
He really wanted to stay up and watch Evil Dead with us. We didn&#39;t <br/>
have a problem with him watching it, we said okay. He then asked us <br/>
if it was a really scary movie. We said, yah kinda. He thought about <br/>
it and asked us if we would watch it with him in the morning, that <br/>
way if it scared him too much he could go and play instead of going <br/>
to bed. He decides the next morning that it was a little to scary for <br/>
him right now, but he&#39;d like to try again when he&#39;s 8.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;They do not have the mental and emotionally<br/>
maturity of an adult.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well....I know lots of adults that my kids are waaayyyy more mentally <br/>
and emotionally mature than. And they are 2.5 and 5.5 :)<br/>
<br/>
Letting them decide and then<br/>
process the results can have huge consequences when<br/>
the trial involves material that the child is not<br/>
emotionally prepared to handle.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But they aren&#39;t making the decisions and then processing them in a <br/>
vacume. They are with parents that love them, care about them and <br/>
respect the fact that they are individuals with needs, wants and <br/>
desires of their own.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;So yes, i will screen<br/>
my sons books while he is young.  Yes i do monitor the<br/>
computer while he is young.  This is called healthy<br/>
protection.  If he came across something that<br/>
overwhelmed him, talking about it would not erase the<br/>
negative impact, it might lessen it but some damage<br/>
might still be done.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have never refused a book, computer game, video game....that our <br/>
kids have shown an interest in. If we had Jaiden may not have the <br/>
passion for ancient Egypt that he has, all because of the Mummy <br/>
movies he watched when he was 1! <br/>
<br/>
Why does overwhelming have to have a negitive impact? I&#39;m often <br/>
overwhelmed-UnschoolingDiscussion overwhelms me almost every day ;)- <br/>
I am curious what negitive impact you think books, games and movies <br/>
would have, that may cause damage that may not be able to be undone?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Would you <br/>
really let a five year old access to<br/>
pornography, murder scenes, etc... I hope not!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both of my boys have access to the world, and everything in it. They <br/>
are both facinated with car chases, monsters, and 80&#39;s horror movies. <br/>
Avery(2.5) doesn&#39;t notice kissing and love scenes in movies. And <br/>
Jaiden will sometimes watch them and sometimes looks down and playes <br/>
with the tons of toys that frequently watch movies with us. So far <br/>
neither of them have shown interest in watching porn. We&#39;ll cross <br/>
that bridge when we come to it. No biggie...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son just got his first paycheck and so of course we spent it on the way<br/>
home &lt;grin&gt;.  He bought a rifle.  When we got home, the first thing he did<br/>
was ask if I thought it was ok for him to take the gun out of the box at the<br/>
kitchen table, rather than back in a bedroom, since the little guys were<br/>
playing outside.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately put the trigger lock on.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; It&#39;s like saying &quot;You have to control your kids or<br/>
&gt; they will X, Y and z&quot;....And then make up some wild<br/>
&gt; statements about what they will do if not<br/>
&gt; controlled.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Parents do that without even realizing it, I think.  Order in their<br/>
universe<br/>
&gt; is accredited directly to parental control.  My favorite, I think, is that<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; we let them, six year old kids would get in the van and go to grandmas.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s been used twice just in the past year as a dire prediction of lack<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; control.  If we gave them the car keys, they would...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not so.<br/>
&gt; Silly conclusion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lots of us have the car keys hanging in plain view or on a table by the<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; door, and nobody has reported kids driving to grandma&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My collection of dire predictions is here:<br/>
