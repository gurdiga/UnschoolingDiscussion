surprised (given that I have two toddlers) that I have not heard anything<br/>
about this couple (the Ezzos) or the &quot;work&quot; until now.  I am shocked and<br/>
disgusted by what I have seen/heard so far.  I probably should not be THAT<br/>
surprised, as I have a distinctly NON-Christian social group, for the most<br/>
part.  However, there are a few moms in my playgroup who attend the same<br/>
Christian church, and they have not mentioned it.  Maybe their chirch has<br/>
denounced it?  <br/>

    I too have not heard of this group. I am a Christian and my whole social <br/>
group is also, not to mention half my church is made of homeschooling <br/>
families! Perhaps it is a specific doctrine that uses this program? As far as <br/>
raising our children God&#39;s way...I wonder why it would be any different than <br/>
anyone else we contact. I feel &quot;do unto others&quot; applies to our children <br/>
also... Loving one another is key and that is difficult to do with brute <br/>
force, eh? The bible says, &quot;Do not sin in your anger&quot;, so please do not think <br/>
all Christians are child beaters! The shepherd does not use his rod to beat <br/>
the sheep but to guide them. That is how I raise my children. Blessings to <br/>
all, Lori in TX</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;all Christians are child beaters<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if one particular point I made actually made it to the final<br/>
edited version of my post (as you might imagine there was lots of writing<br/>
and rewriting), but another person mentioned it anyway:  the Ezzos&#39; own<br/>
congregation has come out against them and doesn&#39;t want to be identified<br/>
with them.  There are entire websites run by Christians who are passionately<br/>
opposed to having the Ezzos try to appropriate the entire concept of &quot;God&#39;s<br/>
Way&quot; for their specific methods.<br/>
<br/>
In no way did I want to imply that all Christians do this to their kids or<br/>
if you&#39;re not doing this you must not be Christian or something like that.<br/>
That, in fact, is one rhetorical tactic the Ezzos use.<br/>
<br/>
And Faith, please know that all this is in no way aimed at you.  You seem<br/>
like a very caring person online and you were just offering something to<br/>
help out in response to a request for advice.  My admittedly rather vehement<br/>
posts are aimed at the Babywise/GKGW &quot;movement&quot; itself. Again, also, *not*<br/>
at Christianity full stop.<br/>

I have, gratefully, encountered many churches where the leaders and most of <br/>
the members do not even know who the Ezzos are.  Of course, I&#39;m quick to clue <br/>
them in and outline the worst parts of the program.  I figure the more <br/>
pastors and leaders I can make wise to this program the better for the <br/>
children.  I was especially pleased to hear the response from the last <br/>
pastor&#39;s wife I discussed this with.  She said, &quot;Oh no, we love children too <br/>
much to listen to stuff like that.&quot;<br/>

True.  Most of the parents I meet who like the program are not acquainted <br/>
with ALL of the doctrine and advice this couple hands out.  They usually <br/>
start with the classes for older children which is a bit more palatable.  The <br/>
advice can help some parents set needed limits and the results they see are <br/>
positive.<br/>
