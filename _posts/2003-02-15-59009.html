&gt; &gt;&gt; So, yes, I understand extremes. I just try VERY hard to not let her<br/>
&gt; &gt; emotions<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; become my emotions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never heard it said quite this way.  Thanks, Mary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does everybody deal with this? I know I do!!!  STILL - with my 18 yo,<br/>
&gt; even!!!<br/>
&gt; My kids are all extremely emotional - very dramatic, lots and lots of<br/>
&gt; joy and sadness and anger around here!!! It can be exhausting. And<br/>
&gt; overwhelming for other people to be around us &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m thinking for myself, I tend to take on any negative emotions around me<br/>
as my own, not just my kids&#39;.  And now that I see it . . . more work on<br/>
myself.<br/>
