<div id="ygrps-yiv-109437803">I&#39;ve heard other kids who were not on Ritalin say that they hear a lot of &quot;white noise&quot; without it, my son included.<br/>
<br/>
The ritalin minimizes the &quot;white noise&quot; and they can hear better...its not a hearing thing, its a brain thing.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that when my son was learning guitar, he could play far better when he took the Ritalin...and he talked more softly too.<br/>

Well I can sing a lot better high, too, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m a soprano.<br/>
And what about bass guitars? Hard rock has bass.  THEY don&#39;t play high...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011101596">Yes thats true.<br/>
<br/>
And a lot of people who do not take ritalin SELF MEDICATE using other drugs and alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
For those who need it and want it, ritalin might be the safer of those options.<br/>
