&gt; Does unschooling have its own problems?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s perfect, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome to posting Stephanie!!!<br/>
<br/>
We rarely encounter arguments about our decisions regarding how Kass & Kree <br/>
(22 days until they are 12) learn/live. However, just yesterday, while at my <br/>
MIL&#39;s house for her birthday, Phil&#39;s (DH) cousin went off on some extrordinary <br/>
tangent about how brainwashed we are to be keeping them out of the system. What <br/>
was initiated as a question as to &quot;when&quot; they were going to go to school, <br/>
from the second I said never unless they choose to, the battle began. Luckily, he <br/>
is one of my favorite relatives, for if he weren&#39;t I am sure my patience <br/>
would have worn thin. Instead the dabate lasted a good 4 hours. His issue: the <br/>
twins are missing out on experiences!!!??? <br/>
<br/>
Throughout the four hours, every which way the conversation went, it fell <br/>
back to experiences. Problem for cousin was, he never did come up with an <br/>
experience they were missing, that didn&#39;t equate to a negative. I however, came up <br/>
with more than a handful, and at one point when Kass came in and heard the <br/>
discussion, she gave several of her own. Each one we gave was an experience we <br/>
would rather not have to deal with, i.e. when to eat, when to go to the bathroom, <br/>
when to talk, when to rest, when to play, when to learn. This unfortunately <br/>
led the cousin to only get more dispaired in that our kids will never know how <br/>
to &quot;handle&quot; these situations. As Kass ate chips and dip, before returning to <br/>
the pool, Richard said,  &quot;Well you are all brain-washed.&quot; The conversation only <br/>
got deeper when Kass exclaimed, &quot;That will be a cold day in hell Uncle <br/>
Richard! We think for ourselves, that&#39;s the difference.&quot; She was by no means rude or <br/>
disrespectful, even though she was offended by a blanket statement about <br/>
brainwashing, from a loved one who doesn&#39;t even have children. Richard did ask if <br/>
we always &quot;let&quot; them talk that way. He was not pleased when we announced they <br/>
are &quot;allowed&quot; to say whatever they please, provided they use the words in the <br/>
proper context. If they use a word improperly, we may give other options and <br/>
some may be considered &quot;bad&quot; words. But irregardless, they are still just words.<br/>
<br/>
The evening ended with my MIL, BIL, 2 SIL&#39;s, another CIL and a couple friends <br/>
all telling Richard, he had no idea what he was talking about and that he is <br/>
worrying about issues that don&#39;t even exist and may never exist for our <br/>
family. So the argument became mute quite quickly when all my in-laws took our side. <br/>
It was almost all I could do not to cry. Not because the argument was heated, <br/>
but because Phil&#39;s family &quot;get&#39;s it.&quot; Every one of them gave examples of how <br/>
my kids differ from &quot;schooled&quot; kids in all positive ways and one even told <br/>
Richard, the problem lies in his fears and his own disappointment, that he never <br/>
had choices. One friend said what we are doing is nothing short of courageous <br/>
in a world that tells us we cannot make decisions unless someone else tell us <br/>
what to do or think. The other cousin closed with the argument, that our kids <br/>
obviously come before everything else, not to mention that we actually like <br/>
each other. He brought up how anxious his fiance is to send the kids back to <br/>
school, because being with them all day is way too hard. He also mentioned that <br/>
he only realizes what an odd thing that is when he sees us. <br/>
<br/>
Richard went home mad and still not getting it, but it was really wonderful <br/>
to know that my in-laws back us up. Perhaps because the twins are the only <br/>
grandchildren, they see what they wish they had done, but didn&#39;t know was <br/>
available to them. I don&#39;t know what will happen when other grandchildren are born, <br/>
but the seeds of unschooling have definately been planted.<br/>
<br/>
OK, so I went way off about me and mine, but the answer to your question is, <br/>
for US, unschooling is perfect. We can&#39;t imagine living any other way and <br/>
would never go back to a school mentality. We trust each other & our kids and our <br/>
family trusts us. So we would call that perfect all by itself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was so nice to read.  We live so far away from any family that we have <br/>
never had any encounters about home/unschooling.  But so often you hear about <br/>
family that is so opposed.  It was nice to read about a family that came to <br/>
your defense.  Great post.<br/>
<br/>
We think unschooling is perfect too.  Perfect in that it is life.  Imperfect <br/>
in that you have all the ups and downs you have in life.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is funny because I never thought of that.  My boys have never been to <br/>
public school and so we have always done it this way.  I guess it is sort of <br/>
like when the store clerk says &quot;I don&#39;t know how you can handle it...I would go <br/>
crazy if my kids were home all day.&quot;  I don&#39;t know any other way.  LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
When I read the very first phrase of what you wrote I was thinking...what do <br/>
you mean... that is the good part about unschooling.  I can go anywhere. Don&#39;t <br/>
have to wait for the kids to get home or for school vacation.  Then I read <br/>
the rest and realized what you were talking about.  ; )<br/>

What a good story!!<br/>
<br/>
If Richard hadn&#39;t argued so hard, maybe some of the others there wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have formed the good arguments they had in favor of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose someone did point out that the brainwashing is what lets so many <br/>
people argue in favor of school!<br/>

I have a question.  Do you think that is because of the environment?  The <br/>
military atmosphere?  You are probably the only unschooler and probably one of <br/>
the only homeschoolers there.  I remember when we were in Germany, my boys were <br/>
both toddlers then, but I knew no homeschoolers.<br/>
